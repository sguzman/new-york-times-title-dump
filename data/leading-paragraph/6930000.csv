The concept was not created by Kenesaw Mountain Landis, who was elected baseball's first commissioner in 1920, and who is credited with rigorous enforcement of the conduct clause."

Rupert Murdoch usually gets what he wants, but he may need some of his trademark patience to convince the board of Dow Jones, the publisher of The Wall Street Journal, to accept his $5 billion offer to buy the company. [Page A1.] The Dow Jones board said that it would take no action on the bid by Mr. Murdoch, the chairman of News Corporation, but it did not reject the offer, leaving him some wiggle room. [C1.] A deal for Dow Jones could allow thousands of its employees to cash out their stock options for a tidy profit. [C4.] Already, some investors, perhaps acting on insider information, have made a bundle by purchasing options in recent weeks speculating that Dow Jones shares would rise.

CURTAILS OFFSHORE AUDITS -- The Internal Revenue Service is curtailing audits of many people who use offshore tax havens because agents fear they cannot meet a three-year deadline for finishing an examination. [C1.] DON'T SKIP THIS COMMERCIAL -- How do you create a campaign for TiVo, the digital video recording device that helps people avoid advertisements? TiVo has hired an agency known for broad humor, and it has created commercials inspired by the ''TiVo Man,'' the cartoon character with an antenna on his head. Look for movie critic Gene Shalit, above, and others sporting antennas. Advertising: Stuart Elliott.

[C3.] TIME WARNER RIDES CABLE EARNINGS -- Time Warner, the world's largest media company, raised its 2007 forecast after surging cable television earnings helped first-quarter profit beat analysts' estimates. Net income declined 18 percent, and sales rose 9.2 percent. Profit was dragged down by a 27 percent decline at the film division, which failed to produce a hit to beat last year's ''Harry Potter'' DVD release.

The dignity, courage and beauty she upheld during her battle with cancer have been an inspiration to us all. Born August 3, 1952, in Coronado, California, she was the youngest of four children born to Ruth and Captain Harold Fuller, USN Retired. She is survived by her three siblings, James Fuller of Orlando, Florida; Richard Fuller of Seattle, Washington; and Laura Fuller Bates of Hythe, England. Marcia spent her early years in Alexandria, Virginia, before moving to New York City. She was a television producer before her marriage to Peter Hamilton in 1982. A woman of great style and taste, Marcia was a world traveler living in Tokyo and London before settling with her family in Greenwich, Connecticut in 1991. Motherhood and family life were Marcia's calling, and nothing brought her greater pleasure than life with her four daughters Katie (23), Betsy (20), Charlotte (18), Lucy (8), and her husband Peter, whom she referred to as her hero during her illness. A gracious and beautiful woman, Marcia had a wonderful sense of warmth and humor that will be greatly missed by all who knew her. She lived her life with high standards that will remain in the hearts of her daughters forever. The Hamilton family would like to thank all of the care givers who attended to Marcia at home, Greenwich Hospital and Memorial Sloan Kettering these past two years and to the extended Greenwich community without whose endless support the family would not have survived.

2007-05-04T00:00:00Z,"Charles Burchfield is so lovely. This artist, who died in 1967, brought a visionary intensity to the depiction of pastoral scenes inspired by the landscape of his native Ohio, blending elements of Chinese scroll painting and the lessons of modernism. Later he painted the semirural environs of Buffalo after landing a job there as a designer for a wallpaper company. The splendid exhibition at the D C Moore Gallery represents both periods in his career, featuring a series of recently rediscovered, large-scale works in watercolor and charcoal. Most of them are composite constructions in which collages of additional strips of paper, or earlier paintings or parts of paintings and drawings, are included in an enlarged composition. (Above, Mr. Burchfield's ''Blue Dome of June.'') Artists have always extended and transformed drawings and paintings with additional sheets of paper and canvas. After all, it can be tough to contain an idea to a single square or a rectangle. But what distinguishes Mr. Burchfield's collage compositions is his peculiar brand of imagination. Charming, often in a childlike or naïve way, his paintings have a playful intensity reminiscent of the illustrative work of William Blake. Incandescent trees, rhapsodic sunsets, waves of fluffy, undulating clouds and luminous sunlight falling over fields of flowers are commonplace for this artist, who evoked the transcendent qualities of nature.

2007-05-04T00:00:00Z,"The clarinetist and saxophonist Anat Cohen has been a familiar presence to jazz audiences since her arrival in New York -- from Tel Aviv, by way of the Berklee College of Music in Boston -- not quite a decade ago. Her May calendar lists appearances with the Louis Armstrong-inspired Gully Low Jazz Band, the Diva Jazz Orchestra, the guitarist Howard Alden and the 3 Cohens, a collaboration with her brothers Avishai, a trumpeter, and Yuval, a saxophonist. Significantly, there are also a pair of engagements at the Jazz Standard celebrating Ms. Cohen's albums ''Poetica'' and ''Noir,'' issued last month on Anzic Records, a label she founded in 2005 with the support of a philanthropist patron. On Tuesday night Ms. Cohen, above, will perform with the Anzic Orchestra, which can be heard on ''Noir.'' The ensemble, impressively stocked with veterans like the saxophonist Scott Robinson, features arrangements by Oded Lev-Ari, who also conducts. Their repertory consists mainly of standards, both Brazilian and American in pedigree. (The Brazilian fare is more rewarding, partly because Ms. Cohen has worked extensively in that vein, and partly because Mr. Lev-Ari resorts to bland convention as a big-band jazz arranger.) For the ideal representation of Ms. Cohen's strengths, Wednesday looks like the better night: it will feature the quartet heard on ''Poetica,'' with the pianist Jason Lindner, the bassist Omer Avital and the drummer Daniel Freedman. On that album Ms. Cohen sticks to clarinet, an instrument on which she has a full, vocal sound; she also interacts fluidly with her fine rhythm section. They play originals, Israeli folk songs and a tune apiece by John Coltrane and Jacques Brel, sometimes augmented by a string quartet (as they will be on Wednesday). Through it all Ms. Cohen plays with a relaxed command, as if she has nothing to prove.

2007-05-04T00:00:00Z,"Prosecutors Ask Jail For Paris Hilton Jail for Paris Hilton is the recommendation of Los Angeles prosecutors, The Associated Press reported yesterday. Documents filed in Superior Court carry their recommendation of a 45-day term for violations of her probation for an alcohol-related driving conviction. The prosecutors said, ''These violations demonstrate Hilton's disregard for the vehicle laws of this state as well as for the conditions of her probation.'' The prosecutors said they also wanted the court to order Ms. Hilton, right, to stay away from alcohol for 90 days, wear a monitor to chart her compliance and continue under a license suspension for four months. The recommendations, which the judge can accept or revise, will be reviewed today by a judge when Ms. Hilton, 26, is to appear for a probation violation hearing. The maximum penalty is 90 days in jail. Ms. Hilton pleaded no contest in January to reckless driving stemming from an arrest on Sept. 7 in Hollywood. She was sentenced to 36 months' probation, alcohol education and $1,500 in fines. A call yesterday to her spokesman, Elliot Mintz, was not immediately returned, The Associated Press reported.

Indian Actress Blames The 'Lunatic Fringe' The Bollywood actress Shilpa Shetty, below, rebuked India's ''lunatic fringe'' yesterday for the furious reaction to the kisses planted on her face by Richard Gere at a recent AIDS charity event in New Delhi, Agence France-Press reported. The incident led some Hindus to torch effigies of Mr. Gere, 57, in Mumbai, while others organized street rallies in New Delhi, and an Indian court issued a warrant for his arrest on charges of ''obscene behavior.'' Public displays of affection are largely taboo in India. A day after the uproar began, Mr. Gere issued a ''sincere apology'' for any offense he had caused. Ms. Shetty, 31, speaking in Sydney, Australia, while promoting her latest film, said that the incident had been ''blown out of all proportion'' and that Mr. Gere ''was just being very sweet.'' Discussing the adverse reaction to the kisses, she said: ''The majority of Indians don't feel that way. It was the lunatic fringe that took over.'' She told the Australian Associated Press, however, that the scandal had been good for her new film, ''Life in a Metro.'' ''It's great timing,'' she said. ''Hopefully, people will now be interested to see what I actually do.'' 'Gilmore Girls' Canceled The fast-talking comedy-drama ''Gilmore Girls'' has been canceled, Variety.com reported yesterday.

Broadway 'A CHORUS LINE' If you want to know why this show was such a big deal when it opened 31 years ago, you need only experience the thrilling first five minutes of this revival. Otherwise, this archivally exact production, directed by Bob Avian, feels like a vintage car that has been taken out of the garage, polished up and sent on the road once again (2:00). Schoenfeld Theater, 236 West 45th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Ben Brantley) * 'THE COAST OF UTOPIA' Lincoln Center Theater's brave, gorgeous, sprawling and ultimately exhilarating production of Tom Stoppard's trilogy about intellectuals errant in 19th-century Russia. A testament to the seductive powers of narrative theater, directed with hot and cool canniness by Jack O'Brien and featuring a starry cast (Brian F. O'Byrne, Jennifer Ehle, Martha Plimpton, Josh Hamilton and Ethan Hawke, among others) in a tasty assortment of roles. Vivian Beaumont Theater, 150 West 65th Street, Lincoln Center, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley) * 'COMPANY' Fire, beckoning and dangerous, flickers beneath the frost of John Doyle's elegant, unexpectedly stirring revival of Stephen Sondheim and George Furth's era-defining musical from 1970, starring a compellingly understated Raúl Esparza. Like Mr. Doyle's ''Sweeney Todd,'' this production finds new clarity of feeling in Sondheim by melding the roles of performers and musicians (2:20). Barrymore Theater, 243 West 47th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley) 'CORAM BOY' Set in 18th-century England, this rollicking melodrama about imperiled orphans is big and broad but not particularly deep. With a cast of 40, an orchestra in the pit and bursts of choral music (Handel, mostly) decorating the proceedings, it is tastefully splashy and certainly impressive, but less emotionally engaging than you might hope (2:30). Imperial Theater, 249 West 45th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Charles Isherwood) 'CURTAINS' This musical comedy about a musical-comedy murder -- featuring songs by John Kander and Fred Ebb and a book by Rupert Holmes -- lies on the stage like a promisingly gaudy string of firecrackers, waiting in vain for a match. The good news is that David Hyde Pierce, playing a diffident Boston detective, steps into full-fledged Broadway stardom. Scott Ellis directs a talent-packed cast that includes Debra Monk and Karen Ziemba. (2:30). Al Hirschfeld Theater, 302 West 45th Street, Clinton, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley) * 'FROST/NIXON' Frank Langella turns in a truly titanic performance as Richard M. Nixon in Peter Morgan's briskly entertaining, if all-too-tidy, play about the former president's annihilating television interviews with the British talk show host David Frost (the excellent Michael Sheen). Michael Grandage directs with the momentum of a ticking-bomb thriller and the zing of a boulevard comedy (1:40). Jacobs Theater, 242 West 45th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley) * 'GREY GARDENS' Christine Ebersole is absolutely glorious as the middle-aged, time-warped debutante called Little Edie Beale in this uneven musical adaptation of the notorious 1975 documentary of the same title. She and the wonderful Mary Louise Wilson (as her bedridden mother), in the performances of their careers, make ''Grey Gardens'' an experience no passionate theatergoer should miss (2:40). Walter Kerr Theater, 219 West 48th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley) 'INHERIT THE WIND' Doug Hughes's wooden revival of this worthy war horse, based on the Scopes ''monkey'' trial of 1925, never musters much more velocity than a drugstore fan. Be grateful that the cast includes Christopher Plummer, in savory form as a Will Rogers of jurisprudence. An oddly subdued Brian Dennehy plays his pompous adversary (2:00). Lyceum Theater, 149 West 45th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley) * 'JOURNEY'S END' A splendid revival of R. C. Sherriff's 1928 drama of life in the trenches during World War I. Acutely staged (by David Grindley) and acted by a fine ensemble led by Hugh Dancy and Boyd Gaines, this production offers an exemplary presentation of that theatrical rarity, an uncompromising, clear-eyed play about war and the experience of day-to-day combat. An essential ticket (2:40). Belasco Theater, 111 West 44th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley) 'LEGALLY BLONDE' This nonstop sugar rush of a musical about a powder puff who finds her inner power-broker, based on the 2001 film, approximates the experience of eating a jumbo bag of Gummi Bears in one sitting. Flossing between songs is recommended (2:20). Palace Theater, 1564 Broadway, at 47th Street, (212) 307-4100. (Brantley) 'MARY POPPINS' This handsome, homily-packed, mechanically ingenious and rather tedious musical, adapted from the P. L. Travers stories and the 1964 film, is ultimately less concerned with inexplicable magic than with practical psychology. Ashley Brown, who sings prettily as the family-mending nanny, looks like Joan Crawford trying to be nice and sounds like Dr. Phil. Directed by Richard Eyre and Matthew Bourne (2:30). New Amsterdam Theater, 214 West 42nd Street, (212) 307-4747. (Brantley) 'LES MISÉRABLES' This premature revival, a slightly scaled-down version of the well-groomed behemoth that closed only three years ago, appears to be functioning in a state of mild sedation. Appealingly sung and freshly orchestrated, this fast-moving adaptation of Victor Hugo's novel isn't sloppy or blurry. But its pulse rate stays well below normal (2:55). Broadhurst Theater, 235 West 44th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley) 'A MOON FOR THE MISBEGOTTEN' Kevin Spacey gives a bizarre, beat-the-clock performance, as lively as a frog on a hot plate, as James Tyrone in this off-kilter revival of Eugene O'Neill's last play. Mercifully, he does not block the view of Eve Best, who maps the contradictory levels of Tyrone's strapping love interest with clarity and intelligence (2:50). Brooks Atkinson Theater, 256 West 47th Street, (212) 307-4100. (Brantley) 'THE PIRATE QUEEN' How to river-dance your way to the bottom of the ocean, courtesy of the songwriters of ''Les Misérables'' (2:30). Hilton Theater, 213 West 42nd Street, (212) 307-4100. (Brantley) * 'SPRING AWAKENING' Duncan Sheik and Steven Sater's bold adaptation of the Frank Wedekind play is the freshest and most exciting new musical Broadway has seen in some time. Set in 19th-century Germany but with a ravishing rock score, it exposes the splintered emotional lives of adolescents just discovering the joys and sorrows of sex. Performed with brio by a great cast, with supple direction by Michael Mayer and inventive choreography by Bill T. Jones (2:00). Eugene O'Neill Theater, 230 West 49th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Isherwood) * 'TALK RADIO' The most lacerating portrait of a human meltdown this side of a Francis Bacon painting. Playing an abrasive radio talk show host with a God complex, the astounding Liev Schreiber seems to fill the air as inescapably as weather in Robert Falls's gut-grabbing revival of Eric Bogosian's 1987 play (1:40). Longacre Theater, 220 West 48th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley) 'TARZAN' This writhing green blob with music, adapted by Disney Theatrical Productions from the 1999 animated film, has the feeling of a superdeluxe day care center, equipped with lots of bungee cords and karaoke synthesizers, where children can swing when they get tired of singing, and vice versa. The soda-pop score is by Phil Collins (2:30). Richard Rodgers Theater, 226 West 46th Street, (212) 307-4747. (Brantley) 'THE YEAR OF MAGICAL THINKING' Joan Didion's arresting but ultimately frustrating adaptation of her best-selling memoir about being blindsided by grief, starring Vanessa Redgrave. The tension between style and emotional content that made the book such a stunner does not translate to the stage. The substance here is in the silences, when the focus shifts from words to Ms. Redgrave's wry, wounded face (1:40). Booth Theater, 222 West 45th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley) Off Broadway 'ALL THE WRONG REASONS: A TRUE STORY OF NEO-NAZIS, DRUG SMUGGLING AND UNDYING LOVE' John Fugelsang's amiable solo show mixes memoir and stand-up comedy in a tale of family, faith and Roman Catholic guilt. Slight but engaging (1:30). New York Theater Workshop, 79 East Fourth Street, East Village, (212) 460-5475. (Isherwood) 'AMERICAN FIESTA' The economist, consultant, preacher and playwright Steven Tomlinson makes his New York stage debut with a one-man show about how it was that he came to collect Fiestaware, the colorful china of the Depression years, which he deploys as a metaphor for just about everything. An astute observer of consumer obsession, Mr. Tomlinson ultimately subordinates much of his clever writing to a tepid and trite political message: that American civic life is a fractured bowl that needs to be put back together right now. American Fiesta is also about gay marriage, eBay and neuroscience, which is to say that it is about much too much (1:30). Vineyard Theater, 108 East 15th Street, Flatiron district, (212) 353-0303. (Ginia Bellafante) 'BE' A high-energy, low-content Israeli show that blends music, dance and sex appeal in the latest attempt to tap into the ''Stomp'' market (1:30). Union Square Theater, 100 East 17th Street, Flatiron district, (212) 307-4100. (Jason Zinoman) 'THE BIG VOICE: GOD OR MERMAN?' Think of two gifted and smart gay men with years of life together deploying their considerable talents from the two pianos you happen to have in your living room. The result is a hilarious and very touching memoir of two decades of love and the funky glories of show business life (2:00). Actors Temple Theater, 339 West 47th Street, Clinton, (212) 239-6200. (Honor Moore) 'BILL W. AND DR. BOB' This insightful new play about the founders of Alcoholics Anonymous subtly makes the claim that the recovery movement was born as a series of accidents. Patrick Husted is excellent as Bob Smith, Bill Wilson's partner in combating addictions (2:15). New World Stages, 340 West 50th Street, Clinton, (212) 239-6200. (Bellafante) 'BIOGRAPHY' A revival of S. N. Behrman's hoary 1932 comedy about a society portraitist and the men who keep trying to reign her in feels slight as a needlepoint pillow. As the play's supposedly beguiling heroine, Marion Froude, Carolyn McCormick never beguiles (2:15). The Pearl Theater, 80 St. Mark's Place, at First Avenue, East Village, (212) 598-9802. (Bellafante) * 'BLACKBIRD' David Harrower's stunning new drama looks back at a sexual relationship -- between a 40-year-old man and a 12-year-old girl -- that transforms, cripples and paralyzes. Jeff Daniels and Alison Pill, both extraordinary, peel their characters down to their barest souls. Joe Mantello is the masterly director (1:30). Manhattan Theater Club at City Center Stage I, 131 West 55th Street, (212) 581-1212. (Brantley) 'THE FANTASTICKS' A revival -- well, more like a resuscitation -- of the Little Musical That Wouldn't Die. This sweet-as-ever production of Tom Jones and Harvey Schmidt's commedia-dell'arte-style confection is most notable for Mr. Jones's touching performance (under the pseudonym Thomas Bruce) as the Old Actor, a role he created when the show opened in 1960. Mr. Jones also directs (2:05). Snapple Theater Center, 210 West 50th Street, (212) 307-4100. (Brantley) * 'IN THE HEIGHTS' Lin-Manuel Miranda's joyous songs paint a vibrant portrait of daily life in Washington Heights in this flawed but enjoyable show. Essentially a valentine to the barrio -- conflict of a violent or desperate kind is banished from the picture -- the musical contains a host of funny performances and brings the zesty sound of Latin pop to the stage. (2:10). 37 Arts, 450 West 37th Street, (212) 307-4100. (Isherwood) 'THE J.A.P. SHOW: JEWISH AMERICAN PRINCESSES OF COMEDY' Laughs along with longueurs (1:30). Actors Temple Theater, 339 West 47th Street, Clinton, (212) 239-6200. (Lawrence Van Gelder) 'A JEW GROWS IN BROOKLYN' You don't have to be Jewish or Brooklynish to empathize with Jake Ehrenreich, but in terms of fully appreciating his essentially one-man show, it probably helps. Especially the Catskills jokes (2:05). 37 Arts, 450 West 37th Street, (212) 560-8912. (Anita Gates) 'MY MOTHER'S ITALIAN, MY FATHER'S JEWISH AND I'M IN THERAPY' Steve Solomon does skillful impersonations in his one-man show, but some of his jokes are as old as the hills (1:30).Westside Theater Downstairs, 407 West 43rd Street, (212) 239-6200. (Gates) 'NO CHILD' Teachers will love Nilaja Sun's one-woman show about the challenges of teaching drama at Malcolm X High School (1:10). Barrow Street Theater, 27 Barrow Street, at Seventh Avenue South, West Village, (212) 239-6200. (Gates) * 'SPALDING GRAY: STORIES LEFT TO TELL' A disarming collage of selections from the monologues and journals of Mr. Gray, the ultimate stand-up solipsist, who died in 2004. Directed by Lucy Sexton, and read by five performers, none of whom resemble Mr. Gray, with an affection that shrewdly stops short of hero worship (1:30). Minetta Lane Theater, 18 Minetta Lane, Greenwich Village, (212) 307-4100. (Brantley) Off Off Broadway 'DENIAL' An engrossing and timely legal drama about a Holocaust denier being defended by a Jewish lawyer, this play examines the moral and ethical dilemma inherent in the First Amendment and asks how much sufferance can a free society give its crackpots and maintain its individual liberties (2:30). Metropolitan Playhouse, 220 East Fourth Street, East Village, (212) 995-5302. (Wilborn Hampton) 'REALISM' and 'JUMP!' The stately Jean Cocteau Repertory (now known as the Exchange) gets a hipster makeover with two foul-mouthed and aggressive new provocations from Britain (1:30 each). Kirk Theater, 420 West 42nd Street, Clinton, (212) 279-4200. (Zinoman) 'T J AND DAVE' The comics T. J. Jagodowski and Dave Pasquesi miraculously improvise a one-hour play at every performance. This is an impressive feat of mental athletics, but the results are also observant, complex and frequently enormously funny (1:00). Barrow Street Theater, 27 Barrow Street, West Village, (212) 239-6200. (Gates) Long-Running Shows 'ALTAR BOYZ' This sweetly satirical show about a Christian pop group made up of five potential Teen People cover boys is an enjoyable, silly diversion (1:30). New World Stages, 340 West 50th Street, Clinton, (212) 239-6200. (Isherwood) 'BEAUTY AND THE BEAST' Cartoon made flesh, sort of (2:30). Lunt-Fontanne Theater, 205 West 46th Street, (212) 307-4747. (Brantley) 'CHICAGO' Irrefutable proof that crime pays (2:25). Ambassador Theater, 219 West 49th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley) 'THE COLOR PURPLE' Singing CliffsNotes for Alice Walker's Pulitzer Prize-winning novel (2:40). Broadway Theater, 1681 Broadway, at 53rd Street, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley) 'THE DROWSY CHAPERONE' A pasteboard pastiche of 1920's musicals, as remembered by a witty show queen(1:40). Marquis Theater, 1535 Broadway, at 45th Street, (212) 307-4100. (Brantley) 'FORBIDDEN BROADWAY: SPECIAL VICTIMS UNIT' Often more entertaining than the real thing (1:45). 47th Street Theater, 304 West 47th Street, Clinton, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley) 'HAIRSPRAY' Fizzy pop, cute kids, large man in a housedress (2:30). Neil Simon Theater, 250 West 52nd Street, (212) 307-4100. (Brantley) 'THE LION KING' Disney on safari, where the big bucks roam (2:45). Minskoff Theater, 200 West 45th Street at Broadway, (212) 307-4100. (Brantley) 'MAMMA MIA!' The jukebox that devoured Broadway (2:20). Cadillac Winter Garden Theater, 1634 Broadway, at 50th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley) 'THE PHANTOM OF THE OPERA' Who was that masked man, anyway? (2:30). Majestic Theater, 247 West 44th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley) 'RENT' East Village angst and love songs to die for (2:45). Nederlander Theater, 208 West 41st Street, (212) 307-4100. (Brantley) 'SPAMALOT' A singing scrapbook for Monty Python fans (2:20). Shubert Theater, 225 West 44th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley) 'THE 25TH ANNUAL PUTNAM COUNTY SPELLING BEE' ''A Chorus Line'' with pimples (1:45). Circle in the Square, 254 West 50th Street, Manhattan, (212) 239-6200. (Isherwood) 'WICKED' Oz revisited, with political corrections (2:45). Gershwin Theater, 222 West 51st Street, Manhattan, (212) 307-4100. (Brantley) Last Chance 'THE ACCOMPLICES' Bernard Weinraub, a former reporter for The New York Times, has chosen a worthy subject for his first play: In 1940, the young Zionist Peter Bergson was determined to persuade the United States government to open its arms to Jewish refugees fleeing the Nazis. Unfortunately, this production takes a hagiographic approach to its protagonist, emphasizing his heroism at the expense of more complex characterization. (2:00). Acorn Theater, 410 West 42nd Street, Clinton, (212) 279-4200; closes tomorrow. (David Ng) 'ANNE OF GREEN GABLES' The trick to refashioning beloved children's books for the stage is to keep both the spirit and the story largely intact. In this, Gretchen Cryer and Nancy Ford -- a musical-theater partnership of five decades' standing, who have moved from their hit ''I'm Getting My Act Together'' to the American Girl demographic -- have largely succeeded. This breezy, upbeat musical avoids slickness and gets the job done, and is nicely cast into the bargain (1:30). The Lucille Lortel Theater, 121 Christopher Street, West Village, (212) 279-4200; closes tomorrow. (Anne Midgette) * 'APOSTASY' Gino Dilorio's fearless play about a dying white Jewish woman who falls under the spell of a black televangelist is pretty good; the acting that delivers it is terrific, especially Susan Greenhill as the woman, and Susan Louise O'Connor as her daughter (2:00). Urban Stages, 259 West 30th Street, (212) 868-4444; closes on Sunday. (Neil Genzlinger) 'GUTENBERG! THE MUSICAL' A very funny if not terribly original satire of musical theater features what must be the worst backers' audition of all time (2:05). Actors' Playhouse, 100 Seventh Avenue South, at Fourth Street, Greenwich Village, (212) 239-6200; closes on Sunday. (Zinoman) 'JANE EYRE' Staged as a psychological drama, this new version of an oft-adapted classic is a shadowy, fluid, engaging production (2:45). Baruch Performing Arts Center's Nagelberg Theater, 55 Lexington Avenue, at 25th Street, (212) 279-4200; closes tomorrow. (Zinoman) 'HOWARD KATZ' The subject of Patrick Marber's comedy of unhappiness about a rabid talent agent, starring a baleful Alfred Molina and directed by Doug Hughes, is nothing more nor less than your standard-issue midlife crisis. This familiar topic gets the better of all the talented people here trying to make it seem fresh (1:30). Laura Pels Theater, 111 West 46th Street, (212) 719-1300; closes on Sunday. (Brantley) 'THE VIEW FROM K STREET STEAK' An attempt at political satire that misses with just about every shot, this play ends up being simply confusing and boring, neither funny nor timely (1:50). Altered Stages, 212 West 29th Street, Chelsea, (212) 352-3101; closes tomorrow. (Hampton) Movies Ratings and running times are in parentheses; foreign films have English subtitles. Full reviews of all current releases, movie trailers, show times and tickets: nytimes.com/movies. 'AQUA TEEN HUNGER FORCE COLON MOVIE FILM FOR THEATERS' (R, 87 minutes) Not as funny as the title or the Cartoon Network series on which it's based. (A. O. Scott) 'BLADES OF GLORY' (PG-13, 93 minutes) In this fast, light, frequently funny comedy about a male figure-skating team, Will Ferrell and Jon Heder stake an early claim to being the comedy couple of the year. (Stephen Holden) 'THE CONDEMNED' (R, 100 minutes) This simple-minded vehicle for the wrestling star Steve Austin follows a bunch of muscle-bound lowlifes as they fight to the death for the benefit of an Internet reality show. Leaden and inept, the movie fails to deliver even the action goods, presenting every fight scene in such quaking, extreme close-up that it's difficult to tell who's pummeling whom. Fortunately, the language of pain is universal. (Jeannette Catsoulis) * 'DIGGERS' (R, 90 minutes) This minutely observed period piece, set in 1976, about clam diggers on the south shore of Long Island has the brave, mournful tone of a Springsteen song (''My Hometown,'' say) set in Billy Joel territory. (Holden) 'DISTURBIA' (PG-13, 104 minutes) A pleasant, scary, well-directed variation on the killer-next-door theme, with the engaging Shia LeBeouf as Kale, a young man who turns house arrest into an occasion for voyeurism and crime-fighting. (Scott) 'FRACTURE' (R, 111 minutes) A glib entertainment that offers up the spectacle of that crafty scene-stealer Anthony Hopkins mixing it up with that equally cunning screen-nibbler Ryan Gosling. (Manohla Dargis) 'GRINDHOUSE' (R, 180 minutes) A double feature, complete with fake previews for schlocky exploitation pictures, that pays nostalgic tribute to disreputable traditions of moviemaking and moviegoing. Robert Rodriguez contributes ''Planet Terror,'' a purposely incoherent zombie gross-out flick that flaunts is own badness the way Rose McGowan (as a go-go dancer named Cherry Darling) shows off her weaponized prosthetic leg. For his part, Quentin Tarantino, more of a connoisseur than his collaborator (and a much better filmmaker), turns out a brutal, talky and satisfying car-chase revenge movie in ''Death Proof,'' starring Kurt Russell. (Scott) * 'THE HOAX' (R, 115 minutes) A first-rate performance by Richard Gere drives this true story of Clifford Irving (Mr. Gere), who claimed to be the authorized biographer of Howard Hughes. Shadowed by the paranoia of its period (the early '70s), this movie, crisply directed by Lasse Hallstrom from an excellent script by William Weaver, is less a morality play than an entertaining portrait of a literary gambler. (Scott) * 'HOT FUZZ' (R, 121 minutes) A British parody of Hollywood-style action flicks from the wits behind ''Shaun of the Dead.'' Think of it as ''The Full Monty'' blown to smithereens. (Dargis) 'IN THE LAND OF WOMEN' (PG-13, 98 minutes) This meek, mopey comedy is the film equivalent of a sensitive emo band with one foot in alternative rock and the other in the squishy pop mainstream. The movie would like to think of itself as a softer, fuzzier ''Garden State.'' (Holden) 'THE INVISIBLE' (PG-13, 102 minutes) This supremely silly retread of the 2002 Swedish film ''Den Osynlige'' proves it's tough to be in love and in limbo at one and the same time. When a rich-yet-troubled teenager (Justin Chatwin) crosses paths with a violently disturbed classmate (Margarita Levieva), we learn there's nothing quite like a near-death experience to repair those stubborn emotional wounds. (Catsoulis) 'KICKIN' IT OLD SKOOL' (PG-13, 107 minutes) Jamie Kennedy tries to lead a break-dancing revival, playing a man who was left in a coma by a break-dancing accident in 1986 and has only just now come out of it. Funny early, but grows less so, and the dancing sequences aren't as exciting as they ought to be. (Neil Genzlinger) * 'KILLER OF SHEEP' (No rating, 83 minutes) Largely hidden from view for three decades, Charles Burnett's lyrical film about a working-class family living in a broken-down home in a bombed-out stretch of Los Angeles is an American masterpiece, independent to the bone. (Dargis) 'LONELY HEARTS' (No rating, 100 minutes) This beautifully photographed remake of Leonard Kastle's 1970 cult B movie ''The Honeymoon Killers'' succeeds better than many modern crime dramas in balancing the philosophical with the visceral, although its villains' dirty deeds still trump its deeper strain of melancholy. (Holden) 'NEXT' (PG-13, 96 minutes) Nicolas Cage plays a guy who can see into the future in this crummy adaptation of a nifty Philip K. Dick story. Too bad Mr. Cage couldn't tap into those same powers to save himself from another bad role. (Dargis) 'PERFECT STRANGER' (R, 109 minutes) There is enough of a grain of truth in this noirish, paranoid thriller set in the New York media world that even after it lurches from the farfetched into the preposterous, the movie leaves a clammy residue of unease. (Holden) * 'PRIVATE FEARS IN PUBLIC PLACES' (No rating, 120 minutes, in French) A film from the venerable French auteur Alain Resnais about love and cinematic spaces, elegant camera moves and six heavenly bodies as seen through a mighty telescope. (Dargis) * 'RED ROAD' (No rating, 113 minutes) Andrea Arnold's first feature falls into melodrama and implausibility at the end, but along the way it is a remarkably assured and complex piece of work, anchored by the director's formal control and by Jackie Dick's quietly heartbreaking performance as a Glasgow video-surveillance officer with an unhappy past. (Scott) 'SING NOW OR FOREVER HOLD YOUR PEACE' (No rating, 94 minutes) A would-be ''Big Chill'' for 30-somethings, ''Sing Now'' concerns the 15-year reunion of a college a cappella group for a classmate's wedding in the Hamptons, and its attendant midlife crises. But the ensemble cast is too unwieldy, and interesting characters are given short shrift. Only Molly Shannon, in a selfless, robust performance, registers amid the suds. (Andy Webster) 'SNOW CAKE' (No rating, 112 minutes) Sigourney Weaver peels off layers of urbane sophistication to play a high-functioning autistic woman living in a rural Ontario town who intersects with an embittered Briton (Alan Rickman). Their technically accomplished performances partly camouflage the suds. (Holden) 'SOMETHING TO CHEER ABOUT' (No rating, 64 minutes) Betsy Blankenbaker's plodding but heartfelt documentary celebrates the career of Indiana's Crispus Attucks Tigers, who, in 1955, became the first all-black high school basketball team to win a state championship. Interspersing grainy game film and interviews with original team members, like the N.B.A. legend Oscar Robertson and the former Harlem Globetrotter Hallie Bryant, the movie pays tribute to a time when basketball scholarships and N.B.A. opportunities were unknown. Back then, a player's only opportunity was to make history. (Catsoulis) * 'SYNDROMES AND A CENTURY' (No rating, 105 minutes, in Thai) Apichatpong Weerasethakul, a Thai director who has become a star of the international festival circuit, makes films that are difficult, abstract and mysterious in the best art-cinema tradition, but at the same time characterized by unusual warmth and generosity of spirit. ''Syndromes,'' suggested by the lives of the filmmaker's parents and the music of Mozart, is a two-part invention on the themes of chance and longing, shot with an intoxicating mix of suavity and sensuality. (Scott) 'TA RA RUM PUM' (No rating, 156 minutes, in English and Hindi) This Bollywood movie about a race car driver (the versatile Saif Ali Khan) takes place in New York, but that doesn't stop it from being a classic example of Bollywood family values. Here, all the city's a stage set, perfect for ''Fame'' meets ''West Side Story'' production numbers. (Rachel Saltz) * 'TRIAD ELECTION' (No rating, 93 minutes, in Cantonese) The surfaces gleam as luxuriously in Johnnie To's exemplary gangster thriller ''Triad Election'' as those in a similarly slicked-up Hollywood film, but the blood on the floor here seems stickier, more liable to stain. A brutal look at the shadows darkening the Hong Kong triads, the film picks up the narrative line first coiled and kinked in Mr. To's companion thriller, ''Election.'' (Dargis) 'VACANCY' (R, 80 minutes) This banal horror retread involves a couple of critters (Luke Wilson, Kate Beckinsale) flailing inside a sticky trap for what is, in effect, the big-screen equivalent of a roach motel. (Dargis) * 'THE VALET' (PG-13, 85 minutes, in French) If you love to hate the superrich, this delectable comedy, in which the great French actor Daniel Auteuil portrays a piggy billionaire industrialist facing his comeuppance, is a sinfully delicious bonbon, a classic French farce with modern touches. (Holden) * 'YEAR OF THE DOG' (PG-13, 97 minutes) Mike White's touching comedy about a woman who loses a dog and finds herself is funny ha-ha but firmly in touch with its downer side, which means that it's also funny in a kind of existential way. Molly Shannon stars alongside a menagerie of howling scene-stealers. (Dargis) 'ZOO' (No rating, 76 minutes) Robinson Devor's heavily reconstructed documentary is, to a large extent, about the rhetorical uses of beauty. It is, rather more coyly, also about a man who died after having sex with a stallion. (Dargis) Film Series and Revivals AN EVENING WITH ANDREAS HYKADE AND MARIUSZ WILCZYNSKI (Monday) This evening includes works by two leading contemporary animators, Andreas Hykade from Germany and Mariusz Wilczynski from Poland. ''The Runt,'' the concluding episode of Mr. Hykade's trilogy of ''country films,'' will have its United States premiere; Mr. Wilczynski's latest work, ''Kizi Mizi'' -- which the director describes as ''a tough love story between a cat and a mouse'' -- will have its world premiere. Both animators will be on hand to discuss the works. Museum of Modern Art Roy and Niuta Titus Theaters, (212) 708-9400, moma.org; $10. (Dave Kehr) RADICAL SCAVENGER: THE FILMS OF EMILE DE ANTONIO (Today through Thursday) The director Emile de Antonio reinvented the art of the collage film in the documentaries he made from 1963 to 1989, the year of his death. He raided network news footage and archival sources to select sounds and images that he would then recombine into radical political statements. This series at the Anthology Film Archives begins tonight with a new print of Mr. de Antonio's most celebrated and influential film, ''In the Year of the Pig'' (1968). A pointed assemblage of television reports about the Vietnam War, both abroad and at home, ''In the Year of the Pig'' was among the most widely seen protest films in the United States. Among the other titles: ''Rush to Judgment'' (1966), di Antonio's critical analysis of the Warren Report (made with the conspiracy theorist Mark Lane); ''America Is Hard to See'' (1970), about the presidential campaign of Eugene McCarthy; and ''Millhouse: A White Comedy'' (1971), a comic portrait of Richard M. Nixon. Anthology Film Archives, 32 Second Avenue, at Second Street, East Village, (212) 505-5181, anthologyfilmarchives.org; $8. (Kehr) WILD AT HEART: BARRY GIFFORD (Tuesday) The novelist and screenwriter Barry Gifford will attend a screening of ''Wild at Heart,'' David Lynch's 1990 film adapted from Mr. Gifford's novel about a pair of extremely star-crossed young lovers (Nicolas Cage and Laura Dern). This will be the rarely screened European version, which includes, if memory serves, a little extra gore than Americans were allowed to see in the R-rated film released in theaters here. BAMcinématek, BAM Rose Cinemas, 30 Lafayette Avenue, at Ashland Place, Fort Greene, Brooklyn, (718) 636-4100, bam.org; $10. (Kehr) Pop Full reviews of recent concerts: nytimes.com/music. AIR (Thursday) This French duo, whose every electronic note seems to drip with breathy, limply funky pop nostalgia, plays as part of David Bowie's High Line Festival. At 8 p.m., Theater at Madison Square Garden, (212) 465-6741, thegarden.com or highlinefestival.com; $36 and $46. (Ben Sisario) * KAREN AKERS (Tonight and tomorrow night, and Tuesday through Thursday) The songs in ''Simply Styne,'' Ms. Akers's beautiful tribute to the composer Jule Styne, have been arranged into a touching, tongue-in-cheek cabaret answer to ''Scenes From a Marriage.'' The pianist Don Rebic is her witty partner in deconstruction. (Through May 12.) At 9, with additional shows tonight and tomorrow night at 11:30, Oak Room at the Algonquin Hotel, 59 West 44th Street, Manhattan, (212) 419-9331, algonquinhotel.com; $60 cover; $65 dinner charge at 9; $25 minimum at 11:30. (Stephen Holden) ANTIBALAS (Tomorrow) This Brooklyn collective worships the musky Afro-funk of Fela Kuti, and can produce a credible facsimile of it, thickly textured with reverb-heavy guitars and brawny horns. Its latest, ''Security'' (Anti-), also follows Fela's other big legacy: no-holds-barred denunciations of political oppression and corruption. At 9 p.m., Fillmore New York at Irving Plaza, 17 Irving Place, at 15th Street, Manhattan, (212) 777-6800; $20. (Sisario) * ARCADE FIRE, THE NATIONAL (Monday through Wednesday) Arcade Fire became king of the indie-rock mountain with a lovable, artsy eccentricity and a disarming emotional clarity. Its new album, ''Neon Bible'' (Merge), is dark and preoccupied but satisfyingly cathartic. The National, from Brooklyn, plays flawless, wilting ballads threaded with subtly brilliant guitar playing by Bryce Dessner and the dry, cynical baritone of Matt Berninger. Monday and Tuesday at 7 p.m., United Palace Theater, 4140 Broadway, at 175th Street, Washington Heights, (212) 307-7171, bowerypresents.com; Wednesday at 8 p.m., Radio City Music Hall, (212) 307-7171, radiocity.com or highlinefestival.com; sold out. (Sisario) THE BAMBOOZLE (Tomorrow and Sunday) The Web site for this lollapalooza in the Giants Stadium parking lot has a faux radio station, complete with obnoxious promo spots crackling with pyrotechnic sound effects. It's unfortunately appropriate for the Bamboozle, a roll call of more than 100 young hard-rock bands that, once you get past the headliners, sound utterly interchangeable and predictable -- the kind that make you want to change the station. My Chemical Romance and Muse headline tomorrow, and Linkin Park on Sunday. A few highlights are Brand New, Taking Back Sunday, Killswitch Engage, Weird Al Yankovic, Captured by Robots, Lordi, Andrew W. K., and Rob Base and DJ E-Z Rock (''It Takes Two'').

(Sisario) * BEIRUT, FINAL FANTASY (Sunday through Tuesday) A year ago Zach Condon, a 19-year-old from Albuquerque who records as Beirut, released ''Gulag Orkestar'' (Ba Da Bing), an album of somber, sepia-toned marches with touches of Balkan brass. He quickly became a celebrity among music bloggers, which means that by now Beirut has become a kind of blog classic rock. As Final Fantasy, Owen Pallett creates nervous universes in miniature, looping ribbons of violin around his quavering voice. At 7:30 p.m., Bowery Ballroom, 6 Delancey Street, near the Bowery, Lower East Side, (212) 533-2111, boweryballroom.com; sold out. (Sisario) * BJORK (Tomorrow and Tuesday) It's been a long time since Bjork's combination of wailing indie-rock, eroticized electronica and use of random musical props -- Inuit choirs, beatboxers, African kora players -- has been truly avant-garde, or even surprising. But her latest album, ''Volta'' (Elektra), still sounds fresh and energized, with every sound becoming her exotic plaything. Tomorrow at 8 p.m., with Konono No. 1, a Congolese band whose polyrhythmic bubblings are made with amplified thumb pianos, at the United Palace Theater, 4140 Broadway, at 175th Street, Washington Heights, (212) 307-7171; Tuesday at 8 p.m., Apollo Theater, 253 West 125th Street, Harlem, (212) 307-7171, apollotheater.com; both sold out.

The doors open at 8, and Magik Markers opens. (Sisario) * BLONDE REDHEAD (Tuesday) Its days of spindly, atonal guitar webs apparently behind it, Blonde Redhead has for the last few years been making lusher, more cottony music, as if finally realizing that its amplifiers have reverb buttons. Its latest, ''23'' (4AD), is a gorgeous trip through clouds of overdriven guitar and heavenly vocals, recalling those kings of overdriven guitar and heavenly vocals, My Bloody Valentine. With Fields. At 8 p.m., Webster Hall, 125 East 11th Street, East Village, (212) 533-2111, bowerypresents.com; sold out. (Sisario) BOWLING FOR SOUP (Wednesday) When the venerable British singer and guitarist Richard Thompson put together his album ''1,000 Years of Popular Music,'' his choices included ''Sumer Is Icumen In,'' Renaissance ballads and Cole Porter's ''Night and Day,'' as well as ''1985,'' a gag catalog of '80s nostalgia by this otherwise undistinguished Texas rock band. (''When did Motley Crue become classic rock?/And when did Ozzy become an actor?'') It's a fun karaoke number, though Mr. Thompson may have been making another point: if you were really going to preserve the most representative songs of our culture, you'd have to include some ''1985s,'' right? At 8 p.m., Fillmore New York at Irving Plaza, 17 Irving Place, at 15th Street, Manhattan, (212) 777-6800; $17.50 in advance, $20 at the door. (Sisario) BRIGHTBLACK MORNING LIGHT (Tomorrow and Sunday) Though nominally part of the current psych-folk revival, Brightblack Morning Light has a sound that is harder to place, and therefore more intriguing: an electric hum; warbling keyboards that evoke damp funk; and ecstatic, breathy chants, like the rituals of a secret forest cult. The songs on its most recent album were written, the band has said, while living in tents in Northern California. Also on the bill: Daniel A.I.U. Belteshazzar-Higgs with Chiara Giovando. Tomorrow at 10 p.m., Mercury Lounge, 217 East Houston Street, at Ludlow Street, Lower East Side, (212) 260-4700, mercuryloungenyc.com; Sunday at 9 p.m., Southpaw, 125 Fifth Avenue, near Sterling Place, Park Slope, Brooklyn, (718) 230-0236, spsounds.com; $13 in advance; $15 at the door. (Sisario) JIM CAMPILONGO, MIKE VIOLA (Monday) Just another night at the Living Room, a plain Lower East Side cabaret that puts on one guitar-cradling singer-songwriter after another, some of them world-class. Mr. Campilongo is a well-traveled guitar whiz who plays with Norah Jones in her country band, the Little Willies; his Electric Trio has had a Monday-night residency forever. Mr. Viola, jumping from piano to guitar, sings strident power-pop with some jagged wit. Also on the bill are Kelly Jones and Phillip La Rue. At 8 p.m., 154 Ludlow Street, near Stanton Street, (212) 533-7235, livingroomny.com; no cover. (Sisario) CORNELIUS (Thursday) Keigo Oyamada, a Japanese musician who records as Cornelius (he took his name after Roddy McDowall's character in ''Planet of the Apes''), is a witty if cold conceptualist, toying with minimal electronics and off-kilter rhythms that sound like the stimuli of some psychological lab experiment. At 7 p.m., Webster Hall, 125 East 11th Street, East Village, (212) 533-2111, bowerypresents.com; $25. (Sisario) BEN GIBBARD (Tuesday) The singer of Death Cab for Cutie, the indie-rock giants whose spectrum of mood runs from lovelorn and aloof to wistful and aloof, is on a rare solo tour. With David Bazan and Johnathan Rice. At 7:30 p.m., Town Hall, 123 West 43rd Street, Manhattan, (212) 840-2824, the-townhall-nyc.org or bowerypresents.com; sold out. (Sisario) KIKI AND HERB (Sunday) A few years ago this brilliantly perverse cabaret duo played their farewell show at Carnegie Hall. Then came a run on Broadway. And some late-night gigs at Joe's Pub. And the inimitable Christmas show. (Highlight: a medley of ''Smells Like Teen Spirit'' and ''Frosty the Snowman.'') Kiki and Herb can't stay away from the stage, and New York is the better for it. At 11:30 p.m., Joe's Pub, 425 Lafayette Street, at Astor Place, East Village, (212) 967-7555, joespub.com; $20. (Sisario) * TED LEO AND THE PHARMACISTS (Tomorrow) As stalwart as you can be in indie rock, Mr. Leo has made a long and admirable career matching the musical fury of Clash-like punk with impassioned, highly personal social commentary. His new album, ''Life Among the Living'' (Touch and Go), is a reminder that he is one of the best and most uncompromising songwriters in the game. With Love of Diagrams. At 6:30 p.m., Webster Hall, 125 East 11th Street, East Village, (212) 533-2111, bowerypresents.com; $19.

(Sisario) * MARTIRIO (Tuesday and Wednesday) This Spanish singer, long a curious mingler of pop, jazz and flamenco, recorded her new album, ''Primavera en Nueva York'' (Calle 54), in New York with a jazz band, its boleros reinterpreted as a languorous, savory jazz suite. She makes her New York debut at Joe's Pub. At 7 and 9:30 p.m., 425 Lafayette Street, at Astor Place, East Village, (212) 967-7555, joespub.com; $30. (Sisario) MOE (Tonight through Sunday) One chord is all Moe needs to start one of its nimble, quick-fingered jams. Its music starts with the Grateful Dead-Allman Brothers hybrids that most jam bands use, and from there it takes off toward Southern rock, spacey interludes or the borderline of funk. At 9, Highline Ballroom, 431 West 16th Street, Chelsea, (212) 414-5994, highlineballroom.com; sold out. (Jon Pareles) NEKROMANTIX (Sunday) Is it Halloween already? This Copenhagen trio follows the ''Munsters''-as-punk lead of the Misfits and the Cramps with a full sideshow of warped rockabilly, B movie titles (new album: ''Life Is a Grave & I Dig It!'') and, most important, ghoulish stacked hairdos. With Heart Attacks, Westbound Train and Orange. At 8 p.m., Blender Theater at Gramercy, 127 East 23rd Street, Manhattan, (212) 307-7171; $12.50. (Sisario) JENNIFER O'CONNOR (Wednesday) Ms. O'Connor's portraits of the lovelorn and depressed, sung over light strums of guitar and with the guileless vulnerability of a 2 a.m. phone confession, are dry but not unsympathetic: ''Maybe she's on her lunch break thinking of you.'' She has a Wednesday residency this month at the Living Room. At 11 p.m., 154 Ludlow Street, near Stanton Street, Lower East Side, (212) 533-7235, livingroomny.com; $8. (Sisario) * JOHN PIZZARELLI AND JESSICA MOLASKEY (Tonight and tomorrow night, and Tuesday through Thursday) These married musicians have been called the ''Nick and Nora of cabaret,'' a sobriquet that only begins to describe their upbeat sophistication. They fuse two distantly related musical worlds into a larger whole in which Stephen Sondheim, Dave Frishberg, Paul Simon, and Lambert, Hendricks & Ross join hands. (Through May 26.) At 8:45, with additional shows tonight and tomorrow night at 10:45, Café Carlyle, at the Carlyle Hotel, 35 East 76th Street, Manhattan, (212) 744-1600, thecarlyle.com; $75 and $125 Tuesday through Thursday; $85 tonight and tomorrow. (Holden) DULCE PONTES (Thursday) This Portuguese singer's champions (or at least her publicists) call her the successor to the fado queen Amália Rodrigues. Not quite: Ms. Pontes's style has leaned pretty far toward the soapy and homogenized glitz you can hear every year at the Eurovision festival. (Ms. Pontes was a competitor in 1991.) But she has a strong, fleshy alto, and for this Carnegie Hall appearance will sing traditional songs from her lovely new album, ''O Coração Tem Três Portas,'' with a small acoustic ensemble. At 8 p.m., (212) 247-7800, carnegiehall.org; $23 to $72. (Sisario) ANNIE ROSS (Tuesday) When this jazz legend barks out ''I Got Rhythm,'' she turns this great Gershwin standard into a hipster's credo.

At 7 p.m., Metropolitan Room, 34 West 22nd Street, Flatiron district, (212) 206-0440, metropolitanroom.com; $25 cover, two-drink minimum. (Holden) * SHIVKUMAR SHARMA AND ZAKIR HUSSAIN (Tomorrow) Shivkumar Sharma plays the santur, India's hammered dulcimer, and has transformed it from an accompanying instrument into a solo instrument that brings shimmering resonances to the classical Indian raga repertory. He will be accompanied by Zakir Hussain on tabla, who can supply subtle propulsion and percussive fireworks over the course of a raga. At 8 p.m., Town Hall, 123 West 43rd Street, Manhattan, (212) 545-7536, the-townhall-nyc.org or worldmusicinstitute.org; $25 to $45; $15 for students.

(Pareles) SLOAN (Thursday) Like modern metafictions, Sloan's pop-rock songs twist inward on themselves. With their winsome tunes and neo-Beatles intricacies, Sloan's songs are not just about unrequited yearnings, but also about the process of writing pop songs about unrequited yearnings. They're rarely so clever that their heart doesn't come through. With Small Sins. At 9 p.m., Maxwell's, 1039 Washington Street, Hoboken, N.J., (201) 653-1703, maxwellsnj.com; $20. (Pareles) SUNSET RUBDOWN (Tonight) A solo enterprise of the prolific Spencer Krug, who sings and plays keyboards in the Montreal indie-arty band Wolf Parade, Sunset Rubdown is one of those weirdly fascinating bedroom noise projects characterized by stompy lo-fi backing tracks and evocative stream-of-consciousness lyrics (''Shut up, I am dreaming of places where lovers have wings''). With Katie Eastburn and Get Him Eat Him. At 8:30, Bowery Ballroom, 6 Delancey Street, near the Bowery, Lower East Side, (212) 533-2111, boweryballroom.com; sold out. (Sisario) * AMY WINEHOUSE (Tuesday and Wednesday) The British R&B revivalist of the moment, Ms. Winehouse growls defiant epigrams of debauchery (''They tried to make me go to rehab/I said no, no, no'') over tasty arrangements that, were it not for the whiff of hip-hop in the rhythms, could pass for lost 1960s soul tracks. With Patrick Wolf on Tuesday. At 8 p.m., Highline Ballroom, 431 West 16th Street, Chelsea, (212) 414-5994, highlineballroom.com; sold out.

(Chinen) Classical Full reviews of recent music performances: nytimes.com/music. Opera * 'IL BARBIERE DI SIVIGLIA' (Tomorrow) Bartlett Sher's breezy production of Rossini's ''Barbiere di Siviglia,'' which was introduced in November, conveys the comic confusions of the story through its fluid staging and a wonderfully abstract set: a matrix of movable doors, staircases and potted orange trees, behind which the characters spy on one another. The heated sexuality in this tale of romantic intrigue also comes through strongly, thanks to Mr. Sher's subtle directing of a handsome cast, notably the captivating young mezzo-soprano Joyce DiDonato, a vocally agile and feisty Rosina. Some major changes are coming to the cast, though, for the final performances. The accomplished American tenor Lawrence Brownlee, in his Met debut role, makes a sweet-toned, technically agile and appealing Count Almaviva. The baritone Russell Braun is a hardy and clever Figaro. Maurizio Benini conducts. At 8 p.m., Metropolitan Opera House, Lincoln Center, (212) 362-6000, metopera.org; $220 tickets available. (Anthony Tommasini) LA GRAN SCENA OPERA COMPANY (Tonight and tomorrow night) In the tradition of every great diva who just can't say goodbye to the stage, Mme. Vera Galupe- Borszkh is following last year's 20th annual and absolute last farewell with a return engagement, ''Back by Personal Whim (and Popular Demand).'' Mme. Vera, for the two or three opera lovers in New York still unfamiliar with her name, is a creation of the brilliant Ira Siff, who skewers opera and its mores as only one steeped in it can. Madame's recitals are a combination of stand-up comedy and ''Vissi d'arte,'' and have been shown to be suitable even for nonopera fans -- if they can get tickets. At 8, Thalia at Symphony Space, 2537 Broadway, at 95th Street, (212) 864-5400, granscena.org; $33. (Anne Midgette) * 'IL TRITTICO' (Tonight, Monday and Thursday) The Met's new ''Trittico,'' Puccini's triptych of one-act operas, is now the most elaborate production in the company's repertory. The director Jack O'Brien has created grandly old-fashioned yet insightful and effective stagings of these three very different operas: ''Il Tabarro,'' a grim love triangle aboard a barge in Paris; ''Suor Angelica,'' a tender, mystical and ultimately devastating story of a young nun's yearning to be with her dead child; and ''Gianni Schicchi,'' an irreverent comedy about the avaricious relatives of a miserly old man who has just died. The earthy soprano Maria Guleghina as the beleaguered barge-owner's wife, the impassioned soprano Barbara Frittoli as Sister Angelica and the stylish baritone Alessandro Corbelli as the shrewd Schicchi are standouts, though the powerhouse mezzo-soprano Stephanie Blythe almost steals each show playing three supporting roles. James Levine conducts vibrant and beautifully refined performances. Tonight at 8, Monday and Thursday at 7:30 p.m., Metropolitan Opera House, Lincoln Center, (212) 362-6000, metopera.org; $205 tickets available tonight; $175 for Monday and Thursday. (Tommasini) 'TURANDOT' (Tuesday) Franco Zeffirelli's extravagant take on a Puccini fantasy of Far Eastern bloodthirstiness and lust helps wind down the Met's season. Erika Sunnegardh continues in the title role. At 7:30 p.m., Metropolitan Opera House, Lincoln Center, (212) 362-6000, metopera.org; $175 tickets remaining. (Bernard Holland) Classical Music * PIERRE-LAURENT AIMARD (Thursday) During his Perspectives series at Carnegie Hall this season, this astounding French pianist has revealed himself to be a fascinating concert programmer and astute music historian. The next-to-last of his Perspectives concerts, called ''Programming Games,'' offers an eclectic evening of 20th-century works for piano and percussion by Ligeti, Peter Eotvos and Gyorgy Kurtag, culminating in Bartok's exciting Sonata for Two Pianos and Percussion. You can be sure that Mr. Aimard will have an intriguing explanation for having included Steve Reich's ''Clapping Music'' in the mix. At 7:30 p.m., Zankel Hall, Carnegie Hall, (212) 247-7800, carnegiehall.org; sold out. (Tommasini) AMERICAN COMPOSERS ORCHESTRA (Tuesday and Wednesday) Composers, especially young ones, have too few chances to hear their new orchestral works performed. Part concert, part service, part competition, this orchestra's annual new-music readings address the gap, selecting nine composers (from 150 submissions this year) to receive feedback from mentor composers and conductors. One of the nine will win a $15,000 prize and an official premiere at an American Composers Orchestra concert; all will hear their music performed by a professional orchestra -- a prize in itself. At 10 a.m., Skirball Center for the Performing Arts, 566 LaGuardia Place, at Washington Square South, Greenwich Village, (212) 977-8495, americancomposers.org; free. (Midgette) AMERICAN MODERN ENSEMBLE (Tonight and tomorrow) This ensemble of experienced new-music performers, conducted by Robert Paterson, offers works by Chen Yi and Zhou Long, both from China, who draw on Chinese and Western sounds and structures in their music. (They are also married.) The first half of the program includes Ms. Chen's ''Sparkle,'' ''Chinese Ancient Dances,'' ''Near Distance'' and ''Blue Dragon Sword Dance.'' The second part is devoted to Mr. Zhou's ''Dhyana'' and ''Metal, Stone, Silk, Bamboo.'' The composers will be interviewed during the intermission. At 8 p.m., Tenri Cultural Institute, 43A West 13th Street, Greenwich Village, (212) 645-2000, americanmodernensemble.org; $20; $15 for students and 65+. (Allan Kozinn) CONCERTANTE (Sunday) This vibrant string sextet will play Mozart's String Quintet in G minor (K. 516) and Strauss's ''Metamorphosen'' (the version for string sextet). The ensemble, which champions new music, also offers a new piece by Jonathan Leshnoff. At 3 p.m., Merkin Concert Hall, 129 West 67th Street, Manhattan, (212) 501-3330, kaufman-center.org; $20. (Vivien Schweitzer) MATTHIAS GOERNE AND CHRISTOPH ESCHENBACH (Monday) Call it the Fischer-Dieskau effect: Germany has produced a whole crop of fine baritones, and one of the finest is Matthias Goerne, with a dark, full voice; a slightly distracting penchant for onstage gesticulation; and a constant search for artistic stimulation that will push him to extend his artistic horizons. Christoph Eschenbach, moving off the podium and taking his place as accompanist, joins him for a concert of Schumann (including the Op. 24 ''Liederkreis'') and Brahms (including ''Vier Ernste Gesänge,'' a wrenching set to which Mr. Goerne should do full justice). At 8 p.m., Carnegie Hall, (212) 247-7800, carnegiehall.org; $23 to $72. (Midgette) INTERPRETATIONS (Thursday) To celebrate the composer Chinary Ung's 65th birthday, several ensembles and soloists -- Antares, the Brentano String Quartet, the cellist Maya Beiser, the percussionist Steven Schick and the baritone Thomas Buckner -- are joining forces to play some of his music. The program also includes works by Koji Nakano, Hi Kyung Kim, Kee-Young Chong and Chou Wen-Chung. At 8 p.m., Asia Society, 725 Park Avenue, at 70th Street, (212) 517-2742 or (212) 545-7536, asiasociety.org; $20. (Kozinn) ALEXANDER LONQUICH (Thursday) This German pianist returns to the 92nd Street Y, where he made his New York debut in March 2006, with Schumann's Fantasiestücke, and selections from ''Album for the Young.'' He will be joined by Cristina Barbuti for Schumann's ''12 Pieces for Piano Four Hands for Children Small and Large,'' and Brahms's Variations on a Theme by Schumann for Piano Four Hands. At 8 p.m., 1395 Lexington Avenue, (212) 415-5500, 92y.org; $40. (Schweitzer) * ORPHEUS CHAMBER ORCHESTRA (Tomorrow) The young Dutch violinist Janine Jansen made her New York debut at an Orpheus concert at the start of this season, and gave high-energy performances of Vivaldi's ''Four Seasons,'' which was also the subject of her first recording. Now she has released a second CD with the Mendelssohn Concerto as its centerpiece, and is returning to play that work with Orpheus as well. The program also includes Poul Ruders's ''Credo'' and ''Trapeze,'' and Schumann's Symphony No. 2. At 8 p.m., Carnegie Hall, (212) 247-7800, carnegiehall.org; $30 to $98. (Kozinn) * JORDI SAVALL (Wednesday and Thursday) This Spanish master of the viola da gamba has become a favorite of New York early-music audiences, both as a soloist and as the leader of his three period-instrument ensembles. This time he is playing two gamba recitals, with Pierre Hantaï, a harpsichordist; and Xavier Díaz, a lutenist. The first program, ''Folias and Romanescas,'' includes works by Ortiz, Murcia, Sanz and Hume. The second is devoted to music of the French court, with works by Marais, Couperin and others. At 8 p.m., Metropolitan Museum of Art, (212) 570-3949, metmuseum.org; $55; $100 for both concerts.

At 8, Symphony Space, 2537 Broadway, at 95th Street, (212) 864-5400, symphonyspace.org; $18 to $38; $12 to $32 for students and 65+.

(Dunning) CHAMECKILERNER (Tonight and tomorrow night) Rosane Chamecki and Andrea Lerner, both originally from Brazil, are known for their dark, exaggerated and often raw depictions of human behavior. In their new multimedia ''EXIT,'' they create a funeral rite for themselves in which they watch from the afterlife while colleagues offer eulogies and flashbacks. At 8:30, the Kitchen, 512 West 19th Street, Chelsea, (212) 255-5793, Ext. 11, thekitchen.org; $10. (Dunning) NORA CHIPAUMIRE (Tonight) This is the second and last performance of ''push/pull theories'' by Ms. Chipaumire, a Zimbabwean dancer, and the choreographer and writer/director Linnet Taylor. Ms Chipaumire is a powerful performer whose work explores her experience as an immigrant and her relationship to her history and country. At 7:30, Dance Theater Workshop, 219 West 19th Street, Chelsea, (212) 924-0077, dtw.org; free.

(Dunning) ANDRé GINGRAS/KORZO PRODUCTIES (Tonight and tomorrow night) From the Netherlands, Mr. Gingras and his company will present ''CYP17,'' a mixed-media piece that aims to present ''the 'freak show' that is our future,'' as its publicity puts it. Rock on. At 8:30, Danspace Project, St. Mark's Church, 131 East 10th Street, East Village, (212) 674-8194, danspaceproject.org; $15.

They are Aaron Draper's AnD Dance, nathantrice/RITUALS, Jeffrey Peterson Dance, Cosmo Scharf (in collaboration with Larry Keigwin and Young Dance Collective), Brian Brooks and dre.dance, directed by Taye Diggs (yes, the actor) and Andrew Palermo. (Through May 13.) Tonight and tomorrow night at 8, Sunday at 3 p.m., Thursday at 8 p.m., Dance New Amsterdam, 280 Broadway, at Chambers Street, TriBeCa, (212) 279-4200, dnadance.org; $25. (Dunning) JOYCE SOHO PRESENTS (Tonight, tomorrow night and Thursday night) This is the first of a three-part series offering four emerging groups each week. This weekend features Sidra Bell Dance New York, Oni Dance, Gallim Dance Group/Andrea Miller and Dorian Nuskind-Oder. Week 2 performances begin on Thursday, with fivefour/Cortney McGuire and Leah Nelson, Cherylyn Lavagnino Dance, Katie Martin and Katy Orthwein. At 8, Joyce Soho, 155 Mercer Street, (212) 352-3101, or (866) 811-4111; $15; $12 for students and 65+; $35 for a three-weekend pass. (Sulcas) ALONZO KING'S LINES BALLET (Tonight through Sunday) This San Francisco company dances ballet with an unusually streamlined and extra-active body line and attack. Mr. King's new ''Moroccan Project'' is set to African drumming and oud and violin music. His ''Migration,'' also new, will be danced to music by Pharoah Sanders, Miguel Frasconi and Leslie Stuck. Tonight and tomorrow night at 8, Sunday at 2 and 7:30 p.m., Joyce Theater, 175 Eighth Avenue, at 19th Street, Chelsea, (212) 242-0800, joyce.org; $40. (Dunning) LA MAMA MOVES! (Tonight through Sunday night) This modern-dance version of a three-ring circus spills out into three theater spaces at La MaMa, with nine programs featuring more than 50 companies and soloists. (Through May 13.) At 7:30 p.m., La MaMa E.T.C., 74A East Fourth Street, East Village, (212) 475-7710, lamama.org; $15. (Dunning) MONEY OF THE MONTH CLUB (Tonight and tomorrow night) We're not quite sure what this is all about, but it sounds as if it lives up to the Dixon Place standard of the cozily bizarre. At 8, Dixon Place, 258 Bowery, between Houston and Prince Streets, Lower East Side, (212) 219-0736, dixonplace.org; $12; $10 students and 65+. (Dunning) * NEW YORK CITY BALLET (Tonight through Sunday, and Tuesday through Thursday) The new production of ''Romeo and Juliet'' by the company director, Peter Martins, continues. The doomed young lovers will be danced by Sterling Hyltin and Robert Fairchild (tonight, tomorrow night and Tuesday); Tiler Peck and Sean Suozzi (tomorrow afternoon and Thursday); Erica Pereira and Allen Peiffer (Sunday); and Kathryn Morgan and Seth Orza (Wednesday). (Through May 13.) Tonight at 8, tomorrow at 2 and 8 p.m., Sunday at 3 p.m., Tuesday and Wednesday at 7:30 p.m., Thursday at 8 p.m., New York State Theater, Lincoln Center, (212) 870-5570, nycballet.com; $15 to $86. (Dunning) DAVID PARKER AND THE BANG GROUP (Tuesday through Thursday) The members of Mr. Parker's troupe use their bodies as instruments -- literally -- creating a percussive score as they dance. His new ''Hour Upon the Stage'' is likely to offer the eccentric comedy that Mr. Parker specializes in, or as press materials put it, a ''ribald approach to gender and sexuality.'' On Tuesday there will be a preshow talk at 6.30 p.m. (Through May 12.) At 7.30 p.m., Dance Theater Workshop, 219 West 19th Street, Chelsea, (212) 924-0077, dtw.org; $25; $15 for students, 65+ and artists. (Sulcas) RAGAMALA MUSIC AND DANCE THEATER (Tonight through Sunday, and Thursday) From Minneapolis, the company mixes Indian Bharatanatyam dance with contemporary movement, Japanese taiko drums and a capella singing. (Through May 13.) Tonight at 7, tomorrow at 2 and 7 p.m., Sunday at noon and 5 p.m., Thursday at 7 p.m., New Victory Theater, 209 West 42nd Street, Manhattan, (212) 239-6200, newvictory.org; $12.50 to $35. (Dunning) SKOVE WORKS (Thursday) Lily Skove and her modern-dance company will present ''SPLIT,'' a collaboration with the lighting designer T J Hellmuth that plays with hidden and obstructed perspectives in shadowy spaces that might be rooms in a house. And this mustily idiosyncratic performing space would seem the ideal setting. (Through May 12.) At 8 p.m., the Chocolate Factory, 5-49 49th Avenue, Long Island City, Queens, (212) 352-3101, chocolatefactorytheater.org; $15. (Dunning) * URBAN BUSH WOMEN (Tuesday through Thursday) Jawole Willa Jo Zollar's ''Walking With Pearl: Africa Diaries'' and ''Walking With Pearl: Southern Diaries,'' works based on the travel diaries of the modern-dance pioneer Pear Primus, are the linchpins of the two programs at the Joyce offered by this dynamic company. There are other draws, however: a new work by Camille A. Brown, one of the most promising young choreographers around, and a restaging of Blondell Cummings's ''Chicken Soup.'' (Through May 13.) Tuesday and Wednesday at 7.30 p.m., Thursday at 8 p.m., Joyce Theater, 175 Eighth Avenue, at 19th Street, Chelsea, (212) 242-0800, joyce.org; $36. (Sulcas) Art Museums and galleries are in Manhattan unless otherwise noted. Full reviews of recent art shows: nytimes.com/art. Museums * AMERICAN FOLK ART MUSEUM: MARTíN RAMíREZ, through May 13. Ramírez, a Mexican peasant who immigrated to Northern California and died there at 68 in 1963, spent the last 32 years of his life in a mental hospital, making some of the greatest art of the last century. He had his own way with materials and color, and an unforgettable cast of characters. But most of all, Ramírez had his own brand of pictorial space, established by rhythmic systems of parallel lines, both curved and straight, whose mesmerizing expansions and contractions simultaneously cosset and isolate his figures. In addition to being one of the season's best exhibitions and the first of his work in a New York museum, this show should render null and void the distinction between insider and outsider art. 45 West 53rd Street, (212) 265-1040, folkartmuseum.org. (Roberta Smith) BROOKLYN MUSEUM: 'KINDRED SPIRITS: ASHER B. DURAND AND THE AMERICAN LANDSCAPE,' through July 29. This show of about 60 works by one of the greats of 19th-century American landscape painting has as its centerpiece ''Kindred Spirits'' (1849), a tribute to the landscapist Thomas Cole and his friend the poet-journalist William Cullen Bryant. A founder of the Hudson River School, Durand (1796-1886) favored the realistic approach to landscape advocated by the English critic John Ruskin. Durand explored forest interiors with close attention to the ways of trees, foliage and rocks and ground cover in smaller works, while his larger and more elaborate exhibition pictures, influenced by European masters, are Arcadian visions suffused with light, color and atmospheric perspective. The show reveals Durand's strong sense of artistic mission and his potent role in shaping the aesthetic of 19th-century America. 200 Eastern Parkway, at Prospect Park, Brooklyn, (718) 638-5000, brooklynmuseum.org. (Grace Glueck) GREY ART GALLERY: 'BEYOND THE WHITE CUBE: A RETROSPECTIVE OF BRIAN O'DOHERTY/PATRICK IRELAND,' through July 14. Starting in the mid-1960s and in concert with the most influential thinkers of the period (Roland Barthes, Marcel Duchamp and Susan Sontag), Brian O'Doherty made Conceptual art in a Minimalist vein. This show displays his sculptures, drawings, performance videos, paintings and rope drawings, which could easily be called installations. It's a must-see show for anyone who wants to understand the conceptual frameworks that underpin so much of today's most significant installation and performance art. 100 Washington Square East, Greenwich Village, (212) 998-6780, nyu.edu/greyart/. (Bridget L. Goodbody) GUGGENHEIM MUSEUM: 'DIVISIONISM/NEO-IMPRESSIONISM: ARCADIA AND ANARCHY,' through Aug. 6. Ultimately this rare, compressed, mercurial exhibition of work by the Italian Divisionists of the 1890s is long on history and short on truly convincing paintings. The inclusion of works by Seurat and his French, Dutch and Belgian followers clarifies how the Italians pushed Pointillism, Seurat's invention, in all directions: toward realism, academic classicism, Symbolism, class consciousness and even Impressionism. The show opens a new, albeit small, window on the genesis of Modernism beyond the French canon. If many of the works are period pieces, they are also immensely appealing, big-hearted and physically robust period pieces. Guggenheim Museum, 1071 Fifth Avenue, at 88th Street, (212) 423-3500. (Smith) * JAPAN SOCIETY: 'AWAKENINGS: ZEN FIGURE PAINTING IN MEDIEVAL JAPAN,' through June 17. Japan Society has a history of producing exquisite shows of Buddhist art. And this one, with four dozen paintings of Buddhists gods and saints hung in shrinelike alcoves, is transporting. It covers a broad swath of geography, bringing together 13th- to 16th-century hanging scrolls, not only from Japan but also from China, where Zen Buddhism, called Chan in Chinese, originated. 333 East 47th Street, (212) 832-1155, japansociety.org. (Holland Cotter) THE JEWISH MUSEUM: DATELINE: ISRAEL: 'NEW PHOTOGRAPHY AND VIDEO ART,' through Aug. 5. Roughly every decade, the Jewish Museum offers a survey of contemporary art from and about Israel. This year non-Israeli artists from Europe and the United States -- and a single artist from Palestine -- have been added to the mix. There's some very good work here, though, on the whole, the show grapples with crucial political issues in an indirect way. 1109 Fifth Avenue, at 92nd Street, (212) 423-3200, jewishmuseum.org. (Cotter) * THE METROPOLITAN MUSEUM OF ART: 'JOURNEYS: MAPPING THE EARTH AND MIND IN CHINESE ART,' through Aug. 26. Every six months or so, the Met rotates all the work in its Chinese painting galleries to preserve the delicate silks and papers, and each time, the curator in charge, Maxwell K. Hearn, produces a new and illuminating thematic exhibition, as is the case with ''Journeys.'' Outward-bound and inward-bound are the directions taken by Chinese landscape painting, and it carries us on some fascinating voyages in a show that mixes classical and contemporary art. (212) 535-7710, metmuseum.org. (Cotter) * THE MET: 'VENICE AND THE ISLAMIC WORLD, 828-1797,' through July 8. At its peak in the Renaissance, Venice was a giant, clamorous Costco-on-the-Rialto. All the necessities, and most of the luxuries, of life flowed into and through it, with many items arriving from Islamic Africa and the Near East. With classic Met largesse, this exhibition suggests the spectacle of two different cultures meeting in one fantastic city, in which commerce and love of beauty, those great levelers, unite them in a fruitful bond. (See above.) (Cotter) MORGAN LIBRARY & MUSEUM: 'APOCALYPSE THEN: MEDIEVAL ILLUMINATIONS FROM THE MORGAN,' through June 17. Even in the contemporary art world the symbolism of the Book of Revelation has a subversive appeal. This new exhibition at the Morgan Library celebrates a facsimile of ''Las Huelgas Apocalypse'' (1220), the largest surviving Spanish illuminated commentary on the Apocalypse. The show, which includes 50 leaves from the original text, unbound and installed around the gallery's perimeter, offers a walking tour of the medieval imagination. 225 Madison Avenue, at 36th Street, (212) 685-0008, morganlibrary.org. (Andrea K. Scott) * THE MUSEUM OF MODERN ART: JEFF WALL, through May 14. This majestic show makes a great case for Mr. Wall as the most complete, if traditional, of the untraditional artists who emerged from the turmoil of Conceptual Art. His often immense color transparencies mounted on light boxes are enthralling visual vehicles, intent on giving pleasure while making a point or two about society, art, history, visual perception, the human animal or all of the above. An imposing blend of painting, street photography and movies, they blur reality and artifice, narrative and form, detail and the big statement. You can't stop looking at them. (212) 708-9400, moma.org. (Smith) * NEUE GALERIE: 'VAN GOGH AND EXPRESSIONISM,' through July 2. The Neue has, as usual, gathered a stellar roundup of Expressionist art. In one of the show's most exciting rooms, a third-floor gallery devoted mostly to self-portraits, two extraordinary van Goghs hang at opposite ends: ''Self-Portrait With Straw Hat'' (1887-88), from the Metropolitan Museum's collection, filled with energetic, radiating brushstrokes, and the National Gallery's vibrant self-portrait of the artist holding a palette and brushes, painted about a year later. The most compelling pairing in this room, though, is van Gogh's ''Bedroom'' from 1889, the second of three versions he painted of his room in Arles, with Egon Schiele's obvious homage, ''The Artist's Bedroom in Neulengbach,'' painted in 1911, in a darker palette and with a perspective tipped precariously toward the viewer. 1048 Fifth Avenue, at 86th Street, (212) 628-6200, neuegalerie.org. (Martha Schwendener) THE STUDIO MUSEUM IN HARLEM: 'PHILOSOPHY OF TIME TRAVEL,' through July 1. This flawed show, which was created by a group of artists who studied together at the California Institute of the Arts, is nonetheless an interesting example of one of the art world's latest trends: the art collective. It takes Brancusi's ''Endless Column'' as its point of departure and reimagines this Modernist icon from the point of view of art school grads, who are versed in the language of artspeak and wed to the righteous cause of freedom of expression. 144 West 125th Street, (212) 864-4500, studiomuseum.org. (Goodbody) WHITNEY MUSEUM OF AMERICAN ART: 'GORDON MATTA-CLARK RETROSPECTIVE,' through June 3. I have no doubt that Matta-Clark is now being turned into a hot commercial commodity, but at least at the Whitney you can see what he aspired to be. He came up with various wonderfully harebrained ideas. Literally, in one case: after letting his hair grow for a year, he cut it off as a kind of performance and phrenological gag. The preserved hair, dutifully tagged piece by piece, opens the show like a holy relic. At the center of the exhibition is ''Splitting.'' To a plain single-family suburban frame house in Englewood, N.J., he made a cut straight down the middle, bisecting the building, then severing the four corners of the roof. The retrospective consists of films, drawings, photographs and some of the architectural pieces he cut out of buildings. The drawings are casual and not too interesting, but the luxurious black-and-white photographs from Paris speak more to Matta-Clark's formal elegance. The big message was: Life as art, and art as life, a philosophy dependent on our being properly attuned and keen to the moment. (212) 570-3676, whitney.org. (Michael Kimmelman) WHITNEY MUSEUM OF AMERICAN ART: 'TARYN SIMON,' through June 24. Ms. Simon couches the show in the intellectual, power-to-the-people oratory of leftist politics, yet she clearly delights in exposing, in a quasi-tabloid fashion, America's underbelly. Though she has also worked in war-torn areas, Ms. Simon is best known for ''The Innocents,'' a series of portraits of men and women who were wrongly convicted but later cleared by DNA test results. Ms. Simon can work as long as a year to gain permission to photograph high-security zones like the government-regulated quarantine sites, nuclear waste storage facilities, prison death rows and C.I.A. offices on view in the show. There are also pictures with lighter themes: the sandpit where the Grucci family tests fireworks, ski slopes being dynamited for avalanche control and the second Death Star, from ''Return of the Jedi,'' at George Lucas's Skywalker Ranch. Ms. Simon is at her artistic best when her delight in the strangeness of American culture shines. (See above.) (Goodbody) Galleries: Uptown * RICHARD OELZE: PAINTINGS AND DRAWINGS FROM THE 1950s & 1960s Nearly two dozen paintings in the first United States show of this little-known German Surrealist introduce an introvert with a penchant for grisaille grottolike structures that seem built on air, and for soft, fleshy forms that sometimes have eyes or reveal hidden faces or figures. Max Ernst is a big influence, and Pavel Tchelitchew an obvious analogy, but the exquisite rendering and pervasive unquiet are Oelze's alone. Ubu Gallery, 416 East 59th Street, (212) 753-4444, through May 12. (Smith) Galleries: 57th Street * KATHY BUTTERLY: BETWEEN A ROCK AND A SOFT PLACE Although she is a little off her game here, this extraordinarily talented ceramic sculptor continues to impress with exquisitely detailed, radiantly colored, art historically aware, discreetly lascivious little pieces, especially if you have never seen her work before. Still, the question of whether it isn't time for a change hangs over the proceedings. Tibor deNagy Gallery, 724 Fifth Avenue, (212) 262-5050, through May 19. (Smith) Galleries: SoHo * 'GEGO, BETWEEN TRANSPARENCY AND THE INVISIBLE' The artist named Gego was born Gertrud Goldschmidt in Germany in 1912, but lived most of her life in Venezuela, where she produced netlike drawings in ink and watercolor and what she called ''drawings without paper'': semi-geometric, see-through, two- and three-dimensional pieces of twisted and knotted wires, suspended in space. Whether you think of them as grids gone haywire or as rational forms charged with emotion, they're out of this world, and this survey gives a sense of what is distinctive and radical about Gego's art. The Drawing Center, 35 Wooster Street, Soho, (212) 219-2166, drawingcenter.org, through July 21. (Cotter) Galleries: Chelsea * 'PRIME TIME: MICKALENE THOMAS AND SHINIQUE SMITH' A sparkling double-header by two very different artists with much in common. In paintings encrusted with rhinestones, Ms. Thomas gives 1970s pin-up portraits of African-American women the shimmer of Byzantine mosaics. Ms. Smith turns bundles of cast-off clothes into floral bouquets of exotic patterning. Caren Golden Fine Art, 539 West 23rd Street, (212) 727-8304, carengoldenfineart.com, through May 12. (Cotter) Galleries: Other * SOL LEWITT: DRAWING SERIES If the greatness of Sol LeWitt, the Minimal-Conceptual artist who died in April at 78, has so far escaped you, this show of 14 of his mind-teasing, eye-filling wall drawings from the late 1960s and early '70s may do the trick. Selected and arranged by the artist, they proceed in carefully sequenced contrasts and echoes that are both insightful and idiosyncratic. Since their generating instructions are part of their titles, they reduce the creative process to a short, highly visible straight line. But their crisp geometries, accumulating marks and radiating patterns force us to mind the gap between artistic thought and artistic action, to experience the inability of language to account fully for visual outcome. Dia:Beacon, 3 Beekman Street, Beacon, N.Y., (845) 440-0100, through Sept. 10. (Smith) * LILY LUDLOW Best known as a designer for Imitation of Christ and Somnus, Ms. Ludlow offers a handful of draftsmanly paintings for this solo show. Done on faint dark lines on a white ground, each group picture presents nude, semi-classical figures entangled in what appear to be ethereal, sadistic ballets. Canada, 55 Chrystie Street, Chinatown, (212) 925-4631, canadanewyork. com, through May 13. (Cotter) Last Chance DELPHINE COURTILLOT From O. Winston Link to Anna Gaskell and ''The Blair Witch Project,'' there are far too many borrowed bits in these large watercolors based on staged photographs of people in dark, desolate landscapes. But the larger question is why the images wouldn't do just as well in their original photographic form. Tilton Gallery, 8 East 76th Street, (212) 731-2221, jacktiltongallery.com; closes tomorrow.(Smith) * WALTER DE MARIA Counting and space -- important to both Minimal and Conceptual Art -- come together with unusual clarity, if a bit too much in the way of gleaming metal, in two large installations by the creator of ''The Lightning Field'' earthwork. Both pieces consist of several dozen shiny, meter-long stainless-steel rods presented in spaces that couldn't be much more pristine. Experience the spatial levitation and note the number of sides on the rods; in both cases, they increase row by row. Gagosian Gallery, 522 West 21st Street, Chelsea, (212) 741-1717, and 555 West 24th Street, Chelsea, (212) 741-1111, gagosian.com; closes tomorrow. (Smith) * JONATHAN LASKER One of the tortoises of '80s painting, this artist has cultivated his narrow abstract vocabulary without painting himself into a corner, and this latest show is one of his best. The usual asides to the history of abstract painting continue, as does the almost garish postmodern style, but there is more coherence in both single works and the group. Perhaps this is because Mr. Lasker's hand and brush have always stayed in the picture, subverting yet partaking of traditional touch and surface. Cheim & Read, 547 West 25th Street, (212) 242-7737; closes tomorrow. (Smith) ORLY GENGER: MASSSPEAK More than three tons of nylon climbing rope knotted into mats and arranged in mounds that sometimes touch the ceiling add to the tradition of filling gallery space with unusual quantities of just one thing for an effect that is at once dour and hilarious, like a playground designed by a Welsh miner. Larissa Goldston, 530 West 25th Street, Chelsea, (212) 206-7887, larissagoldston.com; closes tomorrow. (Smith) * JONATHAN MONK: 'SOME KIND OF GAME BETWEEN THIS AND THAT' As usual, this Conceptually inclined Scottish artist concentrates on sly tributes to, or plays on, works by other artists, among them Bruce Nauman, Chris Burden, John Baldessari and René Magritte. The slightest pieces are best, including drawings done on old books and ''The Cheat,'' in which ''this'' and ''that'' consist of an early silent film accompanied by a boom box tuned to a classical music station. Casey Kaplan, 525 West 21st Street, Chelsea, (212) 645-7335, caseykaplangallery.com; closes tomorrow. (Smith * MAY STEVENS: 'ASHES ROCK SNOW WATER' The outstanding piece in this beautiful show of recent work is a mural-size painting of eddying water, the surface flecked with glinting bits of mica and amber, as if spirits were moving beneath the turbulence. Mary Ryan Gallery, 527 West 56th Street, (212) 397-0669; closes tomorrow. (Cotter) * TEMPORARY SERVICES: 'GROUP WORK' Temporary Services, an inventive Chicago-based artists' collective, was given the run of Printed Matter's archives and came up with a fascinating selection of collectively published materials covering several decades. In addition, the group has installed a photographic installation that touches on the many things that ''group'' may mean, from Apostles, to Immigrants, to Upper Class. Printed Matter Inc., 195 10th Avenue, at 22nd Street, Chelsea, (212) 925-0325; closes tomorrow. (Cotter) * WHITNEY MUSEUM OF AMERICAN ART: 'LORNA SIMPSON' This tight, refined and impassioned survey covers more than 20 years of Lorna Simpson's career, from her photo-and-text meditations on race and sexism in the 1980s, to her more recent short films, which unite American history and personal history in forceful and lyrical ways. It would be easy to put some of this work on a shelf as ''identity art,'' but with an African-American woman holding one of the highest offices in the United States government, an African-American man running for president, and the nation embroiled in what some people view as an ethnic war, this art is entirely of the moment.

2007-05-04T00:00:00Z,"RICHARDSON--Berry Delahanty, passed away peacefully in Brewster, MA, after a long illness. For over 60 years, she led the Cape Cod Sea Camps, founded by her parents in 1922, as Camps Monomoy and Wono. In the mid-1970s, she combined the two camps into the co-educational Cape Cod Sea Camps and increased day camp offerings of The Monomoy Day Camp. She was a leader in The American Camp Association (ACA) and an early proponent of camp standards. She was a graduate of Skidmore College. She was predeceased by her younger son, James E. Richardson, and her grandson, James R. Richardson. She is survived by her elder son, Robert B. Richardson of Los Angeles, loving family, and generations of campers. Funeral is private. A memorial service will be scheduled this summer. Donations may be made to Grant W. Koch Scholarship Fund, P.O. Box 1404, Brewster, MA 02631."

2007-05-04T00:00:00Z,"To the Editor: In ''Gold Stars and Dunce Caps'' (column, May 1), Nicholas D. Kristof makes a crucial point about the importance of decent teachers. Bonuses for capable, caring teachers willing to teach poor children would certainly begin to redress some of the truly grotesque imbalances in schools.

2007-05-04T00:00:00Z,"May is bike month in New York, and it is a measure of how popular cycling has become that, for the first time, spots at the annual Commerce Bank Five Boro Bike Tour, above, on Sunday morning, sold out in advance. ''We had an unprecedented response rate,'' said Hannah Borgeson, the communications director for Bike New York, the event's organizer. You can line up along the route to cheer for the 32,000 riders, whose 42-mile trip will start in Battery Park and end with a festival at Fort Wadsworth on Staten Island. Or you can view ''Why I Ride,'' an exhibition that continues through June 3. More than a dozen painters, photographers, sculptors and installation artists contributed pieces devoted to ''the art of bicycling in New York,'' said Carol A. Wood, a curator. Among the featured work is a history of the Critical Mass ride, Amy Bolger's photos of illegal messenger races, and a mural devoted to the ''Ghost Bikes'' project, which commemorates riders killed by automobiles. ''People tend to think of cyclists as being in these little niches,'' Ms. Wood said. ''But we have one thing in common, that whatever else we do, we want to ride our bikes in the city and not get injured.'' An essay series also explores how people manage to find some joy as they dodge potholes, pedestrians and taxis. ''It can be very challenging to ride in the city, but at the same time very rewarding,'' Ms. Wood said. ''It is really an ideal city for bike riding -- if the streets were clear, you could get from one end of Manhattan to another in about 20 minutes. Big if.''

2007-05-04T00:00:00Z,"When the names of major Hollywood filmmakers of the 1970s are recited, that of Paul Mazursky, a warm-hearted observer of the human comedy, is too frequently passed over. The movies by this satirist of modern American foibles offer a sympathetic vision of naïve middle-class seekers of truth who embrace the human potential movement, feminism, the sexual revolution and New Age therapies with a touching faith that transcendence is possible. Their discomforts are merely growing pains on the bumpy path toward self-realization. From today through Thursday the Film Society of Lincoln Center is presenting the first major retrospective of his films, beginning with his 1969 debut, ''Bob & Carol & Ted & Alice'' (followed tonight by a question-and-answer session with Mr. Mazursky). It ends with the New York premiere of ''Yippee: A Journey to Jewish Joy,'' a personal documentary that follows him to Uman, a small town in Ukraine."

2007-05-04T00:00:00Z,"For years now there's been chatter about breaking down the audience-performance boundary. At more theaters than not, it remains firmly intact. But the Bronx Academy of Art & Dance (known as BAAD!), founded by the writer Charles Rice-Gonzalez and the dancer-choreographer Arthur Aviles, is not one of those theaters. No matter the content onstage, BAAD! feels firmly rooted in its South Bronx neighborhood, Hunts Point, from the organization's homey feel (it's as though you've wandered into a strange but alluring living room) to the great efforts its members go to to involve community members. This weekend is the start of the academy's annual Boogie Down Dance Series, which includes a show organized by the choreographer Bill T. Jones, for whom Mr. Aviles used to dance, and will culminate in several concerts celebrating the 10th anniversary season of Arthur Aviles Typical Theater. But first, tomorrow, comes ''Checking In to Outer/Space,'' an evening of dance by Isabella Bruno, Susan Hefner, Mark Lonergan and Christopher Morgan, above. The four choreographers are part of Dance Theater Workshop's Outer/Space residency program, which awards 50 hours of free rehearsal space to choreographers at studios outside Manhattan. BAAD! was one of three studios chosen for the program's inaugural year, and ''Checking In'' offers a chance to see what these independent choreographers made of their time in Hunts Point, and it gives you a good excuse to head up there yourself.

The film charts one woman's journey from dronelike suburban mom and fast-food manager to would-be Arctic explorer. It starts when the heroine, Fiona (Ms. Gordon), is trapped in a restaurant freezer overnight and realizes she enjoyed the experience. She subjects herself to increasingly severe endurance tests and becomes obsessed with images of icebergs, even carving one in her freezer at home (like Richard Dreyfuss creating Devils Tower from mashed potatoes in ''Close Encounters of the Third Kind'')."

Luckily, there are plenty of workshops and conferences around to supply it -- and simultaneously offer not only inspiration but practical advice. Usually held in seaside cities and resort towns or on bucolic college campuses, these writers' programs can be found year-round. But the summertime crop takes authors to particularly seductive spots. ''Our location is the key thing that sets us apart,'' said Dorothy Antczak, director of the Fine Arts Work Center Summer Program in Provincetown, Mass., which runs weeklong workshops for poets, memoirists, playwrights and fiction writers (as well as visual artists) from mid-June through August. Daily sessions -- led by writers like the poet Rafael Campo, the novelist Maria Flook and the playwright Wendy Kesselman -- typically end in mid-afternoon. That leaves plenty of time to take inspiration from the Cape Cod National Seashore and the town's literary legacy -- a long line of heavyweights from Norman Mailer and Michael Cunningham to Stanley Kunitz have produced work in Provincetown."

2007-05-04T00:00:00Z,"In a refreshingly direct, unassuming manner, ''Away From Her'' considers two great human mysteries: the persistence of love and the workings of the brain. It takes the twilight of a long, mostly happy marriage as a vantage point from which to look back at youth and forward into the waiting darkness. The first feature written and directed by Sarah Polley, one of the most interesting actresses to come out of Canada in the past decade, the film is by turns sharp and somber, alive to the lacerations of ordinary experience and quietly attentive to grand absurdities and small instances of grace. ''A little bit of grace'' is what Fiona, a slender and elegant woman with Alzheimer's disease, counsels in response to its ravages. And grace is what Julie Christie, who plays Fiona, manifests in every scene, even as Fiona feels the tissue of her self begin to crumble and fade. When we first encounter Fiona and her husband, Grant (Gordon Pinsent), they are living in a roomy old house on the shore of a lake in Ontario. Soft-spoken and gray-haired, they are a picture of marital ease and contentment: sexually fulfilled, easy in each other's company, instinctively choosing kindness over recrimination."

2007-05-05T00:00:00Z,"The government, whose spending on AIDS drugs has skyrocketed as more patients have needed costly, patented medicines, overrode the patent held by the pharmaceutical company Merck on the antiretroviral drug efavirenz. The cost of Merck’s drugs has been $580 annually per patient. Brazil said the company had offered a 30 percent discount, but the government opted instead to buy the generic version from India for less than $170. For years, Brazil has considered exercising its rights under international trade rules to make or import generic versions of patented AIDS drugs, but has until now backed away, fearing trade retaliation from the United States. For more than a decade, Brazil has provided universal free access to drug treatment for people with AIDS. Almost one in four patients in Brazil are now taking efavirenz. With the new price, Brazil estimates that it will save $237 million on efavirenz by 2012 when the patent expires. Thailand, which also has an ambitious AIDS treatment program, overrode Merck’s patent on the same drug in November."

The London judge, Peter Smith, ruled that Mr. Chiluba, in power from 1991 to 2001, &#8220;was uniquely positioned to stop corruption&#8221; in government, but that he elected instead to join in it. Zambia&#8217;s government sued in London because it alleged that Mr. Chiluba and his associates had bought assets in Britain and elsewhere in Europe. Mr. Chiluba said in a statement that he did not recognize a British court&#8217;s authority in Zambian issues, arguing that the case circumvented Zambia&#8217;s justice system. Other African experts said the verdict, the first against a current or former head of state, could set an anticorruption precedent."

2007-05-05T00:00:00Z,"A British judge delivered what some experts called a signal verdict against African corruption, ordering the former Zambian president Frederick Chiluba, left, and 19 others to return at least $46 million it said they had stolen while in power in the 1990s and early this decade. The London judge, Peter Smith, ruled that Mr. Chiluba, in power from 1991 to 2001, ''was uniquely positioned to stop corruption'' in government, but that he elected instead to join in it. Zambia's government sued in London because it alleged that Mr. Chiluba and his associates had bought assets in Britain and elsewhere in Europe. Mr. Chiluba said in a statement that he did not recognize a British court's authority in Zambian issues, arguing that the case circumvented Zambia's justice system. Other African experts said the verdict, the first against a current or former head of state, could set an anticorruption precedent. MICHAEL WINES"

2007-05-05T00:00:00Z,"The government, whose spending on AIDS drugs has skyrocketed as more patients have needed costly, patented medicines, overrode the patent held by the pharmaceutical company Merck on the antiretroviral drug efavirenz. The cost of Merck's drugs has been $580 annually per patient. Brazil said the company had offered a 30 percent discount, but the government opted instead to buy the generic version from India for less than $170. For years, Brazil has considered exercising its rights under international trade rules to make or import generic versions of patented AIDS drugs, but has until now backed away, fearing trade retaliation from the United States. For more than a decade, Brazil has provided universal free access to drug treatment for people with AIDS. Almost one in four patients in Brazil are now taking efavirenz. With the new price, Brazil estimates that it will save $237 million on efavirenz by 2012 when the patent expires. Thailand, which also has an ambitious AIDS treatment program, overrode Merck's patent on the same drug in November. CELIA W. DUGGER"

Actually, just a river. His place is a short walk from San Sebastian’s Old Quarter, on the other side of the Urumea River, in the emerging neighborhood of Gros. Once the province of working families and car-repair shops, Gros has become a draw for locals looking for an alternative to the city’s popular pintxo (tapas) bars. And besides, “everyone knows the best pintxos are in Gros,” says Elizondo, whose txirristra de mar (an architectural concoction of mackerel, vegetables and foie gras) took first prize in the National Tapas Competition in 2006. Around the corner at El Lagar (above), a modern dark-wood-and-chalkboard wine bar, you can have an excellent blood sausage croquette or seared foie gras with a hard-to-find bottle of Aalto from the Ribera del Duero or a Vega Sicilia. When Enrique Garcia Caceres opened El Lagar in 2004, he had in mind a rustic, quiet place. But actually, he helped put Gros on the map.

That's because he has chosen to use his own campaign funds to fight for his agenda in Albany. This is a very unusual step for a governor to take.

2007-05-06T00:00:00Z,"A museum is a perfect place to hear the viola da gamba player JORDI SAVALL. For one thing, his playing has a tactile quality and a rich palette of color. For another, his specialty is delving into music of the past and making it come vividly alive. At the Metropolitan Museum of Art, accompanied by harpsichord and theorbo, he is giving back-to-back concerts in conjunction with the ''Barcelona and Modernity'' show. (He is Spanish.) The first will feature lesser-known works by Ortiz, Murcia and others; the second will focus on Marin Marais, the 17th-century French musician portrayed by Gérard Depardieu in the film ''Tous Les Matins du Monde,'' for which Mr. Savall provided the soundtrack. Wednesday and Thursday at 8 p.m., (212) 570-3949, metmuseum.org; $55, $100 for both concerts. ''Popular virtuoso'' is a technically accurate if slightly misleading term for both Mr. Savall and PIERRE-LAURENT AIMARD, the smart and gifted pianist who has made engaging musical lecture-tours out of several of his solo recitals in his Perspectives series at Carnegie Hall. He has two more this week, studded with short bits of thorny and marvelous repertory (Ligeti, Boulez, Beethoven, Stockhausen): not ''popular'' by most definitions, but the first one is already sold out. Thursday and Friday at 7:30 p.m., Zankel Hall, (212) 247-7800, carnegiehall.org; $40 to $48 (sold out on Thursday). A focus of the new music scene every year is the New York City Opera's estimable VOX program, offering orchestral readings of excerpts from operas in progress by 12 composers. The program sometimes leads to a production with another company. It's also a chance to get a sense of the breadth of what's being written today, as opposed to what ends up being staged.

2007-05-06T00:00:00Z,"''Saturday Night Live'' had a Lazarus-like reincarnation in the 1990s -- fallow years succeeded by great ones -- and you can indulge your nostalgia for them all in '' 'SATURDAY NIGHT LIVE' IN THE '90s: POP CULTURE NATION'' (NBC, Sunday night at 9). This special includes clips from the sketch franchises ''Wayne's World,'' ''Church Chat'' and ''Sprockets,'' as well as interviews with Al Franken, Will Ferrell, Dana Carvey and the show's executive producer, Lorne Michaels, among others. On a distinctly more somber note: IFC will show Eric Steel's chilling documentary ''THE BRIDGE'' (Monday, 11 p.m.). After reading a story in The New Yorker about suicides on the Golden Gate Bridge, Mr. Steel trained his camera on the bridge over a period in 2004 and captured images of people leaping from it. He then tracked down the families and friends of his subjects to try to decipher what activates the suicidal urge. The answers are obvious -- mental illness, severe depression -- but the investigation is harrowing. Another serious documentary effort arrives in the form of ''WHEN KIDS GET LIFE,'' on ''Frontline'' (PBS, Tuesday; check local listings). According to Human Rights Watch, more than 2,000 prisoners in the United States are serving sentences of life without parole for murders committed when they were teenagers. The documentary profiles five such juvenile offenders, including a young man who was 15 when he murdered his mother and stepfather after years of sexual abuse. The flaws of jurisprudence receive dramatic treatment in a new show on BBC America, ''INNOCENT'' (Thursday at 8 p.m.). It focuses on a team of young law students, led by a handsome professor (Lloyd Owen). They grapple with ethics and adulthood as they work to help the wrongly convicted. Think of ''The Paper Chase'' meets the Innocence Project."

2007-05-06T00:00:00Z,"Love is a universal language, at least according to the cockeyed optimists. But what about ambivalence? Is paralyzing romantic two-mindedness -- the kind Stephen Sondheim hymned as the ''God-why-don't-you-love-me-oh-you-do-I'll-see-you-later blues'' -- the same in every culture? Anthropologists in search of answers may want to check out the latest incarnation of the long-running Off Broadway musical ''I LOVE YOU, YOU'RE PERFECT, NOW CHANGE'' at the Westside Theater. Starting Wednesday this popular 11-year-old date show about the mixed blessings of singleness and marriage will be interpreted by a Mandarin-speaking Chinese cast, in alternating performances with the existing English-language production. Like the original ''I Love You,'' this imported version, which recently ended a run in Shanghai, is directed by Joel Bishoff, but it has been jiggered to reflect daily life in metropolitan China. It will be performed with English supertitles and features Lin Yilun, a pop star and television host known as ''the Latin prince of China.'' Through June 3, 407 West 43rd Street, Clinton, (212) 239-6200, telecharge.com; $66 to $100 for the Mandarin show, $75 for the English-speaking cast. A revival of ''BEYOND THERAPY,'' the 1981 CHRISTOPHER DURANG play about neurotics in uncertain pursuit of commitment, makes the case for the theory that semi-love (or is it semi-hate?) goes beyond words. Or spoken words anyway. This take on Mr. Durang's story of a man, a woman, his boyfriend and their crazier-than-thou therapists is presented in American Sign Language by the New York Deaf Theater. Garrett Zuercher directs. Two voice actors will be on hand to interpret for nondeaf audience members. Through May 20, Actors Theater Workshop, 145 West 28th Street, Manhattan, third floor, (212) 868-4444, smarttix.com; $25."

Rushing to California to raise money is not illegal or even uncommon for a New York politician. But Mr. Spitzer's trip came while he has been chastising legislators back home for failing to reform the state's shameful campaign fund-raising system. From Mr. Spitzer's point of view, such fund-raising is crucial to his success as governor today, not his success as a candidate four years from now. That's because he has chosen to use his own campaign funds to fight for his agenda in Albany. This is a very unusual step for a governor to take. But Mr. Spitzer says it is necessary to overcome the well-financed opponents of initiatives he regards as essential."

As someone who has worked with the documents of both countries, I can attest that Washington has never ''de-secretized'' important historical holdings in the first place. Just this week, my appeal for some F.B.I. documents over 60 years old was rejected because they might ''disclose the identities of confidential sources.'' Some questions of United States policy making that will never be resolved by Soviet archives could be answered quite easily with a reasonable relaxation of American rules. I suspect that would be a threat less to our national security than to our national mythology. Peter N. Carroll Belmont, Calif."
2007-05-06T00:00:00Z,"Performances by URBAN BUSH WOMEN, the all-female, mostly black company founded by Jawole Willa Jo Zollar in 1984, can sometimes feel polemical, but the intensity and passion of this dynamic group is always worth returning to. One of the draws of the company's forthcoming season at the Joyce is a new work by the talented and young Camille A. Brown. But it's also worth making a special trip for Ms. Zollar's powerful ''Walking With Pearl: Africa Diaries'' and ''Walking With Pearl: Southern Diaries,'' which both draw from the writings of Pearl Primus, a modern dance pioneer of the 1940s; it's an education and a pleasure all at once. Tuesday and Wednesday at 7:30 p.m., Thursday through Saturday at 8 p.m., 175 Eighth Avenue, at 19th Street, Chelsea, (212) 242-0800, joyce.org; $36. More dance history this week comes courtesy of JODY SPERLING, who has created many pieces based on the work of Loie Fuller, a dancer and actress who in the late 19th and early 20th centuries employed light and costumes of diaphanous silk to create exotic forms and effects. Ms. Sperling's work is an unabashedly contemporary interpretation of the kind of theatrical magic Fuller created, but it conveys the pictorial splendor and theatrical illusionism that delighted audiences of her time. In a brief season at the Baryshnikov Arts Center, Ms. Sperling offers two signature solos and two new works: ''More Cheap Tricks,'' inspired by 19th-century variety shows, and ''Roman Sketches.'' Thursday and Friday at 8 p.m., Saturday at 3 and 8 p.m., 450 West 37th Street, Manhattan, fourth floor, (212) 352-3101, timelapsedance.com; $20, $15 for students and 65+. In an unusual collaboration the WENDY OSSERMAN DANCE COMPANY will dance amid the exhibition ''Fairy Tales,'' a photographic series by MIWA YANAGI at the Chelsea Art Museum. Ms. Osserman's ''Disguised'' will explore themes in Ms. Yanagi's photographs, and the intriguing question of musical and physical responses to visual art will be the subject of a postperformance discussion.

The bond issue, which would allocate up to $175 million a year for the next 10 years, would draw on a fraction of the state sales tax. The money would also help preserve open space, farmlands and historic trusts. The measure was announced on Wednesday in Fairfield, an Essex County community that flooded last month."

Climate change is accelerating, and the prognosis for the region is alarming, as it is for the rest of the world. No matter how effectively we begin to curb our greenhouse-gas emissions now, we are destined to see significant climate changes because these gases remain in the atmosphere for a long time. We cannot delay planning for the environmental and human calamities that lie ahead. All over the world, according to the 2007 scientific report of the United Nations Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, ''it is very likely that hot extremes, heat waves and heavy precipitation events will continue to become more frequent.'' But we need look no further than our own backyard to find evidence of warming.

Now she is about to make her American debut with an indelible performance in ''Trade'' (Sept. 7), as a victim of international sex trafficking. Although the movie's narrative is fiction, it was inspired by ''The Girls Next Door,'' an article by Peter Landesman that appeared in The New York Times Magazine in 2004. ''Trade,'' which stars Kevin Kline, runs on dual narrative tracks that ultimately converge. One concerns the ordeal of Ms. Bachleda-Curus's Veronica, a young mother from Poland, and Paulina Gaitan's Adriana, a 13-year-old Mexican. In the other, Mr. Kline's federal insurance investigator, for reasons of his own, helps Adriana's older brother, played by Cesar Ramos, trace her captors to a house in New Jersey, where her virginity will fetch a high price."

2007-05-06T00:00:00Z,"There are, in my experience, two kinds of cooks: those knowledgeable enough to make it up as they go along, and those who wouldn't dream of setting out without a road map. Sadly, I am among the latter. It's no coincidence that I like to bake: I find precision reassuring. Just give me instructions, and I'll carry them out, to the letter."
2007-05-06T00:00:00Z,"The pioneering Swiss metal band CELTIC FROST is about a quarter-century old, and after decades of splits and revivals and cult adoration it may be more popular than ever -- or in any case more celebrated. Last year Celtic Frost released ''Monotheist'' (Century Media), a savage and spooky album that reminded metal fans how influential this band has been: Scores of face-painted Scandinavian screechers owe it a debt, and so do mainstream goth-rock acts like HIM and Evanescence. (One imagines that many of Celtic Frost's fans in the metal underground would prefer that this last debt remain unrepaid.) On Monday and Tuesday the reinvigorated Celtic Frost comes to the Fillmore New York at Irving Plaza, along with the dark but quirky -- and surprisingly resilient -- band TYPE O NEGATIVE. 8 p.m., 17 Irving Place, at 15th Street, Manhattan, (212) 777-6800; $25. Also this week: the start of the first HIGH LINE FESTIVAL, a music and arts celebration knee-deep in corporate sponsors and organized by David Bowie. The lineup seems an awful lot like business as usual: a few well-established alt-rock bands -- this week the headliners are ARCADE FIRE, AIR and THE POLYPHONIC SPREE -- playing big rooms. (How is this different from any other week in New York? Why is the booking so conservative? And didn't the smiley faux-gospel singers in the Polyphonic Spree wear out their welcome years ago?) Maybe this will seem more exciting in practice than in theory. Schedule and ticket information, highlinefestival.com. Arcade Fire, Wednesday at 8 p.m., Radio City Music Hall; $35.50. Air, Thursday at 8 p.m., Madison Square Garden; $36. Polyphonic Spree, Friday at 6:30 p.m., Grand Ballroom, 311 West 34th Street; $35."
2007-05-06T00:00:00Z,"To the Editor: Michael Winerip (''Young, Gifted, and Not Getting Into Harvard,'' Parenting, April 29) had some poignant but probably misplaced sympathy for the résuméd, well-groomed, suburban kids whom he interviews for Harvard. I am a walking embodiment of this type (and a member of the new Harvard class of 2011), but I think that articles like Mr. Winerip's feed into the fervent but delusional belief that there is no greater reward for a hard-working, successful high school student than admission to a top-flight Ivy. Why feel sorry for the girl who got up at dawn to commute to a research job in a NASA lab? It is clear she has the intelligence, acumen and work ethic to succeed in this world, and will no doubt attend a fine school. She is clearly a lucky one, whether by virtue of innate intelligence, careful rearing or old-fashioned elbow grease."
2007-05-06T00:00:00Z,"To the thoughtful discussion of antisecularism, we could usefully add the distinction between religious identity and religious ethics (Russell Shorto, April 8). Narrowing religions to questions of identity is something that even the Bible critiques. Such identity politics is not only a source of tension; it has bred the ''kill the infidel'' mentality that erupts into religious violence. Religious ethics, on the other hand, enjoins people to be responsible for the lives and well-being of others, to care for the widow, orphan and stranger -- values that can form the core of a consensus among culturally diverse people. In this light, it is small wonder that lay religious groups committed to social justice are on the rise at the same time that church attendance is falling."

The bill will allow the Port Authority to purchase the lease of Stewart International Airport in Newburgh, N.Y., about 70 miles north of Manhattan. The law allows the Port Authority to expand outside of its current jurisdiction area, a 25-mile radius from the Statue of Liberty."

The Mets picked him up, boosted his confidence and gave him a shot in spring training to join the rotation. Sosa rewarded their faith in him Saturday night. Making his first start since June 20, 2006, Sosa was charged with two runs in six and one-third innings and Shawn Green homered and knocked in three runs as the Mets rolled to a 6-2 victory against the Arizona Diamondbacks at Chase Field. The win put them in position Sunday to record their third consecutive four-game sweep here."

Over the Christmas holidays, I went back to Sydney to visit my family and friends -- and also because it was my father's 60th birthday. It was a surprise visit for Dad. I flew early on Christmas morning, in time to wake up my father. On Boxing Day, we went up together to the Blue Mountains, to a swimming pool I had been to when I was growing up. It's actually a stream of running water, in Blue Mountains National Park. It's at the bottom of a sandstone ravine, surrounded by gum trees -- a really quiet place. I was just thinking how good it was to be back home again, to be with my family, to be back in the bush.'' As told to J. R. Romanko"

The Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Biophysics at Columbia University Medical Center mourns the death of our esteemed colleague, Emeritus Professor Dr. David Sprinson, on February 28th, 2007. Born in the Ukraine on April 5th, 1910, Dr. Sprinson earned the B.S. degree from City College in 1931, the M.S. degree from New York University in 1936, and the Ph.D. degree from Columbia University in 1946. He was appointed Assistant Professor at Columbia University in 1951 and rose to become Professor in 1958; after retiring in 1978, he continued research at St. Luke/Roosevelt Hospital Center for an additional twenty years. Dr. Sprinson elucidated the chemical pathways by which sugars are converted to the amino acids, their regulation, and interconversion of steroids. He was a Career Investigator of the American Heart Association, a member of the U.S. National Academy of Sciences, and was awarded the Doctor of Science Honoris causa by Columbia University. Dr. Sprinson is survived by his wife of 63 years, the former Helen Yeargain; their three children, and three grandchildren. Our deepest condolences are extended to Professor Sprinson's family.

2007-05-06T00:00:00Z,"Dane Cook is a successful stand-up comic with a burgeoning film career in pop comedies like ''Employee of the Month'' and this summer's ''Good Luck Chuck'' (Aug. 24). There's nothing funny about his work in the offbeat thriller ''Mr. Brooks'' (June 1). The movie stars Kevin Costner in the title role, a wealthy, upstanding business executive with a secret life as a reluctant, puritanical serial killer, and William Hurt as Mr. Brooks's mysterious alter ego, who eggs him on with chilly glee. Who in his right mind would want to compete against those two? Mr. Cook does, and when he's on screen, you can't look at anyone else. His character isn't just nasty, he's the apotheosis of vile. A voyeur with a zoom lens, he enjoys taking naughty snaps of a lusty couple in the high-rise across the street who don't believe in closing the curtains. Unexpectedly catching Mr. Brooks in the bloody act of bumping them off, he proceeds to blackmail him, but not for money. What he really wants is to get up close and personal with Mr. Brooks's murders, and demands to be taken along for the thrill."
2007-05-06T00:00:00Z,"David Rieff's excellent article about immigrant unrest in France's blue-collar suburbs omitted one important fact about French history (April 15). Today's working-class French suburban dweller can often trace his ancestry to former French colonies that existed from the mid-1800s until the early 1960s. Now, a century and a half after France colonized large portions of the Muslim world, the bitter fruits of that colonial era are obvious."

2007-05-06T00:00:00Z,"In Rare Company Chipper Jones of the Braves is closing in on 2,000 hits (1,978). With a career .305 average, he is one of four switch-hitters in history with a .300 average (minimum 1,500 games played). Frankie Frisch, Pete Rose and Roberto Alomar are the others. The Padres will visit Atlanta for a four-game set that starts tomorrow night. No Time to Unpack Outfielder Ryan Langerhans was traded twice in less than a week. On April 29, he was sent to the A's from the Braves, then on May 2, he was traded to the Nationals. In 1977, Dave Kingman played for the Mets (N.L. East), the Padres (N.L. West), the Angels (A.L. West) and the Yankees (A.L. East), becoming the first player to wear four uniforms in four divisions in the same season. Langerhans has a long way to go for the record; there are now six divisions. Nice to See You The Astros visit the Reds for a four-game series that begins tomorrow. Roy Oswalt, who beat the Reds last Wednesday and has an 18-1 record against them in 23 games, is set to start the opener. Here are other active pitchers who have a certain team's number: WATCH LIST Some of Phillies Manager Charlie Manuel's critics called him crazy for moving his best starter, Brett Myers, right, to the bullpen last month. Crazy like a fox, now that closer Tom Gordon is on the disabled list. Myers, who has averaged more than 12 strikeouts per nine innings this season, had his first save Thursday and has allowed one earned run in nine relief appearances. Gordon had three blown saves in eight chances. Injuries to Reggie Sanders and Ryan Shealy should give Billy Butler plenty of time to establish himself as a big-leaguer. With the much-ballyhooed Alex Gordon hitting .169 more than a month into the season, Butler, who was hitting .337 with six homers at Class AAA, may turn out to be the Royals' top rookie this season. Craig Counsell and Tony Graffanino have been keeping third base warm for the Brewers prospect Ryan Braun. But those two were hitting a combined .231 with one home run. Braun was hitting .366 with eight homers at Class AAA. More impressive than those numbers in the offense-happy Pacific Coast League, though, is Braun's plate discipline. He has struck out 9 times and walked 11 times in 93 at-bats. Statistics through Friday night. (Sources by Atlanta Braves 2006 Media Guide; STATS, LLC; Baseball-library.com. )"

2007-05-06T00:00:00Z,"MERRILL STUBBS ''It's always fun to experiment with something that's unpronounceable,'' says Merrill Stubbs, who sampled avgotaraho, Vacherin Fribourgeois and other just-hitting-the-radar finds for her column, ''The New Staples'' (Page 66). Savoring the role of culinary sleuth, she continually surveys her favorite specialty stores, like Brooklyn's D'Vine Taste, in search of ''ingredients that are not well known but will soon be discovered.'' That doesn't mean Stubbs, who is also hard at work testing recipes for an upcoming New York Times cookbook, is a food snob. Her favorite staple is something that most can relate to: roasted garlic and onion jam, which she slathers on pork roast and even on pronounceable cheeses."

2007-05-06T00:00:00Z,"If Flannery O'Connor had reimagined ''Baby Doll'' while listening to John Lee Hooker, the result would be ''Black Snake Moan.'' The writer and director, Craig Brewer (who also made ''Hustle & Flow''), is a provocateur who's at his most heartfelt when he's at his most outrageous. The film's poster -- a mockup of a comic-book cover showing a scantily clad Christina Ricci wearing a chain held by a glowering Samuel L. Jackson, who towers over her -- so freaked out some people that, without even seeing the movie, they condemned it as misogynist. Others who did see it simply found it ludicrous."

Now, with the help of technology and a little hemp-seed oil, Burt's Bees has produced Chemical-Free Sunscreen.

2007-05-06T00:00:00Z,"The incestuous teenage brother and sister of ''Les Enfants Terribles'' -- the delicate, effeminate Paul and the boyish, bossy Elisabeth -- are a study in complementary contrasts, a little like the men who actually made the 1950 movie. The writer, Jean Cocteau, had already written and directed ''La Belle et la Bête'' and ''Le Sang d'un Poéte.'' The director, Jean-Pierre Melville, who helped write the screenplay, had made only one film, but would go on to direct inventive and challenging gangster movies like ''Le Samourai'' and ''Le Cercle Rouge.'' There was only one chance for Cocteau's dreaminess to mesh with Mr. Melville's cleareyed practicality, and ''Les Enfants Terribles'' was it. The picture -- which would become the inspiration for ''The Dreamers'' by Bernardo Bertolucci -- is mesmerizing and unsettling: Paul (played by Edouard Dermithe, whose cheekbones appear to have been carved out of wax) moons first for a schoolboy classmate and later for a pretty, no-nonsense model who could be the schoolboy's twin. (Both characters are played by Renée Cosima.) Elisabeth (Nicole Stéphane, below, her eyes capable of the coldest calculation and appraisal) does nothing but lecture and berate Paul -- yet even her sharpness has a doting, cloying quality, as if, to keep Paul in her nest, she needed to cling to him with her talons."

Curlin, the second favorite, drew the dangerous No. 2 post and was bumped early as the pack made its move for the rail. Hard Spun, breaking from the No. 8 post, was unimpeded and outraced Stormello for the lead. Street Sense was forced to check slightly, then Calvin Borel waited for the pack to pass and moved sharply to the rail. Hard Spun raced free of the pack coming off the turn and set quick fractions with Sedgefield, Teuflesberg and Cowtown Cat pressing the pace. The closers relaxed well back: Curlin, who had shown an ability to race on the lead and from behind in his brief career, was 14th; Street Sense was 19th; and Imawildandcrazyguy was 20th. Nobiz Like Shobiz moved to fifth but could not advance. Street Sense's path was blocked by Sedgefield. In need of luck as much as talent, Street Sense found it when Teuflesberg lugged out and faded badly. That gave him the opening he needed. Street Sense surged through and then moved around Sedgefield. Only Hard Spun stood in his way. Street Sense moved wide and easily overtook Hard Spun, then slid to the rail as Borel started to celebrate early. Hard Spun held on for second. Curlin, who had encountered trouble, moved five wide and got up for third. Imawildandcrazyguy ran wide the whole way and was in the middle of the track at the end."

2007-05-06T00:00:00Z,"It almost seems dangerous to put these two pictures by the elusive French filmmaker Chris Marker on a single disc: this is an exploding world in one compact package. Mr. Marker's 1983 ''Sans Soleil'' is a travelogue of sorts, the story of one man's journey -- his delightfully fictional name is Sandor Krasna -- told through letters he has written to the woman who narrates. She reads these letters, which consist of loops of seemingly disconnected observations (''The Japanese invented CinemaScope 10 centuries before the movies''; ''History throws its empty bottles out the window''), as a soundtrack to the movie's drifting yet vivid collage of images. Mr. Marker shows us women in a West African marketplace, first timid about meeting the gaze of his lens, then defiantly challenging it; a pile of broken Japanese dolls being burned in an offering to the goddess of compassion; scraps from Alfred Hitchcock's ''Vertigo.'' Confounding and seductive, a meditation on memory, history and ritual, ''Sans Soleil'' is a handbook of the infinite ways in which it is possible to experience the world."

The April northeaster had hit New Jersey, and we were in its path. The accordion, which had belonged to my father-in-law, had been there for the eight years since his death. I could almost hear him say to my husband, ''Richie, it's O.K. to get rid of it now.'' But my husband couldn't bring himself to do it, despite the cracked bellows, keys and valves that rendered it beyond reasonable repair. It sat on the floor behind the bar, untouched.

2007-05-06T00:00:00Z,"To the Editor: As a former rider of a fixed-gear bicycle (with a front brake, by the way), I was generally annoyed by Jocko Weyland's focus on hipsters and fashion in his April 29 article, ''Unstoppable.'' These things may be what are making fixed gears trendy, but Kyle Fay got to the real source of fixed-gear fanaticism, which is ''being one with the bike.'' On a fixed gear, the power from your down stroke is returned to your legs on the up stroke of your pedals. This is unnerving at first but addictive and empowering. Whether your bike is beautiful or not, if you can't relate to it as an extension of yourself you're going to be thrown off your fixed gear. I received my first fixed gear after the death of my mother, and the feeling of my bike being alive, giving back to me and walking alongside me (the pedals never stop turning) cheered me in ways I can't describe. Mira Friedlaender Park Slope, Brooklyn To the Editor: As a longtime traffic safety advocate, I shudder to think of cyclists riding ''brakeless'' bicycles in any high-traffic-density area. Indeed, a city bicycle should have all the equipment possible to ensure not only the cyclist's safety but that of the pedestrians sharing these crowded urban spaces. Bette Dewing Upper East Side To the Editor: Your article about fixed-gear bicycles without brakes neglected to mention that riding without a brake is illegal in the state of New York; see Vehicle and Traffic Law 1236(c). Tom Ace Lone Pine, Calif. To the Editor: More than half a century ago in pre-Communist China, I once owned a ''fixie'' just like those described by Jocko Weyland in ''Unstoppable.'' It was the most pleasurable bicycle I had ridden in my high school days. I had a wonderful time racing against automobiles in the narrow streets of Shanghai until one day I came face to face with an oncoming trolley. Fortunately the trolley operator stopped short as I tried to slow down. The body of my bike was bent, but I was not hurt except for a few bruises on my leg. That was the end of my romance with a ''fixie.'' Timothy Tung Gramercy"

Behind the News -- The Chevrolet Suburban he was riding in last month was traveling at 91 miles an hour as he rushed to a meeting between Don Imus and members of the Rutgers women's basketball team. Mr. Corzine was thrown from the front passenger seat to the back, breaking his left femur, his sternum and 11 ribs. Leaving the hospital in a wheelchair last week, 18 days after the accident, he acknowledged: ''I set a very bad example.'' SLOW DOWN The News -- The California Highway Patrol says the driver of a gasoline tanker was speeding when he crashed, causing a fire that destroyed a vital highway interchange near downtown Oakland. Behind the News -- The driver, James Mosqueda, 51, lost control on a curve in what's known as the MacArthur Maze early last Sunday and hit a guardrail before overturning with a full load of gasoline, the authorities said. He walked away with second-degree burns. But the fire buckled a concrete and steel overpass, sending it crashing on Interstate 880. Contractors hope to have a ramp connecting the two highways reopened by next weekend. BUNT NEXT TIME? The News -- Chipper Jones, the third baseman for the Atlanta Braves, hit a line drive to the rookie Colorado Rockies shortstop Troy Tulowitzki, who turned it into an unassisted triple play. Behind the News -- The game was tied when Jones came to the plate in the seventh inning with Atlanta's Kelly Johnson and Edgar Renteria on base. On a 3-2 count, Jones hit a line drive at Tulowitzki, who caught the ball, stepped on second base to double up Johnson and then tagged Renteria as he ran toward second. The Rockies won, 9-7, in the 11th inning. ''It kind of just fell in my lap,'' said Tulowitzki of the 13th unassisted triple play in major league history.

TELL THE TRUTH The News -- John Browne, the longtime chief executive of BP, resigned abruptly last week after acknowledging he lied to a court about a younger man with whom he had a sexual relationship. Behind the News -- Mr. Browne, 59, transformed BP into one of the most successful global companies. But his downfall came after he admitted he lied to a judge when he tried to block a London tabloid from printing allegations of wrongdoing made by the man. Mr. Browne told the court he met him by chance in a park; news reports said they met through an escort service. His resignation cost him more than $30 million in lost retirement and stock benefits."

May 23 The Boss of It All Lars von Trier takes a vacation from the moral excoriation of the ''Dogville'' trilogy to create a funny, tiny, but no less thought-provoking comedy about an actor (Jens Albinus, the cult leader in ''The Idiots'') who is hired to impersonate a fictive corporate head: an imaginary ''no man'' invented by the actual boss of the company (Peter Gantzler) to take the heat for unpopular decisions.

It's a duet starring the lovable French-Algerian comedian Jamel Debbouze as a Parisian deeply in debt to gangsters; he prevents Angela, a tall, blond Dane (Rie Rasmussen) from killing herself, and earns himself a new protector. There is a plot twist, subtly tipped by the title. In glorious black-and-white, photographed by Thierry Arbogast.

With Justin Kirk, Karen Black and Melissa Leo. Paprika From one of Japan's masters of anime, Satoshi Kon, comes a many-layered science fiction tale, built around a headphonelike device that allows scientists to tap into and influence people's dreams.

They alternately reminisce and bicker, as the candles lighting their encounter burn to nubbins. Hostel: Part II This time it's three female American exchange students who are lured into a Slovakian den of torture. The director, again, is the uninhibited Eli Roth, who, in a Tarantino-like move, has invited two cult actors from the violent Italian ''gialli'' thrillers of the 1970s to join the cast: Luc Merenda and Edwige Fenech. And in-joke tops in-joke, with a cameo by the director Ruggero Deodato (''Cannibal Holocaust'') as a character named Fulci, a nod to the cult director Lucio Fulci.

Summer Palace According to Variety, this is the first mainland Chinese film to feature full frontal nudity and to depict the Tiananmen Square demonstration, but the real reason that the director, Lou Ye (''Purple Butterfly''), got in trouble with the Chinese authorities is that he didn't ask permission before entering his feature in last year's Cannes festival.

2007-05-06T00:00:00Z,"On Dec. 12, 1948, The New York Times published an article about crowds ''in holiday mood'' blocking traffic in an old Connecticut village of stately colonial homes. Nearing completion on Ponus Ridge in New Canaan was the ultramodern, all-glass house of the flamboyant modernist architect Philip Johnson. Nothing like it had been seen in these conservative, well-heeled parts. Actually, nothing like it had been seen anywhere, for Johnson's private architectural folly was one of the 20th century's most innovative modern buildings. Few people have ever been inside the 1,728-square-foot glass-and-steel residential structure until recently. Following a limited number of preview tours that started in April, the National Trust for Historic Preservation, which was given the house by Johnson in 1986, will celebrate the official opening of the 47-acre estate to the public with a gala picnic on June 23."
2007-05-06T00:00:00Z,"When Lisa and Dustin Hoffman were married 26 years ago, they vowed to stay together over hither and yon. Miles later, the pact has steadfastly kept: from locales exotic to mundane, Ms. Hoffman has packed and unpacked her family of eight (she and Mr. Hoffman have four children; he has two children from a previous marriage). She's become such a proficient globe-trotter that this year she created a travel-friendly line of skin care products, Lisa Hoffman Night & Day 24 Hour Skincare. ''Most people shop for upcoming seasons,'' Ms. Hoffman said. ''I shop for upcoming locations.'' Ms. Hoffman, 52, has a predilection for enduring classics: gorgeous woven bags by Bottega Veneta, simple Prada cashmere cardigans (''I bought them in every color -- they're great for airplanes'') and Lanvin flats. Here in the dressing room of her Manhattan apartment, she wears vanilla linen trousers by Ann Demeulemeester, a silk blouse and link necklace by Marni, a yellow Prada cardigan and Bottega Veneta shoes. Her Maurice Lacroix watch and ring were gifts from her husband. ''I tend to mix and match,'' she said, ''but my kids yell at me if I match too much.''"

2007-05-06T00:00:00Z,"Morgan Spurlock, the gadfly activist who permanently turned my children against McDonald's in ''Supersize Me,'' has now branded himself. His label, MORGAN SPURLOCK PRESENTS, is serving up ''CHALK,'' a mockumentary about a year in the life of three novice high school teachers. Mike Akel, the film's director and a writer, taught in Texas with the other writer, Chris Mass; the two channeled their daily frustrations and the absurdities of their world into the film. While uneven in the way that indie-financed movies can be, and bumpy in its improvisational style, ''Chalk'' has plenty of heart and a good dose of humor. Having done the festival circuit, the movie opens on Friday at the Nuart in Los Angeles, and across the country after that. The real documentary ''THE HIP-HOP PROJECT'' tells the inspirational story of a group of New York teenagers who use hip-hop as a vehicle for coping with difficulties in their lives, transforming them into tales told through music. The program was created by a formerly homeless youngster, Kazi, who became a mentor to other troubled teenagers, notably two named Princess and Cannon, who work on creating an album in the film. The hip-hop mogul Russell Simmons and the actor Bruce Willis donated a recording studio to the project too. The movie was screened at last year's Tribeca Film Festival to enthusiastic audiences. ThinkFilm will release it in a dozen cities on Friday. All the profits will go to youth organizations."
2007-05-06T00:00:00Z,"DEBORAH GARRISON'S first book of poetry, ''A Working Girl Can't Win,'' did remarkably well, selling 30,000 copies when even some Pulitzer Prize-winning poets are lucky to sell one-tenth that. The poems were about young women in love, out of love, making love and working in Manhattan. Most were written when Ms. Garrison was in her 20s and childless, living in the East Village and climbing the career ladder at The New Yorker. And then, just as she was being lauded as one of those hip young postfeminist urban women portrayed in ''Ally McBeal'' and ''Sex and the City,'' Ms. Garrison gave birth to her first child and moved to New Jersey."

The N.B.A.'s reciprocal study gets closer to the answer by determining the race of the officials calling each foul. But a better method would be to look carefully at each game and correlate the fouls that were called and those that were missed, with the race of the players and the officials."

2007-05-06T00:00:00Z,"Marion Cotillard is 31 but so in demand in her native France that she already has more than that many movies on her résumé. Thanks to the mingy distribution of foreign films here, American audiences probably know Ms. Cotillard, if they know her at all, as Russell Crowe's spirited Provençal love interest in ''A Good Year'' or the beautiful war widow hellbent on payback in Jean-Pierre Jeunet's ''Very Long Engagement.'' Those roles hint at Ms. Cotillard's range, but nothing she has done before comes close to the daunting complexity of her work as the French singer Édith Piaf in Olivier Dahan's biopic, ''La Vie en Rose'' (June 8). Ms. Cotillard is on screen for most of the movie's 140 minutes, and no matter how big and fierce her performance becomes, it never feels less than real. It's such a scarifying portrait of a brilliant, destructive woman that the scenes onstage, in which she simply stands and sings (she's a master lip-syncer) come as a relief. As Mr. Dahan tells it and Ms. Cotillard plays it, the tiny woman with the deep, throbbing voice who was called the Little Sparrow is so eaten by addiction and the traumas of her harsh early life that in success she's often a monster, abusing friends and colleagues with such lacerating force she makes you want to duck."

2007-05-06T00:00:00Z,"Call it plane travel, unplugged. Pared-down flights at super-cheap rates, which have been all the rage in Europe for years, will show up in the United States when Skybus Airlines (www.skybus.com) starts domestic operations on May 22. For budget-minded passengers, the compromise seems minimal; reservations must be made through the Web site (no customer relations phone number exists) and there are extra fees for services that are usually part of the fare -- like bag check ($5 each for two bags, $50 for additional ones), soft drinks and seating requests. But the flights are cheap. Really cheap. One-way fares start for as little as $10, with a top one-way walk-up fare of $330 (all flights must connect in Columbus, Ohio). Skybus is not serving the New York area, but is flying to nine other cities, including Richmond; Fort Lauderdale, Fla.; Greensboro, N.C.; San Francisco; and Seattle. Tourists who want a break from the slot machines now have the option of bowling in Las Vegas 24 hours a day. Last month, Red Rock Casino, Resort and Spa, about 10 miles off the Strip (www.redrocklasvegas.com), opened a 72-lane bowling center (below). The center has a pro shop, an arcade, meeting rooms, a deli, a lounge and bar, dart boards, billiard tables, a shuffleboard table, plasma televisions and, surprise, slot and video poker games. There is also a 12-lane, nightclub-like V.I.P. suite, which can be subdivided into four or eight lanes for private parties. Three-hour V.I.P. rates range from $1,500 to $4,500; catered food and bottle service are available. Regular rates start at $3 per adult per game. All Holiday Inn hotels -- nearly 1,000 -- will begin serving Rainforest Alliance certified coffee to guests by June. At least 30 percent of the beans used to make the coffee will be grown on farms that have met strict environmental and social standards on issues like worker protection and biodiversity conservation (www.rainforest-alliance.org).

2007-05-06T00:00:00Z,"PICASSO'S ''DEMOISELLES D'AVIGNON'' turns 100 this year, and to celebrate, there's a tribute opening on Wednesday at the Museum of Modern Art that traces its evolution. It's still a shocker, even after a century of art whose only ambition has been to top what Picasso did. Eight feet square, it's an acrid billboard of five preening prostitutes, naked, although you might not realize it because they're like cut crystal, blending into the background. They glare, one of them holding open the curtain of the bordello; we're their johns. Picasso is said to have repainted the scarified women on the right, with faces like masks, after seeing African art in Paris. In so doing, he opened a universe of savagery and primitivism. Whores and barbarians: he also linked them as social outcasts. Feminists have had a field day decoding the misogyny. If it's not the greatest 20th century painting, it remains the most radical because it changed art more than any other. Before it paintings at least had to pretend to be decorative and cogent. Afterward anything went. It's useful to recall that in 1907 Picasso was a rising star. His dealer saw this picture and thought Picasso had lost his mind. Matisse figured it had to be a joke. But then he realized it wasn't -- realized its immense implications -- and adjusted his art accordingly. Out of all this came Cubism and many of the other isms of the early century, which is to say modernity. In the Modern's previous incarnation, the painting was hung on a wall by itself, to concentrate our gaze. In the current Modern it shares a room crowded with art, diluting the impact. This small exhibition should restore, at least temporarily, our focus and remind us just how astonishing this picture has remained across a century. Through Aug. 27, (212) 708-9400, moma.org."

This happens most commonly when having made the diagnosis would have depended on speaking to the patient carefully and listening to the answers.

The April northeaster had hit New Jersey, and we were in its path. The accordion, which had belonged to my father-in-law, had been there for the eight years since his death. I could almost hear him say to my husband, ''Richie, it's O.K. to get rid of it now.'' But my husband couldn't bring himself to do it, despite the cracked bellows, keys and valves that rendered it beyond reasonable repair. It sat on the floor behind the bar, untouched. Now the muddy, insistent waters lashed at the seams of its old case, worming their way into the blue velvet interior."

Climate change is accelerating, and the prognosis for the region is alarming, as it is for the rest of the world. No matter how effectively we begin to curb our greenhouse-gas emissions now, we are destined to see significant climate changes because these gases remain in the atmosphere for a long time. We cannot delay planning for the environmental and human calamities that lie ahead. All over the world, according to the 2007 scientific report of the United Nations Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, ''it is very likely that hot extremes, heat waves and heavy precipitation events will continue to become more frequent.'' But we need look no further than our own backyard to find evidence of warming. Since 1950, average summer temperatures in New York City have increased by seven-tenths of a degree per decade, but for the last 20 years, by more than two degrees per decade."

Many tourists avoid the city in August, fearing hot weather and empty streets. But while it's true that many Parisians skip town and some boutiques and restaurants close, the lack of crowds can be a blessing. You may not avoid ''Da Vinci Code''-clutching crowds clamoring to see the ''Mona Lisa'' at the Louvre, but streets are less teeming and the notorious traffic is not as exasperating."

2007-05-06T00:00:00Z,"QUICK--Perry Day. Died on May 1st, 2007, age 61, at his home in Washington, DC. A prominent economist in Washington for three decades, Dr. Quick was a Vice President and Head of the Washington office of CRA, International, and former Partner and National Director of the Economics Consulting and Quantitative Analysis Division of Ernst & Young. Beloved by his surviving family: his wife, Linda Donaldson, his children by a former marriage, Elliot and Abby Quick, his step-daughter, Katie Flegal, his mother, Barbara Marshall, and his brother, Tim Quick. A memorial service will be held in early June at the Unitarian Universalist Church of Arlington, VA, 4444 Arlington Boulevard, Arlington, VA. Memorial gifts may be made in Dr. Quicks memory to the Lombardi Comprehensive Cancer Center, Georgetown University, Washington, DC, in support of the work of Dr. John Marshall in Colorectal Cancer Research."

2007-05-06T00:00:00Z,"In ''Waitress'' (May 2) Nathan Fillion plays the funny-Valentine love object of Keri Russell's pie-baking genius, and does it so deftly you wonder why more directors of romantic comedy haven't snapped him up. The last film by Adrienne Shelly, who was murdered in her Greenwich Village office last November, ''Waitress'' spices its humor with some decidedly tangy elements. For one thing the romance between Ms. Russell and Mr. Fillion is highly inappropriate, yet he carries it off with a light touch, quirky enough to feel just right. Mild mannered and good looking -- with a nose that suggests ski jump without quite being one -- Mr. Fillion is a realistic romantic lead. Unlike the pretty hunks or brooding glamour boys women are usually invited to lust after, he seems like the sort of cute-guy-down-the-block you might actually end up with. Not that Ms. Russell's Jenna is likely to. A waitress and chief pie-maker at the local diner, she is newly pregnant by an abusive husband she badly wants to leave. Mr. Fillion's Doc Pomatter is the new obstetrician in town, having traded life in Connecticut for this tiny Southern backwater where his wife, also a doctor, is doing her residency."

2007-05-06T00:00:00Z,"To the Editor: The lead article in the New Jersey section of April 29 asks, ''Should Immigration Be a Police Issue?'' The answer is obviously no. If you include illegal immigration, the answer is more complicated, and poses additional questions. For example, what if a large influx of illegal immigrants places excessive burdens on the housing stock, the hospitals, schools, social agencies and law enforcement agencies on communities throughout the land? How many immigrants can this country absorb in a given period of time without changing its very character, and should this matter?"

2007-05-06T00:00:00Z,"Once the center of East Berlin, Mitte -- the area around the Hackescher Markt S-Bahn station -- is now an upscale neighborhood with a low-key vibe. The architecture is a mix of East German prefab, concrete construction and beautiful 18th- and 19th-century buildings whose inner courtyards feed into one another, shielding many of the best-loved galleries, stores and restaurants from the street. Big German brands like Hugo Boss have opened concept stores on the graffitied main drags, but locals head for the more personal establishments, often hidden behind closed doors. Anna Winger"
2007-05-06T00:00:00Z,"To the Editor: Terrence Rafferty's entertaining essay on the shifting definition of movie detectives (''A Gumshoe Adrift, Lost in the '70s,'' April 15) elucidates well the transformation of Raymond Chandler's Philip Marlowe from Howard Hawks's noirish treatment of ''The Big Sleep'' to Robert Altman's revisionist take on ''The Long Goodbye.'' It's interesting to note that both films were written (co-written in the case of ''The Big Sleep'') by the talented screenwriter Leigh Brackett. Taking nothing from Robert Altman, perhaps it also took a woman of Ms. Brackett's unique perspective to help recast the masculine Marlowe in an era defined in the public imagination more by Watergate and self-actualization than light and shadows and single malt Scotch.

2007-05-06T00:00:00Z,"A reader asked the Ethicist if it was wrong to refuse a doctor's request to allow two medical-school residents to be present in the examining room (April 15). The Ethicist instructed the patient to recognize that he was part of a larger medical community and should do his fair share to support it. But the marketplace is equipped to handle this situation: a student of mine, with a unique case of appendicitis, received a discount on his surgery bill by agreeing to delay the appendectomy an hour so that the hospital could assemble a group of surgical students to watch the procedure. Why not use the straightforward rules of economics and ask for a discount if medical students are in tow?"
2007-05-06T00:00:00Z,"To the Editor: Lucy Ellmann's dismissive review of Henning Mankell's ''Depths'' (April 15) treats the book, set in neutral Sweden during World War I, as if it were simply a fantastical story of a man torn between two women. Judging that ''it seems needlessly offensive to bring up a real war at all,'' Ellmann narrows the novel to ''a dreamy little allegory'' without considering how this fable works as a dystopian parable about violence, hierarchy and power."

2007-05-06T00:00:00Z,"For the same reason that a four-minute single isn't necessarily more satisfying than a two-and-a-half-minute one, we don't really need a director's cut of Tom Hanks's blissful 1996 love letter to '60s pop, ''That Thing You Do!'' The new version clocks in at about two and a half hours, compared with the reet, petite 108 minutes of the original. Fortunately, though, both versions are included here, and while Mr. Hanks's director's cut is worth a fast-forward through (particularly for the way it fleshes out, albeit telegraphically, an interracial romance between two of the characters), the original is the one to watch. ''That Thing You Do!'' follows the rapid rise and even dizzier fall of a fictional pop group from Erie, Pa., around 1964. The band has its lead-singer dreamboat (played by Johnathon Schaech); its good-natured, unassuming drummer (Tom Everett Scott, right, with Charlize Theron); and its No. 1 fan and booster (a heartbreakingly luminous Liv Tyler). They called themselves the Wonders, never stopping to think they are courting that dangerous and undesirable modifier ''one-hit.'' But even though that one hit is their destiny -- its title is the same as the movie's, and it was written by the gifted Adam Schlesinger of the New Jersey band Fountains of Wayne -- Mr. Hanks isn't giving us a cautionary showbiz tale but a buoyant examination of the power that pop songs can have over us."
2007-05-06T00:00:00Z,"I STUMBLED over the accordion in the basement, its case already as deep in water as I was -- water pouring in from foundation crevices, billowing up through floor tiles into the fringed magenta rug and, more repulsively, backing up from the street through the sewer cap that we had opened in a feeble attempt to drain away the flood. The April northeaster had hit New Jersey, and we were in its path. The accordion, which had belonged to my father-in-law, had been there for the eight years since his death. I could almost hear him say to my husband, ''Richie, it's O.K. to get rid of it now.'' But my husband couldn't bring himself to do it, despite the cracked bellows, keys and valves that rendered it beyond reasonable repair. It sat on the floor behind the bar, untouched. Now the muddy, insistent waters lashed at the seams of its old case, worming their way into the blue velvet interior."

2007-05-06T00:00:00Z,"To the Editor: Your April 29 editorial ''Storm Warnings'' refers to my August 1988 article about Westchester's waterways. I called for a ''watchman of the waterways'' to represent the needs of our county's rivers and streams. We still need such a position, with the power to be effective. Flooding and pollution are even worse problems now. And we're seeing the impact of global warming on climate change. Open space is being destroyed one parcel at a time. The destruction of trees and excavation in the Mamaroneck River watershed along Route 287 in White Plains is the most recent example."
2007-05-06T00:00:00Z,"LAZARUS--Lester ''Roy'', inspired Opera Director dies at age 76. Roy Lazarus, performer, opera director, and educator, died of cardiac arrest on April 13th in Maine where he had made is home since 1986. A brilliant performer, he went on to translate his insight and approach to performance into a truly valid and usable stage technique which influenced countless numbers of students. His career spanned some 60 years and covered all aspects of the operatic and musical theater genres. Heard on national radio at age 15 as ''The Boy Basso from Brooklyn,'' he went on to be educated at Syracuse University. Returning to the stage in New York City he was engaged as Al, one of the four cowboys in the original Broadway production of Frank Loesser's musical ''The Most Happy Fella.'' The show's hit song ''Standin' On The Corner'' created one of the most memorable moments in Broadway history. The quartet subsequently appeared on the ''Ed Sullivan'' and ''I Love Lucy'' shows. He also appeared on Broadway in ''How to Succeed in Business Without Really Trying'' and often worked with Don Adams and Carol Burnett at Green Mansions in the Adirondacks. In his late 20s he focused on opera and sang for several years with the New York City Opera. In the mid 1960s he taught at the Juilliard School. Ultimately, he became Professor of Opera at the Oberlin Conservatory of Music in Ohio where he founded and directed the Oberlin Music Theater. This important summer festival helped train a generation of young artists. The roster of opera houses around the country is testimony to the success of his program. Mr. Lazarus directed opera companies across the United States. In recent years he taught voice in Maine and continued to coach various established artists. Roy Lazarus is survived by his son Steven and grandson Joseph of Peoria, AZ, his son David and grandsons Matthew and Paul of Castle Rock, CO and his sister Bernice of Boca Raton, FL. He will be deeply missed."

2007-05-06T00:00:00Z,"This trim, tense, little-known 1948 noir, one of 10 included in the Warner Brothers set ''Film Noir, Volume 4,'' is an anomaly among the more prestigious pictures directed by Fred Zinnemann (whose best and best known include ''From Here to Eternity'' and ''The Nun's Story''). In the wordless sequences when the lead, Van Heflin (right, with Mary Astor), wanders deserted Los Angeles alleys and back streets, the shadows and seemingly abandoned buildings hovering over him (the movie was shot by Robert Surtees), ''Act of Violence'' becomes a distillation of noir itself. Even if Mr. Heflin were the last man on earth, he'd still be pursued by his own guilt. This fine, underrated actor plays a family man, successful building contractor and decorated war pilot who spent a year in a German prison camp. His life, the picture of middle-class success, begins to crumble when a tall, limping stranger (the great Robert Ryan, evoking terror and pity in the way only he could) shows up in his small California town. The man was Mr. Heflin's closest Army buddy, and the possessor of the secret that gives the lie to his model-citizen persona."

2007-05-06T00:00:00Z,"ADAMS--Reverend Dr. Ann Bamford, longtime Associate Minister at the Wellesley Hills Congregational Church, in Wellesley Massachusetts, died early Thursday morning at the age of 52. She had battled bravely against cancer for two and a half years. Dr. Adams served her community both in her pastoral role at the Hills Church, and also, with great advocacy and conviction, served on the board of the Wellesley Housing Authority, connecting deeply with tenants of Wellesley's public housing. She was still active on the Housing Authority at the time of her death. She was active in numerous church and civic organizations, including the Boston City Mission Society and as a Director of the Massachusetts Conference of the United Church of Christ. Known for the freshness, candor, and great faith of her original prayers, Adams reached out well beyond the Wellesley community through her website Prayerswork.com which offered a daily prayer, and a blog which chronicled her life with cancer with a humor and endurance that encouraged many cancer patients across the country and the world. Many of these prayers have been collected in her book Prayer At Work (Chapel Place Press). Adams leaves her son, Thomas Craig Bailey Adams, and her husband, Reverend Craig B. Adams, of Otisfield, Maine. The Rev. Mr. Adams, is Minister Emeritus of the Wellesley Hills Congregational Church. In addition to her son, Adams is survived by her father, Richard Bamford and stepmother Dee Bamford of Connecticut. Adams mother, Mary, predeceased her daughter. Adams is also survived by a brother, Benjamin Bamford, and sister, Jane Bamford Kennedy, her aunt Cynthia Adams Johnson, and stepdaughter Catherine Jordan and her family, and stepson Martin Adams and his family. Adams was born on October 11, 1954 and moved many times as a child, graduating from E.O. Smith High School in Storrs, Connecticut in 1972. Adams graduated from Wellesley College with the class of 1976, Phi Beta Kappa, with a degree in Economics. She continued her education at Yale, graduating in the first class of Yale's School of Management in 1978. Adams was working in the investment community in New York City when she felt called to ministry. She earned her M. Div and D. Min. at Andover Newton Theological School and served at the Wellesley Hills Church in Wellesley, Massachusetts, for over 19 years. Additionally, Adams served as Interim Associate Minister at Hancock United Church of Christ, in Lexington, and at Babson College, in Wellesley, where she was Protestant Chaplain. Despite her grave illness, Adams delivered the eulogy for legendary economist Carolyn Shaw Bell, who was memorialized at Wellesley College, this past January. Bell had been Adams' advisor while studying at the College. In lieu of flowers, gifts may be made to the ''Ann Adams Revocable Trust'' and sent to Miriam T.

It's a simple thing, this impact, and not at all representative of the technical exertion that surrounds it.

2007-05-07T00:00:00Z,"RAININ--Kenneth, Entrepreneur and Philanthropist, is Dead at 68. Kenneth Rainin, an unstoppable entrepreneur who built his fortune founding scientific and medical products companies and who later parlayed his wealth and management expertise into many charitable causes, died on Wednesday, May 2, 2007 at his home in Piedmont, California. He was 68. The son of William and Betty Rainin, he was born in Cleveland, Ohio in 1938. He graduated from Ohio State University before enlisting in the Army. Mr. Rainin entered the business world shortly after his discharge from the US Army. At the age of 25, he founded Rainin Instrument Company which initially distributed laboratory instruments and supplies. Mr. Rainin secured the rights to sell a line of laboratory pipettes, and through design improvements, built the Pipetman into the dominant brand of pipettes used in laboratories. Later Mr. Rainin developed his own line of ergonomic pipettes which are now recognized as the standard around the world. Pipettes were not his only business interest; other ventures included intraocular lens manufacturing, food manufacturing, wine production and the gaming/ hospitality industry. Mr. Rainin was also involved in many civic and cultural activities. Among his greatest passions was the San Francisco Ballet, which he served as Former Chairman of the Executive Committee. He created the Kenneth Rainin Foundation which supports research at the UCSF Medical School and the Cleveland Clinic Foundation. Many would argue his greatest talent lay in design and innovation. He used these talents to build his businesses, as well as two of the world's most elegant motor yachts, each christened Rasselas, named after Samuel Johnson's epic fictional character, The Prince of Abyssinia, who traveled throughout ancient Arabia in search of happiness. Mr. Rainin is survived by a daughter, Jennifer Rainin, a son, Jesse Rainin, two grandsons and a brother, Edgar Rainin. A memorial service will be held on Monday, May 14th at 4:00 p.m. at Grace Cathedral in San Francisco. In lieu of flowers, donations may be made to the UCSF Foundation -Center for Colitis and Crohns Disease, 44 Montgomery Street, Suite 2200, San Francisco, CA 94104."

But what is certain is that Nicolas Sarkozy, who won Sunday's runoff election, is one of the most polarizing figures to move into Élysée Palace in the postwar era. He is a whirling dervish of ideas who inspires hope and fear. Even many members of his own party, the Union for a Popular Movement, are holding their breath in anticipation of what his presidency may bring.

As gallantly as the Rangers tried to force overtime, their 5-4 loss eliminated them from the Stanley Cup playoffs and chiseled another number into the long list of negative numbers that live in Rangers history, not to mention Rangers infamy."

Archbishop Akinola arrived in Virginia late last week to install a new bishop for one such structure, rejecting requests to cancel his trip from the archbishop of Canterbury, the leader of the communion, and the presiding bishop of the Episcopal Church, the American branch of Anglicanism. Archbishop Akinola dismissed concerns that he was exacerbating tensions over a longstanding dispute regarding the church’s liberal stance on homosexuality, blaming instead the Episcopal Church for the crisis."

The party was poised to have a strong showing in the elections, with some even predicting a win for the separatists, who want Quebec to be a nation. But instead they had their worst showing in decades. When he was elected party leader in November 2005, Mr. Boisclair, 41, made headlines for being openly gay and for admitting to having used cocaine while a cabinet minister. His relative youth also marked a departure from previous sovereignty leaders, most of whom traced their roots to the party’s founding in the late 1960s. He fought back tears as he announced his resignation, ending it with a familiar rallying cry among separatists: “Vive le Quebec!”."

He wrote that although the chief argument supporting the limits concerns protecting the anonymity of undercover officers, no one “has been able to identify a single instance when trace data compromised the anonymity of an officer or the integrity of an investigation.” Erik Ablin, a Justice Department spokesman, said the limits were in keeping with the bureau’s “longstanding policy of disclosing firearms trace results only to the law enforcement agency that recovered the crime gun.”."

In other words, it is not so different from Taipei, whose unreliable plumbing and ambient anomie have fueled Mr. Tsai's imagination in the past. His Kuala Lumpur -- the capital of his native country, Malaysia, but not a city where he has filmed before -- is a polyglot metropolis of drifters and immigrants. The three main characters speak Chinese, Malay and Bengali -- or would, if they ever said anything. The protagonists in Mr. Tsai's films are about as likely to speak as he is to move the camera.

The bonbons are extremely traditional -- no wildly experimental truffles here -- but they offer deep, chocolaty satisfaction, occasionally played off against creamy hazelnut gianduja.

Crisp but delicate little ''petals'' of dried tapenade, or olive paste, can be used for snacking, dipping and artfully garnishing a slice of tomato, a disk of fresh goat cheese atop a salad, a portion of poached fish, scrambled or poached eggs, or a risotto. They are made at Moulin du Calanquet, an artisanal olive farm in St.-Rémy-de-Provence, France. The green ones are mild and herbaceous, the black are earthier and saltier.

The limits bar the bureau from releasing gun-trace data except to police officials and prosecutors working on a particular crime. The mayor sent a copy of the letter to members of Congress. He wrote that although the chief argument supporting the limits concerns protecting the anonymity of undercover officers, no one ''has been able to identify a single instance when trace data compromised the anonymity of an officer or the integrity of an investigation.'' Erik Ablin, a Justice Department spokesman, said the limits were in keeping with the bureau's ''longstanding policy of disclosing firearms trace results only to the law enforcement agency that recovered the crime gun.''

2007-05-09T00:00:00Z,"To the Editor: Eric Asimov and his panel of gin adjudicators overlooked a mixture of spirits that is my candidate for the perfect martini (Gins of The Times: ''No, Really, It Was Tough: 4 People, 80 Martinis,'' May 2). It's called the San Francisco martini and may have originated at the bar in the Mark Hopkins hotel, where I discovered it some years ago. In my experience, it has never been surpassed for the subtlety of its juniper flavor, its silky smoothness and its pleasurable kick: five parts vodka to one part gin and no frilly French vermouth. Charles Michener New York To the Editor: Congratulations on Step 1. You have identified the gin that goes best with Noilly Prat. But as you wrote, ''What is a cocktail but a blend of disparate elements?'' You should now repeat the experiment with at least a few other dry vermouths, which I think are as variable in flavor as gins. My favorite vermouth for a martini is Boissière extra dry. If you buy good gin and poor vermouth you can't get a good martini. After matching vermouths and gins, then you can match the best combinations of gin and vermouth for a grand-prize winner. Doug Bly Rockville, Md. To the Editor: It may surprise Mr. Asimov to learn that an important reason people drink vodka martinis rather than the real McCoy is the fear of severe headaches that the gin version engenders. I am one of those sufferers, and I must admit that I violate the proscription occasionally to experience the nirvana of a true martini. The ensuing suffering is occasionally deemed worthwhile. David T. Mintz Scarsdale, N.Y. To the Editor: I greatly enjoyed the article on the martini, although perhaps not as much as I would have had I been invited to the tasting! The article neglected to mention olives, which are the classic ''third ingredient'' in this cocktail. The salty, oily addition of (precisely) three high-quality green olives completes this classic drink. Jesse Hackell Suffern, N.Y."

''The current conditions don't allow me to do this anymore,'' he said. The party was poised to have a strong showing in the elections, with some even predicting a win for the separatists, who want Quebec to be a nation.

When he was elected party leader in November 2005, Mr. Boisclair, 41, made headlines for being openly gay and for admitting to having used cocaine while a cabinet minister. His relative youth also marked a departure from previous sovereignty leaders, most of whom traced their roots to the party's founding in the late 1960s.

Caitlin, Jeremy, Gillian, Alex, and Aliya. She has lived under the cruel cloud of Alzheimer's disease for nearly 15 years. But those fortunate enough to remember her before her affliction knew a gentle and loving woman with remarkable skills as a journalist. Her creative imagination inspired her to synthesize a play-byplay account of a baseball game (Brooklyn Dodgers, of course) entirely with lines from Shakespeare; her versatility enabled her to write radio scripts for the Office of War Information, and to work as editor of Soviet Russia Today and of Consumer Reports, to win high regard as a labor journalist -a reporter for the NMU Pilot, an editor for Trade Union Service and New York bureau chief for Federated Press; and when McCarthyism made labor journalism untenable, she was able to adapt to her craft the field of medical journalism, first as a writer for the American Heart Association and for the Arthritis Foundation, then as Managing Editor of Emergency Medicine and Manuscript Editor of Hospital Practice. Underlying all was a peerless sense of craft and of the shape of language. A colleague once remarked, ''Naomi can spot a typo across the room, even if she can't speak the language.''"

Austria Returns Munch Art to Mahler Family In the conclusion of a restitution battle spanning six decades, an Edvard Munch painting was presented yesterday to Marina Mahler, the granddaughter of the composer Gustav Mahler. It was given to Ms. Mahler by Austria's minister for culture, Claudia Schmied, who said returning the painting, ''Summer Night on the Beach,'' (at right, with Ms. Mahler, left, and Ms. Schmied), to its rightful owner was a ''historic duty,'' Agence France-Presse reported. Given in 1916 to Alma Mahler, the composer's widow, the painting was lent to the Belvedere museum in Vienna in 1937, a year before Austria was annexed by Germany. Her stepfather, a Nazi sympathizer, sold it to the museum in 1940. After World War II Alma and her granddaughter began the fight to reclaim the painting. Rolling Stones Move On The Rolling Stones, responding to protests from animal-rights proponents, have decided to move their July 14 concert in Belgrade to a vast public park instead of the city's racetrack, where their music might upset hundreds of horses, The Associated Press reported.

Diddy, Tom Jones and Nelly Furtado have been added to the lineup of the July 1 concert in London commemorating the 10th anniversary of the death of Diana, Princess of Wales, the BBC reported. Led by $312,000 for a 1975 Travis Bean electric guitar once owned by Jerry Garcia, a Grateful Dead memorabilia auction fetched more than $1.1 million in San Francisco on Tuesday, Reuters reported. Johnny Hallyday, France's answer to Elvis Presley, has decided to end his self-imposed exile in Switzerland now that his tax-cutting friend Nicolas Sarkozy has been elected president of France, Agence France-Presse reported. In an interview with RTL radio, Laetitia Hallyday, the performer's wife, said, ''Nicolas Sarkozy's policies will certainly lead us to come back to France.'' Last year, in a bombshell announcement, Mr. Hallyday, 63, said he was moving to Gstaad to escape France's high taxes. Music Director Leaves Santa Fe Opera Alan Gilbert, below, mentioned as a possible successor to Lorin Maazel as music director of the New York Philharmonic, has stepped down after four years as music director of the Santa Fe Opera, PlaybillArts reported. Mr. Gilbert, born in New York in 1968 to two Philharmonic violinists, has a thriving international career as a conductor. In leaving the Santa Fe Opera, he said in a statement that the position of its music director ''unfortunately requires a time commitment that at the present I feel I am unable to make.'' Lilly Prize Goes To Lucille Clifton Lucille Clifton has won the $100,000 Ruth Lilly Poetry Prize, established in 1986 and awarded annually by the Poetry Foundation. In announcing the award, Christian Wiman, editor of Poetry magazine and chairman of the selection committee, said: ''Her poems are at once outraged and tender, small and explosive, sassy and devout. She sounds like no one else, and her achievement looks larger with each passing year.'' Her prize will be presented on May 23 at the Arts Club of Chicago. Ms. Clifton, 70, who lives in Columbia, Md., and teaches at St. Mary's College of Maryland, won a National Book Award in 2000 for ''Blessing the Boats: New and Selected Poems, 1988-2000'' (BOA Editions).

2007-05-10T00:00:00Z,"CONWAY--James J. Jr., former Chairman and Chief Executive of the Long Island Savings Bank, died on May 6, 2007 of complications after a long illness. Jim Conway was married to Dolores (Dee) Gilhooly for 53 years, was the father of five children and grandfather of 18, and was an accomplished banker, lawyer, and athlete. He was 78 years old. Mr. Conway was born in Rockaway and grew up in Jamaica Estates, Queens. He was a graduate of Brooklyn Prep, the College of the Holy Cross and Fordham Law School. Mr. Conway was a longtime resident of Manhasset, New York; Quogue, New York; and Palm Beach, Florida. Mr. Conway served as Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of The Long Island Savings Bank from 1978 until 1992. The Bank's assets grew tenfold under his leadership, and the book value of the savings bank increased over 1,500 percent. In addition, Mr. Conway led the bank through a difficult period in the financial services industry and successfully led the acquisition and integration of several failed thrifts from the FDIC. Mr. Conway had a reputation as a dynamic leader with a range of expertise, from home mortgage lending to real estate finance and development, to sophisticated financing and asset-related funding techniques. Long Island Savings Bank converted from mutual ownership, went public, and was subsequently acquired by Astoria Federal Savings. Jim Conway was well known for his generosity. He made many of his gifts to help others in a quiet way, neither seeking nor valuing public recognition. There are countless individuals with stories of favors, big and small, where Jim Conway stepped in during a time of need. While he supported many charities and community works, his favorite causes were education and youth programs. Jim Conway and his wife and family were longtime supporters of Little Flower Children's Services, an agency providing educational, foster care, family counseling and adoption services. Jim Conway was an active athlete and sports fan. He played competitive baseball and basketball in high school and college and was offered a professional baseball contract at a young age. He was a passionated participant in everything he did and played competitive golf until late in life. Jim Conway pursued with a passion a lifelong interest in horse racing where he displayed his competitive drive, street smarts, and luck. He was an owner or part owner of many leading trotters and thoroughbreds, enjoying considerable success over many years. One of his horses, Kash Minbar, was a repeat winner of the American Trotting Championship and set national and world records in the mile, mile-and-aquarter and mile-and a half. One of his thoroughbreds, Greenwood Lake, was the favorite to win the Kentucky Derby in 2000 after having won the Florida Derby, the Remsen and the Champagne Classic. Unfortunately, Greenwood Lake suffered a career-ending broken leg two months prior to the Kentucky Derby. The caption under Mr. Conway's photo in his senior yearbook at Holy Cross called him ''Lucky Jim'' and noted that he was known for his intelligence, his charm and sense of humor, his athletic skill, and pointed out that he liked to dance. In many ways the editor of the Holy Cross yearbook captured the essence of Jim Conway's life. The only thing that editor missed was his love and devotion to his wife Dee and his pride and enjoyment of his family. In addition to his wife Dee, Mr. Conway is survived by his five children: James J. Conway III of Matinecock, NY, Susan Conway Petrelli of Harrison, NY, Kevin J. Conway of Plandome, NY, Brian J. Conway of Newton, MA and Traci Conway Clinton of Plandome Manor, NY; two daughters-in-law, Denise Conway and Karen Conway; two sons-in-law, Joseph Petrelli and Matthew Clinton; 18 grandchildren; a sister, Janet Conway Sands of Woodbury, CT. (Eddie) and a sister-inlaw, Ruth Conway of Landrum, SC. Mr. Conway was predeceased by his beloved sister Marge, and brother, Bobby. The wake for James Conway will held be at Fairchild & Sons Funeral Home at 1570 Northern Boulevard in Manhasset, New York. (Thursday, May 10 from 2-5 pm and 7-9 pm). There will be a memorial mass at St. Mary's Church in Manhasset at 5 pm on Friday, May 11. The family will be holding a private burial service. In lieu of flowers, the family requests that donations be made to Little Flower Children's Services; 2450 N. Wading River Road; PO Box 9000; Wading River, NY 11792."

2007-05-10T00:00:00Z,"LAST Friday afternoon, Jamie Gray, the owner of the Brooklyn design boutique Matter, stood in an empty storefront in Lower Manhattan, scraping away at a stubborn plastic UV filter that covered the front window. The work was punishing -- ''hopefully there won't be any scratches or blood loss,'' he said, though he ended up calloused and bleeding -- and very time consuming, considering he had less than two weeks left until the opening of Matter's new Manhattan branch. A lot of problems remained to be dealt with, including glass doors he had trouble mounting on the display cases, and the important shipment of Established & Sons furniture stuck in customs limbo. But Mr. Gray had been through worse in the last few months, he said. When he set out to find a Manhattan space in February, he was lucky. ''I called the right agent on the right day,'' he said, and found this storefront, which he decided he had to have. He was soon shaking hands on a deal for the property and envisioning an opening that would coincide with the design bacchanalia around the International Contemporary Furniture Fair in May. Two hours later the deal fell through. ''For three weeks I was scrambling,'' he said. ''And then they changed their minds; I got the space. So it has a happy ending. Or a happy beginning, anyway.''"

(Sundance) MUTUAL APPRECIATION (2005) This “wonderful independent film” directed by Andrew Bujalski “looks like something that just came out of a time capsule, but there’s nothing dusty about it,” Manohla Dargis wrote in The New York Times, comparing its “artfully artless, low-fi vibe” to the French New Wave and the East Village film scene of the late 1970s. Alan (Justin Rice, above), a musician whose band has just broken up, arrives in New York in pursuit of a rock ’n’ roll career. Seung-Min Lee, at his left, plays Sara, a radio D.J. who would like more from Alan than he wants to give; Mr. Bujalski is Lawrence, Alan’s best friend; and Rachel Clift is Ellie, Lawrence’s girlfriend — and the woman Alan would take, if he could. “It’s the sort of unassuming discovery that could get lost in a crowd or suffer from too much big love, and while it won’t save or change your life, it may make your heart swell,” Ms. Dargis wrote. “Its aim is modest and true.”."

2007-05-11T00:00:00Z,"The changeability of Miles Davis has become a defining notion, seemingly as crucial to his legend as the music he made. It's one reason that Apple featured him in its ''Think Different'' advertisements a decade ago, alongside Bob Dylan and Picasso, chameleons with whom he is often compared. That quality also provides the premise for two concerts presented by Jazz at Lincoln Center this weekend under a mildly patronizing banner, ''The Many Moods of Miles Davis.'' Each concert will feature two ensembles and cover two incarnations of Davis's career. Tonight that means bebop and ''The Birth of the Cool,'' courtesy of the trumpeter Ryan Kisor, a member of the Jazz at Lincoln Center Orchestra; and then the exploratory post-bop of the 1960s, courtesy of another trumpeter, Terence Blanchard. (Each artist will lead a quintet.) Tomorrow night promises more cognitive dissonance. While Nicholas Payton will fill the Davis role on the landmark album ''Kind of Blue,'' the electric bassist Marcus Miller will reprise his own role in the music of the 1970s and '80s. Of course, there is some incongruity to conjuring Electric Miles on Jazz at Lincoln Center's stage. (Wynton Marsalis, the organization's artistic director, has characterized Davis's post-'60s output as a product of commercial capitulation.) Partly for this reason, the tribute may not do enough to emphasize the clarity of vision behind all those so-called moods. So it seems appropriate to note the concurrent club engagement of 4 Generations of Miles, involving veterans of Davis's employ. In chronological order of service, they are the drummer Jimmy Cobb, the tenor saxophonist George Coleman, the bassist Buster Williams and the guitarist Mike Stern. Their collective experience stretches as far back as the late '50s and runs up through the early '80s. Change will animate their music, to be sure, but continuity seems likely to play a part too. (Tonight and tomorrow night at 8, Frederick P. Rose Hall, Jazz at Lincoln Center, 60th Street and Broadway, 212-721-6500, jalc.org; $30 to $120. 4 Generations of Miles performs tonight through Sunday night at 8 and 10, with a midnight set tonight and tomorrow, Iridium Jazz Club, 1650 Broadway, at 51st Street, 212-582-2121, iridiumjazzclub.com; cover, $35, with a $10 minimum.)

Hershey (''The Empty Mirror''), is a record of casting calls for lead actresses in a dramatic feature that Mr. Hershey wrote but has yet to direct: a seemingly Hemingwayesque drama involving a wounded combat photographer, a nun, a dancer and a painter's model. From its opening montage of head shots through its fragments of auditions and between-performance chatter, ''Casting About'' is a solid documentary about how art is made."

Attorney General Andrew M. Cuomo said the company claimed the material was not hazardous when it applied for a dumping permit. Samples of the waste were subsequently sent for analysis to laboratories that confirmed that it contained lead, Mr. Cuomo said. The company was fined $300,000 for unlawful dealing in hazardous wastes and agreed to pay $1.5 million to finance a lead removal program for children.

Vineyards are visible from the highway and just in case you weren't sure, there is a big sign announcing that you are in wine country. I've lived in Washington for about 20 years and the profile of this area has really been raised for wine lovers. There are well over 50 wineries in Walla Walla now, and actually a number of tasting rooms are right downtown, which is about 10 blocks from my house. I've been to perhaps a half-dozen. Wineries from this region make a lot of cabernets, merlots and meritages, or red blends, but you also see some good rieslings and chardonnays. The big season for wine tourists started in mid-April and wineries put on events throughout the summer. The barrel tasting in early May is huge, and all the wineries open their doors with food and, of course, wine. As a vacation rental, this house attracts a lot of visitors coming for long weekends from Seattle."

The governor's office has estimated the budget at $121 billion, while the comptroller's estimate is $124 billion, leading to a dispute over how much the state is spending. ''The next step toward budget reform has to focus on spending restraint,'' said Mr. DiNapoli, above. Mr. Spitzer opposed Mr. DiNapoli's appointment to the comptroller's office after the resignation of Alan G.

2007-05-11T00:00:00Z,"The artists' collective known as Assume Vivid Astro Focus takes over John Connelly Presents this month with a slightly ridiculous ensemble: an installation of wrapped objects and text-based 3-D wallpaper covering the gallery walls, ceiling and floor; a dark subterranean corridor of pulsing music and flashing neon sculptures; and a cordoned-off room of psychedelic wallpaper, sculptures, video, balloons, streamers and stuffed toys. The room is used for periodic, often bawdy performances, which are part of the installation. Audience members slip under sheaths attached to wallpaper, left, to look through peepholes for a view of the room. I saw Philly, a gender-confused romantic who likes to sing, dance and lament lost loves. The show over all is the antithesis of the polished displays in pristine white galleries that abound throughout Chelsea, and in some ways that is the point. The wallpaper, music, flashing lights, 3-D glasses and other gizmos are used to immerse viewers in a world in which layers of images and ideas collide. Sometimes it can all seem like nonsense, a contrived mess by a bunch of small-minded, overcaffeinated adolescents. But it also paints a vision of what, to some, paradise might be: a playful Technicolor world of roaming, free-formed ideas.

Yes, there were always Republicans who broke with party orthodoxy on the issue, from New England moderates like Senator Olympia J. Snowe of Maine to pragmatists like Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger of California. But the party's platform, if anything, grew less pliant on abortion over the years. And the party invariably nominated presidential candidates who embraced, rather than challenged, the full ''pro life'' position. (Just as the Democrats did, on the ''pro choice'' side.)"

It said that at the opening of an inquest into her death yesterday, the deputy Gloucestershire coroner, David Dooley, reported that after Ms. Blow, 48, was ''found in a poorly state'' on Saturday and taken to the hospital, ''she told doctors she had taken paraquat, and tests proved positive for this liquid.''

2007-05-11T00:00:00Z,"A civilian employee of the Police Department and two of his friends were charged yesterday with stealing about $30,000 worth of property that belonged to defendants and crime victims, prosecutors said. The employee, Kevin Byrd, 36, of Springfield Gardens, Queens, faces charges including grand larceny, forgery and criminal possession of stolen property, said Robert M. Morgenthau, the Manhattan district attorney. Mr. Byrd was the evidence and property control specialist for the 28th Precinct, in Harlem, Mr. Morgenthau said. He said that from October 2006 until January, Mr. Byrd forged vouchers for property and cash, and stole personal items, including a dead man's wedding ring. Mr. Byrd's friends -- James Goorahoo, 37, of Springfield Gardens, and Jermal Williams, 36, of Laurelton, Queens -- were also charged with grand larceny. Pretending to be crime victims, they exchanged the fake cash vouchers for checks at Police Headquarters, then split the money with Mr. Byrd, prosecutors said."
2007-05-11T00:00:00Z,"To the Editor: Re ''Spring in Your Steps'' (April 27): Those of us living in the shadow of the ''Gunks,'' the rock cliff featured in the article, recognized Castle Point immediately. Your writer appreciated the fantastic panoramas from Minnewaska State Park Preserve and commented that ''the valley below seemed beautifully empty of overdevelopment.'' True, but that is only because of the efforts of a coalition of community groups, Save the Ridge, culminating last year in the court-ordered sale of a huge parcel of land to the Open Space Institute and the Trust for Public Land, for $17 million. This land was then turned over to the state and became part of the park. That magnificent view of the Palmaghatt Ravine is the result of community activism to keep it that way. Enjoy!

I never would have considered myself to be a shopaholic. After all, I give money to charity; that's what I'm about. But that has all changed since I decided to move. I never realized how much stuff I have accumulated over the years. There are the antique gumball machine from Uncle Sonny, the wooden elephant from Cousin Benni and the incredible artwork my mother-in-law painted. I decided I would bring in a consultant to help me sell all these valued things, but the consultant told me how little it's all worth. I considered just packing up my stuff and moving it with me. That was before the moving company hinted at the cost."

Atlantic Theater, 336 West 20th Street, Chelsea, (212) 279-4200. Broadway 'A CHORUS LINE' If you want to know why this show was such a big deal when it opened 31 years ago, you need only experience the thrilling first five minutes of this revival. Otherwise, this archivally exact production, directed by Bob Avian, feels like a vintage car that has been taken out of the garage, polished up and sent on the road once again (2:00). Schoenfeld Theater, 236 West 45th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Ben Brantley) * 'COMPANY' Fire, beckoning and dangerous, flickers beneath the frost of John Doyle's elegant, unexpectedly stirring revival of Stephen Sondheim and George Furth's era-defining musical from 1970, starring a compellingly understated Raúl Esparza. Like Mr. Doyle's ''Sweeney Todd,'' this production finds new clarity of feeling in Sondheim by melding the roles of performers and musicians (2:20). Barrymore Theater, 243 West 47th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley) 'CORAM BOY' Set in 18th-century England, this melodrama about imperiled orphans is big and broad but not particularly deep. With a cast of 40, an orchestra in the pit and bursts of choral music (Handel, mostly) decorating the proceedings, it is tastefully splashy and certainly impressive, but less emotionally engaging than you might hope (2:30). Imperial Theater, 249 West 45th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Charles Isherwood) 'CURTAINS' This musical comedy about a musical-comedy murder -- featuring songs by John Kander and Fred Ebb and a book by Rupert Holmes -- lies on the stage like a promisingly gaudy string of firecrackers, waiting in vain for a match. The good news is that David Hyde Pierce, playing a diffident Boston detective, steps into full-fledged Broadway stardom. Scott Ellis directs a talent-packed cast that includes Debra Monk and Karen Ziemba. (2:30). Al Hirschfeld Theater, 302 West 45th Street, Clinton, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley) 'DEUCE' Back on Broadway for the first time in 25 years, Angela Lansbury is so vitally and indelibly present that she even gives flesh to this flimsy comedy. Terrence McNally's play, about the reunion of two former doubles partners (Ms. Lansbury and Marian Seldes), is a jerry-built shrine to enduring star power. Directed by Michael Blakemore (1:45). Music Box Theater, 239 West 45th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley) * 'FROST/NIXON' Frank Langella turns in a truly titanic performance as Richard M. Nixon in Peter Morgan's briskly entertaining, if all-too-tidy, play about the former president's annihilating television interviews with the British talk show host David Frost (the excellent Michael Sheen). Michael Grandage directs with the momentum of a ticking-bomb thriller and the zing of a boulevard comedy (1:40). Jacobs Theater, 242 West 45th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley) * 'GREY GARDENS' Christine Ebersole is absolutely glorious as the middle-aged, time-warped debutante called Little Edie Beale in this uneven musical adaptation of the notorious 1975 documentary of the same title. She and the wonderful Mary Louise Wilson (as her bedridden mother), in the performances of their careers, make ''Grey Gardens'' an experience no passionate theatergoer should miss (2:40). Walter Kerr Theater, 219 West 48th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley) 'INHERIT THE WIND' Doug Hughes's wooden revival of this worthy war horse, based on the Scopes ''monkey'' trial of 1925, never musters much more velocity than a drugstore fan. Be grateful that the cast includes Christopher Plummer, in savory form as a Will Rogers of jurisprudence. An oddly subdued Brian Dennehy plays his pompous adversary (2:00). Lyceum Theater, 149 West 45th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley) * 'JOURNEY'S END' A splendid revival of R. C. Sherriff's 1928 drama of life in the trenches during World War I. Acutely staged (by David Grindley) and acted by a fine ensemble led by Hugh Dancy and Boyd Gaines, this production offers an exemplary presentation of that theatrical rarity, an uncompromising, clear-eyed play about war and the experience of day-to-day combat. An essential ticket (2:40). Belasco Theater, 111 West 44th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley) 'LEGALLY BLONDE' This nonstop sugar rush of a musical about a powder puff who finds her inner power-broker, based on the 2001 film, approximates the experience of eating a jumbo bag of Gummi Bears in one sitting. Flossing between songs is recommended (2:20). Palace Theater, 1564 Broadway, at 47th Street, (212) 307-4100. (Brantley) 'LOVEMUSIK' As Lotte Lenya and Kurt Weill, Donna Murphy and Michael Cerveris turn in stunningly shaded performances in what is, alas, a sluggish, mixed-up bio-musical. Scored with an eclectic sampler of Weill's songs, ''LoveMusik'' strives to achieve chilly distance and cozy intimacy in the same breath. Harold Prince directs; Alfred Uhry wrote the conventionally sentimental book (2:40). Biltmore Theater, 261 West 47th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley) 'MARY POPPINS' This handsome, homily-packed, mechanically ingenious and rather tedious musical, adapted from the P. L. Travers stories and the 1964 film, is ultimately less concerned with inexplicable magic than with practical psychology. Ashley Brown, who sings prettily as the family-mending nanny, looks like Joan Crawford trying to be nice and sounds like Dr. Phil. Directed by Richard Eyre and Matthew Bourne (2:30). New Amsterdam Theater, 214 West 42nd Street, (212) 307-4747. (Brantley) 'LES MISÉRABLES' This premature revival, a slightly scaled-down version of the well-groomed behemoth that closed only three years ago, appears to be functioning in a state of mild sedation. Appealingly sung and freshly orchestrated, this fast-moving adaptation of Victor Hugo's novel isn't sloppy or blurry. But its pulse rate stays well below normal (2:55). Broadhurst Theater, 235 West 44th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley) 'A MOON FOR THE MISBEGOTTEN' Kevin Spacey gives a bizarre, beat-the-clock performance, as lively as a frog on a hot plate, as James Tyrone in this off-kilter revival of Eugene O'Neill's last play. Mercifully, he does not block the view of Eve Best, who maps the contradictory levels of Tyrone's strapping love interest with clarity and intelligence (2:50). Brooks Atkinson Theater, 256 West 47th Street, (212) 307-4100. (Brantley) '110 IN THE SHADE' Is it possible for a performance to be too good? Audra McDonald brings such breadth of skill and depth of feeling to Lonny Price's lukewarm revival of this musical about a love-starved spinster that she threatens to burst the seams of this small, homey musical. She's an overwhelming presence in an underwhelming show (2:30). Studio 54, 254 West 54th Street, (212) 719-1300. (Brantley) 'THE PIRATE QUEEN' How to river-dance your way to the bottom of the ocean, courtesy of the songwriters of ''Les Misérables'' (2:30). Hilton Theater, 213 West 42nd Street, (212) 307-4100. (Brantley) 'RADIO GOLF' The final -- and in dramatic terms, the weakest -- of August Wilson's magnificent 10-play cycle about the African-American experience, ''Radio Golf'' has the crackle of a bustling comedy. But this tale of getting and spending in the 1990s, directed by Kenny Leon, throbs with a lament for a lost time, a lost culture, a lost language (2:30). Cort Theater, 138 West 48th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley) * 'SPRING AWAKENING' Duncan Sheik and Steven Sater's bold adaptation of the Frank Wedekind play is the freshest and most exciting new musical Broadway has seen in some time. Set in 19th-century Germany but with a ravishing rock score, it exposes the splintered emotional lives of adolescents just discovering the joys and sorrows of sex. Performed with brio by a great cast, with supple direction by Michael Mayer and inventive choreography by Bill T. Jones (2:00). Eugene O'Neill Theater, 230 West 49th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Isherwood) * 'TALK RADIO' The most lacerating portrait of a human meltdown this side of a Francis Bacon painting. Playing an abrasive radio talk show host with a God complex, the astounding Liev Schreiber seems to fill the air as inescapably as weather in Robert Falls's gut-grabbing revival of Eric Bogosian's 1987 play (1:40). Longacre Theater, 220 West 48th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley) 'THE YEAR OF MAGICAL THINKING' Joan Didion's arresting but ultimately frustrating adaptation of her best-selling memoir about being blindsided by grief, starring Vanessa Redgrave. The tension between style and emotional content that made the book such a stunner does not translate to the stage. The substance here is in the silences, when the focus shifts from words to Ms. Redgrave's wry, wounded face (1:40). Booth Theater, 222 West 45th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley) Off Broadway 'ALL THE WRONG REASONS: A TRUE STORY OF NEO-NAZIS, DRUG SMUGGLING AND UNDYING LOVE' John Fugelsang's amiable solo show mixes memoir and stand-up comedy in a tale of family, faith and Roman Catholic guilt. Slight but engaging (1:30). New York Theater Workshop, 79 East Fourth Street, East Village, (212) 460-5475. (Isherwood) 'AMERICAN FIESTA' The economist, consultant, preacher and playwright Steven Tomlinson makes his New York stage debut with a one-man show about how it was that he came to collect Fiestaware, the colorful china of the Depression years, which he deploys as a metaphor for just about everything. An astute observer of consumer obsession, Mr. Tomlinson ultimately subordinates much of his clever writing to a tepid and trite political message: that American civic life is a fractured bowl that needs to be put back together. American Fiesta is also about gay marriage, eBay and neuroscience, which is to say that it is about much too much (1:30). Vineyard Theater, 108 East 15th Street, Flatiron district, (212) 353-0303. (Ginia Bellafante) 'BAD BLOOD (MALASANGRE)' A wife is offered a lucrative job in Texas; her husband moves with her from Puerto Rico but rails against the condition of being a Latino in the United States. Presented in Spanish and English on different nights, this play by Roberto Ramos Perea is full of ideas and anger, but the political fury of the husband is not, in the English version, completely borne out by his characterization, and you can see the charting of the play a little too clearly between the lines. (2:30). Puerto Rican Traveling Theater, 304 West 47th Street, Clinton, (212) 354-1293. (Anne Midgette) 'BE' A high-energy, low-content Israeli show that blends music, dance and sex appeal in the latest attempt to tap into the ''Stomp'' market (1:30). Union Square Theater, 100 East 17th Street, Flatiron district, (212) 307-4100. (Jason Zinoman) 'BEAUTY ON THE VINE' Zak Berkman presents muddled politics and distorted anxieties in his quasi science-fiction play about the influence of plastic surgery on young women who start modeling themselves after a right-wing radio host. Adding to the atmosphere of hysteria is the inability of the actors to render a single subtle or nuanced moment (2:10). Harold Clurman Theater, 412 West 42nd Street, Clinton, (212) 279-4200. (Bellafante) 'BILL W. AND DR. BOB' This insightful new play about the founders of Alcoholics Anonymous subtly makes the claim that the recovery movement was born as a series of accidents. Patrick Husted is excellent as Bob Smith, Bill Wilson's partner in combating addictions (2:15). New World Stages, 340 West 50th Street, Clinton, (212) 239-6200. (Bellafante) 'BIOGRAPHY' A revival of S. N. Behrman's hoary 1932 comedy about a society portraitist and the men who keep trying to reign her in feels slight as a needlepoint pillow. As the play's supposedly beguiling heroine, Marion Froude, Carolyn McCormick never beguiles (2:15). The Pearl Theater, 80 St. Mark's Place, at First Avenue, East Village, (212) 598-9802. (Bellafante) * 'BLACKBIRD' David Harrower's stunning new drama looks back at a sexual relationship -- between a 40-year-old man and a 12-year-old girl -- that transforms, cripples and paralyzes. Jeff Daniels and Alison Pill, both extraordinary, peel their characters down to their barest souls. Joe Mantello is the masterly director (1:30). Manhattan Theater Club at City Center Stage I, 131 West 55th Street, (212) 581-1212. (Brantley) 'THE BRIG' Serious students of the stage will want to check out the Living Theater's first revival since 1963 of Kenneth H. Brown's docudrama about the soul-shredding grind of daily life in a Marine Corps prison, once again directed by the company co-founder Judith Malina. One of the most celebrated productions in the company's history, ''The Brig'' harks back to an era when theater was at the forefront of both political and artistic radicalism (2:00). Living Theater, 21 Clinton Street, Lower East Side, www.livingtheatre.org. (Isherwood) 'THE FANTASTICKS' A revival -- well, more like a resuscitation -- of the Little Musical That Wouldn't Die. This sweet-as-ever production of Tom Jones and Harvey Schmidt's commedia-dell'arte-style confection is most notable for Mr. Jones's touching performance (under the pseudonym Thomas Bruce) as the Old Actor, a role he created when the show opened in 1960. Mr. Jones also directs (2:05). Snapple Theater Center, 210 West 50th Street, (212) 307-4100. (Brantley) 'GOD'S EAR' Jenny Schwartz's formally inventive and brilliantly performed drama about how the death of a child affects a family is more interested in language than in narrative (1:20). East 13th Street Theater, 136 East 13th Street, East Village, (212) 868-4444. (Zinoman) * 'IN THE HEIGHTS' Lin-Manuel Miranda's joyous songs paint a vibrant portrait of daily life in Washington Heights in this flawed but enjoyable show. Essentially a valentine to the barrio -- conflict of a violent or desperate kind is banished from the picture -- the musical contains a host of funny performances and brings the zesty sound of Latin pop to the stage. (2:10). 37 Arts, 450 West 37th Street, (212) 307-4100. (Isherwood) 'A JEW GROWS IN BROOKLYN' You don't have to be Jewish or Brooklynish to empathize with Jake Ehrenreich, but in terms of fully appreciating his essentially one-man show, it probably helps. Especially the Catskills jokes (2:05). 37 Arts, 450 West 37th Street, (212) 560-8912. (Anita Gates) 'MOTHER LOAD' In her one-woman show on the perils of affluent motherhood, Amy Wilson derides the culture of obsessive child-rearing as she chronicles her submission to it. An affable presence onstage, Ms. Wilson nevertheless mines overly clichéd territory: the nut allergies, the horrors of preschool admission, the importance of knowing two languages by the time you are 3. Posters on Urbanbaby.com will find themselves amusedly looking in the mirror. All other New Yorkers will find themselves wanting to move to Patagonia (1:15). Sage Theater, 711 Seventh Avenue, at 47th Street, (212) 279-4200. (Bellafante) 'MY MOTHER'S ITALIAN, MY FATHER'S JEWISH AND I'M IN THERAPY' Steve Solomon does skillful impersonations in his one-man show, but some of his jokes are as old as the hills (1:30).Westside Theater Downstairs, 407 West 43rd Street, (212) 239-6200. (Gates) 'NO CHILD' Teachers will love Nilaja Sun's one-woman show about the challenges of teaching drama at Malcolm X High School (1:10). Barrow Street Theater, 27 Barrow Street, at Seventh Avenue South, West Village, (212) 239-6200. (Gates) 'THE RECeiPT' A lost bar receipt provides a one-way ticket to bedlam in a clever and diverting show that mirrors the idiosyncrasies of modern life as two young archaeologists study a ''lost'' city and postulate on a day in the life of one of its inhabitants (1:15). 59E59 Theaters, 59 East 59th Street, (212) 279-4200. (Wilborn Hampton) * 'SPALDING GRAY: STORIES LEFT TO TELL' A disarming collage of selections from the monologues and journals of Mr. Gray, the ultimate stand-up solipsist, who died in 2004. Directed by Lucy Sexton, and read by five performers, none of whom resemble Mr. Gray, with an affection that shrewdly stops short of hero worship (1:30). Minetta Lane Theater, 18 Minetta Lane, Greenwich Village, (212) 307-4100. (Brantley) * 'WEST MOON STREET' Rob Urbinati's adaptation of Oscar Wilde's short story ''Lord Arthur Savile's Crime'' delightfully mines a comedy of manners, a meditation on premarital fear, out of a clever mystery on fate. The performances, one and all, are first-rate (2:00). Hudson Guild Theater, 441 West 26th Street, Chelsea, (212) 352-3101. (Bellafante) Off Off Broadway 'OCTOPUS LOVE STORY' Gay marriage is a theme of this sitcomlike drama about a political protest turned unlikely romance (1:30). Center Stage, 48 West 21st Street, Chelsea, (212) 868-4444. (Zinoman) 'ON THE VERGE' An amusing revival of Eric Overmyer's play about three Victoria-era ladies who set out, armed with parasols and machetes, to explore a terra incognita. As they ''whack the bushes'' into virgin territory, they soon discover they are traveling into the future (2:00). Connelly Theater, 220 East Fourth Street, East Village, (212) 777-4280). (Hampton) 'REALISM' and 'JUMP!' The stately Jean Cocteau Repertory (now known as the Exchange) gets a hipster makeover with two foul-mouthed and aggressive new provocations from Britain (1:30 each). Kirk Theater, 420 West 42nd Street, Clinton, (212) 279-4200. (Zinoman) 'THE SEA' This odd 1973 play by Edward Bond gets a vivid production by the Actors Company Theater, but be forewarned: this ain't American humor. It's the sly, incongruous British variety. A fatal shipwreck off the coast of an eclectic little village turns the inhabitants even weirder than they already are. One fellow is convinced that space aliens are behind the wreck (2:20). Beckett Theater, 410 West 42nd Street, Clinton, (212) 279-4200. (Neil Genzlinger) Long-Running Shows 'ALTAR BOYZ' This sweetly satirical show about a Christian pop group made up of five potential Teen People cover boys is an enjoyable, silly diversion (1:30). New World Stages, 340 West 50th Street, Clinton, (212) 239-6200. (Isherwood) 'AVENUE Q' R-rated puppets give lively life lessons (2:10). Golden Theater, 252 West 45th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley) 'BEAUTY AND THE BEAST' Cartoon made flesh, sort of (2:30). Lunt-Fontanne Theater, 205 West 46th Street, (212) 307-4747. (Brantley) 'CHICAGO' Irrefutable proof that crime pays (2:25).

Gershwin Theater, 222 West 51st Street, Manhattan, (212) 307-4100. (Brantley) Last Chance 'THE BIG VOICE: GOD OR MERMAN?' Think of two gifted and smart gay men with years of life together deploying their considerable talents from the two pianos you happen to have in your living room. The result is a hilarious and very touching memoir of two decades of love and the funky glories of show business life (2:00). Actors Temple Theater, 339 West 47th Street, Clinton, (212) 239-6200; closes on Sunday. (Honor Moore) * 'THE COAST OF UTOPIA' Lincoln Center Theater's brave, gorgeous, sprawling and ultimately exhilarating production of Tom Stoppard's trilogy about intellectuals errant in 19th-century Russia. A testament to the seductive powers of narrative theater, directed with hot and cool canniness by Jack O'Brien and featuring a starry cast (Brian F. O'Byrne, Jennifer Ehle, Martha Plimpton, Josh Hamilton and Ethan Hawke, among others) in a tasty assortment of roles. Vivian Beaumont Theater, 150 West 65th Street, Lincoln Center, (212) 239-6200; closes on Sunday. (Brantley) 'DENIAL' An engrossing and timely legal drama about a Holocaust denier being defended by a Jewish lawyer, this play examines the moral and ethical dilemma inherent in the First Amendment and asks how much sufferance can a free society give its crackpots and maintain its individual liberties (2:30). Metropolitan Playhouse, 220 East Fourth Street, East Village, (212) 995-5302; closes on Sunday. (Hampton) 'EXPOSED: EXPERIMENTS IN LOVE, SEX, DEATH AND ART' Annie Sprinkle and Elizabeth Stephens, partners in life and art, share memories of their colorful history together. Donning lab coats, they also engage the audience in some informal experiments intended to increase the store of love in the world. Sloppy but somewhat sweet (1:30). Collective: Unconscious, 279 Church Street, at White Street, TriBeCa, (212) 352-3101; closes tomorrow. (Isherwood) Movies Ratings and running times are in parentheses; foreign films have English subtitles. Full reviews of all current releases, movie trailers, show times and tickets: nytimes.com/movies. * 'AWAY FROM HER' (PG-13, 110 minutes) Sarah Polley's well-observed adaptation of a story by Alice Munro is a quiet tour de force about love and loss, anchored by fine performances by Gordon Pinsent and Julie Christie as a couple dealing with the loss of memory and memories of past hurt. (A. O. Scott) 'Blades of Glory' (PG-13, 93 minutes) In this fast, light, frequently funny comedy about a male figure-skating team, Will Ferrell and Jon Heder stake an early claim to being the comedy couple of the year. (Stephen Holden) * 'BRAND UPON THE BRAIN' (No rating, 96 minutes) A baroque entertainment with one foot in silent cinema and the other gingerly toeing the sound waves, Guy Maddin's latest centers on a man who, in visiting the now-emptied foundling home, journeys deep into his childhood. It's wild! It's weird! It's strangely touching and a total must see! (Manohla Dargis) THE CONDEMNED' (R, 100 minutes) This simple-minded vehicle for the wrestling star Steve Austin follows a bunch of muscle-bound lowlifes as they fight to the death for the benefit of an Internet reality show. Leaden and inept, the movie fails to deliver even the action goods, presenting every fight scene in such quaking, extreme close-up that it's difficult to tell who's pummeling whom. Fortunately, the language of pain is universal. (Jeannette Catsoulis) * 'DAY NIGHT DAY NIGHT' (No rating, 94 minutes) For most of its 94 minutes, this gripping but evasive portrait of an unidentified 19-year-old terrorist undertaking a suicide bombing mission in Times Square focuses on the face of its star, Luisa Williams. (Holden) * 'DIGGERS' (R, 90 minutes) This minutely observed period piece, set in 1976, about clam diggers on the south shore of Long Island, has the brave, mournful tone of a Springsteen song (''My Hometown,'' say) set in Billy Joel territory. ( Holden) 'DISTURBIA' (PG-13, 104 minutes) A pleasant, scary, well-directed variation on the killer-next-door theme, with the engaging Shia LeBeouf as Kale, a young man who turns house arrest into an occasion for voyeurism and crime-fighting. (Scott) * 'ELECTION' (No rating, 100 minutes, in Cantonese) This intricate gangster entertainment, the first episode in a two-part sequence from the prolific Hong Kong action maestro Johnnie To, offers some acute lessons in the pitfalls of democracy. Also a feast of fighting, humor and fine acting, in particular from Simon Yaw, who plays a soft-spoken, businesslike candidate for chairman of Hong Kong's oldest criminal organization. (Scott) 'FRACTURE' (R, 111 minutes) A glib entertainment that offers up the spectacle of that crafty scene-stealer Anthony Hopkins mixing it up with that equally cunning screen-nibbler Ryan Gosling. (Dargis) * 'THE HOAX' (R, 115 minutes) A first-rate performance by Richard Gere drives this true story of Clifford Irving (Mr. Gere), who claimed to be the authorized biographer of Howard Hughes. Shadowed by the paranoia of its period (the early '70s), this movie, crisply directed by Lasse Hallstrom from an excellent script by William Weaver, is less a morality play than an entertaining portrait of a literary gambler. (Scott) * 'HOT FUZZ' (R, 121 minutes) A British parody of Hollywood-style action flicks from the wits behind ''Shaun of the Dead.'' Think of it as ''The Full Monty'' blown to smithereens. (Dargis) 'IN THE LAND OF WOMEN' (PG-13, 98 minutes) This meek, mopey comedy is the film equivalent of a sensitive emo band with one foot in alternative rock and the other in the squishy pop mainstream. The movie would like to think of itself as a softer, fuzzier ''Garden State.'' (Holden) 'THE INVISIBLE' (PG-13, 102 minutes) This supremely silly retread of the 2002 Swedish film ''Den Osynlige'' proves it's tough to be in love and in limbo at one and the same time. When a rich-yet-troubled teenager (Justin Chatwin) crosses paths with a violently disturbed classmate (Margarita Levieva), we learn that there's nothing quite like a near-death experience to repair those stubborn emotional wounds. (Catsoulis) * 'KILLER OF SHEEP' (No rating, 83 minutes) Largely hidden from view for three decades, Charles Burnett's lyrical film about a working-class family living in a broken-down home in a bombed-out stretch of Los Angeles is an American masterpiece. (Dargis) 'LUCKY YOU' (PG-13, 124 minutes) Eric Bana plays a poker player with daddy issues (Robert Duvall is his dad), and Drew Barrymore is an aspiring singer who catches his eye in this tepid Las Vegas romance. It's not terrible, just content to break even. (Scott) 'MEET THE ROBINSONS' (G, 93 minutes) Actually, if you see them coming, run in the other direction. (Scott) 'NEXT' (PG-13, 96 minutes) Nicolas Cage plays a guy who can see into the future in this crummy adaptation of a nifty Philip K. Dick story. Too bad Mr. Cage couldn't tap into those same powers to save himself from another bad role. (Dargis) 'PARIS JE T'AIME' (R, 120 minutes, in French and English) ''Paris Je T'Aime,'' a mosaic of 18 miniatures, each set in a different location in the City of Light, is a cinematic tasting menu consisting entirely of amuse-bouches. After two hours of such tidbits, the palate is sated. But if there is no need for a main course, you still leave feeling vaguely disappointed at not being served one. (Holden) 'PERFECT STRANGER' (R, 109 minutes) There is enough of a grain of truth in this noirish, paranoid thriller set in the New York media world that even after it lurches from the farfetched into the preposterous, the movie leaves a clammy residue of unease. (Holden) * 'PRIVATE FEARS IN PUBLIC PLACES' (No rating, 120 minutes, in French) A film from the venerable French auteur Alain Resnais about love and cinematic spaces, elegant camera moves and six heavenly bodies as seen through a mighty telescope. (Dargis) * 'RED ROAD' (No rating, 113 minutes) Andrea Arnold's first feature falls into melodrama and implausibility at the end, but along the way it is a remarkably assured and complex piece of work, anchored by the director's formal control and by Jackie Dick's quietly heartbreaking performance as a Glasgow video-surveillance officer with an unhappy past. (Scott) 'SPIDER-MAN 3' (PG-13, 139 minutes) Please, God, make this be the last one. (Dargis) 'TA RA RUM PUM' (No rating, 156 minutes, in English and Hindi) This Bollywood movie about a race car driver (the versatile Saif Ali Khan) takes place in New York, but that doesn't stop it from being a classic example of Bollywood family values. Here, all the city's a stage set, perfect for ''Fame''-meets-''West Side Story'' production numbers. (Rachel Saltz) '300' (R, 116 minutes) Greeks versus Persians in the big rumble at Thermopylae, via Frank Miller's graphic novel. As dumb as they get. (Scott) 'THE TREATMENT' (No rating, 86 minutes) Oren Rydavsky's adaptation of the Daniel Menaker novel about love and psychoanalysis in New York has its heart and head in the right place, but not much else, including its sympathetic stars, Chris Eigeman, Famke Janssen and Ian Holm. (Dargis) * 'TRIAD ELECTION' (No rating, 93 minutes, in Cantonese) The surfaces gleam as luxuriously in Johnnie To's exemplary gangster thriller ''Triad Election'' as those in a similarly slicked-up Hollywood film, but the blood on the floor here seems stickier, more liable to stain. A brutal look at the shadows darkening the Hong Kong triads, the film picks up the narrative line first coiled and kinked in Mr. To's companion thriller, ''Election.'' (Dargis) 'VACANCY' (R, 80 minutes) This banal horror retread involves a couple of critters (Luke Wilson, Kate Beckinsale) flailing inside a sticky trap for what is, in effect, the big-screen equivalent of a roach motel. (Dargis) * 'THE VALET' (PG-13, 85 minutes, in French) If you love to hate the superrich, this delectable comedy, in which the great French actor Daniel Auteuil portrays a piggy billionaire industrialist facing his comeuppance, is a sinfully delicious bonbon, a classic French farce with modern touches. (Holden) * 'WAITRESS' (PG-13, 104 minutes) Keri Russell is a small-town waitress in a bad marriage who finds solace in pie-baking and adultery in Adrienne Shelly's wry and winning final feature. (Scott) * 'YEAR OF THE DOG' (PG-13, 97 minutes) Mike White's touching comedy about a woman who loses a dog and finds herself is funny ha-ha but firmly in touch with its downer side, which means that it's also funny in a kind of existential way. Molly Shannon stars alongside a menagerie of howling scene-stealers. (Dargis) 'ZOO' (No rating, 76 minutes) Robinson Devor's heavily reconstructed documentary is, to a large extent, about the rhetorical uses of beauty. It is, rather more coyly, also about a man who died after having sex with a stallion. (Dargis) Film Series and Revivals GENERATION GARREL (Today through Thursday) In France, Philippe Garrel occupies a position in the avant-garde somewhere between John Cassavetes (for his love of garrulous actors and messy dramatic situations) and Andy Warhol (for his love-hate relationship with glamour and stardom). This series widens the focus to include two other members of the Garrel family: his father, Maurice, and his son Louis, both actors. The 23-year-old Louis opens the program tonight with a sneak preview of ''Dans Paris,'' the new film by the promising young director Christophe Honoré (whose 2004 ''Ma Mere,'' also with Louis, plays on Sunday). Tomorrow's schedule includes Philippe's 2005 ''Regular Lovers,'' a film about the depressing aftermath of the social unrest of 1968. On Wednesday the 84-year-old Maurice takes center stage for Philippe's 1983 ''Liberté, la nuit,'' in which he stars as an aging activist caught up in the protests surrounding the Algerian war. And on Thursday the whole family (including Louis's mother, the actress Brigitte Sy) turns up in ''Emergency Kisses'' (1988), an autobiographical film about a director (Philippe) making an autobiographical film. BAMcinématek, BAM Rose Cinemas, 30 Lafayette Avenue, at Ashland Place, Fort Greene, Brooklyn, (718) 636-4100, bam.org; $10. (Dave Kehr) 10 LATIN AMERICAN & SPANISH FILMS FROM THE LAST 100 YEARS (Tonight through Thursday) As part of the High Line Festival, the Quad Cinema will screen movies by Spanish and Latin American filmmakers. The series opens at 7:30 tonight with ''El Automovil Gris'' (1919), a Mexican crime film by Enrique Rosas Priego and presented here by the Mexican theater company El Teatro de Ciertos Habitantes. The 10 o'clock show is Alberto Gout's entertaining 1949 ''Aventurera,'' a lurid ''cabaretera'' melodrama about a girl from the sticks (Ninón Sevilla) kidnapped by human traffickers. Other highlights include, tomorrow, Tomas Gutierrez Alea's ''Memorias del Subdesarrollo'' (1968), one of the finest products of Cuban cinema, and, on Tuesday, Luis Bunuel's 1954 English-language, made-in-Mexico ''Robinson Crusoe'' and Victor Erice's dark and lyrical 1973 Spanish film about the terrors of childhood, ''El Espíritu de la Colmena.'' Quad Cinema, 34 West 13th Street, Greenwich Village, (212) 255-8800, highlinefestival.com; $12; $35 for ''El Automovil Gris.'' (Kehr) Pop Full reviews of recent concerts: nytimes.com/music. THE ALBUM LEAF, YOUNG GALAXY (Tomorrow and Sunday) Jimmy LaValle, one of the guitarists in the San Diego band Tristeza, creates peaceful, glittering galaxies of electronics and soft guitar in his mostly instrumental side project, the Album Leaf. For a group called a duo, Montreal's Young Galaxy had an awful lot of people onstage at its last New York appearance -- the better to help make that languorous wash of guitars and sleepy vocals. With Belong. Tomorrow at 8:30 p.m., Maxwell's, 1039 Washington Street, Hoboken, N.J., (201) 653-1703, maxwellsnj.com; $15. Sunday at 7:30 p.m., Bowery Ballroom, 6 Delancey Street, near the Bowery, Lower East Side, (212) 533-2111, boweryballroom.com; $15. (Ben Sisario) LOS AMIGOS INVISIBLES (Tomorrow) Los Amigos Invisibles, from Venezuela, latch on to dance grooves from the last three decades -- James Brown funk, the stolid thump of house music, mid-1960s boogaloo, '70s Miami disco, Santana's mambo-rock, even some rap -- while the lyrics (in Spanish) are come-ons somewhere between charm and smarm. With DJ Afro and Todosantos. At 9 p.m., Bowery Ballroom, 6 Delancey Street, near the Bowery, Lower East Side, (212) 533-2111, boweryballroom.com; $22. (Jon Pareles) LAURIE ANDERSON (Thursday) Ms. Anderson's entrancing performances weave coolly surrealistic songs and reflective monologues with a witty, seamless dream logic. She unveils a new piece as part of David Bowie's High Line Festival. At 7:30 p.m., Highline Ballroom, 431 West 16th Street, Chelsea, (212) 414-5994, highlineballroom.com or highlinefestival.com; $37. (Sisario) * ARCTIC MONKEYS (Tuesday) Emerging from Sheffield, England, a couple of years ago as an unstoppable teenage indie-rock machine, Arctic Monkeys played perfect, cutting post-punk riffs and sang of night-life exhaustion with a jadedness beyond their years. Now, with the members barely into their 20s, the band has returned with ''Favourite Worst Nightmare'' (Domino), and thankfully not much has changed: danceable, slashing grooves and sneered lyrics about the morning-after blahs. With Be Your Own Pet. At 6:30 p.m., Hammerstein Ballroom, 311 West 34th Street, Manhattan, (212) 307-7171, mcstudios.com; sold out. (Sisario) ANDREW BIRD (Thursday) A talented multi-instrumentalist, Mr. Bird shows off his fiddle- and guitar-playing in wistful, fantastical folk reveries. But his most impressive technique is not on fiddle or guitar, nor on the electronic effects that he uses to make the music breathe; it's his dexterous, expressive whistling, which floats high above in eerily beautiful tones. With Joan as Policewoman. At 7 p.m., Webster Hall, 125 East 11th Street, East Village, (212) 533-2111, bowerypresents.com; sold out. (Sisario) BARBARA CARROLL (Sunday and Monday) Elegant, witty and touching, this classically trained jazz pianist and singer, now 82, is in her prime: the female counterpart of Bobby Short. Sunday at 2 p.m., Monday at 8 p.m., Oak Room at the Algonquin Hotel, 59 West 44th Street, Manhattan, (212) 419-9331, algonquinhotel.com; $58 on Sunday, with brunch at noon; $40 on Monday, with a $20 minimum. (Stephen Holden) * ELVIS COSTELLO AND THE IMPOSTORS (Wednesday) Jazz and classical pursuits may command more and more of his time these days, but Mr. Costello is still at his best leading his band through a set of taut, squirmy soul-rock. At 8 p.m., Nokia Theater, 1515 Broadway, at 44th Street, (212) 307-7171, nokiatheatrenyc.com; sold out. (Sisario) DAN DEACON (Tomorrow) This Baltimore partymeister has become an underground celebrity playing the kind of music Max Headroom might have made, with low-tech synthesizers pumping manic, smarmy melodies at high volume and accelerated tempo. Channeled through Mr. Deacon's antic stage persona, it all becomes house-rocking sensory overload. With Ponytail, Meneguar and Lions and Tigers. At 8:30 p.m., Mercury Lounge, 217 East Houston Street, at Ludlow Street, Lower East Side, (212) 260-4700, mercuryloungenyc.com; $8 in advance, $10 at the door. (Sisario) * DEERHOOF (Thursday) With scratchy guitars set against Satomi Matsuzaki's nursery rhyme vocals, and songs that zip through multiple personality changes, Deerhoof, from San Francisco, makes jarringly experimental art-pop that somehow remains inviting and sweet. The band plays as part of the High Line Festival with Dirty Projectors, who build elaborate ''glitch operas'' with stark pluckings of strings and precise, ecstatic harmonies; and Robert Stillman's Horses. At 9 p.m., Fillmore New York at Irving Plaza, 17 Irving Place, at 15th Street, Manhattan, (212) 777-6800, highlinefestival.com; $16.50. (Sisario) ELECTRELANE (Tuesday) The women of this British quartet have found a middle ground between Stereolab's ethereal drone and the earthy twee-pop of groups like the Pastels. ''No Shouts, No Calls'' (Too Pure), their new album, has a rock 'n' roll pulse even at its most tranquil. With Tender Forever and the Blow. At 9 p.m., Fillmore New York at Irving Plaza, 17 Irving Place, at 15th Street, Manhattan, (212) 777-6800; $15. (Sisario) TIM FINN (Tomorrow) When Mr. Finn sings about ''the warm Pacific sun,'' he's talking about good times not in California but in New Zealand, where he has been a star since his days in the new wave band Split Enz (and, on and off, in Crowded House with his brother Neil). On his latest album, ''Imaginary Kingdom'' (Manhattan), he offers a familiar New World optimism over Beatlesesque melodies, shaking his head at naysayers in history and romance: ''When they say it can't be done, we have to prove them wrong.'' He plays a rare solo show at Joe's Pub. At 7:30 p.m., 425 Lafayette Street, at Astor Place, East Village, (212) 967-7555, joespub.com; $25. (Sisario) * DANIEL JOHNSTON, BANG ON A CAN ALL-STARS, THE LEGENDARY STARDUST COWBOY (Wednesday) In a feat of inspired programming, David Bowie has put together this bill for his High Line Festival, with some of the brainiest of the New York avant-garde (Bang on a Can All-Stars) meeting two of Texas's most extreme outsider musicians. Daniel Johnston writes stirringly candid songs that sound as if they could be the dreams or nightmares of John Lennon. The Legendary Stardust Cowboy has earned an indelible rock footnote: his wild 1968 song ''Paralyzed'' inspired Mr. Bowie to create his glam-era alter ego Ziggy Stardust. At 8 p.m., Highline Ballroom, 431 West 16th Street, Chelsea, (212) 414-5994, highlineballroom.com or highlinefestival.com; sold out. Mr. Johnston also plays Tuesday at 8 p.m. at Warsaw, 261 Driggs Avenue, at Eckford Street, Greenpoint, Brooklyn, (718) 387-0505, warsawconcerts.com; $18. The Legendary Stardust Cowboy plays Thursday at 9 p.m. at Maxwell's, 1039 Washington Street, Hoboken, N.J., (201) 653-1703, maxwellsnj.com; $10. (Sisario) ANGÉLIQUE KIDJO (Wednesday) On her new album, ''Djin Djin'' (Razor & Tie), this Beninese singer welcomes a handful of guest stars -- Josh Groban, Joss Stone and Alicia Keys, among others -- into the orbit of her humanist Afro-pop. But the album's best moments come when Ms. Kidjo engages with a strong supporting cast, as she will here. At 8 p.m., B. B. King Blues Club & Grill, 237 West 42nd Street, (212) 997-4144, bbkingblues.com; $32 in advance, $36 at the door. (Nate Chinen) * KIKI AND HERB (Sunday and Thursday) A few years ago this brilliantly perverse cabaret duo played their farewell show at Carnegie Hall. Then came a run on Broadway. And the inimitable Christmas show. After playing their regular Sunday night Joe's Pub gig this week, Kiki and Herb go to the Knitting Factory on Thursday to record a new DVD. Sunday at 11:30 p.m., 425 Lafayette Street, at Astor Place, East Village, (212) 967-7555, joespub.com; $20, Thursday at 8 p.m., 74 Leonard Street, TriBeCa, (212) 219-3132, knittingfactory.com; $20. (Sisario) LCD SOUNDSYSTEM (Tomorrow and Monday) James Murphy's punk-edged disco in LCD Soundsystem -- sharp and sexy but unapologetically silly, retro but smartly innovative -- has roots across the dance-rock map but is unmistakably a product of New York: ''Those of you who still think we're from England/We're not,'' he sings with adenoidal wryness on the band's brilliant new album, ''Sound of Silver'' (Capitol). With Yacht. Tomorrow at 9 p.m., Studio B, 259 Banker Street, between Meserole Avenue and Calyer Street, Greenpoint, Brooklyn, (718) 389-1880, clubstudiob.com; $20. Monday at 7:30 p.m., Webster Hall, 125 East 11th Street, East Village, (212) 533-2111, bowerypresents.com; sold out. (Sisario) * STEPHEN MARLEY (Tonight) It sometimes seems as if there is a paratrooper brigade of young Marleys arriving on the reggae and pop scenes: first there was Ziggy and others in the Melody Makers, then Damian, then Ky-Mani and Julian. But Stephen Marley, 35, who rapped as a teenager on early Melody Makers songs, has the distinction of being a strong songwriter and a Grammy-winning producer. He has just released his debut album, ''Mind Control'' (Universal Republic), which features tales of incarceration over marijuana and lots of guest spots by -- who else? -- other Marleys. This show will feature his younger brother Damian (a k a Junior Gong), for whom he produced the hit ''Welcome to Jamrock.'' At 9, Nokia Theater, 1515 Broadway, at 44th Street, (212) 307-7171, nokiatheatrenyc.com; sold out. (Sisario) * MASTODON, AGAINST ME!, CURSIVE (Thursday) Until Mastodon released ''Leviathan'' three years ago, the world lacked an extreme-metal album based on ''Moby-Dick''; it's appropriately dense and exhilarating and fully attentive to every slashing sonic detail, as is this Atlanta band's latest, ''Blood Mountain.'' Also on this unusual but intriguing bill: Against Me!, punk eccentrics from Gainesville, Fla., who specialize in roaring, galloping folk songs; and Cursive, a band from Omaha with one foot in emo and the other in exuberant chamber-pop. At 6:15 p.m., Roseland Ballroom, 239 West 52nd Street, Manhattan, (212) 777-6800, roselandballroom.com; $25 in advance, $28 at the door. (Sisario) NO FUN FEST (Thursday) Now something of a spring tradition, this four-day festival of noise-rock -- and any other kind of avant-garde music, as long as it's clamorous and loud -- begins on Thursday with Hair Police, from the fertile Michigan scene; Yoshimi of the Boredoms with Kim Gordon of Sonic Youth; Pain Jerk; Hive Mind and Damion Romero; Lambsbread; Evil Moisture; Crumbling; and Orphan Fairytale. Take earplugs. At 7 p.m., the Hook, 18 Commerce Street, near Richards Street, Red Hook, Brooklyn, (718) 797-3007, thehookmusic.com or nofunfest.com; $18. (Sisario) JENNIFER O'CONNOR (Wednesday) Ms. O'Connor's portraits of the lovelorn and depressed, sung over light strums of guitar with the guileless vulnerability of a 2 a.m. phone confession, are dry but not unsympathetic: ''Maybe she's on her lunch break thinking of you.'' She has a Wednesday residency this month at the Living Room. At 11 p.m., 154 Ludlow Street, near Stanton Street, Lower East Side, (212) 533-7235, livingroomny.com; $8. (Sisario) * JOHN PIZZARELLI AND JESSICA MOLASKEY (Tonight and tomorrow night, and Tuesday through Thursday) These married musicians have been called ''the Nick and Nora of cabaret,'' a sobriquet that only begins to describe their upbeat sophistication. They fuse two distantly related musical worlds into a larger whole in which Stephen Sondheim, Dave Frishberg, Paul Simon, and Lambert, Hendricks and Ross join hands. (Through May 26.) At 8:45, with additional shows tonight and tomorrow night at 10:45, Café Carlyle, at the Carlyle Hotel, 35 East 76th Street, Manhattan, (212) 744-1600, thecarlyle.com; $75 and $125 Tuesday through Thursday; $85 tonight and tomorrow. (Holden) * DUNCAN SHEIK (Tuesday) Broadway gigs are usually not important creative turning points for pop songwriters. But ''Spring Awakening'' was the best thing to happen to Mr. Sheik's music in years, giving his silken, phlegmatic songs a youthful and erotic kick. For this show at the Concert Hall at the New York Society for Ethical Culture, he is to play ''Spring Awakening'' material and other songs. At 8 p.m., 2 West 64th Street, Manhattan, (212) 307-7171, concertstonight.com; $35. (Sisario) SLOAN (Tonight) Like modern metafictions, Sloan's pop-rock songs twist inward on themselves. With their winsome tunes and neo-Beatles intricacies, they are not just about unrequited yearnings, but also about the process of writing pop songs about unrequited yearnings. They're rarely so clever that their heart doesn't come through. With Small Sins. At 9 p.m., Southpaw, 125 Fifth Avenue, near Sterling Place, Park Slope, Brooklyn, (718) 230-0236, spsounds.com; $20. (Pareles) SOUTHERN CULTURE ON THE SKIDS (Wednesday) This veteran three-piece from North Carolina knows just how much to poke fun at chicken-fried, backwoods rockabilly: a lot, but not too much to get in the way of some finger-licking twangy guitar. Don't let the band leave without playing its barnstorming ode to Santo, the vigilante Mexican wrestler. With the Dansettes and Jule Brown. At 7:30 p.m., Mercury Lounge, 217 East Houston Street, at Ludlow Street, Lower East Side, (212) 260-4700, mercuryloungenyc.com; $15 in advance, $17 at the door. (Sisario) * SPANISH HARLEM ORCHESTRA (Wednesday) Anyone who's heard a salsa band in New York City has probably seen some of the members of this group: they're the virtuosic journeymen who are one of New York's great musical resources.

Mr. Simon is to appear as a guest on Wednesday. At 10 p.m., S.O.B.'s, 204 Varick Street, at Houston Street, South Village, (212) 243-4940, sobs.com; $20.

Rock/USAdown is a duo of Dave Unger and Joe Johnson, formerly of the Washington noise-rock band Love 666. They've kept the skronk going with their new collaboration, ''This Is the New American National Anthem'' (Feedback), a 47-minute wave of sonic chaos that now and then reflects bits of ''The Star-Spangled Banner.''

(Sisario) LAURA VEIRS (Wednesday) Ms. Veirs's ballads, with electronics twinkling above soft acoustic guitars like stars in a perfect night sky, cast romance as both intimate contact and cosmic event. With Charles Bissell and Lake. At 7 p.m., Blender Theater at Gramercy, 127 East 23rd Street, Manhattan, (212) 307-7171; $14 in advance, $16 at the door.

(Through May 19.) At 9 and 11 p.m., Birdland, 315 West 44th Street, Clinton, (212) 581-3080, birdlandjazz.com; cover, $40, with a $10 minimum.

(Chinen) Classical Full reviews of recent music performances: nytimes.com/music. Opera * 'IL BARBIERE DI SIVIGLIA' (Tonight) Bartlett Sher's breezy production of Rossini's ''Barbiere di Siviglia,'' introduced in November, conveys the comic confusions of the story through its fluid staging and a wonderfully abstract set: a matrix of movable doors, staircases and potted orange trees, behind which the characters spy on one another. The heated sexuality in this tale of romantic intrigue also comes through strongly, thanks to Mr. Sher's subtle direction of a handsome cast. The captivating young mezzo-soprano Joyce DiDonato is a vocally agile and feisty Rosina. The accomplished American tenor Lawrence Brownlee, in his Met debut role, makes a sweet-toned, technically agile and appealing Count Almaviva. The baritone Russell Braun is another standout for his hardy and clever Figaro. Maurizio Benini conducts. Tonight will be the final ''Barbiere'' of the season. At 8, Metropolitan Opera House, Lincoln Center, (212) 362-6000, metopera.org; sold out. (Anthony Tommasini) 'CASTOR ET POLLUX' (Thursday) Rameau was a wonderful opera composer, but since there is not a big market for the French baroque at major opera houses, this is a relatively rare chance to hear one of his operas in New York. The diminutive Opera Français de New York has helped propel the conductor Yves Abel into a larger career, but he returns to it for these two performances (there is another next weekend), featuring talented young singers like the soprano Erin Morley. At 8 p.m., French Institute/Alliance Française, 55 East 59th Street, Manhattan, (212) 355-6160, fiaf.org; $50; $40 for students and members. (Anne Midgette) * 'ORFEO ED EURIDICE' (Tomorrow) In his Met debut, the choreographer Mark Morris has created an often magical and unapologetically fanciful modern-dress production of Gluck's sublime masterpiece ''Orfeo ed Euridice.'' He draws rich portrayals from the elegant and ardent countertenor David Daniels as Orfeo, the earthy soprano Maija Kovalevska as Euridice, and the sweet-toned soprano Heidi Grant Murphy as the god Amor, here a sassy, angelic Ellen DeGeneres look-alike who descends from the skies to intervene in the story. Members of Mr. Morris's company, supplemented by dancers from the Met, are silent participants in the action. But nearly 100 vocally robust choristers portray historical witnesses to the drama, everyone from Henry VIII to Mahatma Gandhi to Princess Di. James Levine conducts a distinguished performance. At 1:30 p.m., Metropolitan Opera House, Lincoln Center, (212) 362-6000, metopera.org; sold out. (Tommasini) * 'IL TRITTICO' (Tomorrow) The Met's season ends tomorrow night with its new ''Trittico,'' Puccini's triptych of one-act operas, which is now officially the most elaborate production in the company's repertory. The director Jack O'Brien has created grandly old-fashioned yet insightful and effective stagings of these three very different operas: ''Il Tabarro,'' a grim love triangle aboard a barge in Paris; ''Suor Angelica,'' a tender, mystical and ultimately devastating story of a young nun's yearning to be with her dead child; and ''Gianni Schicchi,'' an irreverent comedy about the avaricious relatives of a miserly old man who has just died. The earthy soprano Maria Guleghina as the beleaguered barge-owner's wife, the impassioned soprano Barbara Frittoli as Sister Angelica, and the stylish baritone Alessandro Corbelli as the shrewd Schicchi are stand-outs, though the powerhouse mezzo-soprano Stephanie Blythe, who plays three supporting roles, almost steals each show. Joseph Colaneri conducts. At 8 p.m., Metropolitan Opera House, (212) 362-6000, metopera.org; sold out. (Tommasini) * VOX 2007 (Tomorrow and Sunday) ''Showcasing American composers'' is the tag line of City Opera's annual series of readings of contemporary operas-in-progress. Twelve composers, from Robert Aldridge to John Zorn, present excerpts from their works in six afternoon sessions, each preceded by a panel discussion. Tomorrow night four independent groups present new works of their own, including a new ''operina'' by Jack Beeson, as part of the Vox umbrella. Readings begin at noon, performances tomorrow night at 8, Skirball Center for the Performing Arts, 566 La Guardia Place, at Washington Square South, Greenwich Village, (212) 992-8484, nycopera.com; free. (Midgette) Classical Music * PIERRE-LAURENT AIMARD (Tonight) Concerts of excerpts, short works and juggled movements can easily misfire, but if anyone can make something of the format, it is Pierre-Laurent Aimard, one of the more thoughtful pianists performing now. He has, in any case, made this montage approach work in several recent recitals, and the material at hand here holds out fascinating possibilities. Among the composers represented are Boulez, Stockhausen, Kurtag, Liadov, Mussorgsky, Tchaikovsky, Bartok, Webern, Janacek, Schoenberg, Beethoven and Schubert. At 7:30, Zankel Hall, Carnegie Hall, (212) 247-7800, carnegiehall.org; $40 to $48. (Allan Kozinn) AMERICAN STRING QUARTET (Tonight) A prestigious Naumburg Award gave the American String Quartet its start more than 30 years ago.

At 8, Weill Recital Hall, Carnegie Hall, (212) 247-7800, carnegiehall.org; $20. (Tommasini) * ALISON BALSOM (Sunday) The indispensable Free for All at Town Hall series continues with a recital by the trumpeter Alison Balsom. Forging a solo trumpet career is not easy. And almost all the players who have succeeded have been male. But Ms. Balsom, a 27-year-old Brit, is having great success, with two acclaimed EMI Classics recordings already to her credit. She is joined by the Balsom Ensemble for a program of works by Bach, Purcell, Handel, Byrd, Falla and Piazzolla. At 5 p.m., Town Hall, 123 West 43rd Street, Manhattan, (212) 707-8787, freeforallattownhall.org; free tickets will be available at the box office at noon. (Tommasini) BROOKLYN PHILHARMONIC (Tomorrow) Under the leadership of Michael Christie, its dynamic young music director, this orchestra has offered a number of stimulating concerts recently. It closes the season with another intriguing program, featuring the Ridge Theater staging of Gorecki's Symphony No. 3, and Hindemith's ''Mathis der Maler,'' with Nathalie Paulin, a soprano, as soloist. At 8 p.m., Brooklyn Academy of Music, 30 Lafayette Avenue, at Ashland Place, Fort Greene, (718) 636-4100, brooklynphilharmonic.org; $20 to $60.

(Midgette) DISCOVERIES (Tuesday and Wednesday) The Austrian Cultural Forum's final mini-festival of the season features nominally less-known songs, including works by Johan Hoven, who set Heine's cycle ''Die Heimkehr'' -- all 88 poems -- to music. The first program, performed by Elisabeth von Magnus, a mezzo, includes a set of Hoven songs, as well as works by Haydn and a group of familiar works by Mozart. At 8 p.m., 11 East 52nd Street, Manhattan, (212) 319-5300, acfny.org; free, but reservations are required.

Here the program includes a Mozart piano trio, a Dvorak piano quartet and the Shostakovich String Quartet No. 8. At 8, Metropolitan Museum of Art, (212) 570-3949, metmuseum.org; $40. (Holland) * PAUL O'DETTE and ELLEN HARGIS (Tuesday) The soprano Ellen Hargis and the lutenist Paul O'Dette have proved an inventive early-music recital team, and their current program of 17th-century songs and lute solos -- offered as part of the Boston Early Music Festival's New York series -- promises a bit of everything, from love songs and humorous works to heart-rending laments. At 7:30 p.m., Morgan Library & Museum, 225 Madison Avenue, at 36th Street, (212) 685-0008, morganlibrary.org; $45; $35 for members.

Mr. Perlman will announce other works from the stage, adding a whiff of spontaneity to the evening. At 8 p.m., Avery Fisher Hall, Lincoln Center, (212) 721-6500, lincolncenter.org; $35 to $70. (Schweitzer) * MAURIZIO POLLINI (Tomorrow) In his two Carnegie Hall recitals, the pianist Maurizio Pollini is exploring the links between standard repertory works and classic modern scores.

The novelty of the evening is a new pas de deux choreographed by Brian Reeder to a Chopin waltz performed live by the concert pianist Lang Lang. Then it's on to a week of ''La Bayadère,'' complete with pathetic heroines, noble but all-too-human princes, sizzlingly wicked villains and choreography that epitomizes the exquisite purity of classical ballet.

Chase Granoff takes over on Thursday (through May 19) with his new ''BOREDOM!!! (as an amplifier),'' with a score by Jon Moniaci. At 8, the Chocolate Factory, 5-49 49th Avenue, Long Island City, Queens, (212) 352-3101, chocolatefactorytheater.org; $15; free for Queens residents on Thursday.

(Dunning) Liz Sargent (Thursday through Sunday) In ''Revealing,'' Ms. Sargent probes issues of perception and control, employing repetitive movements that play out in Jayme del Rosario's shape-shifting creations. At 8:30 p.m., Danspace Project at St. Mark's Church, 131 East 10th Street, East Village, (212) 674-8194; $15. (La Rocco) * DOUG VARONE AND DANCERS (Thursday) Mr. Varone and his dancers have an understated but profound way with movement, music and performing. His new ''Dense Terrain,'' set to music by Nathan Larson, explores the notion of human connectedness with an emphasis on the language of words, gestures and movement. (Through May 20.) At 7:30 p.m., BAM Harvey Theater, 651 Fulton Street, between Ashland and Rockwell Places, Fort Greene, Brooklyn, (718) 636-4100, bam.org; $20 to $45. (Dunning) WORLD MUSIC INSTITUTE: SONGS & SHAMAN DANCES OF MANIPUR (Tonight) Presented by the Laihui ensemble, in a United States debut, these rarely performed songs and shaman ritual dances come from ''the land of jewels,'' an isolated mountainous region in the foothills of the Himalayas that is the home of the Tibeto-Burman Meiteis people, where pure cultural traditions have been preserved. At 8, Symphony Space, 2537 Broadway, at 95th Street, (212) 864-5400, worldmusicinstitute.org; $27; $15 for students. (Dunning) Art Museums and galleries are in Manhattan unless otherwise noted. Full reviews of recent art shows: nytimes.com/art. Museums BROOKLYN MUSEUM: 'KINDRED SPIRITS: ASHER B. DURAND AND THE AMERICAN LANDSCAPE,' through July 29. This show of about 60 works by Durand has as its centerpiece ''Kindred Spirits'' (1849), a tribute to the landscapist Thomas Cole and his friend the poet-journalist William Cullen Bryant. A founder of the Hudson River School, Durand (1796-1886) favored the realistic approach to landscape. He explored forest interiors with close attention to the ways of trees, foliage and rocks and ground cover in smaller works, while his larger and more elaborate exhibition pictures, influenced by European masters, are Arcadian visions suffused with light, color and atmospheric perspective. The show reveals Durand's strong sense of artistic mission and his potent role in shaping the aesthetic of 19th-century America. 200 Eastern Parkway, at Prospect Park, Brooklyn, (718) 638-5000, brooklynmuseum.org. (Grace Glueck) GUGGENHEIM MUSEUM: 'DIVISIONISM/NEO-IMPRESSIONISM: ARCADIA AND ANARCHY,' through Aug. 6. Ultimately this rare, compressed, mercurial exhibition of work by the Italian Divisionists of the 1890s is long on history and short on truly convincing paintings. The inclusion of works by Seurat and his French, Dutch and Belgian followers clarifies how the Italians pushed Pointillism, Seurat's invention, in all directions: toward realism, academic classicism, Symbolism, class consciousness and even Impressionism. The show opens a new, albeit small, window on the genesis of Modernism beyond the French canon. If many of the works are period pieces, they are also immensely appealing, big-hearted and physically robust period pieces. Guggenheim Museum, 1071 Fifth Avenue, at 89th Street, (212) 423-3500. (Roberta Smith) * JAPAN SOCIETY: 'Awakenings: Zen Figure Painting in Medieval Japan,' through June 17. Japan Society has a history of producing exquisite shows of Buddhist art. And this one, with four dozen paintings of Buddhists gods and saints hung in shrinelike alcoves, is transporting. It covers a broad swath of geography, bringing together 13th- to 16th-century hanging scrolls, not only from Japan but also from China, where Zen Buddhism, called Chan in Chinese, originated. 333 East 47th Street, (212) 832-1155, japansociety.org. (Holland Cotter) * the Metropolitan Museum of Art: 'Journeys: Mapping the Earth and Mind in Chinese Art,' through Aug. 26. Every six months or so, the Met rotates all the work in its Chinese painting galleries to preserve the delicate silks and papers, and each time, the curator in charge, Maxwell K. Hearn, produces a new and illuminating thematic exhibition, as is the case with ''Journeys.'' Outward-bound and inward-bound are the directions taken by Chinese landscape painting, and it carries us on some fascinating voyages in a show that mixes classical and contemporary art. (212) 535-7710, metmuseum.org. (Cotter) The Met: 'FRANK STELLA: PAINTING INTO ARCHITECTURE,' through July 29. Crammed into a gallery that feels like an obstacle course, this exhibition spans 43 years with 25 paintings, reliefs, drawings and architectural models, all with the goal of tracing an evolution that has not yet occurred. Taking up most of the space are enlarged versions of models that are considered sculptures -- and that look as if they date from the early 1960s. The main draws are the examples of the paintings and reliefs that are the basis of Mr. Stella's importance as an artist. (See above.) (Smith) The Met: 'FRANK STELLA ON THE ROOF,' through Oct. 28. Two large Pop art sculptures, two architectural models and a model enlarged into a sculpture-installation piece confirm that one of the greatest American artists of the postwar era doesn't do himself or anyone else any favors when he strays from the wall to work fully in the round. The results have a certain Stella-like verve but are otherwise generic. (See above.) (Smith) * Neue Galerie: 'Van Gogh and Expressionism,' through July 2. The Neue has, as usual, gathered a stellar roundup of Expressionist art. In one of the show's most exciting rooms, a third-floor gallery devoted mostly to self-portraits, two extraordinary van Goghs hang at opposite ends: ''Self-Portrait With Straw Hat'' (1887-88), from the Metropolitan Museum's collection, filled with energetic, radiating brushstrokes, and the National Gallery's vibrant self-portrait of the artist holding a palette and brushes, painted about a year later. The most compelling pairing in this room, though, is van Gogh's ''Bedroom'' from 1889, the second of three versions he painted of his room in Arles, with Egon Schiele's obvious homage, ''The Artist's Bedroom in Neulengbach,'' painted in 1911, in a darker palette and with a perspective tipped precariously toward the viewer. 1048 Fifth Avenue, at 86th Street, (212) 628-6200, neuegalerie.org. (Martha Schwendener) The Studio Museum in Harlem: 'Philosophy of Time Travel,' through July 1. This flawed show, which was created by a group of artists who studied together at the California Institute of the Arts, is nonetheless an interesting example of one of the art world's latest trends: the art collective. It takes Brancusi's ''Endless Column'' as its point of departure and reimagines this Modernist icon from the point of view of art school grads, who are versed in the language of artspeak and wed to the righteous cause of freedom of expression. 144 West 125th Street, (212) 864-4500, studiomuseum.org. (Bridget L. Goodbody) Whitney Museum of American Art: 'Gordon MaTTA-cLARK rETROSPECTIVE,' through June 3. I have no doubt that Matta-Clark is now being turned into a hot commercial commodity, but at least at the Whitney you can see what he aspired to be. He came up with various wonderfully harebrained ideas. Literally, in one case: after letting his hair grow for a year, he cut it off as a kind of performance and phrenological gag. The preserved hair, dutifully tagged piece by piece, opens the show like a holy relic. At the center of the exhibition is ''Splitting.'' To a plain single-family suburban frame house in Englewood, N.J., he made a cut straight down the middle, bisecting the building, then severing the four corners of the roof. The retrospective consists of films, drawings, photographs and some of the architectural pieces he cut out of buildings. The drawings are casual and not too interesting, but the luxurious black-and-white photographs from Paris speak more to Matta-Clark's formal elegance. The big message was: Life as art, and art as life, a philosophy dependent on our being properly attuned and keen to the moment. (212) 570-3676, whitney.org. (Michael Kimmelman) Whitney Museum of American Art: 'Taryn Simon,' through June 24. Ms. Simon couches the show in the intellectual, power-to-the-people oratory of leftist politics, yet she clearly delights in exposing, in a quasi-tabloid fashion, America's underbelly. Though she has also worked in war-torn areas, Ms. Simon is best known for ''The Innocents,'' a series of portraits of men and women who were wrongly convicted but later cleared by DNA test results. Ms. Simon can work as long as a year to gain permission to photograph high-security zones like the government-regulated quarantine sites, nuclear waste storage facilities, prison death rows and C.I.A. offices on view in the show. There are also pictures with lighter themes: the sandpit where the Grucci family tests fireworks, ski slopes being dynamited for avalanche control and the second Death Star, from ''Return of the Jedi,'' at George Lucas's Skywalker Ranch. Ms. Simon is at her artistic best when her delight in the strangeness of American culture shines. (See above.) (Goodbody) Galleries: 57th Street * KATHY BUTTERLY: BETWEEN A ROCK AND A SOFT PLACE Although she is a little off her game here, this extraordinarily talented ceramic sculptor continues to impress with exquisitely detailed, radiantly colored, art historically aware, discreetly lascivious little pieces, especially if you have never seen her work before. Still, the question of whether it isn't time for a change hangs over the proceedings. Tibor deNagy Gallery, 724 Fifth Avenue, (212) 262-5050, through May 19. (Smith) Last Chance * American Folk Art Museum: MARTíN RAMíREZ, Ramírez, a Mexican peasant who immigrated to Northern California and died there at 68 in 1963, spent the last 32 years of his life in a mental hospital, making some of the greatest art of the last century. He had his own way with materials and color, and an unforgettable cast of characters. But most of all, he had his own brand of pictorial space. In addition to being one of the season's best exhibitions and the first of his work in a New York museum, this show should render null and void the distinction between insider and outsider art. 45 West 53rd Street, (212) 265-1040, folkartmuseum.org; closes on Sunday. (Smith) * Jo Baer Ms. Baer is best known for her immaculate early Minimalist paintings and for a 1983 statement in which she declared that the realities of post-1960s power politics had rendered abstraction irrelevant. By that point she had moved to Europe where, in her 80s, she still lives. And she had started painting the figure, which she continues to do with verve, on the evidence of this quietly vehement show. Alexander Gray Associates, 526 West 26th Street, Suite 1019, Chelsea, (212) 399-2636; closes tomorrow. (Cotter) * Lazhar Mansouri: 'Portraits of a Village: 1950-70' Mansouri (1932-1985) was born in northeastern Algeria and apprenticed to a local portrait photographer, then set up a studio of his own. Townspeople and neighbors came to have portraits made, either to celebrate an occasion -- a birth, a graduation, a military induction -- or to document a relationship and create personal keepsakes. The pictures at Westwood, all recent prints and larger than the originals would have been, range over 20 years. Whether approached as social and political documents or as objects of beauty, they are moving, burning, life-enlarging things. Westwood Gallery, 568 Broadway, SoHo, (212) 925-5700; closes tomorrow . (Cotter) * the Museum of Modern Art: JEFF WALL. This majestic show makes a great case for Mr. Wall as the most complete, if traditional, of the untraditional artists who emerged from the turmoil of Conceptual art. His often immense color transparencies mounted on light boxes are enthralling visual vehicles, intent on giving pleasure while making a point or two about society, art, history, visual perception, the human animal or all of the above. An imposing blend of painting, street photography and movies, they blur reality and artifice, narrative and form, detail and the big statement. You can't stop looking at them. (212) 708-9400, moma.org, closes on Monday. (Smith) * RICHARD OELZE: PAINTINGS AND DRAWINGS FROM THE 1950s & 1960s Nearly two dozen paintings in the first United States show of this little-known German Surrealist introduce an introvert with a penchant for grisaille grottolike structures that seem built on air, and for soft, fleshy forms that sometimes have eyes or reveal hidden faces or figures. Max Ernst is a big influence, and Pavel Tchelitchew an obvious analogy, but the exquisite rendering and pervasive unquiet are Oelze's alone. Ubu Gallery, 416 East 59th Street, (212) 753-4444; closes tomorrow. (Smith) * 'Prime Time: Mickalene Thomas and Shinique Smith' A sparkling double-header by two very different artists with much in common. In paintings encrusted with rhinestones, Ms. Thomas gives 1970s pin-up portraits of African-American women the shimmer of Byzantine mosaics. Ms. Smith turns bundles of cast-off clothes into floral bouquets of exotic patterning. Caren Golden Fine Art, 539 West 23rd Street, Chelsea, (212) 727-8304, carengoldenfineart.com; closes tomorrow. (Cotter) * Hunter Reynolds: 'Patina du Prey's Memorial Dress, 1993-2007' In 1993 Hunter Reynolds -- an artist and an H.I.V.-positive gay man -- first performed as his alter ego, Patina du Prey, wearing a black ball gown inscribed with thousands of names of people who had died of AIDS. There were so many names that a second gown had to be made. It is in this heartbreaking show, along with the memorial books of names collected over the years, and blank books for recording names for a new dress. In a world littered with bogus monuments, this is the real, worthy thing. Artists Space, 38 Greene Street, third floor, SoHo, (212) 226-3970, artistspace.org; closes tomorrow. (Cotter) * Anne Ryan Anne Ryan sightings are infrequent these days, partly because the exquisite abstract collages that made her name in New York in the late 1940s and early '50s are scarce. There's just one in this small show at Teller, otherwise made up of prints and a few paintings. All are part of a fascinating and understudied modernist career that should be on permanent view. Susan Teller Gallery, 568 Broadway, SoHo, (212) 941-7335; closes tomorrow. (Cotter)"

2007-05-11T00:00:00Z,"A St. Albans man was arraigned Wednesday night on charges of robbing the bishop of a Queens church and later assaulting a woman and an off-duty police officer at a restaurant, prosecutors said yesterday. The man, Oluwafemi Olowofela, 25, of 194th Street, was charged with robbery, burglary and assault, said Richard A. Brown, the Queens district attorney. Mr. Brown said Mr. Olowofela is accused of robbing the Rev. Melvin Artis, 67, at gunpoint on Tuesday afternoon inside the Greater Universal Highway Deliverance Church on Linden Boulevard. He is also charged with attacking a 43-year-old woman later that day, and fighting with Officer Malik Kirkland, who came to her aid and apprehended him, Mr. Brown said."
2007-05-11T00:00:00Z,"Nothing satisfies the appetite for allegory quite like a movie about flesh-eating zombies. Somehow the genre, at least as practiced by its masters, has the capacity to illuminate some brute facts about the human condition and its contemporary dysfunctions. There are not many recent movies that match, for example, the social criticism undertaken by George Romero in his ''Living Dead'' cycle. Danny Boyle's ''28 Days Later'' and its new sequel, ''28 Weeks Later,'' directed by Juan Carlos Fresnadillo, may not quite be in Mr. Romero's league, but at their best they come close to his signature blend of grisly horror, emotional impact and biting satire. There is, of course, plenty of literal biting as well, since the virus-crazed creatures known as infecteds crave the flesh and blood of their erstwhile fellow citizens."

2007-05-11T00:00:00Z,"Some children are lucky enough to have a Miss Nelson: a sweet, sympathetic elementary school teacher who guides them gently over the rough spots in their paths toward higher education. Others must confront a Miss Swamp: an unforgiving, terror-inducing martinet whose tone and manner are as sharp and stinging as a rap across the knuckles with a ruler. The joke in Harry Allard's ''Miss Nelson'' books is that these two are one and the same. When the lazy behavior of Miss Nelson's students makes her sick, so to speak, the fearsome substitute Viola Swamp takes her place. And despite all the TV shows and movies featuring heroes with dual identities, no pupils in the Smedley School realize that Miss Nelson is a mighty morphin' teacher."

2007-05-11T00:00:00Z,"The goal of any hip-hop artist is to make hit records. But this weekend, 100 rappers will gather at the Hip Hop Culture Center in Harlem in the hopes of creating a different sort of record. From 9 p.m. tomorrow until 9 p.m. on Sunday the artists will take turns rapping nonstop -- without vulgarities -- for what could be the first ever 24-hour ''Rapathon.'' The event was conceived as a fund-raiser for the culture center, which uses hip-hop to attract youths in need in order to educate them on politics, economics, and diet and nutrition, said Curtis Sherrod, the center's executive director. The festivities kick off with two events. The first is a block party outside the culture center tomorrow, featuring dance performances and contests organized by the radio station Hot 97. That will be followed by a dinner at 5:30 p.m. at the center, where politicians and community leaders, including the hip-hop pioneer DJ Kool Herc, above, will offer career advice. For the main event 100 rappers previously selected at auditions will take the stage and take turns free-styling for a minute and a half each and then pass the mike. Should anyone get nervous or stumble, a free-style expert will be on hand to jump in and keep the flow going, Mr. Sherrod said. The audience also can step in if need be, he added, and contribute a few lines of ''Rock/and don't stop/ keep on/and don't stop.''

But since this is New York, we don't have to wait till next month -- there's fabulous gay entertainment whenever we want. For example, Gayfest NYC, a new monthlong festival that presents the works of emerging gay playwrights. The festival, produced by Bruce Robert Harris and Jack R. Batman for Sunny Spot Productions, includes three staged productions and two world premiere readings. Among the offerings is ''A Kiss From Alexander,'' starting May 24, in which a director stages a campy musical called ''Alexander Was Great!'' based on that world conqueror. When Alexander (now wandering the afterlife seeking the spirit of his mortal true love) learns that he is being portrayed as a gossipy, man-hungry queen, he intervenes -- dramatically, of course. The show, which was nominated for several Joseph Jefferson Awards after a 2005 Chicago production, has a book and lyrics by Stephan DeGhelder and music by Brad Simmons. The festival has a serious side too: the other productions are ''Revolution,'' by Michael D. Jackson, a docudrama about events leading up to the Stonewall riots of 1969, and ''Competing Narratives,'' a drama by A. B. Asher about three men (above from left, Sebastian La Cause, Michael Vaccaro and Matthew Boston) challenging one another's beliefs about race, sexuality and identity. The festival also intends to donate some proceeds to a scholarship for students at Harvey Milk High School, a New York City public school that focuses on gay teenagers' needs. The festival is dedicated to the memory of Patrick Quinn, the former president of Actors' Equity Association, who died of a heart attack in September. (Through June 2, TBG Arts Center, 312 West 36 Street, third floor, Manhattan, 212-352-3101, theatermania.com; $18; $45 to $50 for festival passes. A schedule of events is at gayfestnyc.com.)

2007-05-11T00:00:00Z,"In the latest attempt to exert pressure on Sudan over the killing in the Darfur region, a group of conservative to moderate Republicans in Congress demanded Thursday that President Bush impose sanctions against the government for its failure to rein in the violence. In a three-page letter sent to the White House, 15 members of the House urged Mr. Bush to ''follow your instincts'' and ''authorize the actions you outlined on April 18,'' when Mr. Bush promised that the United States would impose sanctions on Sudan if its government did not take action soon on Darfur."

The results show at 9 p.m. drew 27.4 million viewers, according to Nielsen's estimates, far exceeding the 12.8 million who tuned in to the runner-up in the hour, CBS's ''Criminal Minds.'' CBS finished second for the night, leading the 10 p.m. hour in total viewers with ''CSI: NY'' (12.7 million). ABC's ''Lost,'' despite reduced ratings, remained the winner at 10 among adults 18 to 49, and ABC finished close behind CBS in that demographic for the night. Fox's ''Bones'' finished first at 8 (10 million), outdrawing the season finale of CBS's ''Jericho'' (7.8 million), which tied with NBC's ''Thank God You're Here'' (5.3 million) for last place in the hour in the 18-to-49 set. NBC was fourth over all, just ahead of the CW, whose ''America's Next Top Model'' (4.9 million) ranked first at 8 in the younger demographic of adults 18 to 34. BENJAMIN TOFF"
2007-05-11T00:00:00Z,"Ken Burns has agreed to add Hispanic veterans' stories to ''The War,'' his PBS film on World War II, in the face of continuing criticism from Hispanic groups that said they felt slighted by the omission of Latino contributions from the work, to be broadcast in September. Mr. Burns had previously insisted that his completed 14 1/2-hour film would not be changed. The agreement, reached after 14 hours of negotiations, was announced by Mr. Burns's Florentine Films, the Hispanic Association of Corporate Responsibility and the American GI Forum, which represents Latino veterans. According to a press release, it ''equally recognizes that the artistic decisions of what appears in his film are his and his alone to make.'' The association's chairman, Manuel Mirabal, said that until the agreement, ''We didn't have Mr. Burns' commitment to work on this himself, we didn't have an agreement that stories of Latino World War II veterans would be within the credits, in effect integrated into the body of the film he had already completed, and we did not have a clear acknowledgment by Mr. Burns that this was an important part of the story.'' Mr. Burns was flying to France, where the work will be shown at the Cannes Film Festival, and not available for comment, a spokesman said. ELIZABETH JENSEN"

2007-05-11T00:00:00Z,"IF you love the outdoors but are bored just lying in the sun, try traipsing the wilderness as a citizen scientist -- no degree required. Summer is high season for the kind of naturalists' adventures that pair amateurs with researchers to collect information and restore wild areas. On one level, it's volunteer work -- making a contribution to scholarship or cleaning up an environment. On another, it's a good time in the outdoors with like-minded people. The grande dame of citizen science projects, the National Audubon Society's Christmas Bird Count, started in 1900 when the ornithologist Frank Chapman proposed counting birds instead of shooting them in traditional Christmas Day hunting contests. Writing in Bird-Lore, the precursor of Audubon magazine (motto: ''A bird in the bush is worth two in the hand''), he urged readers to make the count a success by ''spending a portion of Christmas Day with the birds and sending a report of their 'hunt' to Bird-Lore before they retire that night.'' Today more than 50,000 observers take part in the count every year."

2007-05-11T00:00:00Z,"It took Twyla Tharp just eight years to go from the choreographic anonymity of her first work, ''Tank Dive,'' to fame. The reason for that rise was her 1973 ''Deuce Coupe,'' made for the Joffrey Ballet, set to music by the Beach Boys, and now widely regarded as the first piece to bring modern-dance attitudes and movement to the world of classical ballet. Tomorrow afternoon there is an unusual opportunity to see not just ''Deuce Coupe,'' above, but also three other rarely performed works that Ms. Tharp made between 1970 and 1976. The event, a college showcase at the Joyce Theater, happened almost by accident. Ginger Montel, the associate director of Twyla Tharp productions, happened to mention to Linda Shelton, the executive director of the Joyce, that five university dance departments in the New York area were learning pieces by Ms. Tharp. Ms. Shelton decided that it was too good an opportunity to pass up and offered the Joyce for a one-off performance. It's a wonderful chance to glimpse something of Ms. Tharp's early artistic development: the structural rigor of ''The Fugue'' (three dancers performing 20 variations on a 22-count theme); her first use of music as choreographic impetus in ''Eight Jelly Rolls''; the highbrow-lowbrow mix of ''Deuce Coupe''; and the inventive partnering and incorporation of social dance in ''Country Dances.'' The institutions involved -- Barnard College (Ms. Tharp's alma mater), Hunter College, the Juilliard School, Marymount Manhattan College and Sarah Lawrence College -- were all taught these pieces by former Tharp company members, some of whom danced in the original productions. ''We've been making a concerted effort to make it financially possible for colleges to get Twyla's works,'' Ms. Montel said. ''Having the presentation at the Joyce is the cherry on top of the icing on top of the whipped cream.'' (Tomorrow at 2 p.m., 175 Eighth Avenue, at 19th Street, Chelsea, 212-242-0800, joyce.org; $20.)

A spokeswoman for HBO, the event's sponsor, said the festival would not be in Aspen in 2008, citing costs and the dwindling number of hotel rooms. Since 1995, the comedy festival, held in February and March, brought Robin Williams, Jerry Seinfeld, Steve Martin, Whoopi Goldberg, Billy Crystal, Larry David and others to that mountain resort town. ''Space is limited, and it's incredibly expensive,'' an HBO spokeswoman said of Aspen. ''Many of the properties also require four- or five-day stays, which is difficult, and expensive too.''

Mr. Gibson, the actor and director, was arrested for driving under the influence in Malibu, after which he subjected the arresting officers to an expletive-laden, anti-Semitic rant. Mr. Gibson, 51, who later apologized for his remarks, was sentenced to three years' probation, fined $1,300, and ordered to attend Alcoholics Anonymous meetings five days a week for four and a half months, then three times a week for seven and a half months. At a hearing in Malibu to assess his progress, Judge Lawrence Mira said he was impressed with Mr. Gibson's commitment. ''I truly believe the rehabilitation that is being effected in this case is effective, and I don't want to do anything to interrupt that,'' he said, in explaining why Mr. Gibson was not asked to appear for the hearing. Mr. Gibson must appear at an Aug. 23 hearing for a final progress report, Judge Mira ruled.

2007-05-13T00:00:00Z,"SPRING spurs migration and for a couple of months now a great river of birds has been streaming toward us, our local woods, backyards and beaches filling up with song. For some of us spring also means a return to old battles, as we wage our local fights to make sure that the returning birds will have both the place and space to rear their young. In recent years the plight of piping plovers has taken center stage, famously pitting drivers of recreational off-road vehicles against conservationists and inspiring bumper stickers that read ''piping plovers taste like chicken'' and even a song titled ''Fifty Ways to Kill a Plover.'' There have been some gains won in the effort to save the birds, whose population has been increasing along the New Jersey and Massachusetts shores, but there is still much work to be done along the rest of the Northeast, including in Connecticut and on Long Island."

She would have plenty of time to get ready. The cause was a good one. Proceeds from the tour -- tickets are $70 for members, $80 for nonmembers -- would benefit the local historical society. Besides, Mrs. Isles and her husband, Chris, love their home. Fascinated by local history, they were willing to open up their house, where they have lived 15 years, to fellow history buffs. In fact, Mrs. Isles's only initial concern about participating was that the upstairs of the house remained off limits to visitors; the idea of strangers peering into the rooms of her two teenagers was a bit much."

2007-05-13T00:00:00Z,"CLEMENT--Samuel Prescott Bush, son of Stuart Holmes Clement and Margaret Livingston Bush Clement, was born 29 December 1921 in Buffalo, NY, and died peacefully 4 May 2007 in Bloomfield, CT. Mr. Clement, known as ''Pres'', attended Foote School, graduated from Pomfret School in 1940, attended Williams College, and graduated from Colorado College in 1949. He taught at Pomfret and at St. Louis Country Day School. After a second bout of tuberculosis, he retired from teaching and began a career as a professional photographer and artist. He was a member of Photographers of America and did work for the Yale Divinity, Law, and Medical schools, the Yale baseball team, and Yale class reunions as well as portrait photography, weddings, and school yearbooks. His paintings have been exhibited annually at the High Peaks Artists Association in Keene Valley, NY, of which he was president for twenty years. As a young man, ''Pres'' was a strong baseball pitcher and first baseman. A resident of New Haven, CT, for many years and a seasonal resident of Keene Valley, NY, he was a member of the Yale University Glee Club hand bell group in New Haven, performed in local Gilbert & Sullivan productions, and sang with the Williams College Octet Alumni. He was an active and dedicated Class Secretary at Pomfret and an effective fundraiser for several other nonprofit organizations. While a resident of Litchfield, CT, he was a member of St. Michaels Church. Previously, he had been a member of St. Thomass in New Haven and most recently Old St. Andrews in Bloomfield; seasonally he attended the Keene Valley Congregational Church. He was also a member of the Adirondack Mountain Reserve, the New Haven Lawn Club, and the Keene Valley Country Club. Predeceased by his wife of fortynine years, Harmony Twichell Clement, ''Pres'' was devoted to his large, extended family and his wide circle of friends. He is survived by his children Harmony C. Spongberg and her husband, Stephen, of Chilmark, MA; Margaret C. Green of Washington, CT; Samuel Prescott Clement and his wife, Barbara, of Wellesley, MA; granddaughter Harmony S. Spongberg of Charlotte, VT; brother Stuart H. Clement; sister Mary B. Clement Estabrook; and many cousins, nieces, and nephews. A memorial service will be held at the Pomfret School chapel, Pomfret, CT on Sunday, 3 June at 11:30 am. Burial will be private. In lieu of flowers, donations in his memory may be made to The Class of 1940 Scholarship Fund, Pomfret School, P.O. Box 128, Pomfret, CT, 06258-0128 Attn. Development Office. Carmon Windsor Funeral Home has care of services."

Opening May 25, Dickens World (www.dickensworld.co.uk), in Chatham, Kent, England (where Dickens spent most of his childhood), will introduce visitors to life in Dickensian times -- from the architecture and street scenes to the smells and sounds. The attraction, about an hour southeast of London, includes rides, a shopping mall, a themed restaurant and a theater, all in one building. Visitors can experience a harsh Victorian schoolroom (like the one attended by Oliver Twist), and take a boat ride in the dark through London's sewers. The ghost of Ebenezer Scrooge will make an appearance in the haunted house, and there will be a Fagin's Den play area."

A historical example came to mind: the celebrated teacher Syvilla Fort (1917-75), who is perhaps best known for choreographing the dance to John Cage's first work for prepared piano. But her primary love was ballet, and she sought work as a ballerina unsuccessfully for several years before joining Katherine Dunham's troupe."

2007-05-13T00:00:00Z,"For the next three weeks the Sundance Channel turns over its Monday night ''Docday'' slot to the Israeli filmmaker Amos Gitai and his ''House'' trilogy, documentaries made in 1980, 1998 and 2005 about a house in Jerusalem and the people whose lives it has touched. In the first film, ''HOUSE'' (Monday, 9 p.m.), we meet the former owner, a Palestinian doctor whose family fled the house (for the second time) in 1948 and never returned; the Algerian Jewish couple who lived there for two decades and have moved to an apartment that they profess, unconvincingly, to love; the new Israeli owner who is turning it into a McMansion; and the Palestinian workers tearing it apart. The portrait that emerges from this 50-minute documentary, which Israel's state-owned channel commissioned and then refused to show, is amazingly rich, exposing not just ethnic and religious hatreds but also the tensions among generations and economic classes on all sides. But the essential impasse is always there, expressed most poetically by a Palestinian stonemason who, after explaining that to survive he must work for people he hates, says: ''If 36 Arab states haven't managed to counter Israel, what can our words do? They fly away on the wind.'' At least nine network series have their season finales this week. Some are sure to return (including ''Ugly Betty'' on ABC and ''Medium'' on NBC) and some are on the fence, but one is definitely saying goodbye: Sunday night is your last chance to take a trip to ''7TH HEAVEN'' (CW, 8 p.m.)."

If that makes no sense elsewhere, it is perfectly understandable in Albany. There, the new comptroller, Thomas DiNapoli, has proposed a plan to begin public financing of state campaigns, starting with the race for comptroller in 2010. Public financing, in which smaller campaign donations from individuals would be matched in statewide races, would be a great idea for New York. And Gov. Eliot Spitzer has pledged to promote some kind of public financing as part of his general overhaul of state government. Mr. Spitzer argues, however, that coaxing lawmakers into reforming the present system takes top priority. Unfortunately, that shoves public financing, which would bring New York in line with more progressive states, into the future."

Roller skating indoors may not be trendy, but there is something to be said for its simple pleasures. Yet the Rink in Montvale is scheduled to close June 3 to make way for a housing development, and roller skating fans in northern New Jersey will soon have to find something else to do or someplace else to skate. They can't go to the Rink in Bergenfield; it's now a Sears hardware store. They can't go to Skater's World in Wayne; it's now an Office Depot."
2007-05-13T00:00:00Z,"To the Editor: So many taxi drivers talk on their cellphones while driving that I actually thought they were permitted to do so, as long as they do not use handheld models. I learned from ''And Forget the Tip'' (F.Y.I., April 15) that this is not the case. It is a violation. I think it would be a public service to publicize this to taxi riders. It presumably is known to the drivers, but many, many ignore it, probably because so few suffer any penalties. A driver would soon stop this dangerous practice if his tips disappeared, and points on his license did appear. Jacquelyn K. Schwimmer Upper East Side"

Dick wrote some great science fiction, and some that wasn't so great. So have other genre writers. But it saves a lot of time and a lot of reading to anoint a single science-fiction writer as the only one worthy of consideration. That may even explain why people make bad movies out of his stories; perhaps they think his prestige will rub off on them."

2007-05-13T00:00:00Z,"What CHARLES ROSEN has to say about Beethoven's piano music is worth an afternoon of close attention. In celebration of his recent 80th birthday Mr. Rosen will give a lecture on Beethoven on Sunday at the 92nd Street Y and will play this composer's last three piano sonatas. The pieces, especially end to end, pose enormous problems for the head and for the hands. Given Mr. Rosen's powers of explanation, the first part of the afternoon ought to be at least as valuable as the second. Lecture at 1:30 p.m., concert at 3 p.m., 92nd Street Y, 1395 Lexington Avenue, (212) 415-5500, 92y.org; $40, $25 for 35 and under; free lunch for series subscribers. Concerts by MICHAEL TILSON THOMAS and the SAN FRANCISCO SYMPHONY on Thursday and Friday at Carnegie Hall revisit the idea that exceptional orchestral music is made not by the exceptional orchestra or the exceptional conductor, rather by exceptional chemistry. Man and ensemble found each other a number of years ago, with each party subsequently propelled to levels of success not previously enjoyed by either. On Thursday the orchestra will play Stravinsky, including the great Symphony in Three Movements, and then the Tchaikovsky First Symphony. Stravinsky's loyalty to his immediate predecessor and compatriot began early and never flagged. Friday's program is an odder combination: Copland's ''Short Symphony,'' five Mahler songs with the baritone Thomas Hampson and Richard Strauss's ''Also Sprach Zarathustra.'' At 8 p.m., (212) 247-7800, carnegiehall.org; $29 to $98."

2007-05-13T00:00:00Z,"To the Editor: A minor point to some, perhaps, and tangential at least, but in Francine Prose's review of Jim Crace's ''Pesthouse'' (April 29), with which I take no major exception, she refers to ''Hell's Angels'' in the possessive form. This is incorrect. The Angels subscribe to the theory that there is more than one ''hell.'' We'll all likely find out at some point whether this is truly the case -- many folks believe they already have, as Prose points out -- and whether or not grammatically correct, there is no apostrophe in Hells Angels. Again, a minor point to some -- but not to the Angels. Jim Fryman East Hampton, N.Y."

2007-05-13T00:00:00Z,"In terms of museum exhibitions, the art world is having something of a Left Coast moment. On Sunday the Hammer Museum at the University of California, Los Angeles, unveils ''EDEN'S EDGE: 15 L.A. ARTISTS,'' the first show organized by Gary Garrels, the museum's chief curator and deputy director of exhibitions, since he came to the Hammer from the Museum of Modern Art in 2005. The show's cross-generational span departs pleasantly from today's youth mania, which is as strong in the art world as elsewhere. The artists range from the venerable ceramic sculptor Ken Price to relatively recent arrivals like Elliott Hundley, Rebecca Morales, and Stanya Kahn and Harry Dodge. Through Sept. 2, hammer.ucla.edu. Next Sunday the Orange County Museum of Art in Newport Beach, Calif., opens a retrospective of the California-born, New York-based abstract painter MARY HEILMANN. The 75 works from 1972 to the present will trace the evolution of Ms. Heilmann's distinctively intuitive geometry and casually offhand painting process, below, and feature her work in ceramics as well as furniture design, film and music. Through Aug. 26, ocma.net. Meanwhile back East, on Friday the Philadelphia Museum of Art will open a retrospective of the graphic work of the American modernist WILLIAM H. JOHNSON (1901-70). It is the first show to bring together the watercolors, woodcuts and silk-screens from his two-part career. Johnson spent the 1920s and '30s in Europe, evolving an expressionist-landscape style influenced by Munch. Returning to the United States in 1938, he added modernist geometry and color to faux-folk representations of African-American life, creating images as audacious as anything else being made in New York at that time. Through Aug. 12, philamuseum.org."
2007-05-13T00:00:00Z,"Q. I live in a rent-stabilized apartment in a seven-unit building in Manhattan. The landlord has emptied the four apartments above me, and he lives in two apartments below me. For the last three years, he has warehoused the upstairs apartments, which had been rent-stabilized, but has allowed friends and religious students to stay there rent-free. Is he allowed to do this? A. ''If a landlord chooses not to rerent vacant apartments, that is the landlord's prerogative,'' said Joel E. Abramson, a Manhattan real estate lawyer. ''Of course, if the landlord does rerent the units, and they are still subject to rent stabilization, they must be rented in accordance with those regulations.''"
2007-05-13T00:00:00Z,"SCHAFER--Dr. John F. (Jack). Dr. Jack Schafer passed away May 5th, in Santa Rosa California, of pancreatic cancer at the age of 86 after a very short illness. Jack was a plant pathologist with a productive career improving grain crops. He received a doctoral degree at the University of Wisconsin and began his career with a 19-year stint (1949-1968) on the faculty of Purdue University as a core member of a well-known Purdue-US Department of Agriculture (USDA) Small Grain Breeding Team with Ralph M. Caldwell, Leroy E. Compton and Fred L. Patterson. A parade of improved wheat, oat and barley varieties produced by this team attracted the attention of farmers, first in Indiana (home of Purdue) and eventually in all the states that grew these small grain types. ''Knox'' wheat, released in 1953, became the leading soft wheat in the US. After release of ''Arthur'' and ''Arthur 71'' Purdue-USDA soft wheat comprised over 80% of the US soft wheat acreage and greatly increased wheat yield. This Purdue team also issued hundreds of scientific publications conveying significant disease, insect and genetic discoveries. Many graduate students trained by this world famous foursome are now serving in important industry and academic positions in the US and abroad. Jack Schafer was the last living member of the original team. Jack left Purdue to head the Plant Pathology Department at Kansas State University (1968-1972), followed by eight years as head of the Plant Pathology Department at Washington State University, following his dad, Edwin Schafer, to become the first father-son pair to be department heads at the University. In 1974, while at WSU, Jack was consultant as a wheat disease expert on a trade mission to China shortly after President Nixon opened trade relations with that country. Following a short-term assignment to the USDA Integrated Pest Management Program in Beltsville, Maryland, Jack moved to the University of Minnesota, where he was the Research Leader at the USDA-Agricultural Research Service Cereal Rust Laboratory from 1982-1987 when he retired. In recognition of his research and service to plant pathology, Jack was made a fellow of the American Phytopathological Society (APS) and also served as APS president. Jack is survived by his wife Joyce of Santa Rosa, daughter Patricia South and husband Walter of New York City, son Jim and wife Andy of Paradise, CA, and four granddaughters, Claire Hines, Ruth Kmiecik, Marsha Schafer, and Amanda Schafer, and sister Judith Hiss of Akron, OH. He was preceded in death by daughter Janice and brother George. There will be a memorial service on May 18th at 2:00pm at Vineyard Commons in Santa Rosa, California and a graveside memorial service will be in August in Pepin, Wisconsin. Memorials should be sent to the Washington State University Department of Plant Pathology Graduate Student Travel Fund, or to the American Phytopathological Society Foundation directed to graduate student travel."

2007-05-13T00:00:00Z,"SPRING spurs migration and for a couple of months now a great river of birds has been streaming toward us, our local woods, backyards and beaches filling up with song. For some of us spring also means a return to old battles, as we wage our local fights to make sure that the returning birds will have both the place and space to rear their young. In recent years the plight of piping plovers has taken center stage, famously pitting drivers of recreational off-road vehicles against conservationists and inspiring bumper stickers that read ''piping plovers taste like chicken'' and even a song titled ''Fifty Ways to Kill a Plover.'' There have been some gains won in the effort to save the birds, whose population has been increasing along the New Jersey and Massachusetts shores, but there is still much work to be done along the rest of the Northeast, including in Connecticut and on Long Island."

2007-05-13T00:00:00Z,"WHEN Betsy Isles received a phone call in early February asking if she would be willing to put her 19th-century Italianate farmhouse on a house tour, it all seemed comfortably far off: The tour date wasn't until May. She would have plenty of time to get ready. The cause was a good one. Proceeds from the tour -- tickets are $70 for members, $80 for nonmembers -- would benefit the local historical society. Besides, Mrs. Isles and her husband, Chris, love their home. Fascinated by local history, they were willing to open up their house, where they have lived 15 years, to fellow history buffs. In fact, Mrs. Isles's only initial concern about participating was that the upstairs of the house remained off limits to visitors; the idea of strangers peering into the rooms of her two teenagers was a bit much."

2007-05-13T00:00:00Z,"King Abdullah II of Jordan will meet with the Palestinian president, Mahmoud Abbas, on Sunday in the West Bank in an attempt to push along Israeli-Palestinian talks about peace. It will be the king's first visit to the occupied territory, which Jordan ruled until 1967, in seven years. King Abdullah has been traveling the West and the region urging Israel and the Palestinians to make more rapid progress toward solving their long dispute with the help of the Arab League initiative. He has been arguing that the conflict only feeds extremism in the Muslim world and that time is running out before a serious, new round of violence."
2007-05-13T00:00:00Z,"IT seems that a one-week trip to the shore, with days spent digging for clams and nights spent camping under the stars, has long ago ceased to be enough of a diversion for families planning their summer getaways. Now, the options range from cooking lessons in Italy (with even toddlers getting some kitchen time) to marionette-making courses in Prague to ''volunteer vacations'' that include trips to orphanages in China. ''Family travel continues to grow as more and more parents, particularly those working full time, view vacations as a way to 'reunite' the family, more than an occasion for rest and relaxation,'' said Peter Yesawich, chief executive of Yesawich, Pepperdine, Brown & Russell, a travel marketing firm. According to the 2007 National Leisure Travel Monitor, a yearly report by the company, family travel will be up this summer, as nearly 40 percent of adults plan to take a vacation with children, up from 32 percent five years ago."

The death of Arthur Rotman, president emeritus of Jewish Community Centers Association, is a great loss to his family, his colleagues, and the entire JCC Movement, which he served so ably and with such dedication. After many years at local JCCs, Rotman joined JCC Association as the organization's chief professional officer in 1976. From then until his retirement in 1994, he worked tirelessly to enhance the Jewish nature of JCCs and to support the status and professionalism of Jewish communal work. His deep involvement with the Commission on Maximizing the Jewish Educational Effectiveness of JCCs transformed the JCC, making it a premier institution of Judaic engagement. His deep commitment to Jewish life and community made him a giant in the field. Our sincere condolences to his wife Anita, his children Laurie, Stephen, Mina, Carol and Labe, and eight grandchildren.

2007-05-13T00:00:00Z,"SPRING spurs migration and for a couple of months now a great river of birds has been streaming toward us, our local woods, backyards and beaches filling up with song. For some of us spring also means a return to old battles, as we wage our local fights to make sure that the returning birds will have both the place and space to rear their young. In recent years the plight of piping plovers has taken center stage, famously pitting drivers of recreational off-road vehicles against conservationists and inspiring bumper stickers that read ''piping plovers taste like chicken'' and even a song titled ''Fifty Ways to Kill a Plover.'' There have been some gains won in the effort to save the birds, whose population has been increasing along the New Jersey and Massachusetts shores, but there is still much work to be done along the rest of the Northeast, including in Connecticut and on Long Island."
2007-05-13T00:00:00Z,"Here's a story Hallmark probably wouldn't want you to hear. It's about the ''mother of modern Mother's Day'' - Anna Marie Jarvis. As a girl growing up in West Virginia in the 1870s, she once heard her mother end a Sunday school prayer with these words: ''I hope that someone, sometime will found a memorial Mother's Day commemorating her for the matchless service she renders humanity in every field of life. She is entitled to it.'' She picked fights with public figures over Mother's Day issues, railed against ''charlatans'' and ''termites,'' was denounced in the florist trade press and got arrested for disrupting a meeting of the American War Mothers, whom she accused of profiteering on sales of Mother's Day carnations. Anna was devoted to her mother. When she died in 1905, Anna, now a single, 41-year-old businesswoman, made a solemn graveside vow: ''By the grace of God, you shall have that Mother's Day.'' A mocking 1938 Time article portrayed Jarvis as a bitter, homebound ''spinster'' fighting a losing war against ''unscrupulous florists and confectioners.'' As she once told a reporter: ''This is the paradox of my life. My greatest success is also my greatest defeat.'' She walked the streets of Philadelphia with petitions to rescind Mother's Day and was eventually committed to a sanitarium. She died in 1948 at the age of 84 - blind, penniless and childless. Her care had secretly been paid for in part by florists. Were they grateful to her, or just happy she was locked away? Or both? Nine years later, as a result of Jarvis's vigorous campaigning, President Woodrow Wilson signed a joint Congressional resolution proclaiming a national Mother's Day on the second Sunday of every May. Be careful what you wish for. In the coming years, Jarvis watched with disgust as her holiday became ''desecrated'' by commercialization. The front room of Jarvis's Philadelphia house had been kept as a shrine to her dead mother. As she once wrote: ''Mother's Day is to remind us of our duty before it is too late.'' The National Retail Foundation estimates that Americans will spend nearly $16 billion on Mother's Day this year. Anna Jarvis might well agree: That's a lot of guilt!"
2007-05-13T00:00:00Z,"It seems that James Traub (April 29) takes what the Islamists say essentially at face value. It was naïve reporting like this that, before the Islamic revolution in Iran, lulled the United States into accepting Khomeini and abandoning the shah. No one can seriously say that either Iran, the U.S. or the Middle East is better for the change."
2007-05-13T00:00:00Z,"To Catch a Thief Mets shortstop José Reyes is on a blistering pace on the base paths. His 20 steals lead the league and put him on pace for about 95 for the season. That would make him the first player to steal more than 90 bases since Rickey Henderson had 93 in 1988. Vince Coleman stole 81 that year, but no one has stolen more than 80 since. From Bad to Worse This was a tough week for the Toronto Blue Jays. On Thursday, Roy Halladay gave up eight runs in five innings as the Blue Jays lost to Boston, 8-0, their ninth defeat in a row. Earlier that day, closer B. J. Ryan had reconstructive elbow surgery, which will keep him out until the middle of next season. Then, on Friday, the Blue Jays snapped their losing streak with a 5-1 victory against Tampa Bay but lost Halladay for four to six weeks after he had an emergency appendectomy. Doby Gets His Due Less than three months after Jackie Robinson broke Major League Baseball's color barrier in 1947, Larry Doby became the first African-American to play in the American League when he suited up for the Indians. On Aug. 10, a little less than four months after baseball honored Robinson, the Indians will honor Doby, who died in 2003, with a pregame ceremony. The Indians will wear Doby's No. 14 for the game against the Yankees. THE WATCH LIST Chris Capuano, below, is scheduled to start twice this week, which is good news for Brewers fans. Capuano is 5-0 with a 2.31 earned run average. But better than that, the smooth-sailing Brewers have not lost this season when he has started, covering seven starts. Cubs fans should not become too excited about ÁNGel PagÁn, who homered and went 2 for 3 in his first game of the season. Pagán never stole fewer than 27 bases in a full minor league season, but he hit .247 in 77 games last season, with an on-base percentage of .306. If the top prospect Félix Pié could get only four at-bats in his last week before being demoted, it does not figure that Pagán will play much. The Devil Rays' James Shields is 3-0, and batters are hitting .198 against him. Real deal or no? He was streaky as a rookie last year (3.60 E.R.A. in June; 6.49 in July; 2.78 in August; 5.96 in September). But Shields is still just 25, and those 49 strikeouts -- fourth in the A.L. -- do not lie.

CSO Resound 901 701; two CD's. IF only because of the Eighth Symphony, so different from its siblings in mood, overall texture and proportions, it has never been easy for a conductor to be a Mahler generalist. The range is simply too broad, and even works with superficial similarities, like the Second and Third Symphonies, make radically different demands on their interpreters. But an age of specialization has turned up masters of individual works, and in the Third Symphony, James Levine and Bernard Haitink are perhaps the most persuasive maestros of the day."

2007-05-13T00:00:00Z,"THAT'S A LOT OF NAKED PEOPLE The News -- More than 18,000 people stripped off their clothes and posed nude for the photographer Spencer Tunick in Mexico City's famous square, the Zócalo. Behind the News -- Mr. Tunick specializes in shooting big groups in the buff. Over the years, he has staged similar mass photo shoots around the globe -- in New York, Switzerland, Chile, Brazil, Spain, Finland, Australia and other places. So, what's it all about? ''I just create shapes and forms with human bodies,'' Mr. Tunick explained to The Associated Press. ''It's an abstraction, it's a performance.'' THE SUM OF ALL THINGS The News -- Scientists from around the world plan to compile everything they know about the Earth's 1.8 million known species and put it all on one Web site. Behind the News -- The site will be free and open to everyone; the information is expected to fill an estimated 300 million pages. The mammoth effort is being spearheaded by seven of the world's top scientific institutions, including the Smithsonian Institution. And those 300 million pages may just be the beginning. Scientists estimate there may be eight million species on the planet, more than three-quarters of them undiscovered. NOTHING BUT THE TRUTH The News -- The Justice Department said it would not object to a Congressional grant of immunity to a former top aide to Attorney General Alberto R. Gonzales who played a central role in the dismissals of eight federal prosecutors. Behind the News -- Monica Goodling, the former aide, refused to appear before the House Judiciary Committee, citing her constitutional right to avoid self-incrimination. But the department's decision appeared to increase the likelihood that she will appear before the Congressional panel, which is investigating last year's firings. A VERY BIG PAYCHECK The News -- Steve Jobs, the legendary chief executive of Apple, was the nation's highest paid chief executive last year, according to the latest issue of Forbes magazine. Behind the News -- Mr. Jobs, 52, one of Apple's founders, earned a nominal salary of $1 a year, but according to Forbes, he realized $647 million from vested restricted stock. Overall, the magazine found that the chief executives of America's 500 biggest companies earned an average of $15.2 million each. Apple recently reported an 88 percent increase in profit for its latest quarter on sales of Macintosh computers and iPods. A FIERY DEATH REVEALED The News -- Astronomers reported that they had seen the brightest and most powerful stellar explosion ever recorded. Behind the News -- The astronomers said the supernova may be a completely new type of explosion, theorized but never seen before, that would explain how the earliest and most massive stars in the universe died and strewed new elements across space to fertilize future stars and planets. They were left to speculate about what caused the explosion, in a galaxy 240 million light-years away. ''It doesn't get any more exciting for a theorist,'' said one of those theorists."

2007-05-13T00:00:00Z,"''I have never made a distinction between my feature films and my 'documentaries,' '' WERNER HERZOG once stated. ''For me they are all just films.'' Starting on Friday FILM FORUM is giving audiences ample opportunity to consider this claim with a two-week, 35-title retrospective that brings together his greatest nonfiction hits (''Grizzly Man,'' 2005) with more obscure works, some dating to the mid-1960s. Although many of the rarer titles are available through Mr. Herzog's Web site, wernerherzog.com, in a six-disc box that will set you back 150 euros (more than $200), this bounty has not yet hit the rental market. In addition to ''Grizzly Man'' and ''The Wild Blue Yonder'' (2005), series highlights include ''Lessons of Darkness'' (1992), a vision of the apocalypse by way of post-gulf war Kuwait; and ''My Best Fiend'' (1999), a portrait of the actor Klaus Kinski, with whom Mr. Herzog worked and famously battled. Also very much worth a look are ''The Great Ecstasy of Woodcarver Steiner'' (1974), a snapshot of a ski-jumper (or ''ski-flyer'') that brings out the poetic sportscaster in Mr. Herzog, and the politically controversial ''Ballad of the Little Soldier'' (1984), which sympathetically considers the plight of Miskito Indians, some as young as 10, fighting Nicaragua's Sandinista government. Supplementing the series is a tasty sidebar of nonfiction films chosen by Mr. Herzog. Among the top-flight selections are Jean Rouch's cinéma-vérité masterwork ''Les Maîtres Fous'' (1955), which explores post-colonialism and madness in Africa; Chris Marker's sublime ''Sans Soleil'' (1983); and two from Errol Morris, ''Gates of Heaven'' (1978, about a pet cemetery) and ''Vernon, Florida'' (1981, about the town of the same name). Years ago Mr. Herzog fulfilled a promise he made to Mr. Morris with a gesture immortalized in another sidebar selection, Les Blank's aptly titled ''Werner Herzog Eats His Shoe'' (1979).

Broadway will continue to hum along, but except for the summer openings of ''Xanadu'' and ''Grease,'' a new season won't begin in earnest for a while. Many smaller companies are waiting in the wings, hoping, perhaps, that a lull in Midtown might mean a larger audience for less traditional fare. As if on cue, several unusual festivals are opening after Tuesday's announcement. Those who recognize Karol Wojtyla as Pope John Paul II may also know that in his younger days he was a man of the theater in his native Poland. Beginning on Wednesday the Storm Theater will present THE KAROL WOJTYLA THEATER FESTIVAL, made up of three plays written by the actor-playwright-pope. One of these, ''Our God's Brother,'' tells the story of a man who must choose between an artistic vocation and a religious path, a struggle Wojtyla may have known well. Through June 17, 145 West 46 Street, Manhattan, (212) 868-4444, smarttix.com; $15 to $30. Also beginning Wednesday is WORD OF MOUTH, a four-day festival of site-specific plays, recitations and poems to be performed in lobbies, mezzanines and other areas of the World Financial Center. One program, ''Girls Just Wanna Have Fund$,'' is a slate of six short works about women and wealth. Since the center is a public space, the festival's creators will ask passersby to stop, look and listen, and that should be worth watching in its own right. Through Saturday, West Street, south of Vesey Street, Lower Manhattan, (212) 945-0505, worldfinancialcenter.com; free. The Ensemble Studio Theater will also contribute to the Wednesday openings with SHATTER, a lineup of four new one-act plays written and directed by the company's four directors in residence. Among the shows is ''The Last Day,'' based on the 1953 short story by Richard Matheson (with Jed Orlemann and Marilee Talkington). Adapted and directed by Justin Quinn Pelegano, the play imagines a group of New Yorkers facing extinction. Through May 22, 549 West 52nd Street, Manhattan, (212) 352-3101, theatermania.com; $15."

2007-05-13T00:00:00Z,"''Are you restless like me?'' Tom Gabel of Against Me! sings in ''Up the Cuts,'' a song from his band's next album, ''New Wave,'' due in June. Hey, who isn't? Short attention spans pace 21st-century culture: Web-surfing, sampling, channel-hopping, multitasking. Even live rock music, although it's tied to the limitations of a fixed number of musicians on a stage in real time, jumps all over the place. That explains the improbable triple bill at Roseland that Against Me! shares with Cursive and Mastodon on Thursday. And it's a good part of the charm of Deerhoof, which headlines Irving Plaza that same night. DEERHOOF's music juxtaposes the tricky structures of progressive rock -- odd meters, dissonant counterpoint, sudden stops and starts -- with brief stretches of pop, funk or psychedelia. The songs switch from soft to loud, from sweet to fierce, from sparse to overstuffed and back. At one moment, Satomi Matsuzaki (on bass) sings a perky melody; the next, Greg Saunier on drums and John Dieterich on guitar are churning out a sinewy riff; then all three mesh in something danceable. Somehow, the music becomes more than a technical feat; all those ideas arrive with a silly exuberance. 9 p.m., Fillmore New York at Irving Plaza, 17 Irving Place, at 15th Street, Manhattan, (212) 777-6800; $16.50 in advance, $17 on Thursday. The Roseland bill brings together multiple constituencies. MASTODON is on the progressive end of metal, assembling grand concept albums and songs that slam away for a while, rev up even faster, flaunt twin guitars and might even swerve toward a melody. AGAINST ME! merges the drive and earnest political intentions of punk with touches of Southern rock. The indie-rock of CURSIVE, a band from Omaha, is harder to pin down; its songs embrace bruising post-punk dissonance, swinging trumpet lines and an Anglophile streak that includes both the Kinks and the Cure, all stoked with an impassioned discontent. 6:15 p.m., Roseland Ballroom, 239 West 52nd Street, Manhattan, (212) 777-6800; $25."

2007-05-13T00:00:00Z,"ANOTHER day, another record-breaking sewage spill. This time in Yonkers, where eight million gallons from a broken pipe spewed into the Hudson River last weekend in what officials called the worst such incident in the history of Westchester County. For swimmers, kayakers and fishermen in the New York City area, including Westchester and Rockland Counties, it was especially bad because many of them were exposed before they heard the news."

During and after her career as a special education teacher, she volunteered for the Alvin Ailey Dance Company. In the 1950's she dyed and sewed costumes. Later she became the company's archivist. She also volunteered with the South Street Seaport and a local veterinarian. She loved to attend theatre, opera and concerts and travel. She is survived by her brother, Marshall, and wife Linda, her cousin Bruce and wife, Dale, cousin Susan and husband, Dick, cousins Mindy and Richard and their children and grandchildren."
2007-05-13T00:00:00Z,"A toddler squeals with delight alongside a jumble of boulders, plunking herself thigh high into a sloshing emerald pool within inches of dozens of honking African penguins that squirt in and out of the water like large self-propelled watermelon seeds. This sparkling cove at Boulders Beach, less than an hour outside Cape Town, South Africa, is part of Table Mountain National Park, and one of the most protected places along False Bay for kids -- and birds -- to swim. Squint your eyes and you could be in the Seychelles. It's just one of many places -- drive-up beaches, malaria-free open spaces and casual cafes -- that make Cape Town an easy place for families to decompress. South Africa's safari lodges may dangle attractive kid bait, like hunts for the ''little five'' (elephant shrews and rhino beetles among them), but they also have safari rules like ''no talking,'' and ''sit still.'' In Cape Town, children can make noise when they see animals, swim next to them, and even touch some."
2007-05-13T00:00:00Z,"To the Editor: Tara McKelvey's review of my book, ''Bigger Than Life'' (April 29), brings to mind the adage ''Be careful what you wish for.'' No small thing to be reviewed in The Times, and for that I'm grateful. No doubt, either, that McKelvey is entitled to her opinion. But if the book is ''confused'' and ''uneven,'' that's one thing; quite another to misrepresent the events, or my account of them, in the way she does. Since she devotes five paragraphs to synopsis and only one to critique, she's obligated, I think, to get it right. It may be true, for instance, that I wandered the gathering after my father's memorial service in a ''trance'' of grief and shock -- but to say my state was ''Valium induced'' is purposefully inaccurate and snide."

2007-05-13T00:00:00Z,"Hannah Emery, 7, a second-grader from Arvada, Colo.: ''First we went to Oklahoma, then we were going to leave by Tuesday to go to the beach in Texas, but my dad had to stay in Oklahoma until Thursday because he had to work. We would have had only one little part of the day to go to the beach, so we went to the sand dunes where we would be closer to home, and we would get two days. I have three brothers. We just bought the kites. My little brother, Lucas, had a SpongeBob kite; Ian had a kite that you can use with two hands; and Kyle had a dragon kite. Mine was a My Little Pony kite. Kyle and Ian didn't get their kites up. They kept trying it, and since they couldn't get it in the air, they went to the river. My mom held my kite and I started running and she let go. It goes up really high. I got it up like six times, twice for a long time, and the other times just for a minute.'' As told to Seth Kugel"

She graduated from Columbia Dental School with honors and became the first woman on their teaching staff. Ellen had a true passion for learning and that passion did not stop with dentistry. She studied all forms of medicine and incorporated that knowledge into her dental practice. Her love for learning is only surpassed by her willingness to pass that knowledge on to others. Dr. Ellen Hosiosky was truly a charitable person, not only with her money, but more importantly with her time to help others. She will be missed."

Excited New Englanders have reported sighting a Golden Gyro Flicker. This exotic creature may have migrated from its native Asia in search of the famous Greek sandwich for which it is named. It has certainly feathered its nest in the Boston area. On Chicago's north side, Wrigley's Huffin Puffin scolds his Feckless Flock. Among the newly hatched Flushing Meadow Larks is a covey of Randolph's Mossbacked Coots. Pictured here are the Gray-Whiskered Franco, the Rusty-Winged Glavine and the Cuban Geezer.

2007-05-13T00:00:00Z,"Brahms: 'Ein Deutsches Requiem' Dorothea Röschmann, soprano; Thomas Quasthoff, baritone; Rundfunkchor Berlin; Berlin Philharmonic, conducted by Simon Rattle. EMI Classics 3 65393 2; CD. TRIBUTES to God slip into two categories. There is the act of penitential abstinence: a sacrifice of the senses that turns self-denial into a triumph of love. There is also the thought that man-made beauty is the greatest gift of all. Brahms was not a terribly religious man, but his music is a kind of wrestling match between the two ideas. His lyrical inspiration needs no explanation. His drier, more belligerent moments tell us about a man who acknowledged his own natural effusiveness without fully trusting it."

In the Yankees' next series, Manager Joe Torre said during batting practice, DeSalvo would start and Darrell Rasner would be skipped. When the game began -- only the second of his career -- DeSalvo rewarded Torre's faith. He allowed two runs over six and two-thirds innings for his first major league victory, helping the Yankees defeat the Seattle Mariners, 7-2, at Safeco Field."

2007-05-13T00:00:00Z,"I recently called up Lufthansa Miles & More to reserve a flight using my miles from the program. Lufthansa said that I had enough miles for the flight, but that there were no seats available. I was able to make online bookings for the seats I wanted -- as long as I paid for them. Is this a typical problem? Why am I storing up all these miles if I can't use them? -- Christian Caryl, Tokyo Yours is a frequent lament. As I have often reported, airlines sometimes make it hard to redeem miles for tickets on the flights you want, especially if they can sell all the seats to fare-paying travelers. It is therefore wise to plan well in advance and ask which flights, or routings, you can get an award ticket on. You might have luck with another Star Alliance carrier, such as Air New Zealand, Singapore Airlines, All Nippon Airways or Thai Airways International, which should all accept Lufthansa miles."

She would have plenty of time to get ready. The cause was a good one. Proceeds from the tour -- tickets are $70 for members, $80 for nonmembers -- would benefit the local historical society. Besides, Mrs. Isles and her husband, Chris, love their home. Fascinated by local history, they were willing to open up their house, where they have lived 15 years, to fellow history buffs. In fact, Mrs. Isles's only initial concern about participating was that the upstairs of the house remained off limits to visitors; the idea of strangers peering into the rooms of her two teenagers was a bit much."

Jack was a plant pathologist with a productive career improving grain crops. He received a doctoral degree at the University of Wisconsin and began his career with a 19-year stint (1949-1968) on the faculty of Purdue University as a core member of a well-known Purdue-US Department of Agriculture (USDA) Small Grain Breeding Team with Ralph M. Caldwell, Leroy E. Compton and Fred L. Patterson. A parade of improved wheat, oat and barley varieties produced by this team attracted the attention of farmers, first in Indiana (home of Purdue) and eventually in all the states that grew these small grain types. ''Knox'' wheat, released in 1953, became the leading soft wheat in the US. After release of ''Arthur'' and ''Arthur 71'' Purdue-USDA soft wheat comprised over 80% of the US soft wheat acreage and greatly increased wheat yield. This Purdue team also issued hundreds of scientific publications conveying significant disease, insect and genetic discoveries. Many graduate students trained by this world famous foursome are now serving in important industry and academic positions in the US and abroad. Jack Schafer was the last living member of the original team. Jack left Purdue to head the Plant Pathology Department at Kansas State University (1968-1972), followed by eight years as head of the Plant Pathology Department at Washington State University, following his dad, Edwin Schafer, to become the first father-son pair to be department heads at the University. In 1974, while at WSU, Jack was consultant as a wheat disease expert on a trade mission to China shortly after President Nixon opened trade relations with that country. Following a short-term assignment to the USDA Integrated Pest Management Program in Beltsville, Maryland, Jack moved to the University of Minnesota, where he was the Research Leader at the USDA-Agricultural Research Service Cereal Rust Laboratory from 1982-1987 when he retired. In recognition of his research and service to plant pathology, Jack was made a fellow of the American Phytopathological Society (APS) and also served as APS president. Jack is survived by his wife Joyce of Santa Rosa, daughter Patricia South and husband Walter of New York City, son Jim and wife Andy of Paradise, CA, and four granddaughters, Claire Hines, Ruth Kmiecik, Marsha Schafer, and Amanda Schafer, and sister Judith Hiss of Akron, OH. He was preceded in death by daughter Janice and brother George. There will be a memorial service on May 18th at 2:00pm at Vineyard Commons in Santa Rosa, California and a graveside memorial service will be in August in Pepin, Wisconsin. Memorials should be sent to the Washington State University Department of Plant Pathology Graduate Student Travel Fund, or to the American Phytopathological Society Foundation directed to graduate student travel."

She was awarded a Diploma in Piano and a minor in Organ from The Julliard School. During her lifetime, Miss Shelton performed in recitals in New York City, in Toronto, Canada, and throughout Florida. She also taught at La Guardia High School of the Performing Arts for 20 years. Miss Shelton is a descendant of an early Virginia family and was a very active member of several societies. She was a member of the United Daughters of the Confederacy for 53 years and was the current New York Division President prior to her death. She was also a member of the New York City Chapter of the Daughters of the American Revolution (DAR) and served as its Regent from 1988 to 1991 and was its Chapter Historian prior to her death. Miss Shelton also served as New York State DAR Historian from 1998 to 2001. She was also an active member in several other societies including: the Jamestowne Society; the Colonial Dames of America; the Sons and Daughters of the Pilgrims; the Huguenot Society of America; and, the oldest woman's club in America, Sorosis. Miss Shelton was also listed in the social registry. Miss Shelton leaves innumerable friends and appreciative former students as well as family in whose hearts and memories she will remain forever. A memorial service and burial is planned for May 19, 2007, at 11:00am at Roselawn Gardens of Memory and Funeral Home in Decatur, Alabama.

Don't take it personally. When arriving in Rome: Luggage handling at Fiumicino Airport can be notoriously slooow, with waits for checked baggage delivery often 30 minutes to an hour - although this is improving. Frequent travelers to Rome do not check luggage if they can help it! When leaving Rome, queues to check in are often long. If you have a frequent flyer card, you can often go to the much calmer business class check-in. As of May, 2008, travelers to the U.S. flying on U.S. airlines check in and go through passport control at a new facility called Terminal 5, rather than at Terminal C, the main international terminal for flights leaving Europe. Leave extra time since check in at Terminal 5 requires a bus ride to the gates, and also for considerable confusion. Two things to keep in mind: 1. Only taxis are permitted to drive directly to Terminal 5; so if you take a train or a bus to the airport you and your luggage will have to take a shuttle bus from the main terminals to Terminal 5. 2. Alitalia and Delta code share all of their flights; where you check in depends on which airline is operating your flight."

If you're on an international flight you're likely to arrive at the sprawling new airport, Suvarnabhumi (airport code BKK), which is east of the city. Don Muang carries the airport code DMK and is used mainly for domestic flights. Study your tickets carefully, especially if you're changing planes (it takes at least an hour to travel between airports). Here's the most important thing to know about Suvarnabhumi: it's pronounced Sawana-phoom. If you pronounce it the way it's spelled, no one will understand you. Peak time for international flights at Suvarnabhumi is the evening. Check-in lines, especially for Thai Airways, which now uses the single check-in line system, can be very long.

The letter criticized plans for maintaining at least 300 wolves and 30 breeding pairs across the three states. About 1,300 wolves now roam the area.

It was May of last year, not last summer. The article also misstated the price Russia pays Turkmenistan for gas and the price for which it resells the gas to European customers. It buys the gas for $100 per 1,000 cubic meters and resells it for $250 per 1,000 cubic meters -- not $100 and $250 ''per cubic meter.''"

2007-05-15T00:00:00Z,"For the fourth time in a row, the Supreme Court on Monday decided a death penalty case by a vote of 5 to 4. But this time, contrary to the court's overturning of three Texas death sentences last month, a narrow majority went the other way and reinstated the death sentence of an Arizona man who argued that his lawyer had failed to discover or present crucial evidence that could have persuaded the jury to spare his life. The issue before the justices was a step removed from the ultimate question of whether the defendant, Jeffrey T. Landrigan, had been deprived of his constitutional right to the effective assistance of counsel. Rather, the case presented an issue of habeas corpus law: whether the Federal District Court in Phoenix had properly dismissed Mr. Landrigan's habeas corpus petition as so insubstantial as not even to deserve a hearing."

Prior to forging a career as a tennis professional, he trained at the Nick Bollettieri Tennis Academy and attended Monmouth University, where he was a two-time Northeast Conference A Flight Singles Champion, a four-time MVP and held the team record for alltime career victories. In 1994, he was the Number 4 ranked men's single player in the USTA's Eastern Region and held rankings in the top 20 throughout the 1990's.

Earlier, he traveled cross country with a top 100 women's singles player, coaching her in the 1992 and 1993 U.S. Open tournaments. His love of the game was most obvious in his development of junior players. He infused many talented juniors with his passion for tennis, and stood out in his field for providing special consideration to families who faced financial inequities. Many of his students won tennis scholarships to top colleges and universities, playing Number 1 on their teams. Steffen was buried in a private family ceremony in Creve Coeur, MO on April 20, 2007.

2007-05-16T00:00:00Z,"The city has agreed not to sell a vacant firehouse in Brooklyn, ending a four-year battle between the Bloomberg administration and community activists and local leaders. Engine Company 204 on Degraw Street in Cobble Hill was one of five units closed or relocated during budget cuts in 2003, leaving their firehouses empty. The changes set off emotional debates over the future of the buildings, whose communities prized their distinctive structures and histories. Yesterday, Councilmen Bill de Blasio and David Yassky, both of Brooklyn, and the borough president, Marty Markowitz, announced that the city had agreed to put the Degraw Street building up for lease for a community use to be determined. The City Council's land use subcommittee approved the deal and the potential sale of three of the other firehouses, with a provision that the buildings be used to benefit their communities. The fifth closed firehouse, on the Lower East Side of Manhattan, has been approved for sale to the Henry Street Settlement for moderate-income housing. RAY RIVERA"
2007-05-16T00:00:00Z,"It seemed like déjà vu all over again when John Rossant and his Italian wife, Antonella Caruso, stumbled on the 18th-century Château de Livry in Normandy. The couple had already bought and restored one dream weekend home, Casa Fizie, a rectangular stone house on five acres between the towns of Todi and Orvieto in Italy's Umbria region. In the mid-1990s, the couple spent about 18 months completely redesigning its interior and adding a pool and large garden, all with the help of Mr. Rossant's uncle, James Rossant, a New-York based architect."
2007-05-16T00:00:00Z,"Lindsay Lohan Sued By Photographer Lindsay Lohan, below, and her mother, Dina, have been sued by a freelance photographer who maintains that Ms. Lohan struck him with a car on March 13 on Ninth Avenue, between 12th and 13th Streets, in the West Village, The Associated Press reported yesterday. According to the lawsuit, the car, a BMW, was owned by Mrs. Lohan, but Ms. Lohan, 20, was driving it with her mother's permission. The suit, filed in State Supreme Court, the Bronx, where the photographer, Giovanni Arnold, lives, said he ''sustained severe and permanent personal injuries'' because the Lohans were ''negligent, careless and reckless.'' His lawyer, Marc Mauser, said that Mr. Arnold suffered injuries to both knees and was seeking unspecified monetary damages for pain, suffering and lost wages. He said Mr. Arnold was in front of the BMW when Ms. Lohan put it in reverse, then shifted to drive, throwing him on the hood and then to the ground. He said she stopped to check on Mr. Arnold before leaving. A lawyer for the Lohans was not immediately available for comment. Rocky Tosses in the Towel Sylvester Stallone, below, pleaded guilty yesterday to taking restricted muscle-building hormones into Australia, The Associated Press reported. In a letter to the Downing Center Local Court in Sydney, Mr. Stallone, star of the ''Rocky'' and ''Rambo'' movies, said: ''I made a terrible mistake, not because I was attempting to deceive anyone, but I was simply ignorant to your official rules. I feel terrible that my breach of your rules has set a poor example to members of the public, whose opinion I cherish dearly.'' Mr. Stallone did not appear in court. His plea was entered by his lawyers. He was accused of bringing banned substances into Australia after a customs search of his luggage on Feb. 16 turned up 48 vials of Jintropin, a human growth hormone product. The maximum penalty is a $91,500 fine and five years in prison, but Mr. Stallone faces a maximum penalty of $18,000 on each of the two charges because the case is being heard by a local, not a federal, court. Deputy Chief Magistrate Paul Cloran said Mr. Stallone would be sentenced on Monday. Tintin Goes Digital Stephen Spielberg and Peter Jackson will use the digital 3-D technique known as performance capture when they direct and produce three Tintin feature films for DreamWorks. Each filmmaker will direct one of the movies, but the studio would not say which of the two would direct the third, Variety.com reported. Mr. Spielberg and Mr. Jackson were described as longtime fans of Tintin, below, the beloved Belgian boy reporter and hero of comic strips and scores of books created by Georges Remi (1907-1983) under the pen name Hergé. Variety reported that WETA Digital, Mr. Jackson's special-effects house in New Zealand, had produced a 20-minute test reel. Mr. Spielberg said, ''We want Tintin's adventures to have the reality of a live-action film, and yet Peter and I felt that shooting them in a traditional live-action format would simply not honor the distinctive look of the characters and world that Hergé created.''

2007-05-16T00:00:00Z,"A state appeals court has dismissed a civil judgment against the Police Department that stemmed from a 1992 altercation between police officers and demonstrators in Orchard Beach, in the Bronx. The original verdict, in which a jury awarded $81 million to seven plaintiffs, was reduced by the trial judge in 2004 to $635,000, city officials said. In a ruling released yesterday, the Appellate Division of State Supreme Court found that videotapes of the confrontation did not support the contention that the police had acted improperly. After reviewing the tapes, the judges said that the police were justified in their belief that the protest could escalate and that officers ''appropriately tried to quell a quickly unfolding, potentially explosive situation.''

2007-05-16T00:00:00Z,"Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdogan said he hoped that Nicolas Sarkozy, who takes over as France's president today, would drop his opposition to Turkey's joining the European Union. Mr. Sarkozy, who argues that Turkey is culturally not a part of Europe and that most of its territory is in Asia, vehemently opposes Turkey's membership. ''This approach of Mr. Sarkozy comes from prejudices,'' Mr. Erdogan said, addressing a media conference in Istanbul. ''Mr. Sarkozy has to overcome these prejudices.'' Mr. Erdogan's remarks were the first to directly address the implications of Mr. Sarkozy's election for Turkey. ''Turkey's E.U. membership is the peace project of the 21st century,'' Mr. Erdogan said, ''an alliance of East and West.'' SABRINA TAVERNISE"

About 25,000 inventors from all walks of life entered this annual contest, which is run by the History Channel and the National Inventors Hall of Fame. I was among the six judges who were asked to declare a winner from among the 25 finalists still standing. The grand prize ($25,000) went to something called the Enertia house, which was invented by an engineer and former log-home architect, Michael Sykes. It's a design for a home that heats and cools itself, with benefits both the homeowner and the environment."

2007-05-16T00:00:00Z,"Periodically -- about twice a year, by my calculation -- someone tries to breathe new life into the movie musical by putting together a lavish song-and-dance spectacle like the ones they used to make, full of big numbers and bigger emotions. (See, most recently, ''Dreamgirls'' and, before too long, ''Hairspray.'') Against this trend, ''Once,'' a scrappy, heart-on-its-sleeve little movie directed by an Irishman named John Carney, makes a persuasive case that the real future of the genre may lie not in splashy grandeur but in modesty and understatement. Filmed with more efficiency than elegance on the streets of Dublin, Mr. Carney's movie, a favorite at Sundance earlier this year, does not look, sound or feel like a typical musical. It is realistic rather than fanciful, and the characters work patiently on the songs rather than bursting spontaneously into them. But its low-key affect and decidedly human scale endow ''Once'' with an easy, lovable charm that a flashier production could never have achieved. The formula is simple: two people, a few instruments, 88 minutes and not a single false note."

I can attain a similar state of mind while shopping for dinner, and recently I did. In the produce aisle was a basket of plump, velvety morels, the first of the season. They were spore-ishly seductive: their matte, furrowed skin was taut, their fragrance fresh and earthy, like a rainy walk in the woods. So what if the bill for the half pound I checked out with was $30? Their season is all too fleeting (from May to mid-June). And besides, I rationalized, cooking morels at home is cheaper than going out for them."

He was 75. Born in Asbury Park, New Jersey in 1931, to Daniel Joseph Black and Julia B. (Palmer) Black, Black grew up in Brooklyn. His education at The Cooper Union and New York University, from which he received his B.S. degree in 1956, was interrupted by his enlistment in the U.S. Army, where he served three years as a sergeant in active duty in the Korean War. Black began his career in 1956 at commercial and municipal construction firm Frederick Snare Corp., where he was assistant to the treasurer. In 1960, he joined Carter-Wallace, Inc., a diversified healthcare company known for innovative products such as Arrid (the first aerosol deodorant) and Rise (the first pressurized shave cream). From his initial position as tax manager, Black rose to become, by the early 1970s, Carter-Wallace's President and Chief Operating Officer, the position he held until his retirement, in 1997. Under Black's long stewardship, the company originally known for 'Carter's Little Liver Pills', grew to join the Fortune 500 by the early 1990s. Daniel Black was a man of great intellect and intense curiosity. His pursuit of knowledge and understanding was unrelenting. Besides leading a successful business career, Dan Black was, at various points in his life, a recognized mineralogist, a voracious reader of history, a horticulturalist, a collector of rare books and fine art, and a golf enthusiast, among many other interests and avocations. He served on the board of trustees of Mount Holyoke College and on the board of overseers of the NYU Stern School of Business.

A frequent target of vandals, the bronze statue created by the Danish sculptor Edvard Eriksen in tribute to Hans Christian Andersen was defaced for the second time since March. On Tuesday it was found with its face, left arm and lap doused with red paint. Next to the statue, a magnet for tourist photographers, a wooden picture frame was placed with green letters spelling ''av,'' Danish for ''ouch.'' The police said they did not know who had defaced ''The Little Mermaid'' or if the act was connected to overnight clashes between them and rock-throwing youths near Christiana, the city's bohemian district.

2007-05-17T00:00:00Z,"Since the inception of the National Design Awards program in 2000, when it was announced with much fanfare at the White House, the awards, overseen by the Cooper-Hewitt National Design Museum, have been a mixed bag. While it's nice to see designers like Morris Lapidus honored for their work, the awards have never become as prestigious as the Pritzker, known as architecture's Nobel Prize, and they have often seemed to lack focus. When last year's winners were announced, Bruce Nussbaum of Business Week finally said what many were thinking when he wrote on his blog that, as a tool for promoting innovation, ''the National Design Awards are a failure.'' Perhaps this year's jury, which included the irreverent architect James Wines, the downtown design fixture Stephen Burks and Caterina Fake, a founder of the photo-sharing site Flickr.com, got the message. Some of the winners announced on Tuesday were predictable: Antoine Predock, in the lifetime achievement category; Venturi, Scott Brown and Associates, in a category called design mind; Peter Walker, the World Trade Center Memorial landscape architect; the graphic designer Chip Kidd; Apple's Jonathan Ive, in the product design category; and Adobe Systems, for corporate achievement. But there were also a couple of surprises. Boston's experimental Office dA won the architectural design award, over a local favorite, Enrique Norten, and the Lower East Side architecture firm Lewis.Tsurumaki.Lewis (partners Paul Lewis, Marc Tsurumaki and David J. Lewis are shown above, from left, with their 2000 Geltner Loft project) won for interior design over the powerhouse David Rockwell. PHILIP NOBEL"

And until Roger Clemens and Pedro Martínez each reappear, neither the Yankees nor the Mets will really know how high (or how low) they can go this season. In the Mets' success and the Yankees' struggle approaching their annual intramural inspection beginning tomorrow night at Shea, they continue to hold tryout camps for another starting pitcher. Hardly the ideal situation for two teams expected to be competing in October."

Just take Pilates Synergy Flow, his hourlong workout that offers the toning of Pilates bookended by a brisk warm-up and a chaser of squats, lunges and arm work done at a heart-thumping pace.

Orange County operated the landfill, situated on 300 acres in Goshen, from 1974 to 1992. The landfill was declared a hazardous waste site and was capped in the late 1990s under an agreement with the state in which those responsible for disposing of the waste would eventually help pay for the cleanup.

2007-05-18T00:00:00Z,"COSTELLO--Joseph Michael, died Tuesday from complications from a fall. He was surrounded by his family. Joe was born February 28, 1925, in Manhattan to Michael and Mary Costello of County Mayo, Ireland. He graduated from Rice High School and enrolled in Iona College, where his education was interrupted by his enlistment in the U.S. Army. He served in active duty in World War II, arriving in Europe on June 9, 1944. He was taken prisoner in the Battle of the Bulge in December 1944 and remained ''a guest of the German government,'' as he would say in his own inimitable way, until May 8, 1945. After his discharge, Joe finished an accounting degree at Iona, and then completed a law degree at Fordham Law School. He was the founding partner of the New York law firm Costello, Shea & Gaffney, and became a highly respected trial lawyer in the areas of insurance defense, products liability and medical malpractice. He was a member of the Nassau County, New York State (former chairman, Trial Lawyers Section) and American Bar Associations; the Maritime Law Association of the United States; the New York County Lawyers Association; the Defense Research Institute; and the Defense Association of New York. He was a former law lecturer at Fordham University; member of the National Panel of Arbitrators of the American Arbitration Association; fellow of the American College of Trial Lawyers; member of the Federal Bar Council; associate trustee of North Shore University Hospital; trustee, justice and police commissioner of the Village of Plandome; and president of Plandome Country Club. Joe loved sharing his wit and wisdom, telling stories, reading, the New York Times crossword puzzle, golf, travel, especially to Ireland, cigars, and most of all his family, the sine qua non of his existence. He is survived by his wife, Marianne Kelly (Clark) of Plandome; his children Michael (Jayne) of Hanover, NH; Kelly (Coleman) King of Columbus, NJ; J. McGarry (Marilyn) of Wilton, CT; Patrick of Glen Head; Renie of East Hampton; Brendan of Port Washington; and Noelle of Cumberland, RI; his grandchildren, Patrick, Nicole, Ian, Christiana, Cosima, Francesca, Caroline, Colin and Elizabeth; his brother, Thomas; his sisters Theresa Honan and Patricia Wright; and many cousins, nieces, nephews, friends and colleagues. He was predeceased by his daughter Mary Ann, his parents and his sister Mary. Visitation will be at Fairchild Sons Funeral Home, 1570 Northern Blvd., Manhasset, Saturday from 7 to 9pm and Sunday from 3 to 5 and 7 to 9pm. The funeral Mass will be at St. Mary's Church, 1300 Northern Blvd., Manhasset, Monday at 10am. Interment will be at St. John's Cemetery, Middle Village. In lieu of flowers, the family asks that contributions in Joe's memory be made to the West of Ireland Alzheimer Foundation, Main Street, Ballindine, County Mayo, Ireland, or to the Nassau County Firefighters Burn Center Foundation, PO Box 246, Levittown, NY 11756."

2007-05-18T00:00:00Z,"The police arrested Khaled el-Masri, the German citizen of Lebanese descent who says he was subjected to the Central Intelligence Agency's practice of extraordinary rendition, on suspicion of setting a fire at a market in the Bavarian town of Neu-Ulm that caused an estimated $675,000 in damage, his lawyer said. A judge ordered him held in the psychiatric ward of a local hospital. The lawyer, Manfred Gnjidic, said in a telephone interview that Mr. Masri, who says he was seized while on vacation in Macedonia in 2003 and flown to Afghanistan, where he was questioned about ties to terrorist groups and beaten, had had a dispute with the store and that his action was a result of not having received the psychological counseling he had sought. ''I have asked several times from the beginning for psychological help, but without any luck,'' Mr. Gnjidic said. ''The very ironic thing is that he will get psychological help now, after he committed a crime, and as a torture victim didn't get it before, when he asked for it.'' SOUAD MEKHENNET"

The 10 buildings on view, some landmarks, include an 1888 neo-Grec home with original mahogany woodwork and embossed wallpaper, an 1895 carriage house and a 1901 four-story brownstone decorated in Moorish revival style. ''Everyone comes away with something that they can use in their own home, whether it's a renovation or a design sense,'' said Maryann Feeney, a trustee of the Park Slope Civic Council and an organizer of the tour.

Despite enthusiastic reviews, some of them raves, the show has struggled for months, never reporting an average weekly attendance of more than 50 percent.

2007-05-18T00:00:00Z,"Congressional leaders and the White House began what they said they hoped were the final talks on an Iraq war spending bill on Thursday as Democrats braced for potential defections by lawmakers leery of any compromise with President Bush. The likelihood that any final agreement will specify no withdrawal date for American troops from Iraq raised the possibility that antiwar Democrats will not support it, particularly in the House, and that the measure will need substantial Republican support to pass."

2007-05-18T00:00:00Z,"''Why, in a few months, it'll be up in lights on Broadway: 'Kong -- the Eighth Wonder of the World,' '' Carl Denham (Robert Armstrong) said in the 1933 film. King Kong did go on to make a Broadway debut in the movie, before he grabbed Ann Darrow (Fay Wray) and bolted to the top of the Empire State Building. Now the big lug, reincarnated yet again, is returning to the stage, in the East Village this time, when ''King Kong'' opens on Thursday at the Red Room Theater. Don't expect to see a sweaty actor in a furry suit: this ''King Kong'' is a production of Horse Trade and RadioTheater, the three-year-old company run by Dan Bianchi. Some of the company's earlier endeavors, like the pulp fiction takeoff ''Hard Boiled'' and another version of ''King Kong,'' strived to recreate the real atmosphere of a 1940s radio station and perhaps went too far. Mr. Bianchi, the group's founder and director, had set out to create something new, inspired by the golden age of radio, but the period costumes and entrances and exits of past productions made the shows too much like regular plays, he said. ''We were creating a museum piece. If you're going to go that far, where is the big King Kong?'' The new version, adapted and directed by Mr. Bianchi, is a bare-bones presentation meant to focus on the aural experience of the audience. ''I looked to sound as being the one element that is often neglected or relegated to last on the list of priorities,'' said Mr. Bianchi, who also did the score and sound design. Expect a good yarn with plenty of music and sound effects from a cast of plainly clad actors creating characters with just their voices (above, from left, Tom Lacey, Karyn Plonsky and Mark Vance). The audience members' imaginations provide the set and the giant ape costume. (Thursday through June 10, Red Room Theater, 85 East Fourth Street, East Village, 212-868-4444, smarttix.com; $20.)

That term has been reduced by slightly more than half, to 23 days, and she will serve it in a special-needs housing unit, separating her from the general inmate population. The decision to reduce her sentence was announced after a review of her case. Steve Whitmore, a spokesman for the Los Angeles County sheriff, said jail officials gave Ms. Hilton, 26, credit for good behavior, including her recent court appearance. At the 2,200-inmate Century Regional Detention Center in suburban Lynwood, she will be incarcerated in a unit comprising 12 two-person cells reserved for high-profile prisoners, including police officers, public officials and celebrities. ''She may or may not have a cellmate,'' Mr. Whitmore said. Like everyone else, she will be given at least an hour daily to shower, watch television, take part in outdoor recreation or talk on the telephone. Ms. Hilton was sentenced this month for violating terms of her probation in an alcohol-related driving case. A judge ordered her to report to jail by June 5.

The film, directed by Edward Zwick (''Blood Diamond''), is based on a true story. Production is to begin in September. Filming of the next Bond is expected to begin in the winter, with release planned for Nov. 7, 2008. Footnotes The 45th New York Film Festival will take place from Sept. 28 through Oct. 14.

It had been in the collection of the Albright-Knox Art Gallery in Buffalo, which is selling -- over the protests of some patrons -- several older works to increase its endowment for buying contemporary art. In March, the first in the series of sales made the gallery more than $18 million. A rare 10th-century granite statue depicting the Hindu god Shiva as Brahma sold to the Cleveland Museum of Art for slightly more than $4 million, an auction record for a work of traditional Indian art.

Tonight the favorite is City Ballet, which is performing a ''Greek Trilogy'' program -- ''Apollo,'' ''Orpheus'' and ''Agon'' -- at the New York State Theater, edging out Ballet Theater's ''Bayadère'' at the Metropolitan Opera House. It is hard to beat City Ballet's program of Balanchine works set to Stravinsky, especially with the likes of Nikolaj Hübbe (above, in ''Apollo''), Wendy Whelan and Maria Kowroski scheduled to dance. In fact, the company is looking pretty good this weekend, with Christopher Wheeldon's dreamy ''Carousel (A Dance)'' sandwiched between ''Square Dance'' and ''Symphony in C,'' two Balanchine masterworks, for tomorrow's matinee, and a repeat of ''A Greek Trilogy'' on Sunday afternoon. But the decision tomorrow night is trickier. City Ballet offers ''Carousel'' and Andrei Ratmansky's sinuous ''Middle Duet,'' as well as a number of debuts in Jerome Robbins's ''Moves'' and Balanchine's ''Sonnambula,'' all part of its ''Four Voices'' program. Lovely, right? Well, the ''Bayadère'' cast for that night will be led by Stella Abrera, Ethan Stiefel and the sublime Diana Vishneva. Good grief -- what's a balletomane to do?

2007-05-18T00:00:00Z,"Brightening our day is the arrival of the Madison Square Park Conservancy's public-art series. This year the installation is made up of two stainless-steel tree sculptures -- ''Conjoined'' and ''Defunct'' -- and a glacierlike boulder, ''Erratic,'' by Roxy Paine, a conceptual artist who often juxtaposes nature and modern industrialization. The tree sculptures are made from thousands of pieces of metal pipe and rod elements that have been cut, welded and polished. They are real enough to resemble actual trees but not so real that they form a continuum with the surrounding foliage. They are familiar but inescapably strange. The work that captures your immediate attention is ''Conjoined,'' right, a 40-foot-tall-by-45-foot-wide sculpture of two trees whose gleaming steel branches cantilever and then improbably connect in midair. It is impossible to tell where the branches of one tree begin and the other end. But the piece is also beautifully eccentric, a futuristic fantasy of streamlined vegetation manufactured in imitation of the real thing, only much more appealing and exciting. ''Conjoined'' is an eerily apt emblem for our era's obsession with the promises of cloning and genetic enhancement. As for Mr. Paine, no other artist I know so poetically addresses the fraught intersection of earth and art.

Scott Ellis directs a talent-packed cast that includes Debra Monk and Karen Ziemba. (2:30). Al Hirschfeld Theater, 302 West 45th Street, Clinton, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley) 'DEUCE' Back on Broadway for the first time in 25 years, Angela Lansbury is so vitally and indelibly present that she even gives flesh to this flimsy comedy. Terrence McNally's play, about the reunion of two former doubles partners (Ms. Lansbury and Marian Seldes), is a jerry-built shrine to enduring star power. Directed by Michael Blakemore (1:45). Music Box Theater, 239 West 45th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley) * 'FROST/NIXON' Frank Langella turns in a truly titanic performance as Richard M. Nixon in Peter Morgan's briskly entertaining, if all-too-tidy, play about the former president's annihilating television interviews with the British talk show host David Frost (the excellent Michael Sheen). Michael Grandage directs with the momentum of a ticking-bomb thriller and the zing of a boulevard comedy (1:40). Jacobs Theater, 242 West 45th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley) * 'GREY GARDENS' Christine Ebersole is absolutely glorious as the middle-aged, time-warped debutante called Little Edie Beale in this uneven musical adaptation of the notorious 1975 documentary of the same title. She and the wonderful Mary Louise Wilson (as her bedridden mother), in the performances of their careers, make ''Grey Gardens'' an experience no passionate theatergoer should miss (2:40). Walter Kerr Theater, 219 West 48th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley) 'INHERIT THE WIND' Doug Hughes's wooden revival of this worthy war horse, based on the Scopes ''monkey'' trial of 1925, never musters much more velocity than a drugstore fan. Be grateful that the cast includes Christopher Plummer, in savory form as a Will Rogers of jurisprudence. An oddly subdued Brian Dennehy plays his pompous adversary (2:00). Lyceum Theater, 149 West 45th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley) * 'JOURNEY'S END' A splendid revival of R. C. Sherriff's 1928 drama of life in the trenches during World War I. Acutely staged (by David Grindley) and acted by a fine ensemble led by Hugh Dancy and Boyd Gaines, this production offers an exemplary presentation of that theatrical rarity, an uncompromising, clear-eyed play about war and the experience of day-to-day combat. An essential ticket (2:40). Belasco Theater, 111 West 44th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley) 'LEGALLY BLONDE' This nonstop sugar rush of a musical about a powder puff who finds her inner power-broker, based on the 2001 film, approximates the experience of eating a jumbo bag of Gummi Bears in one sitting. Flossing between songs is recommended (2:20). Palace Theater, 1564 Broadway, at 47th Street, (212) 307-4100. (Brantley) 'LOVEMUSIK' As Lotte Lenya and Kurt Weill, Donna Murphy and Michael Cerveris turn in stunningly shaded performances in what is, alas, a sluggish, mixed-up bio-musical. Scored with an eclectic sampler of Weill's songs, ''LoveMusik'' strives to achieve chilly distance and cozy intimacy in the same breath. Harold Prince directs; Alfred Uhry wrote the conventionally sentimental book (2:40). Biltmore Theater, 261 West 47th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley) 'MARY POPPINS' This handsome, homily-packed, mechanically ingenious and rather tedious musical, adapted from the P. L. Travers stories and the 1964 film, is ultimately less concerned with inexplicable magic than with practical psychology. Ashley Brown, who sings prettily as the family-mending nanny, looks like Joan Crawford trying to be nice and sounds like Dr. Phil. Directed by Richard Eyre and Matthew Bourne (2:30). New Amsterdam Theater, 214 West 42nd Street, (212) 307-4747. (Brantley) 'LES MISÉRABLES' This premature revival, a slightly scaled-down version of the well-groomed behemoth that closed only three years ago, appears to be functioning in a state of mild sedation. Appealingly sung and freshly orchestrated, this fast-moving adaptation of Victor Hugo's novel isn't sloppy or blurry. But its pulse rate stays well below normal (2:55). Broadhurst Theater, 235 West 44th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley) 'A MOON FOR THE MISBEGOTTEN' Kevin Spacey gives a bizarre, beat-the-clock performance, as lively as a frog on a hot plate, as James Tyrone in this off-kilter revival of Eugene O'Neill's last play. Mercifully, he does not block the view of Eve Best, who maps the contradictory levels of Tyrone's strapping love interest with clarity and intelligence (2:50). Brooks Atkinson Theater, 256 West 47th Street, (212) 307-4100. (Brantley) '110 IN THE SHADE' Is it possible for a performance to be too good? Audra McDonald brings such breadth of skill and depth of feeling to Lonny Price's lukewarm revival of this musical about a love-starved spinster that she threatens to burst the seams of this small, homey musical. She's an overwhelming presence in an underwhelming show (2:30). Studio 54, 254 West 54th Street, (212) 719-1300. (Brantley) 'THE PIRATE QUEEN' How to river-dance your way to the bottom of the ocean, courtesy of the songwriters of ''Les Misérables'' (2:30). Hilton Theater, 213 West 42nd Street, (212) 307-4100. (Brantley) 'RADIO GOLF' The final -- and in dramatic terms, the weakest -- of August Wilson's magnificent 10-play cycle about the African-American experience, ''Radio Golf'' has the crackle of a bustling comedy. But this tale of getting and spending in the 1990s, directed by Kenny Leon, throbs with a lament for a lost time, a lost culture, a lost language (2:30). Cort Theater, 138 West 48th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley) * 'SPRING AWAKENING' Duncan Sheik and Steven Sater's bold adaptation of the Frank Wedekind play is the freshest and most exciting new musical Broadway has seen in some time. Set in 19th-century Germany but with a ravishing rock score, it exposes the splintered emotional lives of adolescents just discovering the joys and sorrows of sex. Performed with brio by a great cast, with supple direction by Michael Mayer and inventive choreography by Bill T. Jones (2:00). Eugene O'Neill Theater, 230 West 49th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Isherwood) * 'TALK RADIO' The most lacerating portrait of a human meltdown this side of a Francis Bacon painting. Playing an abrasive radio talk show host with a God complex, the astounding Liev Schreiber seems to fill the air as inescapably as weather in Robert Falls's gut-grabbing revival of Eric Bogosian's 1987 play (1:40). Longacre Theater, 220 West 48th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley) 'THE YEAR OF MAGICAL THINKING' Joan Didion's arresting but ultimately frustrating adaptation of her best-selling memoir about being blindsided by grief, starring Vanessa Redgrave. The tension between style and emotional content that made the book such a stunner does not translate to the stage. The substance here is in the silences, when the focus shifts from words to Ms. Redgrave's wry, wounded face (1:40). Booth Theater, 222 West 45th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley) Off Broadway 'ALL THE WRONG REASONS: A TRUE STORY OF NEO-NAZIS, DRUG SMUGGLING AND UNDYING LOVE' John Fugelsang's amiable solo show mixes memoir and stand-up comedy in a tale of family, faith and Roman Catholic guilt. Slight but engaging (1:30). New York Theater Workshop, 79 East Fourth Street, East Village, (212) 460-5475. (Isherwood) 'BE' A high-energy, low-content Israeli show that blends music, dance and sex appeal in the latest attempt to tap into the ''Stomp'' market (1:30). Union Square Theater, 100 East 17th Street, Flatiron district, (212) 307-4100. (Jason Zinoman) 'BETROTHED' Rachel Dickstein weds dance and spoken drama in a distinctive theatrical language. The marriages in this lovely and uneven work are less convincing: aiming to depict women's views about matrimony, this piece, based on three dissimilar short stories, actually depicts marriage as an imprisoning convention from which all three heroines escape. It's no accident that the first part of this triptych, based on Jhumpa Lahiri's story ''The Treatment of Bibi Haldar,'' provides the defining image of the work as a whole: wreathed in a haze of (implied) incense and saffron, this lovely sequence is the strongest of the evening (1:20). Ohio Theater, 66 Wooster Street, SoHo, (212) 868-4444. (Anne Midgette) 'BILL W. AND DR. BOB' This insightful new play about the founders of Alcoholics Anonymous subtly makes the claim that the recovery movement was born as a series of accidents. Patrick Husted is excellent as Bob Smith, Bill Wilson's partner in combating addictions (2:15). New World Stages, 340 West 50th Street, Clinton, (212) 239-6200. (Bellafante) * 'BLACKBIRD' David Harrower's stunning new drama looks back at a sexual relationship -- between a 40-year-old man and a 12-year-old girl -- that transforms, cripples and paralyzes. Jeff Daniels and Alison Pill, both extraordinary, peel their characters down to their barest souls. Joe Mantello is the masterly director (1:30). Manhattan Theater Club at City Center Stage I, 131 West 55th Street, (212) 581-1212. (Brantley) 'DAUGHTER OF A CUBAN REVOLUTIONARY' A standard-issue solo play about a fascinating Cuban family (1:10). DR2 Theater, 103 East 15th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Zinoman) 'THE FANTASTICKS' A revival -- well, more like a resuscitation -- of the Little Musical That Wouldn't Die. This sweet-as-ever production of Tom Jones and Harvey Schmidt's commedia-dell'arte-style confection is most notable for Mr. Jones's touching performance (under the pseudonym Thomas Bruce) as the Old Actor, a role he created when the show opened in 1960. Mr. Jones also directs (2:05). Snapple Theater Center, 210 West 50th Street, (212) 307-4100. (Brantley) 'GOD'S EAR' Jenny Schwartz's formally inventive and brilliantly performed drama about how the death of a child affects a family is more interested in language than in narrative (1:20). East 13th Street Theater, 136 East 13th Street, East Village, (212) 868-4444. (Zinoman) * 'IN THE HEIGHTS' Lin-Manuel Miranda's joyous songs paint a vibrant portrait of daily life in Washington Heights in this flawed but enjoyable show. Essentially a valentine to the barrio -- conflict of a violent or desperate kind is banished from the picture -- the musical contains a host of funny performances and brings the zesty sound of Latin pop to the stage. (2:10). 37 Arts, 450 West 37th Street, (212) 307-4100. (Isherwood) 'A JEW GROWS IN BROOKLYN' You don't have to be Jewish or Brooklynish to empathize with Jake Ehrenreich, but in terms of fully appreciating his essentially one-man show, it probably helps. Especially the Catskills jokes (2:05). 37 Arts, 450 West 37th Street, (212) 560-8912. (Anita Gates) 'MOTHER LOAD' In her one-woman show on the perils of affluent motherhood, Amy Wilson derides the culture of obsessive child-rearing as she chronicles her submission to it. An affable presence onstage, Ms. Wilson nevertheless mines overly clichéd territory: the nut allergies, the horrors of preschool admission, the importance of knowing two languages by the time you are 3. Posters on Urbanbaby.com will find themselves amusedly looking in the mirror. All other New Yorkers will find themselves wanting to move to Patagonia (1:15). Sage Theater, 711 Seventh Avenue, at 47th Street, (212) 279-4200. (Bellafante) 'MY MOTHER'S ITALIAN, MY FATHER'S JEWISH AND I'M IN THERAPY' Steve Solomon does skillful impersonations in his one-man show, but some of his jokes are as old as the hills (1:30).Westside Theater Downstairs, 407 West 43rd Street, (212) 239-6200. (Gates) 'NO CHILD' Teachers will love Nilaja Sun's one-woman show about the challenges of teaching drama at Malcolm X High School (1:10). Barrow Street Theater, 27 Barrow Street, at Seventh Avenue South, West Village, (212) 239-6200. (Gates) 'THE RECeiPT' A lost bar receipt provides a one-way ticket to bedlam in a clever and diverting show that mirrors the idiosyncrasies of modern life as two young archaeologists study a ''lost'' city and postulate on a day in the life of one of its inhabitants (1:15). 59E59 Theaters, 59 East 59th Street, (212) 279-4200. (Wilborn Hampton) * 'SPALDING GRAY: STORIES LEFT TO TELL' A disarming collage of selections from the monologues and journals of Mr. Gray, the ultimate stand-up solipsist, who died in 2004. Directed by Lucy Sexton, and read by five performers, none of whom resemble Mr. Gray, with an affection that shrewdly stops short of hero worship (1:30). Minetta Lane Theater, 18 Minetta Lane, Greenwich Village, (212) 307-4100. (Brantley) Off Off Broadway * 'HAMLET' Gorilla Rep specializes in outdoor performances of Shakespeare; this workshop is an indoor performance of an outdoor performance, which removes the gimmick and leaves, simply, good theater. The strong cast revolves around note-perfect portrayals of Claudius and Gertrude (Elizabeth McGuire is particularly fine); of the Polonius family (Al Twanmo plays the patriarch as a kind of insurance salesman battling forgetfulness); and, finally, of Hamlet, which Jacob H. Knoll pulls off as an angry young Dane. Christopher Carter Sanderson, the director, shows that the play's the thing, indoors or out (3:00). Roy Arias Theater Center at Times Square Arts Center, 300 West 43rd Street, Clinton. (Midgette) Long-Running Shows 'ALTAR BOYZ' This sweetly satirical show about a Christian pop group made up of five potential Teen People cover boys is an enjoyable, silly diversion (1:30). New World Stages, 340 West 50th Street, Clinton, (212) 239-6200. (Isherwood) 'AVENUE Q' R-rated puppets give lively life lessons (2:10). Golden Theater, 252 West 45th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley) 'BEAUTY AND THE BEAST' Cartoon made flesh, sort of (2:30). Lunt-Fontanne Theater, 205 West 46th Street, (212) 307-4747. (Brantley) 'CHICAGO' Irrefutable proof that crime pays (2:25). Ambassador Theater, 219 West 49th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley) 'THE DROWSY CHAPERONE' A pasteboard pastiche of 1920's musicals, as remembered by a witty show queen(1:40). Marquis Theater, 1535 Broadway, at 45th Street, (212) 307-4100. (Brantley) 'FORBIDDEN BROADWAY: SPECIAL VICTIMS UNIT' Often more entertaining than the real thing (1:45). 47th Street Theater, 304 West 47th Street, Clinton, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley) 'HAIRSPRAY' Fizzy pop, cute kids, large man in a housedress (2:30). Neil Simon Theater, 250 West 52nd Street, (212) 307-4100. (Brantley) 'JERSEY BOYS' The biomusical that walks like a man (2:30). August Wilson Theater, 245 West 52nd Street, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley) 'THE LION KING' Disney on safari, where the big bucks roam (2:45). Minskoff Theater, 200 West 45th Street at Broadway, (212) 307-4100. (Brantley) 'MAMMA MIA!' The jukebox that devoured Broadway (2:20). Cadillac Winter Garden Theater, 1634 Broadway, at 50th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley) 'THE PHANTOM OF THE OPERA' Who was that masked man, anyway? (2:30). Majestic Theater, 247 West 44th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley) 'RENT' East Village angst and love songs to die for (2:45). Nederlander Theater, 208 West 41st Street, (212) 307-4100. (Brantley) 'SPAMALOT' A singing scrapbook for Monty Python fans (2:20). Shubert Theater, 225 West 44th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley) 'TARZAN' A writhing green blob with music (2:30). Richard Rodgers Theater, 226 West 46th Street, (212) 307-4747. (Brantley) 'THE 25TH ANNUAL PUTNAM COUNTY SPELLING BEE' ''A Chorus Line'' with pimples (1:45). Circle in the Square, 254 West 50th Street, Manhattan, (212) 239-6200. (Isherwood) 'WICKED' Oz revisited, with political corrections (2:45). Gershwin Theater, 222 West 51st Street, Manhattan, (212) 307-4100. (Brantley) Last Chance 'BAD BLOOD (MALASANGRE)' A wife is offered a lucrative job in Texas; her husband moves with her from Puerto Rico but rails against the condition of being a Latino in the United States. Presented in Spanish and English on different nights, this play by Roberto Ramos Perea is full of ideas and anger, but the political fury of the husband is not, in the English version, completely borne out by his characterization, and you can see the charting of the play a little too clearly between the lines (2:30). Puerto Rican Traveling Theater, 304 West 47th Street, Clinton, (212) 354-1293; closes on Sunday. (Midgette) 'BEYOND THERAPY' This Christopher Durang play is still pretty funny, and all the more interesting because it is performed in American Sign Language by New York Deaf Theater. Unobtrusive speaking actors provide the dialogue for the benefit of nonsigners, but in the production's best moments they're hardly needed, so animated are the actors and their hands (1:45.) Actors Theater Workshop, 145 West 28th Street, Chelsea, (212) 868-4444; closes on Sunday. (Neil Genzlinger) 'COUPLES' An evening of eight one-acts offers an update on the battle of the sexes. Some skits work better than others, but each has a kernel of conflict and flashes of humor. Likewise, some characters are more fully drawn, while others border on stereotype. The best of the two-handers, however, is both funny and poignant (1:40). WorkShop Theater Company, 312 West 36th Street, fourth floor, (212) 695-4173; closes tomorrow. (Hampton) 'ON THE VERGE' An amusing revival of Eric Overmyer's play about three Victoria-era ladies who set out, armed with parasols and machetes, to explore a terra incognita. As they ''whack the bushes'' into virgin territory, they soon discover they are traveling into the future (2:00). Connelly Theater, 220 East Fourth Street, East Village, (212) 777-4280; closes tomorrow. (Hampton) 'REALISM' and 'JUMP!' The stately Jean Cocteau Repertory (now known as the Exchange) gets a hipster makeover with two foul-mouthed and aggressive new provocations from Britain (1:30 each). Kirk Theater, 420 West 42nd Street, Clinton, (212) 279-4200; closes on Sunday. (Zinoman) * 'WEST MOON STREET' Rob Urbinati's adaptation of Oscar Wilde's short story ''Lord Arthur Savile's Crime'' delightfully mines a comedy of manners, a meditation on premarital fear, out of a clever mystery of fate. The performances, one and all, are first-rate (2:00). Hudson Guild Theater, 441 West 26th Street, Chelsea, (212) 352-3101; closes on Sunday. (Bellafante) Movies Ratings and running times are in parentheses; foreign films have English subtitles. Full reviews of all current releases, movie trailers, show times and tickets: nytimes.com/movies. * 'AWAY FROM HER' (PG-13, 110 minutes) Sarah Polley's well-observed adaptation of a story by Alice Munro is a quiet tour de force about love and loss, anchored by fine performances by Gordon Pinsent and Julie Christie as a couple dealing with the loss of memory and memories of past hurt. (A. O. Scott) 'Blades of Glory' (PG-13, 93 minutes) In this fast, light, frequently funny comedy about a male figure-skating team, Will Ferrell and Jon Heder stake an early claim to being the comedy couple of the year. (Stephen Holden) * 'BRAND UPON THE BRAIN' (No rating, 96 minutes) A baroque entertainment with one foot in silent cinema and the other gingerly toeing the sound waves, Guy Maddin's latest centers on a man who, in visiting a now-emptied foundling home, journeys deep into his childhood. It's wild! It's weird! It's strangely touching and a total must-see! (Manohla Dargis) 'CASTING ABOUT' (No rating, 86 minutes) The documentary filmmaker Barry J. Hershey (''The Empty Mirror'') has created this record of casting calls for lead actresses in a dramatic feature that he wrote but has yet to direct: a seemingly Hemingwayesque drama involving a wounded combat photographer, a nun, a dancer and a painter's model. ''Casting About'' is a solid documentary about how art is made but it is also an unnerving inquiry into power relationships between filmmakers and performers and, more pointedly, between men and women. (Matt Zoller Seitz) THE CONDEMNED' (R, 100 minutes) This simple-minded vehicle for the wrestling star Steve Austin follows a bunch of muscle-bound lowlifes as they fight to the death for the benefit of an Internet reality show. Leaden and inept, the movie fails to deliver even the action goods, presenting every fight scene in such quaking, extreme close-up that it's difficult to tell who's pummeling whom. Fortunately, the language of pain is universal. (Jeannette Catsoulis) * 'DAY NIGHT DAY NIGHT' (No rating, 94 minutes) For most of its 94 minutes, this gripping but evasive portrait of an unidentified 19-year-old terrorist undertaking a suicide bombing mission in Times Square focuses on the face of its star, Luisa Williams. (Holden) 'DELTA FARCE' (PG-13, 90 minutes) In his second vehicle Larry the Cable Guy takes greater risks, sharing significant screen time with two co-stars (his ''Blue Collar Comedy'' colleague Bill Engvall and D J Qualls) and asking viewers to accept him as a soldier and romantic leading man. When he and his buds are plunked down in Mexico en route to Iraq and liberate a village plagued by marauders, a metaphor for the war proves utterly brain-dead. For starters, where's the oil? (Andy Webster) 'DISTURBIA' (PG-13, 104 minutes) A pleasant, scary, well-directed variation on the killer-next-door theme, with the engaging Shia LeBeouf as Kale, a young man who turns house arrest into an occasion for voyeurism and crime-fighting. (Scott) 'THE EX' (PG-13, 89 minutes) The best jokes in this scattershot screwball satire -- about the cutthroat workplace, job insecurity, upward mobility, political correctness, yuppie marital tensions, and the disabled -- have claws that leave scratches. (Holden) 'FRACTURE' (R, 111 minutes) A glib entertainment that offers up the spectacle of that crafty scene-stealer Anthony Hopkins mixing it up with that equally cunning screen-nibbler Ryan Gosling. (Dargis) 'GEORGIA RULE' (R, 111 minutes) Jane Fonda, Felicity Huffman and Lindsay Lohan play three generations of strong-willed, dysfunctional women in this comedy-melodrama from Garry Marshall. It's a mess, but it does have some vitality, thanks mainly to Ms. Fonda and Ms. Lohan. (Scott) * 'THE HOAX' (R, 115 minutes) A first-rate performance by Richard Gere drives this true story of Clifford Irving (Mr. Gere), who claimed to be the authorized biographer of Howard Hughes. Shadowed by the paranoia of its period (the early '70s), this movie, crisply directed by Lasse Hallstrom from an excellent script by William Weaver, is less a morality play than an entertaining portrait of a literary gambler. (Scott) * 'HOT FUZZ' (R, 121 minutes) A British parody of Hollywood-style action flicks from the wits behind ''Shaun of the Dead.'' Think of it as ''The Full Monty'' blown to smithereens. (Dargis) 'I DON'T WANT TO SLEEP ALONE' (No rating, 115 minutes, in Taiwanese, Malay, Mandarin and Bengali) A dreamy, melancholy tale of three-way desire, shot in Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia, and imagined by the director Tsai Ming-Liang with his usual blend of sensuality and formal rigor. (Scott) 'IN THE LAND OF WOMEN' (PG-13, 98 minutes) This mopey comedy is the film equivalent of a sensitive emo band with one foot in alternative rock and the other in the squishy pop mainstream. The movie would like to think of itself as a softer, fuzzier ''Garden State.'' (Holden) 'THE INVISIBLE' (PG-13, 102 minutes) This supremely silly retread of the 2002 Swedish film ''Den Osynlige'' proves it's tough to be in love and in limbo at one and the same time. When a rich-yet-troubled teenager (Justin Chatwin) crosses paths with a violently disturbed classmate (Margarita Levieva), we learn that there's nothing quite like a near-death experience to repair those stubborn emotional wounds. (Catsoulis) * 'KILLER OF SHEEP' (No rating, 83 minutes) Largely hidden from view for three decades, Charles Burnett's lyrical film about a working-class family living in a broken-down home in a bombed-out stretch of Los Angeles is an American masterpiece. (Dargis) 'LUCKY YOU' (PG-13, 124 minutes) Eric Bana plays a poker player with daddy issues (Robert Duvall is his dad), and Drew Barrymore is an aspiring singer who catches his eye in this tepid Las Vegas romance. It's not terrible, just content to break even. (Scott) 'MEET THE ROBINSONS' (G, 93 minutes) Actually, if you see them coming, run in the other direction. (Scott) 'NEXT' (PG-13, 96 minutes) Nicolas Cage plays a guy who can see into the future in this crummy adaptation of a nifty Philip K. Dick story. Too bad Mr. Cage couldn't tap into those same powers to save himself from another bad role. (Dargis) * 'ONCE' (R, 88 minutes) A modest, scruffy movie about two musicians who meet on a Dublin street and sort of fall in love. Charming, touching and true. (Scott) 'PARIS JE T'AIME' (R, 120 minutes, in French and English) ''Paris Je T'Aime,'' a mosaic of 18 miniatures, each set in a different location in the City of Light, is a cinematic tasting menu consisting entirely of amuse-bouches. After two hours of such tidbits, the palate is sated. But if there is no need for a main course, you still leave feeling vaguely disappointed at not being served one. (Holden) 'PERFECT STRANGER' (R, 109 minutes) There is enough of a grain of truth in this noirish, paranoid thriller set in the New York media world that even after it lurches from the farfetched into the preposterous, the movie leaves a clammy residue of unease. (Holden) 'PROVOKED' (No rating, 113 minutes) Holding fast to the movie-of-the-week formula perfected by Lifetime Television, Jag Mundhra's overly restrained drama is based on the true story of Kiranjit Ahluwalia, a London-based Punjabi housewife who torched her sleeping husband in 1989 after suffering a decade of abuse. Unfortunately, by keeping its inflammatory subject matter at arm's length, ''Provoked'' does exactly the same to its audience. (Catsoulis) 'SHOWBUSINESS' (PG, 102 minutes) This documentary by Dori Bernstein follows four Broadway musicals from rehearsal through the 2004 Tony Awards: ''Caroline, or Change''; ''Taboo''; ''Avenue Q''; and ''Wicked.'' On top of the usual challenges (fund-raising, rewrites, tryouts, marketing), they all had to endure scrutiny by theater critics and gossip columnists. Lively, sometimes cutting but mostly humane, ''ShowBusiness'' is packed with telling details. (Seitz) 'SPIDER-MAN 3' (PG-13, 139 minutes) Please, God, make this be the last one. (Dargis) 'TA RA RUM PUM' (No rating, 156 minutes, in English and Hindi) This movie about a race car driver (the versatile Saif Ali Khan) takes place in New York, but that doesn't stop it from being a classic example of Bollywood family values. Here, all the city's a stage set, perfect for ''Fame''-meets-''West Side Story'' production numbers. (Rachel Saltz) '300' (R, 116 minutes) Greeks versus Persians in the big rumble at Thermopylae, via Frank Miller's graphic novel. As dumb as they get. (Scott) 'THE TREATMENT' (No rating, 86 minutes) Oren Rydavsky's adaptation of the Daniel Menaker novel about love and psychoanalysis in New York has its heart and head in the right place, but not much else, including its sympathetic stars, Chris Eigeman, Famke Janssen and Ian Holm. (Dargis) * 28 WEEKS LATER' (R, 91 minutes) The virus that killed off most of England -- after turning its population into rabid, flesh-hungry zombies -- seems to be under control at the start of this terrifying sequel to ''28 Days Later.'' But if anything, the horror is deeper, and the social criticism more acute. (Scott) 'VACANCY' (R, 80 minutes) This banal horror retread involves a couple of critters (Luke Wilson, Kate Beckinsale) flailing inside a sticky trap for what is, in effect, the big-screen equivalent of a roach motel. (Dargis) * 'THE VALET' (PG-13, 85 minutes, in French) If you love to hate the superrich, this delectable comedy, in which the great French actor Daniel Auteuil portrays a piggy billionaire industrialist facing his comeuppance, is a sinfully delicious bonbon, a classic French farce with modern touches. (Holden) * 'WAITRESS' (PG-13, 104 minutes) Keri Russell is a small-town waitress in a bad marriage who finds solace in pie-baking and adultery in Adrienne Shelly's wry and winning final feature. (Scott) * 'YEAR OF THE DOG' (PG-13, 97 minutes) Mike White's touching comedy about a woman who loses a dog and finds herself is funny ha-ha but firmly in touch with its downer side, which means that it's also funny in a kind of existential way. Molly Shannon stars alongside a menagerie of howling scene-stealers. (Dargis) 'ZOO' (No rating, 76 minutes) Robinson Devor's heavily reconstructed documentary is, to a large extent, about the rhetorical uses of beauty. It is, rather more coyly, also about a man who died after having sex with a stallion. (Dargis) Film Series JEAN GENET ON FILM (Monday and Tuesday) This French writer, radical and colorful ex-criminal is represented by two of his works adapted for film: Christopher Miles's 1974 version of ''The Maids,'' starring Glenda Jackson and Susannah York (Monday), and Tony Richardson's ''Mademoiselle'' (1966), based on a Genet story as touched up by Marguerite Duras (Tuesday).

(Kehr) ALLAN KING (Tonight through Thursday) A continuing retrospective devoted to one of Canada's most accomplished documentary-makers, who is not to be confused with his near-namesake, the comedian Alan King. This is unlikely for anyone who has seen the searing film ''A Married Couple,'' Mr. King's 1969 cinéma-verité study of a marriage in crisis, which is screening tonight. ''The Dragon's Egg: Making Peace on the Wreckage of the Twentieth Century'' (1999), screening tomorrow, concerns the uneasy relationship between native Estonians and the Russians imported into their country by Stalin. ''Dying at Grace'' (2003), one of Mr. King's most recent films, is an intimate portrait of five terminal patients in a Toronto Salvation Army hospital (Wednesday and Thursday). Museum of Modern Art Roy and Niuta Titus Theaters, (212) 708-9400, moma.org; $10. (Kehr) LEE MARVIN: THE COOLEST LETHAL WEAPON (Today through Thursday) Week 2 of a retrospective devoted to Marvin, a silver-haired ex-marine who became one of the last great movie stars. Highlights this week include ''The Spikes Gang,'' a rarely screened 1974 coming-of-age film directed by the perennially underestimated Richard Fleischer and featuring Marvin as a wounded outlaw who takes three teenagers under his wing (tonight and tomorrow); Robert Aldrich's 1973 Darwinian duke-out ''Emperor of the North Pole'' (Saturday and Tuesday); and, for the truly fearless, a brand new print of Joshua Logan's insanely misconceived musical ''Paint Your Wagon'' (Sunday), with a talk-singing Marvin joining the nonsinging Jean Seberg and the barely verbal Clint Eastwood in a frontier ménage-à-trois. Walter Reade Theater, 165 West 65th Street, Lincoln Center, (212) 875-5600, filmlinc.org; $11. (Kehr) Pop Full reviews of recent concerts: nytimes.com/music.

(Ben Sisario) JOSEPH ARTHUR (Wednesday) Romance, despair and the struggle for faith intermingle in Mr. Arthur's songs, which can float in a gorgeous acoustic reverie or flare up in electrified anger.

(Sisario) DAN BERN (Tuesday) With a nasal sing-speak that recalls the young Bob Dylan, Dan Bern offers smooth folk-rock and a world-weary cynicism.

At 9 p.m., Southpaw, 125 Fifth Avenue, near Sterling Place, Park Slope, Brooklyn, (718) 230-0236, spsounds.com; $16.

Also on the bill this week is Mike Viola, whose strident power-pop is laced with jagged wit. At 8 p.m., 154 Ludlow Street, near Stanton Street, Lower East Side, (212) 533-7235, livingroomny.com; no cover. Mr. Campilongo's trio also plays on Thursday at 8 p.m. at Barbès, 376 Ninth Street, at Sixth Avenue, Park Slope, Brooklyn, (718) 965-9177, barbesbrooklyn.com; $10. (Sisario) * VINICIO CAPOSSELA (Tuesday) Calling himself an ''enchanter,'' Mr. Capossela, one of the cleverest and most eccentric musicians in Italy, spins enigmatic fantasies of both skid row Americana and mythological Italy in a grittily elegant cabaret-jazz style that recalls Tom Waits and Paolo Conte. He makes his American debut at Joe's Pub with a band that will include the guitarist Marc Ribot, a Waits collaborator who has appeared on Mr. Capossela's records as well. At 7:30 p.m., 425 Lafayette Street, at Astor Place, East Village, (212) 967-7555, joespub.com; $20. (Sisario) CITIZEN COPE (Sunday) Clarence Greenwood, a k a Citizen Cope, is the umpteenth singer-songwriter to use hip-hop beats and drawled, rap-sung vocals in search of novelty. With Soulive, a guitar-organ-drums group from Woodstock, N.Y., whose hip-hop-spiked jams pay groovy homage to 1960s soul-jazz and to the funk of Sly Stone and Stevie Wonder. At 8 p.m., Webster Hall, 125 East 11th Street, East Village, (212) 533-2111, bowerypresents.com; sold out. (Sisario) COCOROSIE (Tomorrow) As CocoRosie, the Casady sisters, Sierra and Bianca, make a swirling psychodrama out of hints of trip-hop, chirping crickets and cooed Billie Holiday-ish vocals. For this concert they will be accompanied by teenage poets presented by UrbanWord NYC, an organization that offers free writing workshops for young people. At 7:30 p.m., Winter Garden, World Financial Center, West Street, south of Vesey Street, Lower Manhattan, (212) 945-0505, worldfinancialcenter.com; free. (Sisario) DEVIN THE DUDE (Tonight) This Houston rapper, a raunchy but self-deprecating comedian with a mellow flow, has lingered on the fringes of fame since making an appearance on Dr. Dre's album ''2001,'' released eight years ago. He might learn a lesson from Snoop Dogg, André 3000 and the other big names who have guest spots on his new album, ''Waitin' to Inhale'' (Rap-a-Lot): nobody becomes a rap star by being laid-back, man. With Bavu Blakes, Grit Boys, Surreal, DJ Kutz, Gator and DJ Rapid Ric. At 10, Knitting Factory, 74 Leonard Street, TriBeCa, (212) 219-3132, knittingfactory.com; $15. (Sisario) * FROG EYES (Tonight and tomorrow night) One of the quickly multiplying side projects of members of the Canadian indie-arty band Wolf Parade (see also Handsome Furs, below), Frog Eyes sets Carey Mercer's frantic, David Bowie-like vocals against even more frantic keyboards and guitars, creating the melody-overload soundtrack to life in fast-forward. With Alex Delivery and Chris Garneau. Tonight at 8:30, Mercury Lounge, 217 East Houston Street, at Ludlow Street, Lower East Side, (212) 260-4700, mercuryloungenyc.com; $12.

(Sisario) * HANDSOME FURS (Wednesday and Thursday) ''What we had don't mean a thing'' may not be the kind of lyric you'd expect from an engaged couple. But as Handsome Furs, Dan Boeckner of Wolf Parade and his fiancée, Alexei Perry, play bleak, hollow dirges propped up by bluesy guitar and spare electronics. It's darkly beautiful and has a ring of honesty, but still, can you imagine the honeymoon? With TK Webb on Wednesday and Sam Jayne on Thursday. At 9:30 p.m., Mercury Lounge, 217 East Houston Street, at Ludlow Street, Lower East Side, (212) 260-4700, mercuryloungenyc.com; $13 in advance, $15 at the door. (Sisario) HEAVEN AND HELL (Tomorrow) Black Sabbath with Ronnie James Dio in place of Ozzy Osbourne. Again. Which means it's effectively 1980 and not very exciting. Again. Come early for the opening acts: Megadeath and Machinehead. At 7 p.m., PNC Bank Arts Center, Holmdel, N.J., (732) 203-2500, artscenter.com; $29.25 to $59.25. (Sisario) * JESUS AND MARY CHAIN (Monday and Tuesday) In the mid-'80s, William and Jim Reid of this Scottish band proved that to make so-called revolutionary rock all you need is a Beach Boys chord progression, dark waves of feedback and a whole lot of slouch. But to have a legacy -- the kind that makes people buy pricey tickets to a reunion concert, like this one -- you also need durable songs, and if the Reids' nihilistic bonbons (''Just Like Honey,'' ''Darklands'') were never hits exactly, they remain paragons of melodic economy, disfigured by noise. At 8 p.m., Webster Hall, 125 East 11th Street, East Village, (212) 533-2111, bowerypresents.com; sold out. (Sisario) JUCIFER (Tuesday) For a two-member group -- Amber Valentine on guitar and vocals, Edgar Livengood on drums -- Jucifer makes a mighty noise with its songs about death and desolation. It blasts its way through power-chorded mayhem, slow or at punk speeds, topped by Ms. Valentine's airy voice. With Object and Skeleton Breath. At 7 p.m., Europa, 98 Meserole Avenue, at Manhattan Avenue, Greenpoint, Brooklyn, (718) 383-5723, europaclub.com; $10. (Jon Pareles) TALIB KWELI (Tonight) This socially conscious Brooklyn rapper, the former partner of Mos Def in the seminal '90s group Black Star, is interested in much more than bling. With a hard-nosed, staccato style, he rhymes about ghetto entropy and geopolitics: ''I wanna write the songs to right the wrongs.'' At 11, Highline Ballroom, 431 West 16th Street, Chelsea, (212) 414-5994, highlineballroom.com; $35. (Sisario) MARTINA McBRIDE (Tonight) Nobody delivers a heavy-handed ''social issue'' song like Ms. McBride, whose soaring country-rock can make numbers about battered women (''Independence Day''), abused children (''Concrete Angel'') and teenage pregnancy (''Beautiful Again'') sound upbeat. At 8, Radio City Music Hall, (212) 307-7171, radiocity.com; $35 to $90. (Sisario) 'MOUNTAIN STAGE' (Tomorrow) Sooner or later every old-fashioned country radio program comes to New York for a broadcast from the big city.

(Sisario) NO FUN FEST (Tonight through Sunday) Now something of a spring tradition, this four-day festival of noise-rock -- and any other kind of avant-garde music, as long as it's clamorous and loud -- concludes this weekend. Tonight are Incapacitants, Mouthus with Axolotl, Sissy Spacek and Carlos Giffoni, the festival's organizer. Tomorrow's bill has the most potential, with the veteran Japanese noisemongers Merzbow and Keiji Haino, as well as Demons, Religious Knives, Tom Recchion and Oblivia.

(Sisario) JENNIFER O'CONNOR (Wednesday) Ms. O'Connor's portraits of the lovelorn and depressed, sung with the guileless vulnerability of a 2 a.m. phone confession, are dry but not unsympathetic: ''Maybe she's on her lunch break thinking of you.'' She has a Wednesday residency this month at the Living Room. At 11 p.m., 154 Ludlow Street, near Stanton Street, Lower East Side, (212) 533-7235, livingroomny.com; $8. (Sisario) OLLABELLE (Tonight) This local quintet of two women and three men worships blues, country and gospel with crystalline voices and wide eyes, playing traditional songs like ''John the Revelator'' and originals that connect them to classic roots-rock. At 7:30, Joe's Pub, at the Public Theater, 425 Lafayette Street, at Astor Place, East Village, (212) 967-7555, joespub.com; $15. (Sisario) OXFORD COLLAPSE (Thursday) Drawing from the tense jangle of 1970s and early-'80s American groups like Television and the Feelies -- a refreshing shift from the Gang of Four-Joy Division axis that has defined New York retro-rock for years -- Oxford Collapse beefs up its anxious, speedy songs with cathartic smashes and unison chants. With Centipede E'est and Excellent. At 8 p.m., Union Hall, 702 Union Street, at Fifth Avenue, Park Slope, Brooklyn, (718) 638-4400, unionhallny.com; $8. (Sisario) * JOHN PIZZARELLI AND JESSICA MOLASKEY (Tonight and tomorrow night, and Tuesday through Thursday) These married musicians have been called ''the Nick and Nora of cabaret,'' a sobriquet that only begins to describe their upbeat sophistication. They fuse two distantly related musical worlds into a larger whole in which Stephen Sondheim, Dave Frishberg, Paul Simon, and Lambert, Hendricks and Ross join hands. (Through May 26.) At 8:45, with additional shows tonight and tomorrow night at 10:45, Café Carlyle, at the Carlyle Hotel, 35 East 76th Street, Manhattan, (212) 744-1600, thecarlyle.com; $75 and $125 Tuesday through Thursday; $85 tonight and tomorrow. (Stephen Holden) PRETTY GIRLS MAKE GRAVES (Tomorrow) This Seattle band, with a knack for angular, heartfelt melodies that cut through clouds of noise, is on its farewell tour. With Moonrats and Call Me Lightning. At 9 p.m., Blender Theater at Gramercy, 127 East 23rd Street, Manhattan, (212) 307-7171; $15.50. (Sisario) ANNIE ROSS (Tuesday) When this jazz legend barks out ''I Got Rhythm,'' she turns this great Gershwin standard into a hipster's credo. If you've got as much rhythm in your body and music in your head as Ms. Ross does at 76, who indeed could ask for anything more? At 7 p.m., Metropolitan Room, 34 West 22nd Street, Flatiron district, (212) 206-0440, metropolitanroom.com; $25 cover, two-drink minimum. (Holden) SECRET MACHINES (Tomorrow) The slowly unfolding, keyboard-driven compositions of Secret Machines have a stark, minimalist side; a glimmer of country; some pulsating; and a streak of Pink Floyd grandeur that swells to fill the room. There's a haunted undercurrent amid the pomp. The band plays with the Bellmer Dolls and Dragons of Zynth as part of the High Line Festival. At 9 p.m., Highline Ballroom, 431 West 16th Street, Chelsea, (212) 414-5994, highlineballroom.com or highlinefestival.com; $26.50. (Pareles) * BEANIE SIGEL (Tuesday) Recently this gruff Philadelphia rapper has been in and out of jail, been shot in the arm and found himself caught in the middle of a big-league rap feud. But fans of Beanie Sigel, whose rhymes detail life on the lam and the sad minutiae of prison life (''You hearing grown men moan at night''), will mob this club show not only for the rare chance to see him perform -- you never know when he'll be back -- but also for a preview of his eagerly awaited new album, ''The Solution.'' At 8:30 p.m., Knitting Factory, 74 Leonard Street, TriBeCa, (212) 219-3132, knittingfactory.com; $15. (Sisario) STEELY DAN (Monday and Tuesday) In 2000 Steely Dan released its first new songs in 20 years on ''Two Against Nature,'' and its members, Donald Fagen and Walter Becker, crammed them full of musical subterfuges. The band once hated touring but has become quite proficient at it, especially now that Mr. Becker has accepted his inevitable role as lead guitarist. At 8 p.m., Beacon Theater, 2124 Broadway, at 74th Street, (212) 307-7171, beacontheatrenyc.com; sold out. (Pareles) * GWEN STEFANI, AKON, LADY SOVEREIGN (Tonight and Sunday) She may sing about morning sickness and motherhood on her latest album, ''The Sweet Escape'' (Interscope), but Gwen Stefani has not slowed down; for her latest tour expect a full-fledged pop circus, with sexed-up cheerleader routines and costumes garish enough to rival Madonna's. With Akon, the ubiquitous Senegalese-American crooner, whose amorous songs are explicit without seeming nasty. (Some disagree: Verizon withdrew its sponsorship for this tour because of Akon's onstage behavior at a recent club appearance.) Also on the bill is the spark plug of British rap, Lady Sovereign. Tonight at 8, PNC Bank Arts Center, Holmdel, N.J., (732) 203-2500, artscenter.com; sold out. Sunday at 8:30 p.m., Nikon at Jones Beach Theater, Wantagh, N.Y., (631) 888-9000, nikonjonesbeach.com; $29.50 to $79.50. (Sisario) ROD STEWART (Tomorrow) His four Great American Songbook albums may not represent the most distinguished readings of those songs -- ditto the Bob Seger and Creedence Clearwater Revival covers on his recent ''Still the Same Great Rock Classics of Our Time'' (J) -- but when Rod Stewart lets go of his smugness, that whiskey tenor of his can be a powerful interpretive instrument. Doesn't happen often, though. At 8 p.m., Nassau Coliseum, 1255 Hempstead Turnpike, Uniondale, N.Y., (516) 794-9303, nassaucoliseum.com; $52 to $125. (Sisario) Jazz Full reviews of recent jazz concerts: nytimes.com/music. RASHIED ALI QUINTET (Tuesday) Rashied Ali has had a substantial career in the jazz avant-garde, beginning with his role in the late-period bands of John Coltrane.

(Chinen) DARCY JAMES ARGUE'S SECRET SOCIETY (Tomorrow) Led by the composer and arranger Darcy James Argue, the Secret Society is a pointedly modernistic 18-piece big band stocked with top-shelf improvisers like the trumpeter Jonathan Finlayson. Kyle Saulnier's Awakening Orchestra, which plays an opening slot, takes a more mainstream approach but packs a similar punch.

(Chinen) DIZZY GILLESPIE ALL-STAR BIG BAND (Tuesday through Thursday) Bebop's goateed ambassador did some of his best work with big bands, a fact that this one, led by his former trombonist Slide Hampton, happily exploits. The band includes other veterans of Gillespie's employ, like the saxophonists James Moody and Jimmy Heath. The trumpeter Roy Hargrove is a fine choice to fill Gillespie's shoes. (Through May 27.) At 8 and 10:30 p.m., Blue Note, 131 West Third Street, West Village, (212) 475-8592, bluenote.net; cover, $35 at tables, $20 at the bar, with a $5 minimum. (Chinen) * BRUCE HORNSBY, CHRISTIAN MCBRIDE, JACK DEJOHNETTE (Wednesday) An unlikely but not unpromising summit of Mr. Hornsby, whose identity as a singer-songwriter often overshadows his lithe abilities as a pianist; Mr. McBride, a jazz bassist who has also worked prominently in pop; and Mr. DeJohnette, a drummer whose elastic propulsion creates its own stylistic world. They are preparing for the release of an album together, and raising funds for an arts education initiative called JazzReach. At 8 and 10:30 p.m., B. B. King Blues Club & Grill, 237 West 42nd Street, Manhattan, (212) 997-4144, bbkingblues.com; $50 in advance, $55 at the door, $100 V.I.P. package.

(Chinen) * WYNTON MARSALIS SEPTET (Thursday) Fifteen years ago Wynton Marsalis closed the Jazz at Lincoln Center concert season with ''In This House, on This Morning,'' an original commission thematically linked to the customs of the gospel church. Now Mr. Marsalis ends the current season by calling on some of the same musicians, including the trombonist Wycliffe Gordon and the drummer Herlin Riley, to reinterpret that evocative work. (Through May 26.) At 8 p.m., Frederick P. Rose Hall, Jazz at Lincoln Center, 60th Street and Broadway, (212) 721-6500, jalc.org; $37.50 to $127.50. (Chinen) FRANCISCO MELA QUINTET (Wednesday) Mr. Mela is a subtly dynamic drummer, attuned to the rhythmic depth of his native Cuba but adaptable to seemingly any sort of modern jazz. Revisiting material from ''Melao'' (Avya), his excellent debut album, he leads a group with Nir Felder on guitar, Sam Yahel on piano, Peter Slavov on bass and Joel Frahm on tenor saxophone. At 7:30 and 9:30 p.m., Jazz Standard, 116 East 27th Street, Manhattan, (212) 576-2232, jazzstandard.net; cover, $20. (Chinen) FRANK MORGAN QUARTET (Thursday) The alto saxophonist Frank Morgan is one of the last survivors of the original bebop era (and in his case ''survivor'' is truly the appropriate term). He leads a band with George Cables on piano, Curtis Lundy on bass and Billy Hart on drums. (Through May 27.) At 7:30 and 9:30 p.m., Jazz Standard, 116 East 27th Street, Manhattan, (212) 576-2232, jazzstandard.net; cover, $25.

(Chinen) ODE/AUDIBLE MEANS (Tonight) The bassist and composer Lisle Ellis serves as a bridge, or at least a point of overlap, between two adventurous ensembles: Ode, which includes the saxophonist Larry Ochs, the bassist Trevor Dunn and the drummer Gerry Hemingway; and Audible Means, with the saxophonist Ellery Eskelin, the guitarist Bruce Eisenbeil, the drummer Gustavo Aguilar and the keyboardist Erik Deutsch. At 8, the Stone, Avenue C and Second Street, East Village, thestonenyc.com; cover, $10. (Chinen) REUBEN ROGERS GROUP (Thursday) Reuben Rogers is a versatile bassist whose rousing debut album, ''The Things I Am'' (Renwick), reveals his lesser-known talents as a composer and arranger. He performs here with two of the album's participants, the saxophonist Ron Blake and the drummer Greg Hutchinson, along with the bright young pianist Danny Grissett. At 9 and 10:30 p.m., Jazz Gallery, 290 Hudson Street, South Village, (212) 242-1063, jazzgallery.org; cover, $12; $10 for members.

(Chinen) * HENRY THREADGILL'S ZOOID (Tonight through Sunday) The august composer and multireedist Henry Threadgill has always nursed a fascination with timbre. These days he indulges it best in this superb ensemble, which finds his flute and alto saxophone in a tangle with Liberty Ellman's acoustic guitar, Jose Davila's tuba and trombone, Dana Leong and Rubin Kodheli's cellos, and Elliot Humberto Kavee's drums. At 9 and 10:30, Jazz Gallery, 290 Hudson Street, at Spring Street, South Village, (212) 242-1063, jazzgallery.org; cover, $20; $10 for students. (Chinen) DAVID TORN (Tonight) Mr. Torn is a guitarist and producer whose new album, ''Prezens'' (ECM), suggests a texturally slippery approach to group improvisation. That has a lot to do with the saxophonist Tim Berne, the keyboardist Craig Taborn and the drummer Tom Rainey, who rejoin him here; but it's also an expression of his gift for organizing sound. At 9 and 10:30, Tea Lounge, 837 Union Street, near Seventh Avenue, Park Slope, Brooklyn, (718) 789-2762, tealoungeny.com; $5 donation. (Chinen) Classical Full reviews of recent music performances: nytimes.com/music. Opera 'CASTOR ET POLLUX' (Tomorrow) Yves Abel conducts a broad repertory in big houses these days, but he began his operatic conducting career as a specialist in French opera, an interest he explored by founding L'Opéra Français de New York. Mr. Abel's current offering is this Rameau opera of overlapping romantic triangles. At 8 p.m., French Institute/Alliance Française, 55 East 59th Street, Manhattan, (212) 355-6160, fiaf.org; $50; $40 for students and members. (Allan Kozinn) 'DON GIOVANNI' (Tonight and tomorrow night) The scrappy Chelsea Opera, founded three years ago, takes on this Mozart work, which, for all its familiarity, remains a formidable challenge. The production, staged by Lynne Hayden-Findlay and conducted by Carmine Aufiero, is double cast: Justin Ryan and Peter Hakjoon Kim alternate in the title role. Giving singers opportunities to perform is the mission of the company. Though a makeshift stage has to be set up in St. Peter's Church to present productions, there are benefits to experiencing opera in such an intimate space. At 7:30, 346 West 20th Street, Chelsea, (866) 811-4111, chelseaopera.org; $35 to $40 in advance, with $20 tickets for students and 65+; $45 and $50 at the door, and $25 for students and 65+. (Anthony Tommasini) 'ROMULUS' (Sunday and Monday) The Guggenheim's Works and Process series usually offers works in progress; this, however, is the world premiere, fully staged, of a new one-act comic opera by Louis Karchin. Based on a play by Dumas père with a ''Three Men and a Baby''-like plot (only two men in this case), the opera includes the fine baritone Thomas Meglioranza, known as a contemporary specialist, in its cast. Peter Flynn directs; Mr. Karchin will conduct. At 7:30 p.m., Guggenheim Museum, 1071 Fifth Avenue, at 89th Street, (212) 423-3587, worksandprocess.org; $15 to $24.

From 11 a.m. until midnight, 2537 Broadway, at 95th Street, (212) 864-5400, symphonyspace.org; free. (Midgette) Classical Music * BARGEMUSIC (Tonight through Sunday, and Wednesday) Barber's Piano Sonata is one of his most remarkable works, but it rarely finds its way onto the concert stage. Olga Vinokur is including it in her recital in this floating concert hall tonight, along with Haydn's Sonata in E flat (Hob. XVI:49) and transcriptions of Bach (by Busoni), Kreisler (by Rachmaninoff) and Schubert and Verdi (by Liszt). Tomorrow at noon, Ms. Vinokur is joined by the violinist Mark Peskanov in an all-Schubert recital, and in the evening (with a repeat on Sunday) the Knights Chamber Orchestra takes over for a rich program of Elgar, Arvo Pärt, Haydn and Vivaldi. Paul Schoenfield's inventive Clarinet Trio is the centerpiece of the Wednesday program, which also includes Bruch's ''Kol Nidre'' and works by Beethoven and Piazzolla. The performers are Nuno Antunes, clarinetist; David Marks, violinist; Adrian Daurov, cellist; and Katya Mihailova, pianist.

At 7:30 p.m., Joe's Pub, at the Public Theater, 425 Lafayette Street, at Astor Place, East Village, (212) 967-7555, joespub.com; $20.

(Schweitzer) MET ORCHESTRA (Sunday) This performance by James Levine's elegant orchestra was meant to be a showcase for the French soprano Natalie Dessay. Illness has laid her low, however, and the mezzo-soprano Michelle DeYoung will step in. There are some usual suspects on the program but also music by Ambroise Thomas. At 3 p.m., Carnegie Hall, (212) 247-7800, carnegiehall.org; $50 to $160.

(Holland) * URSULA OPPENS (Sunday) Arium, an inviting new cafe and concert site in the Meatpacking district of Manhattan, has been attracting some excellent pianists for a series of recitals. This Sunday afternoon the brilliant and adventurous Ursula Oppens offers a typically challenging, and very intriguing, program, with four pieces by the composer Tobias Picker (best known for his opera ''An American Tragedy'') and works by Beethoven, Schubert and Ravel. At 5 p.m., 31 Little West 12th Street, West Village, (212) 463-8630, ariumnyc.com; $50; $30 for members.

He performs a traditional virtuoso's program: Mozart, Beethoven, Tartini, Franck and Ravel. Susan Manoff is the accompanist. At 7:30, (212) 247-7800, carnegiehall.org; $28. (Midgette) * DANIEL BERNARD ROUMAIN (Wednesday) This composer melds classical forms and timbres with the sounds and structures of hip-hop, rock and other pop styles. With his band, the Mission, and DJ Spooky as a guest, Mr. Roumain will play works from his new recording, ''Etudes4Violin&Electronix'' (Thirsty Ear). At 7 p.m., the Cutting Room, 19 West 24th Street, Chelsea, (212) 691-1900, thecuttingroomnyc.com; $12 in advance, $15 at the door. (Kozinn) * SAN FRANCISCO SYMPHONY (Tonight) Michael Tilson Thomas and the players of the San Francisco Symphony have been winning accolades and awards for their bracing and insightful performances of the Mahler symphonies. For the second of two concerts with the symphony at Carnegie Hall, Mr. Thomas performs a group of Mahler songs with a distinguished Mahler interpreter, the baritone Thomas Hampson. The concert ends with Strauss's walloping ''Also Sprach Zarathustra.'' Mr. Thomas, a superb Copland conductor, opens the program with that composer's audacious and unabashedly modern ''Short Symphony,'' composed in the early 1930s. At 8, Carnegie Hall, (212) 247-7800, carnegiehall.org; $29 to $98. (Tommasini) JOHN SCOTT (Tomorrow) Mr. Scott, the organist and music director at St. Thomas Church, plays the second-to-last concert in his 10-part series exploring the organ works of Buxtehude, in honor of the 300th anniversary of that composer's death. Built in a style similar to that seen in northern Germany and the Netherlands in the 17th and 18th centuries, St. Thomas's Taylor & Boody organ is ideal for this venture. At 4 p.m., Fifth Avenue at 53rd Street, (212) 757-7013, saintthomaschurch.org; free. (Schweitzer) Dance Full reviews of recent performances: nytimes.com/dance.

(Tonight and Thursday night) The folks at BAAD! describe tonight's ''Hit the Dance Floor!'' as featuring ''sensual duos, moving Butoh and heart- stopping hip-hop that bubbles with the energy of the Bronx and the diversity of the city.''

(Dunning) Art Museums and galleries are in Manhattan unless otherwise noted. Full reviews of recent art shows: nytimes.com/art. Museums BROOKLYN MUSEUM: 'KINDRED SPIRITS: ASHER B. DURAND AND THE AMERICAN LANDSCAPE,' through July 29. This show of about 60 works by Durand has as its centerpiece ''Kindred Spirits'' (1849), a tribute to the landscapist Thomas Cole and his friend the poet and journalist William Cullen Bryant. A founder of the Hudson River School, Durand (1796-1886) favored the realistic approach to landscape. He explored forest interiors with close attention to the ways of trees, foliage and rocks and ground cover in smaller works, while his larger and more elaborate exhibition pictures, influenced by European masters, are Arcadian visions suffused with light, color and atmospheric perspective. 200 Eastern Parkway, at Prospect Park, Brooklyn, (718) 638-5000, brooklynmuseum.org. (Grace Glueck) GUGGENHEIM MUSEUM: 'DIVISIONISM/NEO-IMPRESSIONISM: ARCADIA AND ANARCHY,' through Aug. 6. Ultimately this rare, compressed, mercurial exhibition of work by the Italian Divisionists of the 1890s is long on history and short on truly convincing paintings. The inclusion of works by Seurat and his French, Dutch and Belgian followers clarifies how the Italians pushed Pointillism, Seurat's invention, in all directions: toward realism, academic classicism, Symbolism, class consciousness and even Impressionism. The show opens a new, albeit small, window on the genesis of Modernism beyond the French canon. If many of the works are period pieces, they are also immensely appealing, big-hearted and physically robust period pieces. Guggenheim Museum, 1071 Fifth Avenue, at 89th Street, (212) 423-3500. (Roberta Smith) * International Center of Photography: 'Let Your Motto Be Resistance: African American Portraits,' through Sept. 9. This show of photographic portraits is a praise-song in pictures, a shout-out to history. It's also a fancy-dress inaugural party for the yet-to-be-built National Museum of African American History and Culture in Washington. It tends to be a little too fancy, too heavy on glitz, too short on grit. Still, what a party it is, with a Who's Who of charismatic black statesmen, from Frederick Douglass to Malcolm X, and with Leontyne Price, Mahalia Jackson and the Supremes sharing a stage. 1133 Avenue of the Americas, at West 43rd Street, (212) 857-0000. (Holland Cotter) * JAPAN SOCIETY: 'Awakenings: Zen Figure Painting in Medieval Japan,' through June 17. Japan Society has a history of producing exquisite shows of Buddhist art. And this one, with four dozen paintings of Buddhists gods and saints hung in shrinelike alcoves, is transporting. It covers a broad swath of geography, bringing together 13th- to 16th-century hanging scrolls, not only from Japan but also from China, where Zen Buddhism, called Chan in Chinese, originated. 333 East 47th Street, (212) 832-1155, japansociety.org. (Cotter) * THE METropolitan museum of art: 'KING OF FASHION,' through Aug. 5. A revolutionary in revolutionary times, the fashion designer Paul Poiret introduced unstructured garments that freed women from corsets in 1906, the year before Picasso committed his decidedly uninhibited (and unstaid) ''Demoiselles d'Avignon'' to canvas. But the modern painter whom Poiret most resembles, in his love of the exotic, his brilliant use of color and pattern and his penchant for simplified, almost rudimentary form, is Matisse. This rare exhibition -- from the Met's Costume Institute -- does his sartorial genius justice with a spare installation rendered radiant by hand-painted silk backdrops of the leafy parks and luxurious drawing rooms of Paris. (212) 535-7710, metmuseum.org. (Smith) The Met: 'FRANK STELLA: PAINTING INTO ARCHITECTURE,' through July 29. Crammed into a gallery that feels like an obstacle course, this exhibition spans 43 years with 25 paintings, reliefs, drawings and architectural models, all with the goal of tracing an evolution that has not yet occurred. Taking up most of the space are enlarged versions of models that are considered sculptures -- and that look as if they date from the early 1960s. The main draws are the examples of the paintings and reliefs that are the basis of Mr. Stella's importance as an artist. (See above.) (Smith) The Met: 'FRANK STELLA ON THE ROOF,' through Oct. 28. Two large Pop Art sculptures, two architectural models and a model enlarged into a sculpture-installation piece confirm that one of the greatest American artists of the postwar era doesn't do himself or anyone else any favors when he strays from the wall to work fully in the round. The results have a certain Stella-like verve but are otherwise generic. (See above.) (Smith) MORGAN LIBRARY & MUSEUM: 'Apocalypse Then: Medieval Illuminations From the Morgan,' through June 17. The symbolism of the Book of Revelation, with its demons and lakes of fire, has a subversive appeal. This new exhibition at the Morgan Library celebrates a facsimile of ''Las Huelgas Apocalypse'' (1220), the largest surviving Spanish illuminated commentary on the Apocalypse. The show, which includes 50 leaves from the original text, unbound and installed around the gallery's perimeter, offers a walking tour of the medieval imagination. 225 Madison Avenue, at 36th Street, (212) 685-0008, morganlibrary.org. (Andrea K. Scott) Museum of modern art: 'COMIC ABSTRACTION: IMAGE-BREAKING, IMAGE-MAKING,' through June 11. This unimaginative and uniformed treatment of a big idea -- the healthy and essential contamination of Modernist abstraction by popular culture -- should be seen if only because it is such a dispiriting symptom of the Modern's paralysis where contemporary art is concerned. Including 30 works by 13 artists from the last 16 years, it alternates between the literal and the arbitrary and favors sincere political intent over genuine artistic quality. Although it promises work that addresses ''perplexing questions,'' nearly everything here is perfectly pleasant and innocuous. The exceptions are provided by Gary Simmons, Ellen Gallagher and Sue Williams. (212) 708-9400, moma.org. (212) 708-9400, moma.org. (Smith) * Neue Galerie: 'Van Gogh and Expressionism,' through July 2. The Neue has, as usual, gathered a stellar roundup of Expressionist art. In one of the show's most exciting rooms, a third-floor gallery devoted mostly to self-portraits, two extraordinary van Goghs hang at opposite ends: ''Self-Portrait With Straw Hat'' (1887-88), from the Metropolitan Museum's collection, filled with energetic, radiating brushstrokes, and the National Gallery's vibrant self-portrait of the artist holding a palette and brushes, painted about a year later. The most compelling pairing in this room, though, is van Gogh's ''Bedroom'' from 1889, the second of three versions he painted of his room in Arles, with Egon Schiele's obvious homage, ''The Artist's Bedroom in Neulengbach,'' painted in 1911, in a darker palette and with a perspective tipped precariously toward the viewer. 1048 Fifth Avenue, at 86th Street, (212) 628-6200, neuegalerie.org. (Martha Schwendener) The Studio Museum in Harlem: 'Philosophy of Time Travel,' through July 1. This flawed show, which was created by a group of artists who studied together at the California Institute of the Arts, is nonetheless an interesting example of one of the art world's latest trends: the art collective. It takes Brancusi's ''Endless Column'' as its point of departure and reimagines this Modernist icon from the point of view of art school grads, who are versed in the language of artspeak and wed to the righteous cause of freedom of expression. 144 West 125th Street, (212) 864-4500, studiomuseum.org. (Bridget L. Goodbody) WHITNEY MUSEUM AT ALTRIA: Matthew Brannon, 'Where Were We,' through Aug. 26. Matthew Brannon brings together art, poetry and advertising in a series of letterpress prints that hark back to 1950s and 1960s textile designs by Astrid Sampe and Marimekko. Texts written by the artist and accompanying the images read like song lyrics crossed with Conceptual Art and Language Poetry (which emphasized experimentalism and reader interaction). Consumption and excess are frequent references, as well as how art, design and fashion feed these modern yet primordial urges and desires. 120 Park Avenue, at 42nd Street, (917) 663-2453, whitney.org. (Schwendener) WHITNEY MUSEUM OF AMERICAN ART: 'LINCOLN KIRSTEIN,' through Aug. 27. In the middle of the last century Lincoln Kirstein particularly relished attacking the Museum of Modern Art. Pure abstraction was ridiculous, he thought. It had no standards. Against Mondrian and Pollock, he endorsed, among others, the artists in this show. They are the sculptors Elie Nadelman and Gaston Lachaise and the painters Paul Cadmus, who was Kirstein's brother-in-law, Walker Evans and Pavel Tchelitchew. With the exception of Evans, Kirstein's taste clearly hasn't won the day, but it's never bad to re-examine received opinions or to be reminded of a generous advocate. (See above.) (Michael Kimmelman) Whitney Museum of American Art: 'Taryn Simon,' through June 24. Ms. Simon couches the show in the intellectual, power-to-the-people oratory of leftist politics, yet she clearly delights in exposing, in a quasi-tabloid fashion, America's underbelly. Though she has also worked in war-torn areas, Ms. Simon is best known for ''The Innocents,'' a series of portraits of men and women who were wrongly convicted but later cleared by DNA test results. Ms. Simon can work as long as a year to gain permission to photograph high-security zones like the government-regulated quarantine sites, nuclear waste storage facilities, prison death rows and C.I.A. offices on view in the show. There are also pictures with lighter themes: the sandpit where the Grucci family tests fireworks, ski slopes being dynamited for avalanche control and the second Death Star, from ''Return of the Jedi,'' at George Lucas's Skywalker Ranch. Ms. Simon is at her artistic best when her delight in the strangeness of American culture shines. (See above.) (Goodbody) Galleries: Uptown CLAUDE MONET (1840-1926): A TRIBUTE TO DANIEL WILDENSTEIN AND KATIA GRANOFF This exhibition of nearly 60 paintings by one of the most beloved painters in the world feels a little like having dinner with a celebrity. The gallery setting eliminates the usual distance; the startling intimacy allows you to experience afresh the momentum and innovations of Monet's astounding trajectory in the span of three small galleries. Basically, it is a chance to encounter, up close and in detail, the evolving ways of seeing and painting that established the originality, historical importance and continuing irresistibility of Monet's art. It should not be missed. Wildenstein & Company, 19 East 64th Street, (212) 879-0500, through June 15. (Smith) Galleries: SoHo * 'Gego, Between Transparency and the Invisible' The artist named Gego was born Gertrud Goldschmidt in Germany in 1912, but lived most of her life in Venezuela, where she produced netlike drawings in ink and watercolor and what she called ''drawings without paper'': semi-geometric, see-through, two- and three-dimensional pieces of twisted and knotted wires, suspended in space. Whether you think of them as grids gone haywire or as rational forms charged with emotion, they're out of this world, and this small survey gives a good sense of what is distinctive and radical about Gego's art. The Drawing Center, 35 Wooster Street, SoHo, (212) 219-2166, drawingcenter.org, through July 21. (Cotter) Galleries: Chelsea * 'Rebel, Rebel: Remembering Karlheinz Weinberger (1921-2006)' The self-taught Swiss photographer Karlheinz Weinberger, who died last year at 81, began his career taking pictures for a gay club in Zurich, but found his true subject in rebellious, working-class teenagers who dressed to shock in the 1960s and '70s. The Weinberger pictures in this show are fairly tame, as if chosen to complement the cooled-out work of the three younger artists -- Ryan McGinley, Walter Pfeiffer and Collier Schorr -- who surround him. But at his best, he's in a class by himself. Anna Kustera, 520 West 21st Street, (212) 989-0082, kusteratiltongallery.com, through next Friday. (Cotter) Last Chance * THE MET: 'LOUIS COMFORT TIFFANY AND LAURELTON HALL -- AN ARTIST'S COUNTRY ESTATE' Laurelton Hall may have burned to the ground in 1957, but this exhibition does an excellent job of reassembling what remains of this extraordinary house-museum and its gardens, which Tiffany created for himself in the early 1900s. The Gilded Age opulence of the place, which occupied 580 acres overlooking Long Island Sound, is conveyed most blatantly by the Temple-of-Dendur-size Daffodil Terrace, in wood, marble and glass. The main events are the glass windows, vases and lamps, where Tiffany's genius for color, love of the exotic and reverence for nature coalesce into an unforgettable mystical materialism. (212) 535-7710, metmuseum.org; closes on Sunday. (Smith) P.S. 1 Contemporary Art Center: 'Katrin Sigurdardottir: High Plane V' Cut into a space between two levels of P.S. 1 is the Icelandic artist Katrin Sigurdardottir's ''High Plane V,'' a miniature artificial landscape of glacial mountains arranged in a naturalistic, faux-snow-covered setting against a painted white background. Visitors climb ladders and peer into one of two holes in the ceiling to view the work. The installation works best when two people mount the ladders and poke their heads in at the same time: then they can both see a disembodied head floating in the middle of the icy landscape. 22-25 Jackson Avenue, at 46th Street, Long Island City, Queens, (718) 784-2084, ps1.org.; closes on Monday. (Benjamin Genocchio) * JOHN ZURIER: PAINTINGS It may be a bit late in the game for sincere monochrome paintings, but this San Francisco artist, who made a wan impression at the 2002 Whitney Biennial and is now having his solo debut, often pulls it off. Mainly, he refuses to be programmatic. His colors range from black to bright. The proportions of his canvases are constantly shifting. And his brushwork is an active, varied ingredient, free of bombast. To some extent he reiterates the monochrome the way James McNeill Whistler foretold it, with a bit too much misty preciousness, perhaps, but with genuine feeling. Peter Blum, 99 Wooster Street, SoHo, (212) 343-0441, www.peterblumgallery.com/soho.html; closes tomorrow. (Smith)"

Carter, a spokesman for the development corporation, said the agency was pleased with the decision. George Locker, a lawyer for the tenants, said he would file his suit in the appellate court even though he believed the Supreme Court had jurisdiction. ALAN FEUER"
2007-05-18T00:00:00Z,"This retrospective devoted to the work of the tabloid reporter and crime novelist turned director should really be titled ''Sam Fuller!'' to reflect both his fondness for appending exclamation points to his titles (''Fixed Bayonets!,'' ''Verboten!'') and his filmmaking, which is so loaded with huge close-ups and percussive editing that Jean-Luc Godard once called it ''ciné-fist.'' This program at the Museum of the Moving Image in Queens features most of Fuller's major films in hard-to-find 35-millimeter archival prints. The selection for this weekend includes the 1951 ''Bayonets!,'' about a weak-willed officer (Richard Basehart) caught up in combat operations in Korea; ''Park Row'' (1952), his preposterously action-packed tribute to the early days of New York newspapering; and his two color and CinemaScope films for Fox: the cold-war submarine drama ''Hell and High Water'' (1954), with Richard Widmark as a former naval officer out to stop a Communist Chinese plot, and ''House of Bamboo'' (1955), starring Robert Ryan, as an Army veteran using his leadership skills to establish a crime ring in Tokyo, and Robert Stack (above, with Shirley Yamaguchi).

Mr. Pinchao, left, looking rawboned, said he shimmied off his chains, waded through rivers and endured dehydration, sunburn and insect bites before stumbling across a police patrol. He also offered news of three Americans held hostage by the guerrillas, the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia for four years -- Marc Gonsalves, Thomas Howes and Keith Stansell -- as well as of Ingrid Betancourt, kidnapped in 2002 while running for president. All are still alive, Mr. Pinchao said. SIMON ROMERO"

Directed by Matthew Levin Not rated; 99 minutes There may be a point to ''The Boy Who Cried Bitch: The Adolescent Years,'' a purportedly fact-based psychodrama about the teenage evolution of a future serial killer.

2007-05-18T00:00:00Z,"'KING KONG' ''Why, in a few months, it'll be up in lights on Broadway: 'Kong -- the Eighth Wonder of the World,' '' Carl Denham (Robert Armstrong) said in the 1933 film. King Kong did go on to make a Broadway debut in the movie, before he grabbed Ann Darrow (Fay Wray) and bolted to the top of the Empire State Building. Now the big lug, reincarnated yet again, is returning to the stage, in the East Village this time, when ''King Kong'' opens on Thursday at the Red Room Theater. Don't expect to see a sweaty actor in a furry suit: this ''King Kong'' is a production of Horse Trade and RadioTheater, the three-year-old company run by Dan Bianchi. Some of the company's earlier endeavors, like the pulp fiction takeoff ''Hard Boiled'' and another version of ''King Kong,'' strived to recreate the real atmosphere of a 1940s radio station and perhaps went too far. Mr. Bianchi, the group's founder and director, had set out to create something new, inspired by the golden age of radio, but the period costumes and entrances and exits of past productions made the shows too much like regular plays, he said. ''We were creating a museum piece. If you're going to go that far, where is the big King Kong?''"

2007-05-19T00:00:00Z,"One statistic seems to me to give the lie to all the rhetoric about abortion, and it's this: one in three women under the age of 45 have an abortion during their lifetime. One in three. All politicians -- Democrat and Republican -- say they want to make abortion at least rare (as Giuliani did in Wednesday's debate). On, this they could reach agreement. But it's clear they haven't been serious; the U.S. has 1.3 million abortions a year. Reducing unintended pregnancy is the key -- half of pregnancies are unintended, and 4 in 10 of them end in abortion. For a while now, we've had solid evidence about how to effectively do this. But it requires getting specific about two subjects that are perilous in politics: sex and contraception. That, politicians won't do. So let me try to help with four facts everyone needs to know."

Ms. Taylor, 75, bought the 1889 painting ''View of the Asylum and Chapel at Saint-Rémy'' at a London auction in 1963 for £92,000 (then about $257,000). South African and Canadian descendants of Margarete Mauthner, a Jewish woman who fled Germany in 1939, sued her in 2004, saying the work had been confiscated by the Nazis and should be returned to them under the Holocaust Victims Redress Act. A three-judge panel of the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals backed a lower court, ruling that the family had waited too long in claiming the painting, long known to be in Ms. Taylor's possession.

2007-05-19T00:00:00Z,"An article on Tuesday about a case before the Connecticut Supreme Court that questions whether civil unions for same-sex couples fulfill the state's constitutional obligation to treat individuals equally misidentified the legal standard that would be applied if the court found that gay men and lesbians were a ''suspect class,'' a status, like membership in a racial minority, that makes laws that categorize on that basis suspect. The standard is ''heightened scrutiny,'' which requires the state to prove that discrimination against gay men and lesbians is related to an important or compelling government interest; it is not ''rational basis,'' a more relaxed standard in which the state is required to show only that it had such a basis for making a distinction between single-sex and heterosexual couples."

Now, as he resides in the Mid-State Correctional Facility in Marcy, N.Y., about a four-hour drive from his former Fifth Avenue apartment in Manhattan, Tyco has agreed to pay almost $3 billion to investors who bought Tyco securities from 1999 to 2002. The investors also get the right to sue, on the company's behalf, its former auditors at PricewaterhouseCoopers. The claim would be accounting malpractice -- essentially an assertion that the auditors should have stopped the company and its management from committing fraud.

2007-05-19T00:00:00Z,"A dozen years ago, Rabbi Morris Allen stood before his congregation in this Twin Cities suburb to announce a program called Chew by Choice. As Conservative Jews, the members of his synagogue were bound by religious law to eat only kosher food, but as typical Americans, relatively few did so. So the rabbi asked them just to stop eating flagrantly impermissible foods like pork and shellfish as the first step toward fuller observance of the dietary strictures. The campaign at his synagogue, Beth Jacob Congregation, ultimately won Rabbi Allen an invitation to lecture at an Orthodox yeshiva in New York. Closer to home, he served alongside Orthodox rabbis on a kosher-certification panel for the Twin Cities area and collaborated with a local Hasidic rabbi in encouraging supermarkets to stock kosher meat after the last kosher butcher in St. Paul went out of business."

2007-05-20T00:00:00Z,"What may be the ultimate Hollywood movie about Hollywood, ''THE DAY OF THE LOCUST,'' was released 32 years ago by the director John Schlesinger from Nathanael West's satirical portrait of Tinseltown in the 1930s. The disjointed 144-minute epic manqué crawls with ''locusts'' -- demented, hangers-on and climbers living in the crumbling San Bernardino Arms, an apartment building whose architecture is described as ''early earthquake.'' One resident is the original Homer Simpson, a teetotaling Iowa hayseed played by Donald Sutherland with watery-eyed blankness. He is one of several men besotted with Faye Greener (Karen Black), a dizzy blond starlet-in-waiting who shares seedy quarters with her father, Harry (Burgess Meredith), a broken-down alcoholic magician and door-to-door peddler. Their neighbor, who also falls for Faye, is Tod Hackett (William Atherton), an ambitious, hard-drinking set designer. ''The Day of the Locust'' is the centerpiece of ''TWISTED SOULS: FOUR BY JOHN SCHLESINGER,'' a four-film tribute to this British director, who died four years ago at 77. The retrospective, presented by the Film Society of Lincoln Center, also includes his early ''Billy Liar'' (1963), ''Midnight Cowboy'' (1969) and ''Sunday Bloody Sunday'' (1971). Critically admired but seldom seen since its release, ''The Day of the Locust'' is a panoramic sideshow of grotesques clawing and clamoring for their piece of a tawdry dream. This mercilessly misanthropic swatch of gallows humor culminates in the blowing up of Hollywood at the glittering premiere of Cecil B. DeMille's 1938 adventure-romance, ''The Buccaneer,'' when a celebrity event escalates into a riot. Watching Hollywood self-destruct at the hands of its enraged citizenry is far more satisfying than any disaster movie could ever be. The rot comes from the inside.

2007-05-20T00:00:00Z,"The evolution of Noah Lowry continues. Lowry, below, by allowing two runs over eight innings last week, lowered his earned run average to 3.04, even though his record fell to 4-4 for the Giants. Last season, Lowry's strikeouts plummeted and he allowed home runs at a higher rate. While his walks are up, he has induced 69 percent more ground balls than fly balls. A 26-year-old left-hander, Lowry is still maturing. Justin Duchscherer is supposed to be the Oakland closer with Huston Street on the disabled list, and normally he would make a fine fill-in. But Duchscherer is battling an arthritic hip and received a cortisone shot last week after losing to Kansas City."

Noko's take on the art form -- it's protected by an artists guild -- is hand-stenciled patterns that echo traditional graphics but have a modern twist."

2007-05-20T00:00:00Z,"Is there about to be a price war among airlines flying the intensely competitive New York-London route? Zoom Airlines, which has been operating low-fare flights from Britain to Canada for three years, is starting service between London and New York on June 21. The company will offer daily flights between Gatwick and J.F.K., with 25 percent of the seats sold for as little as as $199 each way, plus taxes. Zoom is hoping its year-round one-way fares and increased flexibility (travelers do not have to stay over on a Saturday night) will give it an edge over other budget airlines that are expected to join the trans-Atlantic market following the recent ''open skies'' agreement."
2007-05-20T00:00:00Z,"I enjoyed the Freakonomics article by Stephen J. Dubner and Steven D.

I was never a habitual mulcher -- just a peony bed here and there -- until orthopedic issues and a balky well gave me good reason to start spreading it on thick around seven years ago. A tidy blanket of good, organic mulch keeps parched plants less stressed when I can't water. The stuff I use improves the soil, and it fends off the weeds that thrive mightily here.

Indeed, it's similar to the peak-period charges paid for electricity and telephone services or the increased charges levied by hotels in high season."
2007-05-20T00:00:00Z,"AN EXPENSIVE LEMON The News Nine years after Daimler-Benz spent $36 billion for Chrysler and invested billions more in the company, the German automaker sold Chrysler to a private equity firm for $7.4 billion. Behind the News The 1998 deal was portrayed as a marriage of equals but never resulted in the savings or market power that its creators expected. Chrysler's fortunes were up and down, with profitable years followed by years of losses, including a $1.5 billion loss last year. Now Cerberus Capital Management, which specializes in restructuring troubled companies, will try its luck. ''We obviously underestimated the potential of synergies,'' Daimler's chief executive, Dieter Zetsche, said. BRING YOUR WALLET The News Gasoline prices hit a new record at the pump this week, rising to a national average price of $3.129 a gallon. Behind the News With prices so high, it must mean -- you guessed it -- that the summer vacation season is just around the bend. Refinery outages and tight supplies have sent pump prices soaring by some 40 percent since January, and in some cities, the price is nearing $4. Wal-Mart says high gas prices have kept people from coming to its stores, but the auto group AAA said it expects 38 million Americans to travel at least 50 miles on the Memorial Day weekend. Perhaps they can fantasize that they're filling up at a European petrol station, where astronomic gas prices are the norm. FLUNKING INSPECTION The News Dale Earnhardt Jr., the son of a legend and the most popular driver in Nascar, was severely penalized by Nascar officials, along with his race team and crew chief. Behind the News Nascar officials said Earnhardt's car failed an inspection in what they viewed as a deliberate attempt to circumvent the rules. Inspectors said the rear wing was improperly mounted. Earnhardt was docked 100 points in the Chase for the Nextel Cup, knocking him from 12th to 14th place; his crew chief was fined $100,000 and suspended until after July 4. ''It is what it is,'' said the racing team's president, Max Siegel. ''It was a mistake, and it's unfortunate. But we'll move on.'' REGULATING EMISSIONS The News President Bush ordered government officials to draft regulations to reduce gas consumption and greenhouse gas emissions from new cars and trucks. Behind the News The order came a month after the Supreme Court, rebuffing the administration's arguments, found that carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases qualify as pollutants under the law and must be regulated if they endanger public health. Mr. Bush had opposed mandatory limits. It is not clear what the new rules will look like, and the process of writing and implementing them won't be completed until the end of 2008, just weeks before his term ends. Mr. Bush says he wants to reduce gas consumption by 20 percent over 10 years. SELF-PROPULSION The News The City of Light is preparing to make 20,000 bikes available for rent to ease traffic and reduce air pollution. Behind the News Paris may be for lovers, but a lot of them apparently drive cars. That has led to notoriously congested traffic and air pollution. So, borrowing an idea from the city of Lyons to the southeast, Paris is preparing to make the bikes available for rent at about 1,400 rental stations around the city, beginning in mid-July. For a few euros, riders can rent a bike, then drop it off at any rental station. In Lyon, with 2,000 bikes, there are up to 16,000 rentals a day. Each bike is used by as many as 15 people a day; the average trip is 1.7 miles, says Cyclocity, which runs the program."

The prognosis was good, and Ms. Russell repeatedly reassured Kate, but it scared the little girl more than the mother understood. ''We had trouble getting her to sleep,'' Ms. Russell said. ''She'd wake me up in the middle of the night to give me a picture.'' Kate was suddenly afraid of wolves. ''She was worried a wolf would come into the house and get us,'' Ms. Russell said. So the mother went to the library here and asked the children's librarian, Paula Lefkowitz, for a good book on wolves for a preschooler.

Mr. Rauch -- a leading figure of the so-called New Liepzig School of young artists reared in the smoke-choked industrial towns and grim housing projects of the former Eastern bloc -- creates haunting, unsettling evocations of muscular workers whose taut torsos and fixed gazes recall the saccharine images of Soviet Realism.

Tuesday through Sept. 23, the Metropolitan Museum of Art, metmuseum.org. A humorous mix of suburban appliances, frosted cakes, oversize flowers and sexual imagery, LINDER STERLING's collages at P.S. 1 Contemporary Art Center are a biting critique of consumer culture in the spirit of Hannah Hoch, but with a punk-rock twist.

Seen today, the works' feminist perspective and irreverent humor are a welcome throwback in a city being devoured by Donald Trumps, Paris Hiltons and Wall Street brokers.

Diegnan Jr., a South Plainfield Democrat, wants to change that. Mr. Diegnan took the first steps to nudge Rutgers into serving as a marketing arm of the state on Thursday by introducing a resolution into the Higher Education Committee that requests that the university add an ''NJ'' in the lower right corner of its athletic logo, a block ''R'' that is featured on the football helmets and at center court at basketball games."

2007-05-20T00:00:00Z,"Lampedusa: You won't run into P. Diddy or Donatella on Lampedusa. In fact, the only newsmakers on this rocky Italian island are the large marine turtles that deposit their eggs on its pristine white-sand beaches every summer and the African immigrants who arrive in makeshift boats seeking asylum. Known as ''the door of Europe,'' the seven-mile-long outcropping is just 70 miles off the coast of Tunisia -- and the African influence is felt in everything from the food (fish couscous is the local specialty) to the vegetation (date palms on beautifully barren stretches). The 5,000-strong population is made up mostly of fishermen, but it can swell to about 20,000 in the summer, when Lampedusa becomes a haven for those seeking scenery rather than scenes."

''As long as the shareholder is simultaneously living in the apartment, there is no reason the cousin's daughter can't reside there,'' said Theresa Racht, a Manhattan co-op and condominium lawyer. Ms. Racht said that it is well established that the ''roommate law'' applies to co-ops.

2007-05-20T00:00:00Z,"Among former Gov. George Pataki's pet projects were the parks in and along the state's waterways, especially the Hudson River Park in Manhattan and historic Governors Island in New York Harbor. For reasons that are not entirely clear -- envy, perhaps, or lack of interest -- Gov. Eliot Spitzer has shown nowhere near the same enthusiasm, despite the environmental credentials he earned as Attorney General. The net result is that the momentum behind the partly completed Hudson River Park has slowed while the Governors Island project remains stuck in neutral."

2007-05-20T00:00:00Z,"The Spanish Gitano guitarist NIÑO JOSELE comes from the world of new flamenco, a genre obsessed with mixtures and fusions -- much like jazz. Mr. Josele (born Juan José Heredia), 33, has worked with Diego el Cigala and Enrique Morente, two of the greatest flamenco singers alive, and he is a searching, absorbent musician. It was only a few years ago that he came across Bill Evans, and he was bewitched, specifically by Evans's harmonies. In ''Paz'' (Calle 54/Sony BMG), his new album of works associated with Evans, he retains elements of flamenco rhythm and phrasing, especially in his introductions to songs like ''Peace Piece,'' ''Waltz for Debby'' and ''Turn Out the Stars,'' but then he moves into jazz territory. His gig this week at the Village Vanguard is special, not just for the Vanguard, which rarely books a bandleader from outside of the jazz tradition, but also for Mr. Josele. He will play the Evans pieces accompanied by two extraordinary rhythm musicians, the bassist Esperanza Spalding and the Cuban drummer Horacio (El Negro) Hernandez. Tuesday through Sunday, 9 and 11 p.m., 178 Seventh Avenue South, at 11th Street, West Village, (212) 255-4037, villagevanguard.com; $30 cover Tuesday through Thursday, $35 cover Friday through Sunday. EVAN CHRISTOPHER, a clarinetist, is a great counterargument for anyone who thinks jazz should let go of its past. Sidney Bechet is one of his prime fascinations, but Mr. Christopher has played all kinds of jazz. He has a kind of primal ability to energize a bandstand, and this week, in a concert presented by the Sidney Bechet Society, he'll perform with some of the musicians he's been playing with in Paris recently, along with the New York trumpeter Jon-Erik Kellso as a guest.

We gave up our careers, sold our possessions and just started out on our bikes.

At the finish, Robby Albarado and Curlin, left, edged out the Kentucky Derby winners Calvin Borel and Street Sense. Hard Spun, along the rail, was a distant third. EARLY LEADERS Xchanger Ramon Dominguez 23-1 Flying First Class Mark Guidry 16-1 Hard Spun Mario Pino 4-1 Curlin stumbles leaving the gate and is unable to get near the early leaders. The long shot Xchanger is ridden aggressively to take the lead and Flying First Class goes after him. Street Sense settles into his customary position near the back of the field. BACKSTRETCH LEADERS Hard Spun Mario Pino 4-1 Xchanger Ramon Dominguez 23-1 Flying First Class Mark Guidry 16-1 The fast early pace is already taking its toll on Xchanger and Flying First Class. Hard Spun, who had been sitting in third, makes an early attack and sweeps past the frontrunners to take the lead. He is traveling easily and pulls ahead by two lengths. Albarado is still waiting to make his move with Curlin. FINAL TURN LEADERS Hard Spun Mario Pino 4-1 C P West Edgar Prado 25-1 Curlin Robby Albarado 3-1 After shaking off a mild bid from C P West, Hard Spun still leads, but Curlin and Street Sense are closing in on him fast. After being angled off the rail for more room, Street Sense gets past Hard Spun and Curlin and appears on his way to winning the second leg of the Triple Crown. AT THE WIRE LEADERS Curlin Robby Albarado 3-1 Street Sense Calvin Borel 6-5 Hard Spun Mario Pino 4-1 Curlin has fought back and is coming after Street Sense, who had a 11/2-length lead a furlong from the wire. Curlin keeps inching forward, but Street Sense also fights on. The two are on even terms for a few strides approaching the wire before Curlin just gets past his rival as the two cross the finish line."

2007-05-20T00:00:00Z,"GERI RUSSELL's daughter Kate was almost 4 when the mother first became ill. The prognosis was good, and Ms. Russell repeatedly reassured Kate, but it scared the little girl more than the mother understood. ''We had trouble getting her to sleep,'' Ms. Russell said. ''She'd wake me up in the middle of the night to give me a picture.'' Kate was suddenly afraid of wolves. ''She was worried a wolf would come into the house and get us,'' Ms. Russell said. So the mother went to the library here and asked the children's librarian, Paula Lefkowitz, for a good book on wolves for a preschooler. ''We talked about how the wolves lived far, far away in the West, way out there, far away,'' Ms. Russell said. ''I said, 'Everybody knows there's no wolves in Parsippany.' ''"

I was hired as an extra for $5, one of a bunch of children playing with a jump rope in the street. We all scattered when the bad guy dropped from the fire escape of the murdered blonde's apartment. Mark Hellinger, the producer, was a perfectionist. We kids were surprised when the crew tracked us down for reshoots. (We were thrilled to get another $5.) A lamppost was moved about 10 feet, the scene was filmed again, and that is what appears in the movie."

A morally sketchy politician, a Japanese comic book geek, a watchmaker turned serial killer, cannibalism, filicide -- with these characters and themes, NBC has created its own compelling answer to long-form, apocalyptically themed television, as well as a hit set to return next season. It has arrived: prestige reality television. Steven Spielberg serves as co-producer of ''ON THE LOT,'' making its debut Tuesday night at 9 on Fox. This series pits aspiring filmmakers against one another in a contest to win a development deal from DreamWorks worth less than the price of many Manhattan apartments: $1 million. Among those making the call are Carrie Fisher and Garry Marshall. Twelve thousand not-yet-Spielbergs tried for spots in the race. Does reality television contribute to insomnia? Do tense shows like ''Heroes,'' ''Lost'' and ''24'' leave us too stressed out to sleep? The director Alan Berliner doesn't tackle this question specifically but does consider the relationship between the anxieties of modern life and the troubles Americans have sleeping in his documentary ''WIDE AWAKE'' (HBO, Wednesday night at 8). Mr. Berliner, an insomniac, chronicles his own struggle with the night and imagines how sleep deprivation might affect politics and the World Series."

She attended Indiana State University and Columbia University. Her professional life in New York began at Ziff-Davis Publishing and went on to include Fred/Alan Advertising, Nickelodeon, WILL-TV/PBS Corp. at the University of Illinois, Sesame Street Workshop, and 4 Kids Productions. A multiple Emmy-Award recipient, she was most recently associate producer of the television documentary ''Ten Sisters''. Known to her family as Suzy, Carol is survived by her husband Raymond L.

2007-05-20T00:00:00Z,"FINISHING my lunch at an open-air restaurant in downtown Bangkok, I felt slightly queasy. But by the time the taxi arrived back at my hotel, sweat was pouring out of my armpits, the folds of my stomach, even my shins, and my leg joints buckled as if a diamond-tipped drill was boring into them. As I got out of the taxi, I collapsed onto the street. The taxi driver shoved me back into his cab, and we wove our way through the city's infamous traffic to Bumrungrad International, a hospital near my hotel. I barely made it to the emergency room before I passed out. When I woke and remembered what had happened, part of me wanted to bolt from my E.R. bed. I knew very little about Thai medical facilities, and recalled a clinic I'd seen in neighboring Myanmar, where patients had to bring their own linens, needles and even bandages to the hospital."
2007-05-20T00:00:00Z,"In Europe the same orchestra often appears in the opera pit one night and on the symphony stage the next. Each experience adds a dimension to an orchestra's playing: the world of theater and dramatic expression from one, the spotlight of virtuosic playing from the other. JAMES LEVINE has sought to bring such diversity to the two institutions he serves as music director, striving to program more concert performances of operas with the Boston Symphony Orchestra and building the METROPOLITAN OPERA ORCHESTRA over the years into a shining solo instrument. On Sunday the Met Orchestra has its final symphony concert of the season. The mezzo-soprano Michelle DeYoung will appear as soloist, but then the Met players, unaccompanied, take on Ravel's ''Daphnis et Chloé'' Suite No. 2. 3 p.m. Carnegie Hall, (212) 247-7800, carnegiehall.org; $50 to $160. This week brings two case studies in the transmission of musical knowledge, along with a healthy batch of string quartets. After a week of intensive coaching by the Juilliard String Quartet at a JUILLIARD SCHOOL workshop, seven hatchling quartets will present the fruits of their labor at a pair of concerts. Tuesday at 3:30 and 7:30 p.m., Paul Hall, 60 Lincoln Center Plaza, at 65th Street, (212) 769-7406, juilliard.edu; free. Three other young quartets will culminate a similar exercise with the EMERSON STRING QUARTET, which will have coached them under the auspices of Carnegie Hall's training program. They will play Beethoven quartets. Wednesday and Thursday at 7:30 p.m., Weill Recital Hall; $15. The NEW YORK PHILHARMONIC, just back from a European tour, will presumably have recovered enough from jet lag to perform this week's eclectic program: Rimsky-Korsakov's ''Russian Easter'' Overture, Saint-Saëns's Violin Concerto No. 3 and Bartok's Concerto for Orchestra. Saint-Saëns wrote the concerto for the virtuoso Pablo de Sarasate, and the soloist will be the Lithuanian Julian Rachlin. The Bartok, a showcase of solo playing, is an ideal vehicle for this orchestra, which prides itself on individual virtuosity.

Brilliant Emmy-award winning photographer, astounding pilot, charming, talented wit, gifted teacher, wonderful musician, and rare friend. We know you are flying on the ''Wings of Man'' wherever you go. You are ever near and yet so far. Jordan & Tom Saunders Calvert & George Moore $(6$)FULTON--Robert Edison, was one of the most interesting men I have ever known. He was a philosopher, musician, poet, director, cinematographer, aerial cinematographer, filmmaker, and most of all, an incredible man. Bob was highly skilled in all these areas. He won many awards including an Emmy for his work. He was a devout Buddhist. Bob was extremely humble and never talked about himself or his accomplishments, but only about the love of his work. Bob did everything in such a unique way that his friends and family referred to his lifestyle as Fultonian, as if he had developed an entirely different culture and way of life. To tell one story about Bob was never enough; people always wanted to hear more and know more about this fascinating man. To watch Bob fly a plane was like watching a virtuoso playing an instrument. He taught me many things both in the sky and on the ground. His lessons of ''point of intended touchdown'' is something I will never forget. A wonder with words, Fulton never used profanity; he thought it was an abuse of the English language and demonstrated a lack of a proper vocabulary. I miss my generous mentor and good friend, Bob Fulton, who is in my thoughts everyday. Taz Saunders"

Homeowners whose grandparents beat rugs and washed windows worry about more than dirt. So what if the baseboards are dusty? The lead in the paint could be lowering your toddler's future SAT scores.

2007-05-20T00:00:00Z,"The great attention-sucking machine of the Broadway season shuts down in early May, which is why some Off Broadway theaters wait until then to offer their shiniest wares. Last year at the Atlantic it was ''Spring Awakening''; this year that theater is staging another new musical: ''10 MILLION MILES,'' with a book by KEITH BUNIN (''The Busy World Is Hushed'') and songs by the recording artist PATTY GRIFFIN. Though some recent attempts to tell theatrical stories with pre-existing pop music have proved dismal (''The Times They Are A-Changin','' ''All Shook Up,'' ''Lennon''), the director MICHAEL MAYER brings to ''10 Million Miles'' the experience of having smoothed over that divide in ''Spring Awakening.'' And Ms. Griffin's folk-ballad style actually makes sense with the story of wounded redneck lovers (MATTHEW MORRISON and MARE WINNINGHAM) on a road trip. In previews, opens June 14, Atlantic Theater Company, 336 West 20th Street, Chelsea, (212) 279-4200, ticketcentral.com; $65. Meanwhile, over at MCC Theater, it's time for the annual NEIL LaBUTE id-fest. This year's installment: ''IN A DARK DARK HOUSE,'' starring FREDERICK WELLER and RON LIVINGSTON as brothers with a secret. At 44 Mr. LaBute is something of a theatrical Joyce Carol Oates, churning out the goods at a seemingly unhealthy rate. Certainly it had become a bit tiresome to watch each new play wear out its initial welcome as the trick (incest, Sept. 11, a hidden tape recorder) clicked into place partway through. But starting with ''Some Girl(s),'' produced by MCC in 2004, Mr. LaBute seemed to be digging deeper, treating his characters with more affection and (until a dissatisfying ending) letting them shape the story. The question about ''In a Dark Dark House'' is: Which LaBute will we get? In previews, opens June 7, Lucille Lortel Theater, 121 Christopher Street, West Village, (212) 279-4200, ticketcentral.com; $70."

Founder Wellfleet Pottery Trevor Glucksman, 82, husband of Kathleen, father of sons Maurice, Daniel and Tobias, and grandfather of four, passed away on May 15 after a long illness. Trevor is also survived by sister Lorraine and brother Myron. In 1970, Trevor and Kathleen founded Wellfleet Pottery, their artistic collaboration and livelihood, where they produced Wellfleet Pottery Umber China, now a collectable. Trevor was born and raised in Vancouver, Canada. He studied philosophy and architecture at the University of British Columbia and University of Manitoba. In the 1950s, Trevor and Kathleen helped found Israel's nascent ceramic industry. They subsequently lived in London, England where Trevor undertook doctoral work in philosophy of art and architecture at the University of London, which he later continued at Harvard University, and Kathleen studied at the London School of Drawing and Painting. During the early 1960s, Trevor and his family lived in New York, where he worked as a creative writer in advertising on Madison Avenue, and first began to develop designs for Wellfleet Pottery. During that time, he also received an award for his work on a documentary about the aviators the Wright Brothers. Although Trevor increasingly suffered from a debilitating motor disease, he continued to draw and write short stories until his final weeks.

2007-05-20T00:00:00Z,"''Simplify, simplify,'' Thoreau once wrote. But is it possible to be green without retreating to a cabin in the woods? This issue looks at the ecology of architecture in the age of shrinking forests, urban sprawl and rising anxiety about global warming: A city in Brazil that made recycling a civic religion. An architect in Australia who looked to the land and its early settlers. An entrepreneur with a plan for every house to generate its own power. A Japanese architect who saw the possibilities in paper. An imaginary future home both luxurious and green. And a new generation of European architects who may show us what to do next."

Racial divisions are considered biological, although they are, in effect, largely socially constructed. Ethnic divisions have no such connotations in contemporary American society."

Rooms in hotels like the Palazzo Baldi in Galatina, which was carved out of a grouping of 16th-century palazzos, and the Villa Ducale -- a musty but charming 1950s-looking structure on the Piazzetta Sant' Antonio, just steps from the town of Martina Franca -- can be had for under 65 euros a night."

(Economic View, May 13), in which economists were asked to choose reasons for the expansion of the United States economy since mid-2003: A better question might be whether tax cuts limited growth, rather than bolstering it. The cuts' bias toward wealthier taxpayers placed more money in the pockets of people whose less frequent transactions reduced money's velocity, the speed with which it moves from one economy-spurring transaction to the next."

But a nascent style scene is now taking root in the capital, stoked by the city's pervasive youth culture and a fashion program at the Iceland Academy of the Arts. A clutch of trailblazing downtown shops present an idiosyncratic blend of design, art and clothes -- and provide a welcome new daytime diversion in a city that doesn't really come alive until after dark.

2007-05-20T00:00:00Z,"The closest thing to a tourist attraction in the Paris neighborhood of Belleville is a small plaque commemorating the birth of Ãdith Piaf, posted on a drab apartment building on a busy street. ''On the steps of this house,'' the inscription reads, ''was born on 19 December 1915, in the greatest destitution, Ãdith Piaf, whose voice would later turn the world upside down.'' The story isn't quite true -- in fact, Piaf was born in a nearby hospital -- but it's a charming myth that evokes both Piaf's legendary rise from street urchin to international stardom and the hard-boiled mystique of her childhood quartier."

2007-05-20T00:00:00Z,"THE surest way to scatter my family is to mention, oh so casually, that the mulch delivery is imminent. For the last few years, since our teenage son got buff enough to wield the oversize shovel used to spread the small mountain delivered every spring, he and his dad have approached the task with the verve and good cheer of chain gang conscripts. I was never a habitual mulcher -- just a peony bed here and there -- until orthopedic issues and a balky well gave me good reason to start spreading it on thick around seven years ago. A tidy blanket of good, organic mulch keeps parched plants less stressed when I can't water. The stuff I use improves the soil, and it fends off the weeds that thrive mightily here. Keeping after those noxious invaders without mitigating mulch would surely have undone eight weeks of physical therapy for a bum neck."

2007-05-20T00:00:00Z,"To the Editor: ''End-of-Life Logjam'' (editorial, May 13) correctly labels as absurd the political stalemate that has left most of New York's population without critical decision-making powers in end-of-life situations. For years, to end this deplorable situation, the New York State Bar Association has been strongly advocating for a Family Health Care Decisions Act. More than 75 percent of New Yorkers do not have a health care proxy designating a trusted family member or friend to make their medical decisions if they become too sick to make such decisions for themselves.

2007-05-20T00:00:00Z,"To the Editor: Regarding the constructive approach the mayor of Hightstown is taking to ''revitalize'' the town with illegal immigrant workers (''Cooler Heads in Hightstown,'' editorial, May 13), the impact is far ranging. Is this ''thriving middle American village'' of Hightstown thriving for our poorer American-born citizens? Or are our less fortunate citizens further trapped into not receiving a living wage because illegals will work for rock bottom (tax-free?) wages? Our regional school system is overburdened and English-speaking students aren't receiving the education they should. Schools in more affluent towns are not affected by their illegal immigrant workers because there is no low-cost housing and the illegals leave at the end of the day. This is yet another way that the American middle class is being hurt. Where is our local financial support and guidance from the federal government? Our taxpayers are overburdened."

2007-05-21T00:00:00Z,"There is perhaps no one who understands the chaos of Cannes better than Pierre Rissient, a man whose career in cinema is nearly impossible to summarize. He has been a critic, a distributor, a publicist, a producer, a filmmaker and an all-purpose ambassador for American, Asian and many other films. He is also the subject of a documentary, ''Pierre Rissient, Man of Cinema,'' that drew an affectionate and distinguished crowd at a special screening at the Salle Buñuel on Saturday afternoon. Both the festival's current director, Thierry Frémaux, and his predecessor, Gilles Jacob, were on hand to pay tribute to Mr. Rissient. In his honor the dapper Mr. Frémaux wore a baseball cap, one of the signatures of Mr. Rissient's easygoing sartorial style. (Legend has it that he is the only man admitted to black-tie screenings in a T-shirt.) Directed by Todd McCarthy, chief film critic at Variety, ''Man of Cinema'' is both a loving portrait -- with testimonials from filmmakers, critics and various Cannes eminences -- and a valuable history lesson. Many of the people at the screening knew Mr. Rissient; nearly everyone who has been to Cannes has been aided by his advice, amused by his gossip or provoked by his strongly held, sharply argued opinions. But few of us knew just how instrumental he had been in shaping the world of film as we know it: by shepherding movies and their directors to Cannes, and also by shaping the terms of their critical and public appreciation. A bit of his wisdom has been printed on a T-shirt that should become an unofficial Cannes uniform: ''It is not enough to like a film. You must like it for the right reasons.'' A. O. SCOTT"

2007-05-21T00:00:00Z,"''Terror's Advocate,'' Barbet Schroeder's jaw-dropping new film, traces a tangled history of political militancy from the Algerian war in the 1950s through the Cambodian genocide of the 1970s up to the brink of our own time. There is plenty of violence and intrigue, but it seems likely that had Mr. Schroeder pitched the project to a Hollywood studio, the story would have been dismissed as crazily implausible. In any case it works brilliantly as a documentary, with a narrative that is all the more amazing for being true. The subject of ''Terror's Advocate'' is Jacques Vergès, notorious in France as a public gadfly and a lawyer with a client list that includes the Nazi war criminal Klaus Barbie and the international terrorist known as Carlos the Jackal. A polite way to describe Mr. Vergès -- the description he himself might offer -- would be as a bold advocate for unpopular causes. But through wide-ranging interviews (including phone conversations with Carlos himself) and some impressive sleuthing, ''Terror's Advocate'' paints a more complicated and ultimately far more damning portrait."

2007-05-21T00:00:00Z,"'Shrek' Reigns Shrek got even greener over the weekend. Including Thursday previews, ''Shrek the Third'' (distributed by Paramount) grossed an estimated $122.9 million at 4,122 North American theaters in its debut, the tracking company Media by Numbers reported yesterday. Surpassing the $108 million opening of ''Shrek 2,'' the new film set a record for the most lucrative opening by an animated film and was the third-best debut ever, behind $151.1 million for ''Spider-Man 3'' and $135.6 million last year for ''Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Man's Chest.'' The weekend's ''Shrek'' performance ended the two-week reign of ''Spider-Man 3'' (Sony) at the top of the rankings. The web-slinger sequel took in $28.5 million at 4,324 theaters, bringing its three-weekend total to $281.8 million. Third place and $5.1 million went to yet another sequel, ''28 Weeks Later'' (Fox Atomic), in its second week. ''Disturbia'' (Paramount) attracted $3.6 million in its sixth week, and ''Georgia Rule'' (Universal) rounded out the top five with $3.4 million in its second week. Drama Desk Awards Honor 'Coast' Trilogy ''The Coast of Utopia,'' the Tom Stoppard trilogy about 19th-century Russia, won seven honors, including the accolade for outstanding drama, at the 2006-7 Drama Desk Awards last night at La Guardia Concert Hall at Lincoln Center. The Duncan Sheik and Steve Sater rock musical ''Spring Awakening,'' adapted from an 1891 Frank Wedekind play, won four awards, including outstanding musical. The Stephen Sondheim and George Furth musical ''Company'' was named outstanding revival of a musical, one of its three prizes, and R. C. Sherriff's 1929 play ''Journey's End,'' set in the trenches of World War I, was named outstanding revival of a play, one of its three honors. Frank Langella of ''Frost/Nixon'' and Eve Best of ''A Moon for the Misbegotten'' were named best actor and actress in a play. Audra McDonald of ''110 in the Shade'' and Donna Murphy of ''LoveMusik'' tied for outstanding actress in a musical. Raúl Esparza of ''Company'' was named outstanding actor in a musical. Honors for directing went to Jack O'Brien of ''The Coast of Utopia'' and Michael Mayer of ''Spring Awakening.'' The award for outstanding solo performance went to Vanessa Redgrave for ''The Year of Magical Thinking.'' Lennon Festival In Scottish Highlands A remote village in the Scottish Highlands where John Lennon spent his childhood vacations plans to honor him with a major festival this fall, the newspaper The Scotsman reported. From Sept. 28 to 30, the village, Durness (population 350), will mount the John Lennon Northern Lights Festival, featuring music, art, dance and film. Among those scheduled to participate are Peter Maxwell Davies, the master of the queen's music, performing the world premiere of a Beatles program with the Royal Academy of Music. From ages 9 to 14, Lennon spent his summer vacations at Durness and returned there in 1969 with Yoko Ono and their family. The place is said to have inspired his song ''In My Life.'' Stanley Parkes, a cousin who shared Lennon's childhood summers in Durness and will reminisce about him at the festival, said, ''This is not about exploiting his fame; it is about celebrating his inspiration, and that is why so many leading artists and John's family have supported the event.'' Exile for George Michael? The singer George Michael, below, confessing a dependency on prescription drugs and extolling the virtues of marijuana, said he was considering exiling himself from England to avoid the scrutiny of the news media. In a television interview broadcast on Saturday, Reuters reported, he said, ''I have started thinking for the first time in my life that actually I shouldn't be here.'' Mr. Michael told the ITV talk-show host Michael Parkinson, ''I have got to think seriously about whether or not my love for my country is keeping me somewhere which is not good for me, you know.'' His agent said he had homes in London and Dallas. This month, describing himself as ''very ashamed,'' he pleaded guilty to driving while unfit and blamed his behavior on fatigue and prescription medicine. ''Yes,'' he told Mr. Parkinson, ''it involves prescribed drugs, and it involves a dependency on them.'' He attributed his behavior to the loss of his mother, Lesley, in 1997, saying, ''I know I have a very self-destructive tendency since my mother died; I have got to be honest.'' As for marijuana, he said, ''nobody ever came home stoned and beat up their wife.'' Fats Domino Back in Action Fats Domino, above, 79, who lost his home, pianos and gold and platinum records when Hurricane Katrina struck, gave his first public performance since then before a crowd of hundreds in a sold-out New Orleans nightclub on Saturday night, The Associated Press reported. Accompanied by his longtime friend and musical partner, the saxophonist Herbert Hardesty, Mr. Domino set the crowd to jumping and screaming when he belted out ''Blueberry Hill.'' The program also included ''Blue Monday,'' ''Ain't That a Shame'' and ''Walking to New Orleans.'' Mr. Domino, a member of the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame, is expected to move back into his home in the devastated Ninth Ward later this year. Scotty's Ashes Found The suspense is over. After a three-week search, the ashes of James Doohan, who portrayed the starship Enterprise's chief engineer, Montgomery Scott, in the original ''Star Trek'' television series, have been found, the Associated Press reported. Blasted to the edge of space aboard a rocket from New Mexico on April 29, two years after Mr. Doohan's death at 85, the capsule carrying his ashes became lost in rugged terrain on its return to Earth, and the search was impeded by foul weather. The payload landed in rocky, steep terrain in the San Andres Mountains on the White Sands Missile Range in New Mexico."

2007-05-21T00:00:00Z,"Among the highlights of this year's festival is ''The Flight of the Red Balloon,'' the latest from the Taiwanese master Hou Hsiao-hsien, making his eighth appearance at Cannes. On paper Mr. Hou's film sounds unfortunate at best: a tribute, set in Paris and starring Juliette Binoche, to Albert Lamorisse's enchanting ''Red Balloon,'' which won the Palme for shorts in 1956 and has since inspired generations of children to look toward the sky. Mr. Hou's ''Red Balloon,'' which is playing out of the main competition in a section called Un Certain Regard, was a late addition to Cannes, having been officially brought onboard last month. It's rumored that the festival rejected several earlier cuts, which just goes to show that practice makes nearly perfect. Ms. Binoche plays Suzanne, an overwhelmed single mother who, in her struggle to keep it together, hires a young Taiwanese film student, Song (Song Fang), to care for her 7-year-old son, Simon (Simon Iteanu). Through a series of quiet, seemingly offhand yet exquisitely conceived interludes, Mr. Hou introduces us to three fully inhabited people who embody the careless joys of childhood, the hopes of young adulthood and the burdens of older age. Mr. Hou arranges these bodies with his usual tender touch; his mastery of film space remains assured as ever, even many miles from home, as does his work with actors. His direction of Ms. Binoche is particularly notable because he doesn't allow her to work her wiles with beauty or dribbling tears, as is too often her wont."

2007-05-21T00:00:00Z,"Three years after conquering the Cannes Film Festival and winning the Palme d'Or for ''Fahrenheit 9/11,'' Michael Moore has returned the amour big time with ''Sicko,'' his most fluid provocation to date. A persuasive, insistently leftist indictment of the American health care system, as well as a funny valentine to all things French -- and many things Canadian, British and Cuban -- the film shows that while Mr. Moore remains a radical partisan, he has learned how to sell his argument with a softer touch. He's still the P. T. Barnum of activist cinema, but he no longer runs the entire circus directly from the spotlight. To that shrewd end almost an entire hour has lapsed before Mr. Moore lumbers in front of the camera in ''Sicko,'' his aw-shucks grin and baseball cap firmly in place. By that point he has introduced a wealth of evidence (photographs, news clips and archival footage) and a sprawling cast of characters (patients, health care workers and Washington politicians), each another piece in the evolving puzzle. How did we get here and why?, Mr. Moore asks in his faux-folksy, at times icky-sticky voice-over. Though of course there's never any doubt that this director of ''Bowling for Columbine,'' a blistering attack on American gun culture, believes he knows who is to blame for the state of the nation's health care and why."

2007-05-21T00:00:00Z,"''A journalist just reminded me that we've been here in competition seven times,'' said Joel Coen, sitting beside his brother, Ethan, in a beachside restaurant. The brothers, back in Cannes this year (their ninth visit overall) with ''No Country for Old Men,'' a brutal and meticulous adaptation of Cormac McCarthy's novel, have had an enviable track record with the local juries. Six prizes in six tries, most recently a jury award in 2004 for ''The Ladykillers'' and a directing award in 2001 for ''The Man Who Wasn't There,'' to go with those given ''Fargo'' and ''Barton Fink,'' which also won an acting award. Oh yes, and the Palme d'Or. Anyone involved in a Cannes office pool may want to take note of these data, but whatever its fate on closing night, ''No Country for Old Men'' has been well received by critics and the public. Faithful to both the mood and the language of Mr. McCarthy's book, it is well made without being ostentatious in its virtuosity: stark, lean (in spite of a two-hour running time) and plenty mean. Javier Bardem plays Anton Chigurh, an emanation of pure metaphysical evil with a soft voice and peculiar haircut. Tommy Lee Jones plays Bell, a weary West Texas sheriff -- a close kinsman to the character he played in his own Cannes prize winner, ''The Three Burials of Melquiades Estrada'' -- who pursues Chigurh through lonely motels and dusty outposts. Bell utters a line that, wrenched wildly out of context, might make a fitting motto for the weary cowboys of the Cannes festival: ''If this ain't the mess, it'll do until the mess gets here.'' A. O.

Ms. Streisand's high-strung renditions of ''The Way We Were,'' ''How Do You Keep the Music Playing?,'' ''You Don't Bring Me Flowers'' and ''What Are You Doing the Rest of Your Life?'' may be the definitive, weepy, show-stopping interpretations.

2007-05-22T20:00:54Z,"With the title of his 1980 book, the journalist Sidney Blumenthal coined a term that has entered the political lexicon: ""The Permanent Campaign."" The phrase denotes the blurring of the line in modern times between campaigning and governing. Presidents, of course, have always made decisions with an eye on their popularity. But with the advent of television, polling, and professional consultants, presidents of the 1970s and '80s-Nixon, Carter, and Reagan in particular-upped the ante by devoting the full arsenal of modern electioneering tools not just to winning office but to holding office as well.Recently, the permanent campaign has added yet another stage-a final frontier. This is the fight for history, centered on the presidents' libraries. The presidential libraries date from 1939, when Franklin Delano Roosevelt conceived his as a repository for his public papers, to be built with private funds and run by public officials. Since then, chief executives have sought to outdo their predecessors by entombing their archives in extravagant, self-memorializing shrines. These museums extend the permanent campaign by utilizing the same public relations techniques as a race for the White House-and lately requiring comparable fundraising efforts to boot."

In a statement, the group said that “2007 is stacking up to be similar to and in some instances worse than 2000, a year which until now had the dubious distinction of being the peak year for air-travel delays.” Most airport improvement projects — for runways, terminals, gates and the like — are paid for by the so-called passenger facility charge added to the price of airline tickets. That charge has been capped by Congress at $4.50 since 2000, but the council said Congress should increase the cap."

The difference between universal coverage and universal health care is not semantic; it is real and fundamental. If we truly want all children to get the health care they need, then we must simply give all children the health care they need, not require parents to repeatedly prove that their children are worthy of publicly financed services."

Though Mr. Carter tried to take it back on Monday, saying on the ''Today'' show that his remarks were ''careless or misinterpreted'' and that he was ''not talking personally about any president,'' he has still incited a tsk-tsking tsunami in the capital."

The progressive bloc has yielded entirely too much to the anti-immigrant and produced an accord that is unjust and unworkable. I would add here, also, that comprehensive immigration reform must include discussion on issues of trade and serious economic assistance to poorer countries that will genuinely help them develop viable economies and other social structures."
2007-05-22T00:00:00Z,"An obituary on Friday about Denis G. Kuhn, an architect and preservationist, gave an erroneous credit for the master plan for a proposed suburban community in Gaithersburg, Md. The project was overseen by Matthew J. Bell of Ehrenkrantz Eckstut & Kuhn Architects, not by Mr. Kuhn. The obituary also misstated the reopening date of the Alexander Hamilton Custom House on Bowling Green in Lower Manhattan, vacated in the 1970s, which Mr. Kuhn turned into the Smithsonian's National Museum of the American Indian. The building reopened in 1987, when the Federal Bankruptcy Court moved into two floors -- not in 1994, when the museum opened on three additional floors."

The lead prosecutor, Assistant United States Attorney Daniel A. Saunders, said at a hearing yesterday that it would take the government seven to eight weeks to present its case. Judge Dale S. Fischer urged Mr. Saunders to adjust that estimate downward and said the new trial date was a firm one.

2007-05-22T00:00:00Z,"Stallone Fined for Hormone Imports Sylvester Stallone, right, officially became a convict in Australia yesterday. Having already pleaded guilty to charges of importing restricted muscle-building hormones, he was ordered to pay $10,651 in fines and court costs in Sydney. He was not present in court. Paul Cloran, the New South Wales state deputy chief magistrate, said Mr. Stallone, star of the ''Rocky'' and ''Rambo'' films, had failed to establish that he had a valid prescription for dozens of vials of human growth hormone in his luggage when he arrived in Sydney in February for a promotional tour. Although prosecutors said he had legitimate medical reasons for carrying the drug, he also failed to declare the male hormone testosterone on a customs entry form. In an interview with customs officials Mr. Stallone, 60, said he was carrying large amounts of the growth hormone because he was about to spend three months in Thailand and Myanmar, formerly Burma, filming a new ''Rambo'' adventure. ''As you get older, the pituitary gland slows, and you feel older, your bones narrow,'' he said, according to court documents. ''This stuff gives your body a boost, and you feel and look good. Doing 'Rambo' is hard work. Where do you think I am going to get this stuff in Burma?'' Harry Potter: Signed, Sealed, Delivered Images from the covers of all seven Harry Potter adventures will appear on a set of postage stamps to be issued by the Royal Mail in Britain on July 17, commemorating the July 21 publication of the final volume of the J. K. Rowling stories about the boy wizard. The crests of the Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry and its four houses will appear on some of the stamps, Agence France-Presse reported. First-class stamps, they will each be priced at 34 pence, or 67 cents. The Royal Mail said it was ''proud to commemorate and celebrate an illustrious British author and a true global publishing phenomenon.'' Among authors previously celebrated by the Royal Mail are Lewis Carroll, Roald Dahl, T. S. Eliot, C. S. Lewis, Beatrix Potter and J. R. R. Tolkien. Julia Roberts's New Project Julia Roberts, below, will collaborate once more with Working Title, the company that made ''Notting Hill,'' when she stars in a film about Joan Root, the renowned British conservationist who was shot to death at 69 in her bedroom in Kenya, in January 2006, Variety.com reported. The untitled project, inspired by the Vanity Fair article ''A Flowering Evil,'' will deal with Ms. Root's earlier life, including the making of nature films with her husband, Alan. After they were divorced in 1981, she turned her 88-acre property in Naivasha, Kenya, into a wildlife refuge and devoted herself into saving Lake Naivasha from ecological damage. Vexation From Cannes Africa and Iran expressed displeasure with the Cannes Film Festival yesterday. The African Filmmakers Producers Guild wondered in a statement if the festival was discriminating against movies from that continent, Agence France-Presse reported. No African film in a decade has been chosen to compete for the top prizes. ''Is this pure chance or linked to color discrimination against our images?'' the guild asked in a statement. No immediate comment was available from the festival organizers. Iran issued a protest to France over the screening of ''Persepolis,'' an animated film about a woman growing up in revolutionary Iran, Agence France-Presse reported. The government-run Farabi Cinema Foundation asked if the selection of ''Persepolis'' was ''a political or even anti-cultural act'' on the part of the festival. The film was adapted from a best-selling series of graphic books by the Iranian émigré Marjane Satrapi."

Because of No Child Left Behind and overzealous states and cities, curriculum and teaching in English and math classrooms have been reduced to test prep, tests, test scoring and test review.

2007-05-22T00:00:00Z,"One of the most fertile subjects of contemporary European cinema is the desolation of contemporary European life. The extravagance and high spirits outside the Cannes screening rooms thus frequently stand in jarring contrast to the misery displayed within them, where stories of privation, disconnection and violence hold up a corrective mirror to a continent that likes to present itself to the rest of the world as prosperous, unified and at peace. A particular theme within some of these stories is the harshness of existence in Europe's formerly Communist nations. ''Import/Export,'' a disturbing and sometimes brilliant new film by the Austrian director Ulrich Seidl, is set partly in Ukraine, depicted as a place where dirty snow swirls around crumbling Soviet-era housing projects. Not that Vienna, the movie's other main locale, looks much better. In its own way, this Western capital seems like an equally cold and brutal environment."

2007-05-22T00:00:00Z,"As a growing number of Americans are learning, surviving cancer can mean slipping into a rabbit hole of long-term medical problems -- from premature menopause and sexual dysfunction to more debilitating side effects of chemotherapy and radiation, like heart disease and even new cancers. The realization that cancer and its aftermath can go on for years has given rise to a medical specialty known as survivorship. At several major hospitals around the country, survivor programs financed by the Lance Armstrong Foundation are focusing on life after cancer."

2007-05-22T00:00:00Z,"With ''Paranoid Park,'' an intimate character study of an accidental killer, Gus Van Sant has returned to Cannes with one of the most moving and delicately felt films of his fascinating career. (He won the Palme d'Or in 2003 for ''Elephant.'') Shot by the cinematographers Christopher Doyle and Rain Kathy Li with an acute sensitivity to color as an index of feeling and mood, the film unwinds as a series of nonlinear flashbacks, some of which repeat like the refrain of a song. Though based on Blake Nelson's young-adult novel of the same title, Mr. Van Sant's film -- he wrote the lean screenplay, as well as directed and edited -- is a work of art that exploits the plasticity of his own medium to eerie, at times rapturous effect. The angel-faced Gabe Nevins plays Alex, a high school student who spends much of his out-of-class time skateboarding with his friends and fending off a girl who is eager to lose her virginity. One evening while visiting Paranoid Park, a swooping concrete paradise for throwaways and runaways, buzzing with the sounds of grinding wheels and excited young voices, Alex inadvertently causes the gruesome death of a security guard. Mr. Van Sant tells what happened to the teenager, still more boy than man, not a hint of down on his chin, as if he were building a mosaic. Each new fragment adds another piece to the whole, which doesn't fully come into view until late in this precisely shaped one-hour-25-minute story."

2007-05-23T19:27:15Z,"If you are shopping on Via Corso or heading back to town from the Coloseum or the Imperial Forum, stop at the wonderful temporary Chagall retrospective exhibit in the Museo Del Risorgimento. The museum is entered through the back side of Rome's ugliest monument, Il Vittoriano, a bright white late 19th Century creation to commemorate Italian unification. (For those who have just done the Schnabel exhibit, Il Vittoriano is the bright white monstrosity right across Piazza Venezia.) The Chagalls could be better organized and displayed, but there are dozens of terrific paintings spanning 6 decades of the artist's work. Particularly interesting for those in Rome who are overdosed on traditional religious art, are Chagall's unconventional renderings of the Bible, in which Jesus is shown with all the trappings of Judaism (notice the Torah), placed in what looks like Chagall's birthplace in a village in Russia. To finish your visit, head upstairs to the museum's outdoor cafe, on a terrace overlooking the ruins of the Imperial Forum. The coffee is excellent. The sangria not bad. Most important, the terrace has one of the best panoramas of Rome, with excellent signs that help you make sense of the forest of spires and arches you are seeing. Just FYI this outing is very kid-friendly; I did this one with my 15-year-old, who loved both the art and the view."

It is with great sadness that Hebrew Union College-Jewish Institute of Religion records the death of Maria Bamberger, the dear wife of the late Fritz Bamberger, my teacher, beloved member of the HUC-JIR faculty and treasured advisor to my predecessors, Nelson Glueck and Alfred Gottschalk. Maria was a dramatic presence in Israel and instrumental in the founding of our Jerusalem campus. Her life, and that of Fritz, reflected an abiding devotion to HUC-JIR. May the family find comfort together with all those who mourn for Zion and Jerusalem and may Maria's memory be a blessing to all who knew her.

2007-05-23T00:00:00Z,"Nortel Networks said it would pay 1 million Canadian dollars ($921,000) as part of a settlement with the Ontario Securities Commission. The payment is not a fine. The company called it a contribution toward the cost of the commission's investigation into accounting irregularities at the company from 2000 to 2003. Nortel, the communications equipment maker, acknowledged in the agreement that its senior executives had improperly altered accounting policies and provisions to improve the company's apparent financial performance. Under the agreement, the company must give the commission special quarterly and annual reports on efforts to improve its accounting controls. Nortel fired its chief executive, Frank A. Dunn, and two other executives over the bookkeeping issues in 2004. The former executives face separate charges by the Ontario regulator. The Securities and Exchange Commission has also charged the three as well as other former Nortel employees. Law enforcement officials in both Canada and the United States are also investigating the company. IAN AUSTEN"

All food flavors come from chemical molecules. If it is possible to create the molecule that produces a particular flavor artificially, there is no difference between that taste and the taste of the natural product except for the snobbery attached to the rarity or the expense of the natural product."

And even unpeeled, the stalks, once they have been cooked, fade to dull, dark green from violet. Unlike purple asparagus that has been shipped from distant farms, the slender-to-medium-size organic purple spears that Norwich Meadows Farms in Norwich, N.Y., sells are so fresh, tender and sweet that they do not need to be peeled -- or even cooked.

2007-05-23T00:00:00Z,"Sleaze rarely looks as lovely and plays with such sentiment as it does in Abel Ferrara's ''Go Go Tales,'' a down-and-dirty story about a nightclub owner and the beauties and beasts who work for him. The film, which unfortunately, if unsurprisingly, is screening out of competition, is easily Mr. Ferrara's best since ''The Funeral'' (1996) and welcome news for his hard-core, patient admirers. (Its commitment to female pulchritude comes unadorned by self-consciously belabored art and ideas.) An obvious homage to John Cassavetes's underbelly classic ''The Killing of a Chinese Bookie'' (1976), ''Go Go Tales'' also works rather poignantly as a metaphor for the down-and-dirty independence that Mr. Ferrara has pursued his entire filmmaking career. A terrific Willem Dafoe, his Joker-like smile stretched across his face, plays the titular owner of Ray Ruby's Paradise, a strip club pulsing with music and an atmosphere of desperation. Times are tough at Ray Ruby's: the coffers are empty, the strippers haven't been paid and the landlady (Sylvia Miles), parked on a bar stool like a toad on a lily pad, is screeching for the rent. Ms. Miles, whose voice scratches against your eardrums like fingernails on a chalkboard, seemingly a mere decibel away from puncture, provides just one of the many squawks and shouts that create the cacophony that fills Ray Ruby's Paradise to the rafters, flooding it with noise and the vibrant thrum of humanity. Few other performers can upstage a roomful of naked women as effortlessly."

2007-05-23T00:00:00Z,"If you wanted to identify a moviegoing experience that was the utter antithesis of the grungy, sleazy aesthetic memorialized in ''Grindhouse,'' it would have to be a competition screening at the Palais des Festivals in Cannes. And not only because the patrons are more apt to be wearing evening gowns than dirty raincoats. True, a certain grindhouse spirit lives on in the bowels of the Palais, headquarters of the Cannes Film Market, where slasher movies and action pictures with titles that sound like parodies (''Thunder Man,'' ''The Fear Chamber'') are bought for late-night cable and DVD discount bins. But upstairs, where the official selections are screened, an air of reverence and refinement reigns. The idea that a battered, patchily spliced print would be projected with missing reels and tinny sound -- effects painstakingly reproduced by Quentin Tarantino and Robert Rodriguez in ''Grindhouse'' -- is beyond scandalous."

Panda pregnancies cannot be confirmed until shortly before the delivery date. Gestation lasts about 133 days, which means Ya Ya, who is 6, could give birth soon. She and a male panda, 8-year-old Le Le, are on loan to the zoo from China. Pandas are notoriously poor breeders, one reason the species is endangered, and females have only three days a year in which they can conceive."

If it fails, it will not meet the 20-year benchmarks set by the California Department of Transportation in 2005, reported the Public Policy Institute of California, a nonpartisan research group.

This week, with the publication of a special issue of the Journal of Athletic Training, the information is being made public for the first time. Some of the findings are predictable: college baseball players get banged up while sliding, and basketball often causes ankle and knee injuries. But others are eye-opening: female ice hockey players, for instance, sustain almost as many concussions as men, even though they (supposedly) aren’t allowed to body check.“This report should lead to investigations of rule changes or equipment modifications” that would increase player safety, says Randall W. Dick, associate director of research for the N.C.A.A. In the meantime, it makes for revelatory, if wince-inducing reading, with its repeated descriptions of sprains, strains, concussions, "

But this summer, the now sleeping giant is open to anyone with enough enthusiasm to climb it — and enough good sense to reserve a spot well in advance. From now through October, only 100 hikers per day are allowed on Mount St. Helens; permits are available online only — and on a first-come, first-served basis — for $22. The route takes from seven-to-12 hours round-trip, and gains 4,500 feet over five miles to the 8,365-foot high crater rim, into which climbers can peer. Though the hike requires no ropes or crampons, expect to wear hard hats and dust masks, as the mountain still belches. You can hike on your own (with a permit) or with a guide; Oregon Peak Adventures offers day trips from $150 per person, including permits, transportation and food."

The news media’s attention on his N.B.A. quest wore on him, his agent says, and he struggled through the first half of the season in the Israeli league. But in the second half he turned things around and led Tel Aviv to the playoffs, where the team is still alive. The Seattle SuperSonics chose Halperin in the second round of the 2006 draft and still own his N.B.A. rights, but will likely not make a decision about his future until June, according to the agent, Jason Levien. How does Halperin view a potential future in the N.B.A.? “There was so much media hype and attention about him playing in the N.B.A. that he is not talking to the media about it right now,” Levien said. “He just doesn’t want to talk about it.”."

Litvinenko will have its world premiere on Saturday as an entry in the Cannes Film Festival, The Associated Press reported. Andrei Nekrasov, right, a friend of Mr. Litvinenko's who directed the film, ''Rebellion: The Litvinenko Case,'' said, ''I wanted to make a documentary which goes beyond information, and which looks deeper into people's motives, without which we will never understand why he was killed.'' On Tuesday British authorities accused a Russian businessman, Andrei K. Lugovoi, of using a radioactive isotope, polonium 210, to murder Mr. Litvinenko, 43, a foe of the Kremlin, in London in November. Mr. Lugovoi proclaimed his innocence. Mr. Litvinenko, on his deathbed, accused President Vladimir V. Putin of responsibility for the poisoning, a charge the Kremlin dismissed as ridiculous. Mr. Nekrasov said the organizers of the festival had made the decision to keep his film a secret. ''I can't say the reason was political pressure,'' he said. ''They do this sort of surprise screening sometimes.'' Italian Groups Protest Streisand Ticket Prices Italian consumer groups, incensed by ticket prices of $200 to $1,200, are urging the authorities to cancel a concert by Barbra Streisand, below, scheduled for the 24,000-seat Stadio Flaminio in Rome on June 15, The Associated Press reported. In an appeal to the City of Rome, which owns the stadium, and the Italian Olympic Committee, which manages it, the consumer groups Adusbef and Codacons called the ticket prices ''absurd and shameful.'' Their statement said the stadium was ''public property and cannot be used for immoral deals that are shameful to a civilized country.'' Concert organizers were not immediately available for comment. The performance in Rome, at the start of Ms. Streisand's European tour, would be her first in Italy. Tickets for her London shows in July, also with a top price of $1,200, sold out within minutes this month, organizers said. Literature by the Byte ''Moby-Dick'' is being served up in bite-size pieces by a new Web site that specializes in classic literature delivered in easy-to-digest installments, Reuters reported. The snippets, sent every day by Daily Lit (dailylit.com) to subscribers' hand-held devices or e-mail accounts, are intended to be read in less than five minutes. Jules Verne's ''Around the World in 80 Days'' would arrive in 82 parts, and Tolstoy's ''Anna Karenina'' would unfold in 430. ''Our audience includes people like us, who spend hours each day on e-mail but can't find the time to read a book,'' said Albert Wenger, a founder of the site. So far, he said, 50,000 people have signed up, and since the site's 370 or so titles, mostly classics, are out of copyright, they are offered free. But in a few weeks DailyLit plans to expand and charge for newer titles. ''We're looking to charge under $5 per title,'' said Mr. Wenger's wife and the site's co-founder, Susan Danziger. Through a deal with DailyLit, Berlitz will soon be offering five-minute language lessons."

2007-05-24T00:00:00Z,"It may not seem surprising that the leading French film festival should feature a number of movies that show France in a flattering light, but the cinematic love letters to the country popping up on Cannes screens this year are not self-addressed billets-doux, even though high self-regard is a longstanding Gallic tradition. Given that a theme of the recent French presidential election was a perceived national identity crisis, it is possible to imagine the present cluster of pro-French movies by non-French directors as a kind of friendly reassurance. Hey, these filmmakers seem to be saying, don't be so down on yourselves. We love you. And so Hou Hsiao-hsien, from Taiwan, paid tribute in ''The Flight of the Red Balloon'' both to a classic French children's movie and to the everyday loveliness of Paris. And Michael Moore, as if saying merci for his Palme d'Or three years ago, turned a paean to the French welfare state into the comic centerpiece of ''Sicko,'' his indictment of the American health care system. So benevolent is the French government, in Mr. Moore's knowingly wide-eyed account, that it not only treats its citizens' maladies, but also does their laundry. (Not all the time, of course.

2007-05-24T00:00:00Z,"One of the energizing and occasionally enervating consequences of attending an international film festival is that it forces you to face your own impatience. Much commercial cinema moves at a fairly accelerated clip, with anxious camerawork and nanosecond editing that verges on a flicker effect. Confronted with the longer takes and languorous pacing of some of the festival's offerings, viewers hooked on speed cinema rush toward the exit, fall asleep in their seats or try to slow their biorhythms down, way down. Such was the case with ''The Man From London,'' by the Hungarian filmmaker Bela Tarr, making his first appearance in the main competition with this austere black-and-white work that had the press fleeing like panicked slaughterhouse cattle. It isn't bad, not at all. But it moves with Mr. Tarr's characteristic deliberation, with leisurely shots that find the camera wending through confined interiors and a few exteriors for minutes at a time without interruption. Based on a novel by Georges Simenon and set in some undefined port town, it involves a night guard who watches over a shipping dock from inside a glassed-in tower. One evening he witnesses the accidental murder of a man holding a suitcase. He retrieves the case, which turns out to be stuffed with enough cash (£60,000) to make at least one Hungarian lose his bearings. An investigation ensues, but mostly there are long takes and long walks and the remarkable transformation of film space into a state of mind."

According to a study recently published in the medical journal Cancer, the decline could be a result of a shortage of available testing, questions about the effectiveness of the exam and higher patient co-payments.

The son of Isidore Glynn and Tillie Sheinbaum, he was born in Passaic, NJ, and raised by his stepmother, Frieda Helman. A WWII Naval veteran, he attended college and medical school at NYU. He devoted his life to public health in New York, counseling patients, supervising psychiatric care and training social workers. He was the Director of Clinical Services at the Youth Counseling League and a consulting psychiatrist for the Jewish Board of Family and Children's Services. Dr. Glynn had an abiding love for the arts. His writings on psychoanalysis and art were published in Art News and The Print Collector's Newsletter. His description of Adrian Stokes reads like a self-portrait: ''the passion for art, the intensity of concern, the almost raw hyperactive quality of a sensibility that threatens at times to engulf all else -the nature is a 19th century one determined to order itself by the 20th century's monumental new view, psychoanalysis.''

2007-05-24T00:00:00Z,"The director of the Juilliard Choral Union has resigned, raising questions about the survival of the chorus, which has carved out a prominent role in the city's musical scene. The director, Judith Clurman, who has led the group for all of its seven years and counts many loyal followers in it, declined to say yesterday why she was leaving. ''I just say I love my chorus,'' she said. Joseph W. Polisi, Juilliard's president, said Ms. Clurman's resignation had prompted the school to consider putting the chorus on hiatus next season. Its fate is made more tenuous by the lack of future engagements with Juilliard's student orchestras, and by renovations that have made space tight, Mr. Polisi said. The news came on the eve of Juilliard's commencement concert yesterday, when the chorus was scheduled to sing in Beethoven's Ninth Symphony. The choral union, an amateur group that includes singers from the Juilliard School and the New York area, has also performed with the New York City Ballet and as part of Lincoln Center's American Songbook series.

2007-05-24T00:00:00Z,"Emissions of carbon dioxide from fuel burned in the United States dropped 1.3 percent in 2006 compared with an all-time peak reached the year before, according to preliminary data from the Energy Department. The United States remains the leading source of the carbon dioxide, the main emission linked to global warming. The White House quickly hailed the downturn, even in the face of economic growth, as evidence that President Bush's policies for slowing growth in emissions without a mandatory cap were working. Some scientists and private environmental groups noted that the cause, according to the government, was mainly moderate weather and high prices for oil, natural gas and electricity. Over all, emissions were up 17.9 percent since 1990. ANDREW C. REVKIN"

I recommend watching the GP2 race tomorrow if you have access to it on television, or here at the track.

2007-05-25T00:00:00Z,"(Wednesday) The Russian soprano Anna Netrebko, above, can pretty much do whatever she wants in today's opera world -- if she can find the time to do it. In March 2006 she canceled her Carnegie Hall debut, saying she simply did not have time to prepare properly. She has given recitals with piano accompaniment, but she has also said that for the time being she prefers to keep her focus on opera. Accordingly, her rescheduled debut is along more operatic lines, with the Orchestra of St. Luke's and with the baritone Dmitri Hvorostovsky, who is Ms. Netrebko's equal partner. Mr. Hvorostovsky -- also Russian, also famously good-looking -- can sing like a dream. His calling card is his unbelievable breath support, which is an unshowy and sometimes unjustly overlooked piece of technical know-how. And reveling in sound and good technique is what these opera-highlight concerts are all about; for fans they are like pastry trays, with one sugary treat after another. This one features a couple of orchestral interludes (including, for some reason, the string sextet from Strauss's ''Capriccio''), a couple of songs and the requisite spectrum of arias and duets, including Nedda-Silvio from ''Pagliacci'' and the closing duet from ''Eugene Onegin,'' which should be particularly worthwhile. Asher Fisch conducts.

SUNY said that if Dr. Clark is approved by its board on May 31, he will remain through Dec. 31, or until its trustees conclude a national search for a permanent chancellor. Dr. Clark, 56, will earn $340,000, but will not be a candidate for permanent chancellor, the university said. KAREN W. ARENSON"

2007-05-25T00:00:00Z,"You can trace various influences running through the work of all artists. But more than most choreographers, Eiko & Koma seem to inhabit a singular artistic space, as if they had come into being fully formed, the creative equivalent of Athena springing from the head of Zeus, ready for war. They are creatures of the stage, not the battlefield. The out-of-time, fantastical worlds that this Japanese-American pair create through glacial movement and magical design elements linger in the mind's eye long after each performance concludes. For the past two years Danspace Project audiences have had the great fortune to witness these wonder-inducing spectacles, free, in the spooky graveyard of St. Mark's Church. This weekend Eiko & Koma are joined by the two teenage Cambodian performers, above: Chakreya So, or Charian, left, and Setheap Sorn, or Peace. They will dance in ''Cambodian Stories Revisited,'' a continuation of a multidisciplinary work performed last year at Asia Society. Movement and painting will share the space as Eiko & Koma explore the ideas of mentors and generations -- perhaps this untraceable pair will be able to pass on a few secrets to their lucky young collaborators.

(Brantley) 'CURTAINS' This musical comedy about a musical-comedy murder -- featuring songs by John Kander and Fred Ebb and a book by Rupert Holmes -- lies on the stage like a promisingly gaudy string of firecrackers, waiting in vain for a match. The good news is that David Hyde Pierce, playing a diffident Boston detective, steps into full-fledged Broadway stardom. Scott Ellis directs a talent-packed cast that includes Debra Monk and Karen Ziemba. (2:30). Al Hirschfeld Theater, 302 West 45th Street, Clinton, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley) 'DEUCE' Back on Broadway for the first time in 25 years, Angela Lansbury is so vitally and indelibly present that she even gives flesh to this flimsy comedy. Terrence McNally's play, about the reunion of two former doubles partners (Ms. Lansbury and Marian Seldes), is a jerry-built shrine to enduring star power. Directed by Michael Blakemore (1:45). Music Box Theater, 239 West 45th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley) * 'FROST/NIXON' Frank Langella turns in a truly titanic performance as Richard M. Nixon in Peter Morgan's briskly entertaining, if all-too-tidy, play about the former president's annihilating television interviews with the British talk show host David Frost (the excellent Michael Sheen). Michael Grandage directs with the momentum of a ticking-bomb thriller and the zing of a boulevard comedy (1:40). Jacobs Theater, 242 West 45th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley) * 'GREY GARDENS' Christine Ebersole is absolutely glorious as the middle-aged, time-warped debutante called Little Edie Beale in this uneven musical adaptation of the notorious 1975 documentary of the same title. She and the wonderful Mary Louise Wilson (as her bedridden mother), in the performances of their careers, make ''Grey Gardens'' an experience no passionate theatergoer should miss (2:40). Walter Kerr Theater, 219 West 48th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley) 'INHERIT THE WIND' Doug Hughes's wooden revival of this worthy war horse, based on the Scopes ''monkey'' trial of 1925, never musters much more velocity than a drugstore fan. Be grateful that the cast includes Christopher Plummer, in savory form as a Will Rogers of jurisprudence. An oddly subdued Brian Dennehy plays his pompous adversary (2:00). Lyceum Theater, 149 West 45th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley) * 'JOURNEY'S END' A splendid revival of R. C. Sherriff's 1928 drama of life in the trenches during World War I. Acutely staged (by David Grindley) and acted by a fine ensemble led by Hugh Dancy and Boyd Gaines, this production offers an exemplary presentation of that theatrical rarity, an uncompromising, clear-eyed play about war and the experience of day-to-day combat. An essential ticket (2:40).Belasco Theater, 111 West 44th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley) 'LEGALLY BLONDE' This nonstop sugar rush of a musical about a powder puff who finds her inner power-broker, based on the 2001 film, approximates the experience of eating a jumbo bag of Gummi Bears in one sitting. Flossing between songs is recommended (2:20). Palace Theater, 1564 Broadway, at 47th Street, (212) 307-4100. (Brantley) 'LOVEMUSIK' As Lotte Lenya and Kurt Weill, Donna Murphy and Michael Cerveris turn in stunningly shaded performances in what is, alas, a sluggish, mixed-up bio-musical. Scored with an eclectic sampler of Weill's songs, ''LoveMusik'' strives to achieve chilly distance and cozy intimacy in the same breath. Harold Prince directs; Alfred Uhry wrote the conventionally sentimental book (2:40). Biltmore Theater, 261 West 47th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley) 'MARY POPPINS' This handsome, homily-packed, mechanically ingenious and rather tedious musical, adapted from the P. L. Travers stories and the 1964 film, is ultimately less concerned with inexplicable magic than with practical psychology. Ashley Brown, who sings prettily as the family-mending nanny, looks like Joan Crawford trying to be nice and sounds like Dr. Phil. Directed by Richard Eyre and Matthew Bourne (2:30). New Amsterdam Theater, 214 West 42nd Street, (212) 307-4747. (Brantley) 'LES MISÉRABLES' This premature revival, a slightly scaled-down version of the well-groomed behemoth that closed only three years ago, appears to be functioning in a state of mild sedation. Appealingly sung and freshly orchestrated, this fast-moving adaptation of Victor Hugo's novel isn't sloppy or blurry. But its pulse rate stays well below normal (2:55). Broadhurst Theater, 235 West 44th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley) 'A MOON FOR THE MISBEGOTTEN' Kevin Spacey gives a bizarre, beat-the-clock performance, as lively as a frog on a hot plate, as James Tyrone in this off-kilter revival of Eugene O'Neill's last play. Mercifully, he does not block the view of Eve Best, who maps the contradictory levels of Tyrone's strapping love interest with clarity and intelligence (2:50). Brooks Atkinson Theater, 256 West 47th Street, (212) 307-4100. (Brantley) '110 IN THE SHADE' Is it possible for a performance to be too good? Audra McDonald brings such breadth of skill and depth of feeling to Lonny Price's lukewarm revival of this musical about a love-starved spinster that she threatens to burst the seams of this small, homey musical. She's an overwhelming presence in an underwhelming show (2:30). Studio 54, 254 West 54th Street, (212) 719-1300. (Brantley) 'THE PIRATE QUEEN' How to river-dance your way to the bottom of the ocean, courtesy of the songwriters of ''Les Misérables'' (2:30). Hilton Theater, 213 West 42nd Street, (212) 307-4100. (Brantley) 'RADIO GOLF' The final -- and in dramatic terms, the weakest -- of August Wilson's magnificent 10-play cycle about the African-American experience, ''Radio Golf'' has the crackle of a bustling comedy. But this tale of getting and spending in the 1990s, directed by Kenny Leon, throbs with a lament for a lost time, a lost culture, a lost language (2:30). Cort Theater, 138 West 48th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley) * 'SPRING AWAKENING' Duncan Sheik and Steven Sater's bold adaptation of the Frank Wedekind play is the freshest and most exciting new musical Broadway has seen in some time. Set in 19th-century Germany but with a ravishing rock score, it exposes the splintered emotional lives of adolescents just discovering the joys and sorrows of sex. Performed with brio by a great cast, with supple direction by Michael Mayer and inventive choreography by Bill T. Jones (2:00). Eugene O'Neill Theater, 230 West 49th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Charles Isherwood) * 'TALK RADIO' The most lacerating portrait of a human meltdown this side of a Francis Bacon painting. Playing an abrasive radio talk show host with a God complex, the astounding Liev Schreiber seems to fill the air as inescapably as weather in Robert Falls's gut-grabbing revival of Eric Bogosian's 1987 play (1:40). Longacre Theater, 220 West 48th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley) 'THE YEAR OF MAGICAL THINKING' Joan Didion's arresting but ultimately frustrating adaptation of her best-selling memoir about being blindsided by grief, starring Vanessa Redgrave. The tension between style and emotional content that made the book such a stunner does not translate to the stage. The substance here is in the silences, when the focus shifts from words to Ms. Redgrave's wry, wounded face (1:40). Booth Theater, 222 West 45th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley) Off Broadway 'ALL THE WRONG REASONS: A TRUE STORY OF NEO-NAZIS, DRUG SMUGGLING AND UNDYING LOVE' John Fugelsang's amiable solo show mixes memoir and stand-up comedy in a tale of family, faith and Roman Catholic guilt. Slight but engaging (1:30). New York Theater Workshop, 79 East Fourth Street, East Village, (212) 460-5475. (Isherwood) 'BE' A high-energy, low-content Israeli show that blends music, dance and sex appeal in the latest attempt to tap into the ''Stomp'' market (1:30). Union Square Theater, 100 East 17th Street, Flatiron district, (212) 307-4100. (Jason Zinoman) 'BILL W. AND DR. BOB' This insightful new play about the founders of Alcoholics Anonymous subtly makes the claim that the recovery movement was born as a series of accidents. Patrick Husted is excellent as Bob Smith, Bill Wilson's partner in combating addictions (2:15). New World Stages, 340 West 50th Street, Clinton, (212) 239-6200. (Ginia Bellafante) * 'BLACKBIRD' David Harrower's stunning new drama looks back at a sexual relationship -- between a 40-year-old man and a 12-year-old girl -- that transforms, cripples and paralyzes. Jeff Daniels and Alison Pill, both extraordinary, peel their characters down to their barest souls. Joe Mantello is the masterly director (1:30). Manhattan Theater Club at City Center Stage I, 131 West 55th Street, (212) 581-1212. (Brantley) 'THE BRIG' Serious students of the stage will want to check out the Living Theater's first revival since 1963 of Kenneth H. Brown's docudrama about the soul-shredding grind of daily life in a Marine Corps prison, once again directed by the company co-founder Judith Malina. One of the most celebrated productions in the company's history, ''The Brig'' harks back to an era when theater was at the forefront of both political and artistic radicalism (2:00). Living Theater, 21 Clinton Street, Lower East Side. (Isherwood) 'DAUGHTER OF A CUBAN REVOLUTIONARY' A standard-issue solo play about a fascinating Cuban family (1:10). DR2 Theater, 103 East 15th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Zinoman) 'THE FANTASTICKS' A revival -- well, more like a resuscitation -- of the Little Musical That Wouldn't Die. This sweet-as-ever production of Tom Jones and Harvey Schmidt's commedia-dell'arte-style confection is most notable for Mr. Jones's touching performance (under the pseudonym Thomas Bruce) as the Old Actor, a role he created when the show opened in 1960. Mr. Jones also directs (2:05). Snapple Theater Center, 210 West 50th Street, (212) 307-4100. (Brantley) 'GASLIGHT' The Irish Repertory Theater's revival of Patrick Hamilton's 1938 thriller about a husband intent on driving his wife mad strips away the claustrophobia and ably resists clichéd feminist interpretation. As the impish detective who saves the day, Brian Murray is the play's great leavening agent. He prompts the heroine to whiskey drinking, and you want to raise a glass to him (2:00). Irish Repertory Theater, 132 West 22nd Street, Chelsea, (212) 727-2737. (Bellafante) 'GOD'S EAR' Jenny Schwartz's formally inventive and brilliantly performed drama about how the death of a child affects a family is more interested in language than in narrative (1:20). East 13th Street Theater, 136 East 13th Street, East Village, (212) 868-4444. (Zinoman) 'I LOVE YOU , YOU'RE PERFECT, NOW CHANGE!' This revue has proved as indestructible as the truisms about men and women on which it is based: it has run for 11 years Off Broadway and spread around the world. Now one of its avatars is coming for a visit: the Mandarin production with Lin Yilun, a major Chinese star, has arrived in New York for a limited run, playing concurrently with the English version. This is supposedly the first time a foreign production of an American musical has played in the United States (and the first Chinese-language production of a major American musical). It will be interesting to see how the piece's hoary stereotypes change in translation; Joel Bishoff, the original director, modified the piece to reflect Chinese culture for its Shanghai run (2:00). The Westside Theater, 407 West 43rd Street, Clinton, (212 239-6200. (Anne Midgette) * 'IN THE HEIGHTS' Lin-Manuel Miranda's joyous songs paint a vibrant portrait of daily life in Washington Heights in this flawed but enjoyable show. Essentially a valentine to the barrio -- conflict of a violent or desperate kind is banished from the picture -- the musical contains a host of funny performances and brings the zesty sound of Latin pop to the stage. (2:10). 37 Arts, 450 West 37th Street, (212) 307-4100. (Isherwood) 'THE J.A.P. SHOW: JEWISH AMERICAN PRINCESSES of comedy' Laughs along with longueurs (1:30). Actors Temple Theater, 339 West 47th Street, Clinton, (212) 239-6200. (Lawrence Van Gelder) 'A JEW GROWS IN BROOKLYN' You don't have to be Jewish or Brooklynish to empathize with Jake Ehrenreich, but in terms of fully appreciating his essentially one-man show, it probably helps. Especially the Catskills jokes (2:05). 37 Arts, 450 West 37th Street, (212) 560-8912. (Anita Gates) 'MOTHER LOAD' In her one-woman show on the perils of affluent motherhood, Amy Wilson derides the culture of obsessive child-rearing as she chronicles her submission to it. An affable presence onstage, Ms. Wilson nevertheless mines overly clichéd territory: the nut allergies, the horrors of preschool admission, the importance of knowing two languages by the time you are 3. Posters on Urbanbaby.com will find themselves amusedly looking in the mirror. All other New Yorkers will find themselves wanting to move to Patagonia (1:15). Sage Theater, 711 Seventh Avenue, at 47th Street, (212) 279-4200. (Bellafante) 'MY MOTHER'S ITALIAN, MY FATHER'S JEWISH AND I'M IN THERAPY' Steve Solomon does skillful impersonations in his one-man show, but some of his jokes are as old as the hills (1:30).Westside Theater Downstairs, 407 West 43rd Street, (212) 239-6200. (Gates) 'NO CHILD' Teachers will love Nilaja Sun's one-woman show about the challenges of teaching drama at Malcolm X High School (1:10). Barrow Street Theater, 27 Barrow Street, at Seventh Avenue South, West Village, (212) 239-6200. (Gates) * 'PASSING STRANGE' Composer-performer Stew narrates this semi-autobiographical show about a songwriter on a journey of self-discovery. Part rock concert, part book musical, it flows smoothly on a strong current of feeling and humor as the L.A.-born central character searches for his musical voice in the hash bars of Amsterdam and the cabarets of Berlin (2:30). Public Theater, 425 Lafayette Street, at Astor Place, East Village, (212) 967-7555. (Isherwood) 'SILVERLAND' Global warming and the melting of the ice caps have destroyed London in this environmentally (if not dramatically) aware debut. Part of the Brits Off Broadway festival (2:00). 59E59 Theaters, 59 East 59th Street, (212) 279-4200. (Zinoman) * 'SPALDING GRAY: STORIES LEFT TO TELL' A disarming collage of selections from the monologues and journals of Mr. Gray, the ultimate stand-up solipsist, who died in 2004. Directed by Lucy Sexton, and read by five performers, none of whom resemble Mr. Gray, with an affection that shrewdly stops short of hero worship (1:30). Minetta Lane Theater, 18 Minetta Lane, Greenwich Village, (212) 307-4100. (Brantley) Off Off Broadway 'T J AND DAVE' The comics T. J. Jagodowski and Dave Pasquesi miraculously improvise a one-hour play at every performance. This is an impressive feat of mental athletics, but the results are also observant, complex and frequently enormously funny (1:00). Barrow Street Theater, 27 Barrow Street, West Village, (212) 239-6200. (Gates) Long-Running Shows 'ALTAR BOYZ' This sweetly satirical show about a Christian pop group made up of five potential Teen People cover boys is an enjoyable, silly diversion (1:30). New World Stages, 340 West 50th Street, Clinton, (212) 239-6200. (Isherwood) 'AVENUE Q' R-rated puppets give lively life lessons (2:10). Golden Theater, 252 West 45th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley) 'BEAUTY AND THE BEAST' Cartoon made flesh, sort of (2:30). Lunt-Fontanne Theater, 205 West 46th Street, (212) 307-4747. (Brantley) 'CHICAGO' Irrefutable proof that crime pays (2:25). Ambassador Theater, 219 West 49th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley) 'THE COLOR PURPLE' Singing CliffsNotes for Alice Walker's Pulitzer Prize-winning novel (2:40). Broadway Theater, 1681 Broadway, at 53rd Street, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley) 'THE DROWSY CHAPERONE' A pasteboard pastiche of 1920's musicals, as remembered by a witty show queen(1:40). Marquis Theater, 1535 Broadway, at 45th Street, (212) 307-4100. (Brantley) 'FORBIDDEN BROADWAY: SPECIAL VICTIMS UNIT' Often more entertaining than the real thing (1:45). 47th Street Theater, 304 West 47th Street, Clinton, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley) 'HAIRSPRAY' Fizzy pop, cute kids, large man in a housedress (2:30). Neil Simon Theater, 250 West 52nd Street, (212) 307-4100. (Brantley) 'JERSEY BOYS' The biomusical that walks like a man (2:30). August Wilson Theater, 245 West 52nd Street, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley) 'THE LION KING' Disney on safari, where the big bucks roam (2:45). Minskoff Theater, 200 West 45th Street at Broadway, (212) 307-4100. (Brantley) 'MAMMA MIA!' The jukebox that devoured Broadway (2:20). Cadillac Winter Garden Theater, 1634 Broadway, at 50th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley) 'THE PHANTOM OF THE OPERA' Who was that masked man, anyway? (2:30). Majestic Theater, 247 West 44th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley) 'RENT' East Village angst and love songs to die for (2:45). Nederlander Theater, 208 West 41st Street, (212) 307-4100. (Brantley) 'SPAMALOT' A singing scrapbook for Monty Python fans (2:20). Shubert Theater, 225 West 44th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley) 'TARZAN' A writhing green blob with music (2:30). Richard Rodgers Theater, 226 West 46th Street, (212) 307-4747. (Brantley) 'THE 25TH ANNUAL PUTNAM COUNTY SPELLING BEE' ''A Chorus Line'' with pimples (1:45). Circle in the Square, 254 West 50th Street, Manhattan, (212) 239-6200. (Isherwood) 'WICKED' Oz revisited, with political corrections (2:45). Gershwin Theater, 222 West 51st Street, Manhattan, (212) 307-4100. (Brantley) Last Chance 'BEAUTY ON THE VINE' Zak Berkman presents muddled politics and distorted anxieties in his quasi science-fiction play about the influence of plastic surgery on young women who start modeling themselves after a right-wing radio host. Adding to the atmosphere of hysteria is the inability of the actors onstage to render a single subtle or nuanced moment (2:10). Harold Clurman Theater, 412 West 42nd Street, Clinton, (212) 279-4200; closes on Sunday. (Bellafante) 'BETROTHED' Rachel Dickstein weds dance and spoken drama in a distinctive theatrical language. The marriages in this lovely and uneven work are less convincing: aiming to depict women's views about matrimony, this piece, based on three dissimilar short stories, actually depicts marriage as an imprisoning convention from which all three heroines escape. It's no accident that the first part of this triptych, based on Jhumpa Lahiri's story ''The Treatment of Bibi Haldar,'' provides the defining image of the work as a whole: wreathed in a haze of (implied) incense and saffron, this lovely sequence is the strongest of the evening (1:20). Ohio Theater, 66 Wooster Street, SoHo, (212) 868-4444; closes tomorrow. (Midgette) 'CORAM BOY' Set in 18th-century England, this melodrama about imperiled orphans is big and broad but not particularly deep. With a cast of 40, an orchestra in the pit and bursts of choral music (Handel, mostly) decorating the proceedings, it is tastefully splashy and certainly impressive, but less emotionally engaging than you might hope (2:30). Imperial Theater, 249 West 45th Street, (212) 239-6200; closing on Sunday. (Isherwood) * 'HAMLET' Gorilla Rep specializes in outdoor performances of Shakespeare; this workshop is a free indoor performance of an outdoor performance, which removes the gimmick and leaves, simply, good theater. The strong cast revolves around note-perfect portrayals of Claudius and Gertrude (Elizabeth McGuire is particularly fine); of the Polonius family (Al Twanmo plays the patriarch as a kind of insurance salesman battling forgetfulness); and, finally, of Hamlet, which Jacob H. Knoll pulls off as an angry young Dane. Christopher Carter Sanderson, the director, shows that the play's the thing, indoors or out (3:00). Roy Arias Theater Center at Times Square Arts Center, 300 West 43rd Street, Clinton; closes on Tuesday. (Midgette) 'MEMORY' Jonathan Lichtenstein's play is an engrossing but overcomplicated backstage story that gradually bleeds into a tale of a Holocaust survivor facing up to painful memories. And there's a side plot about a Palestinian losing his home. In any case, superb acting holds the attention in this mainstage entry in the Brits Off Broadway festival (1:30). 59E59 Theaters, 59 East 59th Street, (212) 279-4200; closes on Sunday. (Isherwood) 'MOON ON A RAINBOW SHAWL' This is a lyrical example of kitchen-sink realism, a slice of life about neighbors who live around a crowded, cacophonous yard in Port of Spain, Trinidad. Written by Errol John and first produced in 1958, it deserves to be better known. This small, committed production, directed by Shirley Parkinson Wright, with outstanding performances by Lola Loui and Erwin E. A. Thomas, is infused with a love and understanding of the material (2:00 ). Henry Street Settlement's Abrons Arts Center/Recital Hall, 466 Grand Street, at Pitt Street, Lower East Side, (212) 353-1176; closes on Sunday. (Rachel Saltz) 'OF MICE AND MEN' The 70th-anniversary production of John Steinbeck's classic of two Depression-era ranch hands feels as stylized as an after-school special and just oversimplified. The actors work hard but their efforts fall short. (2:15) Urban Stages, 259 West 30th Street, (212) 868-4444; closes on Sunday. (Bellafante) 'THE RECeiPT' A lost bar receipt provides a one-way ticket to bedlam in a clever and diverting show that mirrors the idiosyncrasies of modern life as two young archaeologists study a ''lost'' city and postulate on a day in the life of one of its inhabitants (1:15). 59E59 Theaters, 59 East 59th Street, (212) 279-4200; closes on Sunday. (Wilborn Hampton) Movies Ratings and running times are in parentheses; foreign films have English subtitles. Full reviews of all current releases, movie trailers, show times and tickets: nytimes.com/movies. * 'AWAY FROM HER' (PG-13, 110 minutes) Sarah Polley's well-observed adaptation of a story by Alice Munro is a quiet tour de force about love and loss, anchored by fine performances by Gordon Pinsent and Julie Christie as a couple dealing with the loss of memory and memories of past hurt. (A. O. Scott) 'Blades of Glory' (PG-13, 93 minutes) In this fast, light, frequently funny comedy about a male figure-skating team, Will Ferrell and Jon Heder stake an early claim to being the comedy couple of the year. (Stephen Holden) * 'BRAND UPON THE BRAIN' (No rating, 96 minutes) A baroque entertainment with one foot in silent cinema and the other gingerly toeing the sound waves, Guy Maddin's latest centers on a man who, in visiting a now-emptied foundling home, journeys deep into his childhood. It's wild! It's weird! It's strangely touching and a total must-see! (Manohla Dargis) 'BROOKLYN RULES' (R, 99 minutes) However authentic and heartfelt the film's depiction of life on the meaner streets of the Northeast corridor may be, this story of three friends growing up in a mob-infested Brooklyn neighborhood doesn't begin to match ''The Sopranos'' in its epic vision of violence, class struggle and upward mobility in a barbarous culture. (Holden) * 'DAY NIGHT DAY NIGHT' (No rating, 94 minutes) For most of its 94 minutes, this gripping but evasive portrait of an unidentified 19-year-old terrorist undertaking a suicide bombing mission in Times Square focuses on the face of its star, Luisa Williams. (Holden) 'DISTURBIA' (PG-13, 104 minutes) A pleasant, scary, well-directed variation on the killer-next-door theme, with the engaging Shia LeBeouf as Kale, a young man who turns house arrest into an occasion for voyeurism and crime-fighting. (Scott) 'EVEN MONEY' (R, 108 minutes) This grim, lurid scare movie about gambling addiction consists of several interlocking horror stories that converge in a format similar to that of ''Crash.'' More than its forerunner, this film sacrifices realism to forced plot mechanics. (Holden) 'THE EX' (PG-13, 89 minutes) The best jokes in this scattershot screwball satire -- about the cutthroat workplace, job insecurity, upward mobility, political correctness, yuppie marital tensions and the disabled -- have claws that leave scratches. (Holden) 'FAY GRIM' (R, 118 minutes) Too light-headed to qualify as satire, too poker-faced to register as comedy, this elaborate spy spoof, a sequel to ''Henry Fool,'' belongs in its own stylistic niche: the Hal Hartley film. Movies emanating from Planet Hartley are an acquired taste shared by hipper-than-thou insiders. (Holden) 'FLANDERS' (No rating, 91 minutes, in French) Whether you like or loathe the movies of the French director Bruno Dumont, his unsettling vision of humanity stripped of cultural finery feels profoundly truthful. Beneath the facade of civilization, life is a barnyard. (Holden) 'FRACTURE' (R, 111 minutes) A glib entertainment that offers up the spectacle of that crafty scene-stealer Anthony Hopkins mixing it up with that equally cunning screen-nibbler Ryan Gosling. (Dargis) 'GEORGIA RULE' (R, 111 minutes) Jane Fonda, Felicity Huffman and Lindsay Lohan play three generations of strong-willed, dysfunctional women in this comedy-melodrama from Garry Marshall. It's a mess, but it does have some vitality, thanks mainly to Ms. Fonda and Ms. Lohan. (Scott) 'GRINDHOUSE' (R, 180 minutes) A double feature, complete with fake previews for schlocky exploitation pictures, that pays nostalgic tribute to disreputable traditions of moviemaking and moviegoing. Robert Rodriguez contributes ''Planet Terror,'' a purposely incoherent zombie gross-out flick that flaunts is own badness the way Rose McGowan (as a go-go dancer named Cherry Darling) shows off her weaponized prosthetic leg. For his part, Quentin Tarantino, more of a connoisseur than his collaborator (and a much better filmmaker), turns out a brutal, talky and satisfying car-chase revenge movie in ''Death Proof,'' starring Kurt Russell. (Scott) * 'THE HOAX' (R, 115 minutes) A first-rate performance by Richard Gere drives this true story of Clifford Irving (Mr. Gere), who claimed to be the authorized biographer of Howard Hughes. Shadowed by the paranoia of its period (the early '70s), this movie, crisply directed by Lasse Hallstrom from an excellent script by William Weaver, is less a morality play than an entertaining portrait of a literary gambler. (Scott) * 'HOT FUZZ' (R, 121 minutes) A British parody of Hollywood-style action flicks from the wits behind ''Shaun of the Dead.'' Think of it as ''The Full Monty'' blown to smithereens. (Dargis) 'I DON'T WANT TO SLEEP ALONE' (No rating, 115 minutes, in Taiwanese, Malay, Mandarin and Bengali) A dreamy, melancholy tale of three-way desire, shot in Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia, and imagined by the director Tsai Ming-Liang with his usual blend of sensuality and formal rigor. (Scott) 'THE INVISIBLE' (PG-13, 102 minutes) This supremely silly retread of the 2002 Swedish film ''Den Osynlige'' proves it's tough to be in love and in limbo at one and the same time. When a rich-yet-troubled teenager (Justin Chatwin) crosses paths with a violently disturbed classmate (Margarita Levieva), we learn that there's nothing quite like a near-death experience to repair those stubborn emotional wounds. (Jeannette Catsoulis) * 'KILLER OF SHEEP' (No rating, 83 minutes) Largely hidden from view for three decades, Charles Burnett's lyrical film about a working-class family living in a broken-down home in a bombed-out stretch of Los Angeles is an American masterpiece. (Dargis) 'NEXT' (PG-13, 96 minutes) Nicolas Cage plays a guy who can see into the future in this crummy adaptation of a nifty Philip K. Dick story. Too bad Mr. Cage couldn't tap into those same powers to save himself from another bad role. (Dargis) * 'ONCE' (R, 88 minutes) A modest, scruffy movie about two musicians who meet on a Dublin street and sort of fall in love. Charming, touching and true. (Scott) 'PARIS JE T'AIME' (R, 120 minutes, in French and English) ''Paris Je T'Aime,'' a mosaic of 18 miniatures, each set in a different location in the City of Light, is a cinematic tasting menu consisting entirely of amuse-bouches. After two hours of such tidbits, the palate is sated. But if there is no need for a main course, you still leave feeling vaguely disappointed at not being served one. (Holden) 'PIRATES OF THE CARIBBEAN: AT WORLD'S END' (PG-13, 167 minutes) This third and perhaps final episode in Gore Verbinski's swishy, swashbuckling saga wisely returns to the high-seas high jinx that made the first film so enjoyable. In service to a typically convoluted plot -- involving British perfidy, pieces of eight and a Godzilla-size sorceress -- all the usual suspects return to lie, swindle and marvel at Keith Richards's longevity, if not his line delivery. Jack Sparrow hallucinates, Barbossa agitates, and Elizabeth Swann is elected Pirate King. Really. Mr. Verbinski knows who wears the trousers in his trilogy. (Catsoulis) 'PERFECT STRANGER' (R, 109 minutes) There is enough of a grain of truth in this noirish, paranoid thriller set in the New York media world that even after it lurches from the farfetched into the preposterous, the movie leaves a clammy residue of unease. (Holden) 'PROVOKED' (No rating, 113 minutes) Holding fast to the movie-of-the-week formula perfected by Lifetime Television, Jag Mundhra's overly restrained drama is based on the true story of Kiranjit Ahluwalia, a London-based Punjabi housewife who torched her sleeping husband in 1989 after suffering a decade of abuse. Unfortunately, by keeping its inflammatory subject matter at arm's length, ''Provoked'' does exactly the same to its audience. (Catsoulis) 'SEVERANCE' (R, 90 minutes) A weapons company retreat in a Hungarian forest turns into a bloody game of whack-a-mole in this sophomore horror film from the British director Christopher Smith. The political argument may be broad -- there is some satisfaction in seeing the gung-ho team leader hoisted by his own explosive petard -- but the visual technique is sharp, creating a lively romp through terrain less traveled than you might think. (Catsoulis) 'SHREK THE THIRD' (PG, 93 minutes) The ogre faces impending fatherhood and a career crisis. (Scott) 'SHOWBUSINESS' (PG, 102 minutes) This documentary by Dori Bernstein follows four Broadway musicals from rehearsal through the 2004 Tony Awards: ''Caroline, or Change''; ''Taboo''; ''Avenue Q''; and ''Wicked.'' On top of the usual challenges (fund-raising, rewrites, tryouts, marketing), they all had to endure scrutiny by theater critics and gossip columnists. Lively, sometimes cutting but mostly humane, ''ShowBusiness'' is packed with telling details. (Matt Zoller Seitz) 'SPIDER-MAN 3' (PG-13, 139 minutes) Please, God, make this be the last one. (Dargis) 'TA RA RUM PUM' (No rating, 156 minutes, in English and Hindi) This movie about a race car driver (the versatile Saif Ali Khan) takes place in New York, but that doesn't stop it from being a classic example of Bollywood family values. Here, all the city's a stage set, perfect for ''Fame''-meets-''West Side Story'' production numbers. (Rachel Saltz) '300' (R, 116 minutes) Greeks versus Persians in the big rumble at Thermopylae, via Frank Miller's graphic novel. As dumb as they get. (Scott) * 28 WEEKS LATER' (R, 91 minutes) The virus that killed off most of England -- after turning its population into rabid, flesh-hungry zombies -- seems to be under control at the start of this terrifying sequel to ''28 Days Later.'' But if anything, the horror is deeper, and the social criticism more acute. (Scott) 'VACANCY' (R, 80 minutes) This banal horror retread involves a couple of critters (Luke Wilson, Kate Beckinsale) flailing inside a sticky trap for what is, in effect, the big-screen equivalent of a roach motel. (Dargis) * 'THE VALET' (PG-13, 85 minutes, in French) If you love to hate the superrich, this delectable comedy, in which the great French actor Daniel Auteuil portrays a piggy billionaire industrialist facing his comeuppance, is a sinfully delicious bonbon, a classic French farce with modern touches. (Holden) * 'WAITRESS' (PG-13, 104 minutes) Keri Russell is a small-town waitress in a bad marriage who finds solace in pie-baking and adultery in Adrienne Shelly's wry and winning final feature. (Scott) 'THE WENDELL BAKER STORY' (PG-13, 99 minutes) This goofy slacker comedy is a Wilson family affair. Written by Luke Wilson, who co-directed with his older brother, Andrew, it also stars Owen Wilson as the title character's nemesis. Its appeal depends on how charming you find the Wilson brothers with their hip, smart-aleck attitude. (Holden) * 'YEAR OF THE DOG' (PG-13, 97 minutes) Mike White's touching comedy about a woman who loses a dog and finds herself is funny ha-ha but firmly in touch with its downer side, which means that it's also funny in a kind of existential way. Molly Shannon stars alongside a menagerie of howling scene-stealers. (Dargis) 'ZOO' (No rating, 76 minutes) Robinson Devor's heavily reconstructed documentary is, to a large extent, about the rhetorical uses of beauty. It is, rather more coyly, also about a man who died after having sex with a stallion. (Dargis) Film Series SAM FULLER (Tomorrow and Sunday) The Museum of the Moving Image's continuing retrospective devoted to the blunt, visceral work of the tabloid reporter turned filmmaker Sam Fuller turns this weekend to his increasingly stylized work of the late 1950s. Included are rare archival prints of ''China Gate'' (1957), Fuller's anticipation of American involvement in Vietnam, starring Gene Barry and, in her first leading role, Angie Dickinson as a Eurasian lady of the evening; ''Run of the Arrow,'' a political western about a Confederate soldier (Rod Steiger) who learns about racism when he joins a Sioux tribe rather than surrender to the Union Army; and the eternally astonishing ''Forty Guns,'' a mad western in black-and-white CinemaScope, with Barbara Stanwyck as a ruthless land baroness. The sight of Stanwyck leading her private army -- the 40 guns of the title -- as they charge across an open plain is an unforgettable image. Museum of the Moving Image, 35th Avenue at 36th Street, Astoria, Queens, (718) 784-0077, movingimage.us; $10. (Dave Kehr) BARRY LYNDON (Sunday through Tuesday) The Walter Reade Theater at Lincoln Center has landed a new 35-millimeter copy of Stanley Kubrick's 1975 historical drama, printed under the supervision of Kubrick's former assistant Leon Vitali. Ryan O'Neal stars as a devious but strangely dimwitted Irishman who climbs into the bed of a wealthy widow (Marisa Berenson) and up the ladder of 18th-century English society. The distant, painterly film -- you remember the candlelight more than the characters -- will be introduced by Mr. Vitali at three of the six scheduled screenings. Walter Reade Theater, 165 West 65th Street, (212) 875-5600, filmlinc.org; $11. (Kehr) THIRTY YEARS OF DANCE AFRICA (Today through Wednesday) As part of the Brooklyn Academy of Music's multimedia celebration of the DanceAfrica festival, the BAMcinématek is screening a well-chosen group of recent films with African themes. Running all week except Tuesday is ''Kirikou and the Wild Beasts'' (2006), Michel Ocelot's sequel to ''Kirikou and the Sorceress'' (1998), his popular animated film based on a West African folktale. The weekend highlights include Dumisani Phakathi's documentary about his search for his family in South Africa (tonight); ''The Night of Truth'' (2004), a drama by Fanta Régina Nacro about the social collapse of an imaginary West African country (tomorrow); and Mehdi Charef's ''Daughter of Keltoum'' (2001) a trip into the Berber region of Algeria (Sunday). BAMcinématek, BAM Rose Cinemas, 30 Lafayette Avenue, at Ashland Place, Fort Greene, Brooklyn, (718) 636-4100, bam.org; $10. (Kehr) Pop Full reviews of recent concerts: nytimes.com/music. DAN BERN (Tonight) With a nasal sing-speak that recalls the young Bob Dylan, Mr. Bern offers smooth folk-rock and a world-weary cynicism. (''There's nothing innocent about a newborn babe,'' he sings, ''that a few years here can't cure.'') At 7:30, Maxwell's, 1039 Washington Street, Hoboken, N.J., (201) 653-1703, maxwellsnj.com; $16. (Ben Sisario) BLACK REBEL MOTORCYCLE CLUB (Thursday) Not a Motorhead copycat, as its name would imply, but rather a dutiful and listless revivalist of the haystack hairdos and slithery gloom-rock of 1980s and early-'90s British bands like the Jesus and Mary Chain and Love and Rockets. Motorhead would be more exciting. With the Cobbs. At 7 p.m., Webster Hall, 125 East 11th Street, East Village, (212) 533-2111, bowerypresents.com; sold out. (Sisario) * BRAND NEW (Sunday and Tuesday) Not all emo goes the way of smirky punk-pop or sentimental singalongs. This excellent Long Island band plies dense, angry tangles of guitar and opaque lyrics of spiritual crisis, a cross between the grandeur of Pink Floyd and the agonized outbursts of Nirvana. With Anathallo and Colour Revolt. Sunday at 6 p.m., Bowery Ballroom, 6 Delancey Street, near the Bowery, Lower East Side, (212) 533-2111, boweryballroom.com; Tuesday at 7:30 p.m., Blender Theater at Gramercy, 127 East 23rd Street, Manhattan, (212) 307-7171; both sold out. (Sisario) * BRIGHT EYES, GILLIAN WELCH (Tonight and tomorrow night, and Monday through Thursday) In the indie-rock equivalent of Bruce Springsteen filling up Giants Stadium for weeks on end, Bright Eyes -- consisting of the painfully, excessively confessional man-child Conor Oberst and whomever he's playing with -- has sold out seven shows at Town Hall, beginning tonight. His guest is Gillian Welch, who plays a mellow bluegrass-folk hybrid with grace. At 7:30, 123 West 43rd Street, Manhattan, (212) 307-7171, the-townhall-nyc.org. (Sisario) THE BRAVERY (Tuesday and Wednesday) Disco first met punk in Britain in the late '70s, but they have had quite a romance in turn-of-the-21st-century New York. The Bravery arrived a few years ago with catchy, radio-ready songs and buckets of hair gel; the band has been compared, accurately, to the Strokes, New Order, U2 and Franz Ferdinand. With the Photo Atlas and the Cinematics. At 9 p.m., Fillmore New York at Irving Plaza, 17 Irving Place, at 15th Street, Manhattan, (212) 777-6800; $20. (Sisario) BARBARA CARROLL (Sunday and Monday) Elegant, witty and touching, this classically trained jazz pianist and singer, now 82, is in her prime: the female counterpart of Bobby Short. Sunday at 2 p.m., Monday at 8 p.m., Oak Room at the Algonquin Hotel, 59 West 44th Street, Manhattan, (212) 419-9331, algonquinhotel.com; $58 on Sunday, with brunch at noon; $40 on Monday, with a $20 minimum. (Stephen Holden) COMAS (Tomorrow and Thursday) This Brooklyn band pushes garage-rock into a soulful psychedelia. Fans used to comb Andy Herod's lyrics for not-so-veiled references to his breakup with the actress Michelle Williams. He's still smarting about heartbreak on the band's new album, ''Spells'' (Vagrant), but the objects of his longing are a little more obscure -- what does ''telepathic aftertaste'' mean, for example, and is it good or bad if your girlfriend has it? With the Broken West and Nethers. Tomorrow at 9:30 p.m., Mercury Lounge, 217 East Houston Street, at Ludlow Street, Lower East Side, (212) 260-4700, mercuryloungenyc.com; $12. Thursday at 8:30 p.m., Maxwell's, 1039 Washington Street, Hoboken, N.J., (201) 653-1703, maxwellsnj.com; $10. (Sisario) DICK DALE (Sunday) Dick Dale, king of the surf guitar, provides no polite nostalgia trip to the mid-1960s. He's out to summon elemental forces with the stomping beat of his band and his heavily reverbed, brusquely attacked guitar lines, along with the dive-bombing, tremolo glissandos that literally melt his guitar picks from the heat of their friction on the strings. At 8 p.m., B. B. King Blues Club & Grill, 237 West 42nd Street, Manhattan, (212) 997-4144, bbkingblues.com; $20 in advance, $25.50 at the door. (Jon Pareles) DEAD INFECTION, MORTICIAN (Today) Dead Infection, a veteran Polish grindcore band on its first United States tour, dispensed long ago with the problem of finding the appropriate lyrics for its high-speed, guttural churn of guitars; the vocals are simply deep, wordless growls -- a sort of universal language of metal. Mortician, from Yonkers, has only two members, but with its indistinct rumble and relentless drum blasts, it sounds like an invading alien army. With Regurgitate and Malignancy. At 5 p.m., Europa, 98 Meserole Avenue, at Manhattan Avenue, Greenpoint, Brooklyn, (718) 383-2322, europaclub.com; $20. (Sisario) MOS DEF (Tomorrow) Though Hollywood jobs take up most of his time these days, Mos Def, once the great, socially conscious hope of New York hip-hop, has never walked away from his calling as a rapper. When he's not feeling sluggish or preoccupied -- or simply bored, as he says on his latest album, ''True Magic'' (Geffen) -- he is a passionately literate and polemical performer. At 9 p.m., Highline Ballroom, 431 West 16th Street, Chelsea, (212) 414-5994, highlineballroom.com; $60. (Sisario) DIRTY DOZEN BRASS BAND (Wednesday) The magnificent ensemble that revitalized New Orleans brass-band music. It swaggers through the city's whole musical heritage: parades, rumba, swing, bebop and modern jazz, for starters. Solos can head for the far side of tonality, but the band never loses touch with gutbucket, danceable funk. At 8 p.m., B. B. King Blues Club & Grill, 243 West 42nd Street, Manhattan, (212) 997-4144, bbkingblues.com; $16 in advance, $19 at the door. (Pareles) EARTH, WIND AND FIRE (Tuesday) In its 1970s heyday, Earth, Wind and Fire was the glossy, horn-powered hit machine that covered all bases, from idealism (''Keep Your Head to the Sky,'' ''Shining Star'') to dance tunes (''Boogie Wonderland'') to lovers' pleas (''Reasons''). At 8 p.m., Beacon Theater, 2124 Broadway, at 74th Street, (212) 307-7171, beacontheatrenyc.com; sold out. (Pareles) KEANE (Wednesday) This British band consists of just a drummer, a singer and an awfully hard-working keyboardist, but manages to flesh out beautifully melodramatic songs of yearning and self-pity with rich sonorities and sharp hooks that make you swear that there's a guitar in there somewhere. With Rocco Deluca and the Burden. At 5:30 p.m., Rumsey Playfield, Central Park, midpark at 70th Street, (212) 307-7171; sold out. (Sisario) KIKI AND HERB (Sunday) A few years ago this brilliantly perverse cabaret duo played their farewell show at Carnegie Hall. Then came a run on Broadway. And some late-night gigs at Joe's Pub. And the inimitable Christmas show. (Highlight: a medley of ''Smells Like Teen Spirit'' and ''Frosty the Snowman.'') Kiki and Herb can't stay away from the stage, and New York is the better for it. At 11:30 p.m., Joe's Pub, 425 Lafayette Street, at Astor Place, East Village, (212) 967-7555, joespub.com; $20. (Sisario) LIFESAVAS (Tonight) There are plenty of criminals and scofflaws on ''Gutterfly'' (Quannum Projects), the excellent new concept album -- a funk-drenched soundtrack to an imaginary blackxploitation movie from the 1970s -- by this underground hip-hop trio from Portland, Ore. (The group really went the distance with it: George Clinton makes an appearance.) But the twist here is that the gangsters and dealers are the bad guys, and the Lifesavas play the law enforcers, fighting crime with style on the streets of ''Razorblade City.'' With Strange Fruit Project. At 8, Southpaw, 125 Fifth Avenue, near Sterling Place, Park Slope, Brooklyn, (718) 230-0236, spsounds.com; $12. (Sisario) * LIGHTNING BOLT, DMBQ, BIG A LITTLE A, APES (Tomorrow) At first it's hard to believe that all the glorious chaos of Lightning Bolt, from Providence, R.I., is being made by only two people. But as the sound comes into focus, a playful give-and-take becomes clear, as the bassist Brian Gibson and the drummer and vocalist Brian Chippendale toss back and forth gigantic metal riffs and giggly high notes, creating rainbows of dissonance. In the latest of several recent New York gigs, Lightning Bolt plays with the Japanese '70s-metal revivalists DMBQ; the passionately clamorous local experimenters Big A Little A; and the Apes, from Washington, whose spooky, keyboard-driven grooves quickly turn violent. At 8 p.m., 600 Bushwick Avenue, at Jefferson Street, Bushwick, Brooklyn, toddpnyc.com; $10. (Sisario) MEMPHIS (Wednesday and Thursday) Fans of Stars, the superbly urbane indie-cabaret band from Toronto, have been waiting three long years for a new album. (Its new remix disc is cold comfort.) Torquil Campbell, one of its singers and the band's resident wit, helps tide followers over with Memphis, his side project with Chris Dumont. The delicate melodies and cool dissection of heartbreak on Memphis's latest album, ''A Little Place in the Wilderness'' (Good Fences), are vaguely Stars-y, but it only makes the wait that much harder. Wednesday at 9:30 p.m., Joe's Pub, at the Public Theater, 425 Lafayette Street, at Astor Place, East Village, (212) 967-7555, joespub.com; $15. Thursday at 8 p.m., with Mascott and Jade McNelis, at Union Hall, 702 Union Street, at Fifth Avenue, Park Slope, Brooklyn, (718) 638-4400, unionhallny.com; $15. (Sisario) * THE NATIONAL (Monday through Thursday) This Brooklyn group has become an under-the-radar local hit with flawless, wilting ballads featuring subtly inventive guitar playing by Bryce Dessner and the weary, cynical baritone of Matt Berninger, who seems pained by his ability to conjure cruelties like ''You could have been a legend/But you became a father.'' These first four shows of a five-night sold-out run also feature the Broken West (Monday), Doveman (Tuesday), My Brightest Diamond (Wednesday) and Elysian Fields (Thursday). At 8 p.m., Bowery Ballroom, 6 Delancey Street, near the Bowery, Lower East Side, (212) 533-2111, boweryballroom.com. (Sisario) JENNIFER O'CONNOR (Wednesday) Ms. O'Connor's portraits of the lovelorn and depressed, sung with the guileless vulnerability of a 2 a.m. phone confession, are dry but not unsympathetic: ''Maybe she's on her lunch break thinking of you.'' She has a Wednesday residency this month at the Living Room. At 11 p.m., 154 Ludlow Street, near Stanton Street, Lower East Side, (212) 533-7235, livingroomny.com; $8. (Sisario) * JOHN PIZZARELLI AND JESSICA MOLASKEY (Tonight and tomorrow night) These married musicians have been called ''the Nick and Nora of cabaret,'' a sobriquet that only begins to describe their upbeat sophistication. They fuse two distantly related musical worlds into a larger whole in which Stephen Sondheim, Dave Frishberg, Paul Simon, and Lambert, Hendricks and Ross join hands. At 8:45 and 10:45, Café Carlyle, at the Carlyle Hotel, 35 East 76th Street, Manhattan, (212) 744-1600, thecarlyle.com; $85. (Holden) T-PAIN (Thursday) The former Faheem Najm of Tallahassee, Fla., offered a concise résumé in the title of his 2005 debut album: ''Rappa Ternt Sanga.'' He broke big with the equally self-descriptive ''I'm N Luv (Wit a Stripper),'' but on his new album he confesses that he doesn't mind being domesticated by the right woman. ''She got me doin' the dishes,'' he sings. ''Anything she want for some kisses.'' Aww. At 8 p.m., S.O.B.'s, 204 Varick Street, at Houston Street, South Village, (212) 243-4940, sobs.com; $25 in advance, $30 at the door. (Sisario) ROGER WATERS (Wednesday) Calling himself with characteristic modesty ''the creative genius of Pink Floyd,'' Mr. Waters continues his extensive tour performing ''The Dark Side of the Moon,'' his former band's epochal 1973 concept album about insanity. At 8 p.m., Madison Square Garden, (212) 465-6741, thegarden.com; $39 to $174.50. (Sisario) !!! (Wednesday) Punk-funk usually leans on the punk side, with short blasts of indignation or defiance filtered through dance beats. This local eight-piece (whose name is pronounced ''chik-chik-chik,'' or, they say, however you want) goes for immersion, transcendence and kicks through long and steady workouts of aggressive disco-rock, making each groove last until it burns up or falls apart. With Maserati and Telepathe. At 8 p.m., Studio B, 259 Banker Street, between Meserole Avenue and Calyer Street, Greenpoint, Brooklyn, (718) 389-1880, clubstudiob.com; $16. (Sisario) Jazz Full reviews of recent jazz concerts: nytimes.com/music. THEO BLECKMAN AND BEN MONDER (Tuesday) Mr. Bleckman, a vocalist, and Mr. Monder, a guitarist, share a fondness for diaphanous atmosphere, as they demonstrate on ''At Night'' (Songlines), their mysterious new album. At 10 p.m., Bowery Poetry Club, 308 Bowery, near Bleecker Street, East Village, (212) 614-0505, bowerypoetry.com; cover, $8. (Nate Chinen) REGINA CARTER (Wednesday and Thursday) Ms. Carter, a recent MacArthur fellow, is one of jazz's top violinists, equally at home with burnished romanticism and hard-driving swing. (Through June 2.) At 9 and 11 p.m., Birdland, 315 West 44th Street, Clinton, (212) 581-3080, birdlandjazz.com; cover, $30, with a $10 minimum. (Chinen) BILL CHARLAP TRIO (Tonight through Sunday, and Tuesday through Thursday) The new Blue Note album by this standard-bearing trio is called ''Live at the Village Vanguard,'' but here they hold court elsewhere. As always, the pianist Bill Charlap enjoys crisp support from Peter Washington on bass and Kenny Washington on drums. (Through June 3.) At 7:30 and 9:30, with an 11:30 set tonight and tomorrow night, Dizzy's Club Coca-Cola, Frederick P. Rose Hall, Jazz at Lincoln Center, 60th Street and Broadway, (212) 258-9595, jalc.org; cover, $30, with a minimum of $10 at tables, $5 at the bar. (Chinen) CARLA COOK (Tonight and tomorrow night) Ms. Cook is a confident and vivacious jazz singer with a growing book of original tunes. At 9 and 11, Sweet Rhythm, 88 Seventh Avenue South, at Bleecker Street, West Village, (212) 255-3626, sweetrhythmny.com; cover, $25, with a $10 minimum. (Chinen) AL FOSTER QUARTET WITH WALLACE RONEY (Tonight and tomorrow night) This two-night stand, which bears the subtitle ''A Tribute to Miles,'' commemorates the fact that Al Foster was once the drummer with Miles Davis, and Wallace Roney was once Davis's anointed heir. At 8, 10 and 11:30, Smoke, 2751 Broadway, at 106th Street, (212) 864-6662, smokejazz.com; cover, $28. (Chinen) DIZZY GILLESPIE ALL-STAR BIG BAND (Tonight through Sunday night) Dizzy Gillespie, Bebop's goateed ambassador, did some of his best work with big bands, a fact that this one, led by his former trombonist Slide Hampton, happily exploits. The band includes other veterans of Gillespie's employ, like the saxophonists James Moody and Jimmy Heath. The trumpeter Roy Hargrove is a fine choice to fill Gillespie's shoes. At 8 and 10:30, Blue Note, 131 West Third Street, West Village, (212) 475-8592, bluenote.net; cover, $35 at tables, $20 at the bar, with a $5 minimum. (Chinen) * BILLY HART QUARTET (Tuesday through Thursday) Revisiting the assertive post-bop of his recent album ''Quartet'' (High Note), the drummer Billy Hart fronts a dream team of younger players: the tenor saxophonist Mark Turner, the pianist Ethan Iverson and the bassist Ben Street. (Through June 3.) At 9 and 11 p.m., Village Vanguard, 178 Seventh Avenue South, at 11th Street, West Village, (212) 255-4037, villagevanguard.com; cover, $20 to $25, with a $10 minimum. (Chinen) ARI HOENIG (Tonight and Monday night) Mr. Hoenig, an irrepressibly kinetic drummer, recently issued ''Inversations'' (Dreyfus), an album that proves his adroitness as a composer while confirming his rapport with the pianist Jean-Michel Pilc. On Monday he plays in a trio with Mr. Pilc; tonight he communes with Joel Frahm on tenor saxophone, Orlando Le Fleming on bass and Gilad Hekselman on guitar. At 9 and 10:30, Smalls, 183 West 10th Street, West Village, (212) 675-7369, smallsjazzclub.com; cover, $20. (Chinen) * BOBBY HUTCHERSON QUINTET (Tuesday through Thursday) Bobby Hutcherson has been the chief proponent of a harmonically restless post-bop vibraphone style for some 40 years. Celebrating the release of a quiet new album, ''For Sentimental Reasons'' (Kind of Blue), he leads a blue-chip rhythm section composed of Russell Malone on guitar, Renee Rosnes on piano, Dwayne Burno on bass and Al Foster on drums. (Through June 3.) At 8 and 10:30 p.m., Blue Note, 131 West Third Street, West Village, (212) 475-8592, bluenote.net; cover, $35 at tables, $20 at the bar, with a $5 minimum.

Rose Hall, Jazz at Lincoln Center, 60th Street and Broadway, (212) 258-9595, jalc.org; cover, $15, with a minimum of $10 at tables, $5 at the bar. (Chinen) JEF LEE JOHNSON BAND/ROB REDDY TRIO (Tonight) Groove is the common denominator of these two progressive trios, the first led by the guitarist and vocalist Jef Lee Johnson, and the second organized by Rob Reddy, a saxophonist. At 9, Jalopy Theater, 315 Columbia Street, Brooklyn, (718) 395-3214, jalopy.biz; $10. (Chinen) LEE KONITZ AND DAN TEPFER (Tonight and tomorrow night) Mr. Konitz, who will turn 80 this year, applies his dry-martini alto saxophone tone to a round of duets with Mr. Tepfer, a pianist now in his mid-20s. At 9 and 10:30, Jazz Gallery, 290 Hudson Street, at Spring Street, South Village, (212) 242-1063, jazzgallery.org; cover, $20.

He now presides over an edition of the group featuring the saxophonist Bill Evans, the guitarist Mike Stern, the bassist Anthony Jackson and the drummer Steve Smith. (Through June 2.)

At 9 and 10:30 p.m., Cornelia Street Café, 29 Cornelia Street, West Village, (212) 989-9319, corneliastreetcafe.com; cover, $10, with a one-drink minimum. (Chinen) * WYNTON MARSALIS SEPTET (Tonight and tomorrow night) Fifteen years ago Wynton Marsalis closed the Jazz at Lincoln Center concert season with ''In This House, on This Morning,'' an original commission thematically linked to the customs of the gospel church. Now Mr. Marsalis ends the current season by calling upon some of the same musicians, including the trombonist Wycliffe Gordon and the drummer Herlin Riley, to reinterpret that evocative work. At 8, Frederick P. Rose Hall, Jazz at Lincoln Center, 60th Street and Broadway, (212) 721-6500, jalc.org; $37.50 to $127.50. (Chinen) JOE MARTIN QUARTET (Thursday) Joe Martin, a versatile bassist and a thoughtful composer, leads a post-bop band with John Ellis on saxophones, Aaron Parks on piano and Obed Calvaire on drums. At 9 and 10:30 p.m., Jazz Gallery, 290 Hudson Street, at Spring Street, South Village, (212) 242-1063, jazzgallery.org; cover, $12. (Chinen) DONNY MCCASLIN TRIO (Tuesday) Latin rhythms have become an increasingly prominent concern for the tenor saxophonist Donny McCaslin, who seems likely to take a strenuous approach in this pared-down setting, with Thomas Morgan on bass and Richie Barshay on drums. At 9 p.m. and midnight, Louis 649, 649 East Ninth Street, at Avenue C, East Village, (212) 673-1190, louis649.com; no cover. (Chinen) BEN MONDER (Thursday) In the hands of Mr. Monder the electric guitar is a coloristic instrument. He features his coolly convoluted pieces for a trio with Chris Lightcap on bass and Ted Poor drums. At 10 p.m., Barbès, 376 Ninth Street, at Sixth Avenue, Park Slope, Brooklyn, (718) 965-9177, barbesbrooklyn.com; cover, $10.

The schedule also includes Attack/Adorn/Decay, a project of the trumpeter Nate Wooley (tonight at 10); Heavy Merge, a trio led by the pianist Russ Lossing (tomorrow night at 8:30); and the Indo-Pak Coalition, assembled by the alto saxophonist Rudresh Mahanthappa (Thursday night at 8:30). At 8:30, 10 and 11:30 p.m., Rose Live Music, 345 Grand Street, near Marcy Avenue, Williamsburg, (646) 644-2766, newlanguages.org; $10. (Chinen) PLAYDATE (Wednesday) The guitarist Amanda Monaco and the pianist Noah Baerman are the core of this whimsically named ensemble, which also includes the bassist Henry Lugo and the drummer Vinnie Sperrazza, along with Steve Wilson, a special guest, on alto saxophone. At 8:30 p.m., Cornelia Street Café, 29 Cornelia Street, West Village, (212) 989-9319, corneliastreetcafe.com; cover, $15, with a one-drink minimum. (Chinen) TODD SICKAFOOSE'S BLOOD ORANGE (Tonight) A bassist and composer equally fond of rough edges and rounded forms, Todd Sickafoose performs here with two guitarists (Adam Levy and Mike Gamble), two drummers (Allison Miller and Simon Lott) and a frontline of Shane Endsley on trumpet, Ben Wendel on saxophones and Alan Ferber on trombone. At 9 and 10, Tea Lounge, 837 Union Street, between Sixth and Seventh Avenues, Park Slope, Brooklyn, (718) 789-2762, tealoungeny.com; no cover. (Chinen) DR. LONNIE SMITH TRIO (Tuesday through Thursday) Under the command of Dr. Lonnie Smith, the Hammond B-3 organ can be subtly atmospheric or growlingly ecstatic; together with the guitarist Peter Bernstein and the drummer Anthony Pinciotti, he makes a searching brand of soul jazz. (Through June 3.) At 7:30, 9:30 and 11:30 p.m., Jazz Standard, 116 East 27th Street, Manhattan, (212) 576-2232, jazzstandard.net; cover, $20 to $25. (Chinen) MIKE STERN BAND (Monday and Wednesday) The guitarist Mike Stern has a goofily titled but musically rewarding recent album, ''Who Let the Cats Out?'' (Heads Up), that only begins to capture the energy of this longstanding regular engagement. At 10 p.m., 55 Bar, 55 Christopher Street, near Seventh Avenue South, West Village, (212) 929-9883, 55bar.com; cover, $10. (Chinen) PETER VAN HUFFEL QUINTET (Sunday and Thursday) On his new release, ''Silvester Battlefield'' (Fresh Sound New Talent), the saxophonist Peter Van Huffel showcases his exploratory compositions for this working band with the pianist Jesse Stacken, the guitarist Scott DuBois, the bassist Michael Bates and the drummer Jeff Davis.

(Chinen) * JEFF (TAIN) WATTS QUARTET (Tomorrow and Sunday) Jeff (Tain) Watts, an ingeniously propulsive drummer, has a new album, ''Folk Songs'' (Dark Key Music), that consists almost entirely of his own sturdy tunes. The tenor saxophonist Marcus Strickland and the pianist David Kikowski are both featured on the album; the bassist James Genus fills in here for Christian McBride. At 8:30 and 10:30 p.m., Iridium, 1650 Broadway, at 51st Street, (212) 582-2121, iridiumjazzclub.com; cover, $30, with a $10 minimum. (Chinen) KENNY WERNER (Tonight) Mr. Werner is a well-seasoned pianist who tempers his technique with a kind of questing spiritualism, an appropriate quality for this solo recital in a museum of Himalayan art. At 7, Rubin Museum of Art, 150 West 17th Street, Flatiron district, (212) 620-5000, rmanyc.org; $20. (Chinen) Classical Full reviews of recent music performances: nytimes.com/music. Opera 'FALSTAFF' (Tomorrow and Sunday) In its heyday on Bleecker Street, Amato Opera was where young New Yorkers saw their first operas; in its current home on the Bowery, it has taken on a certain quality of camp. But its loyal fans still love it, and it still loves opera. It offers Verdi with all of that love, if too few of the musical skills required to perform it, so that some of it, by gosh, still gets across. Tomorrow at 7:30 p.m., Sunday at 2:30 p.m., Amato Opera, 319 Bowery, at Second Street, East Village, (212) 228-8200, amato.org; $35; $28 for students and 65+. (Anne Midgette) Classical Music * BARGEMUSIC (Tonight through Sunday, and Wednesday) Bargemusic, the floating chamber music hall on the Brooklyn side of the East River, is offering varied programs this week. Tonight Mira Jevitch offers a piano recital that runs from Romantic works by Brahms and Liszt to movements from ''Eight Voyages'' by the contemporary Australian composer Grant Foster. Tomorrow and Sunday the Manhattan String Quartet performs Beethoven's three Opus 59 quartets. And on Wednesday the Sonar Players offer an overview of George Crumb's music, including two of his 1970s classics, ''Vox Balaenae'' (1971) and ''Black Angels'' (1970) for electric string quartet. Tonight and tomorrow night at 8, Sunday at 4 p.m., Wednesday at 8 p.m., Fulton Ferry Landing next to the Brooklyn Bridge, Brooklyn, (718) 624-2083, bargemusic.org; $35; $30 for 65+ tonight; $20 for students. (Allan Kozinn) EMERSON STRING QUARTET (Thursday) Playing string quartets in a 2,800-seat hall may contradict the term ''chamber music,'' but this is a chance for a larger audience to hear a distinguished American ensemble playing Haydn, Mozart and Beethoven. At 8 p.m., Carnegie Hall, (212) 247-7800, carnegiehall.org; $32 to $79. (Bernard Holland) * KONSTANTIN LIFSCHITZ (Sunday) Last year the Free for All at Town Hall series presented this Russian-born pianist in a marathon event, playing the 24 Preludes and Fugues of Shostakovich in two programs on a single Sunday. Mr. Lifschitz, who won high praise for that performance, returns to the Free for All series with an even more daunting marathon, the 48 Preludes and Fugues of Bach, again to be played in two programs on Sunday. At 2 and 7 p.m., Town Hall, 123 West 43rd Street, Manhattan, (212) 707-8787, freeforallattownhall.org; free, but tickets are required. (Anthony Tommasini) NEW YORK PHILHARMONIC (Tonight and tomorrow night) Julian Rachlin, a Lithuanian-born violinist who lives in Austria, has been playing with Lorin Maazel since a tender age. He returns with the Philharmonic this weekend to offer Saint-Saëns's Third Concerto. Of more musical weight, perhaps, is Bartok's Concerto for Orchestra, which Mr. Maazel should use to put the orchestra through its paces. Also on the program is Rimsky-Korsakov's ''Russian Easter'' Overture. At 8, Avery Fisher Hall, Lincoln Center, (212) 721-6500, nyphil.org; $28 to $96. (Midgette) NEW YORK YOUTH SYMPHONY (Sunday) There is nothing like hearing a major repertory work performed by exuberant and gifted musicians who are palpably excited to be playing the piece. The New York Youth Symphony has been delivering such performances for the last five years under its dynamic young music director, Paul Haas. Mr. Haas ends his tenure on Sunday with a particularly ambitious program: arrangements of Bach chorales, the premiere of Dan Visconti's ''Some Day the Sun Won't Shine,'' and Mahler's daunting Ninth Symphony. At 2 p.m., Carnegie Hall, (212) 247-7800, carnegiehall.org; $7 to $55. (Tommasini) JOHN SCOTT (Tomorrow) Mr. Scott, the organist and music director at St. Thomas Church, plays the last concert in his 10-part series exploring the organ works of Buxtehude, in honor of the 300th anniversary of that composer's death. Built in a style similar to that seen in northern Germany and the Netherlands in the 17th and 18th centuries, St. Thomas's Taylor & Boody organ is ideal for this venture. At 4 p.m., Fifth Avenue at 53rd Street, (212) 757-7013, saintthomaschurch.org; free. (Vivien Schweitzer) Dance Full reviews of recent performances: nytimes.com/dance. * AMERICAN BALLET THEATER (Tonight, tomorrow and Monday through Thursday) The programming this week pairs two master ballet choreographers, George Balanchine and Frederick Ashton, whose styles may be polar opposites but whose love for the art form shines through in the works that will represent them. A number of role debuts promise to add spice to Balanchine's ''Symphonie Concertante,'' an elegant re-envisioning of Mozart in movement, and Ashton's ''Dream,'' Shakespeare's ''Midsummer Night's Dream'' in a magical new realm. Among those making debuts in their roles are Gillian Murphy and David Hallberg (tomorrow afternoon), who would seem to have been born to dance Titania and Oberon in ''Dream.'' Diana Vishneva, Angel Corella and Craig Salstein as Puck (Tuesday) are not far behind. Tonight at 8; tomorrow at 2 and 8 p.m.; Monday and Tuesday at 8 p.m.; Wednesday at 2 and 8 p.m.; Thursday at 8 p.m., Metropolitan Opera House, Lincoln Center, (212) 362-6000, abt.org; $24 to $110.

At 8 p.m., Dixon Place, 258 Bowery, between Houston and Prince Streets, Lower East Side, (212) 219-0736, dixonplace.org; $10 to $12, and Theater Development Fund vouchers accepted. (Dunning) * DANCEAFRICA (Tonight through Sunday) This annual festival at the Brooklyn Academy of Music celebrates three decades of African and African-American dance with performances by the Bambara Drum and Dance Ensemble, Forces of Nature Dance Theater Company, Kulu Mele African American Dance Ensemble, Ndere Troupe, Sabar Ak Ru Afriq Dance Theater and BAM/Restoration DanceAfrica Ensemble. Tonight at 7:30; Saturday and Sunday at 2 and 7:30 p.m.; BAM Howard Gilman Opera House, 30 Lafayette Avenue, at Ashland Place, Fort Greene, (718) 636-4100, bam.org; $15 to $45; $10 for under 16. (Anderson) DANCE AT THE CHOCOLATE FACTORY (Tonight, tomorrow and Thursday) Michael Helland's ''Dress Up Show'' will be performed tonight and tomorrow night. Starting on Thursday night, Renee Archibald's ''Oh Dear Natascha'' explores darkness and confinement in an environment filled with small piles of samples and clippings quietly waiting, as Ms. Archibald puts it, ''for an imaginary domestic life in various imaginary cities.'' Well, why not? (''Oh Dear Natascha,'' through June 2.) At 8, the Chocolate Factory, 5-49 49th Avenue, Long Island City, Queens, (212) 352-3101, chocolatefactorytheater.org; $15. (Dunning) EAR TO THE GROUND (Thursday) A program of premieres by Anita Cheng and Noopur Singha honors Asian Heritage Month. (Through June 2.) At 7:30 p.m., Mulberry Street Theater, 70 Mulberry Street, Chinatown, (212) 349-0126; $14; $12 for students and 65+. (Anderson) HILARY EASTON AND COMPANY (Thursday) ''It's All True'' concerns a man grappling with his recollections and trying to distinguish fact from fiction. (Through June 3.) At 8 p.m., the Duke on 42nd Street, 229 West 42nd Street, Manhattan, (212) 239-6200; $25. (Anderson) KOOSIL-JA'S MECH[A] OUTPUT (Thursday) Koosil-Ja Hwang blends elements of dance and music from the classic Japanese Noh play ''Dojoji'' with what Ms. Hwang describes as multimedia technology, including live 3-D video. (Through June 2.) At 7:30 p.m., Japan Society, 333 East 47th Street, Manhattan, (212) 715-1258, japansociety.org; $25. (Dunning) TIFFANY MILLS COMPANY (Thursday) In ''LandFall'' three interlocking duets evoke the physical and emotional power of a storm. (Through June 3.) At 8 p.m., Joyce SoHo, 155 Mercer Street, (212) 334-7479; $30 for opening night. (Anderson) * MOMIX (Tuesday through Thursday) A company that revels in theatrical illusion reviews a quarter-century in ''Momix reMIX.'' (Through June 10.) Tuesday and Wednesday at 7:30 p.m., Thursday at 8 p.m., Joyce Theater, 175 Eighth Avenue, at 19th Street, Chelsea, (212) 242-0800, joyce.org; $44. (Anderson) BEN MUNISTERI DANCE PROJECTS (Thursday) In Mr. Munisteri's new ''Terra Nova,'' dancers leave a design of moving colors and patterns in their wake, courtesy of motion-capture technology. (Through June 3.) At 8 p.m., Dance New Amsterdam, 280 Broadway, at Chambers Street, TriBeCa, (212) 279-4200, dnadance.org; $25. (Dunning) * NEW YORK CITY BALLET (Tonight through Sunday, and Tuesday through Thursday) The week's programs are ''Four Voices,'' consisting of Christopher Wheeldon's ''Carousel (a Dance),'' Alexei Ratmansky's ''Middle Duet,'' Jerome Robbins's ''Moves'' and Balanchine's ''Sonnambula''; ''Essential Robbins,'' with ''In G Major,'' ''Dances at a Gathering'' and ''I'm Old- Fashioned''; ''Essential Balanchine,'' with ''Walpurgisnacht Ballet,'' ''Liebeslieder Walzer'' and ''Symphony in Three Movements''; and ''Three Masters: Tchaikovsky, Balanchine, Robbins,'' which features Balanchine's ''Mozartiana'' and ''Tchaikovsky Piano Concerto No. 2,'' and Robbins's ''Piano Pieces'' and ''International Balanchine'' (''Serenade,'' ''Bugaku'' and ''Union Jack''). Kyra Nichols, who retires at the end of the season, will dance ''Mozartiana,'' in a role that brings out all her innate musicality, with Ashley Bouder and Jonathan Stafford new in ''Tchaikovsky.'' Maria Kowroski is an intriguing choice for the sensuous geisha in ''Bugaku,'' which she will dance for the first time. And Robbins's ''Dances at a Gathering'' will feature debuts by Jenifer Ringer, Megan Fairchild, Sarah Mearns and Adam Hendrickson on Thursday. ''Four Voices,'' tonight at 8; ''Essential Robbins,'' tomorrow at 2 p.m. and Tuesday at 7:30 p.m.; ''Symphony in Three Movements,'' tomorrow night at 8; ''Three Masters,'' Sunday at 3 p.m.; ''International Balanchine,'' Wednesday at 7:30 p.m. New York State Theater, Lincoln Center, (212) 870-5570, nycballet.com; $15 to $86. (Dunning) STREB S.L.A.M. (Tonight through Sunday) High-flying, wall-crashing thrills and chills, and popcorn besides. (Through June 17.) Tonight at 7, tomorrow at 3 and 7 p.m., Sunday at 3 p.m., Streb Laboratory for Action Mechanics, 51 North First Street, Williamsburg, Brooklyn, (212) 352-3101, strebusa.org; $20; $10 for children. (Dunning) * 2007 TAP EXTRAVAGANZA (Sunday) This annual event, presented by the New York Committee to Celebrate National Tap Dance Day, is just the ticket for tap enthusiasts and dance fans who have to have a little unruly fun with their art form. The lineup includes Jimmy Slyde, Mable Lee, Dormesha Sumbry Edwards and Savion Glover. And Mr. Glover's mother, Yvette, a powerful singer, will be honored along with Bob Audy and Deborah Mitchell, tap teachers and choreographers. At 7 p.m., Fashion Institute of Technology, Haft Auditorium, 227 West 27th Street, Chelsea, (212) 279-4200, ticketcentral.com; $25 to $65. (Dunning) Art Museums and galleries are in Manhattan unless otherwise noted. Full reviews of recent art shows: nytimes.com/art. Museums * BROOKLYN MUSEUM: 'GLOBAL FEMINISMS,' through July 1. Too much of the work in this sprawling, international assembly of recent pieces by nearly 90 women from nearly 50 countries is body-oriented and doesn't venture far beyond the essentialism of Judy Chicago's indomitable 1975-79 installation opus, ''The Dinner Party,'' whose enshrinement in the new Elizabeth A. Sackler Center for Feminist Art this exhibition celebrates. Nearly devoid of significant painting and sculpture and Thoroughly dominated by photography and video, with a documentary slant to many of its better moments, the show is more about information, politics and the struggle for equality than it is about art in any very concentrated or satisfying sense. That doesn't keep parts of it from being energetic and illuminating, especially as a record of the way that feminism has gripped and jump-started the imaginations of women around the world. 200 Eastern Parkway, Brooklyn, (718) 638-5000, brooklynmuseum.org. (Roberta Smith) BROOKLYN MUSEUM: 'KINDRED SPIRITS: ASHER B. DURAND AND THE AMERICAN LANDSCAPE,' through July 29. This show of about 60 works by Durand has as its centerpiece ''Kindred Spirits'' (1849), a tribute to the landscapist Thomas Cole and his friend the poet and journalist William Cullen Bryant. A founder of the Hudson River School, Durand (1796-1886) favored the realistic approach to landscape. He explored forest interiors with close attention to the ways of trees, foliage and rocks and ground cover in smaller works, while his larger and more elaborate exhibition pictures, influenced by European masters, are Arcadian visions suffused with light, color and atmospheric perspective. 200 Eastern Parkway, at Prospect Park, Brooklyn, (718) 638-5000, brooklynmuseum.org. (Grace Glueck) COOPER-HEWITT NATIONAL DESIGN MUSEUM: 'DESIGN LIFE NOW: NATIONAL DESIGN TRIENNIAL 2006,' through July 29. Like its two predecessors, this ambitious show illuminates the volatile, contradictory and ever-expanding field of design, but fails to call it to order. The inclusions range from genius to schlock, delightful to dispiriting. They cover medical innovation, military hardware, completely frivolous reiterations of received ideas (far too many of which trace to Surrealism), sundry Web sites and magazines, haute couture, architecture and recycling -- more varieties of recycling than you can easily count. The show coalesces into deliberately orchestrated skirmishes between conflicting principles and entities: corporate and private, decorative and essential. 2 East 91st Street, (212) 849-8400, ndm.si.edu. (Smith) Grey Art Gallery: 'Beyond the White Cube: A Retrospective of Brian O'Doherty/Patrick Ireland,' through July 14. Starting in the mid-1960s and in concert with the most influential thinkers of the period (Roland Barthes, Marcel Duchamp and Susan Sontag), Brian O'Doherty made Conceptual art in a Minimalist vein. This show displays his sculptures, drawings, performance videos, paintings and rope drawings, which could easily be called installations. It's a must-see show for anyone who wants to understand the conceptual frameworks that underpin so much of today's most significant installation and performance art. 100 Washington Square East, Greenwich Village, (212) 998-6780, nyu.edu/greyart/. (Bridget L. Goodbody) GUGGENHEIM MUSEUM: 'DIVISIONISM/NEO-IMPRESSIONISM: ARCADIA AND ANARCHY,' through Aug. 6. Ultimately this rare, compressed, mercurial exhibition of work by the Italian Divisionists of the 1890s is long on history and short on truly convincing paintings. The inclusion of works by Seurat and his French, Dutch and Belgian followers clarifies how the Italians pushed Pointillism, Seurat's invention, in all directions: toward realism, academic classicism, Symbolism, class consciousness and even Impressionism. The show opens a new, albeit small, window on the genesis of Modernism beyond the French canon. If many of the works are period pieces, they are also immensely appealing, big-hearted and physically robust period pieces. Guggenheim Museum, 1071 Fifth Avenue, at 89th Street, (212) 423-3500. (Smith) * INTERNATIONAL CENTER OF PHOTOGRAPHY: 'BIOGRAPHICAL LANDSCAPE: THE PHOTOGRAPHY OF STEPHEN SHORE, 1969-1979,' through Sept. 9. In 1971 the Metropolitan Museum of Art gave Stephen Shore its second-ever exhibition by a living photographer. (Alfred Stieglitz had the first.) He was 23 when it opened. What he did makes up most of this wonderful show. Mr. Shore has reprinted the photographs digitally, with rejuvenated colors as fresh and subtle as the day the pictures were shot. The work's laconic eloquence speaks of an era and a nation. Its wit and affection add buoyancy to scenes of threadbare America from a moment when the country was depressed by war and years of civil unrest. Its formal rigor makes an uncanny order out of images that, at first glance, look like no place or nothing. Look again. His show reminds us of a period when cutting-edge American art and the tradition of straight, documentary photography got together. 1133 Avenue of the Americas, at West 43rd Street, (212) 857-0000. (Michael Kimmelman) * International Center of Photography: 'Let Your Motto Be Resistance: African American Portraits,' through Sept. 9. This show of photographic portraits is a praise-song in pictures, a shout-out to history. It's also a fancy-dress inaugural party for the yet-to-be-built National Museum of African American History and Culture in Washington. It tends to be a little too fancy, too heavy on glitz, too short on grit. Still, what a party it is, with a Who's Who of charismatic black statesmen, from Frederick Douglass to Malcolm X, and with Leontyne Price, Mahalia Jackson and the Supremes sharing a stage. (See above.) (Holland Cotter) * JAPAN SOCIETY: 'Awakenings: Zen Figure Painting in Medieval Japan,' through June 17. Japan Society has a history of producing exquisite shows of Buddhist art. And this one, with four dozen paintings of Buddhists gods and saints hung in shrinelike alcoves, is transporting. It covers a broad swath of geography, bringing together 13th- to 16th-century hanging scrolls, not only from Japan but also from China, where Zen Buddhism, called Chan in Chinese, originated. 333 East 47th Street, (212) 832-1155, japansociety.org. (Cotter) The Jewish Museum: Dateline: Israel: 'New Photography and Video Art,' through Aug. 5. Roughly every decade, the Jewish Museum offers a survey of contemporary art from and about Israel. This year non-Israeli artists from Europe and the United States -- and a single artist from Palestine -- have been added to the mix. There's some very good work here, though, on the whole, the show grapples with crucial political issues in an indirect way. 1109 Fifth Avenue, at 92nd Street, (212) 423-3200, jewishmuseum.org. (Cotter) * THE METropolitan museum of art: 'Poiret: KING OF FASHION,' through Aug. 5. A revolutionary in revolutionary times, the fashion designer Paul Poiret introduced unstructured garments that freed women from corsets in 1906, the year before Picasso committed his decidedly uninhibited (and unstaid) ''Demoiselles d'Avignon'' to canvas. But the modern painter whom Poiret most resembles, in his love of the exotic, his brilliant use of color and pattern and his penchant for simplified, almost rudimentary form, is Matisse. This rare exhibition -- from the Met's Costume Institute -- does his sartorial genius justice with a spare installation rendered radiant by hand-painted silk backdrops of the leafy parks and luxurious drawing rooms of Paris. (212) 535-7710, metmuseum.org. (Smith) The Met: 'FRANK STELLA: PAINTING INTO ARCHITECTURE,' through July 29. Crammed into a gallery that feels like an obstacle course, this exhibition spans 43 years with 25 paintings, reliefs, drawings and architectural models, all with the goal of tracing an evolution that has not yet occurred. Taking up most of the space are enlarged versions of models that are considered sculptures -- and that look as if they date from the early 1960s. The main draws are the examples of the paintings and reliefs that are the basis of Mr. Stella's importance as an artist. (See above.) (Smith) The Met: 'FRANK STELLA ON THE ROOF,' through Oct. 28. Two large Pop Art sculptures, two architectural models and a model enlarged into a sculpture-installation piece confirm that one of the greatest American artists of the postwar era doesn't do himself or anyone else any favors when he strays from the wall to work fully in the round. The results have a certain Stella-like verve but are otherwise generic. (See above.) (Smith) MORGAN LIBRARY & MUSEUM: 'Apocalypse Then: Medieval Illuminations From the Morgan,' through June 17. The symbolism of the Book of Revelation, with its demons and lakes of fire, has a subversive appeal. This new exhibition at the Morgan Library celebrates a facsimile of ''Las Huelgas Apocalypse'' (1220), the largest surviving Spanish illuminated commentary on the Apocalypse. The show, which includes 50 leaves from the original text, unbound and installed around the gallery's perimeter, offers a walking tour of the medieval imagination. 225 Madison Avenue, at 36th Street, (212) 685-0008, morganlibrary.org. (Andrea K. Scott) * El Museo del Barrio: 'The Disappeared (Los Desaparecidos),' through June 17. The most potent show of contemporary political art of the season, and one of the most moving shows of any kind in the city right now. The title refers to a peculiarly chilling form of violence associated with political upheavals in Latin America over the past 40 years, and now becoming more common in Iraq. 1230 Fifth Avenue, at 104th Street, (212) 831-7272, elmuseo .org. (Cotter) Museum of modern art: 'COMIC ABSTRACTION: IMAGE-BREAKING, IMAGE-MAKING,' through June 11. This unimaginative and uniformed treatment of a big idea -- the healthy and essential contamination of Modernist abstraction by popular culture -- should be seen if only because it is such a dispiriting symptom of the Modern's paralysis where contemporary art is concerned. Including 30 works by 13 artists from the last 16 years, it alternates between the literal and the arbitrary and favors sincere political intent over genuine artistic quality. Although it promises work that addresses ''perplexing questions,'' nearly everything here is perfectly pleasant and innocuous. The exceptions are provided by Gary Simmons, Ellen Gallagher and Sue Williams. (212) 708-9400, moma.org. (212) 708-9400, moma.org. (Smith) Neuberger Museum of Art: FUGITIVE ARTIST: THE EARLY WORK OF RICHARD PRINCE, 1974-77, through June 24. Mr. Prince is one of the most elusive, perverse and sardonic of all of the important appropriation artists to emerge in the early 1980s, so perhaps it is not surprising that he has boycotted this exhibition of little-known early work, all from public and private collections. But that doesn't stop the 50 pieces on view from revealing his roots in 1970s Conceptual Art; his progress from generic to original and radical; or the depth and duration of his fascination with language, photography, printmaking, the more banal forms of urban postwar Americana and a disconnected, decidedly male blankness. If anything, it increases his stature. Purchase College, State University of New York, 735 Anderson Hill Road, Purchase, N.Y., (914) 251-6100, neuberger.org. (Smith) * Neue Galerie: 'Van Gogh and Expressionism,' through July 2. The Neue has, as usual, gathered a stellar roundup of Expressionist art. In one of the show's most exciting rooms, a third-floor gallery devoted mostly to self-portraits, two extraordinary van Goghs hang at opposite ends: ''Self-Portrait With Straw Hat'' (1887-88), from the Metropolitan Museum's collection, filled with energetic, radiating brushstrokes, and the National Gallery's vibrant self-portrait of the artist holding a palette and brushes, painted about a year later. The most compelling pairing in this room, though, is van Gogh's ''Bedroom'' from 1889, the second of three versions he painted of his room in Arles, with Egon Schiele's obvious homage, ''The Artist's Bedroom in Neulengbach,'' painted in 1911, in a darker palette and with a perspective tipped precariously toward the viewer. 1048 Fifth Avenue, at 86th Street, (212) 628-6200, neuegalerie.org. (Martha Schwendener) STOREFRONT FOR ART AND ARCHITECTURE: 'CCCP: Cosmic Communist Constructions Photographed,' through June 16. Covering a period ignored by academics and mainstream architects, this show is packed with obscure architectural gems. It relies almost exclusively on the photographs of Frédéric Chaubin, who spent five years traveling across the former Soviet Union, uncovering forgotten architectural works in cities like Tbilisi, Yalta and Yerevan. The results are a revelation. Among the outright gems is Georgy Chakhava's 1975 Roads Ministry building, a monumental grid of interlocking concrete forms rising on a steep wooded site in Tbilisi, Georgia. Rising on an incline between two highways, the building's heavy, cantilevered forms reflect the Soviet-era penchant for heroic scale. Yet they also relate sensitively to their context, celebrating the natural landscape that flows directly underneath the building. What's refreshing about this exhibition is its lack of an ideological agenda: it is open to all sorts of possibilities. The Gaudiesque romanticism of a sanitarium in Druskininkai, Lithuania, for example, spins the aesthetic off in yet another direction. Compelling and easy to digest, this show piques our interest in ways that some larger institutions, ever more averse to risk, often fail to do. (Nicolai Ouroussoff) The Studio Museum in Harlem: 'Philosophy of Time Travel,' through July 1. This flawed show, which was created by a group of artists who studied together at the California Institute of the Arts, is nonetheless an interesting example of one of the art world's latest trends: the art collective. It takes Brancusi's ''Endless Column'' as its point of departure and reimagines this Modernist icon from the point of view of art school grads, who are versed in the language of artspeak and wed to the righteous cause of freedom of expression. 144 West 125th Street, (212) 864-4500, studiomuseum.org. (Goodbody) WHITNEY MUSEUM AT ALTRIA: Matthew Brannon, 'Where Were We,' through Aug. 26. Matthew Brannon brings together art, poetry and advertising in a series of letterpress prints that hark back to 1950s and 1960s textile designs by Astrid Sampe and Marimekko. Texts written by the artist and accompanying the images read like song lyrics crossed with Conceptual Art and Language Poetry (which emphasized experimentalism and reader interaction). Consumption and excess are frequent references, as well as how art, design and fashion feed these modern yet primordial urges and desires. 120 Park Avenue, at 42nd Street, (917) 663-2453, whitney.org. (Schwendener) WHITNEY MUSEUM OF AMERICAN ART: 'LINCOLN KIRSTEIN,' through Aug. 27. In the middle of the last century Lincoln Kirstein particularly relished attacking the Museum of Modern Art. Pure abstraction was ridiculous, he thought. It had no standards. Against Mondrian and Pollock, he endorsed, among others, the artists in this show. They are the sculptors Elie Nadelman and Gaston Lachaise and the painters Paul Cadmus, who was Kirstein's brother-in-law, Walker Evans and Pavel Tchelitchew. With the exception of Evans, Kirstein's taste clearly hasn't won the day, but it's never bad to re-examine received opinions or to be reminded of a generous advocate. (See above.) (Kimmelman) Whitney Museum of American Art: 'Gordon MaTTA-cLARK rETROSPECTIVE,' through June 3. I have no doubt that Matta-Clark is now being turned into a hot commercial commodity, but at least at the Whitney you can see what he aspired to be. He came up with various wonderfully harebrained ideas. Literally, in one case: after letting his hair grow for a year, he cut it off as a kind of performance and phrenological gag. The preserved hair, dutifully tagged piece by piece, opens the show like a holy relic. At the center of the exhibition is ''Splitting.'' To a plain single-family suburban frame house in Englewood, N.J., he made a cut straight down the middle, bisecting the building, then severing the four corners of the roof. The retrospective consists of films, drawings, photographs and some of the architectural pieces he cut out of buildings. The drawings are casual and not too interesting, but the luxurious black-and-white photographs from Paris speak more to Matta-Clark's formal elegance. The big message was: Life as art, and art as life, a philosophy dependent on our being properly attuned and keen to the moment. (212) 570-3676, whitney.org. (Kimmelman) Whitney Museum of American Art: 'Taryn Simon,' through June 24. Ms. Simon couches the show in the intellectual, power-to-the-people oratory of leftist politics, yet she clearly delights in exposing, in a quasi-tabloid fashion, America's underbelly. Though she has also worked in war-torn areas, Ms. Simon is best known for ''The Innocents,'' a series of portraits of men and women who were wrongly convicted but later cleared by DNA test results. Ms. Simon can work as long as a year to gain permission to photograph high-security zones like the government-regulated quarantine sites, nuclear waste storage facilities, prison death rows and C.I.A. offices on view in the show. There are also pictures with lighter themes: the sandpit where the Grucci family tests fireworks, ski slopes being dynamited for avalanche control and the second Death Star, from ''Return of the Jedi,'' at George Lucas's Skywalker Ranch. Ms. Simon is at her artistic best when her delight in the strangeness of American culture shines. (See above.) (Goodbody) Galleries: Uptown CLAUDE MONET (1840-1926): A TRIBUTE TO DANIEL WILDENSTEIN AND KATIA GRANOFF This exhibition of nearly 60 paintings by one of the most beloved painters in the world feels a little like having dinner with a celebrity. The gallery setting eliminates the usual distance; the startling intimacy allows you to experience afresh the momentum and innovations of Monet's astounding trajectory in the span of three small galleries. Basically, it is a chance to encounter, up close and in detail, the evolving ways of seeing and painting that established the originality, historical importance and continuing irresistibility of Monet's art. It should not be missed. Wildenstein & Company, 19 East 64th Street, (212) 879-0500, through June 15. (Smith) Galleries: SoHo * 'Gego, Between Transparency and the Invisible' The artist named Gego was born Gertrud Goldschmidt in Germany in 1912, but lived most of her life in Venezuela, where she produced netlike drawings in ink and watercolor and what she called ''drawings without paper'': semi-geometric, see-through, two- and three-dimensional pieces of twisted and knotted wires, suspended in space. Whether you think of them as grids gone haywire or as rational forms charged with emotion, they're out of this world, and this small survey gives a good sense of what is distinctive and radical about Gego's art. The Drawing Center, 35 Wooster Street, SoHo, (212) 219-2166, drawingcenter.org, through July 21. (Cotter) Galleries: Other * MARTIN KIPPENBERGER: PREIS PAINTINGS Seven canvases from two series of paintings rarely exhibited in this country play on the double German meaning of preis (price and prize), some variation of which appears on each surface. They show this famous bad-boy sculptor conveying his usual sarcasm into surprisingly beautiful terms that couldn't get much flatter. Hard-edged and brushy techniques contrast the main tactics of formalist painting while converting the modernist grid into designs redolent of drapery and checked tablecloths. A preponderance of hot pink inveigles for the pleasure principle. 1018 Art, 1018 Madison Avenue, near 78th Street, (212) 537-0453, www.1018art.net, through July 27. (Smith) SOL LEWITT: DRAWING SERIES If the greatness of Sol LeWitt, the Minimal-Conceptual artist who died in April at 78, has so far escaped you, this exhilarating show of 14 of his mind-teasing, eye-filling wall drawings from the late 1960s and early '70s may do the trick. Selected and arranged by the artist, they proceed in carefully sequenced contrasts and echoes that are both insightful and idiosyncratic. Since their generating instructions are part of their titles, they reduce the creative process to a short, highly visible straight line. But their crisp geometries, accumulating marks and radiating patterns force us to mind the gap between artistic thought and artistic action, to experience the inability of language to account fully for visual outcome. Dia:Beacon, 3 Beekman Street, Beacon, N.Y., (845) 440-0100, through Sept. 10. (Smith) JOAQUÍN TORRES-GARCÍA This choice exhibition concentrates on small, lively ink drawings from the early 1930s, when Torres-García ironed out Cubism into a compartmentalized grid that could either be abstract -- like Mondrian's work -- or a container for assorted symbols and hieroglyphs. Two earlier paintings underscore that, either way, his inspiration came from combined order and disorder of bustling city views. CDS Gallery, 76 East 79th Street, (212) 772-9555, through June 9. (Smith) Public Art Madison Square Park: Roxy Paine This installation is made up of two stainless-steel tree sculptures -- ''Conjoined'' and ''Defunct'' -- and a glacierlike boulder, ''Erratic,'' by Mr. Paine. The tree sculptures are made from thousands of pieces of metal pipe and rod elements that have been cut, welded and polished. They are real enough to resemble actual trees but not so real that they form a continuum with the surrounding foliage. What captures your immediate attention is ''Conjoined,'' a 40-foot-tall-by-45-foot-wide sculpture of two trees whose gleaming steel branches cantilever and then improbably connect in midair. It is impossible to tell where the branches of one tree begin and the other end. But the piece is also beautifully eccentric, a futuristic fantasy of streamlined vegetation manufactured in imitation of the real thing, only much more appealing and exciting. Madison Square Park, 23rd Street and Fifth Avenue, (212) 538-4689, www.madisonsquarepark.org, through Dec. 31. (Benjamin Genocchio) Last Chance FRICK COLLECTION: 'GEORGE STUBBS (1724-1806): A CELEBRATION,'. One of the finest horse painters ever, Stubbs knew his subjects from head to hoof and skin to bones. He painted other mammals too: dogs, lions, tigers, oxen, monkeys and humans. This intimate show of 17 Stubbs paintings from English collections reveals his admirable range, although the people he portrayed in two large, late canvases, elegiac celebrations of farm workers raking and reaping grain, have the stiffness of figures on a candy box. His horses are his true monuments. 1 East 70th Street, Manhattan, (212) 288-0700, frick.org.; closes on Sunday. (Glueck) * 'Rebel, Rebel: Remembering Karlheinz Weinberger (1921-2006)' The self-taught Swiss photographer Karlheinz Weinberger, who died last year at 81, began his career taking pictures for a gay club in Zurich, but found his true subject in rebellious, working-class teenagers who dressed to shock in the 1960s and '70s. The Weinberger pictures in this show are fairly tame, as if chosen to complement the cooled-out work of the three younger artists -- Ryan McGinley, Walter Pfeiffer and Collier Schorr -- who surround him. But at his best, he's in a class by himself. Anna Kustera, 520 West 21st Street, (212) 989-0082, kusteratiltongallery.com; closes tomorrow. (Cotter)"

2007-05-25T00:00:00Z,"Jordin Sparks was not the only winner on Wednesday, the final night of the television season. As this 17-year-old singer took home the sixth ''American Idol'' crown, the finale's predictably commanding ratings helped make Fox the highest-rated network for the season among adults 18 to 49. Fox has won that title for three consecutive years. Nielsen estimated approximately 29.5 million viewers tuned in to the show's final installment from 8 to 10, down slightly from its performance last year but far ahead of ABC's finale of ''Lost,'' which ranked second for the night. The ''Lost'' finale had 13.7 million viewers from 9 to 11, in line with its performance this season but down more sharply than ''Idol,'' compared with a year ago, falling 17 percent among adults 18 to 49. CBS finished third with reruns on the night; NBC ranked fourth as its repeat broadcast of ''Saturday Night Live in the '90s: Pop Culture Nation'' drew just 4.1 million viewers from 8 to 10.

2007-05-25T00:00:00Z,"'Star Wars,' the Way You Like It Twenty-first-century technology will combine with fantasy of ''a long time ago'' beginning today, when a redesigned StarWars.com, unveiled at the time of the 30th anniversary of the first ''Star Wars'' film, directed by George Lucas, right, will empower fans to get into the action. An online video-editing tool from the Eyespot Corporation of San Diego will make it possible for devotees of the heroes and villains of the epic series to edit their homemade videos into more than 250 scenes and the music from all six of the films. The Web site is also putting online a new collection of hundreds of user-generated ''Star Wars'' videos, five years of ''Star Wars'' Fan Movie Festival shorts and mini-documentaries about the making of the saga. Jeff Ulin, senior director of distribution and online for Lucasfilm, said: ''Since 1977, 'Star Wars' has been built on the idea that our fans are the reason we have been successful, and they have long shown their enormous creativity and desire to have fun and express themselves through 'Star Wars.' Our new site brings our fans innovative tools like the Eyespot editor that let them do just that in exciting ways.''

Celebrating Mr. Simon's selection as the recipient of the library's first Gershwin Award in recognition of excellence exemplifying the Gershwins, the concert was punctuated by high-fives and hugs. Mr. Simon joined Ladysmith Black Mambazo for the first time since 1999 in a performance of ''Diamonds on the Soles of Her Shoes'' from the 1986 Grammy Award-winning ''Graceland'' album and said, ''I haven't performed with them for a few years, but they're my brothers from South Africa.''

Keira Knightley Wins Lawsuit Over Weight Angered by a newspaper article that depicted her as dangerously thin, Keira Knightley, a star of the ''Pirates of the Caribbean'' films, has gained 3,000 pounds -- 3,000 British pounds, that is, or nearly $6,000, the BBC reported. The money was awarded to this 22-year-old actress by the High Court in London yesterday as damages in a libel suit she brought against The Daily Mail for publishing a photograph of her in a bikini on a beach with remarks about her weight with an article in January about a 19-year-old woman, Sophie Mazurek, who died of anorexia. Ms. Knightley's lawyer said the ''deeply offensive'' suggestions could imply that she had an eating disorder and bore responsibility for the woman's death. Ms. Knightley's mother, Sharman Macdonald, said her daughter planned to match the award and donate the money to charity. An 11-year-old director has settled his lawsuit against the patron who he claimed demanded creative control over his short film, The Associated Press reported.

The results, an anthology called ''To Each His Own Cinema,'' has been screened several times in its entirety, but the best way to see these films has been one at a time, as a series of tasty screening room hors d'oeuvres before the start of officially selected features. Each short is stamped with the personality of its director. Lars von Trier's is a sick joke (and a pretty funny one) about how a filmmaker might deal with a boorish patron at a gala screening. Claude Lelouch tells his life story as a series of memorable moviegoing moments, starting with his parents' first meeting at a cinema in 1937."

It is the first indication that political pressure is forcing the White House to turn its attention to what happens after the current troop increase runs its course.

2007-05-26T00:00:00Z,"The critics in Cannes are a notoriously contentious bunch, but something close to a consensus has formed that this festival has new vitality at 60. Some years, a disappointing lineup in the main competition sends impatient crowds to the sidebar programs, but this year the big show is receiving most of the attention and acclaim. Joining the list of top-tier contenders for the Palme d'Or is ''Secret Sunshine,'' from the South Korean director Lee Chang-dong. Mr. Lee, who turned to filmmaking after a long career as a novelist (and who has also served as his country's minister of culture), brings a contemplative, literary sensibility to a story that might easily have lent itself to melodrama and sensationalism. It is about a young widow from Seoul who moves with her son to her husband's hometown, a small city where she knows nobody."

2007-05-26T00:00:00Z,"The question isn't how the French filmmaker Catherine Breillat and that international woman of mystery, Asia Argento, found each other; the question is why did it take them so long? A match made in heaven (for some) or perhaps hell (there were walkouts), ''Une Vieille Maîtresse'' marks a strong return to form for Ms. Breillat and offers continued evidence that Ms. Argento is the reigning queen of Cannes. In the past week, Ms. Argento, the Italian-born actress and sometime director, has torn through Olivier Assayas's ''Boarding Gate,'' where she carries the film on her slender shoulders, and helped keep the flame lighted inside Abel Ferrara's ''Go Go Tales,'' where she bellied up to a stripper pole and exchanged slobber with a Rottweiler. Leave it to Ms. Breillat, whose films include ''Romance,'' a raw, philosophical inquiry about the bedroom, and her last film, the gravely miscalculated ''Anatomy of Hell,'' to push Ms. Argento further yet, and with exhilarating results. Set in 1835 and based on a novel by Jules Barbey d'Aurevilly, ''Une Vieille Maîtresse'' tells the story of a young nobleman, Ryno de Marigny (the newcomer Fu'ad Ait Aattou), who on the eve of his wedding to a delectable sweet named Hermangarde (Roxane Mesquida), finds his future threatened by his scandalous past. Her name would be Vellini, the film's title character and resident outrage, and a creature of such intensely burning, mad passions that it's difficult to imagine any contemporary actress in the role other than Ms. Argento."

2007-05-26T00:00:00Z,"The top prosecutors of Russia and Britain quarreled over a British demand to extradite a former K.G.B. security officer accused of poisoning Alexander V. Litvinenko in London last November. After a meeting of justice officials from the Group of 8 countries in Munich, Russia's prosecutor general, Yuri Y. Chaika, said the suspect, Andrei K. Lugovoi, could face trial in Russia, provided the British provide ''evidence proving Lugovoi's guilt,'' but he reiterated Russia's refusal to extradite him. The British attorney general, Peter Goldsmith, responded that British justice should decide the matter. ''This murder was committed on U.K. soil,'' he said in a statement. ''The evidence is in the U.K. A U.K. citizen was killed and other people put at risk. And it is therefore right a suspect should face justice in a U.K. court.'' STEVEN LEE MYERS"

2007-05-26T00:00:00Z,"A combination of skills -- from shotmaking to mental toughness -- is required to win a Grand Slam event like the French Open, which begins tomorrow. But the individual strengths of players can make a difference at key moments in a match. Here is a look at the best at the game within the game, with the help of a panel of players, former players, executives and coaches: Paul Goldstein, Mary Joe Fernandez, Jürgen Melzer, Sven Groeneveld, Tracy Austin, Larry Stefanki, Brad Gilbert and Roger Gatchalian. WOMEN Forehand Justine Henin Airborne, trunk-twisting physics provide a boost for this 5-foot-5 3/4 Belgian. Svetlana Kuznetsova The big base of success for the most Spanish-like player among the Russians. Ana Ivanovic If only she could move as well as she rips this shot. One-handed backhand Justine Henin Sliced or driven, an enduring thing of beauty. Amélie Mauresmo Less spectacular than Henin's, but heavier. Francesca Schiavone Plenty of Italian flair and a Baroque follow-through. Two-handed backhand Maria Sharapova More technically sound than her unconventional forehand. Jelena Jankovic Best when hit down the line on the run, with elastic limbs flailing. Li Na It is the key to her (and China's) rise into the top 20. Return of serve Serena Williams Best recent reference is her rout of Sharapova in the Australian Open. Elena Dementieva With her serve, it is best to have world-class returns. Lucie Safarova She sees serves very clearly. First Serve Serena Williams It is the key to her revival, and more potent than many of the men's. Maria Sharapova It is better if she gets the first one in these days. Nicole Vaidisova Smooth motion and 6-foot frame serve this 18-year-old well. Second serve Serena Williams Deliberate and, no surprise, forceful. Samantha Stosur Needs to be great to give her a chance to get to the net. Svetlana Kuznetsova The heaviest second serve in the women's game. Touch Martina Hingis Still subtle after all these years. Patty Schnyder Drives bigger women batty with left-handed craft. Amélie Mauresmo A true all-court player, with the spins to match. Volleys Justine Henin Having that one-handed backhand helps at the net. Amélie Mauresmo Won Wimbledon last year by pushing forward. Samantha Stosur Wins doubles titles all year, also by pushing forward. Movement Justine Henin Natural mover who shifts direction like a W.N.B.A. point guard. Jelena Jankovic Hingis 2.0; more about anticipation than pure athleticism. Venus Williams Huge wingspan with foot speed to match along the baseline. Mental toughness Serena Williams Self-belief personified; see life story. Justine Henin Brittle early in career; hard (too hard?) later. Maria Sharapova Despite the occasional meltdown, generally hard to crack. MEN Forehand Roger Federer Conservative grip, outrageous spin and variety. Rafael Nadal Kicks like a second serve on red Paris clay or dry English grass. Fernando González His bazooka shot barely gets the nod over James Blake's. One-handed backhand Richard Gasquet Perpetually surprising, and many insiders' favorite shot in tennis. Roger Federer Nadal has broken it down, but hardly anybody else has. Tommy Haas Even career-threatening shoulder surgery could not dull this weapon. Two-handed backhand Novak Djokovic Stable and huge, and his forehand is coming on strong, too. Andy Murray A delight whether he is on or off balance, but most fun on the run. Marat Safin Not what it was (like the rest of his game) but still a 21st-century classic. First serve Ivo Karlovic At 6 feet 10 inches, he had better have a great serve. Ivan Ljubicic Shorter Croats can slam lots of aces, too. Andy Roddick His coach and head cheerleader, Jimmy Connors, did not teach him this. Second serve Ivan Ljubicic Shorter Croats can win quick points without aces, too. Andy Roddick It does not fool Federer or Murray, but it beats virtually everyone else. Tommy Haas It helped him reach this year's Australian Open semifinals. Returns Lleyton Hewitt With Andre Agassi now a returner emeritus, Hewitt has become the dean. Roger Federer The latest most-underrated part of his game. David Ferrer Hard-working and hard-running, he leads the Tour in return games won. Volleys Tim Henman Henmania has subsided, but this skill remains. Roger Federer As if he did not have enough in the toolbox already. Radek Stepanek He gets plenty of practice with it as a rare serve-and-volleyer. Touch Fabrice Santoro Savor the angles and the artistry; he is 34. Andy Murray No rush; he is 20 (and out of the French Open). Roger Federer Virtuosity is the mother of invention. Movement Rafael Nadal Brad Gilbert calls him the best mover on clay ever. Roger Federer This was an underrated part of his game, until victims started rating it too highly. Nikolay Davydenko Still quick, even after 32 tournaments last year. Mental toughness Lleyton Hewitt Perhaps there is still time for Stallone to watch a Hewitt movie. Rafael Nadal He has faltered here and there, but positive energy is the rule. Roger Federer Why not believe after winning six of the last seven majors?"

2007-05-27T00:00:00Z,"One of the reigning kings of cinematic photography -- that lushly lighted, stage-set tributary of the documentary tradition -- PHILIP-LORCA diCORCIA makes pictures that tell stories, rarely the kind that are easy to summarize. ''The more specific an interpretation suggested by a picture, the less happy I am with it,'' he has said. Since his start in the late 1970s his subjects have included carefully posed family members, male prostitutes and, more recently, pole-dancing strippers whose twisting bodies take on almost classical, caduceuslike forms. His work will be the subject of a retrospective, the largest survey of his career to date, opening Friday at the Institute of Contemporary Art in Boston, where more than 100 prints from every stage of his career will be on display. They will include examples from the highly publicized series he began in the mid-1990s, when he photographed unsuspecting pedestrians in Tokyo, Paris, New York and other cities who were caught in a strobe flash as they walked down the street. The photographs took the idea of street photography to a new level of detail and proximity. They also landed Mr. diCorcia in court. He was sued by a retired diamond merchant who saw his picture in the exhibition catalog and claimed that his privacy had been violated. The suit was dismissed last year by a New York State Supreme Court judge who ruled that the right to artistic expression outweighed the privacy issues. The exhibition is a homecoming of sorts for Mr. diCorcia, who studied at the School of the Museum of Fine Arts, Boston, and is often mentioned among other ''Boston school'' photographers like Nan Goldin and Jack Pierson. Through Sept. 3, (617) 478-3100, icaboston.org. For a photography show in a much different conceptual vein there is ''HAITI UNMASKED.'' The exhibition includes images taken by child domestic workers in Haiti, who were taught photography as part of Kids With Cameras, a nonprofit program that helps marginalized children around the world.

Indeed, the Department of Health and Human Services has cut $9.9 million from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's $35 million annual budget to deal with this deadly virus. Next year, an additional $7 million will be cut, leaving the entire program with only $18.1 million, a reduction of almost 50 percent.

2007-05-27T00:00:00Z,"PERTSCHUK--Leo, age 86 of Boynton Beach, FL, formerly of NY, died May 19, 2007. He is survived by his loving wife of 57 years, Gladys, his children Daniel, Nina, son-in-law Darryl Clopper and two grand-daughters, Sarah Pertschuk and Marissa Clopper. Leo, also, is survived by his brother, Michael and sister, Anita Finkelson. He was a truly unique individual; a wonderful husband, compassionate father, dedicated grandfather, loving big brother and great friend to all who knew him. Leo attended University College School in London, L'Universite de Sorbonne in Paris, New York University, and was a Life Member of ASHRAE (the American Society of Heating, Ventilating & Air - conditioning En gineers). He was an extremely talented and gifted person. His interests were numerous. A few of his main hobbies were composing/playing music and photography. In the past, he was an avid golfer, tennis player and enjoyed boating/fishing. Leo will be missed by all who had the pleasure of knowing him. He brightened many lives with his humility, fabulous sense of humor and total devotion to living life to the fullest."

2007-05-27T00:00:00Z,"The network ''season,'' to the extent that the term still has any meaning, would seem to be ending with the ''House'' finale on Tuesday (9 p.m., Fox). So on to summer: This week brings us the premieres of Mark Burnett's new reality treasure hunt, ''PIRATE MASTER'' (8 p.m. Thursday, CBS), and Kevin Williamson's ''O.C.''-in-the-desert melodrama, ''HIDDEN PALMS'' (8 p.m. Wednesday, CW). Taylor Handley, who played the evil Oliver Trask in the first season of the real ''O.C.,'' now gets to play the Ryan character, a troubled teenager who moves to Palm Springs and discovers that he's the normal one. My own mindless-fun pick: the second season of ''HEX'' (8 p.m. Saturday, BBC America), the cheap-and-dirty, and highly entertaining, British ''Buffy'' clone. A full night of ''The Real World'' on MTV culminates in the first episode of a new six-episode spinoff, ''REUNITED: THE REAL WORLD VEGAS'' (10 p.m. Wednesday), in which cast members from the 2002 Las Vegas season reconvene in the same suite at the Palms. How long will it be before Steven, Brynn and Trishelle get back in the hot tub? Start your office pool now. Three months after Bob Woodruff's ''To Iraq and Back,'' CBS presents a special about the other high-profile American television journalist to be seriously wounded (so far) in Iraq: ''FLASHPOINT: KIMBERLY DOZIER AND THE ARMY'S FOURTH ID'' (10 p.m. Tuesday). Katie Couric anchors the program. Ian Somerhalder, whose Boone was one of the first casualties of ''Lost,'' turns up as the prettiest explorer you've ever seen on the Hallmark Channel's ''MARCO POLO'' (8 p.m. Saturday). The three-hour movie is a Robert Halmi production and as corny and campy as that suggests (Brian Dennehy as Kublai Khan!); watch for the moment when B. D. Wong, as Marco's assigned servant, Pedro, looks deep into Mr. Somerhalder's eyes and murmurs: ''I am to be your slave. My master's every desire is my only happiness.''"
2007-05-27T00:00:00Z,"To the Editor: I enjoyed Henry Fountain's ''Father and Son, Just Two More Soccer Fans'' (Family Travel: England, May 13) about taking his son to see the English football (soccer) team, Arsenal, play in their new stadium. However, Arsenal supporters in the United States should know that there is a much simpler way of getting tickets to see their team. Arsenal America (www.arsenalamerica.com) offers its members the opportunity to buy tickets to all home and away Arsenal matches. Annual membership costs $20 and all tickets are offered at face value, plus a nominal service charge for processing/currency exchange."

2007-05-27T00:00:00Z,"I KEEP coming across advertisements that assure teenagers that this is ''Not Your Mother's Prom.'' One designer promises that her sexy gowns are ''definitely not the prom dress that your mother wore back in the 60s or 70s.'' A florist featuring corsages studded with gems and orchids sprinkled with glitter insists ''these are definitely not your mother's prom flowers.'' The stretch Hummers as the transport of choice? You guessed it -- not your mom's limo. I find these advertisements amusing -- not for the incredible materialistic excess, but for the presumptions about the proms of this generation's parents. Most parents of high school seniors are Baby Boomers, and if you grew up in the tristate region, to say that proms were no big deal is a gross understatement. Proms, like any other event organized by adults, were decidedly uncool. I went to high school in the 1970s, and it was a disillusioning time to be a teenager. During that decade, the Vietnam War ended; the chaotic airlift off the roofs of Saigon was our iconic image. The president resigned. The Beatles broke up."

She teaches a 20-minute penmanship class several times a week, her students get a penmanship grade on their report cards, and they lose points in other subjects if their handwriting is not neat. ''Good penmanship is a sign of self-discipline,'' says Sister Mary Bernadette. ''We're trying to create good students, upright human beings, good citizens, good members of their families. Penmanship is a sign of character.''"

2007-05-27T00:00:00Z,"To the Editor: In writing ''In the Footsteps of Linnaeus: A Vast Garden of Knowledge, Still Blooming Today'' (Family Travel, May 13), about the botanist Carolus Linnaeus whose tricentennial is being celebrated this year, it would seem that Richard Conniff must have made a concerted effort not to mention the name Olof Rudbeck. Both Olof Rudbeck the Elder (1630-1702) and his son, Olof Rudbeck the Younger (1660-1740), played important roles in Linnaeus's career. Both were professors of medicine at Uppsala University in Sweden, and both were botanists."

Dick made some negative comments about an early draft of a ''Blade Runner'' screenplay, but I couldn't help but think that once he saw the final draft he would change his mind. I offered to bring him that script and some production paintings. This began a series of visits where I found him to be warm, funny, gracious and extremely enthusiastic about the film."

2007-05-27T00:00:00Z,"The hot weather is scarcely upon us, but you would think it was high summer from the number of theater festivals under way or getting ready to start. Brits Off Broadway is in full swing at the 59E59 Theaters, and this week sees the kickoff of three more extravaganzas of new work. The venerable ENSEMBLE STUDIO THEATER has been producing its short-play marathon for a whopping 29 years now. The first of two collections of one-acts begins on Thursday. It includes new work by the prolific Neil LaBute, Julia Cho and Wendy MacLeod, along with lesser-known names like Edith Freni and Billy Aronson. A second evening follows, beginning June 15. 549 West 52nd Street, Clinton, (212) 352-3101, ensemblestudiotheatre.org; $18. The quirky downtown troupe CLUBBED THUMB has been holding its Summerworks festival for an also impressive dozen years. Three full-scale productions -- ''Greedy'' by Karl Gajdusek, ''Amazons and Their Men'' by Jordan Harrison and ''One Thing I Like to Say Is'' by Amy Fox -- will be presented for a week each, beginning next Sunday. But the celebration begins on Wednesday with ''A Pageant of the 50 States (and more),'' a one-night-only compendium of 59 one-minute plays about all the states and territorities. Ohio Theater, 66 Wooster Street, SoHo, (212) 352-3101, clubbedthumb.org; $18. And the most endearingly named theater smorgasbord of all starts this week too. THE PRETENTIOUS FESTIVAL: THE MOST IMPORTANT THEATER FESTIVAL ON EARTH begins Friday at the Brick Theater in Williamsburg, Brooklyn. It kicks off with a free evening, a cabaret preview of coming attractions. Outraged at being called ''egalitarian and unpretentious'' by The Village Voice last year, the company's co-artistic director Michael Gardner has thrown down a gauntlet, saying in a press release, ''The Brick is as self-indulgent and impenetrable as the most oblique and experimental performance organizations in the city.'' Anyone want to demur? 575 Metropolitan Avenue, between Union Avenue and Lorimer Street, (212) 352-3101, bricktheater.com; $10."

And MOVEMENT, another electronic music festival, is under way in Detroit. That's great news for dance music fans in New York: This week, Manhattan's clubs are full of highly anticipated dance parties starring D.J.'s and producers on their way to or from Montreal and Detroit, or just here by coincidence. The Brazilian-born producer GUI BORATTO recently released ''Chromophobia'' (Kompakt), a sumptuous full-length debut full of unpredictable tracks built from drips and clicks; when the synth-pop song ''Beautiful Life'' finally arrives, it sounds like a revelation. Expect a thoroughly immersive experience on Thursday night, when Mr. Boratto plays Cielo with MICHAEL MAYER, who can make minimalist dance tracks sound warm, even sentimental. And on Tuesday night the celebrated Chilean-raised producer LUCIANO will be there; expect a long, delirious night of dance tracks that find subtle ways to evoke psychedelia. Tuesday and Thursday at 10 p.m., 18 Little West 12th Street, West Village, (212) 645-5700, cieloclub.com; $15 in advance, $20 at the door or $20 total for both nights. There's still more: The jittery Detroit techno veteran STACEY PULLEN plays the Sullivan Room on Saturday. 9 p.m., 218 Sullivan Street, Greenwich Village, sullivanroom.com; $20, $15 with flier. The Swiss producer MICHAL HO (from the duo of Samim & Michal) comes to Element on Friday, along with LOSOUL, known for sneaky, insinuative tracks 10 p.m., 225 East Houston Street, Lower East Side, elementny.com; $10 advance, $15 at the door. For revelers in search of something less elusive, there's ABOVE & BEYOND, a British team sometimes associated with the populist (and, not coincidentally, much-maligned) genre known as trance; expect snarling bass lines, bucolic synthesizer passages and dramatic buildups when they arrive at Pacha on Friday night 10 p.m., 618 West 46th Street, Clinton, pachanyc.com; $20. Finally there's Curtis Jones, known for the freaked-out techno records he releases as GREEN VELVET and for the gentler house music credited to his alter ego, CAJMERE. Now his Web site (myspace.com/greenvelvet) documents his conversion to Christianity; explaining one new (and typically propulsive) track, ''Love Peace Not War,'' he writes, ''People nowadays have more faith in war and bombs than they have in God.''

2007-05-27T00:00:00Z,"Nora Ephron has made her living as a humorist, so perhaps she's joking when she says, ''It's hard to think of much that is genuinely better'' about growing older (Questions for Nora Ephron, Deborah Solomon, May 6). Here's something that's better: you get to stop worrying about the lines around your eyes and put your energy toward important things. I believe Ephron may have fallen prey to a marketing scheme that the beauty industry foists upon boomers that aging is ugly."

2007-05-27T00:00:00Z,"Lovely to look at and ornery to handle, artichokes are -- like roast turkey and hand-wrapped tamales -- ideal ritual food. The rites that artichokes serve, of course, are spring's, the annual cleaning and regreening of the palate after the long winter. (Even in their oddball alcoholic form -- the Italian digestivo Cynar -- artichokes serve as a quasi-medicinal cleanser.) Other greens and tender young herbs are there as part of the vernal celebration, but artichokes are almost alchemical in their appeal. What other food would you forgive for pricking your fingertips, overflowing your compost bucket and killing your best wines? The artichoke makes up for all this, of course, with its distinctive flavor -- a nutty, herbal fusion with an everlasting finish."

The following day, Stage 1 will take the riders from the Mall, along the Thames, past the London Eye, St. Paul's Cathedral and the Tower of London.

2007-05-27T00:00:00Z,"FIRE ABOARD The News -- The Cutty Sark, the famous 19th-century British clipper ship that transported tea from China to England, suffered heavy damage from a fire early Monday. Behind the News -- The ship was in the midst of a $50 million renovation in London, when firefighters were called to the fire, which the police were investigating. Launched in 1869, the Cutty Sark was built for speed in the intensely competitive tea trade; in 1885, its 72-day voyage from Australia to England set a record. The name comes from a Scottish poem and refers to a woman's undergarments. And, yes, a well-known blended Scotch whiskey bears the ship's name. LOST, NO DIRECTION HOME The News -- Scientists were having little luck in helping two lost, injured humpback whales find their way back to the Pacific Ocean after they wandered 90 miles up the Sacramento River. Behind the News -- The Coast Guard and volunteers in boats spent much of the week trying to herd the mother and her calf back to the Pacific. But as of Friday, the whales, nicknamed Delta and Dawn, were unwilling to swim past a bridge located about 70 miles upriver. Both whales had deep cuts, possibly from a run-in with a boat, and scientists said they seemed to be suffering physically from being in freshwater. The two were first spotted in the river on May 13. BETTER LUCK NEXT TIME The News -- The United States again failed in its quest to win the America's Cup, the most prestigious regatta in sailing. Behind the News -- BMW Oracle Racing, backed by the software billionaire Larry Ellison, lost in the Louis Vuitton Cup semifinals to an Italian team, 5-1, in the best-of-nine series. Facing a must-win race on Sunday, the team replaced its helmsman, to no avail, making this the first time in 28 years the Vuitton final will be without an American team. The winner will go on to challenge the holder of the America's Cup, which the United States last won in 1992. What went wrong? ''They outsailed us,'' said Chris Dickson, BMW Oracle's skipper. BATTEN THE HATCHES The News -- Government weather experts are predicting a busy storm season, with 7 to 10 Atlantic hurricanes, up to half of them capable of causing extensive damage. Behind the News -- The prediction follows a relatively quiet season last year, only the 12th since 1945 without a hurricane making landfall in the United States. This year, forecasters said two to four hurricanes could hit. They based their forecast on two factors: continuing warm temperatures in the Atlantic, and unusually cold ocean temperatures in the equatorial Pacific. Michael Chertoff, the Homeland Security secretary, warned against complacency. ''It's a big mistake to count on being lucky,'' he said. 'X' MARKS THE SPOT The News -- Britain and Spain said they might lay claim to sunken riches recently discovered by American treasure hunters that may be worth $500 million or more. Behind the News -- Olympic Marine Exploration of Tampa, Fla., says the treasure lies in a Colonial-era shipwreck in the Atlantic. Where, exactly? Olympic isn't saying. Code-named ''Black Swan,'' the wreck so far has yielded over 500,000 silver coins, plus hundreds of gold coins and other artifacts. Britain and Spain are waiting to see if they have a claim. Some scholars speculate it may be the Merchant Royal, a British ship that sank southwest of England in 1641 while carrying coins from Spain to Belgium."

2007-05-27T00:00:00Z,"KENJI MIZOGUCHI's 1954 masterpiece, ''SANSHO THE BAILIFF,'' hasn't been available in the United States market since a VHS edition went out of print years ago. But now the Criterion Collection has issued ''Sansho'' as an impeccably produced DVD. This medium allows the viewer to pause and linger over Mizoguchi's magnificent chiaroscuro compositions, and to rewind and re-view the long tracking shots that were the apotheosis of his distinctive style. The plot is simple, borrowed from a 1915 short story by the Japanese writer Ogai Mori, which was in turn based on a much older folk tale. (Criterion includes both versions of the story in a supplementary book.) In 11th-century Japan a brother and sister, Zushio and Anju, are separated from their aristocratic mother (Kinuyo Tanaka) and sold to the spiky-bearded Sansho (Eitaro Shindo), the brutal overseer of an estate that belongs to a distant nobleman. Through years of tragedy and temptation, Zushio (played as an adult by Yoshiaki Hanayagi) struggles to remain true to the democratic principles that sent his father into political exile, while continuing to search for his missing mother. A simple story, but one that Mizoguchi has filled with vivid emotions, complex thematic contrasts and images of an unsurpassed formal elegance. The father's world is that of human society and moral responsibility; the mother is associated with unruly nature and flowing water, as if she were drawing her spiritual values and emotional strength from the earth itself. Once you know ''Sansho the Bailiff,'' it's a film that can be watched without subtitles, and even without sound. Mizoguchi doesn't depend on language to convey meaning, but instead on the unique resources of the movies: a shaft of light that cuts through a dense forest; rhythms that vary from stillness to frenzy; a subtle panning shot that turns just a few degrees to the left at the unforgettable climax, linking the characters to a suddenly palpable sense of eternity.

2007-05-27T00:00:00Z,"Tuscany will be alive this summer with classical music, lots of it. Three music festivals will be inaugurated this year near Siena, an area that already has three other summer festivals. First up are soloists from the Stockholm Royal Opera, many of whom have performed at the Met and La Scala, who will take part in three evening concerts (June 28 to 30) at a private home near San Giovanni D'Asso, about 45 minutes south of Siena. During intermission, a four-course dinner paired with wines will be served by the Siena chef Michele Sorrentino. Tickets start at 80 euros, about $110 at $1.38 to the euro, and include the performance and the meal (www.musictuscany.com)."

2007-05-27T00:00:00Z,"Joan Murray's Lives column on what to do about the aged hitchhiker had universal appeal and raised the question of how children can maintain the delicate balance between duty and respect (May 13). My mother, at 90, confronted me with her desire to live on her own as long as possible. Her mental acuity blinded me to her diminishing physical strength. Finally, I forced her to accept help at home, which, in the end, enabled her to continue living there."
2007-05-27T00:00:00Z,"THIS long sliver of a town climbs up the western slope of the Meadowlands, where most of its 6,000 residents are packed into a dense hillside grid barely five blocks wide, bound together tightly enough by geography and genealogy that they slip easily into the first-person plural, especially when talking about what has happened to them since the morning of 9/11. ''When we got the call about Michael ,'' Police Capt. Frank Smith started to say at police headquarters one day recently, and then his voice caught, just the way many other voices in town do when the subject is Michael A. Schwarz, the latest local casualty of the war in Iraq, a war that has taken far more from Carlstadt than anyone ever expected."
2007-05-27T00:00:00Z,"Since DaimlerChrysler agreed to sell off its money-losing Chrysler division, Chrysler executives have had to tread a fine line in expressing their reactions to the automaker's return to American ownership. After all, their old bosses in Germany will still be, in a sense, nearly 20 percent their new bosses. The private equity firm Cerberus Capital Management will own the other 80 percent of Chrysler. On one hand, as Chrysler's chief executive, Thomas W. LaSorda, jubilantly said, ''We'll be able to run it the way we want to run it.'' But Mr. LaSorda did not want to talk about how his vision had differed from the way his bosses in Germany made him run the company."

2007-05-27T00:00:00Z,"American Ballet Theater's eagerly awaited new ''SLEEPING BEAUTY'' does not set the story in an asylum narcolepsy wing. But advance word -- and avid gossip -- suggests that its three creators have done more than the usual 21st-century streamlining. For one thing, the prince, a cardboard character, will go beyond simply puckering up. Kevin McKenzie, who directs the company, chose to work with Gelsey Kirkland, known for her emotionally nuanced approach to teaching and coaching. Michael Chernov, a dramaturge, has joined the two in mining material from centuries of fairy tales and ballet productions. Ms. Kirkland will also dance the evil fairy Carabosse. Friday at 8 p.m, Metropolitan Opera House, Lincoln Center, (212) 362-6000, abt.org; $24 to $168. DANCEAFRICA, now 30, has grown from an ebullient community event to an even more ebullient full-fledged show, featuring African dance companies from around the world. This year's international visitor is the Ndere Troupe of Uganda, which will present East African dances, songs and poetry on Sunday at the Brooklyn Academy of Music Opera House. The New York-based Forces of Nature Dance Theater Company will perform choreography by Abdel R. Salaam that fuses styles and myth and social history. The festival has played a role in developing African-American dance companies and programs across the nation, three of which will also perform. As always, the larger-than-life, irrepressible founder of the festival, Chuck Davis, will preside. Come prepared to learn a little Swahili and splurge at the outdoor bazaar. Friday at 7:30, Saturday and Sunday at 2 and 7:30, Brooklyn Academy of Music, 30 Lafayette Avenue, Fort Greene, (718) 636-4100, bam.org; $20 to $45, half off for children 16 and under. The lineup for the annual NEW YORK TAP EXTRAVAGANZA on Sunday includes Jimmy Slyde, Mable Lee, Savion Glover and Dormeshia Sumbry-Edwards. Awards will be presented, too. But the great pleasure of the event promises to be the way that tap, practiced by several generations of dancers, comes alive once again. 7 p.m., Fashion Institute of Technology, 227 West 27th Street, Chelsea, nytap.org; $25 to $65."

2007-05-27T00:00:00Z,"This is a notable week for complete surveys of classical repertory, one courtesy of a young pianist, the other from a veteran string quartet. The pianist is KONSTANTIN LIFSCHITZ. Last year, for the invaluable Free for All at Town Hall series, this Russian-born artist won high critical praise and grateful ovations for performing the 24 preludes and fugues of Shostakovich in two programs on a single Sunday. He returns to the series this Sunday to play the 48 preludes and fugues of Bach. Here is a rare chance to immerse oneself in arguably the most fundamental, influential and ingenious body of keyboard works in music history. And you can't beat the price. 2 and 7 p.m., Town Hall, 123 West 43rd Street, Manhattan, (212) 707-8787, freeforallattownhall.org; free, but tickets are required. The veteran string quartet is the EMERSON, which has just commenced its Perspectives series at Carnegie Hall. Performing a cycle of the 16 Beethoven string quartets, while always challenging, is no longer unusual. But the Emerson players aim to demonstrate the impact of Beethoven's seminal quartets on the entire genre by performing them alongside quartets by previous, contemporaneous and subsequent composers, from Bach and Haydn through Schubert and Brahms to Shostakovich, Webern and Kaija Saariaho. And more. The inaugural program offers quartets by Haydn, Mozart and Beethoven (the ''Razumovsky,'' Op. 59, No. 3). Thursday at 8 p.m., Carnegie Hall, (212) 247-7800, carnegiehall.org; $32 to $79. On Sunday the dynamic and boyish conductor PAUL HAAS has his final performance as music director of the NEW YORK YOUTH SYMPHONY. The gifted and hard-working players of this impressive ensemble excelled for Mr. Haas during his five-year tenure. The formidable program includes arrangements of Bach chorales, the premiere of Dan Visconti's ''Some Day the Sun Won't Shine'' and Mahler's daunting Ninth Symphony. 2 p.m., Carnegie Hall; $7 to $55."

2007-05-27T00:00:00Z,"Because of Connecticut's early and active participation in legal action against the tobacco industry, the state will receive approximately $27 million more a year over the next decade than it already does as part of the 1998 settlement. This year, that amounted to nearly $112 million. But if Connecticut's track record with the nearly $1 billion in settlement money it has already received is any indication, little of the windfall will go toward the antismoking efforts that the money, under the terms of the settlement, is supposed to pay for. This year, the state allocated less than 10 percent of the $21 million that the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention in Atlanta recommends it should spend. This was one of its best years; the allocation last year was 0.2 percent."
2007-05-27T00:00:00Z,"The case for ocean no-fishing areas is more complicated than Paul Greenberg suggests (May 13). Ideologues who insist that every protected area must be closed to all fishing, or that every place must remain open to all fishing, are equally mistaken. A mixed approach that uses traditional fisheries regulations, market incentives, informed consumers and comprehensive ocean zoning -- not just closed areas -- is needed."

2007-05-27T00:00:00Z,"BACK in 2001, Nissan badly needed a hit to revive its floundering business in North America, and the Altima delivered. The third-generation Altima, transformed from a dowdy, unloved compact into a sleek midsize sedan with sporty handling, brought younger customers to Nissan showrooms and gave the carmaker a serious competitor to the mighty Toyota Camry and Honda Accord. Nissan's recent woes, a dip in sales and profits, is hardly the sort of crisis that confronted the company six years ago. But Nissan is again turning to the Altima to refresh its image. While the fourth-generation car isn't as big a leap as the third, this redesigned 2007 model gives Nissan a bit of needed sizzle in the crowded market for midsize, midprice front-wheel-drive sedans."

2007-05-27T00:00:00Z,"Charter Member Trevor Hoffman of the Padres is five saves from becoming the first pitcher with 500. His first two saves came in 1993 with the Marlins. They traded him in June of that season. Florida, which joined the majors in 1993, has 542 saves in its history. Rare for N.L. Shortstops Brewers shortstop J. J. Hardy leads the National League in total bases with 118. The last shortstop to lead the N.L. in that category was Ernie Banks with 379 in 1958. Milwaukee, with a 17-7 record at home, is scheduled to be home for 10 straight games starting tomorrow. Behind the Pace Alfonso Soriano of the Cubs, who hit 46 home runs last season as a member of the Nationals, has hit only four so far this season. In 2006, he had 19 through May 31. Bad Beginners With his loss Friday night against the Nationals, Anthony Reyes of the Cardinals is 0-8. The record for most consecutive games lost from the start of a season is 14, shared by Joe Harris with the 1906 Boston Americans (later the Red Sox) and Matt Keough with the 1979 Oakland Athletics. Beckett Set to Return Josh Beckett of the Red Sox (7-0) is expected to be activated from the disabled list Tuesday to make his first start since May 13. He is set to start against the Indians in Boston, where he is 4-0 this season. The Watch List Frank Thomas is healthy again, but his numbers are not. His home run Thursday tied him with Lou Gehrig on the career list. But he has only 7 homers and 20 runs batted in this season and is hitting .228. Thomas, right, who signed a two-year, $18 million deal with the Blue Jays in the off-season, has averaged 36 homers and 104 R.B.I. in his past three full seasons. Those numbers are not out of the question. Even in his best seasons, he has had similar droughts. Sure, Edwin Encarnación was hitting around .200 when the Reds sent him to the minors. But the roster move probably had more to do with his benching after he failed to run out a pop-up and with his six errors at third, including two that cost the Reds a game the day before he was demoted. Encarnación hit .413 with 3 home runs in 11 games at Class AAA Louisville before being called back up, a sign that his offense could help make up for the absence of the injured Josh Hamilton. But he also committed three errors at Louisville, a sign that the Reds could miss the third-base play of Ryan Freel, who took over for Hamilton in the outfield. Kevin Kouzmanoff of the Padres is hitting .217, but that is a long way from where he was in April, when he hit .113 with 4 R.B.I. He has rebounded by driving in 18 runs and batting .367 this month.

Indeed, the Department of Health and Human Services has cut $9.9 million from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's $35 million annual budget to deal with this deadly virus. Next year, an additional $7 million will be cut, leaving the entire program with only $18.1 million, a reduction of almost 50 percent.

The typical Indian consumes about one-fifteenth as much energy per year as the typical American -- not one-fifth."
2007-05-28T00:00:00Z,"A battle looms this week between Mr. Spitzer and the Legislature over the details of a bill that would bring new levels of disclosure and oversight to the state's hundreds of public authorities. Though there is broad agreement on a host of issues, the Legislature favors allowing the comptroller to approve all authority contracts and giving subpoena power to the office that monitors authorities' finances. The Spitzer administration, in private talks with lawmakers, balked on those positions. But the biggest sticking point may be something else entirely. Buried in the governor's bill is a provision that would shake up the obscure but powerful Public Authorities Control Board, which must approve projects begun by the state's biggest authorities, such as the Metropolitan Transportation Authority or the Empire State Development Corporation."
2007-05-28T00:00:00Z,"Von Südenfed ''Tromatic Reflexxions'' (Domino) Mark E. Smith, the singer of the British postpunk band the Fall, has legitimized his catarrhal snarl, his malignant susurrations, by running a band for 30 years in the image of his voice, one that plays broken-spoke repetitions with musical imperfection. The sound of the Fall, taken as a career average over its many lineups, is organic, real, even squalid (in the best way). Why would we want to hear him in a different band with metronome-beat electronics? After all he's too good as a mode of resistance against machines."

Professor of French Language and Literature for 43 years and Dean of Studies for 15 years at Barnard College, she was a graduate of Barnard and earned a Ph.D. from Columbia University. She studied also at McGill University and at the Sorbonne.

The French Government awarded her the Palmes Academiques for her fostering of French culture and arts. Until shortly before her death at age 90, she was a lector and choir member at her church, St. John's of Leonia, NJ. She encountered everyone on an equal footing, with a rare combination of kindness and objectivity that made her a dear and valued friend."

(A far more limited form of voting was introduced in Mecca in 1925, which lasted for roughly a decade.

The requirement is included in the governor's array of proposals aimed at making food served and sold in schools healthier. Among the other requirements: high school students could be served decaffeinated coffee or tea, or hot chocolate if it had no more than 180 calories per eight-ounce serving, but only at breakfast. Vending machines in high schools could offer only products meeting a lengthy set of criteria, such as ''nonnutritive-sweetened, noncaffeinated, noncarbonated, nonfortified beverages that contain less than five calories per serving.'' Further, schools must install timing devices in vending machines so they work only ''after the end of the last class period'' of the day."

Companies like Google, Microsoft and Yahoo find themselves going after the same candidates or recruiting in one another's backyards. At the same time, they are running up against a myriad of start-up companies across Silicon Valley. To lure talent, these companies have expanded their recruiting arsenal far beyond the traditional job fair to include events like technology lectures, cocktail parties, pizza parties, treasure hunts and programming contests, called ''code jams'' or ''hack days.'' [Page C1.] LOOKING FOR STARS Despite being the first and certainly the largest African-American cable channel, Black Entertainment Television has developed few of its own marketable stars and virtually no breakout programs. It relies on reruns, movies and music videos for the bulk of its lineup. The chief executive of BET, Debra L. Lee, has tried to reverse that trend, this year increasing the channel's production budget 50 percent and plunging into original programming with 16 new shows for the fall. [C1.] POLICEMAN, NOT A REPORTER David Cunningham, a prominent protester who heads the Anti-Poverty Committee in Vancouver, British Columbia, recently received a call from someone who said he was a reporter named Peter MacKay from the free daily tabloid 24 Hours Vancouver. But when Mr. Cunningham arrived outside a shopping mall for what he thought would be an interview, Peter MacKay turned out to be a plainclothes police officer who arrested him. Someone in the Vancouver Police Department thought the deception was a clever way to lure Mr. Cunningham, but the ruse provoked widespread criticism from civil rights and journalism groups. [C4.] HIGH ASPIRATIONS Though far from a household name in telecommunications, Altimo, the Russian telecommunications investment company, has aspirations of becoming a global power. But the problem it faces, some analysts say, is that at this point, Altimo has made few allies. If it is known beyond Russia at all, it is for its propensity to fight tenaciously in court and on corporate boards for its ambitions, some say. [C5.] THE MALE DIETER The face of dieting may be changing. Of the 72 million people dieting in the United States, 38 percent -- about 28 million -- are men, according to Marketdata Enterprises, a market research company. It estimates that the diet industry will be $58.7 billion this year. And NutriSystem has hired its first male spokesman, the former quarterback Dan Marino, and has started advertising in Sports Illustrated, Men's Health and ESPN magazine. [C3.] MAINSTREAM PROMOTION Mel Gibson's 2004 film ''The Passion of the Christ'' demonstrated to Hollywood just how many evangelical moviegoers there are and how much money can be made from them. Mindful of that market, Universal Pictures has teamed up with Grace Hill Media, a public relations firm that reaches out to religious groups, to publicize the mainstream film ''Evan Almighty.'' Scheduled for wide release on June 22, it stars Steve Carell as a politician who abandons Congress in order to build an ark, taking off on the story of Noah. [C3.] TALLYING GLIMPSES When the sleek yacht of the Luna Rossa team sailed away with a victory in the America's Cup semifinals, there were two vital results. The Italian crew eliminated the American team of BMW Oracle Racing with a 33-second lead. And fleeting glimpses of the flapping mainsails -- branded with logos of Telecom Italia Mobile and the broadband service Alice -- reached millions of television viewers. Those glimpses are now being counted down to the second, categorized by clear and partial visibility, tallied by major countries and then compared with the cost of traditional spot advertisements.

[C4.] A PULITZER AWARD Often the writing and photography that win Pulitzer Prizes require heroic efforts. For one recipient, Jahangir Razmi , the process of receiving the award also took 27 years. In 1979, Mr. Razmi stood near executioners as they shot Kurdish prisoners in Sanandaj, Iran. One picture was picked up by the wire service United Press International. To protect Mr. Razmi, his name was never printed. But after decades of keeping silent, Mr. Razmi allowed his name to appear in a December 2006 article in The Wall Street Journal, which prompted the Pulitzer Prize Board to seek out Mr. Razmi to award him the prize in person.

That shouldn't be a surprise, given the histories of these virtuosos. Both are dazzling improvisers with effusive tendencies, and both could reasonably be called percussionists at heart. So this easily could have been a messy riot of an album, with too much happening at once. But for the most part it isn't because there's so much focused listening going on and -- just as crucially -- because both artists are such eager omnivores. Jazz is to Mr. Corea as bluegrass is to Mr. Fleck: a formative discipline and an ongoing fascination, but hardly the whole story.

Born David William James on April 25, 1949 in Norman, Oklahoma to John and Mary James and beloved by those who knew him, David passed over, after a long and courageous battle with lung cancer on Saturday, May 26, 2007 at 2:28pm surrounded by his loved ones at the home he shared with his partner, Dinda Andrews in Manhattan. A devoted father himself, David is survived by his own father John James, sisters Bonnie and Jennifer, brother John and his two most cherished daughters ''The Girls'', Maris and Dana. Diverse in skills and abilities, talented yet humble and extremely human, David would be more prone to describing himself as an electrical contractor, however, his artistry infused his work which has contributed to the success of many upscale projects in SOHO and Tribeca. His craftsmanship was respected and admired by owners, architects and other tradesmen who worked with him. David graduated from the University of Georgia and went on to acquire his Masters of Fine Arts from the University of Wisconsin. He then became a Professor of Painting at the University of Georgia. David moved to New York City in 1977 where he has lived since. Pursuing his artistic goals he was affiliated with the Semaphore Gallery in SOHO and the Ruth Siegal Gallery on 57th Street. He established himself as a noteworthy New York artist most known for his large 3-D abstract paintings. Jacketless in the depth of winter with his tools in hand David will be most remembered for his warmth, generosity, forgiveness, talent, insights, honesty, integrity, overall humanity and not least his humor, all of which will undoubtedly leave smiles on so many faces for the years to come. A ''Celebration of his Life'' will be held at The Conservancy at Central Park near 105th Street and 5th Avenue from 4-5pm on Wednesday, May 30, with a reception to follow at Hotel Wales at 92nd Street and Madison Avenue from 58pm."

2007-05-30T20:58:41Z,"O.K., so the Thursday column is actually about more than China and religion. In a larger sense it's about the emergence of a bit more personal space, a bit more rule of law, and the hope that China will follow Taiwan and South Korea toward greater pluralism and freedom. But the most striking manifestation of that trend for now is the boom in religion in China, and the way most people in most of the country can worship freely most of the time. And I agree with Li Baiguang that in 20 or 30 years China could have several hundred million Christians, making it the largest Christian country in the world. In most of the world, economic development has eroded religious faith, but in China it's working the other way and there's a considerable parallel with South Korea and its embrace of Christianity in the 20th century."
