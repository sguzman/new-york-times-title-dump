Her Metropolitan Opera debut was in Charpentier's Louise in the 1947-48 season, for which Virgil Thompson wrote ''charmingly sung by a newcomer to the house, Evelyn Sachs.'' From there she went on to engagements with the ranking opera houses throughout the world, including the New York City Opera. During her lengthy career she sang in many operas and delivered a critically acclaimed performance in Rigoletto with famed Swedish tenor Jussi Bjoerling. American music critic and historian of the Metropolitan Opera, Irving Kolodin, called Ms. Sachs ''A Voice of Substance and Quality'' in the New York Sun. She is survived by many loving friends and family members. Funeral services will be on Friday, October 17, at the Frank E. Campbell Funeral Chapel at 1076 Madison Avenue at 11:30am. In lieu of flowers, donations may be made to The Rogosin Institute or The Julliard School, Inc."

2008-10-15T00:00:00Z,"STRAUSS--Michael . One of the most durable and fascinating careers in journalism came to a close Saturday, October 11, 2008, with the death of Michael Strauss, the Palm Beach Daily News' sports editor since 1983, who came to Palm Beach after spending half a century at the New York Times. He was 96. In his extensive and remarkable 75plus years as a sports journalist, Mr. Strauss covered everything from archery to yachting and he prided himself on never having missed a deadline. His dry wit, wry smile and extensive knowledge of history and geography were inescapable for anyone who'd ever gotten to know him. In Palm Beach, Mr. Strauss was a regular presence at events at the Palm Beach Recreation Center, the Phipps Ocean Park Tennis Center, the Breakers and Mar-a-Lago. He was wellknown to the athletic directors of Palm Beach Day Academy, St. Ann's and Rosarian Academy as well as officials at Trump International, the Kennel Club and the Croquet Center in West Palm Beach. He first was published in the New York Times about 70 years ago, and his last published article was published in the Daily News last month. About two weeks ago, Mr. Strauss suffered a fall in his South Palm Beach condominium and was hospitalized at JFK Medical Center in Atlantis. Earlier this week, he was transferred to Hospice by the Sea in Boca Raton. At the Times, he served as winter sports editor and a sports writer and traveled with his hometown Yankees and Mets for 14 seasons. He had a seemingly inexhaustible reserve of personal anecdotes about everyone from Babe Ruth to Pete Rose, Sonny Liston to Joe Namath, Calvin Coolidge to Richard Nixon. As the Times ski editor from 1963 to 1982, Mr. Strauss wrote more than 1,000 articles on the sport. He was inducted in 2001 into the U.S. National Ski Hall of Fame, in Michigan, because of his prolific coverage. Mr. Strauss did not limit himself to journalism; he managed his high school baseball team, and later managed women's professional basketball and baseball teams in the 1940s and 1950s. He also owned a public relations firm, and earned a law degree from St. John's. Mr. Strauss was born July 13, 1912 in Williamsburg, Brooklyn. When he was 10, he caught a glimpse of his first professional baseball game at Ebbets Field, home of the Brooklyn Dodgers. As the 13year-old manager of his high school baseball team, Mr. Strauss called in the details of his team's games to the New York Times' sports desk. Soon his editor, Joe Gephardt, invited Mr. Strauss to write the stories himself. The following summer, he covered New York City boxing club matches for $3 a night. At 18, Mr. Strauss officially joined the staff of the New York Times, covering semipro baseball on Sundays. He was a college freshman, earning 40 cents an inch, or $8 a column. From there his 50year career at the Times blossomed. He covered hundreds of college and professional football games, from Dartmouth, Harvard and Notre Dame to the New York Giants and New Jersey Jets. He covered thoroughbred and harness horse racing. As the ski editor for the Times from 1963 to 1982, he covered Winter Olympics in Squaw Valley, Grenoble, Innsbruck, Lake Placid and Alberta. He covered dragon boat racing in China, Gaelic football in Ireland, and harness horse racing in Macau. He may have been the first sportswriter to take notice of a 12-year-old basketball player named Lew Alcindor later known as Kareem Abdul-Jabbar when he attended an athletic awards ceremony at a New York City Boys Club in 1958. When he wasn't covering sports in exotic locales, Mr. Strauss frequently wrote stories and took photographs for the Times' Travel section. He also contributed articles to Readers Digest, Esquire, Playboy, Travel and Leisure and other magazines, as well as annual entries in Encyclopedia Brittanica and Collier's Encyclopedia Yearbook. And for about a decade Mr. Strauss also had his own radio broadcast, on WQXR in New York, which covered the subject of skiing. Mr. Strauss had such an appetite for winter sports that he once covered three stories in three states, Maine, New Hampshire and New York, in one day. His second career began in Palm Beach after a brief, untenable retirement from the Times in 1982. Mr. Strauss had settled in South Palm Beach with his wife, Cecilia. The couple, who married in 1938, also shared a home in Danby, VT, where they spent summers. Mr. Strauss credited Cecilia, who died in 2002 at 86, with landing him his job at the Daily News. Cecilia called then-publisher Agnes Ash, who hired Mr. Strauss on the spot. In Palm Beach, Mr. Strauss covered sporting events at a dozen venues and schools, from the Rec Center to Mar-a-Lago. ''I worked with him for 25 years.'' said Rick Dytrych, head pro at the Par 3 golf course. Tim O'Connor was stadium manager for the now defunct polo stadium at Palm Beach Polo & Country Club during the early days of polo in Wellington in the mid-1980s.That's when O'Connor, now spokesman for the Palm Beach County Health District, met Mr. Strauss who was covering the sport for the Daily News. Rose Carnicelli, supervisor at the town tennis courts, said Mr. Strauss was the second person she met when she came to work at the town's Palm Beach Par 3 10 years ago. Carnicelli said that she became close to Mr. Strauss after his wife died and she would cook him breakfast and help him around the house. Russ Bitzer, the former head of the Palm Beach Recreation Department who retired in 2005, once said of Mr. Strauss, ''He wrote hundreds of articles for us about the kids and the programs. I would credit him in large part with many of our successes over the years.'' Mr. Strauss also found time to write light verse, and in 1994 published ''Rhymes of My Times''. Mr. Strauss was a member of the Newspaper Guild; the Baseball Writers Association; the U.S. Ski Writers Association, for which he founded the Eastern chapter; the U.S. Harness Writers Association; and the New York and U.S. Turf Writers Associations. He is survived by daughters Ellen of Alexandria, VA, and the Village of Golf, and Sharon Parker of Boca Raton; four grandchildren; Dr. Alexa Boer Kimball of Boston, Andrew Boer of Greenwich, CT, Amy Sumida of Syracuse, NY and John Parker of Kansas City. and eight great-grandchildren. He also is survived by three brothers, Dr. Seymour Strauss of Oceanside, NY, and Boca Raton, Jack Strauss of Berea, KY, and Col. Raymond Strauss of Chapel Hill, NC. Mr. Strauss will be buried in Danby, VT, next to his wife of 65 years. A memorial service will be held in December in Palm Beach.

The telescope should be back to performing normal science by Friday morning, said Art Whipple, manager of the Hubble Space Telescope Systems Management Office at NASA's Goddard Space Flight Center in Greenbelt, Md. The orbiting eye has been out of commission since late September, when a router that formats data and helps relay it to the ground failed, causing the telescope to go automatically into a ''safe mode.'' The device has a backup channel. But to restore it, the engineers have to activate the backup channels in other components of the observatory, none of which have been turned on since the telescope was launched in 1990. So engineers wanted to wait until they were sure it would be safe. DENNIS OVERBYE"

Last fall, an Army board overturned the conviction, citing violations of due process. Only one of the soldiers is known to survive. A handful of the soldiers' families have requested the formal review necessary for the Army to award the back pay to the descendants.

Even though Global Positioning System units for golfers have been around since 2002, they weren't sanctioned by the United States Golf Association for tournaments, even for amateurs, until 2006. Since then sales of the portable devices -- designed to let golfers know how many yards they're standing from the pin and what obstacles might be in the way -- ''have exploded,'' said Bob Tucker, the purchasing manager for the Golf Warehouse, an online retailer. ''The latest GPSs are accurate to within three feet,'' said Brian Verdugo, president of L1 Technologies, the San Diego company that makes the iGolf Neo GPS unit. Battery drain was once a problem. In the early units, ''a charge would only last for four or five hours, barely enough for 18 holes,'' Mr. Verdugo said. Now players can expect a minimum of two rounds between charges. The newer generation of GPS units are also sleeker than the early models, which Mr. Verdugo likened to bricks."

Paul was aptly known as ''Mr. Health'' for his 50year legacy as one of our nation's most accomplished, passionate advocates for health research. He was held in highest esteem by his colleagues, his peers in Congress, multiple Administrations, and leaders in all areas of health and science. Paul was truly a giant, and we were so fortunate to have shared his time and great talents. He often said, ''Without research, there is no hope.'' For the hope that research has brought to lives of Americans and people everywhere, the world owes a great debt of thanks to Paul Rogers. His achievements benefited the lives of Americans young and old, from every corner of the nation. As just one example, thanks to his work on behalf of the National Cancer Act, children's death rates from cancer dropped by more than 60 percent. He was a role model and the epitome of public service, whose optimism and tireless commitment to health research inspired generations of advocates. He was often honored, yet never wanted the light to shine on himself. Instead he seized accolades as a time to champion a cause and challenge others to make America the world leader in health and research for health. To those who knew and worked with Paul, he will be long remembered as the champion of hope that he was. The Hon. John E. Porter, Mary Woolley and Research!America's Board of Directors"

Born in Jersey City on September 11, 1917, she was the daughter of Hugh and Margaret Murphy McKevitt. She attended the Academy of Mount Saint Ursula, graduating in 1935. She entered the Ursuline Novitiate where she pronounced vows on January 24, 1939. She received a B.A. degree from the College of New Rochelle in 1943, and earned a Masters degree in American history at Fordham University in 1955. Sister began her teaching career in Middletown, NY and in years following taught at Blessed Sacrament School in New Rochelle and Saint Angela's and Ursuline Academy on the Grand Concourse in the Bronx. In 1953 she became Principal of a new Ursuline Academy in Bethesda, MD where she inspired an atmosphere of cooperation, telling the students that there would be no rules in the school until they made them necessary. That spirit pervaded the school until its closing in 1976. Meanwhile Sister Amadeus served in both Rome and the United States developing programs for Sisters in various stages of formation as religious. She served as a local Superior of the Convent of St. Teresa's at the College of New Rochelle and at the Ursuline Convent in Bethesda, MD. In 1973 she was asked to serve as Associate Vicar for Religious in the Archdiocese of New York, a post she held until 1981 when she was asked by the Archbishop to study canon law at The Catholic University of America. After completing a JCL, she was appointed to the Archdiocesan Marriage Tribunal as the first woman to be named a judge. Those who brought their cases to the Tribunal were impressed by her intelligence, her empathy, her quick wit and her ability to expedite things. She is survived by a sister, Katherine Dullaghan and several nieces and nephews. A wake will be held at the Ursuline Convent at 39 Willow Drive, New Rochelle, NY 10805, on Friday, October 17th from 2 to 8pm. Mass of Christian Burial will be offered at Holy Family Chapel at the College of New Rochelle on Saturday, October 18th at 10am."

2008-10-19T00:00:00Z,"The Harlequins and Columbines, the lovers clad in silk knee breeches and luminous satin gowns — whoever the people in Jean-Antoine Watteau’s paintings may be, they are so far from anyone we know, inhabiting some sylvan park light-years from the world in which we live, that we can surely be forgiven for greeting Jed Perl’s claim that Watteau is his favorite painter with suspicion. In 2008? Is this some kind of pose he has adopted in defiance of his fellow critics and their embrace of artists whose work is more contemporary, more patently relevant to our times? But in “Antoine’s Alphabet: Watteau and His World” (Alfred A. Knopf), Perl’s affection for Watteau turns out to be genuine and contagious in a series of meditations, organized alphabetically. This book is that rare instance of a gifted writer opening a window on a world most readers never knew existed, giving us the benefit of ruminations that span many years. Perl’s insights send us back to Watteau’s work, and as a result of his enthusiasm, we see more."

Formerly called “Remembrance of Things Past” — a snippet of Shakespeare’s — Proust’s epic became “In Search of Lost Time.” Letter-perfect, yes, but its spirit has been crushed in the wood chipper of literalism.

At the height of her dotage, Castaing was viewed as part of the quarter’s cultural heritage, a living monument whom you acknowledged with a small bow as you turned sideways on the sidewalk to let her pass. A new biography, the first on Castaing, and a new documentary deconstruct the baffling, if not to say clownish, facade."

Once a bon vivant and serious playboy, Bauby now has locked-in syndrome, a condition that has left him unable to move anything but his left eyelid. In the film, beautiful women come and go.

Public policy can anticipate societal needs not detected by economic forces. Venture-capital firms with green-tech funds like Kleiner Perkins serve a valuable role, but must provide short-term (5- to 10-year) returns in an economy in which the benefits of those investments will be long-term. (Paradoxically, part of the bet of green-tech investment is that government policy, like a carbon tax, will catch up to societal needs.) In the coming decades, it might turn out that doing the most good will be manifestly more important than maximizing return on investment and that waiting for the market to respond to the need for action will mean waiting too long. paul flikkema."

''I was there on business. We had been the day before at Metz, and we were just driving to Luxembourg and it was time for lunch so we pulled over. On the way in to this little French town called St.-Avold, we saw a sign that said 'American cemetery.' We stopped in on a whim, and it turns out there are more Americans buried there from the Second World War than any other place in Europe. It was a beautiful day, and as we walked out of the chapel toward the cemetery, there's a clock, and it chimed 2. Neither of us had lost relatives in the war, but the place was just so quiet, and when that clock chimed, you couldn't help but think that all these young people -- even now I get choked up a bit -- time stopped for them at that point. It was very peaceful, and this clear chiming of the clock was very appropriate somehow. We were looking out over this sea of crosses, and it was just really quite overwhelming.'' As told to J. R.

2008-10-19T00:00:00Z,"A review on Sept. 21 about ''September Songs: The Good News About Marriage in the Later Years'' misinterpreted some of the data in a life-expectancy table contained in the book. An average life expectancy at birth of 49.2 years for people born in 1900 would mean that for all persons of that time, the average number of years lived would be less than 50, not that ''those who made it to adulthood usually succumbed before reaching 50.'' (Of those who survived childhood, a high proportion lived past 50 and many for much longer.) In addition, the review repeated the book's misstatement of childhood mortality rates in the early 1900s. Around 1900, fewer than 20 percent of the children born in the United States died before the age of 5, not ''half of all children.''"

Racelle was raised in Brooklyn, the daughter of Harry Kessler and the former Marlye Rothstein, and attended the High School of Music and Art. She went on to study at Brooklyn College, Syracuse University, Hunter College and the Columbia University School of Painting and Sculpture, where she earned her bachelor's degree in Fine Arts. As Racelle Strick, she had her first solo exhibition of paintings at the Rose Fried Gallery in New York in 1966. She also showed frequently at the Elaine Benson Gallery in Bridgehampton where she summered, beginning in 1968. In the 1970s, Racelle exhibited her work at 55 Mercer and the SoHo Center for Visual Artists. In the 1980s she showed at the Anita Shapolsky Gallery and Haber/Theodore, both in Manhattan, as well as at Dowling College in Oakdale, NY. In addition, she participated in many group shows, at Franklin Furnace, American Abstract Artists in Westbeth, the Portland Museum of Art, the Corpus Christi Museum, the Baltimore Museum, and the Jewish Museum in New York, among others. Racelle's work is represented in the NYU Art Collection, MoMA Lending Services, and many private collections. For over 30 years, she divided her time between Manhattan and Bridgehampton, eventually moving to Bridgehampton in 1998 with her husband Peter Larkin, the noted Broadway and Hollywood production designer. In addition to her husband, Racelle is survived by her two children from her previous marriage, Ivy Hamlin of Forest Hills, and Wesley Strick of Los Angeles, her brother, Alan Kessler, of Bedford Hills, NY, and five grandchildren and two nieces who adored her.

Can voters reasonably expectthese and other indicators to changesignificantly after a new presidenttakes office in January?As important as the economymay be for voters when they go tothe polls, many economists contendthat presidents have little power overgeneral economic performance duringtheir terms of office, even though somethings, like the minimum wage, are setby the government.David Backus, an economist at NewYork University, recently wrote onthe blog of the economist N. GregoryMankiw that while presidents mightcontribute to long-term performance,the normal ups and downs of thebusiness cycle had more of an effecton the economy in the short term.''There's some debate about wherebusiness cycles come from, but thepresident's actions are rarely on thelist,'' he wrote. Changes in incomes,jobs and home prices reflect this cyclicalbehavior, while other indicators,like personal savings as a percentageof disposable income, have shown agradual decline over decades. If thereis a president to praise -- or blame --for longer-term trends, he is probablynot in office now.Kevin Feltes, associate director ofthe Jerome Levy Forecasting Centerin Mount Kisco, N.Y., said that the nextpresident would most likely be reactingto the economy -- not the other wayaround.''Given the current condition of theeconomy, the next president could verywell end up running trillions of dollarsin federal deficits over the next severalyears,'' he said, ''whether he likes itor not.''"

Either they're big and bold, as they were at Prada (right), or bleached to oblivion, as on Louis Vuitton's spring runway (below). ''Both are dynamic looks for the season,'' said the makeup artist Pat McGrath, who created the two styles. ''But they can be tricky to wear.'' So what is one to do? Go easy. ''As a general rule, I like to lighten dark brows a couple shades to open the face and give a brighter appearance,'' Ms. McGrath said, adding that brushing a blond-tone brow gel, or a concealer in a lighter shade, through the brow with a clean mascara wand would temporarily do the trick. ''With pale brows, I prefer to make them a little stronger by feathering with a pencil throughout. I use two shades, one matching and one slightly darker.''

2008-10-19T00:00:00Z,"JACOBS--Father Peter a high profile and controversial Catholic priest, passed away Sunday September 7th in Rome. The cause of death was a heart attack. Fr. ''Jake'' Jacobs was born on February 10, 1926, to a Jewish father and an Irish Catholic mother. Father Jacobs developed a lifelong affinity for Jewish religious thought and was an advocate for better relations between Catholics and Jews. His 53 years as a priest was marked by limitless generosity and dedication toward the youth, firefighters, prisoners, politicians and royalty. In 1960 he moved to NYC where he continued his true service of a much more unorthodox nature, and he dedicated his life to serving prisoners, the sick and indigent, often taking confessions in bars and other non-traditional locations. In 1982 Fr. Jacobs opened a restaurant in NYC called The Palatine, which became an instant hit. In the early 1990's he resided in Italy, maintaining close ties with the Vatican in Rome, and living in Venice near close friend Arrigo Cipriani. In March 1996 he received the D'Oro Award from the Boy's Town of Italy. In 2005, a party held at Da Silvano to honor his 50th anniversary as a priest and his 80th birthday was attended by many of his longtime associates, including Dr. Alan Kessler, Mr. Walter Cronkite, Mr. Edgar Bronfman Jr. and Yoko Ono. He is survived by two nephews, niece and second cousin, Deborah Jacobs. He will be sorely missed by those whose lives he touched so deeply and unconditionally."

Sutin of Albany, New York passed peacefully at the age of 93 on October 12, 2008 at The Daughters of Sarah Nursing Home surrounded by his loving family. Hillard was born in Albany, NY to Fannie and Morris Sutin in 1915, the youngest of six children. He attended Albany High School (1933), graduated from The University of Michigan School of Mechanical Engineering (1937), and he was a member of the Tau Beta Pi Engineering Honorary Society. He worked as Chief Mechanical Engineer in New York City and then in Philadelphia for Ingersoll Rand on defense-related contracts. With the start of the war, he enlisted in the U.S. Army Air Corps as an Aircraft Engineering Officer, repairing and maintaining military aircraft in Burma, India. After two years, he was reassigned to the Air Transport Command in Washington D.C., where as the Executive Officer, he oversaw the 45,000 personnel throughout the world assigned to the Maintenance Engineering Division. Hillard achieved the rank of Major and was honorably discharged in 1946. After almost four years in service of this country, Hillard moved to Albany and worked briefly as an engineer at Albany Castings Company in Voorheesville. He then moved to Rochester, where he was a partner in M.J. Fitzsimmons Manufacturing Corporation and shortly thereafter, he wed Ann Bakrow of Rochester (1946). Later, he partnered with Linsley Fischer to form Standard Supply Hardware Corporation, which he sold in 1960. Hillard then returned to Albany to work for his brother William, the owner Cromwell Printery. Following the sale of Cromwell, Hillard founded Capitol Microfilm Services Inc. in Schenectady, which serviced many needs of General Electric and the company became one of the largest microfilm production houses in the tri-state area. Hillard sold his business in 1982 to enter retirement. Although Hillard's passion was his family and friends, he also enjoyed reading, playing tennis and bridge, and volunteering for charitable causes. Although well into his retirement years, Hillard continued to learn new skills, including use of the internet to learn about history, politics, and business. Hillard is survived by his loving children, Judith A. Sutin, M.D. of Buffalo, NY and Ken Sutin, M.D. of New York, NY, and his nieces and nephews. Interment was held on Wednesday morning at the Temple Beth Emeth Cemetery in Loudonville, NY. In lieu of flowers, kindly consider donations to the University of Michigan School of Engineering.

About six weeks ago I'd stopped by the store with a copy of a Barneys ad featuring the dress, Exit #2 from the fall runway collection, a dress that also received tons of editorial attention. With sleeves reduced to seductive armbands, a deep slit up the left leg, and planes of stiff black fabric intersecting across the front, the dress has a very modern look. I was curious to see and touch it. Owning the dress wasn't necessarily the objective. We see a lot of great fashion on the runways, but as I've pointed out here and in several columns recently, we seemed to see less and less of these clothes in the stores. (Indeed, I interviewed Balenciaga's president Isabelle Guichot, among other chief executives, about this widening gap.)

2008-10-21T00:00:00Z,"An article on Thursday about Kris Jenkins, a nose tackle for the Jets who developed a passion for cooking while growing up in a single-parent household headed by his father, misspelled the father’s given name.

2008-10-21T00:00:00Z,"An article on Saturday about Tampa Bay’s resilience against the Boston Red Sox late in the regular season and during the American League Championship Series referred incorrectly to the circumstances of the Rays’ 2-1 victory over the Red Sox on Sept. 16. Dioner Navarro hit a single in the ninth inning of that game to lift Tampa Bay; his teammate Dan Johnson did not hit a home run to tie the score in the ninth. (Johnson did, however, hit a ninth-inning homer in a 5-4 win against Boston on Sept. 9.)."
2008-10-21T00:00:00Z,"A Sports of The Times column on Monday, about the success of the young Tampa Bay Rays against the more experienced Red Sox in the American League Championship Series, misstated, in some copies, Boston’s winning streak before Sunday night in postseason games when facing elimination.

2008-10-21T00:00:00Z,"Because of an editing error, an article on Saturday about concerns over the safety of metal bats in youth baseball referred incorrectly in some editions to a test used by Little League to evaluate bats called Bat Performance Factor. It is considered by its creator, Richard A. Brandt, to be a true gauge of a bat even though it does not account for swing speed or the outgoing speed of the ball. Brandt does not view it as an untrue gauge because of those factors. The error was repeated in some editions in a caption for a photograph of Brandt, a New York University physics professor who created the test in the mid-1990s. Because of an editing error, the professor’s surname was also misspelled as Brant in one instance in some editions."
2008-10-21T00:00:00Z,"An article in the Itineraries pages last Tuesday reported about the increasing stress on business travelers, and cited the findings of “Stress in America,” an annual survey of the American Psychological Association.

His father, whom he never really knew, was the quantum physicist Hugh Everett III, who in 1957 proposed what came to be known as the ''many worlds'' theory: that every time a human makes a decision, a parallel universe splits off from his or her everyday reality. Ridiculed at the time, the multiple-universe theory has since been explored by renowned physicists and inspired pop-culture creations like ''Star Trek'' and the trilogy ''His Dark Materials.'' In this ''Nova'' episode Mark Everett retraces his father's footsteps, meeting with his college friends (above), colleagues and admirers, including the Massachusetts Institute of Technology physicist Max Tegmark, and tries to understand how his father's mind worked and why he seemed to retreat to his own parallel universe. 9 A.M.

A true New Yorker, ''Jim'' was born on First St. & First Ave. and moved ''uptown'' to Second St. which he used to say was ''a very long trip.'' He left home at an early age, and lived with various alternative communities and friends in the village in the 1970s. School did not agree with him, but early on he showed huge talent in both building things, and creating beautiful drawings and paintings. He was one of the original NYC homesteaders, fixing up an uninhabitable building and acquiring it from the city along with his neighbors, making it into a ''sweat equity'' coop. He renovated numerous apartments in Manhattan, and worked as a studio assistant in recent years. This summer he traveled to the California desert to work on a special installation with old friend Randy Polumbo. Jim's loyalty, dependability, and humor will be missed by friends and family alike. His wonderful paintings will be exhibited in California later this year at Art Queen in Joshua Tree. There will be a service at Middle Collegiate Church at 50 East 7th Street on October 25 at 1pm with a reception after.

He called a timeout just before Jay Feely's field goal late in regulation. Feely missed, but Cable's move allowed him another attempt, which he made. Stefan Fatsis, author of ''A Few Seconds of Panic,'' an account of his George Plimpton-style tryout as a Denver Broncos kicker, said Tuesday that kickers had told him that ''icing'' them doesn't work. He said in an e-mail message: ''But they're happy to let opposing coaches think it does. Jason Elam, the Broncos' kicker when I spent training camp with the team, said the few extra moments afforded by a timeout gives kickers more time to prepare. They can better consider wind, distance and ball placement, and take a few more practice swings.''"

Instead, they were some of the growing number of triathletes and runners wearing compression socks, tight over-the-calf socks that are migrating from the medical therapy world to athletics. At Kona, 415 of the 1,677 competitors in the run portion of the race wore the socks, said Chris Bohannon of the triathlon gear manufacturer Zoot. They wore them to increase blood flow, supposedly supplying lower leg muscles with more oxygen and more evenly distributing muscle strain. Compression socks were originally used by diabetics, pregnant women and travelers seeking better circulation and preventing blood clots."

A true New Yorker, ''Jim'' was born on First St. & First Ave. and moved ''uptown'' to Second St. which he used to say was ''a very long trip.'' He left home at an early age, and lived with various alternative communities and friends in the village in the 1970s. School did not agree with him, but early on he showed huge talent in both building things, and creating beautiful drawings and paintings. He was one of the original NYC homesteaders, fixing up an uninhabitable building and acquiring it from the city along with his neighbors, making it into a ''sweat equity'' coop. He renovated numerous apartments in Manhattan, and worked as a studio assistant in recent years. This summer he traveled to the California desert to work on a special installation with old friend Randy Polumbo. Jim's loyalty, dependability, and humor will be missed by friends and family alike. His wonderful paintings will be exhibited in California later this year at Art Queen in Joshua Tree.

Hal, a politically conservative entertainment lawyer, was a man of apparent contradictions. For over thirtyfive years, the registered Republican was the principal lawyer and general counsel for the seminal 60s rock band, the Grateful Dead. Hal created and oversaw the various corporations that managed the day-to-day business of the legendary band; his guiding hand is credited with preserving the band's enduring legacy and their valuable intellectual property, including ownership of their music masters and publishing rights (a rare feat in the early days of rock 'n roll music). So domineering was Hal's influence within the band, Jerry Garcia and the band emblazoned his Grateful Dead business cards with the simple title, ''Czar.'' Despite Hal's reputation as one of the most prominent and pioneering of music lawyers, the Grateful Dead were only a small part of Hal's diverse international business and legal practice. A devotee of classical opera, Hal was also an accomplished amateur poker player. In 1987, Hal won the World Series of Poker. In 1973, Hal coauthored the groundbreaking monograph, Pornography and Sexual Deviance, with Michael J. Goldstein and John J. Hartman; he continued to write numerous white papers throughout his career. Born in the Bronx, New York on July 29, 1931, Hal attended DeWitt Clinton High School before pursuing his undergraduate degree at CCNY and the University of Washington. Hal obtained his masters degree in psychology from Penn State University. In 1958, Hal graduated with honors from Harvard University Law School. After law school, Hal clerked for the esteemed Judge William Orr of the U.S. Ct of Appeals for the 9th Circuit. Hal had a passion for skiing, golf, painting, and was an avid art collector. Above all, he was a caring and generous man who had a strong influence on those who had the opportunity to know him. Hal is survived by his wife, Jesse Kant, his sons, Garth, Tony, and Jonas (Lucy); his sisters, Charlotte Silverman and Thelma Sameth; his stepchildren, Cameron Cassidy Sloane (Robin) and Sean Cassidy (Andrea); his grandchildren Ashlyn, Austin, Eva, Samantha, Trevor; and his many nieces and nephews.

2008-10-25T00:44:46Z,"Re ""Keeping Their Opinions to Themselves"" (Oct. 19): Please, you do protest too much. My mother, a lifelong Democrat who is turning 100 years old, reads The New York Times every day, and she can't believe the obvious bias of the paper.First the paper was wildly anti-Hillary Rodham Clinton, while supporting her - in a blatant and laughable way. Then the Obama Nation rose, and your slant became acute.As a child of the Sixties, I thought we had all the answers and that the politicians and policies we supported were ""golden,"" as my kids would say today. Instead, after reading a great deal of history, I have seen that the presidents who often get the best ratings are the ones who manage for events to fall apart just after they leave - a bit like the next year's teacher being saddled with curriculum not yet covered.My mother often remarks that The Times thought Ronald Reagan was an idiot, governing with the help of Nancy Reagan's astrologer, until he died and we discovered that The Times thought he saved the free world!Well, did he or did he not? It's the time lapse that settles your opinion page.The extreme bias of the paper's articles and opinion pages serves no purpose other than to rabble-rouse, and that the paper has done wonderfully well. Why not answer some questions we still discuss after dinner, for example, about the real relationship choices of Barack Obama, the myriad odd characters who have peopled his past?Does wanting to know these things mean we are biased against Mr. Obama - or does not covering them mean The Times is biased for Mr. Obama? HmmMarilyn ElkinMontreal, Oct. 19, 2008 ● The blurb for your column reads: ""Everyone is biased. That means reporters and readers too.""The challenge remains with the senior management of The Times to clearly define a separation between news reporting and offering opinions within a news article. This subject has previously been discussed in the public editor's column, yet The Times seems to have avoided taking decisive steps to resolve the controversy.I thought editors reviewed each news article. If so, why aren't the editors making changes when the reporter offers opinions rather than reporting news?Don TenerowiczEllington, Conn., Oct. 19, 2008 ● I believe I found the reason for the anger (on all sides) with the mainstream media in your column, and I do think that it lies where you placed it. You wrote: ""But the paper's news coverage is another matter. It is supposed to be evenhanded.""Evenhanded? I thought news was meant to be accurate, factual: what happened, who said what, whether what was said was truthful when checked against fact and public record.What on earth has ""evenhanded"" got to do with news? Can one be evenhanded about what causes H.I.V., about the age of the Earth, about the number of deaths in the Vietnam War? The goal should be accuracy, a clear presentation of the facts as best known and the limitations or gaps in what is known, not evenhandedness, as if the truth and its negation were equal contenders in some popularity contest.The reason ""balance"" is an issue on news pages is that front-page journalism has shifted toward opinion, using cute, snarky words that are loaded in meaning. Here is a testable hypothesis: if we turned a computational linguist to a semantic analysis of the front page and the opinion page of The Times over the past 50 years, we would see opinion and value-laden words (descriptors with positive or negative implications) steadily increasing.By the way, as a scientist, I take affront at the quote that journalism is harder than brain surgery. We might all be better off if journalists on the news pages were more about the facts and about trying to find the information than about cleverness, opinion and ""palling around"" with the power elite. Then journalism might really be ""hard.""Linda SmithBloomington, Ind., Oct. 19, 2008 ● ●Re ""Urgent Issues, Buried in the Mud"" (Oct. 12): I think you are being too hard on The Times's news and campaign editors when you argue that more of their coverage should be about policy and that too much of the coverage focuses on ""the horse race, political tactics, polls and the like.""You say that about 10 percent of coverage is on policy, while what's left is on that other stuff. But does ""the like"" include the series of compelling human interest articles about the candidates and their wives, for example, that help give readers insight into the candidates' character and how they might govern as president?This is, after all, a political campaign, which, like a military campaign, includes strategic and tactical dimensions that are as important as the policy issues driving the decisions of voters.I, for one, welcome the analyses of campaign advertisements, which may count in the ""horse race"" column but also provide clarification of policy issues as they fact-check each ad's assertions.Let's not forget that voters have many sources of information these days, including cable TV and the Internet. I'm not depending on The Times for all of my campaign coverage, and I value The Times for the kind of coverage it provides.Michael BroderBrooklyn, Oct. 13, 2008 ● I do believe that people told the Pew Research Center for the People and the Press that ""they wanted more coverage of the candidates' stands on issues."" But look at the articles and columns that show up on The Times's ""Most Popular"" lists on its Web site. What people actually read and send to each other is the horse race and commentary content of the paper, not the substantive content.I thank The Times for doing a better job than most at giving us excellent information and analysis of the things that matter, but, so far, doing so has not made the readership more responsible about actually consuming what matters. Meanwhile, I don't blame journalists as much as many do for printing and broadcasting what we're mostly getting. It's what we've asked for.J. Christy WarehamNewark, N.Y., Oct. 12, 2008 ● I was surprised to learn that even The Times is underreporting the content of issues in this year's campaign season. It is unfortunate when style is confused for substance. Members of the electorate need to make informed decisions when they vote.Would it be too much to ask that reporters follow a framework in their reporting? Campaign articles could report on four dimensions: (1) issues (proposals, including practical and political implications), (2) the race (polling and statements from the campaigns), (3) fact checking and (4) competence.Brian GaleBronx, Oct. 13, 2008 ● But it's even worse than that.The problem would seem to be that newspapers send most of their senior reporters around with the campaigns, ensuring that the reporting is about the race and the tactics, not the issues.Why waste senior reporters on collecting statements and reactions from campaigns and stitching together the usual he said-he said piece? Is it about journalism, or about the perks and proximity to power and its seductions?I've come to believe that the mainstream media like to get the coverage wrong so that they have something to write about in December and January. But I won't be reading it.Kevin McNamaraHouston, Oct. 12, 2008 ● We all recognize that television ""news"" has been transformed from information to entertainment, a 24/7 version of an infomercial.I read The Times and The Washington Post every day to actually obtain important aspects of the events of the world. You accurately reflect my frustration with the refocused election coverage: from defining and clarifying issues to a discussion of election-year tactics and the horse race.William CorinSarasota, Fla., Oct. 12, 2008 ● I agree with your assessment that The Times (and most of the news media) have not covered the substantial issues of the presidential race adequately.One suggestion: for a month before the primary and the presidential elections, The Times should devote an entire page to a daily question about an important national issue. Each of the candidates should be provided with equal space to provide detailed answers to the question of the day. The answers should be printed in their entirety. This suggestion could also be applied to state and local races and would provide readers who are interested in learning more about the candidates' stands on issues with the information they want. A side benefit: if TV stations and other daily papers followed this lead, there would be less expensive campaigns.Paul FeinerTown SupervisorGreenburgh, N.Y., Oct. 12, 2008 ● While I do wish that the news media in general and newspapers in particular would focus more on policy issues than some of the things out of left field, I do understand that sometimes that is all that the campaigns produce.For example, more people were talking recently about Gov. Sarah Palin's outrageous suggestion that Barack Obama is friendly with a domestic terrorist than either candidate's ideas on how to solve the economic crisis our country is facing.That is sad for the campaign's dialogue, and sad for the country.We need to speak about the economy and other issues important to Americans, and not something that happened when Mr. Obama was 8 years old!Steven M. ClaytonOcean, N.J., Oct. 12, 2008 ● ●Re ""Political Scorekeeping"" (Oct. 5): Scorekeeping indeed. Why are you giving in to the idea that ""fair and balanced"" reporting can be achieved by counting the number of articles or their placement in the paper?Balance is not the issue. Coverage of important issues, backed by competent investigative reporting, is.The Times should correct the facts if it got them wrong, state its opinions as opinions and not succumb to this right-wing whining. If there's a crime wave in Brooklyn, is it unfair not to mention the burglary in the Bronx? Not in my book. One is news, the other isn't.Give us your best shot at fair and factual. Leave balance to the scales of justice.Mary FellowsPortland, Ore., Oct. 5, 2008 ● Your rationale that the number of enterprise or investigative articles in The Times has been balanced is hard to swallow.Late August to the beginning of October:John McCain - 9Barack Obama - 4Front page, McCain - 4Front page, Obama - 1You say that ""The Times has published more tough articles on Obama, 20, than on McCain, 13, since the beginning of last year."" As though a reader remembers everything written last year?The comparison should be post-Labor Day articles, and they are quite imbalanced in Mr. Obama's favor.Glen SkovholtSt. Paul, Oct. 6, 2008 ● You present a good case that Times articles critical of Senator Barack Obama and Senator John McCain are fairly even. But most of those critical of Mr. Obama ended long past, while the news, editorial and Op-Ed articles and columns critical of Mr. McCain and Gov. Sarah Palin are quite current.We all know that what occurs in the month before the election has about as much weight with the electorate as all the prior information.Why not publish a summary of the policy statements of each presidential candidate, but also the negatives of each?Why do this? Many of us Republicans have an uneasy feeling about Mr. Obama's past and his money sources, many parts of which have not received much scrutiny by The Times or the press in general. A summary of his and Mr. McCain's positions and the pros and cons would give us all the ""balance sheet"" before the election. J. M. Van MetreAlexandria, Va., Oct. 8, 2008 ● A certain strain of irrationality has crept into this presidential campaign. The kinds of complaints that you must surely be tediously sifting through this election season I suspect come from people who wish newspapers did not even exist, let alone journalists who do their job well by uncovering even the most trivial of a politician's more glaring faults.Don StacyKunming City, China, Oct. 5, 2008 ● Your comparison of the number of investigative reports on Barack Obama versus John McCain started by using accurate data, then obfuscated that data with misleading statistics.To go back to early 2007 to begin a count of investigative articles demonstrates the tortuous road even you will take to stretch the truth. I'll go one up on you. I suspect that many of The Times's articles in 2007 about Mr. McCain were positive. Of course they were - The Times eventually endorsed him in the primary.What matters now is the information The Times gives readers to help them understand the current presidential race. Based on your own count, The Times's emphasis has been blatantly anti-McCain. To dilute that clear fact by referring to articles published last year was a deliberate and shameful tactic to mislead readers. I'm not sure whether to be angry or sad at your methods, but I am disappointed.Gene GambalePalm Desert, Calif., Oct. 6, 2008 ● Your column about coverage of the presidential campaign proudly touts how many more investigative articles were done on Senator Barack Obama than on Senator John McCain. But you distorted this by including in your total articles from the beginning of last year to the present.For most of this period, Mr. Obama was running against Senator Hillary Rodham Clinton for the Democratic presidential nomination, not against John McCain.The Times's bias during that period of time was for Mrs. Clinton and against Mr. Obama, but the paper abruptly changed to focus its investigative articles on Mr. McCain once the nomination was decided.Nice try!Ken MartinVirginia Beach, Va., Oct. 6, 2008 ● It is of great concern and no surprise to me that as you mention, The Times has actually published more ""tough"" articles on Barack Obama and Joseph R. Biden Jr. than on John McCain or Sarah Palin.In just the last few days alone, there has been an overall tone - in articles on Ms. Palin's unsubstantiated accusations of guilt by association, for example - and photo captions containing unrelated and undermining innuendo that serve to cast doubt on Mr. Obama's trustworthiness, while burying the exonerating lead.By contrast, the language and images used to cover Ms. Palin's feisty delivery of whoppers seem admiring and unquestioning.In its attempt to remain impartial and not slant its reporting in favor of the candidate I presume the editorial page will endorse, The Times goes too far in the opposite direction and is instead undermining Mr. Obama's campaign.Susan LichtensteinBelmont, Mass., Oct. 6, 2008"

Now, as Senator John McCain and Senator Barack Obama head into the final week before the election, the speeches have become a back-and-forth on taxes, the economy and a man in the plumbing business named Joe. Both of the speeches analyzed here were given on Tuesday; Mr. Obama's was in Miami and Mr. McCain's in Bensalem, Pa. Mr. Obama's remarks were crafted by Jon Favreau, his chief speechwriter, and a team of other writers. Like Mr. McCain's recent addresses, Mr. Obama's are now delivered with the aid of a teleprompter -- largely so his message of the day, typically a fresh criticism of Mr. McCain, is delivered intact."

Born in Boulogne, France to parents Colette and Claude Aubert, Corinne grew up moving around France with her two sisters Laurence and Nathalie. She began studying in Hippocagne but her powerful, charismatic character drove her towards bigger and better things. She proceeded to complete her bachelor's degrees in Art History and Literature. She met my father, Kevin Goering, in Bordeaux where he was studying the French language. Together, they packed up and ventured to America to begin a new life in the Promised Land. My mother proceeded to begin her work at Yves Saint Laurent, Rive Gauche. She ended her 20 year career in the fashion industry when I, demanding little toddler that I was, kept her home for myself. Mom was a beautiful, intelligent and energetic woman. She particularly enjoyed dragging me on long walks in the wilderness of the Catskills as well as teaching and helping others. This year, she was working with the old and dying to put a stop to suffering and pain. She was full of generosity and compassion for people in general because of how much she had been through herself; she was a tough cookie. This is the one thing she couldn't get through. I write this today with a hint of humor and uplifting thoughts because I do not wish for her to be remembered because she died, but because of the beautiful life that she led.

Even in politically hostile places like Michigan, he has urged voters to accept the reality of a global economy. Experts say he has deviated little from the Bush administration on specific trade deals, except by emphasizing ''trade adjustment assistance,'' a mechanism designed to cushion displaced workers. His advisers say Mr. McCain's focus on that issue stemmed from an emotional encounter during his 2000 presidential campaign with a man who was losing his job in a South Carolina textile mill. ''McCain told his advisers they needed to do more than strike a message of free trade,'' said his current economic adviser, Douglas Holtz-Eakin.

She began studying in Hippocagne but her powerful, charismatic character drove her towards bigger and better things. She proceeded to complete her bachelor's degrees in Art History and Literature. She met my father, Kevin Goering, in Bordeaux where he was studying the French language. Together, they packed up and ventured to America to begin a new life in the Promised Land. My mother proceeded to begin her work at Yves Saint Laurent, Rive Gauche. She ended her 20 year career in the fashion industry when I, demanding little toddler that I was, kept her home for myself. Mom was a beautiful, intelligent and energetic woman. She particularly enjoyed dragging me on long walks in the wilderness of the Catskills as well as teaching and helping others. This year, she was working with the old and dying to put a stop to suffering and pain. She was full of generosity and compassion for people in general because of how much she had been through herself; she was a tough cookie. This is the one thing she couldn't get through.

2008-10-26T00:00:00Z,"SENATOR MCCAIN would upend the tax treatment of health benefits in order to give all consumers the same advantages, whether they purchase insurance through employers or not. He would eliminate the provision that allows workers to exclude their employer-sponsored benefits from taxable income, replacing it with tax credits worth $2,500 per individual and $5,000 per family. He also would let consumers purchase policies across state lines. The McCain campaign argues that the tax changes will stoke competition in the individual market, lower prices and make coverage more affordable for the uninsured. Those with pre-existing health conditions who cannot obtain private insurance would be covered through a ''guaranteed access plan.'' It would put federal dollars behind the kinds of high-risk pools that currently operate in many states, often with inadequate financing."

2008-10-26T00:00:00Z,"SENATOR MCCAIN draws a snappy chant from supporters at his rallies -- ''drill, baby, drill'' -- but his approach is broader and more nuanced. He does support increased and immediate oil exploration on public lands and off the coasts. But unlike his running mate, Gov. Sarah Palin of Alaska, and many other Republicans, he opposes oil exploration in the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge. Mr. McCain advocates adding as many as 45 nuclear power plants, which would reduce consumption of fossil fuels, chiefly coal and oil, and the greenhouse gases they release that are the main culprits in global warming. He says that the Navy's 50-year history with nuclear-powered ships proves that the technology is safe. Mr. McCain supports increased use of renewable energy sources like wind, solar, geothermal and hydroelectric, but opposes large government subsidies for them, saying the market, not the government, should decide which new technologies are most promising. SENATOR OBAMA said he believes oil companies should exploit existing leases on public lands and off the coasts before new areas are opened to drilling. He, too, opposes drilling in the Alaska refuge. Unlike Mr. McCain, he supports a windfall profits tax on oil companies. Mr. Obama does not oppose expansion of nuclear power in principle, but says it must be done safely and economically, considerations that for decades have halted construction of nuclear plants. Mr. Obama advocates spending $15 billion a year for the next 10 years to develop alternative-energy businesses, which he says will produce millions of new jobs. Mr. Obama, who is from Illinois, a big corn-producing state, supports federal subsidies for ethanol production. He also supports requiring utilities to produce about 20 percent of their electricity from renewable sources by 2020. And he backs higher fuel-efficiency standards for cars and trucks."

Born in New York in 1910, Martin won scholarships and worked his way through Cornell University, becoming editor of the yearbook, and through Columbia Law School, where he was editor-in-chief of the Law Review. Graduating from law school in the depths of the depression in 1934, he was recruited by Abe Fortas and William O. Douglas (both would become Supreme Court Justices) to join them at the new Securities and Exchange Commission, where he became director of the division governing the mergers and acquisitions of large corporations. An ensign in the Navy Air Force in World War II, he was on leave when his sister introduced him to her office manager, Anne Cohen. Immediately smitten, he proposed on his next leave. By war's end, he had a wife, two daughters, and the rank of lieutenant commander. After the war, he joined Federated Department Stores in Cincinnati and eventually became their general counsel. At age 59, he ''retired'' and became a law professor at Georgetown University Law School and ''of counsel'' to the law firm of Arnold & Porter. He cared deeply about legal ethics, writing articles decrying golden parachutes and other controversial practices. His wife Anne died at a hospice in Florida in 1994. At a memorial service for the relatives of those who had recently died at that hospice, he met his second wife, Elsie. He wore two wedding rings to commemorate two happy marriages. Martin was a painter and photographer, and loved music, art, ballet, and great literature, enjoying to his final days his beloved Mozart. In addition to his daughters and sons-in-law, Andrea (Andrew) and Stephanie (Dan), he is survived by his sister, Edith Berman, his grandchildren Adam, Scott, Matthew and Jake, and his dear friend, Hana Heller.

From the first group, there was Meg Whitman, the former chief executive of eBay, and David Farr, her counterpart at Emerson Electric; from the second came Gov. Tim Pawlenty of Minnesota and Mitt Romney, the former Massachusetts governor who ran against Mr. McCain in the primaries on a platform that emphasized his business experience."

2008-10-28T00:00:00Z,"SAX--Alice (nee Fisher), passed away peacefully on October 26, 2008, surrounded by her immediate family and the thoughts and prayers of her many friends from around the world. Beloved wife of Karl, mother to Wendy and Rick, Alice embraced the world with a passion for life and devotion to her family and friends. Her journey began in Kerhonksen, NY on May 15, 1928 as the youngest of 10 siblings. She was educated at SUNY Albany and Teachers College, Columbia University. Shortly after marrying, she moved to Okinawa, then to Frankfurt, Germany, where she was a teacher and counselor in the DoDDS system for over 35 years. On retiring to her present home in King of Prussia, PA, Alice continued her love for travel, exercise, bridge, politics, and healthy food, and discovered e-mail as the way to remain in touch with her many farflung friends. Those whom she touched will always remember her for keen insight, compassion, and grace with dignity. She will be terribly missed, yet with a smile, for all the fond memories she created in living her life so fully and with such love. Alice is survived by her children, her sister Ethel ''Boots'' Fisher, and her grandchildren, Emily, Jonathan and Jamie. In lieu of flowers, donations in Alice's name can be made to ORT, 75 Maiden Lane, 10th Floor, New York, NY 10038 or the American Association for Cancer Research Foundation, 615 Chestnut Street, 17th Floor, Philadelphia, PA 19106."

It was not entirely clear from the start exactly how Mr. Paulson would ensure that things would go that way. Indeed, earlier this month, shortly after the bailout was enacted, The Times's Mark Landler reported that Treasury officials also wanted to steer the bailout billions to banks that would use the money to buy up other banks."

2008-10-29T00:00:00Z,"REINER--Estelle. Jazz singer, painter, and wife of comedy legend, Carl Reiner for 64 years, died on Saturday, October 25 at the age of 94. A talented artist and singer, Estelle was most widely known for the famous line -''I'll have what she's having,'' in son, Rob Reiner's film, ''When Harry Met Sally''. As an artist she had four one-woman shows of her paintings in the 1970's and at the age of 65 embarked on a new career as a jazz singer. Undeterred by any of the usual constraints of age, anxiety and later, illness, she developed her innate musical gifts and continued performing in clubs in New York and Los Angeles until the remarkable age of 93. Early in her new found career, the noted jazz critic, Leonard Feather, said of her work, ''Her bittersweet timbre suggests honey laced with vinegar. She has qualities many a seasoned pro would envy.'' A. James Liska of the Daily News in New York, wrote, ''she has wise and knowing phrasing, and a dry, wry, sly wit...'', and talented singer/songwriter, Dave Frishberg wrote, ''I feel comfortable entrusting my songs to Estelle Reiner, whose musicality shines through every track.'' She was a true original, a jazz stylist, part of whose repertoire included quirky, little known old jazz and blues songs which reflected her personal humor and uniqueness. Although she sang sweet ballads and standards, she fell in love with the Blues as a teenager, frequenting the Apollo Theater in Harlem, and did not shy away from raunchy old blues tunes such as, ''Handy Man,'' ''You Can Have My Husband (But Please Don't Take My Man''). Her friend, Dom Deluise never stopped talking admiringly about her sexy rendition of ''Don't You Feel My Leg,'' when well into her 80's. Jazz afficionado, David Chasman, also the former production head at United Artists, wrote of Estelle, ''More than innate musicality, more than seductiveness of voice, it is Estelle's undisguised, unequivocal, unabashed, unmistakable love for the songs that she sings, which makes her irresistible to her audience''. Her courage and determination also resulted in seven CD's, including, ''Ukulele Mama'', and a charming collection of standards called ''Grown Up Songs For Kids''. After raising her three children, acclaimed actor/director, Rob, Annie, a gifted writer and psychoanalyst, and Lucas, a painter whose work shows in the U.S. and Europe, Reiner began a career as a performer, studying with Viola Spolin and Lee Strasberg, and was soon cast in ''Fatso'', the directorial debut of her old friend, Anne Bancroft. Subsequently, she had a small part in Mel Brooks' film, ''To Be Or Not To Be'', and went on to do other performances in TV and film, including the often repeated line in ''When Harry Met Sally''. Born in Bronx, New York in 1914, the former Estelle Lebost graduated the National Academy of Design in the late 1930's and during World War II she was the first woman isometric draftsman to work at Sperry Rand, making blueprints for assembly workers building submarines and airplanes. She and Carl Reiner married on Christmas Eve, 1943, when Reiner was on a weekend pass from the Army. Her friends and family will remember her as a free thinker who never stopped searching, a courageous woman of extraordinary spirit and curiosity who lived life to the end. In addition to her children and husband, she also leaves nephews George Shapiro and Donny Shapiro, and five grandchildren, Jake, Nick and Romy Reiner, Livia and Rose Reiner. The family requests that in lieu of flowers, donations be made to Save The Children."

The former officer, Arthur Tesler, faces more than 10 years in prison on a charge of conspiracy to violate civil rights resulting in death. The police originally said officers had gone to the home of the woman, Kathryn Johnston, in northwest Atlanta, in 2006 after an informant said he had bought drugs there. But after finding none, officers tried to cover up the mistake by planting bags of marijuana, prosecutors said. In May, Mr. Tesler, 42, was sentenced to four and a half years in prison for lying to investigators, but federal prosecutors decided to pursue more charges after reviewing the case."

They must keep their outside lights off and post a sign saying they are not distributing candy. They may not have any Halloween-related contact with children. A three-judge panel of the United States Court of Appeals for the Eighth Circuit stayed a lower court&#8217;s ruling blocking parts of the law until it could consider the state&#8217;s appeal and rule on the merits &#151; sometime before next Halloween. The stay had been sought by Gov. Matt Blunt, a Republican, and Attorney General Jay Nixon, above, a Democrat, after the lower-court ruling in the case brought by four sex offenders sued over the law. &#8220;This stay comes not a moment too soon, as hundreds of thousands of Missouri children prepare to go trick-or-treating,&#8221; Mr. Nixon said."

2008-11-01T00:00:00Z,"BARON--Frederick Martin, devoted husband, loving father, trailblazing lawyer, and champion of the working man, died peacefully at his Dallas home on October 30, 2008 after a long battle with cancer. A memorial service will be held on Monday, November 3, 2008 at 4:00pm at Sparkman-Hillcrest Funeral Home to celebrate Fred's memory. Fred was born in Cedar Rapids, Iowa in 1947. He moved with his mother to the central Texas town of Smithville at the age of 15, where he excelled in his studies and was a high school football star. He received a Bachelor of Arts degree from the University of Texas and then attended the University of Texas School of Law, where he was an editor of the law review. While in law school, he spent a summer in Washington, DC working for consumer advocate Ralph Nader, and developed a commitment to improving the plight of working men and women in this country. Upon his graduation from law school in 1971 he took a job with the law firm of Mullinax, Wells, and Mauzy, one of the few firms in Texas that represented labor unions and union workers. Among his early clients were Karen Silkwood, who alerted the public to unsafe practices at a nuclear power plant in Oklahoma, and Herbert Yandle, who developed cancer after working with asbestos at a manufacturing plant outside Tyler, Texas. Fred quickly developed a nationwide reputation for his expertise and skill in representing workers who had developed occupational illnesses. He formed his own law firm, now known as Baron & Budd, in 1977, which specialized in representing victims of occupational disease and industrial pollution. Fred was a pioneer in uncovering the harm caused to the public by the use of asbestos-containing products, and successfully represented thousands of individuals who had become sick or who had lost loved ones as a result of asbestos exposure. Other landmark cases include his representation of 1,600 residents of Tucson, Arizona who became sick because of their exposure to groundwater contaminated by the chemical TCE; his advocacy on behalf of several hundred West Dallas children who lived under the shadow of a lead smelter that polluted their neighborhood; and residents of the towns of Apollo and Parks Township, Pennsylvania who were exposed to radioactive emissions in an area near a nuclear plant. Fred also has been credited for his efforts in challenging abusive class action settlements in which corporations attempted to settle their liability for a fraction of what individuals would otherwise be entitled to recover in the courts. Fred twice led successful battles in the United States Supreme Court to defeat such settlements, and as a result, future victims of toxic injuries can no longer have their rights compromised by class action settlements in which they have no voice. In addition to his representation of individual clients, Fred was a tireless public advocate for workers and consumers. Together with Ralph Nader and several other prominent lawyers, he founded Trial Lawyers for Public Justice in 1982, and served as that organizations president from 1997 through 1998. Fred was a devoted supporter of the consumer group Public Citizen and a founding board member of the American Constitution Society. In 2000, Fred was elected president of the Association of Trial Lawyers of America (now known as the American Association for Justice), an organization with 60,000 members dedicated to safeguarding victims rights, strengthening the civil justice system, and improving public health and safety. The awards and honors Fred received during his legal career are too numerous to list in full. In 2006, the National Law Journal named Fred one of the 100 Most Influential Lawyers in the U.S. On November 3, 2005, he received the Outstanding Service Award given by the William Wayne Justice Center for Public Interest Law at the University of Texas School of Law. In June 2000, the legal publication ''Texas Lawyer'' named him as a lawyer who helped shape Texas law in its series ''Legal Legends: A Century of Texas Law and Lawyering.'' Fred was mentor and inspiration to scores of young lawyers who became effective advocates for the less fortunate in their own right. He was a loyal supporter of the University of Texas School of Law. In 2001, the law school honored Fred by endowing the Frederick M. Baron Chair in Law, which is held by a senior professor of the law school engaged in original research on lawyering and the civil justice system. Fred turned his full attention to his life-long love of politics in 2003. He served as advisor to John Edwards that year, and in 2004 he headed the general election finance team of the John Kerry-John Edwards presidential ticket. He served as national finance chair of Senator Edwards' campaign for the Democratic nomination for President in 2008. He was involved in local politics as well, founding the Texas Democratic Trust in 2005. The success of the Trust has led many to credit Fred with single-handedly reviving the Democratic Party in Dallas County. Fred was widely known and admired for his charitable work. With his wife Lisa, he founded the Baron and Blue Foundation in 2002 to help non-profit organizations fight the problems of homelessness and displacement and to promote the needs of the underserved. The foundation distributed more than $300,000 in grants in the year 2008 alone. Fred dedicated his time and energy as well as his money to help the less fortunate. In the aftermath of Hurricane Katrina, he spent many days at Reunion Arena consoling and counseling the victims, bringing them food and toiletries, and helping them out however he could. In lieu of flowers, donations can be made to the Texas Democratic Trust, at texasdemocratictrust.com or the Lance Armstrong Foundation at www.livestrong.org. Survivors include his wife, Lisa Blue-Baron; son Andrew Baron of New York, daughter Courtney Baron, her husband, Brad Singer, Courtney's daughter Liza also of New York; daughters, Alessandra, Caroline, and Nathalie; brother Robert of Oklahoma City and sister Joan of Dallas; and countless colleagues, former employees, clients, courtroom adversaries, and others who admired Fred's accomplishments, dedication, spirit, and enormous heart."

Safire correctly explains that verbal tics are typically unconscious — essentially mental hiccups manifested involuntarily in speech, typically arising from nervous tension. An example would be Obama’s occasional “you know,” hiccupped reflexively as “yo.” Obama’s “distraction” and McCain’s “my friends,” by contrast, are not nervous tics; they’re deliberate word choices reflecting conscious preference, whether used habitually or occasionally. Viewed this way, they’re fodder for a Safire column that instead of dismissing a candidate’s wording preferences as superficial spasms explores their underlying psychology, political objectives and ultimate effectiveness."

It opens Nov. 18 at New York’s Manhattan Theater Club. . . . $1,350 is pretty steep for a book, but if that book is one of 200 numbered copies of “GUTS AND GLORY: THE GOLDEN AGE OF AMERICAN FOOTBALL, 1958-1978” (Taschen), which culls the best of the legendary sports photographer Neil Leifer’s 10,000 rolls of football photos and comes swaddled in a custom slipcase, well. . . . When undefeated Harvard (the home of Al Gore) scored 16 points in the final minute to tie undefeated Yale (perhaps mourning the recent graduation of George W. Bush) in 1968, the next morning’s Harvard Crimson declared, “HARVARD BEATS YALE 29-29.” That’s the title of this quirky documentary by Bush’s cousin, Kevin Rafferty, about the most famous football game ever played between the two academic powerhouses. It opens in New York Nov. 19. . . . Last but not least, gather your man-friends and settle in for a triple feature of (mostly) teary sports triumphs — “HOOSIERS,” “ROCKY II” AND “BULL DURHAM” — to be released Nov. 4 in a single box by MGM ($25).

He had a life-long interest in marine biology and the preservation of sea life. He participated in seafaring expeditions throughout the world, leading the Yale Seychelles Expedition from the Atlantic to the Indian Oceans and the east coast of Africa. In 1971 he was awarded the International Oceanographic Foundation Marine Science Award for outstanding contributions. An enthusiastic supporter of Texas wildlife and conservation, with the help of friends the Alfred C. Glassell, Jr. Professorship in Quail Research was established at the Caesar Kleberg Wildlife Research Institute. Quail season at Buena Suerte near Falfurrias was legendary, famous for plentiful coveys and gentlemanly sportsmanship. An avid sportsman, Alfred C. Glassell, Jr. achieved fame as one of the foremost anglers in the world. In 1953, he set the world record for the largest marlin ever caught on a hand-held rod and reel. At 1,560 pounds, this record remains today, and the worlds largest game fish resides on view at the Smithsonian Institution. A tribute to his skills, he was pictured on the cover of Sports Illustrated in 1954 and inducted into the International Game Fish Associations Hall of Fame in 2001. In addition to business, military, scientific, and sports achievements, he distinguished himself as a civic leader and philanthropist. Over a lifetime, he dedicated his time and resources to the Houston Museum of Natural Science, Houston Symphony Society, Society for Performing Arts, Houston Ballet Foundation, Houston Chamber of Commerce, Texas Children's Hospital, American Museum of Natural History in New York City, Smithsonian Institution, and Archaeological Institute of America. He fulfilled a great role as a leader at the Museum of Fine Arts, Houston. This world famous collector of art was first elected to the museums Board of Trustees in 1970. Realizing peoples fundamental need for hands on experience in the arts and recognizing the lack of studio opportunities, he established the Glassell School of Art. Since its dedication in 1979, the Glassell School has provided diverse training in the fine arts to children, adults, emerging artists, hospital patients, and older Americans. He was elected Chairman of the Board of Trustees of the Museum of Fine Arts, Houston in 1990, a time when the need for physical expansion was evident. With characteristic optimism and belief in the generosity of Houston, he led a ten-year effort that resulted in the Audrey Jones Beck Building as home for the museums collection of Western Antiquities, European, and American art. As a life-long collector of Asian, Pre-Columbian, and African art, he donated his excellent and extensive collections to the Museum of Fine Arts, Houston. These works, primarily of precious gold, are without parallel. Frances Marzio, his curator, described him as a great connoisseur who recognized the creative genius of diverse cultures before they were appreciated by many others. After a life spent in the pursuit of excellence Alfred C. Glassell, Jr., 95, died on Wednesday afternoon, the 29th of October 2008. He was predeceased by his sisters, the late Joanna Glassell Wood, Lillian Glassell Crichton, and Emily Glassell Comegys. He is survived by his wife, Clare Attwell Glassell; children, Curry Glassell, Alfred C. Glassell III and Marli Andrade, Lisa Ford, Alison Ford Duncan, Emily Ford Embrey and her husband Mark C. Embrey; and grandsons, Nathan J. Roberts, Alfred Samuel Jared Roberts, Robert S. Duncan, W. Hudson Duncan, Nicholas E. Embrey, and Joseph M. Embrey. He is also survived by his niece, Janie C. Lee Warren, as well as numerous other nieces, nephews, and great nieces and nephews. The family wishes to express their gratitude to his longtime office manager Pam Lindberg, assistant Bonnie Gonzales, and Samantha Duff.

Jane Schub, an illustrator and beauty entrepreneur, realized one day its color would make a wonderful nail polish. As would the pink in a Warhol painting she saw at the Dia:Beacon museum. ''It had black in it,'' Ms. Schub explained. ''It was a little off. It turned the corner from being pink to something very beautiful to look at.'' Those colors, along with six other similarly vibrant and somewhat eccentric hues (a midcentury modern orange, an Art Nouveau teal, a blue inspired by the depths of a lake at night) make up the first collection of StrangeBeautiful, a line Ms. Schub started with her business partner, Susan Strange. (''I like to say she's the strange, and I'm the beautiful,'' Ms. Schub said, laughing.)

2008-11-02T00:00:00Z,"The late-1950s westerns of Budd Boetticher are shoestring masterpieces that put the idea of flashy, big-budget, prestige filmmaking to shame. These are taut miniatures: none of the pictures in this five-disc set -- ''The Tall T,'' ''Decision at Sundown,'' ''Buchanan Rides Alone,'' ''Ride Lonesome'' and ''Comanche Station,'' all made from 1957 to 1960 -- top 80 minutes. They were shot on minimal budgets with shooting schedules of around 18 days, but the storytelling is so compact and vital that you're never left feeling hungry. Boetticher (pronounced BET-i-ker), a Midwestern rich kid who grew up to be fascinated with bullfighting (which he used as a backdrop for several films, among them the 1951 ''Bullfighter and the Lady''), knew how to film action. The shootouts in his movies tend to have a kinetic gracefulness, and the characters move with economic agility. As Martin Scorsese notes in a brief featurette included on one of the discs, ''Any time anyone moved, it meant something.''"

2008-11-02T00:00:00Z,"ZIMMER--Michael, who died on October 12, 2008 at the age of 74, leaves a host of saddened friends and family behind. Diagnosed with lung cancer only a few weeks ago, he was taken home to his house in the West Village to die among his books, his friends, and with a view of his beloved garden. Michael was born in Heidelberg in 1934, the youngest son of Sanskrit scholar and Indologist Heinrich Zimmer and his wife Christiane, daughter of the Austrian poet and librettist Hugo von Hofmannsthal (''Der Rosenkavalier'', ''Elektra''). The family fled Nazi Germany in 1939, and New York's Columbia University offered a hospitable teaching environment. After her husband's premature death in 1943, Christiane settled in New York's West Village where her house became a gathering place for luminaries from both sides of the Atlantic, among them Hannah Arendt, Wyston Auden and Joseph Campbell, one of Zimmer's most illustrious disciples. Michael and his two brothers attended Horace Mann School and Michael went on to study at Harvard University, supported by the Mellon family who had earlyon recognized the importance of Heinrich Zimmer's work on Indian myths and philosophy. Always fascinated by the built environment, Michael chose to major in architecture, studying with masters such as Walter Gropius and Siegfried Giedion. A short-lived career as an architect in New York followed: Michael, by his own admission, wasn't cut out for the compromises it entailed. After his marriage to Emily Sophia Harding, a cousin by marriage and daughter of Alice Astor, the couple briefly occupied the glamour pages of Vogue and other glossies. In 1967 they had a son, Jacob and soon after left New York to live ''off the grid''. In 1969, assisted by the proceeds of the sale of a Hofmannsthal heirloom, Picassos self portrait ''Yo Picasso'', they purchased a piece of land on the island of St. Barts. After his divorce from Harding, Michael made the little paradise his home, sharing it with his companion, Vera Graaf and a group of like-minded friends. ''Le Camp'' was a compound of mini buildings with a solarpowered kitchen and a beautifully cultivated tropical garden, all of which Michael used as a playful laboratory for his ideas of the good life, guided by aesthetic principles. It was a visionary example of ''green'' lifestyle, as well as a meticulously choreographed piece of theatre which Michael directed, smoking, talking, always a glass of rum in hand, endlessly amusing and usually surrounded by a bevy of awe-struck friends. When St. Barts became a celebrity hangout, Michael was soon looking for a more hospitable shore. He found it in Canada, on the island of Grand Manan, where his second wife Veronique Sari took him whalewatching and he discovered a group of defunct smoke houses. He managed to buy and transform them into a museum whose most striking exhibition piece was he himself, living in the midst of it all and motoring around in an aluminum boat shaped like a sardine can. He became the island's keeper of memories, the man who guarded and exhibited what the islanders threw away. The ''Sardine Museum and Herring Hall of Fame'' became Michael's last great project -a poetic environment, part museum, part curiosity cabinet, part living memory. Michael Johannes der Baptist Karl Maximilian Heinrich Hugo Zimmer (his full name) enjoyed what was perceived by many as a charmed life. He lived by his own rules and conventions, counting among his lovers and companions men and women. Tragedy intervened only once, when his son Jacob was killed in a drowning accident in 1990. Michael and Jacob had many unfinished plans. May they now be reunited to carry them out. Michael is survived by his cousins Romana McEwen, Octavian von Hofmannsthal and Arabella Heathcote-Amory of London, England, as well as his nephew Christopher Zimmer and his niece, Adriana Zimmer, both of Washington, DC. A memorial date is yet to be announced."

2008-11-02T00:00:00Z,"Independents are a prized bloc. But surveys suggest that more than a third of them are ornery or apathetic and probably won't bother to vote -- mostly because they didn't bother to register. That leaves candidates to fight over the rest of an independent-minded diaspora that had skewed toward Republicans for many years but has recently flipped. Now, independents are drawn more to Democrats. Independents outnumber Republicans in the electorate this year, according to polling by the Pew Research Center conducted last month: Among independents, just over half lean toward one of the major parties: About one in 10 are the most purely independent -- they refuse to identify with either party but still care very much about who is president. The rest, not so much. Herewith, a map of mindsets proclaimed by America's independents. How to Read This Chart Each '' i '' symbol represents 1 percent of Americans who call themselves independents.

2008-11-02T00:00:00Z,"Those of us who, as young readers, read William H. Armstrong's children's novel ''Sounder'' in the early 1970s were thrilled to see the story of black sharecroppers in '30s Louisiana visualized in Martin Ritt's 1972 film. Watching the movie as adults, viewers can see the closest that American commercial cinema has ever come to the humanist purity of Jean Renoir, Vittorio de Sica, Satyajit Ray and Claude Jutra. In pictures like ''Hud'' and ''Norma Rae,'' Ritt combined a good liberal's politics with a storyteller's instinct for satisfying melodrama. ''Sounder'' (the title refers to the family's hunting dog) has a quiet, organic quality unmatched in Ritt's work. It's the kind of subject -- how love and determination hold a family together when the father (Paul Winfield) is sent to a prison camp for stealing food to feed his hungry children -- that invites homilies, sentimentality and false nobility."

2008-11-02T00:00:00Z,"Alison Pill enters cursing in ''Milk'' (Nov. 26), Gus Van Sant's dramatic feature about the triumphs and tribulations of the San Francisco activist Harvey Milk, who in 1978 took office as the country's first openly gay, high-profile elected official. Ms. Pill plays Anne Kronenberg, the leather-jacketed, biker-babe lesbian whom Milk hires as campaign manager to whip his fourth try for city supervisor into shape. This time he wins. Her opening obscenity is directed at a guy who has just tried to hit on her outside Milk's campaign headquarters. What was he thinking? you might well ask. Ms. Pill's appearance answers the question. The humor of the scene -- and of her role throughout the movie -- pivots on a sight gag, the contrast between her dry, four-letter-word delivery and her young, delicate face. She turns 23 this month. But with her wide eyes, chubby cheeks and cloud of strawberry-blond curls, she looks like the littlest angel in the school Christmas pageant. In fact, Ms. Pill, a Canadian, is an acclaimed stage actress. In February she will resume her co-starring role in Neil LaBute's ''Reasons to Be Pretty'' when it transfers to Broadway; two years ago her work in Martin McDonagh's ''Lieutenant of Inishmore'' earned her a Tony Award nomination."

2008-11-02T00:00:00Z,"In Douglas Sirk's ''Magnificent Obsession,'' Jane Wyman loses her husband, a beloved small-town doctor, because when his heart attack strikes, the one respirator is being used to resuscitate the village playboy, Rock Hudson, after a boating accident. But that's not all: Hudson (right with Wyman), after meeting the widow and realizing that his survival came at the cost of her husband's life, scrambles to make amends and inadvertently causes an accident that results in her blindness. In real life, those kinds of things don't happen every day; in the alternate universe known as Sirk World, they're business as usual. But even though Sirk's movies are frequently referred to as tear-jerkers, his approach to these crazy plots was quite dry and precise. And though ''Magnificent Obsession'' is not the greatest of Sirk's movies -- it doesn't have the enveloping dramatic sense of, say, ''Written on the Wind'' -- it is a sterling example of how he used visuals as ornate picture frames for outsize emotions."

2008-11-02T00:00:00Z,"MONTANA--Dr. John B. AIDS specialist/Gay Activist, dies at 61. John Buscemi Montana, M.D., gay man, physician, generous humanitarian, New Yorker, world traveler and art aficionado, died at Mt. Sinai Hospital early Monday morning, September 29, 2008. The cause of death was acute myelogenous leukemia (AML), diagnosed less than one year ago. Dr. Montana was one of the first NYC physicians to identify and treat people with AIDS at the outset of the epidemic in 1981. He saw many cases among his friends and the gay men who comprised a large portion of his internal medicine practice on lower Fifth Avenue in Greenwich Village. Dr. Montana, the son of Vanni Buscemi Montana and Helen Bortnovski Montana, was born in Huntington, Long Island, NY on March 13, 1947. His parents met in Europe during World War II. John's father was politically active in anti-fascist and socialist causes in his native Sicily; he died in 1991. John's own politics reflected his father's leftist leanings. His mother Helene perished in an apartment fire in February, 2003. A product of New York City public schools, Dr. Montana graduated from Harpur College (SUNY Binghamton) in 1969 where he majored in Science and Mathematics. He taught junior high school in Newark, New Jersey for two years before attending medical school. Dr. Montana graduated New York Medical College, Valhalla in 1975. After working at Cabrini-Stuyvesant Polyclinic, he opened his internal medicine practice in 1984. He was an attending physician at Cabrini Medical Center until it closed. Then he attended at St. Vincent's Hospital. Dr. Montana's illness caused him to close his medical practice in mid-December, 2007. The AIDS epidemic motivated him to focus his practice on treating AIDS-related opportunistic infections and cancers--which signaled fatality in less than two years at the beginning of the epidemic. His beloved partner, Jimmie Jackson, died from AIDS early on, and his death both devastated and deeply politicized John to continue the fight against AIDS. A firm proponent of safer-sex, Dr. Montana advised the Gay Men's Health Crisis (GMHC) on medical issues from its inception. He lectured on AIDS to community and professional groups throughout the city and was politically involved in ACT-UP and other AIDS-related organizations. John gave generously of his time and money to many gay community organizations including Senior Action in a Gay Environment (SAGE) and the Callen-Lorde Community Health Center. Until the end of his life, he maintained his conviction that the right-wing-dominated, federal government covertly propagated the epidemic, if not intentionally, then by intentional negligence--the ultimate goal being the elimination of the gay community. A gay-civil-rights activist and life-long Democrat, he was horrified at the response of the Reagan and Bush presidencies to AIDS and gay rights issues in general. He became inconsolable when his long-term partner, Daniel C., was deported from this country in 1999. Being bi-lingual, John was a benefactor to many in New York's Latino communities, and especially to Daniel's family. Dr. Montana often visited South America where he was a benefactor to small villages helping poor people at local medical clinics. Dr. Montana was a patron of the arts whether for museum-sponsored projects or for individual, fledgling, gay artists including E. J. Weiss, Ferron Bell and William Schwedler. He especially appreciated the works of Charles Demuth. John loved New York City, but enjoyed traveling throughout Europe and South America. John had many patients and friends in diplomatic positions who hosted him in Brazil, Italy, France, and Spain. Recently he traveled to Turkey, and only two weeks before his death, he returned from a cruise to Venice and Greece with two friends who made his trip as comfortable as possible. He fell critically ill upon his return. John Montana is survived by his brother Victor and his nephew John, both of New Hampshire. He is deeply mourned by his cousins Vicki De Bruin-Tarlow, Carol Daniels, Jesse Kamras, and also by his close friends John Helmuth, Ron Illardo, Philip Kayal, Jim D'Eramo, Patrick Hacker, Joe Nicholson and Angel, who with others, nursed him daily near the end. He is also mourned by his extended family in Finland and Israel, and by his friends throughout the world, but most particularly by the New York City gay community that he shepherded courageously through the AIDS epidemic--Dr. John Montana was an AIDS hero. Dr. Montana's Memorial Service will be Sunday, November 23 at 3:30pm in the Auditorium (10th Floor) of St. Vincents Hospital, 170 West 12th Street, Greenwich Village. Family and friends are welcome. Any questions should be directed to Philip Kayal: pkayal@comcast.net."

The cause of death was pancreatic cancer. A legal expert on the First Amendment, libel law and the Federal Communications Commission, she worked on legal issues confronting the broadcast industry for more than 50 years. Upon her graduation from Columbia Law School in 1949, she joined the American Broadcasting Company's legal staff, and in 1958 she went to work for Metromedia, Inc., first serving as assistant general counsel and assistant secretary. In 1974, she became vice president of Metromedia's WNEW - TV and was named associate general counsel of Metromedia in 1985. In 1992, she became vice president for legal affairs and East Coast litigation, at Fox Television (which had acquired Metromedia) and held that position until her retirement in 2005. During her tenure at Fox, she provided legal counsel to the upstart television program, ''A Current Affair'' and helped create the Fox News Network. In addition to being a leading First Amendment lawyer, she also worked as an on-air legal commentator, providing legal analysis during the murder trial of OJ Simpson. She hosted a public affairs program, ''Sunday Night with Muriel Reis,'' was a guest host of the program ''Midday Live,'' and made numerous appearances on ''Good Day New York'' as a legal expert. She was honored in 1994 by the New York Chapter of the National Academy of Television Arts and Sciences by being inducted into the Silver Circle, an elite group of media professionals who made significant contributions to their industry and their community over a career span of at least 25 years. A lifelong and devoted New Yorker and a graduate of the Brearley School and Vassar College, she felt compelled to contribute to her community and the city she loved. She served on the New York Lawyers' Association Task Force on Judicial Independence and co-chaired the Media Subcommittee. She was a member of the Bar Association of the City of New York and served on its Communication Law Committee. In addition to her pioneering work as a lawyer, she was a passionate advocate for disadvantaged children. Her desire to help those in need led to her to contribute her time and talents to the Children's Aid Society. She was also a valued member of the board of directors of CASA, an organization of court appointed special advocates working on behalf of children in foster care, as well as a tenacious CASA volunteer, who used her legal skills to help improve the lives of others. She had a brilliant mind, a loving heart and a spirit of generosity that extended to all who knew her. She was loved by her four grandchildren, Chloe Reis Hyman, Mara Claire McCartin, Elisa Reis McCartin, and Lucas Henle Reis Hyman, her daughter-in-law Marianne McGeary Reis and her sons-in-law, Joseph A. McCartin and Kevin Hyman. She will be deeply missed by her family, friends and professional colleagues.

2008-11-02T00:00:00Z,"IN ''Nothing Like the Holidays'' (Dec. 12), Alfredo de Villa's tragicomedy of manners good and bad, the scattered members of a middle-class Puerto Rican family come together in Chicago for Christmas. Conflicted and voluble, they have their tensions -- the father (Alfred Molina) has a secret that is wrecking his marriage, the stockbroker son (John Leguizamo) and his hedge-fund manager wife (Debra Messing) are in no hurry to have a baby, and the actress daughter (Vanessa Ferlito) frets over her not-quite-Hollywood career. But these eruptions pale before the silence of the youngest, Freddy Rodriguez's Jesse, supposedly home for good after fighting in Iraq. The traumatized soldier turned specter at the family feast has been a dramatic staple at least since World War I. But Mr. Rodriguez keeps his performance fresh and surprising by rigorously reining in the drama. When he first sees the huge, homemade welcome banner draped across his parents' house, a flinch of revulsion registers in his eyes but nowhere else. Later, during the boisterous, often heated give and take among family members, Mr. Rodriguez does some of his best work, occasionally venturing a word or a joke but mostly keeping quiet as expressions of bemusement or disgust flicker across his face."
2008-11-02T00:00:00Z,"REINER--Estelle. Jazz singer, painter, and wife of comedy legend, Carl Reiner for 64 years, died on Saturday, October 25 at the age of 94. A talented artist and singer, Estelle was most widely known for the famous line -''I'll have what she's having,'' in son, Rob Reiner's film, ''When Harry Met Sally''. As an artist she had four one-woman shows of her paintings in the 1970's and at the age of 65 embarked on a new career as a jazz singer. Undeterred by any of the usual constraints of age, anxiety and later, illness, she developed her innate musical gifts and continued performing in clubs in New York and Los Angeles until the remarkable age of 93. Early in her new found career, the noted jazz critic, Leonard Feather, said of her work, ''Her bittersweet timbre suggests honey laced with vinegar. She has qualities many a seasoned pro would envy.'' A. James Liska of the Daily News in New York, wrote, ''she has wise and knowing phrasing, and a dry, wry, sly wit...'', and talented singer/songwriter, Dave Frishberg wrote, ''I feel comfortable entrusting my songs to Estelle Reiner, whose musicality shines through every track.'' She was a true original, a jazz stylist, part of whose repertoire included quirky, little known old jazz and blues songs which reflected her personal humor and uniqueness. Although she sang sweet ballads and standards, she fell in love with the Blues as a teenager, frequenting the Apollo Theater in Harlem, and did not shy away from raunchy old blues tunes such as, ''Handy Man,'' ''You Can Have My Husband (But Please Don't Take My Man''). Her friend, Dom Deluise never stopped talking admiringly about her sexy rendition of ''Don't You Feel My Leg,'' when well into her 80's. Jazz afficionado, David Chasman, also the former production head at United Artists, wrote of Estelle, ''More than innate musicality, more than seductiveness of voice, it is Estelle's undisguised, unequivocal, unabashed, unmistakable love for the songs that she sings, which makes her irresistible to her audience''. Her courage and determination also resulted in seven CD's, including, ''Ukulele Mama'', and a charming collection of standards called ''Grown Up Songs For Kids''. After raising her three children, acclaimed actor / director, Rob, Annie, a gifted writer and psychoanalyst, and Lucas, a painter whose work shows in the U.S. and Europe, Reiner began a career as a performer, studying with Viola Spolin and Lee Strasberg, and was soon cast in ''Fatso'', the directorial debut of her old friend, Anne Bancroft. Subsequently, she had a small part in Mel Brooks' film, ''To Be Or Not To Be'', and went on to do other performances in TV and film, including the often repeated line in ''When Harry Met Sally''. Born in Bronx, New York in 1914, the former Estelle Lebost graduated the National Academy of Design in the late 1930's and during World War II she was the first woman isometric draftsman to work at Sperry Rand, making blueprints for assembly workers building submarines and airplanes. She and Carl Reiner married on Christmas Eve, 1943, when Reiner was on a weekend pass from the Army. Her friends and family will remember her as a free thinker who never stopped searching, a courageous woman of extraordinary spirit and curiosity who lived life to the end. In addition to her children and husband, she also leaves nephews George Shapiro and Donny Shapiro, and five grandchildren, Jake, Nick and Romy Reiner, Livia and Rose Reiner. The family requests that in lieu of flowers, donations be made to Save The Children."

In the months it took to hammer out details of the contract, economic turmoil grew so worrisome that Christie's got cold feet and withdrew the guarantee. The auction house persuaded the seller to offer the Bacon anyway, and it is one of the highlights of Christie's Nov. 12 sale. Experts say that the full-length portrait, in which the artist is shown sitting on a bed, his body twisted from head to toe, should sell for around $40 million."

And on a weathered plank floor under a large disco ball sat a prototype Volt, which does not go on sale until late 2010 (at the earliest)."
2008-11-02T00:00:00Z,"THE sardonically titled ''Revolutionary Road'' (Dec. 26) is based on Richard Yates's acclaimed 1961 novel about the hollowness of the postwar American dream. Directed by Sam Mendes, the movie has the star power of Leonardo DiCaprio and Kate Winslet (Mr. Mendes's wife) reunited for the first time since ''Titanic.'' Now they are the miserably married Frank and April Wheeler, with Kathy Bates as the relentlessly chipper real-estate broker who sold them the house on the suburban street of the title. But it's the 34-year-old character actor Michael Shannon who provides some of the movie's most thrilling fireworks. Mr. Shannon plays the broker's son, John Givings, who has been hospitalized for paranoid schizophrenia and, by his own account, given 37 shock treatments. Looking ahead to a weekend furlough, his mother asks the couple if she and her husband might bring by their son for drinks. The Wheelers and his parents watch John apprehensively, as if he might do something dangerously, or just embarrassingly, abnormal. Mr. Shannon, acclaimed as another paranoid in William Friedkin's movie ''Bug,'' certainly doesn't look normal here. Neatly dressed in jacket and tie and standing very straight, he seems painfully self-conscious; at times a tense misery glitters in his eyes. But there's a hawkishness about him too and a touch of barely suppressed aggression. When Frank makes a glib reference to ''the hopeless emptiness'' of the country, John vigorously agrees, then pounces on the phrase and what it means to acknowledge its reality. He's taking Frank far more seriously than he deserves."

2008-11-02T00:00:00Z,"RECYCLED At the Oregon College of Art and Craft in Portland, the art is in the making, and the materials. Amy Baker, a senior, made a purse as well as a dress and gloves from old sweaters. Some belonged to her grandmother and her aunt. ''They embroidered them, and now I have, too,'' she says. Zoe Umholtz, also a senior, used sweaters for a quilt. ''I don't know how much it has to do with the economy, or whether we're just more environmentally aware,'' she says, ''but reusing is becoming very popular.'' STITCHED Needlepoint belts are a preppy staple, especially in the South. At the University of Kentucky, well-dressed Wildcats wear them to fraternity formals as well as Keeneland, Lexington's thoroughbred track. ''I have the Kentucky logo, my initials and my fraternity on my belt,'' says Clay Willett, a junior and president of Phi Delta Theta. ''Your belt shows what you love, and what's unique to you.'' The belts are often gifts from girlfriends, but because they take so long to make, they can outlast a relationship. Stephen Carson's girlfriend worked naval flags (like his father's) and pirate flags into his belt. ''We broke up when she was in the middle of making it,'' he says, ''and then it took her six months to finish.'' The frat brothers now call them ''breakup belts.''"

Now added to the list is the Amtrak train conductor Chris Waugh, whom Ms. Lutz met on her weekly commute from New York to her house in Rhode Island. ''He jokingly said that if we ever needed a guest designer, he knew the name of the sweater and the charity it would benefit,'' she said. ''We took him up on it.'' The Shoreline hoodie, named after the train Mr. Waugh works on, was inspired by his favorite Izod pullover and a sweatshirt of his daughter's, and is dedicated to his father, who has Parkinson's; $20 of each sweater's purchase price will benefit the Parkinson's Disease Foundation."

2008-11-02T00:00:00Z,"One spring morning last year, I happened to be strolling through the Congressional cemetery east of Capitol Hill with the White House press secretary Dana Perino as she walked her dog. Ms. Perino was candidly describing the challenges of her job, which were only mounting as George W. Bush's approval rating continued to drop. Then she looked directly at me and said, ''But it's all worth it, because I so believe in the president.'' It would have been easy for me to dismiss Ms. Perino as a bright and likable but ultimately Kool-Aid-stricken peddler of talking points, were it not for two things. First, my interviews with current and former Bush staffers constantly veered off into similar testimonials. Their belief in Mr. Bush transcended ideology: as much as anything else, they just loved the guy. They loved how he treated the elevator man with the same courtesy as a foreign leader; how he often picked up the phone to congratulate the bride of a junior staffer; how he never pointed fingers, harbored grudges, snubbed, publicly belittled or boasted. Above all, they loved how they never had to worry which George W. Bush would show up to the Oval Office. It was fitting that he worked at a desk carved from a British warship, the H.M.S. Resolute -- clarity of purpose being the admirable flip side to his at times infuriating certitude."

I was in architecture school at the University of Texas at Austin, and my friend Suby and I had traveled south for Christmas break, taking a ''tourist'' boat across the Bay of Banderas. The funky old boat held only about 50 people, but there was a D.J. who thought he was on a Princess Cruise -- he loved coaxing the gringos into dancing. He shared his surefire secret to a good life: ''Move your bonbon and be happy.'' (It turns out he was right. If you say his line and actually move your bonbon, you pretty much have to smile.) After about an hour, we arrived at a remote fishing village without electricity or automobiles. Suby and I set up our tent on the beach under the coconut trees. We swam and hiked during the day, and at night the jungle roads were lighted with candelaria. We heard they were showing a movie near the church, so we hiked up the hill and sat on wooden benches in a tiny dirt plaza. We watched as two guys hung a sheet on the side of the building. A projector hooked up to a generator started playing the 1940 black-and-white ''Mark of Zorro,'' with Tyrone Power, above."

2008-11-02T00:00:00Z,"1. PAPER tale Sheets of paper were once handmade from discarded cloth. For the course ''Medieval and Renaissance Literature,'' at the University of Washington in Seattle, students envision the papermaking process, and how an apprentice might have swept up a cloud of dust, fly included, that then settled into an open vat of paper pulp. The paper -- and the fly -- ended up in the university's copy of ''La Civil Conversazione,'' a book of etiquette printed in Venice in 1579. 2. THE EVOLUTION OF KNOWLEDGE Because it was large, decorative and expensive, the Nuremberg Chronicle, a world history published in Germany in 1493, was treasured and preserved. About 700 copies remain from a print run of perhaps 2,100. How many of the 1,804 illustrations were colored by hand after printing depended on how much the owner could afford to pay an artist. The pictured drawing, based on a second-century map by Ptolemy, makes a teaching point for ''The History of Science'' at Smith College: though seafarers had long known otherwise, the belief that the world was limited to portions of Europe, Asia and Africa prevailed. Direct observation would soon replace the authority of classical learning, laying the basis for modern science."

Upon being graduated from Cooper in 1939, he held a number of design jobs, until joining the United States Army where he contributed his considerable design skills during World War II. In 1946, Lou began a career at CBS that would span 41 years. He began in radio, then television, and was ultimately named Senior Vice President and Creative Director for Marketing Communications and Design. His talent was not limited to design; he was the ''idea man'' behind some of CBS's most successful advertising campaigns. Over the course of his career he was the recipient of numerous awards from the Art Directors Club, AIGA, as well as the Augustus St. Gaudens medal from The Cooper Union, the Master Series Award from the School of Visual Arts, and honorary degrees from the New School for Social Research and Long Island University. Among his most esteemed accomplishments was the ''Gastrotypographicalassemblage'' wall that graced the CBS cafeteria for more than two decades. He was actively involved in directing the restoration of this legendary masterpiece up until the time of his death. His commitment to excellence in design right down to the smallest detail was as strong at the end of his career as it was at the beginning. As a tribute to Lou, his family has requested that any donations made in his memory be sent towards the restoration of this iconic work of twentieth century design. Donations and comments may be made by logging on to the website www.karma411.com/ campaign/savelouswall. A memorial service will be held in early 2009, to be announced."

2008-11-02T00:00:00Z,"It's almost redundant to complain about the stupidity of pressure groups that attack movies over their pet issues. If you view movies solely as vehicles for the right or wrong message, you've already announced your inability to comprehend the ambiguities and complexities of art. Samuel Fuller's 1982 ''White Dog,'' which, in this Criterion DVD, is getting its first official release of any kind in its own country, has suffered particularly from pressure groups. In this adaptation of the Romain Gary story, Kristy McNichol, below, plays a young Los Angeles actress who takes in a pure white German shepherd stray only to discover that the dog has been trained to attack black people. The black actor Paul Winfield, in a tense performance, plays an animal trainer who is convinced that because racism is learned it can be unlearned, despite the skepticism of his colleague, played by Burl Ives."

And while this might, depending upon whom you ask, be an admirable description, it doesn't tend to prompt fascination. Oh, I say, but there's so much more to her! Among my favorite facts: She spent her 20s working at ethnically diverse, low-income schools and was a Democrat until she married George Bush at the age of 31 -- after knowing him just 12 weeks. As first lady of Texas, she'd eat at hole-in-the-wall Mexican restaurants, shop at Wal-Mart and fly Southwest Airlines to visit friends. In the White House, in addition to organizing literary events that featured writers who have publicly disagreed with her husband's policies, she has been far more politically involved than people realize -- traveling to Africa and the Middle East to raise awareness for, respectively, AIDS and breast cancer, and advocating for the opposition leader of Myanmar, who has long been under house arrest."

2008-11-03T00:00:00Z,Doubts Persist Over Ad Deal
2008-11-03T00:00:00Z,"Below are the answers to this week's quiz, which challenged readers to spot problems of grammar, usage and style in recent passages from The Times. If you haven't tried the quiz yet, click here to see just the questions. Then you can return to this post to compare notes. 1. Since appearing gaunt and pale at a previous Apple introduction earlier this year, Mr. Jobs's health has been the subject of intense interest. The company and Mr. Jobs have responded by saying that he has not had a recurrence of pancreatic cancer, which he battled four years ago. Answer A classic dangler. Grammatically, this sentence suggests that ''Mr. Jobs's health'' appeared gaunt and pale. 2. When asked why Tynes thought he was going to play, Coughlin said: ''I have no idea. Did you read my statement? That's all I'm saying.'' Neither Tynes nor Carney were available for interviews after practice. Answer Make it, ''Neither Tynes nor Carney was available for an interview.'' In a neither-nor or either-or construction, the verb agrees with the closest part of the subject. (In this case, of course, both parts are singular.) 3. For 39 years as an educator, Robert Grandt has been promoting other people's books. So this year, when his daughter helped create a graphic novel of ''Macbeth,'' Mr. Grandt could not resist bragging a little in the newsletter he distributes as a librarian at Brooklyn Technical High School. He also placed a few copies of the book at a library display table, and posted a sign: ''Best Book Ever Written.'' If someone were interested, they got a book free. Answer Two problems in the short final sentence. First, there's no need for the subjunctive ''were.'' This is not a contrary-to-fact or hypothetical condition; it's just the past tense of ''If someone is interested ...'' Make it ''was.'' Also, ''someone'' is singular, so the plural ''they'' doesn't agree. One simple solution to both problems: ''Anyone who was interested got a free book.'' 4. Hopes that a security agreement between Iraq and the United States could be concluded swiftly receded Sunday as several of the leading Iraqi political parties, including some that had negotiated the agreement, appeared to back away from quick approval. Answer The placement of ''swiftly'' creates a trace of ambiguity. Does it modify ''concluded'' or ''receded''? 5. Mr. Allen seemed like he was trying to avoid doing much harm to Mr. Stevens. Asked by Joseph Bottini, a prosecutor, why he had engaged in a trade of automobiles that the government said was a sweetheart deal, Mr. Allen said, ''I liked Ted.'' Answer We avoid this colloquial use of ''like'' as a conjunction. We could simply say ''seemed to be trying.'' 6. Van Gogh discovered new colors everywhere, especially at night. Peripatetically, briefly yet fulsomely, this show explores his special relationship with darkness. It provides a view of the tenderness, urgency and brilliance at the core of his art, as well as the openness to nature that set it aflame. Answer While the sense of ''fulsome'' and ''fulsomely'' has shifted over time, the primary meaning suggests something offensively excessive. As The Times's stylebook says, we should avoid using the words to mean simply ''abundant'' or ''abundantly.'' 7. Judge Kearse, in the decision, cited the payments to the detectives as one factor that supported the prosecution's view that the conspiracy spanned the entire period of the indictment, from 1979 to 2005. She said that the jury had been told the principle purpose of the enterprise, as the indictment charged, was to generate money for the detectives, through legal and illegal activities. Answer Aaarrgh. Make it ''principal,'' not ''principle.'' (It would also be smoother to move the ''that'' in this sentence, so it reads, ''She said the jury had been told that the principal purpose '') 8. Mr. Kerry's hesitancy may have been related to his constitutional disposition for Marquess of Queensbury rules; the prep-school-bred, Yale-educated Brahmin was never comfortable with slashing attacks. But mostly his concern was strategic: Mr. Bush enjoyed approval ratings of 50 percent or more in the fall of 2004, and he was often ahead in the polls of a closely divided electorate. Answer It's ''Marquess of Queensberry.'' You could look it up, and for a phrase like this, we should have. (I'll leave aside the question of whether Kerry, a Catholic whose paternal grandparents were Jewish immigrants from Central Europe, is aptly described as a ''Brahmin.'') 9. The Mullers were studying small animals called tardigrades that exist in extreme environments, like the Sahara desert. Tardigrades can suspend their metabolism by dehydrating themselves and living in such a state for as long as 10 years. Answer As the stylebook notes, ''Sahara'' means ''desert,'' so ''Sahara desert'' is redundant. Nonetheless, we've used the phrase 10 times in the last year. 10. Mr. Villeneuve downloaded the messages, decrypted them and used machine translation software to convert the Chinese messages to English. He then used word frequency counts to identify the key words that were flagging the messages. The exact criteria used by the filtering software is still unclear, he said, because some messages on the servers contained no known key word. Answer The word ''criteria'' is plural, so make it ''are still unclear.''"

Mr. Silverman estimated that there are ""tens of thousands"" of transgender people in New York City and that many will have problems voting because of problems with mismatched names."

In the job she held as Assistant Dean of International Programs and Graduate Legal Studies at the Columbia University School of Law (from which she retired in 2006), she was responsible for both the graduate and international programs.

Prior to that she was the Director of Public Policy at Chase Manhattan Bank. Most recently, she worked in Pennsylvania for Barack Obama's election. Born in New York City, Alice attended Hunter College High School, and went on to graduate summa cum laude and Phi Beta Kappa from Vassar College. She was a brilliant student and won both a Woodrow Wilson Scholarship, and a Fulbright Fellowship which took her to the London School of Economics for her first MA. At Harvard, she earned a second MA in International Relations as well as her Ph.D. in International Law. Her Juris Doctor was granted by Columbia. It was in Cambridge that she met her late husband, Alfred Haemmerli, and they had a long and fruitful marriage until Freddy's death in 2001.

With profound sadness, our entire agency mourns the passing of Joseph Kaplan, a visionary leader of the Jewish Board of Family and Children's Services for more than 30 years. Former President and current Co-Chair of the Board, Joe inspired us to stay true to our mission: to serve all people in need. He was a constant voice for the clients we serve. Joe was a man of great wisdom and a mentor to many. As Chair of our Jewish Connections division, he led in the creation of some of the most innovative and compassionate program ming, dealing with a wide range of life challenges. His enormous contributions were recently acknowledged by naming The Joseph S. Kaplan Center for Family Life Education at JBFCS. Joe understood the value of partnership with other Human Service Agencies supported by the UJA-Federation of New York, of which he too was a supporter and champion. He made a crucial contribution in establishing Ashalim, a learning and service partnership between New York and Israeli organizations for children and families (sponsored by UJA-Federation). Joe, a man of enormous personal integrity, understood the importance of professional and programmatic integrity in the outcome of our work. Staff, Board and volunteers loved and appreciated Joe: he respected each of us for our effort to better the NYC community. We will be inspired by his memory in the work we do every day. His first love was his family, his beloved and devoted wife Lily, also an agency volunteer over many years, and his cherished children: Michele (Ira), Andrew (Chaviva) and David (Michelle), ten grandchildren and his sister, Molla Reisbaum. We extend our deepest condolences to them all. John A Herrmann, President Jean L. Troubh, Co-Chair of the Board Paul Levine, Executive Vice President and CEO KAPLAN--Joseph.

As a founding board member of Ashalim, representing UJA-Federation, and a past New York chair of the Ashalim board, Joseph's passion to rescue at-risk youth in Israel profoundly impacted the community and further strengthened our ability to serve those in need. We extend our heartfelt condolences to Joseph's wife, Lily; to his daughter, Michele, and son-in-law, Ira; to his son Andrew and daughter-in-law Chaviva; to his son David and daughter-in-law Michelle; to his grandchildren; and to the entire Kaplan family.

2008-11-06T00:00:00Z,"With a robust bank account and extensive name recognition, Mike Johanns, a former governor of Nebraska who served as secretary of agriculture under President Bush, entered the race to replace Senator Chuck Hagel. Mr. Johanns, a Republican, banked on his deep Nebraska roots and his experience in Washington to convince voters that he was the right candidate to fill Mr. Hagel's shoes. (Mr. Hagel chose not to run again.) Mr. Johanns labeled his Democratic opponent, Scott Kleeb, an inexperienced outsider, while Mr. Kleeb said that Mr. Johanns represented the status quo. Mr. Kleeb, a Yale graduate and former college professor, wore cowboy boots on the campaign trail and used horses and lassos in his ads. But in the end, he fell far short."

''Would Americans choose someone who thinks outside the box?'' he asked rhetorically as an army of engineers and technicians scrambled to get the big screen working again. ''This is just too good to be true.''"

Of those contacted as part of the Obama effort, almost three-quarters said they voted for him. The Libertarian candidate, Bob Barr, was another major factor. With all but a handful of election districts counted, Mr. Obama held a lead over Mr. McCain of just 26,163 votes, less than 1 percent of the votes cast. Mr. Barr received 29,186 votes."

The first lady-elect took to the stage at Grant Park in Chicago on Tuesday night wearing a red-and-black sheath by Narciso Rodriguez, sparking instant debate among viewers, with some calling it an eye-catching statement and others, an eyesore. The dress, black with a splash of red from the bust through the hips, has two corset-like bands of black intersecting at the waist. It is a departure for Mr. Rodriguez, a proponent of low-key looks who is remembered for Carolyn Bessette Kennedy's sleekly minimalist ivory wedding dress."

Bush won handily in 2004. The struggling economy, especially in more industrial states, and high numbers of new voters helped flip key areas from red to blue. Even where Mr. McCain beat Mr. Obama, he won by slimmer margins, as much of the electorate -- across age, race and income lines -- swung toward the Democratic Party. Margins of Victory"

2008-11-06T00:00:00Z,"COTTON--Sylvia , a champion of improved early childhood education and quality childcare and the founding President of Illinois Action for Children, died Friday, October 31, in New York. She was 95. A native New Yorker born in the City and educated in NYC public schools and Hunter College, she was the dear husband of Eugene, the beloved mother of two sons, Rick and Steve, and the doting grandmother of two grandchildren, Rachel and Jon. After working as a social worker in NYC and then moving with her husband to Washington, D.C. during the New Deal and World War II, she moved again with her family to Chicago in 1948. Cotton became a highly visible, passionate and outspoken advocate for children's causes in Chicago over a period of more than 50 years. In her early years in Chicago, she was a strong advocate of school desegregation and greater federal aid to education. She joined and became an officer (usually President) of every PTA in her area. Twice the Chicago Urban League recommended her as a candidate for the Chicago Board of Education. Then in 1970, she founded an organization, Illinois Action for Children, that has flourished and grown to become one of the leading voices on public policy decisions involving childrens issues in Illinois. Her leadership led to the creation of the Office of Child Care Services of the City of Chicago and to important City and State initiatives to upgrade the availability of quality childcare--accomplishments recognized by official proclamation of the Chicago City Council in 2003. Cotton acted following a 1968 study she did on childcare in Chicago that found an appalling lack of decent childcare alternatives for working parents. Years later Sylvia would say, ''I really was an angry woman. And I guess I put that anger to good use.'' She organized a wide variety of childcare advocates and institutions-Jewish and Catholic charities, settlement houses, PTA's-and wielded them into an effective political force. As she told one reporter, ''I stepped on people's toes because I was outspoken about what I thought were the weaknesses in various legislative programs. But I continued to press for things that needed to be done and programs that needed to be improved.'' Maria Whelan, current President of Illinois Action for Children, said, ''With a combination of moral outrage and hard work, Sylvia was able to create systems to support children and working families in Illinois. Her legacy reminds us of the challenges that lie ahead as we fight to give every child a strong start in life.'' Her achievements led Chicago Mayor Michael Bilandic to proclaim April 25, 1978 as Sylvia Cotton Day. In addition, her efforts were recognized by the Chicago YWCA (Community Leadership Award), by the Illinois Welfare Association (Public Service Citation) and by the Chicago City Council in 2003 which credited her activities with ''getting elected officials on the federal, state and local levels to understand the day care crisis... and update city ordinances and state statutes governing day care centers.'' On the occasion of Cotton's retirement from Illinois Action for Children, her husband of more than sixty-five years captured her spirit: ''She's one of the few people in the world who is constantly outraged by the outrageous. So many other people adjust to the evils in society. She is one of the few that, when she sees something that needs to be done, has the instantaneous desire to do something.'' She is survived by her husband Eugene, now retired, of New York City; two sons, Richard Cotton of New York City, and Stephen Cotton of Andover, Massachusetts and Anchorage, Alaska; daughter-in-law Rebecca Backman; former daughter-in-law Jamie Fellner; niece Judy Quittman; nephews Stuart Cotton, Richard and Robert Glickstein, and Daniel Steinbrocker; and the apples of her eye, two grandchildren, Rachel Cotton and Jon Cotton. A memorial service will be held in New York City on November 30 by family and friends who will treasure memories of a feisty, loving woman who always sought an ever more just and fair society for all."

2008-11-06T00:00:00Z,"STAYING hydrated on the trail used to be straightforward: take a water bottle. But concern over bisphenol-A, or BPA, a chemical in hard-plastic bottles, has confused the issue. Although the Food and Drug Administration maintains that BPA poses no health threat, in April Canada banned its use in some bottles, pointing to growing evidence that the hormone mimicker leaches into food and drink and is linked to several medical conditions and diseases. Health-conscious athletes are choosing alternatives made from stainless steel, aluminum or BPA-free plastics. ''Last year at this time we couldn't pay anyone to take our stainless-steel bottles,'' said Sloan Russell, the president of Guyot Designs, in Deer Isle, Maine."

The Columbia University Mailman School of Public Health mourns the loss of our colleague, Bernard Weinstein, MD, DSci (Hon.), professor of Environmental Health Sciences. Dr. Weinstein is renowned for his work in cancer biology, prevention and treatment. He was head of the School's Division of Environmental Health Sciences from 1976-1991, and, under his leadership, the Division grew significantly in the area of environmental carcinogenesis and pioneered the field of molecular epidemiology.

Bush had in 2000 and 2004. Senator Tim Johnson, a Democrat, barely won his seat in 2002, and four years later he suffered a stroke that took him out of action for months. He remains partly disabled, but he and his staff have labored hard to send the message to his constituents and the media that he is still mentally sharp and actively engaged in his job."

2008-11-06T00:00:00Z,"His class in international relations was starting in 10 minutes, but Tang Tang was busy studying a map on a computer screen inside a cramped common room at the prestigious Tsinghua University. His major is international relations -- the Chinese equivalent of political science -- and his screen displayed the biggest political show in the world: the red-and-blue electoral jigsaw of the United States, with every state written in Chinese characters. Mr. Tang, 23, admitted that the American election had been a serious distraction during his Wednesday morning classes. Given the different time zones, the outcome was still uncertain. Yet now that he could assess the historic Obama victory, Mr. Tang's reaction seemed akin to that of a sports fan dissecting a box score and betrayed none of the hopeful idealism once conferred on Western-styled democracy by young Chinese intellectuals."

2008-11-06T00:00:00Z,"Democrats had hoped to win one of the two Senate seats up for grabs. Instead, Thad Cochran handily beat Erik Fleming to keep a Senate seat he took over after Trent Lott resigned. And Roger F. Wicker, an incumbent who led throughout the race, won by a smaller but still comfortable margin over Ronnie Musgrove, a former governor of the state. Mr. Wicker's defense of his seat helped deny the Democrats any chance of controlling the 60 seats in the Senate they would need to prevent a Republican filibuster. Every incumbent representative won re-election comfortably, including Bennie Thompson, a seven-term Democrat representing the Second District. Gregg Harper, a Republican, won the open seat in the Third District with 63 percent of the vote."
2008-11-06T00:00:00Z,"Senator Barack Obama may have been the toast of Europe since his visit this past summer, but a stop at the John F.

A YouTube clip of Mr. Obama's victory speech kicked off the postelection discussion at the public bilingual school on Wednesday, but the effort that Mr. Obama's American supporters found so inspired did not seem to sway the jaded teenagers, exposed to news of American wars in Afghanistan and Iraq and distrustful of his intense popularity here."

2008-11-06T00:00:00Z,"As Senator Barack Obama took one state after another, there was the occasional cheer, the occasional grunt of disgust, but mostly the soldiers looked serious. Either candidate could change their lives; where they served; how long they lived away from home or in harm's way. ''What's going to happen to us?'' asked Specialist Katherine Roy, of the First Battalion, 22nd Infantry Regiment Forward Support Company, Fourth Infantry Division.

2008-11-06T00:00:00Z,"Richard J. Durbin, the Democratic Party whip in the Senate, scored an easy victory over four challengers. Exit polls show that he excelled in pretty much every category: he carried the black and white votes, and he beat his closest challenger, Steve Sauerberg, a Republican, among voters of every age and income, except those who make more than $200,000 a year. Mr. Sauerberg, a physician from the western suburbs of Chicago, ran a largely self-financed campaign around classic Republican tenets of smaller government, lower taxes and a strong military. Mr. Durbin, meanwhile, embraced the government-as-safety-net approach, favoring, for example, subsidized health coverage for the uninsured."

Mr. Noriega, a two-term state representative from Houston who served a year in Afghanistan with the Texas Army National Guard and holds a master's degree from the John F. Kennedy School of Government at Harvard, tried to portray Mr. Cornyn as a ''tax-and-borrow'' conservative out of touch with Texas families.

About twice as many Ohioans said, after voting, that they had been contacted by an Obama volunteer urging their vote as said they had been contacted by a McCain supporter.

There was certainly something calming about his crisp responses, his clear sense of competence, and his obvious confidence. He also had an easy banter with the press that went down easily. Franklin Roosevelt had all of those qualities. But Roosevelt was also a beacon of hope and inspiration during the dark days of the Depression, and that is what this country desperately needs now, as it tries to claw its way out of this awful recession and a financial crisis that is far from over."

2008-11-07T14:08:23Z,"This is one of those weekends that could turn the college football landscape on its head. What if Texas Tech AND Alabama were to lose? I know that's unlikely, but nothing's impossible in college football. Think about it for a second. Don't you kind of see this season as being one with a huge glut of one-loss teams combined with an undefeated Penn State waiting in the wings? And heaven help the Big Ten if an undefeated Penn State gets blown out by a one-loss Southeastern Conference or Big 12 team in the national title game. Can you imagine the outcry from the conference that was shut out of the game? Or from a one-loss U.S.C.? I know that I am getting ahead of myself here. There's lots of college football to be played, and we're all hoping that things are going to neatly play themselves out with two undefeated teams competing for the national title, but I'm getting the feeling that this season is going to be chaos, which is simultaneously frustrating as well as wildly entertaining. Of course, our president-elect seems to be in favor of a college football playoff, but I think he has some more pressing matters to attend to first. Anyway, settle in for a solid Saturday of college football and don't take it for granted. There aren't that many left this season.3:30 P.M., No. 1 Alabama at No. 16 L.S.U., CBSAnnouncers: Verne Lundquist, Gary Danielson, Tracy WolfsonAs long as Nick Saban is at Alabama, it is going to be a big story whenever he faces his former team. Saban won a national title with L.S.U. before bolting to the Dolphins. And if that weren't bad enough, Saban then jilted the Dolphins to take the job at Alabama, which is not only a conference rival of L.S.U.'s but also is in the same division. Last season, Saban's replacement, Les Miles, led the Tigers to a victory over Alabama on their way to a national title. This season, Saban takes the No. 1 team in the nation into what is sure to be a hostile environment in Baton Rouge against an L.S.U. team that could save its season with a victory over the Tide. Phew. This is going to be a good one. SEC football is like no other. What other conferences have these kinds of blood feuds?"

2008-11-07T00:00:00Z,"The State Supreme Court ruled that a state law requiring sex offenders to register with law enforcement agencies and appear on a public list violated the constitutional guarantee of equal protection because it treats juvenile offenders more harshly than adults. The decision dealt with a Butte County case in which a boy admitted that he committed two counts of first-degree rape when he was 15. A judge ordered that the boy be placed in custody and register as a sex offender. Adult offenders sometimes get a suspended imposition of sentence, meaning a conviction is in essence wiped out if the person completes probation and the offender may then be able to have his name removed from the sex-offender registry. The boy’s lawyers argued that the law is unconstitutional because juveniles cannot get a suspended imposition of sentence. The ruling means it is possible all juvenile sex offenders will have to be removed from the sex-offender registry, Attorney General Larry Long said."

In an opinion issued Oct. 31, the judge, Terrence McVerry of Federal District Court, agreed with the government that he did not have the jurisdiction to second-guess the Department of Energy’s decision to deny Dr. Ganayni his security clearance.

2008-11-07T00:00:00Z,"MONTANA--Dr. John B . AIDS specialist/Gay Activist, dies at 61. John Buscemi Montana, M.D., gay man, physician, generous humanitarian, New Yorker, world traveler and art aficionado, died at Mt. Sinai Hospital early Monday morning, September 29, 2008. The cause of death was acute myelogenous leukemia (AML), diagnosed less than one year ago. Dr. Montana was one of the first NYC physicians to identify and treat people with AIDS at the outset of the epidemic in 1981. He saw many cases among his friends and the gay men who comprised a large portion of his internal medicine practice on lower Fifth Avenue in Greenwich Village. Dr. Montana, the son of Vanni Buscemi Montana and Helen Bortnovski Montana, was born in Huntington, Long Island, NY on March 13, 1947. His parents met in Europe during World War II. John's father was politically active in anti-fascist and socialist causes in his native Sicily; he died in 1991. John's own politics reflected his father's leftist leanings. His mother Helene perished in an apartment fire in February, 2003. A product of New York City public schools, Dr. Montana graduated from Harpur College (SUNY Binghamton) in 1969 where he majored in Science and Mathematics. He taught junior high school in Newark, New Jersey for two years before attending medical school. Dr. Montana graduated New York Medical College, Valhalla in 1975. After working at Cabrini-Stuyvesant Polyclinic, he opened his internal medicine practice in 1984. He was an attending physician at Cabrini Medical Center until it closed. Then he attended at St. Vincent's Hospital. Dr. Montana's illness caused him to close his medical practice in mid-December, 2007. The AIDS epidemic motivated him to focus his practice on treating AIDS-related opportunistic infections and cancers--which signaled fatality in less than two years at the beginning of the epidemic. His beloved partner, Jimmie Jackson, died from AIDS early on, and his death both devastated and deeply politicized John to continue the fight against AIDS. A firm proponent of safer-sex, Dr. Montana advised the Gay Men's Health Crisis (GMHC) on medical issues from its inception. He lectured on AIDS to community and professional groups throughout the city and was politically involved in ACT-UP and other AIDS-related organizations. John gave generously of his time and money to many gay community organizations including Senior Action in a Gay Environment (SAGE) and the Callen-Lorde Community Health Center. Until the end of his life, he maintained his conviction that the right-wing-dominated, federal government covertly propagated the epidemic, if not intentionally, then by intentional negligence--the ultimate goal being the elimination of the gay community. A gay-civil-rights activist and life-long Democrat, he was horrified at the response of the Reagan and Bush presidencies to AIDS and gay rights issues in general. He became inconsolable when his long-term partner, Daniel C., was deported from this country in 1999. Being bi-lingual, John was a benefactor to many in New York's Latino communities, and especially to Daniel's family. Dr. Montana often visited South America where he was a benefactor to small villages helping poor people at local medical clinics. Dr. Montana was a patron of the arts whether for museum-sponsored projects or for individual, fledgling, gay artists including E. J. Weiss, Ferron Bell and William Schwedler. He especially appreciated the works of Charles Demuth. John loved New York City, but enjoyed traveling throughout Europe and South America. John had many patients and friends in diplomatic positions who hosted him in Brazil, Italy, France, and Spain. Recently he traveled to Turkey, and only two weeks before his death, he returned from a cruise to Venice and Greece with two friends who made his trip as comfortable as possible. He fell critically ill upon his return. John Montana is survived by his brother Victor and his nephew John, both of New Hampshire. He is deeply mourned by his cousins Vicki De Bruin-Tarlow, Carol Daniels, Jesse Kamras, and also by his close friends John Helmuth, Ron Illardo, Philip Kayal, Jim D'Eramo, Patrick Hacker, Joe Nicholson and Angel, who with others, nursed him daily near the end. He is also mourned by his extended family in Finland and Israel, and by his friends throughout the world, but most particularly by the New York City gay community that he shepherded courageously through the AIDS epidemic--Dr. John Montana was an AIDS hero. Dr. Montana's Memorial Service will be Sunday, November 23 at 3:30pm in the Auditorium (10th Floor) of St. Vincents Hospital, 170 West 12th Street, Greenwich Village. Family and friends are welcome. Any questions should be directed to Philip Kayal: pkayal@comcast.net."
2008-11-07T00:00:00Z,"CRYSTAL--Bernhardt , an accomplished artist, and gallery owner passed away on September 21, 2008 in New York City. Mr. Crystal was born on November 7, 1914 in Grand Rapids, Michigan. A self educated man, Bern, was blessed with a talent for turning his observations and opinions into imaginative sketches and drawings. While recuperating in a Scottish army hospital during World War II, he met Gen. Dwight Eisenhower, who asked Berns to sketch a portrait of him. ''Ike'' loved it, and encouraged Berns to use his talent in the war effort, which he did by creating powerful and humorous posters for war bonds. Eisenhower then sent him to D-Day at Omaha Beach as a combat artist, to interpret the war artistically. There were a handful of soldiers who came ashore that day with a rifle, a pistol, a pad and a pen. After the war, Bern opened the Washington Irving Gallery, in New York City, which collected and sold the work of fellow veteran combat artists, and an international body of artisans, representing such artists as Jack Levine, Alex Minewski, Marvin Cherney, George Luks, Jules Pascin, Ernest Fiene and a young artist named Zero Mostel. For over 50 years, the gallery was his home, and Sundays were spent holding court with many of the top artists, writers, and actors of the time, including James Cagney and Vincent Price. In 1996 he worked for Disney Animation, inventing unique animal characters for future projects, and a few years ago created a line of animated Greeting cards called ''The Fuzzees'' for the Target company. A most charismatic and funny man, who played Santa Claus in, ''When Harry Met Sally'', Berns made it his personal mission to make the Crystal family laugh with jokes, costumes, masks and songs. Billy Crystal, his nephew, recalls, ''He was a magical man to all of us, and always will be. He was a big reason I became a performer.'' Mr. Crystal was the subject of the HBO Documentary, ''My Uncle Berns'' which was inspired by the events of September 11th. It captured his life from boyhood to DDay to the tragedy of the World Trade Center. Berns and his wife Deborah had been living at The Hallmark, a senior residence, just one block away from the Towers. They were evacuated, inspiring his great niece, Lindsay Crystal to direct the award winning film, which was an official selection of the Tribeca Film Festival. Mr. Crystal is survived by his wife, Deborah, his daughter Dorothy Crystal Ross, nephews, Joel, Richard and Billy, loving nieces, Barbara, Fran and Janice, grandnieces, Jenny, Faithe, Lindsay, and Jackie, a grandnephew Jon, and greatgrandnieces, Holly, Ella, Laura, Dylan and a great-grandnephew, Shane."
