After serving in the Army during WWII at Fort Leonardwood, MO, he married his teenage sweetheart Mary LaRocco and helped his father expand a produce business which was established in 1934. The business grew exponentially after WWII when Mr. Endico and his brothers entered the business which morphed into one of the largest independent food processing company in the Eastern United States. Mr. Endico pioneered the French fry as we know it today. He built his own machines which are still used today. Originally setting up shop in the Bronx, Mr. Endico and his brothers expanded into farming and salad processing (Sally Sherman Salads). In 1951 Michael was the first Italian-American to buy a seat on the New York Mercantile Exchange where his brother Felix traded commodities for the company. Michael was a self made man who related to the man in the street as easily as he did in the board rooms of Del Monte where he was Vice President in 1967.

They hypothesize that extremely high rates of production in the prey, including algae; corals, clams and other invertebrates; and smaller fish, supports the predators. This is coupled with high rates at which prey are eaten or otherwise die (called ""turnover""). Another possibility is that the larger-bodied fish can live on relatively low amounts of food for many years, even decades, when protected from fishing."

2010-07-30T17:31:41Z,"In this Sunday's Book Review, Thomas Mallon reviews Geoffrey O'Brien's ""Fall of the House of Walworth,"" about a sensational parricide in an old and influential family in Saratoga Springs, N.Y., in 1873 - sensational enough, in fact, to merit O'Brien's subtitle: ""A Tale of Madness and Murder in Gilded Age America."" In the case, the deranged novelist Mansfield Tracy Walworth, largely forgotten now, but of some note in his own day, was shot to death by his son, Frank, in a Manhattan hotel room; Frank's motivation, it seems, was his father's brutal treatment of his mother, Ellen Walworth, one of the founders of the Daughters of the American Revolution. Mallon has high praise for O'Brien's ""crackerjack new history,"" and you should certainly read his elegant review first. But if we do say so, The New York Times's anonymous account on June 4, 1873, the day after the killing, is a surprisingly moving piece of journalism as well, full of passion and personal interest, a crackerjack little melodrama; such is the startling story, headlined ""A Terrible Parricide"":"

That's what I thought I was doing with this recipe when a friend told me he'd read it in the new ""River Cottage Preserves Handbook,"" written by Pam Corbin. It's called bachelor's jam, or sometimes officer's jam, and it isn't jam at all but rather a whip-smart method of both preserving the overflow of ripening summer fruit and infusing spirits with the same in a manner befitting, well, a bachelor and/or an officer. This makes for a ""preserve"" that comes into its own just in time to bring a welcome hit of summer fruit to the holidays. Once I started digging and found that the chef Roger Vergé has written on what is known as confiture de vieux garçon, and that it is also an old and well-loved treat in Germany (known as rumtopf, or ""rum pot""), I felt a bit less guilty about my plagiarism."

2010-07-30T15:59:49Z,"5:45 p.m. | Updated The programmers at MTV must have pumped their fists when the overnight ratings for ""Jersey Shore"" arrived on Friday. (Although they might not have been so thrilled Friday afternoon after seeing reports that one of the show's stars, Nicole Polizzi, known as Snooki, had been arrested in Seaside Heights, N.J., and accused of disorderly conduct.) The premiere of the second season of ""Jersey Shore"" attracted 5.3 million viewers on Thursday night, according to Nielsen, the network's biggest season premiere in more than seven years. The series about young people partying at the beach - it's really that simple - was a sensation last winter for MTV, peaking at 4.8 million viewers for the finale. But Thursday night's ratings indicate that the show has legs, even in the summer. Among MTV's core demographic of viewers 12 to 34 years old, the season premiere is the No. 1 cable telecast of the year. The series will follow the cast's exploits in South Beach, last spring in Florida; it is now filming their return to Seaside Heights this summer."

2010-07-30T11:41:19Z,"Jennifer Egan is the author of five works of fiction, most recently ""A Visit From the Goon Squad.""In your new book, the term ""Goon Squad"" refers to the passage of time. When Ringo Starr turned 70 recently, he told The Times that he still feels 24 inside. How old do you feel inside, and how do you think the passage of time affects our core identities?My mom used to say that if someone woke her up in the middle of the night and asked how old she was, she'd answer 27. Hearing her, I'd think: That's ridiculous; your job as my mom is to be old. Now, in my mid-40s, I find that I identify with people even younger than that - teenagers! If I had to pick one age, it would probably be 17: that period of looking like an adult but not quite being one, of pretending to be ""yourself"" (whoever that is) and praying that people will believe you; of having wild hopes about what kind of life you might have but also fearing you'll never make it out of the house - all of that still feels so immediate. Sometimes I'll watch teenagers and find myself not quite believing I'm older than they are - even wondering, delusionally, if they can see any difference between us. And yet my own kids will be teenagers soon, and when I talk to actual teens I'm vividly aware, of course, that they're children."

We are a group of four to six high-school friends in our mid-40s who get together every couple of months to recapture a little of our glory years. The typical plan is to find a restaurant that is fun but not too crazy, nice but not too expensive, has good beer, spirits and wine options and most important food that will appeal to a bunch of guys who don't have their significant others with them. Past choices have included Char No. 4 (this hit all the right notes between the bourbon, bacon and interesting cuts of meat), Resto (pretty good, especially the burgers, but not quite lively enough), Cafe Katja (a real hit with our crowd who liked the beers, wines and wurst), 5 Napkin Burger (not such a hit - felt mass produced), Markt (a plus for the Belgian beer and mussels but not quite at the level of some of the other places), Bond St (the wrong vibe entirely). We typically get together on a weeknight fairly early so getting into most places should not be impossible. Most of us are based in Manhattan but one of our group lives on Long Island so if the place is reasonably accessible to subway lines that go to the LIRR (either Penn or Brooklyn) that is a plus."

Twenty minutes from Palma, the sprawling structure is almost completely buried and all but imperceptible from both land and sea. Only the canopies of the lounges on the terrace are visible on the horizon. The local architect Antonio Obrador - who did the seaside retreats of, among others, Claudia Schiffer and Michael Douglas - let the structure's past set the design tone. The 24 rooms and suites are fashioned from old munitions stores and connected by a series of sunlit ramps and alleyways to the many vaulted public spaces. The old gunpowder depot is now a dimly lit space for private parties, with gun carriages serving as cocktail tables and stylized bullets as door handles. There are two restaurants, including one waterside, and an infinity pool created from one of the ramparts. Soon to be completed will be a wooden jetty, from which guests can sail, dive and water-ski the aquamarine Mediterranean."

Mr. Ritter was a prodigious and creative force in a life-long pursuit of social justice, establishing national non-profit models for integrated, affordable housing in the early 1960's with his wife, Patricia Ritter, Jackie Robinson and Eleanor Roosevelt. He was an attorney for Rev. Martin Luther King, Jr. at the beginning of Dr. King's career. Mr. Ritter's great talent was forging public policy for the disenfranchised. He was key in establishing a 40-hour work week, collective bargaining and ""last best offer"" binding arbitration for Connecticut government employees. In the 1950's, he organized some of Connecticut's first municipal unions. From the 1950's through the 1970's he served as Hartford Corporation Counsel, a Democratic member of the Hartford City Council and then a Connecticut State Representative. He practiced law in Hartford for more than 50 years. His big heart, courage, originality, frankness and optimism will be sorely missed. He was born in New York City on March 26, 1920 to Charles and Gertrude Ritter. For 58 years he was married to Patricia Kingsley Ritter, his partner in social activism and life, who died in 2004.

2010-08-01T00:00:00Z,"Over a five-decade career, Dennis Hopper earned the well-deserved mantle of the rebellious auteur, actor and all-around American artist. Whether it was post-Depression-era angst, the Beat generation's age of exploration, Vietnam War resistance or 1980s venomous debauchery, Hopper's performances reflected the shifting psyche of America's cultural landscape. On screen he appeared unafraid, even fiercely entrenched in the zeitgeist. Now the late actor's art, much of which is unknown to a large public, is the focus of an exhibition at the Museum of Contemporary Art in Los Angeles entitled ''Dennis Hopper Double Standard.'' To heighten the drama of the occasion, this exhibition - which had been bumped up on the schedule due to Hopper's failing health - is the first for the museum's newly installed director, Jeffrey Deitch. Wearing his trademark New York pinstripes, Deitch was in full swing. (Consider the old story about how the pinstripes of the Yankees' uniforms were designed to distract the competition.) While the show largely under-delivers in depth of content, it is regardless, if not regrettably, a timely exhibition, one that is ideally suited to L.A. and that marks precisely the kind of quick command that Deitch has in his new role."

In 1976 he came to San Francisco to become the general manager of the Stanford Court Hotel. During his five years there the property was one of the best hotels in the country and a center of the emerging American food scene. In 1981 he left to develop and operate the Campton Place Hotel. Both the hotel and its eponymous restaurant were immediate hits as were his cooks who included Jan Birnbaum, Bradley Ogden, George Marrone, Craig Stoll and Charlie Trotter. In 1989 he recreated Campton Place in downtown Los Angeles with the Checkers Hotel, where Jerry Comfort and later Thomas Keller served as chefs. After his business partners sold the hotels he bought Greenleaf Produce in 1993, building that business into the largest company on the San Francisco Produce Market.

He had nothing to do and nowhere to go, so he bought an old Volkswagen bus, nicknamed Piglet, and headed south for Greece. I joined him for a week in Crete, and we spent our time camping and traveling and meeting people from all over the world like we did in our 20s. Keep in mind we are both in our 40s now and are supposed to have settled down. Travel is freedom, and the smallest things become an adventure. It's a departure from the everyday that reminds you that there is a huge world out there worth exploring.'' Timothy Williams, Indianapolis"

In addition, a nifty interactive map integrates several countries' national rail services with Eurostar lines, allowing travelers to book multi-destination journeys without having to brave an array of foreign-language Web sites. A warning: ticket prices displayed on the itinerary map are at the cheapest possible rate and can become unavailable very quickly. The actual price, found further along the booking process, can be significantly more expensive than the one initially displayed.

Vogue followed up in its current issue with ''Classic Revival, a spread that showed off the sort of tightly structured handbags Grace Kelly favored in ''Rear Window.'' The bland expressions, hyper-fastidious grooming and starchy frocks of the models were vividly in keeping with tirelessly calculated efforts by the fashion community to resurrect the decorum, apparent tidiness - and subterranean naughtiness - of Cheever country in the early 1960s."

It was April, I think, when I noticed a nest on top of my neighbors' air-conditioner. Inside, two little eggs received full-time attention from a couple of pigeons. It was like having a private National Geographic show. I pointed it out to guests and even texted my roommate when the babies were born. I had expected the feathered family to leave after that, but no. Another egg was laid. And another. By the time it got warm, the dynasty had developed a full sense of proprietorship of the airshaft."

2010-08-01T00:00:00Z,"LIVING ROOMS Many architects trained in the 1960s and '70s moved into old houses or prewar apartments themselves. Their renovations showed that it was possible to be creative, modern and historically respectful at the same time. These projects showed up in magazines, creating a taste for inventively remodeled old buildings. Exposed brick interior walls became common, along with decorative moldings, daring color combinations and exposed columns. Despite the rising crime rates and urban riots of the 1960s, a growing number of middle- and upper-middle-class residents began to move into urban areas in the 1970s and '80s, at least partly because of their cheap, historic housing stock. But the trendiness of the old embraced by the early postmodernists likely had something to do with it as well. Urban streets developed such cachet that they turned up in television programs like ''Sesame Street,'' which premiered in 1969, and ''The Cosby Show,'' which ran from 1984 to 1992."
2010-08-01T00:00:00Z,"LATSHAW--John, 88 known as ""Big John"", a beloved friend, and father, passed away on July 18, 2010, in Naples, Florida. Born in Kansas City on December 10, 1921 to a prominent family in the area since the early 1800's. His family fortune was wiped out in the Depression and still only a boy; John found five jobs while going to school when most men couldn't find one. As a young man, he started out as a cashier for the securities firm of Harris, Upham. One day, he was asked to fill in for a stock trader who was sick. Though shy, he quickly showed he was a natural born trader ""not a charts and research"" trader but a visceral trader whose great instinct would benefit many people, for decades to come. In 1954, Big John was a managing partner of Uhlmann & Latshaw, which then merged with EF Hutton & Co. making him the youngest partner in Hutton's history. He rose to become Executive Vice President, managing director, member of the executive committee and director of E.F. Hutton Inc., the E.F. Hutton Group and E.F. Hutton International and his opinions on the economy have been widely quoted, and he was an oft-requested speaker. When most men retire, he did and became the Chairman of the Board, and Chief Executive Officer of B.C. Christopher & Company. Later, he left the brokerage business to become Chief Executive Officer, Chairman and owner of what he named Latshaw Enterprises, Inc., which included Latshaw Tools, Wescon Products Company, Anderson & Forrester, Coast Wire & Plastic Tech, Inc., and MC Electronics, and held positions at numerous other ventures. Civic duty ran in his family and President Harry Truman, who was friends with his uncle, Judge Latshaw, befriended him as a young man so John was always involved in politics not just as a contributor for local, state and national races but by devoting his time for his friends who ran for state office or working on national campaigns such as: running the Re-elect Nixon campaign for Missouri and Kansas for the landslide victory in 1972. Later, he was National Chairman of Democrats for Ford as he was, in fact, a life-long Democrat, which illustrates his independent spirit and preference for people not adherence to rigid ideas and he was a great supporter on both sides of the aisle. He was appointed His Majesties' Royal Thai Consul to the United States by His Majesty the King of Thailand. Years later, in 1983, at Saranrom Palace, Bangkok, Thailand, Mr. Latshaw was decorated by the Prime Minister of Thailand with the Chaturathabhorn of the Most Exalted Order of the White Elephant Award, the highest award given to a civilian, in honor of their contributions to Thailand. A decade later, he was decorated with The Knight Commander of the Most Noble Order of the Crown of Thailand at the Thai Embassy in Washington, D.C. He was also honored and made a Knight Hospitalier of Malta by the Sovereign Order of St. John of Jerusalem. He received the Citation of Merit for Outstanding Achievement and Meritorious Service in Business and Public Administration in 1957, the first year such an award was given by the University of Missouri. On April 30, 1970, in the U.S. Senate, he was given the Golden Eagle Award for ""defending the principles of capital formation, achievements in business and civic action, and full dedication of economic freedom in all its broad humanity"". His interests were not limited to finances or politics so with his friend, Lamar Hunt, he helped bring the unknown sport of soccer to the United Sates, forming the North American Soccer League and his team, the Kansas City Spurs, won the first championship. He was part of the introduction of cable television to the United States and as chairman, formed a coalition of civic leaders to create the fifth largest cable operation in the United States, American Cablevision. His exceptional dynamism and talent enabled him to serve on an unusual number of organizations and charitable causes among which: the NASA Advisory Board to the President of the United States, 1983-1986; He was member of the Exec. Board of the Religious Heritage of America Executive Board, Invest-in-America A member of the Society of Fellows- the Nelson Gallery of Art; and the Chairman- Board of Trustees the Conservatory of Music. He was truly ""larger than life"". When asked how tall he was, he would wryly reply ""five foot-twenty"". Yet it was not due to his stature but because of the kind person he was that everyone called him ""Big John"". He was a loyal friend, an inspiration to his co-workers, and was a mentor to many. He was an innovative thinker who refused to quit. He loved life and lived by his motto of ""making money and having fun - but not one without the other"" and made life, frankly, just more fun. A gentleman with a delightful sense of humor, and an impish grin, he always had a twinkle in his eye. In his teens, he could clear the dance floor but even at the end of his life, he could still make women swoon as they fondly recalled, ""he was the best dancer"". He was well known throughout the world but always proud to be from Kansas City - a city he loved so much and supported, and his adopted home of Naples, Florida. He was preceded in death by his parents, Edna Parker Latshaw and Ross W. Latshaw; his son, Henry John Latshaw III; his brothers, Parker Latshaw, Robert Latshaw, and sister, Mercedes Anderson. He leaves behind his two daughters: Lady Jaffray, Constance, and Elizabeth Albright Latshaw."

Both are essays about highly-cerebral, possibly-overeducated celebrity actors whose peculiar personae are more interesting than any of the movies they've made. Both are the work of extremely skillful and engaging writers. But Anderson's profile is an exercise in rueful wonderment, whereas Corsello's profile is a brutal takedown. Franco's intellectual pretentions are celebrated and his eccentricities are smiled upon; Sorvino's intellectual ambitions are used against her and her eccentricities mercilessly mocked. Anderson goes out of his way to insist that Franco's academic work is legitimate; Corsello makes fun of Sorvino for talking about her honors thesis. Anderson takes a rueful attitude toward the gulf between Franco's ambitions and his actual body of work; Corsello has a good time making fun of ""Romy and Michelle's High School Reunion.""

Who brought style and humor and exacting standards to hotels and restaurants and the food business in the Bay Area for over 25 years, died on July 19 at his home in San Francisco. He was 68. Bill was born in The Bronx and raised in Yonkers. After graduating from hotel school at Paul Smiths College he began his career at Restaurant Associates. He left Restaurant Associates for a stint in the Navy, returning to civilian life as the assistant food and beverage manager at the Waldorf-Astoria. He left the Waldorf for a corporate job at Intercontinental Hotels. He traveled the world for Intercon before he went to Maui in 1975 to open the Intercon at Wailea as resident manager. In 1976 he came to San Francisco to become the general manager of the Stanford Court Hotel. During his five years there the property was one of the best hotels in the country and a center of the emerging American food scene. In 1981 he left to develop and operate the Campton Place Hotel. Both the hotel and its eponymous restaurant were immediate hits as were his cooks who included Jan Birnbaum, Bradley Ogden, George Marrone, Craig Stoll and Charlie Trotter. In 1989 he recreated Campton Place in downtown Los Angeles with the Checkers Hotel, where Jerry Comfort and later Thomas Keller served as chefs. After his business partners sold the hotels he bought Greenleaf Produce in 1993, building that business into the largest company on the San Francisco Produce Market. Bill was an active member of the community as well as a successful businessman. He served twice as the chairman of the San Francisco Chamber of Commerce and also served on the boards of the Ft. Mason Center, the Hotel Council, the local Salvation Army, and the Produce Market. He was known for his stories, his compassion, and most of all the grace with which he treated his employees and customers.

2010-08-03T09:41:59Z,"In an extreme case of camel coat envy, a frustrated New York socialite who had long fetishized the trench coat Ali MacGraw wore in ‘‘Love Story’’ engaged a patternmaker last year to copy it in caramel cashmere, down to the patch pockets and double-wide lapel and collar (which, like MacGraw’s character, Jenny, you gotta wear popped). From Paris to New York, from Kate Moss to Blake Lively (who seem to be as attached to their fawn-colored coats as Grace Kelly and Katharine Hepburn were to theirs), camel is dans l’air this fall. Céline’s Phoebe Philo jump-started the trend last spring with the ultimate boyfriend coat, a honey-toned Crombie. Jean Paul Gaultier — in his penultimate, fall collection for Hermès — showed a three-quarter camel coat pinched from the guys, saving his most luxurious discursion for duffel coats like the ones once worn by the British Royal Navy. Michael Kors imagined a gender mix-up at the coat check, or maybe that blushingly erotic moment when a gentleman slips his camel coat over his date’s chilly shoulders. If it’s all beginning to sound like a male conspiracy, well, a lot of women’s outerwear in the buff register does lead back to the blokes. Think of the peacoat — and the polo coat. Around 1900, polo players began wrapping themselves in camel ‘‘wait coats’’ — patterned, essentially, on a dressing gown — to keep warm between chukkers. Later, women borrowed freely of the details: half belt, full cut, chest pocket. In 1949 the camel coat was the American coed’s favorite. Kors made winking reference to all that history, pairing a great big muff of a fur skirt with a camel knit tee. Among the other camel offerings were satin blouses and high-waisted slacks (Chloé), even a strapless dress (Gianfranco Ferré). But in the end, it was the camel coat that scored, whether sable-trimmed at Carolina Herrera or sleeveless at Alexander Wang. A real love story."

The volunteers, between 18 and 35, were physically active, and many were competitive athletes. They agreed, rather bravely, to be randomly assigned to one of two groups and accept radically different treatments for their torn A.C.L.'s. The first group began physical therapy and then underwent surgical reconstruction of the ligament, considered by many people to be the best option for injured athletes. The second group received only physical therapy, with the option to have the operation later. Twenty-three subjects of that group did eventually have the operation. (For those fortunate enough not to be personally familiar with A.C.L. surgery, reconstruction involves replacing the injured ligament with tissue from elsewhere in your own leg or from a cadaver.)"

2010-08-04T00:00:00Z,"OBITUARIES An obituary on July 16 about the statistician and mathematician David Blackwell gave an incorrect account of Mr. Blackwell's time spent as a member of the Institute for Advanced Study in Princeton, N.J., in 1941 and 1942. He was denied the right to attend lectures or do research at Princeton University; the university did not refuse to grant him the courtesy title of assistant professor, as Mr. Blackwell recalled in an interview in the 1980s. The obituary also referred incorrectly to his tenure at the institute. He completed a one-year fellowship; he did not leave early. And the obituary referred imprecisely to the institute's connection to Princeton University. While the Institute for Advanced Study is located in Princeton, it is not part the university."
2010-08-04T00:00:00Z,"CRANE--Sarah Ann Molloy, ""Sally,"" 75, passed away peacefully in her sleep in her home in Santa Fe, NM, on August 1. Sally was born in Rockville Center, NY, and raised in an extended family in Haverstraw, NY. She lived with her beloved Aunt Anne McCabe after both of her parents died. After graduating from Simmons College in 1956, Sally spent a year in Vienna, Austria, helping to resettle refugees from the Hungarian Revolution. After returning to New York City, she worked for a short time in the Personnel Department of The New York Times. She married Benjamin F. Crane (now a retired partner of the law firm Cravath, Swaine & Moore LLP) on February 8, 1959, after a whirlwind courtship. They celebrated their 50th anniversary in 2009 surrounded by family and many friends from their years together. They settled in Brooklyn Heights, and eventually had a home in Cold Spring, NY, as well as in Santa Fe. Sally was actively involved on the boards of many charitable institutions, getting her start as the President of the Junior League of Brooklyn. She went on to serve for many years on the boards of Planned Parenthood of New York City (including one term as President), the Bedford-Stuyvesant Restoration Corporation, Trinity School in Manhattan (which her children attended), the Brooklyn Heights Association, Colony-South Brooklyn Houses, the New York Women's Foundation, and Simmons College, her alma mater, where from 2000-2004 she co-chaired a hugely successful fundraising campaign. Simmons granted her an honorary doctorate in public service, and she established a scholarship fund at the college for students in need. Sally had an exceptional gift for making friends and for helping others through her work and philanthropy. She was also the organizing force for keeping together the extended McCabe-Molloy clan. Everywhere she spent time and lived, Sally gathered new and old friends together and participated actively in the local scene. With her radiant smile and beautiful blue eyes, Sally was a force of nature, combining fun, humor, vigor, intellect, inspiration, warmth, and a passionate love for life. Her passing leaves a gaping hole in many interconnected worlds and in so many hearts. In addition to the love of her life, Ben, she is survived by her sister, Catherine Molloy, CND, of Kumbo, Cameroon, her son Michael and wife Kate of London, England, her daughter Betsy of Denver, Colorado, her daughter Susan and partner Karen Newman, also of London, and seven grandchildren, all of whom cherished her and loved her dearly. In lieu of flowers, charitable contributions may be made in Sally's honor to Planned Parenthood of New York City or the Sarah Molloy Crane '56 Scholarship Fund at Simmons College in Boston. The family is planning to hold a memorial service in New York City in the fall to celebrate Sally's life; please check www.memorialebook.com (Sarah Ann Molloy Crane) for details as they become available."

The film, directed by Yael Hersonski, dissects a Nazi propaganda film that purported to depict life among Jews in the Warsaw ghetto during World War II but actually manipulated its portrayal to reinforce anti-Jewish policies. The rating bars those under 17 from seeing the film without an accompanying parent or guardian. Oscilloscope argued that a similar film, ""The Last Days,"" on which Steven Spielberg was an executive producer, had been rated PG-13. Spokesmen for the ratings administration did not immediately respond to a query. Oscilloscope said the board ruled 12 to 3 against changing the rating.

Anna Sui's eponymous biography (Chronicle Books), on the other hand, is a more visual feast. Written by Andrew Bolton, a curator at the Costume Institute at the Metropolitan Museum of Art, this book will showcase 400 photographs from the Sui archives and include text by the White Stripes frontman Jack White and her longtime collaborator Steven Meisel. Finally, two photographers put the art in Rodarte in a new book from JRP Ringier.

This mix master wasn't a model or a downtown doyenne: it was Ruth Flowers, a k a Mamy Rock, a grandmother well into her 70s who has put in appearances at Cannes, Glastonbury and Paris, where her ''factotum'' is based. ''I thought, What are they going to think of this old biddy who gets up there to play records?'' she says from her home in southwest England. Inspired to become a D.J. when she attended her grandson's birthday party, Flowers has worked with a French producer on mixing, as well as on her ''stage persona,'' which includes a hairstyle that ''looks as if I've been plugged into an electricity cord.'' Spinning has eclipsed some of her other hobbies, like giving historical talks about Henry VIII, but she's happy to be busy. ''When you get to 60, that's when you just go to bingo, I suppose,'' she says, adding unnecessarily, ''That's not my scene.''"

They're remarkably pretty, and they satisfy the current food-geist of homemade and arcane."

Her reply? She responded, ""It's not abnormal for me to get gifts, I get gifts all the time."" She also claimed she didn't even know the stones, which she subsequently donated to charity, were diamonds: ""I'm used to seeing diamonds shiny and in a box, that's the kind of diamonds I'm used to seeing.""

While other towns - notably Seattle, Los Angeles, Atlanta and Charleston, S.C. - also serve cheap eats in the late afternoon, Portland has been doing it since the last recession. If you ask restaurant owners, they'll tell you the back story: a state liquor law forbids businesses from promoting discounted alcohol, so it made sense to lure in diners with at-cost food. (Though this law has recently changed, $5 plates are more ubiquitous than ever.) And this being Portland, you're more likely to find charcuterie plates or pig heart with quince jam on the menu than sliders and fries."

As Cathy of California, Callahan creates whimsical shop windows and styles merchandise for Los Angeles shops like Heath Ceramics; the fashion boutique Market; Stripes, an upscale shoe store in Bel Air; and Yolk, a purveyor of groovy gifts and housewares in Silver Lake. The garland of bright yellow marshmallow Peeps that graced Yolk's window around Easter time was Cathy of California's handiwork. Callahan's displays blend elegance, whimsy and humor; her windows often include cheeky one-liners. Her current window for Market, which features hanging embroidery hoops festooned with paper price tags, declares, ""Tag, you're it!"" She's also an avid crafter and often makes the props for her displays. When a client wanted to buy the props from a display that was coming down, Callahan added a handmade craft business to her repertory. Her colorful vintage-inspired creations - like plump toadstool pincushions and bright butterfly brooches - sell out quickly at West Coast indie craft fairs like Renegade and Felt Club. Callahan once appeared on Martha Stewart's TV show, kindly but firmly demonstrating to the design maven herself how to make straw flowers from a vintage kit."

But the discovery of six reels of behind-the-scenes footage from 1960 forever fractures the movie's cool, calculated surface. With a Super-8 camera, Françoise Spira, a young cast member with a bit part, produced what seems like an amateur version of the film itself, her relationship to its protagonist, played by Delphine Seyrig, as intimate as Resnais's. Spira committed suicide a few years later, and her celluloid diary languished until 2008. The movie's second assistant director, Volker Schlöndorff, later turned it into the documentary ''The Making of 'Last Year at Marienbad,' '' which Diane von Furstenberg toasted at her studio in June after a screening at New York University. Schlöndorff was there, as well as Jean-Luc Godard's biographer Richard Brody, the photographer Steven Klein, Ahn Duong, Daphne Guinness and the documentary's principal promoter, Bernard-Henri Lévy."

(Cinemax) THE BOX (2009) A stranger (Frank Langella) bearing a gift worth a million dollars arrives on the doorstep of Norma and Arthur (James Marsden and Cameron Diaz, above), a Virginia couple living somewhat beyond their means. All they have to do is push a red button -- after which someone will die. ''The actors are fine, and to watch Norma trying to persuade Arthur that they need to push the button is to realize that Ms. Diaz should go dark more often,'' Manohla Dargis wrote in The New York Times about this adaptation of Richard Matheson's short story ''Button, Button,'' by the director Richard Kelly. '' 'The Box' is alternately fluid and inspired, and rarely dull (though it is a little, on occasion),'' she added. ''There are, as with his previous films, various visual gifts, like the spooky image of an airplane hangar glowing in the night and the odd image of Norma's little toe waving like a finger. But Mr. Kelly is so busy sampling genres and confusing the issue that he rarely gives you time or space to enjoy them. In the end, he often seems as lost as his characters, trapped in a Pandora's box of his own making.''

Every Sunday, we'd jump in the car with driving directions and hope, the latter often dashed before we even got out of the car. The open houses were often short stories unto themselves: what exactly - or who - was behind that padlocked door in the hall? Who thought to put the kitchen next to the master bedroom? What sort of people suspend a suit of armor over their bed? One constant behind all the front doors was the fast and cheap kitchen renovation. Done no doubt at the urging of the real estate agent, who warned that no one would ever buy a house without an updated kitchen, these cookie-cutter remodels featured identical green granite countertops, frosted glass cabinet doors (revealing a hint of the Italian pasta boxes inside), black and white checkerboard floor tile and wannabe Viking ranges."

2010-08-08T00:00:00Z,"The American fashion industry has been pushing hard over the last four years for copyright protection for its designs. An earlier bill in the House was deemed too broad; clothing makers argued that protection against knock-offs would only encourage frivolous lawsuits from people claiming they had the idea first. Today, after a year of negotiations, Senator Charles E. Schumer introduced a bill that seemed to satisfy the different sides of the fashion industry - and may provide some protection, too. The bill, the Innovative Design Protection and Piracy Prevention Act, has the support of the Council of Fashion Designers of America (CFDA), whose individual members represent the creative core of the industry, and the American Apparel & Footwear Association (AAFA), which represents more than 700 manufacturers and suppliers and by its estimate accounts for about 75 percent of the industry's business. The AAFA had argued that the House bill was too broad and would expose its members to lawsuits."

''Pretty smooth,'' he said, grinning, after a brief test drive on the Volt's factory floor in Hamtramck, Mich. Others criticized Chevrolet's parent company, General Motors, for pricing the car beyond the reach of many taxpayers who buoyed the corporation before its June 2009 bankruptcy filing. That invective has grown amid reports that some of the 600 dealers selected to participate in the Volt's initial rollout, which is limited to California, Texas, Michigan, New York, New Jersey, Connecticut and the nation's capital are charging above the manufacturer's suggested retail price for the Volt. Dealers, meanwhile, feel that runaway consumer demand for the limited-production car handily justifies a price premium."

Part espresso bar (serving cold-brewed iced coffee, with a Zen-like patio out back to better enjoy it), part meticulously curated boutique (stocking high-end sunglasses and Levi's XX work wear, in addition to Japanese wet suits and rare boards), it has, since opening last August, become the unofficial clubhouse for the highly stylized urban-surf set. And its new in-house line of Breton-striped sweatshirts, color-blocked swim trunks and graphic T-shirts is its member uniform. ''Our take on surf culture is unique,'' said Josh Rosen, a founder, along with Colin Tunstall and Morgan Collett. ''It has a New York sensibility. It's more fashion-driven.'' Note that a hang-loose attitude is required while wearing the clothing. Actual surfing skills? Not so much."

Among his several thousand snaps are images of friends, lovers, cool cars, gorgeous sunsets, all of which wonderfully capture the hazy decadence of the era.

Passengers who have checked in can swipe their boarding passes at gates reminiscent of turnstiles and then proceed to their departing flight. ''One gate has been tested, and so far we've been pleased with what we've learned with the experience,'' said Christen David, spokeswoman for Continental Airlines, who said that the airline had been experimenting with self-boarding since June. ''When we speed up the boarding process, it facilitates flights departing the gate on time,'' she said.While Houston's airport may be the nation's laboratory for self-boarding, the process is hardly new. As reported by USA Today, last year there were 14 airlines using self-boarding gates.

2010-08-08T00:00:00Z,"AXELROD--Leon, 92, passed away on August 6 at his home in Palm Beach, Florida. Active and vigorous and an inspiration to his family and friends throughout his life, Leon embodied the creative spirit professionally and personally, creating beauty from inert stone, as well as being the patriarch of a cohesive and loving family who endearingly dubbed him Poppy. Leon was a self-made man with a consistent positive outlook on life. He was born in Chicago and raised in New York. After studying engineering at the Brooklyn Polytechnic Institute, he changed directions to cope with the hardships imposed by the great depression and learned to manufacture leather goods, eventually becoming a founding partner of Walco. Ultimately his combined experiences and talents in technology and design found permanent expression as a sculptor resulting in a body of unique works that wedded fluidity and motion with substance and strength within hundreds of pounds of stone. His works have been exhibited in galleries throughout the United States with permanent installations at NYU Langone Medical Center in New York City, and Jackson Memorial and Mt. Sinai Hospitals in Miami. He was the beloved husband of Florence, who passed in 2001, and present dear husband of Carole, loving father to Felicia and Alice, adoring father in law to Robert Porges and Monroe Chaikin, proud grandfather to John Porges, Vicki Porges Eisner, Melissa Chaikin Kahn, and Eric Chaikin, and their respective spouses, Alex, Joe, and Greg, and cherished great-grandfather to Dylan and David Porges, Erin and Jesse Eisner, and Faye and Miles Kahn. Leon leaves a legacy of love and beauty that will last forever. In lieu of flowers, contributions can be made to the Dysautonomia Foundation Inc, 315 W 39th St, Suite 701, New York, NY 10018."

Beautiful, elegant, spirited, and accomplished: Joanna's sudden death is a great loss to those of us who knew and loved her, both here and abroad. She was born in Greenpoint, Brooklyn and spent her school years at St. Agnes Episcopal School for Girls in Albany, New York. She was accepted to Smith College, where she discovered her love of the theatre, a passion that endured throughout her life. After graduating from Smith she went to work as a copy writer for Young & Rubicam in New York where a few years later she was introduced to world-renowned photographer Edward Steichen by his brother-in-law, poet Carl Sandburg. She married Steichen at the age of twenty-seven; he was eighty. After his death in 1973 she became the guardian and gatekeeper of Steichen's legacy and his work. She earned her master's degree in social work from Columbia University and her professional life was spent as a psychotherapist in private practice. Leisure time was devoted to travel, friends, opera, theatre and music. She was the author of several books and many articles. She was an advocate for the Montauk Library, the Montauk Playhouse, and the Hampton Day School. After she was diagnosed with Parkinson's she worked tirelessly with the Parkinson's Disease Foundation for improved care, better education, and special exercise regimes for patients battling this relentless and devastating illness. Joanna Steichen died unexpectedly of complications from Parkinson's disease at her summer home in Montauk, New York on July 24, 2010. She was 77.

Anything more down-to-earth, so to speak, was -- no offense -- for wusses. Well, no more. For fall, quite a few designers made a case for the practical, working gal's pump, sending out incarnations with a rather saucy appeal. Take, for instance, those at Stella McCartney: pointy nude versions that seemed to disappear on the foot. Or the lipstick-red styles at Isabel Marant, below. Embellished with a flirty bow, they assumed a kind of Betty Rizzo rebel feel. For its finale, Dolce & Gabbana sent out a small army of leggy women dressed in smartly tailored jackets and simple black heels. Perhaps it was the fact that they weren't wearing pants, but they had some serious sex appeal. And were able to walk so quickly!"

Leon was a self-made man with a consistent positive outlook on life. He was born in Chicago and raised in New York. After studying engineering at the Brooklyn Polytechnic Institute, he changed directions to cope with the hardships imposed by the great depression and learned to manufacture leather goods, eventually becoming a founding partner of Walco. Ultimately his combined experiences and talents in technology and design found permanent expression as a sculptor resulting in a body of unique works that wedded fluidity and motion with substance and strength within hundreds of pounds of stone. His works have been exhibited in galleries throughout the United States with permanent installations at NYU Langone Medical Center in New York City, and Jackson Memorial and Mt. Sinai Hospitals in Miami. He was the beloved husband of Florence, who passed in 2001, and present dear husband of Carole, loving father to Felicia and Alice, adoring father in law to Robert Porges and Monroe Chaikin, proud grandfather to John Porges, Vicki Porges Eisner, Melissa Chaikin Kahn, and Eric Chaikin, and their respective spouses, Alex, Joe, and Greg, and cherished great-grandfather to Dylan and David Porges, Erin and Jesse Eisner, and Faye and Miles Kahn.

2010-08-09T00:00:00Z,"W, a magazine best known for ethereal photo spreads with dazed-looking models sporting Versace, Chanel, Prada and Ferragamo, is assuming a new look and editorial tone. It is becoming a place that its new editor, Stefano Tonchi, hopes readers will go to not only for high-end fashion but for profiles on cultural figures, travel essays and appraisals of art. The September W contains all of the above, and a healthy dose of pictorial spreads. Some of the elements are provocative: a bare-breasted model donning jewels; blurbs from actresses describing their first on-camera sex scenes (''I will make a sex scene as uncomfortable as I can just to break the ice,'' one says)."

2010-08-09T00:00:00Z,"HBO has announced plans to show ''The Promise: The Making of 'Darkness on the Edge of Town,' '' a documentary that follows the making of Bruce Springsteen's fourth album, Variety reported. Directed by Thom Zimney, who has made several films about Mr. Springsteen and his band, including the Emmy-nominated ''Bruce Springsteen and the E Street Band: Live in New York City,'' the film chronicles Mr. Springsteen's work on ''Darkness'' from 1975, after the release of his pivotal album ''Born to Run,'' until 1978, a time when he was prohibited from recording any music because of a pending lawsuit with Mike Appel, his former manager. The film mixes footage from rehearsals during that time with recent commentary from Mr. Springsteen and the band. (Above, Mr. Springsteen, right, with Southside Johnny.) ''The fact that this footage has been sitting in a vault, and no one has seen it for more than 30 years is just extraordinary,'' Richard L. Plepler, a co-president of HBO, said at a Television Critics Association meeting on Saturday. Mr. Plepler and Michael Lombardo, programming president for HBO, said the documentary would be shown on the network in October, after a premiere on Sept. 14, as the opening film of the Toronto Film Festival."

The United States Golf Association Museum in Far Hills, N.J., is more than a collection of golf memorabilia, though it is an impressive gathering of artifacts, clubs, garments, trophies, works of golf art and hundreds of other meaningful and memorable objects associated with the game. The museum, however, does more than show you important pieces of golf history; it puts them together to tell you the story of golf in America. There are Francis Ouimet's clubs from the 1913 United States Open, a Gene Sarazen 1932 sand wedge, tributes to Babe Zaharias, Mickey Wright, Patty Berg and entire rooms dedicated to Bobby Jones, Arnold Palmer and Ben Hogan. There are film clips and scorecards and a unique viewing gallery where you can watch video footage as seen on seven vintage 1960s television sets - except you never have to adjust the rabbit ears to improve the reception."

The cache contains more than 25,000 design sketches, working drawings, renderings and photographs from the second half of Johnson's architectural career, covering more than 120 projects from 1968 to 1992. While there are collections of his early work at the Museum of Modern Art, the Getty Museum and the Avery Architectural & Fine Arts Library at Columbia University, documentation from this later period, in which he became known for his tall buildings, is much rarer. Included in the archive is material on the AT&T Building in Manhattan (now Sony's American headquarters); the Crystal Cathedral in Garden Grove, Calif.; PPG Place in Pittsburgh; Pennzoil Place in Houston; and smaller-scale structures that Johnson built around his celebrated Glass House of 1949 on his property in New Canaan, Conn., now owned by the National Trust for Historic Preservation."

Established in 1897 as a substitute for the university education that women were largely denied, the club had 2,500 members in its heyday in the 1920s, and activities included Shakespeare, gardening and art appreciation."

2010-08-11T00:00:00Z,"It is not unusual to find coffee cups after police officers have finished an emergency call. But this one was a mystery: Did it belong to an investigator or to a victim? Early in the morning on July 8, the police were called to a building at Lenox Avenue and West 112th Street in Manhattan, where, it was reported, a man had jumped to his death. Investigators eventually came to a different conclusion. They said the victim, a 55-year-old man, had climbed to the roof about 5:30 a.m., tied his shoelaces to a pipe and then apparently tried to use them to lower himself into his girlfriend's apartment window. (She had refused to let him in.) A man on the second floor discovered the body when he heard a thump on the ledge outside his window. On the roof, the question remained: Who left the coffee cup? Earlier photographs in the series are at nytimes.com/lens."

There you can see two ravishing clips of the Argentine tango dancers Natalia Hills and Gabriel Missé at the Vail International Dance Festival last year.

Even so, to watch them in live performance is altogether more sensational; and it's only then that you feel the full excitement of Mr. Missé's matchless footwork. Both last year and this they were the most absorbing luminaries at the festival's International Evenings of Dance, but this year the festival also programmed two remarkable all-tango events at the open-air Gerald R.

2010-08-12T11:45:38Z,"Continuing my slow march through responses to my gay marriage column, I want to take up two somewhat-related critiques of my argument for holding up lifelong heterosexual monogamy as a distinctive legal and cultural ideal: First, that this ideal is too essentialist, and second, that it's too complicated. The too-essentialist critique has been raised by The American Prospect's Adam Serwer, among others, who scoffs at my suggestion that there's anything distinctive about heterosexual relationships as heterosexual relationships: Every intimate relationship, he suggests, is ""'distinct' in its 'challenges and potential fruit,'"" and so there's no reason why heterosexual marriages as a category deserve to be singled out or idealized in any way. The too-complicated critique was raised by Matt Feeney, who writes (well, ""tweets"") that ""if there's an Ockham's Razor/Parsimony standard for 'ideals,'"" then my marriage ideal ""doesn't meet it,"" because ""any marriage ideal strong enough to function qua ideal, as Ross uses the term, would have to be parsimonious enough to allow gay marriage."""
2010-08-12T11:39:22Z,"My wife and I spent a lot of time driving on the Isle of Skye, off the west coast of Scotland, where I recently was reporting a story. That posed a few problems. First, I'd never driven on the left side of the road. (Let's just say it took a few days for me to adjust.) Second, Skye is full of single-lane roads with ""Passing Places"" -- you end up playing a friendly little game with oncoming cars as to who will pull over. (Don't forget to wave as you pass by - it's considered rude not to.) And then there was the livestock. Sheep, it turns out, will move when you honk (though we did hear stories of horned rams doing some damage upon seeing their reflection in car doors); cows are a bit more stubborn. But when you're surrounded by vistas as beautiful as those on Skye, you don't mind the occasional break in your journey."

2010-08-12T11:00:53Z,"On a recent Friday morning, lit white by the California sun, Nigel Dare was sitting in his shop, fielding calls from a movie set. ""Is that a Japanese line?"" he asked the makeup artist on the other end. ""Never heard of it. But you'll have it by Monday."" Dare is the ultimate Hollywood candy man - a warm, personable guy who can procure Fria, an Italian makeup remover, if that's what you need, or Collyre Bleu (1) for the hungover actor with bloodshot eyes. Nigel's Beauty Emporium, along with Naimie's Beauty Center and Frends Beauty Supply, is perhaps the San Fernando Valley's best-kept secret: a treasure trove of rarefied cosmetics brands where Hollywood makeup artists go to keep the likes of Sandra Bullock, Megan Fox and George Clooney powdered and buffed. Here they can scour hundreds of global brands, including ones you don't see everywhere (Embryolisse (2), La Peau (3) ) and the Japanese lines much beloved by the pros (KohGenDo, Kanebo). Here they can ask for and get Kate (5), the ultrathin Kanebo eyeliner that is barely detectable on the eye. Or the French - and much stronger - version of Anthelios, the sunscreen by La Roche-Posay. Or, for that matter, Labello lip balm (4), from Germany. Frends is the granddaddy of the bunch: founded in 1940, it catered to makeup artists who were stuck on a set for 18 hours straight and running on empty. Today all three stores are about turnaround, finding products anywhere they can and even picking them up at a competitor's if they have to - which, for the right client, they will."

2010-08-12T00:00:00Z,"FILENE--Adele Bleichroeder, died peacefully on August 8, in Stamford, CT at the age of 101. Born in Berlin of a family distinguished in banking and medicine, she took courses in Paris and Vienna in fashion and design. Forced to flee to London in 1938, she worked as a swim suit designer for Jantzen. When war started, she was designing handbags for Leopold Kahn and overnight found herself supervising the production of parachutes. Her twin boys were evacuated. Alone she experienced life in a city under heavy bombing and in austere conditions. With peace, she established her own haute couture salon, some of her more prominent clients being drawn from the staff of the German embassy an irony not lost on her. She moved to the U.S. in 1970 to marry Herman Filene, and was a founder member of the Costume Society of America, its treasurer, organizer of international study tours, and the establisher of a scholarship for students of fashion. A central focus became the Women's City Club of New York. She was a life member, director, chair of the Arts & Landmarks and Membership Committees, and an indefatigable contributor to the club's goals. In her private life, she bore with fortitude the loss of relatives under persecution in Germany, and the death in action of a son in the Korean War. For her family she was a formidable presence, yet encouraging, perceptive, and a mine of sound counsel. Adele was self-reliant. Despite more than her share of vicissitudes, she was always positive. She personified duty and determination, resilience, courage, and a stoic grace, the latter so noticeable as friends passed on and her own strength diminished. But she lost none of her acuity and involvement with the world around her, in her last days suggesting refinements for her daughter-in-law's hand sewn skirt, and chuckling mischievously during a discussion on what matters and what does not. She is survived by a son, Thomas Juliusburger and his wife Machiko, of Stamford, CT, three grandchildren, Susanna Allen and her husband Jonathan, of Henley, UK, Stephan Juliusburger of Miami, FL, and Nicholas Juliusburger, of Fairfield, CT, and three great grandchildren, Dr. Kirsty Allen and Mr. James Allen in England, and Sage Juliusburger in Fairfield.

2010-08-12T00:00:00Z,"MILSTEIN--Paul, 88, one of the leading real estate developers of New York, died peacefully in his home surrounded by his wife and children. Born in 1922, he grew up in the Bronx, attended DeWitt Clinton High School and studied architecture at New York University. After military service during World War II, he joined the family business, Circle Flooring Company. Under his leadership, Circle Flooring became the dominant installer of floors, ceilings, and drywall both in New York and nationally. In the 1950s he began a lifelong career of significant real estate development projects centered in his beloved New York City. In the 1970s, he entered the coal, natural gas and oil business, while, at the same time, purchasing United Brands, the parent company of Chiquita Bananas. In the 1980s, he purchased Emigrant Savings Bank. Paul Milstein was as prolific in building important New York institutions as he was in developing real estate projects.

Mr. Rudd was surrounded by, and is survived by his wife Martha Bannerman and their children, Graeme, Kathryn and Eliza. He is also survived by his mother Kathryn Rudd of Hingham, MA and numerous cousins. Mr. Rudd was born in 1940 in Boston, MA and attended the Boston Latin School and Assumption Prep. He graduated from Fairfield University. After a brief career in advertising in New York City, Mr. Rudd worked as a professional actor and director both on and off-Broadway from 1967 through 1986. Notable roles include Henry V in Henry V at the Delacorte Theater, Scooper in the original Broadway cast of Bosoms and Neglect, Romeo in Romeo and Juliet at Circle In The Square, Gentleman Caller in the original Broadway cast of The Glass Menagerie, and Billy Wilson in the premiere of David Rabe's Streamers. His television and film credits include Brian Mallory in Beacon Hill, JFK in Johnny We Hardly Knew Ye, and guest roles in episodes of Moonlighting, Knot's Landing, Hart to Hart, and Murder, She Wrote. In 1986 Mr. Rudd left acting to raise his children. As they grew, he began teaching theater, especially Shakespeare, and poetry in local middle schools and high schools. He continued his teaching career at Sarah Lawrence College (1999-2006) and the New School for Drama (2004-present) as a teaching faculty member and the Associate Director of the MFA Drama program. His passion and enthusiasm as a teacher inspired deep admiration and affection in his many students. Mr. Rudd's keen intellect, irreverent sense of humor, and vivacity were present in all facets of his life. He delighted in music, literature, art, cooking, and the company of his friends. His greatest joy was that of being a father and a husband. A service will be held this Sunday, August 15th at 2pm at Round Hill Community Church in Greenwich, CT."

2010-08-13T00:00:00Z,"Just under 50 games remain on the schedule for each major league team, and the playoff races are coming into focus. Through Wednesday, six teams (the Yankees, Tampa Bay, Chicago, Minnesota, Texas and Boston) in the American League and six teams (Atlanta, Philadelphia, Cincinnati, St. Louis, San Diego and San Francisco) in the National League were within four games of a playoff position. Since the move to three divisions in 1995, there have been only four cases of a team that was behind in the standings by five or more games on or after Aug. 11 but came back to win its division: the 1995 Mariners, the 2006 and 2009 Twins, and the 2007 Phillies. So although it would not be unprecedented for the Rockies, down by five games, and the Dodgers, down by five and a half games, to come back to win the division, it appears unlikely."

Hannelius). When she talks Alex into coming to the aid of her Bumble Bee troop, it looks as if perhaps he really had learned the concept of charity. What the girls don't know is that Alex has a lot to gain from his act of kindness -- like the attention of Matisse Burrows (Kelsey Chow, above right with Mr. Dano and Ms. Hannelius), the school babe who won't give him the time of day. What Alex doesn't know is how much his life is about to change. 8 P.M.

He will be remembered by the many actors and directors who got their first break performing in a Prince Street show. All eleven of his scripts and scores are now leased throughout the world by Music Theatre International. His legacy is a joyous one of shared love and laughter through his words and music."

Hans Landa, a charming, nattily dressed Nazi in this sixth feature from Quentin Tarantino. Brad Pitt, above, plays Lt. Aldo Raine, the leader of a pack of Jewish avengers. ''As usual Mr. Tarantino gives you a lot to chew on, though there's plenty to gag on as well,'' Manohla Dargis wrote in The New York Times. ''Much depends on whether you can just groove on his framing and staging, his swooping crane shots, postmodern flourishes (Samuel L. Jackson in voice-over explaining the combustibility of nitrate prints) and gorgeously saturated colors, one velvety red in particular.'' The film serves as a testament to Mr. Tarantino's ''movie love,'' she said, rather than to his interest in history. The problem, she added, ''is that by making the star attraction of his latest film a most delightful Nazi, one whose smooth talk is as lovingly presented as his murderous violence, Mr. Tarantino has polluted that love.'' 10:30 A.M.

So loved by his family, friends and colleagues, his kindness, compassion, warmth, wit, and brilliant array of talents will be sorely missed. Jonathan was born and raised in Toronto, but educated, worked, and excelled in both Canada and in the United States. He loved all the arts and mastered many, from sculpture, painting and drawing to comedic improvisational theatre, from documentary to narrative film. He graduated from Upper Canada College in 1992 and entered the University of Michigan's School of Art & Design to study sculpture. There, he won the Jean Paul Slusser Gallery Prize and graduated Magna Cum Laude in 1997. In 2002 he earned a Masters of Fine Arts from New York University's Gallatin School of Individualized Study for his work in improvisational theatre and film. He served as musical assistant to Paul Shaffer on the movie Blues Brothers 2000, wrote two novels, and then polished his timing and quirky, lovable wit at Toronto's legendary Second City. In New York, he worked with Gotham City Improv and The Upright Citizens' Brigade, while he also pursued his dream of making improvisational narrative films. He wrote, produced, shot, and edited his films himself, yet he warmly welcomed others' contributions, always seeking to create community through art making. His works, accepted and shown at various film festivals, include: Falling Together; Snowdown; Play the Muse; Once Brothers. His last film, Souled Out Comedy, was shown in 2009 at New York's Friars Club Comedy Film Festival where it won the Audience Choice Award. In 2005, Jonathan married Allene Quincy and moved with her to Santa Monica where he continued his film work. Jonathan is survived in sorrow by his parents, Mark and Gail Appel, his sister Liz Appel, her partner Cobb Mixter, his Uncle David and Aunt Carol Appel, his cousins Jacqueline, Alex and James Appel, his aunts and uncles on the Levchenko side of the family, his former wife Allene and a wide circle of friends. Jonathan will be laid to rest at Toronto's Mount Pleasant Cemetery on August 19 at 1:00pm following a ceremony at the Visitation Centre ( 375 Mount Pleasant Road--East Gate) presided over by the Reverend Carol Luther, Episcopalian, of Marin County, California. The Appel family suggests that those who wish to celebrate Jonathan's life by making contributions may direct them to charities in support of theatre and the arts."

Loving father of Lynne Norma Scheurer and her husband Peter Foster and Andrew Raabin Scheurer and his wife Juliette. Adored Poppa of Sarah Norma Rish, Noah Scheurer Rish, Edwin Charles Scheurer II and Rayna Louise Foster. Cherished brother of Joan Mintz and Donald. Devoted uncle, cousin and friend. Eddie grew up in the Bronx and went to DeWitt Clinton High School. He graduated from Upsala College. In 1955 he joined Frank B. Hall which became Aon. In 1956 he joined the Army and was stationed at the Pentagon in the Crypto Division. He married Edie Raabin on November 10th 1957 after 14 dates. On September 11 his office was on the 105th floor of Tower Two. He voted in the mayoral primary in the morning and arrived at the building two minutes after it was attacked. He saw the horrific site from the street. He never recovered from this and always felt guilty that his life was spared while thousands of young people were killed. It haunted him the rest of his life. He retired as Vice Chairman from Aon in 2008. Eddie embraced life. He was a loving and devoted family man in every way. His charm and charisma were captivating. His wonderful smile lit up a room and his presence was strongly felt anywhere he went. He loved the golf games and gin games with his buddies and was always there to lend a hand to anyone in need. His amazing disposition was enviable. He rarely saw the glass half filled-he saw it entirely full. Ed, representing the insurance industry, accompanied Mayor Lindsay to Japan. He was a former chairman of the insurance division of the UJA Federation. He was a board member and past chairman of the Samuel Waxman Cancer Research Foundation and worked tirelessly for this organization. Our gratitude to Dr. Stuart Orsher and his team who did all that could possibly be done in an impossible situation. Our very special thanks, appreciation and love to Dr. Richard Bader who for twenty years accompanied us from city to city, hospital to hospital and doctor to doctor. He guided and advised us in our multitude of medical decisions. We will forever be grateful to him. Contributions in Eddie's memory to the Samuel Waxman Cancer Research Foundation 1150 Fifth Avenue, New York, NY 10128 would be greatly appreciated or a special charity of your choice. The family will receive at Campbell's Funeral Chapel, 1076 Madison Ave on Monday August 16th from 4-8pm. The funeral will be Tuesday, August 17th 2010 at 11:30am."

As of Sunday, 890 locations were designated by the World Heritage Committee as ''having outstanding universal value.'' On Monday, when the committee completed its consideration of new nominees, a new set of 21 places joined that list. The additions range from remote natural locations, like the central highlands of Sri Lanka, to well-trodden urban places, like Amsterdam's 17th-century canal belt. The committee also added four locations to their list of sites in danger, including the Everglades National Park in Florida. They removed the Galapagos Islands from that list as well, having found that significant progress had been made in combating ''threats posed by invasive species, unbridled tourism and over-fishing.'' (The islands remain on the larger site list.)"

2010-08-15T00:00:00Z,"To the Sports Editor: Re ''Half the Holes, No Less the Charm,'' Aug. 9: I have seen the demise of the nine-hole golf course. The Bergen County golf facility at Rockleigh in New Jersey has an 18- and 9-hole course, which is a Robert Trent Jones design. Sad to say that the little nine-hole gem has seen better days. The 18-hole course attracts the county dollars for upkeep. On the nine-hole course, a drainage problem has shaved a par 4 down to a par 3 while a par 5 has been eliminated -- replaced with a makeshift par 3. Snagging a weekend morning tee time on the Rockleigh 18-hole course is tantamount to winning the lottery, but, conditions being what they are, one can pretty much get out on the nine-hole course at any time."

2010-08-15T00:00:00Z,"The Basel Convention on the Control of Transboundary Movements of Hazardous Wastes and Their Disposal, agreed to in 1989 and now adopted by a majority of nations, was meant to stop the dumping of toxic waste in poor countries. But what if the waste arrives as a gift? In Agbogbloshie, a slum in Accra, the capital of Ghana, adults and children tear away at computers from abroad to get at the precious metals inside. The computers and other equipment in this digital cemetery come mainly from Europe and the United States, sometimes as secondhand donations meant to reduce the ''digital divide'' -- the disparity in computer access between poor nations and rich. As Pieter Hugo shows in these haunting photographs, the equipment often becomes part of a particularly toxic recycling business. In 2008, Greenpeace sampled the burned soil at Agbogbloshie and found high levels of lead, cadmium, antimony, PCBs and chlorinated dioxins. At the dump, the machines are dismantled and often burned to extract metals for resale. Copper is perhaps the most desirable, then brass, then aluminum, then zinc. Prices in Agbogbloshie are about four times below the international market price, but for the scavengers of the dump, the income is incentive enough. Many of the workers there are boys, sent by their families in the impoverished north of the country to work at the dump and send back what money they can.

2010-08-15T00:00:00Z,"Visitors in Barcelona rarely cross the city's broad Avinguda Diagonal, sticking close to the harborside Gothic quarter. But Barcelona natives love -- and many live in -- the quirky residential neighborhood of Gràcia, which fills the urban grid on Diagonal's north side, between Passeig de Gràcia and Passeig de Sant Joan. Once a separate town outside the city's (long-gone) medieval walls, Gràcia was eventually absorbed into the fabric of Barcelona. But it's never lost that village feeling and remains a jumble of narrow streets and tree-shaded plazas dotted with Art Nouveau architecture. Often the first address of 20-something natives and newly arrived expatriates, Gràcia today is a lot more vibrant -- and international -- than it used to be.

The fashion commentariat thinks of him as the goth counterpoint to the kooky, hat-loving Tavi, but Guislain is no blogger. He was discovered by the raspy-voiced cult fashion journalist Diane Pernet and became something of a flaxen-haired YouTube curiosity, and he was recently the subject of a spread in Italian Vogue. He's still in school, studying Rimbaud, Barthes, Proust - serious reading for a serious boy. ''I'm not really into parties, to be honest,'' Guislain says. He first fell in love with fashion at age 13, when he came across a pair of Dior Homme suspenders designed by his idol, Hedi Slimane. Now 17, he's already toying with retirement from the show-hopping scene: ''I need to escape European life. I am a little bored with this now, as there are too many rude people,'' he says.

Even laboratory rats and mice respond emotionally to exercise; although their precise ''moods'' are hard to parse, their behavior indicates that exercise makes them more relaxed and confident.

2010-08-15T00:00:00Z,"Last Sunday's Metropolitan article by Frank Bruni, ''License to Scream,'' about his travails in getting a driver's license, elicited dozens of comments from readers. Excerpts follow: When I was 16 back in 1963 and living in Chicago, it was common to give a tip (a k a a bribe) to the testing agent. Ten dollars was a lot of money in those days, and it just about guaranteed a pass. My father would not have any part of that. There were, however, plenty of people willing to ''take care'' of the agent."

2010-08-15T00:00:00Z,"THE newly revamped W now comes with a slanted logo, as if to say, ''Let's go!'' The energized logo might be the most promising thing about the magazine, which has a new editor, Stefano Tonchi, formerly the editor of T: The New York Times Magazine, as well as a new creative director, Jody Quon. I've been a reader of W since its broadsheet days, when it was driven by the curiosity and often deliciously snippy tongue of its founder, John Fairchild. In 2000, I wrote a profile of its then creative director, Dennis Freedman, and the way he cultivated photographers and helped bring to life sometimes-difficult ideas in fashion and art. In its long history W, at its best, was a scrappy journalistic player with a knowing sense of the people it covered. Though Mr. Tonchi will need to produce several more issues before his W can be assessed fairly, it is clear from the September issue that he wants to restore its journalistic flavor. The cover tagline promises ''Who, What, Where, When, and Why in the World of Style,'' and the inside pages are spelled out accordingly. The front-of-the-book has the usual newsy blend of features on fashion, beauty and travel, with some of the photography and layouts lacking a sharpness that would help separate them from the ads. There is a lengthy profile of Riccardo Tisci of Givenchy that describes his friendships with Marina Abramovic and Courtney Love. Party coverage is scant, though that will probably change in time. I thought the fashion spreads were generally strong - in particular, a feature shot in Brooklyn by Mert and Marcus, with right-on styling by Alex White, and Tim Walker's sweet images of eccentric young Londoners. (I adored a young man named Scottee who favors adult baby clothes.)"

2010-08-15T00:00:00Z,"THE STONE I suspect that the day Britney Spears shaved her own hair off represented a kind of Sartrean or Socratic argument, rather than, say, a nervous breakdown. She was, in effect, shrewdly de-mythifying beauty. The hair lies on the floor, ''inexplicably faded'' and the conventional notion of femininity does too. I see Marilyn Monroe and Brigitte Bardot in a similar light: both -- one by dying, the other by remaining alive -- deviated from and deflated their iconic status. The beautiful is not some far-flung abstraction. Beauty is a thing, whereas I am no-thing. And that explains why I can never be truly beautiful, even if it doesn't stop me wanting to be. Perhaps this explains why Camus, Sartre's more dashing sparring partner, jotted down in his notebooks, ''Beauty is unbearable and drives us to despair.'' -- Andy Martin, excerpt from"

Pretty much every follower of fashion has a case of Phoebe fever right now, but personally I am hot for the matching tunic and pants looks like the ones she showed for Celine Resort. At a moment when sundresses are all too ubiquitous, this combo provides a fresh way to beat the oppressive summer heat. I like a monochrome version - a neutral color worn top to bottom - but to avoid looking like you're wearing scrubs (or Lindsay Lohan's prison garb) add some great accessories worthy of Anjelica Huston in the 1970s. Gold and graphic jewelry, like symmetrical cuffs from Repossi, and a clean, envelope clutch in an exotic skin keep the look polished and urban. This long silhouette looks great - and even more attenuated - with heels, but if it's easy breezy you're after, these simple leather flat sandals from K. Jacques do the trick."

BEHIND THE NEWS The Fed, led by Ben S. Bernanke, has revised its earlier, more optimistic outlook. Britain and China cut their forecasts for growth, and the Dow Jones industrial average slid about 3 percent for the week as nervous investors looked for safe bets. One bright spot was austerity-minded Germany, posting its best quarterly performance since reunification."

Survivors include his wife Ilse; daughter Elizabeth Henrici; stepchildren Chase and Peter Livingston; six grandchildren; and four siblings: Lois Davis, Jean Rogers, Richard MacKinnon, and William MacKinnon. A public memorial service will be held in the chapel of Northfield Mount Hermon School, Mount Hermon, MA, on Saturday, September 11, at 2:00pm following a 1:00pm gathering for out-of-town guests at the school's Mary E. MacKinnon Cottage. After the chapel service there will be a reception at the headmaster's residence. Bob MacKinnon was born in Schenectady, NY on November 22, 1935 to Harold Alexander MacKinnon and the former Mary Ethel Costello. He attended Schenectady public schools, and for high school went to Northfield Mount Hermon (1953), on whose Board of Trustees he later served with great distinction. Bob was also an alumnus of Yale University (B.A., 1957) and Harvard Law School (L.L.D., 1960). Throughout his student days he was active in Boy Scouts, athletics, and singing. Following Harvard, Bob entered the U.S. Army Reserve, and in New York commenced a life-long career with the law firm of Shearman & Sterling, from which he retired as a senior partner in 2001 and counselor in 2007. As an attorney he was a respected leader and mentor, active in his firm's governance while founding and leading its practice areas in bankruptcy, reorganization, and private finance. Bob was a truly global practitioner, having worked in Shearman & Sterling offices in five countries. He was an advisor to and director of multiple American and international corporations. Amidst all of these responsibilities, Bob MacKinnon took great satisfaction in the building and naming of the Mary E. MacKinnon Cottage, a student residence at Northfield Mount Hermon, as a memorial to his late mother."

In the past few weeks alone, I saw a father by the sandbox at our local playground tapping away at his BlackBerry as his son repeatedly grabbed toy trucks from my 4-year-old. Another father essentially ignored his daughter's repeated questions, his left hand pushing her on the swing while his right deftly manipulated a smartphone.

2010-08-15T00:00:00Z,"APPEL--Jonathan Bruce, December 18, 1974--July 29, 2010, passed away-- too young-- in Santa Monica, California. So loved by his family, friends and colleagues, his kindness, compassion, warmth, wit, and brilliant array of talents will be sorely missed. Jonathan was born and raised in Toronto, but educated, worked, and excelled in both Canada and in the United States. He loved all the arts and mastered many, from sculpture, painting and drawing to comedic improvisational theatre, from documentary to narrative film. He graduated from Upper Canada College in 1992 and entered the University of Michigan's School of Art & Design to study sculpture. There, he won the Jean Paul Slusser Gallery Prize and graduated Magna Cum Laude in 1997. In 2002 he earned a Masters of Fine Arts from New York University's Gallatin School of Individualized Study for his work in improvisational theatre and film. He served as musical assistant to Paul Shaffer on the movie Blues Brothers 2000, wrote two novels, and then polished his timing and quirky, lovable wit at Toronto's legendary Second City. In New York, he worked with Gotham City Improv and The Upright Citizens' Brigade, while he also pursued his dream of making improvisational narrative films. He wrote, produced, shot, and edited his films himself, yet he warmly welcomed others' contributions, always seeking to create community through art making. His works, accepted and shown at various film festivals, include: Falling Together; Snowdown; Play the Muse; Once Brothers. His last film, Souled Out Comedy, was shown in 2009 at New York's Friars Club Comedy Film Festival where it won the Audience Choice Award. In 2005, Jonathan married Allene Quincy and moved with her to Santa Monica where he continued his film work. Jonathan is survived in sorrow by his parents, Mark and Gail Appel, his sister Liz Appel, her partner Cobb Mixter, his Uncle David and Aunt Carol Appel, his cousins Jacqueline, Alex and James Appel, his aunts and uncles on the Levchenko side of the family, his former wife Allene and a wide circle of friends. Jonathan will be laid to rest at Toronto's Mount Pleasant Cemetery on August 19 at 1:00pm following a ceremony at the Visitation Centre ( 375 Mount Pleasant Road--East Gate) presided over by the Reverend Carol Luther, Episcopalian, of Marin County, California. The Appel family suggests that those who wish to celebrate Jonathan's life by making contributions may direct them to charities in support of theatre and the arts."

Neilson was notorious for wearing McQueen’s clothes and she did so with a fierceness befitting her status as his muse. A sheer black jumpsuit from 2006, a mere figment of McQueen’s imagination that left nothing to anyone else’s, generated reams of chatter and flaunted the designer’s devilish streak.

Ed was born in Beatrice, NE in 1935 and decided at an early age that he wanted to be a lawyer not a farmer. He left the farm at 16 and, after obtaining his BA from Principia College, graduated cum laude from The Harvard Law School in 1958. He held a number of positions in corporate General Counsel offices, but his final employment with various entities owned by the Milstein Family lasted 35 years and provided him with great professional and personal satisfaction. When he died, he was Sr. Vice President-General Counsel for Ogden CAP Properties, LLC. Ed was a man who will be remembered for a quiet reserve that hid a broad sense of humor and irreverence. Many described him as the consummate gentleman. He will be greatly missed by family, friends and many others he worked with over the years. Visitation and funeral services will be at Frank E. Campbell Funeral Chapel, 1076 Madison Avenue at 81st Street. Visitation hours are 3-5 and 7-9 on Tuesday, August 17, with the funeral service at 11:30 the following day.

2010-08-16T00:00:00Z,"KABUL, Afghanistan -- Gen. David H. Petraeus, the commander of American and NATO forces, began a campaign on Sunday to convince an increasingly skeptical public that the American-led coalition can still succeed here despite months of setbacks, saying he had not come to Afghanistan to preside over a ''graceful exit.'' In an hourlong interview with The New York Times, the general argued against any precipitous withdrawal of forces in July 2011, the date set by President Obama to begin at least a gradual reduction of the 100,000 troops on the ground. General Petraeus said that it was only in the last few weeks that the war plan had been fine-tuned and given the resources that it required. ''For the first time,'' he said, ''we will have what we have been working to put in place for the last year and a half.''"

Adored Poppa of Sarah Norma Rish, Noah Scheurer Rish, Edwin Charles Scheurer II and Rayna Louise Foster. Cherished brother of Joan Mintz and Donald. Devoted uncle, cousin and friend. Eddie grew up in the Bronx and went to DeWitt Clinton High School. He graduated from Upsala College. In 1955 he joined Frank B. Hall which became Aon. In 1956 he joined the Army and was stationed at the Pentagon in the Crypto Division. He married Edie Raabin on November 10th 1957 after 14 dates. On September 11 his office was on the 105th floor of Tower Two. He voted in the mayoral primary in the morning and arrived at the building two minutes after it was attacked. He saw the horrific sight from the street. He never recovered from this and always felt guilty that his life was spared while thousands of young people were killed. It haunted him the rest of his life. He retired as Vice Chairman from Aon in 2008. Eddie embraced life. He was a loving and devoted family man in every way. His charm and charisma were captivating. His wonderful smile lit up a room and his presence was strongly felt anywhere he went. He loved the golf games and gin games with his buddies and was always there to lend a hand to anyone in need. His amazing disposition was enviable. He rarely saw the glass half filled-he saw it entirely full. Ed, representing the insurance industry, accompanied Mayor Lindsay to Japan. He was a former chairman of the insurance division of the UJA Federation. He was a board member and past chairman of the Samuel Waxman Cancer Research Foundation and worked tirelessly for this organization.

The exhibition, called ""Picasso in The Metropolitan Museum of Art,"" drew 703,256 visitors during its 17-week run from April 19 through Aug. 15, making it the museum's best-attended show since 2001. The Met said that the exhibition, which featured the museum's complete Picasso holdings of some 300 examples of the artist's painting, drawing, sculpture and ceramics, attracted as many as 10,000 visitors on some busy Fridays, Saturdays and Sundays. Still, it wasn't enough to top the Met's sixth-most-attended exhibition, ""The Horses of San Marco,"" which drew 742,221 visitors over seven months in 1980. Maybe next time, Picasso."

2010-08-17T00:00:00Z,"SAKS--Denise, our Tanty, was one of a kind. She died on August 5, 2010, at the age of 95 while hiking in Switzerland, where she had been gathering dear friends from around the world every summer for 30 years; she never became complacent about life nor lost her profound openness to meeting new people. Denise was born in London in 1914 where her Belgian family had sought shelter during WWI. They returned to Belgium after that war where she began her life-long love of learning. She had received her law degree when WWII broke out. Her family fled Belgium on May 10 1940, during the bombing of Brussels. She often told stories of their journey, focusing on the joy they found with family and friends on their journey through France, Portugal, Mozambique, and South Africa, finally arriving in New York in December 1940. She found her home in New York, where she was part of an amazing group of Jewish emigres. She received her Master's in Science and Social Work from Columbia University in 1945 and opened a successful group practice, focusing on families, in Westchester. She then went on to work with students at Barnard College. Following her retirement from Barnard she volunteered for many years at the United Nations helping families find the right resources for their children. The ""younger generation,"" as she called her great, and great great, nieces and nephews, delighted in spending time with her getting down on the floor with them until the age of 90 showing her excellent rooster imitation and special ability to wiggle her ears. She was deeply interested in and supportive of all of our efforts to contribute to the world. She always had something to offer, a friend who worked in the field, an interesting article she had just read, and her keen observations. She fostered in all of us a love of art, music, theatre, and travel. We miss our beloved Tanty, who lives on in all of us: Marianne Holstrom and Fred Chapnick, Claude and Bette Saks, Pierre LeBlache, Jacqueline Hart and Pierre Vilain, Catherine Hart and Christopher Wottowa, Eric and Suzanne Saks, Marc and Anne Saks, Claire and Carl Iverson, Dominique, Megan, Isabel, Maxwell, Annick, Olivier, Miles, and Silas."

Adored Poppa of Sarah Norma Rish, Noah Scheurer Rish, Edwin Charles Scheurer II and Rayna Louise Foster. Cherished brother of Joan Mintz and Donald. Devoted uncle, cousin and friend. Eddie grew up in the Bronx and went to DeWitt Clinton High School. He graduated from Upsala College. In 1955 he joined Frank B. Hall which became Aon. In 1956 he joined the Army and was stationed at the Pentagon in the Crypto Division. He married Edie Raabin on November 10th 1957 after 14 dates. On September 11 his office was on the 105th floor of Tower Two. He voted in the mayoral primary in the morning and arrived at the building two minutes after it was attacked. He saw the horrific sight from the street. He never recovered from this and always felt guilty that his life was spared while thousands of young people were killed. It haunted him the rest of his life. He retired as Vice Chairman from Aon in 2008. Eddie embraced life. He was a loving and devoted family man in every way. His charm and charisma were captivating. His wonderful smile lit up a room and his presence was strongly felt anywhere he went. He loved the golf games and gin games with his buddies and was always there to lend a hand to anyone in need. His amazing disposition was enviable. He rarely saw the glass half filled-he saw it entirely full. Ed, representing the insurance industry, accompanied Mayor Lindsay to Japan. He was a former chairman of the insurance division of the UJA Federation. He was a board member and past chairman of the Samuel Waxman Cancer Research Foundation and worked tirelessly for this organization. Our gratitude to Dr. Stuart Orsher and his team who did all that could possibly be done in an impossible situation. Our very special thanks, appreciation and love to Dr. Richard Bader who for twenty years accompanied us from city to city, hospital to hospital and doctor to doctor. He guided and advised us in our multitude of medical decisions. We will forever be grateful to him. Contributions in Eddie's memory to the Samuel Waxman Cancer Research Foundation 1150 Fifth Avenue, New York, NY 10128 would be greatly appreciated -- or a special charity of your choice. The family will receive at Campbell's Funeral Chapel, 1076 Madison Ave on Monday August 16th from 4-8pm. The funeral will be Tuesday, August 17th 2010 at 11:30am."

2010-08-17T00:00:00Z,"PETZ--Edwin V.,died August 13, 2010 at home in the arms of his wife, Louise, as he wished. He also leaves behind his daughter Katherine, his son Christopher and their spouses, Jeff Becker and Leah Jones. Ed was born in Beatrice, NE in 1935 and decided at an early age that he wanted to be a lawyer not a farmer. He left the farm at 16 and, after obtaining his BA from Principia College, graduated cum laude from The Harvard Law School in 1958. He held a number of positions in corporate General Counsel offices, but his final employment with various entities owned by the Milstein Family lasted 35 years and provided him with great professional and personal satisfaction. When he died, he was Sr. Vice President-General Counsel for Ogden CAP Properties, LLC. Ed was a man who will be remembered for a quiet reserve that hid a broad sense of humor and irreverence. Many described him as the consummate gentleman. He will be greatly missed by family, friends and many others he worked with over the years. Visitation and funeral services will be at Frank E. Campbell Funeral Chapel, 1076 Madison Avenue at 81st Street. Visitation hours are 3-5 and 7-9 on Tuesday, August 17, with the funeral service at 11:30 the following day. A reception will be held at the family apartment on Wednesday August 18, 5-8. In lieu of flowers, please consider a donation to New York Presbyterian-Columbia University Medical Center/ Herbert Irving Comprehensive Cancer Center."

His designs range from a studded black leather version to a white chiffon confection that does double duty as a Wildean boutonniere. (Female friends have been known to borrow it as a hair ornament.) The attention he lavishes on them - each one is handmade from couture-grade fabrics and individually numbered, with no visible stitches - rivals that which Alber Elbaz of Lanvin, Wu's design hero and himself a bow tie man, devotes to his frocks.

2010-08-18T09:00:05Z,"September is almost here, with its cooler temperatures (at least we in New York hope they're cooler) and, even better, the arrival of a new John Derian collection for Target. The East Village master of decoupage plates, trays, lamps and other decorative items has followed his 2008 effort for the design-centric retailer with a bigger, more varied collection that includes stationery, home décor, housewares and storage - all at I'll-take-10-of-those prices. Signature designs run through the collection: for example, a silhouette that adorns the cover of a composition book ($2.50) also appears on a ceramic mug ($4.99). Storage bins covered in geranium-leaf or moth prints are too pretty to hide in a closet, and there are plastic trays for every possible use. My favorites among the latter are the Tapered Tray ($19.99, shown here in pale geranium), which is large enough to carry drinks outside, or to stack books or magazines. A smaller tray ($12.99) is perfect for organizing jars of cotton swabs and makeup brushes in the bathroom or for putting your keys on near the front door. Its image of a pink room (called House-Mouse in the collection), taken from a late-19th-century German print, is one of Derian's favorites. ""It's so conceptual,"" he said, ""as if you're putting your things down in a room."" And the oval tray ($12.99), with its Home Sweet Home motto (based on a print that Derian found when he bought an old frame), would look great hanging on a wall, with its old-fashioned, almost camp sensibility. Derian particularly likes the way that these pieces work in modern as well as more traditional rooms. ""They all cross over, which is cool,"" he added. The collection will be available beginning Sept. 5, but as always with Target's designer collaborations, supplies are limited."

He left the farm at 16 and, after obtaining his BA from Principia College, graduated cum laude from The Harvard Law School in 1958.

When he died, he was Sr. Vice President-General Counsel for Ogden CAP Properties, LLC. Ed was a man who will be remembered for a quiet reserve that hid a broad sense of humor and irreverence.

(13, 49) SOUTH PACIFIC Kelli O'Hara and Paulo Szot, above, play Nellie Forbush, a Navy nurse, and Émile de Becque, a French plantation owner, whose romance falters when she learns he had children with a Polynesian woman, in this Lincoln Center Theater revival of the Rodgers and Hammerstein classic. The production (which closes on Sunday), directed by Bartlett Sher and presented here by ''Live From Lincoln Center,'' won seven Tony Awards. Reviewing the musical in The New York Times after it opened in 2008, Ben Brantley described Ms. O'Hara and Mr. Szot as the revelatory stars of a pitch-perfect cast. ''Above all, though, what impresses about this 'South Pacific' is how deeply, fallibly and poignantly human every character seems,'' he added. ''Nearly 60 years ago Brooks Atkinson, writing in The New York Times, described the show as 'a tenderly beautiful idyll of genuine people inexplicably tossed together in a strange corner of the world.' I think a lot of us had forgotten that's what 'South Pacific' is really about. In making the past feel unconditionally present, this production restores a glorious gallery of genuine people who were only waiting to be resurrected.'' 8 P.M.

Blondes, as it turns out, were most often cast as housewives until the 1930s, when flaxen-haired women became typecast as sultry and dangerous. A book of the same name will be released concurrently and include essays by film and cultural historians like Michelle Perrot, Dominique Païni and Stéphane Guéguan, along with an interview with Deneuve herself. And to get to the root (pun intended) of the issue, ''Brune/Blonde'' looks beyond cinema to the significance of women's hair color in art (Alphonse Mucha, Francesca Woodman) and mythology. Somehow we already knew Rapunzel couldn't have pulled off a Louise Brooks."

For two years, FreshDirect stopped soliciting new customers to work on better serving its existing patrons. That strategy seems to have paid off: A loyal core of repeat customers -- about 45,000 to 50,000 in all -- now generates two-thirds of the company's revenue. Richard S. Braddock, chief executive, reports that the company had its first profitable year in 2009 on revenue of $250 million and he expects the company's 2010 revenues will rise to $300 million."

During the last big expansion, between 2003 and 2008, I found myself in the position of hiring willy-nilly, throwing warm bodies at production bottlenecks. In the rush to get work out the door, we never set up a training program and we didn't do a good job of increasing productivity with technology. This was a disastrous mistake. More than anything else, an inflated payroll drained cash from the company and kept us from making a profit. As we ramp up again, I'm doing it differently. It's become apparent to me over the years that the key to a highly productive work force is training and specialization. On the shop floor, that means that the guys are doing a narrower range of things. We don't make all kinds of furniture any more -- now it's conference tables and more conference tables, with a credenza or two thrown in."

Yet, success in this field is so hard to reliably predict that research has been limited, and even venture capitalists tread lightly.

2010-08-20T00:00:00Z,"The National Baseball Hall of Fame's election system is heading for a meltdown.

In 1938, more than 50 eventual Hall of Famers received votes, but just one, Pete Alexander, received the 75 percent of votes necessary for induction. In 1945 and 1946, after a break in voting because of World War II, the top 28 vote-getters were all eventually inducted, but the vote was divided among so many qualified players that not one reached the 75 percent threshold needed for induction in either year. To break this logjam, the Hall of Fame convened an old-timers committee, which selected 30 individuals, and cleared the ballot enough so that in 1947 the writers managed to induct four players."

The scene shows children from the Arnold family, a household that Ms. Lange photographed extensively, in Washington State. The book's subject, Lily Casey Smith, was not ''the oldest of three raggedly beautiful kids'' shown in the picture. This correction was delayed because the error was not pointed out until Thursday, in an e-mail from a reader."

(CNN) IN AMERICA: NEW ORLEANS RISING Five years after Hurricane Katrina ravaged New Orleans, Soledad O'Brien reports on the rebuilding of Pontchartrain Park, a largely black middle-class neighborhood born out of segregation, which had one of the lowest rates of returning homeowners after the storm. This special follows the actor Wendell Pierce -- a star of HBO's ''Treme,'' who evacuated his elderly parents (above with Mr. Pierce at left) from their Pontchartrain home before Katrina -- as he battles red tape, financing and reluctant residents to lead a charge to return his childhood community to its former glory, despite no experience as a developer. Ms. O'Brien also visits two families: Hurby Oubre, who is committed to staying in the neighborhood, and his wife, Lisa, who, seeing no possibility of returning, has moved to Baton Rouge with her son; and Meldon and Audrey Woods, who have taken out a loan they fear they will never be able to repay in order to rebuild their home. Lisa P. Jackson, the administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency, who grew up in Pontchartrain Park, and the former New Orleans mayor Ray Nagin weigh in.

2010-08-22T00:00:00Z,"How do we maintain Social Security in the fairest way? Consider progressive indexing, which would preserve benefits for the bottom third of wage earners who rely on the program for almost all of their retirement income, but recalculate the benefits of higher-paid workers who have other sources of retirement income -- including 401(k)s and IRAs -- that are tax-subsidized by the federal government. To calculate initial benefits at retirement, Social Security currently takes workers' average career earnings and increases them by the rate at which average wages rose during their careers, a mechanism called wage indexing. Once workers start receiving benefits, they are increased annually by the amount that consumer prices rose in the prior year, called price indexing."

As such, her new collections for Joseph Altuzarra and Alexander Wang -- which were introduced on the fall runways and will become part of Repossi's permanent offerings -- are hard to miss: elongated silver and pink gold-banded rings for Altuzarra that take their cue from ancient nomadic tribes; yellow gold Art Deco-inspired collars, rings and cuffs for Wang, burned (or ''destroyed,'' as she put it) at the ends for a dégradé effect. Precious these are not. ''I like breaking the expectations of high-end jewelry,'' she said. Gaia Repossi for Altuzarra ring, about $1,085 at Colette.fr and by e-mail at boutique@repossi.com."

2010-08-22T00:00:00Z,"The Federal Aviation Administration has announced that it was downgrading its rating of Mexico's oversight of civil aviation from Category 1 to Category 2 because Mexico had failed to meet the international safety standards of the United Nations agency for civil aviation. Because the decision, which came late last month, hampers partnerships between American and Mexican airlines and it bars Mexican carriers from adding any new routes to the United States, it effectively reduces the options for air travel between the two countries.The downgrade came shortly before Mexicana Airlines filed for bankruptcy, suspending ticket sales and several flights. Not only will other Mexican carriers be unable to make up for the loss of Mexicana's service in the United States, the move also halts several code-share agreements, which allow domestic airlines to sell tickets for routes that Mexican carriers operate. (The reverse can still occur.) The affected code-share arrangements include one between Delta and AeroMexico and one between American and Mexicana, although the latter has been further complicated by Mexicana's bankruptcy."
2010-08-22T00:00:00Z,"Venus Williams turned 30 this year and remains one of the top tennis players in the world. A winner of 19 Grand Slam titles, she is ranked No. 5 in singles, and No. 2 in doubles with her sister Serena. On Thursday, she will conduct the Legends Clinic II, a live, interactive online clinic presented by Ralph Lauren from the courts on Randalls Island in New York. Tennis fans can submit questions in advance at RalphLauren.com. Q.Where did you get the idea for a virtual clinic days before the start of the United States Open?A.Boris Becker did it at Wimbledon, and I thought it was very interesting. I've never done anything like this before, but I'm excited because after 25 years of tennis, I have a lot to teach. With the Internet and all of the technology we have, a virtual clinic is probably the wave of the future.Q.This is your 12th trip to the Open, which you won in 2000 and 2001. How do you assess your chances this year?A.I like my chances because I grew up on hardcourts, so I feel most comfortable in New York at the U.S. Open. This is where I had my first real breakout. I love to play before New York fans because they love to root for the underdog, but they also love rooting for champions.Q.How long will you keep playing?A.There really is no limit to that. I don't have any plans on stopping right now because I'm still competing for major championships. Now if I wasn't playing that well, it would be a different story.Q.As you have matured as a person and a player, do you see the game any differently?A.I'm more appreciative nowadays of everything the game has given me, and with each passing day, I'm more and more grateful that I'm still playing the game.Q.How do you think you would you have fared against Martina Navratilova and Chris Evert?A.I don't really know because things are different now than they were back then. Technology is different and training is different. Also, all three of us had such different styles. The only real way to know is that they would have had to play in my era or I would have had to play in theirs. If that had happened, it would have made for some epic tennis.Q.Whom did you idolize as a youngster?A.I really liked Monica Seles and Boris Becker. I grew up trying to serve like Becker and hit hard like Monica.Q.You have a clothing line, Eleven. Is this something you might consider full time when your playing days are over?A.Oh, yes, I went to school to study fashion design. I've always wanted a career in design, so what I'm doing now is all a part of the grand plan for when my tennis career is over. I plan on designing not just sports clothing, but regular daywear and other kinds of styles.Q.Tell us something that no one knows about you.A.I am an ubergeek. People think I'm this famous jock with such an exciting life, but when I'm not playing tennis, I'm reading or studying something that I'm curious about, and doing it quietly."

I am still in shock from June, when a parent returned his daughter's 10th-grade English text. It looked just like its name: ''Things Fall Apart.'' Ripped and torn, its cover was splattered with tomato sauce, as if it had been shot in the heart. My horrified expression did not register with the student's father. ''Do we owe you anything?'' he asked. Flummoxed, I just smiled and issued his daughter full credit for returning her books."

2010-08-22T00:00:00Z,"Everyone knows swimming is excellent exercise, but it is also terrific therapy. Nothing frees my mind as dependably as the rhythm of my arms and legs propelling me from one end of the pool to the other. Also, as I have discovered in the 18 months since the death of the man I loved, in the pool, no one can tell the water running down your face is tears. Since I moved to Upper Manhattan in 2007, I have swum several mornings each week at Riverbank State Park, which runs 69 feet above the Hudson River between 137th and 145th Streets, atop a wastewater treatment plant (no, it does not smell). Riverbank is not luxurious - the locker room and shower area are almost spartan - but its price tag, $3 a swim or $30 for a monthly lap pass, is a pittance for a slice of serenity."

2010-08-22T00:00:00Z,"In 1913, the provocateur Marcel Duchamp created a ruckus at the New York Armory Show with his ''Nude Descending a Staircase (No. 2).'' The painting didn't go down well; apparently nudes don't use staircases, they're busy lolling on divans or dancing with seven veils. Looking at ''Nude'' today (in the Philadelphia Museum of Art), the Samurai Shopper sees nothing R-rated, just a fractured maze of lines and planes. What's naked is Duchamp's ambition to shock the stuffed shirts. But critics back then had a point: nudes should avoid staircases. Time's depredations cause body parts to crumple, wobble or sag -- a very off-putting aesthetic. Particularly afflicted by gravity's curse is the neck. Farther south, the décolletage, that creamy expanse of skin that has inspired brooding fugues and tortured quatrains, suffers equally from age and dereliction. Neglect neck or dec and Father Time will one day call your bluff and morph you into a maze of fractured lines and planes."

2010-08-22T00:00:00Z,"The idea that fashion is one long promenade around the contours of the body, alighting on various erogenous zones, has taken a beating in this new millennium. The focus has been so evidently on legs -- in brief skirts, tight pants, shorts and leggings -- that the age-old notion of an alternating sexual focus seems to have been abandoned. Not one season from 2000 onward (and not many before that) traced the curves of hips, waist or bust, the landscape of the hourglass figure. Even the red-carpet parades of strapless gowns have seemed modest rather than thrusting."
2010-08-22T00:00:00Z,"Q.My husband and I have a tradition of taking each of our grandchildren on a special trip. The next one up has her heart set on Paris. We have visited Paris several times, and it just doesn't seem like a child's city. What can you suggest that would be fun for a 10-year-old? Though Paris is often touted as a destination for adults, children can fare just as well there. One place to start: the city's beautifully manicured gardens, which offer wonderful entertainment for youngsters. In the Jardin des Tuileries (Metro to Tuileries or Concorde), on the Right Bank of the Seine, you'll find pony rides, ice cream stands and trampolines. The Jardin du Luxembourg (Metro to Odeon), on the Left Bank, has a playground, a pond where kids can sail toy boats and absorbing puppet shows - though the Champ de Mars, near the Eiffel Tower, reputedly offers the best shows in town."

She was groomed from an early age by her grandmother, Estée, and her parents, Ronald and Jo Carole, and it was a given that Aerin would rise through the ranks of one of the world's largest cosmetics companies. But it's dedication, not privilege, that gives her an edge. Like most working parents, this mother of two tries to balance a high-octane schedule with family time. A common misconception about Lauder is that she's a social butterfly. ''I go to business-related events once or twice a week, but I rarely have the catch-up dinner with a girlfriend,'' she says. ''That's one thing I don't get to do very often, because I'd rather help my children with their homework, put them to bed and then order in sushi or pizza or make dinner for my husband.'' Her idea of familial bliss? Sporty weekends on Long Island filled with long beach walks, tennis, swimming and sailing. Back in the city, it's the occasional late-night cheeseburger date with her husband, Eric Zinterhofer, at Bemelmans Bar."

The photographs are a cut above street-fashion images, and yet not as glossy-perfect as those found in magazines. Remember how fuddy-duddy scarf-tying demonstrations used to be? Remember when people knotted a Hermes scarf on the strap of their bag? Well, here is how a luxury-goods company can make the connection between its heritage (and ultimately sales) and street-style sites. Some of you will recall Burberry's The Art of the Trench site, which shows images of people in their trench coats. But I think there's a little more value in the information contained in jaimemoncarre.com. It feels new. And arguably there are more ways to wear a scarf than a trench."
2010-08-22T00:00:00Z,"No one knows for sure whether the name Dogtown, for the area of North Little Rock, Ark., now known as the Argenta Arts District, originally came from the abandoned animals that once roamed its streets. What is certain is that in these six square blocks of vintage storefronts and artists' studios, a trolley ride across the Arkansas River from downtown Little Rock, urban desolation is giving way to urban cool. ''There's been a dramatic change even since we arrived,'' said Jody Hardin, who in 2008 co-founded the district's popular Saturday farmers' market, where only Arkansas purveyors are welcome. ''The galleries and restaurants, the new town homes and restored houses, are making this a place to be.'' CHRISTOPHER HALL"

2010-08-22T00:00:00Z,"At the turn of the last century, the belles of the French belle époque came down with a collective case of avian flou. ''A well-dressed woman nowadays,'' one journalist noted, ''is as fluffy as a downy bird fresh from the nest.'' From bonnets to boas and courtesans to countesses, lavish, look-at-me plumes covered everything and everyone posh. Like all status symbols, feathers were pricey -- the premium ostrich variety cost as much per pound as diamonds. Hard to fathom? Not really. If the feathered finery swanning down this season's runways makes one thing clear, it's that birds are the new/old/new bling. Twisting around gloves and lapels at Ann Demeulemeester, clustered on dress seams and shoe heels at Lanvin, sprayed across T-shirts at Givenchy, plumage has emerged, phoenix-like, from the fin de siècle's ashes. Notwithstanding the old saw about a bird in the hand, a well-dressed woman nowadays will surely want two in the bush. With its fluttery sensuousness and fragile grace, the feather might seem like the Platonic ideal of feminine adornment. But in fact, its migration to the Paris runways has only come after an extended exile in Guyville. In the ancient patriarchies of Babylon (2105-1240 B.C.) and Assyria (1200-540 B.C.), plumes mingled with palm fronds in sacred headgear for men. In medieval Europe, feathers featured principally on the metal helmets (heaumes) that men donned for war. Because their heaumes hid their faces, knights needed a means of distinguishing friend from foe in a split second. Feathers also came in handy when the knight tried his luck with the ladies. Based on the era's protocol for ''courtly'' love -- which served, in a brutish age, to separate the gentleman from the savage -- a suitor wore feathers in his damsel's special colors when he jousted or did battle, albeit with no guarantee of currying favor. As the 14th-century poet Christine de Pizan noted dismissively: ''To wear blue is no proof of love for one's lady.'' Henri IV, the first of the Bourbon monarchs and a fabled womanizer, made the feather a linchpin of his own, masculine mystique. At the end of the 16th century, when civil conflict threatened to tear France asunder, this great warrior-king enjoined his fractious subjects to ''rally around my panache blanc.'' This slogan was a spirited reference to the large white plume Henri wore in his hat, but the king was also reminding his people that his feather, like the medieval knights', would orient them in the chaos of war. Less loftily, the motto was a coarse anatomical pun, for it posited an equivalency between the king's big, long panache and his big, long . . . appendage. With this double entendre, Henri abandoned the delicacy of courtly love and rebranded the French lord as an unapologetic slayer of both ladies and men."
2010-08-22T00:00:00Z,"Many New York women of style have a dependency. It's the wearing of all black. The habit, which used to start as Labor Day approached, is now year-round. Marjorie Stern, top left, is one of the devotees. But last Monday while on her way to work, Ms. Stern appeared in shades of gray and exclaimed, ''I'm sick and tired of black.'' On Tuesday, as she made her way to the office, her threat appeared to be real. She had a leopard printed jacket -- yes, it was worn with black trousers -- but she returned to her old ways on Wednesday, dressed totally in black. But the coat was a sheer fabric, an interesting starlet of this steamy, scorching summer. Other women wore lacy black clothes, and a few wore sinuous black dresses for daytime. And even in the heat of summer, black leggings seemed glued to the legs of others. The majority of women rely on the basic black dress, top right. And two junior sophisticates at a party came in, what else, all black."

That's the maximum anyone pays in Social Security taxes, because earnings above $106,800 are not taxed. By slowly raising the cap -- say, 2 percent each year, though increasing it faster would raise more revenue -- so that it eventually covered 90 percent of all income, we could eliminate roughly a third of Social Security's projected shortfall. Next year, people like Mr. James would pay slightly more than they pay now while eventually receiving slightly higher benefits."

2010-08-22T00:00:00Z,"In an extreme case of camel coat envy, a frustrated New York socialite who had long fetishized the trench coat Ali MacGraw wore in ''Love Story'' engaged a patternmaker last year to copy it in caramel cashmere, down to the patch pockets and double-wide lapel and collar (which, like MacGraw's character, Jenny, you gotta wear popped). From Paris to New York, from Kate Moss to Blake Lively (who seem to be as attached to their fawn-colored coats as Grace Kelly and Katharine Hepburn were to theirs), camel is dans l'air this fall. Céline's Phoebe Philo jump-started the trend last spring with the ultimate boyfriend coat, a honey-toned Crombie. Jean Paul Gaultier -- in his penultimate, fall collection for Hermès -- showed a three-quarter camel coat pinched from the guys, saving his most luxurious discursion for duffel coats like the ones once worn by the British Royal Navy. Michael Kors imagined a gender mix-up at the coat check, or maybe that blushingly erotic moment when a gentleman slips his camel coat over his date's chilly shoulders. If it's all beginning to sound like a male conspiracy, well, a lot of women's outerwear in the buff register does lead back to the blokes. Think of the peacoat -- and the polo coat. Around 1900, polo players began wrapping themselves in camel ''wait coats'' -- patterned, essentially, on a dressing gown -- to keep warm between chukkers. Later, women borrowed freely of the details: half belt, full cut, chest pocket. In 1949 the camel coat was the American coed's favorite. Kors made winking reference to all that history, pairing a great big muff of a fur skirt with a camel knit tee. Among the other camel offerings were satin blouses and high-waisted slacks (Chloé), even a strapless dress (Gianfranco Ferré). But in the end, it was the camel coat that scored, whether sable-trimmed at Carolina Herrera or sleeveless at Alexander Wang. A real love story. CHRISTOPHER PETKANAS"

Let me fix your socks,'' Patricia Fox cries out when she spies Suzanne Golden's shoes, a pair of black and white Comme des Garçons winkle pickers festooned with rhinestone buckles that serve as a counterpoint to the rest of Golden's black-and-white Junya Watanabe ensemble. Fox, who is wearing a veiled chapeau with a blossom brim, a 1950s sequined floral jacket, a chiffon dress with a hobble skirt and a pair of beaded gloves, is meeting Golden for the first time at a tea party I have organized at the Carlyle Hotel, an event I refer to (but not out loud) as a ''nutty-dressers'' luncheon. In addition to Golden and Fox, there are two other invited guests: Tziporah Salamon (1930s cheongsam, bamboo pinwheel hat, 200-year-old Chinese handbag) and Iris Apfel (a tunic made by one of China's ethnic minorities, a clanging necklace from a Tunisian souk, signature humongous spectacles). I've been seeing these grande dames around town for years, and now, finally, I've got them all in one spot -- at one table -- so I can ask them how it came to be that the four of them glitter like spectacular if wacky jewels in an otherwise mostly mundane pedestrian landscape. So how did it all begin for you? I ask the ladies, who are busy fussing with the tea and looking one another up and down. (It should be noted that I am dressed very simply for the occasion, in a Gaultier dress printed with fish scales over a Bottega Veneta skirt so wide it might have daunted Marie Antoinette.) Fox gives her shoulder-grazing LaCroix earrings a toss (because her outfit needed one more thing?) and says seriously, ''I am consistent. My outward appearance goes with my inward feelings.

2010-08-22T00:00:00Z,"For the YouTube how-to maven Michelle Phan, making up is easy. CHRISTINE MUHLKE. 1 The beauty universe has embraced the future, thanks in no small part to women like Michelle Phan. The 23-year-old former Floridian, who still has a year to go at Ringling College of Art and Design, uses her talent with brushes and pencils to create video makeup tutorials that attract millions of viewers to her YouTube channel. (One of her Lady Gaga how-to's has garnered more than 10 million hits.) ''I consider beauty another form of painting,'' she says. ''Color theory and understandinghow the product works on a surface really helps me when I'm applying makeup.'' These days, she has less time to paint: she was tapped to be the (talking) face of Lancôme as its official video makeup artist. 2 Phan is already playing with fall's trends, from hot pink lipstick -- like this Lancôme Color Design Matte in Posh Pink ($22 at lancome.com) -- to the dramatic eyes and eyebrows seen at Balenciaga, Giorgio Armani, L'Wren Scott and the Row. 3 She's using the new brushes from her Iqqu collection, inspired by calligraphy brushes, to achieve the look. (This red kabuki brush is $30 at iqqubeauty.com.) 4 When not online,she finds time to read. ''I'm actually reading the Bible in a comic-book form,'' she says. ''It's crazy how entertaining it is when you see it drawn out!''5 Lancôme put Phan on its makeup team at Chris Benz's fall show, where she used the brand's new hyper-metallic Ombre Magnétique shadow in Black Macadam ($20, available at lancome.com) to create a grungy, street-chic look. (''It's like Play-Doh,'' she says of the texture.) Phan loved the energy backstage: ''It felt like I was on 'Iron Chef' for makeup artists!'' 6 Food is a passion. ''If I had to eat one thing for the rest of my life, that would be pho, a Vietnamese soup that not only tastes delicious but also cures sickness and hangovers.'' She seeks it out in local restaurants in Los Angeles, but her mom's is still her favorite. 7 Her preferred hunting ground for cosmetics? ''The more obscure, the better,'' she says. ''I'm a big Sephora fan. I also love drugstore finds,'' like L'Oréal H.I.P. Color Truth Cream Eyeliner ($12 at Walgreens) and Maybelline the Falsies mascara ($8 at drugstores). ''I use false lashes in most of my videos, so I'm always curious about any mascara that really amps up your lashes.'' 8 Phan gets hundreds of tutorial requests from her followers on Facebook, Twitter and YouTube -- ''anything with Miley Cyrus or Lady Gaga,'' she says with a laugh. Her lessons on five-minute makeup, smoky eyes for women who wear glasses and a sexy vampire makeover are especially popular. For her Halloween series, she's working on a full-blown Na'vi look from ''Avatar'': ''Contacts, fangs, ears and the tail . . . O.K., maybe not the tail. You wouldn't believe how many requests I've gotten for this.'' 9 Each video is a homemade production. Phan uses her Canon HD camcorder to film against a customized background projected on her TV screen (like the Alexander McQueen shoes in a Gaga how-to) and adds her favorite music for the soundtrack. (These days, Late Night Alumni, Kaskade and Samantha James are in heavy rotation.) 10 For someone who experiments with her looks for a living, Phan is surprisingly old-fashioned when it comes to beauty icons. Her favorite is Audrey Hepburn for her ''classic, timeless'' appeal. ''Her heart outshined her beauty.'' 11 Millions of women follow Phan's every stroke. Her best beauty tips? ''Tight-lining the eyes gives an appearance of fuller-looking lashes,'' she says, explaining,''This is where you apply your eyeliner to the top waterline, right underneath your lashes. Next, a light line of concealer running straight down the nose will give an illusion of a taller, skinnier nose. Lastbut not least, if all else fails, just smile.''"

Dare is the ultimate Hollywood candy man -- a warm, personable guy who can procure Fria, an Italian makeup remover, if that's what you need, or Collyre Bleu (1) for the hungover actor with bloodshot eyes. Nigel's Beauty Emporium, along with Naimie's Beauty Center and Frends Beauty Supply, is perhaps the San Fernando Valley's best-kept secret: a treasure trove of rarefied cosmetics brands where Hollywood makeup artists go to keep the likes of Sandra Bullock, Megan Fox and George Clooney powdered and buffed. Here they can scour hundreds of global brands, including ones you don't see everywhere (Embryolisse (2), La Peau (3) ) and the Japanese lines much beloved by the pros (KohGenDo, Kanebo). Here they can ask for and get Kate (5), the ultrathin Kanebo eyeliner that is barely detectable on the eye. Or the French -- and much stronger -- version of Anthelios, the sunscreen by La Roche-Posay. Or, for that matter, Labello lip balm (4), from Germany.

2010-08-22T00:00:00Z,"Movies haunt culture like starlit ghosts, circling our collective unconscious. Some insinuate themselves because they are comforting and friendly, which is not the case with ''Last Year at Marienbad,'' a famously impenetrable monument to the avant-garde directed by Alain Resnais. But the discovery of six reels of behind-the-scenes footage from 1960 forever fractures the movie's cool, calculated surface. With a Super-8 camera, Françoise Spira, a young cast member with a bit part, produced what seems like an amateur version of the film itself, her relationship to its protagonist, played by Delphine Seyrig, as intimate as Resnais's. Spira committed suicide a few years later, and her celluloid diary languished until 2008. The movie's second assistant director, Volker Schlöndorff, later turned it into the documentary ''The Making of 'Last Year at Marienbad,' '' which Diane von Furstenberg toasted at her studio in June after a screening at New York University. Schlöndorff was there, as well as Jean-Luc Godard's biographer Richard Brody, the photographer Steven Klein, Ahn Duong, Daphne Guinness and the documentary's principal promoter, Bernard-Henri Lévy. The film triggered an evening of mannered nostalgia. Von Furstenberg mused that when she's alone in a hotel she often thinks of Seyrig's character, captive of a fictional hotel, trapped in cycles of elegance and desire. Not surprisingly, von Furstenberg couldn't help referring to the film in creating interiors for Claridge's in London, trapped in her own way by Marienbad's spell. And while cinephiles are keenly aware of the picture's masterly construction, hallucinatory settings and gestures (the actors are often frozen in place, a sort of nascent voguing), fashion feeds what may be its truest fetish: dresses adapted from Chanel; Seyrig's haircut; and two feathered gowns by Bernard Evein, one white and one black, that have returned to us, visitations from a filmic netherworld, through the avian flutter of the fall collections.

2010-08-22T00:00:00Z,"Social Security should invest in collateralized debt obligations backed by subprime mort ... oops, that doesn't work. Actually, Social Security is not that bad off. It is in much better shape than state and local pensions or Medicare. In fact, it is in better shape than the rest of the federal budget, which has been borrowing the surplus that Social Security accumulated over many years and is now fretting because it will soon have to pay the money back. Got that? I didn't think so. Let's try again. Before ''fixing'' Social Security, we should think about what it is that we want to cure. The actuarial problem in Social Security is that, instead of each generation supporting itself, as in a normal pension system, in Social Security each generation supports its elders. Therefore, any generation has the power to bankrupt the system simply by failing to adhere to the Biblical injunction to ''go forth and multiply.'' If we baby boomers would have had no children, Social Security would be over, although our savings on education would be considerable. Seriously, though, we did have too few kids. So the system needs tinkering -- and it will always need tinkering as demographic patterns shift from one decade to the next."

2010-08-22T00:00:00Z,"MILLER--Alan Noel, Dr.,76, passed away on Friday, August 20th after a short battle with pancreatic cancer. Alan was widowed after 37 years of marriage to Libby Shana Halpern Miller, PhD. Prior to becoming a nephrologist, Dr. Miller earned an MBA in Finance and also had a career as an engineer. He served as a captain in the Special Forces training Green Berets. Alan was a loving and generous man with strong principles and convictions. An avid learner, he continued his education and quest for knowledge by taking classes at Columbia University all his life. He fostered others' desire for higher education through the sponsorship of mentoring programs and scholarships. Dr. Miller was a devoted Columbia man. He worked tirelessly to keep his class of 1956 connected and served as their president for many years. He also wrote the Class News for the Columbia Paper on a quarterly basis, and fellow ""Columbians"" referred to him as ""The Class Act."" A dedicated advocate of the 3x5 index card form of organization, he was also a proud cigar smoker, stock watcher and wine collector. Ol' Doc Al, or GGA, Grumpy Grandpa Al, as so lovingly referred to by his grandchildren, will be deeply missed. Always larger than life, he leaves a huge hole in his death. He is survived by his partner, Helene Ruddy, his mother Iris Miller, his daughter and son in law, Elisa Miller and Greg Griffin, his daughter, Jennifer van Voorst van Beest, his sister and brother-in-law, Barbara and Maurice Kupritz, his sister and brother-in-law, Mona and Lee Berg, his grandchildren, Zachary and Elana Griffin, Elijah and Isaac van Voorst van Beest and many other close relatives and friends. We love you doc. God speed. The funeral will be held at Riverside Memorial Chapel on 76th St. and Amsterdam Ave. on Sunday August 22nd at 11:45am. A graveside service will follow at Sharon Gardens.

2010-08-22T00:00:00Z,"Massimiliano Giornetti planned to spend his summer vacation in Puglia, a popular Italian getaway several hours from his home in Florence. ''I'm not entirely a free spirit on holiday,'' says the 38-year-old designer, who was recently named Ferragamo's creative director. ''I like some structure, with a little room to be adventurous.'' A perfect metaphor for his design mantra at Ferragamo, where he has helmed the men's-wear divison for the last decade. Any question as to whether Giornetti could translate his masculine sensibilities to the more mercurial closets of women was answered in his much lauded fall collection. He managed to channel the independent spirit of Salvatore Ferragamo's devoted customer, Greta Garbo, while creating sharp, assertive glamour: fur-lined capes, cuffed leather shorts, thick cable knits and a three-piece pinstriped suit that seemed like a 21st-century version of ''Annie Hall.'' ''I don't believe in fashion as provocation. I'm not interested in the 'wow' effect,'' he says. ''I'm more concerned with beauty and decoration. Fashion is not a primary necessity in life. The point of fashion is to make your daily life more special.'' Surprisingly, the designer felt no timidity tackling women's wear. ''Doing men's wear was actually more of a shock to me,'' he says. ''Women are braver about fashion. There is much more freedom in what you can attempt.''"

''Scaasi: American Couturier,'' a survey opening Sept. 25 at the Museum of Fine Arts, Boston, showcases his designs for four of his most loyal clients: the actresses Arlene Francis and Barbra Streisand, and the socialites Joetta Norban and Gayfryd Steinberg. Sitting beneath a late Picasso in his Manhattan living room, with a view of ships sailing leisurely along the East River in the background, the couturier (born Arnold Isaacs in 1930) talked to Leslie Camhi about his half century of making a very select group of women feel special.

2010-08-22T00:00:00Z,"TOYOTA, Goldman Sachs and BP have shown some of the steepest declines in public perception this year, according to research groups that analyze corporate reputations based on online polls and phone calls. Although some experts say the online polls should be used with caution -- as the respondents may not represent the entire population -- others say they are one of the best ways to keep tabs on fast-moving public sentiment. Toyota has regained close to half the public support it lost after late January, according to daily public perception scores collected by YouGov, a market research firm. (That month, Toyota suspended sales of eight models over fears about uncontrolled acceleration.) Experts attribute Toyota's rebound to its longstanding reputation for quality and doubt about whether the company was to blame for the problems. Goldman Sachs, on the other hand, has had a negative public perception score since 2008, when the government helped bail out Wall Street. And after the company was charged with fraud in April -- a case later settled -- it continued to see damage to its reputation."

This mix master wasn't a model or a downtown doyenne: it was Ruth Flowers, a k a Mamy Rock, a grandmother well into her 70s who has put in appearances at Cannes, Glastonbury and Paris, where her ''factotum'' is based. ''I thought, What are they going to think of this old biddy who gets up there to play records?'' she says from her home in southwest England. Inspired to become a D.J. when she attended her grandson's birthday party, Flowers has worked with a French producer on mixing, as well as on her ''stage persona,'' which includes a hairstyle that ''looks as if I've been plugged into an electricity cord.'' Spinning has eclipsed some of her other hobbies, like giving historical talks about Henry VIII, but she's happy to be busy.

His collection, which he started in Tokyo in 2007, uses the finest Japanese silks and cashmere -- to wildly irreverent effect. Artificial growth, for example, is his theme for this fall. This plays itself out in something as unusual as a pill motif, which the designer blows up into a giant two-toned capsule (left), whose colorful geometry drapes around the neck. ''I tend to like gigantism,'' David says. ''I thought I could make the silk scarves look very different and interesting [by] changing prints and proportions.''

Many items in the store, like this suede and pinstriped denim jacket ($6,250) by Agatha, are one of a kind.

All good reasons, sure, but sometimes we're drawn to things simply because they give us a warm, fuzzy feeling, which is harder to explain. And I felt it recently when I spotted a set of strangely shaped water carafes at a design show in Milan."

Perhaps the last piece touched by the designer's hands, it was made by McQueen especially for his longtime friend Annabelle Neilson, and its only outing has been to Elton John's White Tie and Tiara Ball in June. Neilson was notorious for wearing McQueen's clothes and she did so with a fierceness befitting her status as his muse. A sheer black jumpsuit from 2006, a mere figment of McQueen's imagination that left nothing to anyone else's, generated reams of chatter and flaunted the designer's devilish streak. Indeed he was often heralded as fashion's enfant terrible No. 1. But in this simply elegant silk charmeuse gown with its collar of silvered feathers, Neilson appeared as the vision of an angel.

Langlois died in New York City early on August 19th, surrounded by family and friends, after a courageous battle with cancer. He is survived by his wife of 43 years, Hsin I and other family members. Known as Jack to his many friends, he passed between the worlds of academia and finance as smoothly as he traveled between Asia and the United States. He took equal pleasure in unraveling the intricacies of Chinese history and the complexities of international finance. Jack spoke Chinese and Japanese with elegance, precision and wit, informed by years of classical study and practical negotiation. A Ming specialist and talented Chinese linguist with a PhD from Princeton, where he studied under the legendary Fritz Mote, Jack was Professor and Chairman of the History Department at Bowdoin College before embarking on a successful career as an investment banker. Jack held several senior positions with J.P. Morgan and Morgan Stanley in Asia, including Managing Director of J.P. Morgan (China) and Chairman of Morgan Stanley Properties (China). Combining his experience in finance and fluency in Mandarin, Jack served on the board of Directors of China's CITIC Bank, Shenzhen Development Bank, Bank of Nanjing, Bank of Shanghai, and the Agricultural Bank of China - one of the first and very few foreigners to do so. His discreet advice was valued by finance and treasury officials in both Beijing and Washington. He most recently served as Vice Chairman of Global Strategic Associates in New York. Jack continued work as a scholar during his finance career, contributing his deep knowledge of the Ming Dynasty (1368-1644) to the Cambridge History of China, presenting academic papers, and teaching a course at Princeton University. His gracious and subtle scholarship appealed to his colleagues and students, while his gentle humor and quiet integrity endeared him to his many friends on both sides of the Pacific. Funeral Services are private. There will however, be a celebration of Jack's life at a later date. In lieu of flowers, please send all memorial donations in Jack's name to The Pulmonary Education Fund, Lennox Hill Hospital, 100 East 77th Street, New York, NY 10075.

2010-08-22T00:00:00Z,"WILSON--John Hill Tucker, a leading investment banker who spent 33 years with Morgan Stanley before beginning a second, and equally distinguished, 17 year career in public service and philanthropy, died on August 12, 2010 at his home in Greenwich, CT after a valiant, five year battle with cancer. He was 76. Throughout his life Mr. Wilson distinguished himself through force of intellect, boundless energy, innate leadership, extraordinary sense of humor and, most importantly, kindness and concern for family and friends. These qualities made him one of the most successful and productive citizens of his generation. At Morgan Stanley, Mr. Wilson was a Managing Director, serving in many capacities, including Head of the Financial Institutions Group and Co-Head of the Investment Banking Division. During his 33 year (1960-1993) career with the firm his clients included many of the major corporate enterprises of the country. In 2005, he was one of the so-called ""Group of Eight,"" former senior executives of Morgan Stanley and significant shareholders who organized to express their concern over the leadership, governance and direction of the firm. Mr. Wilson's charitable endeavors included his service as Trustee, and for five years Chairman, of Environmental Defense, a leading advocate for environmental causes. He also served as Trustee of the Doris Duke Charitable Foundation, Chairman of the Union Settlement Association in East Harlem, Chairman of Board of Trustees of Greenwich Hospital (Greenwich, CT), Chairman of Board of Trustees of Brunswick School (Greenwich, CT), Advisory Board Member of the Princeton University Environmental Institute, and a Co-Founder and Director and Officer of Classroom, Inc., an NGO that developed innovative technologically based teaching methods for use in public schools nationally. In 1962, Mr. Wilson married Sandra Wilson (no relation) of Rye, NY. This marriage of almost five decades was a fortress of love, strength and support not only for themselves but for their children, grandchildren and the exceptionally large number of friends this union touched through their 48 years together. Mr. Wilson will be remembered particularly for the care and support he gave to his wife, family, friends and the community through and despite the health challenges of recent years and his remarkable ability to find contentment, even happiness, in the most challenging of circumstances. Mr. Wilson was born on May 24, 1934 in Charlotte, NC. He graduated in 1956 from Princeton University, with a B.A. degree in history, magna cum laude, and a Phi Beta Kappa key. He was a Baker Scholar at Harvard Business School, graduating in 1960. He served in U.S. Army Intelligence from 1956 to 1958. Sandra survives Mr. Wilson, as do his four children, Tucker, Will, Emily and David, and ten grandchildren. A Memorial Service will be held on September 24, 2010 at 12 noon at the Round Hill Community Church located at 395 Round Hill Road in Greenwich, CT.

2010-08-22T00:00:00Z,"One of the few ideas for cutting Social Security benefits that seems to have bipartisan support is raising the normal retirement age to perhaps 70. (It has recently risen to 66 for people born after 1942, and it will rise to 67 for people born after 1959.) Because such an age increase would need to be phased in over a long period, it doesn't generate as much opposition as other cost-saving measures or tax increases. The problem is that hardly anyone retires at the normal retirement age. According to the Social Security Administration, 43 percent of men and 48 percent of women on Social Security in 2008 began drawing benefits at age 62. An additional 15 percent of men and women started at age 63 or 64. In short, about two-thirds of those eligible are retiring before the normal retirement age."

His 1972 Golgotha chair, part of the permanent collection at MoMA, was the first of his many forays into the world of mass customization: its Dacron-filled seat assumed different shapes depending on who sat on it. Now, another clever bit of personalization: Pesce's new shoe for the Brazilian company Melissa -- an ankle bootie composed of interconnected PVC circles, whose form can change at the whim of its owner with a swift slice of the scissors. Cut once, and the boot becomes a bootie; cut again, and it's a ballet flat, a peep toe, a sandal or even a flip-flop. ''This is the future of mass production,'' Pesce says.

The tribute beings with Disney's ''Swiss Family Robinson'' (1960), based on the book by Johann Wyss, in which Mills portrays the patriarch of a family (above, from left, Tommy Kirk, Dorothy McGuire, Mills and James MacArthur) en route to New Guinea. The family members build a new life -- and an enormous treehouse -- after they're shipwrecked on a tropical island. At 10:15 in ''The Rocking Horse Winner'' (1949), adapted by Anthony Pelissier from the short story by D. H.

For their controversial ''Black Hole'' show in 2001 (center), they covered their models -- and themselves -- in black.

(A look from fall 2010 is at far left.) Now, given the chance to riff on our logo, they had the makeup artist Val Garland slap a giant ''T'' on the face of the golden blond model Jessica Stam, whom the megawatt photographer Nick Knight then photographed (''Fresh Paint,'' Page 179). As with most of the duo's creative decision-making, coming up with this concept was a case of tea -- or make that T -- for two. ''We are control freaks,'' Snoeren says.
