1990-07-08T00:00:00Z,"LEAD: Etienne Chatiliez is the big noise these days in popular French cinema. In 1988, after directing some 70 television commercials notable both for their humor and their against-the-techno-glitz-grain narrative qualities, he made a resounding leap into feature film with ''Life Is a Long Quiet River,'' which opens in New York on Friday at the Paris Theater."
1990-07-08T00:00:00Z,"LEAD: About 20 years ago, Connecticut politicians tried tinkering with the state's tax system and brought on a political clampdown.

There was also a fragrance in the yard, but it was not apparent where it was coming from. Only a few plants were in bloom, as it was a between time, past the glories of spring, but not quite ready for the opulence of annuals."
1990-07-08T00:00:00Z,"LEAD: There are at least 120,000 Thais living in the greater Los Angeles area today - more than in any other region outside Thailand itself. What has drawn them to the city? Prakas Yenbamroong, a Thai banker-turned-restaurateur who has himself been an L.A. resident since 1979, suspects that it has something to do with the area's climate, which he considers not unlike that of Thailand- and, he adds unexpectedly, with the city's profusion of Chinese and Mexican restaurants."
1990-07-08T00:00:00Z,LEAD: Dripping Air-Conditioner Question: We live in a very old building in Manhattan. Since tenants above us installed a very powerful air-conditioner in their window water constantly drips and often pours from it down to our ledge and window sill.

1990-07-08T00:00:00Z,LEAD: The history of the game is replete with accidents of various kinds. The first occurred in 1929 when Ely Culbertson took his foursome to Paris following a victory in London. The scoring was French-style ''plafond'' with which the Americans were not familiar and the host country had a small lead throughout.

So might Thierry Mugler of France, Katharine Hamnett of Britain or, for that matter, any number of world-class style provocateurs in search of new ideas.

Madrasis and visitors pore over their morning papers, washing down patties and pancakes with small cups of sweet, milky coffee."
1990-07-15T00:00:00Z,"LEAD: The rhythm was fluid, the location precise, the fastball flat-out fierce, all of which made the analysis in his own mind indisputable.

1990-07-15T00:00:00Z,"LEAD: In northeast Greenwich, 26 stately pleasure domes have been built at Conyers Farm, a 1,500-acre enclave resembling a contemporary Xanadu.

1990-07-15T00:00:00Z,"LEAD: Rock-and-roll, with its unbookish culture, seems an unlikely candidate to adopt a literary figure. But there is no longer any doubt that the perennial iconoclast-author William Burroughs has been given a lifetime pass to the rock-and-roll circus. The bassist and songwriter Bill Laswell, leading a loose assemblage of players he calls Material, recently drafted the writer to read excerpts from his latest novel, ''The Western Lands,'' as part of the album ''Seven Souls'' (Virgin 91360; CD and cassette)."

1990-07-15T00:00:00Z,"LEAD: KENT has art galleries like cities have bars. The number has gone from zero to seven in less than seven years - roughly one per 350 inhabitants.

1990-07-15T00:00:00Z,"LEAD: Yes, there are those of us who ''failed'' at experimental education, who caught the bus back to requirements and midterms and cumulative grade-point averages.

1990-07-15T00:00:00Z,"LEAD: The summer months tend to dull City Hall's conscience on the homeless problem: with no one likely to freeze to death, the lack of decent shelter seems less urgent.

1990-07-28T00:00:00Z,"We aren't all blessed with Wordsworth's sense of childhood as a romantic idyll, but even hack film makers who think a malevolent orphan is raw comic material might show more imagination than they do in ''Problem Child.'' Junior is a red-haired, freckle-faced 7-year-old, a ringer for Opie on television's ''Andy Griffith Show.'' Imagine what would have happened if Andy and Aunt Bea had abandoned Opie at birth, and the unloved boy had turned into a child who writes fan letters to a famous murderer. That is the totally unfulfilled concept behind the movie. Despite his strange attachment to a killer, Junior is mischievous in the way only derivative screenwriters and directors conditioned by sit-coms could possibly find amusing. So Junior is enough to try the patience of a nun? ''Problem Child'' shows him infuriating nuns at an orphanage, sometimes by calling them penguins. No one ever said he was original. When he is adopted by a middle-class family, he sets fire to his room and tosses the cat around. This behavior never seems dangerous, and it never seems funny."

However, I doubt Merkin would be sympathetic to men who ''need'' to fantasize about physically beautiful, intellectually inferior, sexually submissive women to help them endure."

Directors of the Met, which has been without a chief administrator since Hugh Southern was forced out as general manager in June, last week named John Volpe to the job. Sort of.
