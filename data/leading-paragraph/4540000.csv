The subject of interest was Miss Ronstadt, his celebrity friend, not Jimmy Carter, the missing candidate who at chat hour was likely on the White House phone to another 20 Iowans. Here in Iowa, there is a loose overlay of TV commer cials, but the basic tactic is voter identification by tele phone. While Ronald Reagan gave only a modicum of visiting time to the state, his campaign organization had 50 telephones going into each night. The technique is to reach out through Republican voting lists, just say ""Hi,"" and then quickly brain-pick the preferences of the persons called. Ones that come up Reagan or ""maybe"" then are put on new lists to be called and repeat edly toward the crucial step of getting them down to their neighborhood caucus. (Each party divides Iowa into 2,531 precincts in six Congressional districts; or, to put it an other way, in three area codes.) For the Democrats, Iowa was to be the exciting start of the long awaited candidacy of Senator Kennedy, bear ing the honored standard of his brothers in an insurgent challenge to the incumbent Mr. Carter. But as world crises intensified, driving Mr. Carter's once anemic lead ership rating up in the polls, the President stayed in Wash ington and cancelled a national television debate with Senator Kennedy and Governor Brown that had been scheduled for Jan. 7."

He wears a red dress with a fringe and holds out a bag from which money appears to be pour ing. Although Miss Hammond's de signs are all fascinating for the gamut of history they cover--from the ""Star Spangled Pig of Troy"" to the Aztec sign for gold, runes and the marks of medie val stonemasons and armorers to cat tle brands in Texas--she is most inter esting from the artistic point of view when working more realistically. Her most ambitious work, however, is in the large group of landscapes and seascapes and architectural views. Some of the most beautiful are scenes of New York City, particularly the ': small ""Lonely Encounter"" and ""Growth of a Giant."" The one shows a gray building with windows shadowed in black and in front of it a yellow bull-- ; dozer; the other deals with red scat folding being erected in front of fin ished buildings. The artist has not been greatly affected by Cubism, or for that matter, by Surrealism. One can tell, however, that she was around when these movements broke in the United States, whether by the whiff of Stuart Davis that emanates from the city ' scenes or from the de Chirico-like ef fect she achieves in works such as ""Ruined Temple,"" two classical col--' umns in black casting shadows on a, desert under a blue sky."

Like Jonah's gourd that grew up in a night and per ished in a night, the making of Yiddish talking pictures began in New York in 1931 and ended in the early 40's after Hitler's invasion of eastern Europe.

The robes are superbly hung on a Tinker-Toy-like framework designed by Cleo Nichols. All that is missing is seeing how the symbolism of each coat came alive when it was worn. For it was the Manchu belief that the human body became the axis of the world, and the wearer s head the apex of the uni verse. The bottom edge of the garment is invariably stitched with a rainbow of stripes or swirls depicting the ocean. Surprisingly, these splendid borders were all anyone saw of the richly orna mented robe worn at court. Surcoats -- dark, unbelted garments bearing the pictorial insignia of rank-became re quired attire in 1759, and these coats covered most of the ravishing robes fa vored by royalty and their followers.

Individuals should run for the school board because they care about the education of the children, and can bring a particular point of view or ex pertise that will help provide a sound and effective educational program. Af filiation with a particular political party does not necessarily provide that input. Why can t we elect school board members in this state based upon their independent thinking rather than their party affiliations? During the 11 years of my tenure on the Freeport board, I was elected chairman on four different occasions without regard to my per sonal political associations.

Waving above the heads of the 150,000 supporters who flocked to cheer him were banners proclaiming ""Nkomo for stability,"" ""Nkomo for peace,"" ""Nkomo for unity."" The preference helps explain the heavy-handed policy that British colonial authorities in Rhodesia have adopted toward Mr. Nkomo's erstwhile partner in the guerrilla war, Robert Mugabe, who London fears might prove a practicing as well as a rhetorical Marxist in power. The British also doubt that Mr. Mugabe could survive the violent factional fighting that has characterized hls Zimbabwe African Na tional Union since it broke with Mr. Nkomo in 1963. Some officials in Salisbury argue that even a Mugabe abrogation of the truce would not torpedo the settlement, as long as Mr. Nkomo remained ""on-side,"" as the Rhodesian parlance adopted by the British expresses it. If Mr. Mugabe pulled out, so the argument goes, he would be leaving the electoral field open to his rivals, primarily Mr. Nkomo and white Rhodesians' first black standard-bearer, Bishop Abel T. Muzorewa. The government that emerged, if it included Mr. Nkomo, would be assured of the backing of much of the world, presumably including the Soviet Union, Mr. Nkomo's principal backer in the war. China, Mr. Mugabe's main sup plier, would have the unenviable choice of accepting the new government or of supporting a continued insurgency with no certainty of success. The same considerations would apply for Tanzania and Mozambique, Mr. Mugabe's best African friends, with the added drawback that support for a pro tracted war would deny their battered economies the relief that peace in Rhodesia could bring."

When a table lamp or floor lamp tends to flicker every time it is moved or tilted, or if the bulb doesn't light even though you know it is O.K, and the switch is on, very often the trouble is in side the socket into which the bulb screws. After unplugging the lamp cord, remove the bulb and look inside the empty socket. At the bottom you will see a small piece of springy metal that is supposed to press up against the bottom of the bulb to make electrical contact with the center of the bulb s base. sometimes this piece of metal gets coated with din or corro sion, and sometimes it loses some of its springiness and gets pressed down so that it no longer makes firm contact with the bottom of the bulb, even when the bulb is screwed down tight.

Cleveland, Repub lican of New Hampshire, who is a high-ranking mi nority member of the Public Works and Transporta tion Committee. Since Mr. Ambro ranks high in the Democratic majority of that committee, the Ambro Cleveland combination would seem to enhance the prospects of the bill reaching the House floor if the Senate acted favorably on it. It also would provide millions in New York to com bat beach erosion on Coney Island and in Connecticut for flood control in the Mamaroneck and Sheldrake River Basins and the Byram River. But Senator Moynihan wants to provide for such a huge project as New York City's third water tunnel, some thing that probably would not get funds under the present system. The tunnel vas under construction from 1970 until 1975, when the city s fiscal crisis forced a halt in work on it. A total of $350 million has been spent on the tunnel, which is to stretch someday for 12.7 miles from the Hillview Reservoir in Yonkers and supply all five boroughs. It has been dogged by delays and litigation, with six contractors suing the city last year for work that they said they had not been paid for. They sued for $100 million and settled for $18 million. The House of Representatives is to vote this week on the Rivers and Harbors Act, which also contains provision for a $25 million loan for the water tunnel.

1980-01-20T00:00:00Z,"The academy report, ""Energy in Transition,"" seemed a fitting addition to an unplanned trio, coming as it did on the heels of ""Energy Future,"" the popular, conservation-ori ented book by seven faculty members of the Harvard Busi ness School, plus a pair of like-minded studies by Resources for the Future, a Washington think tank. Nonetheless, gains from energy efficiency have proved highly rewarding, say its advocates. Without this surprise element, they point out, the country would be importing 50 percent more oit than it is now doing. Indeed, greater energy efficiency has been by far the most helpful factor in the mix of supply and demand responses that have come about since the Arab oil embargo six years ago. ""We have gotten more energy from efficiency improvements than from any form of supply--including oil imports,"" says Lee Schipper, a staff scientist at Lawrence Berkeley Laboratory and a con tributor to the National Academy of Science study. ""The continuation of artificially low prices would tably widen the gap between domestic supply and demand, and this could only be made up [by] increased imports, a policy that would be increasingly hazardous and difficult to sustain,"" the National Academy of Science study warns. ""Indeed,"" its authors add, ""as energy prices rise, the nation will face important losses in economic growth if we do not significantly increase the economy s energy efficiency."" They also say the Government should continue passing regulations, standards and incentives when necessary to as sist the ""invisible hand"" of the marketplace."

""Last fall, I couldn't find anyone who was openly for Carter, and now it s turned around completely,"" said one Democratic politician, with long ties to the Kennedy family, who still backs the Senator but is worried about the outlook.
