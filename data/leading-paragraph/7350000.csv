The extended Roosevelt and Foehl families mourn the death of our dear Emily who passed away suddenly and unexpectedly on April 11, 2010, at home in Park City, Utah. Born in White Plains, New York on August 13, 1969, Emily demonstrated to all who knew and loved her that she would live life to the fullest with no regrets. Empathy, inquisitiveness, courage, and determination defined her daily life. Emily graduated from Whitby School, The Millbrook School, the University of Virginia, and the University of Maine School of Law. She served with distinction as a law clerk for The Honorable Judge Monroe McKay of the United States Court of Appeals for the 10th Circuit in Salt Lake City from 1997 to 2000. In 2000, until her death, she worked in the Regional Solicitor's office of the United States Department of the Interior in Salt Lake City, Utah where she worked tirelessly on behalf of public land issues. In June 2008, Emily received the greatest gift of all a new heart. We want to thank the team at University of Utah Hospital for giving her the best care possible. We also extend our profound thanks to Emily's donor and family for giving her a new lease on life. Since receiving her new heart, Emily became an outspoken advocate for organ donation and patient care, helping to raise funds and awareness, supporting others going through the transplant process, and serving as the master of ceremonies for the ribbon cutting of the Patient Care Pavilion at the University of Utah Hospital in July 2009. Emily will be forever missed and celebrated by all her ""stars and angels"" including her husband, Peter Foehl; her sons Mason and Liam; her parents Chris and Roddy Roosevelt; her sister Kate and her partner Caroline; her brother Chris, his wife Christina, and their sons Noah and Wylie; her in-laws Allen and Sally Foehl; Pete's brother Chas, his wife Sara, and their children Walker and Reed; Pete's brother Dave and his wife Carol; her beloved grandmother Rosalind E. Havemeyer; many uncles, aunts, and cousins; and a huge community of friends and colleagues across the country. Emily would have wanted everyone to become an organ donor (organdonor.gov), rather than sending flowers. You may also honor her life by donating to Intermountain Donor Services (c/o Debbie Snider, IDS, 230 S. 500 E., Ste. 290, Salt Lake City, UT 84102) or the charity of your choice. A celebration of Emily's life will be held on Saturday, April 17 at 4pm at Park City Community Church, 4501 N. Highway 224, Park City, Utah. The family will be providing further information about a memorial service to be held in New England this summer."

That's because he is the only black player on the team, a vivid example of the diminishing participation of African-Americans in baseball."

2010-04-16T00:00:00Z,"PORTLAND, Ore. -- The regular season came to a bizarre end here Wednesday night, in a game between the league's two most injury-depleted teams. As the playoff-bound Trail Blazers mostly rested their key players in a game that had no consequence for their postseason positioning, the low-run Golden State Warriors brought just eight players. Two of them (Ronny Turiaf and Anthony Morrow) were declared unfit to play by the team's trainer during warmups. Midway through the first quarter, center Chris Hunter aggravated his knee. So Coach Don Nelson, who recently became the career victories leader, used five players for the rest of the game. Well, he tried. When Devean George fouled out in the fourth quarter, Nelson argued that he had no players left and that George could remain in the game while the Warriors were assessed a technical foul. Officials said that one of the other players on the bench must enter the game. The game stalled as the sides argued. Ultimately, Nelson lost the argument. He inserted Hunter for about a minute. Then he pulled him for Turiaf, who fouled seven seconds later. Nelson took Turiaf out and inserted Morrow, who played nine seconds. Finally George, with six fouls, came in to finish the final 3 minutes, 29 seconds, and the Warriors were assessed a technical foul. ''They made me put injured players in,'' Nelson said after the game. ''That's not right.'' Warriors players missed more than 500 combined games because of injuries this season. But with Stephen Curry (42 points, 9 rebounds, 8 assists), Monta Ellis (34 points), Anthony Tolliver and Reggie Williams each playing 48 minutes, they managed to beat the Blazers, 122-116. It was Nelson's 1,335th career victory. The Warriors finished 26-56, and the Blazers (50-32) head to a first-round matchup with Phoenix. ''What a bizarre game, huh?'' Nelson said. This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print."

2010-04-18T00:00:00Z,"For years, only a simple sign indicated the location of what was once the Nazi secret police headquarters in Berlin. ''You are standing on the grounds of the former torture chambers of the Gestapo,'' it read. More recently, an outdoor exhibition, called ''The Topography of Terror,'' has marked the spot. On May 7, the exhibition is scheduled to get a new home: a glass and concrete museum and documentation center built on same site. The building (Niederkirchnerstrasse 8; 49-30-25-45-09-50; topographie.de), which cost just over 21 million euros, about $28 million, includes exhibition spaces, a multimedia research library, and seminar rooms. A main draw will be a permanent exhibition that examines Nazism and its victims. And there will be physical reminders of the city's past: The Berlin Wall once ran right through the area, and a section of the infamous barrier remains intact along the border of the new complex."

2010-04-18T00:00:00Z,"In January 2009, Michael Najjar of Berlin was part of a team that ascended and took photographs of Mount Aconcagua in Argentina, and he was struck by how much the silhouette of the mountain--the Western Hemisphere's highest, at more than 22,800 feet--resembled a stock-price chart. Using Photoshop, he digitally altered the mountain's outlines so that they traced trajectories of nine market movements over time, in a series he calls ''High Altitude.'' (There is some artistic license: the chart lines of the Dow, Russian Trading System and Nasdaq composite run from the far left of the corresponding images to about two-thirds of the way across. The Lehman ''mountain'' is at an angle.) On the mountainside as with investing, Mr. Najjar notes, if you focus solely on the summit's glory you might ignore the risks and fall. These photographs, he says, are an effort to ''rematerialize'' market data so it is more understandable."

The daughter of George Ivanovich Gurdjieff and Jessmin Howarth, Dushka was a multifaceted and highly creative woman: in early life, a publicist for such renown entertainers in the Harlem jazz scene as Nat King Cole and Dick Hymen; later, a talented popular singer with a huge multicultural repertory; still later, returning to her roots, a dedicated teacher and advisor for the Gurdjieff Sacred Dances. She devoted her last years to preserving the heritage of her father and mother, in part by founding the Gurdjieff Heritage Society. Her archival efforts resulted in the publication of a complete set of Gurdjieff's harmonium music in 2005, and soon after recordings of the original orchestral scores for Gurdjieff's Oriental Suite. In 2009, she published a 500 page memoir and family photo album, ""It's Up To Ourselves"": A Mother, A Daughter, and Gurdjieff. Dushka was truly unique. She will be remembered.

Hopper, Kyle, Max, Miles, Stefan, and Zephyr. Didi was a journalist, an activist, an unyielding champion of civil rights, the women's movement, AIDS awareness and numerous humanitarian efforts. Born in Chicago, Didi traveled the world, living in Thailand, Italy, and Nicaragua. An outspoken critic of American imperialism, she marched against the war in Vietnam, wars in Latin America and the Middle East. She worked in New York City at the ""God Box,"" with the Methodist Church, and traveled to Haiti to help deliver humanitarian aid there. She lived and worked in Bangkok where she wrote for the Bangkok World newspaper and later co-owned and worked as a journalist for Chaturat Magazine - a radical, left wing monthly. Later, she lived in Managua where she worked with the humanitarian organization C.E.P.A.D. to help create an independent Nicaragua. In New York, she became a spokesperson for New York's Suffolk County Chapter of ACT-UP and founded Thursday's Child, an organization in Long Island that provided housing for families with AIDS. Didi dedicated herself to advocating for, writing about, and giving voice to society's oppressed, ignored, and forgotten. Her passions were her five children and her partner, Mary Ann Knoke. Didi was a great listener and a tireless source of encouragement, advice, and support. She died from ailments too numerous to mention, most of which were related to cigarette smoking. She leaves a legacy of perseverance, compassion, generosity, and strength. She was a diligent warrior, a devoted humanitarian, and a beautiful soul.

2010-04-18T00:00:00Z,"COHEN--Rosalie Palter, 99, of New Orleans and Cincinnati, died peacefully on April 7. Predeceased by husband Joseph Cohen M.D., and sister Mildred Brown. Mother of Carmel J. Cohen (Babette) and Sharon Leviton (Jim); grandmother of Lisa Cohen Liman (Lewis); Jonathan Cohen (Mariza); and David Leviton. Great-grandmother of five. Inspired by her mentor, the eminent poet and scholar Ephraim Lisitsky, Rosalie became a scholar of Jewish learning and philosophy. She embraced the concept of Tikkun Olam, and created programs and institutions that became the bedrock of the New Orleans Jewish Community. She was the first female president of the Jewish Federation of New Orleans from 1959 to 1961; a cofounder in 1960 of the New Orleans Lemann Stern Young Leadership Group, which educates young Jewish women and men in leadership skills and philanthropy; and, in 1962, of the Home for the Jewish Aged, now Woldenberg Village. She developed educational programs for New Orleans's Jewish women: the New Orleans Enduring Heritage Institute, 19651972; a forum for presidents of Jewish women's organizations, 1980s; and a Torah study group, 19851993. At the national level, she was the first elected female vice president of the American Council of Jewish Federations, 19631965, and she was in the leadership of Hadassah. She was a founding member of the National Foundation for Jewish Culture (NFJC) in 1960. Possessing physical beauty, charm, idealism, and determination, she was just 19 when she and husband Joe honeymooned at the 1929 World Zionist Congress in Zurich, at which the Jewish Agency was born. They were soon (erroneously) reported killed in Arab-Jewish skirmishes in Palestine. 75 years later she became a refugee of Hurricane Katrina. In the years between, she built a family and was a cherished friend and mentor. New Orleans was her home, but the institutions that she inspired extend nationally and internationally. She once said, simply, ""I have had a vision of what a Jewish community ought to be, and I felt I had a responsibility."" Funeral services were held in New Orleans on Sunday, April 11 at Congregation Shir Chadash."

A team can get away with an undersize player in the middle during the regular season, the way the 2006-7 Warriors did with Al Harrington, but that weakness is often highlighted in the playoffs, as when Harrington had to face the much larger Carlos Boozer in the second round. The Dallas Mavericks, who coasted into this season's playoffs as the No. 2 seed in the Western Conference, will be hoping that Jason Kidd, the team's veteran point guard and potential Hall of Famer, does not have a drop-off in production as he had in the playoffs the last two seasons, a trend often attributed to a lack of quickness."

Indeed, with his modernist wash-and-wear cuts that freed women of their fussy, salon-crafted coifs, Vidal Sassoon, still sprightly at 82, had an incredible impact on both pop culture and social conventions. And his life beyond the Five-Point Bob -- living in an orphanage in London; working as a bike messenger during the blitzkrieg -- is pretty remarkable as well. Using archival footage and present-day interviews with family, colleagues and the man himself, the film's director, Craig Teper, explores it all.

The show traces her life from Philadelphia socialite to Hollywood star to Oscar winner, and finally to her fairy-tale role as Princess Grace of Monaco. Though classically beautiful, she achieved her status not simply by virtue of her features but with her sense of style. It helped, of course, that her outfits were designed by the likes of Dior, Balenciaga and Givenchy."

But Bridges, a dining spot that opened in Sofitel's Amsterdam the Grand hotel last November, is appropriately named in another respect: the chef, Aurélien Poirot, creates dishes that bridge cultures. That's obvious from the start. One amuse-bouche of tiny curried shrimp is followed by another of sashimi with wasabi cream. The fusion also worked well in the halibut saté, served with bok choy and fingerling potatoes. The spicy sauce, incorporating crunchy bits of peanuts, gave a tangy kick to the mild, perfectly roasted fillet."

The class votes on a theme that best captures its mood. The final act of putting paint on wall seems to inspire raw emotion. Says Ashley Peters, an alumna of the women's college: ''It really signifies the end of the Scripps College experience.'' THE FENCE The class of 1924 donated a fence to Carnegie Mellon as a place for seniors to meet and greet, and it soon became a campus billboard. The Guinness Book of World Records named it the most painted object in the world. Flash forward to 1993, when it collapsed under the weight of so much paint and had to be rebuilt, in concrete. Student groups apply a message every day or so. There are rules: The fence can be painted only between midnight and sunrise, and only with a brush (students stand guard overnight to make sure no one paints over their work). Should someone break a rule, says Damien Valdes, a senior, ''they'd be ostracized from their peer group immediately.''"

2010-04-19T17:42:22Z,"""This kerfuffle [over whether to allow streetcar wires in Washington D.C.] is about more than just ugly wires ... It gets to the heart of an old and familiar conflict over how Washingtonians and Americans at large envision the city. In its coverage, The Post has referred to opponents of wires as 'preservationists,' but I think 'D.C. monumentalists' better describes their stance. For the monumentalist, Washington, D.C., the city comes second to Washington, D.C., the sanitized and photogenic capital. The monumentalist vision of Washington has choked nearly all urban life from the Mall and its environs. It has fashioned large sections of our city into pleasing vistas for tourists but has given the rest of us lifeless wastelands (if you've ever stepped foot outside at L'Enfant Plaza, you know what I'm talking about). Streetcar wires aren't pretty, but urbanity isn't always pretty. In fact, a vibrant, organic city is unabashedly messy, as exemplified by the hodgepodge of architectural styles, the variety of uses and the diversity of people in the District's thriving historic neighborhoods. It is hardly a victory for historic preservation if struggling areas of the city are cut off from an avenue to rejuvenation simply to preserve an unfettered view or two of the Capitol dome. The monumental core should be the city's heart, not its parasite."""

2010-04-19T10:25:38Z,"If the voters of any country know that wars fought in foreign fields rarely win or lose elections, the British do; the most stunning election upset in modern British history came in 1945, when soldiers returning from World War II, or awaiting transportation from distant battlefields, combined with restive families at home to boot Winston Churchill and his Conservatives out of office less than three months after he led the country to victory over Nazi Germany.

The Liberal Democrats have been surging since their leader's strong performance in last week's debate; now they've surged into a narrow lead. Thanks to the way the U.K.'s Parliament apportions seats, a Lib Dem victory in the popular vote would leave either Labour or the Tories with a slight plurality in the House of Commons (not coincidentally, electoral reform is a major Lib Dem issue), but well short of the majority required to govern. For political observers, this would be a fascinating outcome: Think Florida in 2000 crossed with a brokered convention. For Britain, misgoverned and indebted and desperate for strong leadership, it would probably be a disaster."

2010-04-21T21:00:16Z,"I am convinced that during bouts of insomnia I have sometimes slept without knowing it. The thoughts of waking seem to mingle with thoughts that may be part of sleep. Has the clock moved too quickly? Did I doze off? Some years ago in a rented house in Vermont, I couldn't sleep and lay awake listening to the sounds of mice in the walls, bears that sounded like owls calling to each other in the woods and the wind in the trees. I then dreamed I was lying awake on the very bed where in fact I was sleeping, but someone had broken into the house. Because the room where I actually was and the room I dreamed were identical, the threshold between waking and sleeping had blurred and, when I woke up, I thought I heard the burglar moving around downstairs. It was a frightening experience, a temporary loss of the boundaries between waking experience and the illusions of dreams."

But Grace Kelly epitomized a time before rebellion was a virtue, and the forthcoming ""Grace Kelly: Style Icon"" exhibition at the Victoria and Albert Museum in London pays homage to the actress-turned-princess's sartorial legacy, from her rise to stardom in the '50s to her untimely death in 1982. ""She certainly didn't see herself as a style leader, liking such conservative clothes,"" says the show¹s curator, Jenny Lister. ""But audiences loved her kind of uncontrived, natural beauty."" Highlights of the show include Kelly's namesake Hermès bag, dresses from her films ""High Society"" and ""Rear Window,"" and items from among the 80 pieces of luggage she carried to Monaco for her wedding to Prince Rainier in 1956. But perhaps more intriguing is what happened in the decades that followed, when Kelly found herself outside her comfort zone  amid all the tiaras and Dior ballgowns are the odd nods to rising hemlines and changing times, like her YSL Mondrian dress. In the end though, says Lister, ""she was always happier in a Chanel suit."""

2010-04-21T12:25:27Z,"""In Jaipur, capital of the desert state of Rajasthan, I spent time with Mohan Bhopa, a local goatherd and bard, who keeps alive a four-thousand-line sacred epic that he, now virtually alone, still knows by heart. Though completely illiterate, Mohan is one of the last hereditary singers of a great Rajasthani medieval poem, the 'Epic of Pabuji.' This six-hundred-year-old text is a fabulous tale of heroism and honor, struggle and loss, and, finally, martyrdom and vengeance. Over time, it seems to have grown from a local saga about the heroic doings of a raiding chieftain protecting his cattle to the legendary story of a semidivine warrior and incarnate god. When these four thousand courtly lines are recited from beginning to end-which rarely happens these days-it takes no less than five nights of eight-hour, dusk-till-dawn performances to unfold. Mohan's caste of wandering bhopas (shamans and bards) travels from village to village, staging performances. How long this will continue, no one knows ... his ancient recitative art is now threatened by the lure of Bollywood and televised Hindu epics shown in India. While watching one of Mohan's night-long performances, one of the village Brahmans explained that villagers no longer had the attention spans to listen to the whole epic. 'Now that we have TV, our children don't like to listen so much. The younger generation prefers the CD with the main points of the story. It takes only three to four hours maximum.'"""

2010-04-22T14:44:04Z,"""Recently I was re-reading The Lord of the Rings and began to wonder how it might be read fifty years from now, assuming that our scientists are able to extend the human lifespan significantly. Might it not be that Bilbo and Gollum will become more significant figures in the minds of future readers? And might not the Ring itself take on a different aura of meanings? Think of Bilbo, in appearance ""unchanged"" in his eleventy-first year, who nevertheless confesses, 'I am old, Gandalf. I don't look it, but I am beginning to feel it in my heart of hearts. . . Why, I feel all thin, sort of stretched, if you know what I mean: like butter that has been scraped over too much bread. That can't be right.' And think of Gollum, to whom the Ring has given 'unnaturally long life': in the end, 'He hated it and he loved it, as he hated and loved himself.' In the lives of these two characters the One Ring does not appear as a Ring of Power so much as a Ring of Immortality, a ring that gives biological life without the means to enjoy it or profit from it. How many people in the future will identify in a particularly strong way with Bilbo and Gollum in this respect? ... Similarly, what will future generations make of that terrifying epigraph to Eliot's poem The Waste Land, taken from Petronius's Satyricon? The epigraph concerns the Cumaean Sybil, who made the mistake of asking the gods for extraordinarily long life without also asking for youth, so that her body wthered and shrank almost to nothingness.

2010-04-22T04:00:04Z,"The fountain of youth is legendary in myth and history; some scientists and skin-care experts think it still exists, thanks to an enzyme called telomerase. Dr. Gregory Bays Brown of RéVive has created a $1,500 skin cream, Peau Magnifique, containing telomerase. In fact, the 2009 Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine went to three scientists who discovered how chromosomes are protected by the enzyme, and further research could prove telomerase to be a key factor in infinite cell proliferation. No one's promising the death of funerals yet, but hope springs eternal. Here's the CliffsNote: As cells divide, they send copies of themselves to new cells. But that copying process chops off bits of the originals' protective tips. As we age, the tips, known as telomeres, get shorter and shorter till the original cells die, and we do too. Cancer cells, stem cells and some rogue cells produce a substance that blocks the snipping process - telomerase. How it can be deconstructed, harnessed and activated remains to be seen: lab-made telomerase would have to penetrate skin, pass through tissue and cell walls, and hook into chromosomal activity in order to be effective. But RéVive's Brown claims that telomerase can recruit the skin's resting stem cells - which exist in case of injury - to manufacture new skin. So far, there are no major peer-review studies or clinical trials. And animal testing isn't possible since only humans produce it. Nevertheless, the party has definitely begun; in addition to RéVive, Jan Marini's Age Intervention Regeneration Booster and Goldfaden's DNA Telomere Cream boast telomere science. Other beauty products are sure to follow."

2010-04-23T09:30:45Z,"Most beauty stories are about the latest makeup trends. For ""Surreal Reveal,"" the makeup artist Peter Philips and the photographer Richard Burbridge took a decidedly reductive, and ultimately seductive, route. Using photographs by Man Ray as a springboard, Philips, who is Chanel's global creative director of makeup, stripped down the idea of a beauty image to its naked core. He didn't even use foundation on the model's skin. ""After all, great skin is the ultimate luxury,"" he says. But bare doesn't mean you don't use any makeup at all, he stresses. ""When you pare it down to such an extent, every element you do wear has to be perfect - the perfect lipstick, the perfect eyeliner, the perfect nail polish."" For Philips, the new bare lies somewhere between the overdone maquillage of the late '80s and the raw, unkempt look of the early '90s. ""I don't think women today feel the need to be so extreme,"" he says. Working on the shoot, Philips found the contradictions inherent in creating deconstructed beauty images to be both intriguing and modern. ""The iconic, formal poses in the photos are a reference to old fashion photography, and are completely at odds with how we played with the pristine, expensive objects in the shots,"" he says. (It's true that a lot of women might shudder at the idea of drawing on a quilted Chanel bag with eyeliner.) ""I love the fact that you can never see the model's eyes,"" Philips continues. ""Makeup can be a mask that a woman hides behind. I compare it to a woman who overaccessorizes or wears over-the-top fashion - the accessories and clothes almost act as armor."" Whether a woman decides to get away with a mere swipe of mascara or puts on a full face, Philips supports the idea that less can truly be more: ""You can wear the most dramatic red lipstick, but if you wear it with confidence, as if you own it, it will look completely natural."""

Before initiating the Yankees' first triple play in 42 years, Rodriguez may or may not have violated a code in the unwritten rules of baseball. Either way, when he wandered across the pitching mound on his way back to first base, Rodriguez infuriated Oakland starter Dallas Braden and ignited a storm of verbal jousting after the Yankees' 4-2 loss to the Athletics at Oakland Coliseum. The play in question occurred with one out, after Rodriguez had lashed a single to left. The next hitter, Robinson Cano, fouled a pitch down the left-field line, and on his way back to first Rodriguez cut across the diamond and the mound, touching the pitching rubber. Braden barked at Rodriguez, telling him to get off the mound."

2010-04-23T00:00:00Z,"CROWTHER--Paulette Isabel 53, vivacious and devoted mother, sister, daughter, partner and friend, landscape designer and public relations director, passed away at her home in New York on April 5, 2010, in the arms of her loved ones, after a two-year battle with cancer. Born in 1956 to John and Ginette Crowther, Paulette spent her formative years in Montclair, NJ, as the eldest girl and second of seven children. She spent her summers in Westhampton and Rhode Island, where she cultivated her love of nature and passion for the ocean. She graduated from Barnard College in 1978 with a B.A. in English Literature. The artistic and cultural vibrancy of New York City immediately captured her; she lived there the rest of her life. She applied her gifts for language and communication to a career in public relations and graphic design at Rockefeller University, the YWCA and Cardozo Law School. In 1983, Paulette married Carlos Almada, with whom she had three children, Justine, Tristan, and Camille. She nurtured them selflessly, ensuring that they were enriched by fine education, joy and boundless love. They always will be inspired by her kindness, curiosity and lust for life, no matter the circumstance. She enjoyed many wonderful years with her fiance, Bill Wunder, who shared her passions for nature, cooking, music and travel. Her wanderlust led her to many exotic lands, where she indulged her fascination with history, culture and natural beauty. Paulette was diagnosed with advanced cancer in March 2008. Graced with incredible tenacity in the face of extreme adversity, she endured months of arduous treatments while retaining her signature smile, flare and zeal. During the last year of her life, she fulfilled a longtime dream and enrolled in the Master of Science in Landscape Design program at Columbia University. She immersed herself in her projects, often studying into the night, even while working full-time, adhering to a disciplined regimen of exercise, healthful eating and meditation, and never missing a beat as a stellar mother and committed friend. Our lives are and will always be enriched by Paulette's bright light."

He worked for Marshall Field in Chicago before joining the family business, Majestic Specialties, a ladies sportswear company, in New York where he was until the mid 1960's. His work at Majestic was interrupted by a tour with the United States Army where he was stationed in Germany in the early 1950's. After leaving Majestic Specialties, he taught at the Fashion Institute of Technology before moving to Aspen, CO in the mid 1970's where he pursued his love of the American Musical Theatre. Among other pleasures, he created and taught a college accredited course on the subject and was involved in virtually every theater and dance venue in Aspen. He assisted with the formation of the Aspen Community and Institute Committee and participated in the Wheeler Film Series at the Wheeler Opera House where he conducted programs on his most beloved topic ""Fred Astaire."" Bob made a name for himself by pursuing the Astaire legacy. In the early 1990's, he conducted a weekend presentation on Astaire at the Smithsonian Institution in Washington, DC. He is survived by three daughters, Melissa and husband Stephen, Mary Elizabeth, Suzanne and husband William, three grandchildren William Jr., Alexandra and Annie and his son, Robert Jr. Additionally, he is survived by his brother, William and wife Barbara, a niece, Andrea, a nephew, Jeffrey, many cousins and countless friends of all ages whose relationship he cherished.

2010-04-25T00:00:00Z,"Among the clognoscenti, a visit with the Portland, Ore.-based Clogmaster, a k a Cecilia Tidlund, is the stuff of legend. Not only can you custom-design clogs from candy-colored, patent and metallic leathers, you'll also receive a custom fitting -- maybe even a customized dressing-down about your appalling footwear habits. (Silly me, I wore flip-flops.) Tidlund, a native of Sweden and the founder, in 1976, of one of America's first bespoke clog companies, is an orthopedic-wellness militant à la the Soup Nazi. Which is why, when I phoned Tidlund to solicit her (withering, I was certain) take on one of spring's big trends -- the befeathered, begrommeted, open-toed, high-heeled clog (see Miu Miu, below left; Louis Vuitton, below right; and Chanel) -- I was surprised that she wasn't entirely negative. First she reminded me that ''we've seen them before.'' Then she added, ''I'd rather people get into a bad fashion clog than a ballet flat or flip-flop. Flimsy shoes are ruining people's feet. I've seen 12-year-olds with bunions.' HEIDI JULAVITS"

2010-04-25T00:00:00Z,"The pastel spring coat disappeared decades ago, replaced by variations of the between-season trench coat. New this year: trenches with dressmaking details at the shoulder or whimsical sleeveless designs.

2010-04-25T00:00:00Z,"I HAVE a burning question for those clueless, self-absorbed troglodytes who honk their horns in residential neighborhoods. Why, because the person in front of you doesn't move within a millisecond of a green light, do you feel that slamming your jarring, piercing horn does anything other than upset everyone else in the vicinity -- particularly those whose right to the quiet enjoyment of their residential premises is being violated? Last fall, yet another study reported that traffic noise is a health hazard, causing stress and hypertension in people who live near it. A honking horn is not just a noise ordinance violation; it's a direct assault on the health of those exposed to it."

2010-04-25T00:00:00Z,"1 One of a handful of hairstylists known simply by their first names, Guido (Palau) is the coiffeur of choice for fashion-industry titans like Miuccia, Marc, Donatella, Donna and Alber. His calling card: versatility. He can do cool-girl tangles, edgy up-dos or pretty and polished with a flick of his wrists. ''The runway is for testing new ground,'' he says. ''When I do the shows, I strive for a mixture of wearability, humor, fantasy and amazement.'' 2 Like a lot of style-world heavies, he's inspired by the work of the painter John Currin. ''There's something about his art that touches me,'' he says. ''It's not always about making things tasteful. Good taste is boring. It's the things that provoke that excite me.'' Go to gagosian.com. 3 The fashion landscape may shift, but the British-born Palau stays grounded in Prada's black lace-ups. They're $595 at select Prada boutiques. 4 The look he created for Alexander Wang's spring show was inspired by the young Brooke Shields. ''She was the quintessential sporty American girl of the late '80s and early '90s,'' he says. ''There was a wholesomeness to her appearance -- the thick eyebrows, the full, luscious hair. The semi-quiff in the front of her hair was key: it epitomized a certain kind of girl.'' 5 Palau is also the creative consultant for Redken. During the shows, a can of Redken Forceful 23 Super Strength Finishing Spray ($15) is practically an extension of his arm. ''It's not the lightest of sprays,'' he says. ''But it will lock into place even the most extreme styles.'' For at-home use, he recommends spraying some into your hand and then applying it to your hair. Go to redken.com for salons. 6 The stylist sends models like Karen Elson, Agyness Deyn and Raquel Zimmermann to the ''superstar'' colorist Laurie Foley's East Village salon, L'Atelier de Laurie. ''She has a gift for achieving different weights of color,'' he says. ''After all, there is a big difference between a surfer blonde and an Upper East Side blonde.'' Go to latelier delaurie.com. 7 Palau can't live without a Mason Pearson brush and a good tail comb, like this Y. S. Park Pro Series half-moon version, which is $14 at Ray Beauty Supply. Go to raybeauty.com. 8 He chills out to beats by bands like Marina and the Diamonds, Florence and the Machine, and Vampire Weekend, whose new album (above) made its debut atop the charts. Go to vampire weekend.com. 9 Palau likes to fiddle with volume. For a nonchalant, disheveled look, he dampens hair and applies Redken Aerate 08 Bodifying Cream-Mousse ($16) to the sections where he wants a bit of lift. Then he ''rough-dries'' it, ruffling his fingers through the hair as he hits it with a dryer. ''You get natural texture and movement, which is less labored-looking and more modern,'' he says. 10 For models with overworked hair, he recommends a six-month course of Viviscal, a hair-growth product that contains vitamins and marine protein. ''I've known loads of people who have used it, and they've all said it's the only thing that helped regenerate their hair.'' A 30-day supply is $50 at viviscal.com. 11 Whenever he's in Milan, the stylist browses the bookstore at 10 Corso Como. ''I have a voracious appetite for photography and art books,'' he says. ''I absorb and memorize the images in them, and they come out a few seasons -- or even years -- later as hairdos.'' Go to 10corsocomo.com. 12 The less your locks are exposed to heat, the better, so the hairdresser's dryer du jour is the powerful (and fast) Sultra Sophisticate, which is $280 at sephora.com. 13 Even superstylists need a bit of a boost sometimes. According to Palau, Redken's Rootful 06 Root Lifting Spray ($15) helps make hair big but leaves it soft and brushable."

2010-04-25T00:00:00Z,"In Beverly Hills he is referred to simply as Patrick -- a single name that in certain circles can make your eyelashes curl (in a good way). Patrick Foley, you see, is a personal shopper who is thriving at a time when many in the retail business are struggling to stay afloat. Maybe that's because he's on the ground floor of Barneys in Beverly Hills selling a $30 lipstick, rather than on the fourth floor pushing a $5,000 suit. ''People don't feel guilty splurging on makeup,'' says the 42-year-old personal shopper, whose title is resident makeup artist. Beauty enthusiasts see Foley as a guru, and suppliers are well aware of the influence he wields -- so much so that cosmetics companies scramble to get him new products at least a month before they hit the other stores. But like his clients, he is a tough sell, and since he doesn't work for any label, he can cherry-pick from established lines and any number of indie brands. His office/makeup studio (conveniently located near women's shoes) is a Hollywood hot spot. But instead of sitting in the middle of a department store, clients are ushered into his stark white studio, with Carrara marble countertops, professional lighting and complete privacy. ''Especially in Beverly Hills,'' Foley says, ''you don't want to see people with half their face on!'' SUSAN CAMPOS"

He was born on November 21, 1941 in New York City to Townsend B. Martin, a founding owner of the New York Jets, and Georgia Shanton who passed away when he was five years old. His stepmother was Irene R. Martin. Michael was the great-grandson of Henry Phipps, a business partner of Andrew Carnegie. The Phipps' family business continues today as Bessemer Trust. He attended Rumson Country Day, Choate, and Rutgers. After serving in the US Navy, Michael became the Assistant General Manager of the NY Jets. While there, the Jets won the Super Bowl in 1969. In 1974, he was named Vice President and Director of Football Operations of the World Football League. At age 34, Michael became the youngest general manager in professional sports when appointed Vice President and general manager of the NY Cosmos of the North American Soccer League. Under his leadership, the Cosmos won NASL crowns in 1977 and 1980. He was a consultant to international sports marketing companies and founded his own business, SportsMark Inc. in 1990. Owner of Michael T. Martin Racing Stable, Michael served on the board of the NY Thoroughbred Horsemen's Association (President, 1994-1997). Michael devoted time and resources to numerous non-profit organizations including Mote Marine Laboratory, The Ringling College of Art and Design, Lemur Conservation Foundation, The Marine Biological Laboratory/Woods Hole, PBS, Phipps Houses, Old Westbury Gardens, The Big Apple Circus, Very Special Arts, NY Special Olympics, Morris Animal Foundation, National Lighthouse Museum, and Juilliard, Choate, and Pennington schools. Michael is survived by Jean Meyer, his wife of thirty years; brother, Alan of Lawrence, KS; son, Ryan and daughter-in-law Maureen, of Butler, PA; son, Christopher of Aurora, IL; stepdaughter, Kathleen Hunt and son-in-law Peter of Chattanooga, TN.

''The eldest Obama daughter is developing nicely,'' she added before ticking off another batch. A beauty icon herself -- ''I think it's a great mistake!'' -- Huston feels most attractive when she's told she's lovely by ''people who are more intelligent, more beautiful than oneself.'' She is currently filming in Vancouver, British Columbia, with Joseph Gordon-Levitt, Seth Rogen, Bryce Dallas Howard and Anna Kendrick. What beauty advice does Huston wish she'd been given at their age? ''Enjoy life,'' she said. ''Confidence is primary.'' RICHARD BURBRIDGE: During the photo shoot for ''Surreal Reveal'' (Page 46), the lensman Richard Burbridge fretted over his makeup artist, Peter Philips. ''He had gone three straight days with only four hours' sleep, coming from Chanel, Alexander McQueen and a bunch of photo shoots without stopping,'' Burbridge says. But Philips pulled through, and Burbridge showcased the proof: a foundation-free, Man Ray-inspired exploration of minimalism in makeup (with Chanel bags!). Burbridge specializes in lending drama to beauty-centric spreads, and he frequently contributes to Italian Vogue, Allure and V magazines. A New Yorker for the past 10 years, the British-born Burbridge was last spotted in Marrakesh, Morocco, on a family vacation. Imagine the photo albums."

''To see is to believe. Cuba is a mystery for us, so we were very curious as to what people look like, how everything works. We stayed at this kind of homestay, ate what they eat and used what they use. For them, beef is a luxury food. It's very different from any country I'd been to. Especially the cars. One night there was a thundershower, so we just grabbed a car and got in and there were no windows. And I thought, wow, a car with no windows, it's very funny. My friend said he would never think this kind of car would be driving on the road. I loved the coastlines, like the Malecón. Lots of people were on the embankments, just lying there for the sunset. They have nothing to lose, they have nothing to win, they just are lying there to enjoy the breeze and laughing. I recommend people go to Cuba if they are trying to see different lifestyles, or even different cars. But if you are trying to see a fancy city or fancy buildings, then maybe save your money.

2010-04-25T00:00:00Z,"Most beauty stories are about the latest makeup trends. For ''Surreal Reveal,'' the makeup artist Peter Philips and the photographer Richard Burbridge took a decidedly reductive, and ultimately seductive, route. Using photographs by Man Ray as a springboard, Philips, who is Chanel's global creative director of makeup, stripped down the idea of a beauty image to its naked core. He didn't even use foundation on the model's skin. ''After all, great skin is the ultimate luxury,'' he says But bare doesn't mean you don't use any makeup at all, he stresses. ''When you pare it down to such an extent, every element you do wear has to be perfect -- the perfect lipstick, the perfect eyeliner, the perfect nail polish.'' For Philips, the new bare lies somewhere between the overdone maquillage of the late '80s and the raw, unkempt look of the early '90s. ''I don't think women today feel the need to be so extreme,'' he says. Working on the shoot, Philips found the contradictions inherent in creating deconstructed beauty images"

The cause was heart failure, said his son, Arthur E. de Cordova III. Mr. de Cordova was the fourth generation to work as a floor specialist in a family firm that originated as Alfred de Cordova & Co., in 1882. He was later joined by his younger brother, Eustace de Cordova Jr., until de Cordova, Cooper & Co. was purchased by Paine Webber in 1989. In 1914, IBM was listed on the New York Stock Exchange, and assigned to Cyril de Cordova & Brother, who acted as market maker and managed all floor trading activity in the new stock. IBM became a bellwether stock as the company grew in the post WWII economic expansion, and their trading volume on the exchange soared. Mr. de Cordova assumed responsibilities for managing the IBM book from his father Eustace de Cordova in 1968, and remained the IBM floor specialist until 1989. ""Arthur E. de Cordova and his firm were part of the proud history of IBM on the New York Stock Exchange dating back to its listing nearly a hundred years ago,"" said Mike Fay, an IBM spokesman. ""Mr. de Cordova was IBM floor specialist at the NYSE during a period of tremendous growth and achievement for IBM and American business. The IBM company would like to extend our thanks for his years of service and our best wishes to his family and friends."" Arthur Erroll de Cordova was born on July 23, 1934, in New York City. The family were longtime residents of Weston, CT, where they retained a family home until 1972. He attended the Unquowa School, and was graduated from The Lawrenceville School in 1952. He was President of his fraternity, Phi Sigma Kappa, and after earning a Bachelor of Arts degree in psychology from Hobart College in 1956, joined the United States Air Force, completing his service at Ladd Air Force Base in Fairbanks, Alaska. He retired from the Air Force in 1960 with the rank of Captain. He soon joined de Cordova & Co., becoming a member of the New York Stock Exchange in March, 1961. He remained a member for 45 years until the NYSE's public listing in 2006. During his more than 30 years as an active member trading on the exchange, he also served as a NYSE Floor Governor and Director of the NYSE Luncheon Club. He is survived by his wife of more than 33 years, Jerri C. de Cordova, of Casey Key, FL. and Westport, CT, and a son, Arthur E. de Cordova III, of San Francisco, from a previous marriage to Carole Magner. In 2005, Hobart and William Smith Colleges awarded him a Doctor of Humane Letters in recognition of his long and enduring contributions to the school. ""Arthur de Cordova was a valued alumnus who distinguished himself in the world of business and was a thoughtful and attentive graduate who nurtured and cared for his alma mater,"" commented Mark D. Gearan, President of Hobart and William Smith Colleges. ""Despite the rigors of his professional life, he always found time to support Hobart and William Smith and our Board acknowledged his life of consequence by bestowing its highest honor to him - an Honorary Degree presented at Commencement in 2005. At Hobart and William Smith Colleges we prize excellence and Art de Cordova embodied a true Hobart Statesman."" A private service for family members will be held in Del Mar, CA.

The rules of the game were recently dissected by Jason Turbow in his book, ''The Baseball Codes: Beanballs, Sign Stealing, and Bench-Clearing Brawls: The Unwritten Rules of America's Pastime.'' Turbow, who has analyzed the Rodriguez incident for his Web site, thebaseballcodes.com, talked about the intricacies of the game.Q.Among this latest incident, the pop-up in Toronto and the slap against Boston, has Rodriguez become the king of breaking the game's unwritten rules?A.The only guy in A-Rod's class is A.J. Pierzynski - who also makes a habit of crossing over pitcher's mounds. The primary difference between A-Rod and A.J. is that Pierzynski is devious; everything he does on a ball field is calculated.

2010-04-25T00:00:00Z,"Maybe the world is sick of women who try too hard, be it on the red carpet or on ''Jersey Shore.'' A new slacker-beauty standard seems to be emerging, perhaps best exemplified in the quirky photography of Bettina Rheims, the Annie Leibovitz of France. Rheims's work ranges from the official portrait of former President Jacques Chirac to a new $2,000 Taschen erotic art book, ''Rose C'est Paris,'' but her vision of femininity is especially on display in the 2007 mistresspiece ''Heroines.'' Her women are haute without a shard of glacial, natural without falling off the cliff toward grunge, beautiful but profoundly undone. ''I'm not attracted to perfection,'' Rheims says. Hence the choppy anime hair, the makeup that looks like it might have been applied the night before, the attitude suspended between brash and breakable. ''The women you see in magazines are so powerful, so flawless, so retouched,'' she says. Rheims is more interested in capturing the nuanced moment when a woman with strength ''can let go and be fragile, and not be reproved.'' The photographer's own style icon is Patti Smith; in fact, she keeps Robert Mapplethorpe's photo of the rebel rocker in a place of honor in her studio. You can see the look on Smith herself once again these days, as well as on various younger countesses of coolness, including the actress Lou Doillon and her half-sister Charlotte Gainsbourg, the models Tati Cotliar and Kate Moss, the stylist Camille Bidault-Waddington and Sting's musician daughter, Coco Sumner. It also surfaced on the runways, at Marc Jacobs, Proenza Schouler, Burberry Prorsum and Alexander Wang."

2010-04-25T00:00:00Z,"Over the last couple of years, sales of vinyl records increased; the numbers aren't huge, but they sparked a lot of public musing about the format's qualities. Cassette sales, meanwhile, steadily dwindled to a mere 34,000 last year through the retail venues tracked by SoundScan. Considering this not long ago, I concluded that the romance associated with vinyl doesn't apply to its longtime analog rival. I was wrong about that. In looking (and asking) around online, I realize now that there is extensive evidence of ongoing appreciation for the cassette -- or at least the idea of the cassette. Part of what changed my mind was a long essay on the Web site Pitchfork. In that essay, Marc Hogan noted the cassette's stunning fall from prominence (8.6 million sold in 2004), but only as a preamble to declaring that a ''netroots resurgence'' is fueling a cassette ''comeback.'' The essay pointed to examples of indie labels that are now releasing tapes, sometimes exclusively, and noted a variety of aesthetic and cultural rationales for what could certainly be construed as a willfully perverse stance in favor of a format that hardly anybody seemed excited about during its actual heyday. Perhaps because of Pitchfork's distinctly music-crit worldview (''One sound that helped was chillwave a k a glo-fi a k a hypnagogic pop,'' etc.), I wasn't fully convinced. But I was interested."

The possibility now exists that the mystery-rich drama, which dug its tendrils into the Internet as no other show before it, might at last pay off its fans' psychic investment in the show's supernatural cosmology.

You can even combine yoga with a vacation in the Caribbean, but it will cost you: in August, the luxurious Parrot Cay resort in Turks and Caicos has a six-night retreat with classes taught by the ''yoga rock stars'' (in the words of the press release) Rodney Yee and Colleen Saidman. The cost? A cool $6,077. (In August!)"
2010-04-25T00:00:00Z,"One day several years ago, I was reaching the end of my first visit with a patient, J.J., who had come to see me for anxiety and insomnia. He was a salesman for a struggling telecommunications company, and he was having trouble managing the strain on his finances and his family. He was sleeping poorly, and as soon as he opened his eyes in the early morning, the worries began. ''I wake up with a list of things to worry about,'' he said. ''I just go through the list, and it seems to get longer every day.'' A psychiatric interview has a certain rhythm to it. You start by listening to what your patient says for a few minutes, without interrupting, all the while sorting through possible diagnoses. This vast landscape of distress has been mapped into a series of categories in psychiatry's diagnostic manual, DSM-IV. The book breaks down mental suffering into 16 groups of disorders, like mood disorders, anxiety disorders, psychotic disorders, eating disorders and several others. As I listened to J.J. (a nickname that he agreed I could use to protect his privacy), it was clear to me that he had one of the anxiety disorders, but which one? In order to systematically rule in or rule out the disorders, I asked J.J. dozens of questions. ''Do you have panic attacks?'' ''Do you get fearful in crowded situations?'' ''Have you ever experienced a traumatic event that later caused flashbacks or nightmares?''"

Born in Yonkers to Earl and Mary Blanchard Fenelon, raised in Pittsburgh and for years a resident of Bronxville, she had a colorful career. Receiving her BS at Syracuse University in Food Science in 1945, she started work in the test kitchens of General Foods in New York City. There, she developed special flours for cakes, pies and breads. She then became food editor at the Ladies Home Journal, overseeing the publication of the Ladies Home Journal Cookbook in 1963, edited by Carol Truax, In which 75 years of the Journal's food recipes were brought up to date. Ahead of her time as a woman professional, from 1968 until she retired she held a senior management position in the Diamond International Corporation as Communications/Government Relations Specialist (i.e., Lobbyist). Upon her death she was serving as Board Vice-President of her Rockledge Manor Condominium. Her hobbies and interests included ham radio, baseball, opera (attending Wagner festivals throughout the world), needlework, collecting art of the Southwest, and hosting elegant dinner parties. Later, in defiance of her advancing years she became skilled in using the computer for email, creating her own holiday cards, and surfing the web. In personality she was tart, crisp but fun.

A hyperactive former Eagle Scout, Allen will have been up for hours, if he ever went to bed. Whether or not he did is one of the many little mysteries that surround him.

Allen's e-mail tipsheet, Playbook, has become the principal early-morning document for an elite set of political and news-media thrivers and strivers.

My friend Joan Juliet Buck, then the rédactrice en chef of French Vogue -- and what's known in the business as a very good nose -- showed me Mille when I was visiting in Paris and said, ''This would be great for you.'' From the moment I smelled it, it was mine in a way that no other perfume had been since Blue Grass, which my mother firstgave me when I was a child. It's round and floral and warm, with just a hint of spice without being too hippie, and just floral enough without being too sweet. It smells like midnight in the Bois de Boulogne -- sexy and mysterious. I think it creates a mood. It's alluring. It says, I'm interested in life, in olfactory senses as well as visual ones. It says, I'm in the mood for something. It also says, I'm feminine, I'm complete. It stands to exist with my mother's perfume, Shalimar, which haunts me to this day. I even wear it to go to bed: I spray it behind my ears, old style. (Unless I'm wearing pearls.) People really like it. Even when I was a smoker, they told me I smelled good -- which is saying something! When you find yourself in an embrace and someone tells you that you smell good, it's wonderful and unexpected. Mille is rare, hard to find, which I like about it. It means I don't bump into many people who smell like me. AS TOLD TO CHRISTINE MUHLKE"

2010-04-25T00:00:00Z,"The fountain of youth is legendary in myth and history; some scientists and skin-care experts think it still exists, thanks to an enzyme called telomerase. Dr. Gregory Bays Brown of RéVive has created a $1,500 skin cream, Peau Magnifique, containing telomerase. In fact, the 2009 Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine went to three scientists who discovered how chromosomes are protected by the enzyme, and further research could prove telomerase to be a key factor in infinite cell proliferation. No one's promising the death of funerals yet, but hope springs eternal. Here's the CliffsNote: As cells divide, they send copies of themselves to new cells. But that copying process chops off bits of the originals' protective tips. As we age, the tips, known as telomeres, get shorter and shorter till the original cells die, and we do too. Cancer cells, stem cells and some rogue cells produce a substance that blocks the snipping process -- telomerase. How it can be deconstructed, harnessed and activated remains to be seen: lab-made telomerase would have to penetrate skin, pass through tissue and cell walls, and hook into chromosomal activity in order to be effective. But RéVive's Brown claims that telomerase can recruit the skin's resting stem cells -- which exist in case of injury -- to manufacture new skin. So far, there are no major peer-review studies or clinical trials. And animal testing isn't possible since only humans produce it. Nevertheless, the party has definitely begun; in addition to RéVive, Jan Marini's Age Intervention Regeneration Booster and Goldfaden's DNA Telomere Cream boast telomere science. Other beauty products are sure to follow. S.S. FAIR"

2010-04-26T12:45:25Z,"Laugh all you want, but the name ''Design Within Reach'' was never meant to be about affordability. When Rob Forbes founded the high-end modern furniture retailer in 1999, he was throwing open the doors to a realm that was - at least in this country - maddeningly difficult for the average civilian to penetrate without the help of an interior designer. With his new company, Public, he's taking the pain out of acquiring another elusive design object: the stylish, practical city bike, the kind that the Dutch and Danish ride. A longtime urban cyclist himself, Forbes watched as places like New York, San Francisco and even Louisville, Ky., spent the last decade opening bike lanes and encouraging alternative transportation, and yet, he argues, most American bike stores still cater primarily to athletes. ''Bicycle technology here is centered on lightweight performance, so they're not as interested in a customer that wants a kickstand, rack and fenders,'' he says. The Public M (left) is a lightweight update on classic French models from the '60s and '70s, à la ''Jules et Jim.'' And at $600 to $1,200, Public's bikes are more or less within reach. Forbes still believes in living a well-designed life, but this time around he's taking his gospel to the streets. Go to publicbikes.com."

2010-04-26T00:00:00Z,"There is something very elementary that recreational players can do to improve their games in a highly sophisticated way.

Then, lay a club on the ground parallel with your shoulders so that it is pointing in the direction of the target. Before you hit your first ball, it is essential that you use an alignment aid to train your eyes to aim properly. People think this is too simple to be of value, but poor alignment could be the culprit for a third of all the unhappy results in a golfer's average day on the golf course.

Crawford took a series of jobs after high school, including one on an auto parts assembly line, before deciding to enlist in the hopes of finding a way to pay for college. He was so committed to trying to make it in the N.F.L. that he would not even play pickup football at his Marine base because he feared injury.

On the other hand, we don't use that much currency, so I'm not sure what all the fuss is about ... The amount of currency that gets used in the United States is too small for counterfeiting to have any realistic impact on prices; these days, money is created not with the printing press, but in the electronic accounts of banks and the Federal Reserve. But fraud! you will say. Well, sort of. If the stuff isn't distinguishable from real money, then who's defrauded? The people who get the money will be perfectly able to exchange it for real goods and services. What it actually does is transfer a small amount of seignorage revenues from the federal government to the counterfeiters. An anarchocapitalist might argue that this is as it should be - that the federal government's monopoly on currency is illegal. I won't go that far; the counterfeiters are, after all, free-riding on the full faith and trust of the US government. What I will suggest is that the trivial damage done by counterfeiters might not be worth making our national currency a laughingstock."""

2010-04-27T09:30:31Z,"In their nearly 20 years together, the graphic artists Michael Amzalag and Mathias Augustyniak - who go by the name M/M (Paris) - have designed more than 50 typefaces, from an alphabet built from the sliced-up photographs of 26 male models to the inky resin letter forms that spell out ''Medulla'' on the cover of Bjork's 2004 album. Their latest, the Pradalphabet (above), was originally conceived as a temporary five-letter logotype for the house of Miuccia: Prada-M. (The M stands for Milano and M/M.) But the duo's ideographic tendencies got the best of them, and in the end, M/M designed a whole alphabet of ornamented initials, each representing a hazy portrait of the Prada brand. ''It's like looking at a planet from afar,'' says Augustyniak, who along with Amzalag spent up to six hours hand-drawing each letter. ''You can see a continent, but it's impossible to say what's inside.'' Examine the letters closely, however, and you'll spot cleaning implements, Italian phrases, strange machines and a picture of two men standing on a balcony. (''They're inhabitants of the Prada world,'' Amzalag says.) For now, they live in a collector's edition of T-shirts, each silk-screened with a P, R, A, D or M and packaged in a cloth-bound box with a 64-page album describing the project. Other letters are available on demand at Prada stores worldwide."

2010-04-27T00:00:00Z,"An article on Monday about compensation paid to executives of major cultural organizations in New York and some other cities referred incorrectly to pay received recently by executives at the Metropolitan Opera and the Brooklyn Academy of Music. The $1.3 million cited for Peter Gelb, general manager of the opera, reflects his total compensation, including salary, benefits and other allowances; it is not just his salary. The salaries for top executives at the Brooklyn Academy were frozen during its last fiscal year, an academy official said. They did not receive modest raises during that period. A chart accompanying the article included outdated information about the compensation package for Zarin Mehta, the president and executive director of the New York Philharmonic. Mr. Mehta's most recent compensation, for fiscal year 2010, is $807,500, which reflects a 5 percent pay cut taken by senior staff members last September. The $2.67 million figure in the chart was for the fiscal year ending in August 2008 and reflected his salary in addition to eight years of accumulated deferred compensation. The chart also misstated the year for the salary figures given for Timothy Rub, the director of the Philadelphia Museum of Art ($450,00) and George Steel, the general manager and artistic director of New York City Opera ($360,000). They are their current salaries, not their 2008 salaries. (Both worked at other organizations in 2008.)"

2010-04-27T00:00:00Z,"HOLLAENDER--Mary McMahon, born March 12th, 1925 died at her home on Saturday. Mary graduated magna cum laude from Fordham University. She went on to NYU's School of Retailing on a fellowship. By the time she received her master's degree, Macy's had already recruited her. At Macy's she quickly rose through the ranks and went on to have an illustrious career, rising to the level of senior vice president, one of a few women with that title. Mary was often called on to speak and loved to work with young people. Teaching at the Fashion Institute of Technology afforded her a way to mentor. Her interest in business was very broad, which is why she enjoyed her membership in the prestigious Economic Club. Mary laughed easily and had a warm and friendly smile. But those of us who knew her well, knew that her warmth was not a sign of weakness and that she had determination and tenacity in all that she did. Mary traveled extensively for business and developed many lasting relationships. On one business encounter in 1954 she met William Hollaender, another Macy's employee. They married a year later. Mary's home, like herself, were well known. She lived in the first ""Cinderella"" brownstone in Park Slope in Brooklyn, which was part of the beginning of the revitalization of Brooklyn and the Brownstone Revival Movement led by her dear friends the late Evelyn Ortner and her husband Everett. Mary's generosity, affable smile and infectious laugh will be missed.

With the pope's pledge, and the resignation in recent days of three European bishops involved in the sex abuse scandal, it might appear that the church is finally taking responsibility for failing to protect children against molesters for hundreds of years. But the church is not doing everything in its power to help victims. In fact, it is worsening the sins of the past by taking a leading role in preventing abused children from getting the compensation they need to help remedy past abuse."

To watch him against the Atlanta Braves last week - stretching to make a catch, diving to spear a sharp grounder, nimbly executing a flawless slide at the plate - was to see a player who has reinvented himself. Howard, 30, is an elite power hitter for the Philadelphia Phillies, with at least 45 home runs in each of the last four seasons. But he has transformed himself from a one-dimensional slugger into an asset in the field and on the bases, too. It helped earn him a five-year, $125 million extension on Monday from a team that had once been uncertain about how long to keep him."

2010-04-27T00:00:00Z,"An article on Monday about compensation paid to executives of major cultural organizations in New York and some other cities referred incorrectly to pay received recently by executives at the Metropolitan Opera and the Brooklyn Academy of Music. The $1.3 million cited for Peter Gelb, general manager of the opera, reflects his total compensation, including salary, benefits and other allowances; it is not just his salary. The salaries for top executives at the Brooklyn Academy were frozen during its last fiscal year, an academy official said. They did not receive modest raises during that period. A chart accompanying the article included outdated information about the compensation package for Zarin Mehta, the president and executive director of the New York Philharmonic. Mr. Mehta's most recent compensation, for fiscal year 2010, is $807,500, which reflects a 5 percent pay cut taken by senior staff members last September. The $2.67 million figure in the chart was for the fiscal year ending in August 2008 and reflected his salary in addition to eight years of accumulated deferred compensation."

2010-04-28T12:03:37Z,"Clio Barnard's film ""The Arbor"" is hard to categorize. It's a documentary, as it uses the interviews of real people to tell its story of the British playwright Andrea Dunbar (who died in 1990 at age 29) and the difficult relationship she had with her daughter Lorraine. But it's also a narrative feature, because it uses actors to lip-sync the audio of those interviews in highly stylized scenes. Also mixed in is a performance of Ms. Dunbar's play ""The Arbor,"" staged and filmed on the street where she lived in Bradford, England.

That's the question the curators at the Cooper-Hewitt National Design Museum wrestled with for nearly three years as they assembled ''Why Design Now?,'' the museum's fourth National Design Triennial, which opens May 14. Their response, presented through 134 projects from around the world, might be the design equivalent of the Hippocratic oath. Many are high-minded, utilitarian responses to critical problems overseas (cleaner-burning stoves, a land-mine-removal suit) and at home (New York City's new Hoop bike rack, M.I.T.'s prototype for a lightweight electric city car). ''There's room for high-style design, but there also needs to be room for the rest of the world,'' says Matilda McQuaid, the museum's deputy curatorial director. But its definition of socially responsible has room for whimsical conceptualism (Interactive Institute's Energy Aware Clock, above), architectural grandiosity (Foster & Partners' sustainable city of Masdar in Abu Dhabi) and simple beauty (Heath Ceramics tableware). Even Twitter made the cut. ''People say the focus on socially responsible design is just because of the Wall Street crisis and isn't going to survive once things are back to normal,'' McQuaid says. ''I think it's here to stay.''"

The New York-based conceptual artist collaborated with Bernardaud, the French porcelain company, and the Art Production Fund's WOW (Works on Whatever) on a pair of luscious-looking dinner plates that are almost too beautiful to mar with a meal. The plates, which come in an edition of 2,500 in both black and white, are based on photographs of a wall relief that Stingel began in 2008. Fittingly, that project was inspired by the wallpaper in the dining room of his childhood home. Why make tableware? ''I like to eat,'' the artist says. ''And I like to look at my work - two birds, one stone.'' It's not the artist's first excursion into the everyday. In 2004, he famously swathed Grand Central Station's cavernous Vanderbilt Hall in floral carpeting. Impressive, of course. But this is one project he'll be able to dine out on for years. And at $98 each, so will you. Available at worksonwhatever.com and Bernardaud boutiques in New York and Chicago."

2010-04-28T00:00:00Z,"IT'S been 25 years since the New York City Board of Estimate, under Mayor Edward Koch's leadership, approved a plan to reduce the need for putting municipal garbage in landfills by developing facilities to burn it to create energy. At the same time, the city took the first steps toward creating a recycling program. Since then, disposal costs have risen faster than inflation, and the need to find better methods of getting rid of wastes is even greater. That fledgling recycling program evolved into the effective system the city has in place today, but no waste-to-energy plants were ever built. Instead, in 2001, Mayor Rudolph Giuliani closed the city's last remaining landfill, and since then the city has sent every pound of nonrecycled municipally collected trash out of the city -- about 15 percent of it to a waste-to-energy plant in Newark, but most of it to destinations in western Pennsylvania, eastern Ohio, Virginia and South Carolina.

2010-04-29T11:19:19Z,"In the debate over financial reform, the Senate G.O.P. seems to be proceeding the way Democrats and a large swathe of the chattering class wanted them to proceed on health care reform. For most of the way, they've been the party of ""yes, if ..."" rather than the party of no, using the limited powers of the minority to ease the bill in their direction, rather than trying to defeat it outright. As a result, it seems likely that ""FinReg"" will pass with more than a few G.O.P. votes, having been amended in ways that address at least some conservative concerns. You can chalk this compromise up to pure political self-interest - financial reform is much more popular than health care reform and everybody knows it - or to the fact that the ideological stakes are lower on these issues than they were on health care. But either way, the Republicans have behaved extremely ""responsibly"" on the issue, at least as the Beltway consensus defines ""responsible."""

He had lived in Greenwich on and off for nearly 50 years before moving to Florida. He also maintained a summer residence in York, Maine. Mr. Bennett was born in Macon, Georgia on January 17, 1924 to Andrew Jackson Bennett and Mary Eloise Franklin Bennett. He graduated from Yale University in the war-shortened Class of 1945 and served as a U.S Navy Lieutenant (j.g.) on the destroyer U.S.S. Boggs in the Pacific during World War II. He worked in post-war Germany alongside his father who, as Financial Advisor to the U.S. Military Commander of Germany, was the principal administrator of the Deutschemark currency reform that reignited the German economy. On his return from Germany, he earned a Ph.D. in Economics from Harvard University in 1951. Mr. Bennett later moved to Washington, DC where he served in the War Department, the State Department, and the Executive Office of the President, and as the Economist on two Presidential Commissions, including the Fairless Committee on Mutual Security which focused on U.S. - foreign economic policy. In 1955, Mr. Bennett joined the Standard Oil Company (New Jersey) and worked for its successor Exxon Corporation for over 30 years in New York, London, and Houston. From 1975 to 1989, he was Chief Financial Officer, Senior Vice President and a Director of Exxon. During his tenure at Exxon, the Company became well known for its pioneering use of various financial innovations, including bond defeasance, shelf registrations, sale of Company securities by Dutch auction and large-scale repurchases of company shares. He also served as a Director of the Discount Corporation, the Massachusetts Mutual Life Insurance Company, Philips Electronics N.V., Dean Witter Mutual Funds and Tandem Computers, Inc. From 1971 to 1975, Mr. Bennett served at the U.S. Treasury in Washington, DC under Secretaries John Connolly, George Schultz and William Simon. He succeeded Paul Volcker as Undersecretary of the Treasury for Monetary Affairs, serving in that role from 1974 to 1975. His work was instrumental to the implementation of the global movement to currency exchange systems based on floating exchange rates and the dismantling of U.S. controls over international capital flows. He also introduced the use of Dutch auctions in the sale of U.S. Treasury securities (still used today). He was awarded the Alexander Hamilton Medal by Secretary Schulz. He was an active Member of the Council on Foreign Relations, a Trustee of the Committee for Economic Development, and a member of the Bilderburg Group for which he also served as Chairman of the U.S. Friends of Bilderberg. He was a member of the University Club (New York, NY), the Stanwich Club (Greenwich, CT), the Blind Brook Club (Purchase, NY), the John's Island Club (Vero Beach, FL) and the York Harbor Reading Room and York Golf and Tennis Club (York, ME). He was predeceased by his wife of 56 years, Shirley Elizabeth Goodwin of Sunderland, Massachusetts. He is survived by three sons and a daughter, and their spouses: Jackson Goodwin (Win) and Rosanah Bennett of Greenwich, Connecticut; Philip D. and Lisa Bennett of London, England; Hugh F. and Kim Bennett of Winchester, Massachusetts; and Fraser Bennett Beede and Robert Beede of Greenwich, Connecticut, as well as by seven grandchildren. He will be remembered for his devotion to his family, his wonderful sense of humor and his innovative approach to business, economic and monetary issues. He loved to play golf and horseshoes with his family and friends. While working on his personal memoirs, he also published in 2009 a book titled Physics Doesn't Need to be That Difficult.

But he is unlikely to win that support, experts say, a reflection of China's growing role in the Korean Peninsula. Since taking office in 2008, Mr. Lee has wound down his predecessors' ''sunshine policy'' of aid and engagement with the North, heightening Chinese fears of instability and driving the North into China's economic embrace. Ultimately, that could give Beijing greater leverage in determining the fate of the northern half of the Korean Peninsula, a situation that many South Koreans would consider to be a nightmare."

As I've argued before, this is exactly the wrong way to look at the case of Charlie Crist. The Florida governor may be a moderate in some sense, but his real loyalties are to cynicism, self-interest (though this time, I'm pretty sure that he's misjudged where those interests lie), and the persistent pursuit of the budgetary free lunch.  At a time when the country desperately needs politicians who are equipped to make tough choices, Crist's record suggests that he's the last person that anyone - conservative or liberal - should want to see in a position of responsibility in Washington D.C."

A lot of golfers will think nothing of spending $100 to play golf for one day but won't spend $400 on a quality rain suit that might last 10 years and allow them to enjoy 40 more golf rounds when it's raining.

Brown Jr. during the 1990s.Wine on Tap | At Frances, the restaurant in San Francisco's Castro neighborhood getting all the buzz these days, customers pay by the ounce for the wine they drink.

2010-04-30T00:00:00Z,"BENNETT--Jack Franklin, of John's Island, Vero Beach, Florida, died peacefully in Greenwich, Connecticut on April 25, 2010 after a year-long battle with cancer. He had lived in Greenwich on and off for nearly 50 years before moving to Florida. He also maintained a summer residence in York, Maine. Mr. Bennett was born in Macon, Georgia on January 17, 1924 to Andrew Jackson Bennett and Mary Eloise Franklin Bennett. He graduated from Yale University in the war-shortened Class of 1945 and served as a U.S Navy Lieutenant (j.g.) on the destroyer U.S.S. Boggs in the Pacific during World War II. He worked in post-war Germany alongside his father who, as Financial Advisor to the U.S. Military Commander of Germany, was the principal administrator of the Deutschemark currency reform that reignited the German economy. On his return from Germany, he earned a Ph.D. in Economics from Harvard University in 1951. Mr. Bennett later moved to Washington, DC where he served in the War Department, the State Department, and the Executive Office of the President, and as the Economist on two Presidential Commissions, including the Fairless Committee on Mutual Security which focused on U.S. - foreign economic policy. In 1955, Mr. Bennett joined the Standard Oil Company (New Jersey) and worked for its successor Exxon Corporation for over 30 years in New York, London, and Houston. From 1975 to 1989, he was Chief Financial Officer, Senior Vice President and a Director of Exxon. During his tenure at Exxon, the Company became well known for its pioneering use of various financial innovations, including bond defeasance, shelf registrations, sale of Company securities by Dutch auction and large-scale repurchases of company shares. He also served as a Director of the Discount Corporation, the Massachusetts Mutual Life Insurance Company, Philips Electronics N.V., Dean Witter Mutual Funds and Tandem Computers, Inc. From 1971 to 1975, Mr. Bennett served at the U.S. Treasury in Washington, DC under Secretaries John Connolly, George Schultz and William Simon. He succeeded Paul Volcker as Undersecretary of the Treasury for Monetary Affairs, serving in that role from 1974 to 1975. His work was instrumental to the implementation of the global movement to currency exchange systems based on floating exchange rates and the dismantling of U.S. controls over international capital flows. He also introduced the use of Dutch auctions in the sale of U.S. Treasury securities (still used today). He was awarded the Alexander Hamilton Medal by Secretary Schulz. He was an active Member of the Council on Foreign Relations, a Trustee of the Committee for Economic Development, and a member of the Bilderburg Group for which he also served as Chairman of the U.S. Friends of Bilderberg. He was a member of the University Club (New York, NY), the Stanwich Club (Greenwich, CT), the Blind Brook Club (Purchase, NY), the John's Island Club (Vero Beach, FL) and the York Harbor Reading Room and York Golf and Tennis Club (York, ME). He was predeceased by his wife of 56 years, Shirley Elizabeth Goodwin of Sunderland, Massachusetts. He is survived by three sons and a daughter, and their spouses: Jackson Goodwin (Win) and Rosanah Bennett of Greenwich, Connecticut; Philip D. and Lisa Bennett of London, England; Hugh F. and Kim Bennett of Winchester, Massachusetts; and Fraser Bennett Beede and Robert Beede of Greenwich, Connecticut, as well as by seven grandchildren. He will be remembered for his devotion to his family, his wonderful sense of humor and his innovative approach to business, economic and monetary issues. He loved to play golf and horseshoes with his family and friends. While working on his personal memoirs, he also published in 2009 a book titled Physics Doesn't Need to be That Difficult. Funeral services are private. A memorial reception is planned for a future date."

2010-04-30T00:00:00Z,"ARONSON--Herbert R.,husband to Connie for 59 years, father to Gigi and Peter, pop pop to Seth, Alex, Mabel and Maisy, passed away peacefully at his home in Morris, CT, on April 26, 2010. His family is deeply saddened by Herb's death. We share this sadness with his countless business friends, golfing buddies, and the many folks Herb and Connie befriended over the years in NYC, Connecticut, Europe and elsewhere. Herb lived a wonderful, passionate life. Growing up in Philadelphia. A loving family life with Connie, Gigi and Peter in Westchester. His business success in the menswear world in New York City. Building a company with vision and foresight, Herb was a larger-than life presence, mentoring, encouraging, leading. Herbert R. Aronson was born on May 30, 1921, in Burlington, NJ, one of three children for Rebecca and Joseph. He grew up in a modest household, the son of shop owners. Herb ""Reds"" Aronson wasn't much of a student, but he loved playing basketball, starring at Overbrook High School in Philadelphia in the late 1930s. He wore number 13, a number later made famous at Overbrook by a player named Wilt Chamberlain. Herb was a flag-waving member of ""America's Greatest Generation,"" a World War II vet who served in England with the U.S. Army Air Corps as an airplane radio mechanic. After the war, he returned to Philadelphia, attending night school at Penn, working in a shoe store and... playing cards with his buddies. And he met Connie. Never one to tread lightly, at a dinner dance, Herb intentionally spilled a drink on Connie's date to get rid of him, so he could meet Connie. They were married on August 24, 1950 Herb was a travelling salesman at the time, eking out a living. Soon after, the couple moved to New York City, where Herb would make his life's mark in the menswear business, manufacturing and selling ties. Herb worked as a salesman for his father-in-law Joseph Wollman. He was not paid enough, so he set off on his own in the heart of the garment district. He bought into a partnership by borrowing $20,000. Soon, Berkley Cravats Ltd. was flourishing, with Herb as chief stylist, buyer and salesman. With a larger than life presence and a natural ease at making friends, Herb befriended and endeared himself to industry leaders across Europe, buying the finest silks, cottons and woolens. With vision, Herb pushed silk paisley ties, bold stripes and introduced English Rugby shirts to America. He travelled the country selling. Store buyers found it hard to say no to Herb Aronson. Beautiful ties. Sound craftsmanship. A good price. Perhaps a little table pounding. But what really sold the ties was Herb's personality his passion for his business, and the simple fact that store executives, including countless presidents and CEOs, grew to respect and love Herb Aronson. By the early 1970s, Berkley Cravats was booming. But Herb had a problem. His partner didn't work hard enough. Herb arranged to sell the company to Manhattan Industries. Herb's partner got a nice pay-off and a Florida retirement. Herb became president and CEO of a new, larger company built around his original tie company, The Manhattan Accessory Division, manufacturing and selling ties, belts and wallets. Manhattan Shirts was added to the portfolio. So was Perry Ellis. Herb's ties were made of Liberty of London's cotton; Como, Italy's silk; the UK's woven fabrics. As president and CEO of Manhattan Menswear Group and, later, as executive VP of Salant Corp. (after it bought Manhattan Industries), with the help of many colleagues who would become life-long friends, Herb built a multi-million dollar business. But more important than the bottom line was the respect Herb earned because of his dedication, passion and friendship, and his strong desire and willingness to help others. Herb loved to help others. He was a mentor to many executives in the menswear field, quick to make a phone call to help someone get a job. When an employee didn't have money to fly home for a relative's funeral, Herb bought the man a plane ticket. Herb proudly served on the Board of Directors for the Greater New York Councils of Boy Scouts, the Association for the Help of Retarded Children, and the Hampshire House co-op. He is a past president of the Neckwear Association of America Herb helped raise hundreds of thousands of dollars for charities and was honored for this work by the Boy Scouts of America with the Good Scout Award and later with the Silver Beaver Award. The United Jewish Appeal and the Conference of Christians and Jews both gave Herb a Man of the Year Award. He also was honored by the Neckwear Association of America and the Young Men's Association. Despite his hard work, Herb Aronson was a dedicated and loving husband to Connie and father to Gigi and Peter. Herb encouraged and loved Connie's beautiful paintings. They travelled widely, making life-long friends in Europe. He could not have been more proud of his children Gigi, the retail executive, then school teacher, Peter the journalist turned lawyer. Herb supported Gigi and Peter, always offering an ear to listen and a shoulder to lean on. Sometimes his opinions were strong, but this was Herb, never shy about giving the advice he thought best. Herb relished the energy, individuality and success of his grand kids: Seth, the soon-to-be law school graduate; Alex, the Peace Corps volunteer and future law school student; Mabel, the spunky, artistic second grader; and little Maisy, the precocious pre-schooler with Herb's red hair for life. Herb adored Peter's wife, Emily, and Gigi's husband, Chuck, happy that his children had found wonderful mates for life. Herb is also survived by his older sister, Florence, who he loved. Herb left his impact on all of us with his love and enduring passion for life and his will and encouragement for achievement. We will remember his supportive words, his strong embrace, his wonderful smile, his sweet kiss. We will remember his love forever. His memorial service is Sunday, May 2, at 1:30pm at Frank Campbell Funeral Home, 1076 Madison Ave.; Reception follows at the Aronson's NYC home. In lieu of flowers, contributions may be made to the Ronald McDonald House of New York, 405 East 73rd St., New York, NY 10021, in memory of Herb."

2010-04-30T00:00:00Z,"St. Vincent's Hospital in Greenwich Village has declared bankruptcy and is officially closing its doors today. Since four nuns opened it during a cholera epidemic 160 years ago, the hospital has served millions of New Yorkers -- from the passengers of the Titanic to the victims of 9/11. In the days before it closed, I wandered around the hospital, talking to people and drawing pictures. Ambulance drivers gathered around their vehicles outside the hospital's emergency room on Seventh Avenue. ''We all had to submit letters of resignation,'' one said. Another added, ''Someone was hit by a car here yesterday and had to be taken to Bellevue, 30 blocks away.''

Langdon is summoned to the Vatican to help with a deadly situation involving antimatter stolen from the Large Hadron Collider; papal succession; and the Illuminati, ancient pro-science terrorists.

2010-05-02T00:00:00Z,"ANN ARBOR, Mich. -- President Obama on Saturday directly confronted the sharpening political rancor in Washington, on the airwaves and on the Internet, telling the graduating class at the University of Michigan that the country needs a ''basic level of civility in our public discourse.'' As a panoply of protesters shouted outside, many of them carrying signs decrying Mr. Obama as a ''socialist,'' the president told some 8,500 graduates -- and 80,000 family members, professors and others in the audience in Michigan Stadium -- that passions were overheated and that people on all sides of the political debate needed to find ways to listen to one another."
2010-05-02T00:00:00Z,"In their nearly 20 years together, the graphic artists Michael Amzalag and Mathias Augustyniak -- who go by the name M/M (Paris) -- have designed more than 50 typefaces, from an alphabet built from the sliced-up photographs of 26 male models to the inky resin letter forms that spell out ''Medulla'' on the cover of Bjork's 2004 album. Their latest, the Pradalphabet (above), was originally conceived as a temporary five-letter logotype for the house of Miuccia: Prada-M. (The M stands for Milano and M/M.) But the duo's ideographic tendencies got the best of them, and in the end, M/M designed a whole alphabet of ornamented initials, each representing a hazy portrait of the Prada brand. ''It's like looking at a planet from afar,'' says Amzalag, who along with Augustyniak spent up to six hours hand-drawing each letter. ''You can see a continent, but it's impossible to say what's inside.'' Examine the letters closely, however, and you'll spot cleaning implements, Italian phrases, strange machines and a picture of two men standing on a balcony. (''They're inhabitants of the Prada world,'' Amzalag says.) For now, they live in a collector's edition of T-shirts, each silk-screened with a P, R, A, D or M and packaged in a cloth-bound box with a 64-page album describing the project. Other letters are available on demand at Prada stores worldwide. JILL SINGER"

2010-05-02T00:00:00Z,"Rudolf Stingel has a lot on his plate these days -- literally. The New York-based conceptual artist collaborated with Bernardaud, the French porcelain company, and the Art Production Fund's WOW (Works on Whatever) on a pair of luscious-looking dinner plates that are almost too beautiful to mar with a meal. The plates, which come in an edition of 2,500 in both black and white, are based on photographs of a wall relief that Stingel began in 2008. Fittingly, that project was inspired by the wallpaper in the dining room of his childhood home. Why make tableware? ''I like to eat,'' the artist says. ''And I like to look at my work -- two birds, one stone.'' It's not the artist's first excursion into the everyday. In 2004, he famously swathed Grand Central Station's cavernous Vanderbilt Hall in floral carpeting. Impressive, of course. But this is one project he'll be able to dine out on for years. And at $98 each, so will you. Available at worksonwhatever.com and Bernardaud boutiques in New York and Chicago. SANDRA BALLENTINE"

This spring he has decided to capitalize on the high prices that top works by Andy Warhol have been bringing by selling one of his many canvases by this Pop master. Painted a year before Warhol's death, this 1986 self-portrait is so spooky, with its gaunt face and spiky hair, that Warhol once said the image actually scared him. Now the canvas, which is nine feet square, is considered historically important. ''Decades from now the most famous images by Warhol will be his Marilyns, his disaster paintings and his self-portraits,'' said Tobias Meyer of Sotheby's."

2010-05-02T00:00:00Z,"What's the point of design these days, anyway? That's the question the curators at the Cooper-Hewitt National Design Museum wrestled with for nearly three years as they assembled ''Why Design Now?,'' the museum's fourth National Design Triennial, which opens May 14. Their response, presented through 134 projects from around the world, might be the design equivalent of the Hippocratic oath. Many are high-minded, utilitarian responses to critical problems overseas (cleaner-burning stoves, a land-mine-removal suit) and at home (New York City's new Hoop bike rack, M.I.T.'s prototype for a lightweight electric city car). ''There's room for high-style design, but there also needs to be room for the rest of the world,'' says Matilda McQuaid, the museum's deputy curatorial director. But its definition of socially responsible has room for whimsical conceptualism (Interactive Institute's Energy Aware Clock, left), architectural grandiosity (Foster & Partners' sustainable city of Masdar in Abu Dhabi) and simple beauty (Heath Ceramics tableware). Even Twitter made the cut. ''People say the focus on socially responsible design is just because of the Wall Street crisis and isn't going to survive once things are back to normal,'' McQuaid says. ''I think it's here to stay.'' JESSE ASHLOCK"

But the company's helmets have been recalled so many times by the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration that the agency has demanded that the company never make another motorcycle helmet.

You're surprised by what happens as it unfolds. You know that someone wrote the book or made the movie. So how can anyone but you be the author of the dream? How can that be you if you don't know what's coming? Do you write the dream, then hide it from yourself, forget it, and then ''sit out front'' and watch it?"

2010-05-02T00:00:00Z,"AFTER opening in November to some of the best reviews of the theater season, the Off Broadway production of ''The Orphans' Home Cycle'' seemed on a fast track for Broadway. Three of New York's most prominent play producers began trying to raise $2.5 million to move the show, even though its length (nine hours, broken into three parts) and lack of star performers made it an iffy investment for commercial Broadway. But the producers thought the show, the final opus of the acclaimed writer Horton Foote, had a good shot at Tony Awards -- which go only to Broadway productions -- and they believed that a wide audience would want to see the work, given the huge demand for tickets at its 160-seat Off Broadway house. Yet ''Orphans'' did not go to Broadway this winter; the obstacle ended up not being money, the show's running time or its cast of no-names. ''We couldn't get the right theater,'' one of its producers, Daryl Roth, said in January when the decision was made. (Her team is now aiming for the fall.) ''Real estate is really difficult to come by on Broadway these days. And it's too bad, because some great shows aren't being seen.''"

He took part, along with an estimated 200 of his classmates, in the state-wide walk-out on Tuesday, April 27, to protest Gov. Christopher J. Christie's school budget cuts. He recounts the moments when the students started to leave their classrooms to gather on the front lawn of the high school, and explains why he chose to walk out. When Columbia Cable Network (CCN) showed a shot of students who had already left school, just shortly after 9 a.m., the image was surreal (as the whole day shortly became). The shot inspired me, and a few friends of mine, to walk out -- after we hesitated at the door for a while."

My husband was a self made man who against all odds - built a successful business, became an international philanthropist, art collector and absolutely loved life. We traveled the world meeting interesting, powerful people and shared a glamorous and beautiful life. But Nathan also lived by the rule that to whom much is given, much is expected. My Husband unselfishly contributed to the organizations and causes he believed in, but it was his everyday quiet acts of kindness that defined Nathan Serota: The veteran who needed a special car, the children he sent to collage and the families whose bills he paid. Oftentimes I would learn about these gifts, many anonymous weeks and years later. For Nat, these were acts of Gratitude for the beautiful life, children and grandchildren - We were blessed with.

2010-05-02T00:00:00Z,"For much of the 20th century, the 133 studios at Carnegie Hall sheltered musicians, artists, dancers, photographers and writers. I arrived in 1950 as a hat designer and an apprentice to the photographer Ray Solowinski (Photo 11). Over the six decades I lived there, this august atmosphere was a constant inspiration -- and often, hilarious fun. It was also a lot like a dorm: most of the studios shared the hall bathrooms. My roommates included Lady Jeanne Campbell and Norman Mailer, who once walked down the stairs naked and scared my milliners. Marilyn Monroe tried on my hats between acting classes. And I often found Katharine Hepburn on the stairs, awaiting her vocal coach. Among my neighbors and highlights: the portrait photographer Editta Sherman (1), who performed ''The Dying Swan'' as a hobby, and raised five children in the building. The opera singer Jeanne Beauvais (2 and 6), who was married in the in-house synagogue. Dr. Michael Zuekal (3), a psychoanalyst. Oliviero Tuscani (4) lost his cameras in a break-in. Mrs. Sherman's fire-damaged studio (5) after workers cooked lunch on the roof. Ms. Sherman, the artist Tom Fogarty and the floral designer Toni Cimino (7).

And the painting itself could not be redder. In the catalog Sotheby's says it belongs to a private collector, but experts familiar with the painting say the seller is David Martinez, the Mexican financier who bought a two-floor apartment in the south building of the Time Warner Center for $54.7 million about five years ago. Before he purchased this painting from L&M Arts, an East Side gallery, it had been up for sale several times before, including at Christie's in 1997, when it brought $1.8 million.

I barely paid attention, since baseball chatter around our house is constant background noise. A few days later, they were talking about it again. One son claimed he and his friends walked past Mr. Bay's house on the way to Hebrew school. But I was still fairly sure this was one of those false rumors that fly around a small community and gather steam as they hit the schools.Then proof arrived, in the form of a tidbit my husband discovered on the Web site of Major League Baseball, which was then picked up by our local online newspaper, The Larchmont Gazette. Mr. Bay had indeed chosen our town over Connecticut - even though apparently all his friends had urged him to move to Greenwich, the ritzier community up north."

Dealers started asking more for their stock, and the auction houses' experts are expecting higher numbers too. This head, conceived of in 1954 and cast a year later, is from the Brody estate and was purchased the year it was cast. Although other examples from this edition have been included in major Giacometti retrospectives worldwide, this sculpture was exhibited just once, in a show at the Museum of Modern Art in 1965. Experts consider the bust the most important among a series of male heads that Giacometti created in the mid-1950s. Depicting his brother Diego, it stands more than two feet high. Besides the bust's large scale, its craggy surface and blade-sharp face make it particularly desirable."

This, to me, is the takeaway statistic in a report issued Tuesday by the National Association for College Admission Counseling. For readers of The Choice, the most valuable information in the report may be the results of a survey asking college admissions officers what criteria they most prize in a transfer applicant. ''The postsecondary grade point average is clearly the most important factor for transfer admission,'' the researchers report."

2010-05-02T00:00:00Z,"A JASPER JOHNS flag is the ultimate trophy for rich American collectors. And what makes this particular ''Flag'' even more desirable is that it comes from the estate of the best-selling novelist Michael Crichton. Mr. Crichton, who died in November 2008, was not only a collector but also a friend of many of the artists whose works he owned, including Mr. Johns, David Hockney, Robert Rauschenberg and Roy Lichtenstein. In 1973 he bought this ''Flag'' directly from Mr. Johns and, until Christie's began showing it, the painting was last seen in public 18 years ago when it was included in a Pop Art survey organized by the Royal Academy of Arts in London. It is a particularly vibrant image, painted in Mr. Johns's signature encaustic, an ancient technique in which pigment is suspended in wax, giving each brush stroke a distinct materiality."

''The Story of Graphic Design'' (Abrams) is actually a book about the history of reading -- a deftly told and well-laid-out survey that begins with the Rosetta Stone and continues chronologically through to the Kindle. With a nod to E. H. Gombrich's landmark ''Story of Art'' (which favored art over history), the author Patrick Cramsie (who along with Bobby Birchall also designed the book) puts a premium on composition and style in his assessment of everything from the Gutenberg Bible and Milton Glaser's Dylan poster to graffiti from Pompeii and British frigate camouflage. Science, superstition, fashion, commerce and politics all get credit for shaping the written word. (See: the signs for the Munich Olympics, which had to overcome the last German-hosted Olympics' stigma as the ''Nazi Games,'' or the First Things First 1964 and 2000 manifestos, which urged designers to prioritize their commissions in terms of societal issues rather than profit margins.)

With her husband and sons Oliver, 7, and Elliott, 6; residences in Beverly Hills and Malibu, Calif.; and a business that takes her from Los Angeles to Anguilla to Paris in the space of a week, her only downtime is in the air. (Not a fan of flying, she travels with her good-luck charm, Franc, the stuffed bear that belonged to her grandmother and mother. She had him re-covered in linen since ''his fur had been loved off,'' and sewed on the buttons from her grandfather's navy blazer to replace his eyes.) When she does escape, she says she likes places ''where I can relax, but also go into a city and be inspired and shop. Otherwise I go stir crazy.'' Paris, London and Buenos Aires are top destinations, as is Miami. ''Believe it or not, there's really great shopping there,'' says Wearstler, who's been collecting vintage clothing since she was 15.

2010-05-02T00:00:00Z,"Laugh all you want, but the name ''Design Within Reach'' was never meant to be about affordability. When Rob Forbes founded the high-end modern furniture retailer in 1999, he was throwing open the doors to a realm that was -- at least in this country -- maddeningly difficult for the average civilian to penetrate without the help of an interior designer. With his new company, Public, he's taking the pain out of acquiring another elusive design object: the stylish, practical city bike, the kind that the Dutch and Danish ride. A longtime urban cyclist himself, Forbes watched as places like New York, San Francisco and even Louisville, Ky., spent the last decade opening bike lanes and encouraging alternative transportation, and yet, he argues, most American bike stores still cater primarily to athletes. ''Bicycle technology here is centered on lightweight performance, so they're not as interested in a customer that wants a kickstand, rack and fenders,'' he says. The Public M (left) is a lightweight update on classic French models from the '60s and '70s, à la ''Jules et Jim.'' And at $600 to $1,200, Public's bikes are more or less within reach.

Jongstra rendered our trademark T in the fuzzy stuff (Page 57), but her practice is about so much more than the final product. In addition to shearing wool, treating it and felting it, she grows plants to make her own organic dyes, including ''madder,'' a red she used for the T. A typical Dutch dye, it's the same one that Vermeer used in his painting ''Girl With the Red Hat.'' ''When you see this color, there's an instant cultural reference,'' Jongstra says."

During the Cold War he flew tactical nuclear weapons missions with the 492nd Squadron of the 48th Fighter Bomber Wing. He received his Masters degree from Harvard Business School in 1963 and while teaching economics at the United States Air Force Academy he began his business career by developing an apartment building with his mother.

Whitney and Co. where he continued to repeatedly distinguish himself. After heading the National Venture Capital Association he went on to have a very successful career as a private investor. Don lived the great American dream but remained unchanged by success. He led by example, preferring that others take his place in the spotlight. Above all, he was a hard working man with an unimpeachable moral character.

In one word, Nat Serota was a man who gave. For over 30 years as a devoted and respected trustee and former Chairman of Daytop, he gave of himself to the legions of young people struggling to overcome addiction. His biography, ""Don't put your dreams on hold"", is not only a saying Nat lived by, but one he embodied. He encouraged our young residents by impressing upon them that they can do anything they wanted to do. ""Make up your mind to do it,"" he would tell them. ""Work at it, and you will succeed. Don't put your dreams on hold!"" Nat's generous financial support was greatly appreciated, but more importantly he gave of his time, love and concern. Doing for others is what made Nat happy and in doing so thousands of lives were changed for the better. Through his own strength of character, determination and keen business acumen, he built a highly regarded and successful real estate company. And upon reaching the pinnacle of success--no matter whether he was in the company of celebrated personalities, potentates, popes or just plain folks, Nat was always the same down to earth, straight talking guy that we all loved. Nat not only talked the talk, but he walked the walk. As Chairman of Daytop, of all the remarkable people he met along the way, it was Pope John Paul who saw in Nat a truly good soul. During a private mass that followed lunch with the Pope, Nat felt compelled to be blessed by John Paul. When the Pope offered Nat communion he reminded the Pope that he was a Jewish, and Pope John Paul, without hesitation replied, ""My Son, so was Jesus"". Nat Serota provided us a singular example of what one determined, talented, charismatic, caring and giving individual can do for the betterment of mankind. And though he has died, his contributions will live on in the lives of countless others whose dreams he so generously fulfilled. Rather than our own death, it is the death of a friend that hurts us. With the passing of Nat Serota, there are untold numbers in every walk of life, who are deeply hurt today. He was just that kind of special of friend."

A collection we all seemed to like was Devin Cole's hand-painted dresses in cotton gauze with asymmetrical braided trim. But we didn't think the style or the tea-stained colors said ''bridal.''"

Expectations are so high that many will be disappointed if Picasso's 1932 painting ''Nu au Plateau de Sculpteur (Nude, Green Leaves and Bust)'' doesn't break the record for a work of art sold at auction when it is offered at Christie's on Tuesday. That sale will kick off two weeks of important spring auctions, and bets are that this seminal painting of Picasso's mistress Marie-Thérèse Walter is poised to eclipse the $104.3 million paid for the current record holder, Giacometti's ''Walking Man I.'' The Giacometti was bought in February by Lily Safra, widow of the banker Edmond J. Safra, at Sotheby's in London."

After all, the very word ''tour'' shares etymological roots with the much-maligned ''tourist,'' and many natives insist that, as far as the five boroughs go, they've seen it all anyway. It doesn't help the standing of tours that the City Council was so miffed about their blaring loudspeakers that on Thursday it voted to require them to use headphones. But city natives should know that not all tours feature noisy buses, and not all focus on the Empire State Building or other obvious sights. The menu of tours in this city, in fact, is as diverse as its population. There are jogging tours, tours conducted by retired city police officers, and tours just for you and your MP3 player.

Some of these scenes underline the difficulties inherent in a counterinsurgency doctrine that mixes lopsided violence with attempts to make nice. But they also simultaneously demonstrate that the efforts to follow the doctrine far from Kabul, out on remote ground, have become a central part of how the war is waged, even as the merits of the doctrine are quietly debated."

The musical version of ""Little Miss Sunshine"" will be presented next year at the La Jolla Playhouse in San Diego, Variety reported [subscription required].

2010-05-03T11:03:51Z,"Recently I discovered a place in San Francisco that is apparently a very well kept secret -- no one that I mentioned it to there had ever heard of it. It's called Wave Organ, and it is one of those phenomena that could only exist in northern California. Originally created in 1986 by the environmental artists Peter Richards and George Gonzales and newly restored, Wave Organ, which is part of the Exploratorium, is a 10-minute walk toward the Marina and out onto a jetty. Approaching the white and gray stone multi-layered structure I felt like I had been transported to a Greek island if not for the amazing view of the Golden Gate Bridge. I stepped out on to the granite and marble stones (which I later learned were donated to the project from an old Gold Rush era cemetery that was demolished to make way for a housing development), tilted my ear onto one of the numerous PVC pipes sticking out of the floor, and began to hear poetically eerie sounds. Each pipe makes a different sound depending on the tide. I then sat in a 3-sided room, listening to the music bounce off of the walls while seagulls dipped in an out of view. It was peaceful and calming and by the time I left, I felt as if I had been on holiday."

2010-05-03T09:30:42Z,"Karl Haendel's breezy, virtuosic powers with a pencil have produced 34 large-scale works on paper that confront the limitations of drawing as a medium. The installation -- a commission for Lever House - pits paper and pencil against the soaring, glass curtain wall of Gordon Bunshaft's modernist icon. But if it's a David and Goliath matchup, then Haendel comes out on top. After all, a modernist glass tower has, relative to its size, a thin skin and these drawings seem to take direct aim at that vulnerability. Cracks - both literal and figurative - are the leitmotif: smashed glass, shattered light bulbs, arresting images of broken eggs, snaking power cables and a gigantic fingerprint fractured into dash marks. Haendel takes pleasure in toying with the conventions of display -- the drawings are hung on two specially built and intentionally unfinished walls -- and his use of tacks and staples is a delightful affront to the works' inherent fragility. Frank, handwritten comments on the walls and on annotated lists of absurd phrases and book titles bring the age of anxiety into focus."

2010-05-03T00:00:00Z,"Some people try to forecast the future. Angus Maddison devoted his life to forecasting the past.

2010-05-03T00:00:00Z,"SEROTA--Nathan. ""The value of a man"", Albert Einstein observed, ""should be seen in what he gives and not in what he is able to receive"". In one word, Nat Serota was a man who gave. For over 30 years as a devoted and respected trustee and former Chairman of Daytop, he gave of himself to the legions of young people struggling to overcome addiction. His biography, ""Don't put your dreams on hold"", is not only a saying Nat lived by, but one he embodied. He encouraged our young residents by impressing upon them that they can do anything they wanted to do. ""Make up your mind to do it,"" he would tell them. ""Work at it, and you will succeed. Don't put your dreams on hold!"" Nat's generous financial support was greatly appreciated, but more importantly he gave of his time, love and concern. Doing for others is what made Nat happy and in doing so thousands of lives were changed for the better. Through his own strength of character, determination and keen business acumen, he built a highly regarded and successful real estate company. And upon reaching the pinnacle of success--no matter whether he was in the company of celebrated personalities, potentates, popes or just plain folks, Nat was always the same down to earth, straight talking guy that we all loved. Nat not only talked the talk, but he walked the walk. As Chairman of Daytop, of all the remarkable people he met along the way, it was Pope John Paul who saw in Nat a truly good soul. During a private mass that followed lunch with the Pope, Nat felt compelled to be blessed by John Paul. When the Pope offered Nat communion he reminded the Pope that he was a Jewish, and Pope John Paul, without hesitation replied, ""My Son, so was Jesus"". Nat Serota provided us a singular example of what one determined, talented, charismatic, caring and giving individual can do for the betterment of mankind. And though he has died, his contributions will live on in the lives of countless others whose dreams he so generously fulfilled. Rather than our own death, it is the death of a friend that hurts us. With the passing of Nat Serota, there are untold numbers in every walk of life, who are deeply hurt today. He was just that kind of special of friend."
2010-05-03T00:00:00Z,"SEROTA--Nathan L. Upon gazing on The Parthenon, The Pyramids, The Taj Mahal and The Great Cathedrals, I have often wondered as to what ""Great Passion"" conceived and actualized such incredible treasures at the outer limits of man's creative spirit. And closer to home, the Indomitable Robert Moses enjoyed my childhood fantasies with near godly powers to hurl great steel wonders across gaping chasms of rushing waters. A Builder, indeed, ranks among Heaven's blessed, pushing back in each generation the perimeters of man's creations. Nat Serota, my friend, is numbered among ""This Tribe""! While Robert Frost in his Mending Wall begged the central question for the Master Builder: ""Before I build a wall, I'd ask to know! What I was walling in or walling out!"", Nat, just a ""City Kid"" who manned the coal chutes and the ice blocks of yesteryear, dreamed this ""Builder's Dream"" of creating wonderlands for the teeming masses emigrating to the wide expanses of suburbia. Bright and Imaginative in design, these bore the ""Serota Stamp"" of inclusiveness and overnight became the great people-gathering places: shopping arcades, theatres, housing, recreation meccas for the young, pleasant setting for the elderly. And all the while, he lent his limitless energies to building ""new tomorrow's"" for the young people of Daytop Village for over a quarter century-his quintessential building mission. Heaven has a special claim upon ""His Tribe."" We have been immensely enriched by his life-and immeasurably diminished by his passing. Our prayerful support for his beloved Vivian and his family.

The Broadway production of the play, which opened last week after transferring from London's West End, collapsed almost as rapidly as its namesake: though its cast included Norbert Leo Butz (""Dirty Rotten Scoundrels,"" ""Speed-the-Plow"") and Gregory Itzin (""24"") as the Enron executives Jeffrey Skilling and Kenneth Lay, as well as Marin Mazzie (""Kiss Me, Kate"") as a composite Enron employee, it was shut out of most major categories.

The Department issued a stop-work order and an Environment Control Board violation this weekend to Elizabeth Houston Associates, the owner of a building on Houston Street near the Bowery on which Mr. Fairey recently installed a mural connected with his show at Deitch Projects in Soho. The mural was pasted onto a structure built on top of the original wall, preserving another mural by the Brazilian brothers known as Os Gemeos. According to Ryan Fitzgibbon, a spokeswoman for the Department of Buildings, the violation was issued for installing the structure and the mural without a permit. She said the Environmental Control Board court would hold a hearing soon on the violation; if it stands, it could carry a penalty of up to $25,000. She added that the Department was also considering issuing a violation for illegal advertising on the grounds that the mural constituted an advertisement for the Deitch Projects show. But Daniel Killinger, a managing director of Goldman Properties, an affiliate of Elizabeth Houston Associates, said that Goldman did not see the mural as an advertisement. ""We see it as a continuation of the history of the art that's always been on that site,"" he said, referring to the Os Gemeos mural and a previous mural designed by Keith Haring. The Department of Building's action was reported by the blog animalnewyork.com."

For an example of what I did have in mind, though, read Kevin Williamson's fine piece on supply-side economics from the last National Review, in which he goes after the panglossian misinterpretation of supply-side theory that's become dogma among too many Republican politicians and activists - namely, that tax cuts generate so much economic growth (and with it, increased government revenue) that they more than pay for themselves. As Williamson notes, the most prominent supply-side theorists themselves don't believe this, but they're tolerant of politicians who do:"
2010-05-04T16:21:26Z,"""How would [the Transportation Security Administration] respond to this weekend's Times Square bomb threat? Well, by extrapolation from its response to the 9/11 attacks and subsequent threats, the policy would be: All vans or SUVs headed into Midtown Manhattan would have to stop and have their contents inspected. If any vehicle seemed for any reason to have escaped inspection, Midtown in its entirety would be evacuated ... A whole new uniformed force - the Times Square Security Administration, or TsSA - would be formed for this purpose ... The restrictions would never be lifted and the TsSA would have permanent life, because the political incentives here work only one way. A politician who supports more open-ended, more thorough, more intrusive, more expensive inspections can never be proven 'wrong.' The absence of attacks shows that his measures have 'worked'; and a new attack shows that inspections must go further still. A politician who wants to limit the inspections can never be proven 'right.' An absence of attacks means that nothing has gone wrong - yet."""

Four months later, Spotanski wrote his bishop a 10-page memo on the abuse crisis, which he read aloud to Gregory in the bishop's private study. In part, the memo was a blistering attack on the American hierarchy, from Boston's Bernard Law on down, for their dreadful negligence, cover-ups and excuse-making. In part, it was a blueprint for action: To have any chance of restoring their credibility, Spotanski wrote, the American bishops needed to invite victims from decades past to come forward and act swiftly on their claims, adopt strict nationwide standards for handling new allegations of sex abuse, and then turn over as much responsibility as possible for implementing the rules to an independent board of laypeople (and parents), who could issue annual reports and hold recalcitrant bishops' feet to the fire."

It does not state that the owner of a rig or a vessel is automatically responsible for the costs.

My husband was a self made man who against all odds-built a successful business, became an international philanthropist, art collector and absolutely loved life. We traveled the world meeting interesting, powerful people and shared a glamorous and beautiful life. But Nathan also lived by the rule that to whom much is given, much is expected. My husband unselfishly contributed to the organizations and causes he believed in, but it was his everyday quiet acts of kindness that defined Nathan Serota: The veteran who needed a special car, the children he sent to college and the families whose bills he paid. Oftentimes I would learn about these gifts, many anonymous weeks and years later. For Nat, these were acts of gratitude for the beautiful life, children and grandchildren we were blessed with. My darling Nat, we had hard times and good times but through it all we had love. With love, Vivian"

Kitty first gave us the gift of her caring 70 years ago when she graduated from The Mount Sinai Hospital School of Nursing and went on to serve overseas as a volunteer nurse with Mount Sinai in WWII. Following her service, Kitty worked as a Nursing Supervisor at the Hospital. After leaving her nursing post, she and her husband, the late Henry J. Gaisman, continued to partner with Mount Sinai in many ways, offering wisdom, leadership, and philanthropic support through the Catherine and Henry J. Gaisman Foundation. She had a permanent and incalculable influence in shaping the very nature and character of our medical center and will be linked in perpetuity to programs that bear the Gaisman name, including the Gaisman Medical Intensive Care Unit, the Catherine Gaisman Professorship in Medical Ethics, the Gaisman Frontiers of Biomedical Sciences Research Awards Program, the Gaisman Fellowship in Respiratory Research, and the Catherine and Henry J. Gaisman Division of Pulmonary, Critical Care, and Sleep Medicine. Always committed to patient care, Kitty created the Applause-O-Gram Program, which honors employees for their exceptional service and compassion for patients and their families. Through the establishment of the Dr. Alvin S. Teirstein Auditorium, her support has greatly enriched the educational experience of our medical students. The Catherine and Henry J. Gaisman Foundation's most recent generous gifts have seeded our advancement of biomedical informatics and an institution-wide electronic medical record system. Kitty bestowed a vast legacy of extraordinary contributions to Mount Sinai and her generosity and devotion will leave an indelible mark on our institution. We will miss her deeply.

Born in Boston in 1943, the youngest of five children, he graduated from The Governor's Academy in 1962 and Bowdoin College in 1966 and was a three-sport varsity athlete at both schools. He attended the Harvard Business School's Executive Education General Management Program in 1985. John began his career at First National City Bank in New York, and held positions at Chemical Bank, AIG, and other firms during his 30-year career in finance before launching a second career in executive search at DHR International, Inc., where he was Executive Vice President. During his tenure at Chemical Bank, he built and led the Bank's first designated Leveraged Buyout Group, and was a founder of its Mergers and Acquisitions Department, where he served as a Managing Director. During this time, he oversaw a number of important transactions, including financings for Revlon, Inc., Hanson Industries PLC, and Wang Industries. In addition to these responsibilities, he also served as a Director of the Allis Chalmers Corporation and Secretary to Chemical Bank's Midtown Advisory Board of Directors. It was also at Chemical Bank where he met his wife, Anne Adler Tarbell. They were married in 1990. In addition to his professional accomplishments, John was a life-long athlete. He was an avid runner and could often be found logging miles in Central Park. His daily running habit remained an unbroken streak for more than 26 years. John also played for the Old Blue Rugby Football Club (RFC) in his early years in New York and later coached and captained the Columbia Business School RFC. He earned a Black Belt in Tae Kwon Do at age 59. For all these successes, John was happiest in his private family life. He was a devoted husband to Anne, and a loving father to his daughter, Elizabeth Weatherbee Tarbell. In addition to his wife and daughter, he is survived by three sisters, Mary Ann MacLennan of Edina, MN, his twin sister Merideth DeLamarter of Concord, MA, and Joyce Morgan of Darien, CT, as well as a close circle of relatives including a brother-in-law, Douglas Adler of Washington, DC, and his family, and a sister-in-law, Mary Malhotra of New York City, and her family, and 17 nieces and nephews.

(He said the spill ''isn't the end of the Gulf of Mexico,'' but also said that ''we've always got to ask ourselves how long can we keep heaping these insults on the gulf and having it bounce back.'') The article described the Gulf of Mexico Foundation simply as a conservation group. It should have included more information about the organization, a nonprofit group that says its mission is ''to promote and facilitate conservation of the health and productivity of the Gulf of Mexico and its resources'' through research and other programs. While the group says the majority of its funding comes from federal and state grants, it also receives some money from the oil industry and other business interests in the gulf, and includes industry executives on its board."

The company archives - from a coffee maker to candlesticks - now reside at the Yale University Museum of Art. Kaufman - who with his wife and business partner, Taffy Dahl, founded Donald Kaufman Color in the '70s - has long been the go-to guy for architects and decorators looking for that elusive shade of not-quite-gray-not-quite-white or flaming red. Take a tour of Philip Johnson's Glass House or grab a drink at the Julian Schnabel-designed Gramercy Park Hotel and you get the picture. But for four days this week, instead of making other people look good, Swid and Kaufman will bask in the spotlight as artists in their own right, when they show their personal work at Gallery 9E in Chelsea. Unsurprisingly, Kaufman - whose work has been in museums like the Whitney and the Hirshhorn, but who hasn't had an exhibition in over 30 years - is a painter. His series of gouaches on paper, he says, are inspired by architectural color samples. And true to form, Swid is more object-oriented, layering pieces of old books, cellophane, legal files and other found materials into three-dimensional reliefs."

Kennedy. (Even President George W. Bush complained of feeling scruffy alongside him.) Mr. de Mello's career took him to Swaziland, Cambodia, Bosnia and East Timor, where he earned praise for his hands-on work inside nations in crisis. In 2003, shortly after the United States invasion of Iraq, he agreed to serve as the special representative to that country for Kofi Annan, then secretary general of the United Nations. This documentary from Greg Barker, based on the biography ''Sergio: One Man's Fight to Save the World'' by Samantha Power, tells the story of the Al Qaeda truck bombing of the United Nations headquarters in Baghdad on Aug. 19, 2003, that killed 22, including Mr. de Mello. 8 P.M.

Toy Pioneer Jack Friedman, who made his mark over his 50 year career with some of the most iconic playthings of our time, has died at the age of 70. Friedman, of Thousand Oaks, CA and originally from Queens, NY, was founder and Chairman for leading toymaker JAKKS Pacific, and founder of video game company THQ, Inc. Friedman launched some of the most successful toys in history, including the first movie toys for E.T.: The Extra-Terrestrial, Michael Jackson dolls, wrestling action figures, Pac-Man plug it in and play TV Games and an array of innovative products for millions of children. Friedman died on Monday, May 3, 2010 from complications caused by a rare blood disease. He is survived by his wife Karen Friedman, and his children Brooke Porter and her husband Tom, and Tony Friedman, and his step children Shannon and Andrew Farrell. JAKKS CEO Stephen Berman said, ""Jack was a legendary toymaker and a real titan in our industry. He dedicated his talents to JAKKS Pacific for 15 years, and he will be sorely missed."" JAKKS Board of Directors said, ""We are greatly saddened by the passing of Jack Friedman. He was a visionary leader who guided the Company with wisdom and keen judgment. Toys were his passion, and his legacy will live on in JAKKS Pacific."" Friedman founded JAKKS Pacific in January 1995, and he served as its Chairman and Chief Executive Officer through March 31, 2010. Under his leadership, JAKKS has grown into a Top 5 US publicly traded diversified toy company. Before JAKKS, he led LJN Toys until its sale to MCA in 1985, and then went on to form THQ, Inc. in 1989 and led it until 1995. Friedman was a generous philanthropist and supporter of the Company's JAKKS Cares program, which has benefited organizations such as The Toy Industry Foundation, Camp Ronald McDonald for Good Times, The Special Olympics, Feed the Children, Boys & Girls Clubs of America, Marine Toys for Tots and more. Under the program, the Company has donated over $40 million worth of toys and school supplies to children around the world. Friedman was a proud yo-yo champion and avid golfer, and recently retired from his regular duties at JAKKS Pacific to spend more time with his family. The funeral will be held at the Forest Lawn South Mortuary in Davie Florida on Friday, May 7th and there will be a Memorial Service at the Malibu Jewish Center on Thursday, May 13th.

The tastiest morsels: the celebrated painter Juan Antonio (Javier Bardem, whom Ms. Dargis calls a national treasure) and Maria Elena (Penélope Cruz, above left, with Mr. Bardem and Ms. Johansson), his unstable former wife. The film is ''bathed in light so lusciously golden and honeyed that you might be tempted to lick the screen,'' Ms. Dargis said.

Mr. Douglas said he was deeply concerned that an item in Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger's proposed budget could limit the agency's access to state legal services. The commission, based in San Francisco, is one of the nation's most powerful - and litigious - land-use authorities.When Is a Bay Not a Bay? | A major development proposed in Redwood City is, depending on whom you ask, either on the shore of San Francisco Bay - or actually in the bay itself.

A reader pointed out the error in an e-mail message the day the article was published; this correction was delayed because of repeated, but unsuccessful, efforts to contact the surviving relatives to learn the surname."

2010-05-09T00:00:00Z,"The Hall of Famer Dave Winfield, 58, is an executive vice president and senior adviser for the San Diego Padres and an analyst for ''Baseball Tonight'' on ESPN. Winfield played for six teams, including the Padres and the Yankees, during a 22-year career in which he won a World Series with the 1992 Toronto Blue Jays. He is also spokesman for Ask.com, whose Answers for the Cure program benefits Susan G. Komen for the Cure, an organization that raises money for breast cancer. To honor his mother, Arline, who died of breast cancer, Winfield is encouraging people to download a special baseball-themed search page at Ask.com/forthecure.Q.Many major league players use pink bats and wear pink wrist bands and ribbons for Mother's Day to raise awareness about breast cancer. How important is it to spread this message?A.It's extremely important, and we need to get tested early; that can make all the difference. My mother passed away in 1988, and the cancer was detected in 1987. I was playing with the Yankees at that time and we had just finished playing the Twins in Minnesota and she said she was going to the doctor because she felt a lump in her breast and she was going to get it checked out. Even with the sizable resources and connections I had, there wasn't enough time to catch it.Q.How do you feel about players associated with steroids in terms of Hall of Fame enshrinement?A.Truth be told, these guys took a calculated risk to improve their performance, to get a contract, to win awards, and to be considered one of the best in the game by maximizing their performance. But the Hall of Fame? I don't think they belong; I don't think they deserve it. They walked away with a lot of money, a lot of awards and a lot of broken records, which they will keep, but they took a different path than the path I think guys should have taken who played the game.Q.What is the highlight of your baseball career?A.Winning the World Series in Toronto. Growing up, we would play baseball and every practice would end with the same scenario: I'm up at the plate, there's men on base and the World Series is on the line and bam, you get that hit and win it all. It took me almost 20 years in the game to achieve that reality. You achieve something great, you become an immortal, and that's something that can never be taken away from you.Q.Any regrets in baseball?A.On a serious note, I wish that George Steinbrenner and I had a different and more friendly relationship when I played in New York because it made it tougher than it needed to be. I spoke to George extensively a couple of years ago, before his health became an issue, and all of the bad stuff is behind us. You don't want to see anyone in ill health, but I'm glad we settled our issues some time ago. On a fun note, I regret the fact that I never had a chance to pitch in the major leagues. I was a pitcher in college, but I never even got a chance to mop up in the pros. I would have loved to kick that leg up high and pull a Juan Marichal on somebody, or if some batter was digging in to much at the plate, to pull a Bob Gibson and hit somebody in the ribs and say, ''What, what, what are you going to do?''Q.Derek Jeter idolized you as a young player. What does that mean to you?A.It means a great deal. I found out that I was his idol growing up shortly after he made it to the major leagues. To hear that from a young player is great, even greater now that he has become the Yankee captain, a legend who is the team's all-time hits leader. It's a good thing, believe me.Q.Where would Dave Winfield, in his prime, fit in on the current Yankees?A.Who plays right field? They would have to play somewhere else, I guess. Oh, Swish, my man Nick. I'm sorry, but he'll be all right.Q.Why did you elect to go into the Hall of Fame as a Padre instead of a Yankee?A.It was a tough decision, but in the end, the Padres were the team that drafted me right out of college and allowed me to play major league baseball without going to the minor leagues, and I accomplished a lot of good things. How can I not say I was a part of the great Yankee organization? You can only choose one hat, and I went with the team that took me to the dance.Q.Are you concerned with the fact that fewer African-Americans are playing baseball?A.Yes, I am, and we need to do something to stem the tide and turn the situation around. I have a seminar I teach about the problems that African-Americans now have playing baseball in urban areas. One problem is that it costs a lot of money to play nowadays in urban areas. When I was growing up, America was different. Back then, African-Americans weren't that interested in sports other than baseball. Now there's a lot of competition from football and basketball and even the X Games. In the end, I think it's up to each individual community to take the necessary steps to see that the sport is alive and well and available to everyone in every community."

2010-05-09T00:00:00Z,"Before a world championship match, players spend months looking at their opponent's games and studying opening systems, often with the aid of computers and databases. They also hire trainers, who are called seconds, to help. It is a time- and labor-intensive process. That is one of the reasons that fans look forward to the matches. They want to see what the players will do and what new ideas they have discovered, particularly in the openings."

2010-05-09T00:00:00Z,"The annual Frederick Law Olmsted Awards Luncheon, hosted by the Women's Committee of the Central Park Conservancy, took place May 5 in the Conservatory Garden at Fifth Avenue and 105th Street. For three hours, the splendor of an earlier age was captured by the 1,200 guests in flowery millinery and spring-summer clothes. Sure, the style of dress is an anachronism, but what a beautiful spectacle! The elaborate hats are not a trend; they are worn in a spirit of fun and celebration. The event raised $2.4 million and honored Patsy and Jeff Tarr (in Picture 2, with Gillian Miniter, left, the committee's president) and Betsy Messerschmitt. The lunch, in its 28th year, evolved after Elizabeth Barlow Rogers (1) founded the conservancy in 1980; the committee was established two years later. This year, the early April heat caused the garden to bloom 14 days early, so the print dresses and overloaded hats stood in for the missing flowers. But make no mistake about the women under the brims: they are serious. They see to it that every dollar raised goes to restoring and maintaining the park."

2010-05-09T00:00:00Z,"This week, the paint company Benjamin Moore will present its Hue Awards for the best use of color in architecture and interiors, and the lifetime achievement award will go to the New York design team of William Diamond and Anthony Baratta, whose sophisticated, bold, and vividly-colored interiors have been featured in The New York Times Magazine. Although the choice of Diamond Baratta would seem a no-brainer, this is the first time that the award has gone to interior designers; past winners were the architects Steven Holl, Ettore Sottsass, and Ricardo Legorreta. Diamond Baratta is known for custom-designing everything from fabrics to braided rugs, and paint colors are no exception. But in an odd coincidence, the designers have always used Benjamin Moore paint bases. And when they told told the company that they were donating their $5000 prize money to the Center for Special Studies at New York-Presbyterian Hospital, which provides specialized care to people with HIV and AIDS, Benjamin Moore matched Diamond Baratta's donation. Baratta credits Diamond with being the firm's color maven. ''Bill is really the maestro of color selection,'' he said. ''It's like music--you have to have perfect pitch.''

And truth be told, the Art Deco and Robert Mallet-Stevens pieces he coveted were too big for his budget - and too polite in scale for the former French Socialist Party Headquarters that he now calls his home and office. ''Like a typical American, I over-sized everything,'' says Owens, a Los Angeles transplant. And he's not kidding. ''Pavane for a Dead Princess,'' the first U.S. exhibition of his furniture designs, opens this weekend at Jeanne Greenberg Rohatyn's Salon 94 and includes a bed, modeled on his own, in alabaster and marble, and a matching daybed. Combined weight: two tons. As of Tuesday afternoon, Owens had yet to see the bed assembled and was busy trawling for nuts and bolts that his team of Parisian sculptors assumed they could pick up upon arrival in New York. Never mind how the furniture was going to make it up the stairs. ''I think I was inspired by the space,'' Owens said of Rohatyn's Upper Eastside gallery, which is in her townhouse.

2010-05-09T00:00:00Z,"PLAYWRIGHTS justly lament the incredible shrinking of the American theater. As the costs of producing have risen over the last few decades, the plays being regularly produced have been getting smaller and smaller. A cast of five actors now seems deluxe at an Off Broadway theater, and stories are rife of literary managers and dramaturges gently suggesting to playwrights that their work might be more marketable if they could airbrush out a few more characters. But the truism that less is more is as viable an argument in theater as it is in other aesthetic realms. Strictly speaking, all that is required to create a potent dramatic event is two characters. Put a pair onstage, and you automatically have a relationship, and from the complicated ways in which two people relate to each other can grow myriad dramatic developments. The people up there will connect or they will conflict, and the result will be any of a number of compelling possibilities: betrayal, conciliation, destruction, erotic attraction."

2010-05-09T00:00:00Z,"Neanderthals and modern humans were neighbors way back when. But was there more to their relationship? Apparently so. Scientists reconstructing the genome of Neanderthals say the species most likely had a dalliance or two in the Middle East 60,000 to 100,000 years ago. A result: 1 percent to 4 percent of the genome of non-Africans today is derived from Neanderthals, say scientists at the Max Planck Institute for Evolutionary Anthropology in Leipzig, Germany. Some scientists question whether there is enough archaeological evidence yet to support the idea, but Svante Paabo, a biologist who led the effort, is convinced: ''Those of us who live outside Africa carry a little Neanderthal DNA in us,'' he said. Good to know. It remains to be seen whether truth will rob a favored putdown of its sting. Perhaps it will become fashionable to be, in some infinitesimal measure, a caveman."

2010-05-09T00:00:00Z,"SNORKELING WITH A HUMPBACK MOTHER AND CALF IN THE SILVER BANK SANCTUARY, OFF THE DOMINICAN REPUBLIC, APRIL 5, 2010 Thornton Kirby, 45, president of the South Carolina Hospital Association in Columbia, S.C. ''I grew up wanting to be a marine biologist but eventually realized you didn't get to play with dolphins and whales every day, so I ended up going in a different direction. I finally got to be in the water with whales during the week I spent on the boat of a company called the Aggressor Fleet. Silver Bank is very shallow and safe, so it's a good place for whales to bring newborn calves and let them grow for several months before they have to go back to the Arctic. If you find a mother whale that's not troubled by having snorkelers there, you have an incredible encounter. It's almost as if the calf wants an audience: it begins rolling around on its side and flapping its pectoral fins, slapping its tail and doing flips and turns -- just entirely playful behavior. Once you realize you're safe and they're not going to harm you in any way, you're completely impressed by the complexity of their relationship, and how she is nurturing and raising this calf to be prepared for a huge journey.'' As told to Seth Kugel"

2010-05-09T00:00:00Z,"Given the speed with which Hong Kong's colonial buildings have been torn down, it's fortunate that the old British marine police headquarters survived at all. The 19th-century white-stucco structure had been neglected for more than a decade. Most visitors to the bustling Tsim Sha Tsui area probably did not notice its elegant curving staircase entrance, set back from the neon and noise of Salisbury Road. Late last year the complex, known as 1881 Heritage (1881heritage.com), began reopening in stages, first with a few luxury shops. The main building, Hullett House (hulletthouse.com) now has a number of restaurants, a bar and a boutique hotel that opened last month. Perhaps most impressively, the renovation has been done with care. The site is not a museum, but it is true to its architectural and historical past. The Moreton Bay fig trees in the garden were first brought to the former colony by visiting seamen. Details in Hullett House, like floor boards and door frames, have been retained from the original structure. Stables Grill CQ is situated in a space where, indeed, horses were once kept. As a reminder of the darker elements of the city's colonial past, jail cells make up part of the interior of the Mariner's Rest bar. More pleasant is the veranda of The Parlour, where you can have a champagne brunch on the weekends."

The festival, which takes place April 30 to May 3, is located at the Villa Noailles, a former modernist residence that has since become a venue for cultural events. Each year ten up-and-coming photographers exhibit their work to the public and an esteemed jury of media professionals. This year's highlights include Carlo van de Roer's ethereal Polaroid portraits, James Reeve's nocturnal cityscapes, and Yann Gross's Ugandan skateboarder series. Hyeres 2010 will also feature a Walter Pfeiffer retrospective and a new video by Steven Klein depicting his fashion photography from the past ten years. Klein's highly structured, subversive images are a good counterbalance to Pfeiffer's more jocular, candid photos. In case you can't make the festival this weekend, the exhibitions run until May 30.

2010-05-09T00:00:00Z,"ALL-NIGHTERS By the time I was 14 and a half, my brother had his driver's license and he reluctantly agreed to drive me to my 5 a.m. swim practices. Clarkson pool was a 15-minute drive west along Lakeshore Boulevard. He'd stomp, annoyed and grouchy, down to the kitchen, pajamas sticking out the bottoms of his jeans, and grab the keys to the station wagon. Backing out of the driveway he'd put on a tape, which, in my memory, was always Billy Bragg's ''Talking With the Taxman About Poetry.'' The car warmed and my brother turned up the volume. Music made the dark morning drive feel like a movie. We wouldn't talk; we would just listen to the lyrics, to the guitar loud, plangent, and watch Mississauga landmarks pass. An amputated lighthouse, the corn starch factory. The funeral home where we once stared into our next-door neighbor's open casket, Port Credit marina, Pizza Pizza. I longed to say something to him as a friend, an equal, to dissolve the feeling that I was a child needing a drive, but couldn't think of what that would be."

Throughout her adult life, she was a champion and partner to many charities, in health care, education, the arts, and both the Catholic and Jewish faiths. Kitty, as many affectionately knew her, was a passionate gourmet cook. She hosted many dinners at her home that would rival the best restaurants. She loved her dogs, vegetable garden, her home, and all her family and friends. Holidays were particularly important family times for Kitty; she was the center point around whom all would gather.

2010-05-09T00:00:00Z,"Even before the recent oil spill, the Gulf of Mexico was hardly pristine. The Gulf, like almost all large bodies of water, must balance industry and recreation, fishing and development. It provides up to one-third of the country's commercial fishing and shellfish -- along with 27 percent of its domestically produced oil and 20 percent of domestic natural gas. Mexico, too, with its big oil industry and growing population, puts its own stresses on the Gulf. Here are five environmental challenges -- beyond the Deepwater Horizon rig that is spewing thousands of gallons of oil. Erosion - The Gulf of Mexico shoreline is home to more than half the coastal wetlands of the lower 48 states, a habitat for fish and other wildlife and a protective barrier against inland storm damage. In Louisiana, wetlands are wasting away at a rate equivalent to about one football field every 38 minutes. The Mississippi and other rivers that once washed over wetlands, replenishing them with sediment, have been constricted by levees, starving marshes of their main building material. Coastal lands are sinking, a process accelerated by oil and gas drilling. In some areas, the shoreline could move inland by up to 33 miles over the next 30 years."

Many of us -- happily, dreamily, thankfully -- associate our mothers (and motherly love) with a certain recipe. The Op-Ed editors asked five artists to draw and describe the dish they most think of when they think of their mothers. My favorite dish is my mother's baked macaroni and cheese topped with toasted breadcrumbs. Crunchy, smooshy, cheesy and dense -- it's the perfect comfort food for endless Michigan winters. As a kid I would devour the stuff. My mother would always sneak in a few broccoli spears. She would pretend they were actual trees and dare me to eat them, saying, ''I bet you can't eat a tree.''"

Lawyers for Mr. Polanski had hoped to use the testimony, by a retired prosecutor, Roger Gunson, to fight his extradition by authorities in Switzerland. Mr. Gunson's conditional testimony was taken earlier this year, so that it could be used if he were not available to testify in a sentencing hearing, should Mr. Polanski be returned to the United States. In denying the request, Los Angeles Superior Court Judge Peter Espinoza said of the Swiss: ""I'm satisfied that they have information that they need."" Mr. Polanski fled the United States in 1978, on the eve of his sentencing for having unlawful sex with a 13-year-old girl. His lawyers have argued that Judge Laurence J. Rittenband, who is now deceased, improperly used Mr. Polanski's psychiatric evaluation in a California prison as his punishment, and that Mr. Gunson's testimony, if provided to the Swiss, would show that Mr. Polanski does not qualify for extradition under a treaty between Switzerland and the United States."

It was an unintended consequence of a system built to place a circuit breaker on stocks in sharp decline. In theory, trades slow down so that sellers can find buyers the old-fashioned way, by hand, one by one. The electronic exchanges did not slow down in tandem, causing problems, according to two officials familiar with the investigation."
2010-05-10T00:00:00Z,"PERKIEL--Frank Efraim, 85, passed away on April 10, 2010. Frank was born and spent his youth in Warsaw, Poland. Upon Nazi Germany's invasion of Poland on September 1, 1939, Frank took up arms in defense of Warsaw against the German army. In the ensuing months following Poland's occupation, Frank remained in Warsaw as a volunteer for the Joint Jewish Distribution Committee. Between 1940 and 1943, Frank lived in the Warsaw Ghetto, active in its Zionist organization, and was secretary of a Jewish Youth Committee, an underground elementary school teacher, and a member of the Jewish resistance smuggling food into and messages in and out of the Ghetto, culminating in his leading the escape of 20 Jews from the Ghetto, following which he secretly lived for a time outside the Ghetto, working with the Polish Jewish underground. In May, 1943, Frank surrendered himself to the Nazi SS to rejoin his father and brother, who remained incarcerated in the Ghetto. After his arrest and deportation, and in the ensuing three years up to his liberation on May 5, 1945 by American invasionary forces from the Mauthausen death camp, Frank miraculously survived eight Nazi labor/concentration camps in Poland, Germany, Czechoslovakia and Austria. Between the end of the war and 1949, Frank lived in US-occupied zones in Austria and Germany, was employed by the UN Relief and Rehabilitation Administration, served the American military in the covert intelligence activities, and headed the Immigration Department of Jewish Agency for Palestine. In April, 1949, Frank and his now-deceased wife, Ella Zlotnik, herself a survivor of Nazi atrocities, immigrated to New York City where he remained and raised his family. He became a successful businessman and in 1966 founded Galaxy Metals Inc. Frank epitomized the human spirits of strength, defiance of evil, survival and hope...his forever enduring legacy.

But there are plenty of rare golf items available on eBay, it just depends what you define as rare. I, for example, did not know I owned a rare golf ball because I saved one of those multicolored Ping balls from the early 1980s. That was when orange and neon yellow golf balls were a popular fad in the golf ball marketplace and Ping went one step further and made balls of various combinations: half orange and half neon yellow, half white and have neon yellow, half white and half pink, half blue and half gold.
