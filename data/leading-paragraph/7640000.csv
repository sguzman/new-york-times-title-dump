Seven days is too short to fly nine hours to some exotic spot. The frustration of getting to and from the airport, plus the jet lag, will lead you to lose hours of true enjoyment. Explore an area close to home, see it with the eyes and enthusiasm of a tourist, and you'll see how many charming venues are just a few miles from the daily grind. You'll save money and aggravation. DAVID DAVIS Highland Park, Tex. To the Editor: Before going on vacation, I always sit down and make a list of all of the issues on my mind, no matter how big or small, from writing a new will to picking up dry cleaning. I think of it as downloading my mental computer. This way, while I'm on vacation, I don't have to worry about taking care of this or that. And when I return, I'm ready to go back to work without worrying that I've forgotten an issue. JACK ADLER Larchmont, N.Y."

In the 1950s, Dr. Grobman was the Director of the Florida State Museum (now the Florida Museum of Natural History) in Gainesville, where he laid foundations for its development into a major university research museum. In 1959, he became the founding director of the Biological Sciences Curriculum Study in Boulder, Colorado, a group developing secondary school biology textbooks promoting the teaching of evolution and lab fieldwork. After a stint as dean of Rutgers College and a vice-chancellorship at the University of Illinois at Chicago, he was selected as chancellor of the University of Missouri-St. Louis, where he oversaw the addition of new schools of nursing and optometry. He has published dozens of educational and scientific articles, many focusing on reptiles, and written several books including ""Our Atomic Heritage,"" ""The Changing Classroom,"" and ""Urban State Universities.""

2012-07-15T00:00:00Z,"10 P.M. (USA) POLITICAL ANIMALS Sigourney Weaver (above, with James Wolk, left, and Brent Jennings), in a role based on Hillary Rodham Clinton, portrays Elaine Barrish Hammond, a former first lady who ran for president and became secretary of state in this new mini-series. She's married to a philandering former president, Bud Hammond (Ciaran Hinds), but in this make-believe version, Elaine doesn't stand by her man -- she divorces him. Carla Gugino is Susan Berg, a journalist who won a Pulitzer Prize for writing about Bud's infidelities, and who has exclusive access to Elaine in exchange for keeping the news about the Hammonds' troubled son, T. J. (Sebastian Stan), quiet. (His twin, Douglas, played by Mr. Wolk, is Elaine's chief of staff.) And Adrian Pasdar is President Paul Garcetti, the charismatic candidate who beat Elaine for the Democratic nomination. ''It may be too soon to assess her place in history, but it is already clear that Mrs. Clinton has a huge hold on the public imagination: a woman so well known, and yet so unknowable, that writers and filmmakers keep turning to fiction to try to solve her mystery,'' Alessandra Stanley wrote in The New York Times. She added: ''Mrs. Clinton's life, with all its political triumphs and private torments, turned out to be juicier than any script a movie or television studio could conjure. And the writers, at least, don't want that to end. 'Can you keep a secret?' Elaine asks a Secret Service agent at her side. 'I'm going to run for president again, and this time I'm going to win.'

2012-07-15T00:00:00Z,"NO one blinks at the sight of a 19th-century painting on modern walls. (Think Edward Hopper at the Whitney Museum.) But hang a contemporary artwork in a 19th-century house -- say, a sculpture made from a garden hose -- and see what kind of weirdness results. That was what the art consultant Mark Fletcher proposed to the eight young artists of the Still House Group, when he offered the Brooklyn-based collective an exhibition in a circa-1840 town house on Washington Square. They returned with ''Here Comes,'' a mixed-media show that confounded even Mr. Fletcher, a champion of young art. ''I was surprised by the level of subtlety in the installation,'' he said. He bought everything in it and opened the apartment (usually private viewing rooms for clients) to the public. The Still House Group is typical of a generation that gives every material, be it Scotch tape or oil paint, equal weight. Their work doesn't supply instant gratification. That may put off some viewers, but if anyone wants to see how the art of our time holds up in an environment built for another, ''Here Comes'' will do the trick. It's mysterious, inexplicable. And that is the attraction. Through July 27; 24 Washington Square North. LINDA YABLONSKY"

So observes the narrator in ''The Cranes Dance,'' Meg Howrey's new novel about an emotionally unhinged soloist in a New York company. Ah, Americans and our fascination with dancers from the great European houses. You could replace ''Russian'' with ''French'' and ''Kirov'' with the ''PARIS OPERA BALLET'' and the sentence would work just as well, no? Especially as New Yorkers are now enjoying a marvelous treat: the Parisians have arrived at the Lincoln Center Festival (which has been on an international ballet kick; last year it was in fact the Kirov). You have one last chance, on Sunday, to catch the program of 20th-century French ballets by Serge Lifar, Roland Petit and Maurice Béjart. Then you have your choice of full-lengths. The (relatively) new is Pina Bausch's dance opera ''Orpheus and Eurydice,'' which was first performed by the Parisians in 2005, and the (very) old is, what else, ''Giselle,'' choreographed by Jean Coralli and Jules Perrot almost two centuries ago for the Paris Opera Ballet.

Recently, a native of the city came up with a novel suggestion: hire pretend zombies to chase around paying customers in a theme park set among abandoned buildings. The zombie theme park, called Z World Detroit, is the brainchild of Marc Siwak, who began a grass-roots campaign on the Indiegogo Web site seeking financing for research to further refine the idea. Inspired partly by zombie movies, the park would take up roughly 200 acres and would involve navigating vacant buildings, homes and open space overnight while avoiding a zombie hoard whose ranks would grow as other paying customers fell prey to the undead and became zombies themselves."

So perhaps a road trip is in order, for the eagerly anticipated ''FAR FROM HEAVEN,'' from the creative team behind ''Grey Gardens.'' The Williamstown Theater Festival is hosting what is being described as a preview production of the musical, based on the Todd Haynes movie that paid luscious homage to the heavy-breathing 1960s melodramas of Douglas Sirk. The score is by the ''Grey Gardens'' team of Scott Frankel and Michael Korie, and Michael Greif once again is directing. Kelli O'Hara plays the central role of the 1950s housewife who finds her orderly life suddenly fraught with peril. ''Far From Heaven'' is already on the docket for the coming season at Playwrights Horizons -- but can die-hard musical-theater lovers really bear to wait?

The three-alarm fire began shortly before 4 p.m. and was concentrated around the pier, according to the police and fire officials. It seemed to be under control by 5 p.m. and there were no immediate reports of injuries, the officials said."

2012-07-15T00:00:00Z,"THE NEW MUSEUM is always at its best in group theme shows, at least if the curator Massimiliano Gioni has anything to do with them. Last summer his show ''Ostalgia,'' a survey of contemporary art from former Soviet-bloc countries, was one of the best exhibitions in the city in 2011. This summer's ''GHOSTS IN THE MACHINE,'' which opens Wednesday and runs through Sept. 30, could have comparable status. Covering a half-century of work by some 70 artists, largely from Europe and the United States, it considers the interrelationship of humans and machines. For the occasion Mr. Gioni and his co-curator, Gary Carrion-Murayari, will give physical form to imaginary devices cooked up by the likes of Kafka and Roussel. They will assemble some of the components of the outsider artist Emery Blagdon's healing environment, originally built on his Nebraska farm. And they will consider the many varieties of optical experience that went into the creation of Op Art. Given the dominance of digital technology today, an exhibition theme that might have sounded science-fictional a few decades ago seems completely reality-based now. 235 Bowery, at Prince Street, Lower East Side, (212) 219-1222, newmuseum.org."

Everyone who met Armar-a wise and caring physician, loyal friend, and generous donor to liberal causes and those in need-could not help being touched by his concern for their own well-being. His generosity, ready laugh and good counsel will be hugely missed. He is survived by sister Lydia (""Witty""), brother Chris and daughter Irit.

2012-07-15T00:00:00Z,"It's one of those secrets you normally don't learn in nursing school: ''Don't go to the hospital in July.'' That's the month when medical residents, newly graduated from medical school, start learning how to be doctors, and they learn by taking care of patients. And learning means making mistakes. There's disagreement in the medical literature about whether a so-called July Effect, where medical error rates increase in the summer, actually exists. But a 2010 article in the Journal of General Internal Medicine and a 2011 article in the Annals of Internal Medicine both found evidence of it. In an interview, Dr. John Q. Young, lead author of the latter review, likened the deployment of new residents to having rookies replace seasoned football players during ''a high-stakes game, and in the middle of that final drive.''"

As the byline on the archived article correctly noted, he was Howard Taubman, not Harold. The article also described incorrectly recording projects pegged to the centennial. EMI has released her complete recordings on that label, not her entire recorded oeuvre. And Decca has released a centenary edition with 14 CDs, not just a new film that explores her life."

2012-07-15T00:00:00Z,"AS my colleague Matthew L. Wald noted on Wednesday, a filling station west of Kansas City, Kan., recently began pumping E15, the fuel blend of 15 percent ethanol and 85 percent gasoline. The formulation was approved for use by the Environmental Protection Agency late in 2010. Though the government cannot compel filling stations to stock the fuel, the Energy Department frames the use of E15 as falling within its broader objective of reducing petroleum imports. (The ethanol is produced primarily from corn grown in the United States.) However, the cost and efficiency benefits for the fuel's end user are not so apparent. As Mr. Wald wrote, ''Some car experts say that the savings are illusory, because a gallon of ethanol has only about two-thirds as much energy as a gallon of gasoline, so it will take a car fewer miles on a gallon.''"

He served from 1965 through 1967 in the Peace Corps as a secondary school teacher in rural Thailand.

2012-07-16T00:00:00Z,"McCALL--James Wilson James Wilson McCall, of Hillsborough, California, on July 13, 2012, after a courageous struggle with cancer. Jim was the beloved husband of Jennifer Jordan McCall; devoted father of Peter Lewis Livingston McCall and Andrew James McCall; stepfather of Caroline Debevoise Clark and Hillary Sage Clark; son of Lewis Livingston McCall, Jr. and Dixann Wilson McCall; and brother of Mary Margaret McCall. Jim was knowledgeable in many subjects from sports, to history, politics, photography, music and Formula 1 racing. Jim was an avid reader, particularly of American history and international relations. Jim was always fun to be with. An entertaining conversationalist, Jim's wit and humor will be deeply missed. His family and friends admired him greatly for his insight and sensitivity, and for his thoughtfulness, modesty and courage. Jim set an example with his intellectual curiosity, dynamic yet gentlemanly manner and high moral character. He was a trusted advisor to many, and a loyal friend. Jim especially enjoyed advising his four children, and was proud that all four of them attended Princeton University. Jim took special pride in his sons and their accomplishments, both in sports and academics. Born in Norman, Oklahoma March 10, 1953, Jim graduated from the University of Oklahoma in 1974 with a B.A. in Letters with Honors, in History, Philosophy and English. Jim completed his undergraduate degree in five semesters, was a member of Phi Beta Kappa and was a Rhodes Scholar nominee from the State of Oklahoma. Jim earned a J.D. from the University of Oklahoma in 1977, where he was a member of the Law Review. In 1974 Jim attended Oxford University as a Scholarship Resident at University College in Economics. Jim earned his M.B.A. in 1984 from Harvard Business School and served as a member of the Faculty Judicial Review Board. Jim's work experience included McKinsey, Goldman Sachs and Security Pacific/Bank of America Venture Capital Group. Jim joined Intel Corporation in Santa Clara, California in 1997 where he remained to the present. He became an Assistant Treasurer for Mergers, Acquisitions & Strategic Investments and Managing Director, Digital Enterprise and Digital Home for Intel Capital Corporation, the venture capital arm of Intel. Jim was a talented athlete and sports enthusiast throughout his life. As a thirteen-year-old, Jim shot even par in a golf tournament; in high school he played football, golf and ran track, holding the State of Oklahoma record for the 220- and 440-yard dash. At the University of Oklahoma Jim played golf and followed professional baseball. Jim's love of golf stayed with him throughout his life. Jim was a member of the San Francisco Golf Club and Burlingame Country Club, San Francisco, the Merion Golf Club, Ardmore, Pennsylvania and The Creek Club, Locust Valley, New York. Jim's family and friends loved to play golf with him, not only because of his entertaining and friendly manner, but also because of his shot-making finesse. Jim gently offered tips to those who requested them, and was always a patient teacher. Jim was keenly devoted to his family and to the memory of his predecessors. Jim was a proud member of The Society of the Cincinnati, whose members are descendants of the Officers who served in General George Washington's Revolutionary Army. He belonged to The Society of Colonial Wars, The General Society Sons of the American Revolution, The Order of St. John of Jerusalem, the General Society of the War of 1812, the Order of Indian Wars of the United States, and the Aztec Club of 1847 Military Society of the Mexican War. Jim's warmth, enthusiasm, and intellect will be greatly missed.

And without fail several hundred birders are there to take in the sight. In this documentary the first-time filmmaker Jeffrey Kimball explores this phenomenon across four years through the stories of those who find joy in creatures ''so alive, active, varied and beautiful,'' says Anya, a 15-year-old birder, who is shown alongside obsessives like Jonathan Franzen, the author of ''Freedom'' (which features a cerulean warbler on its cover), and Starr Saphir, considered the matriarch of Central Park bird-watching. Mr. Kimball also speaks to scientists, who call the concentration of birds there ''the Central Park effect,'' and who, each Christmas season, attempt to count every bird in the park to produce the annual report of birds in decline, which now includes nearly a quarter of all species. (Above, a black-and-white warbler in the program.) In ''The Tsunami and the Cherry Blossom,'' an Oscar-nominated documentary short to be shown at 10, Lucy Walker looks at how cherry-blossom season inspired some survivors of the 2011 tsunami in Japan to rebuild their lives. ''Each flower is tiny, and you can't see one individually,'' a man says, explaining how the cherry blossom reflects the national character. ''But it's beautiful when you see lots of flowers together. Japanese people see themselves that way too.'' 2 P.M.

Often regaling his children with Runyonesque tales of his West Side childhood, he witnessed the building of the George Washington Bridge and he played street baseball with neighborhood boys. Babe Ruth tossed an occasional ball with them. Always a rascal, David once happened upon New York City Police routing a gang; he stayed to watch the firefight. However, he neglected to mention this to his parents who later saw a newspaper photo of the raid; young David was perched just outside of the line of fire. David attended the University of Illinois and served in the US Army during WWII. He co-founded Timpson, Kramer and Crane, a successful food brokerage business in the mid-60s. A lifelong Republican, he was surrounded by a family of staunch Democrats, providing fodder for his love of boisterous political argument. Above all else, David valued family, friends and a good party. When his final illness robbed him of his voice, he joined in a raucous dinner by whispering a joke to one of his daughters line by line so that she could broadcast it to the clan. His beloved wife, Carol, his daughters, Susan Crane (Terry Etapa), Andrea Crane-Rabe, and Nancy Crane (Tom Butler), his brother Gerald (Joan), his grandsons Eric and Dan Rabe (Paula), and numerous nephews and nieces survive him. When asked what he wanted his obituary to say David retorted: ""Tell anyone who owes me money to send it to Carol."""

By 1926, recent course improvements, including a laborious project to tear up the grass to expose the sandy subsoil in hundreds of places, had made Royal Lytham & St. Annes newly worthy in the eyes of the British golf establishment.

Fed up with the heat, Rory and I tortured our parents into letting us swim in Bethesda Fountain. They gave in, sick of our whining. We stripped down to our briefs and vaulted over the stone into the water."

2012-07-16T00:00:00Z,"Moviegoer response to ''Ice Age: Continental Drift'' was a tad chilly. This fourth installment in 20th Century Fox's ''Ice Age'' franchise took in about $46 million in North America over the weekend, a No. 1 finish at the box office and on par with Fox's expectations. But ''Continental Drift'' also lacked the ticket-selling sizzle of its predecessor in this series, with franchise fatigue and competition from other animated movies the most likely explanation. ''Continental Drift'' is the third big cartoon release of the summer, arriving behind ''Brave'' and ''Madagascar 3: Europe's Most Wanted,'' both of which took in $60 million or more over their first three days. Perhaps reflecting its title, ''Continental Drift'' has been much stronger overseas, racking up a huge $339 million in ticket sales, according to Fox. ''The Amazing Spider-Man'' (Sony) was second for the weekend in North America, taking in an estimated $35 million for a two-week total of $200.9 million, according to Hollywood.com, which compiles box-office data."

(HBO Signature) 127 HOURS (2010) In April 2003, Aron Ralston, a 27-year-old hiker, fell in a narrow slot in Blue John Canyon in Utah and was trapped, his right arm pinned beneath a boulder. For five days he struggled to free himself, narrating his plight into a small video camera and reflecting on the mistakes that landed him in this mess -- not least, neglecting to tell anyone where he was going. Faced with the increasing prospect of death, Mr. Ralston decided to amputate his immobilized arm using the blade of a cheap multipurpose tool. James Franco earned an Academy Award nomination for his turn as Mr. Ralston in this film by Danny Boyle, which A. O. Scott, writing in The New York Times, called ''nearly flawless.'' There are scenes, he added, ''that are hard to bear -- the cracking of a bone, the severing of a nerve, the desperate consumption of a water bag filled with urine -- but what these moments communicate is more than worth a jolt of discomfort or a spasm of revulsion. To say that this movie gets under your skin is only barely a figure of speech. It pins you down, shakes you up and leaves you glad to be alive.''"

2012-07-17T00:00:00Z,"The first lady, Michelle Obama, and her daughters, Malia and Sasha, returned to Broadway last weekend and showed their preferences once again for fan-favorite musicals as well as those featuring black characters. The family split up on Saturday night, with Mrs. Obama and a friend slipping into ''The Gershwins' Porgy and Bess,'' then congratulating the cast onstage after the curtain went down. A producer, Jeffrey Richards, said Mrs. Obama thanked Audra McDonald, Norm Lewis and the other actors for ''blessing my soul'' and added that seeing a production of ''Porgy and Bess'' had been on her ''bucket list.'' Her daughters attended the more family-friendly musical ''Sister Act'' that night, then went backstage to meet the show's 26-year-old star, Raven-Symoné, according to a production spokesman. On Sunday afternoon, Mrs. Obama and her daughters saw ''Spider-Man: Turn Off the Dark.'' A bomb scare, believed to be unrelated to the Obamas' visit, led to the questioning of a theatergoer and a search of his bags by the police and Secret Service agents, a spokesman for the production said; nothing suspicious was found. Mrs. Obama had the prime aisle seat often accorded to celebrities because Spider-Man lands a few feet away during the show; on Sunday Spider-Man (played by Christopher Tierney) dropped down and saluted Mrs. Obama, who laughed and waved, the production spokesman said. Of the three Obama picks, ''Spider-Man'' scored highest at the box office last week, grossing $1.74 million; ''Sister Act'' took in $738,916 and ''Porgy and Bess'' grossed $550,485. Overall, Broadway shows grossed $23.4 million, compared to $22.4 million the previous week and $21.3 million for the comparable week last summer."

Great thinkers and writers from the past have effectively been banished from this year's ceremony by the National September 11 Memorial and Museum, whose chairman is Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg. Readings from literary sources have been a tradition at the Sept. 11 ritual, performed by a few elected officials, who choose from a menu of passages built on a theme set by City Hall.

Anne Paolucci was the author of over 20 books of plays, short stories, novels, poetry and essays. In memory of her late husband, Dr. Henry Paolucci, she edited over thirty of his books. Her last book, completed weeks before her death, was Henry Paolucci, - A Conservative for All Seasons - a history of Henry's work as a founder of the NYS Conservative Party and his run for the United States Senate in 1964.

Dr. Paolucci wrote extensively on Pirandello, ancient and modern drama, Hegel, ""Theater of the Absurd,"" Edward Albee, and Shakespeare. Her book, From Tension to Tonic: The Plays of Edward Albee remains a classic in the field. Edward Albee: The Later Plays, was published in 2010.

In l970 she was founder and president of Council on National Literatures, a non-profit educational foundation dedicated to promoting the expansion of comparative literary studies. For 32 years she continued to edit the Review of National Literatures (1970-2001) and, later, CNL/World Report (1976-2001.) In 1986, President Reagan appointed her to the Council on the Humanities, where she continued to serve under the administrations of Presidents Bush and Clinton. She was chosen by Governor George Pataki in 1996 to serve on the Board of Trustees of The City University of New York (The second largest university system in the USA.) and in 1997 was named Chairwoman of the Board, a position from which she resigned in 1999 to devote her time to writing and publishing. She has been honored with the title of ""Commendatore"" (Legion of Merit) by the Italian government and in 2008 received the Lifetime Achievement Award and Gold Medal of New York State Senate as well as Recognition by the New York City Council.

President Obama has done nicely in raising fuel averages for automobiles, but he came into office promising much more, and Mitt Romney promises even less. (There was a time he supported cap and trade.)

That agreement stipulated that signatories would annually reduce their emissions of greenhouse gases and was ratified (and even acted upon) by almost every country in the world, including every industrialized nation but one. That would be the United States. Now that's exceptionalism. (Bill Clinton signed Kyoto; George W. Bush, despite an election pledge, repudiated it.)"

That military rank, the highest for a living North Korean, could further cement his status as head of the 1.1 million-strong military. The move is the latest in a reshuffling this week, with Vice Marshal Ri Yong-ho, one of the country's most powerful military and party leaders, removed Monday from all of his posts because of ''illness.'' On Tuesday, the country announced the promotion of a little-known general, Hyon Yong-chol, to vice marshal. He was the fourth officer to receive that rank since Mr. Kim took power in December, and according to state news media, he has replaced Vice Marshal Ri as chief of the military. The internal struggle that resulted in the ouster of an official of Vice Marshal Ri's stature proceeded with no outward sign of turmoil."

(Ms. Gordon, who runs the Village Vanguard in Manhattan, is the first club owner to become a jazz master.)

2012-07-19T00:00:00Z,"A new study shows that prostate cancer surgery, which often leaves men impotent or incontinent, does not appear to save the lives of men with early-stage disease, who account for most cases, and many of these men would do just as well to choose no treatment at all. The findings were based on the largest-ever clinical trial comparing surgical removal of the prostate with a strategy known as ''watchful waiting.'' They add to growing concerns that prostate cancer detection and treatment efforts over the past 25 years, particularly in the United States, have been woefully misguided, rendering millions of men impotent, incontinent and saddled with fear about a disease that was unlikely ever to kill them in the first place. About 100,000 to 120,000 radical prostatectomy surgeries are performed in the United States each year."

At first glance the space seems like any other Rothko installation -- abstract canvases of saturated colors. There is ''Green and Maroon,'' ''Green and Red on Tangerine,'' ''Orange and Red on Red'' and ''Ochre and Red on Red.'' But the cumulative effect is profound, almost mystical. The longer viewers spend there, the more the paintings seem to change. The same kind of spiritual experience is soon to be created again at the Phillips. The German artist Wolfgang Laib will not be working on canvases, though, nor will he be using paint. The artist, who is known for works that use natural materials in magical, often ephemeral ways, will install a small chamber fashioned from wax. It will be only the third site-specific commission for the museum. (Besides the Rothko Room, designed in 1959 by the institution's founder, Duncan Phillips, to Rothko's exact specifications, the Phillips commissioned Ellsworth Kelly to make a sculpture for its new courtyard unveiled in 2006.)"

Dearly loved husband, father, grandfather, brother, brother-in-law, and friend died on July 16th at home in Lakeville, CT more than five years after his diagnosis of lung cancer. He was 70. Vance grew up in Alexandria, VA where his lifelong fascination with history and government began. Although he was a nominee for a Woodrow Wilson Fellowship he instead chose a career in law. After graduating from the Georgetown University Law Center he joined the Employee Benefits Division of the American National Bank & Trust Co. in Chicago. He returned to Washington, DC to join the United States House of Representatives Committee on Education & Labor. He was its Chief Counsel and Staff Director-Pension Task Force. The work of this committee led to the passage of the Employee Retirement Security Act of 1974 (ERISA). Subsequently he held positions with the American Bankers Association and then rejoined the U.S. House of Representatives Committee on Education & Labor to focus on the passage of the Multi-employer Pension Plan Act of 1980. His work in employment law continued after joining Mobil Oil Corporation as Employee Relations Counsel and Assistant Secretary. He then served as Associate General Counsel and Assistant Secretary of Allied Signal Inc. He joined Merrill Lynch's Office of the General Counsel in 1998 initially acting as an advisor to its Retirement Group. Despite his diagnosis of cancer in 2007, he continued to work virtually uninterrupted until early 2012. His most recent position was Managing Director and Associate General Counsel of Bank of America/Merrill Lynch. He is survived by his wife, Margaret Monaco; his son James Anderson, daughter-in-law Virginia Grandison, their children Emma and James, Jr.; his daughter Emily Anderson, son-in-law David Natt, their children Sydney, Sam, and Sophie; his daughter Heather (Anderson) Donnelly, son-in-law Brian Donnelly, their children George and Abigail; his daughter Meaghan Anderson; his sister Jane (Anderson) Cram; nieces, nephews, grand nephews, sisters and brothers-in-law. He was predeceased by his brother, Cyrus T. Anderson, Jr. and his parents Cyrus T. and Marna Lucille Anderson. Vance's work was always important to him; he found a true home and work family when he joined Merrill Lynch but nothing was more important to him than his own family he was the constant in his children's lives. He took such joy in watching them blossom and mature. He was so proud of the adults they became. And then there were the grandchildren; he loved being their ""Hot Shot"" although it was for far too short a time.

Rob, a pool cleaner with a troubled marriage living on the New Jersey shore, becomes a hero when his new chemical concoction is found to cleanse the polluted sea. His discovery is soon sabotaged by a rival who covets his fame and his wife, leading to a few standard misunderstandings - and the few standard jokes that come with them - on the way to the eventual happy ending. While the plot is implausible, that's not an insurmountable problem in musical comedy. But the book (by Pia Cincotti) is likewise uninterested in satire, allegory or anything other than using the story as a slow-moving vehicle to deliver the next eager-to-please moment."

The online publication The Daily reported that Mr. Sorkin, the Emmy- and Academy Award-winning creator and executive producer of ''The Newsroom,'' is hiring an almost entirely new writing staff for a coming second season of the HBO drama. A press representative for HBO said in an e-mail that such changes were common at many series, adding: ''Every year each show reassesses the needs of its writing staffs. This process is nothing out of the ordinary.'' Mr. Sorkin, who previously created and wrote many episodes of the television shows ''Sports Night'' and ''The West Wing,'' has taken some criticism for the first season of ''The Newsroom,'' which had its debut in June. Reviewing the series for The New York Times, Alessandra Stanley wrote that at its best it possessed ''a wit, sophistication and manic energy that recalls James L. Brooks's classic movie 'Broadcast News,''' while ''at its worst, the show chokes on its own sanctimony.'' Viewership for ''The Newsroom'' has remained healthy over its first four episodes, drawing about two million viewers for broadcasts of new episodes and between six million and seven million viewers over multiple showings."

The increase is largely driven by students from more affluent families - those with incomes of $100,000 or more, the study found. Students from lower- and moderate-income families have typically lived at home for at least part of their college career. But more difficult economic times, and the increasing cost of a college degree, are prompting students from better-off families to live with their parents, too."

Manohla Dargis, writing in The New York Times, called it a ''smart, spooky thriller about a thicket of contemporary plagues -- a killer virus, rampaging fear, an unscrupulous blogger,'' adding that the movie is ''as ruthlessly effective as the malady at its cool, cool center.'' Gwyneth Paltrow, above, plays one of the first casualties, an executive who has traveled to Hong Kong. Matt Damon is her husband, who watches as the disease cuts down seemingly everyone who has been within touching, kissing or handshaking distance of a carrier. The ensemble cast is filled out by Laurence Fishburne, Kate Winslet and Jennifer Ehle as employees of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention; Marion Cotillard as a doctor for the World Health Organization; and Jude Law as a San Francisco blogger looking to turn a profit from the crisis. ''Once it may have been hard to buy the swift collapse of order that is made palpably real in 'Contagion,' if Hurricane Katrina and its aftermath had not already set the stage,'' Ms. Dargis wrote. ''Mr. Soderbergh doesn't milk your tears as things fall apart, but a passion that can feel like cold rage is inscribed in his images of men and women isolated in the frame, in the blurred point of view of the dying and in the insistent stillness of a visual style that seems like an exhortation to look.'' 10:30 A.M.

When it came to education, Mrs. Warren never said no. Mrs. Warren was involved in many other activities and was exceptional in all she did including golf, tennis, basketball, and field hockey. She attended Smith College in Northhampton, MA. She was the golf club champion at the Country Club of Fairfield, many times. She was the only woman champion of the Star Atlantic Coast Sailing Championship. She enjoyed being a part of the support team when her husband, Briggs Cunningham, won the America's Cup in 1958 and when he raced in Le Mans in the 1950s. Lucie and Briggs also won numerous sailing championships in Europe. Mrs. Warren had tremendous care in her final years and the family is extremely grateful to all of the dedicated individuals who provided such exceptional care and who became a part of her life. In lieu of flowers, the family requests that donations be made to any of the charities that Mrs. Warren was involved. She improved countless lives and we are better people because of her.

After his retirement, Shelley was sent to Budapest by the International Executive Service Corps to help start a financial magazine, where he delighted and impressed his Hungarian audience at a special dinner by addressing them in their own language, which he learned just for that event. Shelley loved music and in his free time enjoyed playing piano, tennis, poker, skiing, horseback riding, golfing, as well as introducing his grandchildren to deliciously unhealthy breakfasts. Shelley was an intellectual's intellectual, renowned for his dry sense of humor, razor-sharp wit, and ability to weave a story. This modest and gentle man was loved and respected by all.

2012-07-22T00:00:00Z,"HOPELESS is the word that Douglas Sirk used to describe the characters' struggles for happiness in ''IMITATION OF LIFE'' (1959), his great melodrama about race, women and the American dream. ''Both white and black,'' he said in ''Sirk on Sirk,'' ''are living imitated lives.'' Not surprisingly, show business -- rather than the pancake business of John Stahl's 1934 version -- is where those lives find their truest expression. That goes for Lora Meredith (Lana Turner, the ur imitation blonde), an ambitious actress, as well as for Sarah Jane Johnson (Susan Kohner), a light-skinned black woman who can pass for white and does so as a dancer in a tawdry floor show. Everything in Sirk's movie looks gloriously artificial, from the bubblelike jewels that float down in the opening credits, to the saturated color, to Lora's suburban home, whose horizontal lines fill the wide-screen frames like a series of dioramas or stage sets that contain the characters' imitated lives. One thing is very real: the emotion the movie generates. Bring a hankie or four to the Film Forum, which is showing ''Imitation of Life'' on a bill with ''All That Heaven Allows'' on Wednesday, as part of ''Universal 100.''209 West Houston Street, South Village; (212) 727-8110, filmforum.com."

Perhaps. With Mr. Obama (law) or Mitt Romney (law and business) in the White House, every president from 1989 to at least 2017 will have had a degree from Harvard or Yale. But the presidency has not always been elitist: 11 presidents never graduated college, and in the early years many had only a few years of formal schooling. We turned to the University of Virginia's Miller Center, whose mission is to expand understanding of the presidency, for a history lesson. 1. George Washington"
2012-07-22T00:00:00Z,"THE LAST OLYMPICS IN LONDON were the 1948 Summer Games, the first after a 12-year hiatus caused by World War II. The United States sent more than 300 athletes, most of them arriving in England after a weeklong voyage on the S.S. America. In London, they found a city still devastated by years of bombings preparing for what became known as the Austerity Games. A food-rationing program was in effect, so many athletes were encouraged to pack food alongside their uniforms, sneakers, swimsuits or canoe paddles. The organizers could not afford to build an Olympic Village to house the competitors, so a large group stayed in barracks at an air base outside the city. With the Games set to return to London this week, veterans of '48 recalled some of the best days of their lives."

2012-07-22T00:00:00Z,"LOW--Frances Levison, One of the first women to be recognized as a reporter at the Time-Life organization and a long-time resident of New York, died in San Francisco on June 18, 2012 after a short illness at age 92. After attending Horace Mann for 12 years, graduating from Vassar College (class of '41) with honors and earning an MA in History from Columbia University, Frances started as a researcher with Life Magazine. When she left the Time-Life organization in 1952, Frances was a full-fledged reporter and the lone woman reporter among the Time Washington Bureau staff. She worked in New York and Chicago, and after WWII in London, Paris, and Washington, D.C. Among her memorable articles for Life Magazine was an intimate study of Elizabeth Taylor who at age 17 was coming on the Hollywood scene as perhaps its most glamorous ingenue. Another was an in-depth study of Margaret Truman, daughter of former President Harry S. Truman. Frances also wrote of her experience as a student at Le Cordon Bleu Cooking School in Paris in which she described the peeling of a live eel among the culinary techniques of the French kitchen. This article, accompanied by a photograph of the chef performing the slippery operation, caught the eye of fellow student, Julia Child. Frances spent several nights in an Illinois prison for women to write an article about the inmates, many of them incarcerated because of violence against abusive husbands or boyfriends. She was forever moved by the screams and moans she heard in those nights behind bars. Frances left the Time-Life organization in 1952 to marry Robert A. Low, then an officer in the U.S. Department of State. She became a Special Assistant to Henry M. Jackson, Democratic Senator from Washington state. She and her husband became lifelong friends of Sen. Jackson. Frances and 'Bob' moved to New York City in 1954. Bob entered city politics and Frances played significant roles in her husband's campaigns for the New York City Council, where he served two terms, 1961-1969. He is best remembered for sponsoring and seeing the signing into law by then-Mayor John V. Lindsey of a local anti- pollution law that outlawed the burning of soft coal and outlawed apartment house incinerators, and gradually reduced the permissible content of sulphur in fuel oil. His campaigns for mayor and for president of the City Council in 1969, while unsuccessful had Frances all over Manhattan and the five boroughs getting deeply connected with the people and issues of the most important city in the world. After the birth of her two sons, Allen (now an airline pilot) and Roger (a long time hedge fund manager), Frances joined the New York City Partnership, a predecessor of the Partnership for New York. The Economic Development Council of New York City awarded her a medal of achievement for her work in connecting business leaders with the work of City agencies, particularly the public school system. Later she brought the program, now known as Open Doors, to the Board of Education. The Program focused on exposing young students to the world of work and included talks by representatives of various fields of work. It also included visits to work sites and offices. Part of her program introduced young people to the possibilities of employment in the Culinary Arts. She became an early member of Les Dames d'Escoffier, now an international organization of prominent women connected with the food world. Frances was a believer in the power of education and continued to support East Harlem School at Exodus House in New York City, a year-round middle school that teaches children from low-income families develop academic excellence, moral integrity, courtesy, and an unshakeable commitment to their future and the fate of their community. Since moving to San Francisco with Bob in 1996 to be near their family, Frances had dedicated herself to several charitable activities, including AIM High, an organization that conducts summer programs for middle school students in school sites around the Bay Area. She also built a family website to honor her two deceased sisters, Helene and Eleanor, ancestors and share family stories, photos and memorabilia. Frances is survived by her husband, Bob, as well as her son, Allen, his children Andrew, Alexandra and Elena (and their mother, Berta); son Roger, and his children Jesse, Gabriel and Sarah (and their mother, Virginia), and many nieces and nephews. Donations in Frances' memory may be made to East Harlem School, 309 East 103rd Street, New York, NY 10029. A gathering for family and friends to celebrate Frances' life will be held in New York City at a later date."

2012-07-22T00:00:00Z,"BUSTS by the German Baroque sculptor FRANZ XAVER MESSERSCHMIDT of men weeping or grimacing, yawning or looking as though they are about to scream have fascinated artists, collectors, scholars and museum curators for more than two centuries. Recent shows devoted to his work have been on view at the Louvre in Paris and the Neue Galerie in New York. Now the J. Paul Getty Museum in Los Angeles is taking a new look at Messerschmidt. Its show -- ''Messerschmidt and Modernity'' -- which opens at the Getty Center on Tuesday, will present these mid-18th-century sculptures. But rather than explore Messerschmidt's work by itself, the exhibition will include modern and contemporary works that underscore his enduring influence. During the last 13 years of his life -- between 1770 and 1783 -- he produced a group of 69 so-called character heads, which he intended as a way of representing the spectrum of human emotion and which he either carved in alabaster or cast in a lead or tin alloy. Eight of them will be on view at the Getty, including the museum's ''Vexed Man.'' To illustrate Messerschmidt's influence, the show will also feature work by Tony Cragg, Bruce Nauman, Pierre Picot and Cindy Sherman. (310) 440-7300, getty.edu."

This 1987 deconstruction of fairy tales, which includes such megastars as Rapunzel, Little Red Riding Hood and Jack the Giant Killer, has long been considered by critics something of a problem musical. They have taken issue with the overpacked plot and a wavering tone but usually not before raving about its songs and mighty ambition. Much of the creative team (including the director Timothy Sheider) for the new version comes from an acclaimed English production at Regent's Park Open Air Theater. In his 2010 review in The New York Times, Matt Wolf hinted that New York has a comparable address in the Delacorte Theater in Central Park. Maybe someone was listening, since that's where this impressive new cast performing the show will be, starting Monday. The ensemble includes Amy Adams, Denis O'Hare, Donna Murphy, Chip Zien (who was the Baker in the original Broadway production) and Glenn Close, in the voice of the giant, a role played by Judi Dench in the previous New York production.

Dr. Reuter has had a distinguished career as a radiologist, legal scholar, and educator. He spent his entire career in academics. Dr. Reuter's training was unique. He earned a B.S. from Ohio Wesleyan University, a M.D. from Case Western Reserve University School of Medicine, and a J.D. from the University of San Francisco. He was a pioneer in the field of cardiovascular radiology. He was the first to describe the angiographic abnormalities in several disease processes in the abdomen. He is one of the founders of the Society of Cardiovascular and Interventional Radiology. He was a member of the Texas Bar. His law review articles are considered authoritative resources in appellate decisions. Dr. Reuter accepted the Chair in the Department of Radiology at UTHSCSA in 1980 and remained its Chair for 20 years. He built a first class research laboratory, where the technique of percutaneous transhepatic portocaval shunting was developed, in which Dr. Julio Palmaz invented the arterial stent. While serving as Chair, Dr. Reuter also helped develop the UTHSCSA Center for Medical Ethics and Humanities. He is one of its founders. In retirement, Dr. Reuter worked as an artist. His art was shown at the Gallery Nord in San Antonio and the MADI Museum of Art in Dallas. Dr. Reuter was a renaissance man, a great friend to many, and a beautiful husband and partner for his beloved wife Marianne.

Markey, a Massachusetts Democrat, reported that cellphone carriers responded to 1.3 million demands for subscriber information last year from law enforcement agencies. That figure did not include data from T-Mobile, because it had asked Mr. Markey's office to keep the figure confidential; it was not the case that T-Mobile had refused to release the information. (On the day of Mr. Markey's announcement, T-Mobile disclosed the number: 191,000 requests in 2011. A T-Mobile spokesman said that because the carriers had different ways of tallying requests for call data, T-Mobile was ''initially concerned the comparison could lead to an inaccurate portrayal.'')"

2012-07-22T00:00:00Z,"THE latest addition to J. Crew's curated In Good Company collection comes from Goldsign, the Los Angeles jeans brand founded by the denim industry's designer-guru Adriano Goldschmied. The item: a classic five-pocket called Jenny made of selvage denim that is ''in between a sexy jean and a boyfriend jean,'' Mr. Goldschmied said. Available in two washes -- a dark vintage and a lighter shade with a green cast -- the one-year-old style was originally inspired by a pair worn by Norma Jeane Baker in photographs taken by André de Dienes in the 1940s. Just like those jeans, the Jenny has a straight side seam, a high waist and a cuff (that's easy to undo, as shown here). ''Back then women were buying men's jeans and rolling them up,'' Mr. Goldschmied said. ''I was in some way a little bit tired of the skinny that was born in L.A. and that's been very successful. I was looking for what's next. My way of designing is about starting from something that's part of a tradition and not just replicating it but innovating through fabric, fit and wash.''"

Michael was born and raised in Atlanta, GA and although a Manhattanite for most of 30 years, he retained a southern gentility while facing the challenges of living in New York. He nourished his southern roots in recent years by visiting family in Pawley's Island, SC. Michael came to New York in 1980 to attend Circle in the Square School of Performing Arts. He also attended Parsons School of Design. He worked as an actor in New York and Washington, DC, where he lived for seven years. He appeared in commercials, corporate films, TV shows, off Broadway plays and regional theater. While in Washington, his priorities shifted significantly and he found a new primary purpose. At about this time, he began working in the real estate business and discovered he had a real knack for it. Missing Manhattan, he returned to New York where his charm, creativity, insight into people, and negotiating skills were the recipe for his considerable success as a broker, investor and developer. Michael was well known for his integrity and kindness. Michael is survived by many dear friends and, his beloved family, Sally Garr Brodhead, Andy Garr of Henderson, TX. He was predeceased by his parents M. A. Garr, Jr. and Lorraine Sarah Mullaney. A memorial service will be held at Church of the Ascension on July 26, 2012 at 6:30pm. In lieu of flowers, donations should go to the Church of the Ascension Outreach where he was on the Board of the Food Pantry or to the Ryan White Program in Charleston SC."

2012-07-22T00:00:00Z,"We are nearing the end of the season of the Great Mentioning, with murmurs of a vice presidential pick by Mitt Romney in the next few weeks, and possibly sooner. Will it be Tim Pawlenty, Bobby Jindal or Rob Portman? Or maybe Condoleezza Rice, despite her consistent declarations that she has no interest? The media, and to some extent the public, are focused on who Romney will choose. A better question is: what is Romney's vision for the office of the vice president, and how does his running mate plan to exercise the enormous powers of that office? If you watched the recent HBO comedy series ''Veep,'' you might conclude that vision and expectations don't matter because the vice president is an irrelevant player in the governing game, or relevant only for comedic purposes. Indeed, Vice President Biden has contributed from time to time to the image of the vice presidency as a source of entertainment."

2012-07-22T00:00:00Z,"What is the most burdensome disease in the world today? According to the World Health Organization, the disease that robs the most adults of the most years of productive life is not AIDS, not heart disease, not cancer. It is depression. The disease is not merely a bourgeois problem. It is especially prevalent in places that have experienced war, disaster or crushing deprivation. Yes, in many poor countries the bonds between people are much stronger than they are in wealthier, more individualistic societies, and this is a good thing for mental health. But it can hardly counteract the fact that a lot of people have an awful lot to be depressed about. Violence - whether war or high rates of crime - produces widespread post-traumatic stress. The constant worry that a crop failure or serious illness will throw a family into poverty is a source of extreme anxiety. Seeing your children go hungry creates paralyzing guilt."

The concept: embody the spirit of a traditional base camp (where mountaineers swap equipment, advice and war stories before expeditions) with a modern eco-chic touch. ''There's an amazing sense of community and exploration in these camps,'' said the hotel's owner, Christian Strobel, an avid hiker and mountain biker, and the former chief development officer at Joie de Vivre hotels. Then there's the design, a riff on the idea of roughing it. Each of the 50 rooms has tarp headboards, kerosene desk lamps and reclaimed-barnwood furnishings. Some rooms offer bunk beds with bright-orange frames; one, the Great Indoors, has green carpet that looks like grass, an electric log fire and a tented king bed. As for the actual great outdoors? Activities include rock-climbing, mountain biking and paddle boarding on Lake Tahoe -- or taking in the Sierra Nevadas from Basecamp's rooftop hot tub."

Robin was born on July 13, 1953 in New York City to Sam and Beverly Silverman, and was raised on Long Island. Having lived in Boston, New York City, and Providence, she returned to New York City after grad- uating from The Rhode Island School of Design with professional degrees in both Architecture and Fine Arts. Robin also received a degree in Interior Design from Fashion Institute of Technology. She was a gifted artist and designer, who possessed a strong work ethic, and had a distinguished career as an architect, most recently as an Associate within the partnership group at Skidmore Owings & Merrill in New York. As a recipient of a prestigious Stewardson Keefe LeBrun Travel Grant from the American Institute of Architects, Robin conducted extensive architectural research in northern Italy in 1997, where her self-directed study focused on modernist interventions to architecturally historic significant buildings, including the work of Carlo Scarpa, as an alternative approach to historic building additions. A generous teacher and professional advisor, Robin shared information and knowledge while training younger designers and architects. Robin was a creative, fiercely determined yet reflective and sensitive person, generous with her loyalty, support and compassion. She radiated warmth, passion and humor and was especially inspired by travel, cultures, spirituality, the mystery and beauty of the natural world, color, and all of the Arts.

2012-07-22T00:00:00Z,"RESIDENTS of Barrio Logan, a predominately Mexican-American neighborhood near the waterfront in downtown San Diego, have long fought to preserve the area's Latino cultural heritage. In the 1960s, when a bridge linking downtown to the wealthy Coronado enclave bisected the neighborhood, displacing many homes and businesses, local artists responded by turning the bridge pylons into soaring murals depicting Chicano heroes and historical events. Recent years have seen a new wave of artists' collectives, performance spaces and galleries occupying repurposed warehouses, and many of the newcomers maintain ties to Barrio Logan's Latino roots.

2012-07-22T00:00:00Z,"It's unclear whether the slew of seating fees that have touched off a backlash by families, who fear that they will be separated, has increased airlines' revenue. But the fees have prompted action. Representative Jerrold Nadler, a New York Democrat, introduced a bill this month requiring the transportation secretary to issue regulations to ensure that families sit together ''to the extent practicable.'' ''Families should not be stuck paying hidden fees, or buying 'premium' seats, simply because they wish to be seated together on crowded flights,'' Mr. Nadler said in a statement. The bill comes after Allegiant Air and Spirit began charging for advance seating assignments and after several carriers, including American and Delta, increased the percentage of coach seats offered at a premium fare."

The camera and microphone are blood and oxygen to him. Where he goes, he trails TV crews, a gallery of rabid followers, posse volunteers and, every four years, supplicating Republican presidential candidates. The tent-city jail he calls his ''concentration camp'' is meant to signify brash, unchallenged power. In the blistering landscape of Phoenix, he blots out the sun. The people he abuses and humiliates, by contrast, are not Fox News regulars. The men and women hustled into custody by his immigration sweeps are generally undocumented and unknown. The neighborhoods he targets can seem like traumatized places, silent and cowed by the dread Sheriff Joe."
2012-07-22T00:00:00Z,"SCHICK--George, On July 16th, 83, of Westwood, NJ. Devoted father of Jeanette Waldman and Ron Schick. Loving grandfather of Nichole, Michele, Dylan, Mason and Ruby. George was born in Budapest, Hungary and was a survivor of the Holocaust. He excelled at school and was a water polo captain. He escaped Hungary in 1956 and learned French at a collegiate level to finish his undergraduate studies at the University of Grenoble, in France. He moved to New York, learned English at a graduate studies level and received a scholarship to MIT where he earned his Masters of Science in Metallurgy in 1961. During his time at MIT he formed a water polo team and was recruited by Bell Labs who paid for his PhD studies. While at NYU he earned a Doctor of Philosophy degree from the School of Engineering and Science, as well as membership with the International Metallurgical Honor Society in 1971. In 1972, NYU awarded him a Founders Day Certificate. His primary research identified that 'Hydrogen Producing Bacteria was the cause of appreciable signal attenuation in optical fibers and that they could be suppressed by sulfate-reducing bacteria."" This research led to advancements in a number of applied sciences including the corrosive protection coating all automobiles and all fiber optic cabling to this day. In 1994 he received the Francis L. LaQue Memorial Award from the American Society for Testing and Materials for outstanding contributions to the field of corrosion testing and evaluation and became a Fellow of the ASTM in 1997. He was NACE chairman from 1983-1993 and served the National Association of Corrosion Engineers for over 25 years and received its technical achievement award in 1998. In 1985 he was named Distinguished Member of the Professional Staff by BELCORE. Throughout his career, during summer months, he was a professor at the University of West Virginia. He was a great man in every way and the world has lost a national treasure."

2012-07-22T00:00:00Z,"IN China modern dance is still relatively young, which is understandable. The political atmosphere hasn't exactly made it easy for an art form known to challenge the status quo to flourish. But this season's Lincoln Center Festival provides a closer look at one of the country's freshest choreographic voices. TAO YE, who formed TAO Dance Theater in 2008, presents his company in ''2,'' a male duet, and ''4,'' a work for four women that explores constant synchronicity. Clearly Mr. Tao cares little for complicated titles. As he sees it, words weigh a dance down, and he prefers that audiences view his works with as little expectation -- and as much imagination -- as possible. Both pieces exemplify Mr. Tao's approach, which is rooted in contemporary concerns about the body. His minimalist aesthetic strips movement and the human figure to their essence. In the spellbinding ''2,'' set to a score by the Chinese composer Xiao He, the dancers are first seen as deflated forms facedown on the floor. As they start to move, sliding their thighs and flinging their arms against the stage's surface, they possess the loopy grace of fish out of water. Prepare to be hypnotized. 7:30 p.m., Wednesday and Friday, Starr Theater, Alice Tully Hall, Lincoln Center; (212) 721-6500, lincolncenterfestival.org. $30 to $55."

2012-07-22T00:00:00Z,"WARREN--Lucie Bedford Cunningham Warren, of Greens Farms, CT, passed away peacefully at her home on July 16, 2012. Mrs. Warren was 104 years old. She is survived by her three children, Briggs S. Cunningham, III, and his wife, Elizabeth, of Lancaster, Kentucky, Lucie C. McKinney, of Greens Farms, CT, and Cythlen C. Maddock, and her husband, Paul ""Jay"" Maddock, of Palm Beach, FL. She was predeceased by her first husband, Briggs S. Cunningham, II, and her second husband, Lynne A. Warren. In addition to her children, Mrs. Warren was survived by her grandchildren, Paige Cunningham Garland, Brian Cunningham, Robert Cunningham, Blair Cunningham Newsome, Stewart B. McKinney, Jr., Lucie B. McKinney, Jean McKinney, Elizabeth McKinney Tritschler, John P. McKinney, John Dewing, Cythlen Dewing Moss, and Zachary Read. She was also survived by 25 great-grandchildren. She is survived by her sister, Ruth Bedford, and predeceased by her sisters, Helen McCashin and Mary Bedford. Mrs. Warren was also survived by her goddaughter, Lesley Cowenhoven, her good friend, Kathryn Ann Rabesa, and her loyal companions and sailing master, Walter and Lorraine Billings. Mrs. Warren was a woman who was ahead of her time well educated, well travelled, graceful and athletic. She was dignified, competitive and independent. She had vision, energy and a strong work ethic. Most of all, Mrs. Warren believed in helping others. She was known as the ""working donor"" and was a leader in her philanthropic pursuits. She was an extremely private person and always believed that her philanthropy did not need fanfare or notoriety. Mrs. Warren was a generous giver of time and philanthropy to many charitable worthwhile causes for over 75 years. She was deeply concerned about education and children. She supported Norwalk Hospital, especially the Lucie Bedford Warren Department of Pediatrics. She volunteered two days each week at Norwalk Hospital until she was 96 years old. She also supported the Wakeman Boys and Girls Club, Greens Farms Academy, the Chapin School in New York City, the Westport YMCA, the Connecticut Audubon Society, the Garden Club of America, the Mystic Aquarium Seaport for the Brilliant and many other worthwhile causes. She also volunteered at the Pequot Library Book Sale each year until she was 97 years old. In addition, she helped hundreds of individuals in supporting their personal education. When it came to education, Mrs. Warren never said no. Mrs. Warren was involved in many other activities and was exceptional in all she did including golf, tennis, basketball, and field hockey. She attended Smith College in Northhampton, MA. She was the golf club champion at the Country Club of Fairfield, many times. She was the only woman champion of the Star Atlantic Coast Sailing Championship. She enjoyed being a part of the support team when her husband, Briggs Cunningham, won the America's Cup in 1958 and when he raced in Le Mans in the 1950s. Lucie and Briggs also won numerous sailing championships in Europe. Mrs. Warren had tremendous care in her final years and the family is extremely grateful to all of the dedicated individuals who provided such exceptional care and who became a part of her life. In lieu of flowers, the family requests that donations be made to any of the charities that Mrs. Warren was involved. She improved countless lives and we are better people because of her. She will be greatly missed. Services will be private."

2012-07-22T00:00:00Z,"GAY characters are common on television and in films now, but there was another period when the movies contained a fair amount of homosexuality as well, or at least allusions to it. Vito Russo, who rediscovered those precode films and explored what happened to gay characters later in the century in a lecture series and book called ''The Celluloid Closet,'' is the subject of ''VITO,'' a documentary Monday night on HBO that recounts his eventful life not just as a scholar but also as an activist at the center of the gay-rights scene in New York. Mr. Russo, who died of AIDS in 1990, seemed to be everywhere in the tumultuous years when the gay liberation movement was defining itself and, it's now easy to see, changing American society. A revolution of a different sort is hinted at in ''THE LIGHT IN HER EYES,'' a timely documentary on PBS's ''POV'' that is being broadcast Sunday on WNET in New York (check local listings). It chronicles a school for girls in Damascus that emphasizes the study of Islam and a woman's place in it. The film was made just before the current uprising in Syria."

Dearly loved husband, father, grandfather, brother, brother-in-law, and friend died on July 16th at home in Lakeville, CT more than five years after his diagnosis of lung cancer. He was 70. Vance grew up in Alexandria, VA where his lifelong fascination with history and government began. Although he was a nominee for a Woodrow Wilson Fellowship he instead chose a career in law. After graduating from the Georgetown University Law Center he joined the Employee Benefits Division of the American National Bank & Trust Co. in Chicago. He returned to Washington, DC to join the United States House of Representatives Committee on Education & Labor. He was its Chief Counsel and Staff Director-Pension Task Force. The work of this committee led to the passage of the Employee Retirement Security Act of 1974 (ERISA). Subsequently he held positions with the American Bankers Association and then rejoined the U.S. House of Representatives Committee on Education & Labor to focus on the passage of the Multi-employer Pension Plan Act of 1980. His work in employment law continued after joining Mobil Oil Corporation as Employee Relations Counsel and Assistant Secretary. He then served as Associate General Counsel and Assistant Secretary of Allied Signal Inc. He joined Merrill Lynch's Office of the General Counsel in 1998 initially acting as an advisor to its Retirement Group. Despite his diagnosis of cancer in 2007, he continued to work virtually uninterrupted until early 2012. His most recent position was Managing Director and Associate General Counsel of Bank of America/Merrill Lynch. He is survived by his wife, Margaret Monaco; his son James Anderson, daughter-in-law Virginia Grandison, their children Emma and James, Jr.; his daughter Emily Anderson, son-in-law David Natt, their children Sydney, Sam, and Sophie; his daughter Heather (Anderson) Donnelly, son-in-law Brian Donnelly, their children George and Abigail; his daughter Meaghan Anderson; his sister Jane (Anderson) Cram; nieces, nephews, grand nephews, sisters and brothers-in-law. He was predeceased by his brother, Cyrus T. Anderson, Jr. and his parents Cyrus T. and Marna Lucille Anderson. Vance's work was always important to him; he found a true home and work family when he joined Merrill Lynch but nothing was more important to him than his own family he was the constant in his children's lives. He took such joy in watching them blossom and mature. He was so proud of the adults they became. And then there were the grandchildren; he loved being their ""Hot Shot"" although it was for far too short a time. A memorial service will be held at Christ Church in Greenwich, CT on Friday, July 27, 2012 at 11am. In lieu of flowers, contributions can be made to Memorial Sloane-Kettering Cancer Center, Attn: Mark G. Kris, MD or the Salisbury Visiting Nurse Association Hospice."

When Eric Schmidt was still chief executive of Google, I asked him what the company owned that would make it particularly hard for any emerging search contender to wipe Google out. Spell check, he said. Google had observed the spelling mistakes and corrections typed into billions of queries, and had a vast understanding of what people really meant when they typed like thsi.

Casting has not been announced. The season will start on Sept. 5 with ''Fly Me to the Moon,'' a new comedy written and directed by Marie Jones (''A Night in November'') about two social workers who face a moral dilemma when a man in their care dies after winning a horse racing bet. That is to be followed by, among others, ''A Twist of Water,'' written by Caitlin Montanye Parrish (''The View From Tall''), from Nov. 1 through Nov. 25, and ''The Outgoing Tide,'' written by Bruce Graham (''Any Given Monday''), from Nov. 7 to Dec. 16."

She is survived by her three children, Briggs S. Cunningham, III, and his wife, Elizabeth, of Lancaster, Kentucky, Lucie C. McKinney, of Greens Farms, CT, and Cythlen C. Maddock, and her husband, Paul ""Jay"" Maddock, of Palm Beach, FL. She was predeceased by her first husband, Briggs S. Cunningham, II, and her second husband, Lynne A. Warren. In addition to her children, Mrs. Warren was survived by her grandchildren, Paige Cunningham Garland, Brian Cunningham, Robert Cunningham, Blair Cunningham Newsome, Stewart B. McKinney, Jr., Lucie B. McKinney, Jean McKinney, Elizabeth McKinney Tritschler, John P. McKinney, John Dewing, Cythlen Dewing Moss, and Zachary Read. She was also survived by 25 great-grandchildren. She is survived by her sister, Ruth Bedford, and predeceased by her sisters, Helen McCashin and Mary Bedford. Mrs. Warren was also survived by her goddaughter, Lesley Cowenhoven, her good friend, Kathryn Ann Rabesa, and her loyal companions and sailing master, Walter and Lorraine Billings. Mrs. Warren was a woman who was ahead of her time well educated, well travelled, graceful and athletic. She was dignified, competitive and independent. She had vision, energy and a strong work ethic. Most of all, Mrs. Warren believed in helping others. She was known as the ""working donor"" and was a leader in her philanthropic pursuits. She was an extremely private person and always believed that her philanthropy did not need fanfare or notoriety. Mrs. Warren was a generous giver of time and philanthropy to many charitable worthwhile causes for over 75 years. She was deeply concerned about education and children. She supported Norwalk Hospital, especially the Lucie Bedford Warren Department of Pediatrics. She volunteered two days each week at Norwalk Hospital until she was 96 years old. She also supported the Wakeman Boys and Girls Club, Greens Farms Academy, the Chapin School in New York City, the Westport YMCA, the Connecticut Audubon Society, the Garden Club of America, the Mystic Aquarium Seaport for the Brilliant and many other worthwhile causes. She also volunteered at the Pequot Library Book Sale each year until she was 97 years old. In addition, she helped hundreds of individuals in supporting their personal education. When it came to education, Mrs. Warren never said no. Mrs. Warren was involved in many other activities and was exceptional in all she did including golf, tennis, basketball, and field hockey. She attended Smith College in Northhampton, MA. She was the golf club champion at the Country Club of Fairfield, many times. She was the only woman champion of the Star Atlantic Coast Sailing Championship. She enjoyed being a part of the support team when her husband, Briggs Cunningham, won the America's Cup in 1958 and when he raced in Le Mans in the 1950s. Lucie and Briggs also won numerous sailing championships in Europe. Mrs. Warren had tremendous care in her final years and the family is extremely grateful to all of the dedicated individuals who provided such exceptional care and who became a part of her life. In lieu of flowers, the family requests that donations be made to any of the charities that Mrs. Warren was involved. She improved countless lives and we are better people because of her. She will be greatly missed. Services will be private."

2012-07-23T00:00:00Z,"THE LAST OLYMPICS IN LONDON were the 1948 Summer Games, the first after a 12-year hiatus caused by World War II. The United States sent more than 300 athletes, most of them arriving in England after a weeklong voyage on the S.S. America. In London, they found a city still devastated by years of bombings preparing for what became known as the Austerity Games. A food-rationing program was in effect, and many athletes were encouraged to pack food alongside their uniforms, sneakers, swimsuits or canoe paddles. The organizers could not afford to build an Olympic Village to house the competitors, so a large group stayed in barracks at an air base outside the city. With the Games set to return to London this week, veterans of '48 recalled some of the best days of their lives."

Father O'Keefe died on July 22 after a long illness. He was 92. Today Fordham lost one of its heroes, Said Joseph M. McShane, S.J., president of the University. ""Father O'Keefe was a man of vision, integrity, and humor: though his tenure as president was relatively short, Fordham would not be the University it is today without his influence. I know the Fordham community joins with me in holding Father O'Keefe's family, friends, and colleagues in their thoughts and prayers."" Father O'Keefe served as Fordham's president from 1963 until 1965, when he participated in General Congregation XXXI of the Society of Jesus in Rome. At the Congregation he was elected Assistant ad providentiam to the newly-elected Superior General Pedro Arrupe, S.J. In 1975, during General Congregation XXXII, Father O'Keefe became general assistant and general counselor to Father Arrupe. He later served in Father Arrupe's place as vicar general during the superior general's illness. ""He had a long career and he and Father Arrupe worked very closely together,"" said former Fordham President Joseph A. O'Hare, S.J., about Father O'Keefe's 18 years of leadership in the General Governance of the Society. ""He was a very genial person and a great teller of stories, and had a great fondness for jokes,"" Father O'Hare said. ""He was always a great companion."" At the conclusion of General Congregation XXXIII, in 1983, Father O'Keefe returned to New York and became rector of Fordham's Jesuit Community. Father O'Keefe's time as Fordham's president, though brief, was significant. During his tenure, Father O'Keefe - after whom O'Keefe Commons is named - worked to incorporate women into the then all-male student body. ""At that time, only men were allowed at Fordham,"" Father O'Keefe said in a 2009 interview with The Ram. ""We wanted them to see that women were first-class citizens and had great minds, too."" Prior to becoming president, Father O'Keefe served as academic vice president from 1960 until 1963. Father O'Keefe entered the Society of Jesus in 1937, was ordained in 1950 in Louvain, Belgium and took his final vows in 1954 in Woodstock. After his formation, Father O'Keefe was professor of fundamental theology at the Woodstock theologate."

2012-07-25T00:00:00Z,"LANE--Mark. With great sadness, we mourn the loss of Mark Lane, Fidelis Care President and CEO, who passed away unexpectedly on July 22. The tradition of the Catholic health care ministry found a new expression in Fidelis Care, and Mr. Lane guided the health plan to become an advocate, a resource, and an answer for uninsured children and adults of all ages. From the beginning, he expressed and instilled in each of us an uncommon passion for excellence, the highest attention to detail, and a steadfast commitment to the company's mission of serving the poor and most vulnerable with compassion, dignity, and respect. His vision for what Fidelis Care could be was realized not only in the company's growth and success over the years, but also in the lives that were changed by having access to quality, affordable health insurance. He cared about people from all walks of life - children, parents, college students, jobless adults who recently lost health insurance, the low-income elderly, residents of rural areas, and those in New York's largest cities - there was no population too small, no story too insignificant for his focus and attention. With one set of values, Mr. Lane lived life seamlessly. Whether as steward of a successful company, or as loving and devoted husband, father, and grandfather, the same uncompromised principles prevailed. We are grateful for his vision and the standards and expectations he established, giving each of us a foundation upon which to build as we go forward, day by day. This is how we will honor him; he will never be forgotten. - The Board and Staff of Fidelis Care New York"

2012-07-26T00:00:00Z,"KOEGEL--Christina Williams, 90, of Armonk, NY, and formerly Granite Springs, NY, passed away peacefully July 22, 2012, at her home in Armonk. She was born on November 18, 1921, the youngest of four daughters born to the late Edgar I. Williams and the late Hulda Gustafva Olson Williams. The girls grew up in Rutherford, NJ. Christina attended Smith College and graduated in the class of 1943. While at Smith on traditional ""Mountain Day"" she traveled from Northampton to Williamstown, MA, the site of Williams College, where she met her future husband, James Erwin Koegel. Following college, she was working at Gibbs & Cox, ship architects, in Manhattan, while Jim Koegel was an attorney in the same city at Dwight, Harris, Koegel & Caskey (now Clifford Chance). When she was called upon to fill in a bridge foursome at the apartment of Jim Koegel's parents, the friendship rekindled. Eventually, on September 20, 1946, they were married in the chapel of St. Bartholomew's Church. Three children were born of this marriage, all three at Presbyterian Hospital. The first child was Christina Rae Koegel, who is now Christina Granrud in Kalispell, Montana, and the mother of two grandchildren, Philip and Jennifer Granrud. The second child was Sarah Nilsson Koegel, who lives in the Armonk home. The third child was James Arnold Koegel, who resides with his wife, May in the town of Bedford. The evening of November 19, 1954 was expected to be a festive occasion. The Koegel family planned to have dinner out and then attend a premier showing of the 20th Century Fox film Desiree at the old Roxy theatre. Unfortunately, Christina began to feel ill and her back ached badly. As a result she was taken to Columbia Presbyterian Hospital and was diagnosed with polio and spent three months in the Harkness Pavilion. Ironically, during her time at the hospital the announcement was made that Dr. Jonas Salk had developed the vaccine that would put an end to the scourge of polio. But this beautiful woman was determined to resist the disease and she fought mightily to regain strength in her legs and back. With great fortitude and spirit, and Sarah's good care, she was able to serve in many activities, including the Board and Executive Committee of Northern Westchester Hospital and active member of the Board of the VNA of Husdon Valley for many years. Jim predeceased Christina three years ago. A private service will be held for her at the Amawalk Cemetery, next to Jim."

Happily, with high fashion once again appropriating the mundane sweatshirt, there are plenty of cool options. In his prefall collection for Jil Sander, Raf Simons showed a preppy JS logo sweatshirt.

His publicists said Mr. Seinfeld would perform once in each of the five boroughs on Thursday nights in October and November, saying it would be the first time he'll have done a complete performance in a New York City theater since 1998, when he put on ''I'm Telling You for the Last Time'' at the Broadhurst Theater. In a statement, Mr. Seinfeld was quoted as saying, ''I was born in Brooklyn, went to school in Queens and started out as a comedian in Manhattan. I feel like New York City taught me how to be funny.'' Colin Quinn, the comedian whom Mr. Seinfeld recently directed in ''Long Story Short'' on Broadway, will also appear, the publicists said. Mr. Seinfeld is scheduled to perform at the Beacon Theater in Manhattan on Oct. 4; Lehman Concert Hall in the Bronx on Oct. 11; Colden Auditorium at Queens College on Oct. 18; St. George Theater in Staten Island on Nov. 1; and Walt Whitman Theater at Brooklyn College on Nov. 8.

There has been much gnashing of teeth (hopefully no biting of ears) about the news that the boxer Mike Tyson will be taking to the Broadway stage for a week this summer with a solo show, to be directed by Spike Lee. The buzz has been predictably comic. With his famously girly voice and his reckless style in the ring, Mr. Tyson has always been a national punch line; now he re-emerges in a new arena to play that role again. Neil Patrick Harris is already champing at the bit to tear him up at the next Tony Awards ceremony."

2012-07-26T00:00:00Z,"10 P.M. (Sundance) LOVE CRIME (2011) Isabelle (Ludivine Sagnier), an innocent and eager young employee, is manipulated and preyed upon by her mentor, Christine (Kristin Scott Thomas, above), a high-ranking executive in the Paris office of an American-based multinational company in this twist on ''All About Eve.'' Sent to Cairo at the last minute, Isabelle closes an important deal. But she also sleeps with her business associate Philippe (Patrick Mille), who happens to be Christine's lover. When Christine takes credit for her work, Isabelle enlists the help of her colleague Daniel (Guillaume Marquet) in a plot for revenge. Soon icy looks and venomous whispers give way to forged memos, savage humiliations and violence. ''At a certain point, though -- to say exactly when would ruin a fairly stunning surprise -- the cat-and-mouse psychology is jettisoned in favor of something more procedural,'' A. O. Scott wrote in The New York Times about this last film directed by Alain Corneau, who died in 2010. ''It is interesting and ingenious, even if some of the kinky, queasy fascination that had been so intoxicating in the earlier scenes ebbs away.'' But the movie ''also works -- like some of the later films of Claude Chabrol -- as a devilish satire on power and eros in the executive suite,'' he added. ''You can't help rooting for Isabelle, but at the same time you are hoping for things to get really nasty.'' 11:30 A.M. (HBO) THE TREE OF LIFE (2011) Jack O'Brien (Sean Penn), a middle-aged architect haunted by the death of his younger brother many years earlier in 1950s Texas, tries to reconcile his complicated relationship with his father (Brad Pitt) while contemplating human existence -- the origin of the universe, the development of life on earth, the end of time -- in this drama from Terrence Malick. Jessica Chastain (below, with Mr. Pitt) plays Jack's mother, whose grief, and that of her husband, over the loss of their son casts a shadow of tragedy over everything that will follow. And Hunter McCracken, a first-time actor, is Jack as a boy. ''The sheer beauty of this film is almost overwhelming,'' A. O. Scott wrote in The Times. ''But as with other works of religiously minded art its aesthetic glories are tethered to a humble and exalted purpose, which is to shine the light of the sacred on secular reality.'' The movie, which won the Palme d'Or at the Cannes Film Festival, received Oscar nominations for best picture, best director and best cinematography, for Emmanuel Lubezki."

Eagleton as his running mate in 1972, and the lasting effect that decision has had on vice presidential selections, referred imprecisely to Mr. McGovern's loss. While his defeat was the largest in a contested presidential race in terms of the margin of the popular vote, it was not the ''worst defeat'' ever in presidential history when judged by electoral votes -- the standard most historians use. In 1936, Alf Landon carried Maine and Vermont and won eight electoral votes. In 1984, Walter Mondale won his home state of Minnesota and the District of Columbia for 13 electoral votes.

The tradition of the Catholic health care ministry found a new expression in Fidelis Care, and Mr. Lane guided the health plan to become an advocate, a resource, and an answer for uninsured children and adults of all ages. From the beginning, he expressed and instilled in each of us an uncommon passion for excellence, the highest attention to detail, and a steadfast commitment to the company's mission of serving the poor and most vulnerable with compassion, dignity, and respect. His vision for what Fidelis Care could be was realized not only in the company's growth and success over the years, but also in the lives that were changed by having access to quality, affordable health insurance. He cared about people from all walks of life - children, parents, college students, jobless adults who recently lost health insurance, the low-income elderly, residents of rural areas, and those in New York's largest cities - there was no population too small, no story too insignificant for his focus and attention. With one set of values, Mr. Lane lived life seamlessly. Whether as steward of a successful company, or as loving and devoted husband, father, and grandfather, the same uncompromised principles prevailed. We are grateful for his vision and the standards and expectations he established, giving each of us a foundation upon which to build as we go forward, day by day. This is how we will honor him; he will never be forgotten. - The Board and Staff of Fidelis Care New York"

2012-07-26T00:00:00Z,"Sheila Heti's ''How Should a Person Be?'' is a novel that draws heavily on the real lives of Ms. Heti and her artistic friends in Toronto. With its experimental form, graphic talk about sex, philosophical musings about female friendship and portraits of sometimes befuddled adults, it has inspired a wide range of reaction. In The New York Times Book Review, David Haglund wrote that ''the novel shares with much reality television a kind of episodic aimlessness, and a focus on young, self-/involved characters who spend a lot of time thinking about how they look to other people,'' and that ''Heti sees the silliness in the desire for fame that drives such fare, but she also knows that same desire is involved in the impulse to make art.'' In a recent e-mail interview, Ms. Heti discussed writing about people she knows, why a little boredom in art can't hurt, and other things. Below are excerpts from the conversation."

''The Ladies of the Trianon,'' an exhibition attracting crowds to the Versailles palace known as the Grand Trianon, brings together three centuries of portraits of the grandes dames who made history, or, more often, watched as history was being made. The Grand Trianon was built by Louis XIV in the late 17th century as a place of escape from the rigid protocol and formality of the court of Versailles. It was built not for his wife, Maria-Theresa of Austria, but as a place to meet his lover, Madame de Montespan. In her austere portrait in the show Maria-Theresa wears a modest fleur-de-lis-patterned gown, an ermine-lined cloak and a blank expression that does not betray her suffering. (She turned toward religion for solace.) Madame de Montespan, in a contrasting portrait, wears a gown with a low-cut and loosefitting bodice; she is gazing at a Cupid with a bow and arrow. Beside her is a portrait of Louise-Françoise de Bourbon, one of her children from her relationship with the king."

2012-07-27T00:00:00Z,"For decades, the men's 100-meter final has been the glamour event of the Olympic Games, and the winner takes home bragging rights as the world's fastest man. Perhaps its pre-eminence is due to its simplicity: there's no time for endurance to kick in or midrace tactical adjustments to be made when the whole thing is over in 10 seconds. Which isn't to say a runner's approach doesn't matter. Some sprinters blast out of the blocks, trying to grab an early lead and unnerve opponents. Others build to peak speed and try to maintain it longer than the competition. But what you can't do is ''change your tactics in the middle,'' says Dave Johnson, director of the Penn Relays, one of the premier track-and-field events in the country. ''It's a race of total commitment in terms of strategy.'' Men's 100-meter world record (Usain Bolt, 2009): 9.58 seconds"

2012-07-27T00:00:00Z,"After delaying action on a sweeping farm bill, House leaders are now working to shape interim legislation that would aid farmers hit hard by a drought that has devastated large swaths of cropland and threatens livestock operations in the Midwest, lawmakers said on Thursday. Even as the idea of new legislation emerged, it remained unclear if lawmakers would use the opportunity to renew existing agriculture programs in the absence of a broader farm bill or would simply pass a disaster aid bill that would provide relief to cattle, pork and poultry farmers, who have been especially hard hit by the drought. Several disaster assistance programs for livestock producers that were in the 2008 farm bill expired last year."

Mr. Crocker was already WBLS's program director at the time of the purchase; Mr. Jackson did not hire him. And WBLS became the No. 1 station in New York in 1979, not ''the mid-1970s.''

It is with tremendous sadness that the Franz West Foundation, Gagosian Gallery, Galerie Meyer Kainer and Galerie Eva Presenhuber announce the death of Franz West, which occurred on July 25. He died peacefully in Vienna, Austria after a long illness. Franz West was one of the most innovative and progressive artists of his generation, who charmed, influenced and inspired his contemporaries, students and followers and all those who encountered him. His sculptural sensibilty culminated in the physical engagement of the onlooker with his sculpture, making the onlooker become part of the work. The world has lost a great artist who changed the way people looked at art and themselves. His great sense of originality and his generosity with other artists, writers and musicians will be missed by us all. Our thoughts are with his family, colleagues and friends on this very sad day."

Charles E. Young, who ran the museum from 2008 to 2010, made his argument to Eli Broad, the museum's largest donor and most influential board member, in an e-mail which was obtained by the paper. The museum's round of troubles began in June with the resignation of its longtime chief curator, Paul Schimmel, who was known to have a difficult relationship with Mr. Deitch, a former New York gallery owner. Mr. Schimmel's departure was followed by the resignation of four prominent artists from the board: John Baldessari, Catherine Opie, Barbara Kruger and Ed Ruscha. In his e-mail to Mr. Broad, as quoted in The Times, Mr. Young wrote of Mr. Deitch, ''I hope that the four-alarm fire now enveloping MOCA has at least given you pause for thought about his appointment and your continued attempts to try to save him for a job for which many (including myself) believe he is unqualified.''

2012-07-29T00:00:00Z,"THE Wade Thompson Drill Hall at the Park Avenue Armory, a major site for artistic spectacles of the indoor kind, has recently brought us a multistage Merce Cunningham celebration, a Mars-bound art installation by the sculptor Tom Sachs and an adventuresome surround-sound concert by the New York Philharmonic. Its latest offering, opening Friday, is ''The Murder of Crows,'' an elaborate sound installation by the Canadians JANET CARDIFF and GEORGE BURES MILLER. Something like a spatially dispersed radio play or an invisible film, the work is their largest yet. Its 98 speakers -- placed on stands, chairs and walls throughout the 55,000-square-foot hall -- will alternate enveloping aural effects with ambiguous narratives. The scene will be set by three dreams (recited by Ms. Cardiff) emanating from a vintage gramophone at the center of the space. The surrounding speakers will introduce other characters and vignettes as well as the sounds of everything from a bustling factory floor to crashing waves to a Russian marching band. The meaning of the sinister, noirish title will be for visitors to piece together. Luckily the chairs are also for sitting, as the work is unlikely to reveal itself fully with just one listening.

He died peacefully in Vienna, Austria after a long illness. Franz West was one of the most innovative and progressive artists of his generation, who charmed, influenced and inspired his contemporaries, students and followers and all those who encountered him. His sculptural sensibilty culminated in the physical engagement of the onlooker with his sculpture, making the onlooker become part of the work. The world has lost a great artist who changed the way people looked at art and themselves. His great sense of originality and his generosity with other artists, writers and musicians will be missed by us all. Our thoughts are with his family, colleagues and friends on this very sad day."

They've come a long way, baby. Modeling was once so disreputable that Bethann Hardison's mother thought she was a prostitute until she saw her in a television commercial. And though China Machado, with her Asian and Portuguese lineage, claims to have been the highest-paid model in Europe in the 1950s at $100 a month, it wasn't until Beverly Johnson, an African-American, landed the cover of Vogue in 1974 that the high-fashion color barrier in this country was broken."

First, the Americans were euphoric after scoring a convincing upset of world power South Korea in the semifinals at Lord's Cricket Ground. About an hour later, they were crushed in the gold medal match when Italy beat them by a single point on the final arrow of the competition. While a silver medal is hardly disappointing, the manner in which the United States lost was brutal. After scoring 27 points in their final end to cut their deficit to 1, the Americans watched as Italy scored 17 points on the first two arrows of its last series. If the final Italian archer, Michele Frangilli, scored 8 points, the United States would win outright; if he scored 9, the match would be tied; and if he scored 10, the Italians would win the gold medal after losing it four years ago on a similar last-arrow shot."

There's little less than a year left to plan the affair if you get engaged right now, so for those considering a proposal piece (or needing a hint to hand to your beloved), here is a selection of dazzling and enchanting engagement rings from some of the genre's most distinguished designers. ''We are noticing more women looking for new interpretations of the solitaire,'' said Keeley Smith Cabot, the boutique director of Cartier Fifth Avenue. The brand's popular d'Amour ring features a stone and a circular pavé motif symbolizing eternal love . Harry Winston, which introduced the made-for-engagements Belle by Harry Winston collection last year, is seeing a similar trend: its new solitaire is simply dizzying (in the best way), flanked by pavé diamonds in a modernized quatrefoil setting."

She was born on November 18, 1921, the youngest of four daughters born to the late Edgar I. Williams and the late Hulda Gustafva Olson Williams. The girls grew up in Rutherford, NJ. Christina attended Smith College and graduated in the class of 1943. While at Smith on traditional ""Mountain Day"" she traveled from Northampton to Williamstown, MA, the site of Williams College, where she met her future husband, James Erwin Koegel. Following college, she was working at Gibbs & Cox, ship architects, in Manhattan, while Jim Koegel was an attorney in the same city at Dwight, Harris, Koegel & Caskey (now Clifford Chance). When she was called upon to fill in a bridge foursome at the apartment of Jim Koegel's parents, the friendship rekindled. Eventually, on September 20, 1946, they were married in the chapel of St. Bartholomew's Church. Three children were born of this marriage, all three at Presbyterian Hospital. The first child was Christina Rae Koegel, who is now Christina Granrud in Kalispell, Montana, and the mother of two grandchildren, Philip and Jennifer Granrud. The second child was Sarah Nilsson Koegel, who lives in the Armonk home. The third child was James Arnold Koegel, who resides with his wife, May in the town of Bedford. The evening of November 19, 1954 was expected to be a festive occasion. The Koegel family planned to have dinner out and then attend a premier showing of the 20th Century Fox film Desiree at the old Roxy theatre. Unfortunately, Christina began to feel ill and her back ached badly. As a result she was taken to Columbia Presbyterian Hospital and was diagnosed with polio and spent three months in the Harkness Pavilion. Ironically, during her time at the hospital the announcement was made that Dr. Jonas Salk had developed the vaccine that would put an end to the scourge of polio. But this beautiful woman was determined to resist the disease and she fought mightily to regain strength in her legs and back. With great fortitude and spirit, and Sarah's good care, she was able to serve in many activities, including the Board and Executive Committee of Northern Westchester Hospital and active member of the Board of the VNA of Husdon Valley for many years. Jim predeceased Christina three years ago. A private service will be held for her at the Amawalk Cemetery, next to Jim."

I have been photographing several of them for decades, but they don't necessarily know one another. Last week, free-spirited dressers created an amazing sight at 8:45 a.m. while on their way to work: top right, from left, Marjorie Stern, Timothy John, Andrew Mukamal, Tziporah Salamon and David Don D Sealey. Ms. Stern is a grandmother and a retailer; her signature is multiple scarves and necklaces. Mr. John, an artist, has this philosophy: ''I refuse to be defined by other people's limitations.'' He wears clothes upside down and inside out, often demonstrating on the spot. Mr. Mukamal, 24, who works in fashion media, is the Beau Brummell of the future, mixing avant-garde designers with bravado. Ms. Salamon bikes to work in antique Asian and Matisse-inspired textiles.

2012-07-29T00:00:00Z,"''WHAT is the city but its people?'' a lowly plebeian asks in ''CORIOLANUS,'' suddenly feeling the power of being part of the multitudes. So it seems appropriate that Shakespeare's tragedy of war, politics and mass appeal in ancient Rome is being taken to the streets in this summer of a presidential election year. Or specifically, to a parking lot on the Lower East Side. That's where the Drilling Company is presenting ''Coriolanus'' as part of its city-conscious Shakespeare in the Park(ing) Lot series. (It once spun ''Julius Caesar'' into a power struggle within an urban school system.) Directed by Hamilton Clancy, who says he sees parallels between Shakespeare's angry Roman commoners and the Occupy movements, this open-air ''Coriolanus'' must expect to vie with not only the elements but also cars in search of a berth, giving special resonance to the idea of ''traffic of the stage.'' Arash Mokhtar plays the title role of a charismatic leader widely perceived as too aloof to hold onto popular support. Not that there's anyone like that in our line of vision these days.

Beyond that, I think this is a problem of form. In journalism, if your neighborhood isn't being populated with cool shops and young, single people, it's a ghetto suffering from decades of societal neglect. If it actually is being populated by all the pretty people, it's an enclave that we worry is losing its sense of identity. . . . The question of how different areas of a city develop or don't is an interesting one. I just don't like the assumption that everyone wants areas to develop the same way. A lot of us just want things like safety and decent schools not to be considered luxury goods. TA-NEHISI COATES, posted on theatlantic.com"

But the five Americans who have said for weeks they would win gold here dared not celebrate. Instead, they huddled together after besting teams from Japan and China -- favorites to win medals here -- and reminded themselves that first place at that point meant nothing. None of the qualifying scores carryover to Monday's team final, in which eight teams will square off for the first gymnastics gold medal of the London Games. A new day will give some teams, including the defending Olympic champion Chinese, a chance to redeem themselves after struggling during qualifying. And the Americans, careful lest they become complacent, are keenly aware of that."

2012-07-29T00:00:00Z,"IT'S easy to dismiss the ''Step Up'' movie franchise as simply another sugary confection aimed at teenagers. And make no mistake, it is, first and foremost, just that. The four films, which began in 2006, follow the same basic plotline: an attractive underdog uses dance to fit in and achieve. The first three installments -- ''Step Up,'' ''Step Up 2: The Streets'' and ''Step Up 3D'' -- were increasingly over the top in tricky moves, use of flying hair and shots of impossibly toned abs. The latest version, ''Step Up Revolution,'' released on July 27, follows the template. Set in Miami and starring Kathryn McCormick and Ryan Guzman, and directed by a first-timer, Scott Speer, it makes use of one of the latest dance trends: the flash mob. The movie also nods gently at the Occupy movement, as the young dancers take on a not-so-scary hotel developer (Peter Gallagher) representing corporate America. (At one point Ms. McCormick's character says, ''Enough performance art, time for protest art.'') But beyond the fluff the ''Step Up'' movies have grossed more than $424 million worldwide, according to Box Office Mojo, and spawned many careers. Melissa Rosenberg went on to write the ''Twilight'' films on the strength of her ''Step Up'' screenplay. The director Jon M. Chu was handed the reins of the Justin Bieber movie while Channing Tatum, a star at the box office this year, was introduced in ''Step Up.'' Julie Bloom spoke with some of them about their experiences; here are excerpts."

2012-07-29T00:00:00Z,"Gathered now in London, they are out to make the fun and games of the Olympics into something more, to take you beyond yourself, to lift you with a performance that is graceful or muscular or gymnastic or maybe even -- for here the bar is highest -- unforgettable. We are talking about sportswriters, a famously shopworn and bibulous lot whose calling the novelist Richard Ford, himself a former sportswriter, lamented in his novel ''The Sportswriter,'' as ''more like being a businessman, or an old-fashioned traveling salesman with a line of novelty household items, than being a genuine writer ... there is very little that is ever genuinely creative to it at all.'' Yet so often, the greatest spur to the imagination is limitation. What Mr. Ford's sportswriter overlooked is that for really good writers, sports offers an opportunity to express all the pleasure and passion of life. I spent four and half years as a young reporter at Sports Illustrated, in the company of many fine writers and editors. All of them knew that the world considered sports to be of modest significance. And yet they also observed how much time and emotion people invested in sports and saw that sports mattered in ways that transcended the games. They took some credit for this. When I left to write books, the first one about sports, I continued to think about my privileged apprenticeship -- about what sportswriters do to make the unimportant feel absolutely urgent."
2012-07-29T00:00:00Z,"THE pairing of two current dance stars -- the choreographer and performer JONAH BOKAER and ballet's ''it'' boy, David Hallberg -- seemed almost too good to be true when it was first announced for this year's Jacob's Pillow festival. And it turns out that it was. Mr. Hallberg is injured, and Mr. Bokaer's ''Curtain,'' a collaboration with the visual artist Daniel Arsham, will take a different shape at its Pillow premiere on Wednesday. It's no less worth seeing, though. Mr. Bokaer's latest works have been striking for both their originality and their aesthetic impact, and the collaboration with Mr. Arsham promises a dramatic visual setting, with cast fiberglass molds that will melt during the performance, offering changing shapes as a living sculptural counterpoint to the dance. For the last-minute changes to the work obliged by Mr. Hallberg's injury, Mr. Bokaer has turned to Adam Weinert and James McGinn, dancers who have worked with him frequently, using them in the work's second half, ''Les Innocents,'' while performing alone in the opening section. 8:15 p.m. Wednesday to Saturday, Doris Duke Theater, Becket, Mass., (413) 243-0745, jacobspillow.org; $35 to 38."

Mr. Daisey is, of course, referring to the controversy that erupted last spring over his popular, polemical solo show, in which he exposed the dire conditions workers were subjected to at the factories in China where Apple products - and much of the rest of the world's electronics - are manufactured."
2012-07-30T00:00:00Z,"While the onscreen versions of the Marvel Comics superheroes are racking up dollars at the box office, their printed incarnations are commanding premium prices at the auction block, too. An illustration of Spider-Man that ran on the cover of one of the wall-crawler's comic book adventures from 1990 was sold on Thursday for more than $650,000, while 1960s comics containing the first appearances of that publisher's Avengers and X-Men teams each sold for six-figure prices. The auction house Heritage Auctions said that the original cover artwork from Amazing Spider-Man No. 328, drawn by Todd McFarlane and depicting Spidey as he lifts the Hulk over his head (and smashes him into his logo) had been sold for $657,250. The company said this was the highest auction price ever paid for a piece of comic-book art; another illustration by Mr. McFarlane drawn for the cover of Spider-Man No. 1, a series published in the 1990s, was sold at this same auction for $358,500."

2012-07-30T00:00:00Z,"8 P.M. (MSG) DOG DAY AFTERNOON (1975) A double bill celebrates the collaboration between the actor Al Pacino and the director Sidney Lumet, starting with this crime drama about a first-time crook whose plan to rob a Brooklyn bank to pay for the sex-change operation of his lover (Chris Sarandon) goes awry. The film won an Oscar for best original screenplay and was nominated for best picture. Also nominated, among others, were Mr. Pacino (above, with Penny Allen), Mr. Sarandon and Mr. Lumet. The film is Mr. Lumet's ''most accurate, most flamboyant New York movie -- that consistently vital and energetic Lumet genre that includes 'The Pawnbroker' and 'Serpico' and exists entirely surrounded by (but always separate from) the rest of his work,'' Vincent Canby wrote in The New York Times. ''Mr. Lumet's New York movies are as much aspects of the city's life as they are stories of the city's life.'' In ''Serpico'' (1973), at 10:30, Mr. Pacino, in another Oscar-nominated role, plays the real New York City police detective Frank Serpico, who put his life on the line in the early 1970s to reveal graft and corruption within the department to David Burnham, a reporter for The New York Times. 9 A.M. (MTV) DARIA The network's Retro Mania programming block wraps up with three hours of this 1997 ''Beavis and Butt-Head'' spinoff centered on the sharp-tongued intellectual Daria Morgendorffer (voiced by Tracy Grandstaff).

2012-07-31T00:00:00Z,"8:30 P.M. (TV5Monde) LA FLEUR DU MAL (THE FLOWER OF EVIL) (2003) A privileged provincial French family deals with murder, sexual complications, betrayal and guilt in this drama from Claude Chabrol. Nathalie Baye stars as Anne, a would-be politician whose stepson, François (Benoît Magimel), returns home from Chicago at a critical point in her mayoral run. Mélanie Doutey plays his beautiful stepsister, to whom he is oddly drawn. Bernard Le Coq, above with Ms. Baye, is Anne's philandering second husband (and first cousin), into whose arms she was thrown when their first spouses were killed in a car crash. Mr. Chabrol's son Thomas plays Anne's soft-spoken, ambitious and sinister assistant. And Suzanne Flon is Tante Line, the gentle and generous aunt acquitted of the murder of her father, a collaborator during the German occupation, several decades earlier -- information that surfaces in an anonymous smear campaign against Anne. ''The movie inevitably drops what the director may think of as a pearl: 'The Flower of Evil' draws off all that is good in the earth, leaving nothing behind but remorse,'' Elvis Mitchell wrote in The New York Times. ''The film often seems trapped in barren soil, too, though Ms. Flon's delicately nuanced misery blooms in the dust.'' 5 P.M. (Fox Movie Channel) JARHEAD (2005) Jake Gyllenhaal, right, portrays Swoff, the alter ego of Anthony Swofford, whose memoir about his time in the Marines inspired this drama from Sam Mendes about the terror and thrill of serving in the Persian Gulf war of 1991 -- not to mention the tedium and boredom. ''Are we ever going to kill anyone?'' a young Marine asks toward the movie's end. Peter Sarsgaard plays Troy, a tightly wound Midwesterner who becomes Swoff's shooting partner and closest friend. ''It is a movie that walks up to some of the most urgent and painful issues of our present circumstance, clears its throat loudly and, with occasional flourishes of impressive rhetoric, says nothing,'' A. O. Scott wrote in The Times."

He was 81 and lived in Mt. Kisco, NY. Mr. O'Neil died of complications related to ALS. In business, Mr. O'Neil led the trust department for the Manufacturers Hanover Bank before moving to Hartford to serve as Chairman of the Finance Committee and Board Member of The Travelers Companies. He left that position in 1984 to launch a private investment firm in partnership with Alan Greenspan, Greenspan O'Neil Inc. In 1986, he became chairman of the financial consulting company, O'Neil Associates. Rory O'Neil served on a wide range of corporate and nonprofit boards, including Beckman Coulter, AMBAC, Colt Manufacturing, Fort Dearborn Income Securities, Brinson Trust Co., Memorial Drive Trust, and the California Institute of the Arts. He was a Chartered Financial Analyst and was trustee and past president of the Institute of Chartered Financial Analysts. He chaired the State of Connecticut Investment Advisory Committee from 1988-91 and he served for two decades on the Investment Committee of the Hartford Foundation for Public Giving. He was a director of the Corporation for Independent Living in Hartford and director (1982-93) and past chairman of the Connecticut Trust for Historic Preservation. But, in many ways, his proudest achievement was the role he played in the restoration of the Connecticut River waterfront in Hartford. Now, more than three-quarter of a million people each year visit the chain of parks, walkways and boathouses created by Riverfront Recapture, which The Hartford Courant called ""one of the state's most successful non-profits."" Mr. O'Neil maintained his family home in Mt. Kisco, NY, with his wife, Nancy. However, when he joined Travelers in 1977, he and his wife became pioneers in the revitalization of downtown Hartford and were active in the restoration of a number of historic properties, including 20 Charter Oak Place. In 1985 the O'Neils restored Simsbury 1820 House in Simsbury, CT, and were owners until 1997. Mr. O'Neil was a devoted husband, father and grandfather. He married Nancy Galante in 1950. Together, they had six children: Brian, Sarah, Tim, Kevin, John and Anne. In addition to his wife and children, he is survived by 13 grandchildren and his brothers, Terry and Tom.

2012-07-31T00:00:00Z,"The two Hobbit movies will become three -- so said Peter Jackson, their director, Monday morning in a posting on his Facebook page. ''It has been an unexpected journey indeed, and in the words of Professor Tolkien himself, 'a tale that grew in the telling,' '' wrote Mr. Jackson, right, who said he would use the three-movie format to ''tell more of the tale.'' ''The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey,'' the first of what will now be three films based on ''The Hobbit,'' by J. R. R. Tolkien, remains set for release by Warner Brothers and its New Line Cinema unit, along with Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer, on Dec. 14. The second film is scheduled for release in December 2013. The third can be expected in the summer of 2014, Warner said in a statement. In an appearance this month at the Comic-Con International fan convention Mr. Jackson explained that some material from the related ''Lord of the Rings'' cycle, and a small bit of invention that added a stronger feminine presence to Tolkien's Hobbit story, had expanded its cinematic potential."

2012-07-31T00:00:00Z,"Soldiers in World War II stuck the pinups on their lockers while female fans swooned over the photos of Frank Sinatra and Gary Cooper. Now Movie Star News, the company that sold classic prints of celebrities, has sold its entire collection of Hollywood photographs, The Associated Press reported. It will be auctioned off later. Today pictures of stars can be downloaded in a heartbeat but in 1939, when Irving Klaw started the business from his Manhattan bookstore, he discovered a huge market for studio photographs. Mr. Klaw essentially invented the pinup and turned the model Bettie Page into the genre's queen with images of her acting out bondage and sadomasochistic themes. ''He noticed that kids were tearing out the pictures of the movie stars, so he decided to sell their pictures rather than the books,'' said Ira Kramer, above, who took over the business from his mother and his uncle, Mr. Klaw. Stuart Scheinman, co-owner of Entertainment Collectibles in Las Vegas, bought the collection, which consists primarily of images made between 1939 and '79. There are original prints and negatives of Marlon Brando, Bette Davis and the Three Stooges as well as scenes from ''The Godfather,'' ''Citizen Kane'' and ''Gone With the Wind.'' He said that the lot, which is being handled by Guernsey's auction house, could be worth as much as $150 million."

2012-08-01T00:00:00Z,"6:30 P.M. (HBO2) STARDUST MEMORIES (1980) In this Fellini-esque comedy from Woody Allen, a director (Mr. Allen, above with Jessica Harper) faces an existential crisis when he attends a festival of his films and recounts his life and the loves (Charlotte Rampling, Ms. Harper and Marie-Christine Barrault) who inspired his work. ''As photographed by Gordon Willis and played by a cast of excellent though muted principals, 'Stardust Memories' is starkly handsome and imbued with a very special bravado,'' Janet Maslin wrote in The New York Times. ''This isn't Mr. Allen's most successful film -- 'Annie Hall' was that. It isn't his most earnest experiment -- 'Interiors' was far more so. It isn't even his first brush with fatigue or uncertainty, since there were traces of these things in 'Manhattan.' But 'Stardust Memories' is his most provocative film thus far and perhaps his most revealing.'' 8 A.M. (USA) STATE OF PLAY (2009) Cal McAffrey (Russell Crowe) is a scruffy reporter for a Washington newspaper; Della Frye (Rachel McAdams) is its fresh-faced political-gossip blogger. Together they try to get at the truth behind the death of a researcher who worked for a congressman (Ben Affleck) who is digging up dirt on a mysterious securities contractor. The congressman happens to be Cal's college roommate and best friend. Was it really an accident? Writing in The New York Times, A. O. Scott said this thriller, adapted from the 2003 television series on BBC, ''is both shallower and muddier than its cleareyed source.'' In ''The Interpreter'' (2005), at 10:30, Nicole Kidman portrays an idealistic United Nations interpreter who believes she has overheard a plot to assassinate a dictator (Earl Cameron). Sean Penn is a federal agent sent to protect her and to investigate. ''This kind of movie, stuffed with intimations of faraway strife and people in suits talking frantically on cellphones and walkie-talkies, is conventionally described as a political thriller, but 'The Interpreter' is as apolitical as it is unthrilling,'' Mr. Scott wrote about this film from Sydney Pollack. Still, he said, the United Nations building in Manhattan ''is beautifully shot, both from without and within.''"

Wiggins spent most of Saturday's road race in a supporting role for his teammate Mark Cavendish, but Wiggins is a master of time trials like Wednesday's 44-kilometer race. His main competition figures to be the reigning Olympic time trial champion, Fabian Cancellara of Switzerland, who is recovering from a shoulder injury sustained in a crash during Saturday's road race. If Wiggins wins a medal, it will be his seventh, making him Britain's most decorated Olympian.

He succeeds Tom Sherak, who stepped down on reaching a term limit after three years as president of the Academy, which presents the Oscars and oversees programs that promote film education and awareness. Mr. Koch, a film producer of long experience, had been widely viewed as a likely successor to Mr. Sherak. He had served recently as the group's first vice president, and is entering his ninth year on the board of governors. Because the president must be a governor and governors only serve for nine years, Mr. Koch will be limited to one year as president."

2012-08-02T00:00:00Z,"The New Yorker this week is publishing a story by F. Scott Fitzgerald, ''Thank You for the Light,'' that it rejected three-quarters of a century ago. Turning the story down in 1936, the editors said that it was ''altogether out of the question'' and added, ''It seems to us so curious and so unlike the kind of thing we associate with him and really too fantastic.'' It's not hard to see why they thought so. The story, though lovely in its odd way, is a long way from ''Winter Dreams'' or ''The Diamond as Big as the Ritz.'' ''Thank You for the Light,'' which Fitzgerald's grandchildren discovered while going through his papers, is just a vignette -- only a page long -- almost fablelike and written in a pared-down style that, at the end especially, seems more Hemingway than Fitzgerald. According to Deborah Treisman, The New Yorker's fiction editor, the Fitzgerald scholar James West thought it seemed ''almost Chekhovian'' and suggested to the grandchildren that they give the magazine another crack at it."

Dr. McIntosh first joined Harlem Hospital Center in 1984 when the department of dentistry was a division under General Surgery. Under his leadership and direction, he brought dentistry to departmental status at Harlem Hospital Center, where he was Director of Dentistry for many years. The resolution has been approved to name the Harlem Hospital Center Department of Dentistry as the ""Dr. James E. McIntosh Department of Dentistry"" in recognition of his dedication on behalf of the Harlem community for over 40 years. In the late 1980s, in cooperation with Dean Emeritus Allan J. Formicola of the School of Dental & Oral Surgery (now the College of Dental Medicine), Dr. McIntosh started the minority specialty program, which trained over 30 minority specialists. During his career, he mentored over a hundred minority general dentists, who mostly returned to practice in underserved areas of the country. Funeral services are as follows: Funeral: Thursday, August 2, 2012 10:00am, Abyssinian Baptist Church, 132 Odell Clark Pl. (138 Street), New York City (212) 862-7474. On behalf of the Faculty of Dental Medicine, we extend our heartfelt condolences to his entire family. A memorial scholarship fund has been established for Dr. James E. McIntosh at the College of Dental Medicine at Columbia University. The fund will be used to provide financial aid to under- represented postdoctoral dental students. If you wish to make a contribution to the fund in Dr. McIntosh's memory, please make your check payable to Columbia University College of Dental Medicine, with a notation that it is for the Dr. James E. McIntosh Scholarship Fund. It can be mailed to the address below: Office of Development Columbia University College of Dental Medicine, 630 West 168th St. Box 20, New York, NY 10032 (212) 342-5612.

2012-08-02T00:00:00Z,"Our environment, we're told by climate scientists, is fragile. But are children learning that their immediate natural environment -- the trees, grass and dirt that surround us -- is fragile, too? Several educators, after observing years of kids being taught to ''look, but don't touch,'' have argued this summer that many programs and policies designed to protect the natural world are actually preventing a new generation from developing an interest in it. ''We don't play with nature,'' one blogger overheard a counselor tell a camper who had picked up a branch. The environmental educator David Sobel, who wrote ''Look, Don't Touch: The Problem with Environmental Education'' in the July-August issue of Orion magazine, says this is an attitude that's all too common. He has seen wildflower programs where the children see more PowerPoint slides than flowers, and arboretums trying to encourage a love of trees in urban children while refusing to let them climb even the biggest and sturdiest ones. But allowing children to explore the natural world is what creates children who love that world enough to take care of it. Climbing trees, digging holes, collecting rocks and catching tadpoles are time-tested childhood traditions that haven't broken nature yet, aren't likely to. Isn't a little tough love of our outdoor centers and nature trails worth it? A childhood spent climbing and hiking and wading leads to a fresh generation of parents who will encourage their children to do the same. KJ DELL'ANTONIA"

(Cinemax) ALMOST FAMOUS (2000) The director Cameron Crowe looks back on his career as a teenage music journalist in this coming-of-age story about his fictionalized alter ego, William Miller (Patrick Fugit, above), a 15-year-old from San Diego who makes a fairy-tale ascent from nerdy schoolboy to Rolling Stone reporter. Frances McDormand portrays William's protective mother, a college professor; Zooey Deschanel plays his rebellious older sister; Philip Seymour Hoffman is the critic Lester Bangs; Billy Crudup is Russell Hammond, the lead guitarist of the band Stillwater, to whom William is especially drawn; and Kate Hudson is Penny Lane, the ringleader of a troupe of liberated groupies called the Band-Aids. ''We don't have intercourse,'' she says. ''We inspire the music.'' Mr. Crowe ''may be the least cynical director working in Hollywood today,'' A. O. Scott wrote in The New York Times. He adds: ''Rock 'n' roll is not always about being nice. 'Almost Famous' overflows with sympathy for the devil but glides over the demonic power and decadent excess that remain integral to the music's allure and central to the rock star lifestyle.'' Ms. Hudson and Ms. McDormand earned Oscar nominations; Mr. Crowe won for best screenplay. 5:45 A.M. (NBC Sports) 2012 LONDON OLYMPICS The American women's field hockey team meets Australia.

Some swimmers dance or showboat as they walk across the pool's deck. Most acknowledge the crowd with a wave. But many more strut out coolly toward their lanes wearing headphones.

2012-08-03T00:00:00Z,"KINZER--Bernard H.,passed away in his sleep July 30, 2012. The middle son of nine children, he was born August 22, 1917 to Myrtle Hess and Kenneth Kinzer in Utica, Illinois. His early education was in the Utica public schools. He graduated Wheaton College, Moody Bible Institute, and was ordained at Northern Baptist Theological Seminary in 1944. He enlisted in the U.S. Navy serving as Navy Chaplain on transports in the Pacific. After the war, he graduated from Columbia University with a Masters Degree in Labor Relations and spent 25 years in the business world, as management consultant for Columbia Engineering and Computer Sciences. In 1972 he gave up the business world to devote his energies to community service as Executive Director at Hartley House, a Community Center on West 46th Street in NYC. Active in professional associations, he was on Boards of several foundations, such as Perly Fund and Boys Scouts of America. At Hartley House, he managed to get New York City to plant trees on 46th Street between 8th and 10th Avenues, one street known as Restaurant Row, the other on which Hartley House is located. He was a member of the community organization, which helped bring about middle-income housing, Manhattan House, at West 42 Street. He retired in 1985 and became a resident of Florida, living in Key West and spending summer months in Pawling, New York. He is survived by his long time friend Joseph J (Joe) Famularo, also of Key West, Florida and Pawling, New York, and a younger sister, Mrs. John O'Farrell, of Tallahassee, Florida. As one of nine children brought up on an Illinois farm, he felt then as he did all his life, in the traditional work ethic that if you work hard you will realize the American dream. He gave his time to help immigrant people learn English, he encouraged youth to advance their educational careers, and he loved to roll up his sleeves and get his hands dirty by working hard in vegetable and flower gardens. In lieu of flowers, please make a contribution, if you wish, to any of the following: Hartley House, 413 West 46th St., New York, NY, 10036; Grace Lutheran School, 2713 Flagler Ave., Key West, FL, 33040; Boy Scouts (Smith-Johnson Scout Reservation) P.O.

A life-long and vehement New Yorker with a passion for art and for all things Italian, for much of her life Mary and her husband, Alan Englander, lived to the hilt the City life of culture, humor, and outspoken liberal thinking, with regular excursions to Europe and beyond. An elegant, indefatigable walker, Mary (with Alan) had an extraordinary eye for contemporary art, reflected in the personal collection that gave them continuous joy. As along as was possible, Sunday mornings found them at the Met, weekdays at galleries and theater, and Sunday evenings babysitting on Riverside Drive, cooking the filet mignon and haricots verts they felt compelled to import from the Upper East Side for their grandsons. Equally capable of overwhelming empathy and of judgment, of defending and laughing at herself, Mary will be missed by her daughter Diane Englander, son-in-law Mark Underberg, and grandsons Andrew Englander Underberg and James Englander Underberg, for whom she was the world's most dedicated and delighted grandmother.

Gregory Mankiw, a former Bush White House aide and an adviser to Mitt Romney. He had stated that a typical family in the lowest fifth of the income scale receives $3 in government benefits for every $1 earned, and that even the middle fifth receive slightly more than they pay in taxes. Mr. Mankiw subsequently noted on his blog that the data he used, from the Congressional Budget Office, includes state and local benefits as well as federal benefits, but reflects only federal taxes. He said correcting this inconsistency might change his conclusions, but that the budget office does not provide the data he would need to know for sure."

2012-08-05T00:00:00Z,"Play ball! The enduring cry is heard each summer in every corner of this country. But who remembers those days between the wars in France, when the same cri de coeur was heard in the fallow endive fields of Bilignin, where Gertrude and Alice shared their passion for baseball with their circle of femmes de lettres? They played hard, these girls of summer. The team was known for its rowdy, cerebral game. Trash talk among the women, especially Dottie and Zelda, was legendary, and often unsettled opposing players. They called their team Le Gang Stein. Why not? She ran the team the way she would later run Vichy bureaucrats off her property, with toughness and a gimlet eye. And what could be more terrifying to a batter than staring into Gertrude's eyes from only 60 feet away, knowing you were about to take a fastball under your lovely cheekbone? What we know is how much these women loved the game. Gert herself said it best in ''Girls Just Wanna Play Ball!,'' her passionate paean to the sport she so loved: a strike is a strike one is a strike two is a strike three youre out we win!"

2012-08-05T00:00:00Z,"WHO doesn't have a health care horror story? Bad diagnosis. Fifteen-hour wait in the emergency room. Nurse who seems unable to hear the call button. But even patients who have had surgical implements left inside them by inept doctors will feel as if they were only mildly inconvenienced compared with the unfortunates who find themselves at ''CHILDRENSHOSPITAL,'' the ludicrously dysfunctional medical center imagined by Rob Corddry and developed into a Web series and then a television series on Adult Swim. The TV version, which is made in 15-minute episodes, begins its fourth season at midnight on Thursday, and the situation at the hospital is grim. An airborne virus that causes amnesia has run amok in the hospital, with only Mr. Corddry's character, a lecherous clown (and doctor) named Blake, unaffected. ''Clowns can't get amnesia,'' he explains, ''though we would like to forget Cirque du Soleil.'' The series, whose cast includes Henry Winkler, Malin Akerman and Megan Mullally, has a knack for exploiting the conventions built up by decades' worth of medical dramas to cram a lot into its brief episodes. No need to burn a lot of time explaining how that virus is moving through the hospital; a quick shot of an air duct will do."

2012-08-05T00:00:00Z,"Because of an editing error, a news analysis article on July 29 about variations in record-setting across Olympic events misspelled the surname of the world record holder for the long jump. He is Mike Powell, not Lowell. The article misstated the Olympic record in the women's 100-meter dash, set in 1988 by Florence Griffith Joyner. It is 10.62 seconds (10.54 seconds was her wind-aided time). It was not the case that no other woman has come within 0.2 of a second of her Olympic mark; several women have. The article also referred imprecisely to the holder of the world record in the men's swimming 1,500-meter freestyle. While Grant Hackett set the record for the short course (25-meter pool) in 2001, Sun Yang broke Hackett's 2001 record for the long course (50-meter pool) in 2011."

He had a decent spring and he showed what you see: he has speed, he puts the ball in play and can run a ball down in the outfield for you. He's been tremendous for us and given us another dynamic.''"

He lived a full, happy and complete life with family, friends, campers and students for all of whom he had the deepest affection and respect. In return, they responded with their love and loyalty. As a G(overnment)-Man he helped to establish the Department of Labor and its first minimum wage. As a high school teacher of 35 years, he educated 100's of students in their chosen subject. As a camp owner and a man of wisdom, he was a character builder, teaching so many how to live a rewarding, healthy, honorable life. With sage advice sewn in sermons called ""Potatoes,"" ""Red Ribbon,"" and ""Quid Pro Quo"" his campers were forever encouraged to reach for the stars, to have initiative, to fully complete a job, and to always remember to give whenever you receive. We hope all who knew the Silver Fox will keep him in their thoughts, appreciate his teachings and carry on his legacy. The Nordan Family, 433 Plaza Real, Suite 275, Boca Raton, Fla. 33432."

2012-08-05T00:00:00Z,"Matt Bai misrepresents the most fundamental consequence of the Citizens United ruling: that it's a new system of corruption. For the first time in more than 100 years, corporations can now legally spend unlimited funds directly from their treasuries to influence elections. The vehicles for this corruption are super PACs and their companion organizations: 501(c)(4) nonprofit corporations, or so-called social-welfare groups. These groups are now capable of accepting unlimited corporate funds and running napalm-negative television ads that advocate against the election of specific candidates, often without a scrap of disclosure. A new analysis from the Center for Public Integrity shows that companies, including some Fortune 500 corporations, have already given nearly $24 million to conservative super PACs this cycle. This is a result of Citizens United. Because of new Republican objections to disclosure laws (legislation they supported in the 1990s), we will most likely never know which corporations are participating. The article also neglects another mechanism for laundering corporate money: the Chamber of Commerce, which many predict will spend well north of $50 million dollars on this year's election, all from corporations. And while elected officials and members of a president's administration are legally restricted to soliciting a maximum of $5,000 for super PACs and 501(c)(4)s, they are free to attend lavish fund-raisers for these groups, which are often run by their own former staff members and strategists."

Countless bands from the 1990s indie-rock explosion poured passion, intelligence and sweat into songs that were strong enough to stir club audiences and convince a label that they were worth recording. Then they called it quits, leaving behind admiring fans. Two of those bands have reunited and perform in New York this week: BRAID, which had its first run from 1993 to 1999, and PLANES MISTAKEN FOR STARS, which persevered from 1997 to 2008. In different ways each band rerouted the churn, crash and throat-tearing vocals of hardcore toward songs that were more changeable, more vulnerable, more melodic yet even more gnarled. These aren't victory-lap reunions on the scale of Pavement or the Pixies. They're club dates for devoted audiences.

2012-08-05T00:00:00Z,"AMERICA is such a marvelously big and unruly country that to talk about ''American dance'' as any one thing is at best a deeply silly endeavor. But we can talk of tendencies and traditions, of styles and sensibilities. We can talk of choreographers who seem particularly American, knowing that there are myriad Americas in play at any one moment. For many people the dances of Trey McIntyre speak to a certain idea about this land. Talking to me a few years ago about his version of America he said, ''For me it's the heartland.'' He added, ''There's a sense of the vastness of the plains,'' and a rootedness. Both of these qualities, of space and place, are apparent in the dances he makes for the TREY McINTYRE PROJECT. His works often muse on American themes as well, though his starting points and frameworks can be deeply personal. This week his troupe, based in Boise, Idaho, is on the East Coast, performing two works: ''Leatherwing Bat'' (2008), which uses the music of Peter, Paul and Mary, and ''Ladies and Gentle Men,'' a premiere based on the 1970s television program ''Free to Be ...

Businesses flourished in this district brimming with stately architectural styles, from Richardson Romanesque to High Victorian. But the devastating floods of 1951 set into motion decades of decline, and crime in the area went on the upswing. It took the birth of the North Topeka Arts District, known locally as NOTO, in 2008 -- thanks to an effort by community leaders and property owners, and fueled by an infusion of private money -- to stimulate a dramatic turnaround. This two-block stretch of North Kansas Avenue is now a mélange of art galleries and ateliers, cafes and boutique and antique emporiums all housed in historic buildings. Things are especially lively on First Fridays, when many shops and galleries are open late, and an outdoor market, open 6 to 8:30 p.m., offers antiques, crafts, live performances and noshes.

A fairy tale, a love story and a political allegory in one, the film ends in the late 1950s and is informed by the 1953 coup d'état that toppled the government of Prime Minister Mohammed Mossadegh. There is even a significant character named Irâne, who symbolizes the loss of the dream of democracy."

It ends Aug. 23 with the second of two screenings of ''3 Million,'' a joyous soccer documentary about the Uruguayan team's journey to South Africa to compete for the World Cup. Of special interest are two music-oriented films. In ''Songs'' (''As Canções''), the 79-year-old Brazilian documentarian Eduardo Coutinho asks 18 ordinary people from Rio de Janeiro to name their favorite Brazilian song, sing a fragment, and explain its personal importance. The film underscores the centrality of music in the emotional lives of Brazilians. Andrés Wood's ''Violeta Went to Heaven'' is a fictionalized biography of the Chilean singer-songwriter, ethnomusicologist and visual artist Violeta Parra (Francisca Gavilán), who was a pioneer of Chile's folk music revival known as Nueva Canción. The movie, constructed around a 1962 television interview with Parra, who was born in poverty in 1917 and committed suicide in 1967, includes about 20 of her songs. The movie was Chile's official submission for the 2012 Oscar for a foreign-language film. filmlinc.com."

2012-08-05T00:00:00Z,"OVER the past three decades the identical twins Stephen and Timothy Quay, better known as the QUAY BROTHERS, have created some of the strangest and most beguiling films in the history of experimental cinema. Mixing puppets, antique dolls, stop-action animation, live acting with real people and haunting classical music, their movies sacrifice narrative lucidity for the associative logic of dreaming. In a style you might call Victorian Gothic Surrealism, they create worlds that time seems to have left behind, where dust and shadows pile up over forgotten secrets that are revealed only in tantalizing glimpses. The director Terry Gilliam rated their early masterpiece ''Street of Crocodiles'' (1986) one of the 10 best animated films ever. Even though their movies look as if they might have been made by reclusive madmen in a cobweb-festooned Eastern European attic, their career has been anything but hermetic. They have created music videos, opera sets and, most recently, a gripping, nonlinear, half-hour meditation on the collection of 19th-century medical curiosities owned by the Mütter Museum in Philadelphia. ''Quay Brothers: On Deciphering the Pharmacist's Prescription for Lip-Reading Puppets'' is a full retrospective. Prepare for mind-bending magic and weirdness.

2012-08-05T00:00:00Z,"From the Star of the East we obtain further particulars respecting the proposed revival of the Olympus Games. The startling announcement that such a measure was in contemplation may have caused some readers of The Times to brush up their school-boy recollections by a hasty glance at the Classical Dictionary, and the anachronism may have struck them as no less singular than that the celebration should take place at Athens, instead of on the grassy banks of the river Alpheus in far-famed Olympia. Yet this is to be the sober fact. . . . The games are to be celebrated every four years, and to last eight days. During the festival, the agricultural products of the country and its manufacturers are to be placed on exhibition. . . . But to the evidences of material prosperity are to be added works of painting and sculpture and poetical effusions, which are likewise to be submitted to the inspection and judgment of crowds that are expected to assemble from all quarters to view the games. Horse and foot races, and trials of bodily strength, may, we presume, be expected to form part of the entertainment, and the stadium of Athens will become vocal, as in the Panathenaea of old, to the shouts of beholding multitudes.

''They were based on an old pair of Levis 501s -- I had been going to Cheap Jack's and buying old Levis that I would then alter -- that we had adjusted in terms of the fit,'' said Alex Gilbert Gaines, a founder of the brand. ''And we worked with a facility in Kentucky to get just the right wash.'' With a winning combination of slouch and leanness, they were one of the first high-priced jeans styles to go viral. But like a lot of denim brands that blossomed in the last years of the Clinton administration, Paper Denim faded away -- until July 25, when it made a reappearance via Instagram from a rooftop in Greenpoint, Brooklyn, where its spring look book was being shot and released to followers in real time."

One of the alleged shooters of young Lloyd Morgan was a student I had some 10 years ago in a special education public school program in the Bronx. The teachers, the counselors, the public school administrators did all they could for this child.....this is the result i.e. he will most likely be charged with homicide. Very upsetting.

The exuberant artist/educator, Louis Mendez, died peacefully at the Jacob Perlow Hospice Inpatient Unit at Beth Israel Medical Center in New York City, just two weeks shy of his 83rd birthday. Louis Ernest Mendez was born on the Lower East Side of Manhattan of Puerto Rican, Spanish and Irish heritage. He spent his early years in Spanish Harlem and his teenage years in Goshen, NY, where his high school teachers recognized his unusual talent in drawing and sculpture. Louis went on to earn BFA ('52) and MFA ('54) degrees from the New York State College of Ceramics at Alfred University, where he became a protege of Professors Charles Harder and Daniel Rhodes, influential figures in the mid-century American studio ceramics movement. After college, Louis was hired by fellow Alfred alumnus, David Gil, as the first designer at Bennington Potters in Vermont. He later worked as a designer at Lenox China in Trenton, NJ, before entering the field of education, teaching first at the Pratt Institute in Brooklyn, then at the Philadelphia College of Art, and ultimately at the Ohio State University in Columbus, where he was an Associate Professor of Art and Chairman of the Graduate Faculty in the Ceramics Department. Aside from these professorial appointments, he taught more casually, but with no less enthusiasm, at numerous venues, including New Jersey City University and the Ceramic Education Center (NJ), Brookfield Craft Center (CT), Art+Clay (NM), Valle de Bravo (MX), Juniata College, (PA), and with special joy at the 92nd Street Y 60+ Program in New York City. From the 1960s onward his output included no only pottery, but masks, wall-reliefs, mosaics, and free-standing sculptures both large and small. Louis developed his signature ""Spanish Handbuilding Technique,"" an approach to ceramic hand building that allowed construction and firing of large sculptural works in clay without the use of an armature, a development that helped to transform ceramics from ""craft"" to ""art."" Mendez exhibited in many important venues in the USA, including the Museum of Art and Design, the Museum of Contemporary Hispanic Art, Taller Boriqua, the Brooklyn Museum, the Everson Museum, the Columbus Gallery of Fine Arts, and the Silvermine Guild of Artists. International exhibitions include group shows at the Victoria and Albert Museum (London), the Internazionale Biennale dell' Arte Contemporanea (Florence, Italy), the Gangjin Festival (Korea), and a one person show at the Museo Regional Michoacano (Morelia, Mexico). His work is included in the collections of the Museum of Art and Design (New York), the ASU Museum at the Herberger Institute for Design + the Arts in Tempe (AZ), the Mint Museum of Craft & Design (North Carolina), the Columbia Museum of Art (SC), the Gangjin Ceramics Museum (South Korea), and the Schein-Joseph International Museum of Ceramic Art at Alfred University, among others. Louis is survived by his wife Dianne, son Aaron, daughter-in-law Mieko and two grandchildren; his sister Victoria Blanco-Alfiero; his sister and brother-in-law, Donna and David Dunning; three nephews and one niece. In lieu of flowers, the family asks friends to consider a donation to one of the following: Alfred University; send gift with a note stating that the gift is in memory of Louis Mendez to: University Relations, 1 Saxon Drive, Alfred University, Alfred NY 14802.

2012-08-05T00:00:00Z,"DETAILS have been scant about ''Heartless,'' the new play by SAM SHEPARD that begins an Off Broadway run this week, but for Shepard fans it hardly matters. It's new, and it's by the man who won a Pulitzer Prize in 1979 for ''Buried Child.'' In that play he dealt with submerged secrets, and in ''Heartless'' dark secrets are at issue too, but Mr. Shepard is not simply playing in an old sandbox here. This writer known for many a testosterone-fueled battle (see ''True West,'' ''The Tooth of Crime'' and others) has -- perhaps surprisingly -- written a play predominantly populated by female characters. In ''Heartless'' Julianne Nicholson (''This'') plays Sally, an Angeleno with hidden truths that are likely to come to light, prompted by the arrival of a stranger to her family home. The cast also includes Jenny Bacon, Gary Cole, Betty Gilpin and Lois Smith, whose many credits include Halie, the hypocritical mother in the 1996 Broadway production of ''Buried Child.'' The director is the very busy Daniel Aukin (''4000 Miles,'' ''The Bad and the Better''). Previews begin Tuesday, opens Aug. 27, Irene Diamond Stage at the Pershing Square Signature Center, 480 West 42nd Street, Clinton, (212) 244-7529, signaturetheatre.org; $25."

2012-08-06T00:00:00Z,"5 P.M. (Fox Movie Channel) WAG THE DOG (1997) Robert De Niro plays Conrad Brean, a government spin doctor who recruits a Hollywood producer (Dustin Hoffman, above left, with Anne Heche and Mr. De Niro) to help him create a fake war with Albania to distract the American public from discovering a presidential sex scandal. ''Made in the witty screwball spirit of a Preston Sturges comedy, and filmed so fast (in 29 days) that none of its bright spontaneity gets lost, 'Wag the Dog' essentially amounts to a huge inside joke,'' Janet Maslin wrote in The New York Times. Barry Levinson directed the movie from a script by David Mamet and Hilary Henkin, based on a book by Larry Beinhart. ''It's possible that viewers indifferent to political and media chicanery will miss some of the barbs here,'' Ms. Maslin wrote. ''But those same gags will fill savvier audiences with wicked glee.'' 10 A.M.

2012-08-06T00:00:00Z,"SAN JOSE, Calif. - Back in the early 1930s, a magician by the name of Horace Goldin went to court to defend his signature illusion: sawing a woman in half. Mr. Goldin filed a lawsuit against the R. J. Reynolds Tobacco Company for using this magic trick in an advertisement and explaining how it worked. According to an article in The New York Times from March 1933, Mr. Goldin, who had won a patent for the illusion a decade earlier, asserted that the ad had adversely affected his ability to get people to see his shows. He asked for $50,000 in damages. (That's about $865,000 in today's dollars.)"
2012-08-06T00:00:00Z,"LONDON - It's not easy being a professional athlete with an auto-immune disease, but the American tennis star Venus Williams is getting by with a little help from her sister Serena. On Sunday the Williams sisters returned to the All England Club, where last month they won their fifth Wimbledon doubles title, and secured their third Olympic women's doubles title with a 6-4, 6-4 victory against Andrea Hlavackova and Lucie Hradecka of the Czech Republic. The sisters' other Olympic doubles titles came in Sydney in 2000 and Beijing in 2008. They are the first to win the same Olympic tennis event three times.

2012-08-06T00:00:00Z,"Add ''Total Recall'' to the list of remakes that go thud. Sony, betting in part on advancements in visual effects and fond memories of the 1990 original, spent at least $200 million to make and market a new version starring Colin Farrell in the role Arnold Schwarzenegger made famous. But moviegoers weren't feeling it: ''Total Recall'' took in about $26 million at North American theaters over the weekend, a distant second behind ''The Dark Knight Rises,'' which was No. 1 for the third weekend in a row, with about $36.4 million in ticket sales ($354.6 million total over three weeks). The continued popularity of ''The Dark Knight Rises,'' a Warner Brothers release, may have hurt ''Total Recall.'' The London Olympics and continued skittishness following last month's theater shootings in Colorado may also have taken a toll. But ''Total Recall'' was also just not considered very good: audiences gave it a C-plus grade in exit polls. ''We performed in line with tracking and industry expectations,'' a Sony spokesman said, adding that the film did well in limited release overseas in spots like Malaysia and Taiwan."

He graduated from Brooklyn Technical High School in 1937, then attended night classes at the University of Connecticut, Storrs, while working at Pratt & Whitney and taking flying lessons during the day. In World War II, Lou served as a pilot in the Air Transport Command, ferrying bombers to London and leading an engineering squadron in the 9th Air Force. Upon his return from the war, Lou married his beloved wife, Marjory (Marj), a woman who herself loved flying. Their union lasted 66 exciting years. Lou and Marj built a successful business together, constructing over 700 homes, condominiums and apartments in Westchester County. In addition to flying, Lou loved cars and dogs. His auto collection spanned Plymouths to Porsches, as well as miniature gas-powered vehicles that his kids and grandkids drove on the private roads near his home at Sky Meadow Farm in Purchase. He adopted canines of all shapes and sizes, from poodles to wheaten terriers. He is survived by his beloved wife and two children: JoAnn (Jan) Vinikoor (Mark) of Harrison and Joel Simon (Rosemae) of Scarsdale. He is also survived by five grandchildren Jason Vinikoor (Carla); Jennifer Hirsch; Scott Simon (Michelle); Joshua Simon; and Lisa Jean (Sav) and seven great-grandchildren Jack and Emily Hirsch; Madeline Simon; Maya, Abby, and Brooke Vinikoor; and Kaylee Jean. Lou lived his life with a quiet intensity, interrupted only by the onset of Alzheimer's disease and cancer. He is flying pretty high now, and loving every minute. The family is indebted to Mayolin Andall and Vinnis Grifiths for their love and care of Lou. A memorial service will be held on Wednesday, August 8, 2012 at 10:00am at Community Synagogue of Rye, 200 Forest Avenue, Rye, NY 10580. In lieu of flowers, the family is requesting that donations be made out to the Neuberger Museum of Art, Neu Experiences in Art, a program for those with Alzheimer's disease."

His method also involves a longer, slower fermentation, or rising, than most commercial bakeries use. As any home baker knows, a slow rise adds taste and complexity."

2012-08-09T00:00:00Z,"HEINEMAN--Ben W.,Sr. Ben W. Heineman Sr., of Chicago, died on August 5, 2012, at age 98. He was revered as a giant of his generation--a brilliant lawyer, a far-sighted businessman, an adviser to presidents, governors and mayors, a prominent Chicago leader, a deeply committed supporter of opera and symphony, an influential trustee of the University of Chicago, and a world-class collector of contemporary glass. These and many other accomplishments reflected a person of extraordinary character, integrity and, independence, whose life truly deserved the phrases ""business statesman"" and ""Renaissance man."" He was a warm, witty, wise and caring counselor to many and, ultimately, an exemplary citizen of his city, his state, and his country. Ben was born in Wausau, Wisconsin, on February 10, 1914, six months before the start of World War I, the son of Walter Benjamin and Elsie Brunswick Heineman. After his family lost all its money in 1929, he attended the University of Michigan from 1930 to 1933 and then Northwestern Law School, graduating in 1936 at the top of his class and as the editor of the law review. His legal career spanned the next 20 years. He was a leading corporate lawyer in Chicago. Ben had deep friendships with the faculty at the University of Chicago law school (especially then-Dean Edward Levi, later University President). With professors and practitioners, he helped write the first version of the Uniform Commercial Code, a pillar of American law. During World War II, he served as assistant general counsel in the Office of Price Administration and then as assistant director of the North African Economic board. In 1951, Governor Adlai E. Stevenson appointed him special assistant attorney general to investigate Illinois' cigarette tax fraud. In 1952, he worked on the Stevenson Presidential campaign, drafting the Stevenson speech sharply criticizing Sen. Joseph McCarthy. In 1956, he was named CEO of the Chicago and Northwestern Railway after he led a successful proxy fight for dissident shareholders. He became a leading American businessman, as a dramatic innovator in a traditional industry, modernizing operating methods, reshaping labor relations, turning Chicago's commuter rail service into an acclaimed model for the nation, seeking de-regulation and greater competition. In 1968, he transformed the railway into a conglomerate, Northwest Industries, with industrial and consumer components. In 1972, he sold the railroad to its employees who benefited from the sale. Ben retired as CEO of Northwest in 1985, at age 71, having demonstrated the controversial conglomerate form of business could succeed with strong central resource allocation and decentralized responsibility. During his 30 years in business he also took on many governmental assignments. He served President Lyndon Johnson in numerous capacities, including chairman of the White House Conference on Civil Rights (1966); President's Task Force on Government Organization (1966-67); President's Commission on Income Maintenance Programs (1968). A ""Man in the News"" article in the New York Times called him ""a can-do man with a conscience."" He chaired the Illinois Board of Higher Education from 1962-69, developing master plans approved ultimately by the state legislature. In 1966, at the height of racial tension, Mayor Richard Daley appointed him chair of the Chicago Civil Rights Summit Conference on Fair Housing. But he turned down federal Cabinet positions and requests to run for public office, preferring to take on ad hoc assignments and retain his base as a private civic leader. He was a leading (and then life) trustee of the University of Chicago, of the Art Institute of Chicago, the Chicago Symphony Orchestra and the Chicago Lyric Opera. He also served on many other corporate and charitable boards. The great foundation of Ben's life was his beloved wife, Natalie Goldstein Heineman, a national leader in child welfare services. They married on April 17, 1935. She died on February 28, 2010, just shy of their 75th wedding anniversary. As a couple, they exemplified civic commitment. They were also great adventurers and world travelers, e.g. sailing alone, into their early 80s, on their 62-foot sailboat along the beautiful but desolate North shore of Lake Superior. Ben loved cars, skiing, skeet shooting, photography, woodworking, computers (he was one of the first CEOs to have a desk-top) and reading. They were deeply attached to their summer home in Door County, Wisconsin, on a 200-foot limestone cliff looking westward over Green Bay, where they often welcomed friends and family. One of their greatest adventures after Ben's retirement was assembling one of the nation's largest and finest private collections of contemporary studio glass. In 2006, Ben and Natalie gave the entire collection, valued at nearly $10 million, to the Corning Museum of Glass in Corning, New York, where all 240 objects by 87 international artists will be shown permanently on a rotating basis. Ben is survived by his daughter Dr. Martha Heineman Pieper (Dr. William Pieper) of Chicago and their children: Thalia Field (Jamie Jewett and son Benjamin), Dr. Jessica Heineman-Pieper (Dr. Param Srikantia), Johanna Heineman-Pieper, and Victoria Stein (Jotham Stein and son Gershon). He is also survived by his son, Ben W. Heineman, Jr. (Cristine Russell) of New Canaan, CT and their sons Zachary Heineman and Matthew Heineman. There will be a private family service. In lieu of flowers, donations in the name of Ben W. Heineman Sr. can be made to The Natalie G. Heineman Smart Love Pre-school, 800 W.

The club's budget had been knocked out of balance after the New York state liquor authority hit the owners with $20,000 in fines and a judge ordered them to pay the landlord $58,000 to cover part of the property taxes for the last two years, as required under its lease."

(13) MANON Anna Netrebko performs the title role in this ''Great Performances at the Met'' presentation of Massenet's opera about an alluring French girl from a small town with a fatal attraction to riches and pleasures. Piotr Beczala (above, with Ms. Netrebko) plays the Chevalier des Grieux, a young nobleman who falls in love with her. Paulo Szot is Lescaut, her protective cousin with temptations of his own; and David Pittsinger is the Comte des Grieux, who wants his son out of Manon's arms and into a respectable future. Fabio Luisi conducts this coproduction of the Metropolitan Opera and the Royal Opera House in Covent Garden, directed by Laurent Pelly. Ms. Netrebko ''may not have the light lyric coloratura voice of some classic Manons, and her singing was not flawless,'' Anthony Tommasini wrote in The New York Times. ''But with her rich, gleaming sound and vocal charisma, she was a Manon of rare intensity and emotional depth.'' He added: ''When the production team took bows in New York, the reaction was a mix of tepid applause, some isolated bravos and scattered boos. That seemed about right.''NOON (NBC) 2012 LONDON OLYMPICS Qualifying in track and field includes the men's 4x400 relay, a race that the American team has dominated.

2012-08-09T00:00:00Z,"I have seen segments of the Metropolitan Opera's latest production of Wagner's ''Ring'' cycle, directed by Robert Lepage, from various perspectives in addition to performances in the house: ''Das Rheingold'' projected onto large screens in Times Square (in a deluge) and in an HD screening at a movie theater in Ellsworth, Me.; ''Die Walküre'' in HD at a theater in Manhattan. Soon I will be able to view it in the intimacy of my living room, and you will too, on eight DVDs or five Blu-ray discs, to be released by Deutsche Grammophon on Sept. 11.The problem is, it is not exactly an intimate production, relying as it does on a 45-ton machine that the Deutsche Grammophon news release describes as ''an infinitely mobile, writhing, rotating raft of 24 individually pivoting aluminum planks.'' That's a lot of writhing for a living room. But the good news is that the various video presentations have in fact added intimacy, with close-ups of the characters, many of them portrayed by fine actors, that distract from the looming presence of the machine as it plots its next move, which so dominates in the house."

Raised in Bronxville, NY, and Mendham, Parker attended the Bronxville School, the Winston School, the Rumsey Hall School and had recently graduated from Suffield Academy. At Suffield, he was an honors student, squash player and golfer, earning five varsity letters in his three-year tenure. He was to begin his freshman year at Gettysburg College later this month.

David Rockwell, Parker's advisor at Suffield, praised his work ethic in the classroom and on the playing field, noting that ""He knew what he needed to do, and he did it.""

Tersey Regan, all of New York, NY, two grandmothers Prudence S. Regan of Watch Hill, RI, and Phyllis T. Conway of New Vernon, NJ, and sixteen cousins.

What follows is a highly subjective selection of some of his best. RANDY KENNEDYFROM 'THE FATAL SHORE,' A HISTORY OF AUSTRALIA, 1987 An unstated bias rooted deep in Australian life seemed to wish that ''real'' Australian history had begun with Australian respectability -- with the flood of money from gold and wool, the opening of the continent, the creation of an Australian middle class. Behind the bright diorama of Australia Felix lurked the convicts, some 160,000 of them, clanking their fetters in the penumbral darkness. But on the feelings and experiences of these men and women, little was written. They were statistics, absences and finally embarrassments."

(MoreMax) GREENBERG (2010) Ben Stiller plays Roger Greenberg, a 40-year-old former musician who, after a mental breakdown, house-sits in the large Los Angeles home of his vacationing brother in this film from Noah Baumbach. Greta Gerwig portrays Florence Marr, the brother's 25-year-old assistant and Roger's on-again, off-again love interest in his quest to recapture his youth. ''Mr. Stiller, suppressing his well-honed sketch comedian's urge to wink at the audience, turns Roger into a walking challenge to the Hollywood axiom that a movie's protagonist must be likable,'' A. O. Scott wrote in The New York Times. Only at the end does Mr. Baumbach reveal that the film has been ''a romantic comedy all along,'' he added. ''And suddenly a movie about a man who is defiantly difficult to like becomes very hard not to love.''"

Or at least a bunch of towering, sinuous things that appear to be made of foil, created by the sculptor John Chamberlain, who died in 2011 .Beginning Friday and continuing through Nov. 16, the plaza will host four sculptures made by Mr. Chamberlain from a body of work that detoured from his signature material - scrap automotive metal - and toward a much more pliable material. In the mid-1970s he began to make small pieces by twisting and shaping household foil into forms that resembled renegade ropes or elephant trunks or anemone tentacles. The pieces were then enlarged into full-scale sculptures made out of industrial aluminum, one of which - a kind of upside-down, dromedary version - was featured in the middle of the Guggenheim Museum's rotunda during the museum's retrospective of Mr. Chamberlain's work this year."

That was his stance during his life as well; he once rapped that he would not ''sell my songs for no TV ad.'' The will, filed in Manhattan court this week, leaves a roughly $6 million estate to his widow and teenage daughter. Mr. Yauch, who was a practicing Buddhist, started out as a tongue-in-cheek prankster, a scratchy-voiced punk rocker who adopted rap as a form. But as the Beastie Boys became superstars and helped hip-hop enter the mainstream, Mr. Yauch, above in 2004, became a socially conscious artist who, among other things, was a champion of independence for Tibet.

Henry Holt & Company said that the character, Raymond Chandler's creation and one of the world's most famous private eyes, would star in a novel written by John Banville to be published in 2013. Mr. Banville, 66, is a Booker Prize-winning author who has also written several mysteries under the pseudonym Benjamin Black. The new Marlowe novel by Mr. Banville, below, which was authorized by Chandler's estate, will be billed as a work by Black. It will be set in the 1940s in Chandler's fictional town, Bay City, Calif. Robert B. Parker wrote two authorized Marlowe books, ''Poodle Springs'' (1989) and ''Perchance to Dream'' (1991). Martin Amis looked unfavorably on ''Perchance'' in The New York Times Book Review: Mr. Parker's Marlowe ''has no turbulent soul, no inner complication to keep in check. Mr. Parker neither understands nor respects Marlowe's inhibitions; he fritters them away, unconsciously questing for some contemporary ideal of gruff likability.'' Holt's announcement came as it published ''Vengeance,'' the latest novel by Benjamin Black."

2012-08-11T00:00:00Z,"A New York federal judge has dismissed part of a libel lawsuit filed by the forensic art expert Peter Paul Biro, below, against The New Yorker but declined the magazine's request to dismiss the entire complaint. In July 2010 it published a 16,000-word article about art authentication, written by David Grann. In it Mr. Grann questioned Mr. Biro's method of matching fingerprints on paintings to the artists who created them. Although Judge J. Paul Oetken in his decision on Tuesday threw out several of Mr. Biro's charges against Advance Publications, which owns The New Yorker, he gave Mr. Biro the opportunity to argue in court that a few sentences in the article were libelous. ''The Article as a whole does not make express accusations against Biro, or suggest concrete conclusions about whether or not he is a fraud,'' the judge wrote in his opinion. ''Rather, it lays out evidence that may raise questions, and allows the reader to make up his or her own mind. At the same time, there can be little doubt that even a publication that, on the whole, merely raises questions has the potential to have serious consequences on a plaintiff's reputation.'' In response to the decision, The New Yorker issued a statement: ''We are gratified that Judge Oetken has already dismissed the vast bulk of Mr. Biro's claims, and we are confident that we will prevail.'' Mr. Biro could not be reached for comment."

He has rehearsed at the theater in recent years and is said to admire the acoustics, but he did not explain why he chose to be the first act at the revamped space. Peter Shapiro, a founder of the Brooklyn Bowl, has invested millions of dollars upgrading the theater's light and sound systems. In the late 1960s and early '70s, the Capitol was an important stop on the rock circuit and hosted memorable concerts by the Grateful Dead, Santana, Pink Floyd, Janis Joplin and other top acts. In recent years the owners have used the 1,800-seat space mostly for private events, though its superb acoustics have also made it a favored rehearsal space for musicians like Mr. Dylan and Paul Simon. Mr. Dylan's performance will be the start of an ambitious and eclectic slate of shows Mr. Shapiro has lined up for the fall, including concerts by the Roots, Fiona Apple and My Morning Jacket.

2012-08-12T00:00:00Z,"As far as U.S. individuals are concerned, no one has yet demonstrated to me that there's some kind of pandemic of rich people opening of shore accounts. In England, where I come from, it's reasonably commonplace for individuals to have bank accounts in Jersey. And in Germany, likewise, lots of middle-class families keep money in Luxembourg or Lichtenstein. But in the U.S., by contrast, I see no day-to-day indication that of shore accounts are a remotely common tax-avoidance strategy.Insofar as there is a problem, it seems to me, the problem is with tax collection and enforcement, rather than with the complexity of U.S. tax legislation. Yes, the U.S. tax code is ridiculously complex and riddled with loopholes that ought to be abolished. But I think it's actually pretty good when it comes to individuals' of shore assets.

2012-08-12T00:00:00Z,"BRITAIN is not on top of the London 2012 Games in the medal count, but the style of Catherine, the Duchess of Cambridge, has been undefeated at every event. During the first week of the Games she proved her penchant for mixing high and low, wearing an electric blue Stella McCartney dress (high) with a Smythe blazer (low, by comparison) to watch the tennis star Andy Murray win the quarterfinals, and matching a Roksanda Ilincic dress (high) with L. K. Bennett shoes (low) for the Creative Industries reception at the Royal Academy of the Arts. As the Games continued, the duchess took a sportier turn, favoring Adidas Team GB gear (jacket, fleece, polo and sneakers). But perhaps it's her unofficial uniform -- skinny jeans with a tailored jacket -- that gets the sartorial gold. Looking back at London 2012 (the closing ceremony is today), watching how the Duchess dressed may very well have been one of the Games' most heavily spectated sports. EDWARD BARSAMIAN"

Part of the reason must be that he chose his dancers wisely. Celia Fushille, the first he hired to be in his troupe, is now its artistic and executive director. Beginning Monday it appears at the Joyce Theater in three works. Along with Smuin's ''Medea,'' Ms. Fushille unveils two New York premieres: Amy Seiwert's lively ''Soon These Two Worlds'' and Trey McIntyre's '' Oh, Inverted World .''In ''Oh, Inverted World'' Mr. McIntyre expands on his much-admired ability to texture academic ballet vocabulary with athletic nonchalance. There is no autobiographical story, yet it's helpful to know that the dance was created in memory of a time when Mr. McIntyre lived in Portland, Ore., and was dealing with the end of a relationship. You know what it feels like when your world is turned inside out, but a record, played endlessly, makes the day-to-day more bearable? This is that and a good deal more.

The Alevis, mostly ethnic Turks, total between 15 million and 20 million and are spread throughout Turkey.

2012-08-12T00:00:00Z,"IF ever there were a rich historical melodrama to savor on the big screen, it's ''THE LEOPARD'' (1963), Luchino Visconti's graceful elegy for the Italian nobility, at the Museum of the Moving Image in a new digital restoration. Burt Lancaster gives a masterly performance as the courtly Don Fabrizio Salina, a Sicilian aristocrat all too aware of his own mortality and that of his class as Garibaldi's republic takes shape in the 1860s.Among the film's breathtaking set pieces, to say nothing of the sun-drenched vistas of Sicily, are a siege of Palermo and a spectacular hourlong banquet sequence that is a marvel of production design. As Don Fabrizio's nephew and his beloved, Alain Delon and Claudia Cardinale make as ravishing a pair as cinema has ever offered. But they are only one point of focus in Giuseppe Rotunno's lush wide-screen cinematography, which finds its musical analogue in Nino Rota's elegant score. Towering over the dazzling technical virtuosity on display, anchoring the entire enterprise, is Lancaster -- poised, nuanced, contemplative, the embodiment of a woefully endangered notion called noblesse oblige. 2 p.m. Sunday, 36-01 35th Avenue, Astoria, Queens; (718) 777-6888, movingimage.us ."

Much of Foote's oeuvre was set in that fictional corner of the Lone Star State, which was loosely based on Wharton, the town near Houston where Foote grew up, and where he still kept a home at the time of his death.Primary Stages, which has presented several of his later plays -- including ''Dividing the Estate,'' which later moved to Broadway under the auspices of Lincoln Center Theater -- opens its new season with ''Harrison, TX: Three Plays by Horton Foote.'' The production, directed by Pam MacKinnon (''Clybourne Park''), brings together ''Blind Date,'' ''The One-Armed Man'' and ''The Midnight Caller.'' Needless to say, all three are set in the titular town. The playwright's daughter, Hallie Foote, a Tony nominee for ''Dividing the Estate'' and one of the most distinguished interpreters of his work, headlines a cast that also includes Jayne Houdyshell, a Tony nominee this year for ''Follies.''

2012-08-12T00:00:00Z,"HEINEMAN--Ben W.,Sr. Ben W. Heineman Sr., of Chicago, died on August 5, 2012, at age 98. He was revered as a giant of his generation--a brilliant lawyer, a far-sighted businessman, an adviser to presidents, governors and mayors, a prominent Chicago leader, a deeply committed supporter of opera and symphony, an influential trustee of the University of Chicago, and a world-class collector of contemporary glass. These and many other accomplishments reflected a person of extraordinary character, integrity and, independence, whose life truly deserved the phrases ""business statesman"" and ""Renaissance man."" He was a warm, witty, wise and caring counselor to many and, ultimately, an exemplary citizen of his city, his state, and his country. Ben was born in Wausau, Wisconsin, on February 10, 1914, six months before the start of World War I, the son of Walter Benjamin and Elsie Brunswick Heineman. After his family lost all its money in 1929, he attended the University of Michigan from 1930 to 1933 and then Northwestern Law School, graduating in 1936 at the top of his class and as the editor of the law review. His legal career spanned the next 20 years. He was a leading corporate lawyer in Chicago. Ben had deep friendships with the faculty at the University of Chicago law school (especially then-Dean Edward Levi, later University President). With professors and practitioners, he helped write the first version of the Uniform Commercial Code, a pillar of American law. During World War II, he served as assistant general counsel in the Office of Price Administration and then as assistant director of the North African Economic board. In 1951, Governor Adlai E. Stevenson appointed him special assistant attorney general to investigate Illinois' cigarette tax fraud. In 1952, he worked on the Stevenson Presidential campaign, drafting the Stevenson speech sharply criticizing Sen. Joseph McCarthy. In 1956, he was named CEO of the Chicago and Northwestern Railway after he led a successful proxy fight for dissident shareholders. He became a leading American businessman, as a dramatic innovator in a traditional industry, modernizing operating methods, reshaping labor relations, turning Chicago's commuter rail service into an acclaimed model for the nation, seeking de-regulation and greater competition. In 1968, he transformed the railway into a conglomerate, Northwest Industries, with industrial and consumer components. In 1972, he sold the railroad to its employees who benefited from the sale. Ben retired as CEO of Northwest in 1985, at age 71, having demonstrated the controversial conglomerate form of business could succeed with strong central resource allocation and decentralized responsibility. During his 30 years in business he also took on many governmental assignments. He served President Lyndon Johnson in numerous capacities, including chairman of the White House Conference on Civil Rights (1966); President's Task Force on Government Organization (1966-67); President's Commission on Income Maintenance Programs (1968). A ""Man in the News"" article in the New York Times called him ""a can-do man with a conscience."" He chaired the Illinois Board of Higher Education from 1962-69, developing master plans approved ultimately by the state legislature. In 1966, at the height of racial tension, Mayor Richard Daley appointed him chair of the Chicago Civil Rights Summit Conference on Fair Housing. But he turned down federal Cabinet positions and requests to run for public office, preferring to take on ad hoc assignments and retain his base as a private civic leader. He was a leading (and then life) trustee of the University of Chicago, of the Art Institute of Chicago, the Chicago Symphony Orchestra and the Chicago Lyric Opera. He also served on many other corporate and charitable boards. The great foundation of Ben's life was his beloved wife, Natalie Goldstein Heineman, a national leader in child welfare services. They married on April 17, 1935. She died on February 28, 2010, just shy of their 75th wedding anniversary. As a couple, they exemplified civic commitment. They were also great adventurers and world travelers, e.g. sailing alone, into their early 80s, on their 62-foot sailboat along the beautiful but desolate North shore of Lake Superior. Ben loved cars, skiing, skeet shooting, photography, woodworking, computers (he was one of the first CEOs to have a desk-top) and reading. They were deeply attached to their summer home in Door County, Wisconsin, on a 200-foot limestone cliff looking westward over Green Bay, where they often welcomed friends and family. One of their greatest adventures after Ben's retirement was assembling one of the nation's largest and finest private collections of contemporary studio glass. In 2006, Ben and Natalie gave the entire collection, valued at nearly $10 million, to the Corning Museum of Glass in Corning, New York, where all 240 objects by 87 international artists will be shown permanently on a rotating basis. Ben is survived by his daughter Dr. Martha Heineman Pieper (Dr. William Pieper) of Chicago and their children: Thalia Field (Jamie Jewett and son Benjamin), Dr. Jessica Heineman-Pieper (Dr. Param Srikantia), Johanna Heineman-Pieper, and Victoria Stein (Jotham Stein and son Gershon). He is also survived by his son, Ben W. Heineman, Jr. (Cristine Russell) of New Canaan, CT and their sons Zachary Heineman and Matthew Heineman. There will be a private family service. In lieu of flowers, donations in the name of Ben W. Heineman Sr. can be made to The Natalie G. Heineman Smart Love Pre-school, 800 W.

2012-08-12T00:00:00Z,"I was out of money, and no money, I knew, meant exile. I'd moved to 5 states in 10 years -- California twice. In my 30s now, I had absorbed the gypsy lessons of starting fresh. I wanted to learn the art of having a home. Besides, I had finally fallen hard for San Francisco.But what to do? How to be sustainable? (A good S.F. word!) Here in the city there was always bike repair and artisanal lattes, but I had eked out a master's degree -- I aspired to the professional class. So I looked north and south, where two valleys flowered with employment: Napa and Silicon."

Huntington Woodman Curtis spent his 90th and final summer on Bailey Island, ME eating a bit of everything that swam, crawled or lived in the sand and mud of Casco Bay. The son of Pierson and Dr. Winifred Curtis, MD, of Stony Brook, NY, he learned to navigate by the stars with a sextant, chronometer and chart at hand when day broke. The happiest of men, he spent life asking questions and seeking solutions. He died September 13 in Newburgh, NY after a short illness. Claiming to have been an uncertain student until Mt. Hermon School, he waited tables at the College of William and Mary before being appointed a teaching assistant and graduating Phi Beta Kappa in 1942 with degrees in chemistry and physics. A grandson of Presbyterian missionaries who spent 40 years in Japan, he balanced his deep faith with a sense of national duty and enlisted in the Army Signa Corp. He spent World War II and the Korean War teaching at the U.S. Military Academy at West Point and retired years later as a lieutenant colonel in the Reserves. Known as ""Hunt,"" his studies led to a doctorate in electrical engineering and a faculty post at Dartmouth College's Thayer School. He regularly left to romp around the arctic conducting ionosphere research and took a break during the International Geophysical Year to skinny dip on the Greenland ice cap. His great passions involved science and nights spent outdoors under canvas in the rain. One of Joe Dodge's crew at the Appalachian Mountain Club, he drove donkeys loaded with supplies to huts into the White Mountains and later became a life trustee of the Mount Washington Observatory. Along the way, he married Peggy Parker of Goffstown, NH a Northfield School gal who could out-hike him and do more with an ax, a match and reflector oven than anyone he'd met. A wizard with chisel and saw, she stayed home to build furniture and raise their three children. Seeking to feed his brood, he left teaching for full-time research and the white shirt and narrow tie of an IBM engineer. From the 1960's through the mid-1990's he took one sick day a decade so he wouldn't miss the fun working in a lab with men and women who were the great poets of their crafts. He retired with Emeritus Scientist status that let him poke around the lab into his 80's. No drone, he spent free moments tinkering with clocks, paddling the Boundary Waters or under sail somewhere between Long Island Sound and Prince Edward Island. Each March, he headed to New Hampshire where sap turns into maple syrup on the north side of Bald Mountain. Predeceased by his wife, Margaret and daughter, Winifred, he is survived by sons, Henry of Kissimmee, FL, and Peter of Newburgh, NY, their families, grandson Parker Wayne of Pflugerville, TX and hordes of relatives and friends.

All of his slides, scribbles, prints and nearly every last negative have been painstakingly preserved, which made the task of narrowing down more than four decades of his work at once easy and arduous. The result, '' The Photographic Work ,'' (Steidl, $88), not only chronicles Mr. Gundlach's iconic postwar images -- including black-and-white portraits of cinema greats like Jean Cocteau and Jean-Luc Godard and shots of models like Wilhelmina Cooper and Grace Coddington -- but also explains, in the accompanying text, what Gundlach was after aesthetically. He preferred shooting on 28-millimeter wide-angle lenses and frequently played with distorted proportions, evident in the 1966 shot of the model Karin Mossberg, who looks like a giant dwarfing the Pyramids.

Our new favorite in this field: Alexander McQueen's De Manta, a version of which debuted in McQueen's spring 2010 Plato's Atlantis collection.

That's the TRESSPASS AMERICA tour, sponsored by Metal Hammer magazine and arriving at the Prudential Center in Newark. The most exciting band on this bill is the most ludicrous, or certainly the most sui generis. Five Finger Death Punch, from Los Angeles, released its third album, ''American Capitalist'' (Prospect Park), last year, a sometimes melodic, sometimes rap-metal-esque, sometimes Billy Joel-recalling semiconceptual album about greed and integrity that's occasionally predictable but never dull. It shares this bill with several bands with irrepressible styles: the smoothed-out post-metalcore of Killswitch Engage, the energetic semideathcore of Emmure, the ambitious mish-mosh of Trivium and the pungent, melodic death metal of God Forbid. Aggression aside, the groups have a sense of humor. In a promotional clip band members in black hoods are transported like prisoners, alongside a jeep with a gun turret.

In 1946, he and his classmate Al Hurwitz took over the Cherry Lane Theatre in Manhattan; directing, designing and producing shows.

Mr. Ramsey and Mr. Hurwitz went on to produce a series of successful plays, winning many awards. In the 1960s, he launched a film career that would span more than 40 years. Mr. Ramsey designed and art directed sets for feature films and commercials, winning many awards. During Lyndon Baines Johnson's presidency, he was honored as a set designer at the White House.

This year's balls, tea dances and classes ended a 25-year run in the city's Gilded Age mansions. The sponsor, the Commonwealth Vintage Dancers, will now work on other activities, like weekend conferences. The all-volunteer organization was founded by Hannah Artuso and Patri J. Pugliese after a visit 25 years ago to the Flying Cloud Academy of Vintage Dance of Cincinnati for an event organized by Richard Powers, top far left, who is said to have coined the phrase ''vintage dancing.'' Ms. Artuso's father, who had attended business gatherings in Newport at Ochre Court, an 1892 mansion, suggested the group meet there, and Vintage Dance Week was born, bringing Ochre Court and, in time, other of the city's grand old houses to magical life.The highlights of the week were the formal evening balls, each themed to a different era. Participants were booted, spurred, corseted and coiffured in proper style. This year, for the 1860s ball, some women wore seven layers of petticoat, corset and hoop under their silk dresses. All was not fancy footwork: at Swap and Sell, the dancers parted with excess sewing machines, hats, medals, shoes, kid gloves and spats.

2012-08-13T00:00:00Z,"CURTIS--Huntington W. Huntington Woodman Curtis spent his 90th and final summer on Bailey Island, ME eating a bit of everything that swam, crawled or lived in the sand and mud of Casco Bay. The son of Pierson and Dr. Winifred Curtis, MD, of Stony Brook, NY, he learned to navigate by the stars with a sextant, chronometer and chart at hand when day broke. The happiest of men, he spent life asking questions and seeking solutions. He died September 13 in Newburgh, NY after a short illness. Claiming to have been an uncertain student until Mt. Hermon School, he waited tables at the College of William and Mary before being appointed a teaching assistant and graduating Phi Beta Kappa in 1942 with degrees in chemistry and physics. A grandson of Presbyterian missionaries who spent 40 years in Japan, he balanced his deep faith with a sense of national duty and enlisted in the Army Signa Corp. He spent World War II and the Korean War teaching at the U.S. Military Academy at West Point and retired years later as a lieutenant colonel in the Reserves. Known as ""Hunt,"" his studies led to a doctorate in electrical engineering and a faculty post at Dartmouth College's Thayer School. He regularly left to romp around the arctic conducting ionosphere research and took a break during the International Geophysical Year to skinny dip on the Greenland ice cap. His great passions involved science and nights spent outdoors under canvas in the rain. One of Joe Dodge's crew at the Appalachian Mountain Club, he drove donkeys loaded with supplies to huts into the White Mountains and later became a life trustee of the Mount Washington Observatory. Along the way, he married Peggy Parker of Goffstown, NH a Northfield School gal who could out-hike him and do more with an ax, a match and reflector oven than anyone he'd met. A wizard with chisel and saw, she stayed home to build furniture and raise their three children. Seeking to feed his brood, he left teaching for full-time research and the white shirt and narrow tie of an IBM engineer. From the 1960's through the mid-1990's he took one sick day a decade so he wouldn't miss the fun working in a lab with men and women who were the great poets of their crafts. He retired with Emeritus Scientist status that let him poke around the lab into his 80's. No drone, he spent free moments tinkering with clocks, paddling the Boundary Waters or under sail somewhere between Long Island Sound and Prince Edward Island. Each March, he headed to New Hampshire where sap turns into maple syrup on the north side of Bald Mountain. Predeceased by his wife, Margaret and daughter, Winifred, he is survived by sons, Henry of Kissimmee, FL, and Peter of Newburgh, NY, their families, grandson Parker Wayne of Pflugerville, TX and hordes of relatives and friends. On August 18, the tribe will gather at the head of Mackerel Cove to celebrate the life of an extraordinary man with tales, John Masefield verse and really bad yodeling."
2012-08-13T00:00:00Z,"No character in Shakespeare is as hungry for power as Richard III. And it's hard to think of an actor with a naturally hungrier look than Ron Cephas Jones, the tall, beanpole-thin, snakelike actor who portrays the title character in the production of ''Richard III'' from the Public Theater 's new Mobile Shakespeare Unit. This scaled-down staging has been presented at prisons, homeless shelters and other sites in underserved neighborhoods before returning to the company's home base on Astor Place.With his sinewy limbs and lanky stature, Mr. Jones put me in mind of one of those amazing African long-distance runners in this summer's Olympics. And yet this production of ''Richard III,'' directed by Amanda Dehnert, more closely resembles a 100-meter sprint. Clocking in at a little more than 90 minutes, with no intermission, it's about half as long as the production starring Kevin Spacey last season at the Brooklyn Academy of Music."

It takes a big staff working on punishing deadlines to aggregate the flurry of news, put some learned topspin on it and package it for readers. But that job now belongs to the Web and takes place in real time, not a week later. Tina Brown may have understood the digital insurgency that was disrupting the publishing business, but that didn't stop her from stepping into the maw at the end of 2010, after Sidney Harman bought Newsweek . She married her Web site, The Daily Beast, with Newsweek in an attempt to put the paddles to a franchise gone cold, but Mr. Harman is now gone and his family has withdrawn its financial support. With losses continuing to pile up, that leaves IAC/InterActiveCorp, which also owns The Daily Beast, holding the bag."

The new tools, like a voice search that seems to outdo Apple's Siri, make Google more useful.

2012-08-13T00:00:00Z,"""The Bourne Legacy"" managed to sell an estimated $40.3 million in tickets at North American movie theaters over the weekend, a No. 1 opening that was solid if not spectacular. ""Legacy,"" featuring Jeremy Renner, cost Universal Pictures and a financing partner at least $125 million to produce and tens of millions more to market.Financial success now turns on how well Mr. Renner performs overseas, where his drawing power is untested. He has stepped in for Matt Damon, who helped power the last three movies in this series to over $1 billion in global ticket sales. But ""Legacy,"" directed and co-written by Tony Gilroy, received the worst reviews of the series. To compare, opening-weekend sales for ""Legacy"" were 14 percent better than they were for ""The Bourne Identity"" in 2002, after adjusting for inflation, and 46 percent below the opening total for its series predecessor, ""The Bourne Ultimatum"" in 2007."

2012-08-14T00:00:00Z,"ARUEGO--Jose Illustrator, author, calligrapher, father. He died peacefully on August 9th his 80th birthday. Jose Aruego's 82 books for children enchanted a generation of young readers, and critics as well. Working with his wife and long-time collaborator Ariane Dewey, he created a world of joyful animals so full of life that one reviewer termed his style illustrative mime. His characters were spare of line, while still being wonderfully expressive and vivacious. Among their best-known books are Whose Mouse Are You?, Leo the Late Bloomer and Gregory the Terrible Eater. Jose's artistic career was even more remarkable because he was supposed to be a lawyer. He graduated from law school at the University of the Philippines and passed the bar, but his true passion lay in the arts. He came to New York City in 1956 and studied at Parsons School of Design. Jose's career took off when he began penning cartoons. Many were published in the The New Yorker and The Saturday Evening Post. A couple even appeared on The Ed Sullivan Show. Jose and Ariane's first book was published in 1969. He brought his work to life in lectures at elementary schools around the country. Long days in classrooms and auditoriums were made longer by his insistence on sketching a character into every book he signed and teaching students to draw his alligators. Later in life, Jose took up calligraphy and excelled in that as well. Jose's love of travel brought him around the world. Since Jose was such a private person, there will be no funeral service. A memorial will be held in the fall. Jose is survived by his son Juan, the rest of his family and the untold number of people he touched through his art, his quiet charm and his deafening joie de vie. We miss you."

2012-08-15T00:00:00Z,"BROWN--Helen Gurley, editor-in-chief of Cosmopolitan magazine's 64 international editions and one of the world's most popular and influential editors, died August 13, 2012, after a brief hospitalization at the McKeen Pavilion at NewYork-Presbyterian Hospital/Columbia. She was 90. Widely heralded as a legend, Gurley Brown exerted a profound impact on popular culture and society that reached around the globe, first with her 1962 bestseller, Sex and the Single Girl, and then for more than three decades with her personal imprint on Cosmopolitan, a feat rarely replicated by editors. ""Helen Gurley Brown was an icon. Her formula for honest and straightforward advice about relationships, career and beauty revolutionized the magazine industry,"" said Frank A. Bennack, Jr., CEO of Hearst Corporation. ""She lived every day of her life to the fullest and will always be remembered as the quintessential 'Cosmo girl.' She will be greatly missed."" The philanthropy she established with her husband, David Brown, also left an indelible mark on journalism: In January, Gurley Brown gave $30 million to Columbia and Stanford Universities. The gift created the David and Helen Gurley Brown Institute for Media Innovation, housed at both Columbia's Graduate School of Journalism and the School of Engineering at Stanford. David Brown, who died in 2010, attended both universities and was a movie producer whose films included Jaws, The Sting and The Verdict. The woman who redefined womanhood for many coming of age in the early '60s was born in Green Forest, Ark., on February 18, 1922, to Ira and Cleo Gurley, both schoolteachers. The family moved to Little Rock when Ira was elected to the state legislature. He died in an elevator accident when Helen was 10 years old. After trying to support Helen and her older sister, Mary, in Depression-era Arkansas, Cleo Gurley moved them to Los Angeles in the late 1930s. There, Gurley Brown excelled socially and academically, graduating from high school as class valedictorian. She spent a year at the Texas State College for Women and returned home to put herself through Woodbury Business College. Her mother and sister, who had contracted polio, depended on her financial support for the rest of their lives. In 1941, with her business degree, Gurley Brown took on a series of secretarial jobs. It was her 17th job, at the advertising agency Foote, Cone & Belding, that launched her future success. By the late 1950s, she had become the highest-paid female copywriter on the West Coast and one of the few to be listed in Who's Who of American Women. In 1959, at the age of 37, Gurley Brown married Brown, 43, then a film executive at 20th Century Fox Studios, and later an independent producer. During their marriage, Brown was a partner behind many of his wife's projects, even writing Cosmo cover lines. It was he who persuaded her to write a book about her life as a single woman. The result, Sex and the Single Girl (1962), took the nation--and then the globe--by storm. On the best-seller lists for more than a year, Sex and the Single Girl has been published in 28 countries and translated into 16 languages. Quick on the heels of her first success, Gurley Brown wrote the 1964 bestseller, Sex and the Office. Warner Bros. bought the film rights to Sex and the Single Girl for what was then the highest price ever paid for a nonfiction title. The 1964 film starred Natalie Wood, Tony Curtis, Lauren Bacall and Henry Fonda. The Browns then worked together to keep Helen in the public eye. They pitched plays, television shows, more books and new magazines for single women. One, a magazine called Femme, attracted the interest of Hearst Magazines. But instead of a new title, Hearst agreed to let her try to revive Cosmopolitan magazine. In July 1965, Gurley Brown officially became editor-in-chief of Cosmopolitan and launched it into publishing history. She was Cosmo's tireless editor-in-chief, growing the magazine in the 1980s to 300 pages, a third of which were advertisements. Today Cosmopolitan is the top-selling young women's magazine in the world, with 64 international editions. It is published in 35 languages and distributed in more than 100 countries. In 1997, Gurley Brown left the flagship magazine to serve as editor-in-chief of Cosmopolitan's growing international editions. She and Brown, who were married for 51 years, were anchors in the New York publishing and Hollywood film communities, as he and partner Richard Zanuck produced some of the era's most memorable movies, among them Cocoon and Driving Miss Daisy. Named one of the 25 Most Influential Women in the U.S. five times by The World Almanac, Gurley Brown continued to write books, some 11 in all. For her exemplary contributions to magazine journalism, Gurley Brown was awarded a Matrix Award by New York Women in Communications in 1985. In 1986, Hearst Corporation established a chair at Northwestern University's Medill School of Journalism in her name, the Helen Gurley Brown Research Professorship. She was inducted into the Publisher's Hall of Fame in 1988, taking her place with such publishing originals as Henry Luce, DeWitt Wallace, Harold Ross and Norman Cousins. The Magazine Publishers of America honored Helen Gurley Brown with the 1995 Henry Johnson Fisher Award, the magazine publishing industry's highest honor. Gurley Brown was the first woman recipient. She received the 1996 American Society of Magazine Editors' Hall of Fame Award.

2012-08-15T00:00:00Z,"3 P.M. (FX) THE CURIOUS CASE OF BENJAMIN BUTTON (2008) Brad Pitt received an Oscar nomination for his portrayal of Benjamin Button, a man born in his 80s in 1918 New Orleans, who ages in reverse into the 21st century in this adaptation of a whimsical short story by F. Scott Fitzgerald. Cate Blanchett, above with Mr. Pitt, is Daisy, the dancer who loves Benjamin at whatever stage he is in his life. And Taraji P. Henson, who also received an Oscar nomination, is the nursing home caretaker who raises him when his father abandons him. From Fitzgerald's ''odd, somewhat unpromising kernel, the director David Fincher and the screenwriter Eric Roth have cultivated a lush, romantic hothouse bloom, a film that shares only a title and a basic premise with its literary source,'' A. O. Scott wrote in The Times, adding that the film ''sighs with longing and simmers with intrigue while investigating the philosophical conundrums and emotional paradoxes of its protagonist's condition in a spirit that owes more to Jorge Luis Borges than to Fitzgerald.''8 A.M. (USA) THE AVIATOR (2004) Leonardo DiCaprio received a best actor Oscar nomination for his role as a young Howard Hughes, the eccentric empire builder and recluse, in this biopic directed by Martin Scorsese. The film covers the late 1920s through the '40s, when Hughes was dabbling in filmmaking and aviation. Manohla Dargis, writing in The New York Times, called the movie ''visually sumptuous if disappointingly hollow,'' though it went on to win five Oscars, including best supporting actress for Cate Blanchett in her role as Katharine Hepburn, whom Hughes courted. Mr. DiCaprio can also be seen as Jack Dawson, the steerage dreamboat who steals the heart of the upper-class Rose DeWitt (Kate Winslet), in ''Titanic'' (1997), at 1 p.m. on HBO; as Amsterdam, who's bent on revenge for the death of his father, a gang chieftain, in ''Gangs of New York'' (2002), at 8 on BBC America; and as a specialist in corporate mental espionage who penetrates the minds of his sleeping targets to extract information, in ''Inception'' (2010), at 10:30 on HBO Signature."

He then spent 12 years as a Foreign Service Officer for the U.S. Department of State, with posts in Belfast, Baghdad, Genoa, Bangkok and Washington, D.C. After retiring from the government, Dr. Chase received his Ph.D. from Bryn Mawr College in 1968, writing his dissertation on Morgenthau's Realist Theory. Dr. Chase then served on the faculty of Saint Joseph's University from 1969 to 1996 and continued to teach as a Professor Emeritus for more than 10 years after formally retiring. He was an extremely popular teacher, serving as a dorm master for several years, while also leading study abroad programs in London, China and Russia. During his 20+ years as Chairman of the Political Science Department he was able to bring his diplomatic skills to the down-and-dirty world of academic politics, which Henry Kissinger described as ""being so vicious because the issues were so small."" In addition to teaching he ran the Model UN program for St. Joseph's and led the committee that developed the Haub School of Business. Dr. Chase received the 2010 Brother Bartholomew A. Sheehan, S.J. '27 award given by the Law Alumni Chapter for his long time contribution to the University. This was a tribute from his former students for his mentorship both during their time as undergraduates and throughout their professional careers. Dr. Chase is survived by his nieces and nephews: Kathy Albino, Charles Chase, Judith Geisser, Bruce Goerlich, Patrick Goerlich, and Peter Goerlich, as well as ten grand nieces and nephews, and two greatnephews. He was a gentleman, teacher, scholar and noted author. In addition, he was an avid patron of the Opera Company of Philadelphia, the Philadelphia Orchestra and the Pennsylvania Academy of the Fine Arts. He will be sorely missed. ""His soul swooned slowly as he heard the snow falling faintly through the universe and faintly falling, like the descent of their last end, upon all the living and the dead."" James Joyce - The Dubliners Funeral service will be held at 11:00am, Saturday August 18th, at Saint Mark's Episcopal Church, 1625 Locust Street, Philadelphia PA 19103.

2012-08-15T00:00:00Z,"Will the hit Broadway musical ""Newsies"" continue to flourish without its breakout star, Jeremy Jordan? Disney Theatrical Productions will soon find out. Disney executives said on Tuesday that Mr. Jordan, who has become an audience favorite as the brooding New York City newsboy Jack Kelly, would give his final performance on Sept. 4 so he can concentrate on his new leading role in the NBC series "" Smash ."" Disney also announced that a 22-year-old unknown, Corey Cott, who graduated from Carnegie Mellon University in May and joined the ""Newsies"" company last month, would take over the role of Jack on Sept. 5.Recasting stars can be fraught business on Broadway: Nick Jonas never really caught fire with audiences last spring after replacing Daniel Radcliffe in ""How to Succeed in Business Without Really Trying,"" and ticket sales to ""The Addams Family"" fell off considerably when the hugely popular Nathan Lane finished his yearlong contract. But Disney has deep experience with recasting roles in long-running hits like ""The Lion King"" and ""Mary Poppins,"" and executives there expressed confidence that Mr. Cott had the tenor, training, and boyish charisma to help coax audience members to return to see ""Newsies"" over and over again, as Mr. Jordan did."

2012-08-16T00:00:00Z,"BURSTEIN--Lucien. The firm of Warshaw Burstein Cohen Schlesinger & Kuh mourns the passing of one of our founding partners, a dedicated and respected leader of our firm. Luce was instrumental in establishing our current firm in 1978 after having been associated with and managing its predecessor firm since 1951, shortly after his graduation from Yale Law School. He had decided to go to law school following his service in the U.S. Army Air Corps as an aircraft mechanic stationed in Guam from 1943 to 1946. He was one of the driving forces in continuing the growth of our firm over the last 34 years. While he specialized in real estate law, he was truly a renaissance practitioner, with a keen understanding of litigation, corporate, tax and trust and estates law. During that period, he developed a large number of clients for whom he was not only their attorney, counselor and advisor but also their friend. A longtime resident of Larchmont, NY, he was unconditionally devoted to Rose Anne, his remarkable and beloved wife of 68 years, who passed away earlier this year. He was tall in stature, but his most memorable physical feature was the frequent twinkle in his eye. For those of us who had the privilege of spending time with him on a daily basis, he never failed to exhibit patience and wisdom, earning the respect and affection of everyone with whom he worked and associated. He will be dearly missed by all of us. He had the good fortune to be able to spend his final years in Davis, California surrounded by his children and grandchildren. The family has advised us that one memorial for Luce & Rose Anne will be held in Davis on Saturday, August 25, and a second in late fall in the New York area. Details and additional information are at www.burstein.org/memorial. We extend our deepest sympathy to Emily, Barton and Daniel, to his grandchildren, and to the other members of the family.

2012-08-17T00:00:00Z,"The first image in David Cronenberg 's ''Cosmopolis,'' a cold, funny number about the erotics of money and the seduction of death, is that of a chrome grille on a white stretch limousine. The shot is a close-up that's so tightly framed that the grille, with its U shape and vertical bars, looks as if it were smiling. It also looks like a shark, a perfect starting point for a story about a master of the universe who, over one long day and night, lives, eats, evacuates and fornicates in the limo. A master who, like some kind of millennial Jonah, has taken up residence in the belly of a new beast.The limo belongs to Eric Packer ( Robert Pattinson ), a young money man whose mysterious ways with capital have made him so unfathomably rich that he seems to have transcended everyday flop-sweat wheeling and dealing and reached a permanent state of Zen. You first see him next to a building, as unmoving and marble white as a Greek statue (or maybe a stiff). He's impeccably dressed in a black suit and white shirt, with a meticulously knotted tie, a luxuriant slick swirl of hair and fathomless blue eyes initially obscured by dark glasses. The world is his succulent oyster. But all that Eric wants -- all that this contemporary god who lives in a tower and plays with money needs -- is a haircut."
2012-08-17T00:00:00Z,"For positive change in the issues that affect our daily lives -- not only food but also jobs, income, housing -- we need active political leadership. But until President Obama is pushed more strongly by the left, the coming presidential election represents a choice between a full-fledged attack on government services and a continuing slide into the gloomy and depressing world of austerity economics. That's a real choice, but it's not a happy one.When Obama has been pressured on issues, like gay rights, immigration and the Keystone XL pipeline, he's responded positively. But he hasn't been pushed on food, and as a result has not followed up on campaign promises like his vow to label foods containing genetically modified ingredients , nor has he used his bully pulpit to try to protect SNAP (food stamps) from the ravages of Congress. Since there isn't a real food movement -- yet! -- progressives haven't made Obama do much."

The musical numbers, which occur with minimal choreography on ordinary streets (and are written, for both movies, by Alex Beaupain), are less expressive than analytical, as if singing were above all a kind of philosophical reflection.A lyric that pops up early and late in ''Beloved'' ruminates on life-and-death matters of desire: ''I can't live without you,'' the singer says to her beloved, ''but what kills me is that I can't live without loving you.'' The words are sung playfully and thoughtfully, in a mood of detachment from the passions that they describe. But the film itself, for all its moments of whimsy and humor, is laced with tragedy, and if it is about love it is also about mortality, disappointment and unbearable loss."

2012-08-19T00:00:00Z,"I think there is a natural curiosity that many people have when they hear about an actor writing fiction. While it's not exactly comparable to proving a mathematical theorem ( Danica McKellar , the girl from ''The Wonder Years,'' can boast about that feat), it does seem an unusual endeavor to some.For me, however, what is surprising is that more actors don't do it, as writing fiction draws on many of the same skills that, as an actor, I have been practicing my entire life."
2012-08-19T00:00:00Z,"There is a curious passage early in Freud's ''Ego and the Id'' where he remarks that the id behaves ''as if'' it were unconscious. The phrase is puzzling, but the meaning is clear: the id is the secret driver of our desires, which animate our conscious life, but the ego does not recognize it as such. The ego -- what we take to be our conscious, autonomous self -- is ignorant to the agency of the id and sees itself in the driver's seat instead. Freud offers this metaphor: the ego is like a man on horseback, struggling to contain the powerful beast beneath; to the extent that the ego succeeds in guiding this beast, it's only by ''transforming the id's will into action as if it were its own.''By Freud's account, conscious autonomy is a charade. ''We are lived,'' as he puts it, and yet we don't see it as such. Indeed, Freud suggests that to be human is to rebel against that vision -- the truth. We tend to see ourselves as self-determining, self-conscious agents in all that we decide and do, and we cling to that image. But why? Why do we resist the truth? Why do we wish -- strain, strive, against the grain of reality -- to be autonomous individuals, and see ourselves as such?"

In the 1920s, with some spillover before and after, The New York Times made a convention of photographing artists with both their works of art and the people (or pets) depicted in those works.For the subjects, it meant getting their pictures in the paper twice in the same day, captured -- once in the flesh and once on canvas or in clay. For the subjects' mothers, presumably, it meant clipping twice as many likenesses to send to far-flung relatives. Imagine the postage and long-distance calls."
2012-08-19T00:00:00Z,"ARUEGO--Jose Illustrator, author, calligrapher, father. He died peacefully on August 9th his 80th birthday. Jose Aruego's 82 books for children enchanted a generation of young readers, and critics as well. Working with his wife and long-time collaborator Ariane Dewey, he created a world of joyful animals so full of life that one reviewer termed his style illustrative mime. His characters were spare of line, while still being wonderfully expressive and vivacious. Among their best-known books are Whose Mouse Are You?, Leo the Late Bloomer and Gregory the Terrible Eater. Jose's artistic career was even more remarkable because he was supposed to be a lawyer. He graduated from law school at the University of the Philippines and passed the bar, but his true passion lay in the arts. He came to New York City in 1956 and studied at Parsons School of Design. Jose's career took off when he began penning cartoons. Many were published in the The New Yorker and The Saturday Evening Post. A couple even appeared on The Ed Sullivan Show. Jose and Ariane's first book was published in 1969. He brought his work to life in lectures at elementary schools around the country. Long days in classrooms and auditoriums were made longer by his insistence on sketching a character into every book he signed and teaching students to draw his alligators. Later in life, Jose took up calligraphy and excelled in that as well. Jose's love of travel brought him around the world. Since Jose was such a private person, there will be no funeral service. A memorial will be held in the fall. Jose is survived by his son Juan, the rest of his family and the untold number of people he touched through his art, his quiet charm and his deafening joie de vie. We miss you."

Similar words could be used to describe the 26-year-old actress, who at age 16 fled Catholic school in Austin, Tex., for a try at modeling in New York - but who still listens to the blues and is a crack shot with her .357 Magnum. Heard is also a Guess model, whose va-va-voom looks and progressive views on sexuality - she spoke out on behalf of the L.G.B.T. community at a 2010 Gay & Lesbian Alliance Against Defamation event - have earned her many a racy headline.

''The name just reminds me of my youth and the way I felt listening to music and hanging out with my friends running around the city.'' The self-invented, devil-may-care attitude that's characterized both skate culture and the irreverent sound of so many New York bands (the Ramones and Suicide come to mind) has had a big influence on Skaters, who released their debut EP, ''Schemers,'' for free on the Web earlier this year. A rose-colored, wistful affection for the city is shared by the group's three members -- Mr. Cummings (at center in photo), Noah Rubin (drums; at left) and Joshua Hubbard (guitar) -- and can be heard loud and clear in songs like ''Good Weird Woman,'' with its subway-station-sounding saxophone, and ''Are We Just Doomed?'' a bittersweet account of leaving home and hardly sleeping, something any New York band worth its salt knows intimately. ''I couldn't imagine making or listening to this music in any other environment,'' Mr. Cummings says. ALEX FRANK"

2012-08-19T00:00:00Z,"By age 8, I was pretty clear about who I was. I loved to read, I loved puzzles, I loved political satire and I loved classic business wear. Blazers, button-up shirts, tweed, front-pleated trousers, oxford shoes. My style aesthetic was that of a sensible adult, and I had an irrepressible penchant for fine tailoring and conservative clothes. I would have even taken a blouse and finely made slacks over a date with Ricky Schroder any day. (Maybe not.)My pull toward that aesthetic was only deepened by 13 years of wearing a uniform to school: crisp white shirt, navy blazer with a griffin patch on the pocket, pleated gray skirt, black and white saddle shoes. Heaven. So while the other kids in my class raged against the machine in their free time, experimenting with neon, mesh poodle skirts, tube tops and patterned leggings, I spent my weekends dressing like a 50-year-old assistant professor: I dabbled in houndstooth coats, wool gabardine trousers and vests. I may have experimented with a bolo tie or a silk paisley shirt once in a while. But I never strayed too far from the ''dress for success'' model, a credo normal tweens did whatever they could to avoid."

His eye is drawn to clutter and quirk: the electric-green moldings in Albert Maysles's Harlem brownstone, or Lou Doillon's antique barber's chair in Paris.

2012-08-19T00:00:00Z,"A hundred years from now, fashion historians will want to know about the astonishing style of Anna Piaggi, an Italian fashion editor who died in Milan on Aug. 7 at age 81. These black-and-white photos, taken mostly in the '70s and '80s, show her creative style at full peak. In one picture at right, she wears a black suit with an enormous plexiglass flower pinned to the lapel, at a show in Paris in 1969. By the next year, as seen in the photo above left, she was mixing vintage clothes and those of different designers. Ms Piaggi started out as interpreter. Her husband, Alfa Castaldi, a fashion photographer, introduced her to the world of high style. Later, in London, she met Vern Lambert, a fashion historian, and together they created a style of dress that must be classified as a tour de force. While many observers thought her clothes were vintage, in fact they were mostly by contemporary designers, with an occasional vintage coat.

''But I like to think I can do many things, from full drag to 'scrubbed clean,' and somehow make it look like my hand.'' He may be versatile, but one thing that carries through all his work is sex appeal. ''I've been accused of making girls look oversexed,'' he admits. The sultry makeup he did here has a tough-girl edge. ''I wanted to play with the idea of youth, which for me means a bare face with one statement, like a drawn-on eyebrow or a matte black eye. No foundation, no blush -- just lots of attitude.'' While lipstick is optional (''I don't believe in the rule that says you shouldn't wear a strong eye with a strong lip -- it's a good-taste trap''), great skin is imperative. Carrasquillo's trade secret? A special arnica oil-based luminizer he whips up in his East Village kitchen. ''Every model I use it on asks me to make some for them,'' he says. ''I won't reveal all the ingredients, but it's healing and leaves skin with a beautiful, glowing finish.'' Maquillage magic can only do so much, though, he adds. ''A woman can have incredible skin, but if she's not happy in it, all the makeup in the world won't help. I'm so tired of seeing beautiful young girls with Botox, etc. I want to tell them to just simmer down and enjoy who they are.''Xiao Wen Ju Bold brows instantly change a face, Carrasquillo says.

2012-08-19T00:00:00Z,"When is a shoe not just a shoe? Why, when it's a love object, a fetish or an alternate dream of self, of course. Shoes, like handbags, have grown in cultural stature over the last few decades, sending out coded and not so coded messages about the women who wear them: I am sexy, chic, kooky; I can walk without falling down in four-inch heels; I can afford to spend gobs of money on elusive brands and esoteric leathers. Manhattan department stores have, in the last few years, enlarged their shoe departments, in recognition of their allure and ""recession-proof"" sales potential, in many cases taking away space from what was once the main event - the clothes themselves.A reigning case in point is the second-floor Shoe Salon at Bergdorf Goodman , which in September 2011, in advance of the store's 111th anniversary celebration this fall, opened a renovated and expanded department. ""Women will cut back on vacations and entertaining,"" says Linda Fargo, the Bergdorf senior vice president who oversaw the expansion. ""We won't cut back on shoes."" The sumptuous space mixes vintage furniture and commissioned pieces, and exotic materials like shagreen, faux parchment and macassar ebony, with leopard-print carpeting and a domed gold-leaf ceiling. It has five connecting rooms, with sections for couture designers like Chanel, Lanvin and Manolo Blahnik (about half of the Blahnik collection is exclusive to Bergdorf); ""modernist"" brands like Dries Van Noten and Chloé; and edgier ones like Azzedine Alaïa and Jimmy Choo. ""The choices within the brands skew toward the feminine,"" Fargo notes decisively. ""We won't embrace ugly chic."""

Originally from Montreal, Greg was a true visionary, involved in the internet sector back in 1995, after graduating from the University of Western Ontario with a Business degree. He had started his career in Toronto focusing on real estate before moving to California to co-found Zip2 Corporation, one of the first, internet mapping companies. After successfully selling Zip2, Greg continued as an angel investor for many tech companies based in Silicon Valley, California. He was also a real estate investor in Canada and South Florida, where he lived from 1999. People remember Greg as a kind, warm gentleman, with an elegant demeanor and an unforgettable smile. He was truly a guiding light for so many, and will be greatly missed by all who's lives he touched. Greg is survived by his wife, Jean Marie Echemendia-Kouri, his two daughters Ava Camille Frankel, 15, and Vanessa Kouri, 7, and his brother, Andrew Kouri. He is also survived by his father, Donald Kouri, and his stepmother Diane Kouri. He was a loving uncle to Megan, Alexandra and Caroline Kouri. He is predeceased by his mother, Marlene Yared Kouri.

2012-08-19T00:00:00Z,"Talk about the mother of the bride from hell: In 1904, Marie Anatole Louise Élisabeth, Countess Greffulhe, wore a Worth gown to the wedding of her daughter that captivated le tout Paris with its showy audacity, the sheer nerve of its golden verve. Besides outshining her hapless progeny, the countess, who would probably be totally forgotten but for the fact that she is one of the inspirations for Proust's Duchesse de Guermantes in ""Remembrance of Things Past,"" lives on in another respect - the dress that had tongues wagging resides more than a hundred years later in a cabinet in a building on a street in Paris so undistinguished, so ordinary, that you would never in a million years suspect that behind its doors rest 23,000 garments, wrapped individually in 23,000 swaths of muslin.On a bright afternoon during Fashion Week, I push through that plebeian portal in the 11th Arrondissement to visit Olivier Saillard, the director of Galliera, the Paris Museum of Fashion. The museum itself is clear across town (it backs onto that hipster heaven the Palais de Tokyo, in the 16th) and is currently closed for renovation, scheduled to open in the fall of 2013. But the archives, under the stewardship of Saillard, are located here. The curator is boyish and full of good humor, as you might expect from a guy who this September is unveiling a site-specific piece called ""The Impossible Wardrobe,"" in which Tilda Swinton will parade around the Palais de Tokyo with incredibly valuable vintage fashion laid across her outstretched arms. Saillard is no stranger to this sort of thing, having juxtaposed Balenciaga and Comme des Garçons on the docks of the Seine and shown Madame Grès's sculptural creations next to plaster statues in an exhibition at the Musée Bourdelle last summer. He is, in fact, rapidly becoming known as the modern master of contemporary costume museum performance-presentation, a curator who thinks outside the box, or in this case, the dimly lit institutional vitrine."

Earning its name from the classic ''V for Vendetta,'' Lim's new Vendetta cross-body bag packs a powerful one-two punch: a compact shape and an extra-long strap, making it ideal for quickly slinging over the shoulder (and keeping your superwoman hands free). ''I like the idea of it being worn in many different ways, as a messenger during the day and as a clutch at night,'' Mr. Lim says. The Vendetta comes in classic brown, black and a most coveted color-blocked version. ''The basis of the bag comes from structured vintage satchels,'' Mr. Lim adds.

He brought singular rigor, creativity and insight to the interpretation and application of the City's zoning and land use laws, and shaped the fabric of the City's built form through his instrumental role in innumerable projects for leading developers and non-profit institutions.

2012-08-19T00:00:00Z,"LINDENBAUM--Sandy, was the kind of attorney and professional everyone would want to hire. At what he did, he was the best there is. He was smart (Smartest Guy in the Room smart), fast, perceptive, wise, imaginative, thorough, precise of language, unflappable and, even, punctual. He would see the big picture, but mastered technical minutiae. He knew everyone. If you needed a meeting with an official, like, tomorrow, only Sandy could get that for you, tomorrow. Sandy was a proud man, but not haughty. He was confident of his judgment, but if you had a better idea than he did (it could happen), he would see that and seize it immediately. Sandy returned everyone's calls, from the highest and most powerful to the lowest on the totem pole. With the volume of calls he had, however, you had to be prepared for a brief and pithy conversation. I advised people calling Sandy: ""You won't have much time for chit-chat. He may not even say goodbye to you before he hangs up. That doesn't mean he doesn't like you; it means he has 25 more calls to get through."" Sandy and is wife Linda were sophisticated connoisseurs of art, architecture and all things aesthetic and beautiful. They travelled everywhere. If one needed to find a great hotel anywhere in the world, Sandy knew it and had stayed there. There are not too many people who were more fun to be with than Sandy and Linda. Nor many more stylish and elegant. Sandy was unfailingly gracious and generous. He was to me, literally, a beloved friend. Much of whatever success I have had in my profession, I owe to Sandy. And I know several people who say exactly the same thing. A co-consultant on a project once said to me, ""The client commands your presence at a meeting on Thursday."" Offended and prideful, I replied, ""No one can command my presence at a meeting. Wait, there is one person who can."" ""Who's that? Your wife?"", he asked. ""No,"" I said, ""not even her; only Sandy Lindenbaum."" Michael Parley"

Each party has done it twice since 1900, with one success and one failure for both Republicans and Democrats.The Republicans began in 1908 with James S. Sherman, who ran with William H. Taft. A representative from upstate New York, Sherman (known as ''Sunny Jim'') balanced the ''Western'' choice of Taft from Ohio. In office, Sherman presided over the Senate and played golf. After Taft defeated Theodore Roosevelt for the party nomination in 1912, Sherman was renominated by default. He died of a heart condition in late October and is now forgotten."

2012-08-19T00:00:00Z,"LINDENBAUM--Samuel H. The Trustees and staff of The Metropolitan Museum of Art mourn the passing of Sandy Lindenbaum, an Honorary Trustee since 2004, and a colleague and friend. He shared with his wife Linda a great passion for the Met, and they are both esteemed Benefactors who, for more than three decades, have contributed generously to this institution in immeasurable ways. He was an important and involved member of the Museum's Real Estate Council, which he joined and supported beginning in 1984, and which recognized him as the honoree of its 2002 Benefit. He was also an active member of Trustee advisory committees that supported exhibitions, acquisitions, events, and curatorial areas including Asian art and modern/contemporary art. Sandy and Linda's extensive support of the Department of the Arts of Africa, Oceania, and the Americas culminated in 2010 with the naming of two galleries--one for West African art and the other for Mesoamerican art--as the Samuel H. and Linda M. Lindenbaum Galleries. Always willing to share his time and wise counsel, Sandy was a consummate colleague who held true to the belief that culture is important in people's lives, and he helped make this great institution even greater for present and future generations of visitors. He will be missed deeply and we offer condolences to Linda and to his entire family. Daniel Brodsky, Chairman Thomas P. Campbell, Director and CEO Emily K. Rafferty, President"

Several nights a week, she ordered Chinese food or pizza. When she did cook, it was the same old stuff: meatloaf, chicken and lots of pasta .There were consequences. Ms. Swank Meili, who lives in Athens, Ohio, kept on an extra 10 pounds after the first baby in 2009 and was worried the same thing would happen after her second daughter was born last year. But with a three-hour window after work to prepare dinner, pack lunches, do laundry and get the girls to bed, there didn't seem to be another way."

(Cinemax) THE AMERICAN (2010) A gun-toting expatriate (George Clooney) arrives in a small Italian town and takes an assignment to build a custom weapon for a sexy assassin (Thekla Reuten) in this film directed by Anton Corbijn from a script by Rowan Joffe. ''I'm out,'' Mr. Clooney's character says at one point, intent on making the kind of human connection that his taciturn temperament and job -- as a hit man perhaps -- have denied him until now. Soon he has become friends with a priest (Paolo Bonacelli) and a prostitute (Violante Placido), who is so enamored of his prowess in bed that she stops charging him. The film, ''filtering out any mention of the character's history and suppressing all but the tiniest indications of emotion, tries to strip the man to his essence,'' A. O. Scott wrote in The New York Times. ''But there is not quite enough there: the still waters run very cool but not terribly deep, and 'The American' falls back into a view of its protagonist that is ultimately more sentimental than unsettling or intriguing.''"

It was a highlight of her last couple of years. Too bad for the rest of us that both are gone. -- KC, Chicago"

Born in New York City on February 9, 1919, she was a proud graduate of Lincoln H.S. in Brooklyn and was among the first women admitted to Baruch College. After graduating with distinction in 1940, her first job was at Balanced Foods, Inc., where she met her beloved husband, the late Samuel H. Reiser. While Sam served overseas in the military, Helen served as his eyes and ears back home, neither ever imaging that the fledgling health foods company would someday be the industry giant it later became. A loyal friend with a quick wit and a ready laugh, Helen was a lifelong New York City enthusiast, an ardent supporter of education and Jewish causes, and a heartfelt patron of the arts. Devoted mother of Rhona (and husband Grover Burgan), Amy, Melanie, and Paul (and wife Paula), she will also be sorely missed by her adored grandchildren Cora, Una, Ruby, Ezra and Leon.

Following two years of service in the U.S. Army, where he attained the rank of captain and received the Army Commendation Medal, and three years as an assistant U.S. attorney in the Southern District of New York, Mr. Gourdine joined the NBA in 1970 as assistant to the commissioner and became vice president of administration in 1973. He was named deputy commissioner in 1974, becoming the highest-ranking African-American executive in sports at the time. In 1976, he was part of the landmark collective bargaining negotiations that created the league's first free agency system, an agreement that also saw the NBA absorb four ABA franchises. Mr. Gourdine left the NBA in 1981 and became commissioner of the New York City Department of Consumer Affairs in 1982. He went on to serve as secretary of the Rockefeller Foundation and director of labor relations for New York's Metropolitan Transit Authority before returning to professional basketball in 1990 as the general counsel of the National Basketball Players Association. He was named its executive director in 1995 and negotiated a new collective bargaining agreement on behalf of the Players Association later that year.

She was raised in Cambridge, Massachusetts where she attended and graduated from the Cambridge School of Weston.

But when a production - in this case ""Antigone Unearthed"" - seems more concerned with pretense than storytelling, head-scratching is sure to ensue.""Antigone,"" by Sophocles, can be a powerful work to revive. The play's inquiries into what is ""right"" versus what is legal, and its questions of whether to defy the state over personal beliefs, are always provocative (particularly in an election year, with echoes of the Occupy movement still in the air). Issues aside, it's also a pretty tense tale."

2012-08-23T00:00:00Z,"''This is not about advice for women,'' said Adrianne Frech, a University of Akron sociologist, of her latest research, which shows that women who work full time after the birth of their first child report better physical health than women who don't. In other words, Dr. Frech's conclusions (drawn from nearly 30 years of longitudinal data that 2,540 mothers provided on their work histories, education and socioeconomic backgrounds) aren't a judgment on an individual woman's choice to work or stay home. Dr. Frech argues that the positive relationship between full-time work and health is less about ''choices'' than about ''constrained choices.''''Women aren't all equally able to find full-time work,'' she said. Many women are steered onto different ''work pathways'' by their histories and their resources. It's those differences, often determined by culture or policy, that Dr. Frech believes set women up for health and other advantages that correlate with the ability to remain in the work force (even after controlling for the other variables)."
