Now, with the state budget facing a devastating $26.5 billion deficit, Gov. Jerry Brown is demanding that agencies immediately stop the practice and determine how much money employees with unpaid loans owe the state."

Yet Mr. Tierney, who managed to be up and walking two weeks after sustaining four broken ribs and three fractured vertebrae, had the pins taken out two weeks ago and is healthy enough to return to rehearsals for ''Spider-Man'' on Monday, his father, Tim, said in an interview on Thursday. ''The doctors originally thought he'd have the pins in for another three months, but his physical comeback has gone well and they gave him the O.K. early this week to go back into the cast,'' Tim Tierney said. He acknowledged that the return was unusually quick, but noted that Christopher would not perform again without his doctors' clearance, given that all shows require insurance for their cast members.

There are mega-bucks, big-box spaces on the same block as holes in the wall not much larger than a walk-in closet; great work within a stone's throw of schlock; older art alongside the freshly minted; and blue-chip brand names across the street from young and emerging artists or forgotten and overlooked ones. Chelsea's inconsistencies and jarring juxtapositions give it the air of a permanent, slightly crazed art fair for which all entrance requirements have long since been abandoned. After nearly 20 years as a gallery destination, and despite a spate of sleek new apartment buildings, it is still nothing but art, and it still feels surprisingly raw -- gentrified but not especially gentled. This may be partly a function of its wide streets, its riverside perch and its often brusque winds, but some of the rawness has to do with the staggering quantity and diversity of the art that confronts you at every turn, and what it says about the human urge to make art and have it seen."

Whether enjoying summer vacations in Montauk with her sons, planning holiday gatherings, traveling to Italy with her close friend Suzanne, or decorating with Nancy, Maria knew how to be in the moment and enjoy life to the fullest. She lived and taught a profound understanding of the importance of Family, Faith, and Friendship, and this is the legacy she gives to her sons, and all of us. She will be loved and remembered always.

And since Johnny Byron is portrayed by Mark Rylance, in a seismic performance that threatens to level the old Music Box Theater, this registers as utterly natural cause and effect. Sounds like a joke, doesn't it? I mean, the idea of someone making the earth move when you look into his eyes is the sort of notion you find in cheap romance novels or a sci-fi comic book. And Mr. Rylance's character in ''Jerusalem,'' which opened on Thursday night in an enthralling production directed by Ian Rickson, seems on first acquaintance like a pretty sad joke himself: a boastful wreck of a man held together by drugs and drink, existing as a 24-hour party guy in a squalid mobile home in the English countryside."

Insurgents nearly overran it in 2009. Last year mortars rained down on the base nearly every other day. But security has vastly improved here. The outpost, in the northeastern mountains of Paktika Province, has not been shelled since late last summer, due largely, soldiers here believe, to a shift in tactics that started when a new unit came in and began relentlessly patrolling the surrounding mountains, always on foot and usually at night. The incessant patrols took away the insurgents' vantage points, and they have barely engaged since."

Uncle Charlie was a compassionate and patient man who always had a kind word and helping hand to all. A lifelong traveler with his bride Jane, Uncle Charlie enjoyed exploring and learning. His loyalty to the New York Islanders and Mets ran deep despite long draughts of winning. Uncle Charlie's magic was his smile and laugh that made everyone feel his warmth. Through the ups and downs of life, Uncle Charlie's deep faith in God, family, and friends provided a steady compass to all around him. His love and rock solid friendship to the Wait Family, will never be forgotten. God Bless Uncle Charlie and Go Islanders! Jarett, Younghee, Unjo and Uno Wait"

2011-04-22T00:00:00Z,"A cheery, chummy documentary about the pastoral patterns inaccurately described as crop circles, Suzanne Taylor's ''What on Earth?'' musters a gaggle of enthusiasts to dish on the phenomenon. They're a diverse bunch -- farmers and philosophers, scientists and a singer-songwriter -- and Ms. Taylor, a former actress who first became involved with the group in the early 1990s, uses her familiarity to encourage them to open up. Merging homey interviews with photographs and film of the hundreds of varieties of patterns (which pop up mysteriously overnight and are found all over the world), the film makes no pretense of objectivity or analysis. Everyone on screen -- most sporting little blue flowers in their lapels, like a club insignia -- is convinced of an intelligence behind the designs."

While the papers do not reveal the amount of damages being sought -- all figures are redacted -- they make reference to players seeking compensatory damages of ''hundreds of millions of dollars.''
2011-04-22T00:00:00Z,"Because of an editing error, an article on Tuesday about Geoffrey Mutai's performance in the Boston Marathon, the fastest marathon ever run, misstated a reason that his time, 2 hours 3 minutes 2 seconds, was not an official world record. In addition to the course's elevation drop, it is because its start and finish are separated by more than 50 percent of the race distance; the type of course -- whether point-to-point or loop -- is not a determining factor. The error was repeated in a picture caption with the article and in the On Running column."

2011-04-22T00:00:00Z,"Sometimes an impenetrable dance piece seems a lot more graspable a day later. Fragments cohere and take on a life of their own; strange bits of movement stick in your mind; a spoken phrase resonates and will forever remind you of a particular moment. Perhaps that's what all successful performance does. It pulls you into the specificity of a moment. But although MGM Grand's ''Nut,'' which opened a three-night run at the Kitchen on Wednesday, possesses the requisite impenetrability, it never achieves specificity. Instead, it keeps floating vaguely around ideas that are quite possibly perfectly obvious to MGM's female trio -- Biba Bell, Jmy Leary, Piage Martin -- but annoyingly opaque to the audience."

2011-04-23T19:22:08Z,"Although loaded with defensive-line talent, this N.F.L. draft class is not considered strong. It includes a record 56 underclassmen, many of whom are difficult to evaluate because of their limited college experience. There is no clear-cut No. 1 pick because of quarterback Andrew Luck’s decision to remain at Stanford and because of the uncertainty about what the Carolina Panthers will do. There is a dearth of N.F.L.-ready quarterbacks, but Auburn’s Cam Newton may rise to the first overall spot if his extraordinary athletic ability outweighs concerns about how quickly he can learn a pro-style offense and questions about his character. There are so many questions about players projected to be picked in the first round that Charley Casserly, the former Redskins and Texans general manager, said, “There’s a lot of guys that are kind of scary.”"

This is a subject I’ve written about a good deal in Cambodia, India, Pakistan and elsewhere abroad, and there’s sometimes a tendency to think that the problem just exists overseas, or just among foreign women smuggled in the the U.S. It’s true that the worst places in the world for forced prostitution maybe Pakistan, India, Bangladesh, Nepal, Cambodia, Burma, and so on. But we also have significant problems in the United States — particularly among home-grown young teenagers — and we don’t have the credibility to address the problems abroad unless we clean up our act at home."

The a la carte menu has Louisiana crawfish gumbo fritters, oysters with chayote mignonette, scallops with honey grits, and cornflake-crusted chicken stuffed with andouille and cheddar.

2011-04-23T00:00:00Z,"''The Dark Knight Returns,'' by Frank Miller, is one of the seminal stories of the 1980s. Along with ''Watchmen,'' by Alan Moore and Dave Gibbons, it introduced a new level of mature storytelling to comic books. And a Dark Knight fan (with deep pockets) now has a chance to own a part of history. The original artwork for the splash page from issue No. 3, which features Batman leaping through the skyline along with his new Robin, Carrie Kelley, the first female to hold that role, is up for bidding at Heritage Auctions. The bid is currently at $100,000. The page will be on view beginning April 27 at the offices of Heritage Auctions and then at the Fletcher-Sinclair, the home of the Ukrainian Institute of America, from May 1 through the auction on May 5. ''The Dark Knight Returns'' depicts a bleak future in which an older Batman comes out of retirement to clean up a Gotham City run amok with a new breed of mutant lowlifes. Adding to the tension: a new cold war is brewing that pushes the world to the edge of nuclear strife. There's also a conflict with Superman, who remains young and is one of the only heroes still active. ''I've always loved that drawing,'' Mr. Miller said when asked about its impending auction. ''Danced around my studio like a fool when I drew it. I hope it finds a good home.''"

Six editions of ''The Clock'' were for sale, and all but one will end up in a museum, said Steven Henry, a director of the Paula Cooper Gallery, which represents Mr. Marclay in New York. The Los Angeles County Museum of Art acquired one of the six pieces, the Los Angeles Times reported, and, according to the Art Newspaper, the Tate and the Museum of Modern Art are in negotiations to buy two of the others. Mr. Henry said he couldn't name the other museums because of the ongoing negotiations. Asked if some museums that wanted to buy ''The Clock'' were told no, he said: ''Yes, of course. It's a pretty desirable piece.'' And the price? The Los Angeles Times reported that the Los Angeles County Museum paid less than $500,000. Mr. Henry declined to comment."

''Clybourne Park,'' an acid-washed diptych of a play about American race relations, is playing not on Broadway, but in London's West End, at the venerable Wyndham's Theater, to be exact (where it runs through May 7). Earlier this year, Mr. Norris's stinging satire picked up the Olivier Award for Best Play. That's the British equivalent of the Tony, a prize that ''Clybourne Park'' never had a shot at, since it never made it to Broadway. It opened and closed Off Broadway last year, after a limited run at Playwrights Horizons."

This is Mr. Stiefel's final year as dean. He is to take on the role of artistic director of the Royal New Zealand Ballet in September. ''Leading the U.N.C.S.A.

Eva Mendes portrays Gamble's unlikely wife. Writing in The New York Times, A. O. Scott said that the movie raised ''expectations that it has no real inclination to fulfill.''

Jones, who retired from Hearst Corporation in 1995 and served on the Corporation's Board of Directors beginning in 1982, joined Hearst in 1979 and was instrumental in building Hearst's book and business publishing businesses. Most recently, he was a vice president of Hearst Corporation and group head of Hearst Books/Business Publishing. During his tenure, Hearst acquired William Morrow & Company and added it to Avon and Hearst Books to significantly expand its book-publishing activities. After his retirement, Jones served as a consultant to Hearst Corporation. ""Gordon was a very important participant in the dramatic growth of Hearst Corporation during the 1980s and 1990s,"" said Frank A. Bennack, Jr., CEO of Hearst Corporation. ""He was instrumental in building what today are our business media operations. We will indeed miss Gordon."" Jones also played a role in the acquisition, from Cox Enterprises, of United Technical Publishing Co., a portfolio of trade publications, technical manuals and marketing data. Diversion magazine and its related activities were also acquired and added to the Group in the mid-1980s. Prior to Hearst, Jones was president of McGraw-Hill Publications Company. During his more than 26 years with McGraw-Hill, he served in numerous positions, including publisher of Electronics magazine; general manager, new products, for BusinessWeek; and senior vice president-marketing of McGraw-Hill Publications. From 1948 to 1950, Jones played professional baseball for the Cleveland Indians. A native of Los Angeles, he received his bachelor's from the University of Southern California. He is survived by his wife, the former Marilyn Holter, and their five children and 14 grandchildren. A memorial service will be held on Saturday, June 4, 2011, at 11am, at the First Presbyterian Church of New Canaan in New Canaan, Conn.

2011-04-23T00:00:00Z,"Kate Whoriskey, picked by Bartlett Sher to succeed him as artistic director of Intiman Theater in Seattle, is parting ways with that beleaguered institution, at least for now. Faced with a cash crisis, the Intiman board voted last weekend to cancel the rest of the season, which started just last month, and to lay off the theater's staff. While the board hopes to reopen Intiman next year, Ms. Whoriskey said in a telephone interview that she is returning this weekend to New York, where she has an apartment, and will resume her freelance directing career. ''I've never been in a position where I've had to tell so many people that they don't have work, and it's very hard,'' she said. As to whether she would return to Intiman, she said that if the board reached a point where they wanted to rehire her, ''I would be open to a conversation.'' The president of Intiman's board, Bruce Bradburn, said that the board was trying to regroup for now and didn't know what Ms. Whoriskey's future role would be. He said that she had offered various kinds of assistance in the efforts to rethink Intiman's business model, including the possibility of holding a public discussion that she would participate in. ''And of course if she's back freelance directing again, we certainly would like to have her back to do a play,'' he added. ''We've just got to figure out over the next six months where we're going.''Susan Trapnell, a consultant who is working with the board, said that it had a lot of work to do before they could hire Ms. Whoriskey, or anyone else, to run Intiman. ''They have to be 100 percent behind their artist,'' she said. ''There's no reason for Kate right now to sacrifice a career to bringing this theater back, unless she knows the theater is trying to come back or sees a way to come back'' in a form that ''can serve her vision.''"

2011-04-24T00:00:00Z,"The schoolhouse at the end of the world is a simple affair. Made of concrete and painted gray, it bears the white star of the Central Asia Institute, the nonprofit group co-founded by Greg Mortenson. The group says it has built more than 170 schools in Pakistan and Afghanistan. This one stands at 12,480 feet in Bozai Gumbaz, a corner of northeastern Afghanistan that is cold, rocky and barren. The clear waters of the Wakhan River flow from a nearby glacier. The school is ringed by brown lunar peaks on a wind-swept plateau, the Little Pamir, the most remote stretch of land in a remote nation. One afternoon last August, after a light snowfall, I walked through the small building. It had no desks and chairs. Wooden planks and sawdust lay on the floor. The schoolhouse, completed in 2009 and the centerpiece of Mr. Mortenson's second book, ''Stones Into Schools,'' had never been used."
2011-04-24T00:00:00Z,"MAGAZINE An article on April 10 about Middle School 223 in the Bronx misstated the reasons the school does not qualify for some state financing earmarked for poorly performing schools. It does not meet some of New York State's criteria for failing schools and it is relatively successful on state tests and other measures. It is not because of the school's report card from New York City. The article also omitted an attribution for the increases in percentages of students at or above grade levels in math and English from 2006 to 2010. Those figures came from the New York City Department of Education, which did its own analysis of state testing data using 2010 proficiency levels for 2006 test scores. (Without that adjustment, the percentage of proficient learners in both math and English actually dropped from 2006 to 2010.)"

Born in New York on April 19, 1912, son of Max Friedman and Blanche Rose Rabinowitz Friedman. Dr. Friedman was a graduate of Columbia University and Baylor University College of Medicine where he received his M.D. in 1936, completed his internship in 1938, and finished his residency in 1939. A member of international medical fraternity Phi Delta Epsilon, he served three years in the U.S. Army and completed a residency program at the Veterans Affairs Hospital in the Bronx. In 1946, he became Associate Attending Physician for Thoracic Disease at Mount Sinai Hospital in New York. A year later, he was appointed Associate Clinical Professor of Medicine at Mount Sinai. After a successful career specializing in pulmonary disorders, Dr. Friedman retired in 1988. After the war Dr. Friedman set aside time to serve as a medical consultant to assist returning veterans. His stepdaughters Helen Seplowitz of Stamford, CT and Anita Karo of Langhorne, PA, grandsons Kevin and Eric Seplowitz and families and cousins including Gertrude Lang, Carl Danson, Peter Lang, Jo Lang and their families survive him. His wife of 25 years, Frances Karo Friedman, predeceased him in 2005. Dr. Friedman described her as ""the light of my life, and in every sense of the word, an angel liberal, kind, and thoughtful."" Together the Friedman's traveled extensively in Israel, Russia, China, Scandinavia, England, and France. They resided in New York and Lauderhill, Florida for many years. Dr. Friedman shared generously with a significant number of charities including Woods School in Langhorne, PA; Rabbi Jacob Joseph School; Congregation Agudath Sholom; United Jewish Federation; Memorial Sloan-Kettering Hospital; Mount Sinai Medical Center, where he was an Alumni Life Member; and Baylor College of Medicine, where he was a proud member of the Jaworski Society and had established the Frances K. Friedman and Oscar Friedman, M.D. '36 Endowed Fund for Pulmonary Disorders. Charitable contributions in Dr. Friedman's memory may be made to any of these fine charities."

2011-04-24T00:00:00Z,"The most eye-catching theme in the first round of the N.H.L. playoffs has been the comebacks staged on three consecutive nights by the Sharks (from four goals down to beat the Kings), the Capitals (from three goals down to shock the Rangers) and the Bruins (from three goals down to defeat the Canadiens). But through the 35 games played through Friday, teams have not posted comeback victories as frequently as they have in past postseasons. The statistics show that teams scoring the first goal are more likely to win the game than at any time since the 2004-5 lockout, when the N.H.L. instituted new rules and tighter enforcement to benefit offense - or indeed in any playoff year since the turn of the millennium."
2011-04-24T00:00:00Z,"Although loaded with defensive-line talent, this N.F.L. draft class is not considered strong. It includes a record 56 underclassmen, many of whom are difficult to evaluate because of their limited college experience. There is no clear-cut No. 1 pick because of quarterback Andrew Luck's decision to remain at Stanford and because of the uncertainty about what the Carolina Panthers will do. There is a dearth of N.F.L.-ready quarterbacks, but Auburn's Cam Newton may rise to the first overall spot if his extraordinary athletic ability outweighs concerns about how quickly he can learn a pro-style offense and questions about his character. There are so many questions about players projected to be picked in the first round that Charley Casserly, the former Redskins and Texans general manager, said, ''There's a lot of guys that are kind of scary.'' ''Quarterback is the highlight of the draft because you've got so many teams that would have filled quarterback needs in the off-season,'' Casserly said. ''Now that they don't have it, do they become more aggressive trading up? I don't see the conviction by people with these quarterbacks.''"

He's someone with a solid base of knowledge, a light hand with details and an ego that rarely intrudes. We met in 2008, when he took over Halston. Hardly anyone knew him; he had been Donatella Versace's assistant for many years. But Mr. Zanini brought a clean vitality to Halston, especially to the day clothes. That show remains a favorite of mine -- and it was his only Halston collection, because within a few months he and the owners parted ways. Then he got the gig at Rochas, and he's taken a completely different approach with the sporty French label.

2011-04-24T00:00:00Z,"DALIS--Mandell. Founder of PACS Industries, a Great Neck, NY based manufacturer of switchgear for electric power supply, died on April 19. He was 84. Mr. Dalis founded PACS in 1972 with General Electric as his first customer, and grew it into a multimillion-dollar company that builds electrical switchgear and substations across the United States and the world. The company's most significant projects have included Citifield, The New York Times, La Guardia Airport, South East Pennsylvania Transit Authority, and Metro North Railroad. In 2007, Mr. Dalis was awarded a patent for the development of a new type of arc-resistant switchgear to increase worker safety and recently licensed it to Point Eight Power of New Orleans. Earlier this month, PACS, which also maintains a factory in Mount Vernon, Ohio, received an investment from Delta Point Capital Partners for a controlling interest in the company. The investment will enable Mr. Dalis' legacy to grow into the future. Born in Brooklyn on October 31, 1926, Mr. Dalis built his first radio at age nine. He later attended high school during daytime hours for academics while simultaneously attending vocational school at night to study radio and television repair. At 17, he enlisted in the United States Army. Because he was under age, his mother, a Russian immigrant, had to sign for him, which she did because of her gratitude to the United States and all of its opportunities. Mr. Dalis was among the first troops to occupy Japan following World War II. After the war, Mr. Dalis worked as a television and radio repairman, and met and married Juliet Meyer in 1951. He subsequently attended Pratt Institute under the GI Bill and received a degree in electrical engineering. Proud of his Jewish heritage, he served as president of Temple Emanuel of Great Neck for four years. He is survived by Juliet and three children: Bruce Dalis of Bayville, NY; Beth Manners of Westport, CT; Leslie Watnik of Sands Point, NY; and nine grandchildren."

So I am very well attuned to rearranged aisles, new cashiers and the latest innovations. Recently, though, I've noticed a trend that has nothing to do with selling groceries. On a single shopping trip, I spotted three of the five cashiers texting while working, their cellphones strategically placed next to the registers so that they could quickly glance at incoming messages. Weigh a head of broccoli, eyeball the cell. Scan the chicken cutlets, check a text. Onion, text. Milk, text. Cheerios, text, text, text.

She graduated from Lake Forest High School in 1994, and went on to attend the University of Virginia, where she received a Bachelors, of Science degree in Architecture in 1998.

In August 2004, Susan married Eric Fleiss, the love of her life. The couple had three children (Teddy, born in April 2007, and twins, Benjamin and Caroline, born in March 2010). As a mother, Susan brought her creativity and imagination into every aspect of parenthood. She was an incredible playmate to her children, and taught them to see the beautiful in the every day.

2011-04-25T12:37:30Z,"Indie record shops generally look like Championship Vinyl, the music-geek hangout owned by John Cusack in “High Fidelity,” which is to say the closest they get to décor is the album covers on the wall. “Everyone asks why we don’t have records on the wall,” says Ian Marshall, the co-owner, along with his wife, Jade Gordon, of L.A.’s Wombleton Records. “It’s like it’s some sort of requirement. But when we opened the store we knew we’d be spending a lot of time here and that’s not really the kind of environment we wanted to be in.” Instead, the couple has created a used-record shop that resembles a Victorian parlor, right down to the embossed wallpaper and potted plants. Marshall, a self-described Anglophile who grew up outside of Toronto but spent his school holidays visiting family in Britain, wanted the Highland Park store to have an English feel, a conceit that extends to its name, a play on the popular British children’s books (and later a BBC series) about the Wombles. To get Wombleton’s 19th-century ambience just right, the couple spent hours trawling eBay for vintage furniture and prevailed upon friends like David Donohue, a graphic designer and surf board builder who made the harpsichord-shaped record bins, and Nic Taylor and Jennifer Brandt-Taylor of Thunderwing Press, who created the store’s logo, a stagecoach on LP wheels. “Which is very apt,” Marshall says. “We spend a lot of time in foreign countries, driving around in rental cars looking for records.” But perhaps the most refreshing quality about Wombleton is its lack of snobbery. Unlike Barry and Dick (Jack Black and Todd Louima), “the musical moron twins” who staffed Championship Vinyl, Marshall and Gordon, who stock an eclectic mix of British pop from the ’60s, ’70s and ’80s, won’t deride your taste. “I’m a bottom feeder,” Marshall says, laughing. “I like crap. I’m not afraid to buy the 50-cent disco album that nobody wants.”"

So far, Scholes and his team (which includes Sean Latham at the University of Tulsa) have digitized 18 magazines: all 47 issues of The Freewoman and all 13 of The New Freewoman, an early feminist journal that espoused free love; the first nine volumes of the Little Review, which published 13 episodes of Joyce’s “Ulysses,” before being forced to stop due to obscenity charges, and, under the aegis of Pound as “foreign editor,” such writers as Djuna Barnes, Gertrude Stein and T.S. Eliot; the two issues of  Wyndham Lewis’s vorticist zine Blast;  the more visual Rhythm, which published several designs for the Ballets Russes, among them “L’après-midi d’un faune”; as well as such well-known journals as Scribner’s Magazine.

This beautifully presented collection of articles written by Wind from 1954 to 1989 allows the reader to sample his work from various times in his long career at The New Yorker (along with two articles he wrote for a nascent Sports Illustrated). No passage is ever abbreviated or fleeting, but perhaps because it is a compilation and not a traditional narrative, it is more like a journey, with flowing missives from a familiar place."

2011-04-25T00:00:00Z,"11 P.M. (Sundance) MY SO-CALLED LIFE Angela Chase (Claire Danes), Jordan Catalano (Jared Leto) and their angst-ridden classmates at Liberty High School return in reruns of this groundbreaking ABC series, which appeared from August 1994 to January 1995. Created by Winnie Holzman, with Marshall Herskovitz and Edward Zwick as executive producers -- part of the team behind ''Thirtysomething'' -- the show earned critical acclaim for addressing topics like child abuse, homophobia, teenage alcoholism and bullying. Reviewing the series in The New York Times, Bruce Weber wrote that Ms. Danes ''is refreshingly playing her age, and, unlike most youthful television stars, is far less adorable than skilled.'' Her Angela is ''confused, all right: about sex, about her parents, about what it means to have an identity,'' he said. ''But she's smart enough to sulk over these things, often with a pungent, self-deprecating wit.'' Still, with others in the cast to pick up the slack, ''she isn't overburdened carrying the drama,'' he added. ''So even when her so-called life isn't compelling, her world generally is.'' From left above, Devon Gummersall, A. J. Langer, Ms. Danes, Wilson Cruz and Devon Odessa. 8 P.M. (Fox Movie Channel) THE BLUE BIRD (1976) Two peasant children (Todd Lookinland and Patsy Kensit) are instructed by the Queen of Light (Elizabeth Taylor, in head-to-toe jewels) to seek the Blue Bird of Happiness in this adaptation of Maurice Maeterlinck's fairy tale, directed by George Cukor. The international cast includes Ava Gardner (Luxury), Jane Fonda (Night), George Cole (Dog), Cicely Tyson (Cat) and members of the Leningrad Kirov Ballet. Writing in The Times, Vincent Canby said that while ''The Blue Bird'' was one movie, audiences couldn't help but see two films: ''One of these films is blandly American, like the sort of processed cheese sold in jars that can later be used as water glasses. The other is dimly Russian but without any real Russian character, except for the sets, which aren't great. They look like stuff left over from the Bolshoi Opera's last road tour.'' Then there was the problem of the birds. ''Some look like black birds and some are simply pigeons dyed blue.'' He added, ''No New Yorker in his right mind would cross a street to look for a pigeon.''"
2011-04-25T00:00:00Z,"McWorld, a Web site for children sponsored by McDonald's, offers visitors the chance to create characters, decorate digital treehouses and go on a quest in a virtual world. French fries, hamburgers and apple pies are nowhere to be seen. This is the latest in online marketing, where the hope is that a site's visitor will naturally associate the brand with a pleasurable activity. It is a type of advertising that has less in common with a 30-second television spot than with a product placement in a movie. It is also a glimpse of the future, said Mark Smale, a senior vice president with Creata, the Australian company that created the site for McDonald's. Mr. Smale said in an interview that companies are realizing that, when going online, the best strategy is to forgo immediate sales in order to build lasting emotional relationships with children. In that sense, McWorld is a more sophisticated version of the sites that Matt Richtel discusses in an article about the online marketing of food to children."
2011-04-25T00:00:00Z,"Alec Baldwin is set to appear in August at one of the theater world's leading events, the Edinburgh Festival Fringe, playing the ghost of Hamlet's father. But he won't be there to deliver his performances. With a busy summer that includes filming the movie version of the Broadway show ''Rock of Ages'' and preparing for a sixth season of ''30 Rock,'' Mr. Baldwin, above, will tape his scenes as Old Hamlet's ghost for the New York-based Fundamental Theater Project's fringe production ''3D Hamlet: A Lost Generation,'' said Fundamental's artistic director, Sam Underwood. Mr. Baldwin and Mr. Underwood starred in a production of ''Equus'' last summer in East Hampton, N.Y. Mr. Underwood, who will alternate in the role of Hamlet with Anthony Rapp (''Rent''), said in an interview that ''3D Hamlet'' would blend multimedia elements with Shakespeare's text ''to create an interactive perspective for the audience and a feeling that they are part of the action.'' Mr. Underwood said he was looking into using a 3-D camera to record Mr. Baldwin's scenes, which audience members would watch through special glasses. Kate Mulgrew (''Star Trek: Voyager'') will also star in the production as Hamlet's mother, Gertrude. Mr. Underwood, who said he was directing and producing the work with fellow Fundamental members, said the play would have a short run in New York in July."

2011-04-25T00:00:00Z,"SCHLAFLY--Hubert J. (""Hub""), Jr.,91, of Stamford, Connecticut, died peacefully on April 20, 2011, at Stamford Hospital, after a brief illness. Born on August 14, 1919, in St. Louis, Missouri, he was the only child of Hubert, Sr. and Mary Rose Parker Schlafly. He was predeceased by his parents and his wife of 59 years, Leona Martin Schlafly, who died in 2003. He is survived by many relatives. An electrical engineering graduate of the University of Notre Dame (1941), Hub is best known for developing the teleprompter in collaboration with Irving Berlin Kahn and Fred Barton, Jr., and for co-founding the TelePrompTer Corporation. The teleprompter made its debut in 1950 on a soap opera called, ""The First Hundred Years."" In 1952, Herbert Hoover became the first politician to use it when he gave the keynote address to the Republican National Convention. Hub helped shape the modern television industry. He developed the first pay TV system that permitted subscribers to order programs delivered by cable. He executed the first satellite transmission of a cable program from Washington, D.C., to a convention of 3,000 cable operators in Anaheim, Calif. (June 1973). It was the first time a satellite was used to transmit cable programming and allowed one to go up to satellites from anywhere and transmit everywhere and transformed the industry. He engineered the HBO satellite transmission of the ""Thrilla in Manila"" boxing match between Muhammad Ali and Joe Frazier. Hub received an Emmy Award for the teleprompter and another for his outstanding engineering achievement for cable television technology. He was named a ""Cable Television Pioneer"" by the National Cable Television Association. He received the Sarnoff Citation for his contributions to cable television and the Vanguard Award for Science and Technology from the National Cable and Telecommunications Association. He was inducted into the Cable Television Hall of Fame. He held 16 patents. At WNET, New York City's public media provider, the convergence lab was named in Hub's honor. He supported numerous charities, including a scholarship program for minority students in engineering and the Schlafly Electronic Circuits Laboratory at Notre Dame. A Digital Media Lab at Sacred Heart University in Fairfield, CT, was dedicated in his honor. Hub funded the Chapel of the Nativity at that university to honor his wife. Hub was a member of the Order of Malta and was a Knight of Saint Gregory the Great. Friends may call at Saint Mary Parish, 178 Greenwich Avenue, Greenwich, CT 06830, from 4-8pm on Monday, April 25, 2011. A Mass of Christian burial will take place at 10am on Tuesday, April 26, 2011, at Saint Mary Parish. Hub will be laid to rest next to his beloved wife, Lee, on April 28, 2011, in Louisville, NY."

2011-04-26T12:01:59Z,"So Haley Barbour, who seemed like a near-lock to join the Republican field in 2012, has decided to join the ranks of Republican Mario Cuomos instead. It’s an understandable decision: Barbour’s strengths as a politician notwithstanding, his personal profile — a corpulent ex-lobbyist and quintessential Washington insider who’s also the governor of a deep-red state identified with secession and segregation — made him perhaps the least electable of the various would-be establishment candidates, and his famous political acumen was apparently acute enough to recognize that thick rolodexes alone do not a credible candidacy make. (See Gramm, Phil and Connally, John, among others.) Still, his departure leaves a thin G.O.P. field looking thinner (no pun intended), and it removes a candidate who had the wisdom to greet our Libyan intervention with a blunt: “What are we doing in Libya?” For that alone, he will be missed."

The movie, directed by Mike Fleiss and Mike Piscitelli, chronicles Mr. Osbourne’s life — 62 years, if you can believe it, and counting — from his upbringing in Birmingham, England, through his years with Black Sabbath and as a solo performer, through his grieving for the accidental death of his guitarist Randy Rhoads, to the aftermath of his reality show, while a cloud of alcohol and drug abuse hangs over him. In addition to interviews with Mr. Osbourne and his band mates past and present, the film offers candid testimonials from his wife, Sharon, and children Jack and Kelly, as well as his little-seen daughter Aimee (who declined to be part of the reality series) and children Louis and Jessica (from a previous marriage)."

On the one side, there is the professional couple bringing in six figures a year; on the other, the nanny or maid without whom the couple wouldn’t be able to practice their professions. Conditions of employment are as variable as the individual employers are — from respectful and considerate all the way to criminally abusive. On average, a domestic worker is likely to get less than $15 an hour, no benefits and none of the credit or glory. To my knowledge anyway, there has never been a successful career woman — or man, for that matter — who’s responded to being praised for “doing it all” by saying, “Actually, Manuela (or Angelica or Harriet) does most of it.”"

The documentary is based on the book ''The Third Man Factor: Surviving the Impossible,'' by John Geiger, who is an author, with Owen Beattie, of ''Frozen in Time: The Fate of the Franklin Expedition'' and the president of the Royal Canadian Geographical Society. 8 P.M.

Over all, Broadway shows grossed $28.9 million, up from $23.9 million the week before. ''The Lion King'' edged out the usual No. 1 show, ''Wicked,'' though both family-oriented productions grossed almost $2 million apiece, in part by charging premium ticket prices of $250 and $300, respectively, for many seats. Adult fare also proved lucrative: The critically acclaimed ''Book of Mormon'' set a house record for the Eugene O'Neill Theater last week, grossing $1,014,228 - a significant achievement for a theater with just 1,066 seats. (The previous record was set in 2007 by ''Spring Awakening.'')

That means a few things are likely. First, we’ll hear a lot about what a huge upset this is, given that the Spurs, who had the second-best record in the league this year, have won four championships in the last dozen years and the Grizzlies have never won a playoff game before this series began. Second, we’ll get lots of analysis about how the Spurs let things get away from them. And third, what attention is given to the Grizzlies and what they did right won’t include much about the contributions of their player Shane Battier."

Mello artfully retrofitted the décor to its new use: the large metal ovens now double as changing rooms for cool garb like neon swimsuits, and the flour silos provide spacious storage.

But the proposals that eventually became the Affordable Care Act/Obamacare at least took the the system’s pathologies seriously, drew on some of the smartest liberal health care wonkery, and tried to grapple with the scale of the problems they were confronting. The Republicans, on the other hand, never coalesced around a substantial alternative, declined to embrace the best proposals from conservative policy thinkers, and generally made a purely negative (and sometimes cynical) case against the Democratic bill, rather than setting out a convincing and rigorous alternative."

2011-04-27T11:00:46Z,"On May 4 the Icelandic capital will celebrate the opening of the Harpa-Reykjavik Concert Hall and Conference Center, a stunning monolith whose shimmering glass facade was designed by the artist Olafur Eliasson. The building will be the new home of the Icelandic Opera and the Iceland Symphony Orchestra (which previously had to make do with performing in movie theaters), and for the opening celebration there will be concerts by local bands like Mammút and Agent Fresco as well as screenings of nature movies and documentaries. Many Icelanders hope the building, conceived of as a new cultural hot spot for the city, will also be a tourist draw during the long, dark winters — a fact of life that was central to the design. “In Iceland, 30 percent of the day is twilight. One third of people’s lives are lived in this transitional zone,” says Eliasson, whose facade reflects the low northern light in bewitching variation, as though it is lit from within. “The relationship people in Iceland have to the landscape is like the relationship you have to a close family member. It has to do with the way the light gives the landscape a constantly changing personality. It speaks to you with such finesse.”"

The 38 percent of Americans who believe slavery was mainly to blame find themselves losing ground."

First, the “secret file” contains information about nearby Wi-Fi hot spots and cell towers, not your exact location. And second, your device is sending information to Apple, although in an anonymous, encrypted form. One part of Apple’s response is a little unconvincing, says David Pogue.

2011-04-28T13:43:49Z,"I appreciate the small-r republican ardor with which Mark Oppenheimer assails America’s royal wedding obsessives, but he’s fighting a losing battle. “Americans are supposed to loathe and reject monarchs,” he writes, but it’s telling that all his examples of that loathing (“In the earliest years of English settlement, this land was a proud haven for king killers … [we] fought a bloody war for the privilege to ignore the king of England … Anti-monarchism was then written into our Constitution …”) are centuries old, dating from a time when republicanism was an exciting cause rather than a somewhat-ossified assumption. Since those days, we’ve regressed to the (very human) mean: We’re fascinated by the royal family that we once overthrew, we have our own hereditary dynasties (and the slobbering coverage to match), and we’ve gradually turned our presidency into a quasi-imperial office, complete with coronations and cultic devotions and all the rest. True, by the standards of modern history, with its parade of strongmen and caudillos and presidents-for-life, our republican institutions have been impressively resilient. But even the American experience suggests that the anti-monarchical temper Oppenheimer invokes is ultimately artificial and unnatural, a triumph of theory over instinct and idealism over human nature. In their hearts, most people want a king and queen."

""Mike"" survived WWII in heroic fashion, caught several times by the Nazis, he helped his family survive.

Ballet Theater announced Wednesday that Mr. Ratmansky, who had been committed to the troupe through 2013, agreed to the extension two years before his previous contract was up. The terms remain unchanged: he is to spend 20 weeks a season with the company and choreograph at least one new work a year or restage one of his older dances."

One of the most compelling designs comes courtesy of Olaf Nicolai, who suggests that collectors mark the initials of someone they love or hate using his codified variation on the alphabet. In designing his alphabet, Nicolai says that he “found [a] minimalistic style more interesting,” which didn’t function “like a billboard.” (In other words, you’re out of luck if you’re looking for hearts pierced by daggers or busty mermaids.)

In the scene, shown above, Ms. Rice, a former secretary of state and classically trained pianist, challenged Mr. Baldwin, a Lincoln Center regular himself, to a musical face-off. (Mr. Baldwin does not actually perform in the episode.) We asked Anthony Tommasini, the chief classical music critic of The Times, who interviewed Ms. Rice about her chamber music experience in a profile in 2005, to identify the pieces. “They are all by Mozart,” he said. “The first is the opening of the third movement, the Rondo, from the Piano Quartet in G minor. The second is the opening of the first movement, the Allegro, of that same Piano Quartet in G minor. The third, and this gets complicated, is the slow movement, the Romanze, of the Piano Concerto No. 20 in D minor, not the opening of the movement, but the beginning of the fast middle section of that movement. Whew.” For insiders, Mr. Tommasini said, “the joke is the snippets of pieces played are not at all pieces for flute.” He added, “He tried to match her playing this music on the solo flute, an unfair match.”"

Imjingak, the site of a ferocious battle during the Korean War, has become a favored launching site for some of the South Korean activists who send propaganda balloons northward. The balloon campaign has so angered North Korea that its military has threatened -- as recently as last Friday -- to ''mercilessly'' shell Imjingak and other border towns if the launchings continue. North Korean artillery units are dug in a few kilometers away, just across the world's most heavily militarized border."
2011-04-29T00:00:00Z,"Generally regarded as the greatest leadoff hitter ever, Rickey Henderson thrilled baseball fans for a quarter century by stealing a major league-record 1,406 bases. Along the way, his feats on the base paths fueled the stereotype that speed is the leadoff man's defining tool. But it wasn't his base stealing that made him so effective in the leadoff spot; rather, it was his ability to get on base to begin with. From a sabermetric perspective, the cardinal rule of leadoff hitting is to avoid making an out. The No. 1 spot in the order comes to the plate on average 4.8 times a game, nearly a full plate appearance more than the No. 9 hitter at 3.9, according to ''The Book: Playing the Percentages in Baseball,'' a baseball research reference by Tom Tango, Mitchel Lichtman and Andrew Dolphin. A table-setter like Henderson must be able to consistently provide run-scoring opportunities to the players batting behind him. He cannot score, let alone steal, if he is not on base."

It did to Joseph Duveen, the art dealer, whose efforts in the 1930s to persuade the art historian Bernard Berenson to change the attribution from one to the other are the subject of Simon Gray's play ''The Old Masters,'' which recently ended a run at the Long Wharf Theater in New Haven. And it matters to museums like the Metropolitan Museum of Art, which will host two staged readings of the play, on June 20 and 27. The readings will feature the Long Wharf cast, with Sam Waterston playing Berenson and Brian Murray playing Duveen. The Met's spokesman, Harold Holzer, said the museum had a long connection with Duveen, owning more than 120 European paintings that at some point passed through his galleries, and acquiring the galleries' archives in 1968. (The Met gave the archives to the Getty Research Institute in 1994, though it has since acquired a microfilm copy.)

Patterson Jr. She was the dearly loved mother of six children: Anne Patterson Finn, Robert P. III, Margaret, Paul, Katherine, and Bevin C. Patterson who died as a child in 1961. Bevin grew up in Fairfield Connecticut, the fourth child of eight born to Madeleine and Paul Daly: Madeleine D. Potter, Paul, Michael, Daniel, T.F. Gilroy, Dermot Daly and Alison Gerard, who survives her. Since the age of four, when she taught herself to read, she was an avid reader and excelled at school, skipping several grade levels. She graduated from Barnard College; and, before marrying, worked as a secretary and as a model. Though very beautiful, her most striking qualities were her kindness and compassion. In addition to being a devoted mother and wife, Bevin volunteered to teach children reading in Harlem and religious education in the Bronx. She also did volunteer work for the Women's Division of the Legal Aid Society and the Central Park Conservancy. She served as secretary of the Board of the Cosmopolitan Club in New York City.

Fox was planning on Sunday to show new installments of those series with an interconnected story line about a hurricane on the Eastern Seaboard. These episodes were planned several months ago, before the recent storms that have killed nearly 300 people in the South. But on Friday, Fox said in a brief statement, ''In light of the recent storms that have affected the nation, Fox has decided to postpone the crossover episodes of 'Family Guy,' 'American Dad' and 'The Cleveland Show' that were originally scheduled to air this Sunday.'' A spokeswoman for the network said these episodes will instead be shown next season. This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print."

2011-04-30T00:00:00Z,"While this year's Tony Award nominees won't be announced until Tuesday, a Tony oversight panel announced an unusually long list of decisions on Friday about the eligibility of several Broadway actors, Edie Falco, Joel Grey, Jennifer Jason Leigh, and Joe Mantello among them. It's news that might tide over theater junkies through the weekend. The panel, known as the Tony Awards Administration Committee, considers requests from Broadway producers who want their actors and artists to be eligible for Tony nominations in specific categories. Without committee action, for instance, performers who are listed above the title of a show would be eligible for the lead acting categories, while those listed below the title would have a shot at featured (or supporting) categories. Producers can engage in gamesmanship here, requesting eligibility changes for their actors in hopes of receiving more Tony nominations. (Tony Awards can influence ticket sales and national touring prospects of some shows.)"
2011-04-30T00:00:00Z,"Andrew Morton, who has written biographies of Diana, Princess of Wales, Monica Lewinsky and Tom Cruise, has turned to a familiar subject for his next book: the newly wedded royal couple Prince William and the former Kate Middleton. St. Martin's Press said on Friday that it would publish ''William & Catherine: Their Story'' on May 17, promising that Mr. Morton will tell ''the full story'' of the couple, including their time at university together, the prince's proposal in Kenya and the wedding itself, with all its pomp and circumstance. ''I have drawn on 30 years of experience covering the royal family to bring perspective and insight into the life of a young man I have watched develop from a toddler and schoolboy into a soldier - just as I have tried to discover more about his bride,'' Mr. Morton said in a statement. The book is not an authorized biography, however, and Mr. Morton did not interview William or the Duchess of Cambridge, as she is now known.

2011-04-30T00:00:00Z,"For much of his career, Superman has fought for truth, justice and the American way. In the landmark Action Comics No. 900, which was released on Wednesday, Superman decides he has to stand for something bigger and he renounces his United States citizenship. The Man of Steel's declaration, ''I'm tired of having my actions construed as instruments of U.S. policy,'' follows accusations that he caused an international incident in Tehran. Superman flew to the country during a huge protest, where he stood silent for one day, to show his support for the demonstrators. The 24 hours pass with a mix of appreciation (flowers and flags) and fear (hurled Molotov cocktails). But the government of Iran sees Superman as an agent of the United States and feels his action is an act of war. ''Truth, justice and the American way - it's not enough anymore,'' Superman tells the president's national security adviser. ''The world's too small. Too connected.'' He then makes the decision to go before the United Nations and renounce his American citizenship."

And suddenly life is a little less normal. Lisa Cholodenko's take on the American family, which starts from the premise that gay marriage is an established social fact, ''is so canny in its insights and so agile in its negotiation of complex emotions that it deserves to stand on its own,'' A. O. Scott wrote in The New York Times. ''It is outrageously funny without ever exaggerating for comic effect, and heartbreaking with only minimal melodramatic embellishment.'' But ''its originality -- the thrilling, vertiginous sense of never having seen anything quite like it before -- also arises from the particular circumstances of the family at its heart,'' he added. Ms. Cholodenko and Stuart Blumberg, with whom she wrote the screenplay, ''have discovered in this very modern arrangement a way of refreshing the ancient and durable wellsprings of comedy.'' 7 P.M.

He enjoyed people and was the most giving person his family and friends ever knew. As a boy, he attended Camp Dudley and throughout his life he lived the Camp Dudley motto, ""The other fellow first."" When awarded Cornell's Frank H.T. Rhodes Award for Exemplary Alumni Service, Hunter Rawlings, then President of Cornell, stated, ""A man's success in life isn't what he gains, it is what he gives."" This described Bill's life. He and his precious wife Rosamond were married for 52 years before her passing in 1990. He was born to Charles Reeve and Mercy Moore Vanneman on April 6, 1909 in Albany, New York. He graduated from the Albany Academy, Cornell University, and Harvard Business School. He served in the Navy during WWII, completing his service as a Lieutenant Commander. After the war, he spent the remainder of his work life with Matthew Bender Company, a law book publisher in New York, retiring as senior vice president. He and Rosamond lived and raised their children, Bill and Reeve, in Old Greenwich Connecticut, where he served as Senior Deacon of the First Congregational Church. He is survived by his two sons, William Henry Moore Vanneman Jr. and his wife Irene and Reeve Doering Vanneman and his wife Jane; by two grandsons Matt Vanneman and James Vanneman and their mother Jill Jacovitz; three granddaughters Kara Klein and her husband Ken Klein, Michelle Vanneman and her husband Chad Yoder, and Julie Vanneman and her husband Scott Kiesling; and by the lights of his later life, his eight great-grandchildren ages 2-14, all of whom adored him dearly.

2011-05-01T00:00:00Z,"For centuries, Seville, Spain, has been known for its striking architecture -- particularly its Moorish Alcázar and huge Gothic cathedral. The Metropol Parasol, a large, multipurpose structure that made its debut late last month in the city, looks both backward and forward in its unusual design. The project was initiated in 2004 after Roman ruins were discovered in a parking lot. An ensuing competition for a surrounding structure was won by Jüergen Mayer H., an architect based in Berlin. Seven years and about 110 million euros (about $162 million) later, Seville has a structure, over 450 feet long and seven stories high, that incorporates those ruins into a museum on its lowest level. The upper levels house an indoor food market, plazas with panoramic views, and a restaurant. But most notable is the undulating, honeycombed roof of the structure, made from polyurethane-covered wood and held together by a new type of glue."

2011-05-01T00:00:00Z,"Pick up a book about a young New York artist these days, and you're likely to spot Brendan Dugan's name in the fine print. As the founder of the graphics firm and indie publishing imprint An Art Service, Dugan has become a go-to designer for galleries like Gagosian and Hauser & Wirth, or for virtually anyone in Dan Colen's crowd. Now he's slowly making his presence known with Karma (21 Downing Street; open Thursday-Sunday from noon to 7 p.m. or by appointment), a tiny shop in the front of his office where he sells his own catalog of gritty pop-minimalist art books and posters alongside books and objects that inspire him. Dugan started the publishing arm of his business in 2009 as an additional platform for the artists whose Web sites, books and ephemera he was already designing. ''Allan Kaprow, Ed Ruscha and a lot of the Fluxus artists were designing all these amazing objects to help support their projects,'' he says. ''I guess I think of us as trying to help continue that lineage.'' This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print."

2011-05-01T00:00:00Z,"It's the most intimate class divide in human civilization, or at least in such relatively civilized places as Manhattan and Park Slope, Brooklyn. On the one side, there is the professional couple bringing in six figures a year; on the other, the nanny or maid without whom the couple wouldn't be able to practice their professions. Conditions of employment are as variable as the individual employers are - from respectful and considerate all the way to criminally abusive. On average, a domestic worker is likely to get less than $15 an hour, no benefits and none of the credit or glory. To my knowledge anyway, there has never been a successful career woman - or man, for that matter - who's responded to being praised for ''doing it all'' by saying, ''Actually, Manuela (or Angelica or Harriet) does most of it.'' You don't have to be down on your knees scraping congealed creme fraiche off marble tiles to see that there's something not quite right about this picture. Ai-jen Poo was a recent Columbia University graduate in 1998 when she got incensed about the status of New York's domestic workers and started organizing them into something resembling a union. It's not that easy to organize domestic workers, even the ones who are fluent in English, because their workplaces are scattered among thousands of individual apartments and town houses and no one keeps a list of their names."

2011-05-01T00:00:00Z,"It sometimes feels as if no aspect of American midcentury modern design has been left unconsidered, unexhibited, unreissued. But there is undiscovered territory. You're sitting on it. ''Knoll Textiles, 1945-2010,'' at the Bard Graduate Center in Manhattan from May 18 to July 31, flips the story line on the brand's famous chairs (Womb, Tulip, Diamond, Platner) by focusing on the fabrics rather than the frames. ''One of the major goals of this project was to shift the attention,'' said Earl Martin, a curator of the exhibition. ''People might save a Saarinen Womb chair but have it recovered because we don't yet have a sensibility about the textiles being that important.'' Among the vintage chairs on display with their original upholstery will be a 1945 Ralph Rapson rocker with a woven webbing seat and back, and a 1965 Eero Saarinen side chair covered in still-brilliant red Cato fabric by Paul Maute. Some of the reasons for textiles' also-ran status are mundane: fabrics are ephemeral, faded by sunlight, dirtied by use. ''We needed the conservators at the Museum of Modern Art to rescue some of these pieces and preserve the upholstery,'' Martin explained. Because Knoll's program was frequently experimental, a few early fabrics that incorporated fiberglass or rayon disintegrated within the first years of production and had to be discontinued or reformulated. Moreover, much of the company's business was contract work, and office drones hardly paid attention to the provenance of their swivel chairs or curtains."

But at Sotheby's, Christie's and Phillips de Pury, the art for sale at the big auctions this season, beginning Tuesday, requires little thought. Even those without much knowledge of art history will recognize Andy Warhol's haunting self-portrait with his spiky fright wig or Jeff Koons's lovable sculpture of a Pink Panther being hugged by a buxom blonde or the classic pink-and-red abstract canvas that shrieks Mark Rothko. These instantly recognizable images spell ''wall power,'' a well-worn art-world phrase that describes an artwork that telegraphs its owner's wealth. Often these trophy purchases are flaunted in the entrance of a McMansion or over a living-room fireplace or in an office-building lobby. Sometimes, however, prized art will disappear into private collections where their superrich owners show them off to only their superrich friends."

Like virtually every other room, this one has devastating views of the Mediterranean Sea, oddly curvaceous white plaster walls and a surfeit of unpretentious, quirky design gestures. Consider a pair of shutters set in a rounded expanse - painted olive gray-green, a shade approved by the village's strict building code - that open to reveal a view of, no, not the orange grove that forms a part of the property, nor the ancient terraces laid out by the Moors a thousand years ago, but a wide-screen TV. But ask de Betak if the undulating surfaces - there's hardly a right angle in the place - are meant to evoke the spirit of Antoni Gaudi, and he laughs and concedes that the influence is more like Barbapapa, the shape-shifting cartoon character from the 1970s. ''I love '70s organic architecture,'' he says. ''I am very influenced by the time when I grew up.''"

2011-05-01T00:00:00Z,"Delta Airlines has begun a system that allows its passengers to track their bags after they've been checked in, its blog reported recently. The bag tracking system works in a similar fashion to that of a delivery company: users simply enter a last name and the baggage tracking number and then are told whether their luggage has been loaded on the aircraft, is in a claim area or is in a different location. Delta is the first major domestic carrier to offer such a service. The tracking system was touted on the blog along with other enhancements meant to minimize the hassle of baggage delays, including notification via text or e-mail if your bags do not make your flight, an online baggage claim form and a rebate for which you can apply online if your bag has been delayed for more than 12 hours."

As part of a dozen stops being renovated by MetroNapoli along the city's No. 1 and No. 6 lines, he joins the likes of Alessandro Mendini and Sol LeWitt, who used their art to decorate the depots. Mr. Rashid turned the station's entire 36,000 square feet into a signature piece, with hologram flooring, tiled epigrams, silver sculptures and shifting ''muta-blob'' walls. ''So much of the world is gray or beige,'' he said with a sigh. ''If this kind of passion and attention'' was lavished on New York's subways, he added, ''I would ride them again.'' SHONQUIS MORENO"

2011-05-01T00:00:00Z,"FISCHER--Thomas Ray, 1943-2011. Thomas grew up in the west end of Louisville, KY, attending Holy Cross Elementary School and Flaget High School where he first met the Xaverian Brothers. After high school Thomas joined the Brothers studying at The Catholic University of America in Washington, D.C., where he majored in English concentrating on Shakespeare. After graduating in 1967, Thomas went on to teach English, religion, and cinema at Xaverian High School in Brooklyn, NY where he monitored the yearbook and began developing lifelong friendships with students and faculty members. In the early days of his career, Brother Thomas was known as Brother Xavier, taking the name in honor of the Jesuit missionary who traveled to India and the Far East. He adopted the 70s spirit donning bell-bottomed pants, wearing his hair long, and even sporting a beard. During this time he studied at night to earn a master's degree in cinema from New York University. During his summers he studied at Wesleyan University in Middletown, CT, earning a master's degree in English. In the mid-70s Thomas withdrew from the brotherhood and left his beloved New York, relocating to Lynchburg, VA where he directed Campbell County's ongoing education program for teachers of social studies and English. Thomas earned a Ph.D. in education from the University of Virginia launching a career of educational leadership which took him to Chicago, IL, and Ankara and Istanbul, Turkey. While in Wheaton, IL he taught at West Chicago Community High School and later retiring from Lyons Township High School in La Grange, IL. Thomas traveled to Ankara, Turkey on a Fulbright Scholarship. After retiring he chaired the English Department of a Turkish/American school in Istanbul. Having overcome polio at an early age, Thomas was eager to stay fit through regular exercise and yoga. Being an avid swimmer, Thomas also enjoyed scuba diving which took him to destinations yet to be discovered. While in Chicago he joined the Smelts, a competitive swim team, and participated and won several medals in the International Gay Olympics Games. Thomas' passion for learning was matched only by his love for travel, developing and nurturing lasting friendships along the way. He visited and studied in dozens of countries during his career, bringing back memories and experiences he shared with his students in the classroom. Thomas' apartment was filled with those memories, treasures he had collected while exploring the world. In all his traveling and exploring this great world of ours, Thomas never met a stranger. Students and friends have described Thomas as gifted, intelligent and hip, a friend and mentor, having a zest for life with a constant quest for knowledge. He loved the arts from jazz to opera and was drawn to big city life for what it had to offer. Thomas is predeceased by his parents Firmin Casimir and Dorothy Louise of Louisville, KY and his brother Robert Joseph of Eagle Rock, CA. He is survived by his siblings, Judith Ann Ventrella of Punta Gorda, FL, Linda Marie Finn of Naples, FL, Anthony Edward of Alta Loma, CA, James Gregory of Zephyrhills, FL, Martin Christopher of Sanford, FL and Kenneth Eugene of Apopka, FL. A memorial service will be held at 11:00am on Saturday, May 21, 2011 at the home of James Markey, 950 West Berwyn Avenue, Unit 3, Chicago, IL 60640.

2011-05-01T00:00:00Z,"What New Yorker doesn't dream of a bigger apartment? You know - a place with more storage space, more walls for books and the elusive ''one more room.'' But there's a difference between a bigger apartment and a perfect apartment. Ronald Bentley and Salvatore LaRosa, who are partners in the New York design firm B Five Studio as well as in life, understand that difference, and their recently completed apartment on the Brooklyn waterfront offers numerous lessons in how to have both. The two are no strangers to the quest for perfection (or space): in addition to the houses and apartments that they've designed for their clients, they've designed homes for themselves, including a one-bedroom apartment on lower Fifth Avenue and a 3,400-square-foot weekend house in Bucks County, Penn. And when they decided that the apartment wasn't big enough and the 16-acre country property was too big to maintain, they searched for a place that offered both more space and a connection to the outside world."

He is excoriated on the right for debasing the currency, and blasted on the left for failing to stimulate more than he has. It has gotten so bad that last week Mr. Bernanke, who prefers to discuss monetary policy with erudite professors like himself, submitted to the indignity of a news conference. Among the uninvited was Representative Ron Paul, who is flirting with a presidential run, and who, if he took office in 2013, would like nothing more than to celebrate the Fed's centennial by ... abolishing it. And that got me to thinking: What if there were no Fed? Don't laugh; it has happened before. The United States had a primitive central bank, conceived by Alexander Hamilton, but President James Madison let its charter lapse in 1811. A second such bank became the target of President Andrew Jackson, who viewed it as a ''hydra'' and a ''curse'' upon the nation. Jackson sought to decertify the bank and, in 1836, succeeded. Never mind that the following year, the United States was plunged into a serious financial panic. The curse had been lifted, not to reappear for nearly a century."

The work he is showing nearly 50 years later at the William Griffin Gallery in Santa Monica, Calif., straddles both genres - illuminated light bulbs protrude from the canvases, and abstract figures dance across them. The installation includes eerie watercolors and a number of lamplike sculptures. Lynch's proclivity for ''shape and light'' drew him to another project, Silencio, a nightclub set to open this summer at 142 rue Montmartre in Paris, for which he designed the interiors and the furniture. ''I enjoy how architecture and design create mood,'' he says. The club was named for the spooky theater in ''Mulholland Drive,'' so no telling what that mood will be.

2011-05-01T00:00:00Z,"This issue is dedicated to the (wrongly) clichéd question of how one makes a house a home. We all know, of course, that the answer lies in love and friendship and commitments of a deep and complex character; but we also know that those precious bonds can be sorely tested by aggravating, inhospitable, bank-busting environs. To live beautifully requires a commitment to comfort and joy -- an amazing and rare quality. I hope you will find it here in small, instructive gestures: the folks from Blue Bottle's method for roasting coffee beans at home; a tutorial in how to transform supermarket flowers into an offhand, gorgeous bouquet; a seating plan for a Saturday supper; an idiosyncratic family reading list from the legendary George Lois."

Do not stand at my grave and weep, I am not there I do not sleep, I am a thousand winds that blow, I am the diamond glints on snow, I am the sunlight on ripened grain, I am the gentle autumn's rain, When you awaken in the morning's hush, I am the swift uplifting rush of quiet birds in circled flight, I am the soft stars that shine at night, Do not stand at my grave and cry, I am not there, I did not die."

2011-05-01T00:00:00Z,"A MEDIUM-SIZE seaport teetering on the edge of what we recognize as Italy, Trieste is a mysterious and puzzling place. Its iconic central square, the Piazza dell'Unità d'Italia, bounded on three sides by comically pompous 18th- and 19th-century buildings, most of them decorated like big, boxy wedding cakes, is wide open to the Adriatic, as though the ever-changing seascape were an entertainment staged for the city's benefit. This vast, glorious piazza promises all sorts of civic delights, but in fact it's one of the few immediately gratifying spots in Trieste. The rest takes time -- exactly what most of us are unwilling to give up. With a convoluted history of serial conquest, culminating in a century-long tug-of-war between Italy and Austria, a melting-pot population, a street plan that ranges from serenely rational to bewilderingly crooked and steep, and a forbidding limestone plateau crowding it down to the waterfront, Trieste is like a modernist novel -- complex, layered, ambiguous. It makes you dig for significance. But don't worry, the story has a happy ending: the patient visitor will go away well satisfied (and wonderfully well fed), rewarded by an experience unavailable to those looking for a quick and easy foreign fix."

Now in its third iteration, the site-specific exhibition pairs 10 Los Angeles artists with 9 area residences, inviting the artists to explore the notion of home. Some of the work, like the circular swimming pool that Piero Golia built in the yard of an updated Spanish-style gem or Jennifer West's experimental surf films, which will screen at sundown at a Carpinteria surf shack, makes direct references to life in Southern California. Other installations play with personal space: the sculptor Ry Rocklen's tiled floor piece speaks to the work of the mosaic artist who is hosting him, and Bettina Hubby (above) has created curtains - depicting her ''living'' inside a Montecito Tudor - that will hang outside the windows, ''providing privacy for the owners but exposing me,'' she says.

I've done it many times myself. Depending on whom you talk to, that might be a type of sour or it might be a type of fix, but it almost certainly is not a gimlet. A proper gimlet is made with lime cordial. And what most of the world knows as lime cordial is Rose's, that dusty, fluorescent yellow-green bottle in the drinks section of your supermarket. I am willing to bet that at some point in its very long history Mr. Lauchlin Rose's Cordial Mixer Lime Juice may have been a bracing product, redolent of the fruit that it promises. Sadly, its current incarnation is to limes as Spam is to steak. It tastes of the high-fructose corn syrup, stabilizers and various chemicals that give it its cesium-like shelf life, which is all fine for Cadbury, which has owned the brand since 1981, but is bitter gruel for someone trying to tap into the sublimity of a true gimlet. For that, as for many such rich rewards, you've got to make your own."

2011-05-02T08:46:43Z,"The thing that scared us most about Osama bin Laden, I think, was what seemed to be his -- and many of his acolytes' -- rational mega-murderousness. In American action thrillers, the bad guys sometimes used what appeared to be blind terrifying terrorism as a guise for merely felonious behavior. (The ""Die Hard"" franchise nearly always centered on that construction.) But here were engineers and others with advanced degrees whose obsession was an end to modernism and a return to primal law."

2011-05-02T07:25:13Z,"There was a nice piece by Asef Bayat in Foreign Affairs last week on ""The Post-Islamist Revolutions."" Bayat -- born and raised in Iran, educated in Britain, professor at Leiden then the University of Illinois -- makes the first convincing (rather than wishful) argument I've seen that the Arab Spring is likely to usher in relatively liberal, though religiously inflected, societies. The article makes a nice pairing with another recent Foreign Affairs piece by Michael Scott Doran, which takes Iran and Syria seriously as a kind of ""anticolonialist"" bloc single-mindedly focused on undermining the United States. It is perhaps a slightly paranoid or excited piece, but it is paranoid about something that the United States, as a noncolonial and indeed anticolonial power, habitually underestimates in its foreign policy, namely the enduring political power of anticolonial feeling in a post-colonial world."

Two, ""Studio 60"" was about comedy: specifically, late-night comedy and, presumably, ""Saturday Night Live."" (""Studio 60"" was the name of a fictional, live, late-night sketch-comedy show produced out of Los Angeles.) Third, in a weird coincidence, ""Studio 60"" premiered the same year, on the same network, as the similarly numerically titled ""30 Rock,"" which is also sort-of about ""Saturday Night Live"" and is written by the ex-""S.N.L."" head writer Tina Fey."

2011-05-02T00:00:00Z,"KOBLENTZ--Charles, 93, died on April 30. Born in Chicago, he married his college sweetheart, Evelyn Dunn, in 1939 and soon moved with her to Washington, DC. There, his career advanced quickly as he conducted personnel management studies for various federal government agencies. During World War II, he served his country in the Office of Statistical Control at the Pentagon with the rank of Chief Warrant Officer, USAAF. Post-War, he returned to the federal government, where he planned and conducted a reorganization of the FCC. His challenging and fulfilling government career was cut short, however, when he was investigated in the late 1940's by the House Un-American Activities Committee on grounds of ""guilt by association."" At the ensuing hearing, he was exonerated of all charges. In 1950, Charles joined a prominent management consulting firm but was dismissed when the firm learned he had once been investigated by HUAC. Throughout much of the 1950's and 1960's, Charles, determined to provide for his family, which by then included four young children, worked at jobs dictated not by choice but by the constraints imposed by blacklisting. Rising above the trauma inflicted by the McCarthy years, in 1966 he joined American Trading and Production Company, where he rose to Executive Vice President for the Industrial Group and served on the Board of Directors. After retiring from ATAPCO in 1993 at age 75, he moved to Longboat Key, Florida, where he enjoyed his life-long enthusiasm for long walks that began as a boy in Chicago. He continued to maintain a home in Baltimore, Maryland, and later in White Plains, New York. In addition to foreign travels with Evelyn, he took lively trips in his 9th decade and the beginning of his 10th with sons Joel and Gerald. He wore them out walking over the bridges of Venice, up and down the hills of Montmartre and through the temples at Ramses II. A keen intellect with a strong interest in the social, economic, and political forces that shape history, Charles read widely and wrote a chronicle that set the events of his own life within the context of the times in which he lived. The saddest experience of his life was the loss of his son Paul in 1982. The people who knew Charles, whether for decades or in the brief interactions of day-to-day encounters, recognized a charismatic person of evident goodwill towards them in how he treated them, listened, and spoke. The memory of Charles, particularly his strength of character, intelligence, moral integrity, and devotion, will be cherished by friends, relatives, and former colleagues, as well as by those in his immediate family, whom he loved so much: Evelyn, his devoted wife of 71 years; children Joel, Suzanne Goodman (Jordan), and Gerald; grandsons Gregory Koblentz (Linda Fu) and Jason Goodman; and great-grandsons Kai and Evan Koblentz. Funeral services will be held at noon on May 3, Waterbury & Kelly Funeral Home, 1300 Pleasantville Road, Briarcliff Manor, NY. In lieu of flowers, donations may be sent to MAZON: A Jewish Response to Hunger, Charles' most favored charity."

2011-05-03T11:30:34Z,"Our cover story on Sunday was about the American soldiers accused of murdering Afghan civilians. Some reports have depicted them as a rogue unit, but our story goes deeper into the psyche of the American soldier and questions whether the killings are symptoms of a much larger issue. Being a weekly, time was a factor, so we executed some staff-produced, alternate versions of the magazine's cover, two days before it had to ship. We started with a graphic approach, experimenting with every font in our arsenal. We did more than can be featured in this blog post, but the following is a curated depiction of our process for developing a cover."

Knott will journey anywhere in New York, New Jersey, Connecticut and Pennsylvania where there's a dedicated electrical outlet and ""four clear feet of space"" for her folding table and portable Pasquini espresso machine. Along with filter coffee and espresso drinks - including a fantastic decaf - Knott offers loose-leaf black and herbal teas, hot chocolate (made with dairy, soy or coconut milk) and Italian sodas, all organic and fair-trade. She works with a local roaster to create custom blends and has them specially roasted for each event she caters. Since founding her business three and a half years ago, Knott has pulled shots and poured cups everywhere from suburban pool parties to the set of a slasher film on Governors Island. Her dedication to coffee - she wrote her thesis on it - is such that she even checks the water quality of an area before heading out. ""I actually prefer to bring my own,"" she says.

2011-05-03T09:00:38Z,"I’ve periodically recommended that high school students take a “gap year” after graduation, by deferring college entrance for one year. Most colleges encourage students to take a gap year, partly because students then arrive a little more mature, a little more ready to study, a little more worldly. It’s becoming a bit more common, and Princeton now pays for some kids to travel during their gap year, but most people are still wary of the idea. In fact, almost every kid I’ve talked to who has taken a gap year raves about the idea, so I thought I’d commission a guest column from my eldest son, Gregory, who is currently taking a gap year in China. He spent most of the year studying Chinese at Tsinghua University and then at a language school in Dalian, and soon he’s going to finish up the year studying Spanish in Peru. On the side, he worked and volunteered. Here’s his take:"

2011-05-03T00:00:00Z,"Since 9/11, there has been an outpouring of books about Osama bin Laden, Al Qaeda, the Sept. 11 attacks and the war in Afghanistan. Below is an annotated list of some of the more useful ones.Some of these books are primarily concerned with giving the reader a bildungsroman-like account of Bin Laden's transformation into a charismatic leader from a callow young man who ''couldn't lead eight ducks across the street,'' as Prince Bandar, the former Saudi ambassador in Washington, once said. They underscore the unresolved Oedipal problems (not unlike those of George W. Bush) that he had with his powerful and wealthy father, while exploring the role that older mentors played in his growing radicalization. ''The Bin Ladens,'' by Steve Coll, also adds new details to our understanding of how the young Bin Laden evolved from a loyal family adjutant into an angry black sheep lashing out at some of the very connections his father and brothers had cultivated in their business dealings for years."

The deal is largely a bet on steel: the combined company would be the second-biggest producer of metallurgical coal in the United States at a time when prices for such steel-making coal are rising thanks to demand from China and India. The biggest producer of steel-making coal is Alpha Natural Resources, which outbid Arch Coal earlier this year to acquire Massey Energy for $7.1 billion in cash and stock."

Researchers lately have learned that serotonin plays an impressive number of critical roles throughout the body, both below the neck and above it, and from the earliest days of prenatal pre-sentience. One team has found that serotonin starts seeping into the embryonic forebrain during the first trimester of pregnancy, helping to shape the basic neural circuitry that later in life will be applied to learning, emoting and consulting a psychiatrist."

2011-05-03T00:00:00Z,"There exists a large and soothing body of scientific literature suggesting that regular exercise can improve someone's mood and fight anxiety. And then there is this experiment from Germany, in which researchers placed running wheels in the cages of a group of laboratory mice and let them exercise at will. Mice generally love to run, and these rodents spent almost every waking hour on their wheels, skittering through more miles than most animals are allowed to complete during exercise studies, averaging about seven miles per mouse per day. The scientists, from the Central Institute of Mental Health Mannheim, then placed these avid runners in unfamiliar situations. What they found was surprising, in part because it contradicted earlier experiments by other researchers. The mice froze or quickly fled to dark corners, behaviors considered by some researchers to signify anxiety. It was as if the marathon runners in this experiment had become more anxious and neurotic than the nonrunners, presumably because of the volume of their running."

Here, the 43-year-old French director discusses the crazy love between the two men and the filmmaking techniques he chose to tell the story."

And though my pronounced personal favorite is the British import ''Jerusalem,'' Jez Butterworth's portrait of a mythic man in a myth-starved land, I wouldn't cry or even gnash my teeth if the prize went to David Lindsay-Abaire's ''Good People'' or Stephen Adly Guirgis's ''The ------------------------ With the Hat.''"

Kronos will receive the Avery Fisher Prize, awarded in New York to individuals or chamber ensembles for outstanding achievement and excellence in music, as well as the Polar Music Prize, awarded in Stockholm (not on the quartet's current itinerary), also intended to recognize exceptional achievement in music. This is the first time any individual or ensemble has won both awards, even apart from having done so in the same year. The Fisher award, which carries a cash grant of $75,000, will be presented after the tour, on June 8 at Lincoln Center. The Polar award, with a cash grant of about $166,000, will be given on Aug. 30, when a similar award will be given to the singer and songwriter Patti Smith. To make the ceremony really interesting, the Swedes should stipulate that the winners have to perform together. These particular artists would probably enjoy it."

Nothing exemplified the art boom of the go-go '80s and the cross-breeding of uptown and downtown like Area. Located on a quiet Hudson Street factory block, when TriBeCa was an out-of-the way ghost town, Area was equal parts conceptual installation, fun house and disco. Every six weeks or so, the outlandish theme would change - and we're not talking about using balloons instead of streamers. The indoor pool would morph from, say, ""Sports"" to ""Bikers,"" featuring actual bikers and beyond.

The best thing about prize money is that it provides financing without diluting your ownership in the company; the challenge of relying on prize money is that it is relatively limited -- $5,000 to $100,000, generally, and you can't enter the same contest more than once, especially if you do well the first time."

This monthlong tribute begins with ''Bathing Beauty'' (1944, above), starring Ms. Williams in her first leading role for MGM as an aquatic instructor at a girls' school who is wooed by a songwriting pupil (Red Skelton). In ''Thrill of a Romance'' (1945), at 10, she plays a newlywed swimmer who inconveniently falls in love with an Army Air Corps hero (Van Johnson). Ms. Williams and Johnson team up with Lucille Ball in ''Easy to Wed'' (1946), at midnight, about a tough newspaper editor who hires a gigolo to compromise a woman suing his paper for libel. In ''Fiesta'' (1947), at 2 a.m., Ms. Williams trades a swimsuit for trousers as a Mexican beauty who replaces her toreador twin brother (Ricardo Montalban) in the bull ring. And in ''This Time for Keeps'' (1947), at 4, she portrays the object of desire of the son (Johnny Johnston) of an opera star (Lauritz Melchior). 6 P.M.

Can their summer lovin' survive senior year? At 8:30 Mr. Travolta dons a dress to play Edna Turnblad in ''Hairspray'' (2007), another Broadway adaptation, based on John Waters's 1988 movie.

2011-05-05T00:00:00Z,"Last week, we published a case study that explored whether Big D Custom Screen Printing could become profitable by specializing in small T-shirt orders. After a year in business, the company had sales of $325,000 on which it suffered a nominal loss. Big D's co-founder, Darren Robbins, and his partner disagreed as to the best way to turn things around. His partner wanted to focus on large corporate accounts. Mr. Robbins believed Big D could thrive by targeting customers with small orders - as small as one T-shirt. The partners split (amicably) over the issue. The April 2008 decision to take smaller orders, Mr. Robbins said, paid off almost immediately: ''My phone started ringing off the hook.'' In 2009, Big D's sales were $675,000, he said, and they hit $900,000 the following year. He also said the company, which has 12 employees in Austin, Tex., is now profitable. And about a year ago, it opened two-employee branches in Los Angeles, Chicago, and southwest Michigan. More recently, Big D expanded to Las Vegas as well. Meanwhile, Mr. Robbins said the economy forced many of his competitors to go out of business -- and to sell their equipment at a loss on Craigslist."

Now, with a new crop of modified styles, the trend is moving full speed ahead. Oversize frames from Nicole Richie's House of Harlow; two-tone frames with sharper angles from Karen Walker; and an extra-pointy design, fittingly called Monroe, from Elizabeth and James are all more chic than quirky.

2011-05-05T00:00:00Z,"The Small Business Administration's special stimulus-funded loan program, known as America's Recovery Capital, may be gone, but the controversy surrounding it lingers. In March, the agency's independent Inspector General released a report estimating that of the 4,559 A.R.C. loans made through January 2010, nearly half ''were not originated and closed in compliance with S.B.A.'s policies and procedures, resulting in approximately $66.5 million in inappropriate loan approvals.'' If those loans default, the report warns, the banks that made them should not expect to be fully repaid by the S.B.A. The A.R.C. loan program was conceived as a lifeline for sound businesses navigating the ragged shoals of recession. Companies could borrow up to $35,000 to retire existing debt, defer payments on the new loan for a year, and then take five more years to repay the obligation - with no interest or fees charged to the borrower. (The government would pay those.) The S.B.A. estimated that it had enough money to fund about 10,000 loans, and some observers predicted the program would be fully subscribed within a few months."

Now, thanks to $8.2 million in grants from the Evolution Education Trust, the Andrew W. Mellon Foundation, the Alfred P. Sloan Foundation, and the Isaac Newton Trust, the entire collection will be published in full by 2022. Texts of some 6,000 letters and information on 9,000 more are already available here. The Darwin Correspondence Project, which is jointly administered by the Cambridge University Library and the American Council of Learned Societies, includes letters from Darwin's school days, his voyage on the H.M.S. Beagle and the controversies that followed the 1859 publication of ''On the Origin of Species.'' Dr. Jim Secord, the project director, said in a statement that ''Unlike his published works, Darwin's letters are vitally important in showing how science is done, with the constant gathering of new data, and the testing and questioning of theories and ideas.'' The letters between Darwin and his 2,000 or so correspondents are scattered among 200 institutions and private collections. Cambridge houses the largest haul of Darwin's manuscripts, his library of books and journals, and around 9,000 of the letters. In 2009 the Darwin project opened a satellite branch at Harvard."

Last month, three Rwandan owners, graduates of the three-year BPeace program, visited the United States during a trip that paired them with American businesses in their industries. The participants included Languida Nyirababeruka, who founded Pompe Funebre Twifatanye, a funeral home, after the 1994 genocide. Ms. Nyirababeruka, a former teacher who lost her job for political reasons, ran a tailoring business before 1994. The genocide claimed her husband and several family members, as well as her home and business. When it was over, she had to locate her three children, now in their 20s. ''After the genocide, I started from scratch,'' she said, speaking through an interpreter. A United Nations contact helped Ms. Nyirababeruka get a job as a cook, and she began to rebuild her life in Kigali."

Kay, supported by a host of others in the public scrum, including Bishop William Manning of the Episcopal Church, argued that Russell, who advocated sex before marriage and other heretical lifestyle choices, posed a threat to the virtue of her daughter — even though the impressionable youth was not actually a student at the college. A judge ruled in Kay’s favor. Russell, who was not allowed to speak in his own defense, was denied his appointment at the college, which was, and is, part of the publicly financed City University of New York system. Today, the now-notorious incident is chronicled in an exhibition on City College’s Web site, called “The Struggle for Free Speech at CCNY, 1931-1942,” as is a recounting of the subsequent firings, spurred by the McCarthy era Rapp-Coudert Committee, of faculty members accused of being Communist Party members."

What links these places is not just fashion, but the design process itself and how the ideas of designers evolve over time. That evolution is one of the pleasures of Andrew Bolton's selections for the McQueen show, especially in the tailoring choices. It was inspiring to see how his cutting methods changed over his career, yet how certain assumptions remained fixed. One of the most rewarding and maddening of these assumptions is that design is a learning process. And McQueen always wanted to learn."

Now there is Candelaria, Paris's first real taqueria, which recently opened in the Marais. The galley-size kitchen, helmed by the Mexican chef Luis Rendon, is buffered by a five-seat counter and a communal table. The seasonal menu, listed on a jagged blackboard, currently includes dishes like rajas con queso (tacos with sautéed green peppers, onions and melted cheese), totopos (chips) with zesty guacamole and longaniza (spicy pork) or pollo pibil (stewed chicken) tostados dressed with shredded red cabbage. The crisp tortillas are made in-house with meseca imported from Spain. Spicy sauces are on hand - and thankfully so are Mexican beers, bubbly fluorescent Jarritos sodas and hibiscus juice. There's no wine or coffee - positively heresy in Paris - but here ""nothing has been compromised for a French palate,"" insists Carina Soto Velasquez, who founded the restaurant with Adam Tsou and Joshua Fontaine. And about those margaritas? Hidden behind a mural-covered door in the back is a cocktail bar whose alcoholic arsenal includes well-aged tequilas, organic mezcal, rare rums and a curated drink selection with contributions from international bartender aficionados. (One is from the provenance of the East Village's Death & Co.) Assorted young artists helped supply the décor, including Adrian Rubi-Dentzel, who repurposed the space's original floor into the bar, and Confetti System, whose shimmering pendant adds a nice flourish."

For instance: its ''Glee Live! In Concert!'' series will be filmed this summer for a 3-D movie that will feature 14 members of the television series and utilize whatever remaining exclamation points Fox possesses. On Wednesday, Twentieth Century Fox's film and television divisions said that the ''Glee Live! 3D!'' movie will be released in theaters on Aug. 12 and run for two weeks. The film, directed by Kevin Tancharoen (director of the 2009 remake of ''Fame,'' and the online series ''Mortal Kombat: Legacy'') will feature ''Glee'' stars like Lea Michele, Chris Colfer, Heather Morris and Darren Criss performing numbers like ''I'm a Slave 4 U,'' ''Raise Your Glass'' and ''Teenage Dream.''

The result was an outpouring of fresh copy that was published online-only and then superseded eventually by new stories on Monday, some of which ultimately fed a 10-page special print section titled ""The Death of Bin Laden"" that was delivered Tuesday."

He was born in New York City, graduated from City College and Columbia Medical School and became a medical researcher. He recalled barely surviving a bout of Rat Bite fever during those years. He served a stint as a Medical Doctor in the army. During that time he met and married his life-long partner, Leila Mitchell. After the Army he joined the Pack Medical Group as a Diagnostician. He retired from active medical practice in the 1970's but in later years worked for a time for the New York State Department of Health as an investigator. Throughout these years he engaged in what he might have considered his ""real"" career as a naturalist and botanist. His knowledge was deep and his excitement for the natural world never waned. He was closely involved with the New York Botanical Gardens, serving as a docent, giving tours and sharing his love of the plant world. A wonderful profile of Sam by Caroline Dworin appeared in The New York Times on August 15, 2008. It can be found here: http://www.nytimes.com/2008/08/17/nyregion/thecity/17walk.html.

Archar- charch was sent off at odds of 9-1 and trailed the field throughout the race. When Court asked the late runner for his kick, it was not there. He passed a cou- ple of tiring horses down the stretch to finish 15th. Court, 50, was making his Derby debut aboard a horse trained by another Derby rookie, his father-in-law, Jinks Fires. He pulled Archarcharch up immediately.''He had never felt like that under- neath me, so I had the vet take him back as a precaution,'' Court said.Comma on the Top, the last-place fin- isher, chipped an ankle, according to his trainer, Peter Miller. ''He's got to go to the sidelines for at least 60 days,'' Miller said. ''This isn't the end of the world.''

2011-05-08T00:00:00Z,"BALK--Phyllis, former resident of Manhattan, died peacefully at age 81 on May 4, 2011. She was born Phyllis Lorraine Munter in Moline, IL on December 27, 1929 to Fritz and Alma (Eldean) Munter, both of Swedish heritage. Mrs. Balk graduated from Moline High School in 1948 and received her RN from Presbyterian-St. Luke's School of Nursing in Chicago in 1951. Upon graduation she served as an occupational health nurse for Deere & Company in Moline. After marriage to journalist Alfred Balk on June 7, 1952, she returned to Chicago, where she served as clinic head nurse and emergency room head nurse at Presbyterian-St. Luke's. During their 58-year marriage, the couple lived in Chicago, IL, Evanston, IL, New York, NY, Katonah, NY, Syracuse, NY, and Huntley, IL. Mrs. Balk was known in all these communities for her volunteer work and quiet activism, as well as her excellent cooking and extraordinary kindness. In New York City she served as PTA President of Hunter College High School during a critical time in the school's life, when it was threatened with closure due to lack of public funds. She led the high school community in a successful march on City Hall which was highlighted by Geraldo Rivera on local television news. She was also active in Girl Scouts, helping foreign immigrants settle in the U.S. and a beloved member of Park Avenue Methodist Church. In 1975, she joined Manufacturer's Hanover bank (now part of Chase) as an occupational health nurse, retiring in 1991, when her husband joined the faculty of Syracuse University's Newhouse School. She resumed long-deferred study towards a Bachelor's Degree, and in 1997, at age 67, became the oldest alumna in nursing of the State University of New York's Upstate Medical University. The school used a photo of Mrs. Balk in cap and gown with her young granddaughter on the cover of its brochures for several years. She and her husband moved to Huntley, IL in 1999 and visited New York City several times a year to visit friends and see Broadway plays. The couple had a happy partnership until his death on Thanksgiving Day in 2010. Mrs. Balk served as an important support throughout her husband's distinguished career, as indicated in Balk's scholarly papers in the collections of the Newberry Library in Chicago and Syracuse University. She is survived by two daughters, Laraine Balk Hope of Rockville, MD and Diane Balk Palguta of Indianapolis, IN, two grandchildren, Anna and Andrew Palguta, and first cousins Herb, Roger, and Judy Eldean of Macatawa, MI.

Kevin was born in New York City on August 23, 1954. A brilliant businessman and foresighted entrepreneur, he had a knack for creating something from nothing, a relentless drive for success and unbeatable instincts. Most recently, he founded PlasmaNet, Inc. in 1999 and its FreeLotto website, capitalizing on the promise of internet entertainment early in its heyday. Charity was his passion. He was guided by the concept of noblesse oblige the obligation to make the best of an individual's gifts and skills in order to better the world we live in. With each success in business, he was determined to contribute to the greater good. He was a notable philanthropist who supported many charities over his lifetime. He enjoyed learning about other cultures and had a particular soft spot for immigrants seeking the American Dream. He had a charisma that made him the life of any party and a natural leader. Kevin was at his best when he was cooking and entertaining for others, finding the greatest joy in feeding people and putting smiles on their faces. He was a gifted storyteller and teacher, and had a seemingly endless supply of funny jokes, which he loved to share with his friends and family. He read all three New York papers every day, and he could never seem to satisfy his thirst for knowledge. He is survived by his wife Anne; his four children, Shannon, Sean, Caitlin, and Lauren; his adopted son, Kevin Wong; his son-in-law, Edward Eppright; his dearly loved and only grandson, Eamon Eppright; his siblings, Michael, Patricia, and Nancy; and his uncle, Howard Aronin. He also leaves behind his Newfoundland, Duke, whom Kevin considered his sixth child. He will be deeply missed by his family, friends and colleagues, but he would rather his life be celebrated.

What links these places is not just fashion, but the design process itself and how the ideas of designers evolve over time. That evolution is one of the pleasures of Andrew Bolton's selections for the McQueen show, especially in the tailoring choices. It was inspiring to see how his cutting methods changed over his career, yet how certain assumptions remained fixed. One of the most rewarding and maddening of these assumptions is that design is a learning process. And Mr. McQueen always wanted to learn."

At the back, in a corner, sat a tall, straggly-bearded man in his early 30s, silent, taut-faced, and plainly, by his body language, deeply upset by a reporter's intrusion. His name, I learned later from an officer of Pakistan's military intelligence agency, the Directorate of Inter-Services Intelligence, was Osama bin Laden.

2011-05-08T00:00:00Z,"GORELICK--Leonard, D.D.S.,died on May 5, after a long illness. He had combined a career in dentistry with a passion for science and art to make significant contributions in the study of technologies used to make ancient seals and other objects. An article in the New York Times, in 1981, described Dr. Gorelick's work as ""shedding light on how ancient man transformed stones into works of art and instruments of commerce."" Born in 1922, he emigrated to the United States from Ukraine with his family as a very young child, settling in Brooklyn, New York. He attended Tilden High School and graduated from Brooklyn College in 1942. Then, he served in the Navy in both World War II and the Korean War. Dr. Gorelick received his D.D.S. and Postgraduate Certificate in Orthodontics from New York University College of Dentistry. In 1944, Len Gorelick married Shirley Fishman. They had two children, Jamie Gorelick, a Washington, D.C. lawyer and a former Deputy Attorney General of the United States, and Steven Gorelick, the Cyrus F. Tolman Professor at Stanford University. Shirley Gorelick was an artist a painter, sculptor and teacher and much of their life together involved the making and appreciation of art. Dr. Gorelick combined his interest in the scientific aspects of orthodonture especially, electron microscopy - with his love for and interest in ancient cylinder seals, in which he became quite expert. He eventually built one of the world's finest collections of seals, celebrated in a book called ""The Mark of Ancient Man: Ancient Near Eastern Stamp Seals and Cylinder Seals: The Gorelick Collection"", which accompanied a show of that name at The Brooklyn Museum. These seals are now part of the collection of the Royal Ontario Museum. He was often consulted by scholars and served on the Visiting Committee of the Metropolitan Museum of Art's Ancient Near East Department. He co-authored ""Ancient Seals and the Bible"" as well as over forty-five scholarly papers on techniques that can be used to date and explain ancient seals and other artifacts. They are collected in the Special Collections and University Archives at Stony Brook. Dr. Gorelick also edited the Journal of the Queens County Dental Society and was President of the Society. He was the long-time editor of the Forum of the Long Island Jewish Hillside Medical Center, with which he was affiliated, and became Associate Professor in the Department of Children's Dentistry (Orthodontics) at Stony Brook School of Dental Medicine. Dr. Gorelick's wife, Shirley, died in 2000. He leaves his sister, Beatrice, her husband Leonard, and their children Anne, Richard and Scott. He was a loving father and father-in-law of Jamie Gorelick, Dr. Richard Waldhorn, Steven Gorelick and Stephanie Knott, and he was the proud and affectionate grandfather of artist Alyssa Gorelick (and her husband, Max Warsh) and Daniel and Dana Waldhorn, all of whom brought him great joy. In lieu of flowers, contributions may be made to the Shirley Gorelick Fund at the National Museum for Women in the Arts."

2011-05-09T00:00:00Z,"GORELICK--Leonard, D.D.S.,died on May 5, after a long illness. He had combined a career in dentistry with a passion for science and art to make significant contributions in the study of technologies used to make ancient seals and other objects. An article in the New York Times, in 1981, described Dr. Gorelick's work as ""shedding light on how ancient man transformed stones into works of art and instruments of commerce."" Born in 1922, he emigrated to the United States from Ukraine with his family as a very young child, settling in Brooklyn, New York. He attended Tilden High School and graduated from Brooklyn College in 1942. Then, he served in the Navy in both World War II and the Korean War. Dr. Gorelick received his D.D.S. and Postgraduate Certificate in Orthodontics from New York University College of Dentistry. In 1944, Len Gorelick married Shirley Fishman. They had two children, Jamie Gorelick, a Washington, D.C. lawyer and a former Deputy Attorney General of the United States, and Steven Gorelick, the Cyrus F. Tolman Professor at Stanford University. Shirley Gorelick was an artist a painter, sculptor and teacher and much of their life together involved the making and appreciation of art. Dr. Gorelick combined his interest in the scientific aspects of orthodonture especially, electron microscopy - with his love for and interest in ancient cylinder seals, in which he became quite expert. He eventually built one of the world's finest collections of seals, celebrated in a book called ""The Mark of Ancient Man: Ancient Near Eastern Stamp Seals and Cylinder Seals: The Gorelick Collection"", which accompanied a show of that name at The Brooklyn Museum. These seals are now part of the collection of the Royal Ontario Museum. He was often consulted by scholars and served on the Visiting Committee of the Metropolitan Museum of Art's Ancient Near East Department. He co-authored ""Ancient Seals and the Bible"" as well as over forty-five scholarly papers on techniques that can be used to date and explain ancient seals and other artifacts. They are collected in the Special Collections and University Archives at Stony Brook. Dr. Gorelick also edited the Journal of the Queens County Dental Society and was President of the Society. He was the long-time editor of the Forum of the Long Island Jewish Hillside Medical Center, with which he was affiliated, and became Associate Professor in the Department of Children's Dentistry (Orthodontics) at Stony Brook School of Dental Medicine. Dr. Gorelick's wife, Shirley, died in 2000. He leaves his sister, Beatrice, her husband Leonard, and their children Anne, Richard and Scott. He was a loving father and father-in-law of Jamie Gorelick, Dr. Richard Waldhorn, Steven Gorelick and Stephanie Knott, and he was the proud and affectionate grandfather of artist Alyssa Gorelick (and her husband, Max Warsh) and Daniel and Dana Waldhorn, all of whom brought him great joy.

The farm harvests without chemicals, feeds its employees (“Raw oysters, fried oysters, oyster risotto, a lot of oysters!” Péan says) and turns the shells into beads. Péan’s line uses Kamoka’s keshi pearls in hues of blue, aubergine and gold for pieces like a ring set with delicate pavé-diamond tendrils (conflict-free, of course), which Péan says was inspired by Ahe’s “pollution-free midnight sky reflecting against the waves and the light.”"

By my quick count, only six players make more than the $1.2 million Bobby Bonilla will be getting from the Mets every year for the next 25 years (he retired from baseball in 2001, in case you’re wondering why you haven’t heard that name in a while).

In a winking style more reminiscent of ""The Muppet Show"" than ""Sesame Street,"" Kermit is introduced to ""Pirates"" stars like Geoffrey Rush, Penélope Cruz and Johnny Depp (who appears baffled by the concept of a talking frog), mingles with stray guests like Steven Tyler and Bruno Tonioli, and steals kisses from Vanessa Hudgens and Kirstie Alley.

For twenty years, Curt was the Director of AHRC's Department of Adult Day Services, but his role at AHRC was far greater. Curt was a leader and talented administrator: a creative and intelligent man who possessed vision and the ability to turn dreams into reality. He had a wonderful sense of humor, the ability to see through the insincere, and the political savvy to know what to say and when. Curt was a passionate advocate for the individuals served by AHRC. His passion was a manifestation of his humanity. We extend our heartfelt condolences to his children, Danny, Meagan and Emma, his wife Judy, his brothers Todd and Scott and his sister Mary Ann. Curt was with us for too short a time, but he left his mark and will be remembered by everyone whose life he touched. A wake will be held at the William Dangler Funeral Home in Summit, New Jersey on Tuesday, May 10th from 3-6pm followed by a service.

The Alaskan Palin fought corruption within her own party, attacked the nexus of government and big business, avoided polarizing feuds and cut successful bipartisan deals; in the process, Green notes, “she succeeded to a remarkable extent in settling, at least for a time, what had seemed insoluble problems, in the process putting Alaska on a trajectory to financial well-being.” This was the Palin that I liked from afar, before John McCain elevated her to national prominence: The charismatic pro-life working mom who was also a good-government reformer capable of thinking outside the ideological box. (Imagine Mitch Daniels crossed with Michelle Bachmann — in a good way.) And it’s a Palin who was swallowed up, almost immediately, by the national culture war, which made her both a right-wing icon and a left-wing hate figure almost instantaneously, and effectively erased her more interesting and complicated past."

But when we apply critical judgment to particular wines, a clearer picture emerges. We don't love all Napa cabs or all Barolos. In fact, we don't like quite a few of them.

2011-05-11T00:00:00Z,"When Joyce Carol Oates's memoir, ''A Widow's Story,'' came out in February, some reviewers took her to task for not mentioning that 13 months after the death of her husband, Raymond Smith, in February 2008, she remarried. Writing in The New York Review of Books, Julian Barnes said ''some readers will feel they have a good case for breach of narrative promise.'' In a letter in the current issue of The New York Review Ms. Oates defended her choice , writing that the book was meant to be about the immediate experience of widowhood, not her subsequent life. But she also wrote that ''in retrospect I can see that I should have added something like an appendix, to bring my personal history up to date,'' and said that she hopes to add such an appendix to later editions. This was news to her editor, Daniel Halpern, the president and publisher of Ecco. ''I completely disagree, and I thought I had talked her out of that,'' he said. ''She wrote a book about what it's like to be in limbo - about what it was like to lose the man she had been married to all her life. Why include the next husband? That's not what the book is about. What is she supposed to say - that she finally met someone and got married? That certainly breaks the spell of the book, which is written differently and perceived differently from anything she's ever done before.''"

(Sundance) THE HISTORY BOYS (2006) Two teachers -- Hector (Richard Griffiths), a middle-aged, poetry-spouting, married homosexual who cares deeply about how knowledge is applied to life, and Irwin (Stephen Campbell Moore, above right with Mr. Griffiths), a young Thatcher-era go-getter -- square off over the question of how to interpret history in what Stephen Holden, writing in The New York Times, called a ''ferociously engaging'' screen adaptation of Alan Bennett's Tony Award-winning play. ''The acting is wonderful,'' Mr. Holden said of this streamlined interpretation of the critically acclaimed National Theater production in London, set in a boys' school in northern England in 1983, as eight teenagers prepare to apply to Oxford and Cambridge.''Mr. Moore's avid Irwin and Mr. Griffiths's shambling Hector are matched by the extraordinary Frances de la Tour as Dorothy Lintott, the droopy, horse-faced history teacher with a baritone voice who is the wisest and most balanced member of an academic triumvirate. Dorothy belatedly has her say when she observes with an amused exasperation: 'History is a commentary on the various and continuing incapabilities of men. History is women following behind with the bucket.' '' Still, ''For all its delights, 'The History Boys' is not a world-changing work of art,'' Mr. Holden wrote. ''It is exactly what Irwin calls history: entertainment, a scintillating contrivance that is only as good as its epigrams. Below the surface lies a gooey custard filling.'' 4 P.M. (ABC); 7 P.M.

As lopsided as that 20 percent figure may still be, some of the buzzed-about films around the Croissette this year are directed by women, including Lynne Ramsay’s “We Need to Talk About Kevin” and Julia Leigh’s “Sleeping Beauty.” An entry far out of the competition, “Kung Fu Panda 2,” the animated sequel starring Angelina Jolie, Jack Black and Dustin Hoffman, was directed by Jennifer Yuh, who was a story artist on the first film; at a press conference on Thursday, a journalist asked Ms. Jolie if her character was more developed because of Ms. Yuh’s involvement. (Ms. Jolie, who plays a tigress, hedged an answer. “I do feel if we had a male director, I would have had a bigger part,” Mr. Hoffman – red panda – said jokingly.) Other films have notable female performances, like “The Beloved,” in which Catherine Deneuve stars, and sings, with her daughter, Chiara Mastroianni.

Krehbiel and crew restored ornate plasterwork, bought back some of the previous owner’s paintings, rebuilt the conservatory (which had to be disassembled and shipped to England for repairs) and even uncovered a Roman sarcophagus bathtub, now installed in one of the guest rooms.

Illamasqua, a London cosmetics brand led by the avant-garde makeup artist Alex Box; the legendary punk leader of the Damned, Dave Vanian; and the artist Anja Huwe encourages uninhibited self-expression. The heavily pigmented cream products of its new Toxic Nature collection have a painterly texture -- less for a sheer effect, more for full coverage -- and they're surprisingly pretty. Try Bedaub, a mint shade, or Dab, a lilac, on your lids for a statement in pastel. To further intensify the color, layer eye shadow on top of the pigment. Neon fans should make for nail varnishes in Gamma, an electric orange hue, or Radium, a killer lime-green. If acid tones are outside of your comfort zone, test the line with Stagnate, a deep gray-mauve polish. Illamasqua cream pigments, $24; nail polish, $14; at Sephora."

But somehow, it just got a little classier: Will Ferrell, the ''Saturday Night Live'' alumnus turned star of hit films like ''Talladega Nights: The Ballad of Ricky Bobby'' and ''Anchorman: The Legend of Ron Burgundy,'' will be the 14th recipient of the Mark Twain Prize, the John F. Kennedy Center for the Performing Arts said on Thursday morning. Mr. Ferrell said in a statement that he was ''truly honored to receive this distinction,'' adding: ''I will now begin cultivating a Mark Twain-esque mustache in anticipation of the event.'' The award - which comes with a copy of an 1884 bronze portrait bust of Twain sculptured by Karl Gerhardt - will be officially presented to Mr. Ferrell at a Kennedy Center ceremony on Oct. 23. (The ceremony will be taped for television, though a broadcast date was not immediately announced.) Mr. Ferrell, who recently wrapped a four-episode stint on ''The Office'' and appears in the new film ''Everything Must Go,'' is one of several ''S.N.L.'' figures to receive the Twain Prize, including last year's winner, Tina Fey; Lorne Michaels, the creator and executive producer of ''S.N.L.,'' who won in 2004; and Steve Martin, a frequent ''S.N.L.'' host, who won in 2005."

The 1981 painting, ''The Innocent Eye Test'' by Mark Tansey, was bought by Mr. Wylde for $2.5 million from the Gagosian Gallery in 2009. Last year, the gallery told Mr. Wylde it had learned that the Met already owned 31 percent of the painting -- which depicts a cow gazing at a portrait of other cows -- and that the other owner had promised that the museum would eventually own the whole thing. Mr. Wylde filed suit in federal court in Manhattan against the gallery, contending it had misled him, and held on to the painting. According to the suit filed by Mr. Wylde on Tuesday, the owner of the other 69 percent of the painting is Jan Cowles, the mother of Charles Cowles, a longtime art dealer who had previously owned the painting. Mr. Cowles, reached by The New York Times in March, said the whole dispute was his fault: ''I didn't even think about whether the Met owned part of it or not.'' He added, ''And one day I saw it on the wall and thought, 'Hey, I could use the money' and so I decided to sell it.''"

Fran was that rare, honest voice; she spoke her mind, never hesitating to give her opinion, challenging those around her about matters great and small, and that is what everyone expected from her. Family and friends including many with far more formal education than she ever attained sought her wisdom and made major life decisions based on her insights and intuitive knowledge of the right choice. She had an innate curiosity about intriguing topics, relishing conversations with interesting people, but not suffering fools or bores gladly. She was good at everything she tried she could sing and dance like the Broadway star she might have been, she was a Life Master in bridge, she could unclog a sink, cook a gourmet meal and design a house (friends would never dream of remodeling without Fran reviewing the blueprints). Her sense of style, grace and design were so incredibly natural. Her sense of humor and mischievousness were ever present her threats to tip over the table in response to bad restaurant service or her telling her young children, to their embarrassment in front of their classmates, that they needed to hurry home after school to skin the elephants she kept in the basement (because that's where corned beef comes from!). She always had games to play with her grandchildren thumbs wars and hand-slap contests and old jokes to tell. With her beloved husband Joe, who died three years ago, she treasured living in New York. She loved dining at Shun Lee Palace and Il Nido but was happy having a frank at Papaya King. She loved visiting museums but was just as happy sitting for hours with Joe by the sailboat pond in Central Park. She loved taking her grandchildren shopping at Bloomingdales but she could not pass up a bargain at Loehmann's. Fran will live on through her children, Stephan, Rob, Lisa and Scott, and her 10 grandchildren and two great grandchildren. She was a remarkable woman, so ahead of her time and yet so perfect in every moment of the day. We will miss her."

Her death was confirmed by her longtime friend Nancy Grossman, an artist with whom Siegel was famously photographed with a scarf tied around both of their heads by Richard Avedon. Born in Brooklyn, 1939, and entirely self-taught, she worked in sculpture, constructions of wood, metal and cloth, but is most recognized for her sardonic collages seamlessly combining pictures into biting satires. Siegel was one of the first artists whose work was used on the Op-Ed page of the New York Times when the use of art was initiated by Editor Charlotte Curtis and Lou Silverstein. Her memorable images appeared frequently during the Vietnam and Watergate Eras. Between 1956 and 2004, her work was exhibited in Museums and Galleries such as The Brooklyn Museum, Krasner Gallery, The Riverside Museum, Art Directors Club, Frank Rehn Gallery, The American Institute of Graphic Art, The Jewish Theological Seminary -- all in New York; The Weatherspoon Museum of Art, North Carolina; Louvre Musee des Arts Decoratifs, Paris, France; Musee des Beaux-Arts, Bordeaux, France; Palais des Beaux-Arts, Brussels, Belgium. Her collages appeared in numerous publications such as Harper's Bazaar, Esquire, Ms. Magazine and The Saturday Review. She was honored by the American Institute of Graphic Arts, Art Director's Clubs of New York and New Jersey and the Society of Publication Designers respectively in 1972, '73 and '74 with Certificates of Merit and Excellence. She is survived by her sister Arlene Gindoff and her niece Allana Syllvan, both of Jackson, NJ."

The son of a wealthy sugar planter and valedictorian of Yale’s Class of 1853, Gibson had long supported secession. Conflict was inevitable, he believed, not because of states’ rights or the propriety or necessity of slavery. Rather, a war would be fought over the inexorable gulf between whites and blacks, or what he called “the most enlightened race” and “the most degraded of all the races of men.” Because Northern abolitionists were forcing the South to recognize “the political, civil, and social equality of all the races of men,” Gibson wrote, the South was compelled to enjoy “independence out of the Union.” (Read Randall Lee Gibson’s article, “Our Federal Union.”)"

The airborne sequences made the movie particularly compelling when seen in a theater with special glasses. ''When Hiccup first climbs on Toothless's back and urges the dragon to take wing, the hearts of the audience soar with a primitive and durable delight,'' A. O. Scott wrote in The New York Times. ''The techniques that enabled this feeling may be dauntingly complicated, but the feeling could not be simpler.'' At the beginning and the end, '' 'How to Train Your Dragon' is noisy and action-packed in the usual way,'' Mr. Scott added, with ''eye-straining, ear-popping large-scale effects.'' But they are worth sitting through, he said, ''for the tenderness, beauty and exhilaration that are the movie's great strengths.'' 10:30 A.M.

His fine play coincides with his appeal to avoid suspension by the PGA Tour over a loud on-course argument with a playing partner, Sean O'Hair, at the Zurich Classic of New Orleans three weeks ago. According to The Associated Press, it was the second time this year that Sabbatini has run into trouble because of his behavior on the golf course.

The report concluded that NATO had used flawed intelligence and killed the wrong man, partly because his name had been used as an alias by a Taliban insurgent -- not that the episode illustrated how shifting allegiances and identities among a number of players in Afghanistan make it ''nearly impossible to make accurate judgments about them.''

In collaboration with Clare Gesualdo his dear friend and companion for over 40 years Tony enabled thousands of high school students to profit from his contagious love of music. First for 46 years at the Pingry School in New Jersey, and then at St. George's School in Middletown, RI, he invigorated existing gleeclub and choir curricula. He also introduced Brass Choirs to each institution. Their performances reflected Tony's exceptional talent in generating adolescent enthusiasm. This was his all consuming focus in life. Nothing came in the way of his fierce loyalty to his students. They sang and played at celebrated concert halls in England, Europe and the United States. They even toured behind the Iron Curtain in the 1970s. Through Tony's generosity both Pingry and St. George's increased the quality and quantity of instruments available for student performances. Tony's second teaching discipline was physics, a lifelong interest. As was sailing, shared with Clare. With headquarters on Cape Cod or Martha's Vineyard they were joined by friend and students on summer sailing adventures. Born in Paris, Tony came to the Untied States at age 11. He first attended the Buckley School in New York City and then the Harvey School. He was in the Class of 1947 at St. Paul's School, Concord, NH and in the Class of 1951 at Hamilton College. Tony served in the US Army before beginning his teaching career in the mid 1950's. His half brother Joseph McCrindle died some years ago.

2011-05-14T00:00:00Z,"BERYLSON--Kermit J.,died on May 9, 2011 at age 97. He was a senior partner at KPMG in New York City, and was on General Eisenhower's staff planning D-Day in World War II. Born in NYC in March 1914, he received his BA and MBA degrees with distinction from City College of New York and Columbia University, respectively; worked on development of the Hoover Dam in Nevada before joining the armed forces; and was certified as a CPA in the states of New York, Illinois and California after the War. His military service began at the War Department in the Pentagon, moved on to the desert war in North Africa with General Patton, and then to SHAEF (Supreme Headquarters Allied Expeditionary Force) in London working on airborne logistics for the invasion of Continental Europe. After participating in the invasion, he rejoined General Patton in the 3rd Army fighting at the battles of Huertgen Forest and the Bulge (Bastogne). After U.S. victory at the Bulge, he was with the Allied troops held at the Elbe River by General Eisenhower in order to allow the Russian Army to be the first to enter Berlin. His War service included participation in the liberation of Paris, Munich and Dachau (concentration camp), was honored by four major service medals for valor, and culminated with the rank of Lieutenant Colonel. After the war, while building his distinguished accounting career, he was also a member of the ERISA Advisory Council of the U.S. Department of Labor, was a management consultant to the Pension Benefits Guaranty Corporation, served as President of the New York State Society of CPAs, and was awarded the Royal Order of Vasa by the Kingdom of Sweden for services to the Crown. He was the loving and beloved husband of the late Marjorie Cantor Berylson for 50 years before her death. He is survived and lovingly remembered by his daughter and her husband, Jane and Stephen Flechner of Denver, and by his son and his wife, John and Amy Smith Berylson of Boston. He is also survived and remembered by his adoring grandchildren, Jennifer (and her husband Jonathan Block), Laura, James, and Elizabeth. He was respected and admired by all who had the privilege of knowing him. Private family interment service will be held at Mt Hope Cemetery in Hastings-on-Hudson."
2011-05-14T00:00:00Z,"When you're getting unemployment benefits, you by definition don't have a lot of cash to spare. So it seems especially unfair that people who receive their jobless benefits on prepaid debit cards are subject to a variety of fees they can ill afford to pay. A report out this week from the National Consumer Law Center lays out a host of ways in which banks nibble away at jobless benefits with fees the center called ''junk.'' The prepaid cards are most often used by jobless recipients who don't have checking accounts, and so are ineligible for direct deposit. Practices vary from state to state because jobless benefits are distributed at the state level, and state governments negotiate the terms of agreements with card providers. In many states, charges apply for using A.T.M.'s, even if they're in network; checking balances; and even for not using the card enough (inactivity fees, as high as $3)."

2011-05-15T00:00:00Z,"''Catch Me if You Can'' might have gotten mixed reviews, but pretty much everyone agrees that Norbert Leo Butz's rendition of ''Don't Break the Rules'' in the first act is the kind of showstopper you don't see on Broadway all that often. Except this season, which is notable for numbers that, through the alchemy of song, sound, legs, lights and star power - not to mention tap dancing - build into something more joyful than the sum of their parts. As the droopy F.B.I. agent Carl Hanratty, Mr. Butz spends much of ''Catch Me'' on the trail of the snazzy con man Frank Abagnale Jr. (Aaron Tveit). But in ''Don't Break the Rules,'' he takes center stage."

Enter Guido Palau, the super stylist responsible for McQueen's runway coiffures. ''Hair was always an important part of his shows,'' Mr. Palau said. ''Many times, the dress became part of the head treatment.'' Mr. Palau wanted to complement the exhibition without overpowering it, and he didn't want to resort to anything as pedestrian as wigs. To that end, he and his team painstakingly made 90 or so masks that incorporated things like leather, jewels, burlap, lace, felt, fur and feathers. Would the designer have approved? ''I think so, he was always in my mind.'' SANDRA BALLENTINE"

2011-05-15T00:00:00Z,"TYRAN--Benjamin, who was an oil executive in charge of international operations with the Natomas Company and served under its Chairman, Ralph K. Davies, during the 60's and 70's, died in his sleep on April 30 in Medford, Oregon at the age of 90. He is survived by his children, Garry (and wife Barbara) of Chevy Chase, Maryland; Cindy (and husband Randy) of Phoenix, Oregon; and Craig (and wife Kristi) of Bellingham, WA; his grandchildren Keith, Charlotte, Serena, Andrew and Chesney; and his spouse Lynn. He was preceded in death by his beloved wife of 47 years, Jeanne Deckman Tyran, who passed away in July 1994. Mr. Tyran was born in Little Falls, NY. For many years he was a resident of Hillsborough, CA, before moving to Southern Oregon. He attended Rider University, Lawrenceville, NJ receiving a BS degree in Education in 1944. Following a brief teaching assignment, he was recruited by the Arabia American Oil Company (Aramco) to work in the oil fields of Eastern Saudi Arabia, where he was stationed for two and a half years. In 1947, he was transferred to Aramco's offices in New York City, simultaneously receiving his MBA in 1950 from New York University. Subsequently, he worked for the US Department of State and with the Labor-Management Maritime committee in Washington, D.C. In 1960, Mr. Tyran founded and served as President of the Independent Petroleum Supply Company (IPS) with offices in New York City, San Francisco, Tokyo, London, Toronto, Paris and Rome. In 1963, IPS merged with the Natomas Company of San Francisco, with Mr. Tyran becoming Director and Vice President in charge of Natomas's newly-started international oil activities. During the late 1960s and early 1970s Natomas became one of the largest independent oil companies operating in Indonesia, Saudi Arabia, Europe and North America. Mr. Tyran retired from Natomas in 1973 and started Tyran Associates in 1974 specializing in petroleum consulting services, particularly in the Middle East. Following his move to Ashland in 1975, Mr. Tyran became involved in numerous civic, university and charitable activities, including: President of the Southern Oregon University Foundation; Chairman, Ashland Economic Development commission; and President of the Council for Economic Development of Oregon. Mr. Tyran completed an autobiography in October 2002 entitled, Bonsey's World: A Personal Chronicle, published by Minuteman Press. A private memorial service will be held later this summer. The family prefers gifts be made to the Tyran Chair at Southern Oregon University, Ashland."
2011-05-15T00:00:00Z,"These diagrams are the early fruits of a new approach to the most important unsolved problem of the last century: how to make a rich country out of a poor one. Development economists have many theories about how the trick is done but few proven answers. A compelling solution would be useful closer to home, too: understanding the process of economic development would help us work out whether it matters that service jobs are replacing manufacturing ones or whether there is anything the government can and should do to stimulate new industries like biotechnology or green energy. Strip away the mathematical language of economists, and conventional theories of economic growth are rather crude. Economies produce ''stuff,'' and if you want more stuff to come out of the process, put more stuff in (like human capital, say). Yet economies do not produce stuff so much as billions of distinct types of goods -- perhaps 10 billion, according to Eric Beinhocker of the McKinsey Global Institute -- ranging from size 34 dark stonewash boot-cut jeans to beauty therapies involving avocado. The difference between China's economy and that of the United States is not simply that China's is smaller; it has a different structure entirely."

But public awareness of the risk of traumatic brain injury still lags behind the science. We now know that it does not necessarily take a blow to the head to cause T.B.I. Injuries to other body parts -- particularly injuries that cause significant inflammation -- can lead to swelling of the brain and T.B.I.-like effects. Parents and coaches need to be more alert to signs of ''trauma spectrum disorder,'' even when there's no blow to the head."

2011-05-15T00:00:00Z,"Centuries before the collapse of Sun Belt real estate, Dutch tulips were the original symbol of speculative excess and market correction. Brought to the Netherlands from Asia in the 16th century, the flower sparked an acquisitive fever that culminated, in 1637, with a single bulb of one variety selling for what was then an unheard-of 5,200 guilders -- the price of a house. Suddenly the market disintegrated and Tulipomania passed, leaving the Netherlands to tighten its grip on the global market by providing dominant auction houses and, according to Fred Wever of the auction house FloraHolland, ''the perfect soil and weather circumstances'' for growing the flowers. Despite the recent financial crisis' lingering effects, Dutch auction houses are still handling about $300 million in tulip sales each year. Presumably U.S. suburban real estate also will bloom again someday. FLYOVER Additional images are atnytimes.com/magazine."

2011-05-15T00:00:00Z,"DuBOURG--Antoine, of Newport, RI, died in his sleep on Thursday, May 12, at age 82. In collaboration with Clare Gesualdo his dear friend and companion for over 40 years Tony enabled thousands of high school students to profit from his contagious love of music. First for 46 years at the Pingry School in New Jersey, and then at St. George's School in Middletown, RI, he invigorated existing gleeclub and choir curricula. He also introduced Brass Choirs to each institution. Their performances reflected Tony's exceptional talent in generating adolescent enthusiasm. This was his all consuming focus in life. Nothing came in the way of his fierce loyalty to his students. They sang and played at celebrated concert halls in England, Europe and the United States. They even toured behind the Iron Curtain in the 1970s. Through Tony's generosity both Pingry and St. George's increased the quality and quantity of instruments available for student performances. Tony's second teaching discipline was physics, a lifelong interest. As was sailing, shared with Clare. With headquarters on Cape Cod or Martha's Vineyard they were joined by friend and students on summer sailing adventures. Born in Paris, Tony came to the Untied States at age 11. He first attended the Buckley School in New York City and then the Harvey School. He was in the Class of 1947 at St. Paul's School, Concord, NH and in the Class of 1951 at Hamilton College. Tony served in the US Army before beginning his teaching career in the mid 1950's. His half brother Joseph McCrindle died some years ago.

2011-05-15T00:00:00Z,"SCHNITZER--Harold J.,Harold J. Schnitzer, businessman, philanthropist, and civic leader, passed away in Portland, Oregon early Wednesday morning, April 27, at the age of 87 of complications from cancer and diabetes. He was born in Portland, June 8, 1923. He earned a Bachelor of Science degree in metallurgy from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology in 1944 and, immediately thereafter, served in the U.S. Army until his discharge in 1947. Upon returning to Portland he joined his brothers in the family scrap and steel business, Schnitzer Steel, working alongside them until 1950, at which time he left and founded Harsch Investment Properties, a leading diversified owner and operator of industrial, office, retail and multi-family properties in five Western states. He served as President and Chairman of the Board for two decades before being joined by his son Jordan in 1970, who now serves as President. Together, he and his son grew the company into one of the largest, privately held real estate companies in the western United States. Throughout his life he focused on three things: family, the business and his community. Harold learned early on from his parents, Sam and Rose Schnitzer, who immigrated to the United States in the early 1900s, the responsibility of making a difference with his life. They taught him and his siblings (Manuel, Morris, Mollie, Edith, Gilbert and Leonard) the importance of giving back to your community. In 1949 he met and married Arlene Director. Married for 62 years, they were life-long partners in business, the arts and philanthropy. Their son Jordan was born in 1951. Over a career of 60 years there have been hundreds of organizations and causes that have benefited from his leadership and financial support. Harold served on the board of Lewis & Clark College for 16 years, a Life Trustee since 1995. His service to the Portland Art Museum spanned 21 years, ultimately as Chairman of the Board from 1997 to 2001. He and Arlene are especially proud of establishing the Center for Northwest Art, and a curatorial and annual artist awards program. They also were major collectors of Han and pre-Han ceramics that led to establishing the nationally recognized Arlene and Harold Schnitzer Collection of Early Chinese Art. They gifted a number of works from the collection to the Portland Art Museum along with endowing the position of Curator of Asian Art. In addition to all of the philanthropic support in the Pacific Northwest, Harold and Arlene also have also been strong supporters of arts and cultural institutions in the Bay Area and Palm Springs, where they have residences. More recently Harold provided the lead gift establishing the Harold Schnitzer Diabetes Health Center at Oregon Health Science University (OHSU) in 2007, one of only ten centers in the nation treating children and adults and the only one on the West Coast. A diabetic since his early 40s, he valued good health care and appreciated its connection to the quality and longevity of life. The Center is his expression of helping others in their struggle with diabetes. Harold was always interested in ensuring that young people have the same educational opportunities that he had. He had a lifelong interest in funding scholarships and educational grants, and that ultimately led to him establishing Judaic studies programs at both the University of Oregon and Portland State University. Harold served the City of Portland on a variety of projects including the development of the Portland Center for the Performing Arts. Because of his leadership and philanthropy, the city named its symphony hall, the Arlene Schnitzer Concert Hall, in honor of his wife, Arlene. He has been honored by numerous civic organizations regionally and nationally in partnership with his wife Arlene including the following: Doctor of Humane Letters from Portland State University, Distinguished Service Award from the University of Oregon, Aubrey Watzek Award from Lewis & Clark College, Portland First Citizen Award 1995, the Outstanding Philanthropist Award from the National Society of Fundraising Executives and an honorary doctorate degree from the Pacific Northwest College of Art. Harold is survived by his wife, Arlene, his son Jordan, his two granddaughters Arielle and Audria, his brother Gilbert who resides in San Francisco, California, his sister Mollie who resides in Beverly Hills, California, and numerous nieces and nephews. Even during the last days of his life he was still working and planning on how to make life better for everyone else around him. A Memorial Service was held on Wednesday, May 11th, 2011."

The early '90s announced a more stripped-down view of fashion -- call it grunge, if you like -- and the waif Kate fit the bill as she inspired an industry. A decade later, in 2003, the artist Chuck Close was still justified in saying of Ms. Moss: ''She's not selling a product. The product is her.'' His remark was made in the context of a special issue of W magazine, for which 17 artists, including Mr. Close, were asked to make works around her. She had already served as an artist muse, for Lucian Freud and Gary Hume, among others. Despite his initial reservations about working with Ms. Moss, by then a celebrity, for a mainstream magazine, Mr. Close said, ''It couldn't have been lovelier.''"

I watched her square, expressive face very closely because this bear -- maybe 300 pounds and 10 yards away -- would be the one deciding how the encounter played out. An adrenaline-driven voice in my head said, ''This could go badly.'' But it was also telling me how incredibly thrilling it was to be so near this animal. Not being on top of the food chain certainly heightens one's awareness. We were four people and a dog tucked against a slope, partly hidden by waist-high grass.

Reno Sweeney is a little bit of a Pied Piper, and over the course of the number everybody gets caught up in her philosophy. And in Sutton [Foster, center] we have a Reno Sweeney who can lead the whole number -- it all swirls around her. The number develops in sections, and because we have this three-level set I knew that at the end of the number people would dance on all three levels of the set. We call it the 'All Skate' section -- like at a roller rink where sometimes it's Girls' Skate, sometimes Boys' Skate, and then there's All Skate, where everyone skates. It's not just a group of dancers surrounded by a chorus of singers. The powerful moment is to build to everyone facing front and tapping at the audience. By the end it's 20 pairs of feet tapping. We wanted the number to have this relentless energy, and it does.''"

The region has strategic importance because it provides access to supply routes in the south. An estimated 150,000 people live here, many from the Berber minority, which was neglected by Col.

2011-05-15T00:00:00Z,"For authors, choosing a book cover is the fraught moment their very private creation starts putting on its game face and getting ready to enter the market. For cover designers, it can also be the beginning of their own struggle on behalf of their favorite ideas. A proposed cover can be killed for any number of reasons. It's too dark. It's too light. (White covers don't look good on Amazon, and tend to get dirty in stores.) It looks too much like Y.A. fiction. It won't appeal to men. And can't that monkey in the corner look more ''literary''? The death blow can come from any direction: not just from the author and the agent, but from the publisher, the in-house sales force or buyers for the major retailers, who have been known to reduce the size of an order unless a cover is changed. Designers can generate as many as 50 covers for high-profile books, though a half-dozen or so is more typical, and sometimes they get lucky with the first shot. Do designers sometimes know when they've gotten a cover exactly right? ''Yes,'' said Allison Saltzman, art director at Ecco. ''But there are others you feel totally confident about and then somebody kills them too.'' Below are some killed covers whose creators couldn't quite let them rest in peace."

2011-05-15T00:00:00Z,"SINCE 2006, when Arctic Monkeys appeared on the British music scene, Alex Turner, the frontman, has been acclaimed as a songwriter wise beyond his years. (He was 20 when the group hit it big, thanks in part to the tendency of the British press to trumpet and acclaim.) Through lineup changes and side projects, and a recent foray in New York with his girlfriend, Alexa Chung, the MTV personality and Madewell designer, Mr. Turner has gravitated toward classic musicians, like Gene Clark of the Byrds, and films like the 1959 western ''Rio Bravo.'' His retro sensibility is evident on the band's fourth album, ''Suck It and See'' (Domino), to be released June 6. The title seems cheeky but it's not, Mr. Turner said. ''It's an old Britishism, like a bit Dick van Dyke-y, like 'give it a try' almost -- it'd be a slogan for some candy,'' he said. ''That's not really traveled very well.'' In a conversation peppered with other Britishisms (''nice one, love'' he said, often, alongside saucier phrases) he recently spoke with Melena Ryzik from Stockholm, where the band members were starting their tour, performing together for the first time in over a year. ''I'm a bit nervous, to be honest with you,'' Mr. Turner said. ''I have just opened a beer, actually. We'll see if that's going to help it out. I don't want to do too much of that. I'm worried I might become forgetful, and there's a lot of words in our songs.'' Here are excerpts from their conversation. Q: What were you listening to when you wrote the album?"

2011-05-16T20:30:51Z,"More than a few of the respondents to my column about CUNY’s on-again-off-again-on-again awarding of an honorary degree to Tony Kushner say that while I may be correct about the “technical” definition of academic freedom, I miss the larger point. That’s because there isn’t one. A board of trustees with every right to make a decision made it in a way that (a) ran counter to its previous practice (b) permitted a single member (Jeffrey Wiesenfeld) to derail a process that had seemed to be on a familiar track and (c) put CUNY right in the middle of the briar patch called the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. Maladroit, unfortunate and (as I said) dumb. But that’s it. It was just the board screwing up with the predictable public-relations disaster as the result. No one’s freedom was curtailed, no one’s speech was censored, no harm, except to the board’s reputation and by extension to CUNY’s, was done.Because Wiesenfeld’s objections were to Kushner’s views on Israel, the uproar that followed the board’s decision to table his nomination quickly escalated into a shouting match between those who said that Israel was engaged in ethnic cleansing and those who replied that people who said that were anti-Semites and/or self-hating Jews. The responses to my column followed the same pattern. No one wanted to hear the topic of academic freedom “parsed” (a word used in derision by one reader, as if parsing something, trying to get it right, were a crime). MSP Shiloh complained that “Dr. Fish misdirects our attention to the arcane and off topic of the academic honorary degree process,” when “[t]his was, and is, about Israel’s persecution” of Palestinians. Other respondents were just as sure that “this was, and is, about” a university honoring a “self–righteous hack” (mcghostoflectricity) who spews “current day Palestinian propaganda” (neilrobert). Both sides are wrong, not about Israel – I did not and will not come down on that issue — but about what “this” is about. It’s about institutional ineptness, a relatively small matter that nevertheless can teach us some lessons. The back-and-forth trading of ritual insults is hardly edifying, but a proper understanding of what academic freedom is might be."

The Bay of Biscay provides the town with two main waves: the Plage de la Côte des Basques, a popular and consistent sandbar break; and the Grande Plage, an unpredictable, high-performance beach break up the coast. At least a dozen groups give surfing lessons, among them Jo Moraiz (011-33-6-62-76-17-24; jomoraiz.com), France’s first surf school.

All of this left her feeling, understandably, sluggish, until she adopted the Metabolic Balance Diet. “It’s this German diet. They take your blood and they analyze your hormone levels, vitamin levels, what’s right for you, your body type, your height, your weight. They analyze everything and give you this big list of what you can and cannot eat,” Kidd explained while previewing her summer and fall collections. “But the main rules are one type of protein for each meal, you’ve got to wait five hours between each meal, no snacking, an apple a day. The first thing you eat should be protein — it’s all about leveling your blood sugar and your hormones. Weight loss is the third thing. It’s detox for the first two weeks — you’re not allowed any fat. I’ve lost 23 pounds since January, 15 of them in the first 10 days.” The svelte Kidd was in New York a couple of weeks ago for the Metropolitan Museum of Art Costume Institute Gala (she wore McQueen), where she was privy to some testimonials to one of her Target products, Show Stopper Year-Round Body Glow. “It’s organically grown into quite a successful little product,” she said. “I had five people at the Met ball come up to me and say, ‘My makeup artist put it on me.

A technical problem left about 175,000 people in movie theaters around the world (and nearly 4,000 people at the Met itself) twiddling their thumbs while waiting for the start of a live high-definition broadcast of the cycle's second installment, ''Die Walküre,'' above. Finally, after about 45 minutes, the performance started. The 45-ton set consists of a row of giant planks that revolve around an axis, which can also move up and down. Each plank has an encoder that transmits information about its position to a computer, the Met's technical director, John Sellars, explained during the first intermission. One of those encoders was not working and had to be fixed, he said. The malfunction was reminiscent of the ''Ring's'' opening night, the first performance of ''Das Rheingold'' in September, when a problem prevented the formation of the bridge over which the gods cross into Valhalla."

Al died in Phuket, Thailand of a heart attack at the age of 51. For many of us, 51 is only half a life. But Al packed three incredible lives into those 51 years. His achievements were wider in range and more extreme in their intensity than most people can imagine cramming into one full term life. Al was born in Rochester, NY, grew up in Madison, CT. and graduated from Colgate University. He was the author of the best-selling House of Nomura, Quake and the yet unpublished biography of Harry Oppenheimer. He was a financier extraordinaire with a career in investments and start-up businesses that started in Hong Kong; moved to Japan (where he met and married his adoring and adored wife Anne Cabot-Alletzhauser); London, where he helped found TIR, the global investment research house, and fund the fledgling publishing company Bloomsbury Press; and then on to South Africa, where he briefly took the helm of Penrose Holding, provided the initial kindling for the multi-manager business that morphed from Time Life, m Cubed and then Advantage Asset Management, ran the Cabot South African Hedge Fund and funded Nutrihealth Holdings. In the last phase of his business career he spearheaded the Jumeirah CuluCulu Polo Resorts project in Argentina and provided support and funding to the frontier asset management business Siam Knight Financial Securities Company in Bangkok Thailand. Al was a sunriser who went through life open to everything. Sunrisers believe you never know where the next great adventure and idea might be hidden. Al knew what it meant to be a true friend without boundaries. Friends continue to stay connected from every continent. He was an ardent polo player, a true global itinerant, and above all an absolutely amazing husband and father. For his three children: Arianna, Max and Chloe, Al was an incredible life force who made each of us feel we could achieve anything. He loved each of us for our own uniqueness and he had a brilliant capacity to identify what it was about each of us that made us special. Al has been loved and cherished and will be sorely missed. He is survived by his father Al and four siblings, Kurt, Amy, Eric and Judy, his wife Anne, his children Arianna, Max, and Chloe, and his friends from everywhere. A private memorial will be held at his home on Wednesday, May 18th at 3:00pm."

But he also confronted a standard of civil-military relations that internalized domestic political intrigue and countenanced soldierly insubordination. Epitomized by Gen. George B. McClellan, this organizational problem was a crippling impediment for Lincoln early in the Civil War that required all of his political and psychological acumen to overcome.

2011-05-17T00:00:00Z,"For six months the new imprint at Penguin Group USA led by David Rosenthal has remained nameless. No longer, Mr. Rosenthal said on Monday: it will be called Blue Rider Press, a name inspired by the painters in early 20th-century-Germany who bucked convention and promoted individual expression. ''The Blue Rider name historically represents individuality and quality in the arts,'' Mr. Rosenthal said in an e-mail. ''And that same intent will be reflected in the eclectic fiction and nonfiction books Blue Rider Press will publish.'' Mr. Rosenthal's imprint will release its first titles in the fall, including ''The New New Rules,'' by Bill Maher, and a bedtime story parody, ''Goodnight iPad.'' It has also acquired books by Valerie Plame Wilson, Delia Ephron and R. A. Dickey. Mr. Rosenthal was offered his own imprint at Penguin after losing his job as publisher of the flagship imprint of Simon & Schuster last summer, and joins other Penguin imprints, including Riverhead Books, Portfolio and the Penguin Press. This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print."
2011-05-17T00:00:00Z,"In Washington, Chris Lehane, a Democratic consultant, is known - and this is a compliment in that world - as a fervent advocate of the dark arts of politics: the cutthroat, destroy-your-enemies, do-what-it-takes-to win approach to political campaigns. ''In the last five days, it always comes down to a knife fight in a telephone booth,'' Mr. Lehane said, commenting on the final days of the 2008 presidential campaign. Mr. Guttentag, a director of documentaries, said that he originally intended to do a documentary on campaigns but decided that he would never get the necessary behind-the-scenes access. He met Mr. Lehane after enlisting him in 2008 to speak on crisis management at a class he teaches at the Graduate School of Business at Stanford University on the film business. Mr. Lehane offered behind-the-scene anecdotes from his years in politics, including working for the presidential campaigns of Al Gore and John Kerry, as well as in the White House of Bill Clinton. He decided shortly after to instead do a fictional film and asked Mr. Lehane to join as a writer."

That organization said its telethons have raised more than $1 billion and that Mr. Lewis has logged some 900 live hours of television as the program's master of ceremonies, going back to his inaugural hosting gig in 1966, when the show was carried on one New York station and took in about $1 million in pledges."

2011-05-18T00:00:00Z,"8 P.M. (HBO2) BURMA SOLDIER (2011) Like many young, unemployed men in Burma -- now known as Myanmar -- Myo Myint Cho, above, joined the army at 17 to find security and respect and to earn a living. While undergoing training that encouraged torture and even killing to suppress insurgency, he began working as an engineer, mapping and clearing landmines. But after witnessing atrocities against civilians and losing an arm, a leg and several fingers to a mortar blast, Mr. Cho left the army. He built a secret library of banned books and organized demonstrations against the regime. This film from Nic Dunlop, Annie Sundberg and Ricki Stern uses testimony, archival film footage and smuggled photographs to trace the country's history and expose abuses inflicted by the one-party system established in 1962 by Gen. Ne Win. After serving 15 years in prison for his pro-democracy political beliefs, Mr. Cho joined his brother and sister in Fort Wayne, Ind., home to one of the largest Burmese communities in the United States. Colin Farrell narrates. 7:15 P.M. (HBO Signature) TRANSAMERICA (2005) Felicity Huffman plays Bree, a preoperative transsexual who, though still technically a man, passes for a woman through the use of tasteful pink outfits, meticulously applied makeup and a breathy voice. But before her gender-reassignment surgery she needs to tie up a loose end, and soon Bree is on the road with the previously unknown son (Kevin Zegers) she long ago fathered when she was known as Stanley. ''In this debut feature by Duncan Tucker, who wrote and directed it, 'Transamerica' sets out to affirm Bree's dignity, to liberate her and others like her from any association with camp or freakishness,'' A. O. Scott wrote in The New York Times. ''That the film succeeds without slipping too far into sentimentality or didacticism is in no small measure the result of Ms. Huffman's wit and grace. (She may also be the first film actor of either sex to do frontal nudity, in a single movie, as both.)''"

The Collegium Vocale Gent, a highly regarded ensemble that helped open the newly renovated Alice Tully Hall two years ago, has canceled a June tour that was to have included three performances in and near Tokyo because of concerns over nuclear safety brought on by the March quake and tsunami that crippled a nuclear power plant, resulting in releases of radiation. The Collegium tour was also to have included several stops in China. The group was to perform Bach's B minor Mass. Because the work is religious in nature, Mr. De Laender said, Chinese officials needed to give special approval. The approval process was cut short when the group decided to cancel over safety concerns in Japan, he said, acknowledging that ''there might be a problem'' in gaining approval for a Mass performance in China. ''We were ready to do everything for approval,'' Mr. De Laender said. The issue of Chinese approval of performances by Westerners arose last month when Bob Dylan played in China."

Gordon Liddy, John Dean, Ron Kovic, Gore Vidal, Mario M. Cuomo and George McGovern."

But the ever-stylish editor Giovanna Battaglia (left) did it best. At an art opening, she wore 1950s-style Dolce & Gabbana panties under vintage Thierry Mugler. Somehow she looked covered up, conservative even, though the dress was virtually transparent. If you're game, you might test the waters for less with, say, a scoop-neck crochet dress from Free People ($268 at freepeople.com) over opaque high-waist lingerie."
