1877-10-28T00:03:58Z,"The author of this volume is so well known to the public, and is such a general favorite among all classes of readers, that it is fair to say of him that he would not attempt to treat a subject unless it were one of popular interest. Caricature is as old as art or literature, and it has a range of influence quite as wide as either."

1877-10-28T00:03:58Z,"The weather was raw and cold at Creedmoor yesterday, and this circumstance, together with the recent reduction of the number of trains running to the range, materially depleted the ranks of the riflemen. The ""Remington"" match for $300, in gold, was postponed for the fifth time, as there were not enough marksmen who cared to waste their time in shooting in the contest to reach the required number"
1877-10-29T00:03:58Z,"One difficulty with much which goes under the name of American Christianity is that it is too narrow and clannish. It cares more to bring the individual to accept certain theories than to infuse spiritual forces into the life of the community as a whole. It is only another form of carrying out the ""club principle"" in religion."
1877-10-29T00:03:58Z,"The chilly breeze and raw atmosphere yesterday made a great change in the appearance of the parks, not only in the colors and density of the foliage, but in the character and numbers of the visitors.

1877-10-29T00:03:58Z,"The Southerners in Congress preserve a discreet silence. They watch and wait. The report which attributes to them an unwillingness to sanction any action in the House that would entail embarrassment upon the Administration has about it an air of probability. A contest that should compel the Administration to define its position, and to state precisely what its Southern policy amounts to, would precipitate complications which the South is too shrewd voluntarily to encounter."
1877-10-29T00:03:58Z,It has long been predicted that British investors in Russian stock will one day be as badly off as those who trusted their money to the Turk. Sings of the coming day are beginning to be painfully apparent. The Imperial Government of the Czar has authorized five railway companies to convert their cash capital into paper.
