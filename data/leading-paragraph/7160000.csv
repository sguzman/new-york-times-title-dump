2008-12-31T11:04:29Z,"A collection of historic instruments that belonged to performers including Johnny Cash, Bill Monroe and Mother Maybelle Carter will remain with the Country Music Hall of Fame and Museum in Nashville, after the man who helped the museum obtain them committed suicide, The Associated Press reported. Bob McLean, an investor from Murfreesboro, Tenn., had donated two Johnny Cash guitars to the museum, and pledged money that the museum used to buy Monroe’s 1923 Gibson mandolin (valued at $1.1 million), and Carter’s 1928 Gibson guitar (valued at $575,000). Mr. McLean committed suicide last year when his investors accused him of stealing more than $67 million from them in a Ponzi scheme. But a settlement between the Country Music Foundation, which operates the hall of fame, and the trustee handling Mr. McLean’s bankruptcy will allow the museum to keep the instruments and write off $870,850 in unpaid pledges."

Ms. Winehouse paid a fine and was released, but later contested the fine. A previously scheduled court appearance was postponed while Mr. Fielder-Civil was serving time in a British jail on convictions stemming from a 2006 assault.

In November, the company laid off 38 employees, including its dancers and its artistic director, John Alleyne; it was narrowly able to stage its year-end production of “The Nutcracker” but has canceled planned tours. Under the restructuring plan, the company’s creditors — who are owed about $300,000 — would each be paid up to about $400 on proven claims, and a further 22 cents on the dollar above that amount. Among those creditors is Mr. Alleyne, who The Straight said is owed about $115,000. The proposal is scheduled for a vote by creditors on Jan. 9."

But he said he has since been treated by Michael O’Doherty, a founder of the Plexus Bio-Energy Clinic, which specializes in “rebalancing the life-force energy within and around the body,” according to its Web site. “When he came to visit me in Ireland, I could barely get out of the chair,” Mr. Flatley said, according to The Independent. “He saw me for about an hour and I walked for about a mile afterwards.”"

2008-12-31T00:00:00Z,"The 2008 Detroit Lions will be immortalized as the N.F.L's worst team, but in a season in which so many teams played so badly, it is almost a shame that the Lions have to go into the record books alone. There were three teams with two wins or fewer this season, the most since the strike-shortened 1982 season. Like the Lions, the Bengals (4-11-1) lost their first eight games, but were spared further ignominy by a posting a three-game winning streak to end the season. But the Bengals' offense was in a league of its own. Cincinnati, with Carson Palmer injured, scored the fewest points (204, 64 fewer than the Lions) and gained the fewest yards. The Bengals tied with the Browns and the Rams for the fewest touchdowns (20). Cincinnati also had the most punts (100), and more than a third of its drives (34.4 percent) were three-and-outs."

The Tree Carbon Calculator uses data like a tree’s age and location to see how much carbon dioxide it captures from the atmosphere and how much its shade reduces the energy needed for cooling. The program, equipped for California but to be updated nationwide by summer, was created to guide cities, utilities and schools that want to plant trees, said Greg McPherson, the center’s director. But homeowners can use it, too. He entered data about the London plane tree outside his office in Davis, Calif., and learned that each year it captures 113 pounds of carbon and saves his building 162 kilowatt-hours in energy, “relatively good numbers.” The calculator can be downloaded at <a href=""http://www.fs.fed.us/psw"">www.fs.fed.us/psw.</a> To understand your results, comparative data is at <a href=""http://www.fs.fed.us/psw/publications"">www.fs.fed.us/psw/publications</a> under the first “Publication List.” STEVEN KURUTZ."

PRICES Full ownership residences start at $5.3 million, shared ownership at $406,000. STATUS Scheduled to open late this year. DEVELOPER Black Diamond Resorts- Vail LLC. CONTACT (877) 748-8245 or www .fourseasons.com/ownvail. DETAILS The town of Vail, which was incorporated more than 40 years ago, recently found itself in a bit of a midlife crisis. While the ski resort remained one of the world's best known, the town below had grown a bit dated, with a number of its buildings still stuck in the '70s. The response was a large-scale renewal effort, now valued at around $2 billion, that includes this 2.7-acre Four Seasons-branded project. Its plans call for a 121-room resort and 35 condominiums in a 10-story building near the entrance to Vail Village. Nineteen of the residences will be two- to four-bedroom, 1,835- to 3,500-square-foot furnished units that are sold in one-12th fractional shares. Fractional owners will be granted at least three weeks of use a year, including one week in winter and one in summer that will be assigned on a rotating schedule. The rest of the residences are whole-ownership, 1,650- to 5,800-square-foot units with one to five bedrooms. Both types of residences will include gas fireplaces and terraces, and most will have views of the mountain. For amenities, there will be the spa, a fitness center, a fine-dining restaurant and a 75-foot-long pool and whirlpools in a courtyard. The ski lounge will include a bar and an outdoor terrace, and ski and snowboard valet service will be offered nearby at the resort's Vista Bahn lift."

Almost as soon as they began to move, the trucks hit a roadside bomb. At least nine civilians and an unknown number of soldiers were killed. Thousands of Ethiopian troops stormed into Mogadishu two years ago to shore up Somalia's weak transitional government. But their efforts have mostly failed, and Islamist insurgents have retaken most of the country. It was not clear whether the troops were leaving Somalia entirely or redeploying to other areas of the country. Western diplomats estimate that several thousand Ethiopian troops remain in Somalia."

2009-01-04T12:45:56Z,"FORT LAUDERDALE, Fla. -- Of all the alarming statistics entering Thursday's national title game between Oklahoma and Florida, perhaps none is more surprising than Oklahoma's pass defense being ranked No. 98 nationally. The Sooners have yielded 253.1 passing yards per game, sandwiching them statistically between the college football immortals Marshall and Utah State.But that didn't stop Sooners cornerback Dominique Franks from tossing a few verbal barbs toward Florida on Sunday morning. Franks said that Florida quarterback Tim Tebow was not as good as Oklahoma's Sam Bradford, Texas' Colt McCoy or Texas Tech's Graham Harrell.""I'd say he'd probably be about the fourth best quarterback in our conference,"" Franks said of Tebow.Asked to expand on his bulletin board material, he happily obliged.""I really think with those three guys, it's a lot harder to prepare for those guys,"" Franks said. ""We're coming in and facing Tebow, and he wants to run the ball a lot more. He's predominantly a running quarterback. So to me it's going to be a lot easier for us to prepare to stop the run than having to face a quarterback that might throw the ball 40 or 50 times a game.""When told of Franks's comments, Florida Coach Urban Meyer chuckled. ""Ah, the gift of youth,"" he said.In terms of production, Tebow lags behind the three Big 12 quarterbacks in overall yardage and touchdown passes. But he ranks fourth nationally in efficiency (behind Bradford and McCoy but ahead of Harrell). Perhaps his most impressive statistic is his 28 touchdown passes compared to 2 interceptions.And while Tebow finished third in the Heisman Trophy voting behind Bradford and McCoy, he finished with more first-place votes. Franks said the Sooners hoped to show that Bradford was the rightful winner.""Everybody is going to think Tebow should have won the Heisman,"" he said. ""But the right person won the Heisman, and we're going to go out there and show the reason why he won it.""Needless to say, the Oklahoma defensive coordinator Brent Venables wasn't pleased with Franks for poking at Tebow, saying Franks was ""just a young guy that doesn't know any better."""

Other teams are also hurting. If overall revenue holds steady and keeps the contract-mandated salary structure near its current level, some clubs may not be able to meet payroll minimums in 2009-10."

Judging by the spring men's collections (which will be hitting stores any day now), designers are going for a more pulled-together Euro look. You might consider throwing out those beat-up jeans and breaking out the printed silk scarves. Who better to exemplify this new continental trend than Gabrielecorto Moltedo, the young designer well known for his aristo look? It doesn't hurt that he is also a member of Italian fashion royalty: his family owned the luxury house Bottega Veneta until 2001, when they sold it to the Gucci Group.

2009-01-04T00:00:00Z,"VINOLOGY Brent Simon declared himself an official collector after he began buying bottles of wine he had no intention of ever drinking. His collection began in earnest after his college graduation, when he bought a 1997 bottle of Beringer Private Reserve cabernet sauvignon for $100. Thereafter, each time something nice happened, he acquired a bottle . And when something great happened, he might drink one. Mr. Simon, 30, founder of a medical device company, is in his second year at the Johnson School of Management at Cornell. His admission prompted a 1996 Cristal. Today, his collection hovers at 40 bottles. Still, he's perfectly content drinking a $10 zinfandel, he says, adding, ''I don't read Wine Spectator or anything like that,'' though he takes field trips to nearby wineries with the Johnson Wine Club. Wine aficionados also congregate at clubs at Middlebury, Hamilton and the University of Chicago Booth School of Business. And one of the more popular courses at Cornell's School of Hotel Administration is ''Introduction to Wine,'' which enrolls more than 700 a term."

2009-01-04T00:00:00Z,"THE WILD SIDE It's hard to become a fossil, to leave a tangible record of your presence on the Earth millions of years after you died. Most of us swiftly get recycled into other beings. After all, the competition for corpses is fierce. Species of bacteria, worms, ants, flies, beetles and even some butterflies have a taste for rotting flesh. And that's without mentioning larger scavengers, like vultures, hyenas and mongooses. But evading Nature's undertakers is only the first step in becoming a fossil. If you want to be preserved for millions of years, you also have to choose the right place to die. If you're lucky, you'll have a quick burial in the silts and sediments of a river bed, or under volcanic ash. For many environments can never yield fossils. Die on top of a mountain, for example, and your fossil hopes are slim. The reason is that mountains don't bury, they erode. (You might get frozen in ice, in which case you may last as long as the ice does; that may be several thousand years; but it won't be several million. Ice is for those with modest ambitions for immortality.)"

""Many schools hide behind the fact that they're need-blind, need-blind being a proxy for providing access,"" says Jennifer Rickard, Bryn Mawr's dean of admissions and financial aid.

It is with deep regret and sadness that we announce the untimely death of our dear friend and colleague Gerry Van Oortmarssen, who died in a plane crash, piloting his own plane, in Vienna, Austria on December 14, 2008. Gerry came to Elekta in 1997, bringing with him vast experience and skills in managing the sales, marketing and service of advanced medical technologies from Siemens, ADAC and other companies in the international health care market. Over the years, Gerry held several senior management positions in Elekta, including Head of the European Region, Global Head of Sales, Marketing and Service and most recently of Executive Vice President Business Region Asia, making major contributions to the growth and development of Elekta. He was a long time member of the Elekta Executive Committee and a very good and close friend to many of us. Regardless of position, we all had come to depend on Gerry's strong commitment, his high energy level and his persistence to ''close the deal''. He was called ''The Flying Dutchman''. The reason for this was not merely his love of flying and his habit of flying himself to meetings whenever and wherever he could. It was something more. Something in his ''can-do'' personality that made this label so appropriate for Gerry. A great man, so suddenly stolen away. Our thoughts go out to his wife and family.

2009-01-05T10:21:15Z,"Here’s one more volume that President Bush and Karl Rove can add to their years-long book-reading contest: Laura Bush will write a memoir of her life and her years in the White House. The publisher Scribner, an imprint of Simon & Schuster, said in a release that it had acquired Mrs. Bush’s as-yet untitled book and plans to publish it in 2010. The release follows weeks of speculation and rumblings that the first lady had been meeting with editors in New York to discuss the project. Scribner said in its announcement that the memoir would offer “an intimate account of Mrs. Bush’s life experiences.” Mrs. Bush said in the release that she would tell “the stories of the extraordinary events and people I’ve met in my life, particularly during my years in the White House.” Financial terms of the deal were not disclosed."

The British newspaper The Independent reported that the Scottish government has granted about $25 million towards the duke’s total asking price of about $74 million for “Diana and Actaeon.” The galleries have denied that report, and in an email message to Bloomberg News, a spokesman for the Scottish government said only that it had made “a significant funding pledge to the National Galleries of Scotland which was essential to get its fundraising campaign off the ground.” The galleries had already received more than $15 million in public and private pledges."

Parts of the home, including Lee’s study and training hall, will be restored; Mr. Yu has said he wants to add a movie theater, a library and a martial arts center.VIDEO: Watch a trailer for “Enter the Dragon.”"

Adored grandfather of Margot, Sam, Adrien, Nathan, Noah and Gideon. Respected business man and revered corporate leader. Founder and chairman of Movado Group, Inc., Gedalio ''Gerry'' Grinberg was a venerated figure in the watch industry. A man of deep passion, insight, conviction, curiosity, loyalty and generosity, Gerry inspired family, friends, colleagues and competitors through keen intellectual engagement and personal example. Gerry was widely regarded as a visionary in the industry for recognizing the potential cache of luxury watches and marketing them accordingly. Born in Cuba in 1931, he had established a successful partnership as the exclusive Cuban distributor of Omega and Piaget timepieces. Following Castro's takeover of that country in 1960, Gerry came to the United States, arriving in Miami. He soon relocated to New York City and established Piaget's U.S. distributorship, adding the U.S. distributorship for Corum, another prestigious Swiss watch line, in 1967. His company, then known as North American Watch Corporation, acquired the Concord watch brand four years later, and in 1983, acquired Movado, transforming it from small Swiss watchmaker into a world-recognized brand. In 1993, the company changed its name to Movado Group, Inc. Today, Movado Group encompasses nine distinct watch brands, and is publically traded on the New York Stock Exhange. A dedicated philanthropist, Gerry held a lifelong passion for the arts, and was active and generous in his support of many community and cultural endeavors. He was honored by the UJA-Federation of New York in 2005 with the Award for Humanitarian Excellence, and he received a Lifetime Achievement Award from the Jewelry Information Center in 2003. A man of unforgettable character, commitment and passion, Gerry will have a place in the hears and memories of everyone he touched. The family requests that donations be made to Mt.

In the memoir, Mr. Rosenblat wrote that he met his future wife during the Holocaust, when he was a prisoner at a concentration camp and she would throw him apples from outside the camp. The book was canceled after scholars disputed the truth of that and other details. But York House Press, a publisher based in White Plains, said it was in discussions to release the book as a work of fiction called “Flower at the Fence.” In a statement on its Web site, York House Press said, “We believe Mr. Rosenblat’s motivations were very human, understandable and forgivable.”"

''Buddy'', as his many friends called him, was 87 years old. A graduate of the Hotchkiss School and Yale University, Mr. Goodman remained active in the alumni affairs at both schools. As a First Lieutenant U.S. Naval Aviator, he served in World War II and was awarded the Distinguished Flying Cross and the Air Medal with cluster for action in the Pacific theater where he piloted the huge ''flying boats.'' A true renaissance man, after the war Mr. Goodman served in various executive positions in advertising, shifting gradually into mergers and acquisitions, and ultimately into several corporate start-ups. Holding patents in widely diverse fields including solar panels and various industrial grinding/deburring processes, he also was an accomplished lyricist whose 1950s songs ''My April Heart'' and ''Way Out There'' were highly praised. More recently, he wrote a song for the Yale Glee Club to recognize their new coeducational status. In his later years, Buddy took great pride in his internet column, ''Letter From New York'', written for The Blockhead Journal. Mr. Goodman was also concerned with New York social welfare issues and he actively served on the Executive Committee of Planned Parenthood of New York City for many years, as well as in various capacities with the Community Service Society and the Boy's Club of New York. He was Chairman of the Task Force on Criminal Justice for the Mayor's Voluntary Action Council for 12 years. As a loving husband, brother, and father and as an avid tennis player, sailor, and golfer, Buddy enjoyed his life to the fullest. He is survived by his wife of 56 years, Georgine Rake Goodman; his brother, Walter F. Goodman of Miami, FL and New York, NY; three children: Mrs. Prudence G. Meyer of Durham, NC, Mrs. Susannah E. Rake of Santa Barbara, CA, and John R. Goodman of Santa Barbara, CA; and three granddaughters: Laura, Georgina, and Annabelle. A memorial service will be held at The Brick Church on April 18th at 11am. In lieu of flowers, a contribution to the Community Service Society or the Boys Club of New York would be appreciated."

2009-01-08T10:51:36Z,"Author Solutions, a publisher of print-on-demand books based in Bloomington, Ind., has acquired Xlibris, a rival self-publisher, expanding its footprint in one of the fastest-growing segments of publishing. Author Solutions, which owns imprints including iUniverse and Author House, last year published 12,000 titles and sold more than 2.5 million copies of its books, according to Kevin Weiss, chief executive. The company is owned by Bertram Capital, a private equity firm. Together with Xlibris, currently based in Philadelphia, the title count for the combined company was about 19,000 in 2008. Authors who are either unable to secure a traditional publishing contract or don’t want one pay the companies to turn their manuscripts into saleable books. Some of Author Solutions’ imprints also offer services like cover design or copy editing. Some writers go on to sell their books through Amazon.com, the Web site of Barnes & Noble or other traditional booksellers. Terms of the deal were not disclosed."
2009-01-08T10:46:41Z,"Though it will still feature the stabbing of Goneril, the poisoning of Regan and other assorted tragic fates that befall its characters, the coming PBS broadcast of “King Lear” will avoid offense to delicate sensibilities by omitting a nude scene by Ian McKellen, who plays the title role, The Associated Press reported. Though Mr. McKellen regularly performed the scene in the Royal Shakespeare Company’s production of the play, a taping of “King Lear” that PBS will show on “Great Performances” on March 25 will omit it. Not that this bothers Mr. McKellen: “If it’s a distraction of that sort, it’s not worth the candle,” he said to the Television Critics Association on Wednesday, according to The A.P. Mr. McKellen added: “Every night, when I’d take my clothes off, you know what I used to do? Pull in my stomach. That’s pathetic.”"
2009-01-08T11:27:17Z,"An Ohio state representative said he would seek the assistance of the state’s attorney general after the sudden closure of the Carousel Dinner Theater in Akron, The Akron Beacon Journal reported. The theater’s owner, Joseph Palmer, told The Beacon Journal that the decision to close the 35-year-old performance space was made on Dec. 30, because of the “reversal of certain stakeholders’ written or verbal promises,” rising operating costs and declining ticket sales. No tickets for its 2009 season were supposed to be sold, Mr. Palmer said. But some customers said they were sold tickets, now worthless, for 2009 performances. “People are just frying, they’re upset,” said John Otterman, an Ohio state representative, according to The Beacon Journal. He added that the theater probably knew it was “going out of business, yet they were continuing to sell these gift certificates several days before Christmas.”"

The museum said that the recent downturn of the stock market had resulted in a 30 percent decline in its endowment — a loss of $95 million, leaving it with a remaining total of $220 million — that has forced it to cancel a planned exhibition of Lucy, a fossil female discovered in Ethiopia in 1974.

Other Broadway shows have also enjoyed record-breaking weeks, including “Shrek the Musical,” which earned a personal best $1,268,342 for the week ending Jan. 4, and “Mamma Mia!”, which earned $1,261,938 that same week.

Someone at the end of the bar is reading the newspaper, and a couple of young men are playing darts, their beers in dripping steins on the shelf beside them. You breathe in the smell of sawdust and memories as the bartender pulls a glass from behind the bar for your sacred regular drink. It's the first draft beer of the day, or a vodka and grapefruit, or if you are nursing a hangover, a glass of white wine and soda and a Fernet Branca.You take a sip and the bright street and blaring horns fade away, replaced by soothing, time-honored rituals: the fifth drink on the house, the way you can ask for a ""traveler"" in a plastic cup if you're leaving, the bills you leave on the bar so that the price of each drink is subtracted without the tawdry business of asking for money. Time stops. Sometimes, when the light is just right or you are with a certain person, you look into the mirror behind the bottles at the back of the bar - you always look wonderful in that mirror - and experience a moment of breathtaking transcendence. You are entirely at home in the world, the song on the jukebox is exactly the right song, the drink is perfect, and everything, everything is exactly as it's meant to be."

After a wild college football season, which produced plenty of highlights and controversy (and only one undefeated team), Florida and Oklahoma will play Thursday night in the B.C.S. championship game.

Teams from the SEC have won the past two national titles, while offenses in the Big 12 this year were some of the most prolific in college football history.

2009-01-09T11:11:02Z,"Like its enigmatic protagonist, Don Draper, the fate of “Mad Men” continues to unwind at its own unhurried pace. At a panel discussion held by AMC during the Television Critics Association tour, the cable channel’s president, Charlie Collier, announced that “Mad Men,” its Emmy Award-winning drama about 1960s-era advertising executives, would return to AMC for its third season this summer, Variety reported. The network has not yet announced an agreement with the show’s creator and executive producer, Matthew Weiner, with whom AMC has been negotiating since his previous contract expired after the second season of “Mad Men.” Mr. Collier was nonetheless confident that a deal would be struck in time for the show’s third season. “As long as we get the writers’ room up and running over the next few months, we’re fine,” he said, according to Variety."

The firm HOK said that its plan would preserve the exterior of the decommissioned firehouse of Engine 204, at 299 DeGraw Street in Cobble Hill Brooklyn, and carry out a gut renovation of the building’s two-story 4,250-square-foot interior; the new building will be known as the BP Music Center. In May, the city’s Economic Development Corporation chose the Brooklyn Philharmonic to remake the firehouse over a group called Friends of Firefighters, which had hoped to turn the space into a center for counseling and therapy. At that time, the corporation also gave the former firehouse of Engine 212 in Williamsburg to advocacy groups that will use it as a community center."

A Mass for the repose of his soul will be said on Saturday, January 17, 2009 at 10am, in the Church of Saint Vincent De Paul, 123 West 23rd Street, New York, New York. Temple Emmet Morgan was born on May 10, 1922 in New York City. He was the son of Mr. and Mrs. Edwin Denison Morgan. Descending from a prominent American family with illustrious ancestors, he was proudest of his descent from Thomas Addis Emmet, brother of the great Irish patriot Robert Emmet, who was hanged by the British in 1803. Following his service in the Army Air Corps during World War II, he returned to Harvard College. He was on the varsity crew and a member of the Porcellian Club. Two months before Commencement, on April 5, 1947, he was received into the Catholic Church by Fr. Leonard Feeney. From that moment he turned his back on his former life. Until 1988 he was active as a monk at Saint Benedict Center in Harvard, Massachusetts. At that time he left, seeking a stricter form of monastic life. In 1990 he entered Caldey Abbey, a monastery of the Cistercian Order of the Strict Observance, where he made his solemn profession on December 8, 1995. During his remaining years in Wales he touched the lives of many people. After a life of joy, he died in peace, having received his daily Holy Communion, surrounded by his brothers of the Order of Cistercians of the Strict Observance."

Was Donovan McNabb's benching just a ploy to heighten the drama of this season? Is there anybody who six weeks ago would have predicted that this would be the N.F.C. championship game? The Cardinals may have better insight into the Eagles' late-season run than any other team since they were the ones who started it - with a 48-20 loss at Philadelphia on Thanksgiving. The Cardinals have been a far better team in the playoffs than they were late in the season, after it was clear they had a lock on the division and seemed to give up. The Cardinals' defense has been reborn, but the pass defense will get a test from the Eagles. Philadelphia had 437 yards of offense in the earlier meeting with Brian Westbrook and Donovan McNabb each accounting for four touchdowns."

2009-01-11T00:00:00Z,"David Hajdu superbly captured the iconoclastic hero that Will Elder was to America’s youth in the dull ’50s and beyond (Dec. 28). And while his article was 99 percent lavish praise, the last paragraph left us feeling as though Willie wasted more than half his career on one of the most extravagantly illustrated comic strips in history — Playboy’s “Little Annie Fanny.” Will Elder himself would certainly take exception to the idea that he wasted his time exploring previously uncharted territory. The “Little Annie Fanny” watercolor technique alone has, at the very least, astounded artists and critics alike. Each panel was a beautifully executed painting. From our perspective, Will Elder delivered on his end of the “Little Annie Fanny” bargain. The downside of “Little Annie Fanny” was always, of course, that it was edited by committee, a process that just does not work in art and satire. “Annie” did, however, afford Will the time to paint oils, still lifes, landscapes, portraits and other personal projects that Hajdu extolled. I guess you take the good with the bad, and Will’s part of “Annie” was really rather good."

''People call me that with such respect,'' she said, ''but I still look at myself as an adolescent.'' Of course, there is also a ballad about Serge, portraying him as a ghost at the window.

Israel said its air and ground assault was meant to stop the intensifying rocket attacks on civilian areas of southern Israel, especially after a ceasefire between Israel and Hamas, the militant group that controls the Palestinian government in Gaza, lapsed on Dec. 19. Israel moved quickly to cut the Gaza Strip in two and to attack Hamas fighters and destroy its weapons and facilities."

2009-01-11T00:00:00Z,"THINK AGAIN Suppose that in the long run Gov. Rod Blagojevich is cleared of all charges, and suppose that in the short run his Senate appointee, Roland Burris, is denied a seat and someone else is appointed in his place. What then? Is the second appointee now dismissed because his or her appointment was ''tainted'' (he or she reached office as the result of an injustice)? Does the state start all over again and hold a new election? Questions like these highlight the difficulties and conundrums that arise once the lawfulness of an official action is made to depend on the purity of the person who performs it. If the rectitude of the officeholder is crucial, how far back does one go in an effort to validate it? College? High school? Grade school? Sand box? -- Stanley Fish,"

A native of Birmingham, Alabama, Morgan courageously fought the city's segregationist leaders in the early 1960s. After losing his law practice for condemning the Birmingham church bombing in 1963 that caused the death of four young black girls, Morgan established the southern regional office of the ACLU in Atlanta, which continues today as one of the nation's foremost defenders of voting rights. He later served as Director of the ACLU Washington Legislative Office before entering private practice. A pioneer civil rights lawyer, Morgan was involved in many landmark cases before the Supreme Court. The civil rights movement owes great gratitude to Mr. Morgan for his historical accomplishments. The ACLU shares that appreciation and extends our deepest sympathy to his wife Camille and son Charles."

''Are they an African ceremonial thing? Tibetan? Asian?'' questioned Mr. Cave, whose new show of Soundsuits is on view at the Jack Shainman Gallery. The answer is all of the above, with a little George Clinton, drag queen, medieval knight and Wall-E thrown in. ''It's a new hybrid,'' said Mr. Cave, who also is chairman of the fashion department at the Art Institute of Chicago. ''A whole new identity formed from other people's junk.''

Revolutions in fashion usually begin because of world events. Christian Dior's romantic 1947 New Look was a reaction to the end of World War II, and its many hardships and restrictions. But today it would be simplistic to expect the ups and downs of the stock market to be reflected in the ups and downs of skirt lengths. For one thing, women are working and 90 percent wear trousers."

2009-01-11T00:00:00Z,"The suspensions last Tuesday of two major league baseball players who tested positive for steroids after they said they took tainted supplements came a month after the N.F.L. confronted a similar problem. In that instance, the N.F.L. suspended six players who tested positive for a masking agent after they had taken an over-the-counter weight-loss drug. The common thread in the two cases are the arguments presented by players that league officials should have told them that the products were tainted and could cause them to test positive. While the players maintained that they were unwitting victims, there is no language in the collective bargaining agreements of either sport that compels league officials to warn players about potentially tainted products. In fact, legal experts said, there are several obstacles and legal liabilities that prevent sports leagues from doing so."

Two other major crashes in recent years -- a crash on takeoff in Denver last month and a fiery crash in a thunderstorm in Toronto in 2005 -- also resulted in no deaths. We asked a panel of experts if survivability in plane crashes is more dependent on the talent of the pilot or on the aircraft design."

The issue of how to treat and compensate those who were exposed to the dust -- particularly rescue workers -- has proved to be one of the most vexing problems of the aftermath. A spokeswoman for the medical examiner said she had no information on what Mr. Heyward was doing at the towers that morning. The cause of his death was given as lymphoma, complicating sarcoidosis, a lung disease. The manner of death was listed as homicide."

I have to say that the Japanese fashion flock are stealing the show here. Amazing personal style, with what is becoming a bit of a signature look for a group of them: very natty, often checked sport jackets, worn with a coordinated checked shirt underneath a crew-neck sweater, along with slender pressed gray flannel trousers, argyle or some other colored sock and a very fine English shoe. A slightly more classic take on a dandy. United Arrows, one of the best men's stores in Tokyo, exhibited its own line, Camoshita, at the show: checked suits, a matching tweed jacket and vest with a white shirt and wool bow tie, a contrasting windowpane wool trouser and an off-center-buttoning single-breasted fawn-colored wool coat -- all epitomizing this new dandy look."

In 1960, he founded Commonwealth Loan Corporation, a consumer finance company, which was sold in 1972 to First Pennsylvania Bank.

For the past 25 years, he has been Chairman of the Board of Trustees of School of Medicine, Universidad Central del Caribe.

A graduate of Fordham University, Hunter College and C.W.

When no words seemed to offer comfort, I'd finally say...but he's only ten...God isn't finished with him yet. And now in leaving I share with you ...God isn't finished with me yet either...and it may be that the best is yet to come.''

2009-01-17T00:00:00Z,"Some initial judgments about the popular movement behind Barack Obama's presidency will be formed by perceptions of the crowd at this inauguration. The last 11 inaugurations have drawn 200,000 to 1.2 million people to the Capitol steps, and predictions have ranged from a million to four million for Mr. Obama's Jan. 20 speech. No enterprise is more critical to the organizers of mass events than crowd size, but most estimates amount to little more than guesses that get repeated over and over. Yet, there is a science of estimating crowds that has become quite reliable if employed carefully. If you know the dimensions of a space, you can estimate the number of people in it with aerial photographs and standard judgments about density, tempered by realistic estimates of transportation capacity."

In the next six seasons the Buccaneers went 0-2 in playoff games, missed the postseason four times and lost their final four games this season -- including a loss at home to the Raiders in the season finale -- to miss the playoffs after starting 9-3. On Friday, Gruden and General Manager Bruce Allen were fired, an outcome that was shocking mostly for its timing. The announcement came almost three weeks after the regular season, after Gruden had made staff moves and after several teams had already hired some of the hottest coaching candidates."

2009-01-17T00:00:00Z,"When President-elect Barack Obama and his family move into the White House on Tuesday, they will be joined by Michelle Obama's 71-year-old mother, Marian Robinson. Some commentators have relished not just the novelty of the situation, but its sitcom possibilities -- the most powerful man in the world living with his mother-in-law! But the White House has always been home to many different kinds of families, all of whom re-invented the place to fit their needs. The drawings below show how four presidents -- Thomas Jefferson, Abraham Lincoln, James Garfield and Franklin D. Roosevelt -- lived and worked in the White House. Thomas Jefferson never liked the White House: too big, too grand for the American president. He was determined to suggest ''republican simplicity'' and this mainly involved rearranging furniture. For instance, what his predecessor John Adams had used as a formal reception room -- today's State Dining Room -- Jefferson turned into his office, crowding the lofty space with books from his library, trunks filled with files and a long table with many drawers, into which Jefferson personally sorted his correspondence. In 1801, when Jefferson moved in, parts of the house were still unfinished, including most of the second-floor family quarters, and he spent much of his time on the White House's main floor. -- WILLIAM SEALE, the author of ''The President's House''"

2009-01-18T00:00:00Z,"Rebecca Skloot (Jan. 4) considers various moral and legal issues related to the use of exotic nonhuman species as guides for disabled humans. Except for one: the interests of the animals themselves. Skloot quotes Lex Frieden at the University of Texas Health Science Center as saying that guide animals are akin to wheelchairs and other disability aids, insofar as the former are literally a “part” of the disabled person. The problem is, they aren’t — they are persons in their own right, born with a capacity for natural freedom that their “service” entirely deprives them of. Guide animals are brutally separated from others of their kind, are discouraged from seeking affection from other human beings and are reduced to a life of perpetual bondage to their masters. If there is a meaningful difference between “service animal” and “animal slave,” I fail to see it."

Surviving are his sons Peter 3d of Manhattan Beach, California, James of Akron, Ohio, William of New York, New York and David of Greenwich, Connecticut; a daughter Jane of Los Angeles, California; a sister, Joan Sexton of Brooklyn, four daughters-in-law and eleven grandchildren.

Hotels, restaurants, stores and all manner of other businesses will benefit as celebratory consumers are likely to buck a national trend of slowed spending.

Last month, because reporters and editors in three different parts of the paper did not take enough pains to verify information, The Times reported as fact a political telephone call that didn't happen, fell victim to a faked letter to the editor, and published a sensational anecdote about a college football recruiting battle that the paper cannot be confident is true."

I ran up the hill to where I had been meditating, but it was over two hours later. An American photographer had photographed me meditating and he showed me a shot that he zoomed in on to show my camera beside me. I knew that this was a sign; I had to let go and learn.

2009-01-18T00:00:00Z,"Rebecca Skloot (Jan. 4) considers various moral and legal issues related to the use of exotic nonhuman species as guides for disabled humans. Except for one: the interests of the animals themselves. Skloot quotes Lex Frieden at the University of Texas Health Science Center as saying that guide animals are akin to wheelchairs and other disability aids, insofar as the former are literally a ''part'' of the disabled person. The problem is, they aren't -- they are persons in their own right, born with a capacity for natural freedom that their ''service'' entirely deprives them of. Guide animals are brutally separated from others of their kind, are discouraged from seeking affection from other human beings and are reduced to a life of perpetual bondage to their masters. If there is a meaningful difference between ''service animal'' and ''animal slave,'' I fail to see it. We need to find other ways to provide necessary services for the disabled."

Marrone has been delivered a team low on talent and a fan base full of apathy. But if someone could turn around a program on passion alone, it would be Marrone.

Have three weeks of overpowering war by Israel here weakened Hamas as Israel had hoped, or simply caused acute human suffering?

The 42-year-old theater, which has staged the premieres of works by David Mamet and Sam Shepard, raised $455,000 from about 1,100 donors. Earlier this month, the theater announced on its Web site that it needed to raise $350,000 in about a week to pay down a debt of $600,000 or it would close. The theater now says it will complete its current season by reducing its budget from $2 million to $1.65 million, and postponing the premiere of the play “Mistakes Were Made” by Craig Wright until next season."
2009-01-20T10:51:47Z,"A German court has ruled that a collection of rare posters seized by the Gestapo in 1938 are the property of the son of their original owner, Bloomberg News reported. The collection of more than 4,250 posters, which includes pre-war advertisements for movies and cabaret shows as well as political propaganda, was seized from Hans Sachs, a Jewish dentist who was put in a concentration camp but later escaped with his family to Boston; the works eventually became the property of the Deutsches Historisches Museum in Berlin. Sachs’s son, Peter, now a retired airline pilot living in Sarasota, Fla., sued the museum last year for the return of the collection, estimated to be worth $5.8 million. In 2007, a German government panel turned down Mr. Sachs’s petition to have the posters returned, but on Tuesday a court was unconvinced by the government’s argument that Mr. Sachs had voluntarily given up the posters when he fled the country."

But the significance of that achievement may obscure another, easily overlooked first: a native of Hawaii will take residence in the White House. (Aloha!) Hawaii, which joined the Union only in 1959, had a relatively short Oval-Office-less streak. As the chart below shows, states have had to wait more than 70 years, on average, before one of their own ran for president or vice president on a major party ticket. (In the early days, some parties that might now be considered minor, were major by our standard. Also, we included those candidates born in or representing a particular state.)"

The lawyer, Barry L. Hirsch, had represented Mr. Higgins until his death in 1988. But the trust ended its dealings with Mr. Hirsch after learning he was also representing Patricia Resnick, the other screenwriter of the movie, and the author of the book for “9 to 5: The Musical.” The lawsuit says that Mr. Hirsch failed to secure Mr. Higgins’s stage rights for the musical project, and seeks damages for legal malpractice and breach of fiduciary duty.

Mr. Mortier’s short stay with City Opera was clouded by the revelation that he was also seeking the directorship of the Bayreuth Festival in Germany. He later quit the New York job, saying he had been promised an operating budget of $60 million, but was given only $36 million by the opera’s board. Previous City Opera budgets have been around $42 million. “I accepted the sacrifices, but there are limits,” Mr. Mortier said in Le Monde. “This opera must innovate to exist alongside the Metropolitan Opera. Today, I fear it disappears.” Mr. Mortier also said in the interview that he had been offered a position at Berlin’s Staatsoper Unter den Linden, but that working alongside its current musical director, Daniel Barenboim, would be like “two tigers on the same mountain.”"

Across the hall, a special-education teacher who took me under her wing in those treacherous first months spoke about her years tending bar in Honolulu, Austin, Tex., and Brooklyn. Handling her unruly class at a cool remove, she lamented how much less she earned educating minds instead of plying them with drink.Popular culture has generally represented teachers as idealistic teetotalers, probably because it wants to see them that way. While TV series like ""The Wire"" and ""Rescue Me"" are awash in images of cops and firemen replenishing their bruised machismo with an endless procession of beers and shots, teachers must make do with sanitized schmaltz like reruns of ""Welcome Back, Kotter"" and its even cornier offspring, ""Saved By the Bell."" Maybe it's simply because the notion of a teacher cozying up to a bottle of pinot noir and a stack of ""Animal Farm"" essays isn't terribly romantic.

There is the story that gets reported, and another parallel story, which for reasons of time, space and the vagaries of the scene, doesn't get reported. It would have been impossible to write about Michelle Obama's swearing-in outfit on deadline without staying close to a telephone, a BlackBerry and a computer. Given the security between the White House and the Capitol, and of course the throngs of people, her Toledo coat and dress would have seemed a speck of yellow from the mall. So I spent the day at a friend's house in my sweat pants and Uggs watching the television with a Basset hound named Rembrandt. I'd been in touch with Mrs. Obama's press secretary by phone, and on Tuesday morning as the Obamas were leaving Blair House, I got an email saying that the yellow dress was designed by Toledo. And that's when Toledo learned her outfit would go down in the history books-when she saw Mrs. Obama on television. Almost 12 hours later, Jason Wu, who designed her ivory chiffon ball gown, learned his information the same way. I was on the phone with Toledo a few minutes later. I was on the phone with Wu around 11 p.m., after I'd been to the Commander in Chief ball to see Mrs. Obama in the chiffon dress. Of course, since Ikram Goldman, the owner of the Chicago boutique Ikram, had helped Mrs. Obama and dealt directly with the designers-they had no contact, they told me, with the first lady-it was easy to form a short list of possible designers who might be involved in her inaugural wardrobe."

Edgar Hoover, according to F.B.I. records released by the comedian’s family and reported by The Associated Press. Among the documents that Carlin obtained through a Freedom of Information Act request before his death in June was an F.B.I. memo that noted his 1969 appearance on “The Jackie Gleason Show,” when he lampooned Hoover and the F.B.I. “His treatment was in very poor taste and it was obvious that he was using the prestige of the bureau and Mr. Hoover to enhance his performance,” the memo said, according to The A.P. The F.B.I. previously told The A.P. that it had no file on Carlin; an FBI spokeswoman told The A.P. she was looking into the apparent contradiction."

A judge in Los Angeles gave preliminary approval to a $2.57 million settlement in a suit brought against Fox and the production company Rocket Science Laboratories, and a $1.54 million settlement in a suit against ABC, CBS and other production companies."

2009-01-22T10:56:07Z,"A year after Britney Spears lost custody of her children and conservatorship of her career was given to her father, a parents’ organization is suggesting that she may not be the best role model for impressionable children. The Parents Television Council, a Los Angeles-based advocacy group, is asking radio stations not to play Ms. Spears’s single “If U Seek Amy,” saying it would violate broadcast standards if played between 6 a.m. and 10 p.m, Billboard reported. The council said that the title of the song, from Ms. Spears’s album “Circus,” sounded like an obscene phrase when said quickly. “It’s one thing for a song with these lyrics to be included on a CD so that fans who wish to hear it can do so, but it’s an entirely different matter when this song is played over the publicly-owned airwaves,” said the council’s president, Tim Winter, according to Billboard."
2009-01-22T18:12:22Z,"An independent publisher said it had completed an agreement to publish a novel tentatively titled “The Apple,” based on a movie screenplay that was, in turn, adapted from Herman Rosenblat’s falsified Holocaust memoir, “Angel at the Fence.” In December, the Berkley Books division of Penguin Books canceled the publication of Mr. Rosenblat’s memoir, in which he wrote that he met his future wife, Roma, while he was a prisoner of a German concentration camp during the Holocaust. Several scholars pointed out that details of Mr. Rosenblat’s story, including his claim that Mrs. Rosenblat would throw him apples over the camp’s fence from outside, could not have been true. Film rights for the memoir were sold to Atlantic Overseas Pictures, which commissioned a script. York House Press, a publisher based in White Plains, said it struck a deal with Atlantic Overseas Pictures to release a novel adapted from that script. In a release, York House Press said, “We will publish what has become one of the most controversial love stories of all time as fiction based on true events. Besides the love story, many people want to hear the story behind the story: why Mr. Rosenblat constructed and told his tale as he did. This will be included in the book.” A publication date for the book was not announced."

Last year, the Bush administration, breaking with precedent, denied California the right to establish its own standards in the absence of any federal mandates. Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger, in his own separate letter to President Obama, urged him to direct the E.P.A. “to act promptly and favorably” on the request."
2009-01-22T00:00:00Z,"The source of a salmonella outbreak that sickened almost 500 people around the country and is linked to six deaths is a peanut processing plant in Blakely, Ga., health officials confirmed.

2009-01-22T00:00:00Z,"Two women whose sexual harassment complaints led to the resignation of an Ohio attorney general have reached a settlement with the state, officials said. The women, Cindy Stankoski and Vanessa Stout, will each receive $247,500 for reparations and lawyers fees. They filed sexual harassment claims against Anthony Gutierrez, a top aide to former Attorney General Marc Dann, above, early last year. Mr. Gutierrez was fired, and the scandal led to Mr. Dann’s resignation in May. Mr. Dann, a Democrat elected in 2006 on an anticorruption platform, admitted he had had an extramarital affair with an employee. A report by state investigators alleged that he ran a vulgar and unprofessional office and misused campaign money to make lavish payments to friends and family members. Attorney General Richard Cordray, a Democrat who took office earlier this month, praised the women’s courage. Mr. Dann said in an e-mailed statement, “While I am sympathetic to the challenges that these women faced, in my view the facts do not support a payout of this magnitude.”."

In the letter Judge Clemon said he was “ecstatic” over Mr. Obama’s victory, which he called the fulfillment of a lifelong dream to see an African-American president. Judge Clemon a former civil rights lawyer and state senator, wrote that it became clear to him last spring “that Almighty God had ordained” Mr. Obama “as the next president of this great nation.” The judge, 65, said he would join a Birmingham law firm on Feb. 1. He announced plans to retire in the fall, but decided to time his departure to coincide with Mr. Obama’s inauguration, guaranteeing that a Democratic president would appoint his successor. Mr. Clemon was appointed by President Jimmy Carter in 1980."

2009-01-22T00:00:00Z,"LaCAILLE--Joan. Managing Director of Warburg Realty, died suddenly at her home in New York City on January 9, of an undiagnosed disease. Born Joan Kelleher in Worchester, Massachusetts March 5, 1928, Joan was the daughter of Mrs. and Mrs. William Kelleher. She was an alumnus of the Baldwin School and Sarah Lawrence. She lived the kind of life of which most people only dream. Shortly after marrying Charles Wilson LaCaille of Montreal, Canada, the couple set sail for Africa. As Joan delighted in telling the story, they sailed on a trans-steamer, the trip took six weeks, and the only other guests aboard were nuns who had taken a vow of silence. Her husband died in Africa, but Joan stayed on for six more years, during which time she nurtured her love of animals, especially giraffes, on whose behalf she worked until the end of her life. When she returned to New York, Joan began a storied career first in public relations and then in real estate, becoming one of the foremost women in that field. There was no one more enthusiastic, more full of adventure, more energetic, and more generous than Joan. She loved to travel, visiting Dubai, Kenya, Russia, Sri Lanka, China, Iran, and Libya in recent years. This past November she made her last trip to Kenya, to her beloved Giraffe Manor, where she got to release her giraffe, named ''Joan'', into the wild. While always sensitive to the diverse cultures and peoples she encountered, she never fully could stop ''being Joan.'' Visiting Iran when she was 76 years old, she had no hesitation wearing a full hajib. However, when she left Tehran to spend several days in the countryside, she carried her flask of scotch underneath it, to assure her daily afternoon cocktail. A founding and tireless member of the board of directors of Puppies Behind Bars, Joan not only delighted in visiting the program in prison, but decided to spend her 80th birthday there, surrounded by her friends. Clearances secured and metal detectors passed through, Joan and her friends entered the Bedford Hills Correctional Facility for an afternoon with inmates and dogs and then she delighted, in the following months, telling everyone she met, ''I spent my 80th birthday in prison!'' A memorial service to celebrate Joan's life will be held in New York in February and a Joan LaCaille Memorial Fund has been started at Puppies Behind Bars. To contribute to the fund or for information on the service, contact Puppies Behind Bars (puppiesbehindbars.com) or 212-680-9562."

A tireless presence, Joan never passed up an opportunity to talk to anyone about Puppies Behind Bars. She loved the dogs we worked with, she loved that we work to rehabilitate prison inmates, she loved that we donate our dogs to people whose lives they can improve. Joan was one of the kindest people we knew always asking after anyone who was ill or going through an emotionally difficult time. She was energetic, vivacious, generous, and one of a kind. There is no way to fill the void that has been created by her death, but she will be remembered always through the Joan LaCaille Memorial Fund that has been established in her name.

This time the focus shifted to the dealer, Robert Hecht, who has been charged with Marion True, the ex-Getty curator, of conspiracy to traffic in antiquities looted from Italian soil. Both defendants deny the charges. A prosecution witness, the archaeologist Daniela Rizzo, presented documents and photographs of artifacts — an Apulian red-figured bowl decorated with a chariot, an ancient Greek candelabra — that prosecutors contend passed through Mr. Hecht’s hands. “We’d just love to know where some of them ended up,” Ms. Rizzo said pointedly while gazing at Mr. Hecht, 89, who was in court but did not take the stand. Alessandro Vannucci, his lawyer, said his client disputed the case made by prosecutors for the provenance of each object. Several objects sold by Mr. Hecht to institutions like the Getty and the Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York have been returned to Italy under pacts with the Italian government."

2009-01-23T18:18:48Z,"CBS News announced on Friday that “60 Minutes’’ had secured the first interview with Captain Chesley B. Sullenberger III, the pilot who successfully landed his U.S. Airways jet on the Hudson River, along with his crew. But word of the interview, to be conducted by Katie Couric, set off immediate recriminations at her former employer, the “Today’’ program on NBC. That’s because Matt Lauer of “Today’’ had received assurances from the captain’s family and other representatives last weekend that he would have the first interview with Mr. Sullenberger, which was to have been conducted live, on Jan. 19. Soon after NBC began publicizing that appearance, it was abruptly canceled, at the request of the Airline Pilots Association, which had expressed concern about its bearing on the ongoing investigation into the emergency landing. Asked in an interview on Friday why the captain had since decided to pass over “Today’’ for “60 Minutes,’’ a Sullenberger family spokesman, Alex Clemens, said, “The five members of the crew spoke with each other and made a joint decision of how they would like to proceed.’’ In a statement, NBC said, “What Captain Sullenberger did in the cockpit on Flight 1549 was heroic and admirable. Unfortunately, people close to him have not acted nearly as admirably.’’"

I do not pretend that it is a perfect solution -- Tim Ryan, the former head of the Office of Thrift Supervision, who helped manage the country through that crisis, pointed out to me that the banking system is a lot more complicated than it was then. He also made the point that the O.T.C. had a mandate, by law, to take over insolvent S&Ls, while these days we quake at the thought of having the government take over a bank.

At Louis Vuitton, Paul Helbers said he was going for clothing that, though luxurious, could be worn every day without calling attention to itself. Yves Saint Laurent's Stefano Pilati was inspired by hip-hop gear's shapes and volumes, but avoided unnecessary flash by using mostly black and keeping his silhouettes as graphic and unencumbered as possible. Stuart Vevers, now in his second season at Loewe, was pleased to focus on making leather goods ""with intrinsic value in their materials and design."" Dries van Noten hit the nail on the head with his understated, nearly monochromatic collection of basics. And Raf Simons showed a season-defining cavalcade of immaculate suits and coats, which went from business formal to experimental, thanks to mirror insets and neoprene sleeves. For now at least, gone are the days when practically anyone could dye an ostrich pelt purple and call it a luxe statement -- and that is certainly not a bad thing."

This morning, Junya Watanabe's patchwork jackets and jeans evoked hunting gear. I'm always a sucker for the clothing at Farmer's Supply, wondering what I could do with a snap-front brown cotton jacket or an orange utility vest. Now I know.

Dries Van Noten's collection, held last night at the Communist party headquarters, was a bit too frugal even for these times: too many one-color outfits and belted coats with an automaton cast. Yojhi's men looked sweetly frumpy - and drowsy - in pajamas and hooded bathrobe coats."

Two of the defenders played left fullback. ''It's a supply and demand issue,'' said Jeff Agoos, a former left fullback for the national team and the second-most capped player in team history. ''There's just not a lot of supply of left-sided players, not just in the U.S. but I think around the world.'' Most national teams play with some variation of the 4-4-2 formation, meaning there are more defensive positions to be filled than attacking spots, and two or three spots require a player to send long balls across the field with the left foot.

Dr. Myers is also survived by his son-in-law Harris Fishman, and three grandchildren: Wyatt, Charlotte and Sophie. Emeritus Clinical Professor of Psychiatry at Weill Cornell Medical College and a Training and Supervising Analyst at The Columbia University Center for Psychoanalytic Training and Research, Wayne Myers was a prolific contributor to his field. He published five books, including Shrink Dreams, a New York Times notable book in 1992; forty-eight book chapters and articles and nearly fifty reviews, commentaries and letters. His expertise included clinical process and technique, geriatrics and pioneer contributions to the intensive treatment of the aged, and studies in applied analysis and literature. He was an original and lucid thinker whose writings illuminated the clinical work of the residents and psychoanalytic candidates whom he taught and supervised. A superbly empathic and knowledgeable practitioner with a huge private practice, for many years he chaired Columbia's Admissions Service. Wayne Myers was born in New York on December 13, 1931 and graduated from The Bronx High School of Science. He went on to obtain a B.S. Phi Beta Kappa from the University of Arkansas in a mere two years before matriculating at Columbia University's College of Physicians and Surgeons, where he received his medical degree in 1956. His psychiatric residency at Cornell/New York Hospital was interrupted by service in Korea, where Captain Myers became at twenty-eight Battalion Commander of the Fifteenth Medical Battalion. After completing his training at The New York Psychoanalytic in 1969, he moved on to teach and supervise candidates at Columbia in 1977, where he remained a mainstay until his death. A private service was held for the family and close friends."

2009-01-23T00:00:00Z,"LUNAR NEW YEAR The passage of time is maddeningly subjective -- a minute in traffic is never quite like a minute in front of the television -- and that is perhaps one reason people endlessly seek to measure it. History is littered with calendars that didn't survive (remember the Calendrier républicain, anyone?). But one that was too entrenched, and entertaining, not to have endured is the Chinese calendar, a system adopted about 4,700 years ago in which the second new moon after the winter solstice ushers in a new year, a new animal and 15 days of celebrations."

2009-01-23T00:00:00Z,"AS holes go, the one off Interstate 40 a short drive from Flagstaff is a whopper. From a distance it's a mere blip on the horizon, its rim rising 150 feet above the flat scrubland that dominates much of northern Arizona. But that rim hides a yawning expanse -- more bowl than hole, really -- 4,100 feet across and 550 feet deep. If they played a football game in the bottom, the sides could hold two million fans, give or take a luxury box or two. But what really raises this hole above humdrum is how it was created. About 50,000 years ago, a 150-foot lump of iron and nickel, a renegade from the asteroid belt between Mars and Jupiter, sliced through the sky out of the northeast at seven miles per second. When it hit it tore up the landscape in an instant, excavating several hundred million tons of dirt and rock and flipping layers of sandstone like pancakes."
