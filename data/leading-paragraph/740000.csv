1890-09-20T00:00:00Z,"There is something very symptomatic in the campaign document just issued by the Republican Congressional Committee and described in one of our Washington dispatches.

She was crying pitifully over and over again, ""I want to die."""
1890-09-20T00:00:00Z,"LONDON, Sept. 19. -- The arrest of Irish leaders yesterday fills a conspicuous place in the newspapers throughout the United Kingdom this morning. Various explanations are surmised to account for Mr. Balfour's sudden stroke. The commonest one on the part of the Liberal press is that its object was to prevent Messrs. Dillon and O'Brien from going to America to arouse American sympathy and solicit American aid."

1890-09-20T00:00:00Z,"There was good racing at Brooklyn yesterday. There were no stakes to be run for, but there were good fields in every race and some very close finishes, too close to satisfy the speculators in some instances. This was notably the case in the first race, in which Taylor landed the Maxim colt a winner by a head from Syracuse, the latter heating the Lady Jane colt by the same scant distance."

This is not due to any specific charges of corruption or mismanagement, but a feeling that a useful inquiry could be made which took shape some time since in an invitation to Mayor Hart to visit other cities with a committee of citizens."
1890-09-20T00:00:00Z,"RONDOUT, N.Y., Sept. 19. -- The downpour of rain which has been continuous for about ten days in the Hudson River Valley has, with the aid of a hot September sun, ripened much of the Concord grapes which painstaking fruitmen have said would not ripen this season.

The estate is small."
1890-09-20T00:00:00Z,"CHICAGO, Sept. 19. -- The Chicago race meet was inaugurated to-day at the new quarter-mile track at Parkside. The curves of the track are so small that the Western men had a decided advantage over their Eastern competitors. The day was cold and windy and prevented fast time. The summary of events is as follows:"

1890-09-21T00:00:00Z,"NEW-HAVEN, Conn., Sept. 20. -- If Harvard is to defeat Yale at football this is certainly the year. Harvard, with practically her last year's team, can devote her time almost wholly to the development of team play and learning new tricks, which to a team that has played together one season will be a decided advantage."
1890-09-21T00:00:00Z,"Heinrich Zoellner, the newly-engaged musical leader of the German Liederkranz, was given a formal reception last evening at the clubhouse in East Fifty-eighth street.

Odlin, full-back, are the only men on last year's team who are not back this year."
1890-09-21T00:00:00Z,"MARIA THERESA AND CATHERINE OF RUSSIA. -- The amount of esteem and admiration awarded by M. de Linge to the two sovereigns was equal, but its form and its nuances differed widely. For Marie Therese he professed a tenderly respectful sentiment, recognizing in her an almost magic power of attraction, far beyond anything her great rival had ever exercised."
1890-09-21T00:00:00Z,"Astonishment was the portion of William Stitt yesterday. He was arrested in a restaurant down town, and when he wanted to know on what authority the arrest was made he was shown a commitment for contempt of court issued four years ago.

1890-09-21T00:00:00Z,"It seems that the Count of PARIS has not abandoned his visit to this country, but yesterday held a conference with ""a number of his leading adherents"" at Folkestone. It was announced a few weeks since that the unpleasant feeling aroused by the McKinley bill was such that he thought best not to come, as any royal or would-be royal person might refrain from visiting a country at war with his own."
1890-09-21T00:00:00Z,"Everybody knows that the Autumnal demand for money to move cotton and corn is aggravated by the position of the United States Treasury in our finances, yet neither statesmen nor business men have intelligence enough to insist upon the only remedy -- the abolition of the sub-Treasury system."

1890-09-21T00:00:00Z,"NEWPORT, R.I., Sept. 20. -- Newport has settled down into the quiet of its Autumn life. The cottagers are still here. Hardly half a dozen have left for their Winter homes. Their handsome equipages are seen on the avenue and other fashionable thoroughfares in as large numbers and as great splendor as at the height of the season, but socially the season is dead."
1890-09-21T00:00:00Z,"PHILADELPHIA, Sept. 20. -- Brakeman Michael Gillen, who was stationed in the middle of the train which was wrecked, arrived in this city this afternoon, but little the worse for his terrible experience.

1890-09-21T00:00:00Z,"SHAKESPEARE'S GHOSTS. -- We cannot doubt that Shakespeare, like his contemporaries, believed in ghosts, while we do not. How, then, can we say that he is true to nature, when he makes Hamlet or Brutus or Macbeth see ghosts, talk with them, and thereby in all respects believe in them? Skeptical arguments against the reality of ghosts were not unknown to Shakespeare's contemporaries."
1890-09-21T00:00:00Z,"Mr. Augustin Daly returned from England last night on the Umbria. He was accompanied by Mrs. Daly and Miss Ada Rehan. Mr. Daly is in excellent health. He has gained materially in weight and his complexion has a ruddy glow, which is quite foreign to its general appearance."

It seems that these observers mistook the symptoms."

1890-09-21T00:00:00Z,"There is a very comic dispatch touching the behavior of the Grenadier Guards at Bermuda. It will be remembered that this particular petal of the flower of the British Army was exiled to Bermuda because it had become intolerable in London. The ""Horse Guards,"" that is, the headquarters of the British Army, is not commonly supposed to contain a very imposing amount either of military science or of common sense."
1890-09-21T00:00:00Z,"THE LAUREATESHIP. -- Lord Tennyson is still with us. It would be as impertinent as ill-omened to say any word of one's own notion, save to wish that he may stay with us as long as possible. But he has himself spoken in words which, if words have any meaning, are in the nature of a solemn farewell."
1890-09-21T00:00:00Z,"The feature Of Fall millinery showing the most enterprising effort after novelty is seen in the department of felt hats.

1890-09-21T00:00:00Z,"WASHINGTON, Sept. 20. -- Partisans are always suspicious, and that may account for the comment made by some observant persons, Democrats, of course, that Mr. John S. Clarkson and Mr. W.W. Dudley of the Republican National Committee are both hovering about the conferrees of the House and the Senate on the Tariff bill as if they were greatly interested in the outcome of the deliberations of those gentlemen."
1890-09-21T00:00:00Z,"Every one has been talking for the last week about Hugh McLaughlin's frank statement that he would rather see the entire local Democratic ticket beaten than recognize the German Democratic General Committee.

The dates arranged for the County Conventions -- Oct. 2 for the Republicans and Oct. 10 for Tammany -- indicate that the Republican leaders have left plenty of time for adjournment, and that Tammany thinks that the opposition will have shown its hand by Oct. 10."

1890-09-21T00:00:00Z,"LENOX, Mass., Sept. 20. -- This has been another gay week. The tennis tournament, dinner parties, the assembly balls, the Stokes dancing party, the meeting of the archery club, and other entertainments have completely occupied the time of the cottagers every day and evening since Monday. The weather has been the worst possible, as it rained every day up to Thursday, so that driving through the country was next to impossible."

Mr. KENNEDY'S observations on the moral character of Senator QUAY were at once congenial and shocking to many of his fellow-Republicans.

They won that proud title by defeating the Columbia Athletic Club team on the Polo Grounds yesterday. The Columbia boys are from Washington, and they came here fully confident of defeating the New-Jersey boys.

1890-09-22T00:00:00Z,"The confession of the wretches who have been arrested for wrecking trains upon the New-York Central Roads establishes an extensive and appalling conspiracy.

1890-09-24T00:00:00Z,"DES MOINES, Iowa, Sept. 23. -- The politicians of the Republican Party in the West are complaining that the Farmers' Alliance is making a strange variety of demands. This is unquestionably true, but their very strangeness is evidence of the sore pressure and necessity that lie behind them. One demand most criticised is that the Federal Government shall warehouse farm products and issue certificates against them, to be used as currency."

1890-09-24T00:00:00Z,"The meeting of the Democratic State Committee in this city and the dedication of the Thomas Jefferson Building in Brooklyn yesterday afforded occasion for a good deal of declaiming upon Democratic doctrine and still more arraigning of the Republican Party. There was considerable justice in the arraignment, but it was accompanied by so much partisan fustian as to be in a great degree deprived of effect."
1890-09-24T00:00:00Z,""" All the Comforts of Home,"" now drawing crowded houses at Proctor's Theatre, is a delightful exaggeration of those household episodes which not infrequently make home everything but the haven it should be.

1890-09-24T00:00:00Z,"ST. LOUIS, Sept. 23. -- The Republican Convention of the Ninth Congressional District was held to-day, and the outcome is very much in the nature of a political sensation from the fact that it retires Nathan Frank to private life.

1890-09-24T00:00:00Z,"There have been outbreaks of prudery from time to time in various villages upon this continent that have excited the wonder of intelligent foreigners, and indeed of intelligent natives.

Line was docked yesterday afternoon at 4-o'clock, and the first passenger to land from her was William Walter Phelps, United States Minister at Berlin.

1890-09-24T00:00:00Z,How can the Republican leaders any longer deceive their partisan followers as to the real relation existing between their party organization and the Sugar Trust? We might fill columns of THE TIMES with extracts from Republican journals in which this Trust has been described and denounced as a Democratic concern. That has been the cry of some of them for more than two years.

1890-09-24T00:00:00Z,"The industrial schools of the Children's Aid Society long since ceased to be an experiment. The wisdom of their founder and their extreme usefulness in a city like New-York have been demonstrated by the success they have achieved, and by the character of the children whose wants they have relieved and who have been trained and partially educated under their auspices."
1890-09-24T00:00:00Z,"BERLIN, Sept. 23. -- The post-mortem examination of the body of Marie Hock, the actress, who died Sunday, revealed the fact that death was not due to poison, but was probably hastened by the powder given to her."

In this case the Grand Jury returned no bill."
1890-09-24T00:00:00Z,"The recent publishing relations between England and the United States are more intimate than ever.

1890-09-24T00:00:00Z,"INDIANAPOLIS, Sept. 23. -- To the surprise of everybody the heterogeneous State Convention of Greenbackers, Union Labor, and Farmers' Alliance men held here to-day was a pretty successful one so far as numbers present and interest were concerned.

The outcome of the day was the organization of a new party with the comprehensive appellation of ""People's Party."""
1890-09-24T00:00:00Z,"The abandonment of some of the old coins is a good step to take in preparation for the proposed introduction of new designs. The Senate has just concurred in the House bill to discontinue the coinage of the one-dollar and three-dollar gold pieces and the three-cent nickel piece, so that it will soon be a law. A sufficient objection to the latter two coins is that they do not conform to our decimal system."

1890-09-25T00:00:00Z,"WEEDSPORT, N.Y., Sept. 24. -- But few people went to the fair grounds to-day, and it is doubtful if at any one time there were over twelve hundred on the grounds. Of these not more than three or four hundred, probably not four hundred, went near the stand where Everett P. Wheeler of New-York and Major Pangborn of New-Jersey discussed the tariff issue."
1890-09-25T00:00:00Z,"Only five non-commissioned officers apparently are to present themselves this year for final examination at Fortress Monroe, after having passed their department examinations for appointment to the grade of Second Lieutenant.

1890-09-25T00:00:00Z,"As was pointed out in THE TIMES yesterday morning, the cablegram announcing the departure of the cruiser Baltimore from Stockholm for this country was a mistake.

1890-09-25T00:00:00Z,"It will be generally conceded that President CLEVELAND'S tariff message was the greatest of all the public services he was able to render. This ought to be conceded quite independently of one's opinions upon the merits of protection or the need of revenue reform. It ought to be conceded by men who believe in high protection, not ""for revenue only,"" nor even from partisanship because it is a part of the Republican creed."
1890-09-25T00:00:00Z,"ALBANY, Sept. 24. -- Attorney General Tabor, on behalf of Warden Brush of Sing Sing Prison, has been served with notice to show cause before the United States Supreme Court at Washington Oct. 14 why the decision of Judge Lacombe of the United States Circuit Court, denying the petition of Shibaya Jugiro, who is in Sing Sing Prison awaiting execution by electricity, for a writ of habeas corpus, should not be corrected."

The entries and weights for the several races are as follows:"
1890-09-25T00:00:00Z,"The taunt of Speaker REED in his Philadelphia speech that while the Republicans have been pushing their measures through the House of Representatives the Democrats have stuck to their seats ""as peacefully as so many lambs"" has reminded the latter that for eight months before the Venable-Langston contested election case came up it was in their power to break a quorum and block the partisan designs of REED and his supporters any day."
1890-09-25T00:00:00Z,"Although the full consequences of the competitive trial at Annapolis may not yet be apparent, its more important effects are already beyond doubt.

1890-09-25T00:00:00Z,"Neither in the North nor in the West has the Farmers' Alliance made the brilliant conquest that it has in the South. In the Eastern and Middle States it has done scarcely more than establish outposts. In Connecticut, however, it has made headway, and in Vermont, too, its hand is visible; in fact, it took part in the recent campaign, and worked to such purpose that two of its candidates were elected to the Legislature."

It is so changed from the House measure that it will have to be considered again by that body, and there is, therefore, little chance that it will become a law this year."
1890-09-25T00:00:00Z,"In the month of June last, what the London Times calls ""the greatest engineering achievement which English enterprise and skill have as yet attempted on the banks of the Nile,"" was quietly brought to a successful termination ""No flourish of trumpets heralded the event"" says that journal, ""and it may be doubted whether the general public have any but the vaguest possible idea of what has been accomplished."
1890-09-25T00:00:00Z,"WASHINGTON, Sept. 24. -- Representative Kennedy of Ohio was subjected to ensure by the House to-day for abusing Quay and the Senate, and he took it with something like the pride manifested by Mr. Bynum of Indiana when he was more formally criticised for a much less serious offense."

1890-09-25T00:00:00Z,"A ridiculous indorsement of the ridiculous Republican straight-ticket scheme was given at the Federal Club last night. It can not be fairly called a meeting of the club. There were not more than twenty-two members present at any time, and there are 150 in the club. The tabled resolution demanding a straight ticket inspired by eccentric Col. E.F. Shepard was called up for discussion as soon as President Charles L. Bidwell took the chair."

At the present time there is a revolt in the Republican ranks, and, looking at it in the best possible light, it means defeat for the party which has hitherto dominated Nebraska politics."
1890-09-25T00:00:00Z,"WORCESTER, Mass., Sept. 24. -- There was one noticeable thing about the second concert of the music festival, which took place this afternoon. That feature was the disposition of the audience. The concert was much below the average symphony concert as known in Boston and New-York. Yet it was too good for the audience. The solo numbers alone interested the large assembly which gathered in Mechanics' Hail."

Patton is preparing for an aggressive campaign, and in a few days more an army of orators will be denouncing King Alcohol all over the Commonwealth."
1890-09-27T00:00:00Z,"BINGHAMTON, N.Y., Sept. 26. -- The Hon. Milton Delano, Congressman from this district, sends an open letter to the Republican positively declining to be a candidate for re-election, on the ground that he cannot afford another term in Washington. The letter is in reply to a petition of many old soldiers of his district asking him to accept a renomination. He has been Chairman of the Pension Committee in the Fifty-first Congress."
1890-09-27T00:00:00Z,"The people of Halifax are probably justified in the inference they draw as to the good condition of the defenses of their city, shown during the simulated attack upon it by the fleet of Vice Admiral WATSON. It is true that this fleet was such as would hardly be sent into the harbor to run the gantlet of its batteries, torpedo craft, and mines in actual war."
1890-09-27T00:00:00Z,"MELBOURNE, Sept. 26. -- The strike of the wool shearers is not general. The squatters are suing their work people for breaking their agreement."

Robbins, Jack Hills, John Woodruff, and Frank Kelley, who are accompanied by a couple of the most expert lassoers in the country. Their object is not to slaughter the herd, but to lasso them and take them alive to Laramie. The herd has been seen by several different parties during the past year, and its haunts are pretty well known."
1890-09-28T00:00:00Z,"PARIS, Sept. 14. -- Paris is having such delicious scandals every morning coming from the Boulanger case that the shooting month of September is entirely lacking in its usual city dullness. The regular highlife Jenkins pictures this annual chateau sojourn as a sort of permanent seductive paradise of folly and pleasure, with bird-killing as a mere luxurious incident, since every one knows that it is far cheaper to buy a partridge than to bag it."

1890-09-28T00:00:00Z,"There is some honest difference of opinion about the merit of the acting of Mrs. E.A. Eberle in the part of Hesbiah in Mr. Bernard's play tried at the Twenty-third Street Theatre last Thursday. ""I've seen hard-working, narrow-minded women on farms who looked and talked just as she does,"" said one spectator after the performance."
1890-09-28T00:00:00Z,"BUFFALO, Sept. 27. -- It is whispered that the Democratic Congressional Committee, under the leadership of Congressman Wiley, will make great efforts to retain the Thirty-third' New York District in the Democratic column, and neither expense nor pains to that end will be spared. The district is not too strongly Republican, and factional differences may be as disastrous this year as they were two years ago."
1890-09-28T00:00:00Z,"MILWAUKEE, Sept. 27. - Weary of deceit, the Rev. A.M. De Ford, the Methodist minister from Hortonville, to-day confessed his crime of attempting to pass bad money and signified his intention of pleading guilty to the charge. He story is calculated to excite pity. Two years ago he came to Milwaukee and bought some second-hand books. In one he found a twenty-dollar bill which proved to be a one-dollar bill."
1890-09-28T00:00:00Z,"THE APPLE. -- The virtues of the apple as a fruit have been celebrated from time immemorial, and few fruits have so many legends associated with them. The garden of the Hesperides was the garden of the golden apple, just as our Avalon is the Isle of Apples. ""Of all fruits,"" it has been written, ""the apple seems to have had the widest and most mystical history."
1890-09-28T00:00:00Z,"CHIVALRY. -- Chivalry must not be confounded with the feudalism out of which it emerged. It was an ideal, binding men together by common spiritual enthusiasms. We find the ground material of the chivalrous virtues in the Teutonic character. As described by Tacitus, the German races were distinguished for chastity, obedience to self-imposed laws, truth, loyalty, regard for honor more than gain, and a reverence for women amounting to idolatry."
1890-09-28T00:00:00Z,"A BUSINESS IN SNAKES. -- The number of deaths from snake bite in our great eastern dependency and the difficulty of coping with the matter have often been commented upon. It has also been pointed out that many unrecorded deaths in out-of-the-way places must occur, and thus add to the number of victims."
1890-09-28T00:00:00Z,"The friends of Mr. Joel Chandler Harris of Atlanta will grieve to know that his bright little boy, Linton, died in West End Sunday morning. He was just seven years old. The man who has written so tenderly of children, delighting old and young by the weird, touching myths of the Southern farms, has many sympathetic hearts in the hour when father and mother are bowed down."
1890-09-28T00:00:00Z,"Liverpool grain freights have been dull in New-York shipping markets lately, and for perhaps the last six weeks a majority of the steamship lines have been carrying grain, on occasions, free of charge or else purchasing coal as ballast for ports in the ""U.K. and Cont.,"" to use a technical term coined by shippers, otherwise expressing the ""United Kingdom and Continent."""

1890-09-28T00:00:00Z,"The public in general, and the public of the Northwest in particular, must be considerably fatigued by the action of the Senators and Representatives from that region on the Tariff bill. This fatigue will be increased by the declaration of some of them that they mean to vote against the bill as it has been reported from the conference committee."
1890-09-28T00:00:00Z,"The new Garden Theatre, at Madison Avenue and Twenty-seventh Street, one of the departments, in fact, of the Madison Square Garden enterprise, was thrown open to the public last night. It is a beautiful house. In its construction and appointments the architect and builder have shown themselves abreast with the times. Every modern improvement possible in theatre building is there."
1890-09-28T00:00:00Z,"Nothing could be more salutary in an educational way than the tariff debates throughout this State, which were brought about by the efforts of the Reform Club of this city.

1890-09-28T00:00:00Z,"It was a curious muddle altogether, so curious that the principal actor in it accepted the situation as it stood, having quite wit enough to perceive the utter inutility of making any effort to set the matter straight. This is how it really was:"

Betting was exceedingly brisk, and as the favorites won nearly all the races, the bookmakers did not have it all their own way. On the contrary they were hit heavily on the Chesapeake and Reporter victories."
1890-09-28T00:00:00Z,"The fog that now veils the field of local politics in uncertainty will be partially cleared away during this week. Many things will transpire that will put a different light on things that have already become public property, and by the end of the week the politicians will know pretty nearly what the fight is to be, and how and by whom it is to be made."
1890-09-28T00:00:00Z,"It is typical of our provincialism, and especially of the weakness of Americans resident abroad, that the Protestant Church of the Holy Trinity erected in Rome by Americans should have been designed by an Englishman, the mosaics supplied by an Italian, and the cartoons for the mosaics made by Burne Jones or London."

1890-09-28T00:00:00Z,"About the time cold weather comes on many of the workingmen of this city will feel the effects of the foolish and wicked ""brick boycott.""

1890-09-28T00:00:00Z,"WOODSTOCK, Ontario, Sept. 27. -- The case for the defense in the Birchall trial was continued this morning. Dr. Mearns, the first witness called, said he had heard the medical testimony given by three doctors for the Crown. He did not agree with Dr. Welford that rigor mortis would set in so soon as stated. It would take generally, he believed, from five to six hours in a healthy young man."

1890-09-28T00:00:00Z,"JOHN BULL AND THE GERMANS. -- It is difficult to discover the reason for our intense unpopularity in Germany, for the Germans themselves are unable to assign any tangible cause for it. We seem to reproduce in their minds the immortal Dr. Fell, for it is unquestionable that ""the reason why they cannot tell,"" or, if they could, they prefer not to do so."
1890-09-28T00:00:00Z,"THE PLAZZA DI NAVONA. -- The Piazza di Navona has its shops and palaces and florid churches at its four sides, marble seats set about it, statues here and there, and gigantic fountains dating from the time of the fifth Sixtus, whom Master Pasquin nicknamed Summus Fontifex instead of Summus Pontifex."

1890-09-28T00:00:00Z,"In retiring to private life Prince Bismarck has been able to read with his own eyes the things usually not printed about a man until he is dead.

1890-09-28T00:00:00Z,"DUBLIN, Sept. 27. -- There is no abatement of interest in the trial of the conspiracy cases against the Nationalist leaders now in progress at Tipperary.

1890-09-28T00:00:00Z,"The bank statement yesterday showed the almost unprecedented increase for one week of over $12,000,000 in the surplus reserve. It was due to the extraordinary Treasury disbursements. A large increase had been looked for, but nothing so large as this. The effect on the market should have been to stimulate prices. The actual result was that prices declined."
1890-09-28T00:00:00Z,"IN A FRENCH CHATEAU. -- There is usually plenty of gayety going on in the country places around Paris. Not so in the provincial chateaus, where the great families of the old aristocracy now spend a considerable portion of the year. The shooting season brings visitors and consequent animation for a short time; but the simplicity of the usual home-life would astonish English preconceived ideas."

1890-09-28T00:00:00Z,"CHICAGO, Sept. 27. -- It is hardly fair to assume that the taste of the Chicago public is for trashy dramatic performances, though the bills offered at the various theatres during the week just ended would seem to indicate such a condition of affairs, and the outlook for the coming week is no more promising. But one down-town theatre has presented an attraction which was conceived with any other purpose than to cause laughter."

1890-09-28T00:00:00Z,"KINGSTON, N.Y., Sept. 27. -- The people remaining in the Catskills who are so fortunate as to be domiciled in farmhouses and boarding houses where grate and stove fires can be lighted have enjoyed themselves during the past week. Althought nights and mornings have been cool, bright sunshine has been the rule, and the views in the clear air delightful."
1890-09-28T00:00:00Z,"A FEW HINTS FOR COLLECTORS. -- A few hints of a general character may be useful to the collector whose knowledge has not yet been bought in the market of practical experience.

1890-09-28T00:00:00Z,"LONGEVITY. -- When the French Ministry some twenty-five years ago, issued a circular to all its Prefets making inquiries as to the conditions most favorable to longevity, all the reports agreed in naming a well-to-do condition of life as most important, if not quite indispensable. It should also be borne in mind that the most wonderful cases of longevity are almost invariably reported from countries where verification of the asserted facts is impossible."

1890-09-28T00:00:00Z,"The conduct of the trial of the accused Nationalists at Tipperary confirms the explanation that suggested itself of their arrest. It is not to be supposed that Mr. BALFOUR or Lord SALISBURY had any personal malice against Messrs. DILLON and O'BRIEN. The arrests must have had their motive in some view of public policy, meaning party policy."

1890-09-28T00:00:00Z,"LAKEWOOD, Sept. 27. -- Lakewood claims, with some right to the distinction, to be the great Northern Winter resort, with as much emphasis on the adjective as is consistent with the proper deportment of one so young. Certainly Lakewood now has a much clearer title to being the foremost of similar resorts than it had when the claim was first set up, and which is visibly more proper now than it was a year ago."

January Pork opened at $11.60 and closed at $11.55. May opened and closed at $12.15: January Lard opened at $6.42 12 and closed at $6.40 @ $6.42 12: January Ribs opened at $5.60 @ $5.62 12 and closed there."
1890-09-28T00:00:00Z,"Examination of the bill passed by Congress allowing service in the civil war to count as double time in making up the thirty years required for the retirement of enlisted men shows that it applies only to the army and marine corps, instead of to the navy also, as the language of the earlier report had suggested."

Their arrival in this city Wednesday, reported in Thursday's TIMES, created no little stir in athletic circles, awakening a new interest in international competition."
1890-09-28T00:00:00Z,"The readers of Armand de Pontmartin, faithful readers of the Gazette de France, founded in 1631, who heard his voice, were surprised. It was weak, thin, shrill, a voice to sing to a clavichord painted by Boucher, a ""voix de vieille."" The mind behind it was vigorous and sure of itself, because it was a mind well trained which was loyal to its trainor."

Eaton of this city in the politics of the State is looked upon as a source of decided strength to the Democratic Party.

The steamer Cherokee was to sail for Fernandina, Fla., and the reports had it that a strike of her firemen delayed her departure for several hours. As a matter of fact, it was not much of a strike."
1890-10-05T00:00:00Z,"TRENTON, N.J., Oct. 4. -- Princeton College students had a night off in Trenton last night. At about midnight the police were informed that a party of young men in ulsters were tearing down business signs on State Street, and a squad of officers was sent out. The policemen soon returned with six young men, who gave their names as Piersall Humphrey, James L. Jones, George S. Tryson, James H. Dorr, J.T. Jenkins, Samuel Smith."
1890-10-05T00:00:00Z,"ELMIRA, N.Y., Oct. 4. -- The corrupt practices of Gov. Hill's lieutenants in political matters covering a period of several years past pale into insignificance when compared with the movement now on foot to steal every election district in this city. The Common Council, which, with the Mayor, numbers twelve Democrats and three Republicans, appointed inspectors of election for every district in the city regardless of any right of the minority."
1890-10-05T00:00:00Z,"NIAGARA FALLS, N.Y., Oct. 4. -- Niagara rejoices to-day over the commencement of the tunnel which, by the development of power that it will bring, will place her in a position to be rightly termed the ""Manchester of America."" The first sod was lifted at 10:42 o'clock this morning by C.B. Gaskill, President of the Niagara Power Company, the implement used being a nickel-plated shovel."
1890-10-05T00:00:00Z,"PAYMENT IN KIND. -- Richard de Betonye was the representative of the City of London in the Parliament held at York by King Edward III. in 1828 . Taking a fancy to a certain coverlet furred with maniver, valued at eight marks, which had come somewhat mysteriously into the possession of the City Fathers, he was allowed to take it in part payment of the expenses he had been put to in his parliamentary capacity."
1890-10-05T00:00:00Z,The Count of PARIS has shown good sense and good taste in separating his visit to this country absolutely from contemporary French politics. There are not wanting evidences to show that it would be possible to organize a more or less imposing French royalist demonstration in New-York if he would permit himself to be made the object of it.
1890-10-05T00:00:00Z,"THE STAGE IN SHAKESPEARE'S DAY. -- An Englishman visiting Venice about 1605 wrote in a letter from that city: ""I was at one of their playhouses, where I saw a comedy acted. The house is very beggarly and base in comparison with our stately playhouses in England; neither can the actors compare with us for apparel, shows, and music."""
1890-10-05T00:00:00Z,"MIDDLETOWN, Conn., Oct. 4. -- The Trinity football eleven came down here to-day evidently determined to beat Wesleyan or lay up all the team. Wesleyan won by a score of 12 to 5, after one of the roughest games ever played here."

The convention called for the purpose to meet in the Melrose Turn Hall, in Cortlandt Avenue, near One Hundred and Fiftieth Street, was called to order, with about twenty persons present, and Edward Healey was installed as Chairman."
1890-10-05T00:00:00Z,"The Chairman of the Republican State Central Committee of Maryland should be called upon to prove certain statements which appear in his address to the voters of his State. One of the most glaring misstatements which he makes is in reference to the bayonet bill, concerning which he says: ""It is claimed by some that it is a Force bill, substituting bayonet for popular will."
1890-10-05T00:00:00Z,"MIDDLETOWN, Conn., Oct. 4. -- The college year opened last Thursday with the largest attendance in the history of the institution. The Freshman Class numbers 78, and several have entered the upper classes, making the total number for the year about 250. The Faculty has, during the Summer, revised the entire course of study and made some important changes and additions."
1890-10-05T00:00:00Z,""" Nine people out of ten,"" said a well-informed real estate man yesterday, ""would probably be willing to bet off-hand that the most costly building in the city is below Chambers Street. The splendid improvements in down-town property within a few years quite justifies this popular impression. The most expensive building in the city -- excluding, of course, Federal and municipal buildings -- is the Central Park Apartment Company's property, known as the Navarro flats."
1890-10-05T00:00:00Z,"LONDON, Oct. 4. -- All other topics of public interest in the British Islands have been dwarfed by the news of how America, with characteristic energy, has set to work to raise money to fight famine in Ireland. Every one you meet talks about it and is moved by it in some way to wrath if he be an admirer of Mr. Balfour's, and to joy if he likes humanity better."
1890-10-05T00:00:00Z,"These are the days when, under cover of effusive greetings, every woman stealthily inspects every other woman's gown, seeking for ideas worth reproduction. In these stolen glances the sleeves are, this Autumn, the first noted, owing to the considerable measure of curiosity current as to whether they are to be a more or less conspicuous feature of the costume than heretofore."
1890-10-05T00:00:00Z,"A good many circulars are finding their way into public scrutiny nowadays from as many different sources, announcing new prices for various commodities that have for many years been without change. In all cases these ""new"" prices are synonymous with higher prices, and the inevitable reason that is assigned is the McKinley bill."
1890-10-05T00:00:00Z,"Some of the Tammany drillmasters who are engaged in training voters in the use of the ballot under the new law are telling them that if they cannot read and write they may swear that they are physically disabled from preparing their own ballots, and will then be allowed to take a friend into the compartment to do it for him."

The strength of the naval establishment is at present 10,000 men."
1890-10-05T00:00:00Z,"That our transatlantic kinsmen form a majority of the annual visitors to Stratford-on-Avon, to the birthplace and mausoleum of Burns, and other literary shrines in the old country, is a circumstance which should be recorded to their praise. Americans, it appears, are almost the only persons who think it worth while to visit, in still semi-rural Highgate, the last resting place of Samuel Taylor Coleridge."
1890-10-05T00:00:00Z,"THE TIRESOME DEBATE. -- People are fond of asking why nobody reads the debates now. The answer is simple. They have read them all before. And what is still more to the purpose is, that our Parliamentary orators have spoken them all before. The future is discounted as well as the past repeated by these hard-pressed disputants."

1890-10-05T00:00:00Z,"When Benjamin Harrison was a Senator from Indiana he lived at 1,013 Fifteenth Street and afterward at 825 Vermont Avenue. The first is a plain residence facing the stable belonging to Representative Hitt of Illinois and the second is an equally unpretentious brownstone boarding house opposite the Arlington Hotel."
1890-10-05T00:00:00Z,"M. Mermeix might as well cease writing his ""Coulisses du Boulangisme,"" but he has promised sixteen articles to the Figaro, and the end is not yet. He has succeeded in discrediting Boulanger and the Comte de Paris, and, so far as they are concerned, he is simply flogging a pair of dead horses, not to say asses."
1890-10-05T00:00:00Z,"PARIS, Oct. 4. -- The discussion which has been conducted by the newspapers here on the question of the admission of American pork into France is dying out in a measure, and that topic is now being replaced by general denunciations of the McKinley Tariff bill. The more important journals on the side of the Government seem still to be not unfriendly to the withdrawal of the decree of prohibition against American pork."
1890-10-05T00:00:00Z,"Montaigne was grateful that he lived in a century which was ""not soft, languishing, or unoccupied."" Erasmus was a prince in it, loved, envied, hated, condemed, with all the activity of that extraordinary epoch. A calm judgment of him then was not to be expected. There were no critics; there were only friends or enemies. M. Feugere counted in 1874 thirty-nine works before his own devoted to Erasmus."
1890-10-05T00:00:00Z,"During the past week the various classes have filled up, almost all the students having removed their conditions and re-entered their classes. The total number in the college at present is about 210, and the membership of the Stevens School is much larger than usual."
1890-10-05T00:00:00Z,"A week ago, in the face of an extraordinary bank statement, the market closed weak and drooping. The bear party said if it could not hold up when the evidence was presented that the money stringency was over, there was no help for it. But on Monday morning it was found that the market was oversold. This appeared from the active borrowing demand for stocks in the loan crowd."
1890-10-05T00:00:00Z,Mr. Klauser's book will be extremely interesting to all who have studied harmony and the theory of music. In some respects it is one of the most satisfactory works on the structure of music with which we have ever met. All students of the tone art are aware of the difficulties which surround the early steps along the path of harmony.
1890-10-05T00:00:00Z,"The writer of the series of essays in the North China Herald on ""The Natural History of the Chinese Girl,"" to which reference has already been made, has some interesting observations on divorce in china and its consequences to the wife.

1890-10-05T00:00:00Z,"THE JEWS AND THE BOOK. -- The Jews, perhaps exclusively among the early peoples, distinguished broadly between the matter and the corporeal form of a book, between its soul and its body. They alone conceived the idea of using the material form of the words and letters as an instrument for insuring the conservation of the contents."
1890-10-05T00:00:00Z,"HOW AN OCEAN CABLE IS MADE. -- Let us first see what a submarine cable is and how it is made.

1890-10-05T00:00:00Z,"BOSTON, Oct. 4. -- If the National Civil Service Reform League were the organization of a political party it would not be formidable. Its friends could not hope, its opponents need not fear, much from it. The league is composed of all the State and local associations, the members of which are invited to the annual meeting. In theory the votes are taken by associations -- one to each."

The frosts have painted the landscape earlier than usual this year, and the golden and red leaves of the forests on every hand seem, somehow, to have more of a charm than ever."
1890-10-05T00:00:00Z,"OTTAWA, Oct. 4. -- The political destiny of the Dominion continues to occupy the attention of the Canadian press. Since the Quebec Telegraph declared for annexation with the United States, Government newspapers are considerably agitated over the annexation spectre and declare that treasonable utterances should not be tolerated in a British colony. A controversy is now being waged from Halifax to Vancouver."
1890-10-05T00:00:00Z,"BERLIN, Oct. 4. -- The lapse of the anti-Socialist laws has led to a renewal of the discussion regarding Emperor William's attitude toward the Socialist question."
1890-10-05T00:00:00Z,""" ALL ENDS IN MIRE."" -- Rousseau was a compound of ""mysticism and sensuality""; no law was sacred to him but the gratification of instinct. He grafted every virtue upon a vice. He treated adultery as one of the fine arts, and abounded in theatrical sentiment while forwarding his children to the Foundling Hospital, duly as they arrived."
1890-10-05T00:00:00Z,"CAMBRIDGE, Mass., Oct. 4. -- Again this university town has awakened from the sleepiness of vacation time and Harvard has begun her two hundred and fifty-fifth year. Never were the prospects for a successful year in every way brighter. An increased number of students, increased corps of instructors, and increased facilities of all kinds make the outlook a most cheerful one."
1890-10-05T00:00:00Z,"So soon are men forgotten when dead that it seems proper here to recall the fact that the subject of this memoir was for fifteen years repeatedly in the public eye, here as well as in Great Britain, as an English clergyman under repeated prosecution for ritualistic practices. Mr. Mackonochie had become engaged in such an inevitably losing contest that the result was to be foreseen long before it came."
1890-10-05T00:00:00Z,"THE UNDERFED BRITISH SOLDIER. -- Recruits when they join the army first cannot be too well fed; because, coming as they do from a class which, as a rule, is irregular in its habits, after undergoing a regular system of drill and a regular manner of living, they are more hungry at meal times than they otherwise would be."
1890-10-05T00:00:00Z,"OHINEMOTU. -- Here are the first hot springs in New-Zealand, and wonderful things indeed they are. Waters bursting and boiling out of the bowels of the earth, throwing themselves in transport many feet into the air, and falling back to the ground in a shower of diamond drops that glint and glimmer against a dark and steamy pillar of fog."
1890-10-05T00:00:00Z,"The sterner sex is not commonly supposed to take much interest in the ""higher education"" of the softer. The reason of course is that the male of our species values the female as he finds her companionable and agreeable to himself, and it is very doubtful whether in most cases her attractiveness in this respect is increased with an increase of intellectual culture beyond a certain point."
1890-10-05T00:00:00Z,"A PERFECT GORGE -- ECCLESIASTICAL. -- A lavish entertainment was, according to quaint old Thomas Fuller in his ""Church History,"" provided in 1470 by ""George Nevill, brother of the great Earl of Warwick, at his installment into the Archbishopric of York."

Kenny, Supervisor of the City Record, was not being considered by the Tammany leaders as a possible candidate for County Clerk, to fill the vacancy left by the death of Edward F. Reilly. The theory that Tammany might put Mr. Kenny forth as their candidate was base on the excellent record that is claimed for Mr. Kenny as Supervisor."
1890-10-05T00:00:00Z,ADVICE TO WOMEN WHO STUDY ART IN PARIS. -- Whether the lady students of the present will develop later into being such excellent artists as their precursors have proved to be in the past is a moot question.

1890-10-05T00:00:00Z,"WHORLS. -- It is passing strange to find Dr. Schliemann's now celebrated ""whorls"" figured and described in an old treatise as the broutia, and ombria of old. The brontia fell with the thunder, and the ombria in tempest and rain without thunder: otherwise they were identical, and had all the properties of the toadstone, the belemnite, and the serpent's egg: parrying the thunder and neutralizing poison."
1890-10-05T00:00:00Z,"ALBANY, Oct. 4. -- State Entomologist Lintner recently received from a Gouverneur lady an interesting parasite on the common house fly. ""It is not uncommon to find half a dozen on a single fly,"" the sender writes. They are exceedingly small, being no larger than the puncture in a piece of paper by a small-sized pin point, yet they are seen readily because of their light vermilion color."
1890-10-05T00:00:00Z,"The sun is now hastening southward at highest speed through the sign of the Scorpion, as though anxious to get rid of so unpleasant a companion, a fact only too apparent as gradually-decreasing daylight and an increasing chilliness of the atmosphere tell us that we have the colder half of the year to pass through before we can again welcome him north of the equator."
1890-10-05T00:00:00Z,"CHAMELEONS. -- Chameleons of one species or another can generally be seen in the reptile house at the Zoo, it being a rare event for the society to be without one -- at the present time they have no less than eight.

1890-10-05T00:00:00Z,"FREEHOLD, N.J., Oct. 4. -- The indignation meeting held to-day to protest against the nomination of the Democratic county ticket without Ewing Patterson being on it for County Clerk was a dismal failure.

1890-10-05T00:00:00Z,"An ardent admirer of the United States is Sir Ambrose Shea, Governor of the Bahamas, who has passed the last few days in this city. Sir Ambrose is a typical Englishman -- tall, well proportioned, and wearing a look of health which amply supports his declaration that life in the Bahamas is very delightful. He is apparently about sixty years of age."
1890-10-05T00:00:00Z,"My attention having been called to an open letter addressed to the Press, under date of Oct. 1, by one of the late enumerators, allow me a few words in reply. Mr. Messenkope asserts that I must have lacked energy, as he, Mr. M., had accomplished his task in less than the given time.

1890-10-05T00:00:00Z,"The humane societies of this State have accomplished an incalculable amount of good in the past. and the community owes them a debt of gratitude. If their officers have occasionally been called to account by the press and public for the exhibition of a surplus of mistaken zeal in some directions, this fact in no way detracts from the merit of the general work of the societies."

His colt Tournament yesterday won for him at the Morris Park track the Hickory Stakes, for three-year-olds, which was the most valuable stake of the week, and worth $13,100 gross to the winner. The fact that the track was sloppy and just suited to this colt's action made the race practically a walk-over for him."

It is conceded that about 20,000,000 bushels will be required for seed and local consumption by farmers. Deducting this, there remain 70,000,000 bushels. The millers of Minneapolis are expected to consume about 30,000,000 bushels during the year, and this reduces the supply to 40,000,000 bushels."

1890-10-08T00:00:00Z,"The story told by the manager of Hammerstein's Opera House in Harlem is one that very intimately concerns the repute of the Fire Department in general and of Chief BONNER in particular. It seems clear that the manager has been persecuted, under a very thin pretext of enforcing precautions for the safety of his theatre."
1890-10-08T00:00:00Z,"WILMINGTON, Del., Oct. 7. -- With the campaign fairly under way, both parties confidently claiming victory, and the Prohibitionists running a cold-water side-show that may simply attract enough votes to turn the scales between the two leading contestants, the result of the coming election in Delaware is a matter of grave uncertainty that only the counting of the ballots can reveal."

It is evident that the fear that the ballot-reform law would deter voters from exercising the franchise is ill-founded."

1890-10-08T00:00:00Z,"The inefficiency of the Excise Department under the present methods was illustrated more forcibly than ever before the Senate Committee on Cities in Part II. of the Superior Court yesterday.

1890-10-08T00:00:00Z,"Two more steamers dame into port yesterday with their cargoes afire, as was the case with the Clyde liner Iroquois, which arrived last Friday. They were the Alamo of the Mallory Line, from Galveston, and the Ciudad Condal of the Spanish Transatlantic Line, from Havana."
1890-10-08T00:00:00Z,"The testimony of Commissioner KOCH before the investigating committee yesterday did not put the administration of the Excise Board in any more favorable light than the admissions of Mr. FITZPATRICK. He stated without reserve that the patronage of the department is distributed in the interest of Tammany Hall, not as a matter of duty or obligation, but rather as a ""matter of gratitude."""
1890-10-08T00:00:00Z,"MILLERSBURG, Ohio, Oct. 7. -- Mr. McKinley arrived this noon, opening his campaign in the Sixteenth District.

1890-10-08T00:00:00Z,"A new puzzle has been sprung upon the inoffensive people of this weary world. It is an innocent-looking affair, and an inexpensive one withal, but more deadly than ""pigs in the pen.""

1890-10-08T00:00:00Z,"ALBANY, Oct. 7. -- The nomination of Hamilton Fish, Jr., at Carmel yesterday means a great deal more than appears on the surface. It means, to begin with, that the anti-Platt members will hold the balance of power in the next Assembly if it is Republican, and they will be a small power in themselves if the Assembly happens to be closely Democratic, particularly in bills that require a two-thirds vote."
1890-10-08T00:00:00Z,"SYRACUSE, N.Y., Oct. 7. -- The Hon. J.J.

1890-10-09T00:00:00Z,"The report of Dr. MACDONALD to the Governor on the execution of KEMMLER is an impartial and instructive paper. There seems to be no doubt that KEMMLER was unconscious of pain within a very few seconds after the electric current was applied to his body, a very much shorter time than any man was ever killed in by hanging."
1890-10-09T00:00:00Z,"MOLINE, Ill., Oct. 8. -- The wedding of Miss Anna Deere, eldest daughter of Charles H. Deere, of Moline Ill., and William D.

1890-10-09T00:00:00Z,"The hearty praise accorded to the encampment of the National Guard of New-York at Peekskill this year is all the more gratifying from the fact that the inspecting officer, GEN.

1890-10-10T00:00:00Z,"COLUMBIA, S.C., Oct. 9. -- South Carolina is now without a straight political party.

1890-10-11T00:00:00Z,"Just what is going to be the result of the trouble between the Erie Railway system and its employes was not even suggested by anything that occurred yesterday. The forty-three engineers, firemen, conductors, brakemen, and switchmen forming the committee of the Federated Board of Erie Employes were as glum and sullen a looking lot of men after reading the ultimatum as could be imagined."

1890-10-11T00:00:00Z,"Congressman Walker's speech at the Massachusetts Club the other night was like one of those reversible garments which looks better ""the other side out."" This is peculiarly true of his peroration, in which he said: ""I believe that right-minded men were one-half exhausted and worn out, not by legislative work, but by the revolting and disloyal -- I had almost used a stronger word -- conduct of members of the Fifty-first Congress."
1890-10-11T00:00:00Z,"While the leaders of the People's Municipal League were a little in doubt Friday night as to who William H.

1890-10-12T00:00:00Z,"Some years ago two farmers of Polk County lost their wives by death. They naturally felt lonesome, and in due time began to think a second wife in each household would be a most excellent addition thereto. They were neighbors and friends, and each had a family of children, including one or more grown daughters. After careful consideration, each took the other's daughter as his second wife."

1890-10-12T00:00:00Z,"BALTIMORE, Oct. 11. -- The season has already begun and the fashionable quarters of the city have again assumed their accustomed appearance of life and activity. It is uncommon for society here to plunge into the excitement attendant upon dinners and luncheons immediately on returning from its outing, and a few weeks are usually passed in indolent repose and in reflecting over the gayeties which have lately been experienced at seaside and mountain resorts."

Robert Lenox Banks, President of the Lake George Association for the Protection of Fish and Game, says that not so much opposition is met with by the association in enforcing the laws as during the first years of its existence.

Influences are now at work, however, which are rending the party in twain, and it is quite likely that before election day there will be two candidates in both the First and Second Districts of the city."
1890-10-12T00:00:00Z,"PLAINFIELD, N.J., Oct. 11. -- Daniel Randolph, a Park Avenue farmer, found two young sportsmen gunning in his woods this morning, and ordered them off the premises.

A fight resulted, in which one of the trespassers struck him over the head with the butt of his gun and felled him senseless to the earth."
1890-10-12T00:00:00Z,"LONDON, Oct. 11. -- Yesterday the discovery that Mr. Dillon and Mr. O'Brien had quit the country created widespread interest which has rather increased than abated to-day.

The 2:20 pacers were well matched, and it was not till the seventh heat that the struggle was over.

1890-10-12T00:00:00Z,"Tournaments, those sham battles of the Middle Age, tempered with the pantomimicry of courtesy, the brutality of the chivalry.

He glorifies and idealizes the exploits of the elite of the handful of men who control the dangerous masses of Paris."
1890-10-12T00:00:00Z,There is nothing surprising in the present ferocious attempt to destroy a man so upright and so spotless as Mr. Grant.

The Rochester eleven was much lighter than Cornell's and could do nothing with the Cornell rush line. All their work was done by their half-backs. The Rochester men were not well posted on the rules and there were continued interruptions to discuss points."
1890-10-12T00:00:00Z,"There are several books upon Washington life and Washington etiquette which endeavor to lay down many rules, where, as a matter of fact, few, beyond those which obtain in society everywhere, exist; and the strenuous endeavors of certain newly-arrived officials to be polite according to rule are frequently the subject of ridicule.

1890-10-12T00:00:00Z,"WORK. -- One of the most decided and characteristic utterances on the subject of work is that of George Henry Lewes. It sounds like a veritable trumpet blast to summon young dreamers from a too long straying in flowery paths and moonlit groves. ""There is in the present day,"" he says, ""an overplus of raving about genius, and its prescriptive rights of vagabondage, its irresponsibility, and its insubordination to all the laws of common sense."

The new Tariff bill of the Republican Party has taxed nearly everything made in this country, and, what is strangest, nearly everything used in making ether things.

1890-10-12T00:00:00Z,"BERLIN, Oct. 11. -- The speech of Signor Crispi, the Italian Prime Minister, at Florence, is an indirect admission of the Figaro interview, which irritated Austria by showing too open anxiety for financial reasons to conciliate France.

1890-10-12T00:00:00Z,"M. Jules Simon makes an energetic appeal to his fellow-countrymen to put an end to the generally absurd, but sometimes tragic, custom of dueling.

1890-10-12T00:00:00Z,"The week has been one of weddings and suburban sports. Seldom in the social history of the city have there been six successive Autumn days so filled with events matrimonial.

1890-10-12T00:00:00Z,"Indications regarding a large proportion of the aboriginal inhabitants of what is the United States to-day seem to show that in the remote past the Indians had made their greatest advance toward semi-civilization. To lay down a general rule of this kind would be, however, presumptuous. There are many questions of vital importance of an ethnological character which are yet vague and undetermined."
1890-10-12T00:00:00Z,"ST. Louis, Oct. 11. -- President Harrison has come and gone, and the comment on every hand is that the reception was cold and utterly without enthusiasm. On every side are heard comments on the striking contrast between the welcome given Harrison and the grand greeting given Grover Cleveland when he came West."
1890-10-12T00:00:00Z,"LAKEWOOD, Oct. 11. -- The arrival of an unexpectedly large number of guests at the opening of the season last week gave strength to the previously-made prediction that Lakewood's growth and popularity as a Winter resort are neither ephemeral nor fleeting.

1890-10-12T00:00:00Z,"Twelve months have elapsed since the elections held in France in September, 1889, shattered the fabric of Boulangism. Still, people in general did not seam to have realized the hollowness of the sham until M. Mermeix took the public behind the scenes of the stage on which Boulanger has proved himself so poor an actor -- so poor, indeed, that he can find none so poor to do honor to his memory."
1890-10-12T00:00:00Z,"There are to be several fairs held in this city the coming Winter, all of them for worthy objects, and all of them with attractions of greater or less variety.

1890-10-12T00:00:00Z,"CHICAGO, Oct. 11. -- Theatrically the week has been one of interest and the various playhouses presenting new attractions have held overflowing audiences.

1890-10-12T00:00:00Z,"Twice the market has fallen and twice it has rallied the past week, and there is yet discouragement because the rallies are less than they should be after such liquidation. Monday was a low day, lower than the break on the previous Saturday. In the afternoon there was recovery, and it seemed that the worst was over, for the week at least."
1890-10-12T00:00:00Z,"The procession of vehicles on the East Drive of Central Park is a very marked contrast to what it was two month ago.

1890-10-12T00:00:00Z,"The best card of the meeting was presented at Morris Park yesterday -- a card in which every event promised close and exciting finishes and which contained a most attractive array of entries.

1890-10-17T00:00:00Z,"There is a certain naivete in the discussion upon religion at the congress of the Socialists in Halle. One delegate ""held that religion must he a private matter, especially when a combat against the Catholic Church was being carried on."" The orator seems to mean that it is so necessary the Catholic Church should be ""downed"" that the help of all persons, of any religion or of none, should be welcomed."

1890-10-19T00:00:00Z,"How far the patched-up peace in the Twenty-second Regiment troubles extends beneath the surface is the query which is just now of chief concern in military circles. The assurance that the differences which have divided the Board of Officers and proved the occasion of discord in the organization for close upon two years have been settled in a night, and permanently disposed of, is accepted with incredulity."
1890-10-19T00:00:00Z,"LONDON, Oct. 18. -- Now that the safe arrival in Paris of the two heroes of the escape from Ireland has allayed the growing anxiety of their friends and put a stop to the frenzied search of shipping by Mr. Balfour's police, it is time to inquire why Mr. Dillon and Mr O'Brien should have taken so violent a course of action as a flight implies."

The rain came down in torrents, blew all through the grand stand, and forced the men under cover in the betting ring for shelter, while the women huddled together in the inclosed rooms at the clubhouse.

The visiting iron and steel men from Great Britain are expected to pay this city a visit to-morrow, and preparations have been made to give them a fitting reception."
1890-10-25T00:00:00Z,"EAST PEPPERELL, Mass., Oct. 24. -- A big fire was discovered this morning at 2 o'clock in the shoe factory of Leighton Brothers, and soon the whole building was ablaze.

1890-10-26T00:00:00Z,"Will the police authorities consider the propriety of stationing an officer to protect the lives of those who have to pass across Printing House Square to the bridge?

Van Brockle is one of the best live-bird shots in the county."
1890-10-26T00:00:00Z,I have a friend who is a newspaper man and a bit of a cynic. I met him upon the steps of the Astor House one afternoon last week. He was in a discursive mood and the subject of his discourse was luck. Something has gone wrong with him and he was saying things about his luck that would not look well in print. He moralized thus:

1890-10-26T00:00:00Z,"The Storm which raged all Thursday and Friday was felt very seriously at sea, as was shown by the reports of incoming vessels yesterday.

1890-10-26T00:00:00Z,"A curious and interesting theory of the will, or rather of what is known as firmness of will, is that the man who has strength of mind and follows fixed plans that he has laid down for himself, and whom nothing but absolutely insurmountable obstacles can prevent from accomplishing them, is simply self-hypnotized."
1890-10-26T00:00:00Z,The results of the recent inquiry into the methods of the Tax Department should arrest the attention of all thoughtful minds. No element of city government has so important and direct an influence on the prosperity of a city and the lives and fortunes of citizens as taxes and their proper or improper imposition. In New-York City it affects primarily the pocket of from sixty-five to seventy-five thousand taxpayers.

1890-10-26T00:00:00Z,"DUELING IN FRANCE. -- Dueling is popular still but, if a death occurs in the contest the survivor and the seconds are obliged to fly the country for a time, for not only will magistrates punish, but juries will convict, and the civil courts are ready to award to the injured relatives crushing damages."

Among the pretty trifles light as air (unless weighed in the financial scale) offered under this, to the shopper, irresistible title are the filigree flowers of non-tarnishing silver wire.

1890-11-02T00:00:00Z,"BERLIN, Nov. 1. -- The commission on the tariff question, presided over by Herr von Boetticher, Minister of the Interior, has concluded its consideration of the proposed Austro-German customs union. The report of the commission has not been published pending the progress of negotiations with Austria, but its conclusions are known to disfavor both an extensive revision of the customs and combined action in the way of reprisals for the American and French tariffs."
1890-11-02T00:00:00Z,"Near the close of this volume the author says of his hero: ""Had he kept silence he would have been made a peer; they would have buried him in St. Paul's or Westminster Abbey and put a grand monument over his grave."" Charles Napier instead of a peerage got knighthood, and instead of a burial in the Abbey or St. Paul's was laid away in the garrison graveyard at Portsmouth."
1890-11-02T00:00:00Z,"For the present, at least, the curtain has been rung down on the Twenty-second Regiment troubles with the countermanding of the order for the disbandment of Company C, Capt. John G.R. Lilliendahl. There now remains the contention of Capt. John P. Leo to be disposed of, in the shape of a threatened suit for damages against the Adjutant General and the Commander in Chief."
1890-11-02T00:00:00Z,"At last the Amateur Athletic Union has taken steps to put an end to the practice of legalizing prize fights by having them under the protection of its rules. The Board of Managers has passed a rule to suspend men who engage in contests of more than four rounds. The Board of Managers could have gone further with this praiseworthy legislation, but this regulation will undoubtedly accomplish a great deal of good."
1890-11-02T00:00:00Z,"CAMBRIDGE, Mass., Nov. 1. -- The football games on Jarvis Field this afternoon resulted in a most decisive victory for Harvard. At the end of the game against Cornell, Harvard had scored 77 to Cornell's 0. Newell, Lake, and Dean of Harvard did some of the best work. It was dark when the game ended. Harvard's score was the highest of the year at Cambridge."
1890-11-02T00:00:00Z,"PHILADELPHIA, Nov. 1. -- The new steel cruiser Newark steamed up the Delaware to her moorings at Cramps', this afternoon, with colors flying and seemingly exultant over the satisfaction which she has given her contractors by the good record of her trip."
1890-11-02T00:00:00Z,"To the Dutchmen we have to look for the original of phantom-ship tales which form about the most familiar of sea legends. The famous phantom ship that remains off the Cape as the harbinger of wreck and woe is a Dutchman whose skipper dresses in yellow, wears a nightcap, smokes a short pipe, and is always kind enough to heave in sight when a vessel is going to founder or run ashore."
1890-11-02T00:00:00Z,"JEFFER'S LANDING, Nov. 1. -- The season for shooting deer, quail, rabbit, and pheasant began yesterday, and the hunters, with loaded cartridges and well-trained dogs, are ready for the sport. The game was never known to be so abundant as it is this season. The old sportsmen say that the woods throughout South Jersey are extraordinarily well filled with animal life."
1890-11-02T00:00:00Z,"At the banquet tendered Gen. Miles at the Auditorium a couple of weeks ago one of the speeches which rang in the ears of the auditors not only that night, but for days and days thereafter, was a little gem by Judge Gresham, which, by the kindness of a warm friend and admirer, was not permitted to perish like the other speeches of that evening. It is herewith presented in ""the art preservative"":"
1890-11-02T00:00:00Z,A public meeting of more than ordinary significance was held in the open air in Wall Street yesterday afternoon. For the first time in the history of this municipality an assemblage of people formed in front of the Sub-Treasury Building to listen to a discussion of matters pertaining to the City Government alone. It was one of the largest and most convincing of the many meetings held under the direction of the People's Municipal League.
1890-11-02T00:00:00Z,"PRINCETON, N.J., Nov. 1. -- The Freshmen this year have developed a very strong team, having received a large number of men who played on their preparatory school teams. They are quite anxious to play the Yale Freshmen. J. Poe, a brother of Capt. Poe of the 'Varsity, is playing a brilliant game at half back for the Freshmen, and will undoubtedly develop into a 'Varsity player."
1890-11-02T00:00:00Z,"ST. LOUIS, Nov. 1. -- Theresa Blennerhassett, a woman fifty years old and well known in St. Louis, a daughter of Richard S. Blennerhassett, deceased, formerly a prominent member of the bar and the descendant of the historic family of Blennerhassett, possessor of all the records and relics of the family, filed a petition in court today that revealed one of the most sensational stories that real life has ever contributed to romance."
1890-11-02T00:00:00Z,"RONDOUT, N.Y., Nov. 1. -- Several veterans of the war of the Rebellion were telling of their experiences here to-day. One related the following amusing incident:"
1890-11-02T00:00:00Z,"Under the restrictions which now hold the Board of Aldermen in check there is very little for the City Fathers to do, and what the Tammany boards have done for the last few years has been done in a slipshod and careless manner. The men who have been placed in nomination for Aldermanic honors this year are about of the same stamp as the men who have been nominated for the Assembly."
1890-11-02T00:00:00Z,"Many contestants and an assemblage of 10,000 interested and enthusiastic lookers-on, good sport and lots of it, music by the full Seventh Regiment Band, generous encouragement of participating athletes, and the heartiest imaginable rejoicing over each victory won -- these were some of the features of the international joint athletic meeting of the Manhattan Athletic Club of this city and the Salford Harriers of Manchester, England, held in Madison Square Garden last night."
1890-11-02T00:00:00Z,"Senator Justin S. Morrill since his re-election to the United States Senate has been the recipient of numerous congratulatory letters and telegrams from prominent Republicans and Democrats throughout the country.

1890-11-02T00:00:00Z,"WASHINGTON, Nov. 1. -- Secretary Noble has not yet ordered the Census Office to compare its figures, for the first five wards of New-York, with those of the police enumerators, which were brought to Washington by Supervisor Kenny last night. He had the opportunity to do so early to-day, but he is still giving the matter his ""careful consideration"" before deciding what to do."
1890-11-02T00:00:00Z,"NEWPORT, R.I., Nov. 1. -- The Newport Improvement Association has been this week engaged in circulating their petition to the City Council for the submission to the people of the proposition for the removal of the rails of the Street Railway Company from Bath Road to a new street to be laid out from Broadway along Easton's Pond to the bathing beach."
1890-11-02T00:00:00Z,"While this season's fabrics have been commented upon as showing remarkably fine effects in heavy grades, the lighter textures and richer, if no less weighty, materials, show such striking beauty of design and color as to elicit the most enthusiastic admiration."
1890-11-02T00:00:00Z,"The magnificent scores made by the gunners of the cruiser Philadelphia the other day when firing at a little target bobbing up and down on the waves and distant 1,000 yards from the ship is in strict keeping with the gunnery traditions of the American Navy. Out of 82 shots fired, 60 were lodged in a vertical line not over twenty feet in height."
1890-11-02T00:00:00Z,"CLEVELAND, Ohio, Nov. 1. -- A dispatch from Youngstown, Ohio, says: ""The announcement was made to-day that the leading iron manufacturing concerns in the Mahoning Valley have been sold to an English syndicate. Some time ago options were secured by a broker on the Warren Rolling Mill, Girard Rolling Mill, Youngstown Rolling Mill, Lowellville Furnace, Youngstown Steel Works, the Andrews Iron Works, and the Mahoning Valley Iron Works."
1890-11-02T00:00:00Z,"The speed of the sun slackens noticeably during November, there being only an increase of 7 in southerly declination for the month, 3 of which occur in the first ten days. The daylight is diminished by an hour, as it is ten and a half hours in length to-day and only nine and a half on the 30th. The sign of Sagittarius, or the Archer, in which the sun now travels, symbolizes the hunting season."
1890-11-02T00:00:00Z,"The stock market would have been dull the past week had it not been for Reading and Sugar. They made things lively at times. Apart from them not much has been done, and the tendency of prices has been toward improvement. One cause of this was the better state of affairs in London, where the settlement passed off with only one or two unimportant failures."
1890-11-02T00:00:00Z,"As history shows, Nicholas Bayard of New-York some time in 1686 was commissioned ""Colonel of a Regiment of Foot."" Gov. Dongan having encouraged improvement in the drill and discipline of the train bands, the two may be said to have first given something like shape to the New-York volunteersman."
1890-11-02T00:00:00Z,"LENOX, Mass., Nov. 1. -- The Lenox season is at ast drawing to a close. Although many well-known society people have been here the past week, including the Duke and Duchess of Marlborough, they have not tarried long. The cold weather and the whitening of the hilltops indicate that nearly all of the cottages will soon be closed, and only the Winter residents will remain in Lenox."

1890-11-02T00:00:00Z,"Seven old canvases have been imported by Mr. William Schaus in one collection, which so far has remained unbroken. They consist of one specimen of each of the following masters: Rembrandt, Rubens, Van Goyen, Jacob Ruisdael, Frans Hals, Cuyp, and Cornelis Jansen. Considering the difficulty now found to obtain fine examples of the old masters of the Netherlands, it is no small triumph to secure seven pictures as worthy of admiration as these."
1890-11-02T00:00:00Z,"HARTFORD, Conn., Nov. 1. -- The pastoral relationship in the Congregational churches of this State will not on the average exceed a period of five years, long pastorates being the exception in the denomination. It is not uncommon at present for the Congregational societies to call the pastors of other denominations. Within the past three months two cases of the kind have occurred in New-Haven County."
1890-11-02T00:00:00Z,"It is now the opinion of careful observers with a good opportunity for obtaining trustworthy information that, while the contest for the House is complex and desperate, the chances are in favor of a large reform majority. Some place this majority as high as fifty; others, who still do not deny the force of the evidence on which this estimate is based, from a sheer habit of moderation, put the figure at thirty."
1890-11-02T00:00:00Z,"Few men are better known in yachting circles than Niels Olsen, the Superintendent of the New-York Yacht Club. For nineteen years he has been on duty in the New-York Yacht Club's house, keeping the affairs of the club in ship-shape order generally, and to-day any man who does not know Superintendent Olsen may be put down as not being possessed with that useful part of the anatomy known in the yachtsman's phraseology as ""sea legs."""
1890-11-02T00:00:00Z,"PARIS, Nov. 1. -- If the theatrical critics of Paris avoid brain fever this week it is for no lack of stimulant. First came ""Cleopatre"" and the great success of Sarah Bernhardt. The grumblers say that Sardou cut the part to suit his heroine. No one, however, found the same words to say for Henri Meilhac, the author, and Mlle. Rejane, the actress, of ""Cousine,"" at the Theatre des Varietes."
1890-11-02T00:00:00Z,"HARTFORD, Nov. 1. -- The political outlook at the close of the last week of the canvass in this State is unusually favorable for the Democrats. There is strong probability that Judge Morris of New-Haven will be elected Governor on the popular vote. The German Republicans have decided to support Nicholas Staub of New-Milford, the Democratic candidate for Controller, against ex-Senator Lyman S. Catlin of Stratford, the Republican nominee for the place."
1890-11-02T00:00:00Z,"THE SCHOOL OF ART IN FRANCE. -- In France the curriculum is a very trying one, and its superiority consists at once in the severity and thoroughness of the education to which pupils are subjected, and in their admirable opportunities for study in the ateliers of the best masters. The standard is the very highest."
1890-11-02T00:00:00Z,"Very little of the inside history of the famous Irish patriots' rescue from Australia has been told. The statement, however, of the political opponents of John W. Goff, the union candidate for District Attorney, that he did not hold the interests of the Irish people at heart has stirred up some of his friends to speak of the affair and of his connection with it."
1890-11-02T00:00:00Z,"PARIS, Oct. 19. -- It seems that neither the Moulin Rouge nor the Elysee nor the Folies Bergeres quite fills the bill, for Paris can now boast of a very much more luxurious establishment than all these. The Casino de Paris, built in the central locality once known as a skating place in the Rue de Clichy and Rue Blanche, just behind Trinity Church, is a very stupendous place."
1890-11-02T00:00:00Z,"There has never been a municipal contest in this city in which the issue was so clearly defined and in which the character of the forces engaged and of the arguments employed was so strongly marked as that which is now drawing to a close, and it may be that the ordinary standard of judgment in what we have been wont to call ""local politics"" will be found at fault."
1890-11-02T00:00:00Z,"BALTIMORE, Nov. 1. -- The fashionable element of this city turned out to-day to see the football game between Princeton and the University of Virginia. There are Baltimore men on both teams, including Capt. Poe of the Princeton eleven, and every one took a friendly interest in the game."
1890-11-02T00:00:00Z,"We have frequently been entertained by the frankness of our Republican contemporary in Butte, Mon., the Inter Mountain, and we now find proof in its editorial columns that it does not shrink from handling boldly current questions relating to prices and the tariff. On the 20th ult. the Inter Mountain published this paragraph:"
1890-11-02T00:00:00Z,"ROMANS AND OYSTERS. -- The Romans, like ourselves, were fond of eating a few oysters as a prelude to dinner. Athenaeus tells us that Dromeas the parasite was once asked whether the banquets in the city or at Chalcis were the best; he replied that the prelude to the banquet at Chalcis was superior to the whole entertainment in the city -- understanding by the prelude to the banquet the multitude of oysters served up."
1890-11-02T00:00:00Z,"BALTIMORE, Nov. 1. -- Senator Gorman's speech before Tammany last night is read here to-day with considerable amusement, and the large capital that the Tammany organs are trying to make out of his presence there seems, in the light of Senator Gorman's record in this city, to be a huge joke."
1890-11-02T00:00:00Z,"The entries for the Horse Show at Madison Square Garden are all in, and the list, as a whole, is the best ever known. In the thoroughbred class the gain is notable. There are no less than fourteen thoroughbred stallions, double the number ordinarily exhibited in this class."
1890-11-02T00:00:00Z,"BANGOR, Me., Nov. 1. -- Chairman J.H. Manley of the Republican State Committee, who is supposed to have some idea as to the probable results of the coming elections, had the following to say to THE TIMES'S correspondent to-day:"

1890-11-02T00:00:00Z,"DIFFERENCE BETWEEN TAXATION AND ROBBERY. -- If individuals take away some of your property for purposes of their own, it is robbery; you lose your money and get nothing in return. But if the Government takes away some of your property in the shape of taxes, it is supposed to render to you an equivalent in the shape of good government, something without which our lives and property would not be safe."
1890-11-02T00:00:00Z,"PHILADELPHIA, Nov. 1. -- Secretary Blaine received an ovation this afternoon when he appeared on the stage of the Academy of Music to address the Republican mass meeting. The building was crowded to the very doors, and hundreds were unable to gain entrance. Mr. Blaine thanked his audience for the old-fashioned, hearty Pennsylvania welcome they had given him, and then announced that the occasion was not an ordinary one or he should not be present."
1890-11-02T00:00:00Z,"The text is published of what purports to be the English proposal for settling the Behring Sea dispute. It contains little that is new, and advances the controversy not at all beyond formulating a scheme for discussion. Still, it marks a new point of departure in an international controversy of the first magnitude, and therefore cannot be neglected by any observer who wishes to keep track of such events."
1890-11-02T00:00:00Z,"The importance of up-town inter-communication cannot be exaggerated. I believe your correspondent yesterday, if anything, underestimated the importance of cross-town transit in Sixty-fifth Street, Seventy-eighth Street, and Eighty-fifth Street, and underestimated the indignation with which we regard Tammany Hall for refusing this necessity to all people living between Fifty-ninth Street and One Hundred and Tenth Street."
1890-11-02T00:00:00Z,"CARTHAGE AND LUBECK. -- The life by sea was the very life of Carthage. When the Romans before the last siege made it a condition of peace that Carthage should be forsaken and some point ten miles from the sea occupied instead, every Carthaginian felt it as a sentence of death. Athens could not be great without her fleet; but she could live without it."
1890-11-02T00:00:00Z,"Departing from Butte by its narrow exits through the mountain passes one feels very much like a visitor to the United States Treasury vaults -- impressed with the magnitude of the deposits, awed by their sombre surroundings, and exalted by some vague sense of being indirectly and personally involved in the deal. To the world's people, so called, it is always comforting to contemplate mammon."
1890-11-02T00:00:00Z,"Your running of the tax-rate buzz saw has resulted in the horrible mutilation of the editorial brains of the New-York Sun's staff; but please don't cut with this saw only one kind of timber. Let it cut into the Water Department, and expose, if possible, what power beyond that department works it and dictates its methods."
1890-11-02T00:00:00Z,"The annual financial statement of the East Tennessee, Virginia and Georgia Railroad has been issued. It shows that for the year ended June 30, the gross earnings were $6,412,078, operating expenses $4,338,838, and net earnings $2,073,240 over the corresponding period of the previous year. Adding $52,687 income from other sources to the net earnings, the total income last year is found to have been $2,125,927."
1890-11-03T00:00:00Z,Every effort has been made by those specially interested in to-morrow's election to make the voters of this city familiar with the provisions of the ballot law so far as the manner of voting is concerned. There will be no excuse for any one who goes to a polling place without knowing precisely what he will have to do when he gets there.
1890-11-03T00:00:00Z,We have pointed out several examples of the contemptible trickery by which the makers of the new tariff law undertook to raise duties even beyond the higher rates specified in the schedules of the act. Mr. McKINLEY'S box trick for the benefit of the Window-Glass. Trust is one of these. Another has just been uncovered by a decision of the Appraisers.
1890-11-03T00:00:00Z,"The Tammany campaign did not stop Saturday night, but went on yesterday, without regard for the day of rest. There is no Sunday on the Tammany calendar. The leaders of that ancient moral organization opened their saloons at daybreak, and thither flocked the ward heelers, big and little, to talk over the political situation, to lay plans for to-morrow, to drink and gamble on the result, and, incidentally, to make as many converts as possible."
1890-11-03T00:00:00Z,"WASHINGTON, Nov. 2. -- Superintendent of the Census Porter seems to be having a hard time to satisfy himself as to just what figure he will finally settle upon as the official statement of the population of the United States."
1890-11-03T00:00:00Z,"TRENTON, Nov. 2. -- It is not impossible that the Democrats will gain two Congressmen in New-Jersey on Tuesday. The First and Second Districts are conceded to the Republicans; the Third, Fourth, and Seventh can be taken from the Democrats only by a revolution. The Fifth and Sixth Districts are fighting ground, and they are the two which the Democrats hope to rescue from the Republicans."
1890-11-03T00:00:00Z,"PITTSBURG, Penn., Nov. 2. -- The Quay-Delamater people of Allegheny City are very much exercised to-day over the alleged bad faith of Mayor Wyman of that city. When Senator Quay made his visit to this city some ten days ago on his ""boodle"" distributing trip the needs of Allegheny were considered. Pittsburg was conceded to Pattison, and it did not appear to offer sufficient inducement for the investment of any large amount of campaign funds."
1890-11-03T00:00:00Z,"The People's Municipal League has brought together in an address to the voters of the city a statement of some of the more serious effects of Tammany rule. It is significant that the consequences of its incapacity, neglect, and abuse of power fall with peculiar severity upon the poorer people among whom it claims to have its chief support."
1890-11-03T00:00:00Z,"WILMINGTON, Del., Nov. 2. -- The campaign that will close at the polls Tuesday has been one of the most remarkable and hotly-contested ever known in this State. It began with the Republicans hopeful and aggressive, while the Democrats were threatened with the same factional dissensions that wrecked their chances of victory two years ago."
1890-11-03T00:00:00Z,"This is the cry which has been raised by well-known parties against the clergymen in this city who have used their pulpits to advocate municipal reforms, and who have brought all their power as individuals and their influence as professional men through the prestige of the pulpit to bear upon the proposed changes in the administration of the affairs of the city."
1890-11-03T00:00:00Z,"We hope that every rational friend of tariff reform in the Third (Brooklyn) District will to-morrow be sure and vote for Mr. COOMBS for the House of Representatives. He is emphatically the business men's candidate. His views regarding taxation are not those of a theorist or a partisan, but of a practical, clear-headed, experienced business man."
1890-11-03T00:00:00Z,"The present will be a lively week at the Elizabeth track of the New-Jersey Jockey Club, where racing will be resumed on Tuesday afternoon. In addition to the six races, which include one of heats at a mile, there will be run on that day a match race for $1,000 a side between E.H. Garrison's colt Text, by Kinglike-Maxim, and W.C. Daly's colt Charley Post, by Kinglike-Fan Fan."
1890-11-03T00:00:00Z,"When the Crescent Athletic Club's eleven is bunched for a scrimmage at the right side of the field one of their tricks is for Harry Beecher to make a long pass to Edwards, the left half back, who happens to be listlessly standing near the left boundary line. Edwards then bounds down the field and usually gains considerable ground."
1890-11-03T00:00:00Z,"MIDDLETOWN, N.Y., Nov. 2. -- John Owens, a member of the notorious ""Bridge Bandit Gang,"" at Newburg, was killed here by the cars last night. Owens and a companion named Elmer Sarvis were fugitives from justice, being wanted in Newburg for robbing a saloon there."
1890-11-03T00:00:00Z,"NEW-ORLEANS, Nov. 2. -- All Saints' Day was observed more generally than ever to-day. The returns of the railway office show that 30,000 people went out to Metairie Saturday, and fully as many to-day. Twenty thousand dollars was expended in floral and other decorations for graves and tombs. There were several places in Metairie to which there was a constant procession all day."
1890-11-03T00:00:00Z,"It is in the presentation of subjects of a criminal character that Frenchmen are true artists. The mise en scene is always good. It is a kind of realism they delight in, and M. Mace's book, in a pictorial sense at least, cannot be looked at without a certain amount of emotion. As to the literary part of ""Mon Musee Criminel"" there have been many other books better written."
1890-11-03T00:00:00Z,"While Patrolman Thomas German of the Ninth Precinct was endeavoring last night to arrest a man who was acting in a disorderly manner at Hudson and Charlton Street he was set upon by a number of roughs, who knocked him down, wrenched his club from him, and beat him over the head with it, injuring him severely. The officer's assailants escaped."
1890-11-03T00:00:00Z,"MEADVILLE, Penn., Nov. 20. -- One of the boldest robberies perpetrated in this city for many years occurred at 10:30 o'clock last evening at the office of the Wells-Fargo Express Company. The agent, C.P.

1890-11-03T00:00:00Z,"LONDON, Nov. 2. -- Discount eased after the settlement, but became firm again on the report that the Bank of England was borrowing money. The quotations were 4 3/4 to 4. On the Stock Exchange during the week there was experienced a further shrinkage of prices, though the settlement passed off better than the most sanguine had expected. Only two small failures were announced, both dealers in the American department."
1890-11-03T00:00:00Z,"PARIS, Nov. 2. -- Pere Hyacinthe to-day commenced a campaign against clericalism, in his own church, with a vigorous address. He said that the republic was firmly established, but that after leaning toward atheism there was now danger of its lapsing into clericalism."
1890-11-03T00:00:00Z,"It is of small consequence to the decent people of Pennsylvania whether the motives of the Democratic editors in bringing charges against DELAMATER be bad or good; it is of considerable consequence whether those charges be true or false. Mr. BLAINE says that the editors would not make these charges without some great purpose beyond, and that that purpose is to give blow to protection."
1890-11-03T00:00:00Z,"DES MOINES, Iowa, Nov. 2. -- The Democratic and Republican State Committees have given the final touches to the Iowa campaign. Chairman Fullen and Secretary Lee of the Democratic Committee left here for their homes last night, and Republican Chairman Mack and Secretary Chassell will go to-morrow."
1890-11-03T00:00:00Z,"BALTIMORE, Nov. 2. -- Chief Supervisor Bond and United States Marshal Airey showed themselves more than a match for Peter Campbell and William S. Bryan, the counsel for the City Election Committee, in a conference recently held with reference to the instructions to the judges of election, and if they had not receded from the agreement made there would have been trouble at the polls on Tuesday."
1890-11-03T00:00:00Z,"The Brooklyn politicians talked about nothing yesterday but Internal Revenue Collector Ernst Nathan's brazen attempt to force the local liquor and cigar dealers to re-elect William C. Wallace to Congress from the Third District. The general opinion was that the Republican ""boss"" had made the greatest mistake of his life, and many thought that his action would be so forcibly rebuked as to defeat Wallace."
1890-11-03T00:00:00Z,"LONDON, Oct. 23. -- Little Violet Nevin, whose kidnapping by her uncle, J.U. Conolly, and journey to the United States and return have attracted so much attention on both sides of the Atlantic, is temporarily in charge of the Sisters at the Chelsea Convent, near this city, where she was placed by order of Judge Vaughan Williams when she was produced by her uncle in obedience to an order of the court."
1890-11-03T00:00:00Z,"One of the marvels of the municipal canvass has been that in the many speeches made by Mr. SCOTT, some of which have necessarily been hasty and offhand in a rush from one meeting to another, there has invariably been a readiness and an aptness to the occasion that studied effort could hardly have attained, and never an utterance that could be regarded as ill-judged or ill-timed or better avoided than expressed."
1890-11-03T00:00:00Z,"Four of the five leaders in the Irish home-rule movement arrived in this city yesterday on the French steamer La Champagne. John Dillon, M.P., and William O'Brien, M.P., who escaped from Dublin, were two of the arrivals. With them were T.D. Sullivan, M.P., the poet laureate of the Parnellites, and Timothy Harrington, M.P., Secretary of the National League."
1890-11-03T00:00:00Z,"ST. LOUIS, Nov. 2. -- A thirty-thousand-dollar-damage suit will be begun in the Circuit Court to-morrow by Helen S. Rumsey, the six-year-old daughter of Mrs. Mary P. Rumsey. She brings suit by her mother, as guardian, against Julius C. Strauss, the well-known photographer."
1890-11-03T00:00:00Z,"Active preparations are being made aboard the receiving ship Vermont at the Brooklyn Navy Yard to get in readiness the detail of 150 men to be sent overland this week to San Francisco. The sailors go by special train, and are to form part of the crew of the new cruiser San Francisco. The Independence, receiving ship at the Mare Island yard, is unable to supply the San Francisco with more than 200 men."
1890-11-03T00:00:00Z,"The system of public instruction, by means of which an education, however elementary, is within the reach of every child in our city, is rendered more effective and complete by the important share which the corporate schools have in carrying into execution this beneficent design."
1890-11-03T00:00:00Z,Tammany's poverty in actual titles to esteem and confidence is so notorious that if its leaders had not gone into the business of manufacturing spurious claims to consideration they would have been destitute of campaign material. Here is one of the counterfeits taken from Mayor GRANT'S letter of acceptance:
1890-11-04T00:00:00Z,"A secret political club has put forward as its candidate for Mayor Hugh J. Grant, and it seeks to conceal itself behind the name of a great political party. Hugh J. Grant is not the candidate of the Democratic Party; he is the candidate of Tammany Hall."
1890-11-04T00:00:00Z,The members of the Goethe Society and their friends filled the ballroom of the Hotel Brunswick last evening. It was the first meeting of the society this season. President A.M. Palmer said in his address of greeting that it would be the endeavor of the Executive Committee to make the programme during the coming Winter in every way as interesting as that of last year.
1890-11-04T00:00:00Z,"Still another controversy over the obscure and involved language of the McKinley Tariff act has been decided by the Republican customs officers of this port against the importers in favor of the American manufacturer, and as invariably happens in such cases, the consumer pays the damages. In this instance people will discover where the difference comes in when they go to buy their Winter underwear."
1890-11-04T00:00:00Z,"The sloop yacht Tyrant, having on board a party of duck shooters from this city, ran on Nigger Head lock, opposite Hell Gate, on Sunday night. Four men were rescued by crew that put out from Astoria and two of the party where drowned. The accident was due to the efforts of the Captain of the yacht to avoid collision with a sand schooner."
1890-11-04T00:00:00Z,"The Tammany bosses showed yesterday that their boast of confidence in the election of their ticket was the weakest kind of a ""bluff."" They hurried hither and thither in a wild scramble to pull victory out of defeat. Their tongues were so tuned to making ridiculous claims of big majorities for Grant that they talked on in the same mechanical fashion, while their actions gave the lie to their words."
1890-11-04T00:00:00Z,"The ducking season on the Susquehanna flats begins at 5 o'clock this morning. Every train yesterday took gunners to Havre de Grace from Baltimore, Philadelphia, New-York, and other places. These, with the local sportsmen and those whose business it is to shoot ducks for market, will make between 400 and 500 persons who will occupy the feeding grounds at daybreak to begin the slaughter."
1890-11-04T00:00:00Z,"PHILADELPHIA, Nov. 3. -- Capt. John F. Allen of the schooner Cornelius Hargreaves, sunk in the collision off Barnegat, arrived in Philadelphia this morning, and gave his version of the accident. He said:"
1890-11-04T00:00:00Z,"CHICAGO, Nov. 3. -- The big packers themselves have confirmed the report that they have purchased about 4,000 acres of land in Lake County, Ind., for stock yard purposes."
1890-11-04T00:00:00Z,"The gunboat Concord will leave her berth at the yards of Roach Co., Chester, Penn., early this morning. She is expected to reach New-York about slack high water to-morrow afternoon. To-night the Concord will anchor inside of Delaware Breakwater."
1890-11-04T00:00:00Z,"WASHINGTON, Nov. 3. -- Secretary Noble probably wishes there had never been such a thing as a New-York census while he was at the head of the Interior Department. New-York's persistent efforts to have her people fairly counted have made the Secretary very weary, and now he seems to find it hard to keep his temper as calm and unruffled as is becoming to a Cabinet officer."
1890-11-04T00:00:00Z,"The snake chosen by Sarah Bernhardt to serve as her executioner is of the ""blind-worm"" species, and is known in France as an orvet It is a pretty creature, which may be often found on the tops of old walls sunning itself. The back is dark green with metallic hues that are in ceruain lights iridescent. Sarah's snake is called by her Iris."
1890-11-04T00:00:00Z,"Broadway had a good old-fashioned blockade yesterday afternoon that tangled up trucks, wagons, backs, and street cars for almost a mile of the city's main thoroughfare, while smaller jams stretched back half a block or so in the side streets. The cause of all the trouble was a trifling one. It wasn't a big and heavily-loaded track that broke down right on the line of the street cars."
1890-11-04T00:00:00Z,"SAN FRANCISCO, Nov. 3. -- In the campaign now closing the dangers of the California Democracy may be expressed in two words -- money and Buckley. In all other respects the outlook is extremely favorable, but Senator Stanford is here overseeing the legislative fight in person, and the details of its management are in the hands of an able general, experienced in the financial persuasion of voters."
1890-11-04T00:00:00Z,"WASHINGTON, Nov. 3. -- The racing here to-day was run under discouraging weather conditions. The attendance was light and the sport evoked no enthusiasm. Details of the racing are as follows:"
1890-11-04T00:00:00Z,"The Lyceum Theatre company ended its ten weeks Saturday night in Brooklyn, having played since August in Chicago, Boston, Philadelphia, and other important cities. The receipts of the tour are said to have been exceptionally large, and the reception of Mr. Frohman's company everywhere was of a most enthusiastic character."
1890-11-04T00:00:00Z,"WASHINGTON, Nov. 3. -- Before President Harrison started for Indianapolis, where he is going to vote to-morrow, he designated Acting Fourth Auditor Whitaker to be also Acting Third Auditor of the Treasury Department, because the Third Auditor, the Deputy Third Auditor, and all other officers of the Third Auditor's office have gone home to vote. Mr. Whitaker is Acting Fourth Auditor because the Fourth Auditor is also absent."
1890-11-04T00:00:00Z,"CHICAGO, Nov. 3. -- ""The big crops in Eastern Washington and Northern Idaho are likely to remain in warehouses several months before they can be hauled away,"" said James Albright, of Sprague, Washington, who has just arrived in this city."
1890-11-04T00:00:00Z,"AMHERST, Mass., Nov. 3. -- The football game between Amherst and Cornell to-day was marked by continual ""kicking"" on both sides. Two halves of thirty minutes each were played. In the first half neither side scored. The ball was in Cornell's territory the greater part of the time."
1890-11-04T00:00:00Z,"The real question before the country, which is in part to be settled to-day, is the question whether a political party can conduct the government of a republic, under universal suffrage, in defiance of public opinion. Mr. REED, Mr. QUAY, and a number of minor Republican machinists have staked their political future upon the proposition that this can be done."
1890-11-04T00:00:00Z,"BOSTON, Nov. 3. -- The Liliputians, who achieved such success at Niblo's and the Metropolitan Opera House in New-York, appeared in their spectacular play, ""The Pupil in Magic,"" at the Hollis Street Theatre in this city for the first time to-night. The large house was packed to the doors. The audience, composed almost entirely of Americans, with hardly a German among them, was most enthusiastic and applauded the Liliputians again and again."
1890-11-04T00:00:00Z,A remarkable feature of the Congressional campaign has been the deliberate and persistent lying of high-tariff journals about the requirements of the new tariff law and the effect of that law upon prices. Even the most respectable of these papers have yielded to the temptation and have thrown aside all regard for truth in dealing with these matters. And they have been supported by the official utterances of the Republican Campaign Committees.
1890-11-04T00:00:00Z,"WASHINGTON, Nov. 3. -- Telegraphic orders were sent to-day to Chief Engineer Loring, President of the board conducting the evaporation test of one of the boilers of the torpedo boat Cushing, directing him to give the boiler a supplementary test of one hour's duration at its fullest capacity, with the maximum coal consumption and with the blowers running at the highest possible speed."
1890-11-04T00:00:00Z,"There were not many changes of bill at the theatres last night, and none of them were very important. George Thatcher's newly-organized minstrel company had a demonstrative audience at the Bijou Theatre. In Part I. only the comic men had blackened faces. The others were dressed as Spanish toreadors, and, although the costume is not very appropriate it is certainly picturesque."
1890-11-04T00:00:00Z,"The application for the appointment of a receiver for the Sugar Trust was granted by Judge Pratt Saturday in the Supreme Court, Brooklyn. The opinion filed with the clerk is a very long one, and reviews in an exhaustive manner the history of the suits brought by Gleason and Cameron, and on which was based the demand for a receiver."
1890-11-04T00:00:00Z,"The Chicago Journal says that it has been practically settled that the Wabash Railroad Company will extend its line from Butler, Mich., to a connection with the Western Indiana, thereby rendering it independent of the Chicago and Erie for an entrance to Chicago, and that the Canadian Pacific will be given a Chicago line by the same route."
1890-11-04T00:00:00Z,"Just now great interest centres in the coming convention of amateur photographers. That it will be a success seems now to be beyond doubt, if the notices of amateurs of their intention to be present count for anything. From all parts of the country word has been received of delegations that are to come."
1890-11-04T00:00:00Z,"OTTAWA, Ontario, Nov. 3. -- The Governor General has received a petition from England praying that the sentence of death, recently passed upon Reginald Birchall, now in jail at Woodstock, Ontario, be commuted to imprisonment for life. Unless the Governor General intervenes, the prisoner will be hanged on Nov. 14. The English petition is signed by 2,000 persons, including Birchall's mother, Oswald Birchall, half-brother of the prisoner, and rector of Buscot, besides prominent clergymen."
1890-11-04T00:00:00Z,"LONDON, Nov. 3. -- Mr. Gladstone started on his return to Hawarden, from Scotland, to-day. When the train on which he was traveling reached Montrose a large number of his friends were in waiting, and they gave him an enthusiastic reception. This scene was repeated at Arbroath. At Dundee a number of his admirers presented him with a walking stick and a luncheon basket."
1890-11-04T00:00:00Z,"Ernst Nathan's secret intimidation circular is having such a disastrous effect in the Third Congressional District, Brooklyn, that Congressman Wallace, whom it was designed to help, yesterday repudiated it. Wallace reached his headquarters in the Arbuckle Building bright and early and found a letter from F.H. McArthur demanding to know all about the Nathan circular."
1890-11-04T00:00:00Z,"There is not much to choose, in point of dignity, between the Governor of the State of New-York and the Secretary of the Interior. We pointed out to the former functionary, when he sent in his protest against the refusal to recount the inhabitants of this city, that he was laying himself open to a severe retort when he allowed himself to bring partisanship into the question."
1890-11-04T00:00:00Z,"PARIS, Oct. 19. -- M. Jules Lemaitre, the celebrated critic of the Debate, has once again entered the public arena. His first and only play, ""The Revoltee,"" it will be remembered, met with considerable favor and considerable adverse criticism. It belonged to the so-called new dramatic school. The present venture of the author is still more modern, and more given to pure character study."
1890-11-04T00:00:00Z,"TOPEKA, Kan., Nov. 3. -- Political affairs in Kansas are in a chaotic state, such as was never before seen. The Farmers' Alliance, organized first solely for self-protection and self-instruction, was, one year ago, not unlike the dozen other organizations in the State, small in numbers and without particular influence. It grew, however, like the fabulous pumpkin vine in Southern California, and threatened in a short time to entwine and choke all opposing parties."
1890-11-04T00:00:00Z,"Several public institutions in the city of Elizabeth will have their treasuries partly replenished to-day as a result of the racing at the Linden Park Blood Horse Association's track yesterday. The association itself gave $1,000 of its gate receipts, and a subscription among the bookmakers resulted in the collection of $620 more, of which latter amount Eugene Leigh, lately trainer for the Chicago Stable, gave $100."
1890-11-05T00:00:00Z,"The result of the election in Brooklyn was a most emphatic Democratic victory. That party elected its county and city ticket by large pluralities, that for Courtney for Sheriff in 505 of the 648 districts in the city running up to 14,000. Jackson for Controller and Weber for Auditor were also elected by substantial pluralities."
1890-11-05T00:00:00Z,"Mr. THOMAS B. REED was elected Speaker of the House in the present Congress by a majority of 7. When the House adjourned the Dictator had succeeded in making that majority 24. When the House meets in December, 1891, Mr. REED, if he is the candidate of his party for Speaker, will be defeated by a majority of at least 70."
1890-11-05T00:00:00Z,"BALTIMORE, Nov. 4. -- Returns from all parts of the State show heavy Democratic gains. In Southern Maryland the new registration law cut the vote down nearly one third."
1890-11-05T00:00:00Z,"OMAHA, Neb., Nov. 4. -- Nebraska is the slowest State in the Union to count election returns, but all early indications foreshadow a remarkable Democratic triumph. This city has probably given James E. Boyd, Democratic candidate for Governor, 10,000 majority. Richards, the Republican candidate, was cut out and left by his own party. Early returns indicate that the same thing occurred in other large cities of the State."
1890-11-05T00:00:00Z,"SYRACUSE, N.Y., Nov. 4. -- The friends of the new system of voting which has just had its first trial in this State have not been at all surprised or discouraged by the opposition it has encountered. They have never cherished the delusion that so radical a change in a matter touching so many people would be accepted without challenge or debate."
1890-11-05T00:00:00Z,"The once all-powerful, famous, and always popular racing stable of the Dwyer Brothers is now broken up. A great crowd was at the dissolution sale, which was held yesterday afternoon in the saddling paddocks of the New-Jersey Jockey Club's track. The stable has been very unfortunate this year, and no amount of coaxing would make fortune smile upon it."
1890-11-05T00:00:00Z,"The new Constitution of the State of Mississippi differs in the provision made for its adoption from most instruments of organic law now in force in the United States, though following precedents established in that State. It will not be submitted to the people. The Memphis Appeal of Sunday morning publishes the Constitution in full as adopted by the convention at 10 o'clock on Saturday night, Nov. 1."
1890-11-05T00:00:00Z,"Large fields and a good class of horses combine to make a card for to-day's races at Elizabeth which is far above the average, even in midsummer. As the opening race received twenty-two entries, it was divided so there will be seven contests on for decision, and those look as if they would give the eighty-three bookmakers all the business they care for. The entries and weights for the several events are as follows:"
1890-11-05T00:00:00Z,"It became evident early in the day yesterday that the Hudson County ring had been up to its old tricks. In the first place nineteen of the Republican election officers failed to call upon City Clerk Scott in Jersey City for their official Republican ballots, and suspicion became strong that they had been bribed to stay away."
1890-11-05T00:00:00Z,"The number of votes cast in this city yesterday was a surprise to political observers of all parties. Little more than 214,000 ballots were polled on a registration of 245,164. Last year, with not as exciting or important a contest, nearly as many votes were cast on a registration of only 218,923. This year more than 30,000 citizens who were registered refrained from voting. This is unprecedented."
1890-11-05T00:00:00Z,"CAMBRIDGE, Mass., Nov. 4. -- A crowd of about three thousand spectators watched Harvard defeat the famous Orange Athletic Club's eleven this afternoon. The Orange team was weakened by the absence of Gill, Corbin, and Bonvaird, the latter acting as referee. Cumnock played at his old position of left end for Harvard, but did not distinguish himself."
1890-11-05T00:00:00Z,"RICHMOND, Va., Nov. 4. -- From the few returns received up to 10 o'clock, the indications are that the Democrats have made a clean sweep in Virginia and carried all ten Congressional districts."
1890-11-05T00:00:00Z,"The National Cross-Country Association succeeded in deciding its junior championship race at Morris Park yesterday. The race was postponed from last April, or rather was declared off, on account of the inability of the officials of the regular championship meeting to decide the winners of the junior event. To make the meeting yesterday more successful the association gave also an eight-mile open handicap, run over the championship course, a number of individual prizes being offered."
1890-11-05T00:00:00Z,"COLUMBUS, Ohio, Nov. 4. -- The election in Ohio to-day was for Secretary of State, Supreme Court Judge, and member of the Board of Public Works. The Republican candidates were Daniel Ryan, Thaddeus A. Minshall, and Frank McCulloch. The Democratic candidates were Thaddeus E. Crumley, George B. Okey, and Leopold Kiefer."
1890-11-05T00:00:00Z,"Yesterday's experience demonstrated two things with reference to ballot reform. One is that, so far as the essential features of that reform as advocated by its real friends were embodied in the law of this State, the objects aimed at were fully attained. The other is, such complications and difficulties as were encountered were due wholly to the modifications of the orignal plan which were made to secure the approval of Gov. HILL."
1890-11-05T00:00:00Z,"ALBANY, NOV. 4. -- Gov. Hill received the news over the regular press wires and by special dispatches in the Executive Chamber. There were with him Judge I.H. Maynard, Col. McEwan, Col. Kopper of New-York, and T.C. Callicot, the ex-convict editor whose Albany newspaper is the Governor's personal organ. The Governor was in a gleeful mood and commented freely on the news."
1890-11-05T00:00:00Z,"MILWAUKEE, Wis., Nov. 4. -- The election to-day turned entirely on local issues. The last Legislature passed an educational measure, compelling parents to give children between seven and fourteen years of age twelve weeks' schooling each year, in which reading and writing in English should be included."
1890-11-05T00:00:00Z,"DES MOINES, Iowa, Nov. 4. -- The vote polled in Iowa to-day is not as large as was expected, when the favorable weather is considered. The farmers seem to have preferred to labor in their cornfields rather than to go to the polls. This fact cost the Republican Party dearly, and it has probably lost them the State."
1890-11-05T00:00:00Z,"CHARLESTON, S.C., Nov. 4. -- The election passed off quietly throughout the State. A very small vote was polled -- not more than three-fourths of the registered voters. The negroes generally remained in the cotton fields and took no part in the election."
1890-11-05T00:00:00Z,"ELLENDALE, N.D., Nov. 4. -- The election in this State to-day exceeded in interest and importance any previous event of the kind. The most exciting pictures were the efforts to defeat legislative candidates favorable to the return of Senator Pierce, and to elect members pledged to a resubmission of the prohibition question."
1890-11-05T00:00:00Z,"JACKSON, Miss., Nov. 4. -- This State elected nothing but seven Congressmen to-day. The only districts where there was the least doubt were the Second, Third, and Sixth. In the remaining four there was no opposition. In the First and Fifth it was only a question as to what the Democratic majorities would be. The returns confirm this. In the Second District J.C. Kyle was the Democratic nominee, and George M. Buchanan the Republican."
1890-11-05T00:00:00Z,"Neology has flourished during the campaign just closed like the ""green baize"" tree. One editor -- and by the way the neologists have all of them been newspaper men -- has given us the verb ""to McKinley,"" the definition of which will occur to any person of average intelligence, and another editor has introduced into his vocabulary the word ""tomreedism,"" of equally obvious significance."
1890-11-05T00:00:00Z,"It is easy to foresee that the very first result of the re-election of Mayor GRANT will be an outcry from citizens of a virtuous disposition and a weak constitution for the resumption of the government of New-York from Albany. In fact, whoever appeared last night in the haunts of such citizens must have heard a good deal of talk tending in that direction."
1890-11-05T00:00:00Z,"CARMEL, N.Y., NOV. 4. -- The new ballot law worked successfully in Putnam County to-day, although in a few instances it was not carried out strictly to the letter. In giving out the ballots the clerks usually folded one, and then instructed the voter to do up the others in the same manner. The folding was frequently done in a very imperfect manner."
1890-11-05T00:00:00Z,"Tammany has elected twenty Assemblymen in this city, the only County Democrats chosen being BRADY in the Fourth District and DINKELSPIEL in the Twelfth, neither of them a credit to the organization, and the only Republicans are BRODSKY in the Eighth and HILDRETH in the Twenty-first, if, indeed, BRODSKY is still to be rated as a Republican."
1890-11-05T00:00:00Z,"Although, at the time of writing, the returns from Pennsylvania are still very incomplete, they indicate a majority of 10,000 for PATTISON. The extent to which QUAY has been ""vindicated"" must make Mr. BLAINE feel that he made a very poor bargain when he went down to Philadelphia last Saturday."
1890-11-05T00:00:00Z,"CHICAGO, Nov. 4. -- The returns in this city and State are being canvassed with extraordinary slowness. Only half the city precincts have been heard from on the vote for Sheriff, and at midnight no returns have been received at headquarters on the vote for the four Congressmen from this city."
1890-11-05T00:00:00Z,"WASHINGTON, Nov. 4. -- The racing here to-day was witnessed by a small crowd, though the programme was an exceptionally good one. Stoval weighed out to ride St. John in the third race, but the betting becoming so suspicious, his price going back from 7 to 5 to 2 1/2 to 1, the judges substituted Higgs. Details of the racing are as follows:"
1890-11-05T00:00:00Z,It seems fitting that we should publish this morning in a little group certain assertions and expressions of opinion which indicate the attitude of Republican leaders and organs toward a marked increase of the cost of living. They are as follows:
1890-11-05T00:00:00Z,"PHILADELPHIA, Nov. 4. -- This city gives about 25,000 majority for Delamater. The State is close, with chances in favor of Pattison."
1890-11-05T00:00:00Z,"The New-York Athletic Club and Boston Athletic Association began a series of annual football matches on the Polo Grounds yesterday afternoon. The Bostons won handily by a score of 34 to 0. Stickney secured five touch-dows and Beall one, and Beall kicked five goals from touch-downs. Capt. Peters of the Boston team and Schlesinger of the New-Yorks were injured."
1890-11-05T00:00:00Z,"NEW-HAVEN, Nov. 4. -- Reports received up to midnight show almost conclusively that the Democrats have won a victory. Morris and the entire State ticket are undoubtedly elected. There is a certain gain of two Congressmen, with a propability of three, and Senator O.H. Platt is possibly retired to private life by the election of a Democratic Legislature."
1890-11-05T00:00:00Z,"ST. LOUIS, Nov. 4. -- Bright weather and the novelty of the Australian system brought out a very heavy vote for an off year all over Missouri. The election was for Supreme Judge, Railroad Commissioner, Superintendent of Schools, fourteen Congressmen, and the Legislature, which will choose a successor to George G. Vest in the United States Senate and rearrange the Congressional districts."
1890-11-05T00:00:00Z,"ST. PAUL, Minn., Nov. 4. -- Minnesota may still be classed as a Republican State, although the pluralities received by that party's nominees at to-day's election are nothing to brag of. W.R. Merriam is re-elected Governor by a plurality of about 8,500, against 24,000 two years ago. The remainder of the Republican ticket except Auditor is elected by greatly reduced pluralities Adolph Bierman (Dem. and Alliance) is elected Auditor by about 20,000 majority."
1890-11-05T00:00:00Z,"The Princeton College eleven won a game yesterday by a score of 85 to 0 from a team of Columbia College students. The game was played in the morning on the Berkeley Oval, and a crowd of nearly 3,000 persons turned out to watch the play of the orange-and-black kickers."
1890-11-05T00:00:00Z,"One of the few amenities of the late municipal campaign has been the sight of JUDAS and ANANIAS working together in harmony. Ever since JUDAS began to take away ANANIAS circulation, and Gov. CLEVELAND omitted to pay to ANANIAS'S opinion the deference that ANANIAS thought it deserved, ANANIAS'S politics have consisted in opposition to CLEVELAND and to JUDAS."
1890-11-05T00:00:00Z,"ABERDEEN, S.D., NOV. 4. -- Bitterness marked every feature of to-day's election in South Dakota. There were three tickets in the field -- Republican, Democratic, and Alliance -- and the fight centred on the legislative ticket, the Alliance and Democrats having fused in a large number of districts for the avowed purpose of electing men antagonistic to United States Senator Moody."
1890-11-06T00:00:00Z,"Herrmann's Theatre was closed last night, and the Minnie Palmer Comic Opera Company has probably collapsed. A slim audience had assembled in this place of amusement, when, a little after 8 o'clock. Acting Manager Morton appeared before the curtain and announced that, owing to the sudden and unexpected illness of Charles Dickson, an actor in the company, no performance would be given, and money paid for tickets would be refunded."
1890-11-06T00:00:00Z,"COLUMBUS, Ohio, Nov. 5. -- The result of the election in Ohio yesterday has surprised both political managers and the rank and file of the parties. So far as the State ticket was concerned the Democrats on the outside were willing to concede the election of Ryan, Republican candidate for Secretary of State, by a plurality of 20,000."
1890-11-06T00:00:00Z,I do not think the People's Municipal League need despair in their efforts for good government in the city of New York in consequence of the defeat of their ticket.

Favorites and outsiders divided winning honors about equally, though, with the exception of Now or Never in the first race and the Brunette gelding in the last, all the winners were fairly well backed."
1890-11-06T00:00:00Z,"The large number of entries for the fifth race this afternoon has necessitated its division, so that visitors to the New-Jersey Jockey Club's track will see seven instead of six races run at the Elizabeth track. The entries for each of the races are numerous, so that there will be excellent sport for the enjoyment of the crowd that will certainly be on hand to see the contests."

HARPER BROTHERS with Mr. RUDYARD KIPLING, an account so perverted that it could scarcely have proceeded from Mr. KIPLING himself, Mr. KIPLING, however, returned the honorarium of 10 which the HARPERS sent him upon the publication of their collection of his stories, and thus seemed to give his support to the accusation against them of unfair dealing."

They have secured a majority in the House of Representatives of the Fifty-second Congress of nearly 150, if not more than that unequaled figure. The Republicans will certainly have less than 100 members of the lower branch, so that the Democratic Speaker will be embarrassed in the work of making up the committees, as there will be scarely enough Republicans to ""go round."""
1890-11-06T00:00:00Z,"MILWAUKEE, Wis., Nov. 5. -- It was not the tail end of the landslide which struck this State Tuesday. The Democrats elect seven and perhaps eight out of the nine Congressmen in this State. The Legislature is surely Democratic, and the majority on joint ballot is variously estimated at from 15 to 40."

The Senate consists of 19 Republicans and 13 Democrats -- a Republican majority of 6. This indicates a tie in the joint convention, and as a United States Senator is to be elected to succeed Mr. EVARTS, this has unusual significance."
1890-11-06T00:00:00Z,"Luther H. Cary, the sprint runner of the Manhattan Athletic Club, made unsuccessful attempts to surpass several amateur records at the Berkeley Oval yesterday afternoon. He did not try to run 100 yards in 9 1/2 seconds, as the Manhattans will not allow him to do this until the gust over his recent run at Princeton blows itself out, but he went for the 110-yard, 120-yard, and 125-yard records."

1890-11-07T00:00:00Z,"The congratulations that have poured in upon Mayor GRANT upon his re-election are worth considering. Those from out of town always assume that his election is somehow a ""Democratic victory,"" and are indeed based upon that assumption.

1890-11-07T00:00:00Z,"BOSTON, Nov. 6. -- This has been a great night for Boston Democrats.

1890-11-07T00:00:00Z,"So close was the vote in the Third Congressional District in Brooklyn, that it looks as though only an official count can determine whether William J. Coombs or William O. Wallace was elected. From the temper of both candidates and their friends it is likely that either will contest in case the other is declared to have the majority of the votes."

A year ago the Democrats elected their Governor by a plurality of a little less than 11,000 and secured a majority in both branches of the Legislature.

1890-11-10T00:00:00Z,"KANSAS CITY, Nov. 9. -- Seven desperate negroes made a daring escape from the county jail to-day. It is the custom of the prison officials to make their prisoners empty their slop buckets at 9 o'clock every morning. The prisoners are let out for this, cellsful at a time. Jailer Andy O'Hara was the guard delegated to the duty this morning."
1890-11-10T00:00:00Z,"Mr. NOBLE'S last denial of the claim of New-York to a recount is highly disgraceful to him personally. It does not appear what advantage he can now expect from it politically, for it was made after the elections that showed that the difference of one member of Congress or of one Elector from this State was likely to be a very small matter for some years to come."
1890-11-10T00:00:00Z,"The Brooklyn Ethical Association held its second Sunday evening meeting of the season last night at the Second Unitarian Church of Brooklyn, at Clinton and Congress Streets.

1890-11-10T00:00:00Z,"CLEVELAND, Ohio, Nov. 9. -- A contested will case that has just been brought to a conclusion in the Common Pleas Court here made public the vagaries of a most remarkable miser. No character creation of a novelist ever equaled the personality of this man, and the statements which follow and which were all made upon the witness stand under oath would, if incorporated in a story, pass for wild romancing."

She is at present lying off Tompkinsville, S.I., and though in hull she may not be as attractive as her more graceful sister, the Dolphin, she sits the water as lightly and with as much jauntiness as a storm petrel riding a wave crest. The Petrel is the smallest vessel of the new navy in commission."
1890-11-10T00:00:00Z,"Many hundreds of New-Yorkers have received with sincere regret the announcement that Mr. THEODORE THOMAS had decided to remove to Chicago. A very considerable portion of these New-Yorkers must have received the announcement with some remorse in addition to their regret, for it was also announced that Mr. THOMAS'S removal was due to the fact that an arrangement had been concluded in Chicago more favorable to him than could be concluded in New-York."

1890-11-10T00:00:00Z,"COLUMBUS, Ohio, Nov. 9. -- The defeat of Major McKinley in the Sixteenth District makes him the logical candidate of the Republicans for Governor next year, and it is hardly probable any other candidate will be considered. In reducing the Democratic majority in the rock-ribbed counties that composed his district, Mr. McKinley was remarkably successful, but 2,998 was a very heavy contract to undertake with hopes of success."
1890-11-11T00:00:00Z,"WASHINGTON, Nov. 10. -- Some political blunderer or mischief maker has given the cause of Representative John Quinn of New-York, who is a candidate for Clerk of the Fifty-second Congress, a black eye at the outset of his canvass.

PORTER'S moral condition that he feels himself impelled to say something about the Federal enumeration of the inhabitants of this city.

New-York: Harper Brothers. 1890. -- Plenty of swing and go, incidents of more than human possibility, tall talk and symbolism make this a lively romance indeed! Collaboration between two writers like Messrs. Haggard and Lang presents a curious question, since there is a wider difference between them than commonly occurs under such circumstances."
1890-11-16T00:00:00Z,"LA LIBERTAD, Nov. 15, via Galveston. -- Advices have been received from Honduras that Gen. Sanchez has been captured by the forces under President Bogran, and that the revolution is probably at an end."

1890-11-16T00:00:00Z,"PARIS, Nov. 1. -- It is rather an old story to tell again the intense passion of M. Porel for our poet Shakespeare; still he must always be a trifle more interesting to us on account of this pluck and courage. He showed taste and discernment in the selection and presentation of ""Much Ado About Nothing,"" ""A Midsummer Night's Dream,"" and ""The Merchant of Venice."""
1890-11-16T00:00:00Z,"CINCINNATI, Nov. 15. -- About the latter part of May last, through the vigilance of the United States Secret Service officials only, President Harrison barely escaped assassination. The would-be assassin was a Southern crank, who claimed to be a sadly persecuted Republican whose life the Southern Democracy and thankless Republicans had made miserable."
1890-11-16T00:00:00Z,"WHEN IS A GLOVE NOT A GLOVE? -- The question is, What amount of leather and stuffing must a man have on his hand, when he is pummeling another man, in order not to commit a breach of the peace? If these stupid acts of Parliament did not always omit the most important details, the difficulty would never have arisen."
1890-11-16T00:00:00Z,"PARIS, Nov. 15. -- The last new comedy, ""La Parisienne,"" has not been a success at the Comedie Francaise. This is owing, at least in a great measure, to the very inadequate interpretation. Mlle. Reichemberg was unwise in accepting a part entirely foreign to her nature and talent. Neither Feraudy nor Prudhon could help out the heroine."
1890-11-16T00:00:00Z,"BERLIN, Nov. 15. -- Count Douglas, a Free Conservative, whose intimate relations with the Emperor and the Court are well known, will probably succeed Dr. Lucius as Minister of Agriculture. Count Douglas had an interview with the Emperor yesterday and a conference with Herr Miquel, Prussian Minister of Finance, to-day. Although Dr. Lucius has resigned, the Emperor to-day received verbal reports from him."
1890-11-16T00:00:00Z,"PHILADELPHIA, Nov. 15. -- The Street broke out again in a panic to-day, and only the early closing of the day's business saved disaster.

1890-11-16T00:00:00Z,"The story of the day and its developments may well cause the outside world to marvel at the crudeness of Wall Street's arrangements for getting news from London. It is generally understood among persons not engaged in the business of buying and selling stocks that trustworthy, prompt, and practically continuous information from the centre of the financial world is essential to the safe and convenient pursuit of that calling."
1890-11-16T00:00:00Z,"WHERE SIR WALTER RALEIGH SMOKED HIS PIPE. -- Sir Walter Raleigh, that most brilliant of adventurers, sometimes took a cup of wine and smoked a pipe of the new-found tobacco at the ""Queen's Head,"" among the orchards and green fields of Islington. Sir John Suckling played bowls at the ""Bear-at-the-Bridge-Foot,"" which stood at the Southwark end of old London Bridge, and was pulled down in 1761."
1890-11-16T00:00:00Z,"It is to guard against the depredations of such fast cruisers as the Baltimore, Philadelphia, San Francisco, and Charleston, and those of other nations that the British are pushing forward their cable connections. Work under the programme laid out by the Admiralty some months ago has already begun. The programme provides for the joining of Gibraltar with Sierra Leone direct, and not as now by way of St. Vincent in the Cape de Verde Islands."

1890-11-16T00:00:00Z,"DUFFERS, SHARPERS, CRIMINALS, LONDON, 1790. -- We read of certain ""sharpers who are known by the name of 'duffers,' who, among others knaveries, passed bad money."" Oddly enough, in modern slang, it is the ingenu, or dupe, and not the knave, who is called a ""duffer."" It is stated also that elegantly-dressed ""female sharpers"" used even to go to Court at St. James's."
1890-11-16T00:00:00Z,"Now the book hunters return from those fabulous voyages to London, Munich, Paris, and Rome, bringing invaluable books that pay their expenses and a great profit besides. They have manuscripts, books printed in the fifteenth century, ancient woodcuts, masterpieces of bookbinding, and books from famous libraries. They make one jealous with their treasures."
1890-11-16T00:00:00Z,"They all thought he was a fool; but then they often make mistakes like that. Kangaroos can't jump like women when the women are jumping at conclusions. You see, the trouble was that Collis Beattie -- Collie they called him when they wanted to be funny -- did not have much to say. He used to lie about the hotel veranda in a big steamer chair and read novels."
1890-11-16T00:00:00Z,""" The science and practice of medicine and surgery,"" said an eminent physician of this city about a year ago, ""are undergoing a revolution of such magnitude and importance that its limits can hardly be conceived.""

1890-11-16T00:00:00Z,"Before the market opened yesterday, the Street was flooded with abounding rumors intended to create distrust and accomplishing all that was intended. For a long time the Stock Exchange district has been flooded with tales of dire distress in high financial quarters. Not one house, but many, rumor has declared to be in difficulties threatening disaster."

1890-11-16T00:00:00Z,"A hundred years ago party lines -- as we understand them -- in our politics were yet unknown. They were in an embryonic state, however, in a short time to develop and to grow until such a climax in partisanship had been reached as has not been equaled since until our House of Representatives discovered a need of the country for such a measure as the Force bill."
1890-11-16T00:00:00Z,There was little logic and less sense in the condition of Wall Street yesterday. The visible cause of the prevailing uneasiness was nothing more specific than a vague fear that something might happen to somebody and so precipitate a general disaster. Distrust of the strength of others rather than any consciousness of personal weakness was the basis of the apprehension that filled the minds of the frequenters of the Street.
1890-11-16T00:00:00Z,""" Society,"" says one of the definitions in Pierre Larousse's dictionary, is ""an association of people who come together to converse, to enjoy themselves, to give themselves up to some common recreation,"" and it is in this sense that it must be understood in treating of society at the capital. People who stay at home are thus not society people."
1890-11-16T00:00:00Z,"Both the Brotherhood and League men held meetings yesterday, but little of importance was transacted. A.L. Johnson of Cleveland has come down from his lofty perch and publicly announced his desire to sell out. He said he would take $40,000 and leave a clear field in Cleveland for the League people, an announcement that caused much merriment in League ranks."
1890-11-16T00:00:00Z,"LONDON, Nov. 15 -- The unhappy controversy on the subject of the Stanley charges against the officers of Stanley's rear guard still continues, and it grows, if possible, in horrors as the revelations and rumors multiply.

1890-11-16T00:00:00Z,"SEDAN. -- Every house in Bazeilles was destroyed, with the exception of three of the larger ones, belonging to well-to-do persons. Every poor little cottage was utterly abime, and the contents, furniture, clothing, valuables of humble kind, yet quite invaluable to the humble owners were absolutely done away with. Not that the Germans looted the village; the agency they employed was fire."

Yet the number of these guns of the 4-inch, 5-inch, and 6-inch calibres, already required under existing plans, is very great."
1890-11-16T00:00:00Z,"NEW-HAVEN, Nov. 15. -- At the beginning of the season the Yale outlook in football was not at all encouraging. Rhodes, Heffelfinger, Hartwell, and McClung were the only players of last year's team that could be counted on to play this Fall. One tackle, one guard, one end, and one half back did not seem to be a very large nucleus to build upon, and no one in New-Haven was at all sanguine."

1890-11-16T00:00:00Z,"WASHINGTON, Nov. 15. -- Two men named Robert E. Wilson, both of Atlanta, Ga., are struggling for the same place, and the story of the struggle is interesting. One took the regular civil service departmental examination and the other the Post Office examination. Both succeeded in passing; the departmental man well, the other not so well."
1890-11-16T00:00:00Z,"The struggle between the brokers and the auctioneers for the control of the Real Estate Exchange is developing lively interest and animosities, which are hardly likely to be quieted with the close of the campaign next month, when the annual election will be held. This year the auctioneers have been in control because the illness of one Director elected by the brokers and the defection of another enabled them to capture the offices."

The water is emerald in color and clear as crystal."

The various reaping, thrashing, sowing, and other devices for farm work were in this list. The inventions to facilitate and make safer the various operations in practical railroading underwent this experience."
1890-11-17T00:00:00Z,"John Jackson, the Texas Socialist, says: ""The more we Socialists reflect on the causes that moved the avalanche the better we like it.

1890-11-17T00:00:00Z,"The business men of New-York have reason for pride and confidence in the financial system of this great city, and it is worth while to call attention to this fact at the moment that the country press is ringing with windy denunciations of the ""New-York gamblers.""

1890-11-17T00:00:00Z,"Five steamships came into port yesterday with a large number of cabin and steerage passengers from England and the Continent. The Normannia of the Hamburg-American Packet Line brought among her cabin passengers the Hon.

1890-11-17T00:00:00Z,"New-Yorkers who are fond of apples have doubtless noticed an absence from the fruit stores and the stands of street vendors of those varieties that in past years have been plentiful. Baldwins and Greenings, which for many years have been the principal apples in the market at this season of the year, are scarcely to be found this year."
1890-11-17T00:00:00Z,"In the maelstrom of Wall Street speculation another old and supposedly reliable firm of bankers and brokers has been wrecked. Mills, Robeson Smith, doing business at 96 Broadway, have gone under, not because of their inability to stand against the panic that last week swept through the market, but because of the confessed dishonesty of the junior partner, Albert H. Smith."
1890-11-17T00:00:00Z,"But three more days remain for racing over what are called the Summer race tracks, to distinguish them from the Guttenberg and Clifton courses, where Winter racing is made a specialty.

ROGERS were Republican supporters of Mr. HARRISON."
1890-11-17T00:00:00Z,"It is natural that Secretary PROCTOR should dwell, in his annual report, upon the present year's important legislation for the army, and upon what is further needed to make the service attractive.

Last Spring and Winter half a dozen Mormon missionaries made their appearance in various parts of Franklin, Fulion, and Adams Counties, and assiduously, but secretly, pursued the work of roselyting innocent farmers and their families to the Mormon faith. They intentionally chose the most secluded localities, those furthest distant from railroad stations and local commercial centres."

1890-11-18T00:00:00Z,"Ex-Gov. John McEnery of Louisiana, who is an out-and-out Democrat, was until last week very much prejudiced against Grover Cleveland. He had never heard Mr. Cleveland talk and had gained the impression that he was far from being the statesman that other good Democrats declared him to be.

1890-11-18T00:00:00Z,"WASHINGTON, Nov. 17. -- There can be no sort of doubt from many indications that Hill is determined to be responsible for something in national affairs, even if he is obliged to crowd himself in.

1890-11-27T00:00:00Z,"It is difficult to believe that the Republicans in Congress will seriously undertake the passage of the Lodge Elections bill, otherwise, and very justly, known as the Force bill.

Hill is perfectly willing to be United States Senator, and that, all other considerations aside, he cannot afford to throw away an office which so big a man as Roscoe Conkling preferred to the Presidency. The Governor has unquestionably grown more reserved since election day."
1890-11-27T00:00:00Z,"So much of the contention over Africa is made by England, Germany, Portugal, and Italy that comparatively few people may know that France has a larger part of the Dark Continent under her control than any of these countries and than any other power.

1890-11-28T00:00:00Z,"There was a general interchange of calls yesterday among the Brazilian and American Navy officers in port. This was permissible for the first time since the arrival of the Brazilians, inasmuch as the custom of the services prohibits junior officers paying visits before all official courtesies have been disposed of. From the fact that Rear Admiral da Silveira did not leave the Aquidaban before 9:30 A.M., no calls were made earlier than that hour."
1890-11-28T00:00:00Z,"Down where the rippling waters of Jamaica Bay caress the soggy shore of Canarsie the Stony Lonesome banquet was held yesterday.

1890-11-28T00:00:00Z,"BALTIMORE, Nov. 27. -- Maryland Republicans are going to try to reorganize. Their present condition is sadly demoralized.

1890-11-28T00:00:00Z,"No degree of public censure and no penalty the law can visit upon the persons responsible for the disaster at the Brooklyn Eastern Park yesterday will surpass their just desert.

1890-11-28T00:00:00Z,"Yale's victory at Eastern Park yesterday ought to go far toward consoling her for last Saturday's defeat, especially in view of its remarkable score of 32 to 0 against such a college as Princeton. It is certainly an ample revenge for last year's triumph of the orange and black, which showed so much smaller a score."
1890-11-28T00:00:00Z,"While their punishment in this instance will be sufficient to deter the managers of the Eastern Park from putting human life in peril in their future speculative ventures, it cannot be urged in their behalf that there was any lack of warnings of the terrible consequences likely to result from their negligence. Disasters of this nature have been sufficiently frequent and numerous to remove every shadow of excuse for their recurrence."
1890-11-28T00:00:00Z,"Yale won. From the crimson field of Hampden Park she raised her trailing colors and rallied her beaten forces to sweep down upon Princeton yesterday with irresistible force.

Prieu, a merchant who carried on business for many years in Brazil, has brought an action against the Government of the French Republic for the respectable sum of 560,000, for damages he alleges to have sustained through the action of a French Consul.

1890-12-13T00:00:00Z,The Reapportionment bill favorably treated by the Ceases Committee of the House has one very evident fault to the support of which the Democratic members of the committee prudently refrained from committing themselves.

1890-12-14T00:00:00Z,"A SPANISH CALIFORNIA WEDDING. -- Nothing was more attractive than the wedding cavalcade on its way from the bride's house to the mission church.

1890-12-14T00:00:00Z,Very many people familiar with the book-publishing business will recognize the force of what Mr. Moncure D. Conway says in his communication published in your columns this morning. A careful study of the provisions at the new Copyright bill shows that solicitude for justice to the lean and hungry author is to a great extent secondary to a regard for the fat and prosperous publisher.
1890-12-14T00:00:00Z,"At the present juncture, when, after so long a delay, an international copyright law seems likely to be enacted, it may not be deemed inopportune to recall the efforts made in its behalf some half century ago, when Henry Clay strenuously urged its claims, in which Washington Irving, Bancroft, Bryant, Longfellow, and most of the leaders of thought of that day co-operated."

1890-12-14T00:00:00Z,"Another queer marriage, and even queerer comments, upon it, show what very hard work is made of what is, or at least is meant to be, the very simplest of all simple things. The intent of the laws of New-York is that no honest man or woman who means to marry shall miss doing so by informality. All other contracts are hedged about with precautions."

The flights some birds will take, moreover, are extraordinary phenomena in themselves. A falcon belonging to Henry IV. of France is known to have flown from Fountainebleau to Malta, a distance of 1,350 miles, in one day."

1890-12-14T00:00:00Z,"One interesting feature of Mr. Fayerweather's will is that he has not fettered his benevolences with conditions that limit their efficiency.

What nature refuses to do art is determined to accomplish, and though no snow may sparkle beneath the sunshine, the Christmas festivities will not lack the beauty of glistening, frosty radiance."
1890-12-24T00:00:00Z,The McKinley papers in the West are still talking about goods that were imported just before the new tariff law went into effect and that are still held under bond in the Government warehouses. The Chicago Inter Ocean of the 22d inst. said:
1890-12-24T00:00:00Z,"LONDON, Dec. 23. -- Michael Davitt's newspaper, the Labor World, to-day renews the onslaught recently made upon Mr. Parnell through its columns.

1890-12-24T00:00:00Z,"WASHINGTON, Dec. 23. -- Representative Burton of Ohio to-day introduced in the House a bill to amend the Inter-State Commerce act by adding thereto a section relative to a railroad doing business partly in the United States and partly in adjacent foreign countries. It requires such a company to obtain from the Inter-State Commerce Commission a license or permit to engage in such business."
1890-12-24T00:00:00Z,"ST. LOUIS, Dec. 23. -- The recent political campaign, which resulted so disastrously to the Republicans in Missouri as elsewhere, has proved fruitful of heartburnings, and since the election the air has been heavy with charges and countercharges of responsibility for the disaster."
1890-12-24T00:00:00Z,"Yesterday Commissioner BEATTIE laid before the Senate committee a cheerful estimate that with an initial expenditure for ""plant"" of $266,537.50 the streets of this city could be thoroughly cleaned by the block system for $2,189,184 per year. If machine sweeping were retained in part, with a ""plant"" costing $271,254.25 to start with, the work might be done for $1,636,099.90."
1890-12-24T00:00:00Z,"CHICAGO, Dec. 23. -- The hearing in the County Court touching the failure of the private bank of S.A. Kean Co. was continued to-day.

Mr. Culver, on the witness stand to-day, testified that he did not owe the bank anything; on the contrary, the bank owed him over $200."

1890-12-24T00:00:00Z,"If as seems probable, the discussion of the Force bill is drawing to a close, the leaders of each party can review the general course of that discussion and draw some inferences as to the showing made by their respective followers. We confess that, on the whole, there has not been much in the innumerable speeches that have used up the first third of the session that is particularly creditable to either side."
1890-12-24T00:00:00Z,"The art of illustration has made enormous strides during late years, and during Christmastide we are apt to be impressed by the fact more vividly than at other time of the year. The quality of illustrations in books advances steadily when regarded broadly, though it might be held that it is a rise of the average rather than an appearance of books better illustrated, better printed, better bound than the best of former periods."
1890-12-24T00:00:00Z,"ST. PAUL, Dec. 23. -- Two years ago Mrs. Annice G. Barteau was happily married and had $300,000 in her own right. To-day she is divorced against her will and made penniless by a decree of the Supreme Court of Minnesota."

1890-12-24T00:00:00Z,"Once in eight years the army of the United States deserts -- that is, the total number of desertions during eight years equals the number of soldiers receiving pay at any one time. In order to counteract this tendency to desert, orders have recently been issued by the War Department to all the recruiting stations throughout the United States, which will have the effect of improving the service to a marked degree."

1890-12-25T00:00:00Z,"The bold young Kaiser is about to continue his royal journeyings with a trip to Paris, on the way to Cannes and San Remo. It is hardly possible that he expects political results of value to the Fatherland to flow from his sojourn in the French capital. He is not to stop at the German Embassy, having a frugal regard for the windows of that mansion, and he is to preserve ""a strict incognito."""
1890-12-25T00:00:00Z,"PINE RIDGE AGENCY, S.D., Dec. 24. -- There was mounting in hot haste here to-day when the news came that 200 of the Sioux braves who surrendered to Col. Sumner had escaped and were on their way to the Bad Lands."
1890-12-25T00:00:00Z,"BOULOGNE, Dec. 24. -- In an interview to-day Justin McCarthy declared that his idea in coming here was to inform Mr. O'Brien fully in regard to recent events in Ireland.

1890-12-25T00:00:00Z,"Laggard shoppers were scurrying from shop to shop yesterday making their final Christmas purchases, but they were few in numbers as compared to the vast multitudes that have been thronging the streets for a fortnight. They represented chiefly that large class of persons who put off everything until the last moment and who then rush madly to its accomplishment."
1890-12-25T00:00:00Z,"BOSTON, Dec. 24. -- At an adjourned meeting of the creditors of G.W.

1890-12-25T00:00:00Z,"It is sincerely hoped in progressive naval circles that the appropriation of $25,000 for State naval militia will be passed by Congress. There are at present two State naval militia organizations, one in Boston and one in New-York. So far Congress has ignored these organizations. They are in need of small arms, accoutrements, in fact, in need of everything but what has been contributed by the individual members."
1890-12-25T00:00:00Z,"The most striking of recent suggestions for the management of reservation Indians is the one made by Mr. FREDERIC REMINGTON in Harper' Weekly.

1890-12-25T00:00:00Z,"CLEVELAND, Dec. 24. -- The disgust aroused in this city by the nomination of City Solicitor Brinsmade for the vacant office of United States District Attorney is finding vent in other ways than expressions of individual feeling. The Franklin Club is an organization of radicals who call themselves Nationalists, but it is usually on the popular side in regard to local questions, and it often expresses the sentiments of almost the whole community."
1890-12-25T00:00:00Z,"NEW-HAVEN, Dec. 24. -- A notable incident of the decline of New-England farming is recorded in one of the most fertile parts of the East, the Connecticut Valley. Little City is in the town of Haddam and contains some fairly prosperous farms, but the decline referred to is there.

1890-12-25T00:00:00Z,"Now that the treatment of incipient consumption with the Koch lymph is well under way in New-York, with favorable auspices, the medical profession is turning its attention to cancer, that other terrible disease of which humanity has long been an almost helpless victim, with the purpose of learning whether it, too, can be cured with the new remedy."
1890-12-25T00:00:00Z,"In appointing BRINSMADE to be District Attorney for the Northern District of Ohio, Mr. HARRISON and his Attorney General appear to have been moved by considerations like those which induced them to nominate Col. CLAYTON to be District Attorney for the Western District of Arkansas, and to stand by this nomination after the disgraceful history of the opening of Oklahoma had been laid before the country in the reports of two Republican officers."
1890-12-25T00:00:00Z,"Some of the German Catholic churches have been decorated more extensively this year than usual.

1890-12-25T00:00:00Z,"Quite naturally, PARNELL and the Parnellites are now engaged in belittling their defeat at Kilkenny. It was a ""preliminary skirmish"" only and it was lost through ""treachery"" and the influence of the priesthood. But this line of explanation does not deceive anybody who is not anxious to be deceived. ""Treachery"" is by no means an unprecedented element in Irish or any other political contests."
1890-12-25T00:00:00Z,"The attacks made on Senator DON CAMERON in his own State by organs of his own party doubtless arise from motives purely personal or factional. They are interesting to outsiders only on account of their avowed basis, which is the Senator's opposition to the Force bill. That, in the opinion of impartial observers, is the most creditable incident in a career which, through long, has not been crowded with evidences of either sense or independence."
1890-12-25T00:00:00Z,"The ice at Van Cortlandt Lake is in firs-rate condition. That suburban skating resort has never possessed more attractions for skaters, and it is being appreciated by thousands of lovers of the sport. While easy of access by the New-York and Northern Railway, it is yet far enough from the city to avoid some of the disadvantages of a city skating ground, and is therefore especially popular."

1890-12-26T00:00:00Z,"Caricaturists continue to give a considerable deal of trouble to Parisian magistrates, and a few eccentric strokes of the pencil frequently evoke long legal disquisitions which are not altogether devoid of entertainment.

1890-12-26T00:00:00Z,"To be present at any of our Western Indian Agencies on ""issue day"" is worth many miles of travel. The selection of the day of the week on which rations are distributed rests entirely with the agent, but for years in the Southwest the day has been Friday. At San Carlos, for instance, where about 5,000 Indians are fed and cared for, a just distribution of the weekly allowance is no easy task."

1890-12-26T00:00:00Z,"One of the most instructive an oftentimes most amusing features of a court in operation is the way in which the presiding Judge keeps order. The natural tendency when the wheels of justice are going around is toward noise. The lawyers, of course, feel that they must do something to make their clients believe they are earning their fees, and occasionally the Judge adds his voice."
1890-12-26T00:00:00Z,"The most dangerous counterfeit ever known in the history of the coinage of this Government has been found by the authorities of the Mint in this city.

1890-12-28T00:00:00Z,The announcement that a special gun is under construction at the Washington Ordnance Yard for the purpose of using shells charged with emmensite sufficiently indicates the hopes that are entertained by the Navy Ordnance Bureau of this new high explosive. The system of armor for our ships is now practically settled; so is that of our heavy guns; while even the question of projectiles is also far advanced toward solution.
1890-12-28T00:00:00Z,"The presentment of the Grand Jury upon the care of ""casuals"" and upon the appointment of police matrons should receive the early attention of the incoming Legislature. Obviously the care of persons who find themselves at night in the city without the means of paying for even the shelter of the cheapest lodging houses is not the proper business of the police."
1890-12-28T00:00:00Z,"DENVER, Col., Dec. 27. -- A News special from Creston, S.D., via Rapid City, S.D., by courier, says:"

1890-12-28T00:00:00Z,"THE EYES OF DEEP-SEA FISH. -- The queerest thing about deep-sea creatures is their arrangements for vision. Fish that live at very great depths have either no eyes at all or enormously big ones. Indeed, there are two ways you may get on in these gloomy abysses -- by delicate touch organs, or by sight that collects the few rays of light due to phosphorescence or other accidental sources."
1890-12-28T00:00:00Z,"The return of our Summer birds, after Winter has passed, is quite generally noted. But it is doubtful if nearly as many people ever note down the dates on which our birds leave in the Autumn. If they did, very possibly we would have predictions of cold or of mild Winters, based on their early or late departures, as well as by the advent of northern birds, such as the arctic owl."
1890-12-28T00:00:00Z,"LAKEWOOD, Dec. 27. -- Lakewood's Christmas was homelike, social, and merry. The New-York trains of Wednesday brought large additions to the number of guests at the hotels and cottages, every one of which was crowded. The decorations at the Laurel House were elaborate and tasteful in holly and evergreen, and the cottages were made attractive with the same materials."
1890-12-28T00:00:00Z,"Christmas tide has brought for the first time in some years seasonable weather, and the social world has made merry in town and country all the more in consequence. While the snow delayed its advent just a few hours too long to make Thursday other than a ""green Christmas,"" its coming was too surely foretold to allow of any croakings or depression on the part of even the most superstitious."
1890-12-28T00:00:00Z,"HOW SPIDERS KILL. -- Spiders kill their prey by the agency of a poisonous fluid, which is secreted in a gland, and which flows at will to the extremity of one of the fauces or jaws. Some writers have denied the existence of this poisonous substances but the effects which a spider's bite have been known to have upon a human being prove undoubtedly that it is present."
1890-12-28T00:00:00Z,"THE HISTORIC SCROLL OF EGYPT. -- The chronicles of Egypt are written on a scroll of such vast proportions that we often fail to realize them as a continuous record. Egypt is referred to as Ptolemaic, Roman, Arab, , as if the racial characteristics changed with the various dynasties. But the ancient race, the veritable descendants of the builders of the pyramids, still exists."
1890-12-28T00:00:00Z,"BOSTON, Dec. 27. -- Boston has had a book boom. Doubtless holiday goods generally have found ready sale, but the characteristic Boston trade has centred to an unusual extent upon books. The sales at the leading bookstores have been phenomenal, exceeding those of years more financially prosperous. Art gift books have not been the popular choice; for reasons not easy to define the current has set suddenly against them."
1890-12-28T00:00:00Z,"MOOR BATHS. -- The moor baths, of which much is now heard, and which are provided at many Austrian and German health resorts, were first used at Franzensbad. In 1823, Dr. Poschmann, a physician there, believed that he had found in them a new curative medium, and they have since become popular. Some physicians still question their efficacy, while others in Austria and Germany rely upon them to render good service in many maladies."

1890-12-28T00:00:00Z,"INSCRIPTIONS ON OLD STAINED GLASS. -- Most of the fragments of ancient stained glass handed down to us have inscriptions and dates introduced either on scrolls in the hands of the personages depicted or in some other manner. In the east window of the chapel in Haddon Hall, Derbyshire, for instance, we may read: ""Orate proai'abus Ricardi Vernon et Jenette uxoris ejus qui fecerunt ano dni milesimo CCCCXXVII."""
1890-12-28T00:00:00Z,"SIAMESE GIBBONS. -- I only once saw a specimen of the siamang in captivity at the house of a Malay chief at Sirdang. It was about three feet high, but the stretch of its arms was over five feet. A sad-looking, depressed creature it seemed as it moved awkwardly about the floor, tripping itself up with its own arms; but once among the rafters of the roof it moved with the agility of a spider."
1890-12-28T00:00:00Z,"The private secretary of a railroad man who is supposed to be worth $10,000,000 remarked yesterday that, if ""the very rich"" millionaires got as many begging letters prior to Christmas as did his employer, there was an unprecedented amount of begging done through the mails this year. ""Persons who beg by letter,"" said he, ""almost invariably name the amount of money that they desire to have sent to them."
1890-12-28T00:00:00Z,"Book collectors occasionally make lucky finds. No more than three weeks ago Mr. George P. Philes, the eminent authority upon Americans, and especially New-York and Philadelphia imprints, quite unexpectedly, while glancing over the books upon the ten-cent stand of an old book store of this city, come upon the first American edition of the ""Vicar of Wakefield,"" printed in Philadelphia for William Mentz, and sold by most of the booksellers in America, 1772."
1890-12-28T00:00:00Z,"Once every year the local political organizations undergo a process of reorganization and rehabilitation through the medium of the primary election. The reorganization thus brought about differs in extent according to the needs of the party. The primaries this year will be particularly interesting in the Republican camp. The last election left the Republican local machine in a sadly damaged condition, whereas it left Tammany in practically better shape than ever."
1890-12-28T00:00:00Z,"THE LITERATURE OF THIBET. -- Thibetan literature to chiefly Buddhistic, but not wholly so. The capital of Thibet Lhasa, (""the seat of the gods,"") is indeed the Rome of Buddhism, and in no other country does that religion attract higher patronage, and nowhere else is its philosophy more ardently studied."
1890-12-28T00:00:00Z,MARX'S DOCTRINE. -- Marx's doctrine of the production of relative surplus value necessarily implies that as capital grows strong labor grows weak; that as the wealth of the capitalist accumulates the poverty of the laborer increases. Almost all modern Socialists have come to the same conclusion.
1890-12-28T00:00:00Z,"Many rivers flow through forest-clad Western Washington, flow from the eternal snow banks of the Cascade Range to Puget Sound or to the heaving water of the Pacific Ocean. Hundreds, yes, thousands, of smaller rivers, brooks, and creaks flow; some slowly as become streams of size, up which enormous salmon ascend to spawn; others with roars as of laughter rush in foam through boulder-strewn gorges to tumble down sloping falls"
1890-12-28T00:00:00Z,"PARIS, Dec. 27. -- The announcement made in the newspapers of this city that the formal conference between the Irish leaders will take place on Monday next is officially stated to be premature. Mr. O'Brien has not yet seen Mr. Parnell."

Since holiday cards first appeared there has never been such a dearth of thein as now. Booklets there are in plenty, and many of them quite pretty, but the genuine card is not among them."
1890-12-28T00:00:00Z,"The laws concerning the holding and government of slaves in the early days of the American colonies present some curious features and contain provisions little known to the reading public of these days.

1890-12-28T00:00:00Z,"BURTON A MANY-SIDED MAN. -- He and I were only visitors, and had no official connection with the congress: the Royal Geographical Society, if I mistake not, was represented by its President, Lord Aberdare, who chanced to be passing by that way; but all the geographical societies of foreign nations had sent strong deputations, and men of science of all kinds had assembled from far and wide."

1890-12-28T00:00:00Z,"Incur Washington dispatches yesterday morning there was an explanation of Senator ALDRICH'S extraordinary move in regard to shutting off debate in the Senate that, whether correct or erroneous, is extremely significant. It was that the Senator from Rhode Island had introduced his proposition for closure in the most offensive form possible in order to provoke a prolonged debate and prevent any action in regard to silver legislation at the present session."

Charles Andre given an account of his experiences when on a botanical expedition by the shores of the River Amboan, which, though interesting to read when safe at home, gives a good idea of the unexpectod dangers often incurred by botanical collectors. M. Andre was in search of Cxlogyne asperata and happened to be in a Dyak hut when the natives were sorting rice preparatory to sowing it."
1890-12-28T00:00:00Z,"The figure of the Speaker of the House of Representatives is so familiar that it hardly warrants description. A tall man, of large and clumsy proportions, with a round, plump face and a cool, bold eye, carelessly clothed and unconcerned in his movements -- such, in brief, is Thomas B. Reed. His predecessor, Carlisle, now Senator from Kentucky, is as unlike him in appearance as it is possible for him to be."
1890-12-28T00:00:00Z,The Secret Service Bureau in this city is not a widely-advertised place and the methods used in detecting the counterfeit money men are kept as close as the name of the bureau would imply. Outside of the office itself there is probably not any one who knows how many men are employed in running down those who make and sell the base coin or counterfeit the bills.
1890-12-28T00:00:00Z,"PARIS, Dec. 27. -- Notwithstanding the protests made by Mr. Ribot, Minister of Foreign Affairs, and M.

1890-12-28T00:00:00Z,"There is scarcely any form of property bought for pleasure that of late years has returned to its possessor in this city so small a return in pleasure upon his investment as a sleigh. Last Winter and the Winter before the sleighs of the metropolis industriously gathered mold in their lofts.

1890-12-28T00:00:00Z,"The immediate occasion of this query is the recent remark of an esteemed contemporary. Just what that remark was does not matter at this time. It was not at all sour or discourteous, but it revealed a tendency to look upon those who disagreed with it as Wagnerites; and a Wagnerite, dear reader, is more to be dreaded than a Hittite or a Jebusite or a Canaanite or oven a Harlemite."
1890-12-28T00:00:00Z,"President MICHAEL COLEMAN'S letter to the Deputy Tax Commissioners reproves in temperate language the perpetrators of a gross public abuse.

1890-12-28T00:00:00Z,"An English gentleman who has lived many years in India tells some queer stories about the sacred monkeys that are a great nuisance in some parts of that country.

Are his premises correct? He says: ""It is a time of profound peace."" Is this true, in the sense his words convey? A true peace implies the happy mud contented condition of the plain people. Was there ever so much unrest and discontent?"
1890-12-28T00:00:00Z,"The all-absorbing topic at the Union League Club is the election of club officers which will be held at the January meeting. There have been rumors that Mr. Depew wished to retire from the Presidency, and that his name will not appear on the ticket. The contrary is the case.

In the course of the proceedings on Wednesday in the Senate, Mr. MORTON being in the chair, exercising the modest functions attributed by the Constitution to the Vice President, made a decision on a point of order which was appealed from."
1891-01-03T00:00:00Z,"ST. PAUL, Minn., Jan. 2. -- St. Paul was full of swearing farmers to-day.

1891-01-03T00:00:00Z,"The newly-elected officials of Queens County took the oath of office and were duly qualified to act by filing their bonds with the Board of Supervisors in Long Island City yesterday.

1891-01-03T00:00:00Z,"Italy, which keeps in the front rank in naval construction and appliances, is credited with being so well satisfied with her recent experiments in the use of petroleum for the fuel of war vessels as to propose introducing it very largely into her fleet. If its advantages are so great, Russia and America, with their oil resources, ought not to be distanced in its application by Italy."
1891-01-03T00:00:00Z,"WASHINGTON, Jan. 2. -- The session of the Senate to-day lasted only long enough for the Chaplain to pray and the Secretary to read the Journal of the last sitting. The adjournment was until Monday, so that the New Year's lull in the Force bill debate will last two days longer. Beginning Monday, however, there are not likely to be many more dull days in the Senate for the remaining two months of the session."
1891-01-03T00:00:00Z,"Little James Halloran, who was only nine years old, lives with his parents at 222 First Street, Hoboken. He went out with two companions to make New Year's calls on Thursday and returned in the evening so intoxicated that he fell on the floor half unconscious. His mother and little sister put him to bed and then went out to spend the afternoon. When they came back, lafe in the evening, they found James ead."
1891-01-03T00:00:00Z,"One more change in the affairs of Uganda has taken place. The Arabs have been routed in battle, the Christians have the upper hand again, and they have joyfully opened a new church and baptized many of the natives. The kingdom must have had a surfeit of war during the last two or three years from foes without and foes within."
1891-01-03T00:00:00Z,"MACON, Ga., Jan. 2. -- The trial of the Dodge County conspirators for the murder of Capt Forsyth, in the United States District Court, Judge Speer, is now closed, so far as the evidence is concerned, and will be given to the jury, probably to-morrow, or as soon as the lawyers get through with their arguments."
1891-01-03T00:00:00Z,"The fog which yesterday enveloped the city in its dripping mantle for fourteen mortal hours, with its consequent and accompanying stifling atmosphere, stalled trains, and universal mud, was calculated to play havoc with many a laudable resolution of the day before. Although dubbed by the Weather Bureau as ""local,"" it extended its depressing influence over nearly one thousand square miles of territory."
1891-01-03T00:00:00Z,"KANSAS CITY, Mo., Jan. 2. -- Boone County, Mo., is just now in the throes of an immense sensation, which has forced its way to the surface in spite of most heroic efforts to suppress it, owing to the fact that the politics of the State will be agitated by the discovery, and the carefully-laid plans of well-known and ambitions men will be seriously disarranged by the developments."
1891-01-03T00:00:00Z,"At the twenty-fourth National Encampment of the Grand Army of the Republic, held in Boston in August last, a resolution was adopted recommending the removal of the body of Gen. U.S. Grant to the National Cemetery at Arlington, Va., near Washington, D.C.

1891-01-03T00:00:00Z,"Against most varieties of injurious weather civilization has provided more or less effective defenses, but it seems to be still quite helpless against fog. London has more than once suffered an absolute embargo of traffic and even of movement, which, if it had lasted two or three times as long, might have resulted in the deaths from starvation of people abundantly supplied with money in a city abundantly supplied with food."
1891-01-03T00:00:00Z,"NEW-HAVEN, Conn., Jan. 2. -- The Democratic State Central Committee in this city to-day re-elected Clinton B. Davis Chairman. The second and decisive ballot resulted: Davis, 13; W.H. Talmadge of Stamford, 9."

1891-01-03T00:00:00Z,"PITTSBURG, Penn., Jan. 2. -- The river to-night is twenty-two feet and rising slowly. Several ice gorges have passed down, but everything in the city is quiet, with the exception of Allegheny River men, who are drawing boats and flats nearer shore and making all taut. The Pittsburg and Western tracks are covered, but it is thought the cold snap stopped the flood in time to save damage here at least."
1891-01-03T00:00:00Z,"Thirty-eight young men from Harvard College descended on the Fifth Avenue Hotel yesterday, arriving in time for breakfast. But for once the presence of a college crowd was not a synonym for noise, and the fact that such a crowd of unbridled youngsters vas in the hotel vas unknown to the other guests, unless they looked at the register."

1891-01-03T00:00:00Z,"LONDON, Jan. 2. -- The Daily Telegraph (Conservative), in its issue of to-day, invites the followers of Mr. Gladstone to recognize manfully the distasteful fact that home rule for Ireland is defunct. The present policy of the Liberal party, the Telegraph thinks, is certain to give way to a different programme, while the party itself will at the same time have to make new combinations. The paper says:"
1891-01-03T00:00:00Z,"CHICAGO, Jan. 2. -- Messrs. Armour, Morris, and Swift, of the big packing firms, declare that the statement in a dispatch from St. Louis to the effect that they were about to purchase the Union Stock Yards at that city and the National Stock Yards at East St. Louis is untrue."

Of a sudden both horses fell to the ground. Van Ness leaped from his wagon, and, under the impression that the horses had slipped on the ice, proceeded to unharness them. The moment he touched the iron traces he received an electric shook that almost paralyzed him."

1891-01-03T00:00:00Z,"HURON, S.D., Jan. 2. -- The joint conference of independent and Democratic members of the Legislature this afternoon failed to come to any definite conclusion concerning the United States Senatorship.

1891-01-04T00:00:00Z,"THE DANGERS OF HYPNOTISM. -- At Nancy I have seen a young woman return on three consecutive mornings to be hypnotized for a headache! After each seance she expressed herself as feeling quite relieved. Now, if the hypnotic cure of a headache has to be repeated three consecutive mornings, it has nothing to boast of over simpler remedies, whereas it may, as I have shown, be but substituting a dangerous neurosis for a headache."
1891-01-04T00:00:00Z,"Mr. A.C. Welles of South Dakota, who has lived for many years in the Indian country, and who is a grandnephew of President Lincoln's Secretary of the Navy, says that the present Indian troubles are such as would not have occurred had the army officers been left to deal with the redskins as they alone can deal with them."

1891-01-04T00:00:00Z,"CHILD LIFE INSURANCE. -- It is miserable to a patriot to think how these collectors of premiums upon child death policies openly, week by week, call at doors within which, the neighbors believe, a child is being slowly neglected to death -- a fact, by the way, with which the canvasser has no concern. His one and sole duty is to get business, and getting it, to keep it."
1891-01-04T00:00:00Z,"If M. Henri Welschinger is one of the most fortunate searchers in the national archives it is not only because of his activity -- others as active find nothing startling -- but because of his independence. He has no prejudices, no partialities, no masters to serve."

1891-01-04T00:00:00Z,"The movement which was begun at Albany last Friday, having for its object the raising of the prices of straw wrapping paper, is not an absolute novelty.

1891-01-04T00:00:00Z,"BOSTON, Jan. 3. -- To-day the Boston and Maine's ""Supplement No. 6 and Tariff No. 66"" went into effect, making still another drop of 75 cents in second-class passenger fare from Boston to Chicago, and a proportionate reduction to other points West. The Boston and Maine still adhere to their old position that they are entitled to $1.25 differential over the Fitchburg on the second-class passenger business which they send West via Montreal or Norwood."

1891-01-04T00:00:00Z,"Familiarity with those nationalities, Dutch or Celtic, which first peopled the Mohawk Valley would not have alone sufficed in drawing the remarkable picture Mr. Harold Frederic presents. A high literary sentiment was a necessity. Douw Mauverensen, in whose veins there runs the Van Hoorn blood, shows his Frisian origin, some little tempered by new surroundings."
1891-01-04T00:00:00Z,""" Her Point of View,"" the admirable melange of feminine gossip which THE NEW-YORK TIMES prints each Sunday, recently quotes a lawyer who had employed women stenographers and typewriters as saying: ""I find it hard to get them to come down to solid business and avoid nonsense. They are liable to become offended because people coming in on business are not nice in their manners."
1891-01-04T00:00:00Z,"Mr. Anstey in an amusing manner constructs a series of little comedies taken from modern social life, as the ""Pastoral Play,"" when the Brandesbury Brown's at their villa in North Kensington present ""The Tempest"" of a rainy day. The fun is very light and always proper. But English fun is not American."
1891-01-04T00:00:00Z,"ALBANY, Jan. 3. -- Old-timers who have been present at the assembling of every Legislature since the palmy days of Thurlow Weed, fall to recall an occasion where every peg was firmly adjusted, and so little was known of it. Four, perhaps five men understand the situation, know how the committees are arranged, and how the plums and biscuits are to be parceled out."
1891-01-04T00:00:00Z,"ALBANY, Jan. 3. -- Social gayeties began somewhat earlier than usual in Albany this Winter. Perhaps the continued cold weather -- the temperature during December was below the normal -- and the bountiful supply of snow had their influence."
1891-01-04T00:00:00Z,"Engineers generally are discussing the Broadway project for a common subway for pipes and a railway tunnel. The views of Chief Engineer Birdsall, as expressed yesterday in THE TIMES, have confirmed the impressions of many of them, however, that the undertaking as a whole is to be criticised chiefly because of the expense which it would involve."
1891-01-04T00:00:00Z,"The election at the Union League will be held next Thursday evening. The ticket selected by the Nominating Committee is announced as being a compromise one, arranged to satisfy the demands of the members who desire to make the social life in the club of more importance than the political features. As a matter of fact, the new ticket is almost identical with that of last year, and the changes are very slight and unimportant."
1891-01-04T00:00:00Z,"TRENTON, N.J., Jan 3. -- The new year didn't come in very happily for the thousands of employes in the highly-protected Jersey manufactories. The assurance that the miseries of Christmas week would not be repeated this week, which the Republican organs so confidently gave, proved as false as most of the predictions of the protectionists."
1891-01-04T00:00:00Z,"The conflagration which threatened to destroy two blocks on Broadway in the dark hours of yesterday morning proved, in the daylight to have been less disastrous than it then appeared. Between 1 and 2 o'clock A.M it looked as though both the Fifth Avenue Theatre and Herrmann's Theatre would be totally destroyed, and the Sturtevant House on the opposite side of Broadway would be do damaged as to prevent occupancy."
1891-01-04T00:00:00Z,"The affairs of the Berkeley Athletic Club are in a very unsettled state. In fact, over since the organization was started by a stock company, known at first as the Berkeley Lyceum Association, the athletic club has been resting on a rather weak foundation, owing to the manner in which it has been governed."
1891-01-04T00:00:00Z,"LONDON, Jan 3. -- Mr. Parnell sent no congratulatory message to Mr. Gladstone on his birthday at the close of the old year, and Prince Bismarck exchanged no greetings with the Kaiser upon the advent of the new year.

1891-01-04T00:00:00Z,"ENGLISH PATENTS. -- The immense increase in the number of patents granted is partly due to the increased facilities afforded by recent legislation. But, down to 1852, the old, absurd method which provoked the satire of Dickens in his ""History of a Patent"" was allowed to continue in full force."
1891-01-04T00:00:00Z,""" French soirees"" are a recent London fad. As their name indicates, they are evenings of French with programmes which include French conversation, recitations, and readings, with music, tea, and coffee. The fashion might be introduced in New-York society with the really profitable result of improving many social amateurs in the French language."
1891-01-04T00:00:00Z,"BALTIMORE, Jan. 3. -- The bal poudre on Wednesday evening was a brilliant affair and undoubtedly the great event of the Winter. Most of the subscription entertainments which are given through the season are of a rather unsatisfactory kind and are, in fact, nothing more than dances in the confined sense of the word, at which no suppers or refreshments are served, with the exception of ices and cake."
1891-01-04T00:00:00Z,"A SONG IN JAPANESE. -- From many a house as we pass, especially at evening, is heard the tinkling samisen, or the thrum of the stronger-voiced koto. Every house seems to contain a samisen, the three-stringed guitar of Japan, having a long, black neck, unprovided with frets, and a square sounding body covered by stretched catskin."
1891-01-04T00:00:00Z,"One of the liveliest conferences in the history of amateur athletic sports occurred yesterday afternoon at the Lawyers' Club, and was continued last evening at the Astor House. At midnight the conference committees of the Amateur Athletic Union and League of American Wheelmen were still in session at the Astor House, discussing the question of the payment of the expenses of athletes to games, which question has agitated these two organizations for so long."
1891-01-04T00:00:00Z,"The short time intervening between New Year's Day and Ash Wednesday this year will make necessary a rapid succession of entertainments if all the elegant toilets prepared are to be displayed. A beautiful dinner dress, which its owner is not likely to neglect, is of gold and white brocade, and the richest of green velvet, both materials being wisely permitted to fall in unbroken folds."
1891-01-04T00:00:00Z,"The Webster's Unabridged with which we are familiar was a sufficiently useful book and a dictionary so full and up to the times that a revised edition was hardly expected. But the edition of 1884 was not out before the plans were laid for another issue which should surpass that one, excellent as it was."
1891-01-04T00:00:00Z,"The Sun has been engaged for a long time past in abusing Mr. Cleveland and in booming Mr. Hill. Its frantic efforts are worthy of a paper which has never had the political confidence of Democrats. Heretofore it has been an assistant of our political enemies. It was treacherous toward Hancock. It supported Butler in 1884, and in 1888 it did its best, in an underhanded and deceitful way, to defeat Cleveland."
1891-01-04T00:00:00Z,"NEW-ORLEANS, Jan. 3. -- In the United States Circuit Court to-day, on motion of District Attorney Grant, fifty-five informations pending against the late M.A. Dauphin were dismissed. They were all for violating the section relative to lottery tickets and circulars in the mails. One test case was tried in 1884, when all the informations were filed, and as an acquittal resulted no further effort at prosecution was made."

They all live in numerous associations made up of many studs, each of which consists of a number of mares under the leadership of a male."
1891-01-04T00:00:00Z,"LAKEWOOD, Jan. 3. -- Good sleighing and skating added materially to the pleasures of the Lakewood season during the first three days of this week. These facilities for enjoyment were not included in last year's programme. There was then hardly more than a glimpse of snow and scarcely a skimming of ice on the lakes. Sleighing parties and skating parties from the hotels and cottages made the most of their brief opportunity this season."
1891-01-04T00:00:00Z,"Much curiosity was manifested in naval circles yesterday concerning the department's intention regarding the United States steamer Yantic, now at the Brooklyn Navy Yard. This vessel was detached from Rear Admiral Gherardi's squadron last Summer, and since then has been undergoing extensive repairs and alterations necessary to fit the vessel for service as an apprentice training ship."
1891-01-04T00:00:00Z,"The news of the death at Berlin of Dr. Henry Schliemann, the great Grecian archaeologist, recalled to many of the older German residents of this city that he at one time lived here. ""Oh, yes,"" replied Mr. Herman Lieber, when asked if he remembered Dr. Schliemann. ""I met him a number of times while he was here. He was not then recognized as a great person."
1891-01-04T00:00:00Z,"Mr. J.A. Riis has had the fullest experience in regard to the subject he treats, for he has devoted many years to the study of New-York. The title explains itself, for it is true ""that one-half of the world does not know how the other half lives."" The question is, Does it care?"
1891-01-04T00:00:00Z,"An incident occurred at the City Hall station of the elevated railroad yesterday that within the space of fifteen minutes made enthusiastic converts of at least 3,000 persons to any system of rapid transit that could be built. It was at about 4:45 o'clock, and there had been a delay of trains up town somewhere, so that for fully a quarter of an hour no trains had arrived at the City Hall station."
1891-01-04T00:00:00Z,"RICHMOND, Va., Jan. 3. -- For the past twenty years or longer the oyster question has attracted the attention of the lawmakers of Virginia. Hardly a legislative session during that period has passed at which this subject has not been discussed. At the last session a bill was passed providing for leasing the State's oyster ground for a period of years."

He said: ""The first trouble that I ever heard of occurred when Gresham was the presiding Judge and Harrison was the attorney for a railroad in Southwestern Indiana. Harrison, as the attorney for the road, had been delaying matters until Gresham became tired of the obstructionist methods adopted."
1891-01-04T00:00:00Z,The opening chapters of this volume give a promise of excellence which is utterly belied by what follows. The American part of the story is as good as the African part is bad -- a phenomenon which may be best accounted for by supposing that the author knows the one continent and does not know the other.
1891-01-04T00:00:00Z,"Such biographical notices of Langfranchi as have been printed, though correct in the main, are wanting in details. In his naturalization papers taken out in New-York, 1893, he declared that he was born in Pisa, Italy, and was twenty-nine years old. Americans, prone to give foreigners nicknames, had dubbed him ""Lanky Franky,"" supposably on account of his Quixotic mien."
1891-01-04T00:00:00Z,"There is music in the air as the Smeaton Tower bowls smoothly along toward Porto Rico. Capt. Godfree is fond of music, and he has four instruments in the cabin -- a violin, a guitar, a concertina, and a flute-harmonicum, the latter a curious French instrument with a bellows at the back like an accordion and a row of kevs in front like a piano."

1891-01-08T00:00:00Z,"CHICAGO, Jan. 7. -- Justice Hamburger decided to-day that however unpleasant the duty, he believed there was probable cause for the supposition that S.A. Kean knew he was insolvent when he received Royer's money, and he would therefore be compelled to hold the banker to the Grand Jury in bonds of $3,000. The banker promptly furnished the required bail and was released."
1891-01-08T00:00:00Z,"The most remarkable thing about the project for assorting the mails at sea is that it should now be brought forward for the first time. It appears that letters for Europe are habitually retained for distribution in the New-York Post Office, and the delay thus entailed often suffices to cause them to miss the first steamer that sails after they arrive."
1891-01-08T00:00:00Z,"It is impossible to read the account of the proceedings of the Senate on Monday without being more or less sorry for Mr. GEORGE F. HOAR. That venerable scholar in politics has been the sponsor and spokesman of the Force bill in the Senate even as the juvenile scholar in politics, Mr. CABOT LODGE, has been its sponsor and spokesman in the House."
1891-01-08T00:00:00Z,"WASHINGTON, Jan. 7. -- If the silver men have their way in the Senate the Finance bill will be acted upon within a week.

1891-01-08T00:00:00Z,"There is something akin to a row under way in the American Society of Civil Engineers. The trouble will come to a head at the annual election for officers, which takes place on Jan. 21. Meanwhile an earnest and in some respects a bitter campaign is being conducted by the leaders of the opposing factions, known respectively as the Wellingtonians and the anti-Wellingtonians."
1891-01-08T00:00:00Z,"NEW-YORK, Jan. 3. -- Recent cable dispatches from Carlsbad more than confirm the impression already received by those familiar with the subject that the disastrous floods which devastated that most famous of German watering places a short time ago are likely to prove a serious matter to the people of this country."

1891-01-08T00:00:00Z,"TOPEKA, Kan., Jan. 7. -- A letter from Congressman E.J. Turner of the Sixth District was made public to-day, which has caused much bad blood and may result in a permanent split in Alliance ranks. The letter was in the possession of Judge Peffer, one of the Alliance candidates for Senator, and McLellan, editor of the Alliance organ, and held until McGrath, President of the State Alliance, to whom it was addressed, threatened personal violence."

Mr. CLEVELAND showed himself in some respects at his best. Mr. CLEVELAND'S conception of ""the principles of true Democracy"" is clear, broad, just, and practical, and his vision is penetrating enough to see the actual bearing of what he accepts as Democratic principles upon the requirements of the present."
1891-01-09T00:00:00Z,"Sergius Stepniak, the Russian revolutionary leader and exile, lectured before a large audience in the Metropolitan Opera House last evening for the benefit of the Society to Befriend Working Girls. His subject had been announced as ""Count Tolstoi as a Novelist and as a Social Reformer,"" but Mr. Stepniak deemed it expedient to speak on ""Nihilism; or, the Revolutionary Movement in Russia,"" instead."
1891-01-09T00:00:00Z,"BOSTON, Jan. 8. -- The Hon. William E. Russell, Massachusetts's third Democratic Governor since the war, and the youngest save one in her history, was inaugurated to-day.

1891-01-09T00:00:00Z,"LINCOLN, Neb., Jan. 8. -- There was war at the State Capitol to-day and soldiers filled the corridors. It was all due to the attempt of the Alliance to keep the State office by force and prevent Governor-elect Boyd from taking his seat. The outcome of this the most disgraceful wrangle ever seen at the Capitol was the counting of the votes and the declaration that Boyd (Dem.) was elected Governor."

1891-01-09T00:00:00Z,The twelfth exhibition of works of art at the Union League Club is likely to be the last for some time to come. The Committee of Seven feels that it has labored hard for the pleasure of the members and their friends and has pretty well exhausted the collections of its immediate acquaintances while obtaining material for twelve loan exhibitions.
1891-01-09T00:00:00Z,"From the time of Mr. GLADSTONE'S notification that he could not co-operate with the Irish Parliamentary Party so long as Mr. PARNELL remained in the lead of it, the leader thus invited to depose himself seemed to have lost his head entirely. No man has gone further to illustrate the saying that whom the gods wish to destroy they first make mad."
1891-01-09T00:00:00Z,"Harmony was the watchword among the influential Western railroad men who attended the first meeting of the new Advisory Board at the Windsor Hotel, in this city, yesterday. Although the meeting was uneventful beyond the designating of a committee to draft a constitution and by-laws, there were convincing evidences that the unanimous sentiment of the members of the board was for peace and harmony."
1891-01-09T00:00:00Z,Gov. RUSSELL of Massachusetts departs from the useless custom of making a summary of official reports in his first message to the Legislature and devotes himself mainly to recommending reforms.

1891-01-09T00:00:00Z,"The Ingalls theory of politics as warfare, in which the Decalogue and the Golden Rule have no place, and in which every advantage is to be taken of the enemy without regard to moral principle, has so far prevailed in times past as to beget among violent partisans a remarkable callousness as to moral distinctions where public office is to be gained or lost."
1891-01-09T00:00:00Z,The suggestions of Gov. HILL about the improvement of the highways of the State are at least so far commendable as they tend to arouse public interest in the subject. Gov.

This means a loss to the County Democracy of one of its strongest leaders. The move has been discounted for some time by the politicians."
1891-01-09T00:00:00Z,"CONCORD, N.H, Jan. 8. -- If in some manner there could have been held here this morning a convention of those wise and sententious fellows, the old sawmakers, for the purpose of selecting an appropriate motto for this, New-Hampshire's inauguration day, the decision would have been speedily and unanimously given that there was nothing which would answer so well as that particular old saw which affirms that the receiver is as bad as the thief."
1891-01-09T00:00:00Z,"The report of the Railroad Commissioners of Connecticut shows that the law enacted two years ago in that State concerning the abolition of railroad crossings at grade has scarcely any value. Under its provisions only four companies could be compelled to make any changes, and if the New-York, New-Haven and Hartford Company, which controls several lines, had separated grades at only six crossings it would have complied with the statute."

1891-01-09T00:00:00Z,"For the first time the handsome new ballroom at the Madison Square Garden felt the step of the dancer last evening, when the first ladies' assembly of the season was given. The ballroom glowed beneath the soft electric lights imbedded in its ceiling and about its walls. Long festoons of laurel hung from the balconies, while the orchestral platform was a mass of palms and pine."

1891-01-09T00:00:00Z,"We are apt to consider ""an old-fashioned Winter"" in New-York an unmitigated nuisance, and it is comforting to dwell upon its mitigations, such as they are. One of them is that the patient owners of sleighs and cutters have had something like a week's sleighing, and the Weather Bureau appears to promise them more."
1891-01-09T00:00:00Z,"WASHINGTON, Jan. 8. -- The only subject of conversation in the Navy Department to-day was Secretary Tracy's reprimand of Commander Reiter.

1891-01-10T00:00:00Z,"It is difficult to see the way out of the Connecticut muddle. The legislative session is practically suspended until the 20th, when action will have to be taken on the election of a United States Senator.

By sections, its provisions are substantially as follows:"

It was organized one month ago with a capital of $35,000, 000, and was in point of fact a reorganization of all the harvester manufacturers in the country into one company, which was in effect a trust or monopoly. By purchasing the plants of the various companies outright it was thought all legal obstacles had been avoided."

1891-01-11T00:00:00Z,"The Indian uprising has induced certain Republican papers to indulge in a little criticism of the manner in which the Indian service is conducted, but this criticism stops short of the point to which it ought to be carried. Some of it is very good so far as it goes, but our Republican friends are restrained from applying it directly to the persons who are responsible."
1891-01-11T00:00:00Z,"There is a pleasant discussion upon the subject of the education of clever and famous people in the current English Illustrated Magazine. This discourse, which is by Mr. JAMES SULLY, runs over the various phases of the theme, such as family education and school and college education. The writer appears to agree with GALTON in the belief that men of genius owe more to their fathers than their mothers."
1891-01-11T00:00:00Z,"The Congressional Record is being inequitably conducted just now. The other day at least twice or three times in the House did members say something which resulted in laughter, and the Record announced the cacninnatory fact. In the Senate things happened which were more humorous than any of the occurrences in the House, but the manifestations of the tickled multitude have not been made apparent in the Government newspaper."
1891-01-11T00:00:00Z,"The Pastime Athletic Club, an organization which has done a great deal in the way of the development of athletes, especially boxers, began its annual boxing tournament last evening at the Lenox Lyceum.

1891-01-11T00:00:00Z,"MOUNTAIN CLIMBING AND HUMAN ENDURANCE. -- We occupied an entire day in passing from the lower to the upper station of Cotopaxi. The labor was not severe, and the effects could only be attributed to our inability to accommodate ourselves to reduction in atmospheric pressure to as low a point as 16,500 inches."
1891-01-11T00:00:00Z,"BUFFALO, Jan. 10. -- At last the location of the new Canadian Pacific Bridge across the river has been practically decided upon. The party of survey who were at work just beyond the mills in the village of Suspension bridge, it appears, were here for the purpose of staking out the line of the new River Bridge Railroad Company, which will be the railroad feeder of the new bridge."
1891-01-11T00:00:00Z,"The new home of the Democratic Club, at 617 Fifth Avenue, was properly ""warmed"" last evening. Grover Cleveland was there and Lieut. Gov. Jones stood beside him as he shook hands with the thousand or more gentlemen who pressed forward to exchange a word with him. Gov.

1891-01-11T00:00:00Z,"LONDON, Jan. 10. -- To-day the cause of home rule for Ireland seems to be in a more hopelessly wretched condition than it has been before since the news of the Phoenix Park murders spread over astonnded England. John Dillon, they say, leaves New-York to-day for Europe. The pity is that he did not sail a month ago, and leave William O'Brien behind him."
1891-01-11T00:00:00Z,"TROY, N.Y., Jan. 10. -- Flaming dodgers are being circulated about the city to-night which state that an Albany paper will to-morrow give a full account of the attempted assassination of Edward Murphy, Jr., Chairman of the Democratic State Committee and the bosom friend of Gov. Hill."

Howard, United States Army, commanding the military Division of the Atlantic, will have a two-column interview in the Times-Union of to-morrow morning regarding his Indian experiences and his views on recent events in the West. The General has studied the Indian question fully, and his long experience entitles his views to consideration."

1891-01-11T00:00:00Z,"TOPEKA, Kan., Jan. 10. -- President Harrison has at all times practically ignored the Republicans of Kansas. At least such is their belief when the golden apples do not all fall their way. Those who helped roll up that wonderful 82,000 Republican majority promptly applied for office, office of any kind, as a reward for their partisan patriotism."
1891-01-11T00:00:00Z,"PITTSBURG, Jan. 10. -- The preliminary hearing of the forty-six Hungarians who were prominent participants in the riot at the Edgar Thomson Steel Rail Mill, which is owned by Andrew Carnegie, took place in the town Council Hall at Braddock this afternoon.

DELAMATER had been elected Governor of the State, and had afterward been arrested for embezzling county funds intrusted to his broken bank. Of course the charge remains to be proved, but the disclosures made in the proceeding at Meadville are of a kind that can hardly be cleared away to the vindication of DELAMATER'S character."
1891-01-11T00:00:00Z,"MARRIED LIFE IN THIBET. -- Among the Thibetans a man marries only one wife, whom he purchases from her parents, a belle often costing as much as ten ponies and thirty yaks. The price to be paid for the wife is arranged by a relative or a friend, who acts as go-between, and the only marriage ceremony is a grand spree, lasting as long as the bridegroom can afford to keep it up."
1891-01-11T00:00:00Z,"WASHINGTON, Jan. 10. -- Mrs. Harrison's first public reception, held this afternoon, was in every respect highly enjoyable. The plan adopted by Mrs. Harrison of doing away with a formidable line of a half dozen or more ladies, and only asking as her assistants the wife of the Chief Justice and of Associate Justice Brown, was a very welcome innovation to the public."

1891-01-11T00:00:00Z,"We must think that ""A Boy's Town,"" as far as its little hero goes, is autobiographical. Whether it will serve the purpose for which we suppose it was written, the edification and amusement of young people, we are doubtful about. It is a very old book in the sense that it will be understandable only by persons of mature age, who must possess a certain amount of judgment."
1891-01-11T00:00:00Z,"HOPS. -- Are we not told that hops ""are employed to communicate to beer its aromatic bitter""? So, at least, it should be. It is rather a suggestive fact, however, that though the consumption of beer and ale is rather on the increase than otherwise, the area of land under hops and the annual yield are on the decrease."
1891-01-11T00:00:00Z,"It is a notable fact that the people of New-Orleans take great delight in their seasons of French opera, and give them generous support. In addition to that, the newspapers of the city accord to the enterprise their best consideration, and have no hesitation about uttering candid opinions. The New-Orleans Times-Democrat took occasion at the opening of the year to review the work done up to that time. Its remarks are as follows:"

1891-01-11T00:00:00Z,"A HINDU GIRL. -- A Hindu baby girl is an unwelcome addition to the family; her birth is supposed to be no blessing, but a curse and a sign of divine wrath. Rukhmabai says that when the new-born baby is a girl ""the father gnashes his teeth and stamps his feet. The mother is sorely disappointed, and although her tenderness may bring its sure wealth of love, she curses both herself and the child."

1891-01-11T00:00:00Z,"The scenes about the Ministry of Finance in Paris yesterday morning were very curious. Subscriptions were to be received at the opening of the offices for the loan of some $170,000,000 offered by the Government. Before daylight the crowd of applicants began to gather.

Henning of shooting people under and across the East River through a tunnel with sharp inclines at either end by the force of gravity and the assistance of a cable clutch has been expanded by the projector into the Henning Rapid Transit Company, with the object of filling the long-felt want of quick communication between the lower end of Manhattan Island and Westchester County."
1891-01-11T00:00:00Z,"TRENTON, N.J., Jan. 10. -- New-Jersey is still the Gretna Green of the Union. The annual report of the State Bureau of Vital Statistics, recently issued, proves this fact. The license laws of other States in this part of the Nation send hundreds of couples to Jersey, where the matrimonial knot is tied with neatness and dispatch by some clergymen or one of a few Justices of the Peace who make a specialty of marriages."
1891-01-11T00:00:00Z,"Gen. Pacheco, the Mexican Minister of Public Works, has recently submitted to the Mexican Congress a report on the proposed changes in the coinage, with a bill to carry them into effect.

Every night was filled with entertainments, and the days each and all had marked features. The seasonable and beautiful weather which has prevailed had much to do with the general atmosphere of gayety."
1891-01-11T00:00:00Z,"HARTFORD, Conn., Jan. 10. -- The only parallel of the dead-lock now existing in the Connecticut General Assembly must be found in the antiquated journals and records stowed away in the Capitol loft.

1891-01-11T00:00:00Z,"BALTIMORE, Jan. 10. -- The party skirmishes for the Summer convention and the Fall campaign have commenced, and the indications are that the competition will be brisk and the fight hot and vigorous.

1891-01-11T00:00:00Z,"ALBANY, Jan. 10. -- The Senatorial question is apparently no nearer final settlement to-day than it was a month ago.

1891-01-11T00:00:00Z,"NOT A ST. PREUX. -- Consciously or unconsciously, our forefathers held that plain straightforward language purified immoral incidents of half their danger. Vice never moved through their pages with the mince and the simper of simulated virtue. Novels depend on the same breaches of the decalogue."

The first volume contains a biography of himself, written by Cardinal Newman in the third person and committed by him to the care of his niece, Miss Anne Mozley, who is the editor of this work.

It appears that only one competitor has ever appeared for the two architect scholarships of Boston in a given year. It is true that the idea is a novel one and has hardly time to have spread far, even among architects, who, presumably, read this able periodical."

This correspondence tells its own story, the first letter being sent to the Postmaster by the customs officers in this city and the second being the reply thereto:"
1891-01-16T00:00:00Z,"The railroad strike in Scotland is exceptional for the length of time that it has continued without giving a decisive advantage to either party.

1891-01-17T00:00:00Z,"The Tammany primary elections were held last night in all the Assembly districts but the Fourteenth.

1891-02-01T00:00:00Z,"Recently I took a turn through the Cuban cigar factory in this city and saw eighteen Cubans or Spaniards who can't speak any English working for dear life. All of them have been brought here within the past few weeks. I was struck with the handsome appearance of two young dark-eyed, swarthy cigarmakers who sat back to back working merrily at different tables."
1891-02-01T00:00:00Z,"Although it is now more than a week since the notice was posted in the Produce Exchange that the members would be allowed to vote on the proposition to buy in seats next Tuesday, the discussion of the proposition continues with unabated vigor. It is safe to say that no matter has come before the Exchange for years which has stirred up so much feeling and caused such an amount of debate among the members."

1891-02-01T00:00:00Z,In his recent message Mayor Grant of this city declares that the question of widening and improving the drives in Central Park is one which demands immediate attention. There is nothing novel in this suggestion. The necessity of widening and straightening and leveling the roads of the Park has often been urged by persons who assume that these roads were made primarily for pleasure driving.
1891-02-01T00:00:00Z,"Ten times as many persons carry hand bags east of Broadway and south of Thirteenth Street as in other parts of the city. The usual type is of yellow leather, large enough to hold a good-sized book, with numerous smaller articles, and it is not apt to be new. It holds surgical instruments if carried by an old man, notebook and the latest edition of Strumfell or Flint if by a young one."
1891-02-01T00:00:00Z,"The bill of Senator SANDERS of Montana imposing penalties for selling arms to Indians, except those of the civilized tribes, or under official permission and regulations, is of course called out by the recent troubles in Dakota. The difficulty both in disarming the Indians and in keeping them disarmed was fully explained by Gen. SCHOFIELD before the attempt which resulted in the disastrous affair on Porcupine Creek."

1891-02-01T00:00:00Z,"THE FARM IN FINLAND. -- One of the most instructive sights of the country is an ordinary Finnish farm in the interior, say in Satakunta or Savolaks, or in Ostrobothnia on the verge of the dreary country of the Lapps, which is in truth -"
1891-02-01T00:00:00Z,"WAS THE HORSE DRIVEN BEFORE IT WAS RIDDEN? -- Canon Taylor, in that most interesting book. ""The Origin of the Aryans,"" has raised once more a question which has often attracted the attention of scholars, especially those interested in the Homeric poems. Why is it that in the earliest records of the Greeks, Egyptians, Assyrians, Indians, and Celts we find the horse used for drawing chariots, but not yet for riding?"
1891-02-01T00:00:00Z,"New-York is to have another new and large hotel. It is to be erected as soon as possible at the northeast corner of Broadway and Forty-first Street.

1891-02-01T00:00:00Z,"THE ROSE OF SHARON NOT A ROSE. -- The Anemone coronaria commonly grows wild about Smyrna and in Asia Minor, spreading far and wide as the most beautiful of Spring blossoms, growing on chalk soil along the edges of shrubbery. We cannot wonder that it was already in ancient times a favorite of the inhabitants and excited in poetic minds sensations such as can only be excited by surprising beauty."

Guests at the hotels and cottages appear to be waiting for some of the regular made Lakewood sunshine. There is no falling off in numbers, but most of the guests are kept indoors by the regularity with which snow and rain and freeze and thaw follow upon the heels of each other."
1891-02-01T00:00:00Z,"The charm of a private dinner is simply that it is private. Why, then, allow its charm and sacredness to be destroyed by anything so obviously brought into existence by the people and for the people as the menu? A menu is a ""bill of fare."" The use of the French word is an affectation; that language, however, lends, itself to the cause of cooks, as well as it does to that of Courts."
1891-02-01T00:00:00Z,"ASHEVILLE, N.C., Jan. 31. -- The country hereabouts, ambitiously termed ""the land of the sky"" on account of its elevation, almost perpetual sunshine, and salubrious climate, has been growing in popularity with seekers after health and pleasure for several years.

1891-02-01T00:00:00Z,"BIRDS WHICH HAVE DISAPPEARED. -- A very interesting bird, once an inhabitant of Britain, but now everywhere utterly extinct, is known as the great auk. It was about the size of a goose, but, having very small wings, was quite unable to fly. Being a powerful bird, with a strong bill, and a most accomplished diver, it would have continued to live on in full security but for man's reckless destruction."

Hunt of the Board of Education at its last meeting."
1891-02-01T00:00:00Z,"The new apportionment, which is to take effect in 1893, will not affect the Electoral vote of 1892.

1891-02-01T00:00:00Z,"The popular demand for etchings has so stimulated the trade that cheapness has been sought and obtained, to the present detriment of the art. It is an open secret that the Etching Club has felt severely the rivalry of cheap etchings (not to speak of process prints) which appear to those who are not specialists as fine as the best etcher's proofs."

1891-02-01T00:00:00Z,There is a report from Hartford about the Republicans offering a basis of settlement for the Governorship dispute in which a proposition for a Constitutional Convention is the chief point.

1891-02-01T00:00:00Z,"If there is any one international principle thoroughly established among the civilized States of the world, by treaty, by custom, usage, and precedent, it is that no political refugee may be surrendered to his enemies. There is a line of unbroken precedents on this subject in the navy reaching as far back as 1842, if not further. All civilized Governments, even those of Russia and Turkey, acquiesce in this principle and admit it in practice."
1891-02-01T00:00:00Z,"Really, our French friends who enjoy -- and enjoy greatly -- a reputation for logic do not expend it recklessly on their current phrases. The joyous M. Prudhomme, with whom HENRY MONNIER enriched French literature some sixty years ago, is a personage very much delighted in still by the present generation of French writers, who seem to see in his characteristics something so exceptional that they can afford to laugh at him without reserve."

Since this is so, however, there seems to be no good reason why comment on these repeated historical events should not be reiterated.

1891-02-01T00:00:00Z,"When Prof. HUXLEY wrote his famous essay on protoplasm, or the physical basis of life, a great many people, and notably Mr. JAMES STIRLING, were seriously disturbed by it and began to tremble for the goodly frame of spiritualism, that much-abused word being taken in its philosophical and not in its popular sense."
1891-02-01T00:00:00Z,"AN ESTIMATE OF ""DIZZY,"" 1855. -- ""As to the secession,"" Elliot said, of ""Herbert and Gladstone, it is a great blow to the future Government and a prodigious accession to the Tories. But I am not sure that it is a loss to the country. If Gladstone had remained he could only have made a loan and raised the income tax to 10 per cent."
1891-02-01T00:00:00Z,"One day recently a New-York doctor prescribed beer for a patient. ""Take it with your meals,"" he said, ""and I reckon that it will do you lots of good."" Then he chatted a few minutes with the patient's wife and at length started for the door."
1891-02-01T00:00:00Z,"Among the many services which that truly great man, Capt. Kidd, rendered to society by adopting the profession of a pirate must be reckoned the furnishing of material to unimaginative authors by his singular and uncontrollable mania fur burying his hard-won treasures so carefully that neither he nor any one else has ever been able to find them since."
1891-02-01T00:00:00Z,"Dr. Paul Henry Knaupf knew even as much as the lumps on his protuberant forehead predicated; and this is extravagant praise, for it always looked as though it had just returned from an Irish picnic."
1891-02-01T00:00:00Z,"WASHINGTON, Jan. 31. -- When the House went into Committee of the Whole to-day on the Diplomatic and Consular Appropriation bill, Mr. McCreary of Kentucky, after inveighing against the Committee on Rules for its refusal to allow the Committee on Foreign Affairs a day for the consideration of bills reported by it, took up the Barrundia case and the Bering Sea controversy."
1891-02-01T00:00:00Z,"NEW-HAVEN, Conn., Jan. 31. -- The amendment recently passed by Congress and approved Jan. 13, 1891, to the statute concerning details of officers of the army and navy to educational institutions, has an important effect upon Yale University. The Sheffield Scientific School has had for the last two years a course of military instruction under the direction of Lieut. A.L. Totten of the regular army."
1891-02-01T00:00:00Z,"PLAINFIELD, N.J., Jan. 31. -- A contest in the courts over the estate of the late Job Male is probable. The octogenarian philanthropist and millionaire left the making of his will until too late. When he lay on his deathbed, Thursday evening, he made an effort to dispose of his possessions in legal form, but died before the will was signed."
1891-02-01T00:00:00Z,"The Peruvian war and its great prize, consisting of the rich provinces of Tarapaca and Antofagasta, have made Chile wealthy, proud, and hateful to all her neighbors. In a way the Chileans are the Prussians of South America, overweening talkers, arrogating to themselves the first place in war and in peace among the republics of the southern hemisphere, and taking measures to make their pretensions a reality."
1891-02-01T00:00:00Z,"THE DECAY OF THE MYTH. -- When the Germans and Dr. Arnold disposed of Romulus and Remus and their nurse, who was a more genial form of Red Ridinghood's grandmother, all fairyland was in danger, and since then the whole realm of poetic story has been invaded. Hawthorne's ""Wonder Book"" would now have to be rewritten, for its wonders have been reduced from poetry to prose."
1891-02-01T00:00:00Z,"BAYONNE, N.J., Jan. 31. -- New-Jersey Athletic Club marksmen turned out in force this afternoon to shoot at clay pigeons on the club grounds here. Thirteen useful prizes were offered in four scheduled matches. The principal event was a team match for silver cups. George S. Virden and Edward L. Vredenburgh carried off the honors as a team. Each was rewarded with a cup."
1891-02-01T00:00:00Z,"In the amiable preface which he has written for the catalogue of the richest, most curious, and most original collection of books ever formed Mr. Brayton Ives says modestly: ""It is not claimed that the books described in this catalogue form a library. They are only a collection. Nearly twenty years ago I began a tolerably comprehensive course of historical reading."
1891-02-01T00:00:00Z,"The fourth concert of the Symphony Society, which was given at the Metropolitan Opera House last night, was one of the most interesting of a season which has not been barren of musical fruit. Some of the interest, it must be admitted, was of a factitious nature, for on purely artistic grounds the performance in concert of any scene from a Wagner music-drama is indefensible."
1891-02-01T00:00:00Z,"POISONOUS FISH. -- I have known two kinds of poisonous fish in the Cape waters, one of them small and the other large. The latter kind is known by the local name of ""keeler,"" and is, as a rule, good to eat, although the oil is the most profitable use it can be put to. Only at certain times is it poisonous."
1891-02-01T00:00:00Z,"How OLD IS PUNCH? -- On landing at one of the sugar factories, we found that there was a fair going on under an avenue of tamarisks close by. The dealers sat under the trees with their wares before them, fruit and vegetables in one quarter, cotton and calicoes in another, native woollen stutis, robes, rugs, cloth, , in a third; there was also a cattle fair, sheep, buffaloes, camels, and donkeys."
1891-02-01T00:00:00Z,"Of the numerous gatherings of aggressive religious workers, one of the most notable is the New-York State Convention of the Young Men's Christian Association, which will be held this year at Lockport, N.Y., Feb. 19-22. In the past there has usually been between 600 and 700 delegates in attendance."
1891-02-02T00:00:00Z,"BOSTON, Feb. 1. -- A visitor in Boston during the last week would have had an exceptional opportunity to study the traditional Boston woman. Boston women delight, above all things else, in convening, and a chosen few, informed with purpose, and eloquent in its elucidation, may be depended upon at all times to address them."
1891-02-02T00:00:00Z,"PARIS, Feb. 1. -- The Journal des Debats, commenting on the Ministerial crisis in Italy, says:"
1891-02-02T00:00:00Z,The decision of Judge SOMERVILLE for the Board of General Appraisers in the knit-goods case will sorely disappoint the tricksters who believed they had provided for a transfer of imported underwear and hosiery from the old paragraph relating to the duty on such goods to the paragraph relating to wearing apparel.
1891-02-02T00:00:00Z,"FORT WORTH, Texas, Feb. 1. -- The Randall Chambers Dry Goods Company made a general assignment last night to H.C. Edrington. The liabilities are $59,000, well scattered over the country."
1891-02-02T00:00:00Z,"The Argentine Republic has recently added to its navy six first-class torpedo boats of almost identically the same type and size as the Cushing. One of these, the Bathurst, recently completed her trial trips, making an average speed of 24.458 knots over a continuous six-mile run. The chief point of interest in the Bathurst is the introduction of quadruple expansion engines, which have four inverted cylinders acting on four cranks on one shaft."
1891-02-02T00:00:00Z,"LONDON, Feb. 1. -- Discount rates were firm during the past week at 11 3/4 to 1 1/4. The cheapness of money led to an increase of the foreign drain of bullion which was barely balanced by the return of currency from the provinces and the distribution of dividends. Signs of a reduction of bankers' balances, combined with shortening supplies of floating capital in the markets, render a further drop of money rates impossible."
1891-02-02T00:00:00Z,"ST. LOUIS, Feb. 1. -- From a newspaper compositor the following story is obtained of the earlier career of Henry Hansbrough, recently elected United States Senator from North Dakota:"
1891-02-02T00:00:00Z,"A collection of objects used in their worship by Hebrews of the thirteenth, fourteenth, and fifteenth centuries has been arranged in one of the rooms of the Hotel Cluny at Paris.

Two bills calculated to bring about this situation have already been introduced, and they will be vigorously pushed."
1891-02-02T00:00:00Z,"WASHINGTON, Feb. 1. -- All the arrangements for the funeral of the late Secretary Windom have now been completed.

They will be brief, and at their conclusion the entire party will proceed to the church."
1891-02-02T00:00:00Z,"BIRMINGHAM, Ala., Feb. 1. -- Reports were current here yesterday of an attack by white men, at Galloway mines, on negroes who had been put to work during the recent strike. Efforts made by telegraph to secure a confirmation of the reports proved futile. The only answer obtainable was that a negro had been killed by a white man in self-defense and that the reports were incorrect."
1891-02-02T00:00:00Z,"It is not surprising that after so vigorous and so successful a campaign of education as that which was made last Fall by the young men of the Democratic Party in Massachusetts, some of their puzzled opponents should be looking for new issues or for something to divert public attention from the old ones."
1891-02-02T00:00:00Z,"TRENTON, N.J., Feb. 1. -- The annual report of the New-Jersey State Board of Agriculture, recently prepared, gives a very interesting summary of the agricultural situation in one of the most fertile farming regions of the Middle States. The report shows that the farming industry is in a much better condition than it was in 1889."
1891-02-02T00:00:00Z,"PITTSBURG, Feb. 1. -- John W. Chalfant, the millionaire steel manufacturer of this city, and one of the largest individual stockholders of the Pittsburg and Western Railroad Company, to-night confirmed the report that that corporation had passed into the control of the Baltimore and Ohio."
1891-02-02T00:00:00Z,"Writing of the late Duke of Bedford, the London correspondent of the Manchester Guardian, who may be regarded as specially well informed on the subject, says: ""I am not sure that substantial justice has been done to one of his most marked qualities -- his munificence. Having begun life as a very poor man, he had contracted the habit of close attention to details of expenditure, and this habit passed with superficial observers for stinginess."
1891-02-02T00:00:00Z,"The revolt in the garrison at Oporto on Saturday, which was suppressed within a few hours after it broke out, seems to have been hopeless from the start, having been attempted without suitable preparation or assurances of support. Possibly, however, further investigation may reveal a more widespread disaffection, of which this was a premature demonstration; and indeed, no doubt Portugal is always liable, during its present restless condition, to uprisings against the Government."
1891-02-02T00:00:00Z,"WASHINGTON, Feb. 1. -- The report on the recent survey of the Despatch has not yet been completed, but it is expected that it will show that to repair her would cost more than the 20 per cent. limit fixed by law, and consequently she will probably be condemned at an early day and sold."
1891-02-02T00:00:00Z,"ST. LOUIS, Feb. 1. -- War has been announced between the farmers in Indiana and the Postal Telegraph Company. A dispatch from Brazil, Ind., says:"
1891-02-02T00:00:00Z,"SPRINGFIELD, Ill., Feb. 1. -- Auditor C.W. Pavey, when informed of the statement of the officers of the Consolidated Mutual Fire Insurance Company that the failure was due to his arbitrary and unwarranted rulings, said such charges were nonsensical. When an examination was made, as required by law, and the company's assets were found to be impaired, he had given it forty days in which to make good the assets by special assessment."
1891-02-02T00:00:00Z,"The latest addition to the long list of persons ""spoken of"" for the Treasury Department is Mr. PALMER of Michigan, known to the country only as an intimate friend of Mr. HARRISON, whose disappointment at not being appointed to the Department of Agriculture was assuaged by an appointment as Minister to Spain."
1891-02-02T00:00:00Z,"The new act for the protection and preservation of birds, fish, and game which has been prepared by the Commission to Codify the Game Laws is far more extensive than was expected by the anglers and those interested in fish culture or by the hunters."
1891-02-02T00:00:00Z,It is not very clear why a committee of Congress should now be engaged in investigating the business of landing immigrants at this port. The whole matter of immigration has lately been made the subject of a much more thorough investigation at the hands of Congress than this committee can possibly make in the time at its disposal.

1891-02-02T00:00:00Z,"TRENTON, Feb. 1. -- Delay is the object the Hudson delegation in the Senate and Assembly will play for at the reassembling of the Democratic joint caucus to-morrow evening. But it is doubtful if they will be able to give the State House managers a second surprise party. Delay can do the disaffected element no good."
1891-02-02T00:00:00Z,"Lady Dufferin seems to have followed her husband, the Viceroy, (she calls him D. for short,) wherever he went, and besides that made excursions on her own account. Whether at a durbar receiving Punjab chiefs, Rajahs, or Dukes and Princes at her receptions, or shooting a tiger or founding hospital, attending a steeplechase, playing tennis, or doing charitable work, or taking photographs, her ladyship never tired."
1891-02-02T00:00:00Z,"Miss Florence Birch, an estimable resident of Bay Shore, L.I., has during the last ten days been subjected to a series of cruel and criminal persecutions which have aroused in the citizens of her town great indignation. She is a milliner and has kept a store in Smith's Block, on Main Street."
1891-02-02T00:00:00Z,"BAYONNE, N.J., Feb. 1. -- A concise statement of Bayonne's financial condition is clearly shown by the State Controller's annual report for the year 1890. Mayor John Newman certified to the correctness of this report."
1891-02-02T00:00:00Z,"The Portland (Oregon) Morning Oregonian expresses its opinion free coinage in vigorous language. It says: ""Free silver coinage, like the greenback inflation, would cause the price of commodities to advance, and, while this would transiently help the debtor farmer, how would the millions of wage workers feel with their wages paid in docked dollars?"
1891-02-02T00:00:00Z,"The impression of his recent visit to Washington, given in another column by Mr. EDWARD ATKINSON, should be considered by our own business men. Mr. ATKINSON was one of a delegation of Boston men who went to the capital to protest the passage of the Free-Coinage bill. He reports that the majority of the House Committee on Coinage and of the Congressmen met by his delegation were anxious for light."
1891-02-02T00:00:00Z,"WASHINGTON, Feb. 1. -- The Senate is shaping up its business with a firm determination to adjourn March 1 without leaving behind it the necessity for an extra session.

1891-02-02T00:00:00Z,"COLUMBUS, Ohio, Feb. 1. -- The action taken by the officials of the Miners' Union in demanding that at the expiration of the present contract all coal mined in Ohio should be weighed before passing through the screens, is calculated to discourage the operators, who claim that they cannot and will not make further concessions to the miners."
1891-02-02T00:00:00Z,"The swords of our heroes are coming into the market, and it is sometimes a little difficult to put a price on them. A sword of WASHINGTON, won by him when he resigned his commission as commander of the army at Annapolis in 1783 under memorable circumstances, has just been offered to the Massachusetts Legislature, the request of the owner being simply that a committee shall be appointed to negotiate with him for its purchase."

1891-02-03T00:00:00Z,"The proposed rearming and manning of Fort Taylor and the water batteries at Key West, and possibly, also, of Fort Jefferson, at the Dry Tortugas, will presumably depend much on the question whether the regular artillery is increased by two regiments, as is contemplated in a bill which has already passed the House and is pending in the Senate."
1891-02-03T00:00:00Z,"While the carbonate ring of Colorado was trying to induce the Treasury Department to reverse the old ruling as to the admission of silver-lead fluxing ores from Mexico, and afterward, while the same ring was procuring the imposition of a high duty on such ores in the McKinley bill, we pointed out that the owners of American mines producing refractory ores would be affected injuriously by the proposed changes."
1891-02-03T00:00:00Z,"Mr. J.H. Young of 230 West Thirty-eighth Street does not favor the project of building a new drive on the margin of the Hudson River north of Seventy-second Street.

1891-02-03T00:00:00Z,"It is evident that the French Government, as now constituted, thinks the political advantage of protection so great as to make it worth while to try the experiment of a pretty high tariff. It counts on the active support of a few favored interests to overcome any general opposition. But we are confident that, as a mere matter of policy, this is short-sighted."
1891-02-03T00:00:00Z,"The sixteenth annual report of that worthy charity, the Hospital Book and Newspaper Society, has just been issued. The work of the society is to distribute reading matter to the unfortunates in all public institutions.

They announce, according to the reports, that a ""knot"" is simply a unit for measuring speed at sea, and has nothing to do with distance which is measured by the nautical mile of 6,080 feet."
1891-02-03T00:00:00Z,"In matters of principle in legislation, compromises, like curses and chickens, come home to roost. This is a commonplace of politics, which is as well established by experience as it is generally ignored. There are sundry financial statesmen still extant, who were influential in Congress or the Cabinet in 1878, who, after a dozen years, may recall with chagrin, and also with profit, the finance bills of that year and apply to them this truth."
1891-02-03T00:00:00Z,"The Baptist pastors yesterday listened to an interesting discourse on ""Sunday-School Missionary Work in Minnesota"" by Boston W.

Inman, there will be Gen. Samuel Thomas, Senator C.S. Brice, C.M. McGhee, and Lawyer Patrick Calhoun."
1891-02-03T00:00:00Z,"The Legislature at Albany appears to have started off to make a notable record of extravagance.

1891-02-03T00:00:00Z,"WASHINGTON, Feb. 2. -- The passage by the House to-day of the bill giving the President thirty days in which to fill such a vacancy as that caused by the death of Secretary Windom and the expected prompt concurrence of the Senate in the measure will probably extend for several days the time in which the politicians can speculate upon the chances of the numerous persons brought forward for the Secretaryship."

1891-02-03T00:00:00Z,"The death of the patient who was the first subject of the Koch treatment in this country will attract much attention because of the reports concerning the effect of the inoculations in his case. As to this the testimony is conflicting. The press dispatches indicate that his general condition became much worse after the beginning of the treatment, but this may have been due to the natural progress of the disease."
1891-02-03T00:00:00Z,"Quite naturally the Tory and Unionist press in England take the side of PARNELL in the quarrel among the Irish members of Parliament, and it is astonishing that any sensible Irishman should fail to perceive what this championship means. The Standard goes so far as to interpret PARNELL'S speech at Ennis to mean that ""DILLON and O'BRIEN have consented to unite with him in extorting guarantees from the Gladstonians."""

1891-02-08T00:00:00Z,"The ludicrous farce in the way of a distorted conference between the Amateur Athletic Union and the League of American Wheelmen has at last ended, and the proceedings of the two committees which conferred have been made public. It is so difficult to treat this recent conference or conferences in a serious light that one hardly knows where to begin thinking about it and where to let the subject drop."
1891-02-08T00:00:00Z,"An able editorial in THE TIMES of Feb. 4 discussed the subject of knots and miles, but more should be written about the matter to make the question clear to the ""landlubber,"" and even to some of those who are ""old salts."""

We are told that the royal translator has been prompted to the work by the hope that it will interest Englishmen ""who have passed any time on the Island of Malta."" Now, the Malta part of this story, standing apart from what followed the Count's stay on that island, is of only the slightest human interest."

1891-02-08T00:00:00Z,"MONT MOOR, Feb. 7. -- This is not a charge against Assemblyman Frank P. Demarest, but a remarkably interesting story of how a large estate when successfully manipulated may be affected by the laws of contraction so that more than $20,000 will melt away into about $1,000, and even that amount be doubtful. The story, stranger by far than fiction, is as follows:"
1891-02-08T00:00:00Z,"CHESTERFIELD'S LEANING TOWARD THE FnEcH. -- Chesterfielhl is of all English writers, if we except perhaps I-lorace Valpole, the most essentially un-English.

A heavy wet snow fell, and by 8 o'clock telegraph and telephone poles all over the city were down. The Hudson River Telephone Company thus far is the greatest sufferer. Cable boxes high up on telephone poles burned up with pretty effect, and wires coming together threw off bright flashes of light."

1891-02-08T00:00:00Z,The litigation over the will of the late Daniel B. Fayerweather has aroused such general interest that a resume of the testimony thus far adduced in the attempt to break the will is interesting. The chief objective point of the contestants seems to be the residuary estate as disposed by the last codicil. Here it is charged that Henry B. Vaughan was added to the residuary legatees by the exercise of undue influence.

It is, in fact, a concise little guide book for those who go to Honduras to settle, and the information that fills it is of a thoroughly practical kind."

The Government of an infant King, under the regency of a Queen mother, of course affords the most encouraging environment possible to plots of all kinds.

1891-02-20T00:00:00Z,"TRENTON, N.J., Feb. 19. -- The famous old Sea-Fence bill has at last become a law, ready to go into force.

1891-02-20T00:00:00Z,"The statement that the Prince of WALES has been engaged in gambling with sharpers is a more formidable menace to the British Constitution than the announcement that the Lord Mayor of London has been plagiarizing. Still, this latter assertion, of the correctness of which there seems to be no doubt, is calculated to cast a gloom over conservative Britons, and to cause them to inquire what the country is coming to."

1891-02-22T00:00:00Z,"NEWARK, N.J., Feb. 21. -- The Essex County Circuit Court was the scene of an exciting encounter between two litigants this morning.

1891-02-22T00:00:00Z,"By yesterday's bank statement, the surplus reserve is reduced to $15,300,000. The loss for the week was a little over $3,000,000, which seems to be due mainly to a large reduction in specie. Assuming that the movement of the money currents will be about the same this year as last, it is likely the surplus will be further reduced in the next two or three weeks and may get down to about $10,000,000, possibly less."
1891-02-22T00:00:00Z,"If Mr. Jay Gould had observed the proprieties of the occasion he should, on his arrival in Atlanta, have paid his respects to Gov. Northen. This was his plain duty. The Chief Magistrate of Georgia was entitled to this courtesy at his hands."

Jones is pulling every wire in his reach that he thinks will forward his ambition to succeed Hill as Governor. Of late several opportunities to make addresses have offered, and he has eagerly embraced them. A week or so ago he made a speech to the Grangers assembled at Elmira."

He calculates that during a more than mainly dense fog something like ten tons of rain suspended over the metropolis."
1891-02-22T00:00:00Z,"Celts, Latins, Slavs, Anglo-Saxons force their way into a new country and govern an aboriginal race according to Celtic, Latin, Slav, or Anglo-Saxon methods. There may be varying accidents befalling the new-comers, but the civilization of the alien race finally predominates. We, as inheriting Anglo-Saxon ideas, believe that the laws and regulations we may have forced the native population to adopt are the best."

Instances have been reported where very narrow escapes were had, and others where disasters actually occurred, owing to the failure of these aids to navigation to sound their warning signals."
1891-02-22T00:00:00Z,"Apparently the military critics have not yet discarded the method of classifying merit that the literary critics have abolished, for Gen. Thoumas, an excellent military critic, places Turenne above Conde, and an excellent literary critic does not place Corneille above Racine or the reverse. It must be with army commanders as with poets."
1891-02-22T00:00:00Z,"Mr. HARRISON has nominated Mr. CHARLES FOSTER of Ohio to be Secretary of the Treasury. The friends of an honest currency can, we believe, accept this nomination with satisfaction. For some time Mr. FOSTER has not been prominent in public life, and we do not know that he has had occasion to express his views in regard to the free coinage of silver since it has become an urgent question."
1891-02-22T00:00:00Z,"A few hours before the final passage of the Tariff bill Mr. MCKINLEY procured, at the suggestion of the Window-Glass Trust, the insertion of a proviso requiring importers of window glass to use boxes of the smallest size known to the trade.

It is now allowed by law to accept any increase whatsoever in its fund."

1891-02-22T00:00:00Z,Many persons suppose that the quaint and musical Indian names in American geographical nomenclature are wholly unlike anything else in human language. There is a belief also that the aboriginal titles of our waters are the coinage and application of the rude savages discovered here in the fifteenth and sixteenth centuries. Both these ideas are erroneous.
1891-02-22T00:00:00Z,"Australians may consider themselves happy that, either because of the remoteness of their colonies or of their thoroughly practical trend of mind, they have not been worried with the irritating phrase fin de siecle, which appears to be the latest ""gag"" that has become fashionable in the dilettante circles of Paris and London."

1891-02-22T00:00:00Z,"WHO ORIGINATED THE UPAS TREE! -- Perhaps the deftest artist in this department of fabrication was George Steevens, the Shakespearean commentator. Animated by an impish spirit of trickery, to which jealousy of rival antiquaries may have lent a spice of malice, he industriously devised cunning snares for their feet."
1891-02-22T00:00:00Z,"Handwriting is often an index of character, though it does not follow that a graceful penmanship necessarily betokens a graceful life or that an uncouth scrawl denotes a disagreeable disposition. Perhaps no class of persons handle their pens more characteristically than composers of music, and it may be interesting to note the penmanship of some of America's musical geniuses."

1891-02-22T00:00:00Z,Mr. GLADSTONE'S speech on Friday fairly brings the disestablishment of the English Church in Wales into the category of living political questions. The retort to his remarks that will be made by the Tory speakers is one that could be made about his position on many other issues. It is that he has changed his mind.
1891-02-22T00:00:00Z,"AFAFITE, Egypt, via Suakin, Feb. 21. -- A severe engagement was fought at Tokar on Feb. 19 between the Egyptian troops who recently left El Teb and Osman Digna's forces. Nearly one thousand lives wore lost in the battle which followed the appearance of the Egyptians at Tokar."

1891-02-22T00:00:00Z,The great banquet hall of the Madison Square Garden presented a beautiful picture last night on the occasion of the annual dinner of the New-York Southern Society.

1891-02-22T00:00:00Z,"TRENTON, N.J., Feb. 21. -- The inconsistency of the pottery manufacturers of this city cropped out conspicuously again this week.

1891-02-22T00:00:00Z,"CHICAGO, Feb. 21. -- Crowded and fashionable houses have been the rule at the down-town theatres this week. At the Chicago Opera House the Bostonians achieved another marked hit by their production of De Koven and Smith's opera, ""Robin Hood.""

The treaties still exist, though they have not a great while to run, and all three huge armies back of them are still stern facts, but the loosening of ties has become at last so palpable that the whole world can see it."
1891-02-22T00:00:00Z,"FOSTORIA, Ohio, Feb. 21. -- The appointment of ex-Gov. Charles Foster to the office of Secretary of the Treasury is naturally accepted by the people of this part of Ohio as only one move in the natural order of things, as he has been for so long the central figure in the world of Fostoria that her citizens do not see why he should not be a central figure in the world at large."
1891-02-22T00:00:00Z,"THE PAINTINGS OF POMPEII. -- Of all the remarkable things found at Pompeii none are more important than the pictures, on account of the light they throw on ancient painting.

1891-02-22T00:00:00Z,"The State of California in one respect is wonderfully like great bisected funnel. Nowhere on earth is there just such a system of water-flow and outlet to the sea. All the run of her waters is ultimately westward and through one single channel, the pipe or spout of the funnel. The upper portion of the funnel has a long and curious narrow rim -- in other words, its gathering bowl is strangely steep and shallow."

1891-02-22T00:00:00Z,The first full week of Lent has passed and brought with it enough of incident and interest to make the fact that the penitential season has arrived almost forgotten.

1891-02-22T00:00:00Z,"The inquiry to be made by the Corner's jury concerning the collision in the tunnel will be an unusually important and interesting one, because the elaborate block-signal system used in the tunnel will be on trial, and because the New-Haven Company will be required to defend its almost inexplicable course with respect to the use of coal stoves."

1891-02-22T00:00:00Z,"The strange custom in America of appointing men to offices without any regard to their previous career or occupation frequently leads to the most extraordinary incidents, which to English readers unacquainted with transatlantic life would appear extravagant even if they witnessed them on the stage of some theatre devoted to opera bottle."
1891-02-22T00:00:00Z,"The investigation into the affairs of the Sugar Trust by the Senate Committee on General Laws was continued yesterday at the Metropole Hotel.

The results are interesting in showing the size, growth, and extension of the system of co-operative banking, which, notwithstanding its large proportions, has been until recently uncared for by the State authorities."

The position in which they were found and the circumstances surrounding them gave unmistakable evidence of their having escaped death by the flood which precipitated the terrible catastrophe only to meet it in a more tortuous manner by starvation or suffocation."

BEHRING and KITASATO, had discovered, as they believed, a method of making animals proof against lockjaw and diphtheria. These experiments seemed to show conclusively that the blood-serum or an animal which had been made proof or ""immune"" against these diseases can be used as a curative lymph on other animals in which tetanus or diphtheria is manifested."
1891-02-23T00:00:00Z,"There were none but partisan reasons for depriving the Inter-State Commerce Commission of the benefit of the experience which Mr. SCHOONMAKER has acquired by his four years' service. The duties of the commission are in effect judicial, and the knowledge and experience acquired by its members are of such value that no change ought to be made except for reasons that have no connection with politics."
1891-02-23T00:00:00Z,"BOSTON, Feb. 22. -- Investigation indicates that the story told by Jacob F. Goss, a Lynn shoemaker, about ""the extreme hardship and rough usage"" the men and girls who lately went from Lynn to Caracas, Venezuela, to work in a new shoe factory there have been subjected to, may be a veritable cock-and-bull yarn. Arthur Fuller of the Boston firm of Swain, Fuller Co. characterizes Goss's statements as evidently false from beginning to end."

Marsh, formerly a distinguished member of the New-York Bar, but of late devoting his entire attention to the alleged phenomena of Spiritualism, is now a resident of this city.

1891-02-23T00:00:00Z,"ST. LOUIS, Mo., Feb. 22. -- Probably five thousand people visited Calvary Cemetery to-day to look upon the spot where rest the remains of Gen. William T. Sherman.

The enormity of the disaster is beginning to be realized. The loss of life exceeds that in any other mining disaster in Canada. It is placed at 117 men and boys."
1891-02-23T00:00:00Z,One of the chief grounds of opposition to the bill reported in the Senate by the Foreign Affairs Committee in relation to the Nicaragua Canal seems to be the fear that in some way it may bring us into collision with Great Britain on account of the stipulations of the Clayton-Bulwer treaty of 1850.

PAUL, Feb. 23. -- Senator Craig this afternoon introduced the Minnesota Congressional Reapportionment bill which the Democrats and all the Alliance men of both houses have agreed upon.

It is evidently so regarded in London."

But it also has sternly urgent problems for them to work at. In armed Europe the greatest of these problems is to discover superior new methods of killing men. In unarmed America the most pressing question is how to transport busy people most rapidly from point to point."

1891-02-24T00:00:00Z,"On the general theory that men who are holding over in office awaiting the appointment of their successors do not make as good public servants as men who are serving their regular terms, it would appear that Mayor Grant is deliberately neglecting his duty to the people in not appointing Police Justices to succeed Justices Murray and Smith, whose terms expired Nov. 4. That the delay is simply a makeshift apparently goes without saying."
1891-02-24T00:00:00Z,"Although the report of the majority of the Coinage Committee on the Free-Comage bill is logically reasoned with reference to the immediate situation, it betrays marks of the curious confusion of mind prevailing in this country as to the currency. As we have already remarked, the silver-mine owners themselves ought to find the arguments of the report conclusive, since they are in fact addressed chiefly to them."

1891-02-24T00:00:00Z,"It is inevitable that the politics of Canada should appear to us on this side of the border as somewhat Pedlingtonian. It is not only that Canada is a much smaller country than the United States. It is also that Canada's relations with us are managed not by Canada herself, but by Great Britain, and that the declarations of Canadian statesman upon international affairs have a happy irresponsibility."

1891-02-24T00:00:00Z,"Our Washington dispatches report this morning a practically perfunctory debate on the defects and faults of the Government printing system. It is a little ridiculous to call that a system which has no adequate rules, no responsible administrator, and no fixed purpose.

Hill or the Gutermuth murder.

1891-02-27T00:00:00Z,"ALBANY, Feb. 26. -- If Speaker Sheehan had any claims for the nomination for Lieutenant Governor next Fall he has ruined them during the past two days by his arbitrary action in suppressing the petition of the Catholic priests of New-York City against the Stadler dance-house bill. A more outrageous decision, for partisanship and shortsightedness, and a more complete repudiation of the right of appeal have seldom been seen in a legislative body."

The young man was disappointed in love, and the fact of his former intended being in Norwich to purchase her wedding outfit and the interview he had with her was too much for him to bear. Honeywell left this note:"

Magee, the Allegheny County Republican leader. Until the November election, when there were any honors to be had, they went to the friends of Senator Quay, between whom and Mr. Magee there is an impassable gulf."
1891-02-27T00:00:00Z,"WASHINGTON, Feb. 26. -- Late to-night the report reached this city from Chicago that Mrs. James G. Blaine wad seriously ill.

One of President CLEVELAND'S last official acts was the vetoing of a bill for this purpose. He described the proposed repayment as a ""gift,"" a ""sheer, bald gratuity,"" and his objections to it, based on constitutional grounds and on equity, were absolutely unanswerable."

Seven years ought to be long enough in this enlightened age to test the merits of any statute."

1891-02-28T00:00:00Z,President McMillan of the Amateur Athletic Union is being ridiculed for the course taken in the organization of the Atlantic Athletic Association at Philadelphia Monday. Mr. McMillan did not know that his association had no power to adopt by-laws or to elect members of the Board of Governors of the Amateur Athletic Union.

1891-02-28T00:00:00Z,"The testimony taken by the Coroner's jury concerning the recent collision shows how difficult it is at times to see the signals which are displayed in the tunnel.

It does not appear that this gong alarm was heard by any one on the New-Haven train, but it may have been in operation."

1891-02-28T00:00:00Z,"Piscatorial prophets are finding many signs of an early angling season, but their judgment is based upon observations similar to those which may be made almost every season. The fact that flounders have been seen in the bays which they are accustomed to haunt and that a few of them have been so rash as to eat worms lined with hooks does not necessarily mean an early fishing season."
1891-02-28T00:00:00Z,The investigation into the disaster of a week ago in the big tunnel leading out of the Grand Central Station was continued yesterday by Coroner Levy and his jury. As the investigation goes on it becomes more and more evident that there is nothing to occasion surprise in the fact that such an accident occurred under the existing conditions. It is only surprising that there have not been many more of them.

But the element of danger in the stove bars that absolutely."

1891-02-28T00:00:00Z,"The contest in Canada is taking pretty much the course which, when I last wrote to you, it seemed likely to take. The dissolution of Parliament before the regular time, and with the electoral roll imperfect, was justified, you will remember, on the ground that the Government was about to make commercial overtures to the United States, and required the sanction of a freshly-elected Parliament for that purpose."

HILL is reported as having admitted that his refusal to recognize BULKELEY as the Governor of Connecticut is not right -- or was a ""mistake,"" as the report has it -- but as claiming that it was ""good Democratic politics.""

It appears that he went to Brazil with the unconcealed purpose of subordinating his official position to newspaper syndicate work. He wrote letters with a free pen as if he were not connected with the United States Government."
1891-02-28T00:00:00Z,"The second performance of ""Tristan und Isolde"" at the Metropolitan Opera House last evening was attended by a comparatively small audience. Those who do not like Wagnerian music may possibly explain this by saying that it was because the public cannot stand this music-drama. But it will hardly do to assume that it is possible to crowd a house with the dramas of the Nibelang cycle and empty it with ""Tristan."""

1891-03-04T00:00:00Z,"ALBANY, March 3. -- A bill that ought to be killed before it is a day older was ordered to third reading in the Senate to-day.

1891-03-05T00:00:00Z,"ALBANY, N.Y., March 4. -- When David B. Hill awoke this morning he heard something drop. The news from the various towns in the State which held elections yesterday was not encouraging to the Democratic Senator, who, after the terrific tidal wave of last Fall that was looked upon as having wrecked the Republican Party irretrievably, believed that the Democrats would sweep the State in the Spring."
1891-03-05T00:00:00Z,"WASHINGTON, March 4. -- While the bill to provide for international copyright, which has finally become a law, is not entirely satisfactory to any of the friends of such a copyright, and is particularly unsatisfactory to its opponents, all of its advocates feel that a most gratifying victory has been gained in securing from the American Congress an indorsement of the principle of international copyright."
1891-03-05T00:00:00Z,"ALBANY, March 4. -- That Senator Stewart is becoming expert in the methods of legislation was proved to-day. He had a subway bill, which he bunched with several others, and which, in his most demure and quiet tones, he requested to be ordered to third reading."
1891-03-05T00:00:00Z,"HARTFORD, Conn., March 4. -- The action of Gov. Bulkeley in sending the name of Dr. Joseph W. Alsop of Middletown, who was elected by the Democrats as Lieutenant Governor in November, to the Senate this afternoon for confirmation as member of the State Board of Agriculture for four years from July next, was not calculated to advance the efforts now in progress for a settlement of the legislative controversy."
1891-03-05T00:00:00Z,"It has been proved over and over again that ""prohibition does not prohibit"" -- that is to say, that intoxicating liquors are extensively sold and drank in States where the sale of them is forbidden by law. The brewers in this city, however, have just supplied the Prohibitionists with a piece of evidence that prohibition at least diminishes the consumption of intoxicating drinks."

In the Senate the end came with decorum and without picturesqueness."

1891-03-05T00:00:00Z,"When Mr. ROBESON was Secretary of the Navy it used to be said that the function of an American man-of-war was to serve as ""a basis for repairs."" One is inclined to apply that expression to the Copyright bill as it passed Congress and went to the President for his signature. The application is not wholly just, because the bill has one very great and positive merit."

LOUIS, March 4. -- Isador Frauenthal of this city, who committed suicide at Cincinnati this morning, together with Ernst Sallinger of Philadelphia, was eighteen years of age.

1891-03-05T00:00:00Z,"OTTAWA, March 4. -- The future fiscal policy of Canada will be determined at the polls to-morrow. Never since confederation has a political struggle been waged with such vigor and acrimony as the present campaign. A blinding snow storm raged throughout Central Canada all day. The roads in the country are almost impassable, and as a result the vote which will be polled in Ontario and Quebec will probably not be heavy."

PAUL, Minn., March 4. -- The Democratic and Alliance State Senators are in high feather to-night over the fact that they have secured the publication of the evidence of corruption in the famous Washburn-Sabin contest, the greatest campaign card of the year.

1891-03-05T00:00:00Z,"In marked contrast with the attitude and remarks of Mr. REED was the modest and dignified farewell with which Vice President MORTON acknowledged the deserved tribute of gratitude and esteem offered him by the Senate.

1891-03-06T00:00:00Z,It is a disgrace that such a measure as the rumsellers' excise bill should even have to be seriously opposed before a legislative committee.

1891-03-06T00:00:00Z,"OTTAWA, Ontario, March 5. -- Sir John Macdonald and his Tory Government are probably sustained by a slight majority. Incomplete returns give the Conservatives 101 and the Liberals 89 seats respectively. When the back counties are heard from, if the Liberal gains continue, the Premier's majority of 51 when Parliament was dissolved will be still further reduced."
1891-03-06T00:00:00Z,"Our Washington dispatches describe a trick of the Republican leaders to avoid a part of the responsibility for expenditures made necessary by their action.

The opera has proved so much of an attraction that it will be kept on until the middle of next week, when the bill will be changed to ""Erminie."""
1891-03-22T00:00:00Z,"CHICAGO, March 21. -- One of the most efficient labor-saving devices ever worked is in use on the top of a sixteen-story building in process of erection. The building is constructed of iron and brick, the iron framework being pushed up two or three stories ahead of the lining of brick walls. The structural iron used in the frame is very heavy."

1891-03-22T00:00:00Z,"ELMIRA, N.Y., March 21. -- This city is practically without a local government because of a dead-lock over the question of appointments. The origin of the trouble was the action of a minority faction of the Democratic Party, backed by the Elmira Gazette and Free Press and a few Republican Aldermen and independents, in making a slate and attempting to run it through at the first meeting of the new Council."

1891-03-22T00:00:00Z,"As examples of the best art products of the most artistic people that the world has ever produced, Japanese swords long ago attracted the attention of the modern connoisseur and collector. It is, however, only within a few years that it has been possible to make much progress in this collecting. The sentimental regard of the Japanese for these heirlooms has stood in the way of their acquisition by outsiders."
1891-03-22T00:00:00Z,"The fairies have been zealously working during the last few years to introduce their handiwork into every branch of the earth's trade. The semi-annual world's fair gotten up by the milliners is the best opportunity of bringing their goods to market, and they do not wait to be formally invited. Perhaps they have no Secretary of State to tell them when they have been slighted."

All the crews, 'Varsity, Senior, Junior, Sophomore, and Freshman Class crews, are now on the river, the Mott Haven men are using the outdoor running tracks, and the baseball men are on Jarvis Field."

1891-03-22T00:00:00Z,The contemporary stage is not so richly supplied with actors of noble ambition that the loss of LAWRENCE BARRETT will not be severely felt. He was an alert and able man and his influence was all for good. Even the mistakes of judgment he made as a manager and producer of plays were due to his desire to keep alive the best traditions of the English drama.
1891-03-22T00:00:00Z,"WASHINGTON, March 21. -- Indian Commissioner Morgan seems to be in some danger of losing his place, and the report is believed here that the President has asked for his resignation. When he came up for confirmation in the Senate there was opposition to him, but with the assistance of Republicans and Democrats, who did not care much about the report that he was hostile to the Catholic missionaries, he was confirmed."

1891-03-22T00:00:00Z,"SCRANTON, Penn., March 21. -- The stories of Anna Dickinson's hopeless insanity, recently published in various newspapers, are extravagantly incorrect. Her case is entirely different from that of John McCullough, Bartley Campbell, and others, with whose illness hers has been inaccurately compared. THE TIMES'S representative talked with Miss Dickinson's sister, Miss Susan E. Dickinson, to-day, at her home in West Pittston, and found her quite hopeful of Anna's ultimate recovery."

Martin and myself were not aware of our proximity to other escaping prisoners, we subsequently learned that quite a number who had come through the tunnel the night before lay concealed along the Chicka-hominy this day.

1891-03-22T00:00:00Z,"The disturbed condition of Samoa, set forth in recent-tidings from that archipelago, suggests that the real value of the triple compact made at Berlin has yet to be tested.

1891-03-23T00:00:00Z,Our Albany correspondent points out the disparity between the cost and the practical benefit of the numerous investigations that have been made in recent years by legislative committees in this State.

Hughes, Secretary of the Manhattan Athletic Club, last week."
1891-03-23T00:00:00Z,"LITTLE ROCK, Ark., March 22. -- The whole disgraceful truth about the looting of the Arkansas State Treasury is gradually coming out. There is official authority, the report of the legislative Committee on Treasurer's Accounts, for the statement that the actual deficit will reach $369,746.83. The ex-Treasurer had tried to cut this down by tendering in partial settlement certain wildcat or worthless scrip of various kinds, but this cannot change the actual facts."

Nowhere on the globe are types of these light-draught carriers seen in such abundance and in such remarkably efficient design as one finds along the North River slips from Barclay Street south to the slip of the Staten Island boats.
1891-03-28T00:00:00Z,"LEXINGTON, Ky., March 27. -- W.C. France, who is one of the largest breeders of trotters in the country to-day, expressed himself as in favor of the movement looking toward the control of registration by the breeders, as the business has become too large and important to be under the control of a man or any little set of men."

1891-03-28T00:00:00Z,"There are yet several hundred veteran policemen and police pensioners and a few citizens who recall a crime which cost a police officer his life, a singular condition of municipal affairs, and a very strange murder trial whenever they pass old Odd Fellows' Hall at Centre and Grand Streets. At 4 A.M. on the 21st of July, 1857, Officer Eugene Anderson of the Fourteenth Precinct was patrolling his post there."
1891-03-28T00:00:00Z,"It is reported that Mayor GRANT desires to leave to the city a monument of his administration in the form of a proper and adequate municipal building. The ambition is legitimate and even laudable. It should be borne in mind, however, that the efforts of the last unmixed and unchecked Tammany administration in the way of public buildings were not calculated to commend the memory of that administration."

A work of supreme difficulty, requiring the most delicate handling, was confided to Mr. Currie relating to engagements of England to protect Belgium."
1891-03-28T00:00:00Z,"It seems that some of the proprietors of the protected poolrooms are not satisfied to play fair in their game, in which they have about everything to win and mighty little to lose.

1891-03-28T00:00:00Z,"OTTAWA, Ontario, March 27. -- British Columbia and the northwest coast on the Pacific Ocean are inhabited by a number of tribes belonging to seven or eight linguistic stocks; and Dr. Dawson, in his report on the Queen Charlotte Islands, published by the Geological Survey not long ago, gives a most interesting description of the Haidas, one of the tribes, or families."

But that prospect is seriously threatened and put in jeopardy by a pending bill in the Assembly at Albany, behind which is concentrated the power and influence of all the gas companies of Brooklyn."

The matter is one of no small anxiety, not only to the clergymen themselves in a great many instances, but also to their congregations."

1891-03-28T00:00:00Z,"The fact that the Fifty-first Congress appropriated over $1,000,000,000 for expenditures for the fiscal year of 1891-2 ought to set an intelligent people thinking. But the truth is that the intelligent people of America find it a bore to think. Yet, to ignore this enormity will be a disgrace to the 65,000,000 free citizens who inhabit this great Republic."
1891-03-28T00:00:00Z,"National Bank Examiner Hepburn completed his examination of the Washington National Bank yesterday and sent his statement to Controller Lacey. He said he had discovered nothing that would change his original statement regarding the impairment of the bank's capital -- $148,248. The answers to his circular letter to the banks about the items ""due from banks and bankers,"" showed that the facts were as shown by the books of the Washington National Bank."

In a letter to Mr. James Jeffrey Roche of this city Mr. Lathrop reviews briefly the reasons for his change of faith, and these, doubtless, operated to influence his wife."

1891-03-28T00:00:00Z,"The mind of Mr. BLAINE is never very transparent, but at present it seems a little more impenetrable than usual.

1891-03-28T00:00:00Z,"ALBANY, N.Y., March 27. -- One of those delightful exhibitions of consistency, for which the Hill wing of the Democratic Party is famous, was given in the Assembly Committee on Commerce and Navigation this morning. Mr. Jacobs's bill, which has passed the Senate, prohibiting the Union Ferry Company of Brooklyn from carrying out its contemplated course of raising the rates in commission hours was under consideration, and a motion was made to report it."
1891-03-28T00:00:00Z,"CHICAGO, March 27. -- Dr. William D. Gentry of this city claims to be the possessor of a microbe of the grip, the first ever captured of even heard of.

1891-03-28T00:00:00Z,"INDIANAPOLIS, March 27. -- The Legislature which recently packed up its traps and went home left a clear atmosphere behind it, and doubtless she two years that will intervene before another meeting of the General Assembly will emphasize the fact that the Democratic majority served the best interests of the State, and built a good foundation upon which to conduct the next campaign."
1891-03-28T00:00:00Z,"NEW-HAVEN, March 27. -- New-York's representatives on the diamond field opened the baseball season here to-day. As regards the result the contest was something of a disappointment to genial Manager Mutrie, but the boys did not show any strong desire to win. They simply regarded the contest in its true light -- a practice game -- and in consequence did not exert themselves."
1891-03-28T00:00:00Z,"The prodigious efforts required to enable the police to secure evidence against the young men who acted as clerks at Minden's poolroom, 1,313 Broadway, seems to have exhausted them, and they are now resting on their oars, satisfied, apparently, that they have done all that the law requires them to do."

1891-03-28T00:00:00Z,"Anything in the nature of practical opposition on the part of the city officials to the attempt of Jay Gould's elevated railroad to ""grab"" Battery Park is yet to be discovered. The men whom Tammany put in power, the Mayor and the Park Commissioners, whose special province it is to guard against any such legislative enactment as this park ""grab,"" are merely passive when questioned as to what they intend to do."

1891-03-29T00:00:00Z,"The fourth month of the year presents many attractions for those who follow with unwavering interest the ever-changing movements of the sun and his family of worlds, and, while not especially notable in an astronomical sense, it stilt has sufficient to engage the attention of the star gazer. The sun has now passed through a little more than half of its apparent journey between its southerly and northerly standing points."
1891-03-29T00:00:00Z,"When Capt. Martin heard the pickets announce themselves as belonging to the Twenty-first Virginia, he knew that the end had come to our flight.

1891-03-29T00:00:00Z,"SCRANTON, Penn., March 28. -- There have been few denunciations of the New-Orleans tragedy in this vicinity, either public or private. The cold-blooded murder of Paymaster McClure and Foreman Flanaghan on the Wilkesbarre Mountains by a gang of Italian brigands is still too fresh in the public mind hereabout to permit the squandering of much sympathy on those who met their fate for the killing of Chief Hennessy."
1891-03-29T00:00:00Z,"KANSAS CITY, Mo., March 28. -- Commissioner Midgley of the Lake Division of the Western Traffic Association has sent a telegram to Jay Gould demanding the discharge of the Missouri Pacific official who authorized their rate on sugar.

1891-03-29T00:00:00Z,"The agitation of the mind of a portion of the Brooklyn public over the placing of the statue of the late Mr. BEECHER is not unnatural. Mr. BEECHER, during his long life in Brooklyn, was the object of much interest and admiration and even reverence, but also of unfailing disputes.

1891-03-29T00:00:00Z,"CARRIER PIGEONS FLYING TO AND FRO. -- Capt. Malogoli, the head of the Italian military carrier-pigeon depots, has, after immense and unwearying trouble, succeeded in getting his pigeons to fly backward and forward between Rome and Civita Vecchia (seventy-two kilometers.)

1891-03-29T00:00:00Z,The ballet at the Metropolitan Opera House in New-York City is as like that at the Paris Opera as anything we have. There is as much similarity as is possible between an ephemeral institution under private control and a permanent establishment maintained by the Government.

Dr. CROSBY was not a man of brilliant genius or exceptional attainments. He was merely an accomplished man of good faculties, who was keenly interested in public affairs."
1891-03-31T00:00:00Z,"ALBANY, March 30. -- Jay Gould's battery grab bill is still with Mr. Blumenthal's Cities Committee, and is expected to be aired for a third hearing Thursday afternoon. Mr. Blumenthal said to-night that the only person he expected to be present to advocate its passage was the gentleman who drafted it, Charles H. Butler of New-York, who is supposed to have been retained in Mr. Gould's interests."
1891-03-31T00:00:00Z,"WASHINGTON, March 30. -- The Washington news dispatches of a New-York paper representing that Secretary Foster had decided to displace Collector Erhardt and Appraiser Cooper, and afterward to investigate their management of the branches of the customs service committed to their care, have been promptly denied, as might have been expected."
1891-03-31T00:00:00Z,"Our Italian fellow-citizens may learn the difference between the persecution of a nationality and the prosecution of malefactors by comparing the account of the slaughter of offending Italians in New-Orleans and the mobbing of unoffending Chinamen at Pittsburg. In the former case the people of New-Orleans had concluded, when the law failed to vindicate the community from the assaults of an organization of outlaws, to take the law into their own hands."
1891-03-31T00:00:00Z,"The dead-lock in the Connecticut Legislature has continued for almost three months, and the prospect of breaking it does not appear to be very hopeful. In the meantime the necessary work of legislation and all provision for the support of the State Government has been prevented. The New-Englander and Yale Review, published at New-Haven, contains three articles by prominent lawyers of that city on the peculiar situation existing at Hartford."
1891-03-31T00:00:00Z,"When New-York City lost the services of Mr. Abram S. Hewitt, as Mayor for a second term, we were indebted to the Metropolitan Police for that consummation. With the business acumen that marked his appreciation of affairs Mayor Hewitt discovered and remarked publicly that quite as good men could be obtained for $800 a year to serve on the police force as those who were receiving $1,000 and $1,200."
1891-03-31T00:00:00Z,"Clad in Spring clothing and adorned with Easter cravats, the three Excise Commissioners, Alexander Meakim, Joseph Koch, and Edward T. Fitzpatrick, accompanied by twice as many lawyers, filed into Part III. of Court of General Sessions yesterday to undergo trial for malfeasance in office. Recorder Smyth has been sick for nearly a week, but he had recovered his health, yesterday so that he could come down to court."
1891-03-31T00:00:00Z,"The proceedings at the recent convention of the Republican League of Massachusetts in Boston had a very exhilarating effect upon the Boston Traveller. Our contemporary appears to have become acquainted then for the first time with THURSTON. The Traveller said: ""Ohio and Nebraska made the Yankee Republican heart glad yesterday by their statesmanlike array of facts, their loyal spirit, their deadly-in-earnest purpose, and their genuine eloquence."
1891-03-31T00:00:00Z,"The actual trial of Alphonse J. Stephani for the murder of ex-Judge Clinton G. Reynolds was begun in the Court of Oyer and Terminer yesterday before Presiding Justice of the Supreme Court Charles H. Van Brunt. Stephani sat at the end of the counsel table by the side of a Deputy Sheriff, who kept an exceedingly sharp watch on him."
1891-03-31T00:00:00Z,The discussion of the west side driveway project before the Board of Estimate and Apportionment yesterday was informal and had no result. The report presented by Joseph J. O'Donohue and four other members of the Mayor's Driveway Commission of Fifteen was not read because Controller Myers was not present at the beginning of the meeting.
1891-03-31T00:00:00Z,"CHICAGO, March 30. -- Fresh complications have risen to prevent an immediate settlement of the trouble caused by the cutting of passenger rates between St. Louis and Chicago by scalpers handling the tickets of the Jacksonville Southeastern Road. A meeting was held at Chairman Finley's office to-day by representatives of all the lines in interest to hear the report of the Chairman on the situation."
1891-03-31T00:00:00Z,"WASHINGTON, March 30. -- The marriage of Miss Grace Weston Fuller, eldest daughter of the Chief Justice, to Mr. Archibald Lapham Brown of Chicago, took place at 8 o'clock to-night at St. John's Church. The Rev. Dr. Douglas performed the ceremony. On the altar the large gold vases were heaped with Easter lilies and long-stemmed roses, while about the walls on either side of the chancel were palms and growing plants."
1891-03-31T00:00:00Z,"CHICAGO, March 30. -- McVicker's Theatre, which was burned Aug. 26, 1890, was reopened to-night and a brilliant audience, which packed the house, assembled to honor the occasion. Florence and Jefferson in ""The Rivals"" shared the applause with the management of the theatre."
1891-03-31T00:00:00Z,"The stock market reflected the sunny weather yesterday. Something that looked like the germ of a boom was in sight. Some stocks went up two or three points, a number advanced as much as one point, and the general list at the close showed that, practically, every stock advanced somewhat. There hasn't been a day like this in months."
1891-03-31T00:00:00Z,"The Grand Jury, which is investigating the tunnel disaster, came into court yesterday and asked for instructions concerning the act of June 18, 1887, regulating the heating of passenger cars by steam.

Weaver of Iowa in nomination as the Presidential candidate of the Alliance in 1892 in conversation with a TIMES reporter yesterday. Mr. Simpson said, as he named the Iowa man, that he did not think the Alliance officials had organized any well-defined boom for Mr. Weaver, but it seemed to him (Simpson) that Weaver was the most available and probable candidate."
1891-03-31T00:00:00Z,"The return of that annoying and vexatious malady known as the grip, its prevalence among all classes of society, and the difficulty experienced in curing it by medicinal remedies makes highly pertinent for public information the following letter from Chauncey M. Depew in relation to Reich's Tokayer Ausbruch, which had previously restored Cyrus W. Field, Mrs. William Astor, and others:"
1891-03-31T00:00:00Z,The controversy about the dangers of steam heating as applied to railroad cars seems to be giving rise to apprehensions on the part of timid travelers on the theory that where there is so much steam there must be some fire. This circumstance renders it desirable that the matter should be disposed of from the practical standpoint.
1891-03-31T00:00:00Z,"PITTSBURG, March 30. -- ""'Al' Johnson is not out of the woods yet nor will he pocket $30,000 when the National League settles with him, as most people think,"" said J. Palmer O'Neill to-day. ""In the first place he must settle with the New-York, Brooklyn, and Chicago National League Clubs, each one of which demands $4,000 for its interest and $1,200 advance money, or in all $13,200."
1891-03-31T00:00:00Z,"There is one place in town where the offense of kleptomania is almost excusable. That place is the silk department in the dry goods establishment of James McCreery Co. at Broadway and Eleventh Street, where the largest retail stock of silks in the world is displayed in bewildering variety to the feminine eye. The stock on view this Spring is especially attractive."
1891-03-31T00:00:00Z,A melancholy illustration of how the business of politics undermines the moral sentiments is afforded by Secretary FOSTER'S comment on an article concerning himself published in the Herald of yesterday. This article asserted with positiveness that the Secretary of the Treasury was about to perform a very base and mean act.
1891-03-31T00:00:00Z,"A great deal of very valuable information that is available to the District Attorney in the prosecution of poolroom keepers was yesterday given to THE TIMES by Anthony Comstock, the agent of the Society for the Suppression of Vice. Mr. Comstock's years of fighting against gamblers has familiarized him thoroughly with the laws that are pertinent."
1891-03-31T00:00:00Z,In THE TIMES of to-day I read an account of the tests applied to Mr. J.H. Brown's wire-wound gun at the testing grounds at Fort Wadsworth. The article gives such as clear and intelligible description of the gun that I readily recognize it as a much older invention than of the present time.
1891-03-31T00:00:00Z,"AUGUSTA, Me., March 30. -- The Ballot-Reform bill has finally passed the Maine Legislature and is now a law. It was a hard-fought battle and every inch of ground was closely contested by the bulldozing and unscrupulous opponents of the Australian system. A strong lobby had been at work against the bill from the day the session began -- probably the most influential that has ever been seen in Augusta."
1891-03-31T00:00:00Z,"WASHINGTON, March 30. -- Bids were opened in the Ordnance Office of the War Department to-day for the construction of twenty-five carriages for twelve-inch breech-loading rifled mortars. Only two bids were received."
1891-03-31T00:00:00Z,"DALLAS, Texas, March 30. -- People here are very much displeased with the recent utterances of the Rev. Joseph Cook of Boston, to the effect that the spirit of intolerance was such that he had canceled his dates in this State, and also with the report that the same cause led Explorer Stanley to do the same thing. These reports have done Texas great injustice."
1891-03-31T00:00:00Z,The history of the Washington Bank is made the subject of some very interesting and instructive comments by the Financial Chronicle in its latest number. That journal is well known for the conservative nature of its views and for the candor and circumspection with which it treats questions of this sort.
1891-03-31T00:00:00Z,"Commander Bicknell, Ensign Field, and nearly all the men composing the Galena's complement when she went ashore at Gay Head have returned to the Brooklyn Navy Yard. The court of inquiry that was hinted at when the accident was reported to the department has not yet been ordered, but the officers who were in charge of the ill-fated ship have determined to ask the department to name such a board at once."

Nothing, however, that Senator Pierce of Bristol has authorized will be changed by Mr. Seymour, who assigned his colleague from the Fourth District to act for him in his absence."
1891-04-01T00:00:00Z,"The introduction of a bill by a Tammany Senator for the appropriation of $500,000 from the money received from the National Government in refunding the direct tax of thirty years ago has a suspicious appearance of claptrap. This money has been turned into the general fund of the State, where it belongs, and appropriations cannot be made from it as a separate fund."
1891-04-01T00:00:00Z,"WASHINGTON, March 31. -- Secretary Foster probably protested too much yesterday when he declared that he knew nothing about the report that he was to dismiss Collector Erhardt and also Appraiser Cooper, and that those gentlemen were to be rewarded for their alleged incompetency by appointment in the diplomatic service of their country."
1891-04-01T00:00:00Z,Poles and wires in many of the down-town streets will have to come down to-day. Mayor Grant sent the following orders to Commissioner of Public Works Gilroy yesterday afternoon:
1891-04-01T00:00:00Z,"PROVIDENCE, R.I., March 31. -- With fair weather to-morrow, the vote for general officers and the Legislature promises to be among the largest over cast here, and the result will be interesting in many ways. As important as it may be considered in emphasizing the result of the November elections, the outcome will depend to an extent which can hardly be realized outside this little State upon local issues, factional contests, and personal antagonism."

1891-04-01T00:00:00Z,"One of the best numbers for a year past is the April number of the Century. A description of fetichism in the Congo country by E.J. Glave, who has served under Stanley, makes an interesting contribution to this inexhaustible African topic. The account of the Panama route to California, as taken in 1849, is a picturesque piece of narrative, properly illustrated from contemporary sketches."
1891-04-01T00:00:00Z,"WASHINGTON, March 31. -- The quoted utterances of Senator Pugh of Alabama concerning Mr. Cleveland's chances of support in the South should he be the Democratic candidate for President next year are quite in line with what the Senator had to say when Mr. Cleveland's anti-free-coinage letter made its appearance, and are not likely to be of any more consequence."
1891-04-01T00:00:00Z,"The Bar Association last night, at an adjourned special meeting that could hardly be called representative of that body, passed the resolutions prepared by its committee on the amendment of the law, as epitomizing the objections to the proposed amendments to the judiciary articles of the State Constitution. These resolutions were as follows:"

1891-04-01T00:00:00Z,"WASHINGTON, March 31. -- There are no lights ""burning in the War Office to-night,"" but there has been a great deal of absurd talk about war with Italy, or Italian war on the United States, since it became known, at the close of business hours at the State Department, that Baron Fava, the Minister of Italy to this Government, had presented to Secretary Blaine his letter of recall."
1891-04-01T00:00:00Z,"The satisfaction that will be felt at the indictment of the Directors of the New-York, New-Haven and Hartford Railroad Company will not be due to a desire to see these gentlemen personally punished for misdemeanor but to the assurance it affords that those who control the management of a corporation can be held individually responsible for its violation of a law intended to protect the lives and safety of the public."
1891-04-01T00:00:00Z,"ALBANY, March 31. -- The dynamite cartridges which THE TIMES has so judiciously placed under the plans of Jay Gould have exploded, and the bill died in the Assembly Cities Committee this afternoon very suddenly and unexpectedly."

1891-04-01T00:00:00Z,"SAN FRANCISCO, March 31. -- Adolph Spreckels was seen this morning regarding the statement that Spreckels's sugar refineries and those of the Havemeyers had combined to divide the sugar market. He admitted that an understanding with the Havemeyers had been reached, but it did not relate to division of territory, and prices would continue to be regulated by supply and demand."
1891-04-01T00:00:00Z,"NEWPORT, R.I., March 31. -- An incident occurred this morning that has caused a big sensation, and is generally condemned as an attempt to compromise the Newport Observer, the only Republican paper published here.

Rives and Mrs. Frothingham, whose trunks were seized by customs inspectors at the Cunard pier, visited the Custom House yesterday, and their personal affects were released from custody.

1891-04-01T00:00:00Z,"Mayor Grant and Controller Myers have another contention on hand. It is all about the collection of the $2,292,159.73, principal and interest, which the city claims is due it as a reimbursement for the Union defense fund advanced in 1861. The Controller has made a contract with ex-Congressman John J. Adams whereby the latter will receive 7 1/2 per cent. for collecting the principal."
1891-04-01T00:00:00Z,"BAYONNE, N.J., March 31. -- New complications arose here to-day in the Mayoralty fight between Mayor John Newman and ex-Councilman William C. Parr. Notice was served upon City Clerk William C. Hamilton protesting against the future issue of official ballots with the Mayor's name at the head of the Republican tickets. Application for a mandamus was threatened. Daniel J. Murray, attorney for Mr. Farr, served the notice."
1891-04-01T00:00:00Z,"Interest in the trial of Alphonse J. Stephani for the murder of ex-Judge Clinton G. Reynolds continued unabated yesterday. The large Oyer and Terminer Court room was filled with as many persons as it could comfortably seat, and as Judge Van Brunt's orders were imperative that no more than could be seated should be admitted, many were turned away."
1891-04-01T00:00:00Z,A dozen official heads were chopped off at the Custom House yesterday. They belonged to watchmen who had made the sad mistake of slumbering or of being away from their posts of duty when two Treasury inspectors made an early morning tour of the wharves.

1891-04-01T00:00:00Z,There was not conference between the poolsellers and their official protectors yesterday. This was a subject of deep regret in the dives when word was passed around that a general swoop might be expected without further warning. The gamblers understood this to mean that they must get their houses in order by disposing of all possible evidence that might tell against them in a court.
1891-04-01T00:00:00Z,"TRENTON, March 31. -- Attorney General Stockton (or, rather, Mr. Johnson, his assistant) has just discovered an error in an engrossed bill that may practically wipe out the new ballot-reform law. The just-adjourned Legislature was solicited to exempt towns of 4,000 population and smaller from the operation of the law, and for some inexplicable reason the Legislature passed a bill to that effect and sent it to the Governor and he signed it."
1891-04-01T00:00:00Z,"HARTFORD, Conn., March 31. -- The Senate Dead-lock Committee was granted an extension of time this afternoon on the ground that all expedients looking toward a settlement of the controversy had not been exhausted. Judge Morris was telegraphed to meet the Democrats here this evening, but up to a late hour had not put in an appearance. This has led to the idea that a conference is in progress either at Meriden or New-Haven."
1891-04-01T00:00:00Z,"After a thorough investigation of the tunnel disaster of Feb. 20, the Grand Jury yesterday failed to find any of the officers of the New-York, New-Haven and Hartford Railroad Company chargeable with manslaughter, but they did find twelve Directors and officers liable for misdemeanor in allowing the deadly car stove to be used in the cars on the road."

1891-04-01T00:00:00Z,"It was so cold yesterday that only a small crowd turned out to see the New-Yorks and the New-Havens play. The members of the home team did not exert themselves, favoring their arms as much as they could. The New-Havens are badly crippled, and had to play several men who will not be members of the team when the International League championship season opens."
1891-04-01T00:00:00Z,"The family council of the BONAPARTES which will take place soon, will relate exclusively to private matters arising under the will of Prince NAPOLEON, who left to his oldest son only what the law requires and gave all that he could to his second son, LOUIS.

1891-04-01T00:00:00Z,"RALEIGH, N.C., March 31. -- If anything can put life into the hitherto moribund Republican Party of North Carolina, the acts of the Legislature recently adjourned will have that effect. The members as a body were the most ignorant that ever assembled in the Capitol. They were narrow-minded, bigoted, niggardly, and without public spirit."
1891-04-01T00:00:00Z,"There was a pleasing spectacle in the Court of General Sessions yesterday, a spectacle calculated to make the bosom of every citizen of New-York swell with pride. The three Commissioners of Excise, Alexander Meakim, Joseph Koch, and Edward T. Fitzpatrick, all eminently respectable-looking persons, stood before the bar of that court to answer to Recorder Smyth and a jury a charge of malfeasance in office, on which they were indicted by the Grand Jury."
1891-04-01T00:00:00Z,"ALBANY, March 31. -- The dirty water of the Legislature is beginning to flow, and it is not surprising that each day develops some new specimen of political depravity or financial debauchery. Last Friday the Assembly Committee on Commerce and Navigation had a hearing on the bill of Senator Jacobs, to prohibit the Union Ferry Company from raising its ferry rates during commission hours, as it proposes to do."
1891-04-02T00:00:00Z,"Controller Myers and Chamberlain Crain yesterday made an effort to discover why the property of the Union Ferry Company had increased $2,000,000 in value in two years.

1891-04-02T00:00:00Z,"About once in ten years a strenuous effort is made to secure a thorough revision of the tax laws of this State, but thus far comparatively little has been accomplished.

1891-04-02T00:00:00Z,Controller Myers's statement in reference to his contract with ex-Congressman John J. Adams to collect the Union defense fund claim from the Government called out a statement yesterday from Corporation Counsel Clark. He said:

1891-04-02T00:00:00Z,"ALBANY, April 1. -- The innocent-looking bill by which the Brooklyn gas monopoly seeks further to despoil the people of the big city across the East River is now on the order of third reading in the House. It is entitled, ""An act in relation to transportation corporations, excepting railroads,"" and its framer, Mr. Cooney, has pushed it to its present place by means that cannot be too severely denounced."
1891-04-02T00:00:00Z,"LONDON, April 1. -- It is reported here that a prominent Italian has warned Americans against the danger of touring in Italy this year, in view of the excitement and feeling caused in that country by the New-Orleans affair and Baron Fava's recall."
1891-04-02T00:00:00Z,"Yesterday was a busy day among wholesale grocers and jobbers, as the reduction in prices of sugars went into effect, and all were overwhelmed with orders. Both wholesalers and retailers have for some time past been carrying very light stocks."

Foreman Cameron had a couple of short presentments to read, one concerning the tunnel disaster and a second referring to excise cases. The presentments were as follows:"
1891-04-04T00:00:00Z,"Letters received in this city from Chile yesterday told the same story of business stagnation in that republic that has been brought by the mails for the last month. The revolution has had the effect of paralyzing trade. Some nitrate is shipped from ports in the hands of the insurgents, but the amount is not very great. For one thing, it is said, workmen are not easily to be obtained."
1891-04-04T00:00:00Z,"ELIZABETH, N.J., April 3. -- The prospect now is that, instead of racing being carried on at the New-Jersey Jockey Club grounds here, the land, about sixty acres, will be devoted to farming purposes this year. Capt. James H. Corey of this city says he has made an offer to the club, which it will accept, whereby he agrees to pay $1,000 rental for the grounds for a year."

1891-04-05T00:00:00Z,"OLD POINT COMFORT, Va., April 4. -- There were a hundred college boys here during Easter week, seventy of them from Yale and the rest hailing from a dozen 'Varsities.

1891-04-05T00:00:00Z,"The Union Club is the last club in the world to intentionally court public attention, but last Thursday evening it took a step which will furnish clubdom with a nine days' sensation. Nothing but the threatened relegation of the club to second or third place on the list of New-York's swell clubs could have moved the Union to increase its membership."
1891-04-05T00:00:00Z,"BERLIN, April 4. -- Negotiations have been resumed between Mr. William Walter Phelps, the United States Minister, and Chancellor von Caprivi on the question of the withdrawal of the prohibition against American pork products, and there are more hopeful prospects of an early and successful issue than recent reports have led the public to believe."
1891-04-05T00:00:00Z,"Amateur athletic affairs are dull enough these days. Just as soon as Secretary C.C. Hughes of the Manhattan Athletic Club cooled down and people became tired of talking about his attack on A.G. Mills, New-York Athletic Club, and James E. Sullivan, New-Jersey Athletic Club, there was little to interest anybody. It looks now as though everything would move along smoothly in preparation for the open games out of doors in May."
1891-04-05T00:00:00Z,"CHARLOTTESVILLE, Va., April 4. -- The bad weather which began last week has continued throughout this, and its effects have been demoralizing to the baseball management.

1891-04-05T00:00:00Z,"RICHMOND, Va., April 4. -- The legislative campaign in Virginia this year promises to be unusually interesting. It is not probable that the Republicans will make any fight.

1891-04-05T00:00:00Z,"OTTAWA, Ontario, April 4. -- Contrary to expectation, the negotiations for closer trade relations between Canada and the United States have advanced another stage. Sir John Macdonald in an interview this afternoon expressed himself as confident of the result. The delay of Sir Charles Tupper in starting for Washington, coupled with the apparent apathy of Secretary Blaine, augured unfavorably for the Dominion Government."
1891-04-05T00:00:00Z,"The announcement that Mr. WINDRIM, the Supervising Architect of the Treasury, has resigned his office will not surprise anybody who has paid attention to the conduct of that office.

1891-04-05T00:00:00Z,"SHIRE HORSES. -- The gigantic Shire horse still proves his right to exist, because he possesses the greatest amount of draught power in the smallest compass.

1891-04-05T00:00:00Z,"THE ANSAIREE FAITH. -- One of the most curious features of the Ansairee faith is their belief in a Trinity: Ali, the Father; Mohammed, the Son, and Salman el Farsi, the Holy Ghost. Ali, the Father, became man through his veil or representative, Mohammed, and Mohammed appointed Salman to superintend the affairs of this world after his return to his father's kingdom."

The first notice (they generally came at night) would be a loud yell from some of the men."
1891-04-05T00:00:00Z,"BALTIMORE, Md., April 4. -- Despite the accessories in the way of balls and other smaller entertainments, Easter week has, contrary to expectation, not been brilliant. That it should have been even dull after so long a period of quiet would not have been strange had it not been for the special preparations made by society to insure a bright opening of the Spring."

By this victory the insurgents became masters of the Province of Antofagasta."
1891-04-05T00:00:00Z,"Good new plays come so rarely into the reviewer's vision that it would be ungrateful, indeed, to complain when an unusual number of them come together. Four worthy plays divided the professional theatregoer's attention in Easter week, and three of them were new. The result is just a trifle bewildering. The mind laboriously trained to take quick impressions gets to be like the sensitive film of the camera."
1891-04-05T00:00:00Z,"WASHINGTON, April 4. -- Again it was announced this morning that the State Department would have nothing to make public to-day respecting the Italian correspondence. The excitement in departmental circles over Baron Fava's recall has subsided, and the incident will, it is believed, take its place in the ordinary calendar of open diplomatic matters whose disposition is usually characterized by deliberation and patient investigation."
1891-04-05T00:00:00Z,"The success of the tunnel out of Libby caused the Confederates to redouble their vigilance. They placed guards in the cookroom after dark, a guard was kept down in the hospital, and every hour after 9 o'clock a Sergeant and four guards, all carrying lanterns, made a tour of all the rooms in the prison. The latter precaution was not only unnecessary, but it disturbed the prisoners greatly."
1891-04-05T00:00:00Z,"Few Irishmen eminent in our time have had more romantic histories than John Boyle O'Reilly, but it is the peculiar distinction of O'Reilly that to romantic adventure his life adds the element of much personal worth.

1891-04-05T00:00:00Z,"ORANGE, N.J., April 4. -- Lent over, Orange society has aroused and the gay whirl of enjoyment has begun. There have been no very large gatherings this week, and the tendency is to small parties."

1891-04-05T00:00:00Z,"The piano manufacturers who assembled in this city a few days ago deserve the gratitude of all musicians, vocal and instrumental, for taking up the troubled question of pitch.

They were Donnelly and Miller's farcical nautical opera ""Ship Ahoy!"" and Hamilton Aide's farce-comedy, ""Dr. Bill."" ""Ship Ahoy!"" has done a week of excellent business and will undoubtedly continue to draw large houses during the final week of its engagement, which begins to-morrow night """
1891-04-05T00:00:00Z,"LENOX, April 4. -- The Lenox cottagers are making preparations for the coming season much earlier than usual. Many of the cottagers come up from New-York and occupy their places in May, because May and June are quite as charming months as September and October among the Berkshire Hills. Several of the cottagers have been here the last week looking over their places and arranging for repairs and improvements."
1891-04-05T00:00:00Z,"CHAMPAGNE. -- There are two peculiarities about champagne drinking which are capable of explanation. The one is the rapidity with which the wine exhilarates, notwithstanding the small proportion of alcohol it contains. This is due to the carbonic acid gas evolved, which is inhaled while drinking, for it is the property of this gas to expedite the action of anything with which it is associated."
1891-04-05T00:00:00Z,"Instead of turning over to his employer, James F. Angel, a jeweler at 176 Broadway, the money he collected, Julius Harris forged Angel's name to a check for $25, which he got from Emanuel Strausky of 41 Clinton Street, and after cashing it kept the cash.

1891-04-05T00:00:00Z,"While the behavior of the guards on the bridge platforms and in the cars has on the whole improved within the past year, it is by no means nearly perfect, and there is one branch of their duties that still meets with absolute indifference -- the exclusion of drunken persons from the bridge cars at night."

This way of doing business is recognized as wholly in Mr. Gould's line."
1891-04-05T00:00:00Z,"LONDON, April 4. -- To-morrow may turn out to be an important date in European history. The term of five years for which the Prince of Bulgaria was by the Sultan's firman also constituted Governor General of Eastern Roumelia expires on April 5. No doubt whatever exists of Turkey's willingness or present intention to renew the appointment and thus formally recognize the fact that the two Bulgarias have practically become one."
1891-04-05T00:00:00Z,Two volumes of absorbing interest are these which Samuel Smiles has devoted to the correspondence and business career of that John Murray whose name is forever linked with the name of Byron.

1891-04-05T00:00:00Z,"WATERBURY, Conn., April 4. -- The failure of the Connecticut General Assembly to enact any legislation has engendered considerable disgust among the farmers of the State.

Hill has already started next Fall's campaign, and in every county in the State where he can establish sinews of war the work is going on. It is not to be denied that the six years' experience he has acquired in the Executive Chamber is now being utilized by him in every direction possible."
1891-04-06T00:00:00Z,"Some light is thrown on the preferences of the Democratic Party in South Carolina by our dispatch from Charleston this morning. It is clear enough that there is no ""boom,"" nor the material even for the smallest kind of one, for HILL in that State.

1891-04-06T00:00:00Z,"The biography of Arthur Macmurrough Kavanagh well deserved to be written. Mr. Kavanagh, in a peculiar and striking way, was an eminent man of his time. He accomplished a total of life work which only a rare and gifted spirit could have accomplished. It mattered not that to the great world he was little known."

1891-04-06T00:00:00Z,"WASHINGTON, April 5. -- It was only a very short time ago that Mr. Blaine's reciprocity bureau in this city was sending out figures about Brazilian trade for the year 1888, evidently for the purpose of announcing later on what can easily be discovered now, and that could have been discovered a year ago, that the trade of 1889 was greater than that of 1888."

There is no doubt that during the last three years systematic efforts have been made in this State to work up a Hill boom, but they have received little or no encouragement."
1891-04-06T00:00:00Z,"The jury of selection has done a good thing in forcing down the limit of accepted works to half a thousand.

1891-04-06T00:00:00Z,"Our controversy with Italy in regard to the punishment of the New-Orleans rioters reveals a defect in our laws, not now for the first time revealed, but to which too little attention has been given.

The Republicans some time ago, in a spasm of virtue, and at the dictation of Joseph B. McCullagh, editor of the Globe-Democrat, undertook the task of self-reformation.

Hill's proposition to adjourn on April 24, the Senate promises to witness a scene to be remembered.

1891-04-13T00:00:00Z,"PITTSBURG, Penn., April 12. -- When Nelson P. Reed died a few days ago, United States Senator Quay lost his good right hand. The death of Mr. Reed is indeed likely to change the whole face of Republican politics in Western Pennsylvania, if not in the State at large."
1891-04-13T00:00:00Z,"Statesmen, philosophers, and moralists will be profoundly interested in the provisions of the Substitute Excise bill reported from Mr. EARL'S Assembly committee last Wednesday and ordered to a third reading on Thursday. The ""demands"" of any class or group in the community are always interesting when frankly, fully, and carefully formulated, and this measure, though not abounding in frankness, seems to be a full and painstaking exposition of the present needs of the liquor sellers."
1891-04-13T00:00:00Z,"YOKOHAMA, Japan, March 21. -- The Omaha sailed from Yokohama March 9 for Panama.

1891-04-13T00:00:00Z,"Senator SAXTON has made a curious and inexplicable compromise between his personal convictions and the exigencies of his legislative situation. Speaking of the Ballot act amendments, he says: ""I am decidedly in favor of adjusting the question of independent nominations so that they may be made as easily as possible."

1891-04-13T00:00:00Z,"Our Republican contemporaries continue to find glaring defects in PORTER'S so-called census.

The Last Bank of England returns of diminished reserve, combined with the effinx of bullion abroad, renders an early advance of the bank rate exceedingly probable. Discount hardened during the week and was quoted at 2 1/2 for three months and 2 for short."
1891-04-13T00:00:00Z,"PITTSBURG, April 12. -- Mr. Andrew Carnegie is here on business connected with the Pittsburg Free Library Building, for which he will donate $2,000,000.

1891-04-19T00:00:00Z,"Chicago, April 18. -- The Provisions market was a dull affair to day. Shorts were particularly encouraged because, apparently, there was no inclination to sympathize with Wheat. For some reason or other the pit became imbued with the idea that during the week the Cudahy Packing Company had been a very heavy seller. That encouraged some selling of the scalping sort. Prices, until within fifteens minutes of the close, were inclined down."
1891-04-19T00:00:00Z,"TRENTON, N.J., April 18. -- The local election for Mayor in this city last Tuesday has much much more significance than has been given it. The Republican Mayor, Anthony A. Skerin, who was renominated, was beaten by over 1,000 majority by Charles J. Bechtel, his Democratic opponent. The majority was overwhelming, and it had nothing to do with the personal popularity or record of the Republican candidate."
1891-04-19T00:00:00Z,"Peter De Lacy, gambler and poolseller is a man of his word. He is an outlaw who is to be respected. He is not a liar. He has said that the police force of New-York City could not and would not suppress him, whatever they might do with other poolsellers."
1891-04-19T00:00:00Z,"The children's carnival, yesterday afternoon, at the Lenox Lyceum, Madison Avenue and Fifty-ninth Street, for the benefit of the Babies' Hospital, was a pronounced success. The plans, which the Directors of the hospital have been weeks in preparing, were fully carried out. About $2,500 was cleared. The performance of the little dancers was faultless. An orchestra of twenty-five pieces was on the platform hidden behind a profusion of palms."
1891-04-19T00:00:00Z,The steamer Eider of the North German Lloyd Line was the scene of a double tragedy just before she left her dock in Hoboken yesterday afternoon for Europe. Early in the afternoon an excited interchange of words between a German man and woman had attracted the notice of the dock employes. The man was of middle age and poorly dressed.
1891-04-19T00:00:00Z,"Lanin, whose attacks on the Russian Government are increasing, takes up in a recent number of the Fortnightly Review the subject of ""Russian Finance and the Racking of the Peasantry."" It may be remembered that the late money crisis was due to a large balance held for the Russian Government, which was withdrawn from the Barings, and nobody is disposed to find any-fault with this action on the part of the Russian Minister of Finance."
1891-04-19T00:00:00Z,"The conviction of the manager of a poolroom in this city affords a hopeful indication that one of the worst forms of gambling, which has hitherto battled the authorities, may yet be suppressed. The selling of pools and registering of bets on horse races at the race tracks have been legalized by the New-York Legislature, but this was not intended to interfere with the prohibition of those practices at gambling places elsewhere."
1891-04-19T00:00:00Z,"People who fought the so-called ""Freedom of Worship bill"" in the Legislature of 1885 and since will be amazed to learn that it is pending in the Senate again. It passed the Assembly by resort to a piece of legislative trickery which gave the opponents of the bill no opportunity to be heard upon it. It was sprung as a substitute on the order of third reading and passed without having previously been heard of."
1891-04-19T00:00:00Z,"MIDDLETOWN, Conn., April 18. -- The Rev. George A. Hall, State Security of the New-York Young Men's Christian Association, addressed the association here on Monday evening."
1891-04-19T00:00:00Z,"This will be the last week of the engagement of Mr. and Mrs. Kendal at Palmer's Theatre. It will be devoted principally to ""The Ironmaster,"" but on Thursday and Friday nights ""The Money Spinner,"" a play by Arthur W. Pinero, which they produced in London nine or ten years ago, and which was thereafter done here at Wallack's, when Rose Coghlan and Osmond Tearle were in the company, will be given with ""My Uncle's Will."""
1891-04-19T00:00:00Z,"A picked nine of New-York League and local players met the Manhattan Athletic Club's nine on the Polo Grounds yesterday. The picked team played a remarkably clover fielding game, and won easily. Rusie pitched part of the game, and then exchanged place with Short-Stop Hayes. The Manhattans played fairly well, but failed to bat when hits were needed. Score:"
1891-04-19T00:00:00Z,"The satisfaction felt by all who are interested in the reform of the civil service at the advances that have been made by the Administration within the past week is entirely justified. The laborers in the navy yards and the employes in the Indian schools, together with the physicians of the Indian service, have been brought practically under the operation of the principle of the civil service law of 1883."
1891-04-19T00:00:00Z,"The Massachusetts Legislature's Committee on Public Health has been induced by the testimony recently taken concerning the use of arsenic in the manufacture of household goods to report a bill, and while this bill is not a copy of the one suggested by the 1,300 petitioning physicians it contains some of the provisions of that measure and shows that the committee was impressed by the very interesting evidence which the petitioners submitted."

1891-04-19T00:00:00Z,"PHILADELPHIA, April 18. -- Provost Pepper led a party of public-spirited Philadelphians to Harrisburg last Thursday to urge the passage of a bill abolishing the Sectional School Boards. This city's public-school system is burdened with Ward Directors elected by the people, who are, in the majority of cases, simply politicians, and yet control a vital portion of school management -- the election of teachers."
1891-04-19T00:00:00Z,"The tendency in modern times to the concentration of population is nowhere more marked than in the United States. Perhaps it is nowhere else quite so marked. Everybody has observed the tendency, but probably the statistics of the census will surprise even those who have given to the subject the greatest attention."
1891-04-19T00:00:00Z,"CLEVELAND, Ohio, April 18. -- A frightful wreck occurred on the Lake Shore Railroad at Kipton Station, about forty miles west of Cleveland, early this evening, in which six postal clerks and two engineers were killed. The fast mail No. 14, bound east, collided with No. 21, the Toledo express, just as the latter train was about to pull on the siding to let the fast mail pass."
1891-04-19T00:00:00Z,"While at parades the Police Captains appear to be proud of their spick and span uniform set off with brass buttons and gold lace, it is a curious fact that in ordinary circumstances they seem to be unhappy when they are compelled to appear in them in public. Various reasons may be assigned for this repugnance to wearing the livery of the force."
1891-04-19T00:00:00Z,"The concert of the Manuscript Society on Wednesday night furnished food for reflection on several points. The length of the programme, for instance, was a subject for discussion. Its performance occupied less than two hours and a half, yet it had the effect on the hearer of three hours of strained attention. The cause of this was simple and by no means difficult to understand."
1891-04-19T00:00:00Z,"These are haleyon days for the dressmaker, but the milliners are not ""in it."" For the former the sun of prosperity shines with hourly increasing fervor. The fin de siecle styles admit of no successful competition by amateurs. Never did the home dressmaker labor against heavier odds. The complicated preparation of the present gown, together with its simplicity of effect, defeats her."
1891-04-19T00:00:00Z,"PHILADELPHIA, Apri1 18. -- Ex-Congressman William L. Scott of Erie, who is recognized throughout the country as one of the most intimate personal and political friends of ex-President Cleveland, has lately been in consultation with leading members of his party throughout the State with a view to securing a united delegation from Pennsylvania to the Democratic National Convention in favor of Mr. Cleveland's nomination for President in 1892."

Wyse, who has been negotiating with the Colombian Government to prolong the concession. The report was apparently prepared with the object of concealing, amid an endless maze of words and reiterated expressions about sanguine prospects, the actual hopelessness of any further enterprise in that direction."
1891-04-20T00:00:00Z,"In the thinly-populated and desolate region from Ninety-third to Ninety-ninth Street and from Lexington to Fifth Avenue known as ""The Devil's Hole,"" a very mysterious murder took place late Saturday night. Thus far it has baffled the energies of the authorities of that precinct -- the Twenty-seventh-although Capt. Carpenter, Detectives Doyle and Krulisch, and a squad of policemen have scoured the neighborhood for a trace of the murderer or his object."
1891-04-20T00:00:00Z,"ALBANY, April 19. -- A unique certificate of incorporation was filed with the Secretary of State recently. It is that of the Loyal Lancers, whose headquarters are in Holland, Erie County. The objects are set forth in this fashion:"

O'Connor of the Oak Street Station was asked yesterday afternoon how it was that ""Pete"" De Lacy was allowed to go right on selling pools at the old stand at 33 Park Row, he graphically said ""it wasn't"" and went on to explain that he knew positively that neither De Lacy nor any other poolseller in the precinct had taken a bet since the morning of the Fisher decision."
1891-04-20T00:00:00Z,"ALBANY, April 19. -- With its machinery running night and day of late, the Assembly has succeeded in grinding a big grist of bills.

1891-04-20T00:00:00Z,"Like the Scotch covenanters, the Rev. R. HEBER NEWTON appeals to GOD and the Word against those who accuse him of uncanonical practices. Church creeds and church organization he subordinates to the supreme necessity of teaching what Christ taught, and as He taught it. The creeds, he said to those who heard his sermon at All Souls' yesterday, ""are not divine revelations, let down out of the skies."

1891-04-20T00:00:00Z,"Readers of London Figaro may have noticed recently that the brightest pages were contributed by some one who posed as a young woman from America who had come alone and independent to that city and was getting any amount of fun out of the queer ways, the cleverness, the dullness, and the odd speech of London people."

The road from this place passes through a part of North and South Carolina and Georgia to Tennessee, and the route is through several thriving towns and villages which are centres of a thrifty population. The region has been noted as the strongest outpost of Republicanism in the South."
1891-04-20T00:00:00Z,"The Rev. R. Heber Newton had a very large congregation at All Souls' Church yesterday morning, a fact partially due to the popular interest in the discussion in which the preacher is involved regarding certain differences between his own views and certain tenets of the Protestant Episcopal Church. It was expected that he would explain his position in his sermon."
1891-04-20T00:00:00Z,"There was a case of the dreaded typhus fever among the steerage passengers of the French Line steamship La Bourgogne, which arrived from Havre Saturday night.

A good many are lent for the occasion by owners, many more are portraits which are not for sale, and then the number of pictures is unusually small. Saturday morning found only $7,000 to the credit of sales during eleven days. Buyers seem to rely more than ever on exhibitions and auctions made by individual artists."
1891-04-20T00:00:00Z,"The opponents of McKinleyism could scarcely ask for more effective aid than that which is given to them by the crazy high-tariff politicians in Ohio who control the Wool Growers' Association. They could well afford to pay Judge LAWRENCE a large sum for every letter he writes and publishes, and for every admission and boast that he and his associates were the authors of the tricks and jobs in the wool schedule."
1891-04-20T00:00:00Z,A man who gets into the Railway Mail Service has before him work of a character which he knows or will soon learn means no shirking on his part. He cannot be a railway mail clerk and take life easy.

WYSE has at last submitted to the liquidator of the bankrupt Panama Canal Company a report concerning his negotiations in Colombia for an extension of the original concession.

Take bills of lading and dispossess yourself of the idea that they are mercantile implements, fashioned yesterday, or, say, only a thousand years or so ago.

1891-04-22T00:00:00Z,"It has been the custom of the predecessors of Mayor GRANT for some years to give the Republicans of the city one representative upon the Board of Park Commissioners.

They wanted to perform another operation, but Dr. Bothwell was too weak."
1891-05-01T00:00:00Z,"LONDON, April 30. -- The influenza epidemic is now ravaging East Kent. In addition to the human beings who have been victims to the disease, the epidemic has attacked the horses in the East Kent hunt stables, with the result that several valuable hunters have already died from its effects."

1891-05-01T00:00:00Z,"ALBANY, N.Y., April 30. -- The one hundred and fourteenth session of the Legislature went out of existence like a Summer cloud. The most cordial feeling was displayed in both houses to-day. The Senate dead-lock continued up to half an hour of final adjournment, when the Tax Levy bill was passed and a number of nominations were confirmed."
1891-05-02T00:00:00Z,"When the manufacturers of window glass revived their combination a few days ago and increased prices about 15 per cent., they also paid some attention to questions relating to wages. It appears that the wages of workmen in the Western factories are higher by 10 per cent. than those paid by the manufacturers in the East."
1891-05-02T00:00:00Z,Those who have been trying to believe that Mr. BLAINE would conduct the State Department under the present Administration with dignity and avoid the scandal of making the power of the Government subservient to private interests must be sorely disappointed at the revelations that have been coming to light in the last few days with reference to the negotiations for the protection of seal life in Bering Sea.
1891-05-02T00:00:00Z,"The British naval authorities continue to discuss with great interest our new navy, and in a tone that indicates their keen appreciation of its possibilities. Their chief attention seems to be concentrated on Cruiser No. 12, which, according to the United Service Gazette, ""has been virtually christened by the highly-suggestive name of the Pirate."" The fact is that our statutes will not allow this fast craft to carry that significant appellation."
1891-05-02T00:00:00Z,"The reason assigned for the absence of Edward H. Ammidown from the high-tax dinner at the Madison Square Garden Wednesday night -- that he was called to Europe by the illness of a son -- will need corroborative proof before it will be accepted as true by the law firm of Horwitz Hershfield, who had planned an appointment with Mr. Ammidown in Supreme Court, Chambers, before Judge O'Brien Thursday morning."

1891-05-02T00:00:00Z,"ALBANY, May 1. -- The record of the Democratic Assembly from the Hill standpoint was issued to-day from the Executive Chamber. It goes to the people over the signatures of the men appointed yesterday by the Democratic caucus, but it was prepared under the Governor's supervision and bears his earmarks throughout."
1891-05-02T00:00:00Z,"TROY, May 1. -- A remarkable scene was witnessed in the County Clerk's office to-day. County Judge Griffith, Sheriff Tappen, and Clerk Conway were about to draw the Grand and trial jurors for the May Circuit and Oyer and Terminer. District Attorney Kelly sat at a table without the inclosure apparently engrossed in a newspaper. Near him was ex-Supervisor Moore. Ex-County Clerk Greenman was also present."

Graff, and who was committed to Moyamensing on the charge of attempting to obtain money on false pretenses from Mme. Marguerite S.

1891-05-02T00:00:00Z,"Gov. HILL sees fit to make a public statement of his reasons for not convening the Legislature in extraordinary session. The sum and substance of them is that there is no assurance that the Senate would pass certain bills which were passed by the Assembly at the regular session and some of which, it is to be inferred, would be recommended for consideration."
1891-05-02T00:00:00Z,"WASHINGTON, May 1. -- Secretary of the Treasury Foster issued to-day the statement of the public debt on April 30, and it comes forth in the same shape in which it has appeared since it was remodeled by Secretary Windom, who slightly changed the form adhered to by his predecessor after it had been reconstructed by Secretary Manning."

That portion of the general law which makes this rate of $1.25 the maximum rate for Brooklyn reads as follows:"
1891-05-02T00:00:00Z,"ROME, May 1. -- King Humbert this morning drove through the quarters-inhabited by the working men and women.

1891-05-02T00:00:00Z,"ALBANY, N.Y., May 1. -- The general corporation laws, prepared by the Commissioners of Statutory Revision, which were placed upon the statute books last year, went into effect to-day. These laws are a codification and revision of all corporation laws and amendments thereto passed since 1848. The amendments to these laws, which were smothered in the Senate on account of the dead-lock, were regarded by some as absolutely necessary to make these laws perfect."
1891-05-02T00:00:00Z,"CLEVELAND, Ohio, May 1. -- Nine thousand five hundred people saw the opening game between Cleveland and Cincinnati. The contest was too one-sided to be interesting. Both Duryea and Rhines were batted hard, the latter going into the game at the end of the fourth inning. Latham's double play unassisted and his home run were the features of the contest. Score:"
1891-05-02T00:00:00Z,"CHICAGO, May 1. -- Brokers on the Board of Trade expect to see the elongated form of Hutchinson loom up in the grain pit of the board to-morrow.

Thursday, where he had been taken on a writ of habeas corpus, has not yet been found. Ambrose H. Purdy, Zuccavello's counsel, and Mr. Benedict, representing Col. Weber, Superintendent of Immigration, differed as to which of them ought to be held responsible for getting Zuccavello into court again."
1891-05-02T00:00:00Z,It is stated in dispatches from Halifax that steamship agents and immigration officers at that port have very little to say as to the assertion that large numbers of immigrants intending to enter the United States are landed at that port in order that they may avoid the inspection provided for those who arrive at our own ports.
1891-05-02T00:00:00Z,"PHILADELPHIA, May 1. -- Five pitchers took part in to-day's game, and the New-Yorks won after an interesting struggle. Clarke was injured in the opening inning, and O'Rourke was called in to catch. He couldn't hold Rusie's fast delivery, and Welch was put in. Later on Welch couldn't check astreak of heavy batting indulged in by the home players, and Mt. Staten Island Sharrott relieved him."

One of the results of this movement was the formation of the Wool Consumers' Association, which vigorously opposes McKinleyism in the wool schedule."
1891-05-02T00:00:00Z,"WASHINGTON, May 1. -- Polish, as well as bravery, seems to be demanded in officers of the army, if they expect to he treated with graceful consideration. In the recent Indian campaign the Ninth Cavalry, composed of black troopers, distinguished itself so highly that the Secretary of War determined that there should be recognition of the services of the men."

1891-05-02T00:00:00Z,"WASHINGTON, May 1. -- A report that cannot be verified finds its way about Washington that Mr. Blaine will agree to the last proposition of the British Government, by which Lord Salisbury stipulates that no British poachers shall enter Bering Sea if the United States will see to it that no American poachers and no killing on the seal islands shall be allowed for a term of years decided to be necessary."
1891-05-02T00:00:00Z,"The neglect with which exhibitors at the Academy of Design have treated the Hallgarter prizes, never troubling themselves so much as to come and ballot for winners, has filled the cup of grievance for the more progressive artists to overflowing. There was a very brisk meeting on Thursday night in which artists expressed themselves with the vigor acquired by years of holding forth in ateliers."
1891-05-03T00:00:00Z,"BALTIMORE, May 2. -- The sale of tickets for the amateur performance of ""The Pirates of Penzance"" has been successful beyond all expectation. On Monday the box office opened, and before the middle of the week not only was every seat disposed of, but it was found there had been such an oversale of tickets that the theatre could not possibly accommodate their holders even with standing room."
1891-05-03T00:00:00Z,"BOSTON, May 2. -- The Hon. E.M. McPherson, the Commissioner of Foreign Corporations, has been looking up the record of the Eastern Investment Company and as a result of his investigations has ordered the concern immediately to cease doing business in Massachusetts. The rise and progress of the institution, as shown by official documents, are full of interest."
1891-05-03T00:00:00Z,"WASHINGTON, May 2. -- Stories about counterfeit money find ready market, and Washington has been the place of origin for many years of many stories of this kind that have greatly misinformed and perhaps unnecessarily alarmed the newspaper readers of the land. Writers who have imperfectly understood the accounts given to them in the Secret Service Bureau have at times been responsible for stories of this kind."
1891-05-03T00:00:00Z,"AMHERST, Mass., May 2. -- The official Commencement Day programme is as follows: Entrance examinations at Walker Hall, 9 A.M. June 18 and 19.

1891-05-03T00:00:00Z,"The failure of the Governor to call an extra session of the Legislature will be a serious misfortune for this city in one respect. It leaves the people practically without hope of improvement in street cleaning, as there is no authority for the expenditure required for the adoption of the new system recommended by the Mayor's Advisory Committee."
1891-05-03T00:00:00Z,Mayor Grant made these appointments yesterday afternoon:
1891-05-03T00:00:00Z,THE GREAT FIND IN EGYPT. -- On Feb. 6 a discovery was made in the necropolis of Thebes second only in importance to the discovery of the royal mummies at Dehrel-Bahari by M.

1891-05-03T00:00:00Z,"IN THE TIME OF THE RENAISSANCE. -- The highest office in the household of a great Italian personage in the sixteenth century was, however, that of the ""Scalco."" He was not, Frugoli tells us in his ""Escalcaria,"" or treatise on the subject, the Spanish ""Mastro Sala,"" or the French ""Mestre d'Utel,"" although he combined their special duties with his own."
1891-05-03T00:00:00Z,"A special drawing-room car attached to the 10 o'clock express on the New-Haven line yesterday morning contained a select band of professional men animated by one purpose, that of learning how to arrange a collection of casts in the best and most economical way, so that the public and students of the fine arts may get from examples of old sculpture the greatest amount of good."
1891-05-03T00:00:00Z,"Daniel Draper, Director of the New-York Meteorological Observatory in Central Park, is making an exhaustive study of the question: ""Do the grip and the pneumonia which develops from it depend upon the direction of the wind?""

1891-05-03T00:00:00Z,"LONDON, Ky., May 2. -- The present session of Judge Lilly's Circuit Court at Manchester in Clay County presents a most appalling state of affairs, there being no less than twelve men held in custody on the charge of murder. John and Andrew Wilson are held for the murder of T.G. Baker. At the present term, they both were given a new trial that resulted in each case in a hung jury."
1891-05-03T00:00:00Z,"WASHINGTON, May 2. -- The United Stats Treasurer now holds in United States bonds to secure national bank circulation $140,924,000, as follows: Currency 6s, $7,655,000; 4 1/2 per cents, $23,268,450; 4 per cents, $110,001,450."

It was the oldest building on the street, over 120 years old. It was purchased by Paul Morphy's father, Judge Alonzo Morphy of the Supreme Court, just fifty years ago for $90,000."
1891-05-03T00:00:00Z,"THE GERMAN LABOR INSURANCE. -- There are several reasons which militate against insurance for pensions by our wage earners. One is want of adequate security. No workingman can be sure that a society into which he enters at twenty-one will be able to fulfill its obligations forty-four years later, when he becomes a claimant for a pension. Nothing but a national guarantee can give such security."
1891-05-03T00:00:00Z,"WILLIAMSTOWN, Mass., May 2. -- The Junior Division of the Journal Club has elected the following officers: President -- J.H. Brinkerhoff; Vice President -- F.H. Booth; Secretary -- F.W. Hicks; Executive Committee -- President Brinkerhoff, Dr. S.F. Clarke, and H.A. Turner."

Thatcher Graves with the mailing of the package of poisoned liquid from Boston to Mrs. Barnaby at Denver. The story had but one fault; it was untrue."
1891-05-03T00:00:00Z,"The opening of the new Salon at Paris to objects of industrial art is only one indication of a tendency in France, England and Germany which the United States must weigh. In these lands that time has long gone by when the public classed easel paintings and sculptures only among the fine arts. France has at Paris her Musee des Arts Decoratifs, with affiliated museums in the larger cities of the republic."
1891-05-03T00:00:00Z,"Some young men from Philadelphia last evening gave New-York an idea of the possibilities of the amateur stage, when the Mask and Wig Club of the University of Pennsylvania presented what they discreetly called ""The Musico-Dramatic Offense, 'Miss Columbia,'"" at the Academy of Music. There were less than seventy-five of them, but the enthusiasm they aroused may possibly unduly exalt the city of Brotherly Love in its own estimation to a dangerous degree."
1891-05-03T00:00:00Z,"YOKOHAMA, Japan, April 4. -- In the Saga Prefecture on the 11th of March a reinterment of a person buried in 1878 took place. In opening the grave it was found that about one-half of the coffin had decayed from immersion in water that had drained into it. A part of the body thus exposed looked curiously white and undecayed and felt us hard as stone."
1891-05-03T00:00:00Z,"The recent friction between Portugal and England relating to the stopping of supplies passing up the Pungwe River by the Portuguese authorities brings into notice the advance made by English settlers into Mashonaland. Mashonaland offers certain inducements other than agricultural or trading in rum with the natives, for gold is found there in quantity."
1891-05-03T00:00:00Z,"LONDON, May 2. -- All at once May Day has become a sinister date in the European calendar. Future historians, writing at a distance from which all the amazing bustle and cross marching of the great forces of our time may be studied in a proper perspective, will be much puzzled, I fancy, at the transformation which this opening day of May underwent during the present generation."
1891-05-03T00:00:00Z,"WASHINGTON, May 2. -- The following statement, prepared at the Treasury Department by Mr. Whelpley, the Assistant Treasurer of the United States, shows the percentage of assets the Treasury holds against demand liabilities, exclusive of the amount known as ""trust funds,"" for which the full amount is held:"

Rabusson, in this romance, rather strains the maxim, ""Noblesse oblige."" He places too high a figure on rank if his Prince Paul de Duhn is the type. Mlle. Luce de la Blanchaye was the daughter of a country noble, and the de la Blanchayes were ruined."
1891-05-03T00:00:00Z,"Last week the sulkies took their first spin in pursuit of the elusive dollar with two brief programmes in the south, one at Savannah, Ga., and the other at Albuquerque, New-Mexico. Neither is of any special import except as the starting signal for the great annual trotting tournament that has come to outstrip in point of extent and general interest all other American sports."
1891-05-03T00:00:00Z,"Gold shipments have again given Wall Street a chill. Something over $3,000,000 went out the past week, and one might suppose that a direful calamity had happened to the country. If money goes west in response to the demands of trade, or if it goes east, the only question of speculative interest at this centre is how far the movement has or will affect interest rates."
1891-05-03T00:00:00Z,"Our London correspondent, in his cabled letter, makes a very striking point upon troubles created on May Day by the demands, or the apprehended demands, of Labor. This is that Germany alone was exempt on Friday from the disturbances that were felt everywhere else on the Continent of Europe."
1891-05-03T00:00:00Z,"The victim who has ""been there"" will look with suspicion upon the words ""Teeth extracted without pain,"" and yet, if authoritative reports are of value, the day of painless extractions is at hand. Medical electricity has come to be an established fact, and it is to a party of enthusiasts in this branch of science that the owners of cuspids and molars for generations to come will owe their relief."
1891-05-03T00:00:00Z,"THE SPARROW. -- For the common house sparrow, as distinguished from the so-called hedge sparrow and the tree sparrow, nothing can be urged in its favor. Destroy them utterly, is my advice; and I have reason to think that Miss Ormerod has come to the same conclusion. Experience has shown that their ill-advised importation into Australia and North America has wrought incalculable harm to cultivated vegetation."
1891-05-03T00:00:00Z,"The opening of the new Music Hall, at Fifty-seventh Street and Seventh Avenue, which is to take place on Tuesday evening, will be an event of considerable importance in the musical annals of New-York. It is, of course, too soon to say whether the new building will prove adequate to the requirements of such an institution, but there is good ground for believing that it will."
1891-05-03T00:00:00Z,"CAMBRIDGE, Mass., May 2. -- Two things distinctly mark the college life at Harvard from that of other institutions, namely, the absence of class feeling and an almost corresponding absence of club rivalry. All the other universities and colleges are deeply influenced by the character and accomplishments of their different societies and owe a large amount of their existence to the advantages of good fellowship almost as much as to their educational standards."
1891-05-03T00:00:00Z,"YOKOHAMA, Japan, April 8. -- On the 3d inst. the Monocacy arrived from Shanghai and the following Monday Admiral Belknap shifted his flag from the Alliance to her. She will probably remain flagship until some larger vessel is sent from home to take her place."
1891-05-03T00:00:00Z,"Newspaper readers will remember that a few years ago there appeared an amateur newspaper at Syracuse whose editorial page was capped with the name of George F. Ives. The paper measured only 4 by 6 inches, and in the descriptions of it that appeared in newspapers that are not amateur there was some account of the lad who had chosen to employ his school vacation in order to try his hand at practical journalism."
1891-05-03T00:00:00Z,"May promises to be an unusually busy month among the amateur photographers. There are many meetings and exhibitions in store for them, while for outdoor work there is no better season of the year. The American Photographic Conference, which is composed of delegates from various amateur societies in the United States, will meet during the latter part of the month, and it is safe to prophesy that delegates will not leave their cameras at home."
1891-05-03T00:00:00Z,"NEW-ORLEANS, May 2. -- Ever since the return of Private Detective D.C. O'Malley from his flight or his enforced seclusion consequent upon the terrible tragedy enacted at the Parish Prison on March 14, the same line of procedure which the defense in the Hennessy case ingeniously pursued from the moment the Chief of Police was assassinated has been followed."
1891-05-03T00:00:00Z,"BOSTON, May 2. -- The so-called reformers of religions have worked their will in Boston this week, under the leadership of the intrepid Mrs. Besant. This apostle of the recondite, by the way, has caused Boston a distinct pang by insisting that her name be not spoken with the broad a, exclusively used by Culture, but must be made rhyme with ""pleasant."""
1891-05-03T00:00:00Z,"Prof. Albert S. Bickmore illustrated his lecture to teachers in the Natural History Museum yesterday with some very attractive and striking pictures of the great rocks of the world as left by nature and as quarried by man. The subject was ""Limestones and Marbles,"" and the lecture was for the most part devoted to interesting descriptions of coral reefs, noted caves of this and other countries, historic buildings made of limestones or marble, and Gibraltar."
1891-05-03T00:00:00Z,"Now that Mother Earth has opened her big parasol of leaves to shield her from a sun whose warmth at last is noticeable, parasols in general begin to be interesting. This year's productions do not show enough new ideas to excite special enthusiasm, but there is steady buying, with which, probably, the merchants are content."
1891-05-03T00:00:00Z,"The big newspaper sign which has been flaunted from the elevated structure in Battery Park has been removed. This completed the technical compliance with the order issued by President Gallup that no advertising devices should be displayed from the elevated structure in Battery Park. It was hardly more than a technical compliance, because the station situated at the edge of the park is still placarded with various advertisements."
1891-05-03T00:00:00Z,"Parables, fables, and short well-known tales probably never took so prominent a place in Europe as they did in the Middle Ages. Christianity was narrow, suspicious of the heathenism that was latent in all lands and jealous of the prestige won by Mohammedanism, not to speak of Judaism and its ancient claims to superiority in learning."
1891-05-03T00:00:00Z,"DUBLIN, May 2. -- William O'Brien, during his leisure moments in Galway Jail, is writing a novel. The scene of the story is laid in the west of Ireland, and the period is the sixteenth century. The heroine is a portrayal of Grace O'Malley."
