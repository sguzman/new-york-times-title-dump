Mr. Edward Robinson has taken the utmost pains with his text."

1896-08-09T00:00:00Z,"Ovid's ""Metamorphoses,"" and in a less degree his ""Fasti,"" are valuable not only as story books and poems, but as documents for the history of ideas. Ovid was a collector of traditions on a vast scale. He had an incomparable knowledge of legends, prejudices, customs, rites, and if he embellished more than the Folklore Society would strictly approve, there is reason to think that he never invented."
1896-08-09T00:00:00Z,"The condition of the market may properly be described as one of slow panic. We must be near the end of it, however. Whether the last blow is to be more severe than any yet experienced, or whether the worst has already been felt, it seems incredible that with the majority of securities there can be further serious decline. The Chicago collapse precipitated the liquidation we have had since Tuesday."

Of course the farmer and manufacturer close to wooded lands will continue the use of wood for fire because it is handy to procure and saves transportation charges."
1896-08-09T00:00:00Z,"NEWPORT, R.I., Aug. 8 -- The thirty-footers had a very long and unsatisfactory race to-day, which the Hera won because she got the only puffs of wind that were astir just after the yachts started. The triangular course of eighteen miles was sailed. It is from Branton's Cove to and around a stake off Jamestown, to and around Bishop's Buoy, back to the start, and over again."
1896-08-09T00:00:00Z,"Greece is, undoubtedly, the most democratic nation in Europe -- perhaps in the world.

Bacon reminds us that ""God Almightie first planted a garden""; and, if it was the duty of our first parents ""to dress that garden and to keep it,"" so, assuredly, has the love of gardening, of flowers, and of herbs occupied a place in the hearts of men, as in their minds, from the beginning of the world."
1896-08-16T00:00:00Z,"The Association for Improving the Condition of the Poor has been an active agent during the dangerous period of hot weather in rendering assistance. The outing parties it gives, three times a week to its homes have been increased from 250, the usual number, to from 500 to 700. The relief thus afforded the poor has been great."

1896-08-16T00:00:00Z,"One of the great drawbacks to a country residence has been the impossibility of properly lighting the house. To the city-bred person the transition from gas or electric light to coal-oil lamps has been dismal in the extreme, and many an otherwise bright evening has been rendered gloomy on account of it."
1896-08-16T00:00:00Z,"WASHINGTON, Aug. 15. -- Baron Fava, the Italian Ambassador, called at the State Department this morning, having come from Bar Harbor for that purpose, and had a long interview with Acting Secretary Rockhill regarding the lynching of the three Italians in Louisiana last Saturday night, which has led to so much excitement in Italy."
1896-08-16T00:00:00Z,"After reading this little book by Mr. Wells one finds himself in doubt about the author's purpose. His biological nightmare may be intended as a sort of allegory, but we hasten to say distinctly, for the author's sake, that if that is the case the allegory is very cleverly veiled, and its meaning is not so plain that the purely imaginative quality of the narrative is thereby injured."
1896-08-16T00:00:00Z,"BAR HARBOR, Aug. 15. -- The rush and excitement at this fashionable resort still continue. The season is fast approaching its height. Many arrivals are expected next week, and by next Saturday night Bar Harbor will be on the crest of the Summer's gayety.

1896-08-16T00:00:00Z,"It has been held by some military writers of experience, says a contributor to The London Telegraph, that the courage of women when exposed to danger is fully equal to that of men, and the career of Mme. Ibrahim, who has just died at Vichy, in her seventy-third year, proves That the Freuch Army is somotimes capable of producing heroines as well as heros."
1896-08-16T00:00:00Z,"LONDON, Aug. 15. -- Li Hung Chang visited Mr. Gladstone to-day at Hawarden Castle, and the two carried on quite a long conversation through the medium of an interpreter. The meeting took place in the drawing-room, in the presence of Mr. Gladstone's family."

He is the successor of the late lamented ""Jerry,"" and is known to his owners as ""Patsey."" In many ways he is a smart mule, but he devotes most of his talents to devising means to avoid the little work that is required of him."
1896-08-16T00:00:00Z,"The history of the janizaries, from their origin, training, and character, is full of exciting adventures. Like the famous band of soldiers formed about the same time of the free mountaineers of Switzerland, this infantry of the East composed of Christian slaves proved invincible wherever their arms were directed."
1896-08-16T00:00:00Z,"Because their candidate makes such mad work with truth, reason, and history it is not to be concluded that all advocates of free silver coinage are incapable of correct statement and right thinking. Here is Senator WILLIAM M. STEWART, for instance, one of the chief men in their leadership, who writes this paragraph in a communication to our neighbor The Journal:"
1896-08-16T00:00:00Z,"The rook's households is awake before sunrise, and the father spends most of the day in searching for food and in journeys to and from the nest. Twice a day, at least, he remains on sentry over the eggs, while the hen goes abroad ""to stretch her legs,"" but I have only once seen him actually sit down upon them, though I notice that Seebohm quotes eye witnesses for the fact that he does go."
1896-08-16T00:00:00Z,"MOUNT POCONO, Penn., Aug. 15. -- Nestling among tall and stately trees, the Pocohasset House enjoys unusual advantages, situated over 2,000 feet above tidewater and at a point on the mountains from which the grandest views can be obtained. During the week it has been comparatively pleasant up here, despite the extremely warm weather."
1896-08-16T00:00:00Z,"LAKE GEORGE, Aug. 15. -- There seems to be more gayety at the Sagamore this Summer than in previous seasons. Crowded in one week were germans, yachting parties, baseball games, tennis tournaments, dove germans, and minstrel entertainments gotten up by young men guests as the hotel. The minstrel performance is said to have been an unqualified success."
1896-08-16T00:00:00Z,"FAR ROCKAWAY, L.I., Aug. 15. -- Almost the sole topic of conversation here during the past week has been the intense heat.

1896-08-16T00:00:00Z,"The business transacted on the floor of ""The Baltic,"" in Threadneedle Street, London, is of a sufficiently varied character. Besides cargoes of grain daily changing hands, a vast quantity of tonnage is annually chartered, and very important transactions in linseed, cottonseed, rapeseed, oils, tallow, , take place. Grain merchants and grain brokers, ship owners and ship brokers, seed merchants and seed brokers, seed crushers and oil refiners, all rub shoulders with one another."
1896-08-16T00:00:00Z,"The question of forgeries which disfigure our national collections cannot pass unnoticed. I do not assert that the South Kensington Museum contains more of them than are to be found in similar institutions on the Continent, though it probably does; for with such exquisite and beautiful skill are these objects nowadays forged or ""faked"" that the most practiced expert may now and again be victimized by them almost without disgrace."
1896-08-16T00:00:00Z,"SARATOGA, Aug. 15. -- This being the first season of Saratoga under the new regime, i. e., without gambling or horse racing, a comparison of the Spa now with its record of past Summers is constantly being made."

Except during the last period of play the match was tame and quite devoid of interest. It was not till this period had been open same time that the Myopias recovered their handicap of six goals and took the lead."

1896-08-16T00:00:00Z,"There have been many persons to wonder that Cornelius Vanderbilt, Jr., and his bride selected Saratoga, a gay and crowded Summer resort, as a place to pass their honeymoon. Their wealth and social prominence and the circumstances surrounding their marriage, of which the world at large was well aware, made privacy a desirable thing."
1896-08-16T00:00:00Z,"A monstrous example of clerical intolerance and tyranny -- if not, indeed, of something worse -- is afforded by the case of Miss Pottle, head mistress of St. Matthew's Church schools, Ponder's End, Middlesex. It is a case, too, which may be usefully borne in mind when the Government makes its next attempt to strengthen the parson's control over the so-called voluntary schools, which are almost entirely carried on at the expense of the State."
1896-08-16T00:00:00Z,"SHELTER ISLAND HEIGHTS, N.Y., Aug. 15. -- The last week has been the gayest and liveliest one of the season, in spite of the heat.

1896-08-16T00:00:00Z,"There must be shown a certain nice discrimination when ""Pill Garlick"" is applied to a man. Usually the commiserating tempering qualifier is used as ""poor Pill Garlick."" The Pil, or Pill, Garlick, is not the French ""sot a triple etage."" We do not feel sorry for a dunderhead, but we must pity a Pill Garlick."
1896-08-16T00:00:00Z,"Li Hung Chang came out of the Taeping campaigns with a high reputation for military skill, great administrative capacity, and devoted loyalty to the reigning dynasty, and was thenceforward the most famous man of his nation.

1896-08-16T00:00:00Z,"WEST POINT, Aug. 15. -- In spite of the almost unendurable heat that for the past week has baked brown the mountain sides, pleasure and gayety has held full sway and no feature has been omitted from the usual amusements which furnish entertainment for the Summer visitor. In camp it was hot and the cadets suffered considerable."
1896-08-16T00:00:00Z,"When Vuillaume came upon the ""Salabue"" Stradivarius he went into raptures over it. Indeed, such was his enthusiasm that he refused to part with the instrument at any price; and when the Franco-German war was going on in 1870 he had the treasure buried in damp-proof, airtight box for safety. Vuillaume went the way of all flesh, and then the violin passed into the hands of M. Alard, who gave 1,000 for it."
1896-08-16T00:00:00Z,"The realm which the award of Edward I. assigned to John de Balliol included Orkney and Caithness, indeed, but they had been so included for less than a century previous. Therefore, while the people of these counties are among the most loyal subjects of Queen Victoria, and as proud as any of their standing as Scotsmen, they do well not to forget that their forefathers were lieges of Thorfinn the Skull-cleaver and Earl Harold."
1896-08-16T00:00:00Z,"The article entitled ""Friends of Kate Field"" in The transcript for Aug. 8, with its sympathetic inclusion of Mr. Laurence Hutton's appreciative words of her from The Bookman, states that I ""have sent for the body of Kate Field to be brought to Mount Auburn."" As I could have no possible authority to do that, your courtesy will, I am sure, permit me one word of explanation."

Rodenbough, Chief of the Election Bureau has issued, under the direction of the Police Board, printed copies of the election law, and also a circular to election officers calling attention to the various changes in the law as enacted by the last Legislature. This is the election calendar for this year:"
1896-08-16T00:00:00Z,"I venture to suggest a final detail of infinite consequence to real happiness in any rearrangement of society in America. Every school, everywhere, should have competent instructors in the use of the voice; every physician should carry in his pocket a prompt and effectual remedy for our National catarrh. There was a time the rustic Yankee dialect afforded the type for ridicule of our new-world snarl in utterance."
1896-08-16T00:00:00Z,The women of Tennessee may justly be proud of the reputation they have gained through their efforts for the success of the Centennial Exposition to be held at Nashville next year. To their enthusiasm and patriotism belongs the credit of giving the first impetus to the movement.
1896-08-16T00:00:00Z,"In art, in literature, the search for violent novelty seems to be tending everywhere toward a return to a sort of rude barbarism. By dint of overrefinement, nothing strikes the exhausted eye but what is rough, or even vulgar. There is a curious instance of this in connection with the latest production of the lively pen of Gyp. ""Ohe les Dirigeants!"""
1896-08-16T00:00:00Z,"GREENVILLE, S.C., Aug. 15. -- There are perhaps more prominent railroad representatives in Greenville to-day than have been congregated in South Carolina in many years."
1896-08-16T00:00:00Z,"The power required to keep a bicycle in motion varies within very wide Units. It depends not only upon the weight of the rider and the speed, but also upon the conditions of the road and the steepness of the grade. The wheel itself runs almost without friction -- that is, if it is a first-class machine, with hardened steel bearings."
1896-08-16T00:00:00Z,"The agitation begun by some of the uptown wheelmen in favor of the construction of a cycle path on the Seventh Avenue Boulevard from Central Park to One Hundred and Fifty-fifth Street, symptomatic and significant as it is respecting the future of roads, will meet with wide approval from those who ride, and seems likely to find favor also among that lesser portion of the community who are not yet interested in the wheel."
1896-08-16T00:00:00Z,"William Jennings Bryan, Populist-Democratic candidate for the Presidency, went into enforced retirement yesterday morning. He would plainly have preferred going on that trip to Boston and Bath, but fate and the campaign leaders would not have it so. Mr. Bryan, therefore, was sent up the Hudson to seclusion and silence."
1896-08-16T00:00:00Z,"Macaulay's theory, that with the advance of civilization poetry must inevitably decline, is not quite true; he should have said that it changes its character, but this is because poetry has life for its subject matter. Art is an expression of something, and the greatest art has always given body and shape to the genius of a particular race at a certain point of its development; to this Shakespeare and Racine are not exceptions."
1896-08-16T00:00:00Z,"ASBURY PARK, Aug. 15. -- Heat of the fiercest kind has sent to this haven of recreation and rest a mighty concourse of sweltering sufferers the past week.

1896-08-16T00:00:00Z,"I observe with mixed feelings that a gentleman of the resonant name of Samuel Chandos Pole was fined 100 last Monday for writing in a visitors' book at Tamworth. This is a good beginning, and the courage of Mr. Justice Wills and a common jury in chastising our national vice, takes an added lustre quia saevit in ipecs Trojugenas."
1896-08-16T00:00:00Z,"LARCHMONT MANOR, N.Y., Aug. 15. -- Nearly all social functions were suspended this week owing to the extreme heat.

1896-08-16T00:00:00Z,"Berlioz did not find that the artistic temperament; even supplemented by strong mutual attraction, was a sufficient bond of sympathy between husband and wife. The story of his mad love for Henrietta Smithson, the Irish actress whom he saw as Ophelia and Desdemona in Paris, has been told by himself with as much accuracy as is possible to an egoist in treating of his own concerns."
1896-08-16T00:00:00Z,The Vencedor of the Lincoln Park Yacht Club and the Canada of the Royal Canadian Yacht Club at Toronto are to meet in a series of races at Toledo next week. These races are to decide the yachting supremacy of the lakes and will be the most important yacht races of the year.

1896-08-16T00:00:00Z,"Slavery is, in truth, a condition so common in the very early stages of social growth, and when it occurs in those stages, is generally so comparatively innoxious that it may almost be regarded as a natural if not quite healthy concomitant of early social development. When the primitive master and his slave live in like huts share like food, and are engaged in like occupations, slavery is slavery in nothing but name."

But for their exceedingly substantial build the Moorish women in the street might pass for ghosts, for their costume is, with this one exception, white. A long and heavy blanket of coarse homespun effectually conceals every feature but the eyes, which are touched up with antimony on the lids, and as a rule are sufficiently expressive."

1897-01-02T00:00:00Z,"Whatever may be the justice or injustice of the rebuke for too free expression of opinion administered by Gov. Moirton to Inspector General McLewee, it has had the effect, for the time being at least, of silencing criticism from National Guard sources. A reporter for THE NEW YORK TIMES yesterday visited five National Guard officers of commanding rank, but none of them would discuss the matter."
1897-01-02T00:00:00Z,Gov. MORTON'S dismissal of his Inspector General a few hours before the terms of both expired was perhaps a natural mode of showing resentment for the indiscreet and irregular conduct of that official. But obviously it was not responsive to the criticisms contained in Gen. McLEWEE'S report.

His friends did their best to get at least the two elder children intrusted to his care."

1897-01-02T00:00:00Z,"Each baby is fed every two hours, and the number of squeals which I heard during the half-day that I spent with Dr. Lion and his rosy children showed me that babies, like bigger mortals, have an unerring idea of dinner hours.
