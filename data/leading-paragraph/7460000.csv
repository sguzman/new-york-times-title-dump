After taking classes at NYU, she worked at the FAO Schwarz toy store, where she once helped sooth an upset young customer - Liza Minelli.

2011-02-02T00:00:00Z,"The head of Gap North Americais leaving the company, one ofa number of changes that Gapannounced for its flagship brandafter years of declining sales atthe division.''Unless we put cute clothes infront of our customer on theshelf,'' said Art Peck, who willsucceed Marka Hansen as presidentof Gap North America, ''everythingelse we do isn't going tomatter.''Ms. Hansen, who has been atGap Inc. for 24 years, has run theGap North America divisionsince 2007. Though she had somenotable hits, like the revision ofthe denim line and the redesignof Gap's basic black pants, saleshave continued to drop.Mr. Peck, who has run the outletbusiness at Gap Inc. until now,will take over immediately. Thebrand will also create a new designhub, called the Global CreativeCenter, based in New York,which will combine design, productionand marketing under oneroof for the first time. Pam Wallack,currently the president ofGap Adult North America, willbecome the head of that unit.And the Gap stores will have anew ad agency, Ogilvy & MatherWorldwide, along with tapping anOgilvy executive, Seth Farbman,to become the new global chiefmarketing officer.The company had a marketingsnafu in the fall when it introduceda new Gap logo, designedin part by its former agency,Laird & Partners. The classiclogo, with a navy backgroundand tall, thin letters, was replacedby a white background with atiny blue square and a thick sansseriffont. Consumers objected tothe new logo on social networkingsites, and within days, Gapwent back to the original.''I expect more from our Gapbusiness in North America,''Glenn K. Murphy, chief executiveof Gap Inc., said in a statement.Analysts said a change at thedivision was due.''It has struggled over the past10 years,'' said Paul Lejuez, an analystwith Nomura Securities.Gap North America has notposted an annual increase insales at stores open at least ayear since 2004. In the first 11months of the 2010 fiscal year,even as retail in general bouncedback, sales at Gap North Americawere down 1 percent.And overall sales at the divisionhave decreased every yearfor the last five years. In 2009,sales were $3.82 billion, down almostone-third from where theywere in 2004.''They've closed a ton of storesover the past several years, butthey've not seen a boost in compsas a result -- you would thinkthat some sales would transfer toother existing Gap stores, butthat's not happening, and thattells you something,'' Mr. Lejuezsaid.The problem, analysts said, isthat people don't want the clothingthat Gap is selling.''They stand for these keyitems that are fairly basic in nature,and quite frankly, it's toughto keep recreating what are somefairly fundamental items insomebody's closet,'' said AdrienneTennant, an analyst withJanney Capital Markets. ''Ajean's a jean.''John D. Morris, an analyst atBMO Capital Markets, noted thatthe spring clothing did not lookmuch more promising.The spring merchandise is''uncompelling and not resonatingwith the brand's target market,''he said in a note to clients.Also, ''the company brought intoo much spring too early,'' leadingto markdowns even on newarrivals."

2011-02-02T00:00:00Z,"Bowing to the inevitable, Senator Daniel K. Inouye, the chairman of the Senate Appropriations Committee, announced Tuesday that the panel would not allow pet spending projects known as earmarks to be included in this year's appropriations bills. Mr. Inouye, the nine-term Hawaii Democrat and an expert at steering money to his island state, conceded he did not have much choice since the Republican majority in the House had instituted its own ban and President Obama had also said he would veto any spending measure that contained earmarks. ''The handwriting is clearly on the wall,'' Mr. Inouye said. ''The president has stated unequivocally that he will veto any legislation containing earmarks, and the House will not pass any bills that contain them. Given the reality before us, it makes no sense to accept earmark requests that have no chance of being enacted into law.'' The decision clearly pained the chairman and he suggested he would resurrect the issue for another look once lawmakers of both parties became tired of not having the ability to direct spending to popular projects in their districts and states. ''Next year, when the consequences of this decision are fully understood by the members of this body, we will most certainly revisit this issue and explore ways to improve the earmarking process,'' Mr. Inouye said. The decision eliminates one complication from this year's difficult spending debates, but the Democrat-controlled Senate and Republican-run House have different ideas on where Congress should end up on spending both in terms of the total amount and the priorities. Congressional earmarks have been the subject of a long struggle between senior lawmakers who favor them and other lawmakers and watchdog groups who argue that they increase federal spending and breed corruption. The impact on the federal deficit is negligible, but winning a total ban on such spending is an important symbolic victory for earmark opponents. ''A one-two punch from Congressional Republicans and the president has brought an end to earmarks - at least temporarily,'' said Ryan Alexander, the president of Taxpayers for Common Sense. ''No more political muscle trumping project merit. This should usher in a new era for accountability and oversight on federal spending, not just in earmarked accounts, but budget-wide.'' Lawmakers are always searching for ways around such restrictions and will no doubt still try to influence spending decisions outside the formal definition of earmarks."

''I'm in J. Crew'' is.) Since Latitude works with Google Maps and Android, it is constantly aware of your location (if you want it to be). That leads to the other enhancements: notification and automatic check-in and checkout. When you arrive somewhere, Latitude can prompt you to check in, in case you have forgotten to do so already. You can also set Latitude up to automatically check yourself in to frequently visited places, like your office. Latitude will also automatically check you out when you leave a location."

Mr. Allen's latest film, ''Midnight in Paris,'' will open the Cannes Film Festival on May 11, the event's organizers said on Wednesday. The film, the 41st feature-length work that Mr. Allen has directed, is a romantic comedy whose cast includes Owen Wilson, Rachel McAdams, Marion Cotillard, Kathy Bates and Adrien Brody, though one cast member, Carla Bruni-Sarkozy, has received a bit more attention than the others. In a statement, Thierry Fremaux, the director of the Cannes festival, described ''Midnight in Paris'' as ''a wonderful love letter to Paris,'' adding: ''It's a film in which Woody Allen takes a deeper look at the issues raised in his last films: our relationship with history, art, pleasure and life.'' The film will be released in France on the same day it makes its debut at Cannes, though an American release date has not yet been announced. The full Cannes Film Festival runs through May 22. This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print."

Stein, a Carter adviser who resigned from the Carter Center after calling the book ''replete with factual errors.'' The book became a target of criticism from the moment it was published because of the use of the word ''apartheid'' in the title.

The National Children's Museum, which was formerly called the Capital Children's Museum, was located until 2004 in northwest Washington.

In a phone interview, the museum president and CEO, Kathy Dwyer Southern, described its mission as ''to inspire kids to care about and improve the world'' and called the partnership with Sesame Workshop ''very, very exciting for us.'' The workshop's president and CEO, Gary Knell, said that the workshop had long wanted a permanent museum home.

Vogl of the firm Jones Day, which represents Jeff Koons LLC, sent a cease-and-desist letter to Imm-Living, the Toronto company that manufactures the bookends, and Park Life, a San Francisco gallery that sells them, arguing that they violated Mr. Koons's intellectual property rights. Mr. Koons is well-known for his stainless-steel versions of the canines. Bloggers largely scoffed at the threat, but Park Life decided not to just sit around and see if Mr. Koons would sue. On January 20, its lawyer, Jedediah Wakefield of Fenwick and West, working pro bono, sued Jeff Koons LLC in San Francisco federal court, asking the court to declare that Park Life wasn't infringing on Mr. Koons's i rights. ''They very quickly indicated they weren't interested in putting up a fight,'' Mr. Wakefield said of Mr. Koons's lawyers. Ultimately, Jeff Koons LLC agreed not to pursue the gallery for the sale of the bookends, and the gallery agreed not to indicate that the bookends were by Mr. Koons, which, Mr. Wakefield added, ''they hadn't done and weren't going to do anyway.'' As a result of the deal, he said, he was planning to file on Thursday for a dismissal of the declaratory judgment suit."

But that often amounts to a giant gamble, which is the thrust of the thinking behind a new retirement planning program that treats investing in stocks like a trip to the casino. In this program, however, you lose every single bet you make. In other words, if you invest 60 percent of your contributions to retirement savings in stocks each year, that money is treated as if it were lost on the craps tables. But the program also shows the chances that all will not be lost."

The financial value (if not the artistic merit) of such a work will be determined on March 8 at an auction held by Phillips de Pury & Company, where a painting of the ''Colbert Report'' host will be sold, Comedy Central said on Friday. The painting, ''Portrait 5, Stephen(s)'' and attributed to Mr. Colbert, reached its completed state in an episode of the ''Colbert Report'' shown in December. During a discussion of art with Steve Martin, the author and aesthete, Mr. Colbert asked Mr. Martin how much he would pay for the work.

2011-02-05T00:00:00Z,"9 P.M. (Showtime) A SINGLE MAN (2009) Colin Firth, in the first of his Oscar-nominated roles (he's currently favored to win for best actor for ''The King's Speech''), plays George, a middle-aged professor in 1962 Los Angeles who, in one emotion-filled day, prepares to commit suicide after the death of his longtime lover, Jim (Matthew Goode). Nicholas Hoult is the flirty student and Jon Kortajarena the charming hustler who cross George's path; Julianne Moore (above with Mr. Firth) is Charley, the close friend who wishes she and George could be more. Reviewing this directorial debut from Tom Ford, the former creative director of Gucci, following the outline of the 1964 novel by Christopher Isherwood, Manohla Dargis wrote in The New York Times: ''That Mr. Ford has placed so much weight on Mr. Firth suggests that he knows how valuable his actor is to his first effort. And while 'A Single Man' has its flaws, many of these fade in view of the performance and the power of Isherwood's story. Part of the radical importance of Isherwood's novel is its insistence on the absolute ordinariness of George's life, including with Jim, whose relationship together is pictured only briefly in both the novel and the film, and yet reverberates deeply (then as now). Mr. Ford's single man might be less common than Isherwood's, a bit too exquisitely dressed. But with Mr. Firth, Mr. Ford has created a gay man troubled by ordinary grief and haunted by joy, a man apart and yet like any other.'' 10:30 A.M.

2011-02-06T00:00:00Z,"Fullback John Kuhn is the only active member of the Green Bay Packers with a Super Bowl ring, which he earned during the 2005 season as a member of Pittsburgh's practice squad. Kuhn, 28, was on the Steelers' active roster for nine games in 2006, Bill Cowher's final season as coach. He landed in Green Bay after being cut during Mike Tomlin's first Pittsburgh training camp in 2007. Kuhn, who grew up in York, Pa., and played at Division II Shippensburg University, had a career-high six touchdowns, four rushing and two receiving, this season.Q.You watched the 2010 Super Bowl with sailors inside a nuclear-powered supercarrier off the coast of California. Which is more claustrophobic, the football line of scrimmage or a nuclear supercarrier?A.It's pretty tight quarters. They deserve their just due. They do an incredible job with their everyday life. They go out sometimes for six months at a time, and they go through that whole experience right there, and they are happy to do it. They have great morale while they are out there, and we're very proud of them.Q.Have any of your teammates seen your Super Bowl ring?A.I don't think I've shown it to anyone on this team. We are so focused on trying to win one ourselves that we're not going to get caught up in anything that's happened before or anything like that.Q.Why not use your ring as a motivational prop?A.To me, it is just as much motivation kept away as it is to bring it out. I don't really need to get it out. It's still something that I treasure and really look to sometimes as, Wow, that was a great time in my life. It's something that I want to earn on the field. And I got that one on the practice squad - which is a great accomplishment - but I want to earn one and play a part in the one that we're trying to win this year.Q.What do you make of getting back to the Super Bowl and having your opponent be the team with whom you made your first trip?A.It's pretty funny and fitting even, that I would get the opportunity to play against them in the Super Bowl, and I am very happy for that. But it would not have mattered. It could have been any team in the A.F.C. and we'd have the same focus and determination that we do in this game."

''It all started when I was trying to explain my job to my godson,'' Ms. Morton said, about writing a fairy tale. ''And I realized when you watch a couture show come together -- the drama, the glamour -- you literally see magic.'' Mr. Lacroix was recently forced to close his couture business, but here, at least, he gets a happy ending. Next up: ''Manolo Blahnik and the Tale of the Elves and the Shoemaker.'' CHELSEA ZALOPANY"

Born February 17, 1932 in Los Angeles, California to John and Dorothy (Gall) Malloy, she attended John Burroughs Junior High School, John Marshal High School, University of California at Berkeley, University of Munich, Germany, and UCLA. She was a member of Phi Mu. At UC Berkeley, working towards a Master's degree in Anthropology, she met physicist Dr. Henry (Hank) Briggs Silsbee whom she married in 1956. They moved to Seattle, then Setauket, New York, when Hank accepted a teaching position at Stony Brook University on Long Island. Hank and Joan loved foreign travel, and finding their greatest interest in Africa, returned there many times. Joan was very interested in African archaeology, and social and cultural anthropology, especially in the sociological ramifications of the ivory trade, but had a broad range of interests, covering many fields. She visited more than one hundred fifty countries. Joan was a voracious reader, greatly enjoying her book clubs, and doing volunteer work with art museums and the Republican Party, in both Seattle and Stony Brook. In recent years she had spent Winters in Malibu; in other seasons, she lived on Long Island, New York, or was travelling, mostly to Africa. The destinations of many other trips were defined by the locations of the viewing spots of solar eclipses which she and Hank had routinely managed to attend, the most recent being Joan's trip to Easter Island in July 2010. Joan's proclivity for traveling, resulted in a fascinating and extensive collection of souvenirs and tourist art from around the world.

2011-02-06T00:00:00Z,"Four ways the Steelers can gain an advantage over the Packers on Sunday. Establish the Screen GameThe best way to slow an opponent's pass rush and open up deep opportunities for wide receivers is to establish the screen passing game. The Steelers used screens effectively to complement their deep passing attack all year. On passes thrown behind the line of scrimmage, Ben Roethlisberger was 58-of-75 for 419 yards, with 13 of those short passes netting more than 10 yards. A screen or two to Mike Wallace or Antonio Brown will bring cornerbacks close to the line of scrimmage and make rushers leery, setting the Packers up for the long pass.Hide HarrisonJames Harrison recorded 11 sacks in the regular season, but he also made 27 plays in pass coverage, chasing down running backs, tight ends and the occasional receiver. Unlike Clay Matthews, who rushes the quarterback on most passing plays, Harrison often fakes a blitz, then drops into coverage. If the Steelers can disguise Harrison's assignment until the ball is snapped, they can confuse the Packers' pass protection."

To protect themselves from such a thing ever happening again, they built solid rows of houses -- which are nonetheless turning to vapor in the white heat of the city's 21st-century economic boom.

Graduating from Harvard Magna Cum Laude with highest honors in English (1933), Richard Stebbins taught at Harvard while earning the degrees of A.M.

2011-02-06T00:00:00Z,"MAHON--Myra Ellen. Myra Ellen Mahon (nee Murphy) passed peacefully at home in Delray Beach, Florida, on Saturday, January 29, 2011, embraced and enveloped by the love and caring presence of her dear and cherished husband of 54 years, Arthur J. Mahon, and her four beloved children, Maura, Donna, Arthur and Nancy. Myra was also the dear Nana to her two grandchildren, Christopher and Emelia, and a wonderful mother-in-law to Susan who were holding her hand in spirit when she passed. Myra's date of passing was the Feast Day of Saint Thomas Aquinas, a day that her husband Arthur treasures and holds close to his heart, because on the day when he first met his beautiful, seventeen year-old wife-to-be at a Manhattan College dance, she told him she was reading the teachings of Saint Thomas Aquinas. Born in New York City on April 15, 1937 to James H. Murphy, from County Clare, and Mary Murphy (nee Caroon) from Westmeath, Ireland, Myra was always proud of, and true to, her roots in the Bronx and Ireland. She is predeceased by her parents, her deeply loved sister, Clare, and sisters-in-law, Mary Therese and Delia Rose. Her baby sister, Nula, who Myra loved dearly, survives her. Myra is also survived by her nieces, Maria O'Leary and Diane Slote, to whom she became a surrogate mother after their mothers' deaths, and by twenty other wonderful nieces and nephews from the Neil Mahon, Fitzpatrick, Burris, Thanhauser, and Slote families who were blessed to spend many weekends, Christmases, Thanksgivings, ski trips and also summers in Madison and Candlewood Lake, Connecticut, with their beautiful, generous, wise, funny and slightly irreverent Aunt Myra. A kid from Woodycrest Avenue in the Highbridge section of the Bronx, Myra lived from childhood with enormous intelligence, passion, elegance, conviction and concern for the underdog and the underserved. When the family moved to Queens, she attended St. Agnes High School in College Point. Married at the age of 20 to her love, Arthur, she returned to college as a young mother of four and graduated from Marymount, Tarrytown, summa cum laude as the valedictorian of her class, going on to earn her Masters in Social Work with high honors from Fordham University. Myra initiated her business career as a social worker at the United Way of Tristate in New York City, rising rapidly to Executive Vice President overseeing corporate partnerships and giving. She went on to become the Development Director of the Archdiocese of New York where she was fueled by her passion for raising funds for children to attend inner-city Catholic primary schools like the one she attended, Sacred Heart. An extraordinary team builder, mentor and leader, Myra took great joy and pride in the many people she worked alongside of, and she forever cherished their shared accomplishments and victories. Myra also lent her enormous energy and passion for social justice as a Member of the Board of Directors of a legion of wonderful organizations that embodied her unending commitment to giving all people the opportunity to live full, dignified and joyful lives. Those organizations included Marymount College, Women In Need, New York Foundation, Calvary Hospital and Hospice, New York State Parks and Recreation Commission, Museum of the City of New York and the Healthcare Chaplaincy. Myra took great joy serving for many years as the Co-Chair of the Women's Health Symposium at Weill Cornell Medical Center with her very dear friend and fellow New Yorker, Joan Weill. Myra was surprised five years ago when her loving husband, Arthur, told her that the second floor of the Weill Cornell Medical College's new building under construction at 1305 York Avenue in New York City would contain a resource center and it would be named in her honor. She was so pleased that the Myra Mahon Patient Resource Center included reading rooms and a library to help patients and families learn about and manage their illnesses. Upon its completion, Myra personally dedicated the Center ""To those who serve unseen."" Myra's immediate family and her personal assistant, Joan Hanebury, whom Myra loved dearly, attended a private memorial mass on Monday, January 31, 2011, at Holy Name of Jesus Church, Palm Beach, Florida, to honor and bless her memory. How appropriate and meaningful it is that Monday was the feast day of St. John Bosco, who dedicated his life to the education of poor children. There will be a mass celebrating Myra's life and all of her many loves, joys and accomplishments at Saint Patrick's Cathedral in New York City in the Spring. Donations in Myra's memory can be made to the Inner City Scholarship Fund of the Archdiocese of New York (Ms. Helen Lowe (212)371-1011, ext. 3325) for the Myra Mahon Fund for students at the Sacred Heart School in the Bronx, or to the Weill Cornell Medical College (Mr. Larry Schafer (212)746-4070) for the support of the Myra Mahon Patient Resource Center. Myra blessed the many people she loved with her warm spirit, endless wisdom, grace and intuitive gift for understanding and helping them. She leaves us with the memory of her sharing her favorite Irish prayer, ""May the road rise up to meet you. May the wind always be at your back. May the sun shine warm upon your face, and rain fall soft upon your fields. And until we meet again, may God hold you in the hollow of His hand."""

Using complex investment transactions, they can limit the downside on their holdings, or even profit, as other shareholders are suffering."

2011-02-06T00:00:00Z,"Four ways the Packers can gain an advantage over the Steelers on Sunday: Pass on First DownThe Steelers allow only 2.5 yards per run on first down. The Packers average 7.9 yards per pass on first down. Forget ''establishing the run;'' the Packers must play their style of football, spreading the field on early downs and using the running game as a counterpunch.Beware the BunchThe Steelers like to run from a ''trips bunch'' formation, with two wide receivers and a tight end aligned in a V on one side of the line. The trips bunch is traditionally a passing formation, but with hard-blocking Hines Ward and Heath Miller bunched together, the formation creates a Bermuda Triangle of blocks for running back Rashard Mendenhall. The Steelers average 6.5 yards per rush on runs to the outside, thanks in large part to their receivers' blocking ability. Packers defenders must slice through the bunch, stay away from Miller's and Ward's crack blocks, and keep Mendenhall contained."

Behrman passed away comfortably on January 30th after a short battle with colon cancer. He is remembered by his former colleagues and residents for his 55 years of both clinical and academic excellence. During his tenure as Chief his abilities to teach, innovate upon, and improve jaw surgery led to significant advances in his specialty of Orthodontics. The generations of surgeons he trained, and patients he helped with his advanced and specialized techniques, are his legacy. A graduate of New York University and the University of Pittsburgh School of Dentistry, Dr. Behrman was one of the founders of the technique of intra-oral surgical manipulation of the upper and or lower jaw to correct deformities, improved the esthetic appearance, and improved the occlusion or, bite. Dr. Behrman was a practitioner and life long friend to many celebrated personalities. Amongst others this included the star, Betty Davis. He was able to preserve her mandible from a severe bone infection as she was performing on Broadway. He was acclaimed throughout the media, appearing on television numerous times and including the CBS special, The Body Human-The Body Beautiful. He is survived by his wife Marla, stepson Peter Grayson and his wife Josephine, grandsons Bradley and Eric, and brother Lawrence. He lived his life generously, intelligently, and faithfully and gave life a rich and purposeful meaning. A celebration of his life will be held at a later date.

2011-02-06T00:00:00Z,"HULINGS--Clark, an Artist who Pursued Timeless Beauty, Dies at Age 88. Clark Hulings, whose paintings are prized by art collectors worldwide, died on Wednesday, February 2, 2011, in Santa Fe, NM, where he lived. He was 88. As one of the leading American realist painters, Mr. Hulings traveled the world looking for rural and urban landscapes and genre scenes that became the subjects of paintings reflecting the vibrancy of the human spirit. Admired for his genius in manipulating the formal elements, he searched for beauty in places where others might only find misery: In the world of street people he saw compassion and self-respect. In urban alleyways he envisioned sunlit corridors of family activity. Among rustic farmers he discovered people whose lives were synchronized with cycles of the seasons and the animals they care for. Mr. Hulings' ability to see timeless beauty in momentary human gestures and activities won him the appellation ""master"" on numerous occasions. His celebration of textures as expressed through light, shadow, and atmosphere was explained as ""describing air itself."" His modesty in the face of such acclaim was legendary. Throughout his career he maintained a personal profile far lower than his national acclaim. Mr. Hulings' subject matter was gathered throughout North America and Europe, notably France, Italy, and Spain, where he lived as a child and frequently visited as an adult. Among his signature subjects are complex Mexican and European market scenes that include panoplies of colors, surfaces, and shapes. His affection for donkeys was a trademark, with the animal's quiet demeanors becoming a metaphor of human patience and perseverance. Born in Florida, November 20, 1922, Mr. Hulings was raised in Westfield, NJ. Over his lifetime, he resided in New York, Louisiana, and throughout Europe before settling in Santa Fe in 1972. His art training began as a teenager with Sigismund Ivanowsky and the fames draftsman George Bridgman and continued at The Art Students League with Frank Reilly. With a degree in physics from Haverford College, PA., Hulings pursued an initial career as a portraitist in Louisiana, followed by freelance illustration in New York, notably paperback book covers, during the 1950s. By the early 1960s, Mr. Hulings devoted himself to easel paintings. In 1965 he debuted in New York, N.Y., at The Grand Central Art Galleries. In 1976 he was the subject of a solo exhibition at the National Cowboy and Western Heritage Center, Oklahoma City, Ok., which was documented in the book Hulings--A Collection of Oil Paintings (Lowell Press), followed in 1978 by a retrospective at the Museum of the Southwest, Midland, TX, and a 1981 exhibition at the C.M. Russell Museum, Great Falls, Mt. Most recently, Mr. Hulings' work was the subject of a 2007 one-man exhibition at J.N. Bartfield Galleries, New York, and Morris & Whiteside Galleries, Hilton Head, SC. His scheduled exhibition of paintings at the Forbes Galleries, New York, takes place March 23 through June 18, 2011. In 1986, Mr. Hulings authored the book A Gallery of Paintings by Clark Hulings (White Burro Publishing). The book was updated and reissued in soft cover in 2006. His paintings have been included in countless articles and surveys such as The Majesty of the Grand Canyon: 150 Years of Art (Pomegranate Press) and Landscapes of New Mexico: Paintings of the Land of Enchantment (Fresco Fine Art Publishing). He is the recipient of several awards from organizations such as The Allied Artists of America, The Salmagundi Club and The Hudson Valley Art Association. In 1973 he received the Prix de West award from the National Cowboy and Western Heritage Museum, where his painting Grand Canyon, Kaibab Trail is in the permanent collection. In his adopted state, Mr. Hulings was recognized with his first one-man show in 1945 at the New Mexico Museum of Art, Santa Fe. In 1985, the museum installed a Hulings plaque on its artist walk of fame; and in 2004, he received the New Mexico Governor's Award for Excellence in the Arts. Mr. Hulings is survived by his wife Mary Belfi Hulings, daughter Elizabeth Hulings Diamond, son-in-law Patrick Diamond, grandson Nicolas and sister Susan Ottinger. In lieu of flowers, donations are being accepted at the Santa Fe Community Foundation for the Clark Hulings' Memorial Fund, 516 Alto St., Santa Fe, NM 87501, www.santafecf.org. The fund will provide support for visual artists Arrangements are under the direction of Berardinelli Family Funeral Service 1399 Luisa Street Santa Fe, NM 87505 (505) 984-8600 Please sign our guestbook for the family at: berardinellifuneralhome.com"

In small towns, even on the somewhat more aware coast of Maine, the audiences for films that people have not been repeatedly beaten over the head about rarely rise to sufficient awareness. Unknown films, especially with subtitles, are doomed before they start. The same people who happily read screen crawls on CNN and MSNBC seem to not make the effort in a theater.''"

''Inside Job'' won for best documentary; the director and lead writer, Charles Ferguson, was also in Los Angeles. In New York, we got Kathleen Turner, John Waters, Denis O'Hare and John Laroquette as presenters (and Tina Fey in the audience). But it was okay, because it allowed Ms. Schaal - full disclosure, a pal of the Bagger's - to earn her comedic keep. And did she! She opened the show with a song-and-dance number that she lip-synced with the help of a passel of male dancers. She made numerous costume changes, each more ludicrous than the last, and accepted for absent winners, doing their speeches on their behalf; one was apparently Spanish, and another a smoker."

Bert Fields, a lawyer for the Weinsteins, said Mr. Moore had been paid everything he was due, and was trying to make a public spectacle out of what he called ''a routine kind of auditing'' dispute. ''Mr. Moore has put in a number of very inflammatory claims designed for the press,'' Mr. Fields added. ''He should be ashamed of himself.'' Larry Stein, a lawyer for Mr. Moore, said in a statement that Mr. Moore had never sued anyone in his filmmaking career and that ''it's very sad that it had to come to this.''Mr. Moore and the Weinsteins have worked together on several films, including ''Sicko'' and ''The Big One.''

2011-02-09T00:00:00Z,"FRIEDMAN--Samuel Nathaniel, 94, grew up in a small apartment on Saratoga Avenue in Brownsville, Brooklyn, and died Monday night at his spacious park-view Central Park West apartment. He went the way he would have wanted to, having dinner with his wife, Barbara Somers, a gourmet cook. Sam, as he was known, had led a full and happy life until a few years ago when he began to have health problems. He was blind and wheelchair-bound at his death. But until the last few years, he was a force of nature for family and friends. Tall, handsome (a striking resemblance to Gregory Peck), a great story teller, a fabulous businessman and salesman, agricultural expert and possessed of exquisite taste. He wore off-the-rack clothing that looked as if it were bespoken. His favorite garment was a loose black shirt designed by friend, Massimo Vignelli. As a youth, Sam was an avid Zionist as was his father, Israel, an immigrant from Cracow and a union leader. Sam's mother Sarah immigrated from Siroka in what is now Moldova. He spent all his teens through the Depression years (he was thirteen at the crash of 1929) and had to work after school throughout his high school years to help support the family. Sam worked his way through Cornell and got a BS, '36, in diary chemistry. During summers, he worked as an apprentice on dairy farms upstate. His father had hopes Sam would go to what was then Palestine as a pioneer. But Sam was a committed American and moved to a then-new cooperative community in central New Jersey called Jersey Homesteads, later Roosevelt, where, with his first wife, Charlotte Safir, he raised three children - Miriam Aliminos, 60; Dinah Lefkowitz, 66; and Joshua Friedman, 69. At the end of WWII, a friend and neighbor, artist Ben Shahn, introduced Sam to Klaus Grabe, a Bauhaus-trained German architect who had fled to Mexico as a political refugee in the 1930's. Sam went to work for Klaus in his furniture business, which -- despite Sam's efforts-did not prosper. But Sam stayed in furniture, working for other firms -- Berge Norman and George Tanier -- and then started his own firm ICF (International Contract Furnishings) in 1962 with a friend from Tanier, Hal Stearns. Aided by furniture designer Pat Hoffman, who became his second wife, Sam built ICF into an iconic design firm. He introduced Americans to classic architect-designed European furniture of the early 20th Century--especially that of Finnish architect Alvar Aalto. ICF introduced to the United States market the work of Josef Hoffmann, Mario Botta, Philippe Starck and Richard Neutra, among others. At its height, ICF was blazing the way for a look that persists in executive suites around the U.S. When Pat Hoffman died of cancer, Sam was heartsick, sold ICF and retired. He spent the rest of his life gardening at his country home in Amagansett, entertaining in his city apartment, then on Park Ave., and traveling with Barbara, who became his third wife. But most of all, he loved doting on his grandchildren and great grandchildren: Miriam and husband Yannis' kids: Angelos, Kiki, Lysistrata, Cassandra; Dinah and Stephen Lefkowitz's kids: Benjamin and Bridget Bly (Nora and Zoe) and Jennifer and Robert Donahue (Cait and Samantha); and Josh and Carol Ash Friedman's daughter, Susannah and her fiance, Gareth Crawford. As if that weren't enough nachas, he also doted on his nieces and nephews, the children of his surviving brother, Abraham Friedman and wife Diana, and the children of his deceased sister Esther Swiller-and their kids' kids. Funeral service, Wednesday, 12:45pm at The Riverside, 331 Amsterdam Ave., at 76th St. Burial for family only will follow at Cedar Park Cemetery, Paramus, NJ. For Shiva information contact Riverside at 212-362-6600. It was a full and happy life."
2011-02-09T00:00:00Z,"CARSKY--Katherine. The Westchester Community College family extends condolences to the family of our friend Katherine ""Kay"" Carsky. For decades, Kay had been a strong supporter of both the college and the Westchester Community College Foundation. Her lifelong interest in education led her to assist in the college's expansion during her successful tenure as a county legislator. This support continued after she left her government role and became a member of the foundation board. As a foundation board member, she was involved in various aspects of community outreach. She was also instrumental in a number of other projects including the structuring of student focus groups, the formulation of the foundation's strategic plan, and the implementation of the Gateway Center project which resulted in fundraising for and construction of a new classroom building in 2010. Kay was an active and dedicated member of the board and used her intelligence, wisdom accrued during her many years as a legislator, and natural warmth to help the college and foundation realize its many goals relating to educational access. She will be missed by the college's trustees, administrators, faculty, staff and students in addition to those who work with the foundation."

2011-02-09T00:00:00Z,"C.C. Sabathia was the heaviest player in baseball last season, but he may be on the verge of ceding that distinction. A sleeker version of Sabathia, who carried a listed 309 pounds on his 6-foot 7-inch frame, is scheduled to report to Yankees spring training after an off-season recovering from arthroscopic knee surgery. A baseball official confirmed that Sabathia had lost weight but could not say whether it was as much as 30 pounds, as reported Tuesday on Twitter by ESPN's Buster Olney. Sabathia has never missed a start in two seasons with the Yankees, but shedding weight would alleviate the stress on his right knee.

2011-02-09T00:00:00Z,"Over the centuries, Galileo's trial in 1633 for defending heliocentrism -- that Earth orbits the Sun, not the other way around -- the Inquisition's finding that he was ''vehemently suspect of heresy'' and his recantation have grown far beyond just a seminal clash between science and religion. The Galileo affair has become general shorthand for speaking truth to power, a cautionary tale to invoke whenever new ideas challenge the established order. A play that peels back the myths and metaphors, then, to peer into the personal would be welcome. Too often the legend wins out, starting with the notion that Galileo, having renounced his belief that Earth moves, muttered, ''But still, it moves.'' (There is no evidence that he did.) Brecht's famous drama ''Life of Galileo'' buys into that rumor and goes even further, painting a harsh portrait of a sly self-promoter who turns cowardly when it counts most."

But Mr. Bilal's body rejected one of the posts, despite treatment with antibiotics and steroids, and he was in constant pain. So on Friday he had the post removed. While the wound heals, he is tying the camera to the back of his neck. Why didn't he do that in the first place? ""It's a performance,"" he told the Chronicle. ""With the performance comes endurance.

2011-02-10T00:00:00Z,"The rise of e-books and declining store sales have led to layoffs at Powell's Books, the landmark bookstore in Portland, Ore. The store's management said on Tuesday it would lay off 31 employees as part of its ''response to the unprecedented, rapidly changing nature of the book industry.'' Ryan Takas, the union representative for the employees who were laid off, said that the 31 employees make up more than 7 percent of the store's 400-person unionized work force. Mr. Takas said that Powell's had reduced its work force by about 40 employees in the last year through attrition, but still felt that layoffs were necessary because of a decline in sales of new books and a rise in health care costs. It was the first round of layoffs since the store's workers formed a union in 2000. This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print."

(13) BORIS GODUNOV The German bass René Pape, above, has the title role in the Metropolitan Opera's new production of Mussorgsky's work, based on a play by Alexander Pushkin, about the reign of the ruthless 16th- and 17th-century Russian czar. Stephen Wadsworth directed, taking over from Peter Stein, who quit three months before the October premiere; Valery Gergiev conducts. Reviewing ''Boris Godunov,'' presented here by ''Great Performances at the Met'' and running three and a half hours, Anthony Tommasini wrote in The New York Times: ''This production comes to life through the nuanced and affecting performances of the cast and chorus. This is Mr. Wadsworth's doing, abetted, of course, by the vivid, gravely beautiful performance elicited by Mr. Gergiev.'' Still, Mr. Tommasini said: ''The production does not seem fully realized. How could it be? It is impossible to know what Mr. Wadsworth would have done had he been able to fashion a look and concept that conveyed his insights into the story as told by Mussorgsky.'' Mr. Pape, he wrote, not only looked regal and imposing but ''has vocal charisma as well, and his dark, penetrating voice is ideal for the role. Not knowing Russian, I cannot vouch for the idiomatic quality of his singing. But his enunciation was crisp and natural. And in every language Mr. Pape makes words matter.'' 8 P.M.

A piece of dust that is 100 microns in diameter (the size of a dot of chalk powder) will fall about a foot a second, said Richard Flagan, chairman of the chemical engineering program at the California Institute of Technology. A mote that is 1 micron in diameter, the size of a bacteria, will fall just 30 microns a second. And many of the particles created by cooking, which is a leading source of indoor dust, measure less than half a micron across."

At the time, the Canadian pension had roughly $150 million, or 3 percent of its assets, devoted to private equity, with the bulk in so-called funds of funds that invest across several different portfolios. Alberta Teachers' quickly found the approach too expensive and pulled its money from such intermediaries. Instead, the pension fund opted to handle private equity in-house, increasing its allocation to as much as 10 percent."
2011-02-10T00:00:00Z,"FRIEDMAN--Samuel Nathaniel, 94, grew up in a small apartment on Saratoga Avenue in Brownsville, Brooklyn, and died Monday night at his spacious park-view Central Park West apartment. He went the way he would have wanted to, having dinner with his wife, Barbara Somers, a gourmet cook. Sam, as he was known, had led a full and happy life until a few years ago when he began to have health problems. He was blind and wheelchair-bound at his death. But until the last few years, he was a force of nature for family and friends. Tall, handsome (a striking resemblance to Gregory Peck), a great story teller, a fabulous businessman and salesman, agricultural expert and possessed of exquisite taste. He wore off-the-rack clothing that looked as if it were bespoken. His favorite garment was a loose black shirt designed by friend, Massimo Vignelli. As a youth, Sam was an avid Zionist as was his father, Israel, an immigrant from Cracow and a union leader. Sam's mother Sarah immigrated from Siroka in what is now Moldova. He spent all his teens through the Depression years (he was thirteen at the crash of 1929) and had to work after school throughout his high school years to help support the family. Sam worked his way through Cornell and got a BS, '36, in dairy chemistry. During summers, he worked as an apprentice on dairy farms upstate. His father had hopes Sam would go to what was then Palestine as a pioneer. But Sam was a committed American and moved to a then-new cooperative community in central New Jersey called Jersey Homesteads, later Roosevelt, where, with his first wife, Charlotte Safir, he raised three children - Miriam Alimonos, 59; Dinah Lefkowitz, 66; and Joshua Friedman, 69. At the end of WWII, a friend and neighbor, artist Ben Shahn, introduced Sam to Klaus Grabe, a Bauhaus-trained German architect who had fled to Mexico as a political refugee in the 1930's. Sam went to work for Klaus in his furniture business, which -- despite Sam's efforts-did not prosper. But Sam stayed in furniture, working for other firms -- Berge Norman and George Tanier -- and then started his own firm ICF (International Contract Furnishings) in 1962 with a friend from Tanier, Hal Stearns. Aided by furniture designer Pat Hoffman, who became his second wife, Sam built ICF into an iconic design firm. He introduced Americans to classic architect-designed European furniture of the early 20th Century--especially that of Finnish architect Alvar Aalto. ICF introduced to the United States market the work of Josef Hoffmann, Mario Botta, Philippe Starck and Richard Neutra, among others. At its height, ICF was blazing the way for a look that persists in executive suites around the U.S. When Pat Hoffman died of cancer, Sam was heartsick, sold ICF and retired. He spent the rest of his life gardening at his country home in Amagansett, entertaining in his city apartment, then on Park Ave., and traveling with Barbara, who became his third wife. But most of all, he loved doting on his grandchildren and great grandchildren: Miriam and husband Yannis' kids: Angelos, Aggeliki, Lysistrati, Cassandra; Dinah and Stephen Lefkowitz's kids: Benjamin and Bridget Bly (Nora and Zoe) and Jennifer and Robert Donahue (Cait and Samantha); and Josh and Carol Ash Friedman's daughter, Susannah and her fiance, Gareth Crawford. As if that weren't enough nachas, he also doted on his nieces and nephews, the children of his surviving brother, Abraham Friedman and wife Diana, and the children of his deceased sister Esther Swiller-and their kids' kids. Funeral service, Wednesday, 12:45pm at The Riverside, 331 Amsterdam Ave., at 76th St. Burial for family only will follow at Cedar Park Cemetery, Paramus, NJ. For Shiva information contact Riverside at 212-362-6600. It was a full and happy life."

Christina Aguilera, Jennifer Hudson, Martina McBride, Yolanda Adams and Florence Welch will participate in the homage to the 68-year-old Ms. Franklin. Grammy sponsors are describing it as a ''valentine'' and a ''get-well card'' to Ms. Franklin, who has won 18 Grammys herself. She was hospitalized in Detroit late last year, underwent surgery for an undisclosed ailment and canceled several months' worth of scheduled performances.

2011-02-10T00:00:00Z,"For modern viewers, Aristophanes' ''Lysistrata'' may be easier to admire than to like. The story, of course, compels: Lysistrata leads the Athenian and Spartan women in a sex strike to end the war between their cities. But all that ribaldry and priapism can be tough going. (Hell, perhaps, is other people's bawdy comedy.) In Theodora Skipitares's production of ''Lysistrata'' at La MaMa, her puppets and masks come to the rescue. They provide distance between audience and play, a veil that offers both discretion and license. The puppets, mostly life-size and elegantly attired, are used for the individual characters. The choruses, male and female, are masked and more grotesque. They sport crude wigs and exaggerated sexual appendages: cloth penises for the gents and, for the ladies, pendulous breasts attached to their tunics."

He won a title in the Continental Basketball Association, with the Albany Patroons. He even coached a few tours in Puerto Rico. Yet somehow, Jackson never made it back to his N.B.A. roots, back to his favorite city, back to the corner of 33rd Street and Eighth Avenue. Jackson interviewed with the Knicks three times over the last three decades but the timing was never right. In 1987, the Knicks passed up Jackson, then coaching the Patroons, to hire Rick Pitino. Jackson joined the Chicago Bulls' staff. Twelve years and six championships later, Jackson - a free agent after leaving the Bulls - spoke with the Garden president Dave Checketts. The exploratory talks went nowhere and Jackson instead joined the Los Angeles Lakers. Jackson was a free agent again in 2005 when Isiah Thomas asked him to coach the Knicks. Jackson declined because he got a better offer: a return to the Lakers. Now 65, Jackson intends to retire from the N.B.A. after this season, and this time for good. The opportunity for a prodigal return has seemingly passed. But at least one authority on Jackson can still envision him joining the Knicks some day. ""Phil is definitely a full-circle kind of a guy, and that would bring him full circle,"" said Jeanie Buss, Jackson's girlfriend and a Lakers executive."

2011-02-11T18:00:29Z,"For the modern YouTube hunter the world of Japanese television and pop culture can be a seemingly bottomless treasure trove. Among some of the finest gems are clips like the one above of Takarazuka, a 98-year-old Japanese song and dance troupe that specializes in performing adaptations of Western pop songs, classic musicals, operas, plays, novels or films as well as Japanese folk tales. (The clip above shows the musical number ""The Great Century,"" which incorporates the '80s soft rock anthem ""Final Countdown."") But in a bizarre twist on the idea of an all-male Shakespearean cast, the members of the ensemble are all women - making Takarazuka perhaps the only Vegas-style musical theater group in the world with professional drag kings on permanent payroll. But despite appearances, Takarazuka was never meant as an early-20th-century chorus line for Japanese women's liberation. To this day, cast members are put through a rigorous and patriarchally organized training program for several years before they are even allowed to set one foot on stage, with ""female"" (musumeyaku) and ""male"" (otokoyaku) actresses strictly separated in classrooms and dormitories. The inevitable lesbian overtones were largely ignored until the mid- to late 1930s, when Japanese officials were alarmed to a point that a ban on contact between the ""male"" cast members and their passionate female fans was imposed. To this day, most of Takarazuka's over-2.5 million-strong annual audience consists of women, and so do the performers: an attempt in the 1940s to introduce male actors was successfully boycotted by Takarazuka's own disgruntled cast."

2011-02-11T17:21:22Z,"One thing to love about fashion is its extravagance. Fashion wouldn't be fashion without it. What matters is the look. It has to dazzle the eye before anything else, and so do the photographs that sell it. It's the image that counts and Philip-Lorca diCorcia is one photographer who knows from imagery. The fashion spreads he created for W magazine from 1997 through 2008 are lavish productions that don't just illustrate a moment in style but tell a story about representation itself."

While Mr. Fincher is celebrated for doing dozens and dozens of takes , what's often forgotten is that other people then have to look at each and every one of those takes to put the film together. Apparently they don't mind; the editors Kirk Baxter and Angus Wall, and the sound designer, editor and mixer Ren Klyce have all worked with Mr. Fincher multiple times, on films like ""The Curious Case of Benjamin Button"" and ""Zodiac.""

The Danish manufacturer Gubi recently shifted its attention towards resurrecting mid-century design icons, and the first fruits of that effort are on display this week. It has reissued Greta Grossman's 1947 Grasshopper lamp and the 1966 Stokke Chair by Jens Qvistgaard, and is now the sole owner of reproduction rights for the cult Hungarian designer Mathieu Mategot's work, starting with a multicolored coat rack and two pieces in his signature perforated metal: the Nagasaki chair and the Dedal bookcase.

2011-02-11T15:00:12Z,"The sports analytics movement has given basketball decision makers more valuable information than they have ever had, but, in a way, their experience in implementing their findings is atypical in the information age. The modern world is marked by the rapid dissemination of incredible amounts of information to relevant and interested parties; people from all over the planet know more today about one another and the world they inhabit than any human beings have before, primarily because of how freely information is exchanged. When it comes to analytical data in sports, however, coaches in particular face a unique challenge in passing along the statistical information they deem important. It's not enough to know that a player is most effective running one type of play or shooting from one area of the floor. Coaches today must also understand how to convey that information in a way that makes it digestible and useful."

Now the producers of the Broadway musical ""Spider-Man: Turn Off the Dark"" are offering $60 goodie bags to people who serve in focus groups that will respond to several performances. Two focus groups attended Thursday night's performance, and four more are scheduled to be at Friday night's show and the Saturday matinee. It's not unheard of for Broadway producers to use focus groups, and the musical has used them before since preview performances began on Nov. 28. But these are the first since largely negative reviews of the show by theater critics across the country were published on Tuesday. OnTrack Research, a marketing and consulting firm, is coordinating the focus groups, and here's the rub: participants only get to see Act I or Act II, not both. They are then asked to fill out surveys and join in discussions in a ""V.I.P. room."" The details of the focus groups were outlined in an e-mail to participants from OnTrack Research.

This translated into nearly nude skin (with a bit of rosy blush and a touch of shimmery powder topping cheeks), bare brows, lashes and eyelids, punctuated with a statement lip. ""We started with a red lipstick, the definition of a grown-up woman,"" said Pecheux, noting that the designer's fall 2011 collection seemed more adult to him than previous seasons. ""To twist it, we are adding a layer of metallic color."" Lips were lined with M.A.C. Cherry Lip Pencil, filled in with a lipstick color being tested for fall tentatively called Runaway Red (according to M.A.C., Dare You is the closest shade currently available), dusted with M.A.C. Invisible Powder, and then dabbed with M.A.C. pigments in silver, rose gold and melon. ""I'm not a fan of a lip with shimmer, a frosted lip - I think it's cheesy,"" said Pecheux of his matte metallic creation. The look was paired with a hairstyle inspired by Tippi Hedren's character in ""The Birds,"" using Wella Ocean Spritz for texture and extensions with roots dyed into them.

As a result, the museum would only show photographs, multimedia presentations, and a recreation of an excavation site; it offered refunds to those who had bought advance tickets and said that the exhibition would now be free."

Originally published in W magazine, between 1997 and 2008, the images are a remarkable record of a free-spirited period in publishing that seemed to come to an end with the recession and, as well, the Internet. They speak directly to the eye of Mr. diCorcia, with their capacity to excite and disturb, and to seek truth about human behavior in the most banal of scenes. These photographs were also the result of a fortuitous collaboration between Mr. diCorcia and Dennis Freedman, the former art director of W, who gave the artist carte blanche to shoot fashion stories in places like Havana, Cairo and New York. They have collected all 11 shoots in a new book, ""Eleven"" (Damiani Editions)."

This is no prank call. It's the city's latest attempt to get students who persistently skip class to start showing up more often. The campaign, appropriately named ''Wake Up! NYC,'' rolls out next week. It will focus on the 6,500 students who have been absent for 10 or more school days in a single year and attend one of the 25 schools whose principals volunteered to join the effort. If it yields results, it will be expanded citywide, where roughly 250,000 students miss at least one month of school in a given year, officials said."
2011-02-11T00:00:00Z,"Williamstown Theater Festival has announced three mainstage productions for summer 2011: a Broadway-bound revival of Moss Hart and George S. Kaufman's ''You Can't Take It With You,'' directed by Christopher Ashley; Oliver Goldsmith's Restoration comedy ''She Stoops to Conquer,'' directed by Nicholas Martin; and ''Ten Cents a Dance,'' a celebration of the songs of Rodgers and Hart, directed by John Doyle. The company usually produces four mainstage shows, but Jenny Gersten, the new artistic director, said in a phone interview that the cut was not based on financial constraints; in fact, she said, the budget for the season was ''exactly the same'' as last year, or a little over $3 million. Rather, she said, she wanted to experiment with running two of the shows (''You Can't Take It With You'' and ''Ten Cents a Dance'') for longer than the typical two-week Williamstown run. ''We're trying to run them a little bit longer and see if that gives them time to catch on,'' she said."

Hubschman, who had a distinguished career in law, government and business, died of cancer at the age of 63 in his Greenwich, Connecticut home on February 9, 2011. He was revered by all as a person of the highest intellect, character and integrity, as a caring and steadfast friend, and as a loving and devoted husband and father who put his family first. His boundless energy, insatiable curiosity, bed-rock authenticity, deep compassion, wry humor, natural leadership and commitment to the public interest made him an exemplar in both his professional and personal life and earned him profound respect, admiration and love from all who knew him. Henry was born in Newark, New Jersey on August 12, 1947, the son of Morris and Esther (Weissmann). On June 9, 1985, he married Joanne L. Goode, and their marriage of 25 years was marked by strong mutual support, the shared joy of raising their four children and Joanne's selfless care-giving in the last years of Henry's life. They took special pleasure in hosting friends and family at their summer home on Martha's Vineyard. He is survived by Joanne, his two daughters, Lilly and Josie, his two sons, Ellis and Nathan, as well as his sister, Susan Wainberg, and his nephews, Jonathan (wife Sarah) and Zev (wife Cara) Wainberg. As a father, he had high expectations for his children's service to society but also was committed to helping them find their own lodestar and chart their own course. Henry graduated summa cum laude from Rutgers University in 1969 and magna cum laude from Harvard Law School in 1973, the same year in which he received a Master's in Public Policy from Harvard's Kennedy School of Government. He was a law clerk to Judge Frank Murray of the U.S. District Court for Massachusetts from 1973-74.

Following his outstanding service in law and government, he became General Counsel of GE Aircraft Engines in 1992, where he was a lawyer, counselor and leader beloved by the global leadership both of GEAE and the parent company, GE. In 1997, he became the President and CEO of GE Capital Aviation Services, the commercial aircraft financing and leasing business of GE (and a unit of GE Capital). He enjoyed remarkable global success, growing the company to a fleet of 1800 aircraft placed with nearly 250 airlines in over 75 countries. Under his leadership, the company's aircraft assets grew from $10 billion to $49 billion, making it the largest aircraft leasing business in the world. It had offices in 25 cities across the globe and offered productivity solutions as well as aircraft finance to the world's airlines. Henry has been widely recognized as one of the aviation industry's outstanding leaders, enjoying unqualified respect from his customers and his competitors. Henry served as Chairman of GE Capital Aviation Services from 2009 until his retirement earlier this year. He has served as a director of the GE Fund and the Jewish Federation of Greenwich.

The camera was to take a photograph every minute as the professor, Wafaa Bilal, went about his day. The project, which raised privacy concerns at the university, was called ''The 3rd I,'' and was organized by a new Qatari museum called Mathaf: Arab Museum of Modern Art. According to the Chronicle, the device, which was installed by a body modification artist in a tattoo shop in Los Angeles, was originally mounted on three posts that were attached to a titanium plate implanted between Mr. Bilal's skin and his skull. But Mr. Bilal's body rejected one of the posts, despite treatment with antibiotics and steroids, and he was in constant pain. So on Friday he had the post removed. While the wound heals, he is tying the camera to the back of his neck. Why didn't he do that in the first place? ''It's a performance,'' he told the Chronicle. ''With the performance comes endurance.

Born in Rochester, she received her diploma in Art and Design from the Rochester Athenaeum in 1935, then set out for New York City, where she kept painting for seven-plus decades. From 1959-61 and again from 1964-69 she was at the Art Students League and later painted daily at her Union Square studio. Her work was selected for the ASL's Fellowship Exhibition, optioned for its permanent collection, and selected for a juried show at the National Academy. She loved painting, but she loved her family even more, worrying about, fussing over, and taking care of one and all. She is survived by George, her husband of 71 years, her children Michael and Judy, grandchildren Abby and Ben, and great-grandchildren Micah and Emmet. In the days since her passing, cards and letters from the many people drawn to her over the years speak of her ""vibrant and infectious warmth,"" ""easygoing charm and friendship,"" ""independence and lack of pretense,"" ""generosity of spirit,"" and ""open, kind good nature."" All true, and yet not enough to do her justice. We miss her so. Her memorial will be held Sunday, February 13, 2011, 1:00pm, at The Pen and Brush, 16 E. 10th St. Send donations in her memory to the New York Theater Workshop, NARAL Pro-Choice America, or Amnesty International."

At once sensual and tough, the clothes made a statement. Retailers were impressed with Mr. Altuzarra's sophistication. But there is another aspect of his talent that has shown itself before: a desire to be a little less constructed and formal. On Saturday night, at Milk Studios, Mr. Altuzarra played with that style for his loosest, most commercial collection to date. It wasn't his most exciting, but it may relate easily to how young women like to dress. And it may supply Mr. Altuzarra with working capital for future collections."

""I'm using a purple lipstick on the bottom [lid] and then brown shadow over it, and then I'm using black liner to rim the eyes. I'm bringing the shadow down further than normal. The cheeks are just windswept; I'm using that same purple color all over the cheeks and the lips."" The hairstylist Guido Palau crafted very loose braids of varying thickness and number to go with the reference. ""It's very clean and natural,"" he said. ""I want it to feel hardly in there, so there's a point of reference but it's not overly anything--like when a girl starts braiding her hair by herself. It's kind of an easy one.""

The exhibition, ''Secrets of the Silk Road,'' which includes materials, including two mummies, recently excavated at desert burial sites in western China, was organized by the Bowers Museum in Santa Ana, Calif., and was shown there last year and subsequently at the Houston Museum of Natural Science, where it closed on Jan. 2. It was scheduled to open at the Penn Museum on February 5, but last week, three days before the planned opening, the museum announced that China had requested that none of the artifacts be displayed. As a result, the museum would only show photographs, multimedia presentations, and a recreation of an excavation site; it offered refunds to those who had bought advance tickets and said that the exhibition would now be free. The problem now seems to have been crossed signals between the museum and the Chinese government, in which the museum was approved as a venue by regional officials but not, as required, by the central authorities in Beijing. The Philadelphia Inquirer on Thursday quoted a spokesman for the Chinese Embassy, Wang Baodong, saying that the central government had only approved the show going to Santa Ana and Houston."

Her lifelong involvement in the arts of New Haven was honored twice. In 2005, she received the C. Newton Schenck III Award for Lifetime Achievement and Contribution to the Arts from the Arts Council of Greater New Haven, a cast bronze award which she had designed in 1993. In 2010 Mrs. Lapides was the recipient of the New Haven Symphony Women of Note Award. She pursued her artistic talent in the 1960s when she began painting with watercolors, acrylic and oils. Always on top of the current trends in art, fashion and style, she began creating oversized abstract paintings. She could be often found exploring MoMA and the galleries of NYC. Mrs. Lapides began sculpting, inspired by the aluminum manufactured at her husband's company, United Aluminum Corporation in North Haven. Kaiser Aluminum purchased several of her sculptures for their national headquarters in Oakland, California, and also produced a video on Mrs. Lapides' work, which was shown on public television. She was awarded commissions for cast bronze sculptures for local and national charities and organizations. Mrs. Lapides' tree of life sculptures are installed across the US, including the Leadership Development Center of the YWCA in Phoenix, Arizona and the Michael J. McGivney Center for Cancer Care of the Hospital of St. Raphael's, in New Haven in 1993. She created a bronze sculpture in 1995 for the Brennan Center for Justice in New York City, which was presented to former Justice Brennan of the US Supreme Court by his law clerks. Mrs. Lapides was an active leader in the arts community. She motivated countless others to actively connect with New Haven's leading arts organizations. As President of the O.C. Marsh Fellows program, Mrs. Lapides entertained the crowd as she introduced the monthly speakers. Over five decades, she served as a member of the Boards of the Arts Council of Greater New Haven, Creative Arts Workshop, Yale Art Gallery Associates and the New Haven Symphony Auxiliary and she was also a fellow of Branford College at Yale. Ruth delighted in helping to plan spectacular galas on behalf of many New Haven arts organizations. She was also politically active. She was a founding member of the Women's Grassroots Committee of The Aluminum Association, Inc., of Washington, D.C. in 1977, and Secretary and Vice-Chairperson of the North Haven Parks Commission from 1960 to 1966. Mrs. Lapides was a member of the North Haven League of Women's Voters where she also served on the Board of Directors from 1960 to 1975 and she served as President of the Democratic Women's Club of North Haven during the 1970s. Mrs. Lapides adored flowers, especially orchids. Her spectacular garden included rare and unusual plants. But most of all, she was thoughtful and generous, sending her love with gifts of flowers on any and all occasions. Mrs. Lapides is survived by her loving children and their spouses, John Lapides and his wife Melanie Ginter of New Haven and their children Natalie and Harrison, James Lapides and his wife Michelle of Brookline, MA, and Susan Lapides and her husband Peter Wilson and their children Sofia and Xia of Cambridge, MA. The funeral service will be held Sunday, February 13 at 1:30pm at Congregation Mishkan Israel, Hamden, CT. Memorial contributions may be made to Congregation Mishkan Israel, 785 Ridge Road, Hamden, CT 06517, the Art's Council of Greater New Haven, 70 Audubon Street, 2nd Floor, New Haven, CT 06510, the Creative Arts Workshop, 80 Audubon Street, New Haven, CT 06510 or the charity of your choice.

While Republican leaders say they hope to avoid a market-shaking crisis, many conservatives in the party are insisting on using the issue as leverage to extract big if unspecified concessions from President Obama, leaving Wall Street concerned and even some Democrats wondering if the White House is in for a more dangerous fight than it anticipates."

2011-02-12T00:00:00Z,"Back when the Wayne Shorter Quartet made its first tour, in 2001, it sometimes gave the impression of holding back. It seemed infinitely elastic, as if its members could theoretically push the music far into abstraction and still make sense but that they preferred to work within limits. The group -- Mr. Shorter on tenor and soprano saxophone, Danilo Pérez on piano, John Patitucci on bass, Brian Blade on drums -- hungrily and sympathetically explored Mr. Shorter's compositions, and set a high level of collective improvisation. But it was Mr. Shorter's show, and the rhythm section elevated his individual presence and performance, his unpredictable phrases and vulnerable shouts. If you felt good about Wayne Shorter, you were seeing him get what he deserved."

2011-02-12T00:00:00Z,"The woman I was sharing a taxi with the other night, after a dinner party, told me that she would rather report from a high-risk combat zone than do what I do for a living. This, by the way, is a quintessentially urban woman who values highly her creature comforts. So what she was saying to me was that theater was, to her, a form of unspeakable torture. Mercifully, I can say that I am more familiar with the happy kind of showstopper than its opposite. But in the past couple of weeks I have experienced two instances of bummer showstoppers, though with different reactions. The first was at the Theater at St. Clements Church, where the Red Bull Theater was performing the seldom-seen Jacobean drama ''The Witch of Edmonton.'' An early scene involves two fathers coming to an agreement that their son and daughter should be married. The dialogue was exchanged with credible naturalness when suddenly one of the actors seemed to go blank."

2011-02-12T00:00:00Z,"The going rate for your thoughts used to be a penny. Now the producers of the Broadway musical ''Spider-Man: Turn Off the Dark'' are offering $60 goodie bags to people who serve in focus groups that will respond to several performances. Two focus groups attended Thursday night's performance, and four more are scheduled to be at Friday night's show and the Saturday matinee. It's not unheard of for Broadway producers to use focus groups, and the musical has used them before since preview performances began on Nov. 28. But these are the first since largely negative reviews of the show by theater critics across the country were published on Tuesday. OnTrack Research, a marketing and consulting firm, is coordinating the focus groups, and here's the rub: participants only get to see Act I or Act II, not both. They are then asked to fill out surveys and join in discussions in a ''V.I.P. room.'' The details of the focus groups were outlined in an e-mail to participants from OnTrack Research. Here is the full e-mail, which a focus group participant passed along and which was authenticated by the production on Friday.

2011-02-12T00:00:00Z,"Three months after Yale University and the government of Peru announced a tentative accord under which Yale would return a group of artifacts excavated at Machu Picchu, Yale formally signed a partnership agreement on Friday with a Peruvian university to establish a joint center where the objects will be conserved, studied and displayed. The center will be at the Universidad Nacional de San Antonio Abad del Cusco, in Cusco, the city closest to Machu Picchu, and will be called the U.N.S.A.A.C.-Yale International Center for the Study of Machu Picchu and Inca Culture. It will include a museum exhibition space; a storage site for the archeological artifacts, which include stone tools, ceramics and human and animal bones; and a laboratory and research area. Students and faculty members from Yale are expected to visit the center for training, research projects and field work; students and faculty members of the Peruvian university will also visit Yale. Meanwhile, a small number of artifacts will be loaned to Yale for display at the Yale Peabody Museum of Natural History. The agreement ends a long-running cultural-patrimony dispute over the artifacts, which were excavated in 1912 by a Yale explorer, Hiram Bingham, and have resided at Yale since then. For years, Peru has said the objects were only on loan to Yale and should long since have been returned. Yale argued that it had returned all borrowed objects in the 1920s, and had full title to the rest. In 2008, Peru sued Yale in federal court, and last year it threatened to file criminal charges against the university."

Stanton was soon calling Abraham Lincoln ""the original gorilla"" and joking that Du Chaillu was a fool to have gone to Africa for what he could as easily have found in Springfield, Ill.But the more common way to deal with our resemblance to monkeys and apes then was to fob it off onto other ethnic groups - typically black people, or sometimes the Irish.  A few white scientists even purported to find physiological evidence, in the configuration of the skull, for classifying other races as separate species, not quite as far removed as Caucasians from our primate cousins.  This undercurrent of scientific racism would play out to devastating effect in Du Chaillu's own life."

2011-02-13T14:15:08Z,"Derek Lam's last few collections have been tailored and somewhat minimalist, the type of clothing that often gets paired with a nearly nude face and natural waves on the runway. But Lam hasn't shied away from making beauty statements: most recently, the electric coral eyeliner and '60s waves for spring 2011 created by the hairstylist Orlando Pita and the makeup artist Tom Pecheux, both of whom were on hand early on this Sunday morning to work that magic again. ""The collection today is inspired by uniforms, so I did this school-girl uniform hairstyle, where the girl scrapes her hair back and puts a barrette in her hair,"" explained Pita. ""But we're not doing the barrette, to keep it a bit more streamlined."" The hair was straightened with a T3 iron, pulled into a clean half-ponytail and set with T3 Control Hairspray. Pecheux created a slate gray smoky eye using silver and black Estee Lauder shadows (available this fall), which he paired with a nude matte lipstick, brow pencil, and Estée Lauder Bronze Goddess Soft Duo Bronzer. ""Derek Lam's clothes are very feminine and very luxurious, but very graphic and minimal at the same time,"" said Pecheux, a sentiment that was echoed by the manicure Jin Soon Choi paired it with. ""It's a wintery white from Estée Lauder called Porcelain - very clean, minimalistic, bright white,"" she said. ""White nail polish works on short to medium length nails, and I did a round shape - I've done it at a lot of shows, it's more feminine."""

The show was a pleasure to watch. He had a variety of jackets: a smoky-blue wool peacoat, a trim bomber that combined ebony beaver and black nylon. And he paired them with sharp-looking trousers with a wide stripe down the side or, say, a pencil skirt in a nubby black-white-wine tweed."

She was filling in on sound byte duty for Paul Hanlon, the show's key hairstylist, who was busy presiding over the swarm of stylists - three per girl - busy scraping hair back from the face, dousing it in product (chief among them Frederic Fekkai Coiff Bouffant Lifting & Texturizing Spray Gel), clipping it into twists and coils, and setting with a blow-dryer. ""When the clips come out, they're going to start to destroy [the shapes] by pulling out pieces to make it more 3-D,"" said Outen. ""When [the models] are in the line, Paul's going to do his magic."" In between, the makeup artist Tom Pecheux painted on a glamorous take on the '90s Kate Moss cat-eye. ""I was like, what is a young designer like? Who does he want to dress? And which kind of woman wants to wear a cool young designer? A rock chick,"" said Pecheux. His take replaced that ""rock chick"" staple, black liquid liner, with M.A.C. Rich Purple Chromagraphic Pencil on the eye's waterline and M.A.C. Keep It Cool Eye Shadow (available fall 2011), used to a soft liner effect, brushed out to the brows. ""I went for silver on the inner corner of the eye, almost like a futuristic tear."" And the crimson lip? ""It's a huge controversy! Because that lip color is so ladylike, so bourgeois,"" said Pecheux with a laugh. ""But I was like, why not break the rules? A rock chick is a rock chick."""

Saturday's ""S.N.L."" included the above fake commercial for a law firm that specializes in winning settlements for audience members who have been injured by the show (including a certain Irish rock star who's sustained irreparable damage to his reputation).

The hair stylist Kevin Ryan agreed backstage, explaining that ""these men are not perfect, these are real men with flaws."" To create a ""disheveled, slept-in feel,"" Ryan first liberally applied Bumble & Bumble Surf Spray and Sumo Tech to create a matte, dry texture, then used his own R Session Tool ""Root Control,"" a ceramic heated comb, ideal for taming frizz and flyaway strands. And since the overall goal was to ""make hair look rough and not too groomed,"" styles were finished with spritzes of TIGI Rockaholic Dirty Secret Dry Conditioner. For mysterious, sultry eyes, the makeup artist James Kaliardos used M.A.C. Satin Taupe and Charcoal Brown eye shadows and M.A.C. Brush #213, which ""created a smoky eye without looking like sharp eyeliner."" Kaliardos then pressed M.A.C.'s Brit Wit Creme Blush into models' lips and cheeks, and patted M.A.C. Line Filler all over the face to minimize pores and even out complexion. Forgoing foundation altogether, Kaliardos used concealer minimally, to ""veil the skin"" and not disguise individual imperfections."

2011-02-13T00:00:00Z,"TOWNIES The most surreal -- or perhaps just confusing -- aspect of my new work space is the quietude. At my old job at Harper's Magazine, people would congregate in the hallways kibitzing about books and politics, swapping gossip and jokes. When deadlines loomed everyone retreated to their offices to complete their tasks when no one was looking, as if hard work was a vaguely unstylish matter best left to the imagination. But here at Green Desk, a ''virtual office'' space in the Dumbo neighborhood of Brooklyn, conversation is démodé. Most of the folks here work at jobs that have been represented to me -- a forced refugee from print publishing -- as exciting, borderline sexy and bristling with restless Web 2.0 energy: Bloggers! Graphic designers! An Internet radio station with enough listeners that its D.J. can afford an office! Yet they all seem content to spend the day tapping away at their laptops in utter silence, the only aural distraction the low-tone hum of whichever indie rock anthem leaks from their headphones. That I find all this disconcerting marks me as a newcomer. But that's a role I'm ready to embrace. The newness-which-isn't-surrealism is important to me, and I intend to maintain it even if it requires contriving ways to stay confused. It reinforces the knowledge that my old job is over, and now I must immerse myself fully in this new one -- as a full-time writer at work on a book rather than a full-time editor trying to write a book at night."

Kane was an alternate captain for Nicklas Lidstrom's team, not Eric Staal's. The article gave the incorrect context for a quotation by Toews and included several words not spoken by Toews. He said: ''I was halfway up the steps right here. I am kind of shocked and disappointed right now.'' That referred to his reaction when Kane chose their Chicago teammate Duncan Keith instead of him in the second round. Toews was not referring to the first-round pick by Staal's team, Carolina goalie Cam Ward. Toews did not begin his comment by saying, ''When he said 'my boy,' I was halfway up the steps right here.'' The phrase ''When he said 'my boy''' was spoken by the show's host, who asked Toews: ''When Kaner said, 'my boy,' did you start to stand up?'' And before choosing Toews, Lidstrom's team selected Dustin Byfuglien, who played for the Blackhawks last season -- not the current Blackhawk Patrick Sharp."

''It is good to see museums going through the effort to credit the artists for their creativity. Artists have signed their names to their art and craft pieces since writing began. When I read the name of the artist next to the piece that he or she created, for that moment that person is being remembered, the inspiration being passed on to me, no matter when he or she died.''"
2011-02-13T00:00:00Z,"BLASHKO--Abe, 90, artist and political satirist, died on January 13 from complications of pneumonia. Born to Marx and Esther Blashko, pre-deceased by sister Rebecca and brother Leo, he is survived by his sister Sara Alchermes, her daughter Adria and two grandnieces. Born and raised in Seattle, WA, Abe began his professional career in 1938 with a one-man exhibit of twenty-five drawings at the Seattle Art Museum (SAM). Kenneth Callahan of the Seattle Post Intelligencer noted in his review that Abe's drawings were fully developed, remarkable for a young man only 18 years old. Tall and very slim, he still managed to hold a job on the Seattle docks as a longshoreman during the Depression while continuing his artwork. In 1943, he moved to New York City finally landing in Paramount Studios as an animator, eventually moving into the commercial art world. Keenly aware of the continuing struggles of the working class and atrocities of WWII, he published cartoons in progressive magazines and newspapers. He was affiliated with various galleries, most recently (1987) with the Susan Teller Gallery where in June 2010, he had a seventy-five year retrospective. His work is in many private collections throughout the United States and abroad and in many permanent public and university museum collections. In a recent letter to Patricia Junker, curator at SAM, Abe explained what inspired his drawings and lithographs: ""The turbulent social and political events of the 1930s were major contributors to my early development of a point of view. I was able to feel the pulse of that period and was fascinated with the faces and activities of the people around me, a fascination with their work, play, determination, strength, greed and evil."" On Saturday, 29 January, family and friends gathered at the Susan Teller Gallery to view Abe's work and to offer him a toast for enriching their lives. No one will forget Abe's genius, his talent, and his formidable wit."

He cast several glances my way before offering me two sandwiches from his plastic Conway bag. If I hadn't already had dinner plans, I might have taken him up on his tuna fish. After an exhausting decade of dating in New York, I was grateful for any offer that came my way. My once lofty list of must-haves had been whittled down to: ''clean; ability to hold conversation a plus.'' Once I realized the man was hitting on me (either that, or he thought I was also homeless, which, being between apartments, I technically was), I, too, sized him up. He had a good frame under the layers of coats, and after a shave, a shower and some laundered clothes, he could pass for a handsomer Quentin Tarantino. I found myself lamenting the man's unrealized potential as well as the rigidity of my two-item list."

Hubschman, who had a distinguished career in law, government and business, died of cancer at the age of 63 in his Greenwich, Connecticut home on February 9, 2011. He was revered by all as a person of the highest intellect, character and integrity, as a caring and steadfast friend, and as a loving and devoted husband and father who put his family first. His boundless energy, insatiable curiosity, bed-rock authenticity, deep compassion, wry humor, natural leadership and commitment to the public interest made him an exemplar in both his professional and personal life and earned him profound respect, admiration and love from all who knew him. Henry was born in Newark, New Jersey on August 12, 1947, the son of Morris and Esther (Weissmann). On June 9, 1985, he married Joanne L. Goode, and their marriage of 25 years was marked by strong mutual support, the shared joy of raising their four children and Joanne's selfless care-giving in the last years of Henry's life. They took special pleasure in hosting friends and family at their summer home on Martha's Vineyard. He is survived by Joanne, his two daughters, Lilly and Josie, his two sons, Ellis and Nathan, as well as his sister, Susan Wainberg, and his nephews, Jonathan (wife Sarah) and Zev (wife Cara) Wainberg. As a father, he had high expectations for his children's service to society but also was committed to helping them find their own lodestar and chart their own course. Henry graduated summa cum laude from Rutgers University in 1969 and magna cum laude from Harvard Law School in 1973, the same year in which he received a Master's in Public Policy from Harvard's Kennedy School of Government. He was a law clerk to Judge Frank Murray of the U.S. District Court for Massachusetts from 1973-74. He was an associate (1974-77 and 1979-80) and then a nationally recognized litigation partner (1980-1992) at the law firm of Fried, Frank, Harris, Shriver and Jacobson in Washington, D.C. He was Executive Assistant and invaluable advisor to Patricia Roberts Harris, the Secretary of the Department of Housing and Urban Development, from 1977-79, and served on the board of directors of the Federal National Mortgage Association from 1979-81. Following his outstanding service in law and government, he became General Counsel of GE Aircraft Engines in 1992, where he was a lawyer, counselor and leader beloved by the global leadership both of GEAE and the parent company, GE. In 1997, he became the President and CEO of GE Capital Aviation Services, the commercial aircraft financing and leasing business of GE (and a unit of GE Capital). He enjoyed remarkable global success, growing the company to a fleet of 1800 aircraft placed with nearly 250 airlines in over 75 countries. Under his leadership, the company's aircraft assets grew from $10 billion to $49 billion, making it the largest aircraft leasing business in the world. It had offices in 25 cities across the globe and offered productivity solutions as well as aircraft finance to the world's airlines. Henry has been widely recognized as one of the aviation industry's outstanding leaders, enjoying unqualified respect from his customers and his competitors. Henry served as Chairman of GE Capital Aviation Services from 2009 until his retirement earlier this year. He has served as a director of the GE Fund and the Jewish Federation of Greenwich. He was an avid reader and tennis player who enjoyed talking for hours with his friends about law and government, business and global developments, books and movies---and sharing an occasional bit of political gossip.

2011-02-13T00:00:00Z,"ALERT taxpayers can give themselves a tax cut by taking advantage of the many opportunities that Congress has put into the nation's tax code, just as this hypothetical New York suburban couple have done. This sample return was prepared by Jan M. Rosen of The New York Times in consultation with Bob Meighan, vice president of TurboTax, the tax software evening job, which he hopes will be temporary. Their biggest source of income is Felicity's salary, $71,000, as reported on Box 1 of her W-2. That, along with Samuel's salary for part-time employment, comes to $102,000 (Line 7). Felic- ity had $5,000 withheld for a tax-deferred 401(k) retirement plan, which shows up on her W-2 form, but not on their tax return. Taxable interest income of $100 is reported on Line 8a. Ordinary dividends of $425 on Line 9a include qualified dividends of $325 (Line 9b). Qualified dividends, which include most dividends from domestic stocks and stock-based mutual funds, are taxed like long-term capital gains at 15 percent for most taxpayers. (People in the 10 per- cent and 15 percent income-tax brackets, however, do not have to pay taxes on qualified dividends or capital gains.) These numbers come from the year-end tax statements on Form 1099-DIV, issued by financial institutions. Because they did not have more than $1,500 of either interest or dividends, this couple does not have to file Schedule B. Business income of $34,800 (Line 12, from Schedule C) is what Samuel earned as a consult- ing engineer after office rent and other expenses. Capital gains of $11,872 (Line 13) come from Schedule D. Samuel inherited several stocks from an aunt last year. Having seen their own portfolios wither in the market plunge of 2008, the Taxpay- ers sold the stocks as soon as they received them. system by Intuit. During 2010, our hypothetical couple -- Samuel and Felicity Taxpayer -- used several of those credits. First, they had solar energy panels installed on the roof of their home -- a project that they expect will bring substantial savings on their electric bills. Because solar panels will also help save the environment, Congress authorized a generous tax They are liable for taxes only on the realized gains on the stock sales, not on the value of the inheri- tance itself. They used the proceeds for the solar panels and to pay down credit-card debt, which had grown in the last two tough years. Their total income is $149,197 (Line 22). Next come two adjustments, often called above-the-line deductions. Samuel can deduct half, or $2,459, of his self-employment tax, which is for Social Security and Medicare (Line 27). Employers must pay one-half of those taxes for their employ- ees and can deduct their share, so self-employed people, who pay the entire tax, can deduct half. On Line 31a is $9,000 for alimony that Samuel paid to his first wife, whose Social Security number must be shown. Recipients must report alimony as income on Line 11. The couple's adjusted gross income is $137,738 (Line 37). After itemized deductions of $22,710 (Line 40, from Schedule A) and four personal exemp- tions worth $14,600 (Line 42), the couple's taxable income is $100,428 (Line 43). The program, using the most advantageous method allowed by the tax code, not the tax tables, calculated the regular tax as $16,249 (Line 44). An enormous complication in the tax code is that taxpayers are required to calculate their regu- lar tax, then calculate the alternative minimum tax, which denies personal exemptions and certain other tax breaks, notably the deduction for state and local taxes, and pay whichever is higher. Line Schedule D: Capital Gains and Losses Asset sales last year that resulted in a capital gain or loss are reported on Schedule D. Samuel sold the 200 shares each of five stocks that he inherited from his aunt. Because the value of all five stocks rose between the time of his aunt's death -- in March 2009 -- and last year, when he received and sold the shares, he has capital gains. The net gains of $11,872 are entered on Line 15. Incidentally, all gains on inheritances are treated as long term. The cost in Column (e) normally includes brokerage fees and charges, but in this case, it is simply the value on the day his aunt died. The sale price in Column (d) is calculated after brokerage fees and charges are deduct- ed. Long-term gains on stocks and stock-based mutual funds are taxed at 15 percent for people in the 25, 28, 33 and 35 percent brackets, but are tax- free for those in the 10 and 15 percent brackets. credit, which will reduce this family's taxes by $7,500. They were also able to claim education credits for their son and the ''making work pay'' credit. The interview format of tax software can greatly ease the preparation of a return and help filers, even those who know little about tax law, find the tax breaks to which they are entitled. The program selects the best options for a particular return, fills out the forms and does the calculations. TurboTax can even download many W-2 and 1099 forms that report income. An expanded version of the sample return and commentary is at nytimes.com/taxes."

2011-02-13T00:00:00Z,"ON Thursday night, at the start of Fashion Week, several hundred people went to the David Zwirner Gallery on West 19th Street to see an exhibition of Philip-Lorca diCorcia's photographs. Originally published in W magazine from 1997 to 2008, the images are a remarkable record of a free-spirited period in publishing that seemed to end with the recession. They speak directly to the eye of Mr. diCorcia, with its capacity to excite and disturb, and to seek truth about human behavior in the most banal of scenes. The images were also a result of a fortuitous collaboration between Mr. diCorcia and Dennis Freedman, then the art director of W, who gave the artist carte blanche to shoot fashion stories in places like Havana, Cairo and New York. They have collected all 11 shoots in a new book, ''Eleven.'' Are they fashion stories? In a way, yes, though you rarely notice the clothes. They are really about a vacuum in the middle of contemporary life, of which fashion has been a key element. That is one interpretation anyway. I spoke to Mr. diCorcia (or P. L., as he is known) about the work then and now. Young artists should feel gratified when he says of the creative process: ''It's exactly what it's always been. It's just hard work.''"

Or they might know him from his various photo shoots (signés Lagerfeld, of course) or public outings with his septuagenarian mentor, including a memorable St. Tropez trip in the summer of 2010, when Giabiconi and Lagerfeld stopped by a local newsstand, dressed to the nines and trailed by hordes of paparazzi and curious tourists. But being the male face for Chanel, Fendi and Karl Lagerfeld (as well as starring in a Coca-Cola Light campaign) is apparently not enough for the slightly cross-eyed little Corsican that could; in late 2010 Giabiconi also embarked on a singing career and released his first single, ""Showtime."" Even though the song has been out for a few months and enjoyed considerable chart success in France, it's gone largely unnoticed by the American public. Granted, under normal circumstances the epic video (above) accompanying the release of the heavily auto-tuned single would not be considered kitsch; its Wild West theme, with Giabiconi saving a bodacious brunette from her abusive boyfriend, complete with explosive super powers in the Californian desert, is pop video cliché at its best. And Giabiconi's English (""Woz wrong wiz you, man?"") is certainly better than Lady Gaga's French. But the fact that it has Karl Lagerfeld's blessing and the remote possibility of him doing a special cameo as a Bond-style villain makes it all the more enjoyable. That sadly doesn't happen, but then again, Giabiconi knows how to keep us on our toes: the video ends with a promising ""To be Continued."""

2011-02-14T16:35:20Z,"The Miami Heat of last season were equal parts depressing and inspiring. The Heat roster (Dwyane Wade aside) was limited, and as a result, Jermaine O'Neal and Michael Beasley became the pillars on which Miami was forced to stand. Their season wasn't one of disaster, merely of reality; although the Heat had the league's sixth-best defense, they lacked competent offensive players to produce consistently or distract defenses away from Wade."

Forsberg will never show up in a lot of all-time great lists because his career was hampered by injuries, but those who watched him in his prime can recount tales of one of the most gifted players on the planet.

For his fall collection, Reid said backstage, ""My focus was on construction, a lot of tailoring. I spent an inordinate amount of time perfecting each piece. My men's looks are cleaner, with more subtle details than before."" In line with Reid's penchant for individuality, the hairstylist Marcos Diaz created looks that were ""groomed but not Don Draper."" Using just the newly launched Mat Forming Ground from Davines (a supermatte clay) and his fingers, Diaz formed a natural-looking side part and left the rest of the hair ""dry-looking and clean."" Emphasizing approachability, Diaz said, ""I'm interested in keeping hair more realistic, something you could easily create at home."" The makeup artist Nadine Luke relied on a few key players from M.A.C. and her belief of ""a little goes a long way"" for men's makeup. Luke hydrated skin with Studio Moisture Fix, concealed as necessary, moisturized lips with Lip Conditioner, and tamed unruly brows with Brow Set (which she considers a guy's ""secret weapon,"" as it instantly grooms both brows and mustaches). Luke finished the look with Mineralize Skinfinish, a shimmer-free bronzer that contours and provides a matte finish in a pinch, noting that ""Billy Reid's guy is someone you wouldn't imagine grooming because he's slightly rugged. But really, he's a polished gentleman.""Runway slide show"

Haute and Naughty Mascara only on outer lashes, M.A.C. Eye Gloss on lids and M.A.C. Blush in Angel on the cheeks. ""On the lips we're using a new [M.A.C.] color called Prince Noir, and we're applying it with a lip brush and then blotting it with tissue so it gives a really beautiful stained burgundy look,"" Kendal said.

The hairstylist Orlando Pita, who took the ""big, beautiful necklines"" into account when creating his polished, rolled bun-chignon hybrid using Moroccanoil products, clearly also had the Carolina Herrera client in mind.

Previously, Mr. Hawass had only said that objects were damaged. Among the most important of the missing items are a limestone statue of the god Akhenaten holding an offering table and a gilded wooden statue of Tutankhamen being carried by a goddess. On Monday, however, CNN reported that 2 of the 18 objects - a heart scarab and a funerary statuette of the nobleman Yuya - had been found on museum grounds. Mr. Hawass also said that a storeroom at Dahshur was broken into on Saturday night. He told Ahram Online that eight amulets were missing.

For the past several years, Smith - who grew up in New York, has a gently soulful voice and prefers to be called simply ""Xavier"" (""with a hard X,"" he notes, ""like Ex-ayvier"") - has produced a Valentine's song as a love letter to his friends, fans and whomever he might have been in love with that year. It started in 2004 with a cover of the Beatles' ""In My Life,"" and this year's offering is a heartbreaking rendition of Curtis Mayfield's ""The Makings of You"" set to a small orchestral arrangement.

To inspire us, last night was one of the music world's biggest nights: the Grammy Awards. All you have to do now is to pick the right songs - today's digital musical players and smartphones make it a snap to select them from your playlist to suit every mood. But what if you were stuck with a player that (thanks to Apple's marketing genius) makes a virtue of randomness, like the iPod shuffle? This is the conundrum that gives rise to a fascinating puzzle contributed by Dion Wong of Australia. Previously, in When Randomness Produces Certainty, we saw how randomness acting over and over can create order. The question that arises in Dion's puzzle is: How can we optimally combine randomness and order? It's a fitting question for today because, no matter how orderly a plan you might have made for a perfect Valentine's Day, randomness might just intervene. And the connection of randomness to the Grammy Awards ceremony is clear too - what random pattern of clothes (or what passes for them) did Lady Gaga wear? That might take us too far afield, so without further ado, here's the puzzle."

""There was a sense of uniformity about the way that they were dressing."" This translated into a collection he described as ""electric,"" and for the hair and makeup, Panichgual said he decided to go for bold instead of tempering the clothes with a basic look. The makeup artist Diane Kendal used Nars Velvet Matte Lip Pencil in Dragon Girl on eyelids and on top of it, and applied three blushes - Desire, Taj Mahal and Exhibit A, in that order from inner lid to outer lid to an ombre effect - which she blended out past the bleached eyebrows. ""We wanted to have that feeling of sun and hotness but then also exotic,"" Kendal explained. The hairstyle created by Odile Gilbert using Kerastase products echoed that sentiment, with pieces provided by the designer weaved into a complicated-looking updo. Panichgual explained, ""The hair is superslick - almost posh, really - in the front, and then it's pulled back and it's got this weird chignon whipped up with yarn and hats that we've cut up and put into the bun.

This is the best way the writers could think of for Alby's getting back at Bill for getting Lura away from him? Even as the scene was transpiring it seemed as if the writers were doing it on a lark and were fully conscious that the plotting was arbitrary and almost jokey. (The jaunty music accompanying the attack made this especially clear.)Also: Bill's mother's dementia isn't feeling fully integrated either. Her dementia may be relevant to the season's theme of the Henricksons' general deterioration, but beyond that symbolic value, it's hard to see how Lois's condition will matter much to the final outcome of the show. Another plot development that felt half-baked was the sudden turnaround of Bill's fate at the legislature. The tabling of the impeachment felt way too abrupt."

The series, which chronicles a fanciful, not-all-that-alternate-from-reality version of the slacker paradise of Portland, Ore. (and which gave rise to hit viral videos like ""Dream of the '90s"" ), has become a modest hit for IFC. The cable channel, which has been emphasizing a lineup of new and classic comedy programs alongside its schedule of independent films, said the first three episodes of ""Portlandia"" have been viewed by 1.1 million total viewers, with most of them in the 18-49 age group that recognizes the grunge bands referenced on the show and the cameo appearances by Kyle MacLachlan and Aimee Mann. IFC said the second season of ""Portlandia,"" consisting of 10 half-hour episodes, will make its debut in January."

''Even the most ardent admirers of the Xolo concede that the dog is plug-ugly,'' Guy Trebay wrote in The New York Times. ''One description of this hairless canine of ancient lineage, a national treasure in its native Mexico, characterizes the Xolo as a hot-water bottle with pig eyes, bat ears and a rat tail. That is being polite.'' The judging begins on this opening night with the hound, toy, nonsporting and herding groups. Coverage begins on the USA Network before moving to CNBC from 9 to 11 p.m. Sporting, working and terrier groups, followed by best in show, will be judged on Tuesday from 8 to 11 p.m. on USA.

In a joint statement with Mr. Muti and officials of the orchestra, two cardiologists at the Northwestern University Feinberg School of Medicine, Donald Lloyd-Jones and Bradley P. Knight, reported on Friday that Mr. Muti had fainted because of ''a common heart rhythm disturbance.'' Although their tests reveal that he retains excellent heart function, they added, he has had a pacemaker installed to monitor his heart rhythm and deliver a small electrical charge if the heart rate should fall too low. ''Patients with pacemakers live full and active lives with excellent prognosis,'' the doctors concluded. Mr. Muti remains in Northwestern Memorial Hospital, where he is recovering from surgery for facial injuries incurred in the fall. He has canceled his remaining performances this winter, which were to run through Feb. 19. His next scheduled appearance with the orchestra is a concert performance of Verdi's opera ''Otello'' on April 7, to be repeated twice in Chicago and, on April 15, in Carnegie Hall.

But an election year looms, as does the return of ""Gore Vidal's The Best Man,"" the deliciously tart (when done well) play about politics, campaigns and the presidency. Jeffrey Richards and his fellow producers announced on Tuesday that they would revive that 1960 play in the spring of 2012 with hopes of catching election fever. Originally titled ""The Best Man,"" Mr. Vidal's play involves a showdown at a presidential convention between two candidates, in essence an Adlai Stevenson character and a Richard Nixon type, brokered by an ill ex-president and complicated by secrets, machinations, and troubled marriages. Broadway had a revival of ""The Best Man"" not so long ago, during the campaign between George W. Bush and Al Gore and the subsequent legal battle in the fall of 2000. With political resonance and a cast led by Spalding Gray, Chris Noth, and Charles Durning, that production started off strong at the box office but had mixed reviews and declining ticket sales before closing in late December. (Mr. Gore had conceded two and a half weeks earlier.) That 2000 revival was the first Broadway producing credit for Mr. Richards, who has been a press agent since the 1970s and is now one of Broadway's busiest producers. He is reuniting his producing team from 2000 - Jerry Frankel, Michael B. Rothfeld, and Darren Bagert - to mount this production. The director will be Michael Wilson (""The Orphans' Home Cycle,"" ""Dividing the Estate""). No cast members have been announced."

The award, which is to be given annually, provides $50,000 to the writer and $100,000 toward the production costs for mounting the recipient's play. Mr. Talbott's winning play, ""The Submission,"" described as an exploration of the importance of cultural authenticity in authorship, will be produced next season at MCC Theater, which is led by Robert LuPone, Bernard Telsey, and William Cantler. The Laurents/Hatcher Foundation Award is among the most generous in playwriting, and it is intended for emerging writers. Mr. Talbott, 46, has written only a few plays and, as a playwright, still lacks an agent. Mr. Laurents, the book writer for ""Gypsy"" and ""West Side Story"" and the Tony Award-winning director of the original ""La Cage aux Folles,"" created the award last year.

Among the most important of the missing items are a limestone statue of the god Akhenaten holding an offering table and a gilded wooden statue of Tutankhamen being carried by a goddess. On Monday, however, CNN reported that 2 of the 18 objects - a heart scarab and a funerary statuette of the nobleman Yuya - had been found on museum grounds. Mr. Hawass also said that a storeroom at Dahshur was broken into on Saturday night. He told Ahram Online that eight amulets were missing. Meanwhile, there were accounts on Twitter of protests outside the offices of the Supreme Council of Antiquities, the government body run by Mr. Hawass, who was appointed by former President Hosni Mubarak.

The series, which chronicles a fanciful, not-all-that-alternate-from-reality version of the slacker paradise of Portland, Ore. (and which gave rise to hit viral videos like ''Dream of the '90s'' ), has become a modest hit for IFC. The cable channel, which has been emphasizing a lineup of new and classic comedy programs alongside its schedule of independent films, said the first three episodes of ''Portlandia'' have been viewed by 1.1 million total viewers, with most of them in the 18-49 age group that recognizes the grunge bands referenced on the show and the cameo appearances by Kyle MacLachlan and Aimee Mann.

2011-02-15T00:00:00Z,"Scientist at Work Roland Kays, curator of mammals at the New York State Museum, is comparing the behavior of fishers (cousins of the weasel) in urban and wild settings. He posted at nytimes.com /scientistatwork. The members of the weasel family, Mustelidae, are built for running in tubes, with short legs and skinny, flexible bodies. This evolved as an adaptation to pursue prey into holes in the ground, but is now helping fishers colonize suburban forests. Carnivores require larger areas to survive than herbivores. This has traditionally kept them out of urban environments, because the remaining forest fragments simply weren't large enough to support them. Using high-resolution GPS, we have been tracking an animal called Phineas, who shows the fisher's solution to this problem: linking small forest fragments with a series of corridors. Using tubes under roads is a critical adaptation to help fishers use these forests without getting hit by cars. On the map at movebank.org, you'll see a few places where Phineas has repeatedly crossed roads in the same place. I visited four of these and found his tracks in the snow -- going through drainage culverts at three, and over the road at the fourth. Other animals were using these same strips of natural habitat, but were not able to fit through the culverts. Deer and coyote tracks showed that these animals had to risk their lives to cross the road, while Phineas and his fisher friends take the safer low road underneath. The New Old Age Karen Stabiner posted at nytimes.com/newoldage. My widowed father-in-law didn't tell anyone about his symptoms -- not his doctor and not his grown son, who found out only when a member of the extended family called to say my husband needed to fly across the country immediately to see his dad. By that point, the kidney cancer that would have been easy to treat if detected early had passed the fail-safe point. My father-inlaw was not the kind of guy who liked to depend on people, so he made sure he had to for only a very short time before he died. He was an extreme example of a familiar dynamic, which Deborah Tannen, a professor of linguistics at Georgetown University, calls ''the guy's view.'' Dr. Tannen, the author of seven books about how we communicate with one another, says many older men consider keeping difficult information to themselves a badge of courage. In this view, it's what men are supposed to do to keep from upsetting the womenfolk. That was what my father-inlaw ended up doing. My husband, deprived of the opportunity to help his father with a problem, instead helped him deal with its consequences. He showed up on his father's Philadelphia doorstep with no agenda but to do whatever his father allowed him to do -- which became more and more as the weeks went by. Eventually his father realized that it was possible to ask for and accept assistance without feeling like an obligation.

2011-02-15T00:00:00Z,"''Spider-Man: Turn Off the Dark'' had strong tickets sales last week, despite the fallout from largely terrible reviews, according to the first slice of box-office data to be released since critics weighed in on Tuesday before the oft-delayed show's official opening. ''Spider-Man'' grossed $1,330,014, an increase of almost 3 percent over the previous week, and was the second-highest-grossing show on Broadway behind the musical ''Wicked,'' which grossed $1.44 million for the same number of performances as ''Spider-Man.'' Ticket sales for the $65 million ''Spider-Man'' hardly collapsed in the face of critical evisceration (the New York Times and Washington Post theater critics both called it one of the worst musicals in history), but the show's grosses went up minimally in an otherwise robust week on Broadway. Top-grossing musicals like ''Wicked,'' '' The Lion King'' and ''Mary Poppins'' were up 15 to 20 percent in grosses from the prior week, compared to the 3 per cent increase for ''Spider-Man.''"

2011-02-16T00:00:00Z,"Are the Iowa presidential caucuses really less than a year away? How time flies. But an election year looms, as does the return of ''Gore Vidal's The Best Man,'' the deliciously tart (when done well) play about politics, campaigns and the presidency. Jeffrey Richards and his fellow producers announced on Tuesday that they would revive that 1960 play in the spring of 2012 with hopes of catching election fever. Originally titled ''The Best Man,'' Mr. Vidal's play involves a showdown at a presidential convention between two candidates, in essence an Adlai Stevenson character and a Richard Nixon type, brokered by an ill ex-president and complicated by secrets, machinations, and troubled marriages. Broadway had a revival of ''The Best Man'' not so long ago, during the campaign between George W. Bush and Al Gore and the subsequent legal battle in the fall of 2000. With political resonance and a cast led by Spalding Gray, Chris Noth, and Charles Durning, that production started off strong at the box office but had mixed reviews and declining ticket sales before closing in late December. (Mr. Gore had conceded two and a half weeks earlier.) That 2000 revival was the first Broadway producing credit for Mr. Richards, who has been a press agent since the 1970s and is now one of Broadway's busiest producers. He is reuniting his producing team from 2000 - Jerry Frankel, Michael B. Rothfeld, and Darren Bagert - to mount this production. The director will be Michael Wilson (''The Orphans' Home Cycle,'' ''Dividing the Estate''). No cast members have been announced. This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print."

Mr. LaChappelle, known for his candy-colored, sexually over-the-top images, claims in a suit filed Monday in federal court in Manhattan that Rihanna helped herself to too many of the images in the recently released video for her sexually over-the-top song ''S & M.'' The suit, which asks for at least $1 million in damages, argues that the video is ''directly derived from and substantially similar to'' photographs he has created and published that show, among other things, a dominatrix walking a chained man on a leash, a woman in latex headgear and another woman (Lady Gaga, to be precise) wearing only screaming headlines. In all, the suit claims, eight of Mr. LaChapelle's images were used to create scenes in the video, which the suit calls a ''willful, wanton and deliberate'' infringement of his copyright protections."

(The Carnegie program was ostensibly supported by an anonymous donor, but that donor was widely known to be Mr. Bloomberg.) The Bloomberg foundation's new arts initiative, which was developed by a consultant, Anita Contini, invited 250 organizations to apply. It requires that grant recipients, small-to-midsized arts groups, to have been operating for at least two years, and that they secure matching funds equal to 20 percent of the grant amount. The grants also come with an arts management training program run by Michael M. Kaiser, the president of the John F. Kennedy Center for the Performing Arts. Ms. Contini told the Journal that city staff had not been involved in the program and the distribution of grants, although the foundation's chief executive is the first deputy mayor, Patricia E. Harris."

The award, which is to be given annually, provides $50,000 to the writer and $100,000 toward the production costs for mounting the recipient's play.

Mr. Laurents, the book writer for ''Gypsy'' and ''West Side Story'' and the Tony Award-winning director of the original ''La Cage aux Folles,'' created the award last year.

One of its highlights is ""Steel and Shade: The Architecture of Donald Wexler,"" an exhibition at the Palm Springs Art Museum. Wexler, 85, has practiced in Palm Springs for almost six decades, developing an architecture that is acutely sensitive to the extremes of the desert climate. Wexler's all-steel Alexander houses, designed in 1962 with the structural engineer Bernard Perlin for the developers George and Robert Alexander, were sustainable before sustainability was trendy. Affordable, elegant and quick to assemble on site, thanks to a prefabricated structural system, Wexler's houses (their framing, roofs and exterior siding are steel, with drywall interior siding) were the perfect answer to the postwar housing boom. ""Steel, concrete and glass are ideal materials for the desert,"" Wexler says. ""They are inorganic and don't deteriorate in the extreme temperatures of the desert."" And since these structures are relatively maintenance-free, the seven Alexander houses in a north Palm Springs enclave are as pristine today as they were almost 50 years ago."

2011-02-17T10:56:33Z,"Fashion's latest hairstylist darling, the charming Paul Hanlon, knows the Proenza Schouler girl quite well. Last season, he imagined she'd fallen asleep on a bus, and created what was meant to look like a French twist that had been battered by a long day (and a long commute, one assumes). This season, she's grown her hair nearly to her elbows (Hanlon used 22-inch extensions) and pulled it into a low ponytail with some knotty nubs at the end. ""When [designers Jack McCollough and Lazaro Hernandez] called me in London, the first thing they said to me was that they loved the idea of the girls having really long hair. The first test we did, the girls had this really long straight hair, very blunt, but it didn't feel like their woman - it was a bit army,"" said Hanlon, adding that the boys were inspired by a cross-country road trip they'd just been on. As an alternative, Hanlon referenced photographer Edward S. Curtis' portraits of American Indian women, their hair parted in the middle, heavy behind their shoulders. He began a very low braid, which he then tied with a black elastic, leaving the last loop halfway pulled through. After the tips of the hair were razor cut, the entire head was sprayed with Frederic Fekkai Sheer Hold Hairspray (through a net, a favorite Hanlon technique) for some ""crunch."" ""It's like when girls go out and they leave their ponytail tucked into their jackets, and when they take it off it looks kind of wrong. I'm looking around at Diane's assistants,"" Hanlon said, referring to the makeup artist Diane Kendal, ""and some of them walked in with their hair like that. It's nice to have a wearable look. Hairstylists get a bit carried away sometimes."""

2011-02-17T00:00:00Z,"Interboro Partners, a nine-year-old New York architecture firm, has won the annual Young Architects Program competition to transform MoMA P.S. 1's courtyard for its summer outdoor music program, the museum announced Wednesday. The architects took their inspiration from the community around the museum, which is located in Long Island City, Queens, interviewing the proprietors of local businesses and nonprofits about what materials might be of use to them and then incorporating those materials into their design, with the intention of donating them at the end of the summer. ''A lot of the things are commonsensical,'' like benches and a volleyball net, Tobias Armborst, one of the firm's partners, said in a phone interview. Other items-like the large mirrors requested by a local dance school-proved harder to integrate. (Mr. Armborst said the architects are hoping to use them to make a ''little, crazy house of mirrors'' at one end of the courtyard.)"

The looks included sharp double-breasted gray flannel pantsuits, some shown with shearling vests, and clever takes on the navy cable-knit sweaters embroidered with beads. Printed pajamas also looked cool under a cloth coat. Ponchos and capes have been just about everywhere this season, but here there was a cool hybrid variation: wrapped around their necks, two models wore wide scarves that attached with hooks in the back, creating a quasi-poncho. One was lined with a blanket fabric."

A true gentleman and a man of deep character, integrity, and compassion, Carl left the world a better place. He was a legendary businessman whose foresight and innovative leadership created the private equity enterprise before those very words were coined. His strong sense of corporate ethics and social responsibility carried over into an active pro bono and philanthropic life. Carl first became involved with Rockefeller in 1976. He brought vision, astute judgment, and a belief in the promise of basic science to his service as a member of the Council and its Executive Committee. Seven university presidents benefited from his wise counsel and generosity. Carl loved to ask leaders about the projects they dreamed of launching. He would then make the first, critical gift. At Rockefeller he helped create the Center for Studies in Physics & Biology; the stem cell research fund, and the Academic Venture Fund, which provides seed funding for promising scientists conducting high risk, high reward research that does not qualify for government support. Carl was that rare benefactor who never sought public recognition for his gifts. Indeed he much preferred to name initiatives for friends whom he admired. Carl had a gift for friendship, and he enjoyed warm relationships with many Rockefeller scientists. He was adored by the university staff who felt privileged to know a man of such class and distinction. We will miss Carl greatly, and we extend our heartfelt condolences to his cherished wife, Ludmila, also a member of The Rockefeller University Council, and his children, grandchildren, and great-granddaughter; and to the entire Hess family.

2011-02-17T00:00:00Z,"Even as critical features of the landmark health care legislation of March 2010 are being put into place, the battle over reform rages on. House Republicans, whose unified vote for repeal was blocked by Senate Democrats, would now like to bar spending on the law. Meanwhile, President Obama, in a recent speech to the Chamber of Commerce, reminded business executives that ''we could not accept a broken system where insurance companies could drop people because they got sick, or families went bankrupt because of medical bills.'' And of course, the legal challenges continue to wend their way toward the Supreme Court. Health reform, in short, is very much a work in progress. This report--the second in a series--examines that progress on three key dimensions: Roll-Out (Are milestones being met?), Reactions (Are key players cooperating?) and Results (is reform controlling costs of covering Americans?)."

This fall plaids are designers latest nod to men's wear - and we're not talking suits. Thakoon's tribal-inspired cobalt blue and cherry red checkered 18th-century red puffer jacket would be foreign to Gaelic Scots. Similarly, Rag & Bone used a mixed color palette, but also paired neo-traditional houndstooth kilts with tough biker jackets. Some were more direct: Theyskens' Theory delivered plaids exactly how you want and expect them, a little oversized and unbuttoned, as if you threw on your boyfriend's. Conservative looks did resurface, however - patterns woven in maroon, brown and yellow made an appearance at Chris Benz as a simple long smock dress and Altuzarra-fitted trousers. Thankfully, this is one of those brilliant trends that you always have somewhere buried in your closet. Happy hunting."

If A.I.G. did not want to have to accept Goldman's valuations, it could have negotiated a different valuation procedure for the trades. Instead it left itself open to massive liquidity risk by agreeing to the collateral arrangements that it did. A.I.G. never considered the consequences were the underlyings to its trades to become illiquid, nor where it would find the collateral were the trades to go against them. For me that is by far the worst of the behavior seen here."" Deus Ex Macchiato"

His business career led to his becoming a partner in Cresap McCormick & Paget, Management Consultants, and then vice president and director of American Securities Corp. In 1963, Mr. Hess conceived and created a new form of private investment firm which, in 1968, became American Euro pean Associates. Thus began his legendary career as a pioneer in private equity. Known since then as AEA Investors Inc., AEA, initially with financial support and endorsement of S.G. Warburg & Co. and shortly thereafter from senior members of the Rockefeller, Mellon, Harriman, Du Pont and other major families, was the first privately funded organization devoted solely to direct equity investment. From the outset and still today, its ownership and direction has been dominated by the chairmen and chief executive officers of many of America's leading corporations. The firm is now global in its reach with shareholder/participants of the same prominence and achievement in Europe, Asia, South and Central America, and the Middle East. As Chairman Emeritus, Mr. Hess remained active in the firm and was a regular presence in the AEA offices until shortly before his death. Ever loyal to Dartmouth College, he was a member of the Dean's Council and the President's Leadership Council. He was a member of The Rockefeller University Council and served on its Executive Committee. He was also on the Oversight Committee for Preservation of Objects at the Metropolitan Museum. He was predeceased by his beloved brother and friend, John D. Hess. He is survived by: his wife, Ludmila Schwarzenberg Hess; his son, Eric Hess and his daughter-in-law, June Hess; his daughter, Safiya Bonaventura; five grandchildren: Arden Hess Rowland and her husband Walter, and Aram, Joachim and his wife Kisha, Fleur and Claire Williams; one adored great-granddaughter, Wyatt Rowland; two nephews, Anthony and Oliver and his wife Leslie Hess; and two grand-nephews, John and Carl Hess. He is also survived by his first wife, Juliet Forbes. He was predeceased by his second wife, Desanka Pavlu, in 1990. Funeral services will be private. A memorial service will be held on Monday, March 7, 2011 at 4pm at the University Club. Contributions in his memory may be made to the Academic Venture Fund at Dartmouth College or to the Academic Venture Fund at The Rockefeller University."

''Millennium, Stieg and Me'' is a slim memoir published in France, Sweden and Norway last month with a co-author, the French journalist Marie-Francoise Colombani. Ms. Gabrielsson claims that Larsson wrote slightly more than 200 pages of a sequel to his three-part ''Millennium'' series - ''The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo,'' ''The Girl Who Played with Fire'' and ''The Girl Who Kicked the Hornet's Nest'' - shortly before his sudden death in 2004.

2011-02-18T00:00:00Z,"LOS ANGELES- ''Toy Story'' fans, rejoice. Pixar will release two new short films starring Woody and pals by year's end. The first short, ''Hawaiian Vacation,'' will run with ''Cars 2,'' which will arrive in theaters on June 24. Pixar unveiled ''Hawaiian Vacation'' at a gathering of about 300 Disney investors and analysts in Anaheim, Calif., on Thursday. (Barbie and Ken try to stow away with Bonnie for a Hawaiian trip but get left home, to their enormous disappointment; Woody, Buzz and the other toys try to console the pair by improvising an island vibe but . . . it doesn't go well.) The second short - a title was not announced - will run with ''The Muppets,'' a Disney feature film set for a Thanksgiving release. In related Pixar news, Disney announced a direct-to-DVD spin-off of ''Cars,'' with airplanes as the main characters. ''Planes,'' undoubtedly accompanied by related merchandise, will arrive in spring 2013. The movie will focus on Dusty, a small-town dreamer who longs to enter an around-the-world air race despite his fear of heights. ''Phineas and Ferb,'' the Disney Channel cartoon, is also headed to the big screen; Disney said it was in the early stages of developing a ''Phineas and Ferb'' feature that will be a hybrid of live action and animation."

2011-02-18T00:00:00Z,"HESS--Carl B. The Rockefeller University deeply mourns the loss of our beloved friend Carl Hess, a revered member of The Rockefeller University Council for over thirty years. A true gentleman and a man of deep character, integrity, and compassion, Carl left the world a better place. He was a legendary businessman whose foresight and innovative leadership created the private equity enterprise before those very words were coined. His strong sense of corporate ethics and social responsibility carried over into an active pro bono and philanthropic life. Carl first became involved with Rockefeller in 1976. He brought vision, astute judgment, and a belief in the promise of basic science to his service as a member of the Council and its Executive Committee. Seven university presidents benefited from his wise counsel and generosity. Carl loved to ask leaders about the projects they dreamed of launching. He would then make the first, critical gift. At Rockefeller he helped create the Center for Studies in Physics & Biology; the stem cell research fund, and the Academic Venture Fund, which provides seed funding for promising scientists conducting high risk, high reward research that does not qualify for government support. Carl was that rare benefactor who never sought public recognition for his gifts. Indeed he much preferred to name initiatives for friends whom he admired. Carl had a gift for friendship, and he enjoyed warm relationships with many Rockefeller scientists. He was adored by the university staff who felt privileged to know a man of such class and distinction. We will miss Carl greatly, and we extend our heartfelt condolences to his cherished wife, Ludmila, also a member of The Rockefeller University Council, and his children, grandchildren, and great-granddaughter; and to the entire Hess family.

George had popped up entirely from out of the blue. Not once from the very conception of the world's mightiest suspension span had anyone intended to call it the George Washington Bridge. Not once, not over the three decades it took for the pols of New York and New Jersey to decide to build the thing in the first place, not over the several more years that followed the September 1927 groundbreaking, as workers lustily bored and poured and hammered and riveted and strung up cables, was it ever known as anything but the Hudson River Bridge."

2011-02-19T00:00:00Z,"Important archeological sites in Egypt were looted during the antigovernment protests, Egypt's antiquities minister, Zahi Hawass, wrote on his blog on Thursday. The announcement contradicted earlier statements by Mr. Hawass that Egypt's archeological sites were safe. Mr. Hawass wrote that tombs at Saqqara and Abusir and storage buildings at Saqqara and at Cairo University, among other sites, had been broken into. He added that he had formed a committee to determine and report on what objects were missing. Meanwhile, Mr. Hawass's long-running campaign to repatriate Egyptian antiquities is making legal waves in the United States. The Saint Louis Art Museum filed suit this week in an effort to prevent the United States attorney's office in St. Louis from seizing a 3,200-year-old funerary mask that Mr. Hawass has claimed was stolen from Egypt, the blog Looting Matters reported. In its suit, the museum said that the American government had not gathered sufficient evidence that the mask was stolen, and that the statute of limitations had run out on the government's right to seize the mask. The mask was discovered in Saqqara in 1952 by an Egyptian excavator, and Mr. Hawass has said that it was stolen sometime after 1959, when it was registered as stored at Saqqara. The Saint Louis Art Museum bought the mask in 1998, for about $500,000, from Phoenix Ancient Art, an antiquities dealership owned by the brothers Hicham and Ali Aboutaam. Since that time, Hicham Aboutaam has been convicted in New York of falsifying customs documents (for another object), and an Egyptian court has convicted Ali Aboutaam in absentia of smuggling and sentenced him to 15 years in prison. According to the museum's complaint, the assistant attorneys from the United States attorney's office in St. Louis held a meeting about the mask on Jan. 13, in which they announced their intention to seize it."

2011-02-19T00:00:00Z,"5:52 p.m. | Updated Graying audiences: the subject causes great concern to opera houses, which fear that the number of people in their seats will dwindle as fewer young people become interested in the art form. So it seemed to be cause for celebration when the Metropolitan Opera proudly announced on Wednesday that the average age of its audience had dropped from 65 to 57 over the five years of Peter Gelb's tenure as general manager, according to internal surveys. Except that it wasn't true. After the Met was asked to provide documentation on the surveys, a spokesman said that Mr. Gelb - who provided the numbers - had been given incorrect information. In fact, the spokesman said, the average age of subscribers dropped from 66.4 in 2005 to 64.8 in 2011, and the average age of all audience members - single ticket buyers and subscribers - went from 60.4 to 57.7. Still, that's a three-year overall average drop, a positive trend in the eyes of the Met."

2011-02-19T00:00:00Z,"9 P.M. (Starz) THE RUNAWAYS (2010) Kristen Stewart portrays Joan Jett and Dakota Fanning (left, with Ms. Stewart) is Cherie Currie, the guitarist and lead singer for the real-life band of the title in this biopic set in Southern California in the mid-1970s. ''Girls can't play the electric guitar,'' a teacher informs Joan. ''This is not about women's lib,'' counters Michael Shannon, as the promoter Kim Fowley, who takes the girls under his wing and preaches a brand of macho feminism. ''It's about women's libido.'' Reviewing this feature-film debut from Floria Sigismondi, based on a memoir by Ms. Currie and with Ms. Jett as an executive producer, A. O. Scott wrote in The New York Times: ''Shot (by Benoît Debie) with a grainy, smeary look that evokes the decade as effectively as the clothes and haircuts, 'The Runaways' balances nostalgia for wild bygone times with a cautionary sense of their less heroic side. Acknowledging the brazen, rebellious energy of rock 'n' roll at the dawn of punk, Ms. Sigismondi also tallies the costs that an ardent, ambitious love of the music can exact.'' He added: ''The movie may be a little too tame in the end, but at its best it is just wild enough.'' 5 P.M. (TNT) N.B.A. ALL-STAR GAME AT 60 The N.B.A. leads up to its 2011 All-Star Game (Sunday night at 8:30) with an evening of specials, starting with this showcase of highlights from six decades as well as memories from the former stars Charles Barkley, Kevin McHale and Chris Webber. The programming continues with ''Ultimate N.B.A. All-Star Fantasy Draft,'' in which Mr. Barkley, Mr. McHale, Mr. Webber, Steve Kerr, Reggie Miller and Kenny Smith assume the role of general manager to create their ultimate teams from a pool of former all-stars. ''The Lost Dunks,'' at 7, looks back at the most spectacular dunks by players who failed to win the annual slam dunk contest. ''N.B.A. Tip-Off,'' a pregame show at 8, introduces ''N.B.A. All-Star Saturday Night: From Los Angeles,'' at 8:30, featuring a three-point shootout, a skills challenge, and the dunk competition with DeMar DeRozan of the Toronto Raptors, Blake Griffin of the Los Angeles Clippers, Serge Ibaka of the Oklahoma City Thunder and JaVale McGee of the Washington Wizards."

Such is the case with Luis Camnitzer, who, in his early 70s and with a half-century career behind him, is just now having his first New York museum survey. The show, at El Museo del Barrio, is terse, almost to the vanishing point in places, as might be expected from one of the pioneers of 1960s Conceptualism. Much of what's here is based on printed language: cryptic propositions, random lists of words and descriptive phrases -- unmoored from, or very loosely tethered to, other spare-to-barely-there visual matter."

To bolster support for teaching and research in the liberal arts, the American Academy of Arts and Sciences on Thursday announced the creation of a national commission on the humanities and social sciences. The panel was established at the request of a group of Democratic and Republican senators who asked the academy for a top 10 list of actions that government, educators and philanthropists could take to maintain excellence in the humanities and social sciences and strengthen civil society. The three dozen commission members include the former Supreme Court justice David Souter; filmmakers George Lucas and Ken Burns; James McNerney, the chairman and president of Boeing Company; the actor John Lithgow; the songwriter Emmylou Harris; the architect Billie Tsien; a raft of college presidents like John Sexton, Donna Shalala, David Skorton, Drew Gilpin Faust, Amy Gutmann, and John L.

Her lifelong dedication to the field of reproductive health included serving for many years as Director of Professional Education World Population for The Planned Parenthood Federation of America. An early pioneer of the nurse practitioner movement, Ms. Manisoff established the role of the nurse practitioner in family planning clinics, creating and running a training program which has since trained more than 800 nurse practitioners. The author of many professional articles and two books on family planning which have been translated into numerous languages, Ms. Manisoff was recognized with the Alan Guttmacher Lectureship in 1993, an honor it had previously never granted to a nurse. Ms. Manisoff served as a consultant to the World Health Organization and was appointed to the boards of a number of nursing training programs. The Miriam Manisoff Award was created in 1982 by The Planned Parenthood Federation of America in honor of Ms. Manisoff and is granted annually to an advanced clinician who has advanced the role of the OB/GYN nurse practitioner. Miriam Manisoff was preceded in death by her parents Sam and Clara and her husband Israel ""Manny"" Manisoff, a former Federal Theater director and fundraising consultant.

In October, Mr. Mozilo paid $67.5 million to settle a civil securities fraud lawsuit by the Securities and Exchange Commission.

Grabner, 23, has a team-high 25 goals in his first full season -- 16 in his last 16 games -- and has become a candidate for the Calder Trophy as the league's top rookie.

2011-02-20T00:00:00Z,"I don't mind admitting that I can be afraid of dogs - can be, rather than am, because it depends on their size and bark. But there's a reason the New York City Department of Parks and Recreation requires that dogs in parks be leashed between 9 a.m. and 9 p.m., except in dog runs, and there's a reason it regulates their behavior even in designated off-leash areas before and after those hours. Dogs are welcome at urban parks, but the parks are primarily for people, and while the vast majority of dogs are domesticated, acts of aggression by roaming dogs are, unfortunately, not uncommon. Yet, some pet owners routinely flout these policies, their lackadaisical attitudes suggesting that the rules are silly if not unnatural and that anxious civilians like me are nothing short of hysterical. Well, I have been pounced upon by dogs during my otherwise cherished runs in Central Park on more than one occasion. The most recent episode involved a dog that stood taller than my five-foot height - he jumped me from behind. His owner returned my stunned gasp with a chuckle and what he thought was a compliment: ''Oh, he was just flirting with you!''"

Joey has been the nonhuman star of the London production of ''War Horse'' for three years, and is set to trot onto the Vivian Beaumont stage of Lincoln Center Theater when preview performances begin March 15. The magic of Joey owes much to the three rotating teams of puppeteers who operate the head, ears, chest, legs, tail and other body parts, with two people inside the horse puppet and a third outside. ''I basically handle the emotional state of Joey, because I control his breathing by bending up and down, depending on whether he is winded or tense or afraid or at ease,'' said Alex Hoeffler, who is under Joey's front half, joined by Zach Villa behind and Jude Sandy outside. (The other six puppeteers for Joey are Joby Earle, Ariel Heller, Jeslyn Kelly, Jonathan David Martin, Prentice Onayemi and Enrico D. Wey.)"
2011-02-20T00:00:00Z,"THE final day of Fashion Week felt a bit like a dash for the last plane out of Lisbon, if you know what I mean. Everyone wore very tight expressions. The journalists heading to London were already in the transit lounge. Still, the day's shows held some delights: Ralph Lauren's beautifully rendered Deco glamour and subplot of a Chinese retail assault; L'Wren Scott's Gauguin colors and a pitch, from both Ms. Scott and Francisco Costa of Calvin Klein, for short hemlines. Skirt lengths have generally been below the knees or to the ankles. To me, the most striking change this season was the amount of innovative fabrics and embellishment, whether it was Oscar de la Renta's Oriental embroidery and patchwork or Marc Jacobs's rubber skirts crafted to look sequined."

2011-02-20T00:00:00Z,"IT is hardly unusual for a girl to dream of becoming a respected actress, but Mona Mansour once belonged to what must surely be a subset: those who take notes while watching regional theater productions as teenagers and cut out articles and photos of Meryl Streep, Swoosie Kurtz and others, keeping them organized in folders. ''I was this very freaky kid,'' Ms. Mansour said recently in an interview at the Public Theater, where her play ''Urge for Going'' will be presented beginning March 25. The path from starry-eyed adolescent amassing fan folders in Southern California in the 1970s (she declines to give her age) to increasingly noticed playwright included acting at Southern Methodist University, doing improv comedy with the Groundlings in Los Angeles soon after and, in 2001, writing her first play, ''Me and the S.L.A.'' A solo show about Patricia Hearst (''I was very, very obsessed with her''), it was also the start of her transition from actor to playwright. ''I think I had no concept of what it was to write a play, so for me acting felt like it was the way to be a part of this amazing thing,'' Ms. Mansour said. ''Until I realized I didn't like doing it anymore.''"

''I got a little sick feeling,'' said Ms. Miller, 26, who had kicked off the show by singing the opening lines of ''Aquarius.'' Unbeknown to her fellow cast members, Ms. Miller had secretly auditioned for the lead in a London production of ''Sister Act,'' the role Whoopi Goldberg made famous in the 1992 movie. The part of Deloris Van Cartier, an aspiring disco diva, was the kind of fabled break Ms. Miller had always hoped for. ''The opportunity to create a role and be a lead, that was my dream,'' she said. But it would mean leaving ''Hair.'' As it turned out, Ms. Miller ended up with the best of both worlds. After winning the part and an Olivier Award nomination on the West End, she is now making her Broadway debut after all, with the musical's move to New York this spring."

But this philosophy hasn't been a good export. The Egyptian revolution is only the latest example of how people can bring down tyrants without firing a shot. A century of successful nonviolent mass movements, in fact, makes the case that America's bloody insurrection against British rule was the anomaly, and perhaps not worthy of emulation. -- Excerpt from ''There Won't Be Blood'' TOWNIES Now that I was out of a job, and with more than $1,300 per month in Cobra payments looming, it seemed Tomoko and I had no choice.

2011-02-20T00:00:00Z,"WARREN--Irwin. Creator of some of the nation's most successful advertising campaigns, passed away at his home in Manhattan on December 11, 2010, at the age of 71. Cause of death was an aortic aneurysm. During an advertising career spanning more than 40 years, Mr. Warren worked at Doyle Dane Bernbach, BBDO, and other leading agencies, before moving to McCann Erickson, the world's largest advertising agency, where he retired as senior creative director in 2006. Notable campaigns and clients included Major League Baseball, Johnson & Johnson, Nestle, Unilever (""I Can't Believe It's Not Butter""), Lowe's, Campbell's Soup and Volkswagen. The elegant simplicity of his VW ads for DDB in the late 1960's earned their inclusion in the Museum of Modern Art's permanent advertising collection. Mr. Warren was born in St. Paul, Minnesota in 1939. Because his father was killed in an auto accident before his birth, Mr. Warren's mother, a concert pianist, raised him alone for several years before she re-married. Mr. Warren credited St. Paul Academy, where he completed high school, with developing in him the writing skills and intellectual rigor that he regarded as the keys to his success. He attended Colorado College and the University of Minnesota, before beginning his advertising career. Mr. Warren's marriage ended in divorce; there were no children. One of Mr. Warren's favorite campaigns was the long-running, very popular ""Taster's Choice Couple"" series that ran in the late 1990's. Each new installment generated extensive publicity, usually including an exclusive Today Show interview with Mr. Warren, who unveiled the latest 30-second plot twist. After recruiting Johnson & Johnson to McCann, Mr. Warren designed a campaign, which advanced no products, but stressed the company's long-term involvement with families, and dealt with such subjects as getting children to laugh; encouraging them to try to achieve; and dealing with being different. The company was deluged with requests from parents, schools, and organizations for DVDs of these spots. One McCann colleague recalled Mr. Warren as both brilliant and stubborn, and ""enormously loyal to his clients and his friends. His work was always smart, hard-working and stylish,"" he said. Outside of work, he served as an energetic fund-raiser and board member of Riverside Park Fund on New York's West Side, helping to drive its rejuvenation from a tawdry, needle-strewn place to a safe and attractive park fit for families. It is now one of only eight officially designated scenic landmarks in the City of New York. He was a voracious reader and a knowledgeable collector of antique furniture. After private funeral services, a memorial service will be announced at a later date. Donations in Mr. Warren's name may be made to Team Jim Scholarship, c/o New Canaan Community Foundation, PPO Box 1285, New Canaan, CT 06840. Mr. Warren is survived by his brothers, Adrian of Tucson, Robert, San Francisco and Joel, Los Angeles, his niece Rachel Warren, his nephews Alex Warren and Samuel Warren, and his godchildren Chris, Oie, A.J. and Molly McKennan."

2011-02-20T00:00:00Z,"For decades, endorphins have hogged the credit for producing ''runner's high,'' that fleeting sense of euphoria and calm that many people report experiencing after prolonged exercise. Who among us, after an especially satisfying workout, hasn't thought, ''ah, my endorphins are kicking in.'' Endorphins are the world's sole celebrity peptide. Endorphins first gained notoriety in exercise back in the 1980s when researchers discovered increased blood levels of the substance after prolonged workouts. (Endorphins, for those who know the word but not the molecules' actual function, are the body's home-brewed opiates, with receptors and actions much like those of pain-relieving morphine.) Endorphins, however, are composed of relatively large molecules, ''which are unable to pass the blood-brain barrier,'' said Matthew Hill, a postdoctoral fellow at Rockefeller University in New York. Finding endorphins in the bloodstream after exercise could not, in other words, constitute proof that the substance was having an effect on the mind. So researchers started to look for other candidates to help explain runner's high. Now an emerging field of neuroscience indicates that an altogether-different neurochemical system within the body and brain, the endocannabinoid system, may be more responsible for that feeling."

''There were a lot of lines I really needed help with.''

''Mr. Tyler so clearly enjoys what he's doing. What a breath of fresh air. I'm now able to give my culture-snob routine a rest on Wednesdays and Thursdays. 'Idol' is good TV, and I eagerly anticipate how Mr. Tyler and Jennifer Lopez will help guide the talented singers as the season progresses.''"
2011-02-20T00:00:00Z,"TONY SHELDON had just finished playing a cross-dresser in an Australian run of ''The Producers'' in 2005 when he took on the role of the transsexual chanteuse Bernadette in a workshop for a new musical, ''Priscilla Queen of the Desert,'' based on the 1994 film. ''I was reluctant at first,'' he said, '' because I thought I'd be trapped in this frock-wearing stereotype forever, and it would be the end of my career.'' Still, Mr. Sheldon, 55, has stuck with the part over the last five years in the Australian, West End and Toronto productions, and is now set to make his Broadway debut in ''Priscilla,'' which begins previews on Feb. 28. He has made his peace, calling Bernadette ''the role of a lifetime.'' A classically trained actor, he had never even performed outside of Australia until ''Priscilla'' took him to London."

2011-02-20T00:00:00Z,"HESS--Carl B.,Founder and Chairman Emeritus of AEA Investors, died peacefully at his home in New York City on February 15, 2011, age 98. He was born in Chicago, Illinois, October 28, 1912, and attended the University of Chicago Lab School. He went on to Dartmouth College, where his many college activities included serving as editor of Daily Dartmouth and as President of The Arts, The Round Table, and The Junto, and membership in Palaeopitus and Casque & Gauntlet. He graduated with honors in history in 1934. His business career led to his becoming a partner in Cresap McCormick & Paget, Management Consultants, and then vice president and director of American Securities Corp. In 1963, Mr. Hess conceived and created a new form of private investment firm which, in 1968, became American Euro pean Associates. Thus began his legendary career as a pioneer in private equity. Known since then as AEA Investors Inc., AEA, initially with financial support and endorsement of S.G. Warburg & Co. and shortly thereafter from senior members of the Rockefeller, Mellon, Harriman, Du Pont and other major families, was the first privately funded organization devoted solely to direct equity investment. From the outset and still today, its ownership and direction has been dominated by the chairmen and chief executive officers of many of America's leading corporations. The firm is now global in its reach with shareholder/participants of the same prominence and achievement in Europe, Asia, South and Central America, and the Middle East. As Chairman Emeritus, Mr. Hess remained active in the firm and was a regular presence in the AEA offices until shortly before his death. Ever loyal to Dartmouth College, he was a member of the Dean's Council and the President's Leadership Council. He was a member of The Rockefeller University Council and served on its Executive Committee. He was also on the Oversight Committee for Preservation of Objects at the Metropolitan Museum. He was predeceased by his beloved brother and friend, John D. Hess. He is survived by: his wife, Ludmila Schwarzenberg Hess; his son, Eric Hess and his daughter-in-law, June Hess; his daughter, Safiya Bonaventura; five grandchildren: Arden Hess Rowland and her husband Walter, and Aram, Joachim and his wife Kisha, Fleur and Claire Williams; one adored great-granddaughter, Wyatt Rowland; two nephews, Anthony and Oliver and his wife Leslie Hess; and two grand-nephews, John and Carl Hess. He is also survived by his first wife, Juliet Forbes. He was predeceased by his second wife, Desanka Pavlu, in 1990. Funeral services will be private. A memorial service will be held on Monday, March 7, 2011 at 4pm at the University Club. Contributions in his memory may be made to the Academic Venture Fund at Dartmouth College or to the Academic Venture Fund at The Rockefeller University."

2011-02-20T00:00:00Z,"FOR his first solo show in a New York gallery, Francesco Vezzoli chose an apt title: ''Sacrilegio.'' Its irreverence starts with his redesign of that gallery, the expansive Gagosian space on West 21st Street. It is now a stripped-down, dimly lighted Gothic church that is painted an Armani gray and is dedicated to a real Madonna, the source of Mr. Vezzoli's diva complex: his own mother. In each niche along the chapel nave hang appropriations, or rather apparitions, of Madonna-and-child paintings from the Italian Renaissance. But these digital prints on canvas have the faces of Cindy Crawford (at right), Christie Brinkley, Naomi Campbell and other supermodels of the 1970s and '80s, the period of Mr. Vezzoli's own coming-of-age as an artist. Each sheds his signature embroidered tears, only here they double as Warholian thought bubbles sampling icons of Arte Povera and Pop. And each wears gobs of actual designer makeup. They are encased in gold-leaf frames that ''melt'' at the bottom, Dalí style, as if they were crying, too. ''The real sacrilege of the exhibition is not the fashion model or the Madonna,'' he said. ''It's more challenging to discuss motherhood, or an obsession with your own mother, in a Chelsea gallery.'' Amen to that. LINDA YABLONSKY"

2011-02-20T00:00:00Z,"NETTER--Edward. Edward Netter, age 78, of Greenwich, CT and Montecito, CA, a distinguished philanthropist and business leader, passed peacefully at his home on February 16, 2011. By his side were his beloved wife of 56 years, Barbara, their daughter and son-in-law, Vicki and Bill Fitzgerald, their son, Don, daughter-in-law, Stephanie, and granddaughters, Arianna Nell (4) and Samantha Charli (2), who will forever keep ""Gramps"" in their prayers. Edward was raised in Scarsdale, NY, and following his marriage to Barbara, settled in Larchmont, NY before moving to Greenwich in 1979. Edward began his business career following graduation from the University of Pennsylvania in 1953; he joined and then became a partner of Cogan, Berlind, Weill & Levitt, a prominent investment banking firm in New York City which evolved into Shearson Loeb Rhoades. Edward's seminal writings on what was referred to as ""surplus, surplus"" or ""redundant capital"" helped transform the fire and casualty insurance industry by demonstrating how companies could unlock value for all stockholders. Edward became legendary as one of the architects of the modern-day financial services holding company wherein varieties of investment products (e.g. mutual funds, insurance, business services, banking, etc.) are amalgamated under a common entity, and his ideas spawned many eminent transactions. Edward went on to devote his unsurpassed combination of intellect, creativity and stamina as founder of Netter International, Ltd. in 1971, and then as Chairman of its successor, Geneve Corporation, a financial services holding company that has controlling interests in numerous prominent public and private businesses which straddle the financial, distribution and manufacturing worlds principally in the insurance and education sectors, including Independence Holding Company, American Independence Corp., The Aristotle Corporation, Standard Security Life Insurance Company of New York, Madison National Life Insurance Company, Independence American Insurance Company and Southern Life and Health Insurance Company. In 2006, Edward was inducted into the Business Leader Hall of Fame at the Quinnipiac University School of Business, Hamden, CT for his enduring contribution to business through extraordinary leadership. A significant philanthropist through much of his life, Edward donated his time, knowledge and resources to many charities concentrated principally on science, education and human services, including those in the local communities of Greenwich and Montecito. Edward and Barbara have provided visionary leadership to the Barbara and Edward Netter Center for Community Partnerships at the University of Pennsylvania, whose mission, through a virtual classroom, is to provide the broad range of knowledge needed to solve the complex, comprehensive and interconnected problems of the American city. Edward was also an active trustee of Thanks to Scandinavia in New York City and a respected participant of The Greenwich Roundtable. Edward was a longtime member of The Harmonie Club in New York City, Beach Point Club in Mamaroneck, NY, and Burnham Wood Golf Club in Montecito, CA. He was an enthusiast of classical music, jazz and dance, and an accomplished competitive bridge player; he enjoyed collecting cartoons and sending them to his family, colleagues and friends; and he was a voracious reader, a student of finance, science, education and politics, an avid swimmer and tennis player, and a proud grandfather. Despite his vast accomplishments, Edward was a private man, of great humility, kindness and compassion, and always delighted in lending his talents as a mentor to assist others achieve their best. Perhaps Edward's finest achievement was his most recent---the extension of his innovative business principles and financial resources to visionary philanthropy in the form of Alliance for Cancer Gene Therapy (ACGT). The courageous 11-year battle against breast cancer of their first daughter-in-law, Kimberly Lawrence-Netter, inspired Edward and Barbara to found ACGT in 2001 as the only public charity focused exclusively on cell and gene therapy research, which is widely believed to be the next significant key to the development of effective and safe treatments of all types of cancer. With 100% of contributions going directly to science, and a 17-member Scientific Advisory Council composed exclusively of pre-eminent doctors and academics in the field of cell and gene therapy, ACGT has made grants of more than $22 million to pioneering investigators at 27 renowned U.S. research institutions; and there are currently 17 ongoing clinical trials based on ACGT's sponsorship. The members of the Netter family are thankful to those dedicated and talented colleagues in the business and philanthropic communities, as well as their numerous dear friends, who have made Edward's extraordinary journey so exciting and rewarding. Funeral services will be held at Frank E. Campbell, 1076 Madison Avenue, New York, NY at 11:30am on Wednesday, February 23, 2011. In lieu of flowers, donations in Edward's memory will be gratefully appreciated by Alliance for Cancer Gene Therapy at www.acgtfoundation.org."

Michael Jackson (king of hearts) engaged in behavior bizarre even for him. He defecated (two of clubs) on a salmon burger (king of clubs) and captured his flatulence (queen of clubs) in a balloon (six of spades). This tawdry tableau, which I'm not proud to commit to the page, goes a long way toward explaining the unexpected spot in which I found myself in the spring of 2006. Sitting to my left was Ram Kolli, an unshaven 25-year-old business consultant from Richmond, Va., who was also the defending United States memory champion. To my right was the lens of a television camera from a national cable network. Spread out behind me, where I couldn't see them and they couldn't disturb me, were about 100 spectators and a pair of TV commentators offering play-by-play analysis. One was a blow-dried mixed martial arts announcer named Kenny Rice, whose gravelly, bedtime voice couldn't conceal the fact that he seemed bewildered by this jamboree of nerds. The other was the Pelé of U.S. memory sport, a bearded 43-year-old chemical engineer and four-time national champion from Fayetteville, N.C., named Scott Hagwood. In the corner of the room sat the object of my affection: a kitschy, two-tiered trophy of a silver hand with gold nail polish brandishing a royal flush. It was almost as tall as my 2-year-old niece (if lighter than most of her stuffed animals). The audience was asked not to take any flash photographs and to maintain total silence. Not that Kolli or I could possibly have heard them. Both of us were wearing earplugs. I also had on a pair of industrial-strength earmuffs that looked as if they belonged to an aircraft-carrier deckhand (in the heat of a memory competition, there is no such thing as deaf enough). My eyes were closed. On a table in front of me, lying face down between my hands, were two shuffled decks of playing cards. In a moment, the chief arbiter would click a stopwatch, and I would have five minutes to memorize the order of both decks."

The message went on to explain the kinds of things that Facebook does not allow: photos that attack a person or group, that depict drug use or contain violence or nudity. Facebook apparently had determined that an image the academy had uploaded to its Facebook page ran afoul of its ban on nudity. Yet the image -- an ink-on-paper drawing of a woman's naked upper body by Steven Assael -- was hardly racy. It was the kind of drawing you might see in galleries and museums the world over."

In 1938 Talladega, one of the country's oldest all-black colleges, commissioned Hale Aspacio Woodruff, an African-American artist who had studied with Diego Rivera, to create the murals for the lobby of its new library. Comprising six canvases, the murals depict events like the uprising on the slave ship La Amistad, scenes from the Underground Railroad and the founding of the college. At the High, the murals will be cleaned and restretched, Philip Verre, the museum's chief operating officer, said in a phone interview. They will go on view in an exhibition opening in Atlanta on June 2, 2012, and will travel later to the Indianapolis Museum of Art. Woodruff, who taught art at New York University for more than 20 years, died in 1980. He had a retrospective at the Studio Museum in Harlem in 1979 and an exhibition at the High Museum, focused on his paintings in Atlanta, in 2004."

Taylor went on to join the jet set, ride dressage, hunt fox, marry a man known as Moose, design kooky ski wear and build one of the first residences in Vail, Colo., before dying in 2007 at the age of 96.

Benetton is offering the building to the museum for free, as well as providing advertising and art materials and holding the opening-night party. The museum's director, Maria Ann Conelli, said that the budget for the one-month exhibition was between $300,000 and $400,000 and that the museum was reaching out to foundations and corporations for financing. Since January, the museum has been unable to make payments on the roughly $30 million it owes against its building on West 53rd Street. Last summer, it entered into a forbearance agreement with the company that insured its debt, ACA Financial Guaranty. That agreement expires on June 30. According to the most recent available financial statements, in the fiscal year that ended June 30, 2010, the museum ran a deficit from unrestricted activities of $3.6 million. Ms. Conelli said that the museum had a balanced budget for this year."

It claims to have 85,000 scores, or parts for nearly 35,000 works, with several thousand being added every month.

He called the film ''a kind of genealogy of hip that connects Burroughs, who was born in St. Louis in 1914, a wealthy Harvard-educated grandson of the founder of the Burroughs Adding Machine company, with many currents of America's outlaw cultural tradition'': among them, Allen Ginsberg, the Clash, Iggy Pop, Sonic Youth and Patti Smith. The film, an ''Independent Lens'' presentation, also touches on family tragedy: the death of Burroughs's wife Joan Vollmer, whom he accidentally shot in the head while playing a drunken game of William Tell in Mexico in 1951, and the death of his son, Billy Burroughs, who died of acute alcoholism in 1981. His friend John Giorno, the poet, says that it was the only time he ever saw Burroughs weep. 8 P.M. (Fox) GLEE Principal Figgins (Iqbal Theba) tutors the McKinley High students in the dangers of under-age drinking. In ''Raising Hope,'' at 9, Delilah (Amy Sedaris), the cousin and nemesis of Virginia (Martha Plimpton), makes a surprise visit to get her piece of the estate of Maw Maw (Cloris Leachman), even though she's not dead. Delilah also lets it be known that she still has a thing for Burt (Garret Dillahunt). And in ''Traffic Light,'' at 9:30, Lisa (Liza Lapira) intervenes when Mike (David Denman) starts offering work advice to a female colleague who would fit right in with the guys."

2011-02-23T17:13:38Z,"Justin Bieber, Lady Gaga, Mumford & Sons and Lady Antebellum all got big ""Grammy lifts"" - the typical boost in record sales after the awards show. But who had the biggest lift depends on how you look at the numbers. Mr. Bieber, who did not win any awards but who had a prominent performing slot at the ceremony, dominates this week's Billboard album chart. ""Never Say Never: The Remixes"" (Island), the soundtrack to his new 3-D concert film, opened at No. 1 with 161,000 copies sold. But just as impressive, he has three other albums in the Top 40: ""My World 2.0"" is No. 8, ""My Worlds Acoustic"" is No. 18, and ""My World,"" the mini-album that was his debut, is No. 31. Billboard said Mr. Bieber was the first artist to pull off that feat since Garth Brooks in 1993. The British alt-folk band Mumford & Sons and Lady Antebellum, the country-pop trio that went home with the most Grammy awards (five, including record and song of the year), also had good runs on the album chart. Mumford & Sons' ""Sigh No More"" (Glassnote) holds at No. 2 this week. Its rise to No. 2 from No. 11 last week was largely based on impulse buys made during the Grammys telecast, on which the group performed with Bob Dylan, with 133,000 sales, a 169 percent increase from the week before. Lady Antebellum's ""Need You Now"" (Capitol Nashville) is No. 4, with 85,000 sales, a 205 percent gain. (No. 3 this week goes to Vol. 37 of the series ""Now That's What I Call Music!,"" which sold 95,000.) In terms of digital downloads, however, Lady Gaga and Cee Lo Green came out way ahead. ""Born This Way,"" which Lady Gaga performed at the awards, sold 509,000 copies in its first full week on sale, bringing its total sales in the United States - in just 10 days - to 957,000. And sales of Cee Lo's ""____ You"" jumped 178 percent, to 412,000."

The 196-year-old cashmere purveyor - it's often credited with inventing the twin set - threw open its archives in Hawick, Scotland, last summer to the design school's students, who first catalogued them, then mined them for inspiration. The result is a woolly mashup that mixes 1950s argyles with a postmodern sensibility - in other words, perfect for fall's emerging grunge-meets-prim trend."

It will only take a few moments, so comprehensibly '70s were Frida Giannini's fur-covered shoulders, tie-at-the-neck blouses and chic gaucho trousers in flannel or suede with boots or platforms. The palette was all violet, wine, rust, emerald green, teal and a bit of cherry. Ms. Giannini also offered those lady-ish full-sleeved dresses with tiny belts that figure so prominently in memories and archives of the '70s, along with fedoras and feathers. Her press notes referred to Helmut Newton and Bob Richardson's fashion photographs of Anjelica Huston, his girlfriend at the time, who practically lives on every designer's mood board. The silhouette is certainly one for the ages - Marc Jacobs made a pass for spring - but it hardly lifts the old skirts."

Although the words ""space truss geometry"" may not sound sexy at first, QuaDror's potential is impressive: its interlocking, load-bearing members function at several scales, from the small (a table base or room divider) to the large (a bridge support or structure for a house). When used in multiples, these forms are not only as stable as a solid cube (while using only 20 percent of the volume), but also have acoustical properties, as in a highway sound barrier. But the application about which Dror is most excited is that of emergency housing. The QuaDror Home is a kit that includes instructions, tools and QuaDror universal joints - to which structural members (of wood, bamboo, etc.) can be attached. Because these pieces take up so little room, Dror estimates that 1,750 of the kits can be shipped in a single 40-foot container. Small, sturdy houses can be built with whatever local materials are available, making them even more cost-effective, not to mention sustainable. The first QuaDror Home kit is just beginning production, and the studio hopes to build its first houses in Sierra Leone and Brazil next year."

Born in Rochester, NY on May 24, 1943 and raised in Raleigh, NC she was the daughter of the late Thomas Clarkson Worth and Barbara Luther Worth. She is survived by her children Alison Foster Reining (Michael) of Midlothian, VA and Archibald M. Foster III (GiGi) of Locust Valley, NY; grandchildren Hailey, Charlotte, and Andrew Reining, and Trilby Foster; and four brothers. Mrs. Foster touched many lives while pursuing her multiple passions including the culinary arts, art history, travel and theatre. While a southerner until the end, she drank in the culture and energy of the City and was truly a New Yorker at heart. The Metropolitan Museum of Art was a happy thread woven into her life for over 36 years. After joining the weekend volunteers answering questions at the front desk, her passion grew and that task evolved into giving tours of American paintings and sculpture, French and English decorative arts, finally coming to rest on the Impressionists. Hers was a tour not to be missed. She recently mentioned that her years as a docent at the Met ""enriched my brain but, most of all, enriched my soul."" A new chapter in her life threw open doors to fresh adventures (including a trip to Hudson Bay to observe polar bears), a number of dear new friends, and a long career in development at the Japan Society. Her many years there instilled in her an appreciation of Eastern tradition and a deep love of Japanese culture. Her shorter career as the director of development at St. Vincent's hospital gave her other, very different insights as well as an appreciation of the sacrifices men and women make to care for the indigent. The family will welcome friends on the evening of Thursday, February 24 from 5:00pm to 8:00 pm at the Frank E. Campbell Funeral Home on 81st and Madison. A memorial service for Mrs. Foster will be held at The Brick Church on 92nd and Park, Friday, February 25 at 3:00pm."

Two weeks after the opening of ''Justin Bieber: Never Say Never,'' a 3-D concert documentary about that 16-year-old, Canada-preferring, floppy-hair-cutting, Grammy-almost-winning pop phenomenon, an extended version of that film will be released into theaters. Paramount's Insurge Pictures division, which released the original film, said a ''director's fan cut'' of ''Never Say Never,'' with 40 minutes of new footage, will be shown in theaters for one week starting Friday. The re-release, which could add significantly to the $51.3 million in tickets that the film had sold in the United States by Monday, is a test of the loyalty of Mr. Bieber's fans, but also, its director said, an experiment to see how quickly a studio can place a film in theaters once its editing is complete."

One likely factor was Disney Theatrical Productions' decision to shift the show's usual Tuesday evening performance to Monday evening, Feb. 14, to capitalize on date nights for Valentine's Day. ''The Lion King'' has run for about 13 years and four months on Broadway.

She is also survived by her brother, David Reinauer, and wife Anne of Lake Charles, LA; and twin sister, Jere Glaser, of New Orleans, LA. Sudy was born in Lake Charles, Louisiana, on September 23, 1943, graduated from Lake Charles High School in 1961, and the University of Illinois in 1965. She moved to Houston in 1975. She initially worked in the advertising department of the Houston Chronicle and soon entered the insurance business with the Connecticut Mutual Insurance Company. Insurance and estate planning became a lifelong passion of hers, mainly for the assistance she was able to offer to families in understanding and planning for their future. Her clients were particularly moved by her ability to connect with them on both emotional and analytical levels. Over many years, she became a trusted advisor and worked tirelessly to refine her technical knowledge. A true relationship builder, she pioneered a way for businesswomen to network with each other to provide contacts, access to business leads and support. In 1976 in this context, she started ""women's breakfast clubs"", ultimately starting 12 clubs including the River Oaks Breakfast Club, Charter 100 Breakfast Club, the Women's City Club and the Jewish Federation of Greater Houston Breakfast Club. These are the largest such groups in Houston and have provided a high degree of emotional support, business guidance and pure friendship to countless professional women. Sudy had a vivacious spirit, energetic demeanor and generous character, as evidenced by her many friends and diverse interests. She was passionate about the arts, was working diligently to achieve Life Master status at bridge, and recently became a mentor for the Brigid's Hope Program, a group that helps women re-integrate into society after incarceration in Texas jails. With her husband, she literally traveled the world, exploring all seven continents and over 75 countries in the past 20 years including, to name a few of the more exotic adventures, Bhutan, Central Asia, and Antarctica. Sudy could light up a roomful of people, share an intimate conversation or nurture a distant e-mail exchange. Her infectious smile and abundant laughter were always easily at hand. Full of stories about travel and life, a reliable and willing play date for her adoring grandchildren and simply a great listener, she will be dearly missed by her family and numerous friends.

The Office of Mental Health immediately bills them for the time they spend in the hospital, often stopping the case cold and making it nearly impossible for the patient to attract or keep a lawyer, a practice we explored in this article in December. The strategy was hugely effective at quashing claims, even ones borne of extreme tragedy. But to avoid any chance of a public outcry, it now appears that billing personnel were told to code certain cases - for instance, those involving the death or rape of psychiatric patients - differently, apparently to signal the need for special handling, according to an examination of state records turned over in response to a long-running lawsuit called Brown v.

2011-02-23T00:00:00Z,"The American Folk Art Museum, which is facing serious financial problems, is nonetheless embarking an ambitious project: an exhibition of African-American self-taught and graffiti artists to take place in Venice during the Biennale there. The exhibition will open June 1 at the Fondaco dei Tedeschi, a building owned by the Benetton Group that may ultimately become a Rem Koolhaas-designed retail and exhibition space. Benetton is offering the building to the museum for free, as well as providing advertising and art materials and holding the opening-night party. The museum's director, Maria Ann Conelli, said that the budget for the one-month exhibition was between $300,000 and $400,000 and that the museum was reaching out to foundations and corporations for financing. Since January, the museum has been unable to make payments on the roughly $30 million it owes against its building on West 53rd Street. Last summer, it entered into a forbearance agreement with the company that insured its debt, ACA Financial Guaranty. That agreement expires on June 30. According to the most recent available financial statements, in the fiscal year that ended June 30, 2010, the museum ran a deficit from unrestricted activities of $3.6 million. Ms. Conelli said that the museum had a balanced budget for this year. This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print."
2011-02-23T00:00:00Z,"For many, a familiar scent can arouse a forgotten memory. Jennifer Fraser wouldn't know that feeling. She does not have a sense of smell. In 2007, Ms. Fraser moved from Los Angeles to New York. For her, the city is a carnival of movement and motion: classical and modern dancing, bright lights, fast cars and street musicians. ''New York City is like a circus of music,'' she said, ''music coming out of the streets, the bodegas, the subway tracks.'' When she closes her eyes, Ms. Fraser envisions a ballerina en pointe. Sometimes, she feels as if she is living in black and white: when she visits new neighborhoods and can't smell the different fragrances, it seems as if the city has lost some of its color. But most of the time, she is comfortable with her unique perception of New York. ''I don't feel like I'm missing out,'' she said. This series presents multiple-exposure portraits of perceptions of the city described by New Yorkers missing one or more senses. Earlier in the series: nytimes.com/lens."

Both former Knicks played over 34 minutes a night, which means that in addition to Anthony, New York will have at least one more new regular filling in minutes on the wing."

Press representatives for the revival said on Thursday that Mr. Jones will play Arthur Hockstader, a Truman-esque chief executive deciding between endorsing the potential presidential nominees William Russell and Joe Cantwell. When ""The Best Man"" was first presented on Broadway in 1960 (and made into a film in 1964), Russell was perceived as an analogue for Adlai Stevenson and Cantwell as an amalgam of John F. Kennedy and Richard M. Nixon; a 2000 Broadway revival, starring Charles Durning as Hockstader, Spalding Gray as Russell and Chris Noth as Cantwell, seemed to have its eye on the real-life contest between Al Gore and George W. Bush. Michael Wilson (""The Orphans' Home Cycle"") will direct the 2012 production, though its producers have not yet announced their nominees to play Russell and Cantwell."

2011-02-24T00:00:00Z,"FLOM--Joseph H. The partners, counsel, associates and staff of Skadden, Arps, Slate, Meagher & Flom LLP mourn the death of Joseph H. Flom, who joined Skadden, Arps as the firm's first associate in 1948. Over the course of a singularly distinguished law career, he fundamentally transformed the practice of corporate law, while guiding Skadden from a four-lawyer firm to a global law firm with 2,000 attorneys and scores of practice areas. Joe combined a brilliant intellect, impeccable judgment and relentless dedication, which he applied to everything he touched with true humility. A most trusted adviser, beloved and respected partner and mentor, faithful friend and formidable adversary, he was, in every sense, a great man. The consummate deal attorney smart, strategic and tireless he was among the first to drive mergers and acquisitions to the top of corporate agendas; and, in 1999, he was named one of the ""lawyers of the century"" by The American Lawyer. With a steady hand and clear vision, he set the course for Skadden's development, never wavering from his principles of unparalleled legal advice, loyalty to his colleagues and peers, and social responsibility. Joe was a dedicated humanitarian, supporting education and equal opportunity in the legal profession, and likely would have wanted to be remembered most for his philanthropic endeavors. He was particularly gratified by the enduring work of the Skadden Fellowship Foundation, of which he was the founding trustee in 1988. More recently, Joe led the development of the Skadden Honors Program in Legal Studies at City College of New York, an initiative designed to increase diversity in the legal profession. Along with his first wife, Claire, who predeceased him in 2007, Joe supported the Gateway School in New York founded by Claire for students with learning disabilities. They also supported cancer research at the Mount Sinai-NYU Medical Center Health System, among other institutions and causes. More recently, he and his wife Judi provided significant financial support for the widely praised ""Play Me, I'm Yours"" public installation of 60 pianos in all five boroughs of New York City for several weeks last summer. In addition to his law practice, Joe served on numerous corporate boards and was a trustee of the Carroll and Milton Petrie Foundation. In 2005, Joe and the Petrie Foundation provided funding for the creation of the Petrie-Flom Center for Health Law Policy, Biotechnology and Bioethics at Harvard Law School to promote an interdisciplinary analysis of legal issues in the areas of health care, biotechnology and bioethics. He volunteered his time and expertise to numerous other educational and civic organizations, including the Harvard Law School Dean's Advisory Board; The City College 21st Century Foundation; the American Academy of Arts and Sciences; the Council on Foreign Relations; the Woodrow Wilson International Center for Scholars; the New York City Commission on the Bicentennial of the U.S. Constitution; the New York City Operation Welcome Home Commission; the New York City Commission on the Status of Women; the Archdiocesan Task Force on Crime Prevention and Youth; the New York City Holocaust Memorial Commission; the Mayor's Council of Economic Advisors; the Metropolitan Museum of Art; the United Way of New York City; the America-Israel Friendship League; and the Mount Sinai-NYU Medical Center Health System. Joe is survived by his wife Judi, sons Jason and Peter, and daughter Nancy Laing, as well as six grandchildren and two great-grandchildren. He will be deeply missed and always cherished by all who knew him. The family is holding a private remembrance. In lieu of flowers, contributions may be made to the Skadden Fellowship Foundation for the support of new projects undertaken by former Skadden Fellows. The address is: Skadden Fellowship Foundation, Four Times Square, Room 29/218, New York, N.Y., 10036."

2011-02-24T00:00:00Z,"The biggest American financial institutions are still benefiting from the perception that the government will always come to their rescue. But a slight narrowing in the gap between what large banks like JPMorgan Chase and Bank of America and others in the industry pay for deposits may suggest a hint of progress. That offers hope for those, like Thomas M. Hoenig, president of the Federal Reserve Bank of Kansas City, who would like to eradicate the notion that some banks are too big to fail. In fairness, the evidence is barely perceptible and may be fleeting. According to fourth-quarter figures released by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation on Wednesday, the 107 American banks with more than $10 billion of assets are still financing themselves ridiculously cheaply. The top banks paid just 0.77 percent in annual interest to depositors in the quarter. That is the lowest rate in the statistics published by the F.D.I.C., which stretch back to the first quarter of 1984. Smaller banks, on average, had to pay customers around 1.18 percent."

Charley was 80 years old, born on October 13, 1930 in Albany, New York, son of Charles and Margaret Biggar. Charley served in the United States Navy in the early 1950's. He joined IBM as a customer engineer in 1955 and enjoyed a prominent 32-year career at IBM where he retired as President of their service division. He attended Siena College and was a Stanford Sloan Fellow at Stanford University Business School. Charley's IBM career quickly advanced and in June of 1971 he was appointed IBM Director of Service, and in October of 1975 he was elected an IBM Vice President. He was promoted to President of Field Engineering in October 1976, and later named President of the National Service Division. Charley retired from IBM in 1987 to focus on his family and the game of golf. Some of his happiest moments were spent in the early morning on his beloved Whippoorwill golf course with friends and family. He was a tireless spirit, an achiever and a fierce competitor with a great love for life. Charley is survived by his wife of 55 years, Mary Patricia (Pat) and their seven children. He will also be fondly remembered by his seventeen grandchildren, as well as his three sisters and his brother. A Funeral Mass will be celebrated on Saturday, February 26th at 12:30pm at St John and St Mary Roman Catholic Church in Chappaqua, NY. The family will receive friends at the Beecher Funeral Home, 418 Bedford Road, Pleasantville, NY on Thursday February 24th from 4 to 8pm.

2011-02-24T00:00:00Z,"Every spring brings one or two late entries to the Broadway season, opening just under the wire to qualify for the Tony Awards. This year it will be ''The Normal Heart,'' Larry Kramer's landmark play about love, AIDS and New York in the 1980s, which will begin preview performances at the Golden Theater on April 19 and open on April 27, a spokesman for the production said Wednesday. To qualify for this year's Tonys shows must open by April 28. The production has its roots in an acclaimed staged reading in October on Broadway, at the Walter Kerr Theater, which raised $150,000 for charity. The veteran producer Daryl Roth will back ''The Normal Heart'' for the Broadway run, as she did for the staged reading. The actor and director Joe Mantello, above left, with Mr. Kramer, will play the central character Ned Weeks, and John Benjamin Hickey (''Love! Valour! Compassion!'') will play Ned's lover, Felix Turner, reprising their performances from the reading. Joining them in her Broadway debut will be the film actress Ellen Barkin as Emma Brookner, the doctor in a wheelchair who recognizes the seriousness of the AIDS crisis. (Glenn Close played the role at the reading.) Mr. Kramer wrote in an e-mail on Tuesday night that the production was also in talks with Cheyenne Jackson to play Tommy, a young gay activist who was played by Jack McBrayer (''30 Rock'') last fall. This Broadway production will be a relatively hectic affair. The director, Joel Grey, is now in rehearsals as an actor; he'll play Moonface Martin for the Broadway revival of ''Anything Goes,'' which starts previews on March 10 and opens on April 7. Mr. Mantello is also directing the Off Broadway play ''The Other Place,'' which is scheduled to begin previews on March 11 and run through April 24. ''The Normal Heart'' will move into the Golden almost immediately after ''Driving Miss Daisy'' closes on April 9."

2011-02-24T00:00:00Z,"Justin Bieber, Lady Gaga, Mumford & Sons and Lady Antebellum all got big ''Grammy lifts'' - the typical boost in record sales after the awards show. But who had the biggest lift depends on how you look at the numbers. Mr. Bieber, who did not win any awards but who had a prominent performing slot at the ceremony, dominates this week's Billboard album chart. ''Never Say Never: The Remixes'' (Island), the soundtrack to his new 3-D concert film, opened at No. 1 with 161,000 copies sold. But just as impressive, he has three other albums in the Top 40: ''My World 2.0'' is No. 8, ''My Worlds Acoustic'' is No. 18, and ''My World,'' the mini-album that was his debut, is No. 31. Billboard said Mr. Bieber was the first artist to pull off that feat since Garth Brooks in 1993. The British alt-folk band Mumford & Sons and Lady Antebellum, the country-pop trio that went home with the most Grammy awards (five, including record and song of the year), also had good runs on the album chart. Mumford & Sons' ''Sigh No More'' (Glassnote) holds at No. 2 this week. Its rise to No. 2 from No. 11 last week was largely based on impulse buys made during the Grammys telecast, on which the group performed with Bob Dylan, with 133,000 sales, a 169 percent increase from the week before. Lady Antebellum's ''Need You Now'' (Capitol Nashville) is No. 4, with 85,000 sales, a 205 percent gain. (No. 3 this week goes to Vol. 37 of the series ''Now That's What I Call Music!,'' which sold 95,000.) In terms of digital downloads, however, Lady Gaga and Cee Lo Green came out way ahead. ''Born This Way,'' which Lady Gaga performed at the awards, sold 509,000 copies in its first full week on sale, bringing its total sales in the United States - in just 10 days - to 957,000. And sales of Cee Lo's ''-------- You'' jumped 178 percent, to 412,000. This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print."

2011-02-24T00:00:00Z,"Hanover, N.H. TWO images serve as bookends to the four-decades-old rule of Libya's ruler, Col. Muammar el-Qaddafi. The first is the picture taken a few days after the Sept. 1, 1969, coup that brought him to power: it shows a handsome, pencil-thin revolutionary in military uniform, kneeling in the desert sand to pray. The other was taken two days ago: Colonel Qaddafi in bedouin garb as an uprising sparked by the arrest of a human rights lawyer in Benghazi continued to overtake the country, defiantly and incoherently defending his self-styled revolution, vowing to struggle on until death."

But will enough people part with $250 for the experience? On first glance, the Nintendo 3DS looks a lot like last year's DSi. It can play more than 2,000 existing software cartridges, and is even compatible with the older charger. But once the lid is opened, the comparisons end. The upper screen is now iPhone-sized, at 800 by 240 pixels. And with 400 of those pixels reserved for each of your eyes, the display can trick your brain into seeing a three-dimensional image."

In 1997, Ms. Tarzian joined her sister, who was running her father's neighborhood kitchenware store in New York. Over the next 11 years, she bought out her sister and transformed the store into a modern mecca for both gourmet and aspiring cooks. She ultimately sold the store and moved to Chicago to pursue a new opportunity working for a housewares manufacturer. It is three years later and things did not work out as planned. Her job was eliminated because of the recession and, like many people, she has been left to ponder her next move. She started to think that one of her options might be to open a store in Chicago. She is getting plenty of advice, and it has all pointed in the same direction. Two chief executives who know her skills, drive and personality have encouraged her to, ''Get it done.'' When she shows some anxiety about taking the inevitable risks, they insist, ''Just do it!''"

In the Weekend Business podcast, Catherine Rampell explains why: the turmoil in the Middle East has sent oil prices soaring. Investors fear that the unrest will spread to other countries, further disrupting production. In the United States, major cutbacks by state and local governments and threats of federal cutbacks are throwing more workers into the unemployment pool.

My point was to highlight the fact that this approach, which is vastly underutilized and underfunded, is proving to be superior to the current practices in the child welfare system. It's now common for youth to remain in foster care or residential treatment for years. When they age out of these systems, many are unable to live successfully as adults."

In the boxing video game Fight Night Champion, which EA Sports will release for the Xbox 360 and PlayStation3 consoles on Tuesday, Ms. Dushku plays the daughter of an unscrupulous fight promoter, and finds herself drawn into an intrigue involving her father and an up-and-coming boxer (played by the actor and athlete LaMonica Garrett). The story, which is told in movie-style sequences that unfold between the game's playable boxing matches, is written by Will Rokos, an Academy Award-nominated writer and producer of ""Monster's Ball,"" and represents the latest effort to bridge the worlds of gaming and cinema. These sequences (which were created using 3-D motion-capture technology) also allowed Ms. Dushku to play a character who was very much herself and yet as unearthly as anything seen on a Joss Whedon show."

State Representative Scott Raecker introduced the bill this month as a way to create an endowment to pay for as many as 1,000 full student scholarships a year, but the proposal drew widespread criticism. David Miles, the president of the Board of Regents, State of Iowa, described the bill as ''a profoundly bad idea,'' one that was examined by the board in 2008 and ''determined to be not in the best interests of the University of Iowa or the state.'' Mr. Raecker told the student newspaper The Daily Iowan that he still believed the painting should be sold but said that the issue had become ''so polarized that reaching consensus is unlikely.'' ''I'm a firm believer in the legislative process,'' he added, ''and further discussion of the sale of the Pollock painting will not be moved forward in the legislature this year.''

2011-02-25T00:00:00Z,"FLOM--Joseph H. It is with great sadness that The City College of New York marks the death of Joseph H. Flom, Class of 1948, even as we celebrate the life of one of our most illustrious graduates. Having had to leave the College to serve in World War II, Flom went directly into Harvard Law School immediately after the war. He was awarded his long-awaited Bachelor's Degree by City College in 2003; in 2004, he received the President's Medal and in 2005, the Honorary Doctor of Laws Degree, Honoris Causa, from his alma mater. On a personal note, President Lisa Staiano-Coico said that Joe Flom's infectious enthusiasm in support of our students' success and his deep and creative thoughtfulness about how to help them achieve that success -- placed him among the greatest friends to any college that she had ever known. In the 61 years since he was hired as the first associate at the law firm of Skadden, Arps, Slate, Meagher, and Flom, Joe Flom built the law firm into to one of the largest and most widely admired firms in the world. Skadden Arps has consistently been ranked at the top of every list of the best law firms, and he has been described as ""the best lawyer of his generation."" As one of the charter signatories of the American Bar Association's pro bono challenge, Flom led the way in setting the industry standard for commitment to pro bono service. Under his leadership, Skadden Arps was one of the first law firms to hire a full-time senior attorney whose primary responsibilities include the coordination of pro bono efforts, and his New York office now places attorneys in the New York Legal Aid Society and The Lawyers Alliance of New York. In addition, in 1988 he established the Skadden Fellowship Foundation in recognition of the dire need for greater funding for graduating law students who wish to devote their professional lives to providing legal services to the poor, the elderly, the homeless and the disabled, as well as those deprived of their civil or human rights. The Skadden Fellows Program, described by The Los Angeles Times as a ""legal peace corps,"" gives Fellows the freedom to pursue public interest work, and more than 90% of its graduates continue working in the public interest. Joe Flom's service to City College has been quiet but unwavering over a lifetime of professional success. His support of City College's Honors Program, Center for Mathematics Education, and Emergency Fund through the Flom and Petrie Foundations exemplifies the scope and depth of his determination to give future generations the opportunities that he had. In 2005, as a special present for his 80th birthday, his fellow partners at Skadden Arps joined together to endow the Joseph H. Flom Award for Academic Excellence at The City College of New York. The Flom Prize, as it is called, is awarded annually to the most outstanding graduate of the class. Previous recipients have included CCNY Rhodes Scholars Lev Sviridov and David Bauer. In 2008, together with his colleagues at Skadden Arps, Flom established the groundbreaking Skadden Arps Honors Program in Legal Studies at City College with a $10 million grant. The Skadden Arps Program seeks to help address a national problem and increase the number of individuals from populations currently underrepresented in law school and the legal profession. The Program provides talented students of low income status and diverse backgrounds with the tools, experience and education necessary to succeed in law school and ultimately a legal career.He served as a highly regarded leading member of the City College 21st Century Foundation Board. In 2004, Joe Flom's alma mater presented him with the President's Medal for Distinguished Achievement and Public Service to the City of New York and The City College of New York. In 2005, the City College of New York awarded him the Doctor of Laws Degree, Honoris Causa. Our sincere condolences go out to his wife, Judi Sorenson Flom, his sons Jason and Peter Flom, his daughter Nancy Laing, and his six grandchildren and two great-grandchildren. His contributions to the profession of law and to a just society will forever remain a beacon to the students, faculty, and alumni of the City College and to the countless lives he transformed. Lisa Staiano-Coico, President, The City College of New York"

Several years later, now married and raising a young family, he sponsored most of his brothers and sisters who all wished to migrate to the U.S. In addition, many other relatives, including cousins, nieces, nephews and/or their children followed in his path. He was an extremely loving husband, father, brother and grandfather. A widower since 1971, he is survived in his immediate family by his two sons, Sanjay and Ranjit Kripalani; a daughter-in-law, Kerstin Tibbetts Kripalani; and two loving grandchildren, Serena and Marisa Kripalani."

Press representatives for the revival said on Thursday that Mr. Jones will play Arthur Hockstader, a Truman-esque chief executive deciding between endorsing the potential presidential nominees William Russell and Joe Cantwell. When ''The Best Man'' was first presented on Broadway in 1960 (and made into a film in 1964), Russell was perceived as an analogue for Adlai Stevenson and Cantwell as an amalgam of John F. Kennedy and Richard M. Nixon; a 2000 Broadway revival, starring Charles Durning as Hockstader, Spalding Gray as Russell and Chris Noth as Cantwell, seemed to have its eye on the real-life contest between Al Gore and George W.

2011-02-25T00:00:00Z,"WARREN--Irwin. Creator of some of the nation's most successful advertising campaigns, passed away at his home in Manhattan on December 11, 2010, at the age of 71. Cause of death was an aortic aneurysm. During an advertising career spanning more than 40 years, Mr. Warren worked at Doyle Dane Bernbach, BBDO, and other leading agencies, before moving to McCann Erickson, the world's largest advertising agency, where he retired as senior creative director in 2006. Notable campaigns and clients included Major League Baseball, Johnson & Johnson, Nestle, Unilever (""I Can't Believe It's Not Butter""), Lowe's, Campbell's Soup and Volkswagen. The elegant simplicity of his VW ads for DDB in the late 1960's earned their inclusion in the Museum of Modern Art's permanent advertising collection. Mr. Warren was born in St. Paul, Minnesota in 1939. Because his father was killed in an auto accident before his birth, Mr. Warren's mother, a concert pianist, raised him alone for several years before she re-married. Mr. Warren credited St. Paul Academy, where he completed high school, with developing in him the writing skills and intellectual rigor that he regarded as the keys to his success. He attended Colorado College and the University of Minnesota, before beginning his advertising career. Mr. Warren's marriage ended in divorce; there were no children. One of Mr. Warren's favorite campaigns was the long-running, very popular ""Taster's Choice Couple"" series that ran in the late 1990's. Each new installment generated extensive publicity, usually including an exclusive Today Show interview with Mr. Warren, who unveiled the latest 30-second plot twist. After recruiting Johnson & Johnson to McCann, Mr. Warren designed a campaign, which advanced no products, but stressed the company's long-term involvement with families, and dealt with such subjects as getting children to laugh; encouraging them to try to achieve; and dealing with being different. The company was deluged with requests from parents, schools, and organizations for DVDs of these spots. One McCann colleague recalled Mr. Warren as both brilliant and stubborn, and ""enormously loyal to his clients and his friends. His work was always smart, hard-working and stylish,"" he said. Outside of work, he served as an energetic fund-raiser and board member of Riverside Park Fund on New York's West Side, helping to drive its rejuvenation from a tawdry, needle-strewn place to a safe and attractive park fit for families. It is now one of only eight officially designated scenic landmarks in the City of New York. He was a voracious reader and a knowledgeable collector of antique furniture. After private funeral services, a memorial service will be announced at a later date. Donations in Mr. Warren's name may be made to Team Jim Scholarship, c/o New Canaan Community Foundation, PPO Box 1285, New Canaan, CT 06840. Mr. Warren is survived by his brothers, Adrian of Tucson, Robert, San Francisco and Joel, Los Angeles, his niece Rachel Warren, his nephews Alex Warren and Samuel Warren, and his godchildren Chris, Oie, A.J. and Molly McKennan."

Sciame. In a letter to Ms. Pelzer that he shared with The New York Times, the former president, Peter Stanford, said that the museum needed new leadership to survive. He wrote that Ms. Pelzer's and Mr. Sciame's credibility had been damaged by ''concealment'' of its financial problems, and that the ''overall direction of the Seaport Museum has been neglectful of its principal physical asset,'' its historic ships. Mr. Sciame, a real estate developer, has lent the museum $3 million in the last year to cover operating expenses.

What they don't count on is being pursued by thugs with guns (Jimmi Simpson and Common) after being mistaken for the blackmailers (James Franco and Mila Kunis) whose reservation they stole. Mark Wahlberg plays a former client, a sort of special ops expert with stellar pecs and a knowledge of Hebrew, to whom Claire turns for help. Writing in The New York Times, A. O.

A wife, mother and grandmother, Mackie, as she was known to the many people who loved her, inspired those around her with her grace, warmth and sense of humor. She gave tirelessly to her family, her neighbors and her friends - and most important of all to the ill children of the Child Life Program at North Shore Hospital, where she was a volunteer for more than three decades and Chairman of the program. In that role, her artwork decorated the rooms of countless ill children and she continually brought smiles and happiness to these beautiful children, with her compassion and creativity. Maxine grew up in Brooklyn and taught school for a few years. As a teenager, she met her long-time husband and the love of her life, Buddy Wasserman, at sleep away camp (Blue Ridge and Equinunk). To this day, the couple has retained many close friends from those cherished camp days. The Wassermans have lived in East Hills for 30 years. Maxine's beloved brother, Bert Grossman, died last year.

2011-02-26T00:00:00Z,"On television series like ''Buffy'' and ''Dollhouse,''Eliza Dushku was perfectly comfortable holding her own against tough guys, and maybe throwing a punch or two when the situation required it. So her next role is a bit of a departure, and not only because she isn't called upon to swing her fists. In the boxing video game Fight Night Champion, which EA Sports will release for the Xbox 360 and PlayStation3 consoles on Tuesday, Ms. Dushku plays the daughter of an unscrupulous fight promoter, and finds herself drawn into an intrigue involving her father and an up-and-coming boxer (played by the actor and athlete LaMonica Garrett). The story, which is told in movie-style sequences that unfold between the game's playable boxing matches, is written by Will Rokos, an Academy Award-nominated writer and producer of ''Monster's Ball,'' and represents the latest effort to bridge the worlds of gaming and cinema. These sequences (which were created using 3-D motion-capture technology) also allowed Ms. Dushku to play a character who was very much herself and yet as unearthly as anything seen on a Joss Whedon show. Ms. Dushku spoke recently to ArtsBeat about the making of Fight Night Champion and her role in the game, and the burdens of being an able-bodied woman in the entertainment industry. These are excerpts from that conversation.Q.I thought it was very brave of you to allow yourself to be photographed during your motion-capture session with your face covered with all those - uh, what do you call them?A.Dots. It's a very technical name. Motion-cap dots. My makeup artist from ''Dollhouse,'' her name's Tegan, she worked on ''Avatar'' and she worked on the game as well, so that was really fun. Nobody places sexy dots like Tegan. If one dot tries to slip off, she is quick on the draw. She will reattach it. Q.And you wouldn't want a dot to go astray.A.No, that would mean, like, a droopy eyelid. It could send your whole expression off and turn you into another person. It would be a travesty.Q.You grew up just outside of Boston. Were you legally required to appreciate boxing?A.Yeah, pretty much. My dad was from the South End and grew up loving sports and boxing himself. I remember having a Mike Tyson T-shirt back in the day that I used to sleep in. And there some things that Tyson did along the way that I wasn't too psyched to associate myself with. But back in the day, just as a fighter, what a dream that was to watch and root for him.Q.Tell me about your Fight Night character, Megan McQueen. She seems to associate with a lot of unsavory figures.A.It's a gnarly, cutthroat world. She's the only daughter of D. L. McQueen, the shady promoter, and her whole life she's had a loyalty to him, but everything changes when she really gets to see his behavior and what he does to Andre. She's always wanted to be a fighter, but she gets into the managing world when she meets Andre. She sees in him the resilience and the passion, and the redemption that he's seeking, and it's something that appeals to her. And for the first time, she goes against her dad and stands for good.Q.Is there a cheat code that makes her a playable character?A.Oh my gosh, I should totally lie and say there is. Yeah, there's a secret password, so everyone buy the game and try to crack the code because there'll be a payoff on the other side. Ooh, child.Q.How was the experience of working on Fight Night Champion different from other games you've been involved in?A.I hadn't done anything like it. I've done other video-game voices: I started with the Buffy video game, and then I did Saints Row, Yakuza and Wet. I grew up with three older brothers and today my two nephews and my boyfriend's son are video-game-freak teenagers, so it's cool to be able to have them play me. You've got to connect any way you can with teenagers today."

2011-02-26T00:00:00Z,"Every elevator should be so clean. Not normally the case here, at 555 Roosevelt Drive in the Baruch Houses, the scarred, eastern face of the Lower East Side, its strips of peeling paint the size of loose-leaf paper. Here, the sight of a squeaky-clean elevator - generally treated as a urinal, ashtray and graffiti canvas - arouses suspicion: What happened? It has been almost two weeks since someone in the hallway pressed the button to go up, and the sliding doors opened to reveal the crumpled body of Jomali Morales, 42, a former model whose youthful beauty may have led the police at first to mistakenly put her age at 30. The floor was thick with her blood, and officers would later count 19 stab wounds. The murder was overshadowed by the unrelated citywide manhunt and arrest of a suspect in four other killings. But this case sent ripples through one particular city population: the New York Police Department. Ms. Morales's half-brother, Joseph Vitale, is a 20-year veteran police officer who, assigned to the Manhattan South Task Force, has worked the very area where she lost her life. Perhaps second only to the murder of a fellow officer, in terms of let's-find-this-guy determination, would be the murder of an officer's kid sister, and residents of 555 Roosevelt say detectives have been up and down its halls many times since Feb. 12. There is a $12,000 reward for information. But so far, no arrests and no known suspects. Murder leaves a crater that must be backfilled, starting at the topsoil of the final hours. She was celebrating a birthday she would never reach. She went to work that Friday, Feb. 11, at Just Calm Down, a boutique spa in Chelsea, as she had for almost a year, since returning to New York after a failed relationship in the upstate town of Scotia and moving in, along with her teenage daughter, with her mother on Grand Street. She had old friends from growing up in the neighborhood, and new friends from the spa, and she was starting her night with the latter. ''She told her daughter that she was going to go out with one of the girls from the job,'' said Ms. Morales's mother, Petra Montanez-Vitale. The police said Ms. Morales and others spent part of the night at O'Hanlon's, an Irish bar on East 14th Street. Her daughter, Constance, said she learned at the wake that her mother had met up with friends from high school and that she may have been thrown out of that bar, and may have visited another bar on Avenue C. Whatever dots exist between there and a grimy elevator hard by the F.D.R., Ms. Montanez-Vitale - a 70-year-old woman who refers to the killer as a ''demon'' - has yet to connect them. ''Jomali told her daughter, 'Don't go near the projects,' '' she said. ''And that's not nice to say. There are good people there, and they just can't get out.'' She sighed and repeated a complaint that good people there have made for years: ''There was no cameras at all.'' That Friday night, Ms. Morales did not come home. The next morning, her half-brother - who was 6 when she was born and has only ever thought of her as his sister, not half anything - was doing what many police officers were doing that day: searching for or chasing or cleaning up after Maksim Gelman, the Brooklyn man wanted in a rampage that by its end left four people dead and four wounded. Officer Vitale was securing part of a crime scene when he was called down to the Seventh Precinct station house on Pitt Street. He thought he was in some kind of trouble. The body in the elevator had no identification, and the victim's family was able to confirm she had an Asian-script tattoo that her mother never liked. ''It's supposed to be, in their language, 'beautiful,' '' Ms. Montanez-Vitale said. Ms. Morales's purse was found amid litter in a patch of grass near the front door of the building. The police estimate her time of death to have been a bit before 5 a.m. on Saturday. She had no history with drugs, just a drunken-driving arrest from her time in Scotia. Her family still wonders why she was at the Baruch Houses. She would have been 43 on Sunday."

''Spidermann,'' which was presented earlier this year in Seattle, is the handiwork of Jose Bold, the stage name of the artist John Osebold, and is described in a press release as ''a hastily-constructed abstract musical'' that ''threads together elements of the original comic book story, references to the buzz-heavy Broadway debacle, songs stripped down to their essential core, and dreamlike video sequences to create a new mythology in an art-house style.'' The cast includes Mr. Osebold as the title character; Kirk Anderson as his alter ego, Peter Parkre; Erin Jorgensen and Sara Edwards, who both play the character Mary Jane Taymor; Mark Siano as Radioactive Steve Winwood; and Evan Mosher as Everyone Else."

2011-02-27T18:22:17Z,"Dean Baker has a deeply enlightening analysis of state pension shortfalls (pdf), containing a lot of stuff I didn't know. The basic moral is that the official story these days -- of years and years of huge giveaways to unions, resulting in gigantic, unpayable debts -- is just wrong: to a very large extent, the pension shortfall has emerged just since 2007, thanks to the financial crisis, and even then it's not nearly as big relative to future state incomes as widely imagined. Here's a key figure:"

2011-02-27T17:46:06Z,"I hope to be watching the Oscars tonight, at least the red carpet. It starts around 1 a.m. here. Meanwhile, Milan's obsession with the movies this season persists. The music for Missoni this afternoon came from ""True Romance"" and ""Natural Born Killers,"" and the chaotic, pastel clothes brought to mind Juliette Lewis, though not specifically her character in the Oliver Stone film. The mood was girlish innocence verging to girlish wreck, with long silk-print and knit dresses, impressively fat cardigans, and maxi coats in multi-hued python. The colors seem to flood from a girl's bedroom, or the bathrooms of a 1960s subdivision: baby yellow, mint green, pink, and violet. Angela Missoni threw them together, sometimes causing one to cringe (example: a crinkly violet knit pants outfit with a sick twinkle of Lurex). It was strong and little perverse, thanks to the pastel upchuck. The accessories also pointed to bad movie girls: floppy knit caps and adorable motorcycle boots in a collage of python and colors."

A veteran Australian stage actress, Ms. Weaver hadn't been in a movie in a dozen years and was unknown in the U.S. until she starred in ""Animal Kingdom,"" the Australian indie crime drama from a first-time filmmaker that earned her a best supporting actress nomination. She has been a petite charmer on the circuit all season long. We spoke to her at a party for Sony Pictures Classics, the film's distributor, on Saturday, and she revealed a bit of country pride. ""It's the first time an Australian has been nominated in an Australian film since 'Shine,'"" she said. Her Australian-designed gown had arrived only hours before, and it, too, was a Cinderella moment. ""It takes about six able-bodied people to lift me into my frock,"" she said. ""I'm going to have to lean on my husband walking up the red carpet."" As a first-time nominee, Ms. Weaver had no problem admitting that she really, really wanted to win, and sharing details of her acceptance speech strategy."

It's a hoary old chestnut, but who can blame her for the reminder? She certainly lives up to her claim on stage. Despite having buried her mother the day before and awakened at 4 a.m. to fly from her native Oklahoma for an afternoon taping of ''Letterman,'' Jackson belied her exhaustion and charmed the Broadway audience, closing the show with her bawdy 1958 hit, ''Fujiyama Mama.''

2011-02-27T00:00:00Z,"In the 1980s, when he was at the height of his fame and maybe his powers, too, Albert Hadley had the opposite of a public relations problem. Just when you thought the commissions couldn't get any grander, Parish-Hadley Associates, the decorating firm he ran with his partner Sister Parish, was tapped by the Duchess of York, who had fallen in love with their work at the Connecticut home of Barbara Allen, the former model and Andy Warhol moll. The Duchess's mother-in-law -- that would be the queen -- ultimately put the kibosh on using a foreign designer at Sunninghill Park, the Yorks' pile near Windsor Castle, and Nina Campbell took sloppy seconds. But from a publicity point of view, it was probably even better that they didn't do Sunninghill than if they had. People calling the office back then to commission not just Hadley but also his lieutenants, who included Gary Hager, David Kleinberg and Brian McCarthy, were not encouraged. ''We're very busy!'' (God help you if you wanted Mrs. Parish herself.) Usually it's the client who signs off on the vendor, but those who made it past the switchboard and weren't named Getty or Whitney had to submit to an interview. In the early '90s, two decades after Hadley decorated Glenn Bernbaum's town house, it still riled Bernbaum, the original owner of Mortimer's, that he had had to be vetted."

Martin is among an emerging group of innovative jewelry designers creating achingly cool collections that are singularly English.

They can even be eaten raw. But like so many other venerable foods, oatmeal has been roundly abused by food marketers for more than 40 years. Now, McDonald's is doing everything it can to turn oatmeal into yet another bad choice. ''Cream'' (which contains seven ingredients, two of them actual dairy) is automatically added; brown sugar is ostensibly optional, but it's also added routinely.

The molten silver eye at Prada's spring show seemed exactly that -- a hothouse exotic that wouldn't survive outside a fashion show. Not so, according to Pat McGrath, who created the look and also employed silver at Valentino and Galliano. ''Metallics are unique, modern and chic,'' she says. ''But most of all, they are completely wearable on every skin tone.'' For an evening out, she suggests using Laura Mercier's intense Foiled Eye Color in V.I.P. Silver on the lid, keeping the color centered, rather than extending up to the brow, and following with black liquid liner and mascara. For day, try Covergirl Smoky ShadowBlast in Silver Sky from the lash line to the browbone, and finish with two coats of mascara.

2011-02-27T00:00:00Z,"The harmonium's undulating sound is mostly associated with the music of the Indian subcontinent, and less so with rock 'n' roll. Except, that is, when it's in the hands of Shilpa Ray, a first-generation American of Indian descent. Since escaping her conservative parents (her father banned Western music in their home) and moving to New York about nine years ago, she has hauled the unusual instrument to gigs to accompany her honey-toned wail of a voice. The sound is Patti Smith meets Nick Cave, both of whom she's played with. And with a big tour (with her band, Her Happy Hookers) kicking off in March, there's plenty of hard-core bellows-pumping ahead."

2011-02-27T00:00:00Z,"Tahar Rahim sat at a small table in the bar of the Hôtel Lutetia, an elegant, century-old pile of early-Art Deco opulence in the St.-Germain section of Paris. The Lutetia, a magnet for artists and bohemians in its early years, was a headquarters for German officers during the occupation and then served, after the war, as a repatriation center for returning deportees. Now it is a gathering place for international business travelers and the occasional French movie star. Rahim, a fine-boned man of 29, with hyperactive eyebrows and a friendly, energetic manner, fits the category, even as he may also end up redefining it. Born in 1981 to Algerian immigrant parents in the small city of Belfort in eastern France, Rahim, a year after winning two César awards for his electrifying lead performance in Jacques Audiard's prison drama ''A Prophet,'' is about to blow up everywhere, with five very different movies coming soon to French cinemas, possibly to Cannes and even to American multiplexes."

Born in Rochester, NY on May 24, 1943 and raised in Raleigh, NC she was the daughter of the late Thomas Clarkson Worth and Barbara Luther Worth. She is survived by her children Alison Foster Reining (Michael) of Midlothian, VA and Archibald M. Foster III (GiGi) of Locust Valley, NY; grandchildren Hailey, Charlotte, and Andrew Reining, and Trilby Foster; and four brothers. Mrs. Foster touched many lives while pursuing her multiple passions including the culinary arts, art history, travel and theatre. While a southerner until the end, she drank in the culture and energy of the City and was truly a New Yorker at heart. The Metropolitan Museum of Art was a happy thread woven into her life for over 36 years. After joining the weekend volunteers answering questions at the front desk, her passion grew and that task evolved into giving tours of American paintings and sculpture, French and English decorative arts, finally coming to rest on the Impressionists. Hers was a tour not to be missed. She recently mentioned that her years as a docent at the Met ""enriched my brain but, most of all, enriched my soul."" A new chapter in her life threw open doors to fresh adventures (including a trip to Hudson Bay to observe polar bears), a number of dear new friends, and a long career in development at the Japan Society. Her many years there instilled in her an appreciation of Eastern tradition and a deep love of Japanese culture. Her shorter career as the director of development at St. Vincent's hospital gave her other, very different insights as well as an appreciation of the sacrifices men and women make to care for the indigent. A memorial service was held for Mrs. Foster at The Brick Church on 92nd and Park, on Friday, February 25."

2011-02-27T00:00:00Z,"EARL--Consuelo Vanderbilt, a great-great-granddaughter of Commodore Cornelius Vanderbilt, died on February 21, 2011, at the age of 107. Mrs. Earl was a long-time resident of Ridgefield, CT. Commodore Vanderbilt was an American financier who amassed a great fortune in railroad and shipping interests and founded the Vanderbilt family in this country. Mrs. Earl's father, William Kissam Vanderbilt, Jr., like his father, William Kissam Vanderbilt, was President of the New York Central Railroad. Her mother, Virginia Graham Fair, was the daughter of United States Senator James G. Fair of Nevada, a forty-niner from the time of the California gold rush and one of the ""Silver Kings"" who developed the Comstock Lode in Nevada. Mrs. Earl was devoted to the welfare of animals and was a prominent breeder of skye terriers. She was the widow of N. Clarkson Earl, Jr., who died in 1969. Mrs. Earl's first marriage was to the late Earl E. T. Smith, who was United States Ambassador to Cuba when Fidel Castro came to power. Mrs. Earl is survived by her daughter from her marriage to Ambassador Smith, Virginia Consuelo Smith Burke of Palm Beach, FL, seven grandchildren and 18 great-grandchildren. Her daughter, Iris Smith Christ, predeceased her. Funeral service and burial will be private. In lieu of flowers, contributions to the Animal Medical Center, 510 East 62nd St, New York, NY 10021 or Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center, 1275 York Ave., New York, NY 10065, would be appreciated."

2011-02-27T00:00:00Z,"Salma Hayek is getting down to business. She has just arrived at our photo shoot in Paris, makeup-free, hair bundled up into a Rasta-like knitted cap, and now she's sitting next to the photographer on the couch, going through pictures they're using as reference points. The Xeroxed photos are provocatively sexy -- Romy Schneider looking pained and delirious, Catherine Deneuve pulling her camisole down for Helmut Newton, a bare-bottomed model leaning over a fur coat on a balcony -- but this seems to bother Hayek not at all. She examines them almost as if she were the producer of the shoot rather than the subject. There is (as is customary) a slight nervousness in the room about what she will turn out to be like to work with, what she will or won't agree to. First of all, she apologizes: most of these images are of women with cigarettes dangling from their lips, but she has a rule about not smoking in pictures. Fine; a lit match is decided upon instead. With all eyes on her, she continues to leaf through until she gets to the naked backside. She stops, and briskly slaps the pile of pictures down on her lap."

2011-02-27T00:00:00Z,"SCHLESINGER--Hans L.,age 100, of Hanover, NH, and formerly of Great Neck, NY, on February 18, 2011. He was born on December 15, 1910, in Hamburg, Germany, to Emil and Flora (Strelitz) Schlesinger. After a childhood affected by World War I, he attended high school and business school. He began work in chemical exports in 1930, first in Hamburg, later in Brussels. Hans met his future wife, Luise (""Liesel"") Judith Benzian, also a Hamburg native, in 1934. Married in London on May 7, 1939, they returned to Belgium, their lives upended by the German invasion of May 1940, with Hans and Liesel being separated for almost one year, including time Hans spent in a Vichy detention camp. With help from family, the American consulate, and the American Friends Service Committee, they were reunited in Marseilles in spring 1941. Immigration visas granted, they journeyed to the New York area, where they lived until 1996. In 1950, he and the late Ed Gallard founded the Gallard-Schlesinger companies, also specializing in chemical exports and imports. He remained active in business well into his eighties, even after he sold his company. Hans and Liesel subsequently divided their time between a beloved southern Vermont vacation home and the Kendal community at Hanover. Hans was preceded in death by his parents, by brothers Richard and R. Walter, and by Liesel in 2006. He is survived by his son, Peter (Denise), and his granddaughter, Amanda, of St. Paul, MN; and by his extended family. He is fondly remembered by his family; and by friends and acquaintances from his business and personal lives. Heartfelt thanks to the medical and nursing staff of Kendal at Hanover; and to caregivers Candace, Wendy, Emily, Janice, and Lois.

While the decision has some critics crying ''nanny state,'' others believe that the new rules will encourage an emphasis on quality.

2011-02-27T00:00:00Z,"When I return from the collections each season, my friends invariably ask me to tell them what they need. They don't need anything, of course, which is what I tell them; and then the discussion turns to what they want and what they'll obsess over, save for and, casting aside any notions of reason or utility, splurge on. Fashion, for women, is not a straightforward business: we love things that make us feel new and strange, we love things that return us to essential selves, and we really love things that magically do both. This spring, for example, I adore the new minimal take on evening (see Terry Richardson's ''The Night Shift,'' Page 166 ) because it looks like nothing in my closet yet nods to my lifelong romance with offhand, sensual clothes. And, for much the same reason, I also love the haphazard, layered boudoir-street-chic (Collier Schorr's ''Early Birds,'' Page 122) that couldn't appear more different. Trends mean very little: real style is personal and complicated and (hopefully) fun. The women featured in this issue understand this all too well. What we love about Salma Hayek, Rinko Kikuchi, Alexa Chung, Rachel Feinstein and Lykke Li, to list only a few, is that they are not defined solely by what they do or what they wear or even how they live. They defy categorization, and the choices they make -- to be journalists, musicians, muses, actresses, artists and moms -- always seem to nod to their pasts while moving vigorously forward."

The child of a German mother and a Panamanian-Chinese father, Nunez, 59, has always lived in Gotham, despite short stints beyond the pale. ''I'm beginning to feel like New York is more a place to visit than to live,'' she said. ''If you told me that at 20 or 30 or 40, I would've thought you were mad. I always thought I would feel the way Susan felt: that it was really the only place.''"

The sponsor may be entitled to an increase for units that are occupied by regulated tenants; the right to an increase does not end once the building is converted.

2011-02-27T00:00:00Z,"I was a virgin when I met Marcus Antebi, a co-owner of the Juice Press, a tiny temple to organic fruit and veggie elixirs and raw food in Manhattan's East Village. A juice virgin, that is. Sure, I'd toyed with the idea of trying one of Organic Avenue's prettily packaged potions at Fashion Week last season. (They were conveniently available to the thin and wanting-to-be-thinner at Lincoln Center's Alice Tully Hall.) But about the closest I'd gotten to fresh juice up to that point was the O.J. in a good mimosa. As for raw food, well, I thought that meant those cute precut, packaged carrot and celery sticks you get from the corner deli. When I arrived at the Juice Press the first time, it was crammed with lithe young things (the model Erin Wasson swears by the maca tonic) buying concoctions like Drink Your Salad and Ginger Fireball. Immediately I felt pasty, pudgy and distinctly unhealthy. Antebi, an intense 42-year-old with a shaved head and myriad tattoos, introduced himself and gave me a quick once-over. Something about him made me want to fess up all of my sins, at least the ones that involve eating and drinking. Before I could stop myself, I blurted out, ''Hi, my name is Sandra, and I'm a meat-wine-cheese-choco-holic.'' He didn't even smile. He simply said, ''I'm going to change your life.''"

2011-02-27T00:00:00Z,"I first met Susan Sontag in spring, 1976, when she was recovering from cancer surgery and needed someone to help type her correspondence. I had been recommended by the editors of The New York Review of Books, where I'd worked as an editorial assistant. I had recently finished graduate school at Columbia and was living on West 106th Street, not far from Susan's apartment at 340 Riverside Drive. We worked in her bedroom, I at her desk, typing on her massive I.B.M. Selectric while she dictated, either pacing the room or lying on her bed. I remember being surprised at how laid-back and chatty she was, much more like someone my own age than someone of my mother's generation. But she was always this way with young people, and I would discover there wasn't the usual generational distance between her and her son, either. A year younger than I, David, who'd dropped out of Amherst, had recently returned to school and was now a sophomore at Princeton. He had a place to stay in Princeton, but most of the week he lived with his mother. His (soon to be our) bedroom was right next to hers."

Not done right, they can trip you up or deprive you of an Olympic medal, as might have happened to the notorious ice-skater Tonya Harding in 1994. Nowadays, shoemakers use newfangled ways to make shoes secure, such as velcro fasteners or new space-age materials that need no fasteners at all.

Though the hosts, James Franco and Anne Hathaway, joked about being the ""hip"" Oscars from the start of the show and then acted on it -- Mr. Franco unleashed a torrent of backstage Twitter posts, and Ms. Hathaway mentioned drinking games -- their performance drew decidedly mixed reviews, especially when compared with the riffing of the 94-year-old Kirk Douglas. The ""Auto-Tune the News"" segment was a bit of a head-scratcher. And the use of the fifth-grade choir from Staten Island's P.S. 22, a YouTube sensation known for its renditions of pop and indie songs, was denuded by singing ""Somewhere Over the Rainbow"" as the credits rolled. Don't get us wrong, it was still cute (and the shot of Melissa Leo singing along was sweet, especially after she dropped an obscenity in her remarks accepting her Supporting Actress Oscar).

The best picture win for ""The King's Speech,"" and the corresponding win for Tom Hooper as best director over ""The Social Network"" and David Fincher, will be fussed over by critics and bloggers as a return to the Academy's staid tastes. It could equally be called a win for Harvey Weinstein's aggressive campaigning - an unusually superstitious Mr. Weinstein pulled out every stop short of calling in the Queen to promote his comeback film; oh wait, he did get her seal of approval, along with Rupert Murdoch's.

The Oscars did the job, but then again, they had an awful lot of good movies to work with. At least eight of the movies were worthy of best picture in one way or another, and there were enough twists and turns to keep the show interesting. Can't say the same about the hosts, who were really a host, namely Anne Hathaway. She gamely soldiered along while James Franco did, um, what exactly? Mr. Franco tweeted about doing the Oscars, made movies about doing the Oscars, gave many interviews about being a host, but when it came time to do the actual Oscars, he entered the witness protection program. Perhaps we should draw some satisfaction from the fact that this time around, it was the man who had the job of standing there and looking pretty.

2011-02-28T00:00:00Z,"YOSWEIN--Leonard E. Family, friends, and co-workers mourn the death of Hon. Leonard E. Yoswein, born September 8, 1920 in Manhattan. After a long and distinguished life of public service, he died on February 25, 2011. Judge Yoswein's career began at age 16 when he managed father Adolph Yoswein's tuxedo rental shop after his father was injured. He graduated from Brooklyn College, then enlisted in the United States Army Air Forces during World War II and served as a Captain on the China/India/Burma Route as a navigator, assisting in development of early LORAN navigation systems. Upon his return, Judge Yoswein received his J.D. from NYU Law School and has been a member of the New York State Bar since 1949. Early career pursuits focused on labor law, before he began a lengthy career in public service. From 1961-1968 Judge Yoswein represented the Canarsie area in the New York State Assembly as a liberal Democrat. His humanitarian nature led him to a role as Chairman of the Assembly Mental Health Committee as well as focusing on initiatives like creating more open access to adoption in the state. Elected to the New York City Civil Court in 1969, he later left the bench and served New York City as ""Compassionate"" Commissioner of the New York City Department of Rent and Housing Maintenance, leading the city's efforts to ensure adequate heating in public housing during the Arab oil crisis. In 1975 he was Executive Assistant to the Mayor of the City of New York for Intergovernmental Affairs. In 1976 Judge Yoswein was elected to the Kings County Supreme Court and was most recognized as Administrative Justice of the New York State Supreme Court for Brooklyn and Staten Island, presiding over headline gathering trials including the arraignment of David Berkowitz (Son of Sam) and trial of P. O. Robert Torsney. After retiring from the Supreme Court in 1997, he continued as an Administrative Law Judge for the U.S. Social Security Administration. Easily recognized with his van dyke, bright blue eyes, and broad smile, and clad in his preferred cut-offs and casual attire, he always knew how to have fun, while guiding and supporting family, friends, and co-workers. But his primary mission was justice with compassion, over a long and distinguished career. He is survived by daughter Rebecca J. Yoswein; grandchildren Kelly and Sean McGreen; beloved companion Hon. Sarah ""Sallie"" Krauss; sister Renee Zeiger (Bernie), sister-in-law Martha Yoswein. Predeceased by daughter Kathie I. Yoswein and brother David J. Yoswein, as well as Dorothy Yoswein. Services will be held at Boulevard-Riverside Chapel, 1895 Flatbush Avenue, Brooklyn, New York on March 1, at 11:00am."
