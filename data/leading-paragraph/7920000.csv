2016-03-11T00:00:00Z,"WELLISZ--Stanislaw, Columbia Economist Who Aided Poland's Revival. Stanislaw H. Wellisz, a Polish- born economist and longtime Columbia University professor who helped guide his native country's transition from communism to capitalism, died in New York on February 28. He was 90. Prof. Wellisz specialized in development economics, a field that satisfied his fascination with world cultures and his deep desire to help the poor. He helped draw up a new tariff structure for Nepal, advised city planners in Calcutta and Istanbul, and evaluated World Bank programs in Tanzania. Closer to home, he sought to identify opportunities to start minority businesses as director of the Harlem Development Project from 1968-1969. It was to Poland that he devoted most of his energy. He returned time and again, twice serving as a visiting professor and sending his two sons to summer camps there. He often said his desire to rebuild postwar Poland motivated him to study economics. After Poland threw off communist rule in 1989, Prof. Wellisz served as an advisor to the Solidarity-led government on a successful program of economic ''shock therapy.'' From 1991 to 1997, he taught at the University of Warsaw, helping train a generation of postcommunist economists who moved into important roles in government, academia and business. He was awarded an honorary doctorate from the university as well as the Order of Poland's Rebirth (Polonia Restituta), the nation's highest civilian honor. Prof. Wellisz was born in Warsaw on March 28, 1925. His family fled Poland as German and Soviet troops invaded in 1939 and settled in New York City, where he attended Trinity School. He graduated Magna Cum Laude from Harvard University, where he also earned a PhD after spending two years as a Fulbright Fellow at the University of Cambridge. He was the author of ''The Economies of the Soviet Bloc'' and served as chairman of Columbia's renowned economics department in 1977-82. Prof. Wellisz was fluent in French, Italian and English as well as his native Polish, and his varied intellectual interests ranged from anthropology and literature through art and architecture. He was an avid skier and outdoorsman who loved mushroom hunting and canoeing and a charming story teller who regaled listeners with tales of obscure people and happenings in distant lands. He is survived by his two sons, Tadeusz and Christopher; a nephew, Michael Temmer; and four grandchildren. His remains will be laid to rest at the Lutheran cemetery in Warsaw. 1/3"

2016-03-13T00:00:00Z,"WELLISZ--Stanislaw, Columbia Economist Who Aided Poland's Revival. Stanislaw H. Wellisz, a Polish- born economist and longtime Columbia University professor who helped guide his native country's transition from communism to capitalism, died in New York on February 28. He was 90. Prof. Wellisz specialized in development economics, a field that satisfied his fascination with world cultures and his deep desire to help the poor. He helped draw up a new tariff structure for Nepal, advised city planners in Calcutta and Istanbul, and evaluated World Bank programs in Tanzania. Closer to home, he sought to identify opportunities to start minority businesses as director of the Harlem Development Project from 1968-1969. It was to Poland that he devoted most of his energy. He returned time and again, twice serving as a visiting professor and sending his two sons to summer camps there. He often said his desire to rebuild postwar Poland motivated him to study economics. After Poland threw off communist rule in 1989, Prof. Wellisz served as an advisor to the Solidarity-led government on a successful program of economic ''shock therapy.'' From 1991 to 1997, he taught at the University of Warsaw, helping train a generation of postcommunist economists who moved into important roles in government, academia and business. He was awarded an honorary doctorate from the university as well as the Order of Poland's Rebirth (Polonia Restituta), the nation's highest civilian honor. Prof. Wellisz was born in Warsaw on March 28, 1925. His family fled Poland as German and Soviet troops invaded in 1939 and settled in New York City, where he attended Trinity School. He graduated Magna Cum Laude from Harvard University, where he also earned a PhD after spending two years as a Fulbright Fellow at the University of Cambridge. He was the author of ''The Economies of the Soviet Bloc'' and served as chairman of Columbia's renowned economics department in 1977-82. Prof. Wellisz was fluent in French, Italian and English as well as his native Polish, and his varied intellectual interests ranged from anthropology and literature through art and architecture. He was an avid skier and outdoorsman who loved mushroom hunting and canoeing and a charming story teller who regaled listeners with tales of obscure people and happenings in distant lands. He is survived by his two sons, Tadeusz and Christopher; a nephew, Michael Temmer; and four grandchildren. His remains will be laid to rest at the Lutheran cemetery in Warsaw. 1/3"

He served on numerous Board Committees but above all he was dedicated to building the collection. As Chair successively of the Photography and Drawing Acquisition Committees, Steve stewarded the Museum's collection with curiosity, a keen eye, a deep understanding of the Whitney's mission and a commitment to new art. He and his wife Ann gave dozens of works to the collection by artists including: George Condo, Mark Grotjahn, Roni Horn, Matthew Barney and Hiroshi Sugimoto. Steve was a quiet presence and a thoughtful leader yet with a strong voice. His many contributions to the Whitney on behalf of the artists he championed will be missed but not forgotten. We are immensely proud that Steve's legacy will also continue through the establishment of the Steven and Ann Ames Curator of Drawings--a position he endowed in 2012. We extend our most heartfelt sympathy to his devoted wife Ann, children David and Marja Ames, Adam and Elissa Ames, David and Linna Sica, his three beloved grandchildren, extended family and many friends with whom he shared his life.

2016-03-17T00:00:00Z,"AMES--Steven. The Board and Staff of the Whitney Museum of American Art express with profound sadness the passing of beloved Trustee Steven Ames. A passionate collector and supporter of the arts, Steve served as a Trustee of the Whitney Museum for nearly two decades. He served on numerous Board Committees but above all he was dedicated to building the collection. As Chair successively of the Photography and Drawing Acquisition Committees, Steve stewarded the Museum's collection with curiosity, a keen eye, a deep understanding of the Whitney's mission and a commitment to new art. He and his wife Ann gave dozens of works to the collection by artists including: George Condo, Mark Grotjahn, Roni Horn, Matthew Barney and Hiroshi Sugimoto. Steve was a quiet presence and a thoughtful leader yet with a strong voice. His many contributions to the Whitney on behalf of the artists he championed will be missed but not forgotten. We are immensely proud that Steve's legacy will also continue through the establishment of the Steven and Ann Ames Curator of Drawings--a position he endowed in 2012. We extend our most heartfelt sympathy to his devoted wife Ann, children David and Marja Ames, Adam and Elissa Ames, David and Linna Sica, his three beloved grandchildren, extended family and many friends with whom he shared his life.

2016-03-20T00:00:00Z,"COHEN--Shirlene Gewirtz, a ballerina who performed under the stage name Shirlene Starr, died of natural causes on February 25, 2016. In the 1950s and early 1960s, Shirlene danced with the Metropolitan Opera Ballet and performed in musical theater. In 1956-57, she performed in the Broadway and national touring productions of the hit musical Fanny. In 1959, she played Jeanie Maclaren against Doretta Morrow's Fiona in a production of Brigadoon reviving the Broadway cast; her dance solo was widely praised in the press. She also played lead dance roles in several summer stock productions, including Carousel, Oklahoma and The King and I. Her TV credits included Firestone TV Theatre and The Jackie Gleason TV Show. She also modeled in print and TV ads for Revlon, Capezio, Helena Rubinstein and others. Her love of ballet began at age 12, when she participated in a free summer dance program in the city park on Coney Island. She received scholarships to continue her training, and began dancing professionally at age 17. She loved recounting the story of how a famous Broadway producer hand-picked her for Fanny at the first audition because she ""looked French"" in her all-black outfit. This allowed her to skip the voice auditions - a stroke of luck, because Shirlene just couldn't sing. Daughter of Joseph Gewirtz and Doris Levy Gewirtz, Shirlene grew up in Brooklyn and graduated from Thomas Jefferson High School. In 1958, she married Jay Richard Cohen of Cedarhurst, NY. The two were inseparable, pursuing numerous hobbies, including bird- watching, photography, tennis and golf, as well as ballroom and swing dancing. They danced together almost every night. Shirlene never stopped dancing. She did her ballet barre exercises every day throughout her life, and even in her late 70s was known to spontaneously perform the solo from Swan Lake on command. A devoted full-time mother, she was an energetic supporter of everything her four children did. She's survived by her husband Richard, their four children and their spouses/partners - Glenn Cohen (Rabbi Melinda Panken), Robin Cohen (Dan Russell), Guy Cohen (Luisa Tedoff Cohen) and June Cohen (Deron Triff) - as well as her brother Bernard Gewirtz and four grandchildren. Donations in her name are appreciated by the family and can be made to the National Dance Institute, which brings free dance programs to city kids: www.national dance.org/ support.htm 1/3"

2016-03-23T00:00:00Z,"ASHFORTH--Alden Banning, 82, of New Orleans, LA, composer and professor, died of heart failure on January 29, 2016. He was born in New York City, the son of Henry Adams Ashforth and Mariana Richardson Ashforth. He spent his childhood in Manhattan, NY, Greenwich, CT, and Deering, NH, and graduated from St. Paul's School, Concord, NH. He received an AB and B. Music from Oberlin College and a MFA and Ph.D. from Princeton University. With interests ranging from classical to jazz to electronic music, he was an instructor at Princeton, Oberlin, NYU, CUNY, and a professor of music at UCLA (1967-98) where he also coordinated the electronic music studio. He was a composer of numerous instrumental, vocal and electronic works, including Episodes (1962), The Unquiet Heart (1968), Big Bang (1970), Byzantia (1971), Aspects of Love (1978), Christmas Motets (1980), The Miraculous Bugle (1989) and Palimpsests (1997). With his friend David Wyckoff, he recorded and produced sessions of traditional New Orleans jazz. In the early 1950's he produced Dauphine Street Jam Session Vol. 1 and 2 (1951, 1952) with Emile Barnes' bands and the Kid Clayton Sessions (1952), all released by Folkways, 1983 and acquired by the Smithsonian. Two further Barnes sessions were recorded in 1951, one headed by Kid Thomas; both were released on the American Music label. His recordings of New Orleans marching bands, such as The Eureka Brass Band (1952, American Music), Doc Paulin's Marching Band (1982, Smithsonian) and The Eagle Brass Band (1984, GHB Records), are considered classics. Active as a jazz researcher, he contributed to the Annual Review of Jazz Studies and to The New Grove Dictionary of Jazz. He also wrote articles on classical music in Perspectives of New Music (on Schoenberg) and The Music Review (on Beethoven).

2016-03-23T00:00:00Z,"CHARNEY--Leon H. 78, resident of New York City, passed quietly in his sleep on March 21, 2016. He is survived by his loving wife Tzilia and their two beloved sons, Nati and Mickey, his sister Bryna and her husband Lenny Dreyer, niece Sheri and her husband Yigal Kimmelman, nephew Jay and his wife Nehama Blumenrich and niece Eleana and husband Lior Sharon. He was preceded in death by his brother Herbert. Leon was born on July 23, 1938 in Bayonne, New Jersey to Morris and Sara Charney. Renowned as a lawyer, author, broadcaster, real estate mogul, political advisor and philanthropist - but the self- made billionaire's rise to international prominence is truly a tale of a man living out the ""American Dream."" With just $200 in the bank and an entrepreneurial spirit, Charney started his own law firm representing sports and show business personalities. That same spirit, combined with good judgment and creativity, led Charney to success in New York City's highly competitive world of finance and investment. Ranked by ""Forbes"" as among the wealthiest Americans and named by ""Bloomberg Business Week"" as one of twenty billionaires who started with nothing, Charney was not your ordinary billionaire. Considered to be among the foremost authorities on Middle East affairs, Charney first entered the realm of politics as a Special Counsel to Sen. Vance Hartke of Indiana. In the decades that followed, Charney developed a reputation as an expert in the complex realm of domestic and foreign politics. ""Leon Charney is one of the unsung heroes of the Middle East peace process... Very few people have played as significant a role. Leon Charney understands the complexities of foreign politics,"" said President Jimmy Carter. In response to requests from President Carter and Israeli Defense Minister Ezer Weizman, Charney served as a backdoor channel to assist Israel and Egypt in putting together a workable document that ultimately led to the 1978 Camp David Peace Accords and thereafter the historic Camp David Peace Agreement. An accomplished author, Charney has written four books: ""Battle of the Two Talmuds,"" ""The Charney Report: Confronting the Arab-Israeli Conflict,"" ""The Mystery of the Kaddish"" and ""Back Door Channels: The Price of Peace"" - which formed the basis for the critically acclaimed documentary film of the same name. For more than 20 years, Charney has moderated ""The Leon Charney Report,"" an award-winning, nationally televised program featuring one-on-one interviews with some of the best and brightest from around the world. Charney was the recipient of many awards, including four honorary doctorate degrees. A noted philanthropist, Charney was the major benefactor of the University of Haifa's Leon H. Charney School of Marine Sciences and he donated millions to New York University Medical Center for a new cardiac wing of the hospital. Above all, Leon took great pride in his well-known cantorial skills that he shared upon request of those participants of the Garment Center Congregation. The funeral will take place in Israel on Friday 15th od Adar Bet, March 25, 2016 at 12:00pm at the Raanar Kfar Naham Cemetery.

He was born the son of Carroll and Harriet (Fera) French on June 20, 1928, in Jersey City, NJ. He grew up mainly in Scarsdale, NY, but also attended the Punahou School in Hawaii and graduated from the Lakeside School in Seattle, WA. He graduated from Yale College in 1950 and Harvard Law School in 1956. His strong belief in a citizen's responsibility to perform public service led him to enlist in the army during the Korean War. Fluent in German, he was assigned to Army Counterintelligence in Austria (1951-54). For many years he practiced business and corporate law in New York City at Dewey Ballantine and Reid & Priest and served as Assistant General Counsel at American Can Company in Connecticut. After retiring to New Hampshire, he taught business law as adjunct faculty at Keene State (1988-1993). His extensive volunteer work included serving as Commercial Law Liaison on an American Bar Association project in Albania for five months to help set up a democratic legal system after the fall of the Iron Curtain, as treasurer of the Board of Trustees of Planned Parenthood of Northern New England, as an arbitrator on the National Association of Securities Dealers Board of Arbitration, as chairman of the Langdon Zoning Board of Adjustment, and as corporate secretary of the Alstead Historical Society. In 2000-2001 he was on the Sullivan County Study Committee appointed by the County Delegation to make recommendations concerning the County government. Formerly a moderate Republican, he became a registered Democrat in 1998 and enjoyed working with the Sullivan County Democratic Committee for many years. He ran twice for the state senate without success but was elected to be Sullivan County Treasurer in 2008. During these years he was also a partner in a small dairy operation in Alstead, bidding in cow auctions and keeping the books. Dave read three newspapers daily and contributed many letters to the editor on far-ranging issues, but mainly urging reforms for a better-functioning government. Being a good steward of his land, maintaining trails for hikers and hunters, boiling maple sap in his little sugar house, splitting wood, and reading before his woodstove engaged him into his eighties. He will be remembered by those who had the good fortune to know him for his amazing sense of humor, his commitment to doing the right thing, and his endless ability to argue his point. Survivors include his loving wife of 16 years: Marcia French; two daughters: Susan Fine and her husband Patrick of Sunapee, NH, and Reston, VA, Alice Jacobs and her husband Jeremy, Jr., of East Aurora, NY; four grandchildren: Joshua Fine, Zachary Fine, Melissa Jacobs, Jeremy Jacobs, III; brother: Alan French of Andover, MA; two nieces: Catherine French, Hilary French; nephew: Thomas French; three stepchildren: Leslie Golemme and her husband Brian of Norwell, MA, Brian Cooper of Foxboro, MA, Lise Anderheggen-Leif of Seattle; four step-grandchildren: Ryan, Isabella, and Cooper Golemme, Gabrielle Leif; and many other extended family members.

2016-03-23T00:00:00Z,"ISRAEL--Justin Bruce. Justin Bruce Israel was born in New York City on June 23, 1927 and died suddenly March 21, 2016 in Southampton Hospital. He was the beloved husband of Emel Glicksman sharing 17 years of joyful adventure together. He is survived by his brother, Charles Israel, wife Sandy and daughter, Linda. Justin was the devoted father of Johnny, Lynn and Jon, Diane and Lindsey, Rob and Renee. And loving stepfather of Cindy and Joseph, Sally and Nina. He was the grandfather extraordinaire of Jorin, Avi, Mason, Caden, and Kyla and step- grandfather of Henry and Zoe. Justin grew up in New York's Upper West Side attending Columbia Grammar School where he excelled and was admitted to Yale University at the age of 16, graduating in 1949 after a hiatus of military service. His love for business and passion for quality along with his razor sharp mind, launched him from his start at Regal Knitwear into a stellar career of 50 years as a entrepreneurial dean and industry leader in the Children's apparel business. He was co-founder of Justin Charles (with his brother Charles) and after a successful sale then founded another successful childrenswear business, Knitwaves. As the father of a child with severe developmental disabilities, Justin was passionate about raising money and awareness on behalf of those with development challenges. He served many roles at Westchester ARC, raised millions of dollars, and helped to fund the Gleeson-Israel Gateway Center in Westchester, NY. For Justin, there was no such thing as retirement and he was an extraordinary unrelenting public servant and fundraiser, a teacher of public service in his actions and deeds, and a leader and protector of the voiceless, the physically-challenged, and our endangered environment. His second career was as a volunteer fundraiser and philanthropist at numerous organizations, most notably Sierra Club, United Jewish Appeal, Fashion Institute of Technology and New York Public Media (WNET). The CEO of WNET described Justin as a dedicated volunteer for almost a decade. ""At 88 years young, Justin was a critical member of the Development Department."" His special fundraising strategy was telling donors, ""I am celebrating my 39th birthday for the 49th time."" We honor Justin as a role model and example of an avid athlete and lover of tennis, paddle tennis and biking and a patron of the arts, including a huge sponsor of the Pearl Theater-introducing theater followed by a high cholesterol meal at the Second Avenue Deli to numerous fans. Justin and Emel shared a passion for Opera and the New York City Ballet, Carnegie Hall and Bridge. They travelled all over the world but his favorite was the yearly visits to Istanbul and sailing the coast of Turkey with friends. He also cherished his beloved property in Vermont that he shared with his children since 1967. He will be remembered for his fearlessness, his love of life and the outdoors, his early care of the environment (he started recycling in the 1960's!) as well as his brilliant, razor-sharp mind, compassion and caring for others, willingness to take a stand, a passionate newspaper clipper and correspondent, deep caring for humanity and the good of the planet. His service and his concern for everyone around him knew no bounds and he never let up, not for a day. He was always thinking of ways to help others be their best selves. He loved, he gave, he taught, he shared, he lived, he was engaged, he made a difference, and his work will carry on. We love you forever and will miss you always. A memorial service for Justin will be held this Thursday, March 24th at 2pm at Frank E. Campbell - The Funeral Chapel (1076 Madison Avenue at 81st Street). Immediately following the service, Shiva will be held at Justin and Emel's apartment until 8pm on Thursday, and 5-8pm on Friday.

2016-03-24T00:00:00Z,"CHARNEY--Leon H. 78, resident of New York City, passed quietly in his sleep on March 21, 2016. He is survived by his loving wife Tzilia and their two beloved sons, Nati and Mickey, his sister Bryna and her husband Lenny Dreyer, niece Sheri and her husband Yigal Kimmelman, nephew Jay and his wife Nehama Blumenrich and niece Eleana and husband Lior Sharon. He was preceded in death by his brother Herbert. Leon was born on July 23, 1938 in Bayonne, New Jersey to Morris and Sara Charney. Renowned as a lawyer, author, broadcaster, real estate mogul, political advisor and philanthropist - but the self- made billionaire's rise to international prominence is truly a tale of a man living out the ""American Dream."" With just $200 in the bank and an entrepreneurial spirit, Charney started his own law firm representing sports and show business personalities. That same spirit, combined with good judgment and creativity, led Charney to success in New York City's highly competitive world of finance and investment. Ranked by ""Forbes"" as among the wealthiest Americans and named by ""Bloomberg Business Week"" as one of twenty billionaires who started with nothing, Charney was not your ordinary billionaire. Considered to be among the foremost authorities on Middle East affairs, Charney first entered the realm of politics as a Special Counsel to Sen. Vance Hartke of Indiana. In the decades that followed, Charney developed a reputation as an expert in the complex realm of domestic and foreign politics. ""Leon Charney is one of the unsung heroes of the Middle East peace process... Very few people have played as significant a role. Leon Charney understands the complexities of foreign politics,"" said President Jimmy Carter. In response to requests from President Carter and Israeli Defense Minister Ezer Weizman, Charney served as a backdoor channel to assist Israel and Egypt in putting together a workable document that ultimately led to the 1978 Camp David Peace Accords and thereafter the historic Camp David Peace Agreement. An accomplished author, Charney has written four books: ""Battle of the Two Talmuds,"" ""The Charney Report: Confronting the Arab-Israeli Conflict,"" ""The Mystery of the Kaddish"" and ""Back Door Channels: The Price of Peace"" - which formed the basis for the critically acclaimed documentary film of the same name. For more than 20 years, Charney has moderated ""The Leon Charney Report,"" an award-winning, nationally televised program featuring one-on-one interviews with some of the best and brightest from around the world. Charney was the recipient of many awards, including four honorary doctorate degrees. A noted philanthropist, Charney was the major benefactor of the University of Haifa's Leon H. Charney School of Marine Sciences and he donated millions to New York University Medical Center for a new cardiac wing of the hospital. Above all, Leon took great pride in his well-known cantorial skills that he shared upon request of those participants of the Garment Center Congregation. The funeral will take place in Israel on Friday 15th od Adar Bet, March 25, 2016 at 12:00pm at the Raanar Kfar Naham Cemetery. Sitting Shiva at the Charney Family Apartment Room 1545, Hilton Hotel, 205 Hayaryon Street, Tel Aviv. 1/3"

2016-03-24T00:00:00Z,"McKELLEN--John. Veteran music executive John McKellen died March 15 after a short illness in New York City. He was 85. A jazz aficionado, McKellen was particularly inclined toward bebop, and he became an authority on the works of Charlie Parker and Bud Powell. McKellen took an administrative position with Leeds Music in 1958, and stayed on with MCA after the company acquired Leeds Music in the early 1960s. He was appointed Vice President of MCA Music Publishing in 1973, Senior Vice President in 1982 and global President in 1992. He retired at the age of 65 in 1995. McKellen also served on the boards of ASCAP and the National Music Publishers Association. Born in London, he was evacuated to the country during World War II, along with many other young children at that time. Considered a member of the ""lower classes,"" he was sent to trade school rather than an academic high school, and became a bricklayer and plasterer. However, a lifelong love of music led to his immigration to the U.S. in 1952 to study the tenor saxophone with Lennie Tristano and eventually to his career as an executive in the music business. He is survived by his beloved wife, Tess McKellen; his daughter, Matilda (Garrido); his grandson Ander Dunseith Garrido; and many nieces and nephews.

2016-03-24T00:00:00Z,"FROST--Stevens Landon, died at home in Brunswick, Maine on March 15, 2016. He was born in New York City on January 5, 1920, and he grew up in Pleasantville, New York. He was the son of John William Frost, a lawyer in New York, mayor of Pleasantville, and long a board member of Bowdoin College, and Christina Gurlitz Frost, a member of the Harper publishing family. Steve Frost graduated from Bowdoin College in 1942. He was a hard working and loyal alumnus of the college and a proud member of the Alpha Delta Phi fraternity. He was a generous supporter of the Bowdoin College Museum of Art and the Bowdoin International Music Festival. During World War II Steve Frost served in the United States Army Air Corps as a crew member on B-29 aircraft. He was awarded two Distinguished Flying Crosses for bravery in action over enemy territory. After the war, Steve Frost entered the field of banking in New York City. He had season tickets to the Metropolitan Opera, was a member of the University Club of New York for over fifty years, and enjoyed restoring old houses, including Tiverton, the sea captain's house in Topsham, Maine which his great-great-grand father purchased in 1837. He retired in 1995 as a Trust Officer and Vice President at Citibank Corporation in Manhattan. Steve Frost was an avid sailor and won several regattas in Casco Bay during his college years. He was a member of the Cruising Club of America. He crossed the Atlantic in a 35-foot sailboat and then sailed around Sweden and Great Britain. Other sailing adventures took him to the coast of Labrador, to the French Islands of St. Pierre et Miquelon, to the British West Indies, and along the Atlantic coast from New York to Nova Scotia. Maine was always his favorite cruising ground. He often sailed with young family members, who learned to share his love of wind and sea.

Nick's leadership, friendship and, most importantly, his example, have inspired our organization, and will continue to inspire us for years to come.

2016-03-27T00:00:00Z,"COLINVAUX--Paul Alfred. Among the last generation of ""explorer"" scientists, Paul Alfred Colinvaux, 85, died February 28, 2016 on Cape Cod, MA, where he had lived and worked at the Marine Biological Laboratories after retiring, in 1998, from the Smithsonian Tropical Research Institute in Balboa, Panama. Colinvaux was Professor Emeritus at The Ohio State University, where he was a professor of Zoology from 1964 until 1991. In 2008, a National Public Radio host aptly described Colinvaux as ""Linnaeus meets Indiana Jones."" Over a fifty-year career, Colinvaux explored the Alaskan and Siberian Arctic, the Galapagos Islands, and the Amazonian jungle in Brazil, Ecuador, and Peru on a mission to discover the history of the climate. Trained as a paleoecologist, with a Ph.D. from Duke (1962) and post-doctoral training at Yale, Colinvaux extracted fossilized pollen from the bottom of ancient lakes as a tool to investigate climate conditions at the end of the last glacial maximum (20,000 years before present). Using little more than rubber boats, and a sediment ""coring rig"" he designed with OSU engineer Vincent Vohnout, Colinvaux and his team of scientists removed tubes of lake mud that had lain undisturbed for thousands of years. The pollen buried in the mud could then be dated and used to identify pre-historic climate conditions. In a pre-Google Earth era, without benefit of GPS technology, Colinvaux explored in the old ways, quizzing tribal fishermen and local traders, and poring over aerial maps to identify sectors of jungle to search for tiny, unmapped lakes undisturbed by human activity. At times, Colinvaux and his team were able to travel by helicopter or bush plane. More often, their targets were accessible only by foot or canoe, and so they marched through dense, uncharted jungle, for weeks at a time, with machetes in their hands, food and equipment on their backs. Colinvaux's early work in Alaska developed a 130,000 year-long data set that is still used to study the climate prevailing during the great Ice Age migrations across the ""Bering Land Bridge."" Colinvaux continued this work in Siberia in the last days of the Soviet Union, and his leadership role in early Reagan-Gorbachev-era ""glasnost"" helped establish an academic Edtente. At the equator, in the tradition of Darwin, Colinvaux was fascinated by the extraordinary, and to this day unexplained, vastness of equatorial species diversity. Ultimately, Colinvaux published evidence that he argued disproved the long- reigning ""refugia"" hypothesis, which posited that pockets of warm, wet flora might have survived the Ice Age, spurring localized speciation. Although the question remains unresolved, his research was instrumental in laying the foundation for modern thinking and research on Amazonian species diversity. When not in the Arctic, the Amazon or his laboratories, Colinvaux pursued other passions. At Ohio State, he was privileged to win every teaching prize then offered. His skill as an orator was renowned. During the Vietnam-era student uprising and occupation of Ohio State in May 1970, Colinvaux addressed, impromptu, a throng of demonstrating students, using the power of his voice and words to disperse the crowd. His oratory so influenced legendary football coach, Woody Hayes, that generations of OSU football players were urged to take Colinvaux's introductory ecology course. In 1973, Colinvaux authored the first undergraduate textbook in Ecology, which was used, in various editions, to educate generations of students in the United States and abroad. A lifelong oarsman who had rowed in Henley Royal Regatta, Colinvaux also was an original faculty advisor for the Ohio State University crew. In addition to extensive scientific writings and a memoir of his Amazon explorations (""Amazon Expeditions: My Quest for the Ice-Age Equator"" (2008), Colinvaux was the author of two, widely read ""popular"" explorations of the intersection between science and such modern political issues such as global climate change and crowding due to over-population: ""Why Big Fierce Animals Are Rare: An Ecologist's Perspective"" (1978) and ""The Fates of Nations: A Biological Theory of History"" (1980). Both books were translated into numerous languages and published throughout the world. Paul Colinvaux was born in St. Albans, England in 1930. He grew up in London during the Battle of Britain, studying, even as a boy, the ecology of plant regrowth in the craters left by German bombs. A graduate of Jesus College, Cambridge University (1956), Colinvaux served in the British Army of the Rhine in occupied Germany as a Second Lieutenant, Royal Artillery, 42nd Regiment. In 1966, he discovered a new species of flower in the Galapagos, which was subsequently named for him (""Passiflora colinvauxii""), as was the Galapagos diatom, ""Amphora paulii."" In 1971, he was awarded a Guggenheim fellowship. In 2013, he received a lifetime achievement award from the American Quaternary Association. In addition to his beloved wife of fifty-four years, fellow scientist Llewellya Hillis, Colinvaux leaves a sister (Margaret Robinson of Norfolk, England), two children (Catherine Colinvaux of Northborough, MA and Roger Colinvaux of Washington, DC), four grandchildren, generations of students, and thousands of books. 1/3"

2016-03-27T00:00:00Z,"MASEY--Jack, President of Metaform, Inc.,died in Manhattan on Sunday, March 13, 2016 of natural causes. An exhibition designer and author, he was held in high esteem internationally for the role that he played as design director for the United States Information Agency in projecting America's image abroad during the Cold War period. His was a cultural offensive in which he commissioned many of the outstanding design talents of the period, among them: R. Buckminster Fuller, Charles and Ray Eames, George Nelson and Chermayeff & Geismar, to create World's Fair Pavilions and exhibitions reflecting the achievements of the United States in art, science and technology. He was Design Chief for the 1959 American National Exhibition in Moscow, scene of the Nixon- Khrushchev Kitchen Debate. ""Make-Believe: America: U.S. Cultural Exhibitions in the Cold War,"" an exhibition at the Museum of Design Atlanta (MODA), through June 12, 2016, demonstrates the significance of his contribution toward projecting a positive image of the United States in this difficult period. Continuing his role at the United States Information Agency, he was responsible for the planning and execution of the US Pavilion at Expo '67, now Montreal's Biosphere. After founding MetaForm, Inc. in New York City in 1979, he was Project Manager for numerous major American museum exhibitions including the Ellis Island Museum and the Statue of Liberty Museum in New York Harbor. He received Presidential Design Awards for his role in both. In a recent documentary film, his role as a member of the World War II Ghost Army Camouflage Corps was portrayed. Born in Brooklyn, he was a graduate of the Fiorello LaGuardia High School of Music and Art and Yale School of Art and Architecture. The Masey Archive in New York is dedicated to his projects and will be maintained in the future by Yale's Sterling Memorial Library. A mentor to many young designers and museum curators, he was much beloved for his outrageous good humor, full-throated enthusiasms and zeal for life; he worked until his death at 91. He is survived by his wife, Beverly Payeff-Masey, two stepchildren, three step- grandchildren and a nephew. Mary Lou Masey, his first wife, predeceased him in 1991. To honor his specific instructions, no public ceremony of remembrance is scheduled. A private interment will be held in Washington, D.C. 1/3"

2016-03-29T00:00:00Z,"CONSTABLE--Priscilla McCaffrey, an elegant hostess, fashion designer and avid gardener, died March 22 in Essex, CT, where she lived for many years with her husband, the late James Cheston Constable. She was 97, and even as she grew frail and her memory faded, she bestowed a cheerful smile and wave on all who passed by. Born and raised in Boston, Priscilla attended the Woodward and May schools, enjoyed summers in Maine and Sunday strolls on Commonwealth Avenue with her beloved father, Robert Remington McCaffrey. The crash of 1929 ended her formal education, but through perseverance and imagination, she parlayed her sewing skills into a brilliant career in haute couture. During the 1940s, she designed wedding and debutante gowns for Henri Bendel in New York, often modeling them for fashion magazines. Shortly after the end of World War II, she met and became engaged to Cheston, who had just resigned his wartime commission as a United States Army Captain. After a glamorous social whirl in post-war Manhattan, they married in July, 1948. The bride designed and wore a wedding gown of pale pink satin overlaid with cinnamon lace. Several years later the couple moved to Greenwich, CT, where Cheston worked for IBM, and they adopted two children. As a homemaker, Priscilla turned her artistic talents and energy to charitable and social pursuits. She was an active member of the Green Fingers Garden Club in Greenwich and the Colony Club in New York, and she volunteered for numerous causes. Both frugal and generous, she hosted memorable dinners and often appeared in stylish ""costumes"" of her own design. The family spent many happy summers on Nantucket Island. After Cheston retired in the 1970s, the couple moved to Essex, where their annual Christmas Eve party on Foxboro Point was a popular social event for more than two decades. As a volunteer, Priscilla was deeply involved in developing the Lyme Academy College of Fine Arts. In 2004 the couple retired to Essex Meadows, where Cheston passed away in 2013. Priscilla is survived by their son, Timothy C. Constable, a computer consultant in Watertown, MA; their daughter, Pamela G. Constable, a journalist in Fairfax, VA; and two granddaughters. A memorial service will be held at noon on Saturday, April 16th, at St. Ann's Episcopal Church in Old Lyme, CT. In lieu of flowers, contributions may be made to the Lyme Academy.

2016-03-29T00:00:00Z,"GRAY--Marion Clausen. Loving mother and grandmother, dedicated wife and sister, accomplished choral singer and community stalwart died quietly in her home in Johns Creek, GA on March 24. She was born Marion Clausen in 1932 in New Rochelle, NY and attended The Northfield School and Skidmore College. After college, Marion forged a 13-year career at Time, Inc. before she met her husband Donald ""Woody"" Gray. Marion was a dedicated alumna of Time, Northfield and Skidmore, faithfully attending reunions throughout her life. An outstanding alto voice made her a wonderful addition to the Blue Hill Troupe in New York City. Her dedication to choral singing was a constant in her life, and was expressed when the family moved to Orono, MN through the Wayzata Community Church choir, the Minnetonka Choral Society and the Leagueaires, a 60-woman volunteer choral group that performs at nursing homes and for disabled children and adults. In 1991, when the family moved to Atlanta, Marion joined the Atlanta Symphony Orchestra Chorus, directed by Robert Shaw; this was the highlight of her singing career. Marion believed in giving back to the communities in which she lived. She was a tireless volunteer for the arts, hospitals and schools. She joined the Junior League and was an active member of the League's LST group. Her favorite charity was the Children's Cancer Research Fund where she worked for years. When Marion married Woody in 1967, they honeymooned in Quogue, NY, her favorite place. Summer vacations with her children created cherished memories. The memories became even more valuable as she was able to share time in Quogue with her three grandchildren, whom she adored. Marion leaves behind her husband of 49 years, Woody, son Peter (Cindy) Gray and their daughters Alexandra and Cathryn, daughter Carolyn (Malcolm) MacLear and their son Archer, her twin sisters, Joan and Jane, and innumerable friends throughout the communities she touched in her 83 years. It was her wish that in lieu of flowers, gifts could be sent to Children's Cancer Research Fund: childrenscancer.org 7301 Ohms Lane, Suite 355, Minneapolis, MN 55439.

2016-03-30T00:00:00Z,"BRITTMAN--Leslie, passed away peacefully on the morning of March 29, 2016 at the age of 72 years old, after a remarkable nineteen-year battle with cancer. Her warmth, class, intellect, humor, and love were evident to all who were blessed to know her. Leslie was an extraordinary human being. Her courage, strength, perseverance, and grace in the face of incredible challenges were an inspiration to everyone around her. Through her amazing humility and sheer will, she refused to allow cancer to limit her joy or to allow others to be fully aware of her struggle. Leslie was born in New York City and attended Bronx Science High School. Initially she attended Boston University but moved back home and graduated from Rutgers University in order to help her ailing mother. After college she traveled around Europe and lived in Geneva, Switzerland for six months, falling in love with the city. Upon returning to New York, Leslie worked for a dress company in the garment district and took part in the Beatnik scene. Shortly thereafter Leslie met the love of her life, Marvin Brittman on a blind date. They got married and had their first child, Rochelle. When Rochelle was just three months old, and Marvin was working for Arthur Andersen, the young family took the opportunity to relocate to Europe for three years. They first moved to a small French village near the Swiss border and then to Brussels, Belgium where a second child, David was born. Leslie had a successful professional career as an administrator for intellectual property law firms, most notably Arnold, White and Durkee in Houston, and Darby & Darby in New York. Subsequently, she volunteered her financial expertise for Adaptive Design Association whose goal was to ensure that children with disabilities receive the customized adaptions they need to reach their full potential. Leslie was also very active in philanthropic activities within the Jewish Community in New York and Austin. Leslie had a deep intellectual curiosity about life and humanity. She loved to discuss ideas and was a passionate patron of the arts. She attended the symphony and opera regularly and was a voracious reader and member of four book clubs. More than anything else Leslie built true and deep relationships. Her generosity and spirit made her loved by all. In every place she lived she collected dear friends and never let them go - in some cases lasting more than sixty-five years! Leslie was also a central figure in her extended family, taking every opportunity to bring everyone together to celebrate life. Leslie is survived by her loving family, husband Marvin, daughter Rochelle, son David, son-in-law Dan, siblings Diane and Richard and grandchildren, Noah, Kira, Ever, and Stella, and a large circle of relatives and life-long friends. Graveside services will be held at 1pm on Wednesday, March 30, 2016 in the Beth Israel 3 section of Capital Parks Cemetery in Pflugerville, TX. The Leslie S. Brittman Literary Fund has been created in Leslie's memory at the Jewish Foundation of Austin and Central Texas, a family of funds at the Austin Community Foundation.

2016-03-31T00:00:00Z,"O'SHEA--Rev. Howard V. O.F.M.,Franciscan priest and Catholic chaplain at Brown University from 1967-1994, died on March 26th in Wyckoff, NJ. He was 88. He is survived by the members of his Franciscan community, loving cousins, nieces and nephews, and is remembered by hundreds of friends. Born William Francis O'Shea in Cambridge, MA, the second son of Edward and Mary O'Shea, he grew up in Belmont, MA with his late brothers, Edward and Robert, and attended Phillips Academy Andover before joining the US Army in 1945. He studied Japanese at Yale University in preparation for deployment in the Pacific before the end of World War II. After leaving the army, he graduated with a degree in English from Harvard College in 1949, and worked as a reporter for United Press International, before he found his lifelong calling in the Franciscan Order, where he was ordained a priest in 1958, taking the name Howard Vincent. He taught philosophy and theology at Saint Joseph's Seminary, Saint Francis College, and Holy Name College, before being named the first full-time Catholic chaplain at Brown, where he served as a source of inspiration, strength, and wisdom for thousands of students for 27 years. During decades of change in American Catholic life beginning with the transformation of the Church spurred by Vatican II and the turbulent 1960s campus protests, Fr. O'Shea was a beacon of compassion and an energetic advocate of spiritual renewal. A supporter of greater ecumenical understanding, he was known for his passionate activism and broad-minded generosity. He loved working with students and was himself always young at heart. Throughout his ministry, he bore witness to Saint Francis' commitment to peace and to love for all those seeking God's mercy. Fr. O'Shea left Brown in 1994 and served as Chaplain for Foreign Students in the Archdiocese of Aix-en- Provence in France, taking daily bike rides around the countryside. During summers, he provided relief for overworked priests in need of vacation by running parishes in England and Sweden, and he touched each new community with his gentleness and joy. Fr. O'Shea retired from full-time ministry in 2011 and lived at Saint Anthony Shrine in Boston until 2015. Even in his last months, he continued to befriend those around him, and he found strength and peace in his faith. Funeral services will be held at St. Anthony Shrine, 100 Arch Street, Boston, MA on Thursday, March 31, 2016. 1/3"

2016-03-31T00:00:00Z,"GAGARIN--Jamie Porter, died March 27 at her home in Litchfield at the age of 97. She is survived by three children: a daughter Evgenia Pujol and her husband Raoul of New York City, and two sons, Michael and his wife Donna Carter of Austin, Texas, and Peter and his wife Gail of Sunderland, Massachusetts; and by two grandchildren: Daniel and his wife Nicole Cappelletty of Denver, Colorado, and Alexandra of Austin, Texas; and by her brother Larry Hughes and his wife Rose of Southport, Connecticut. Her husband of 62 years, Andrew, predeceased her in 2002, as did her youngest son Nicholas in 1971. She is also survived by her loving and devoted caregiver of many years, Lina Calabrese of Torrington, Lina's husband Angelo, and their daughter Leondina Foster. The family will be forever grateful to them. She was born June 27, 1918 in New York City, the only child of James and Margaret Porter. She never knew her father; he was killed in action in October, 1918, near Verdun, France. She graduated from Bennington College in three years in 1939, and married a month later. Four children followed over the next nine years. In 1946, the family moved to Litchfield, CT, where she lived for the rest of her life. She was a smart, independent, private, and unfailingly generous and polite person. She grew up in an age and in circumstances where she was not expected to work. Once the children were grown and on their own, she went back to school and got a Masters in Linguistics from New York University. There was no practical reason for this, but she just enjoyed learning something new. She was a pacifist and was an early opponent to the Vietnam War. She was active in ""Clergy and Laymen Against the War,"" and along with her husband was listed on President Nixon's ""enemies list,"" a distinction she was very proud of. She was interested in the arts of all kinds, but especially theater and modern art (painting and sculpture). She spent many years as a volunteer for Playwrights Horizons in New York. And the house in Litchfield had an assortment of works of art, usually purchased from artists not yet famous but soon to be; the art would stay around for a decade or two and then be sent off to some museum to be enjoyed by the general public. She loved to read. Her other main volunteer interest was the Oliver Wolcott Library in Litchfield. She was instrumental in its move to its current building on South Street and served a term as President of the Board of Trustees; in addition she was a regular volunteer there for many years. She enjoyed golf, tennis, and especially skiing, both alpine and cross-country. She skied into her early 80s. She made weekly trips to New York City. She loved both the quiet of Litchfield and the vibrancy of the city. Her last years were spent at her home in Litchfield, still making the occasional trip to the city and still enjoying the visits of her children and grandchildren. A celebration of her life will be held on Saturday, April 16 at noon at her home at 108 Gallows Lane in Litchfield. In lieu of flowers, memorial contributions may be made to the Oliver Wolcott Library, 160 South St., Litchfield, CT, 06759.

2016-03-31T00:00:00Z,"BROWN--Joan Simons, was surrounded by loving family on this past Good Friday when she slipped peacefully out of this life and into the next one. Joan Corliss Gardiner was born in New York City in 1929 and raised in Washington, DC. She graduated from Mt. Vernon Seminary in Washington, DC, and went on to graduate from Radcliffe College as an English major. During her four years in Cambridge, Joan developed an office romance with Thomas Cunningham Simons, while both were working together as business managers of The Harvard Crimson. Married shortly after graduation, Joan Gardiner Simons and her husband Tom moved to California where he launched his career in the insurance business. They had four children in the years that followed: Tom, who lives in South Carolina and Gloucester, MA; Martha, who lives in South Londonderry, VT; Sarah, who lives in Woodside, CA; and John, who lives in Briarcliff Manor, NY. Joan was predeceased by her sister, Jean Luckett Schmitt. During her husband's insurance career, Joan transcended the role of corporate wife, relishing her responsibility and their partnership. In fact, a former colleague of her husband said, ""She was the all time greatest corporate wife. She remembered everybody's name and she treated everybody with respect."" A sister-in-law would occasionally admit, ""It is no contest. Joan Simons is the brightest light in this family. Hands down."" Though Joan's traditional role was demanding, she forged her own identity as the Simons family moved to the Hartford area and then to Louisville, KY. She was a founding Board member of The Westledge School in West Simsbury, CT. She served as Chair of the Board at The Hartford College for Women, as well as on the Bellarmine University and Berea College Boards. Joan also served on the Louisville Water Company Board. Shortly after her husband Tom died in 1988, Joan married James K. Brown, whose wife was recently deceased. Former college classmates, they settled in Briarcliff Manor, spending summers in South Londonderry, VT. For the past few years Joan and Jim Brown made their primary home at The Osborn in Rye, NY. Joan developed her talent and competitive spirit on the golf courses of The Hartford Golf Club, The Louisville Golf Club, The Ekwanok Golf Club in Manchester, VT, and The Sleepy Hollow Golf Club in Briarcliff Manor. She delighted in her membership in both the Green Mountain Girls (Manchester, VT) and the National Society of Colonial Dames. In her later years, nothing gave Joan greater joy than when any of her children and grandchildren, from both marriages, would come calling. She was interested in, unconditionally supportive of, and totally devoted to every aspect of their lives. Joan Simons Brown spent her last days of this life in a room festooned with dozens of pictures of her kids, grandchildren and spouses. They are testimony to the richness of her life and the sustenance that she received from the people she loved and the people who loved her. A service is planned for 11am on Saturday, April 2 at All Saints' Episcopal Church, 201 Scarborough Road, Briarcliff Manor. In lieu of flowers, Joan's families have requested that donations can be made to the South Londonderry Free Library, 15 Old School Road, South Londonderry, VT 05155. 1/3"

Sherwood Lawrence, M.D. Cherished mother of Thea (Richard Traub), Victor (Patricia) and Geoffrey (Ida). Adored grandmother of Alexander and Hillary Browne, Andrew and Susannah Lawrence. Her innate strong will and happy nature enabled her to overcome difficult childhood circumstances. Dorothy met her husband-to-be, Sherwood, when both worked at United China Relief. It truly was love at first sight, for when he first saw her he said to himself ""This is the girl for me!"". On the evening of their first date, he proposed to her. Thus began her life-long love affair of 61 years. She loved books, especially antiquarian, read voraciously and enjoyed her hobby of bookbinding. For many years she worked as an Editorial Assistant with her husband, publishing a medical journal as a two-person operation. Her love of Latin and Greek classics led her to get her degree in Classics from NYU at the age of seventy. She was an expert and original knitter and seamstress. Through her Wetherbee family tree, she was a member of the Manhattan Chapter of the DAR. Dorothea was a joyful, independent woman whose positive outlook on life was an inspiration to all who knew and loved her. She had a magical way with all, most of all with young children. Fiercely devoted to her husband, children and grandchildren she kept her home a bright place of love and peace. Dorothea leaves us all a legacy of practical wisdom and a lifetime of love.

At the UN, Mr. Mendez designed and arranged financing of broad-based programs and specific projects of assistance to the world's poorest countries. He also administered their implementation and evaluation. Mr. Mendez contributed to theoretical work in economics, introducing a new discipline of international public finance. He proposed novel ideas about the global commons, and how to finance, internationally, its responsible development and conservation. His seminal book, ""International Public Finance: A New Perspective on Global Relations,"" was published by Oxford University Press in 1994. The first comprehensive treatment of a much debated topic, it set forth new concepts of global public good, positive and negative externalities, and the international public sector. Mr. Mendez taught for many years as a visiting lecturer at Yale College and adjunct professor at New York University. At the time of his death, he was working on a methodology for applying cost-benefit analysis to foreign policy decision making. He sought to define benefits and costs in a more rigorous, objective way than current practices, to enable foreign policy determinations less influenced by ideology and alliances, giving greater weight to projected outcomes. Ruben Mendez grew up in Manila and New York City. He graduated from Harvard College. He received an M.A. from Columbia University and Ph.D. from NYU. He was predeceased by his wife of fifty-four years, Matilda McEwen Mendez. He is survived by a daughter Katherine, son Tomas, and three grandsons, all of New York. 1/3"

Jerome Siegel lived a long and meaningful life. Born May 24, 1917, to Henry and Sophie Siegel, nee Ginsberg, in Newark, NJ, he was educated at Erasmus High School; graduated with a BS from City College, NY, and an MBA (1939) from Harvard Business School; and was a Lieutenant in the US Navy during WWII. Jerome married Jeanne Siegel in 1940 and had two daughters, Elizabeth and Carol, both of New York City. Jerome married Ruth Leff Levin in 1967 and they remained lovingly married until her death in 2011. Together they had one child, Henry Jonathan Siegel of New York City. Ruth's children, Michael, Stephen, Robin and Bill, all became part of Jerome's extended family of seven, as did their children's spouses, Talia, David, Laurence, Sharon, and Amy, as well as Luis Batista. Altogether, Jerome and Ruth had 17 adoring grandchildren. Jerome, a lifelong entrepreneur, founded The Titan Industrial Corporation in 1947 and built it to become a major player in global steel and commodity markets, receiving the famed E Award in 1965 for the largest independently owned U.S. exporting company. Jerome also founded Henry Realty, a firm focused on real estate and other ventures and investments. Jerome had too many achievements to mention all, but he was especially proud of his active Board role at Big Brothers/Big Sisters of NYC for over 20 years where he recently funded the Urban Assembly School for Global Commerce in Harlem, as well as his Board service and philanthropy involving The Ruth Leff Siegel Awards for Excellence in Pancreatic Cancer Research, Westchester Community College, Sarah Lawrence College, and The Weizmann Institute of Science.

2016-04-01T00:00:00Z,"SIEGEL--Jerome Arthur, 98, of Mamaroneck, New York, passed away Friday, March 25, 2016, in La Romana, Dominican Republic, while vacationing at his villa, Casa de las Gaviotas, in Casa de Campo. Jerome Siegel lived a long and meaningful life. Born May 24, 1917, to Henry and Sophie Siegel, nee Ginsberg, in Newark, NJ, he was educated at Erasmus High School; graduated with a BS from City College, NY, and an MBA (1939) from Harvard Business School; and was a Lieutenant in the US Navy during WWII. Jerome married Jeanne Siegel in 1940 and had two daughters, Elizabeth and Carol, both of New York City. Jerome married Ruth Leff Levin in 1967 and they remained lovingly married until her death in 2011. Together they had one child, Henry Jonathan Siegel of New York City. Ruth's children, Michael, Stephen, Robin and Bill, all became part of Jerome's extended family of seven, as did their children's spouses, Talia, David, Laurence, Sharon, and Amy, as well as Luis Batista. Altogether, Jerome and Ruth had 17 adoring grandchildren. Jerome, a lifelong entrepreneur, founded The Titan Industrial Corporation in 1947 and built it to become a major player in global steel and commodity markets, receiving the famed E Award in 1965 for the largest independently owned U.S. exporting company. Jerome also founded Henry Realty, a firm focused on real estate and other ventures and investments. Jerome had too many achievements to mention all, but he was especially proud of his active Board role at Big Brothers/Big Sisters of NYC for over 20 years where he recently funded the Urban Assembly School for Global Commerce in Harlem, as well as his Board service and philanthropy involving The Ruth Leff Siegel Awards for Excellence in Pancreatic Cancer Research, Westchester Community College, Sarah Lawrence College, and The Weizmann Institute of Science. He was also proud of his long relationship with the Democratic Party, and especially President Bill Clinton, Hillary Rodham Clinton, Congresswoman Nita Lowey, and Senator Chuck Schumer. Jerome was a lifelong athlete and member of Quaker Ridge Golf Club, Beach Point Club, The Lotos Club, La Romana Country Club, The Harmonie Club, The Harvard Club of NYC, and the New Rochelle Tennis Club. He especially enjoyed the many tennis doubles trophies he won with Ruth and with Henry. He was an avid golfer and card player, and played bridge throughout his life. Jerome was an incredible father and grandfather, a fantastic friend, and a lover of life. He was a legendary leader for his family, friends, community and business associates, who led an active, engaged life up to his final moments. Funeral service will be held at Westchester Reform Temple in Scarsdale on Friday, April 1 at noon. In lieu of flowers, please send contributions to the Ruth Leff Siegel Awards Fund at the Pancreas Center at Columbia University Medical Center, payable to The Trustees of Columbia University and indicating Siegel Awards Fund, sent to CUMC Development Office, attn: Natasha McCabe, 100 Haven Avenue, Suite 29D, New York, NY, 10032. 1/3"

Natalie was the first graduating class of the Leonard School for Girls. With no previous training, but with a steely determination, she pursued her dream to become an actor and gained acceptance to the prestigious School of Drama at Carnegie Tech where she received her BFA. Just as she began a career on stage and on the radio in New York City, she met Jeff Jaffe on a blind date. Six months later they were married and that union lasted until his death in 2014, 68 years. Though she had no formal title, Natalie was Jeff's partner during his tenure as owner and CEO of the Chunky Corporation, and later as President of Schrafft's. The quintessential hostess, but with a razor sharp intellect, she quietly helped steer her husband's business endeavors throughout his multi- faceted career. Throughout her life Natalie was passionate about the theatre and was active on numerous theatrical boards in New York, Boston and later at the Lyric in Florida. She always said she'd never walk out on a stage performance and she never did. For many years she volunteered for the Association for the Blind and transcribed Braille.

2016-04-02T00:00:00Z,"OLICK--Selma Ada, died in New York City, NY, on March 31, 2016, of complications from heart disease. She was 85. She will be remembered by family and friends as a caring wife, a loving mother, and an unapologetic partisan of the Democratic Party. Selma was born on August 13, 1930 in New Haven, Connecticut to George Kaufman and Edith Ginsberg. The Kaufmans operated a five-and-dime store where Selma helped her parents after school. Music filled the family home, where it was common for relatives to gather for impromptu Sunday afternoon concerts of Perry Como songs and other popular music, with Selma and her sister Beatrice on piano and her brother Bernard (Bernie) on clarinet. In 1948, Selma graduated from Hillhouse High School and, in 1952, from New Haven State Teachers College. She later earned a master's degree in education from the College of New Rochelle. In 1954, she married Arthur (Art) Olick, a Yale law student, and upon Art's graduation they moved to Fort Gordon, Georgia where he served in the U.S. Army for two years. Upon relocating to the New York area, Selma gave birth to a son, Robert, in 1957 and a daughter, Karen, in 1961. Art served in the U.S. Attorney's Office for the Southern District of New York under Robert Morgenthau from 1962 to 1968, following which he was a name partner at several New York law firms, most notably Anderson, Russell, Kill, and Olick. For three decades, the family lived in Hartsdale, NY, where they were active in Bet Am Shalom, a Reconstructionist temple in White Plains, and Selma worked as a part-time elementary teacher in the Greenburgh school district. Selma and Art built a weekend home in Putnam Valley where they spent many weekends with family and friends. For many years, Selma and Art traveled extensively, were avid fans of opera and classical music and were even bigger fans of spending time in both New York and Florida with their grandchildren. A child of the Great Depression, Selma never lost her innate frugality, insisting on D'Agostino's over Whole Foods and buses over Uber. She was constant in her commitment to her family's education. She also never hesitated to stop a dinner party in its tracks to highlight topical issues of racial and economic inequality. As Art's health declined due to M.S., Selma served as his caregiver and tireless advocate. None who knew her will ever forget her common decency or her uncommon impatience with the speed of social progress. Selma is survived by Arthur, Robert, Karen and her husband John Gibson and five grandchildren, Joshua, Sarah, Rachel, Stephen, and Grant. Services Sunday, April 3rd, at 11:30am at Riverside Chapel, Manhattan. Family will be receiving at 300 East 54th Street on Sunday, from 5-8pm. 1/3"

2016-04-03T00:00:00Z,"OLICK--Selma Ada, died in New York City, NY, on March 31, 2016, of complications from heart disease. She was 85. She will be remembered by family and friends as a caring wife, a loving mother, and an unapologetic partisan of the Democratic Party. Selma was born on August 13, 1930 in New Haven, Connecticut to George Kaufman and Edith Ginsberg. The Kaufmans operated a five-and-dime store where Selma helped her parents after school. Music filled the family home, where it was common for relatives to gather for impromptu Sunday afternoon concerts of Perry Como songs and other popular music, with Selma and her sister Beatrice on piano and her brother Bernard (Bernie) on clarinet. In 1948, Selma graduated from Hillhouse High School and, in 1952, from New Haven State Teachers College. She later earned a master's degree in education from the College of New Rochelle. In 1954, she married Arthur (Art) Olick, a Yale law student, and upon Art's graduation they moved to Fort Gordon, Georgia where he served in the U.S. Army for two years. Upon relocating to the New York area, Selma gave birth to a son, Robert, in 1957 and a daughter, Karen, in 1961. Art served in the U.S. Attorney's Office for the Southern District of New York under Robert Morgenthau from 1962 to 1968, following which he was a name partner at several New York law firms, most notably Anderson, Russell, Kill, and Olick. For three decades, the family lived in Hartsdale, NY, where they were active in Bet Am Shalom, a Reconstructionist temple in White Plains, and Selma worked as a part-time elementary teacher in the Greenburgh school district. Selma and Art built a weekend home in Putnam Valley where they spent many weekends with family and friends. For many years, Selma and Art traveled extensively, were avid fans of opera and classical music and were even bigger fans of spending time in both New York and Florida with their grandchildren. A child of the Great Depression, Selma never lost her innate frugality, insisting on D'Agostino's over Whole Foods and buses over Uber. She was constant in her commitment to her family's education. She also never hesitated to stop a dinner party in its tracks to highlight topical issues of racial and economic inequality. As Art's health declined due to M.S., Selma served as his caregiver and tireless advocate. None who knew her will ever forget her common decency or her uncommon impatience with the speed of social progress. Selma is survived by Arthur, Robert, Karen and her husband John Gibson and five grandchildren, Joshua, Sarah, Rachel, Stephen, and Grant. Services Sunday, April 3rd, at 11:30am at Riverside Chapel, Manhattan. Family will be receiving at 300 East 54th Street on Sunday, from 5-8pm. 1/3"

As the indefatigable Chairman of the NYH Finance Committee, Mr. Phipps steered this institution through financially challenging times. He also was a longstanding and valued member of the Real Estate and Facilities Committee. Mr. Phipps' judgment was sought and relied upon; his directness and wisdom were greatly appreciated. Notwithstanding his many commitments to, and storied achievements in, the worlds of finance, racing and sports, Mr. Phipps devoted considerable time and attention to this hospital. A Trustee for whom his colleagues had great admiration and real affection, Dinny Phipps will be greatly missed. We extend our deepest sympathies to Mr. Phipps' wife Ande, his daughters Kayce, Kelley, Lilly, Daisy and Samantha, and his son, our Trustee Ogden. Frank A. Bennack, Jr., Chairman of the Board of Trustees Steven J. Corwin, MD, President and CEO NewYork-Presbyterian 1/3"

2016-04-10T00:00:00Z,"PORTER--David H. On March 26, Skidmore College lost a true Renaissance man, David H. Porter, our president from 1987 until 1999. Porter embodied the very hallmarks of the liberal arts. Born in New York City 1935 to Hugh Porter, president of Union Theological Seminary's Music School, and Ethel K. Flentye, a pianist and teacher at Dalton School, he was ""Best Boy"" at the Collegiate School, excelling in the classroom and on the ballfield. At Swarthmore College he studied music and classics, graduating summa cum laude in 1958. He also studied at the Philadelphia Conservatory of Music with noted Austrian pianist and composer Edward Steuermann. Porter earned a Ph.D. in classics from Princeton University in 1962. He joined the faculty at Carleton College in Minnesota, spending the next quartercentury as a popular teacher and noted scholar, holding the W. H. Laird Chair in Liberal Arts. On his 1994-95 tour as Phi Beta Kappa Visiting Scholar, his lectures covered Ives and Cage as well as Virginia Woolf, classics, Beethoven, and education. In 1986 he served as Carleton's interim president, and in 1987 he was recruited as Skidmore's fifth president. Over the next 12 years, Porter helped transform Skidmore into a nationally recognized institution, strengthening its curriculum, expanding the sciences, diversifying its faculty and student body, broadening financial aid, overseeing the largest fundraising campaign to that point. He laid the groundwork for the renowned Frances Young Tang Teaching Museum and Art Gallery which opened in 2000. Music remained a core passion. He performed nationally and internationally, from Beethoven and Bach to the avant-garde works of Charles Ives and John Cage, and in the 1970s and '80s he studied harpsichord with Gustav Leonhardt. He was a regular in op-ed pages from The New York Times to The Boston Globe, opining on topics ranging from the cost of college to the relevance of Horace's odes, from student volunteerism to music education. In fact, a posthumous letter to the Times ran on Thursday. After retiring from the Skidmore presidency in 1999, Porter remained an active, publishing academic at Indiana University and Williams College before returning to Skidmore to teach classics as the Tisch Family Distinguished Professor. After retiring from the faculty in 2013, he continued to enlighten first-year students with his ""Well- Tampered Clavier"" lecture- concert on John Cage. Off campus, he was a member and chair of the board of Value Line and served on the boards of the Adirondack Trust Company, Saratoga Performing Arts Center, Friends of the Saratoga Battlefield, Capital District Hospice, Yaddo, and the Willa Cather Foundation. He is survived by his wife, Helen Luebke Porter; his children Hugh Edwin Porter, Laudie Everett Porter, Helen Carol Porter, David Gray Porter, and Cathrin Ann Lawton; and seven grandchildren. He was predeceased by his first wife, Laudie Dimmette Porter. A standing-room-only memorial service was held at Skidmore's Arthur Zankel Music Center on April 8. For those wishing to make memorial donations, we suggest the David and Helen Porter Scholarship Fund at Skidmore College.

He was a lifelong teacher and, for a decade, the head of the French-American School of New York, in Westchester. Born in New York on November 8, 1943, to Esther and Rene Leonhardt, he developed enduring interests as a young man: languages and literature, especially French, as well as politics and family. He studied at Trinity, Choate, Harvard, Columbia and L'Ecole Normale Superieure. He became active in the 1960s and 1970s in the movements against racism and the Vietnam War. He spoke French as natives do, was fond of quoting La Fontaine's fables and listened to thousands of hours of jazz, often while cooking for family. He taught -- and made many friends -- at Horace Mann, Fieldston, Rodeph Sholom and the public schools in Mamaroneck and Newton, Mass. His years at FASNY were the greatest joy of his professional life. He and Joan Alexander Leonhardt were married for 47 years, a partnership that is a model for those around them. Their children -- Robin Peterson and her husband, Eric, of Denver; and David and his wife, Laura, of Bethesda, Md., -- were the center of Bob's life. He was also beloved by his five grandchildren, Jonah, Felix, Cordelia, Eva and Beatrix; his dear cousins, the Korzenik family, Caryl Pines Curry and her children, Eve and Roger; his siblings-in-law, Steve, Polly and Kathy; his nephews and nieces, Daisy, Jackson, Maria and Tyler; and his many friends.

He was a lifelong teacher and, for a decade, the head of the French-American School of New York, in Westchester. Born in New York on November 8, 1943, to Esther and Rene Leonhardt, he developed enduring interests as a young man: languages and literature, especially French, as well as politics and family. He studied at Trinity, Choate, Harvard, Columbia and L'Ecole Normale Superieure. He became active in the 1960s and 1970s in the movements against racism and the Vietnam War. He spoke French as natives do, was fond of quoting La Fontaine's fables and listened to thousands of hours of jazz, often while cooking for family. He taught -- and made many friends -- at Horace Mann, Fieldston, Rodeph Sholom and the public schools in Mamaroneck and Newton, Mass. His years at FASNY were the greatest joy of his professional life. He and Joan Alexander Leonhardt were married for 47 years, a partnership that is a model for those around them. Their children -- Robin Peterson and her husband, Eric, of Denver; and David and his wife, Laura, of Bethesda, Md., -- were the center of Bob's life. He was also beloved by his five grandchildren, Jonah, Felix, Cordelia, Eva and Beatrix; his dear cousins, the Korzenik family, Caryl Pines Curry and her children, Eve and Roger; his siblings-in-law, Steve, Polly and Kathy; his nephews and nieces, Daisy, Jackson, Maria and Tyler; and his many friends. His life force carries on in them. 1/3"

2016-04-13T00:00:00Z,"AMSTER--Richard L.,a resident of Morristown, NJ died on April 10, 2016. He was born in Spring Lake, New Jersey in 1922, was raised in Elizabeth, New Jersey until age 13, and was sent to boarding school graduating at age 16. Convinced that his country would be involved in the war then raging in Europe, he attended a college that had an accelerated program and graduated at age 19. As a member of ""The Greatest Generation"" he immediately entered the Navy V7 program and 90 days later was commissioned an Ensign. He was sent to anti-submarine warfare school in Florida and fleet gunnery school in California and then went to the Pacific theater where he participated in the struggle for the control of the Bismarck Sea and the eastern Solomons. His ship was sunk off Leyte Gulf at the outset of the invasion of the Philippines. He continued to serve in the Pacific theater, including in the first landing at Guadalcanal. He was a highly decorated veteran and honorably separated from the Navy with the rank of Lieutenant USNR in 1956. Dick entered Columbia University's School of Law on the GI bill, graduated in 1948 and passed the New Jersey bar exam that same year. Shortly after opening an office in Newark he was offered a clerkship by Justice Nathan L. Jacobs which he accepted and had an exceptional experience learning from a great lawyer and jurist. After his clerkship he opened a law office in Newark, New Jersey and was the senior partner in the firm of Amster and Levin. He ultimately moved the office to Millburn and then went of counsel with a law firm in Roseland. He was appointed to Columbia Law School's Board of Visitors and in 1981 was awarded its medal for conspicuous service to the law school. During his years at the bar he was trustee and chairman of the Clients Security Fund, Chairman of the American Bar Association Committee on Client Security and a member of its prestigious Committee on Ethics and Professional Responsibility. He retired from the practice of law in 1998. In addition to practicing law Dick was a trustee of the Newark Beth Israel Hospital. When the hospital was sold, he became a charter trustee of the Health Care Foundation of New Jersey, which administered the very substantial funds from the sale of the hospital and became a major charitable grantor to needy health related organizations. He was a founder of the Democrats for Good Government which led the fight to reform the democratic organization in Essex County. He was an early proponent of tort reform in New Jersey, which resulted in the enactment of automobile nofault legislation. Dick's service to his community was as co-founder of the Millburn Short Hills First Aid Squad which he served as captain and president. He was also president of the Millburn Short Hills Little League and counsel to the Neighborhood House which was the home of the visiting nurse and other health related facilities. Governor Kean appointed him to the Board of Commissioners of the New York and the New Jersey Maritime Pilot & Docking Commission with the understanding that he would modernize its operations. With the help of subsequent appointees, the Commission became an effective oversight body seeking to ensure safe navigation in the Port of New York and New Jersey and ultimately brought in all docking pilots for licensing and regulation. He was reappointed by successive governors and served for thirty years before retiring. By far the most important event of Dick's life occurred in August of 1949 when he married the love of his life, the beautiful, kind, generous and loving Barbara Ann Levin. Their marriage happily lasted for over two thirds of a century and was still going strong at the time of his passing. Their marriage produced three children, Richard Jr. married to Pam, Jeanne Ellen married to Ken and younger son Douglas. Four grandchildren round out the family: Rachel, Casey, Alexandra and Arden. He looked forward to spending time at his home on Long Beach Island, playing tennis, and tending to his garden. He spent many happy days there with his family and friends. He served his country; he served his public; but most importantly he was a devoted family man. He will be greatly missed. A funeral service will be held on Friday, April 15, 2016 at 12:00pm at the Bernheim, Apter Kreitzman Suburban Funeral Chapel, 68 Old Short Hills Rd., Livingston, NJ. There will be a reception to follow at 40 W. Park Place, Morristown, NJ. The family asks that donations in lieu of flowers be sent to the Atlantic Healthcare Foundation, Morristown, NJ, the New Jersey Healthcare Foundation, Millburn, NJ or a charity of your choice. 1/3"

2016-04-13T00:00:00Z,"AMSTER--Richard L.,a resident of Morristown, NJ died on April 10, 2016. He was born in Spring Lake, New Jersey in 1922, was raised in Elizabeth, New Jersey until age 13, and was sent to boarding school graduating at age 16. Convinced that his country would be involved in the war then raging in Europe, he attended a college that had an accelerated program and graduated at age 19. As a member of ""The Greatest Generation"" he immediately entered the Navy V7 program and 90 days later was commissioned an Ensign. He was sent to anti-submarine warfare school in Florida and fleet gunnery school in California and then went to the Pacific theater where he participated in the struggle for the control of the Bismarck Sea and the eastern Solomons. His ship was sunk off Leyte Gulf at the outset of the invasion of the Philippines. He continued to serve in the Pacific theater, including in the first landing at Guadalcanal. He was a highly decorated veteran and honorably separated from the Navy with the rank of Lieutenant USNR in 1956. Dick entered Columbia University's School of Law on the GI bill, graduated in 1948 and passed the New Jersey bar exam that same year. Shortly after opening an office in Newark he was offered a clerkship by Justice Nathan L. Jacobs which he accepted and had an exceptional experience learning from a great lawyer and jurist. After his clerkship he opened a law office in Newark, New Jersey and was the senior partner in the firm of Amster and Levin. He ultimately moved the office to Millburn and then went of counsel with a law firm in Roseland. He was appointed to Columbia Law School's Board of Visitors and in 1981 was awarded its medal for conspicuous service to the law school. During his years at the bar he was trustee and chairman of the Clients Security Fund, Chairman of the American Bar Association Committee on Client Security and a member of its prestigious Committee on Ethics and Professional Responsibility. He retired from the practice of law in 1998. In addition to practicing law Dick was a trustee of the Newark Beth Israel Hospital. When the hospital was sold, he became a charter trustee of the Health Care Foundation of New Jersey, which administered the very substantial funds from the sale of the hospital and became a major charitable grantor to needy health related organizations. He was a founder of the Democrats for Good Government which led the fight to reform the democratic organization in Essex County. He was an early proponent of tort reform in New Jersey, which resulted in the enactment of automobile nofault legislation. Dick's service to his community was as co-founder of the Millburn Short Hills First Aid Squad which he served as captain and president. He was also president of the Millburn Short Hills Little League and counsel to the Neighborhood House which was the home of the visiting nurse and other health related facilities. Governor Kean appointed him to the Board of Commissioners of the New York and the New Jersey Maritime Pilot & Docking Commission with the understanding that he would modernize its operations. With the help of subsequent appointees, the Commission became an effective oversight body seeking to ensure safe navigation in the Port of New York and New Jersey and ultimately brought in all docking pilots for licensing and regulation. He was reappointed by successive governors and served for thirty years before retiring. By far the most important event of Dick's life occurred in August of 1949 when he married the love of his life, the beautiful, kind, generous and loving Barbara Ann Levin. Their marriage happily lasted for over two thirds of a century and was still going strong at the time of his passing. Their marriage produced three children, Richard Jr. married to Pam, Jeanne Ellen married to Ken and younger son Douglas. Four grandchildren round out the family: Rachel, Casey, Alexandra and Arden. He looked forward to spending time at his home on Long Beach Island, playing tennis, and tending to his garden. He spent many happy days there with his family and friends. He served his country; he served his public; but most importantly he was a devoted family man. He will be greatly missed. A funeral service will be held on Friday, April 15, 2016 at 12:00pm at the Bernheim, Apter Kreitzman Suburban Funeral Chapel, 68 Old Short Hills Rd., Livingston, NJ. There will be a reception to follow at 40 W. Park Place, Morristown, NJ. The family asks that donations in lieu of flowers be sent to the Atlantic Healthcare Foundation, Morristown, NJ, the New Jersey Healthcare Foundation, Millburn, NJ or a charity of your choice. 1/3"

Cooley and Jane Crary Allen. He was a graduate of St. Paul's School '56, Yale University '60, and the Columbia University Business School. He is survived by his sisters Sarah Martin and her husband Bob, of Essex, CT, Clare Edwards and her husband Jared, of West Hartford, CT and his brother Jeffrey Cooley and his wife Betsey, of Old Lyme, CT. He is also survived by his nephews Whitman Seymour (Lisa), David Seymour (Anna), Christopher Seymour, and Jonathan Edwards (Allison) and 10 great-nieces and nephews. In addition, he is survived by his aunt, Mary Crary of Farmington, CT. His wife, Mary Mendenhall Cooley predeceased him. After graduating from business school he took a different path and had a life filled with sustaining friendships and intellectual discovery. Chris and Mary took up partial residence in Venice in the early 1970's and immersed themselves in the history and culture of the city, in a stimulating and congenial society, and in the ebb and flow of daily life. Their garden and hospitality became magnets for friends from near and far. A tour of the city or a visit to any museum with Chris was to experience it through the eyes of an impassioned guide and true scholar. Chris collected beautiful things and people who interested him. His appreciation for and understanding of art, history, and music, coupled with his enviable memory and love of a good story or joke, made him a companion much in demand by his many devoted friends. As an inquiring traveller, Chris especially valued his trips and excursions with friends and family, and particularly, in later years, with the Fortress Study Group to sites throughout Great Britain and Europe. He was a member of the Grolier Club and the Yale Club of New York. Donations may be made in his memory to Save Venice Inc., 133 E. 58th St., New York, NY 10022 1/3"

The cause of death was a brain hemorrhage after a fall. He was 90. Dr. Rozycki was born on May 31, 1924 in Lublin, Poland. His youthful plans to attend medical school in Paris, France were altered by the outbreak of WWII. His family fled east and they were interned in a Soviet labor camp in Siberia. Upon release, they sought refuge in warmer climates and spent the rest of the war years in refugee-packed Fergana, Uzbekistan. After the war, Dr. Rozycki attended medical school in Wroclaw, Poland, where he met and later married on July 28, 1956, his beloved wife of 57 years, Danuta Lola Rozycki, a physician and surgeon. The Rozyckis immigrated to Israel in 1957 where they continued their practice of medicine and had two daughters. Ludwik served as a physician in the Israeli Defense Force where Ariel Sharon was his battalion leader. The family relocated to New York in 1966 and Ludwik affiliated with Mount Sinai Hospital, practicing at the Elmhurst, Queens location and later opened a private practice. Their next move was in 1970 to Scarsdale, NY, where the Rozyckis lived for over three decades and where Ludwik developed his love of running, to which he credited his excellent health. Dr. Rozycki practiced medicine for over forty-five years, retiring only after his 73rd birthday. He was beloved by his patients for his keen diagnostic skills, his sense of humor and for being one of the last remaining pediatricians practicing in Queens and Brooklyn still making house calls into the 1990s. He valued the companionship of his friends and loved his wife and his family above all else. He is survived by his daughters, Avital Soldatenko (Greg), Sarit Rozycki (Robert Cromwell) and three grandchildren. He was laid to rest in Israel, beside his beloved Lola. The funeral service was held at Westchester Reform Temple in Scarsdale and the family sat shiva at the house of his daughter, Avital.

We send our condolences to his family, friends, colleagues and those who share our profound respect for Ham's tireless commitment to community service and his impact on the lives of tens of thousands of New York's children and families. His unwavering goal of creating better, more responsive and comprehensive solutions to complicated problems that children frequently face distinguished him from many advocates. He was a particularly staunch advocate for children and adults with mental illness and understood the intricate balance between state hospitals and community care and always advocated for a full continuum of services for seriously mentally ill children. Ham's position never varied: using public resources more wisely, avoiding fads, providing help to children and families as early as possible and as close to home as possible. He was a master at the politics of child advocacy and the art of compromise. Ever thoughtful, balanced in his views, focused on the big picture and willing to wait out the smartest solution. Ham's involvement in CCC spanned nearly 50 years. He took our Community Leadership Course in 1968, became a Board Member in 1971 and assumed leadership of the Board just two years later, helping CCC navigate the rocky shoals of hard financial times in the 1970s. He received CCC's Eleanor Roosevelt Award in 2001 and remained active on the Board through 2006, when he was made an Honorary Director. Ham was an inspiration to all of us and will be deeply missed in our community. Jessica Aaron, Chair Diana Elghanayan, President Jennifer March, Executive Director 1/3"

Ludwik served as a physician in the Israeli Defense Force where Ariel Sharon was his battalion leader. The family relocated to New York in 1966 and Ludwik affiliated with Mount Sinai Hospital, practicing at the Elmhurst, Queens location and later opened a private practice. Their next move was in 1970 to Scarsdale, NY, where the Rozyckis lived for over three decades and where Ludwik developed his love of running, to which he credited his excellent health. Dr. Rozycki practiced medicine for over forty-five years, retiring only after his 73rd birthday. He was beloved by his patients for his keen diagnostic skills, his sense of humor and for being one of the last remaining pediatricians practicing in Queens and Brooklyn still making house calls into the 1990s. He valued the companionship of his friends and loved his wife and his family above all else. He is survived by his daughters, Avital Soldatenko (Greg), Sarit Rozycki (Robert Cromwell) and three grandchildren. He was laid to rest in Israel, beside his beloved Lola. The funeral service was held at Westchester Reform Temple in Scarsdale and the family sat shiva at the house of his daughter, Avital.

2016-04-14T00:00:00Z,"COOLEY--Christopher, born February 23, 1938, died unexpectedly at home in New York City in early March. Born in Hartford, CT, he was the son of Paul W. Cooley and Jane Crary Allen. He was a graduate of St. Paul's School '56, Yale University '60, and the Columbia University Business School. He is survived by his sisters Sarah Martin and her husband Bob, of Essex, CT, Clare Edwards and her husband Jared, of West Hartford, CT and his brother Jeffrey Cooley and his wife Betsey, of Old Lyme, CT. He is also survived by his nephews Whitman Seymour (Lisa), David Seymour (Anna), Christopher Seymour, and Jonathan Edwards (Allison) and 10 great-nieces and nephews. In addition, he is survived by his aunt, Mary Crary of Farmington, CT. His wife, Mary Mendenhall Cooley predeceased him. After graduating from business school he took a different path and had a life filled with sustaining friendships and intellectual discovery. Chris and Mary took up partial residence in Venice in the early 1970's and immersed themselves in the history and culture of the city, in a stimulating and congenial society, and in the ebb and flow of daily life. Their garden and hospitality became magnets for friends from near and far. A tour of the city or a visit to any museum with Chris was to experience it through the eyes of an impassioned guide and true scholar. Chris collected beautiful things and people who interested him. His appreciation for and understanding of art, history, and music, coupled with his enviable memory and love of a good story or joke, made him a companion much in demand by his many devoted friends. As an inquiring traveller, Chris especially valued his trips and excursions with friends and family, and particularly, in later years, with the Fortress Study Group to sites throughout Great Britain and Europe. He was a member of the Grolier Club and the Yale Club of New York. Donations may be made in his memory to Save Venice Inc., 133 E. 58th St., New York, NY 10022 1/3"

2016-04-14T00:00:00Z,"KEAN--Hamilton Fish. Citizens' Committee for Children of New York (CCC) mourns the passing of Hamilton F. Kean. We send our condolences to his family, friends, colleagues and those who share our profound respect for Ham's tireless commitment to community service and his impact on the lives of tens of thousands of New York's children and families. His unwavering goal of creating better, more responsive and comprehensive solutions to complicated problems that children frequently face distinguished him from many advocates. He was a particularly staunch advocate for children and adults with mental illness and understood the intricate balance between state hospitals and community care and always advocated for a full continuum of services for seriously mentally ill children. Ham's position never varied: using public resources more wisely, avoiding fads, providing help to children and families as early as possible and as close to home as possible. He was a master at the politics of child advocacy and the art of compromise. Ever thoughtful, balanced in his views, focused on the big picture and willing to wait out the smartest solution. Ham's involvement in CCC spanned nearly 50 years. He took our Community Leadership Course in 1968, became a Board Member in 1971 and assumed leadership of the Board just two years later, helping CCC navigate the rocky shoals of hard financial times in the 1970s. He received CCC's Eleanor Roosevelt Award in 2001 and remained active on the Board through 2006, when he was made an Honorary Director. Ham was an inspiration to all of us and will be deeply missed in our community. Jessica Aaron, Chair Diana Elghanayan, President Jennifer March, Executive Director 1/3"

The cause of death was a brain hemorrhage after a fall. He was 90. Dr. Rozycki was born on May 31, 1924 in Lublin, Poland. His youthful plans to attend medical school in Paris, France were altered by the outbreak of WWII. His family fled east and they were interned in a Soviet labor camp in Siberia. Upon release, they sought refuge in warmer climates and spent the rest of the war years in refugee-packed Fergana, Uzbekistan. After the war, Dr. Rozycki attended medical school in Wroclaw, Poland, where he met and later married on July 28, 1956, his beloved wife of 57 years, Danuta Lola Rozycki, a physician and surgeon. The Rozyckis immigrated to Israel in 1957 where they continued their practice of medicine and had two daughters. Ludwik served as a physician in the Israeli Defense Force where Ariel Sharon was his battalion leader. The family relocated to New York in 1966 and Ludwik affiliated with Mount Sinai Hospital, practicing at the Elmhurst, Queens location and later opened a private practice. Their next move was in 1970 to Scarsdale, NY, where the Rozyckis lived for over three decades and where Ludwik developed his love of running, to which he credited his excellent health. Dr. Rozycki practiced medicine for over forty-five years, retiring only after his 73rd birthday. He was beloved by his patients for his keen diagnostic skills, his sense of humor and for being one of the last remaining pediatricians practicing in Queens and Brooklyn still making house calls into the 1990s. He valued the companionship of his friends and loved his wife and his family above all else. He is survived by his daughters, Avital Soldatenko (Greg), Sarit Rozycki (Robert Cromwell) and three grandchildren. He was laid to rest in Israel, beside his beloved Lola. The funeral service was held at Westchester Reform Temple in Scarsdale and the family sat shiva at the house of his daughter, Avital.

2016-04-15T00:00:00Z,"ROZYCKI--Ludwik, M.D.,a Pediatrician with special interest in Pediatric Hematology and Infectious Disease, Holocaust survivor, and avid reader, died on April 21, 2015, at Eisenhower Medical Center in Rancho Mirage, CA. The cause of death was a brain hemorrhage after a fall. He was 90. Dr. Rozycki was born on May 31, 1924 in Lublin, Poland. His youthful plans to attend medical school in Paris, France were altered by the outbreak of WWII. His family fled east and they were interned in a Soviet labor camp in Siberia. Upon release, they sought refuge in warmer climates and spent the rest of the war years in refugee-packed Fergana, Uzbekistan. After the war, Dr. Rozycki attended medical school in Wroclaw, Poland, where he met and later married on July 28, 1956, his beloved wife of 57 years, Danuta Lola Rozycki, a physician and surgeon. The Rozyckis immigrated to Israel in 1957 where they continued their practice of medicine and had two daughters. Ludwik served as a physician in the Israeli Defense Force where Ariel Sharon was his battalion leader. The family relocated to New York in 1966 and Ludwik affiliated with Mount Sinai Hospital, practicing at the Elmhurst, Queens location and later opened a private practice. Their next move was in 1970 to Scarsdale, NY, where the Rozyckis lived for over three decades and where Ludwik developed his love of running, to which he credited his excellent health. Dr. Rozycki practiced medicine for over forty-five years, retiring only after his 73rd birthday. He was beloved by his patients for his keen diagnostic skills, his sense of humor and for being one of the last remaining pediatricians practicing in Queens and Brooklyn still making house calls into the 1990s. He valued the companionship of his friends and loved his wife and his family above all else. He is survived by his daughters, Avital Soldatenko (Greg), Sarit Rozycki (Robert Cromwell) and three grandchildren. He was laid to rest in Israel, beside his beloved Lola. The funeral service was held at Westchester Reform Temple in Scarsdale and the family sat shiva at the house of his daughter, Avital. Memorial contributions may be sent to American Friends of Magen David Adom. 1/3"

2016-04-16T00:00:00Z,"RUSSELL--Stephen, a loving father and grandfather, an Indiana business leader, a philanthropist and a proponent of education and the arts passed away on April 15, 2016. He was 76 years of age. Steve was born March 9, 1940 in Brooklyn, New York. His father Michael Rosentraub, was a New York City Taxicab Driver and his mother Jenny Rosentraub, a homemaker. Unfortunately, Jenny died when Steve was just six years old. Steve often referred to the memory of her death, as a ""defining moment"" that built his tenacity to make every minute of life count. His drive and determination for success started at a young age. In 1956, Steve was then the youngest-ever graduate of Stuyvesant High School and received his undergraduate and graduate degrees from Cornell University, where he excelled academically and forged a lifelong relationship with the school. He had a varied and successful career with numerous accolades and achievements. Steve began his career in the mid 1960's at Ford Motor Company in the Product Planning Group. From Ford, he transitioned to become President of Hertz Trucks (present-day Penske Corporation). After leaving Hertz, Steve went on to hold the position of President and CEO of Seatrain Lines, a NYSE-listed company. Later, he led Barsac, a general contracting company responsible for the construction of Riyadh King Khalid Airport in Saudi Arabia. In 1985, Steve co-founded Celadon Group, Inc., and became the company's Chairman and CEO in 1995. Under his leadership, Celadon had grown to become one of Indiana's largest employers and one of the United States' top fifty truck transportation companies. His philanthropic endeavors were numerous. He worked tirelessly to give advantages to those in need. Some of his most notable contributions were in the areas of education and the arts. Steve was passionate about providing others with the advantage of an education. In addition to being a Life Member of the Cornell University Council and Emeritus Member of the Johnson Graduate School of Management Advisory Council, he established four separate scholarship funds and awards at Cornell. He was proud to have created and funded the Russell Family Scholarship, the Russell Family First Generation Scholarship, the Stephen Russell Family Teaching Award for the College of Arts and Sciences and the Stephen Russell Family Teaching Award for the Johnson Graduate School of Management. In his desire to make a difference closer to home, he formed The Russell Education Fund at Phoenix Theatre in Indianapolis, which provides theatre tickets to area students for local productions. Steve served on the boards of Herron High School, Eiteljorg Museum, IUPUI, Phoenix Theatre and, from 2010-2012, he served as the Chairman of the Indianapolis Museum of Art. Steve also funded the student access program at the IMA and contributed to the IMA Design Center, which was built in 2014. Steve's family was certainly his proudest achievement. He will be missed most by those who knew and loved him best. He is survived by his wife, Livia Klain Russell. He is also survived by the mother of his children, Margery Russell; beloved children, Melissa (Matthew) Rubel and their children, Jeffrey, Michael and Joshua; Stewart (Meg) Russell and their children, Charlie and Zachary; Jonathan (Sue) Russell and their children, Jason and William; sister, Pearl Greene and his nieces, Jan Greene and Victoria (Mohammad) Uni. Steve's brother, Jules Russell, preceded him in death. Funeral services will be held at Congregation Beth-El Zedeck, 600 West 70th Street, Indianapolis, Indiana 46260 on Sunday, April 17, 2016. Burial will follow in Beth-El Zedeck's Memorial Park Cemetery, Fishers, IN.

2016-04-17T00:00:00Z,"RUSSELL--Stephen, a loving father and grandfather, an Indiana business leader, a philanthropist and a proponent of education and the arts passed away on April 15, 2016. He was 76 years of age. Steve was born March 9, 1940 in Brooklyn, New York. His father Michael Rosentraub, was a New York City Taxicab Driver and his mother Jenny Rosentraub, a homemaker. Unfortunately, Jenny died when Steve was just six years old. Steve often referred to the memory of her death, as a ""defining moment"" that built his tenacity to make every minute of life count. His drive and determination for success started at a young age. In 1956, Steve was then the youngest-ever graduate of Stuyvesant High School and received his undergraduate and graduate degrees from Cornell University, where he excelled academically and forged a lifelong relationship with the school. He had a varied and successful career with numerous accolades and achievements. Steve began his career in the mid 1960's at Ford Motor Company in the Product Planning Group. From Ford, he transitioned to become President of Hertz Trucks (present-day Penske Corporation). After leaving Hertz, Steve went on to hold the position of President and CEO of Seatrain Lines, a NYSE-listed company. Later, he led Barsac, a general contracting company responsible for the construction of Riyadh King Khalid Airport in Saudi Arabia. In 1985, Steve co-founded Celadon Group, Inc., and became the company's Chairman and CEO in 1995. Under his leadership, Celadon had grown to become one of Indiana's largest employers and one of the United States' top fifty truck transportation companies. His philanthropic endeavors were numerous. He worked tirelessly to give advantages to those in need. Some of his most notable contributions were in the areas of education and the arts. Steve was passionate about providing others with the advantage of an education. In addition to being a Life Member of the Cornell University Council and Emeritus Member of the Johnson Graduate School of Management Advisory Council, he established four separate scholarship funds and awards at Cornell. He was proud to have created and funded the Russell Family Scholarship, the Russell Family First Generation Scholarship, the Stephen Russell Family Teaching Award for the College of Arts and Sciences and the Stephen Russell Family Teaching Award for the Johnson Graduate School of Management. In his desire to make a difference closer to home, he formed The Russell Education Fund at Phoenix Theatre in Indianapolis, which provides theatre tickets to area students for local productions. Steve served on the boards of Herron High School, Eiteljorg Museum, IUPUI, Phoenix Theatre and, from 2010-2012, he served as the Chairman of the Indianapolis Museum of Art. Steve also funded the student access program at the IMA and contributed to the IMA Design Center, which was built in 2014. Steve's family was certainly his proudest achievement. He will be missed most by those who knew and loved him best. He is survived by his wife, Livia Klain Russell. He is also survived by the mother of his children, Margery Russell; beloved children, Melissa (Matthew) Rubel and their children, Jeffrey, Michael and Joshua; Stewart (Meg) Russell and their children, Charlie and Zachary; Jonathan (Sue) Russell and their children, Jason and William; sister, Pearl Greene and his nieces, Jan Greene and Victoria (Mohammad) Uni. Steve's brother, Jules Russell, preceded him in death. Funeral services will be held at Congregation Beth-El Zedeck, 600 West 70th Street, Indianapolis, Indiana 46260 on Sunday, April 17, 2016. Burial will follow in Beth-El Zedeck's Memorial Park Cemetery, Fishers, IN. In keeping with his passion for helping others, contributions may be made in Steve's memory to: Cornell University, designated to the Russell Family First Generation Scholarship Fund, Cornell University, Box 25842, Lehigh Valley, PA 18003-9692; Services entrusted to A.R.N.

2016-04-17T00:00:00Z,"BOWMAN--Samuel. Samuel Andrew Bowman III, passed away at home on April 13, 2016 after a lengthy battle with cancer. Sam was born on December 30, 1936 in Springfield, Ohio to Thelma Elizabeth Corey and Samuel A. Bowman II. He attended The Ridgewood School, Elmwood Elementary, Exeter ('55) and Princeton University ('59). Sam was a patron of the arts and supported many cultural endeavors. He enjoyed a robust social life and belonged to numerous clubs and organizations in both New York and Ohio. His charitable activities were strong but reserved. Sam contributed to many worthy causes while avoiding self-promotion. He thought the sincerest gifts were those that were unannounced and unexpected. Many of the beneficiaries of his charity never saw it coming which appealed to his mischievous nature. Sam enjoyed a 47 year career in the financial industry working for Tucker and Anthony, H.G. Wellington and Ingalls and Snyder as an investment advisor. Sam's clients were his friends, and he took great pride in the fact that his friends entrusted him with their assets. His greatest professional joy came from knowing the positive impact he had on so many of his client's families and their financial wellbeing. As a keen observer of the human condition, Sam enjoyed and deftly navigated a fifty year relationship with New York City. Sam loved the City. He explored, experienced and shared all he learned about New York City and would frequently comment on the transformations he had witnessed over the past decades. Not so much with lament for the old, but a respect for the ever changing nature of the City. While life in the City intrigued Sam, it did not claim his soul. Sam's passion was his love for nature and all things natural. Sam and his wife Grace traveled the world extensively to experience many wonders and culturally significant locals. He loved his weekend retreat in Millbrook, New York where he and Grace would escape to enjoy a slower- paced life and take a deep breath. But his most special place was his family farm in Springfield, Ohio. Sam was an active owner of the Shawnee Farms which were designated as a centennial farm by the State of Ohio. Sam's relationship with this land spanned his entire life and he took great pride in the profitable operation of the farm and the extensive work by his team to conduct ecologically beneficial agricultural practices aimed at maintaining the land in pristine condition. Perhaps Sam's greatest last act was to apply agricultural easements to his farm in order to ensure that this farmland will be preserved for generations to come. Sam is survived by his loving wife Grace Grasselli Bowman, his sister Julie Bowman McGregor, half-sister Gail LeFevre and numerous step-children, nieces and nephews. He leaves behind literally a world of friends who are better people for having had Sam be a part of their lives. He was preceded in death by his parents and his brother John Elden Bowman. A memorial celebration of Sam's life will be held at his farm in Ohio. Contributions in Sam's memory can be made to the Tecumseh Land Trust or the Duchess Land Conservancy. 1/3"

With deep sadness we announce the death of Percy Chubb, III, of Bernardsville, NJ, who passed away on March 18th at Morristown Medical Center, after a sudden illness. Born in 1934 in New York City and known as ""Pie"" to family, ""Pi"" to business associates, and ""Ace"" to his grandchildren, Percy graduated from the Thacher School in Ojai, CA, and Yale University. He spent his professional career at Chubb and Son, later Chubb Corporation, the insurance company founded in 1882 by his grandfather and great-uncle, Hendon and Percy Chubb, where he began as a trainee in 1958. He became a Director of the company in 1978 and served in numerous capacities, more recently as Vice Chairman and as a member of the Policy Committee. He retired as an officer of the company in 1997. Percy was a trustee of the Wood's Hole Oceanographic Institute, the Mystic Seaport, and the New Jersey Performing Arts Center, and was a Director of Safeway Stores and First Fidelity Bank Corporation. For over forty years, he was a trustee of the Victoria Foundation, a Newark-based philanthropic institution founded in 1924 by his grandfather, Hendon Chubb, and dedicated to improving the lifetime prospects of stressed families in need. He spent thirty of those years serving as President of the Board. He was an experienced sailor and an avid and competitive outdoorsman, who loved hunting, fly fishing, tennis, and skiing, almost always with family and friends. In his later years he tolerated golf. Percy leaves behind his wife and dance partner of 59 years, the former Sally Gilady; three children, Lee Chubb and Lucy Chubb, both of Ketchum, Idaho, and Sarah Chubb Sauvayre of New York City; and four grandchildren who called him ""Ace,"" at his insistence. A memorial service and celebration of Percy's life is planned for May 14 at 4pm, at the Somerset Hills Country Club in Bernardsville, NJ.

2016-04-17T00:00:00Z,"KEAN--Hamilton Fish, died peacefully at home on April 7, 2016, at the age of 91. A graduate of St. Bernard's School, St. Mark's School, Princeton University, and Columbia Law School, Ham, as all his friends called him, was a lifelong New Yorker who led a rich and varied life that centered around his passions for learning, music, the environment, and his family. A proud Veteran of World War II, he finished his service as a second lieutenant and after the war completed his college and legal education. While Ham practiced law for several years, the majority of his professional life was dedicated to the causes he cared deeply about. Most prominent among these was the preservation of the environment. One of the earliest members of the board of Natural Resources Defense Council (NRDC), Ham taught environmental law courses at both the New York University School of Law and the State University of New York. He was an honorary trustee of NRDC at his death. Mental health and children's well-being were also issues important to Ham and he served for 50 years on the Board of Fountain House, eventually becoming Board President. A state leader for mental health advocates, he was a member of New York's Advisory Council on Mental Health and the Mental Health Services Council. In addition, Ham became involved in the Citizens' Committee for Children, eventually becoming Chair of that board as well. At his death, he was an honorary director of Action for Children. Even past 90, he was still active in civic life. He served on the board of Citizens for Global Solutions, eventually becoming its Chairman. At his death, he was the Chairman of a think tank called Center for War/Peace Studies. In addition to his dedication to the causes about which he was most passionate, his friends and family will remember his wonderful enthusiasm for musical theater and opera, his delight in history and poetry, his gentle humor and his deep generosity to all in need. He is survived by Edith W. Kean, his beloved wife of 27 years, and by Leslie, Lisa and Lewis, his children with his first wife, Ellen Garrison. His son, Garry, died in 2013. Ham is survived as well by five siblings, and six grandchildren: Eliza, Sam, and Henry Douglas; Nicolas and Simon Kean; and Paul McKim. He also leaves three step-children, and five step-grandchildren, by whom he was known affectionately as Hampa. A memorial service will be held at the Church of the Holy Trinity at 316 East 88th St., New York City, on April 30 at 11:00am. 1/3"
2016-04-17T00:00:00Z,"KEAN--Hamilton F. We mourn the passing of Fountain House Board Member, Hamilton F. Kean. Mr. Kean was elected to the Board in 1966 and, until his death, faithfully served in many capacities. He was a tireless advocate for those living with serious mental illness and a wise and caring leader of our organization. With the growth of the Fountain House community throughout his tenure as a Director, he provided guidance and leadership in addressing the challenges confronting the Board and the needs of Fountain House members. His commitment and clarity of vision were matched by his considerable kindness, grace, and warmth. The Fountain House community will miss him greatly, but his immeasurable contributions will be a lasting gift to us all. We express our sympathy to Ham's wife and our dear friend, Edie Kean, to Thomas H. Kean, a member of the Fountain House of New Jersey Board of Directors, and to the entire Kean family. Nancy L.

2016-04-17T00:00:00Z,"KEAN--Hamilton Fish. Citizens' Committee for Children of New York (CCC) mourns the passing of Hamilton F. Kean. We send our condolences to his family, friends, colleagues and those who share our profound respect for Ham's tireless commitment to community service and his impact on the lives of tens of thousands of New York's children and families. His unwavering goal of creating better, more responsive and comprehensive solutions to complicated problems that children frequently face distinguished him from many advocates. He was a particularly staunch advocate for children and adults with mental illness and understood the intricate balance between state hospitals and community care and always advocated for a full continuum of services for seriously mentally ill children. Ham's position never varied: using public resources more wisely, avoiding fads, providing help to children and families as early as possible and as close to home as possible. He was a master at the politics of child advocacy and the art of compromise. Ever thoughtful, balanced in his views, focused on the big picture and willing to wait out the smartest solution. Ham's involvement in CCC spanned nearly 50 years. He took our Community Leadership Course in 1968, became a Board Member in 1971 and assumed leadership of the Board just two years later, helping CCC navigate the rocky shoals of hard financial times in the 1970s. He received CCC's Eleanor Roosevelt Award in 2001 and remained active on the Board through 2006, when he was made an Honorary Director. Ham was an inspiration to all of us and will be deeply missed in our community. Jessica Aaron, Chair Diana Elghanayan, President Jennifer March, Executive Director 1/3"

Born on a kitchen table in Queens Village, Queens in 1921 to Rebecca and Abraham Kaplan, Marcia Kaplan Nielsen died in her Upper East Side home of 60 years on March 27, 2016. Marcia graduated from Queens College before moving to Washington, DC where she met Waldemar ""Wally"" Nielsen with whom she shared an indelible bond marked by 62 years of marriage. Some of Marcia's fondest years were those she spent in Paris from 1948-1952 where Wally worked in the Marshall Plan, and where their daughter Signe was born.

2016-04-18T00:00:00Z,"TOWNSEND--Dwight Hall, was born on January 4, 1933 in Paris, France to Lyle Stackpole and Frank Nelson Townsend. They fled France in the spring of 1939, expecting to return but ultimately settling in New York City. His father passed when he was 11, leaving Dwight in the care of his eccentric, theatrical mother. He attended prep school at Hotchkiss and Trinity-Pawling where he excelled at sports, before matriculating to Yale where music became his focus. He sang there with the Yale Glee Club, the Augmented Seven, and for his senior year - the group where he met many of the men who would become lifelong friends - the Whiffenpoofs. It was during this stage of life that he became known by the sobriquet, ""Froggy,"" an affectionate nod to his French origins. After Yale, he attended the American Academy of Theatrics and began a long and storied career in the dramatic arts - earning roles on and off Broadway, in cabaret, and summer stock productions. A move to Los Angeles brought golden years with roles in TV and film, a rollicking Hollywood lifestyle, and many a celebrity tennis match. He went on to earn a teaching degree from USC and taught in secondary and elementary schools in southern California for a brief stint before following the call of the arts, back to New York City. In 1976, he met his first wife, Charlene Gallit there. They moved to Fort Worth, Texas and had a daughter, Lesley Brooke Townsend (now Duval) in 1979. After becoming a father, his career turned to talent management, production, and theatrical design. Charlene and Dwight divorced amicably in 1991 and remained close friends until the very end. In 1995, Dwight pursued another of his true passions: creating and recording his own original music. Without a day of formal training, he was - and has always been - a truly gifted pianist and vocalist. He began to record albums, which he worked on until his absolute final days. Dwight met Carmen Sommers, his second wife and the love of his life, on a blind date set up by a mutual friend on August 14, 1993 (which happened to be the birthdate of his one and only granddaughter, Violet Brooke Duval, born twenty years to the day later in 2013). They fell in love instantly and married four years later in Bermuda, on Carmen's birthday. That fall, they moved to Vero Beach, Florida and have spent the better part of the past two decades living as lovebirds, surrounded by friends and family, their home filled with happiness and the constant sounds of his beautiful music. Dwight and Carmen celebrated their 19th wedding anniversary during his final days in the ICU (and he kicked himself for not getting her anything). His daughter, Lesley, is now expecting Dwight's first grandson, and she was able to share the wonderful news with him in his final moments. He passed peacefully while in hospice care, with his wife, daughter, and stepdaughter Carmencita by his side, after a two-month battle with pneumonia and cascading complications. He fought bravely until the doctors told him it was time to throw in the towel, at which point he accepted his fate with peace and dignity and said his loving final goodbyes. He leaves behind more adoring friends and extended family members than most people are lucky enough to meet in a lifetime. Husband, father, grandfather, friend, didactic defender of the sesquipedalian and devout extirpator of solecisms and catachreses, we will miss our dear Froggy so much. A private gathering will be held in celebration of his life. In lieu of flowers, please consider a donation to VNA Hospice of Vero Beach; or, simply pop in one of his CDs and hum along with him. 1/3"

Dan grew up in Cleveland, the son of Ezra and Sylvia Shapiro. He moved to New York to attend Columbia College and Law School, and received a Fulbright fellowship at the London School of Economics. He married the former Ellen Spingarn in 1964. In 1969, he co-founded the law firm Schulte Roth & Zabel, which grew to become a top firm with hundreds of attorneys. Dan was a pioneering tax and investment lawyer, particularly in the hedge fund industry, and last year won The Hedge Fund Journal Award for Outstanding Achievement in the Hedge Fund Industry. Over the last decade, he was also a partner in the investment firm Park Vale Capital. In 2002, he and his wife Ellen moved to London to open an office of Schulte Roth & Zabel and continued to live there while maintaining their residence in New York. Dan was a life-long leader in the Jewish community, serving as President of New York's Federation of Jewish Philanthropies and a founder of the Jewish Community Relations Council. He also served as Secretary of the New York City Partnership and on the Board of Governors and Executive Committee of the Weizmann Institute of Science in Israel. He spearheaded the 1986 merger of UJA and Federation of Jewish Philanthropies to become UJA Federation of New York. Dan loved music and singing, which he did frequently, playing tennis at Century Country Club, and spending time with his family and friends. Besides his wife Ellen, Dan is survived by his beloved sister Rena Olshansky of Cleveland, in-laws Jane and Jim Spingarn and by three sons and seven grandchildren, who were his proudest achievement: Jonathan and his children Journey and Jasper; Andrew, his wife Nina, and their children Eliza, William, and Charlotte; and Peter, his wife Rebecca, and their children Roxy and Simon.

Each man counted off, the ones matched with the nation's newly-formed Air Force, the twos stayed in the Army. Harry counted off one, and went on to serve proudly as a jet pilot from 1953 to 1956, attaining the rank of Captain. Harry counted life itself a blessing. He skied into his eighties, and took long walks until cancer took his strength earlier this year. He perished in the midst of outlining a book, on how to be active and joyful after eighty. Harry felt he had glimpsed a few secrets to life, and sought to share them widely. Harry was 84 when he passed away, on Saturday, March 12, 2016 in Stamford, CT. He was a resident of Bondville, VT and Darien, CT. Born on July 1, 1931 in Carroll, IA, he was the son of the late Harry and Frances Talcott Upton. He received a B.S. degree from Iowa State University and a M.B.A. from Stanford University. Harry had a distinguished career in business. In 1958 he joined Proctor & Gamble in product management. He went on to join Abbott Labs, where he rose to become president of the consumer products division. Later, he started his own firm, and then founded Care Technologies, where he was granted two patents. After retiring in 2004, Harry invested his time in the community as a volunteer and board member. Throughout his life he unwaveringly greeted friends and colleagues with a firm handshake. Harry is survived by his wife Peggy Upton and three children, Elise Upton Young of Darien; Brett Upton of Rutland, VT; Matt Upton of Denver, CO. His eyes twinkled when he spent time with his four grandchildren Ryann Price, David Young, Meriel Upton, and Mac Upton. He was predeceased by his siblings Robert Upton, Donald Upton, and Marge Doty.

2016-04-20T00:00:00Z,"TORRICINI--Angelo, a noted designer of both fashion and interiors, died in St. Augustine, FL on April 18th. He was 87. The cause was complications brought on by cancer of the kidney. Mr. Torricini spent over 50 years in the design world, firstly in the ateliers of Paris, before arriving in New York City in the late 1950's being sponsored by the dance choreographer, Jerome Robbins. Starting in the garment district on Manhattan's west side cutting patterns, it wasn't long before he was able to open his own boutique on East 63rd Street specializing in ladies millinery and accessories. With his effervescent personality and helpful promotion from friends, including the renowned duo pianists Arthur Gold and Robert Fizdale, he was soon producing works for many of Manhattan's elite. His keen eye for color as well as a great sense of the dramatic soon spilled over into the world of interior design, where he was asked to assist his many friends with their own homes which he did with great style. This transition into interior design soon led him to him to several extended stints on cruise ships where he designed interiors on boats of Dutch, Greek and Italian registry over a ten year period. His later years were spent mostly seeking works of art for his own homes in Manhattan, Sag Harbor and Florida. Angelo Rene Torricini was born in Fort-de-France, Martinique on December 14, 1928 to Paul Jean and Marie Josephine Torricini, where his father was stationed with the French military. His father's career included postings in many exotic locations influencing both Mr. Torricini and his sculptor sister Claude with their own aesthetic. He was predeceased by his wife Katherine Stainton Torricini and a brother Robert. He is survived by his dear friend Jerome Jacalone, sister Claude Torricini and her husband Michel Moritz of Paris, a niece Marilyn, a cousin Sandra and a sister-in-law Eveline.

2016-04-21T00:00:00Z,"LIEBER--Charles D. Died peacefully at home in Spencertown, New York, on April 3 at 95 years old. He is survived by his loving wife of 55 years, Mimi Levin Lieber; children Janno, James, Theo and Angie; daughters-in-law Amy Glosser, Leah Lieber and Deborah Levitt; son-in-law Matthew Sussman; and 10 grandchildren. Born January 30, 1921 in The Netherlands, the only child of Zygmunt Lieber of Krakow and Gabriele Lifczis of Vienna, he was raised in Vienna, Antwerp and Brussels, and attended Frensham Heights School in England. A student at the Universite Libre de Bruxelles when the Nazis invaded Belgium in May 1940, he fled via France and Spain to Morocco before arriving in New York in mid-1941. Charles served in the U.S. Army from 1942 to 1946, finishing as a second lieutenant. His mother was deported from France to Auschwitz in 1942, while his father and stepmother spent the war in today's Mozambique. Charles received a B.A. from The New School in 1948. He then worked at Knopf Publishing and headed the college department at Random House until 1964, when he bought academic textbook publisher Atherton Press, later merging it to form Aldine Atherton. In 1980, he acquired Hebrew Publishing Company, the oldest American publisher of Judaica. He was a member of the Lenox Hill Democratic Club and a candidate for State Assembly in 1960. In July 1960, Charles married Mimi Levin. They raised their four children on Manhattan's Upper West Side. Charles was active in many different organizations, including as leader of the Reconstructionist Foundation and the West Side Jewish Community Council. At various times he served on the boards of the Society for the Advancement of Judaism, the Chatham Synagogue, Close Encounters with Music in the Berkshires and St. Ann's School in Brooklyn. Charles was a lover of language, music, books, pipes, coffee, Central European cooking, and friendship. He enjoyed connecting with everyone he met from whatever walk of life - when possible, in their native language - and whatever age. He was loved and admired by many - especially his family. 1/3"

2016-04-21T00:00:00Z,"CAMPBELL--William V. ""Bill,"" '62CC, '64TC, '15HON. The President and Trustees of Columbia University mourn the passing of William V. ""Bill"" Campbell, whose service to the University was profound, his impact beyond measure. Chair of the Board of Trustees from 2005 to 2014, Bill helped Columbia through one of the most dynamic eras in its history, which included the planning and groundbreaking of the new Manhattanville campus and the fulfillment of The Columbia Campaign - at that time, the largest single fundraising effort in Ivy League history. With a devotion to Columbia that stretched all the way back to his undergraduate years, when he captained the 1961 Ivy League Champion Lions, Bill was a trusted friend and energetic advocate for the University and its students, faculty, and alumni. A graduate of Columbia College and Teachers College, Bill was a loyal and passionate alumnus, and a driving force in the creation of the Columbia Alumni Association after he joined the University Trustees in 2003. Columbia continually benefitted from Bill's wisdom, judgment, and clear and optimistic vision for the University's future. He was a member of the Columbia College Annual Fund Steering Committee, co-chair of the Athletics Leadership Committee, and member of the Core to Commencement Campaign Steering Committee. Bill was devoted to the success of the athletics program as a whole, but was particularly invested in Columbia Football, and was the heart of the football alumni community. Not only was he proud of his experiences as a player at Columbia, but he also often talked about the lessons he learned as Columbia's head football coach from 1974 to 1979, en route to a successful career as an executive in Silicon Valley. In 2013, the University opened the Campbell Sports Center in his honor. The state-of-the-art facility fosters Columbia's spirit and transforms the student-athlete experience. The following year, the Athletics program retired his uniform number 67 for all 31 of Columbia's varsity teams. For his many contributions to Columbia, Bill also received the highest honors bestowed upon our alumni, including the Alexander Hamilton Medal and the John Jay Award. In 2015, he was awarded an honorary Doctor of Laws degree and the Columbia Alumni Association Alumni Medal, which recognizes alumni for distinguished service of ten years or more. Bill's belief in Columbia University has inspired us for decades and the legacy he leaves will be felt for all time. Bill is survived by his son Jim Campbell and daughter Maggie Campbell; his wife Eileen Bocci Campbell and her children, Kevin, Matthew, and Kate Bocci; and his former wife, Roberta Campbell. To them and to the many he touched, Columbia University extends its deepest sympathies. Thank you, Coach. 1/3"

He is survived by his children and their spouses Eileen and Steven Farbman and Steven and Tina Price, his grandchildren Alexandra and Ben (spouse), Leo, Lucy, and Kyle, and his sister Myrna Holzman. Filled with optimism, grit, and determination, he lived fully, deeply and passionately loved his family and friends, was always thinking, pushing, driving forward and was imbued with faith. He mastered the art of politics, business and philanthropy. The world was a better place because of his presence. Robert Price was born in the Bronx and proudly lived in New York City all his life. He was a graduate of the Bronx High School of Science, New York University, and Columbia Law School. He served to Corporal in the United States Army from 1953-55. He practiced law in New York City and was a member of the New York and several Federal bars, including the Second Circuit and United States Supreme Court. He served as Assistant United States Attorney (Criminal Division) for the Southern District of New York from 1959-60. Price loved politics from an early age, and at age 19 introduced future President Dwight Eisenhower at a Madison Square Garden rally. Price found his calling as a campaign manager and never lost an election. He was campaign manager for his friend John Lindsay's Congressional elections from 1958-64, and was campaign manager when Lindsay won the New York City mayoralty in 1965. Price also served as campaign manager for Nelson Rockefeller's only victory in a presidential primary, in Oregon in 1964, and was campaign manager for his former law partner Theodore Kupferman's election to Congress in 1966. Price served as Deputy Mayor of New York City from 1966-67, and was profiled on the cover of The New York Times Magazine. He was named one of the Junior Chamber of Commerce's Ten Outstanding Young Men in 1966, along with Joseph Califano and Ralph Nader. Price left politics to become a successful businessman. He was Director and Executive Vice President of The Dreyfus Corporation and Investment Officer of The Dreyfus Fund from 1967-69, President of Price Capital Corporation from 1969-72, and General Partner and General Counsel of Lazard Freres & Co. from 1972-79. He was the founder, Chairman, and President of Price Communications Corporation from 1979-2007, and also the founder of PriCellular Corporation, of which he was Director and President from 1990-97 and Chairman from 1997-98. He was a longstanding member of Park Avenue Synagogue. He was also a proud member of the Council on Foreign Relations. He served as Representative of the Majority Leader and President Pro Tem of the New York Senate and as a member of the Board of Directors and Vice Chairman of the Municipal Assistance Corporation for the City of New York. He also served as the Governor of New York State's nominee as trustee of the City University of New York and was a commissioner on the New York State Commission of Investigations. The Robert Price Center for Environmental Studies in Jerusalem is named in his honor. For those who wish to make a contribution, please send any donations, in memory of Robert Price, to the Center for Israel Studies at Columbia Law School or the Icahn School of Medicine at Mt. Sinai. May his memory be a blessing. 1/3"

2016-04-24T00:00:00Z,"CAMPBELL--William. To sum up the life of Bill Campbell, who died peacefully in his sleep this week with his family by his side, is a daunting and fundamentally impossible task - Bill's life and accomplishments were so vast and varied that even those who knew him best were only lucky enough to have witnessed a portion of them. Tributes to his astonishing legacy in Silicon Valley have already been pouring in, and rightly so. It is a legacy that is difficult to fathom. He had a hand in almost every consequential technology company of the past 30 years, either through direct relationship or through his coaching and mentoring of the company's key players, (and, in the case of Intuit, Claris, and Go, through his own tenure as CEO). From Apple to Google to Amazon to Twitter, from his mentorship of the iconic venture capitalists who helped shape the Valley to his under-the-radar involvement with legions of nerdy and unsexy companies barely known outside the tech community, but whose presences and innovations changed the technology landscape - Bill was always there, all smiles and hugs, his essence embedded in the company's DNA, pushing everyone involved to be better managers, more creative, and, most importantly, better people, to be the most authentic and truest versions of themselves. He is probably best known for being ""the Coach,"" a mentor to legends; as the legends themselves would be the first to tell you, he was so much more than the sum of those he advised. He was himself a legend. He was the legend. Bill was a man of beautiful and almost impossible contrasts. He was profane in a way that was unacceptable in many barrooms, let alone in church, and a devout Catholic who rarely missed Sunday Mass. A workaholic who pushed himself and those around him beyond their natural and professional limits, and a devoted husband and quite possibly the best father in history, who never, no matter what momentous occasion was on his schedule, missed an important event in his kids' lives. Famously honest and blunt (and sometimes even harsh), he would never hesitate to let you know when you were ""messing up""; but when you were messing up, he'd be the guy who'd answer your call at all hours of the night and, with inspiring patience and empathy, talk you through whatever mistakes you had made and how you were supposed to rectify them. He preached teamwork and compassion and love. In many ways he seemed a throwback to a different era, a manly man, a jock's jock, gruff, aggressive, macho, old-fashioned, and yet he was comfortable and even thrived around dorks, dweebs, outcasts of all types- a ""nerd whisperer,"" as one journalist put it. His identity as ""the Coach"" was derived from both his general football-coaching demeanor and his time as an actual football coach, with all the good and bad that that particular stereotype entails; he was a passionate advocate for the advancement of women in Silicon Valley and for the LGBT community. He was never happier than at the annual 8th grade graduation at Sacred Heart Schools in Atherton, CA, when, year after year, a stream of students, boys and girls alike, would offer remembrances and speak movingly of by far their most meaningful experience at the school: getting the chance to play flag football for Coach Campbell, absorbing the lessons he taught them, lessons that were, perhaps not surprisingly, essentially identical to the lessons Coach had imparted to those he'd coached in the adult world. Teamwork. Structure. Integrity. Accountability. Passion. Hard work. Empathy. Love. Traits he'd learned growing up in Homestead, PA, where he would end up donating millions of dollars to education and youth projects. A final common refrain about Bill: Everyone who knew Bill thought of him as their best friend. Bill was a people person. He oozed charisma. When he talked to you he made you feel like you were the only person that mattered. It might be tempting for those who didn't know Bill that well to conclude that all this was just some act. How could one person be so overflowing with joy, with the amount of joy and love requisite for connection with such a staggering number of people on such a profound level - Obviously it had to be an act. It wasn't. He really did love people the way they loved him. New friends were made wherever he went. Often they were baristas, waiters, and, let's face it, bartenders, people who didn't know initially who he was and in some cases never would. He had friends in high and low places and everywhere in between. It was infectious. He was a uniter, he imparted his worldview onto his friends and mixed his groups of friends together, so that friends in California became close with friends from Homestead and New York and elsewhere; wealthy friends grew to love friends who were less well off and vice versa; tech friends, academic friends, and football friends were molded into one great big Bill Campbell group. Bill Campbell never saw wealth or social status or anything artificial when judging the merits of people. He sought in others the same qualities he himself so fully embodied. Bill's friends, and there were many, by definition embodied his values; he wouldn't have been friends with them if they hadn't. Bill Campbell really did believe that everyone who lived by his values, friend or not, was fundamentally the same, of equal goodness, of equal worth. On this last point, sadly, he was somewhat mistaken. Indeed when you get down to it most people are essentially the same, most of their differences are artificial. But Bill Campbell was better than everyone. And all of his friends are infinitely better off for having known him. William Vincent Campbell Jr., who was born August 31, 1940 in Homestead, PA and who died April 18, 2016 in Palo Alto, CA, is survived by his wife Eileen Bocci Campbell, his two children Jim and Maggie, and his three step children Kevin, Matthew, and Kate Bocci. A Funeral Mass will be held Monday, April 25th at Sacred Heart Preparatory in Atherton, CA at 11am. In lieu of flowers, the family, per Bill's wishes, requests that donations be made to the American Cancer Society, or, for the benefit of the community of Homestead, PA, to the Campbell Education and Community Foundation.

2016-04-24T00:00:00Z,"ADAMS--Peter D.,died Saturday, April 16th. Peter graduated from the University of Wales, Aberystwyth and obtained his PhD in Physics from Imperial College, London in 1964. He was elected a Fellow of the American Physical Society in 1972, and was a Fellow of the Institute of Physics, London. After five years of research in condensed-matter physics at Brookhaven National Laboratory, he was appointed Senior Editor of Physical Review B, a position he held until 2012. During those 40 years, he held appointments as Deputy Managing Editor and Deputy Editor in Chief of the American Physical Society Journals. In addition to overseeing the personnel and financial issues of the Editorial Offices of the Society, he also played an instrumental role in the phenomenal growth of Physical Review B, a premier journal in all of condensed and materials physics. Perhaps closest to his professional heart was Peter's success at transforming the peer review process for scholarly physics at the Society. Always a visionary, Peter was responsible for leaving behind paper and moving his office into a digital environment. All aspects of work at the editorial office were included in this decades long revolution. His efforts formed a firm foundation for today's continuing work. Peter was dearly loved and will be sadly missed by his wife, two children and five grandchildren. In lieu of flowers, donations may be made in Peter's name to the Leukemia Research Foundation. 1/3"

Throughout her life, Josephine was a seeker of the truth and passionate about teaching the sacred dances of G. I. Gurdjieff. During the last thirty years of her life, she worked tirelessly with others to faithfully document and record these sacred dances for future generations.

Thereafter her family moved to Princeton, New Jersey and then to New York City. Josephine trained as a classical violinist from an early age, having studied with Cellist Alexander Schneider. In 1949, Josephine went to Paris with her mother and continued her schooling. It was there she met G.I.

In 1958, Josephine married Morris Llewellyn Thatcher (Lew), while he was a young officer in the United States Navy. She graduated from Barnard College that same year with a degree in French and began her teaching career at The Brearley School in New York. Josephine moved to Venezuela with her husband Lew when he got a job with the Venezuelan government. All three of their children were born there. The family returned to the United States so Lew could complete his doctoral studies at M.I.T. While living in Massachusetts, Josephine taught elementary school at Buckingham Browne & Nichols School.

Josephine's later years were divided between Western North Carolina and Nova Scotia, Canada.

Born August 1930 in Brooklyn. He moved during childhood to Passaic, NJ, where he returned to raise his family and practice medicine after the University of Pennsylvania and New York University Medical School, and serving as a physician in the peace-time Air Force (in Morocco). He was a very respected Internist and Cardiologist, partnering with Irving Ehrenfeld and Alvin Ehrlich to form the Passaic Internal Medicine Group, and attending at Passaic General and Beth Israel Hospitals. In 40 years of practice, he earned his patients' appreciation because of his cardiology expertise, kindness and availability. He also was ahead of his time in recognizing the role of psychological factors in contributing to heart disease and communicated this understanding in his care. He was a passionate collector (stamps, antique toy cars, brass microscopes), horticulturalist, swimmer, traveler, and Brooklyn Dodgers fan. He moved to Upper Montclair, NJ in 1978, but remained hugely proud of his Passaic background. He was an active University of Pennsylvania and NYU Medical alumnus.

2016-04-25T00:00:00Z,"CAMPBELL--William. To sum up the life of Bill Campbell, who died peacefully in his sleep this week with his family by his side, is a daunting and fundamentally impossible task - Bill's life and accomplishments were so vast and varied that even those who knew him best were only lucky enough to have witnessed a portion of them. Tributes to his astonishing legacy in Silicon Valley have already been pouring in, and rightly so. It is a legacy that is difficult to fathom. He had a hand in almost every consequential technology company of the past 30 years, either through direct relationship or through his coaching and mentoring of the company's key players, (and, in the case of Intuit, Claris, and Go, through his own tenure as CEO). From Apple to Google to Amazon to Twitter, from his mentorship of the iconic venture capitalists who helped shape the Valley to his under-the-radar involvement with legions of nerdy and unsexy companies barely known outside the tech community, but whose presences and innovations changed the technology landscape - Bill was always there, all smiles and hugs, his essence embedded in the company's DNA, pushing everyone involved to be better managers, more creative, and, most importantly, better people, to be the most authentic and truest versions of themselves. He is probably best known for being ""the Coach,"" a mentor to legends; as the legends themselves would be the first to tell you, he was so much more than the sum of those he advised. He was himself a legend. He was the legend. Bill was a man of beautiful and almost impossible contrasts. He was profane in a way that was unacceptable in many barrooms, let alone in church, and a devout Catholic who rarely missed Sunday Mass. A workaholic who pushed himself and those around him beyond their natural and professional limits, and a devoted husband and quite possibly the best father in history, who never, no matter what momentous occasion was on his schedule, missed an important event in his kids' lives. Famously honest and blunt (and sometimes even harsh), he would never hesitate to let you know when you were ""messing up""; but when you were messing up, he'd be the guy who'd answer your call at all hours of the night and, with inspiring patience and empathy, talk you through whatever mistakes you had made and how you were supposed to rectify them. He preached teamwork and compassion and love. In many ways he seemed a throwback to a different era, a manly man, a jock's jock, gruff, aggressive, macho, old-fashioned, and yet he was comfortable and even thrived around dorks, dweebs, outcasts of all types- a ""nerd whisperer,"" as one journalist put it. His identity as ""the Coach"" was derived from both his general football-coaching demeanor and his time as an actual football coach, with all the good and bad that that particular stereotype entails; he was a passionate advocate for the advancement of women in Silicon Valley and for the LGBT community. He was never happier than at the annual 8th grade graduation at Sacred Heart Schools in Atherton, CA, when, year after year, a stream of students, boys and girls alike, would offer remembrances and speak movingly of by far their most meaningful experience at the school: getting the chance to play flag football for Coach Campbell, absorbing the lessons he taught them, lessons that were, perhaps not surprisingly, essentially identical to the lessons Coach had imparted to those he'd coached in the adult world. Teamwork. Structure. Integrity. Accountability. Passion. Hard work. Empathy. Love. Traits he'd learned growing up in Homestead, PA, where he would end up donating millions of dollars to education and youth projects. A final common refrain about Bill: Everyone who knew Bill thought of him as their best friend. Bill was a people person. He oozed charisma. When he talked to you he made you feel like you were the only person that mattered. It might be tempting for those who didn't know Bill that well to conclude that all this was just some act. How could one person be so overflowing with joy, with the amount of joy and love requisite for connection with such a staggering number of people on such a profound level - Obviously it had to be an act. It wasn't. He really did love people the way they loved him. New friends were made wherever he went. Often they were baristas, waiters, and, let's face it, bartenders, people who didn't know initially who he was and in some cases never would. He had friends in high and low places and everywhere in between. It was infectious. He was a uniter, he imparted his worldview onto his friends and mixed his groups of friends together, so that friends in California became close with friends from Homestead and New York and elsewhere; wealthy friends grew to love friends who were less well off and vice versa; tech friends, academic friends, and football friends were molded into one great big Bill Campbell group. Bill Campbell never saw wealth or social status or anything artificial when judging the merits of people. He sought in others the same qualities he himself so fully embodied. Bill's friends, and there were many, by definition embodied his values; he wouldn't have been friends with them if they hadn't. Bill Campbell really did believe that everyone who lived by his values, friend or not, was fundamentally the same, of equal goodness, of equal worth. On this last point, sadly, he was somewhat mistaken. Indeed when you get down to it most people are essentially the same, most of their differences are artificial. But Bill Campbell was better than everyone. And all of his friends are infinitely better off for having known him. William Vincent Campbell Jr., who was born August 31, 1940 in Homestead, PA and who died April 18, 2016 in Palo Alto, CA, is survived by his wife Eileen Bocci Campbell, his two children Jim and Maggie, and his three step children Kevin, Matthew, and Kate Bocci. A Funeral Mass will be held Monday, April 25th at Sacred Heart Preparatory in Atherton, CA at 11am. In lieu of flowers, the family, per Bill's wishes, requests that donations be made to the American Cancer Society, or, for the benefit of the community of Homestead, PA, to the Campbell Education and Community Foundation.

He would do anything for his children - such as taking a love-sick teen to JFK in the middle of the night so she could say goodbye to her foreign exchange student. He then took her home and got up at 6am to go to work. Fred Kessner volunteered and served in World War II in the battle of Okinawa as a radar technician in the Navy. He went back to college at CCNY under the GI bill and received a Bachelor's degree and graduated as an Electrical Engineer. Eventually, he became the Director of the Codes Bureau of the New York State Division of Housing and Urban Renewal until his retirement in 1996. He attended the Hofstra PEIR group, enjoyed his colleagues' presentations, and brightened them with his jabs of wit. His own presentations were wide-ranging and thorough. He had a second ""career"" as an actor in community theatre and he enjoyed playing ""the heavies"" especially Goldberg in Harold Pinter's ""Birthday Party"". He was a fabulous Granddad to David, Sam, Sarah Beth, Alyson Sheryl, Leah Rose and Evan Jake. He is survived by me - his wife Ellen Zelda, his son Neil Harry (wife Sandra), and his daughter Deborah Jean Indursky (husband Jerrold). He was predeceased by our daughter Sheryl Maude in 1980, and together we went through the trauma of her murder, becoming active in the victims' rights movement. A memorial service to celebrate his life will be held at a later date. 1/3"

2016-04-26T00:00:00Z,"WEYMOUTH--George A. June 2, 1936 - April 24, 2016. George A. ""Frolic"" Weymouth was a visionary conservationist, philanthropist, a highly-talented artist and accomplished sportsman. In 1967, Weymouth and two friends purchased two parcels of land in Chadds Ford totaling 47 acres that were threatened with industrial development, thereby founding the organization that became the Brandywine Conservancy & Museum of Art. Later that year, Weymouth was instrumental in acquiring Hofmann's Mill, a 19th-century structure perched on the banks of the Brandywine River. His founding of an organization that preserved both the natural and cultural resources of the Brandywine was visionary. The Brandywine Conservancy is now one of the leading land trusts in country, with 62,000 acres of land permanently protected in Pennsylvania and Delaware; the Brandywine River Museum of Art currently has a collection of 4,000 works of art and has brought international attention to the region's artistic legacy. Betsy Wyeth, wife of Andrew Wyeth and a good friend of Frolic's, encouraged him to purchase and convert the mill into a museum, promising him art to hang on the walls. After extensive renovation, including the addition of a soaring lobby with three floors of floor-to-ceiling windows, the Brandywine River Museum of Art opened in 1971. Born in 1936 in Wilmington, Delaware, to George and Dulcinea (du Pont) Weymouth, Frolic Weymouth grew up in Greenville, Delaware and spent the greater part of his life living in the Brandywine Valley. The nickname ""Frolic,"" given to him in childhood, perfectly embodied the joy with which he lived his life and his irrepressible sense of humor. Encouraged by his artistic mother, Weymouth began painting as a child and continued at St. Mark's School (class of '54) and Yale University (class of '58). As a teenager, he was introduced to Andrew Wyeth, who became an artistic mentor and lifelong friend. It was Wyeth and his brother-in-law, Peter Hurd, who suggested Weymouth experiment with tempera, a technique he mastered. Over a six-decade career as an artist Weymouth exhibited the landscapes, flower studies and portraits for which he was known, including paintings of friends and family as well as international notables such as Luciano Pavarotti and His Royal Highness Prince Philip, in numerous exhibitions including those at the Brandywine River Museum of Art. His paintings are in major private and museum collections such as the Metropolitan Museum of Art. For more than 40 years, Frolic was a well-known figure in coaching circles and he exhibited his four matched bay Standard-bred horses and antique carriages annually in the country's leading shows. One of only two Americans to be a member of The Coaching Club (England), he was the current president of the Four-in-Hand Club. Weymouth coached regularly at the Devon Horse Show and permanently retired a trophy. He founded the Vicmead Coaching Club and was past Chairman of the Board of the Brandywine Polo Club. His annual carriaging weekend each May at The Big Bend, his home in Chadds Ford, PA, drew participants from around the country and included a scenic drive to Winterthur, six miles away. This custom became part of the tradition of the Point-to-Point races, initiated in 1979. Weymouth's passionate interest in architectural preservation is perhaps best expressed by his own home, The Big Bend, a 17th-century Swedish trading post with an 18th-century addition. The structure had been long uninhabited until he purchased the property, and lovingly restored it, adding extensive gardens. Weymouth was an active member of the arts and environmental communities nationally and received numerous awards. He was appointed by President Nixon to the Commission of Fine Arts, on which he served from 1972 to 1977. In 1974 he served on the Visual Arts Panel of the Pennsylvania Council on the Arts. He was the recipient of the University of Delaware's Merit Award for Community Service, the National Arts Club's Annual Award and the Cliveden Heritage Award. He received an honorary Doctor of Humane letters from the University of Delaware and the Henry Francis du Pont Award from Winterthur Museum & Country Estate in recognition of his lifelong dedication to preserving the beauty, history and unique heritage of the Brandywine Valley. Weymouth was also awarded a Special Citation from The Garden Club of America and the Lifetime Conservation Leadership Award from the Pennsylvania Land Trust Association. He was also a member of the Farmer's Club and the Quill & Grill. When Weymouth constructed a chapel on his property, he inscribed the following words: ""This chapel was built to thank God for a wonderful life filled with fun, humor, work, sport and beauty. A close loving family; loyal and unique friends, and a fabulous son, Mac."" G.A.W. 1995. Each time he would talk to his son Mac Weymouth he would remind him to ""look for something beautiful every day."" George A. Weymouth is survived by his son, McCoy ""Mac"" du Pont Weymouth and his wife Toni Toomey- Weymouth; their children, Sophie Tyler Brown and Misha Kai Toomey-Brown; his brother, Eugene E. Weymouth and sister, Patricia Weymouth Hobbs. He is also survived by Anna Brelsford McCoy, to whom he was married until 1979, and his companion, Carlton Cropper.

2016-04-27T00:00:00Z,"WEYMOUTH--George A. June 2, 1936 - April 24, 2016. George A. ""Frolic"" Weymouth was a visionary conservationist, philanthropist, a highly-talented artist and accomplished sportsman. In 1967, Weymouth and two friends purchased two parcels of land in Chadds Ford totaling 47 acres that were threatened with industrial development, thereby founding the organization that became the Brandywine Conservancy & Museum of Art. Later that year, Weymouth was instrumental in acquiring Hofmann's Mill, a 19th-century structure perched on the banks of the Brandywine River. His founding of an organization that preserved both the natural and cultural resources of the Brandywine was visionary. The Brandywine Conservancy is now one of the leading land trusts in country, with 62,000 acres of land permanently protected in Pennsylvania and Delaware; the Brandywine River Museum of Art currently has a collection of 4,000 works of art and has brought international attention to the region's artistic legacy. Betsy Wyeth, wife of Andrew Wyeth and a good friend of Frolic's, encouraged him to purchase and convert the mill into a museum, promising him art to hang on the walls. After extensive renovation, including the addition of a soaring lobby with three floors of floor-to-ceiling windows, the Brandywine River Museum of Art opened in 1971. Born in 1936 in Wilmington, Delaware, to George and Dulcinea (du Pont) Weymouth, Frolic Weymouth grew up in Greenville, Delaware and spent the greater part of his life living in the Brandywine Valley. The nickname ""Frolic,"" given to him in childhood, perfectly embodied the joy with which he lived his life and his irrepressible sense of humor. Encouraged by his artistic mother, Weymouth began painting as a child and continued at St. Mark's School (class of '54) and Yale University (class of '58). As a teenager, he was introduced to Andrew Wyeth, who became an artistic mentor and lifelong friend. It was Wyeth and his brother-in-law, Peter Hurd, who suggested Weymouth experiment with tempera, a technique he mastered. Over a six-decade career as an artist Weymouth exhibited the landscapes, flower studies and portraits for which he was known, including paintings of friends and family as well as international notables such as Luciano Pavarotti and His Royal Highness Prince Philip, in numerous exhibitions including those at the Brandywine River Museum of Art. His paintings are in major private and museum collections such as the Metropolitan Museum of Art. For more than 40 years, Frolic was a well-known figure in coaching circles and he exhibited his four matched bay Standard-bred horses and antique carriages annually in the country's leading shows. One of only two Americans to be a member of The Coaching Club (England), he was the current president of the Four-in-Hand Club. Weymouth coached regularly at the Devon Horse Show and permanently retired a trophy. He founded the Vicmead Coaching Club and was past Chairman of the Board of the Brandywine Polo Club. His annual carriaging weekend each May at The Big Bend, his home in Chadds Ford, PA, drew participants from around the country and included a scenic drive to Winterthur, six miles away. This custom became part of the tradition of the Point-to-Point races, initiated in 1979. Weymouth's passionate interest in architectural preservation is perhaps best expressed by his own home, The Big Bend, a 17th-century Swedish trading post with an 18th-century addition. The structure had been long uninhabited until he purchased the property, and lovingly restored it, adding extensive gardens. Weymouth was an active member of the arts and environmental communities nationally and received numerous awards. He was appointed by President Nixon to the Commission of Fine Arts, on which he served from 1972 to 1977. In 1974 he served on the Visual Arts Panel of the Pennsylvania Council on the Arts. He was the recipient of the University of Delaware's Merit Award for Community Service, the National Arts Club's Annual Award and the Cliveden Heritage Award. He received an honorary Doctor of Humane letters from the University of Delaware and the Henry Francis du Pont Award from Winterthur Museum & Country Estate in recognition of his lifelong dedication to preserving the beauty, history and unique heritage of the Brandywine Valley. Weymouth was also awarded a Special Citation from The Garden Club of America and the Lifetime Conservation Leadership Award from the Pennsylvania Land Trust Association. He was also a member of the Farmer's Club and the Quill & Grill. When Weymouth constructed a chapel on his property, he inscribed the following words: ""This chapel was built to thank God for a wonderful life filled with fun, humor, work, sport and beauty. A close loving family; loyal and unique friends, and a fabulous son, Mac."" G.A.W. 1995. Each time he would talk to his son Mac Weymouth he would remind him to ""look for something beautiful every day."" George A. Weymouth is survived by his son, McCoy ""Mac"" du Pont Weymouth and his wife Toni Toomey- Weymouth; their children, Sophie Tyler Brown and Misha Kai Toomey-Brown; his brother, Eugene E.
