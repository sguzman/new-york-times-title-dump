1894-06-24T00:00:00Z,"CONEY ISLAND, June 23 -- The weather brought an old-time crowd to the island this afternoon. The people began to pour in from the steamboat piers and railroad stations at noon, and at 1 o'clock to-night Police Captain Clayton estimated that there were 30,000 visitors here.

Eardley-Wilmot of the British Navy, who has for a long time insisted that a limited number of warrant officers should be advanced to higher positions in the service, gives his reasons why they should be in a letter to The United Service Magazine. ""In my opinion,"" he writes, ""it is a mistake to entirely close the door upon legitimate aspiration for advancement."
1894-06-24T00:00:00Z,"LONDON, June 23 -- Although some of the visible commotion on the surface of the European situation has smoothed down during the week, there is no risk in saying that the danger underneath has been increased rather than diminished. It is true that England and Germany have ostentatiously composed their differences and publicly fallen on each other's neck in token of reconciliation."
1894-06-24T00:00:00Z,"As a specimen of the printers' art the souvenirs given at that memorable banquet in St. James's Hall to Rear Admiral Erben, Capt. Mahan, and officers of the cruiser Chicago cannot accurately be described as very artistic productions. But they are interesting as showing a genuine desire on the part of the entertainers to make the affair as agreeable for their guests as possible."
1894-06-24T00:00:00Z,"NEW-LONDON, June 23. -- During the last decade rowing at Harvard has been char- acterized by few victories and many defeats, while during the preceding period between 1876--when the eight-oared races between Harvard and Yale were established as annual events--and 1884 the record showed Harvard to have won five times and to have lost but three contests."
1894-06-24T00:00:00Z,"Although the card for the day's racing at the Sheepshead Bay track was not specially attractive, there was a very large crowd in attendance. Among these were a host of people who believed that they might escape from the intense heat of the city by a visit to the track. But the wind, what little there was of it, was not from the sea, and so the crowd had to sit or stand and swelter."
1894-06-24T00:00:00Z,"There were a number of persons overcome by the beat in Brooklyn yesterday, and one of the cases proved fatal. The list is as follows:"

1894-06-24T00:00:00Z,"There is probably no regatta which is looked forward to with more interest than that given by the Middle States Regatta Association, and the coming regatta, which will be held on the Passaic River course, promises to eclipse all former efforts of this association. The indications are that it will rival the National in number and quality of entries, and it is looked upon by many as almost the equal of that powerful organization."

1894-06-24T00:00:00Z,"The Staten Island Cricket Club expected an easy victory at Berkeley Oval yesterday against the Morris Heights team, but the home club was determined to make a good showing, and had it not been for three unfortunate run-outs they would have come very near to winning the match, which, however, resulted in a victory for the visitors by 36 runs."

1894-06-24T00:00:00Z,"The West Side Tennis Club's open tournament was continued yesterday afternoon on the Eighty-ninth Street courts.

That is the flag raising which will take place on the site where Fort Prince Charles was built by the British during the Revolution. King's Bridge is a spot of great historic interest."
1894-06-24T00:00:00Z,"CAPE MAY, N.J., June. 23 -- Every hotel, save one, is open here, and that would be open were it not for the fact that the Pennsylvania Railroad has chartered it for a party of Washington, Philadelphia, and Baltimore newspaper men who will arrive next Wednesday and remain until Saturday, when the hotel will open for guests."

1894-06-24T00:00:00Z,"ELBERON, N.J., June 23 -- It seems like drawing it pretty strong to say that it was uncomfortably cool here during the early part of the week, but such is the fact.

1894-06-24T00:00:00Z,"PHILADELPHIA, June 23 -- The tone of the market throughout the day has been heavy. A drive at St. Paul and another at Reading carried those stocks lower than yesterday's prices, but even at the bottom prices of to-day they did not look specially weak. While prices have been marked down the last few days, no special weakness has developed and no large line of stocks seems to be for sale."

1894-06-24T00:00:00Z,"ALEXANDRIA BAY, June 23 -- The Thousand Islands of the. St. Lawrence were never more beautiful than they are at the opening of the season this year.

1894-06-24T00:00:00Z,"The verdict in the case of Mrs. Halliday, who was found guilty of murder in the first degree at Monticello Thursday, illustrates anew the deficiencies of our criminal code in its application to the insane, or to cases where the plea is insanity. All the weighty testimony in the case tended to show that the accused woman is insane."

1894-06-24T00:00:00Z,"NEWPORT, R.I., June 23 -- It is said that when the steamer Plymouth is freed from Spindle Rock she will depart from Newport, and will not be seen again for several months.

1894-06-24T00:00:00Z,"This pretty little story is from the pen of a young Brooklyn miss, who read it last week at the closing exercises of her school. Its fanciful and wholesome charm will be appreciated by other boys and girls than those who heard it."
1894-06-24T00:00:00Z,"Of late years the medical missionary has become an established feature in the Evangelical Christian Missions in China.

1894-06-24T00:00:00Z,"ASBURY PARK, N.J., June 23 -- The century run of the Associated Cycling Clubs of New-Jersey stirred up the local wheelmen here to-day. The bulletin board of The New-York Times in front of the Western Union telegraph office was surrounded by enthusiastic wheelmen all day. The route of the run was displayed and the movements of riders were recorded every half hour."
1894-06-24T00:00:00Z,"Although bicycling is slipping upon us more rapidly than golf as a fashionable sport, the very slowness with which the old Scotch game takes root over here is perhaps indicative of a more permanent foundation than the sudden meteoric invasion by the steel wheel of the world of fashion."

As has been said before, there is no knowing where it is going to stop, but it does seem as if it would tempt investors at a much higher price."
1894-06-24T00:00:00Z,"NEW-LONDON, Conn., June 23 -- Notwithstanding the terrific heat to-day the crews on the river did as hard work this evening as at any time during their stay here. The temperature to-day was as high as it will probably go during the Summer, the thermometer showing 91 at the signal office. The noon practice was light because of the heat and to husband the strength of the crews for the severer trials this evening."

1894-06-24T00:00:00Z,"WASHINGTON, June 23 -- The report of the resignation of Prof. T.C. Mendenhall seems to be premature and shrouded in mystery. He partly denies the report.

As a person's thoughts matters of business are apt to be influent m a controlling degree by the condition or his own affairs, it is not surprising to find that pessimistic views prevail in many quarters."

He jumps from one side of the fence to the other, conveniently forgets facts that everybody is familiar with, conveniently remembers things that are not so, contradicts himself, denounces himself, (unintentionally,) and does it all without the slightest apparent sense of incongruity or inconsistency."
1894-06-24T00:00:00Z,"The musical value of a Saengerfest is not to be measured by the artistic merits of its concerts. This seeming paradox may be readily explained.
