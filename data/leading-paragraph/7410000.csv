2010-09-19T00:00:00Z,"HUDSON--William Hoffman, a resident of Dallas, Texas died in Dallas on Sunday, September 5th, 2010, age 80 of complications of prostate cancer. His passions were quail hunting and his love for the game of polo. Mr. Hudson was born in Oklahoma City on October 24, 1929 into a family with deep American roots. The family of his paternal grandmother founded Hartford Colony. His maternal grandmother's family, the Elder John Strong, arrived in America in 1630 on the ""Mary and John."" His grandfather was Major General Roy Hoffman, an aide to General Pershing in the First World War. General Hoffman received the Legion of Honor from Marshall Foch, the highest honor given to a soldier who is not in the French army. His father, Hubert R. Hudson, had owned the Oklahoma Ada & Atoka Railroad; a friend of Mr. Hudson's, Steven Bechtel saved the railroad from bankruptcy when his construction company rebuilt the two major railroad bridges that had been wiped out by the ravages from flooding. Subsequently, Mr. Hudson sold the railroad prior to the crash of 1929 to the Ingersoll brothers of Philadelphia. William Hudson attended Culver Military Academy in Indiana and Williams College, Massachusetts. His freshman year, he arrived at college with four feisty and agile polo ponies, which necessitated finding like-minded students who also wanted to have a polo team. Mr. Hudson's ponies were not his; he had played polo at the Broadmoor in Colorado Springs, Colorado, where his family had summered for two years. There he was taught to play polo by Lawrence Phipps, of Littleton, Colorado, who gave him four of his ponies to have for his years at Williams. Upon graduating from Williams (where he only started studying in his fourth year when he discovered ""with surprise, how much his professors had to teach him""), Mr. Hudson decided to enlist in the army because of the Korean War. He was sent to the camp at De Ridder, Louisiana along with thousands of soldiers in preparation for going to Korea. Because he ranked first in the camps evaluation test, he was sent to OCS (Officers Candidate School). After returning from Korea with the rank of Captain, he resumed his interest in polo, spending the next ten years playing polo in America and Europe; in Italy, with Harry Cushing who was captain of the American team and then onto Madrid, Spain where he became close friends with Perico Domecq, and in Deauville, France with Baron Elie de Rothschild, whose team featured the three famous Gracida brothers from Mexico. As each spring turned to summer, Mr. Hudson would move on to England, where the captain of the American team, George Sherman, and his friend Allan Corey, a ten goal player from Westbury, LI invited him to join their team. In England the matches were with Prince Philip, who was captain of the British team. On his return to the United States, in Dallas Mr. Hudson founded the Lone Oak Polo Club, which hosted the first high goal polo tournaments in Dallas where Mr. Hudson was a driving force in Dallas polo; he knew only one speed, and that was faster. Bill Hudson was a veteran of the oil and gas business for over 50 years. He began his career at Tri-State Natural Gas Company, eventually becoming president, where he developed a significant portion of the San Juan field in New Mexico. His wildcatting spirit led to the discovery of the Rocanville field in Saskatchewan. He was also chairman of the American Stock Exchange - listed GNC Energy Corporation and president of TJ Service Company, a contract drilling company with a fleet of 27 rigs. He was Director of the Colorado Rocky Mountain School, Director and President of the Dallas Opera, and member of the Brook Hollow Golf Club, the New York Racquet and Tennis Club, and Doubles. An enthusiastic and avid tennis player where he excelled. Despite his difficult last year, Mr. Hudson exhibited grace, dignity and his inimitable sense of humor while comforted by his family and friends. Mr. Hudson was predeceased by his parents Dorothy and Hubert R. Hudson and his brother Hubert R. Hudson, Jr. He is survived by his beloved wife Cathy, his children Andrew Hudson, Chris Hudson, Eugenia King and her husband Frank Paul, Courtney Nyhuis, his step children Callie Kincaid, Maggie Kincaid, and Sam Kincaid, Lindsay Ganz and her husband Jason. He is also survived by his former wife, Betty Hudson, his sister in NYC Caroline Hudson Firestone, and five grandchildren. A memorial service was held in Dallas, Texas, and a private memorial service will be held in New York City in October."

2010-09-19T00:00:00Z,"The New York spring fashion shows of more than 300 designers, which ended on Thursday, were about the possibilities of dressing. Fashion, per se, is definitely not art; it is an elegant hybrid of craft and commerce to beautify the human body. But on rare occasions, the work of designers can be classified as a minor art form, especially when put together artfully by a wearer. Top row, guests at the shows who created tasteful and refined looks through their use of color and proportion. Bottom row, wearable art: a man wore a different suit om each day of the shows. He'd had them tailored from painter's canvas and then had an artist paint them after posters from the Belle Époque. In between these two extremes were many suggestions of fashion to come: full skirts, hot pants and the futuristic prints of the late Alexander McQueen. For many of the guests, the shows are a time to dress up; two were resplendent in their Native American turquoise and silver jewelry. The move of a third of the shows to Lincoln Center from Bryant Park proved a huge success with its luxury of space. Nearly 200 designers showed in other locations throughout the city."

Trees in the Malus genus, including crab apple and wild apple, produce abundant fruit, and this time of year even a short stroll through the city is an exercise in falling fruit.

A native of Schenectady, New York, Al Way served two years in the army and graduated from Brown University with a B.A. in economics in 1951.

He began his career at General Electric Corporation, working in various financial positions in the U.S., Latin America, and Europe. In 1970, he became Vice President of Honeywell Information Systems. Three years later, he rejoined General Electric as Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, serving also on G.E.'s Corporate Policy Committee. He was pivotal in establishing GE Capital.

2010-09-19T00:00:00Z,"In an experiment published last month, researchers recruited schoolchildren, ages 9 and 10, who lived near the Champaign-Urbana campus of the University of Illinois and asked them to run on a treadmill. The researchers were hoping to learn more about how fitness affects the immature human brain. Animal studies had already established that, when given access to running wheels, baby rodents bulked up their brains, enlarging certain areas and subsequently outperforming sedentary pups on rodent intelligence tests. But studies of the effect of exercise on the actual shape and function of children's brains had not yet been tried. So the researchers sorted the children, based on their treadmill runs, into highest-, lowest- and median-fit categories. Only the most- and least-fit groups continued in the study (to provide the greatest contrast). Both groups completed a series of cognitive challenges involving watching directional arrows on a computer screen and pushing certain keys in order to test how well the children filter out unnecessary information and attend to relevant cues. Finally, the children's brains were scanned, using magnetic resonance imaging technology to measure the volume of specific areas."

Experts say that there are no technical or commercial reasons why BP -- or another company if BP is wary of the political or public-relations repercussions -- could not eventually produce oil from the formation, which BP once estimated contained about 50 million barrels of oil. The well spewed only about one-tenth of that amount, according to government estimates."

2010-09-20T00:00:00Z,"Left, Yucaipa, via Bloomberg; right, Alex Brandon/Associated Press Ronald W. Burkle, left, and Stephen Riggio, the vice chairman of Barnes & Noble, are locked in a proxy struggle over the direction of the company. Leonard S. Riggio, the pugnacious Barnes & Noble chairman, may be in the fight of his career, but he says he doesn't relish it. ''I find it almost repulsive I have to be put in a position to defend myself,'' Mr. Riggio said last week in Barnes & Noble's corporate offices, leaning forward to press his point. ''I don't want to consume myself with not liking people.'' Just over a week before Barnes & Noble shareholders convene for their annual meeting, Mr. Riggio remains locked in battle with the billionaire investor Ronald W. Burkle over three board seats, including Mr. Riggio's. And Barnes & Noble has begun seeking potential buyers for the entire 1,350-store chain. Mr. Riggio, 69, lights up when talking about walking into physical bookstores or building up his company's digital one. It is his vision for the company that is at the center of the increasingly fierce proxy fight, one that began last month and in which both sides have recently dredged through the other's corporate history for purported instances of self-dealing and incompetence. This week Barnes & Noble is hoping to win the backing of Institutional Shareholder Services, an influential company whose advice on proxy fights is closely followed by corporate investors. Barnes & Noble has already won the qualified support of a smaller adviser, Glass Lewis & Company. The fight over Barnes & Noble may seem disproportionate to what is at stake. The company's market value has shrunk to less than $1 billion, and bookselling has been squeezed by Amazon.com on one end and Wal-Mart Stores on the other. But as Mr. Riggio says, the battle touches on deep reservoirs of sentiment about an empire he fashioned starting with a small bookstore 39 years ago. ''Lots of people have an emotional stake in books,'' he said. ''It's not like what they have with their haberdashers.'' For his part, Mr. Burkle has praised Mr. Riggio's accomplishments in building up Barnes & Noble and professes a desire for peace with his longtime acquaintance. But he also described Mr. Riggio as intolerant of questions about his strategy and management. ''With Len, you're either a white hat or a black hat,'' Mr. Burkle said in an interview by phone from his plane. Mr. Burkle said he was not seeking control of the company through the proxy fight, but wanted to have independent directors on the board. ''I want someone in there who doesn't say, 'That's the most amazing thing I ever heard' every time Len opens his mouth,'' he said. Mr. Riggio's biggest challenge remains grappling with the Internet, and he argues that digital bookselling is the biggest opportunity since the paperback revolution. Barnes & Noble's e-reader, the Nook, has been making headway in sales, he said. (The company says it controls about 20 percent of the e-book market, based on information from publishers.) He also pointed to growth at the company, which reported net income of $36.7 million on a 31 percent gain in revenue, to $5.8 billion, for the year ended May 1. For its most recent quarter, Barnes & Noble reported a 21 percent jump in overall revenue, to $1.4 billion, though it posted a $63 million net loss as a result of the legal fight with Mr. Burkle and weakening sales of print books. Many analysts and industry executives do not share Mr. Riggio's optimism. Shares in the company have tumbled 28.9 percent in the last year. An analyst at Bank of AmericaMerrill Lynch downgraded Barnes & Noble to ''underperform'' last week, arguing that the company's digital strategy faced major challenges from wealthier rivals like Amazon and Apple. Mr. Burkle, who amassed his fortune in supermarket chains, alarmed Barnes & Noble when his investment company, Yucaipa, began buying up shares last year, acquiring a nearly 20 percent stake. He described Mr. Riggio's strategy as too little, too late. Adding to Mr. Riggio's anxiety were the near-simultaneous share purchases made by Aletheia Research and Management, an investment firm based in California that has often followed in Mr. Burkle's footsteps. To the company's management, Yucaipa and Aletheia's moves represented a potential stealth takeover of Barnes & Noble without a premium for shareholders. Mr. Burkle has denied working in concert with Aletheia. Glass Lewis and Mr. Riggio have questioned Mr. Burkle's lack of an alternative vision for Barnes & Noble. When pressed, Mr. Burkle says he has ideas for the company, but adds that because he is not seeking outright control of Barnes & Noble he sees no need to share them publicly. In the last two weeks, the clashes have become more personal, with Barnes & Noble and Yucaipa trading blows over past business decisions. Barnes & Noble published a 26-page compendium last week of what it described as examples of Mr. Burkle's having gained control of companies without paying a premium or making disastrous business decisions. One involved a series of transactions by Source Interlink, a media and distribution company created from Yucaipa-instigated deals, and in which Mr. Riggio was an investor; the company filed for bankruptcy in 2008. Another involved the merger of Pathmark and the Great Atlantic and Pacific Tea Company, a union that Barnes & Noble said resulted in gains for Yucaipa far beyond those realized by other shareholders. Mr. Burkle called the 26-page document misleading or inaccurate and pointed to several deals made by Barnes & Noble for companies in which the Riggio family had ownership interests. Chief among those, Mr. Burkle said, was the $514 million deal last year for a college bookstore business owned by Mr. Riggio and his wife. (Excluding cash held by the college unit, the deal amounted to $439 million, or about 3.8 times its profits.) The acquisition led to a spate of investor lawsuits, which are still pending. Glass Lewis has questioned Barnes & Noble's past pay practices, arguing that the company drastically overpaid its executives in light of its stock performance. Barnes & Noble's new chief executive, William Lynch, is paid $900,000 in salary, while his predecessor, Stephen Riggio, who was also vice chairman, was paid $800,000. Stephen, Mr. Riggio's younger brother, remains vice chairman and now earns $400,000. Mr. Riggio - who reduced his salary this year to $100,000 from $300,000 - made no apologies for what he said were necessary costs for hiring good executives. ''I'm significantly undercompensated,'' he said. ''Steve is undercompensated.'' Mr. Burkle has raised questions about whether Barnes & Noble's plan to sell itself will be fair and open to any bidder besides Mr. Riggio, who has indicated that he may make an offer. About 20 parties, including private equity firms, have either signed nondisclosure agreements with Barnes & Noble or are close to doing so, people with direct knowledge of the process said, adding that preliminary offers could be due as soon as next month. Yucaipa has not signed an agreement, Mr. Burkle said, arguing that such documents typically contain onerous restrictions for potential bidders. Dismissing concerns that the sale process was being handled improperly, Mr. Riggio said, ''If there's any stink to the process, it'd be all over the Street.'' This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print."

2010-09-20T00:00:00Z,"After months of heated speculation, two prominent Wall Street bankers have raised money for a new private equity fund focused on media deals. They are the latest in a long line of financiers who have left large banks to start boutiques that provide strategic advice and make principal investments. According to a letter recently sent to its investors, the firm, called the Raine Group, had raised more than $300 million and hopes to close at $500 million. It is being run by Joseph Ravitch, a former partner at Goldman Sachs, and Jeffrey A. Sine, a former senior banker at UBS. Mr. Ravitch and Mr. Sine have made names for themselves in the media and entertainment business, advising companies on some of the sector's highest-profile deals. Mr. Ravitch, 48, has worked on transactions including the creation of NBA China and the sale of the Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer movie studio. Mr. Sine, 54, advised the Sundance Channel on its sale to Rainbow Media, part of Cablevision, and advised Time Warner on its merger with AOL. The two financiers formed Raine about a year ago and have since spanned the globe to secure backing. Among Raine's closest ties are to William Morris Endeavor, the influential Hollywood talent agency, which owns a stake in the Raine parent company and has an investment in the private equity vehicle, according to people familiar with the firm. Mr. Ravitch advises the agency and is close friends with Ariel Z. Emanuel, William Morris's chief executive. Raine's investors, according to the letter, are a mix of large sovereign wealth funds, including those run by the Abu Dhabi and Singapore governments. Investors who are also on Raine's advisory board include moguls like Ted Forstmann, owner of the sports marketing giant IMG Worldwide; Raymond G. Chambers, the private equity pioneer and an owner of the New Jersey Devils hockey team; and Masayoshi Son, founder of SoftBank, the large Japanese media company. Other advisers are Thomas E. Freston, the former chief executive of Viacom, and Marc Andreessen, a founder of Netscape and a board member of Facebook, eBay and Hewlett-Packard. William Morris will not have a day-to-day role in Raine's operations, say people familiar with the firm who requested anonymity because the plans were confidential. But Raine's Los Angeles office will be at the William Morris Endeavor's Beverly Hills headquarters, in a separate space. (The Raine name is an amalgamation of the founders' surnames; people close to the firm have suggested that the E stands for Emanuel.) Raine has already worked on a number of advisory assignments, including counseling Flash Entertainment, owned by Abu Dhabi, on its purchase of a stake in the Ultimate Fighting Championship league. This month, Playboy Enterprises announced that it had retained Raine to review a bid by its founder, Hugh Hefner, to take the company private. Like many other private equity shops, Raine has focused on the fast-growing Asia region. The firm counts among its advisory board members Li Ruigang, president of the Shanghai Media Group and chairman of the media-focused investment fund sponsored by the Chinese government. Raine has also advised IMG Worldwide on a venture with the Indian conglomerate Reliance Industries to build a professional sports business in India. The idea behind firms like Raine, which is modeled, in part, on the boutique investment bank Allen & Company, is that their deal-making contacts will give them exclusive access to prospective investments, which could include global comic book brands and new sports leagues. Byron Trott, another former Goldman Sachs partner, recently set up a similar business in Chicago focused on family-owned and industrial companies. The Raine fund's media industry focus is similar to the early formation of the Quadrangle Group a decade ago when Steven Rattner, a leading media banker at Lazard Frères, left the firm with three colleagues to form a private equity operation. Other boutique firms founded by well-known bankers to provide advice and make investments include Greenhill & Company and Evercore Partners. Both of those firms, now publicly traded, have either been spun off or are winding down their in-house private equity arms to avoid potential conflicts and decrease earnings volatility. This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print."

In a ceremony timed to the 25th anniversary of Zappa's Senate testimony, at which he compared the labeling of explicit records to censorship, and attended by Zappa's widow, Gail, his sons, Dweezil and Ahmet, and daughter Diva, as well as Baltimore's mayor, Stephanie Rawlings-Blake, a bust of the mustachioed, pony-tailed Zappa was unveiled atop a 12-foot pole outside the Southeast Anchor Branch of the Enoch Pratt Free Library. It isn't very large, but the bust is a replica of a similar sculpture in Vilnius, Lithuania. The duplicate was donated to Baltimore by the Lithuanian nonprofit organization ZAPPART. ''He'd be wildly amused by this,'' Gail Zappa told The A.P., ''because of the absurdity of these guys in Lithuania coming up with this phenomenal sculptor who normally does busts of Stalin.'' This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print."

Mr. Dolman was promoted to the post of chairman of the company worldwide. Mr. Murphy, 56, most recently was president and chief executive of Rodale Inc., a publishing company perhaps best known for producing hits like ''The South Beach Diet'' and ''An Inconvenient Truth.'' Mr. Dolman, 50, who will be based in New York, plans to concentrate on attracting business while Mr. Murphy will move to London and be responsible for the house's day-to-day operations."
2010-09-21T00:00:00Z,"SUNDELL--Michael G.,of New York, NY, on September 7, 2010, age 74. The Members and Directors of Yaddo are deeply saddened by the death of their former President, Michael G. Sundell, and hereby express their profound sympathy to Nina and their children, and their gratitude to Michael for his inspired leadership of Yaddo over eight years. He has earned his place in a veritable Pantheon of Yaddo Saints, joining Spencer, Katrina, Elizabeth, and others who nurtured and supported the creative process and stimulated - in the words of the Trasks - ""the Sacred Fire"" within Yaddo's artist guests. The more than 1,500 artists who had the privilege of being guests during Michael's tenure, as well as the roughly equivalent number who have been guests since his retirement, are all the beneficiaries of his extraordinary legacy of leadership. He had a deep understanding of Yaddo's mission and the importance of assuring an atmosphere of security, peace, freedom and protection for the artist guests, he skillfully took Yaddo in some new directions, he loved Yaddo, derived joy from the experience of running Yaddo, and conveyed such joy and enthusiasm to others, leaving Yaddo better for his presence and stronger than he found it. The Members and Directors note with pride that in his retirement Michael pursued his passion in archeology, art history, and the history of religion researching mosaics in Rome and publishing Mosaics in the Eternal City. When ultimately confronted with a life threatening illness, he never lost his interest in serious scholarship, his zest for life, his love of family and friends, his passion for travel, and his love of the creative process and the work that goes on at Yaddo."

And an accompanying picture caption referred imprecisely to an injectable antibiotic, Excenel RTU. Excenel is used in the treatment of swine disease, but it is not used to prevent disease or promote faster growth in pigs and thus would not fall under the F.D.A.'s proposed guidelines."

The film stars Colin Firth as King George VI of Britain, who overcame a nervous stammer to deliver a crucial address on the eve of that country's entrance into World War II, and will be released in the United States by the Weinstein Company later this year. Previous winners of the award, which comes with a prize of about $30,000, have included ''Slumdog Millionaire,'' ''Crash'' and ''American Beauty,'' all winners of the Oscar for best picture; last year's winner, ''Precious: Based on the Novel 'Push' By Sapphire,'' was a best picture nominee. The People's Choice award for a documentary went to ''Force of Nature: The David Suzuki Movie,'' a feature by Sturla Gunnarsson about that Canadian environmentalist. Among the films that were acquired for distribution at the end of Toronto festival, Variety reported (subscription required) were Werner Herzog's ''Cave of Forgotten Dreams,'' a 3-D film about the paintings in the Chauvet Cave of southern France."

The victim was treated at a hospital; statements were taken but no arrest was made. Now, 17 years later, a suspect is in custody. The suspect, Alberto Barriera, 46, was arraigned on Monday in State Supreme Court in Manhattan on charges that he robbed and raped the teen-ager on Dec. 18, 1993.''The assailant took money and jewelry from her and sexually assaulted her,'' Martha Bashford, an assistant district attorney, said at the arraignment. DNA was collected from the victim at the hospital, Ms. Bashford said, and was preserved. In 2002 it was examined as part of the New York Police Department's Backlog Testing Program.

Then there was the second silence: the silence in Ms. Burson's family about the first silence. Ms. Burson, now a 34-year-old songwriter who lives in Cobble Hill, Brooklyn, started asking about her family's history in Europe when she was 8, and learned about the Holocaust at religious school.

The addition of ''Catch Me'' to Broadway's 2010-11 schedule is also the clearest sign yet that another new musical, Andrew Lloyd Webber's ''Love Never Dies,'' will not come to New York next spring as planned. The ''Catch Me'' director is Jack O'Brien and the choreographer is Jerry Mitchell; they mounted the London debut production of ''Love Never Dies'' last spring and were expected to bring it to Broadway, but people close to both men said recently that the two had left the Lloyd Webber production, his sequel to ''The Phantom of the Opera.''"

2010-09-22T00:00:00Z,"BECKER--John T.,international entrepreneur, dies at 90. John Thomas Becker, 90, of Greenwich, died on September 17 2010 after a short illness. He was born in May 1920 in Pontiac, Michigan. A graduate of Michigan State University he enlisted in WWII and attended Navy Officer training school at Notre Dame University. During the war, he distinguished himself as a commander of subchaser crafts from the Caribbean to the North Pacific. In 1951, John established Eurpac Service Inc. a global sales, marketing and distribution services company. From a Paris-based two-person operation the company expanded to four continents and staff numbering in the thousands. Among markets served, Eurpac became a leader in consumer product distribution to military commissaries and exchanges worldwide. Becker and his wife, Sheila moved to Greenwich in 1958, and John quickly became an active and involved citizen. A man of opinion, dedication and action, he owned and operated the local AM station, WGCH. Additionally, he served as Chairman of the Board of Greenwich YMCA, was on the board of the Greenwich Historical Society, and was Chairman of a United Way annual giving campaign. He actively and generously contributed to the growth and well-being of many Greenwich institutions including Parsonage Cottage, Greenwich Hospital and The Bruce Museum. Active in and dedicated to the political process, he was committed to the Republican party throughout his life. He participated in the Greenwich RTM and acted two terms as Chairman. He served several terms on the Republican State Central Committee. In 1982 he ran for Connecticut State Treasurer on the Republican party ticket and later ran for the US Congressional seat vacated by Senator McKinney. Among his many activities outside the local community, he was a founding member of the Armed Forces Marketing Council and served on the Board of the USO in Washington D.C. His interests were varied from building a stable of race horses to catching fish in the waters off of his residence in the Bahamas. Above all, Becker will be remembered as a valuable contributor and a focused leader, dedicated to his family, friends and community. His knowledge on almost any topic combined with his accurate, matter-of-fact analysis of the world made him an inspiration to all who encountered him[MMB1]. He was predeceased by his wife Sheila in 2001 and is survived by his four daughters, Jamee Becker of Greenwich, Lisa Edmundson of Greenwich, Virginia ""Gigi"" Becker of Lyme and Margaret McDonough Becker of Redwood City; a son Frank ""Jed"" Becker of Darien; eleven grandchildren and three great-grandchildren; and a sister Margaret Miller of Virginia Beach.

According to a filing made Monday in a Manhattan court reported by The Associated Press, Ms. Lohan, the 24-year-old ''Mean Girls'' star, withdrew her lawsuit against E-Trade over a Super Bowl commercial for that online brokerage that she believed was taking aim at her. In the advertisement, a baby with an adult's voice asks another infant whether he's been visited by ''that milkaholic Lindsay.'' A lawyer for Ms. Lohan wrote in an earlier filing that the babies ''were actually portraying'' Ms. Lohan ''and her grown-up friends,'' but a lawyer for E-Trade responded, ''No reasonable person would connect'' the actress with the commercial. Ms. Lohan may instead be marshaling her resources for her legal woes in California, where a Beverly Hills judge on Monday revoked her probation and issued a warrant for her arrest after she failed a drug test, The A.P. reported. Over the summer, Ms. Lohan served less than two weeks of a 90-day jail sentence and spent 22 days in a rehabilitation facility after missing a probation hearing in May stemming from her 2007 arrests on charges of drunken driving and drug possession. The warrant has been stayed until a Friday hearing to determine if Ms. Lohan's latest actions violated her probation."

2010-09-22T00:00:00Z,"Michelle Obama will begin appearing on behalf of Democratic candidates starting in mid-October, bringing a softer appeal to voters for a continuation of the policies of her husband's party. Democratic candidates across the country have been agitating for the popular First Lady, who was a valuable asset for President Obama on the campaign trail in 2008. Aides to Mrs. Obama said she has been eager to start stumping. ''From the beginning, she's wanted to hit the campaign trail,'' said Susan Sher, the First Lady's chief of staff. ''It was just a matter of figuring out what would work with her schedule and what would be most useful.'' Advisers said Mrs. Obama has no plans to bring sharp-edged rhetoric to the campaign trail. They said the First Lady will not attack Republicans directly or accuse them of driving the country into a ditch. ''She's campaigning to advocate, to rally voters behind specific candidates based on what we can do together to build a better future,'' said Stephanie Cutter, assistant to the president for special projects. ''She comes to this as a mom, and that's the lens through which she sees the world and that's her test for every issue-what it means for her daughters and all of our kids.'' White House officials have built a schedule for the First Lady that focuses on a handful of candidates for the U.S. Senate and events for the Democratic National Committee's women's leadership forum. She will start in Wisconsin and Illinois, travel to Colorado, Washington state and California. Among the candidates to receive her help: Senator Michael Bennet of Colorado; Senator Russell D. Feingold of Wisconsin; Alexi Giannoulias who is running for the Senate in Illinois, and Senators Barbara Boxer of California and Patty Murray of Washington. Most of the events will be fundraisers - including one for the House speaker, Nancy Pelosi -- though aides said there will likely be some other public events added to the schedule in the coming days. So far, there are no major campaign-style rallies on Mrs. Obama's schedule. An aide explained that Mrs. Obama has chosen not to travel for the campaign on weekends, which makes it more difficult to schedule big public events. But aides said there are likely to be other events added to the First Lady's schedule, especially in the final days of the campaign, when the White House hopes to use her appeal to make a final pitch on behalf of candidates. Robert Gibbs, the White House press secretary, told reporters Tuesday that Mrs. Obama is an ''enormous asset'' for the administration and predicted that she will be an effective advocate for the candidates she campaigns with. ''She is, as you might guess, a popular ask on the campaign trail and I think she will go out and make a forceful and positive case for what this administration has done,'' Mr. Gibbs said. This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print."

The New York area octet put together an EP, ""Ten Past,"" on their own, and self-published it on iTunes two weeks ago. Within 24 hours it had climbed to No. 9 on the music seller's influential hip-hop charts. The band's style is something of a 2010 update on the 1990s rap-rock formula, which sounds cringe worthy, but these teenagers (ages 14-19) put a spin on it that works. They rap over rock riffs reminiscent of MGMT and Phoenix, and set their rhymes into soft relief with an amazing shoegazer-y female vocalist.

""If I would give the truthful answer,"" he says, ""I would have to say that I really do not think in such categories between furniture and sculptures."" His latest installation, ""Roman Room,"" at Gagosian Gallery in Rome, makes a practical distinction if not a conceptual one. A cluster of sculptures made largely from papier-mâché, foam, gauze and cardboard, perched on low pedestals, intermingle with a pair of linen sheathed sofas and a chair that West created specially for the occasion. ""I had the idea while watching my 3-year-old son looking up at the sculptures,"" the artist says of the arrangement. ""The seatings make for alternative positions and viewing platforms throughout the show."" The sculptures, which, depending on how you look at them and also maybe how old you are, might bring to mind enormous, melting ice cream treats, are as lumpy and charming as the seating is lean and angular. Both exude comfort in their own way. ""When I was younger, I thought it was all right to make the visitor uncomfortable,"" West says.

In 2008 the Sheldon Abend Revocable Trust, which owns the rights to the 1942 Cornell Woolrich short story ''It Had to Be Murder,'' from which ''Rear Window'' was adapted, filed suit against DreamWorks and Paramount Pictures, which distributed ''Disturbia,'' as well as Steven Spielberg, a Dreamworks founder. The suit said ''Disturbia,'' which also chronicles a young man (played by Shia LaBeouf) who thinks he sees a murder while he is spying on a neighbor, had used the short story's plot without obtaining the trust's permission."

I don't normally find printers totally mesmerizing-and I hope you don't either-but two were definitely worthy of a little rubbernecking. For starters, I've never seen a printer like the $249 H.P. Envy 100 e-All-in-One. It looks nothing like a printer: There's no unsightly paper trays or feeders, no awkward pop-up LCDs or even the slightest glimpse of a drive roller. Instead, the Envy 100 looks like a handsomely designed stereo component; all its printer-like mechanisms are tucked inside until you need them. That's a remarkable feat, considering that the printer is only 4 inches tall."

Mr. Fleck and Ms. Boden discussed Mr. Hughes's impact in an interview for Arts & Leisure.

The Tide has been dominant so far, and the return of Mark Ingram last week gives them even more firepower. This is the kind of game that makes coming out of the Southeastern Conference unscathed such a feat, as is South Carolina's matchup with Auburn. Notre Dame has hit some bumps already in Brian Kelly's first season as coach and it doesn't get any easier this weekend, with No. 16 Stanford coming to South Bend. Andrew Luck has been spectacular for the Cardinal so far, and a big game against the Irish could give him a lot of confidence heading into the rest of the Pac-10 schedule. West Virginia and Louisiana State are both undefeated, but have still managed to seem somewhat suspect. Will the Mountaineers be able to overcome the hostile environment they are sure to be greeted with in Baton Rouge? But perhaps the weekend's most intriguing game is Oregon State traveling to Boise State, where it will face the Broncos on the Smurf Turf. Boise State needs a convincing win to answer some of the critics now downplaying its victory over Virginia Tech. Of course, the Beavers have knocked off top teams before (just ask U.S.C.).

Lodz is also financing cultural festivals and programs aimed at retaining local art school grads, and once a planned high-speed rail slashes the Warsaw commute to 35 minutes, they'll have one more reason to stay put."

True, cars are a luxury in many city neighborhoods - even, some would argue, an unnecessary assault on the environment. Still, city car owners have their reasons, and they suffer enough already: The jolting realization that it's 11 p.m., you're already in your pajamas, and you need to move the car to comply with alternate-side parking regulations. The tickets that come when that realization comes just a minute too late. Those shaming window stickers. The road-hogging garbage trucks. No right turn on red."

2010-09-25T00:00:00Z,"8 P.M. (HBO) UP IN THE AIR (2009) A sleekly attired, flatteringly lighted George Clooney plays Ryan Bingham, a corporate assassin -- he fires people for a living -- and frequent flier who reaches a crossroads when a young upstart (Anna Kendrick) tries to change the rules of the game. Vera Farmiga, above with Mr. Clooney, is Alex, the fast-moving executive who, for the first time, causes Bingham to rethink his life. Reviewing this film, adapted by Jason Reitman (''Juno'') from the novel by Walter Kirn, in The New York Times, Manohla Dargis wrote, '' 'Up in the Air' is an assertively, and unapologetically, tidy package, from its use of romance to instill some drama into the narrative (the book introduces disease instead) and the mope-rock tunes that Mr. Reitman needlessly overuses.'' Still, she added, one of the film's pleasures is that its actresses ''share the frame with Mr. Clooney as equals, not props.'' In the end, ''however bright Mr. Clooney's smile, there is something terribly off about Bingham's blithe attitude both toward his own existential reality and his profession,'' Ms. Dargis said. ''Instructively, it is how Mr. Reitman circles around the character, showing how Bingham's actions affect not just him, but also those around him -- including the people he fires -- that deepens the movie if not its peripatetic center.'' 8 P.M.

Known to many as ""Nettie"" she was a woman of many talents. A professional artist who excelled in most media including oils, acrylics, pastels, water colors, and mixed media, Jeanette achieved state and national recognition for her artistic talents. She was passionate about art and loved to paint anything she saw. She was a past Co-Chairwoman of the annual juried Sidewalk Show of South Orange and Maplewood and a member of several art associations including the prestigious New Jersey Water Color Society and the American Water Color Society. Jeanette was honored with numerous awards by fine arts organizations in New Jersey and New York and earned a Merit Award from the highly regarded Salmagundi Art Club in New York and the Dagmar H. Tribble Memorial Award from the Garden State Watercolor Society. Her paintings were exhibited in numerous galleries and in many outdoor exhibits including the Washington Square Outdoor Art Exhibit in Greenwich Village, New York and the South Orange Outdoor Art exhibit beginning in the 1960s and continuing throughout the 1970s, 1980s and 1990s. She continued to submit paintings in juried shows until 2008 with great success. It is remarkable that her professional art career did not begin until she was in her 50s and had already raised five children. Jeanette is survived by her children, daughters: Sandy and her husband Joe Gigliotti, Bonni Masi Oswald, Susan Masi, Carol Masi and son, Tom Masi and his wife Luby; 10 grandchildren: Greg and his wife Kristine, John and his wife Day and Joe Gigliotti; Peter and his wife Elena Mele; John and his wife Robin, Tucker and his wife Shauna, Kurt and his wife Lindsay and Kirsten Oswald, John and Jenna Masi and eleven great-grandchildren: Annie and Gracie Gigliotti, Griffin and Sydney Gigliotti, Carson, Harrison and Reilly Oswald, Rowan and Reagan Oswald and Nicolas and Alexandra Mele. In addition to her art work, Jeanette's memory will endure as a lively and unique individual who always kept an open door. There were always good spirits, food and an ample supply of manhattans to greet all visitors. Jeanette was a resident of South Orange for more than 60 years. Her home ""155"" in South Orange was a central gathering point for family, friends and art groups for decades. Holiday parties and special occasions would last throughout the night. Some would go to bed only to find others in the morning still gathered around the table talking and cooking breakfast. Jeanette's spirit, creativity, wit, inspiration and ability to reinvent herself no matter what the challenge, will be with us for generations to come. Visitation will be at Galloway and Crane Funeral Home on South Finley Avenue in Basking Ridge, NJ on Sunday, September 26 from 3 to 7pm. Funeral Mass will be held at Jeanette's home parish of Our Lady of Sorrows in South Orange, NJ on Monday, September 27 at 10:15am. Interment will be at Holy Cross Cemetery on Mt.

In exchange, the museum in Hubei will lend more than 100 objects to the National Taiwan Museum for an exhibition in November. Taiwan has been hesitant to send important artworks to China, fearing they would be confiscated. But this painting does not belong to a group of artifacts that is the subject of particular contention between the countries: thousands of Chinese imperial treasures that were shipped to Taiwan in 1949 by the Chinese Nationalists, who were being routed by the Communists. Those objects now form the collection of the National Palace Museum in Taipei. The National Palace Museum maintains that it will not lend objects to China until the Chinese government formally agrees that it will not seize them."

In creating the Imagination Playground in Lower Manhattan -- a playground with lots of loose parts for children to create their own play spaces -- we realized that many of the elements with the greatest value to children were inexpensive and portable. Although traditional playgrounds can easily cost in the millions to build, boxed imagination playgrounds can be put together for under $10,000. (Land costs not included!) The design below is one that my architecture firm has done in collaboration with the New York City Parks Department and KaBoom, a nonprofit organization. But it needn't be the only one out there. There are a lot of ways to build a playground -- and a lot of communities in need of one. Let a thousand portable playgrounds bloom. -- DAVID ROCKWELL, president of the Rockwell Group"

Henry was born in New York City on January 24, 1921. He attended Riverdale Country School, graduated from Pomfret School, and received a B.S. in chemistry from MIT. On his graduation day in 1942 he also received his commission in the US Army Chemical Corp. and served his country for four years. After his army service he studied at the California Institute of Technology and achieved his Ph.D. in Synthetic Organic Chemistry in 1950. He worked for Wyandotte Chemicals for two years and then took a postdoctoral Fellowship at the University of Wisconsin for further research. He met and married his loving wife, Connie while at Wisconsin and then accepted a position at Lever Brothers Research Lab in New Jersey. While with Lever Brothers he received several patents, and made many lasting friends. In 1966, he took a position as Professor of Chemistry at the University of New Haven and moved to Westport, CT. After retiring in 1978, he and his wife greatly enjoyed traveling in Europe, around the world, and to the Artic and Antarctic. In 1993, they moved to Wake Robin Community in Shelburne, VT, where Henry greatly enjoyed indulging his passion for bridge. Henry is survived by his wife of 57 years, Connie, and two sons: Tom and his wife Elyse of Arlington, MA; and Brian and his wife Debbie of Jersey City, NJ, and three grandchildren Beverly, Eddie and John and one niece Wendy Warne of Arizona. There will be a Memorial Circle of Remembrance held on Sunday, September 26 at Wake Robin. In lieu of flowers contributions to The Southern Poverty Law Center or Planned Parenthood of New England would be appreciated. Ave et vale, dear Henry."

2010-09-26T00:00:00Z,"When a brand ''goes global,'' that usually means the forces behind it will be racking up frequent-flier miles. Carolina Herrera Báez, the daughter of the designer Carolina Herrera, is doing exactly that as the creative adviser for CH Carolina Herrera, a casual lifestyle brand that is rolling out 18 boutiques this year. The first New York City boutique, which sells everything from silk dresses to cashmere travel blankets, opened earlier this month. This 14-karat gold headband is one of the spoils of last spring's excursion, when both Carolinas made their way to Beirut, Lebanon, to celebrate the opening of a new CH shop. Amid all the festivities, Carolina Jr. made time to check out the local shops: ''That's how I get to know a place more than sightseeing.'' She picked up this souvenir, an elegant band embellished with a pair of doves, at a boutique called Orient 499 (499 Omar Daouk Street; 011-961-1-369-499) in the city's Ain-el-Mreisseh neighborhood. ''I've been having kids for the past five years,'' she says, ''so my hair would fall out, grow back in, fall out. Sometimes I just need to put it back.'' Her motivation was only partly practical, though. The Madrid-based mother of three admits to something of a headband habit, owning about 15 for both day and evening. MEENAL MISTRY"

2010-09-26T00:00:00Z,"In 1927, Mies van der Rohe designed the innovative concrete-and-steel Weissenhof apartments in Stuttgart, Germany, which would become a landmark of International-style architecture; that same year, Gerrit Rietveld built the so-called chauffeur's house (below), a little-known but remarkably similar building in his hometown of Utrecht, the Netherlands, which leaked and had to be redone shortly thereafter. Trained as a cabinetmaker, Rietveld -- an early member of the de Stijl movement known for his Red-Blue Chair and Schröder House -- suffered many such disappointments in a career of more than 45 years. But a new retrospective at Utrecht's Centraal Museum illustrates how his groundbreaking ideas had a much broader impact than is generally acknowledged. ''In Holland you have this feeling that maybe he was a genius but he wasn't a good architect,'' says Ida van Zijl, the curator of ''Rietveld's Universe,'' which opens Oct. 20 as part of the Netherlands' Rietveld Year. ''People don't realize how many works he made and how experimental they were.'' The exhibition puts his furniture and architecture on an international scale, comparing it with Marcel Breuer, Le Corbusier and van der Rohe as well as showing its influence on contemporary designers. In a room dedicated to the Red-Blue Chair, the real thing will sit alongside a video of Maarten Baas's charred homage. MONICA KHEMSUROV"

Known to many as ""Nettie"" she was a woman of many talents. A professional artist who excelled in most media including oils, acrylics, pastels, water colors, and mixed media, Jeanette achieved state and national recognition for her artistic talents. She was passionate about art and loved to paint anything she saw. She was a past Co-Chairwoman of the annual juried Sidewalk Show of South Orange and Maplewood and a member of several art associations including the prestigious New Jersey Water Color Society and the American Water Color Society. Jeanette was honored with numerous awards by fine arts organizations in New Jersey and New York and earned a Merit Award from the highly regarded Salmagundi Art Club in New York and the Dagmar H. Tribble Memorial Award from the Garden State Watercolor Society. Her paintings were exhibited in numerous galleries and in many outdoor exhibits including the Washington Square Outdoor Art Exhibit in Greenwich Village, New York and the South Orange Outdoor Art exhibit beginning in the 1960s and continuing throughout the 1970s, 1980s and 1990s. She continued to submit paintings in juried shows until 2008 with great success. It is remarkable that her professional art career did not begin until she was in her 50s and had already raised five children. Jeanette is survived by her children, daughters: Sandy and her husband Joe Gigliotti, Bonni Masi Oswald, Susan Masi, Carol Masi and son, Tom Masi and his wife Luby; 10 grandchildren: Greg and his wife Kristine, John and his wife Day and Joe Gigliotti; Peter and his wife Elena Mele; John and his wife Robin, Tucker and his wife Shauna, Kurt and his wife Lindsay and Kirsten Oswald, John and Jenna Masi and eleven great-grandchildren: Annie and Gracie Gigliotti, Griffin and Sydney Gigliotti, Carson, Harrison and Reilly Oswald, Rowan and Reagan Oswald and Nicolas and Alexandra Mele. In addition to her art work, Jeanette's memory will endure as a lively and unique individual who always kept an open door. There were always good spirits, food and an ample supply of manhattans to greet all visitors. Jeanette was a resident of South Orange for more than 60 years. Her home ""155"" in South Orange was a central gathering point for family, friends and art groups for decades. Holiday parties and special occasions would last throughout the night. Some would go to bed only to find others in the morning still gathered around the table talking and cooking breakfast. Jeanette's spirit, creativity, wit, inspiration and ability to reinvent herself no matter what the challenge, will be with us for generations to come. Visitation will be at Galloway and Crane Funeral Home on South Finley Avenue in Basking Ridge, NJ on Sunday, September 26 from 3 to 7pm. Funeral Mass will be held at Jeanette's home parish of Our Lady of Sorrows in South Orange, NJ on Monday, September 27 at 10:15am. Interment will be at Holy Cross Cemetery on Mt. Airy Road in Bernardsville, NJ at noon. Memorial donations in Jeanette's honor may be made to the Villa Walsh Jeanette Fragasso Masi Memorial Art Award, c/o Villa Walsh Academy, 455 Western Avenue, Morristown, NJ 07960."

2010-09-26T00:00:00Z,"TIMOTHY EGAN Travel is good for many things, not the least of which is testing your national values against those of other countries. But perhaps the best way to judge the health of a nation's heart is by how it treats the shunned. Plagued by low poll numbers, France's President Nicolas Sarkozy this summer set out to dismantle Gypsy camps and deport the people to Romania and Bulgaria. It has proven to be a popular move at home, but prompted a stinging rebuke from the European Union's justice commissioner, Viviane Reding: she compared the expulsions to ethnic cleansing by the Nazis. As often happens when the morally indignant let their passions get the best of them, the justice commissioner's comparison was over the top. Sarkozy's deportation is simply a crass political move, and a huge hurdle for poor people who have to gather all their belongings and start anew in another country."

2010-09-26T00:00:00Z,"Most museum fashion shows are relegated to a dark basement, reflecting not just the status of fashion vis-a-vis fine art but also the vulnerability of, say, a 150-year-old silk gown, to the effects of sunlight. When the Los Angeles County Museum of Art shows off its newly acquired, and reportedly groundbreaking, trove of European clothing on Saturday, it will do so in a new light-filled pavilion designed by Renzo Piano. ''Fashioning Fashion: European Dress in Detail, 1700-1915,'' which runs through April 3, ends well before the invention of ready-to-wear. In this stunning context, even a man's vest from the 18th century (it is embroidered with symbolism relevant to the French Revolution and it predates the message T-shirt by at least 200 years) somehow seems modern and alive. This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print"

Born and bred in New York by immigrant parents from the Ukraine, and widow of Louis Dorfsman (see editorial obit of October 26, 2008). Valedictorian of her class at Washington Irving High School; Graduate of Cooper Union for the Advancement of Science and Art ('39) (The art studio at the new building at Cooper Union is named for Ann Hysa Dorfsman and Louis Dorfsman). Ann was a multi-talented artist, as adept at illustration as photography, calligraphy, fashion design and interior design. She was the founder and curator of the Historic Wall Coverings Collection at the Cooper Hewitt Museum of Design, NY, for 20 years until her retirement. As it was her true passion, she was a master weaver of wall hangings, pillow covers, clothing, rugs and the innovator of many weaving styles and techniques. An avid cook and gardener, she experimented with recipes until she perfected them: breads of all sorts, quiche (before it became part of the American lexicon), the ultimate spaghetti sauce and on and on. She was outstanding at everything she set her mind to - the ""Martha Stewart"" of her day. In lieu of flowers or gift baskets, Ann would prefer a donation of any size to the Alzheimer's Association: Alz.org; then enter your zip code for local chapter; or 1-800-272-3900.

2010-09-26T00:00:00Z,"Two months after flooding began in the northern reaches of Pakistan, the waters of the Indus River continue to flood low-lying areas of Sindh, the country's southernmost province. The flooding killed about 1,800 people, and more than 20 million people, or around 14 percent of the country's population, have been affected. The United Nations estimates that 12.4 million people are in need of immediate humanitarian assistance, meaning they have no access to clean water and are living in temporary shelters. Millions do not know when they will be able to return home. A majority of the displaced are farmers, and the flooding has destroyed not only their homes but their fields, herds and livelihoods. The complexity of the situation, combined with the instability in the country, makes it the worst natural disaster the United Nations has ever responded to in its 65-year history, according to a recent report by the organization."

2010-09-26T00:00:00Z,"The upsurge of student activism and the radicalization of large segments of the undergraduate population since 1964 has led to speculation about the future politics of this college cohort. Opinion surveys make clear that the most recent students and graduates are much more left of center and critical than those of the '40s and '50s. Will they retain their present commitments in substantial measure, and thus constitute a major force for social change, as they climb the occupational hierarchies? If American experience is any guide, it is likely that the cohort which experienced the radical and activist campus politics of the late '60s will not continue in the distinctive frame of mind it now shows. Colleges are encapsulated communities in which peer group pressures are especially intense and pervasive. After graduation, however, most -- even today when the absolute number rejecting a ''careerist'' outlook is far greater than ever before -- re-enter the highly differentiated larger society."

2010-09-26T00:00:00Z,"Two new photography books cast an eye on the American cultural landscape. Over the last 15 years, the legendary photographer Lee Friedlander has shot in almost all 50 states, employing the windows and mirrors of his rental cars to frame parts of the country that are often sped past -- the churches, motels, bars and bridges. Those black-and-white pictures, collected in ''America by Car'' (D.A.P./Fraenkel; $50), are timeless in their shabby grandeur. And to coincide with this month's survey exhibition at the Walker Art Center in Minneapolis, ''From Here to There: Alec Soth's America'' (left; Walker Art Center; $60) is an anthology of past and new work that takes us through the country's sad and dreamy subcultures, including ''Broken Manual,'' portraits of men who live off the grid. ''I've had the opportunity to photograph all over the world,'' Soth says, ''but I keep coming back to America. I find it endlessly rich.'' CHRISTINE MUHLKE"

Ms. Bellafante is right on one count: It is a ''lame and sappy'' plot twist. It is also disappointing to those of us who savor the misanthropy of Gregory House, which was on glorious display during the show's first five seasons. Unfortunately, the show's sixth season gave off faint whiffs of a producing and writing staff that had run out of ideas, and was capped off by the seemingly outof- nowhere ''cliffhanger'' of Lisa Cuddy professing her love for House. How desperate of them. For the most part, ''House'' has always seemed to be about something: medicine, smart people, mysterious ailments. Give me that show any day over this loveconquers- all silliness that is unworthy of these characters and this series. JOANNE NESTI Haddam, Conn."

The Texans have won six straight games since last December, and their comeback victory against the Redskins, close on the heels of an upset of the Colts, proved that there's more to them than receiver Andre Johnson, defensive end Mario Williams and youthful exuberance. The Texans' offense is vintage 1990s Broncos -- cutback runs and rollout passes -- and their run defense has held opponents to 62 rushing yards and 2.3 yards per carry this year. Their pass defense still has some growing up to do, but a win over the faded belle-of-the-ball Cowboys would demonstrate how they have come of age."

Because most, if not all, shareholders cast their votes before the meetings even take place, they can feel ritualistic and not terribly meaningful. Yet, these congregations do give shareholders a rare opportunity to take the measure of the managers and directors who are supposed to work for them.

Sundell, and hereby express their profound sympathy to Nina and their children, and their gratitude to Michael for his inspired leadership of Yaddo over eight years. He has earned his place in a veritable Pantheon of Yaddo Saints, joining Spencer, Katrina, Elizabeth, and others who nurtured and supported the creative process and stimulated - in the words of the Trasks - ""the Sacred Fire"" within Yaddo's artist guests. The more than 1,500 artists who had the privilege of being guests during Michael's tenure, as well as the roughly equivalent number who have been guests since his retirement, are all the beneficiaries of his extraordinary legacy of leadership. He had a deep understanding of Yaddo's mission and the importance of assuring an atmosphere of security, peace, freedom and protection for the artist guests, he skillfully took Yaddo in some new directions, he loved Yaddo, derived joy from the experience of running Yaddo, and conveyed such joy and enthusiasm to others, leaving Yaddo better for his presence and stronger than he found it. The Members and Directors note with pride that in his retirement Michael pursued his passion in archeology, art history, and the history of religion researching mosaics in Rome and publishing Mosaics in the Eternal City. When ultimately confronted with a life threatening illness, he never lost his interest in serious scholarship, his zest for life, his love of family and friends, his passion for travel, and his love of the creative process and the work that goes on at Yaddo."

The rest of Europe doesn't work as well for us -- our horn players quit in Germany.'' The results are 11 songs that range from explosive anthems (''Angela Surf City'') to lonely dirges (''Stranded''). ''Lisbon'' also marks the Walkmen's debut on Fat Possum Records, based in Oxford, Miss., another drowsy town ripe for aesthetic reclamation any minute now. ETHAN HAUSER"

Oh, and just down the block is a bistro that is never mentioned in guidebooks but is beloved by locals. Welcome to the new, hyper-connected, technology-based travel paradigm. It's the era of the smartphone as ubiquitous tool of navigation, when what matters is not just the here but the now. With smart phones increasingly ubiquitous, a new era of hyper-connected travel is at hand--literally--as so-called location-awareness continues to explode as a cultural/tech meme. Google Maps and Google Street View blanket more and more of the planet. Facebook and Twitter allow users to ''geotag'' their updates with specific geographic coordinates, while Foursquare turns ''checking in'' into a form of entertainment. Users of the photo-sharing site Flickr geotag more than four million photos per month. And augmented reality (AR) technology, which allows travelers to navigate their way to nearby attractions by aiming a smartphone in any direction, weaves together all those geodata points into a miniaturized virtual world coated with zesty little information bubbles."

2010-09-26T00:00:00Z,"London's bohemian vanguard has found a new home base in the twin neighborhoods of Kensal Rise and Kensal Green. North of Notting Hill in the former badlands above the Harrow Road, The traditionally Portuguese district of Victorian row houses north of Notting Hill is home to buzzy gastropubs and incognito celebrities -- Sophie Dahl and Jade Jagger live here -- and the rents are still cheap enough that pioneering shop owners are hanging out shingles on Chamberlayne Road. Victoria Brotherson, the florist behind Scarlet and Violet 1 (76 Chamberlayne Road; 011-44-208-969-9446; scarletandviolet.co.uk), worked in Notting Hill Gate for 16 years before coming to Kensal Rise; now she sells vintage cut-crystal vases and chipped enamel pitchers alongside English blooms like cornflower and nigella. ''I thought I was just going to have a little workshop,'' she says. ''I was taken by surprise that we were that busy.'' In her wake, two vintage furniture stores, Howie & Belle 2 (52 Chamberlayne Road; 011-44-208-964-4553; howieandbelle.com) and Circus Antiques (60 Chamberlayne Road; 011-44-208-968-8244; circusantiques.co.uk), have opened among the bookies' offices down the street. And a 10-minute walk away in Kensal Green, Retrouvius 3 (2A Ravensworth Road; 011-44-208-960-6060; retrouvius.com) is the brainchild of the designers Adam Hills and Maria Speake, a space stocked with repurposed architectural salvage. There's quirky drinking and dining, too: besides the Chamberlayne Pub and Steakhouse (83 Chamberlayne Road; 011-44-208-960-4311; thechamberlayne.co.uk) and the wine bar Miro's (75 Chamberlayne Road; 011-44-203-235-0003; miros.co.uk), the gastropub Paradise by Way of Kensal Green (19 Kilburn Lane; 011-44-208-969-0098; theparadise.co.uk)serves seasonal and organic dishes and a beloved sticky toffee pudding.

2010-09-27T15:00:49Z,"When designers make gallery pieces, you get sculptural chairs and charred chandeliers. But when artists create furniture, even the pretense of functionality disappears, leading to weird works like homoerotic bunk beds and chandeliers, like the one by Lee Bul (below), that don't light up. These are the kinds of conceptually charged objects cataloged in ''The New Décor,'' the book based on a recent exhibition at the Hayward Gallery in London and traveling to the Garage in Moscow this month. Their purpose is not to elevate the trappings of domestic life but to question our very faith in them. ''Contemporary artists are associating the home with a sense of movement, insecurity and precariousness,'' says the Hayward's director, Ralph Rugoff. ''Rather than being a castle, home is a vulnerable place now.'' While the more absurd pieces - like a giant hot-pink papier-mâché phallus bench by Franz West - explore our private space as a kind of public theater, others are more obviously unsettling. The Swiss artist Fabrice Gygi's tented writing desk is somewhere between a child's fort and a bomb shelter, and Jin Shi's Chinese migrant worker's dwelling is a chilling reminder of how the other half lives."

2010-09-27T11:57:05Z,"¶ The much-maligned Rangers defenseman Wade Redden, waived Saturday after two disappointing years with the Blueshirts, clears waivers on Monday without being claimed by another N.H.L. club. He and the $6.5 million cap hit he represents are now clear to go to the Rangers' American League affiliate in Hartford. The long-anticipated move puts the Rangers beneath the salary cap and even leaves them with a couple of million dollars to make a new signing. But some believe that sending Redden to the minors (or to Europe, where he could sign with a club as former Blackhawks goalie Cristobal Huet did last month) could prove problematic under the collective bargaining agreement. Redden, a former N.H.L. all-star with Ottawa who once shared the league's plus-minus award and played for Team Canada at the World Cup, I.I.H.F. World Championship and Winter Olympics, scored 5 goals and 40 points while going plus-3 in 156 games with the Rangers. Those stats are pretty good, but far short of the performance expected from a player who still has four years and $23 million left on his current Rangers deal. Redden does have a third option if he clears waivers: refuse to report to Hartford, which would void his contract and leave him free to seek a deal with another N.H.L. team, which will undoubtedly pay him much less."

A short obituary is hardly sufficient, but something must be said, beyond acknowledging the love, respect and affection of her husband, children, grandchildren, friends, and the many lives she touched in her professional career. From boarding and public schools, and a challenging family background, she found her stride at NYU as a national and international fencing champion. Her success in this sport gave her the self confidence that would become the mainspring for the pioneering which was the hallmark of many of her endeavors. At 15 years of age, Diane met Ira who, after years of courtship, became her husband and lifelong partner. Following a brief stay in New York and Washington, DC in the early years of their marriage, she found great joy in their moving to Westchester County where they raised a son James, and daughter Elizabeth. Soon thereafter, Diane headed to Columbia University for a Masters in City Planning, graduating and ultimately becoming the City Planner for Greenwich, Conn. Learning the intricacies of local government in city planning, she struck out on her own to become a land developer and build residential town homes with the support of family and friends. Diane was likely the first woman to vigorously contest zoning boards, other government agencies and the like, don a hard hat and actually direct all activities on a building site. Success quickly followed with her signature de-attached town homes (then a new concept for the era and locus) in Larchmont, Mamaroneck and New Rochelle. She later branched out and joined a real estate partnership which managed shopping centers across the country. Her business gains provided her the opportunity to be a generous, and most often anonymous, philanthropist to large and small causes, many of which championed women's and children's issues. An athlete throughout her life, she was an avid tennis player for Quaker Ridge Golf Club and then took up golf later in life with the same ardor and dedication she gave to her professional endeavors, eventually becoming the president of the Westchester Inter club Golf League. Her children are successfully following their own stars, and her five grandchildren will remember her with admiration and affection, seeing a role model of courage and hard work as a means to conquer any obstacle that life may present. All of us mourn her passing, but take genuine comfort that she has overcome an undeserved ordeal. Ira, Jim, Liz, Kate, Joanna, Max, Natalie, and Jack. Funeral Services will be held Tuesday 10am at Larchmont Temple 75 Larchmont Ave. Larchmont, NY 10538 (914)834.6120. Interment will be at Sharon Garden Cemetery in Valhalla, NY.

But there was one member of Congress who was conspicuous for her absence. Representative Nydia Velázquez, Democrat from New York, heads the House Small Business Committee, so normally one would expect to find her at a small-business bill signing, where she might take a bow and collect a souvenir pen.

For the Sabres it's the first of several keynote events in this, their 40th anniversary season. On Nov. 6 they will go to Toronto to play the Leafs, their neighbors and historic rivals, in the Hall of Fame game, and from Dec. 26 to Jan. 5 their downtown rink will play host to the world junior tournament. Back to the Hamilton area, where there are a fair number of Sabres season-ticket holders. Still, it's slightly odd that the Sabres' annus mirabilis should start near Hamilton, as their presence just 50 miles down the Queen E. Way is one of two reasons Hamilton cannot get an N.H.L. team (the other reason, of course, is the presence of the Leafs less than 50 miles the other way)."

Screening for early detection of cancer sounds like a no-brainer, but it's not an easy choice for men considering regular P.S.A. tests, which measure blood levels of prostate-specific antigen and are used to detect prostate cancer. Though use of the test is widespread, studies show that the screening saves few, if any, lives."

2010-09-28T00:00:00Z,"The much-maligned Rangers defenseman Wade Redden, waived Saturday after two disappointing years with the Blueshirts, clears waivers on Monday without being claimed by another N.H.L. club. He and the $6.5 million cap hit he represents are now clear to go to the Rangers' American League affiliate in Hartford. The long-anticipated move puts the Rangers beneath the salary cap and even leaves them with a couple of million dollars to make a new signing. But some believe that sending Redden to the minors (or to Europe, where he could sign with a club as former Blackhawks goalie Cristobal Huet did last month) could prove problematic under the collective bargaining agreement. Redden, a former N.H.L. all-star with Ottawa who once shared the league's plus-minus award and played for Team Canada at the World Cup, I.I.H.F. World Championship and Winter Olympics, scored 5 goals and 40 points while going plus-3 in 156 games with the Rangers. Those stats are pretty good, but far short of the performance expected from a player who still has four years and $23 million left on his current Rangers deal. Redden does have a third option if he clears waivers: refuse to report to Hartford, which would void his contract and leave him free to seek a deal with another N.H.L. team, which will undoubtedly pay him much less. Also sent down to Hartford by the Rangers: Mats Zuccarello Aasen, the Norwegian Hobbit Wizard."

(ESPN) INTO THE WIND In 1980, three years after receiving a diagnosis of osteosarcoma, a form of bone cancer, and having his right leg amputated six inches above the knee, Terry Fox decided to run across Canada. What began as one man's journey to raise money and awareness for cancer research has grown into the world's largest one-day fund-raiser for the cause. Though Mr. Fox, who was born in 1958, ran the equivalent of a marathon each day, he never finished his quest: starting in Newfoundland, he made it to Ontario before the cancer spread to his lungs. He died in 1981. In this latest entry in ESPN's ''30 for 30'' documentary series, the first-time filmmaker Steve Nash, a Canadian and a point guard for the Phoenix Suns, and the director Ezra Holland recount the story of Mr. Fox, one of Mr. Nash's childhood idols. ''I remember being a 6-year-old boy and waking up every morning and rushing to the TV to see where Terry was that day,'' Mr. Nash said. ''To see him running or hobbling across our country for the spirit of community and looking out for others was something that has stuck with me ever since. To see his face hiding the pain and to hear his words disguising the sacrifice was as motivating and as educational an experience as I've ever had.'' 8 P.M.

True to form, he was quick to embrace the iPhone's Brushes app, among others. Even as he was working on large-scale landscapes of his native Yorkshire, England - for a big 2012 exhibition at the Royal Academy of Arts in London - Hockney was drawing energetic, vividly colored images of flowers, places and people at screen scale, which he e-mails to friends. These, along with his drawings on the iPad, are the subject of ''David Hockney: Fleurs Fraîches,'' which runs from Oct. 20 to Jan. 30, 2011, at the Pierre Bergé-Yves Saint Laurent Foundation in Paris. Curated by Charlie Scheips and designed by the New York architect Ali Tayar of Parallel Design, the exhibition will present the artwork in its original digital format, including animations of one or more works. (Brushes records the process of a painting in video.) The iPhones and iPads themselves will be set into fiberboard panels like the ones that line Hockney's studio, and Tayar is even designing special furniture for the installation - which Scheips says ''won't look like an Apple store. It will be more homey.'' The act of iPainting seems no less immediate for its lack of actual pigments; Scheips says Hockney becomes so immersed that he stops to wipe off his fingers."

So far, Manish Arora, who showed his over-the-top collection to cheers last week, is India's biggest international fashion success story.

For over four decades, he has refused to settle in one camp, allowing the breadth of his vision and the variety of his work to take in the worlds of fashion, portraiture and reportage. Likewise his sittings have ranged from supermodels to prisoners, from athletes to aristocrats. Add to the list advertising campaigns for clients like Prada, Estée Lauder, Revlon and Gap and it's not hard to see why he is considered such an elastic virtuoso. The graphic intensity and epic intention of Watson's images are now on display in ""UFO: Unified Fashion Objectives"" (Abrams; $135), a retrospective book of what he considers his best work. (Images from ""UFO"" are also on show at Hasted Hunt Kraeutler, 537 W. 24th Street, from October 21.)

The only thing I'd add to their analysis is this: I wonder how the data would have looked if Pew had created a generic ""nonbeliever"" category and compared that group to Protestants and Catholics. Instead, they created two categories: Self-described atheists/agnostics, and people who described their religion as ""nothing in particular."" The first group was 3 percent of the sample; the second group was a much larger 12 percent. And while the atheist/agnostics had the highest religious literacy, the larger ""nothing in particular"" camp was among the least literate overall."

On Monday, DC Comics, the longtime home of heroes like Batman, Superman and Wonder Woman, said that it had named as its new editor in chief Robert Harras, a veteran editor there who had also spent five years as the editor in chief of rival Marvel Comics, the publisher of Spider-Man, the Hulk and Iron Man. DC, a unit of Warner Brothers Entertainment and Time Warner, said in a statement that Mr. Harras will oversee editorial for its comics as well as MAD Magazine and its Vertigo imprint, and will work from the company's New York offices. (Last week DC announced it would move its operations that focus on feature films, television, video games and other media to California from New York.)"

In an interview on Tuesday, Mr. Kramer, below, whose plays include ''The Normal Heart'' and the Pulitzer Prize-finalist ''The Destiny of Me,'' said the book was a national history of homosexuality and AIDS, stretching back to precolonial times and dealing with the sexuality of many famous Americans, including George Washington and Abraham Lincoln. Mr. Kramer, the co-founder of the Gay Men's Health Crisis and the protest group Act Up, said he began writing the book in 1980 out of frustration with Ronald Reagan's references to ''the American people,'' a phrase that he believed was not intended to include gay citizens like him. The publishing house is calling the book ''a major work of American fiction,'' which Mr. Kramer said he had no problem with. ''I don't want to be forced to have to defend everything,'' he said."

So, when I went up to my place on Cape Cod, alone, for an extended end-of-summer visit, I realized that I would be cooking for myself for an entire week, with the exception of a couple of dinner invitations. I hadn't done that in at least 10 years, and possibly ever, and I wanted to see if it would change the meals I ate. FRIDAY I did not shop on the way up, figuring I could get that done on Saturday morning. Besides, there's nothing I like more than dinner from the pantry. There were cooked white beans in the freezer, cherry tomatoes that I'd snacked on during the drive, onions and garlic in the fridge, and, of course, pasta in my little cupboard. I cooked a chopped onion in olive oil with the tomatoes, adding most of the garlic. I wished I'd had an herb. When the tomatoes softened, the cooked beans went in, along with the remaining garlic. I finished the pasta with more olive oil, and found it quite satisfying. For some reason -- probably because I had not shopped first, and probably also because my lunch had been so meager -- I had only a little left over. I had an apple for dessert."

2010-09-29T00:00:00Z,"8 P.M. (HBO2) WAR DON DON (2010) In the Krio language of Sierra Leone, ''War Don Don'' is the name of the civil war that raged from 1991 to 2001, during which the Revolutionary United Front fought to overthrow the ruling government. In 2003 the United Nations and the government of Sierra Leone spent more than $200 million to set up a Special Court -- the world's first international war crimes ''hybrid tribunal'' -- in an effort to seek justice and reconciliation. This documentary from Rebecca Richman Cohen, a Harvard Law School graduate who interned for a defense team at the court, follows the war crimes trial of Issa Hassan Sesay, above left, the highest-ranking survivor of the rebel group. It also explores both the limits of international justice and the contradictions in a man who dealt in blood diamonds, commanded child soldiers and oversaw mass atrocities against civilians -- but who is also credited by some with single-handedly ending the war. In 2009 Mr. Sesay was convicted of 16 of 18 charges and sentenced to 52 years in prison. The movie ''is less an investigation of guilt for war crimes than a contemplation of the viability of international courts,'' Stephen Holden wrote in The New York Times. ''The film suggests that the hundreds of millions of American and British funds spent to build the court might better have been used to revive Sierra Leone's shattered economy.'' 8 P.M.

Obviously defining ""his generation"" is a somewhat tricky thing - but suppose we do it roughly by decade, and compare his body of work to other filmmakers who came into their own between 1990 and 2005. (This ends up excluding the Coen brothers and Steven Soderbergh, who would otherwise provide some of his stiffest competition, as well as some recent bloomers like Jason Reitman.) Using that time frame, Fincher is up against Quentin Tarantino, Paul Thomas Anderson, Peter Jackson, Christopher Nolan, Wes Anderson, Sofia Coppola, Alexander Payne, Spike Jonze, Danny Boyle, Ang Lee, and no doubt some others I'm forgetting. Many of the directors on that list have made individual movies that might be better than a given Fincher film.

Last fall, Rizzoli reprinted a lavish monograph devoted to the staggeringly prolific Italian designer, critic and bon vivant who, before his death at 87 in 1979, founded Domus magazine, created sets for La Scala, brought a touch of playful luxury to the interiors of the Andrea Doria and planted works in every medium in just about every corner of the world. Meanwhile, auction prices for vintage Ponti pieces have been on a winning streak, not unlike the thoroughbred racehorse named after him. Now ''The Expression of Gio Ponti,'' curated by Germano Celant, gives the designer his biggest local showcase since the days of the old Alitalia ticket offices he created at 666 Fifth Avenue. The whopping retrospective, which opens in early 2011 and is the first exhibition at the brand-new Triennale di Milano design museum in Midtown, includes 250 items, from drawings to majolica to furniture, including the iconic Superleggera chair, which Ponti called, with characteristic flair, ''the chair for all times.'' Classical yet modern, rigorous yet whimsical, Ponti's work conforms to no dogma except his own exhortation to ''make something beautiful!''"

Baldwin was never afraid of color and is said to have pioneered the use of aubergine walls, in a Maryland house (above) in the 1940s. The book, which has an affectionate foreword by Albert Hadley, Baldwin's former student, is a welcome addition to the two (out-of-print and increasingly expensive) volumes on the decorator's work, ''Billy Baldwin Decorates'' and ''Billy Baldwin Remembers.''"

He was a graduate of the University of Michigan and Harvard Law School. In 1942, after a year at the law school, he enlisted in the navy, as the communications officer on a destroyer in the north Atlantic and the Mediterranean. When the war ended in Europe he was transferred to the Pacific. He had in his possession the maps that were to be used in the invasion of Japan. The destroyer got as far as Pearl Harbor when the war ended. He returned to Harvard, graduating in 1947. In that year he married Paulina Konoff whom he had met in Cambridge. After a year as a lawyer for the Department of Agriculture dealing with maritime law he joined the family businesses, Conmar Products Corp., manufacturers of zippers, and Margon Corporation, manufacturers of moving eyes for dolls, both in Newark, NJ. From the 1970's to the 1990's he was the president of Measurex, a supplier of specialty measures for the food, drug, and chemical industries. The Marks family lived in New York until 1957 when they moved to Short Hills, NJ, and in 2000 moved to South Orange. In addition to his business interests, Mr. Marks was a founding member of the ACLU of New Jersey, now celebrating it's 50th year. He was treasurer for at least two decades. In the mid 1970's he joined the board of Newark Beth Israel Medical Center, becoming chair two years later. He served as chair for 16 years, in two terms. From the very beginning he felt his service on the Beth board was the most exciting and fulfilling association ever. He was the most honorable, fairest, and kindest of men. Mr. Marks is survived by his wife of almost 63 years, Paulina, his three children Lucy, Edward, and Paul, his son-in-law Scott Sprinzen, his grandsons Alexander and Leo Sprinzen and Jacob and Ethan Marks, and his sister Margery Howard. He was predeceased by his brother John. He was a loving uncle to the Bromberg, Hamerman, Marks and Howard families.

Ms. Diaz-Santillan was employed by Ms. Whitman for nine years, until 2009, and said she was terminated after she approached Ms. Whitman, confessed to not having papers, and asked about trying to become a legal resident."

2010-10-01T18:17:18Z,"This Saturday was circled on the schedule by many college football fans at the beginning of the season, with Alabama against Florida and Oklahoma versus Texas looming as two of the year's marquee games. But a funny thing happened in September. A few things, actually. Florida, while undefeated, has looked a little sluggish in the first few weeks of the post-Tim Tebow era; Texas appeared lethargic in losing to a seemingly unimposing U.C.L.A. team in Austin last week; and Stanford has developed into a top-10 team behind an explosive offense led by quarterback Andrew Luck. All that means that Stanford at Oregon has become perhaps the most intriguing game of the weekend, with the Cardinal traveling to the always raucous atmosphere of Autzen Stadium to try to prove that they belong in the top tier of the Pac-10. As for Florida, every team in college football wishes they could struggle as well as the Gators.

These teams have been the class of the Southeastern Conference for several years and there is always a chance for an epic game when they play each other."

Originally designed to increase engine cooling and provide extra rear down-force for the 911 Turbo, the unique feature quickly became an over-used cosmetic addition to nearly every spec of 911. Perhaps Porsche is trying to resurrect this cetacean theme, via the distinctly ""humpbacked"" shape of the new 911 Speedster shown at the Paris Auto Show."

2010-10-01T14:45:04Z,"""Densité,"" an exhibition of paintings by Driss Ouadahi, opens today at Hosfelt Gallery New York. Ouadahi grew up in Algeria and studied architecture before enrolling at the Kunstakademie Düsseldorf, in the German city that is now his home. His subject matter is the built environment of urban alienation: underground passageways, chain-link fencing, the sterile Modernist high-rise buildings that are home to so many immigrants in European cities. Ouadahi's almost pretty color palette makes his screen-like, gridded high-rise facades seem seductive, until you realize that beyond them is a barren, depopulated landscape. His precisely rendered, claustrophobic tiled passages would make Kafka break out in a sweat, and his delicate depictions of chain link cover the canvas to its edges, suggesting a net that leaves no way out. The exhibition continues through Nov. 13. 531 West 36th Street; (212) 563-5454."

""Oh, my God,"" gasped a passerby as the man, the dancer and choreographer Stephen Petronio, achieved liftoff. He let his body fall forward until it was perpendicular to the pavement, and then held perfectly still, looking down at the street and perhaps into his soul as well. After a few moments of awed silence, he began an absurdly casual stroll down the sheer 97-foot granite cliff of the Whitney's side wall, rappelling in slow-motion and pausing, now and then, to let his seemingly weightless feet regain the wall before proceeding to the bottom, where he was greeted with an ovation."

''I wouldn't do anything without Massimo,'' Meier insisted. ''We both resolve ideas with a grid.'' For Vignelli - who, with his wife and partner in Vignelli Associates, Lella, is also known for designs like New York City's 1972 subway map and stacked plastic dinnerware for Heller, and who co-designed the just-opened Vignelli Center for Design Studies at the Rochester Institute of Technology - the calendar is an exercise in white space (or black; random pages of the calendars are reverse-printed). ''For us, the space outside the type is more important than the type itself,'' he said. Vignelli also designed a smaller version of the calendar, which he wishes were still in production. ''Some people don't have room for the large one,'' he explained. But no matter: even if Vignelli doesn't receive royalties for it, he's happy that the big calendar is still in print.

2010-10-01T00:00:00Z,"SAINT-AMAND--Cynthia Chisholm died peacefully at her home in New York City on September 29 after a long illness. Cynthia was born in Laurel, Mississippi to Alexander Field Chisholm and Elisabeth Wisner Chisholm. The Chisholm household was filled with the melodies of piano and singing voices sounds that characterized her childhood and remained with her for a lifetime. She and her sisters considered it one of their greatest blessings to grow up alongside the legendary soprano Leontyne Price and her brother General George Price. After graduating from the National Cathedral School in Washington, D.C., Cynthia earned a bachelor's degree in Art History and Theater Design from Smith College. During the next decade, Cynthia lived in Paris, Madrid, and Florence, where she became fluent in the languages of those countries. In keeping with her love for the arts and the theater, she later spent years working for Richard Rodgers in New York. She also worked for John D. Rockefeller, III. In 1972 Cynthia married Dr. Nathan Emile Saint-Amand. After they wed, Cynthia served on several boards and was extremely active in education. She served as President and Chairman of the Board of Trustees of The Episcopal School. Cynthia was also on the boards of The Buckley School and The Garrison Forest School, and was Parents' Chairwoman at St. Paul's School in Concord, New Hampshire. Cynthia is survived by her devoted and loving husband of thirty-eight years, Nathan, her son Nathan Alexander and his wife Sarah, and her daughter Elisabeth Alice. She will be missed forever. Everyone who knew her remarked on her grace, generosity, and keen intelligence. This last trait was evidenced by her skills as a storyteller a classic Southern gift. But her family would say that her greatest achievement was being a loving, generous, kind-spirited, and gentle wife and mother. A memorial service will be held at St. James Episcopal Church at 4pm on Tuesday, October 5th. In lieu of flowers, memorial contributions may be made to the Alzheimer's Drug Discovery Foundation or the Alzheimer's Disease and Memory Research Center at the Mount Sinai School of Medicine."
2010-10-01T00:00:00Z,"As he departs the White House for Chicago, Rahm Emanuel is an even bigger character than he was when he arrived. Mr. Emanuel, called simply ''Rahm'' around town, was already known as the short, profane, exercise-obsessed former lawmaker with a tendency to explode and then apologize and then explode again. But during his nearly 20 months as President Obama's chief of staff, he also became the implementer of a new Democratic agenda and the protective mother hen for those who slaved for him in the White House. And of course he left a trail of ''Rahm moments,'' memorable encounters with coworkers, lawmakers, lobbyists or adversaries. Here are some of our favorites: During a tour of the Chapel of the Ascension in Jerusalem, Senator Lindsey Graham, Republican of South Carolina, received a phone call from an agitated chief of staff. Mr. Emanuel wanted Mr. Graham to help him stop plans by Department of Justice officials to hold trials for top terror suspects in New York City. ''I'm at one of the most holy sites in the world and there's lots of swearing,'' Mr. Graham, who considers Mr. Emanuel ''loyal and effective,'' recalled. ''I'm talking so loud that the tour guide stops and everybody is listening to me exchange one profanity after another with Rahm.'' ''I thought, This is the most bizarre phone call ever,'' Graham said.It was a particularly contentious moment during one of the morning staff meetings, and Carol Browner, the president's top environmental adviser, was the target of Mr. Emanuel's ire. ''Rahm can be fairly intense,'' Ms. Browner said later ''He thought that he had said something that was not fair. So his offer of reconciliation was that he would kiss me.'' It was one of those classic moments, said Ms. Browner, who has known Mr. Emanuel since both worked in the administration of former president Bill Clinton. ''I accepted the offer of the kiss, not the kiss itself,'' she said. Close to three feet of snow dumped on Washington in January of 2010. Those who lived near Mr. Emanuel's D.C. neighborhood in the days after might have been surprised to see the chief of staff to the president of the United States - and his kids - on sleds, holding onto the back bumpers of a black Secret Service SUV. In the Chicago suburbs, this is apparently big, and they call it ''skeeching.''Melody Barnes, the president's domestic policy adviser, had scheduled her wedding for a few months after the inauguration in 2009. When Mr. Emanuel was told, he ordered her to take a week off before her wedding. ''I don't want to see pictures of a bride with bags under her eyes,'' she recalled him saying. She took three days off and was back at the office the Tuesday after her wedding.Two days after Mr. Obama's election, Mr. Emanuel called a reporter friend, as he frequently did. When he was told that the reporter was sitting next to a senior Republican aide, Mr. Emanuel insisted the phone be handed over, surprising the staffer. Remarked another reporter who witnessed the moment: ''Just Rahm being Rahm.''In the midst of the debate over the president's stimulus package, Mr. Emanuel went for the all-time record for phone calls to the Senate Majority Leader, Harry Reid, Democrat of Nevada. The calls started at 7 a.m., recalled a top aide, and didn't stop until after 11:30 that night, violating Mr. Reid's rule of no calls after 10 p.m. All told: 15 phone calls in one day.Shortly after Mr. Obama took office, he was meeting with House Speaker Nancy Pelosi and other lawmakers. Mr. Emanuel started cracking a knuckle on his hand, prompting a comment from his boss. As reported by the Times' Mark Leibovich, Mr. Emanuel ''held the offending knuckle up to Mr. Obama's left ear and, like an annoying little brother, snapped off a few special cracks.''Among Mr. Emanuel's biggest achievements in the White House may have been the day the president signed the health care legislation. That day in March, after Mr. Obama put his signature on the bill during a ceremony in the East Room, Mr. Emanuel walked back to his West Wing office with another senior adviser. Everyone was satisfied - except Mr. Emanuel. ''He was literally already saying, 'we've got to get focused on financial reform. Nobody's focused,''' the adviser said. ''It was just like Rahm.''

2010-10-01T00:00:00Z,"When you've built a career working with Tim Burton, as Danny Elfman has, it's inevitable that you end up with entire crypts full of buried material. But now an (un)healthy portion of the catalog created by Mr. Elfman, the musician and composer who has written the scores for nearly all of Mr. Burton's films, including ''Beetlejuice,''''Batman'' and ''Edward Scissorhands'' - and provided the singing voice for Jack Skellington of ''The Nightmare Before Christmas'' - is about to be unearthed. On Thursday, Warner Brothers Records said it would release a boxed set commemorating the 25 years that these two artists have worked together, dating back to 1985, when Mr. Burton recruited Mr. Elfman from the band Oingo Boingo to create the score for ''Pee-wee's Big Adventure.'' The ''Danny Elfman & Tim Burton 25th Anniversary Music Box,'' which is planned for a December release, will contain 18 hours of music on 16 CDs, including seven hours of previously unreleased material, a hardcover book with a foreword by Johnny Depp and a DVD conversation between Mr. Elfman and Mr. Burton. Mr. Elfman spoke recently with ArtsBeat about the process of exhuming one's own catacombs and the origins of his partnership with Mr. Burton. These are excerpts from that conversation.Q.How long does it take to put something like this together and how long ago did you get started?A.It was some months ago. My agent and my assistant spent a month sifting through a million hours of demos, work tapes, cassette tapes. I unfortunately have been almost bizarrely committed to not archiving anything. I kept nothing. And when we started getting into it, I realized I didn't even have half of my soundtrack albums. So we started chasing down albums on eBay, literally. Q.Why weren't you saving any of this?A.It's like for some weird reason, once I finish a project, it doesn't exist to me anymore. They literally had to go through storage rooms, sifting through cardboard boxes filled with junk, until they came up with anything that looked like tapes, DATs, CDs, reel-to-reel stuff. What amounted to zero effort of saving anything for a quarter-century. Now I'm becoming the other way around. Now I really want to get ahold of stuff, I want to organize it. I want to have shelves.Q.So if you weren't hanging on to these materials, where were you finding them?A.My old work tapes just got dumped into boxes and put in the back room. I had six, seven storage rooms throughout the city. Places I haven't gone into in decades. My agent used his tentacles in the underground film music world to try to find versions of things that didn't exist anywhere. It was happening above and below the surface. Lots of detective work.Q.How far back were you searching? Like, Oingo Boingo, ''Bachelor Party''?A.They were finding everything, but they were only bringing to me the stuff that was connected with Burton. Now that my brain is into that mode, I'm going to have them continue. Because now I've got a good, new storage space, and when you get a new space you get motivated. It really is a better idea just to know where stuff is.Q.And what kinds of things were you finding?A.It's a mixed bag of work tapes, demos, and in those demos, ideas that didn't make it into movies. There's a whole stretch of a ''Batman'' work tape, of ''Batman'' music that never made it into the movie. On the one hand, that was cool for me to listen to. I'd forgotten I had all these ideas that never survived. On the other hand, I was horrified that 20 years ago, demos sounded really bad. I'm in the middle of writing this huge disclaimer, trying to explain what a work tape is, and the difference of what I was working with 20 years ago. Between ''Beetlejuice'' and ''Alice in Wonderland,'' you can hear, oh, O.K., big difference.Q.When Tim first started working with you, were you looking for a way that you could make the transition to scoring films?A.I wasn't thinking that at all. It was totally out of the blue. Tim and Paul [Reubens] came to me together. I was shocked. It wasn't like I was looking for an opportunity for film scoring. I hadn't even really fathomed the possibility - that didn't seem possible. ''Pee-wee's Big Adventure,'' my first time ever writing for orchestra, was a very simple score. And I really did think I was totally destroying his film with a score that was so out of left field.Q.Why do you think you and Tim have remained close collaborators all these years?A.We literally did grow into our abilities together. Our aesthetic is similar.Q.Do you share his appreciation for the odd and the gothic?A.Not necessarily, so much as, for whatever reason, his world was an easy place to fall into. It was a place I was comfortable in. We grew up very similar, alienated kids, feeling like a stranger in a strange land. You find yourself gravitating toward fantasy and horror. We both grew up on horror films in the same period, relatively. I grew up around the block from a movie theater, and I spent every weekend of my life there that I can remember. Every weekend was a new double bill, and to be able to see, every single weekend, two new films was really cool. He saw more of them on television, but all the same movies: Hammer films, Roger Corman films. It was a very fertile era to be into the movies.Q.Given those circumstances, I can see why you were so compatible.A.He was in Burbank, I was in Baldwin Hills. They were different suburbs of Los Angeles, but our origins weren't that far apart. So when we met, I said to him, ''Why do you want to hire me?'' He goes: ''I don't know. I've seen your band, I think you could do other stuff.'' The ability to succeed as a composer, you have to be able to relax, take no shape and fall into a new place and re-form yourself. That's the best way I can describe it.That's part of what allows a composer to thrive. I was falling into a lot of different spaces, but every time I fell into Tim's space, I found it was a particularly fun and comfortable space to be."

At the stand, they licked clean the ginger crème and salted black tea Brewla ice pops to reveal directions to the party's secret location printed in now-runny ink on the wooden sticks."

Comic-Con International, the collectibles convention that has grown into an annual must-attend event for the makers and consumers of fantasy entertainment and pop culture, said on Friday that it would remain in San Diego through 2015, The San Diego Union Tribune reported. The convention, which drew 300 attendees when it started in 1970 and now attracts more than 130,000 people to the city and $163 million to the local economy each year, was set to have its contract with the San Diego Convention Center expire in 2012. Tourism officials in Anaheim and Los Angeles had been trying to steer the convention to their cities, amid concerns that it had outgrown the San Diego Convention Center and that local hotels were inflating their rates during their event. The Union Tribune said 64 San Diego hotels in the vicinity of the convention center had committed to discounted rates through 2015, and convention organizers were persuaded to remain in the city without the use of adamantium claws or optic blasts."

And when the Bronx Zoo opened the competition to online voting, it all but guaranteed the end result: ladies and gentlemen, say hello to Justin Beaver. On Friday the Wildlife Conservation Society said ''the overwhelming majority of the votes'' in a poll at bronxzoo.com were cast for the name ''Justin Beaver,'' almost certainly inspired by Justin Bieber, the 16-year-old pop singer and sometime ''CSI'' star. Justin -- the beaver, not the Bieber -- joins his companion Jose the beaver, who was discovered near the Bronx Zoo in early 2007 and named for Representative Jose E. Serrano, Democrat of the Bronx."

But as vilified as she may be at times, Ms. Pelosi is planning an aggressive itinerary to raise money for individual Democratic candidates and for her party in the closing weeks of the campaign. This weekend, Ms. Pelosi will speak at fund-raisers for the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee in New York and Los Angeles, according to her office. She will then attend committee fund-raising dinners with President Obama on Oct. 11 in Coral Gables, Fla., and on Oct. 23 in Minneapolis, and one with Michelle Obama in San Francisco on Oct. 25."

The craft fanatic sourced vintage materials to make herself a floral headband; it caught the attention of her friends, who urged her to go into business. Any fears she may have had were quelled during the shoot for her first look book, when a chance meeting with the singer Fergie led to two of her pieces being purchased on the spot. Cohl incorporates gems, crystals and feathers into her work, making it all very Lady of the Canyon, a nostalgic take on '60s southern California that has found fans among latter-day bohemians like Kate Hudson and the Olsen twins. Her crystal necklaces range from $300 to $400, while the hand-stitched custom headdresses that are her calling card start at $300. Since the company's humble beginnings a little over two years ago, Cohl has graduated from college (she studied Native American poetry) and is now spending more time in Los Angeles. ''I love New York,'' she explains, ''but we weren't getting along too well.''"

2010-10-03T00:00:00Z,"GREEN--Dr. Marvin, prominent New York psychotherapist, mental health administrator, college professor, writer, consultant, and decorated World War II veteran (Bronze Star), died in San Francisco on September 22, after a short illness, at the age of 92. During a long and distinguished career, he maintained for over 30 years a psychotherapy private practice in Valley Stream, NY. He served as Mental Health Commissioner for the Borough of Queens, Executive Administrative Director of the South Shore Child Guidance Center (Freeport, NY), Chief of the Community Services Division of the New York City Housing Authority, Executive Director of the Mental Health Association of Westchester County (where he devised some of the first live telethons for fund raising), Executive Director of the Queens Division of the American Jewish Congress, National Program Department Director for the National Council of Jewish Women. As a consultant to the New York City Board of Education's Community Education Bureau, he pioneered a number of innovative programs to combat juvenile delinquency using Caribbean steel drums and sports figures as role models. He was a longtime Adjunct Professor in the Sociology Department of Nassau Community College. He received his Ph.D. from NYU, his M.S.W. from Columbia University, and his B.S. from City College. Born to poverty in Newark in a broken home, he grew up in the East Village and the Lower East Side of New York. He was a Diplomat in Clinical Social Work of the National Association of Social Workers, a Life Fellow of the American Orthopsychiatric Association, the American Sociological Society, and a Board Examiner in several fields. A tireless advocate for human and civil rights, while serving as President of the Valley Stream District 13 Board of Education, he was contacted by President Kennedy to organize support for the civil rights movement. His publications are diverse, ranging from essays on group dynamics in anthologies to opinion pieces on conformity for the NY Herald Tribune. He wrote regular book reviews for the journal of the American Orthopsychiatric Association. As a consultant, he journeyed to China (where he observed the treatment of the institutionalized mentally ill), to the Soviet Union (where he observed group education and treatment methods) and to the emerging nation of Jamaica (where he advised officials on plans for group development of underprivileged youth). He was a decorated veteran of World War II (Bronze Star medal): during the Battle of the Bulge, he administered medical aid and performed an amputation under fire, saving the lives of his comrades (while he sustained injuries). His son, Dr. Geoffrey Green, his daughter-in-law, Dr. Marcia Green, and numerous nephews and nieces survive him. His son, Arne, and his wife, Martha, predecease him. The unveiling and an informal commemoration of his life will be held October 10 at 3pm at The Sanctuary at Mount Lebanon Cemetery, 7800 Myrtle Avenue, Glendale, NY. 718.821.0200.

If so, the St. Regis Lhasa Resort is opening on Nov. 15, becoming the first luxury chain to open an outpost in the Tibetan capital. The butler will be on hand to address altitude sickness as well as less urgent tasks like shining shoes and suggesting monasteries to visit. Such service is among the many amenities uncharacteristic of lodging in the area.Other features include guest rooms furnished with vintage photographs, plasma TVs, DVD players and high-speed Internet access. The resort, which offers views of the Potala Palace, also has three restaurants: an upscale Tibetan dining room that serves local dishes including yak, a Chinese one featuring Cantonese and Sichuan food, and an all-day restaurant touting international fare, including egg-and-bacon breakfasts. Rare, aged blends highlight menus in both the wine bar and the tea room."

2010-10-03T00:00:00Z,"Albert Watson's eye rarely rests on one thing for long. For over four decades, he has refused to settle in one camp, allowing the breadth of his vision and the variety of his work to take in the worlds of fashion, portraiture and reportage. Likewise his sittings have ranged from supermodels to prisoners, from athletes to aristocrats. Add to the list advertising campaigns for clients like Prada, Estee Lauder, Revlon and Gap and it's not hard to see why he is considered such an elastic virtuoso. The graphic intensity and epic intention of Watson's images are now on display in ''UFO: Unified Fashion Objectives'' (Abrams; $135), a retrospective book of what he considers his best work. (Images from ''UFO'' are also on show at Hasted Hunt Kraeutler, 537 W. 24th Street, from October 21.) While some of his subject matter has been relegated to the cultural periphery, Watson's ability to dazzle the eye and transcend the immediacy of his art form endure. This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print."

2010-10-03T00:00:00Z,"THE SON ALSO RISES ''If you wanted to,'' says Barnaba Fornasetti, ''you could easily live in a Fornasetti world.'' As the only son of Piero Fornasetti, he knows of what he speaks. Often referred to as the ''designer of dreams,'' Piero was nothing if not prolific. The application of his fanciful patterns and simple, classically inspired illustrations knew no boundaries, and his fertile imagination conjured up objects, clothing and furniture, including the iconic Trumeau-bar, a combination sideboard, bar and bureau, originally designed with the architect Gio Ponti and still in production today. The Fornasetti archive, which holds about 13,000 pieces -- some of which are shown in ''Fornasetti: The Complete Universe,'' out this month from Rizzoli -- is said to be one of the largest of its kind. After Piero's death in 1988, Barnaba took over the dream factory, which by then was something of a nightmare. ''When he died, the company was drowning in debt,'' says Barnaba, who like his father, was born an artist, not a businessman. But his creativity has served him well. Today he heads a team of 20 working out of his home and atelier in the Città Studi neighborhood of Milan, in a house built by Piero's father. The laboratory for his father's wildest creations is now Barnaba's treasure box."

As women change into autumn dresses for luncheons, the predominant length is mid-knee. Other women are not relinquishing their above-the-knee skirts. And then there is a group already experimenting with calf-length skirts, which have no relationship to the street-sweepers of summer. One woman, at right, couldn't make up her mind.

2010-10-03T00:00:00Z,"The British painter David Hockney has never confined himself to just one artistic medium. (Remember the Polaroid collages?) True to form, he was quick to embrace the iPhone's Brushes app, among others. Even as he was working on large-scale landscapes of his native Yorkshire, England -- for a big 2012 exhibition at the Royal Academy of Arts in London -- Hockney was drawing energetic, vividly colored images of flowers, places and people at screen scale, which he e-mails to friends. These, along with his drawings on the iPad, are the subject of ''David Hockney: Fleurs Fraîches,'' which runs from Oct. 20 to Jan. 30, 2011, at the Pierre Bergé-Yves Saint Laurent Foundation in Paris. Curated by Charlie Scheips and designed by the New York architect Ali Tayar of Parallel Design, the exhibition will present the artwork in its original digital format, including animations of one or more works. (Brushes records the process of a painting in video.) The iPhones and iPads themselves will be set into fiberboard panels like the ones that line Hockney's studio, and Tayar is even designing special furniture for the installation -- which Scheips says ''won't look like an Apple store. It will be more homey.'' The act of iPainting seems no less immediate for its lack of actual pigments; Scheips says Hockney becomes so immersed that he stops to wipe off his fingers. PILAR VILADAS"

2010-10-03T00:00:00Z,"When designers make gallery pieces, you get sculptural chairs and charred chandeliers. But when artists create furniture, even the pretense of functionality disappears, leading to weird works like homoerotic bunk beds and chandeliers, like the one by Lee Bul (below), that don't light up. These are the kinds of conceptually charged objects cataloged in ''The New Décor,'' the book based on a recent exhibition at the Hayward Gallery in London and traveling to the Garage in Moscow this month. Their purpose is not to elevate the trappings of domestic life but to question our very faith in them. ''Contemporary artists are associating the home with a sense of movement, insecurity and precariousness,'' says the Hayward's director, Ralph Rugoff. ''Rather than being a castle, home is a vulnerable place now.'' While the more absurd pieces -- like a giant hot-pink papier-mâché phallus bench by Franz West -- explore our private space as a kind of public theater, others are more obviously unsettling. The Swiss artist Fabrice Gygi's tented writing desk is somewhere between a child's fort and a bomb shelter, and Jin Shi's Chinese migrant worker's dwelling is a chilling reminder of how the other half lives.

2010-10-03T00:00:00Z,"Rolling Up TARP, Though the Cleanup Isn't OverON Sunday, the Treasury Department officially loses its ability to make new commitments under the Troubled Asset Relief Program. Thegovernment created the bailout fund -- originally set at $700 billion and lowered to $475 billion by the Dodd-Frank Act in July -- to aid troubled companies and to bring stability to the economy at the height of the financial crisis two years ago.While the program has essentially expired, much remains to be resolved. Despite repayments of $200 billion by nearly 100 companies, more than $180 billion is outstanding, mostly concentrated among 616 banks, twoaautomakers and the troubled insurance giant A.I.G. And the Treasury still has the authority to spend up to $46 billion to help homeowners facing foreclosure -- money that would not be reclaimed.But the Treasury is optimistic that the bulk of the outstanding money will be returned and that profits -- nearly $27 billion so far from interest, dividend payments and the sale of warrants -- will mostly offset any losses.Last week, the Treasury even announced that its commitments to A.I.G. -- at one point projected to cost taxpayers up to $50 billion -- might actually make money in the end, though that remains speculative. Indeed, the Congressional panel that overseesTARP, and will continue to do so through next April, suggested in a recent report that cost estimates should be taken with a grain of salt.''The panel is very pleased with the improvements we have seen with the cost projections for TARP, but the public needs to understand that these calculations are complicated and involve a lot of assumptions,'' Damon Silvers, the deputy chairman of the panel, said on Friday. ''The numbers could get better or they could get worse.''"

The people of the town might argue that the assessment that ''Greytown surrendered long ago to the jungle's relentless en- croachment'' is a bit disingenuous. In 1984 Greytown was destroyed for the second time (the first by the United States warship Cyane in 1854) in a Sandinista battle with Contra forces supported by the C.I.A.

The Crocker has been closely linked to the artist ever since, mounting several large solo exhibitions of his work over the years and letting him riffle through its storage rooms for inspiration. Now, with the museum reopening on Oct. 10 after a major expansion, Mr. Thiebaud is returning the favor with a gift: his new painting ''River Intersection,'' based on the snaking waterways and cultivated fields of the Sacramento River Delta. Since the mid-1990s, when he began a series devoted to this landscape, Mr. Thiebaud has found the palette and patterns offered by the delta region to be a rich source of inspiration. He began the painting by walking around the fields and levees -- sometimes climbing them to get higher vantage points -- and making sketches and studies that he later reconfigured from memory back in the studio. '' 'River Intersection' tries to express various seasons, various times of the day, various vantage points, and then tries to get the thing to come together like a whole,'' he said. ''For me, painting has a lot to do with the exercise of empathy, where you have to believe that you're walking the path or under the trees, that you are somehow able to transfer yourself into that picture.''"

There are never any structured thoughts in my head when I look up. They just come and go and change shape like the clouds. I have a wonderful view of Alexandra Palace. This is not a royal palace but a 19th-century leisure center for exhibitions and events -- a people's palace, known locally as ''Ally Pally.'' It was the place from which the world's first regularly scheduled television transmissions were broadcast, in the 1930s, and the famous antenna is still there. Below it I can see the doors of the studios where modern television began, and I find that thrilling. The palace is still a venue for the occasional exhibition, but mostly it just sits there on the hill, waiting for someone to find a good use for it in this information age."

Meanwhile, auction prices for vintage Ponti pieces have been on a winning streak, not unlike the thoroughbred racehorse named after him. Now ''The Expression of Gio Ponti,'' curated by Germano Celant, gives the designer his biggest local showcase since the days of the old Alitalia ticket offices he created at 666 Fifth Avenue. The whopping retrospective, which opens Nov. 13 and is the first exhibition at the brand-new Triennale di Milano design museum in Midtown, includes 250 items, from drawings to majolica to furniture, including the iconic Superleggera chair, which Ponti called, with characteristic flair, ''the chair for all times.''

The result, a 3-foot-by-4-foot black-and-white grid of numbers and letters, was snapped up by the Museum of Modern Art for its permanent collection before a single calendar was printed. And it has been in print ever since, becoming at one point a fixture in the office of architects like Richard Meier, whose books and Web site are also designed by the legendary Vignelli. ''I wouldn't do anything without Massimo,'' Meier insisted. ''We both resolve ideas with a grid.'' For Vignelli -- who, with his wife and partner in Vignelli Associates, Lella, is also known for designs like New York City's 1972 subway map and stacked plastic dinnerware for Heller, and who co-designed the just-opened Vignelli Center for Design Studies at the Rochester Institute of Technology -- the calendar is an exercise in white space (or black; random pages of the calendars are reverse-printed). ''For us, the space outside the type is more important than the type itself,'' he said. Vignelli also designed a smaller version of the calendar, which he wishes was still in production. ''Some people don't have room for the large one,'' he explained. But no matter: even if Vignelli doesn't receive royalties for it, he's happy that the big calendar is still in print. ''It's nice to see how fresh it still looks.'' Go to unicahome.com. PILAR VILADAS"

Wins by the Rays and the Yankees on Saturday ensured that the American League East winner and the A.L. wild card would be determined Sunday. But the situation in the National League is more complicated: two playoff spots are left, and three teams have the chance to claim them. San Francisco needed to win only one game this weekend to clinch the N.L. West, but the Giants lost the first two to the Padres, cutting their lead in the division to one. The Padres' two wins, combined with two Braves losses, resulted in a tie in the N.L. wild-card standings.

Among the cases examined by Ms. Ellerbee, center above, are those of Carl Walker Hoover, who hanged himself at age 11 after becoming the target of gay slurs, and Jon Carmichael, who hanged himself at 13 after being picked on because of his short stature. Other participants include Emma, a 17-year-old from South Hadley, Mass., where, in 2010, Phoebe Prince, a 15-year-old transfer student from Ireland, committed suicide after being relentlessly taunted about her sexual history. And then there is Maria, 13, who was suspended for harassing a classmate and has since been part of an anti-bullying program in Atlanta.

But at some point during such festivities, an awkward situation arises. I enter my host's bathroom for a quick freshening of hands or to minister to an urgent function. There is nothing to do but look around the bathroom, noting fixtures, shower curtains, rugs. Some décor is predictably matchy-matchy; some objects are pleasantly marked by habit and custom. The pictures on the wall prompt idle curiosity: what mysterious forces lurk behind this vapid still life or that totemic oddity? And then it happens -- that unwanted glimpse into personal space. The orderly lives of others are laid bare by their toothbrushes, lying moribund with flayed bristles or pocked with Jackson Pollock-like flecks or stuck in cloudy glasses of lowly origin. The charmed atmosphere in the living room is foredoomed by unwanted details. True, what others do behind closed doors is their business. But images confound. They are vivid, indelible, often as welcome as uninvited guests. If our aesthetic reach stops short of our most personal utensils, what does that say? Dirty brushes say a lot. Hair, nail and makeup brushes demand cleanliness and get extra points for style. A dirty toothbrush -- well, who'd want to kiss someone who had just used that?"

Baldwin, a charming, well-born native of Baltimore who was the protégé of Ruby Ross Wood (see Lewis's previous book, ''The Great Lady Decorators''), developed a bold, modern style that confidently mixed patterns and periods; he became the go-to decorator for people like Babe Paley, Cole Porter and Diana Vreeland, whose legendary ''garden in hell'' red living room he designed. Baldwin was never afraid of color and is said to have pioneered the use of aubergine walls, in a Maryland house (above) in the 1940s. The book, which has an affectionate foreword by Albert Hadley, Baldwin's former student, is a welcome addition to the two (out-of-print and increasingly expensive) volumes on the decorator's work, ''Billy Baldwin Decorates'' and ''Billy Baldwin Remembers.''

2010-10-03T00:00:00Z,"In 1953, the architect Benjamin Thompson (1918-2002) opened a store called Design Research on Brattle Street in Cambridge, Mass. Thompson, a former partner of the Modernist master Walter Gropius, wanted a place where people could buy everything they needed for contemporary living. He made Marimekko dresses and Iittala glasses must-haves, eventually opening stores in New York and San Francisco and designing a striking new glass-and-concrete home for the Cambridge store that opened in 1969. ''The architect's place on this planet,'' he said, ''is to create that special environment where life can be lived to its fullest.'' D/R, as it was known, closed in 1978, but many people, including me, never got over it. The history and influence of D/R are examined in ''Design Research: The Store That Brought Modern Living to American Homes'' (Chronicle), a new book by Jane Thompson and Alexandra Lange. Thompson, a respected urban planner (who won this year's Lifetime Achievement honor at the National Design Awards), is the architect's widow and, after meeting him in the 1960s, worked with him on pioneering projects like Faneuil Hall Marketplace and the South Street Seaport. Lange is a design writer and architectural historian. (See her profile of the toy designer Renate Müller on Page 46.) In their prologue, the authors characterize Design Research as ''a warm, eclectic, colorful and international version of modernism, one that mixed folk art and Mies van der Rohe, Noguchi and no-name Bolivian sweaters, offering newlyweds and Nobel Prize winners one-stop shopping for tools to eat, sleep, dress, even to party in a beautiful way.'' By the time D/R closed (Thompson had lost control of the company eight years earlier), it had attracted a fan club that included Julia Child and Jackie Kennedy, and influenced retailers like Gordon Segal, the founder of Crate & Barrel, and Rob Forbes, who founded Design Within Reach. In his foreword to Thompson and Lange's book, Forbes said that in 2000, when he conducted a customer survey of influential design stores, Design Research came out on top -- and it had been closed for 22 years."

To that end Mr. Wolf designed the Clarke National Oil Burner, and in the late 50's invented a spill-less fuel box. A Heating Contractor from 1934 to 2005. Mo Wolf, as he liked to be called, was instrumental in converting a major part of New York City--50 to 60 thousand residential and commercial buildings -- from coal to fuel oil. He installed heating systems in many of the largest residential and commercial buildings in the City, including Knickerbocker Village, Vandeveer Estates, 330 Seventh Avenue, No. 1 Fifth Avenue, Marble Collegiate Church and St George's Church and West Point. A long time consultant for the Department Of Air Resources, Mr. Wolf was a trustee in Local 32E, the Building Trades Union, for many years. He has the distinction of having the longest held Oil Burner's Installer's License. An avid tennis player from age 10 to 93, Mo Wolf played socially with the likes of Don Budge and Bobby Riggs. Mo graduated UNC Chapel Hill in 1932 Summa Cum Laude with a degree in chemistry.

2010-10-03T00:00:00Z,"For Dieter Roth, life and art were part of the same messy process. His creative output included a multimedia diary of six months of his life, which he produced for the 1982 Venice Biennale, and cumulative works like ''Gartenskulptur,'' which started out as a self-portrait in chocolate and birdseed and acquired enough collateral material over the course of several years -- various household objects, ladders, television monitors, even a live rabbit in a hutch -- to fill an entire room. Other pieces Roth made used the clothes off his back. From the 1970s until his death in 1998, the German-born Swiss artist lived and worked in cities like Mosfellsbaer, Seydisfjordur, Basel and Vienna, but the one constant, no matter where he set up shop, were his worktables with their protective mats. These sheets of gray cardboard soaked up the life of the studio, some of it deliberate (say, a drawing), some of it accidental (the ring left by a cup of coffee or a glass of water), until they were retired from duty and hung on the wall. Roth's son Björn, who worked by his father's side the last two decades of his life, recalls how even a failed cake for Dieter's 40th birthday -- glorious to look at but ultimately inedible -- became content for a mat when it was spat out after one bite along with gulps of hot cocoa, adding credibility to Roth's theory that art was neither cool nor hot, neither emotional nor intellectual, but simply a smear on something. (That mat was ultimately cut up into postcards; the cake was framed under glass.) Another mat was cut up to fit into a suitcase for transport and then reassembled as a collage. A selection of these ''Tischmatten,'' as they are called, are at Hauser & Wirth in New York from Oct. 6 to 30. Some of them inevitably look like glorified doodles -- the assumption being, perhaps, that every mark the artist makes has equal value, aesthetic or otherwise. The best examples, however, vibrate with the effortless beauty of happenstance. As the Roth scholar Andrea Büttner wrote in the introductory essay to the show's catalog, Roth discovered that ''even covering things up and leaving them alone were strategies that produced a beauty of their own, one that was ultimately more beautiful and more entertaining than pieces that he might previously have labored over.''

2010-10-04T16:04:46Z,"Mexico City is a well-documented hotbed of contradictions: wealth side by side with poverty, globalization nuzzling indigenous tradition, beheadings alongside leisurely afternoons in lush parks sucking jicama pops. In a city that contains 2,000 official colonias (neighborhoods), even intrepid visitors who come to explore end up sticking to one safe corner of this metropolis. A short taxi ride from the trendy Condesa/Roma area is the colonia Narvarte, a charming middle-class neighborhood where Che Guevara lived while plotting the overthrow of the Batista dictatorship with Fidel Castro. The area is known for its wide avenues with palm-lined camellones (traffic islands) and a somewhat old-fashioned atmosphere, and it also happens to house some of the city's greatest taquerias. Here's where to go."

On one such recent visit with Eviana Hartman, the designer behind the eco-conscious label Bodkin, T was thrilled to find that Hartman, now in her fourth season, is expanding into swimwear. ""I was heading to Mal País, Costa Rica, for my first surf trip,"" says Hartman of her decision to dive into new territory. ""I couldn't quite find a bathing suit that was me."" Her decision was sealed when she stumbled upon a pile of dead-stock gray and mint heather fabric in a Los Angeles warehouse. For now, the swimwear line features only two styles - the two-piece ""Bodkini"" and the one-piece twister suit (twisting and knotting is also featured throughout the lively spring/summer clothing collection) - but Hartman is optimistic that it will make a splash with her loyal fan base.

A prominent San Francisco investor and philanthropist who led the effort to revitalize the California Academy of Sciences, died on Friday, September 24 at age 48 surrounded by his wife, Elizabeth, and their three children. The cause of death was a brain tumor. He was a devoted husband, father, son, brother and friend, who vastly touched so many with his warmth, generosity of spirit, and zest for living. His unwavering commitment to making a difference in the world was illuminated by his community leadership, his environmentally focused philanthropy, and the building of a highly successful investment partnership. From a young age, he displayed a natural talent for leadership and excellence. Born in Columbus, Ohio, he spent his childhood in Grand Junction, Colorado, where he developed his reverence for the outdoors that led to his becoming an avid sportsman and environmentalist. He went on to attend Harvard College, graduating magna cum laude in 1984. In his senior year at Harvard he was Co-Captain of the Varsity Lightweight Crew and President of the A.D. Club. He studied economics for one year at Australia National University in Canberra, Australia as a Rotary Foundation Scholar before attending the Stanford Graduate School of Business, graduating as an Arjay Miller Scholar in 1989. After graduating Stanford, he founded SPO Partners & Co. together with John H. Scully and William E. Oberndorf in 1991, which has become one of the nation's leading investment partnerships. At the time of his death, he served as a Managing Director of SPO Partners, Chairman of the Board of Calpine Corporation and was a director of Rosewood Hotels and Resorts. As Chair of the Board of Trustees of the California Academy of Sciences, his leadership helped complete its $500 million capital campaign to build its widely praised new home in San Francisco's Golden Gate Park and greatly expand its environmentally based education programs. He was also a former trustee and board president of the Bay Area Discovery Museum, chaired the Stanford Business School Trust, served as a member of the Advisory Council for the Woods Institute for the Environment at Stanford, and was named a Henry Crown Fellow of the Aspen Institute in 2004. He was an avid runner, collected wine, kept bees, and embraced remote travel and discovery to continually learn about the world around him. In addition to his wife of 23 years, he is survived by his children, William, Eleanor and Graham. He is also survived by his mother, Joan T. McNab of Aspen, Colorado, his father, Dr. William R. Patterson of Grand Junction, Colorado and his siblings Robin J. Blackwood of Bozeman, Montana and Thomas A. Patterson of Portola Valley, California. A memorial service will be announced at a later time. In lieu of flowers, the family requests that donations be made in Mr. Patterson's name to either the California Academy of Sciences or a charitable organization of their choice."

That new test detects a specific type of chemical, called a plasticizer, that is found in plastic IV bags.

A rock opera set to more than 20 Green Day songs, ''American Idiot'' grossed $1,092,334 for the week, according to the producers - a significant improvement over the show's weekly average gross of $740,000 since opening on April 20 at the St. James Theater. The maximum possible gross for that week of performances would have been about $1.3 million. For his final performance on Sunday night, Mr. Armstrong also composed a brief number that he played - and which can be watched here or in the above video - after the curtain call and before the encore, ''Good Riddance (Time of Your Life).''

''Being a star is merely perching at the head of the downgrade. A competent player can last a lifetime. A star, a year or two.'' Indeed, March arrived in Hollywood with the classic good looks of a leading man. But he kept his career going for 50 years by daring to appear ugly in films like the first in this monthlong tribute, ''Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde'' (1931), for which March, above with Miriam Hopkins, won a best actor Oscar (tying with Wallace Beery for ''The Champ'') as the tormented doctor with a split personality, aided by a makeup job that turned him into a hideous sight. The salute continues with ''The Man in the Gray Flannel Suit'' (1956), at 10, based on Sloan Wilson's novel about corporate life in the 1950s, with Gregory Peck as an urban commuter taking personal inventory, and March as the network head who is demanding his attention. ''I Married a Witch'' (1942), at 12:45 a.m., finds March playing a gubernatorial candidate opposite Veronica Lake's blond sorceress and performing a convincing love scene, even though the two were said to loathe each other in real life. In ''... Tick ...Tick ... Tick'' (1970), at 2:15, he plays the mayor of a small Southern town in which a black sheriff (Jim Brown) sets off racial fireworks.

2010-10-05T00:00:00Z,"Let the verbal combat begin. Starting in earnest this week, candidates across the country are facing each other in high-profile, high-risk debates that political consultants say could matter more than anything else they do before Election Day. More than a half-dozen debates are scheduled for the next two weeks. ''The debate is usually the only full Monty event in the campaign,'' says Chris Lehane, a Democratic strategist with a long history of advising candidates on debate strategy. The typical debate, Mr. Lehane said, ''is that moment when the candidates are on a stage, by themselves, on their own and where the public will extrapolate an awful lot about their character by how they handle themselves.'' In Connecticut tonight, Richard Blumenthal, the Democratic candidate for Senate, will face Linda E. McMahon, his Republican challenger just hours after Ms. McMahon lodged an explosive new charge about Mr. Blumenthal's veracity in describing his record of military service. And in the California governor's race, Jerry Brown and Meg Whitman, who clashed in a debate filled with vitriol over the weekend, mutually agreed this afternoon to cancel another face-off that was scheduled for KGO radio in San Francisco on Tuesday morning. ''There is no debate tomorrow,'' Sterling Clifford, a Brown spokesman, said. An official with Ms. Whitman's campaign also wrote in an email that ''there's no debate. The campaigns have jointly communicated that fact to KGO. There was interest but organizers failed follow through correctly on initial interest.'' Debates between candidates for statewide office often fly well below the national radar. They are typically not televised nationally, or are heard only on local radio or television stations. But the outcome can either cement the direction of a race or sharply alter it. And when political mistakes happen during a debate, the Internet-fueled political media can turn them into part of a broader narrative about their campaigns and about the battles being waged by the political parties more broadly. In the debate between Senator Barbara Boxer and her Republican challenger, Carly Fiorina, for example, Ms. Boxer has opened up a lead with television ads after a debate exchange with Ms. Fiorina, a businesswoman, about shipping jobs overseas. ''Debates are these political performances that produce moments,'' said Kevin Madden, a Republican strategist who served as national press secretary to former Massachusetts governor Mitt Romney in 2008. ''Moments that crystallize the attributes, either good or bad, of a candidate and the race itself.'' Florida's Senate candidates will engage in a three-way face-off on Wednesday. The candidates for Senate in Wisconsin - who are locked in a very close race - will debate on Friday. The Illinois Senate contenders will debate on Sunday morning. Debates for Senate races in Pennsylvania, Ohio and Colorado, and for the Colorado governor's race, are also on the books. The candidates for governor in Florida are facing each other for the first time on Friday. In a debate on Monday, Deval Patrick, the Democratic governor of Massachusetts, clashed with his Republican challenger, Charles Baker, in a debate at the Massachusetts Biotechnology Council For Democrats who are running behind their challengers, the debates offer the best opportunity to shake up the race and knock their opponents off track. Republicans can use the personal confrontations to help make use of a national mood in which voters appear to be angry at the establishment. But strategists in both parties said the candidates --and especially the Republicans candidates who are new to big-time politics - should be careful. A bad debate can derail a campaign, they said. ''The political climate is ripe for change,'' said Scott Reed, a Republican strategist who helped run Bob Dole's presidential campaign. ''But candidates in both parties still need a strong debate performance to really close the deal with voters.'' Voters are watching Tea Party-endorsed candidates, in particular, strategists said, to see how they stand up to scrutiny. Many of those candidates are in the glare of big-time politics for the first time. ''The debates are going to be major moments where some of these candidates may steps across the character Rubicon for better or worse,'' Mr. Lehane said. ''In this sense, these are even more important debates for the Republican nominees to address their past comments and controversial positions.'' This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print."

He canceled his appearances with the orchestra halfway through his one-month fall stint with it so he could fly to Milan on Monday to seek treatment for what the orchestra called ''extreme gastric distress.'' Mr. Muti suffered stomach pains over the weekend and canceled a Saturday-evening gala performance at the last minute -- the orchestra played with no conductor -- and decided on Sunday to consult with his own doctors in Milan. Mr. Muti had been with the Chicago Symphony for only two weeks, beginning his tenure as its new music director after a long courtship and much hoopla accompanying his arrival. ''I cannot express the depth of my regret,'' he said in a statement issued by the orchestra. Its president, Deborah F. Rutter, said, ''The most important thing is that Maestro Muti makes a complete recovery.'' The Chicago Symphony has engaged Harry Bicket, Asher Fisch and Pierre Boulez to replace him for concerts this month."

But even within that framework, the latest science about antioxidants, free radicals and exercise is telling. As many of us have heard, free radicals are molecules created by the breakdown of oxygen during metabolism. Each of us constantly creates free radicals simply by living and breathing. But these molecules are highly reactive and capricious, sometimes attacking other cells and damaging tissue. Wilding free radicals have been linked with a number of diseases and with aging. Exercise, because it requires increased oxygen consumption, also increases the production of free radicals. So, many experts began urging the fitness-minded to pop large doses of antioxidant vitamin supplements, like vitamins C and E, to counteract the presumed damaging effects of the free radicals. Food alone would not supply sufficient levels of the necessary antioxidants, it was thought. The exercising body needed help from vitamins."

2010-10-06T00:00:00Z,"Virtually every playwright has an unfinished or unresolved script tucked in a drawer somewhere. For Tony Kushner, that play was ''Henry Box Brown,'' a one act written in the early 1990s while he was finishing his epic ''Angels in America,'' whose two parts went on to win back-to-back Tony Awards for best play in 1993 and 1994. Mr. Kushner wrote ''Henry Box Brown'' for Juilliard School of Drama students to perform while he was playwright-in-residence there from 1990 to 1992, but the play never ended up being mounted through Juilliard, or anywhere else, until now. For just seven performances that conclude on Tuesday night, graduate acting students at New York University's Tisch School of the Arts are quietly holding a world premiere production of the play, now titled ''Henry Box Brown: Political-Historical-Doggerel-Vaudeville,'' in a tiny theater space in the East Village.The real-life title character, a Virginia slave in the 19th century, became internationally known for encasing himself in a box used to ship tobacco and then sent via mail delivery to the safe hands of a group of abolitionists in Philadelphia. Brown eventually left the United States for Great Britain, to insure his continued freedom as a fugitive slave, and began touring music halls through northern England to share his life story."

2010-10-07T16:43:15Z,"MINNEAPOLIS - As he so often has in the past, Mariano Rivera recorded the most important out in the Yankees' Game 1 victory Wednesday night. Getting Denard Span to ground out with two on and two out in the eighth inning improved the Yankees' win probability by 13 percent, according to baseball-reference.com, to 92 percent over all. Their second most important out came from someone whose brightest career postseason moment also came against the Twins in last year's American League division series. Derek Jeter started calling Dave Robertson ""Houdini"" last year after he escaped a bases-loaded, no-out jam in the 11th inning of Game 2. This time, Robertson was asked to get only one out, but what an out it was, striking out Jim Thome and thwarting a two-on, two-out rally in the seventh. Robertson threw three straight curve balls to Thome. The second dropped over the plate for a called second strike. The third bounced in front of the plate and drew a feeble swing. ""That was a beautiful sequence,"" Alex Rodriguez said. ""He came with the fastball then threw him three nasty breaking balls."" Omitting a second left-handed reliever was a calculated risk by Joe Girardi, who, with left-handed starters set to pitch in four of five games, figured that Boone Logan would be sufficient to navigate through Joe Mauer, Thome and Jason Kubel. To start the seventh, Girardi went with Logan, who got two outs but gave way to Robertson after Mauer singled. The Yankees had seven more outs to get, but the bullpen was set up almost perfectly. Kerry Wood matched up well with the bottom of the Twins' order, which had right-handed hitters in three of four slots, and the Yankees never have to worry about matchups when Rivera came in. Every one is in Rivera's favor. If a save situation arises again Thursday, Girardi will obviously turn to Rivera again, though he was uncertain whether he would ask him to pitch multiple innings for a second straight night. Rivera's struggles last month began on Sept. 11, when he surrendered two ninth-inning runs in Texas, the night after working two innings, and Girardi said he was cognizant of a possible link. ""I would prefer not to do it tonight, but I said that last night,"" Girardi said. "

The Otago Daily Times also reported that Gerry Brownlee, the country's minister for economic development, and Chris Finlayson, its minister for arts and culture, met on Monday with Mr. Jackson and Fran Walsh, his wife and producing and writing partner.

2010-10-07T00:00:00Z,"A committee of the Lower Manhattan Development Corporation on Wednesday recommended that the corporation allocate at least $100 million for the performing arts center planned for ground zero. The money would come from a pool of some $200 million formerly designated for utility companies. At the corporation's board meeting on Wednesday, Kate D. Levin, the New York City cultural affairs commissioner, said the money was important ''to fulfill this critical part of the master plan.'' The financing, which requires approval by the full board, would add to $50 million in federal money set aside for the project, which is controlled by the development corporation. Still unresolved is whether to build the center on the World Trade Center site, as called for in the master plan, or at 130 Liberty Street, site of the former Deutsche Bank building.

2010-10-08T18:57:17Z,"Last Saturday brought a wealth of marquee matchups, including Florida-Alabama, Stanford-Oregon and Texas-Oklahoma. At first glance, this weekend doesn't look as glitzy. But that's only because teams are now into the grind of conference play, where each week brings a familiar opponent and the chance to be lulled into complacency. Alabama has one of the more absurd conference schedules in recent memory, with South Carolina the first of six SEC opponents that will be coming off a bye week when they face the Tide. That will make the Tide's road through the league that much more difficult. Florida will try to bounce back from being handled easily by Alabama when it faces Louisiana State in the Swamp. The Tigers, through a combination of good defense and horrendous clock management, are 5-0 but being treated like they are underachievers. A win against the Gators could give them some credibility. Elsewhere in Florida, Florida State and Miami will play the latest installment of a rivalry that was one of the best in college football over the last quarter century. While that rivalry has lost some of its luster, Michigan-Michigan State has gained some glitz thanks to the outsize performance of Denard Robinson this season. Coach Mark Dantonio is expected to return to the Spartans after missing two games after having a mild heart attack. In the Pac-10, Stanford is coming off a loss to Oregon and Southern California is hoping to prove that it still deserves to be considered one of the conference's top teams. There is plenty to be excited about now that conference play has started in earnest and the history and familiarity between teams always makes prognosticating that much more difficult. As always, if you agree, disagree or simply find the picks laughable, feel free to let us know."

The 2,200-page Dodd-Frank Act, which President Obama signed this summer, creates an Orwellian alphabet soup of new agencies, oversight boards and offices intended to protect us from ourselves. The problem is that since the incentives on Wall Street have not been changed one iota by the new laws - nor are they likely to be changed by any of the soon-to-be-written regulations of federal agencies - we're no better protected from bankers' potentially reckless behavior than we were before the latest round of reforms."

2010-10-08T00:00:00Z,"Had you been inclined to wager on the winner of the 2010 Nobel Prize in Literature based on the odds set by Ladbrokes, the British bookmaking chain, you might have put your money on the Swedish poet Thomas Transtromer, the Syrian poet Adonis, the Kenyan novelist Ngugi wa Thiong'o or the South Korean poet Ko Un. And you would have come home with a big fat goose egg when the Peruvian novelist Mario Vargas Llosa (who was given 25-1 odds by Ladbrokes) was named the winner on Thursday morning. That hasn't stopped the betting company from suspending wagers on the Man Booker Prize amid suspicion that that award's winner may be a foregone conclusion. The Guardian reported Ladbrokes closed bets on the prestigious British literary prize after receiving nearly 15,000 (about $24,000) in wagers on Wednesday morning for Tom McCarthy's novel ''C.'' Since July, Ladbrokes said, it had received a total of only 10,000 (about $16,000) in bets for the prize, whose other finalists include Peter Carey's ''Parrot and Olivier in America'' and Emma Donoghue's ''Room.''"

In an interview with television station WSFA in Montgomery, Ala., Mr. Bright said he would vote for neither Ms. Pelosi nor Representative John A. Boehner of Ohio, the Republican leader and likely speaker candidate should Republicans win control of the House. He said he would instead vote for ''a centrist who is much more like me and also much more like 80 percent of the people in America.''"

2010-10-08T00:00:00Z,"8 P.M. (CMT) PETTY BLUE Think of Nascar, and chances are the name Petty is going to come to mind. This new documentary follows the family dynasty around the track, starting with its patriarch, Lee Petty (above, center, with his sons Maurice, left, and Richard), who raced under No. 42 and was the face of Nascar's earliest days in 1949. It continues with his son Richard (No. 43), the Hall of Famer and driver with the most wins in the sport's history -- and the only motor sports athlete to earn the Presidential Medal of Freedom -- and Richard's son, Kyle (No. 44), who has twice won one of Nascar's most prominent honors, the Myers Brothers Award.

He is also survived by his step-mother, Rose Ann, brothers, William, Peter, Joseph, Michael and Charles and his sisters, Dorothy, Maura, Kathleen and Margaret, and their spouses.

The O'Connor Group, now O'Connor Capital Partners, continued in the mall development and management business and later managed a series of private equity funds that remain active today. In addition to his retail work he was most proud of the rejuvenation of Parkchester, a residential community in the Bronx. Jerry truly believed ""to whom much is given, much is expected"" and as such was a generous supporter of numerous charities among them: The Papal Foundation, Gregorian University, Catholic Relief Services, Partners in Health, and The Bronxville School Foundation. Jerry also served for many years as a Trustee and Chair of the Investment Committee of The College of the Holy Cross.

Jerry was a graduate of the College of the Holy Cross 1963, Harvard Business School 1967 and served as a Lieutenant (J.G) in the U.S. Navy.

In another twist of the knife, Mr. Loscocco promptly endorsed Charles Baker Jr., the Republican. Then Mr. Cahill himself ramped up the drama, filing a lawsuit Thursday against the aides who jumped ship, essentially accusing them of high treason. The highly unusual suit charges that the aides not only orchestrated Mr. Loscocco's defection, but shared campaign secrets with the Baker shop."

2010-10-09T00:00:00Z,"6:30 P.M. (49); 7 P.M. (13) THE THIS OLD HOUSE HOUR An oldie proves it's still a goodie as this pioneering home-renovation series begins a new season by giving an Auburndale, Mass., house -- a dated 1940s dwelling on a picture-perfect plot next to the Charles River in suburban Boston -- what the show's crew is calling a Cinderella transformation. The building, owned by Raveen and Allison Sharma, will receive a sorely needed curb-appeal makeover, the better to fit into a neighborhood of charming cottages and Colonial Revivals. The renovation will also include an updated kitchen and bathrooms, a new family room, an improved roofline and enlarged windows to take advantage of the panoramic view. In this first of 16 episodes, the general contractor, Tom Silva, conducts a structural investigation and cites concerns about a new law from the Environmental Protection Agency on professional remodelers' handling of materials covered in lead paint. But that's not the only hazard lurking: the structure will require nearly two full weeks of asbestos removal. Above, a scene from the show. This half-hour episode is followed by a new season of ''Ask This Old House,'' which will tackle viewer questions from Toronto; Los Angeles; Fargo, N.D.; and Wichita, Kan. 10:30 A.M. (13) RELIGION & ETHICS NEWSWEEKLY Kim Lawton reports on the relationship between the Tea Party and activists from the religious right, including tensions over how to approach social issues like abortion and gay marriage. Fred de Sam Lazaro looks at the efforts of the Friends of the Earth Middle East, an umbrella organization representing environmental nongovernmental groups in the region, to protect the endangered Jordan River, where Christian tourists and pilgrims come to retrace the footsteps of Jesus and be baptized. And Bob Abernethy leads a discussion on Snyder v. Phelps, the case currently before the United States Supreme Court about the rights of members of a small Baptist church in Kansas to picket military funerals to spread their message that God is punishing the United States for its tolerance of homosexuality by killing American troops. Protesters have carried signs that said, ''Thank God for dead soldiers'' and ''God hates you.''"

It's an exhibition: ''Diaghilev and the Golden Age of the Ballets Russes 1909-29'' at the Victoria and Albert Museum in London (through Jan. 9, 2011). Because among the many ways that Diaghilev transformed ballet was by persistently upgrading and modernizing its scenery and costumes, no dance company in history suits an exhibition better than his. You went to the Ballets Russes in Diaghilev's day not just to see the greatest dancers and choreography; you went to hear sensational new music (scores were commissioned from Debussy, Poulenc, Prokofiev, Ravel, Stravinsky and others) and to see dazzlingly imaginative works of visual art. His designers -- demonstrating different aspects and phases of artistic modernism -- included Bakst, Chanel, Derain, Goncharova, Larionov, Matisse and Picasso."

Founded in 2000 by Onok Bozkurt, a classical guitar player, the cafe encourages audience participation with open-mic events and workshops. Ferries for the Kadikoy neighborhood, near the cafe, leave from several city docks, and from there, a short walk will take you to the music hall, which is nestled among other cafes and restaurants on lively Sakizgulu Street."

The exhibit halls are typically watched over by the kind of matrons who wag their fingers when you get too close to a Kandinsky. Not so at the Garage Center for Contemporary Culture, one of Russia's first attempts to present modern art with a modern sensibility. At nearly 100,000 square feet, the Garage (19A Obraztsova Street; 7-495-645-0520; garageccc.com/eng) is housed in a former bus depot that was designed by the Constructivist architect Konstantin Melnikov in the 1920s. The project was spearheaded by Dasha Zhukova, a 29-year-old fashion editor and the girlfriend of one of Russia's richest men, Roman Abramovich. In the two years that it's been open, it's already managed to attract a host of major exhibitions."

2010-10-10T00:00:00Z,"ENGELMAYER--Ilene (Zelman), 79, of New York City and East Hampton, NY, died on October 7, 2010 of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. Born December 6, 1930 in Brooklyn, NY, she was a Phi Beta Kappa graduate of New York University, from which she later earned two masters degrees. After working initially in advertising (market research), she later became a dedicated teacher of remedial reading in the New York City public schools. She married Louis Engelmayer in 1955 and remained devoted to him through his death in 2000, and to their two children Paul Engelmayer and Jean Engelmayer Kalicki, their spouses Emily Mandelstam and Jan Kalicki, and her four grandchildren, Sasha and Peter Kalicki and Caroline and William Engelmayer. She was a loving daughter, devoted sister to her brothers Fred and Milton and their wives Celie and Helen, and a dedicated matriarch to an extended family of Zelman nieces and nephews and their children, for whom she hosted family Thanksgiving reunions for more than 45 years. She was a forceful intellectual with a playful sense of humor, and was an avid reader, a strong believer in civic participation, a gracious host and cook, and a proud celebrator of Jewish heritage. A memorial service will be held on Monday, October 11, 2010 at 10am at Riverside Memorial Chapel, 180 West 76th Street, New York City. The family will be sitting shiva at 300 Central Park West, Apt. 5B, on Monday, October 11, between 6:30pm and 10pm, and on Tuesday, October 12, between 4pm and 8pm. In lieu of flowers, the family suggests that donations in her memory be sent to the Jewish Museum of New York, Development Department, 1109 Fifth Avenue, New York, NY, 10128, in honor of Ilene Engelmayer. We will miss her kindness, wisdom, whimsical humor and abiding love."

2010-10-10T00:00:00Z,"Perched high on the eastern slopes of Paris, the 20th Arrondissement has historically been a spot for local residents, with an emphasis on raucous music and hard-left politics. The few tourists who do broach the district usually get no farther than the Père Lachaise cemetery. Plentiful graffiti and one or two watch-your-step side streets attest to the area's still-rough edges, but these are being smoothed over by growing clusters of dining and night life options. Much of the evening action trickles off the Rue de Ménilmontant, a jagged ribbon of a street that peers over the Pompidou Center and the Seine. The neighborhood anchor remains La Bellevilloise (labellevilloise.com), which opened a century ago as an artisan co-op, and today is a multi-room free-for-all of art, dance and dining. JEFF JOHN ROBERTS LA FAILLE96, rue Ménilmontant (33-1) 47-97-34-10 This new spot has attracted D.J.'sfrom across the city to spin in asmall lounge that serves up spe-cialty shooters (4 euros) and bot-tles of Champagne.

Billed as ''the world's first transversal style magazine,'' the ambisexual publication plays limbo with the markers of gender and high-fashion and is the brainchild of Luis Venegas, the Madrid-based publisher of the cult magazines Fanzine 137 and Electric Youth.

2010-10-10T00:00:00Z,"Think you've seen every Tintoretto canvas there is to see in Venice? Oddly, the church of Madonna dell'Orto, where the 16th-century artist is buried, is not on many visitors' itineraries. The church, which is not far from the house on the Fondamenta dei Mori where Tintoretto died in 1594, is in a largely untrodden section of the Venetian neighborhood of Cannaregio. Besides visiting Tintoretto's resting place in the chapel to the right of the main apse of the Madonna dell'Orto church, you can view some seldom-seen works, including the gargantuan ''Worship of the Golden Calf'' and ''Last Judgment,'' both of them in the presbytery. Another work, the lush ''Presentation of the Virgin in the Temple,'' is on the right aisle above the door to the sacristy. If you're in the mood for something more modern -- yet similarly undiscovered -- head over to the Fondazione Emilio and Annabianca Vedova, (fondazionevedova.org/en) at the waterfront esplanade in the Dorsoduro neighborhood. It features the work of one of Italy's most renowned 20th-century artists, Emilio Vedova, who died in 2006. The museum has two parts.

2010-10-10T00:00:00Z,"On Tuesday morning, the federal government revealed details of the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration's new 5-Star Safety Rating System and released new ratings for some of the most popular 2011 model-year vehicles. Of the 33 vehicles tested, only two received an overall rating of five stars, which is the best: the BMW 5 Series (4-door and rear-wheel-drive models) and the Hyundai Sonata built after July 2, 2010. David Strickland, the agency's administrator, said he thought this group of vehicles performed ''as expected.'' He added, ''A number did not do as well as in past years, but the tests are more severe. As a whole, we think the new standards are fair, and they represent the most significant risks in crashes that passengers and drivers face.''"
2010-10-10T00:00:00Z,"GUTOFF--Judyth, on Thursday, October 7, 2010, Judyth A. Gutoff, beloved wife, mother and sister, passed away after a brief illness. Her family and friends mourn the loss of a beautiful, vivacious and creative woman. Judyth was born on January 25, 1935 to Helen and Ernst Mayer, joining elder brother Donald. She grew up on Central Park West and attended Ethical Culture and Fieldston schools. In 1954 Judyth was the Ohio State University homecoming queen at the Rose Bowl in Pasadena. Judyth was married to Edward Bernstein. They were the parents of Lynn, Neal and Gail. The family lived in Westport, Connecticut for 23 years. In 1981 Judyth married Reuben Gutoff. Together they embarked on a 29-year romance. They traveled the American West, visiting national parks, rafting down the Missouri River on the Lewis & Clark Trail and heli-hiking in Banff Springs National Park. A dislocated hip or a helicopter rescue didn't slow her down a bit. The couple bicycled in Switzerland, Burgundy and Provence. They attended the Summer Olympic Games in Barcelona, Atlanta, Sydney, and Athens, and the Winter Olympic Games in Lake Placid, Calgary, Lillehammer, Salt Lake City and Turin. As tennis fans, they often made a June trip to Wimbledon, and were in the stands to witness classic moments such as the 1978 Borg-McEnroe match. Judyth was a natural athlete who excelled at tennis and skiing. She was a competitive ballroom dancer, winning national awards in her specialty, ""American Smooth"" tango, foxtrot, waltz and quickstep. She founded the Upper East Side exercise studio Judyth B, which she ran for 10 years. Judyth's interest in professional dance led her to support the non-profit organization Career Transition for Dancers. She loved the ballet, especially Swan Lake, and was able to negotiate about a four-to-one ratio of Knicks games to Lincoln Center performances. With her knack for craft and congenital inability to sit still, Judyth always had a project in hand. She was a talented calligrapher and an avid needlepointer, crafting intricate lions and abstract designs. A favorite pillow bore her motto, ""This mess is a place,"" a uniquely Judyth description of the state of her desk. Judyth also loved animals. Her beloved Chihuahas Stretch, Knickie and Tango traveled everywhere with Reuben and Judyth. She volunteered for The Animal Rescue Fund of the Hamptons. For 28 years, they celebrated their anniversary in Paris. Each year, the theme was ""Somewhere And Paris."" The ""somewheres"" included London, Milan and Amsterdam. Paris was always Paris. And theater was always on the bill, whether on Broadway or the West End. Judyth especially loved Stoppard and Sondheim, and could name the songs of most musicals. Reuben and Judyth accumulated a lifetime of travel memories, including five bookshelf feet of Playbills. Judyth is survived by her devoted husband of 28 years, her brother, Donald (Ylain), her children, Lynn (Greg), Neal (Margie) and Gail, her step-daughters Deborah (Jack) and Bija (Daniel) and her grandchildren Matthew Jones (Jamie), Kaylin Jones, Jenson Turner, Walker, Avery and Kendall Stevens, Peter and Alexander Gault, and Nadia Cannon (Sara). Judyth was a sparkly personality who lit up a room. She breezily undertook multiple simultaneous story lines in which enthusiasm trumped linear narrative. ""Wait a moment!..."" Donations in honor of Judyth may be made to the Anne Moore Breast Cancer Research Fund, Weill Cornell Medical Center, Box 123, New York City, 10021, or Career Transition for Dancers (careertransition.org). There will be a gathering for family and friends at the Jewish Community Center, 334 Amsterdam Avenue (76 Street), Tuesday October 12 from 3-6pm."

2010-10-10T00:00:00Z,"Before the Alexander McQueen show tonight, Sarah Burton said her main objective with the collection - her first since taking over as creative director - was to impart a strong sense of craft. She also used the word ''tender'' to describe the general feeling of the collection, which was based on a decaying nature. The narrow tailcoats and low-rise trousers certainly follow the McQueen silhouette. The prints and ribbon embroideries were consistent with the style of the last few years. Some of the more sculptural shapes recall his sense of theatre. And Ms. Burton used materials and references associated with him, like feathers, designs that appear to have partially disintegrated, and the hand-painted leather butterflies that clustered on dresses. Although many of the garments are much lighter in construction than they might appear in photographs, some of Ms. Burton's better efforts were conspicuously light and not necessarily embroidered or full of shape."

2010-10-10T00:00:00Z,"Francois Nars's makeup can be described as dramatic, but his limited-edition Bento Box lipstick set takes the concept literally. Inspired by a porcelain pot of lip stain used for kabuki actors that Nars found in Japan 10 years ago, the set of two cups of hand-poured color comes in a handsome wooden box with a wisteria-handled lip brush. ''I've always been fascinated with the concept of kabuki makeup,'' Nars says. ''It's about symbolism and using color to create drama.'' The lipstick application is as seductive as its presentation. ''You dip the brush into the cup, around the perimeter, to pick up product, and simply paint,'' he says. ''It's a beautiful process.'' Unless you want to look like a Japanese theater character, however, Nars recommends using a little restraint: ''It's highly pigmented, so I suggest starting out light and building for desired intensity. It seems intimidating, but the texture is creamy and light and will move easily.'' The set will be available for $125 beginning November 1 at Saks Fifth Avenue and Barneys New York, or go to narscosmetics.com/bento to pre-order.

But a comprehensive survey of one of Italy's greatest 16th-centuryartists, Agnolo Bronzino, is a once-in-a-lifetime affair, and to see it you'll have to travel to Florence, where ''Bronzino, Artist and Poet at the Court ofthe Medici'' appears through Jan. 23. Bronzino (1503-72) was court painter to Cosimo Ide'Medici, and a brilliant multitasker. His aristocratic portraiture, with its chilly hauteur and lacquered perfection, set a fashion for all of Europe, and some of the grandest will be assembled for this occasion.He was also a superlative religious painter, contributing work to Florence's most important churches. Many of those paintings are still in their original locations. And while the show is installed atthe Palazzo Strozzi, Florence itself will function as a kind of Bronzino museum, and a necessary stop on any European art tour. Similarly, Paris will be an extension of ''Mondrian in Paris: 1912-1938'' at the Pompi-dou Center from Dec. 1 to March 31. The Dutch painterspent most of his long careerthere, until World War II forced him to leave for London and then New York.

Wheaton provost from 1983 to 1998 (a period of great change, including its transition to co-education), she created the Filene Center for Work and Learning, a new approach to experiential learning that evolved from her earlier work at Antioch College where she served for 26 years as professor of history and later dean of the faculty. She and her late husband, Milton Goldberg, founded the Antioch Centre for British Studies. Hannah was born on January 28, 1933, in the Bronx, the daughter of Charles and Minnie Friedman. Her parents, both immigrants, met while taking English classes at night school. She grew up in a cooperative community built by the Amalgamated Clothing Workers one of three close-knit communities in which she was to spend her life. She was a member of the first coed class at the Bronx High School of Science and graduated magna cum laude and Phi Beta Kappa from Brandeis University and earned a doctorate from the Johns Hopkins University. Her scholarly interests included 18th and 19th-century British social and intellectual history. At Johns Hopkins she met Milton Goldberg, a literature professor. They married and moved to Yellow Springs, where both served on the Antioch faculty. Hannah had a great talent for making friends and inspiring their lifelong devotion. She entertained with gusto, enjoyed parties, poker games and world travel and was equally at home in animated discussions of politics, education, cooking or professional basketball.

2010-10-10T00:00:00Z,"Ron Darling won 136 major league games, including 99 for the Mets. He also started seven postseason games, including four in the Mets' 1986 championship season. Last year he wrote ''Complete Game,'' an inside look at pitching in the major leagues. Darling, 50, is an analyst for the Mets during the regular season, and he will be part of TBS's postseason coverage team with Ernie Johnson and John Smoltz for the American League division series between the Yankees and the Twins. He will also cover the A.L. Championship Series.Q.We seem to have really moved past the steroids era. Does it seem that even John McGraw would feel at home if the N.L.C.S. pits the Phillies, with Roy Halladay, Roy Oswalt and Cole Hamels, against the Giants, with Tim Lincecum, Matt Cain and Jonathan Sanchez?A.He certainly would. Never in the past few years have we seen two teams match up like those two with marquee starting pitching.Q.Does the great finish by San Francisco - who were written off in August then roared back in September - give them momentum the way it did with Colorado in 2007? Or does talent win out in the end? A.Talent is always important but if you're in the playoffs you certainly have talent. The emotional impact does count. San Francisco has got some magic in their bag right now. You could see it in Brian Wilson and Buster Posey's reactions; you could see it in the fans. The only way you can pull these things off is with contributions from all 25 guys, and these players believe in each other.Q.What team do you think will win it all?A.Philadelphia has the best team right now. They also have the advantage with the schedule the way the Yankees did last year. They call Halladay, Hamels and Oswalt H2O in Philadelphia and right now they have it lined up so H2O could start 17 of 19 postseason games. And Joe Blanton would start the other two, and he showed in 2008 that he could pitch under pressure.Q.What's your prediction for the American League?A.There's an interesting mix there. Both New York and Tampa are vulnerable. So this is the year for Minnesota or Texas to break through. Tampa and New York have known they were going to be in the postseason almost the entire time. But they are certainly not going into the playoffs as strongly as the Yankees did last year or Tampa did the year before. The Yankees' issue is starting pitching, and Tampa Bay's Achilles' heel is their starting pitching behind David Price. But the difference is that the Yankees can generate some kind of offense. Tampa Bay is a great athletic team - if you put them in a computer it would spit out a championship. But their offense is very sporadic.Q.You pitched on three days' rest in the 1986 World Series. How do you feel about teams starting their aces on three days' rest in the postseason?A.I think they should. C.C. Sabathia has already proven he certainly can do it. It's more a mental thing than a physical thing. And you feel more rejuvenated and more alive in October. I don't know if it's the cool weather or the adrenaline but I felt like I had more on my fastball then I did the whole month of September.Q.As a pitcher, did you prepare differently for postseason games than for regular-season ones?A.Physically you don't do anything differently - you follow your routine in getting to the ballpark, loosening, stretching. But what you want to do is get as quiet as you can - there are all these ticket requests for family and friends, and people coming in who want to meet you for brunch, and you don't want to do it but you don't want to be antisocial, but you have to find as much quiet time as possible. The energy needed to pitch in these games is so intense.Q.Is there any special preparation you need to make for the postseason as a broadcaster after announcing so many less-than-meaningful games for the Mets at the end of this season?A.I've been prepping since the All-Star break, following the teams that were in contention. If I saw Tim Lincecum threw seven scoreless innings I'd want to know more, to know how did he throw. So I might call [Giants announcer] Jon Miller or a reporter out there. But I've announced two Game 163 tie breakers the last two years, one in Chicago and one in Minnesota, and it's the closest an old guy like me can get to having goose bumps. When I announce games like that and postseason games I think, Boy, I wish I could still play. That looks like fun. And that translates into whatever enthusiasm I need for the job.Q.Commissioner Bud Selig recently said he'd like to consider adding another round of playoffs. What do you think of that?A.I don't like it. If you look at this season, you had a horrible race in the American League, where both New York and Tampa knew they were going to make the playoffs. And you had a great race in the National League with San Francisco, San Diego and Atlanta. With the new rules, you'd have two horrible races. This is the first generation with kids where everybody always gets a trophy. I don't think major league baseball needs to give everyone a trophy. Baseball is 162 games long. If you can't figure it out in that time, then maybe it's not going to happen. It's all right to not be in the playoffs. Maybe you don't belong in the playoffs. When you look at teams in the N.H.L. and N.B.A. that make it, many of them don't belong.Q.What happened to the Mets this year?A.In June they were 11 games up [over .500] and they were so good to watch. The fans were really enjoying the team. And then it went away. I don't quite know why. So this year seemed to some like an utter disaster. But in spring training, Gary Cohen, Keith Hernandez and I felt they were a .500 team. If you don't put them under the microscope where they play in this town and try to stay relevant compared to the Yankees, there were some successes."

Rome, meanwhile, will unveil the seventh edition of its international film festival, an event that, while not as venerable or controversial as the one in Venice, pays homage to the glories of Italian and global cinema, old and new (Oct. 28 to Nov. 5). But the cutting-edge festival is to be found in Thessaloniki, Greece, whose 51st festival runs from Dec. 3 to 12. Besides its main competition slate, the festival has programs devoted to new films from Greece and the Balkans, both sites of cinematic resurgence in recent years. A. O. SCOTT"

2010-10-10T00:00:00Z,"We're all used to hearing that everything we once thought was good for us is not. But even within that framework, the latest science about antioxidants, free radicals and exercise is telling. As many of us have heard, free radicals are molecules created by the breakdown of oxygen during metabolism. Each of us constantly creates free radicals simply by living and breathing. But these molecules are highly reactive and capricious, sometimes attacking other cells and damaging tissue. Wilding free radicals have been linked with a number of diseases and with aging. Exercise, because it requires increased oxygen consumption, also increases the production of free radicals. So, many experts began urging the fitness-minded to pop large doses of antioxidant vitamin supplements, like vitamins C and E, to counteract the presumed damaging effects of the free radicals. Food alone would not supply sufficient levels of the necessary antioxidants, it was thought. The exercising body needed help from vitamins. But then a few years ago, researchers from the University of Valencia in Spain and the University of Wisconsin in Madison set out to study what would happen if you tried to prevent exercising muscles from creating free radicals. They had laboratory rats run on small treadmills until they were exhausted. Some of the rats had been injected with a powerful, pharmaceutical-grade antioxidant that works in the body to halt the production of most free radicals. After the rats ran, the researchers measured the levels of a number of substances in their leg muscles. Not surprisingly, the injected rats showed almost no free-radical activity. They were virtually immune to what scientists had considered a kind of bodily damage."

Indeed, Young struck gold with this prime spot on rue Jean-Jacques Rousseau. ''It's big but well-proportioned,'' he says. ''There are rooms on the lower level where we've set up my atelier for special orders, our offices, a small lounge and my studio. It's perfect!'' Of course, not to be overlooked are Young's vertiginous, architecturally inspired chaussures and bottines, which jibe nicely with the 1930s- and '40s-inspired industrial decor. The new space will also provide a showcase for handbags, wallets and leather jackets in the new black - a preview of sorts for the larger accessories and ready-to-wear lines he plans to introduce next season."
2010-10-10T00:00:00Z,"To the Editor: Your article on litigation against mak-rs of antipsychotic drugs (''Side Effects May Include Lawsuits,'' Oct. 3) did not address the main reason for the high volume of prescriptions for them:they often help patients. Most doctors are not mendacious ornaïve. They sincerely want to help patients, and won't continue to recommend medicines that either don't workor incur significant side effects. Most research studies, no matter how accurateor manipulated, may convince a doctor to try a medicine, but they won't replaceclinical experience over time. And anyspeakers on behalf of a drug lose allcredibility if they proselytize unrealistically.I fear that the relationship between doctor and patient is threatened if open discussion of the uses of medications,even for so-called off-label administration, is curtailed. And I fear that themoney extracted from pharmaceutical companies will impact the resources dedicated to the development of moremedicines. JEROLD J. KREISMAN, M.D.St. Louis, Oct. 3 To the Editor: Much of the pharmaceutical mess began with the public advertising of prescription drugs, which encouraged the industry to change from a business model emphasizing efficacy to one emphasizing marketability. Marketing is a cakewalk compared with pharmacology, and it comes with a Pandora's box ofpotential abuses.Moreover, saturation advertising distorts the patient-physician relationshipby manipulating patient decision-making and mocking professional diagnostic expertise.Real health care reform, as opposed to health insurance reform, must in-clude reinstating a prohibition on the public marketing of prescription drugs.Let truly effective drugs sell themselves.

2010-10-10T00:00:00Z,"Chiefs (3-0) at Colts (2-2)Sunday, 1:00 p.m.Line: Colts by 7 1/2Peyton Manning could take the field with the cast of ''Modern Family'' and still produce a 12-win season. At least that's the perception. Indianapolis has lost two divisional games and all of its experienced safeties are injured, but there has been little hand-wringing about the team's playoff chances. So what if the rookie Brandon King and the off-the-street free agent DaJuan Morgan have replaced Bob Sanders and Melvin Bullitt in the secondary? As long as Julie Bowen and Eric Stonestreet aren't covering deep zones in the cover-2 and Manning isn't scaring those cute kids with his noisy audibles, everything will be just fine. It's too early to become enamored with undefeated Kansas City. Its run defense, running game and special teams have been outstanding, but Matt Cassel has thrown for just 494 yards in three games, and his wide receivers have combined for just 17 receptions, several of them screens. On the other hand, the schedule is the Chiefs' friend. After trips to Indianapolis and Houston, they will enjoy a homestand against Buffalo and Jacksonville, then a trip to Oakland in November, when the Raiders should be on their fourth or fifth quarterback. They will be at least 5-3 at that point. Then, somehow, their schedule gets even easier. You don't have to be a bandwagon jumper to see a wild-card berth in their future. Pick: Colts"

2010-10-10T00:00:00Z,"Pack your hiking boots: While Prague's spire-studded Old Town hosts most mainstream events, underground culture usually requires a trek. East of Old Town, the grungy Zizkov neighborhood has hills topped with cobblestone lanes and the odd nuclear bunker, as in the wondrous Bunkr Parukarka (parukarka.eu), on Parukarka hill. Built in the mid-1950s, the space -- or a small part of it -- functions as a club today. A 36-foot rock-climbing wall is circled by a long staircase as it descends to the shelter (each lead-lined bunker door weighs more than 10,000 pounds, according to the manager, Miki Tesinsky). Bands and D.J.'s play, and the walls are often used for temporary photo exhibitions. Architecture buffs will also have to take a trek to see some of the city's most distinctive buildings. While Gothic and Baroque are most visible in the historic center, the best examples of diamondlike Czech Cubism hide to the south. Take the subway's B line to Karlovo Namesti station and exit at Namesti Pod Emauzy, then walk south for 10 minutes along the Vltava riverbank. On the other side of the 1872-era railway bridge is the back view of Villa Kovarovic, built in 1913 by Josef Chochol, which displays the movement's characteristic hexagonal forms; directly to the north and south are buildings by Otakar Novotny and Emil Kralicek, respectively, according to the authoritative ''Prague 20th Century Architecture'' guidebook. Another five minutes south will take you to Chochol's ''triple house,'' a complex of three Cubist buildings facing the river; they are not open to the public."

2010-10-10T00:00:00Z,"PETERS--Anthony J. The former Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of Cushman & Wakefield, Inc., a real estate firm based in Manhattan, died on October 7, in Ft. Myers, FL. He was 94 and lived in Ft. Myers, FL. He was born in Portsmouth, NH, in 1916, one of seven children of Italian immigrants. The family moved to Brooklyn in 1921, and he attended James Madison High School. His older brother, Leone, had joined C&W in 1929, and Tony dropped out of high school to join him in 1933, becoming an office boy. During World War II, he spent three years in the Army Air Corps. He returned to C&W after the war and remained with the firm for more than 50 years. He and his brothers, Leone and Vincent, owned the majority of C&W until 1970, when they sold the firm to the RCA. He became President in 1971 and Chairman of the Board in 1976. The three brothers were the driving force of C&W after World War II, and they transformed the firm from a family-owned building management concern into the nation's leading, full-service real estate organization. The brothers were involved in many large and complex real estate transaction in Manhattan and throughout the U.S. Tony was the most active broker in Lower Manhattan's financial district throughout the 1950's, 1960's, and 1970's, and one of the most successful real estate brokers anywhere in the world. In the 1950's, when just about everyone was writing off Wall Street as dead, Tony convinced the New York Stock Exchange to lease land at 20 Broad Street to a developer who constructed the first office building in Lower Manhattan since the Great Depression. In 1959, he won the Real Estate Board of New York' ""most ingenious deal"" award for the transaction. He won the award again, in 1960, for a transaction involving 60 Broad Street. The success of 20 Broad Street broke the ice for the surge of construction in the financial district that followed, convincing Chase Manhattan Bank in 1960 to resist the trend of other banks moving uptown and build it's 60-story headquarters in the heart of the financial district. In 1967, Peters represented financial institutions in Lower Manhattan in leasing 3.3 million square feet in a single year -- a record still not broken -- including two of the largest leasing deals ever made in Manhattan. At the time, those two leases were easily the highest dollar commitments ever made by a business for office space in Manhattan. Tony's tremendous success in the financial district earned him the nickname ""Mr. Downtown."" Tony was instrumental in expanding C&W nationally and he played a role in developing more than 50-million square feet of office space in the U.S., including Chicago's Sears Tower, San Francisco's Bank of America Center, and New York's 9 West 57th Street. He was the owner of Interlaken Inn and the Woodland Restaurant and the developer of Interlaken Estates in Lakeville, CT, and, after retirement, he developed ""The Carlton"" in Boca Raton, FL, ""The Pierre"" in Longboat Key, FL, and ""Lion's Head"" in Salisbury, CT. Tony was a gregarious lover of life, the New York Yankees, travel to Ireland and Italy, crossword puzzles, cooking and baking. He was an inveterate shopper and a lover of gizmos, electronic gadgets and new cars. He was long active in many community and charitable causes, including the Board of Education of Glen Cove, New York; the Board of Regents of Marymount International Schools; the Board of Governors of the Marymount School in New York City; the Cardinal Cooke Guild; Cardinal Cooke's Committee of the Laity in New York City; the Cardinal Cooke Advisory Committee and he was always active in parish activities, wherever he lived. He is survived by his loving wife, Irene Peters; eight children and spouses: John Peters and Julia Belkin, Robert Peters, Carol Peters, Elizabeth Peters Mastopietro, Kathy Peters and Stuart Berman, Patricia and John Cavanagh, Anthony J. Peters, Jr., and Mary Ann and Vincent Giffuni; one brother, Vincent J. Peters; eight grandchildren: Carly Berman, Jeffrey Cavanagh, Matthew Giffuni, Max Peters, Romi Peters, Sara Joseph, Sascha Peters and Sharon Cavanagh, and four great-grandchildren: Emily, Greta, Preston and Wade. He is predeceased by his first wife, Mary V. Peters; his second wife, Marie Kelly Peters; and his grandson, Brian Cavanagh. In lieu of flowers, the family would appreciate contributions to The Cardinal Cooke Guild, 1011 First Avenue, New York, NY 10022 or to a charity of your choice.

2010-10-10T00:00:00Z,"HORN--Christian F.,Ph.D. Dr. Horn died October 2, 2010 after a prolonged and challenging battle against Parkinson's disease. He was 82 and is survived by his wife of 57 years Christa W. Horn, daughter Sabrina and granddaughters Grace and Christina. He was a man of many great accomplishments both personal and professional. He beat all the odds in WWII as a 17-year-old soldier training to be a paratrooper. His soon to be wife survived the fire bombings of Dresden in her house. With his wife, Dr. Horn was one of only a few German research chemists hired by Union Carbide after WWII. With a Ph.D. in chemical engineering, he earned 48 U.S. patents in polymer fabric technology, including the formula for Lycra, which was later sold to DuPont. He also invented the ability to colorize polyester. Later, he started Polymer Technology, a consulting company based in New York City. He and his family lived in Frankfurt, Germany for two years when he was asked to be acting president of Zimmer, A.G., and then returned to the U.S. to start Chrislon Corporation, his own company that was a polymer fiber extrusion plant in the Carolinas. The rest of his career was spent at W.R. Grace and Co. where he served on its Board of Directors and ran Research and Development, bringing the company into many new businesses. He was featured on the cover of Chemical Week for all of his contributions to the industry. And at the age of 50, he taught himself the venture capital business, got some investment capital and moved to California. He invested in and saved countless companies, created new markets where there were none, and created 1000s of jobs. He was a generous man, loving husband and a tough father. He rewarded those who never asked for any favors, and was tough on those that did. He did not suffer fools gladly, and he truly ""ran the show"" everywhere, all the time, and with every one. He taught us to never give up if you really believe in something. He was always intellectually curious and beat the odds again when he developed his own vitamin/herbal regimen to treat his prostate cancer. This research was documented by Johns Hopkins University. When he was diagnosed with Parkinson's disease at the age of 72, he began an all out fight against his ultimate prognosis. He studied and researched, and tried every form of treatment available to him at the time. He beat everyone's odds for enduring hospice for eight months. In the end, he is still beating the odds, because he is watching over us now, and because he has a family that loves him forever and will never forget him.

But food is what has always brought us together -- for sustenance as well as for conversation. In the last decade, the movement toward buying locally has, perhaps inadvertently, resulted in the creation of new communities. Conversations are started when people ask questions of the men and women who grow, make, cook and serve their food, as they are when they seek out others with similar tastes. One result is a multitude of new -- and often surprising -- connections. Strangers are chipping in to buy a whole steer together. Orthodox Jews are eating wood-fired pizza next to West Indians and hipsters. Graphic designers are trying to revive an impoverished county with an all-butter crust. In one city, 100,000 people have converged to eat street food and learn how to butcher, pickle, home-roast coffee and brew beer. In this, our third annual food issue, the hunger to connect is stronger than ever."

Built in their place were several crisp apartment blocks by I. M. Pei and a pair of angular brick theaters by the Chicago architect Harry Weese, who later designed Washington's Metro stations."

2010-10-10T00:00:00Z,"A half-century ago, Jean-Pierre Rosnay started the Club des Poètes, a brasserie in the Seventh Arrondissement that features poetry readings every Tuesday, Friday and Saturday evenings. Now watched over by his widow, Marcelle, and son, Blaise, whose own small son often flits through the room, the club, at 30, rue de Bourgogne (poesie.net), is an intimate alternative to more expensive -- and more mainstream -- entertainments. A recent night featured readings by Marcelle and Blaise Rosnay of poems by Jean-Pierre Rosnay, Blaise Cendrars and Antonio Machado. About 30 people listened attentively, including some exchange students from Columbia University, who'd been told by a professor to drop in for a dip into a kind of Left Bank cafe life that still forms part of the spine of gilded Paris. Some nights are themed -- poems by Samuel Beckett, for instance, or poems of the Resistance, which Mr. Rosnay, who died late last year, had participated in, having been arrested by Klaus Barbie and then escaped. Pablo Neruda, Octavio Paz and Louis Aragon are among past visitors. The readings are dramatic, especially those by Blaise Rosnay, and the red wine from the Côtes de Blaye is good and inexpensive. Another unusual spot is the Musée Henner (musee-henner.fr), a small museum in a lovely Second Empire house in the 17th Arrondissement (pictured), devoted to the work of Jean-Jacques Henner, an Alsatian painter (1829-1905) who was important in his time. The museum, which dates from 1924, has been restored to its original décor, including Delft tiles and lattice screens from North Africa."

2010-10-10T00:00:00Z,"The short, bearded man in the tutu wanders onstage, an accordion strapped to his back like a rucksack. A tall dancer feigns clumsiness with a slyly graceful gawkiness that would do Buster Keaton proud, stumbling around a ladder and a chair to the delight of the audience. Sasha Waltz & Guests (pictured), named for its choreographer, is the house dance ensemble at Radialsystem V (Holzmarktstr, 33; radialsystem.de), a performance space that opened in 2006 in an old brick Gothic pumping station on the Spree River in Berlin. Even though Berliners know about the dance troupe, visitors often miss its frequently sold-out performances in the towering space of the former machine hall and boiler room of the pumping station. Radialsystem V, miles away from the German capital's grand boulevard of Unter den Linden, is surrounded by a cluster of gritty nightclubs near the Ostbahnhof train station. During warmer months, a casual passer-by without a ticket to the night's performance can enjoy a cappuccino with the dance aficionados on the waterfront terrace, but the main draw is the celebrated Ms. Waltz and her dancers, interlocked in twisted, shifting embraces."

Born December 6, 1930 in Brooklyn, NY, she was a Phi Beta Kappa graduate of New York University, from which she later earned two masters degrees. After working initially in advertising (market research), she later became a dedicated teacher of remedial reading in the New York City public schools. She married Louis Engelmayer in 1955 and remained devoted to him through his death in 2000, and to their two children Paul Engelmayer and Jean Engelmayer Kalicki, their spouses Emily Mandelstam and Jan Kalicki, and her four grandchildren, Sasha and Peter Kalicki and Caroline and William Engelmayer. She was a loving daughter, devoted sister to her brothers Fred and Milton and their wives Celie and Helen, and a dedicated matriarch to an extended family of Zelman nieces and nephews and their children, for whom she hosted family Thanksgiving reunions for more than 45 years. She was a forceful intellectual with a playful sense of humor, and was an avid reader, a strong believer in civic participation, a gracious host and cook, and a proud celebrator of Jewish heritage. A memorial service will be held on Monday, October 11, 2010 at 10am at Riverside Memorial Chapel, 180 West 76th Street, New York City.

2010-10-11T00:00:00Z,"GUTOFF--Judyth, on Thursday, October 7, 2010, Judyth A. Gutoff, beloved wife, mother and sister, passed away after a brief illness. Her family and friends mourn the loss of a beautiful, vivacious and creative woman. Judyth was born on January 25, 1935 to Helen and Ernst Mayer, joining elder brother Donald. She grew up on Central Park West and attended Ethical Culture and Fieldston schools. In 1954 Judyth was the Ohio State University homecoming queen at the Rose Bowl in Pasadena. Judyth was married to Edward Bernstein. They were the parents of Lynn, Neal and Gail. The family lived in Westport, Connecticut for 23 years. In 1981 Judyth married Reuben Gutoff. Together they embarked on a 29-year romance. They traveled the American West, visiting national parks, rafting down the Missouri River on the Lewis & Clark Trail and heli-hiking in Banff Springs National Park. A dislocated hip or a helicopter rescue didn't slow her down a bit. The couple bicycled in Switzerland, Burgundy and Provence. They attended the Summer Olympic Games in Barcelona, Atlanta, Sydney, and Athens, and the Winter Olympic Games in Lake Placid, Calgary, Lillehammer, Salt Lake City and Turin. As tennis fans, they often made a June trip to Wimbledon, and were in the stands to witness classic moments such as the 1978 Borg-McEnroe match. Judyth was a natural athlete who excelled at tennis and skiing. She was a competitive ballroom dancer, winning national awards in her specialty, ""American Smooth"" tango, foxtrot, waltz and quickstep. She founded the Upper East Side exercise studio Judyth B, which she ran for 10 years. Judyth's interest in professional dance led her to support the non-profit organization Career Transition for Dancers. She loved the ballet, especially Swan Lake, and was able to negotiate about a four-to-one ratio of Knicks games to Lincoln Center performances. With her knack for craft and congenital inability to sit still, Judyth always had a project in hand. She was a talented calligrapher and an avid needlepointer, crafting intricate lions and abstract designs. A favorite pillow bore her motto, ""This mess is a place,"" a uniquely Judyth description of the state of her desk. Judyth also loved animals. Her beloved Chihuahas Stretch, Knickie and Tango traveled everywhere with Reuben and Judyth. She volunteered for The Animal Rescue Fund of the Hamptons. For 28 years, they celebrated their anniversary in Paris. Each year, the theme was ""Somewhere And Paris."" The ""somewheres"" included London, Milan and Amsterdam. Paris was always Paris. And theater was always on the bill, whether on Broadway or the West End. Judyth especially loved Stoppard and Sondheim, and could name the songs of most musicals. Reuben and Judyth accumulated a lifetime of travel memories, including five bookshelf feet of Playbills. Judyth is survived by her devoted husband of 28 years, her brother, Donald (Ylain), her children, Lynn (Greg), Neal (Margie) and Gail, her step-daughters Deborah (Jack) and Bija (Daniel) and her grandchildren Matthew Jones (Jamie), Kaylin Jones, Jenson Turner, Walker, Avery and Kendall Stevens, Peter and Alexander Gault, and Nadia Cannon (Sara). Judyth was a sparkly personality who lit up a room. She breezily undertook multiple simultaneous story lines in which enthusiasm trumped linear narrative. ""Wait a moment!..."" Donations in honor of Judyth may be made to the Anne Moore Breast Cancer Research Fund, Weill Cornell Medical Center, Box 123, New York City, 10021, or Career Transition for Dancers (careertransition.org). There will be a gathering for family and friends at the Jewish Community Center, 334 Amsterdam Avenue (76 Street), Tuesday October 12 from 3-6pm."

2010-10-12T14:07:24Z,"Louise Bourgeois was reportedly a notorious hoarder. The artist, who died this year at the age of 98, accumulated all manner of tablecloths, napkins, clothing and bed linens - a lifetime's worth of material, really - which she began to cut up and reassemble into ""drawings"" in the mid-1990s. Her Collyer Brothers tendencies aside, Bourgeois no doubt found precarious comfort in the nest of this critical mass; she grew up surrounded by textiles in her parents' tapestry restoration workshop, and the act of sewing, she said, was her attempt to keep things together and make them whole. In this context, the more than 70 pieces in ""Louise Bourgeois: The Fabric Works,"" an exhibition that aptly christens Hauser & Wirth's new space on Savile Row in London, are as poignant as they are vibrant. But taken purely at face value, these pieces make one lament the fact that Bourgeois never moonlighted as a textile designer."

Walter was a jeweler by trade and even after retirement could be seen pulling out his loop on 47th Street to examine a diamond or pearl for flaws to help a friend. He was a non-judgmental person, rarely noticing people's differences, interacting with all folks in the same manner whether they were intellectuals, janitors, celebrities, drag queens or the man selling fruit on the corner. He was a good guy and a piece of work. Walter loved to: wear bowties, fish for bluefish that he barely ever caught on Martha's Vineyard, sneak Mallomars while driving home from work, wear ill-fitting blue jeans with suspenders and his orthopedic shoes, travel an hour to the Upper West side by bus with his trusty leopard schlep-cart from his home in Greenwich Village to save ten cents on a quart of orange juice, and secretly slip a few twenties into his grandkids' pockets every time he saw them. Walter was a sweet, kind and generous man who told his wife he loved her more than once a day for almost 60 years and kept his family and friends in stitches with his eccentricities. He was unique to this world and will be missed terribly by all who were lucky enough to know and love him.

From her debut here in the title role of ""Lucia di Lammermoor"" in 1961, audiences were immediately mesmerized by her brilliant vocalism. Her voice was of a type rarely heard: a full dramatic soprano with amazing flexibility and an astonishing upper range, which enabled her to sing both Bellini's ""Norma"" and Donizetti's ""La Fille du Regiment."" In all, she sang 223 performances at the Met, many of them in works staged especially for her, including Bellini's ""La Sonnambula"" and ""I Puritani"" and the company premiere of Massenet's ""Esclarmonde."" Backstage at the Met, she was known for her rapier wit and collegiality, which made her an admired and well-liked performer.

2010-10-12T00:00:00Z,"A fundamentalist Muslim party in Malaysia is demanding the cancellation of a concert by the pop-rock star Adam Lambert planned for Thursday, saying the singer and his show will promote ''gay culture,'' Reuters reported. Mr. Lambert, an ''American Idol'' runner-up who is openly gay, and who is scheduled to perform at the Putra Indoor Stadium in Bukit Jalil, near Kuala Lumpur, has met with opposition from the Pan Malaysian Islamic Party, which is that nation's second-largest political party. Nasrudin Hasan, a youth leader for the party, was quoted by Reuters as saying that Mr. Lambert's shows ''are outrageous, with lewd dancing and a gay performance that includes kissing male dancers,'' which is ''not good for people in our country.'' The party, which has previously protested shows by artists like Beyonce, Rihanna and Mariah Carey, also said it would send ''many of its members and supporters'' to proselytize at the concert if it went forward. A representative for Malaysia's arts, culture and heritage department said Mr. Lambert had agreed to abide by performance guidelines, which include not removing his clothing and maintaining a distance of about 25 feet between his stage and the audience.

The answer, my friends, may be contained within an unusual piece of Bob Dylan memorabilia that has been posted for sale on Craigslist: the building that was once the synagogue where the singer-songwriter had his bar mitzvah. The Duluth News Tribune reported that the structure at 2320 West Second Street in Hibbing, Minn., which was formerly the Agudath Achim Synagogue where the young Robert Zimmerman was first called to read the Torah in 1954, was put on sale a few months ago by its owners. (They have since turned to Dylan fan sites and the news media in hopes of finding a buyer.) Despite its place in history, the building has not been used as a synagogue since the 1980s; Brenda Shafer-Pellinen told The News Tribune that she and her husband, Eric, bought it in 2001 with plans to turn it into a bed and breakfast. They're now asking $119,000 for the building, which could serve as a single-family home or duplex, or possibly the ultimate gift for the Dylan fan who has everything. ''People who like Dylan love Dylan,'' Ms. Shafer-Pellinen said. ''They have an unusual level of devotion to his music - more so than other musical groups or artists.''"

So in 1995, when ''Frere et Soeur,'' an 1887 canvas of a young girl carrying her baby brother, came up for sale at a Christie's auction in New York, she bought it for $178,500. It wasn't all she purchased at that sale. Ms. Moore also snapped up a painting by the Belgian artist Alfred Stevens, from 1883, called ''Mere et Ses Enfants,'' for $200,500. Now Ms. Moore is selling both paintings at a Sotheby's sale of 19th-century European art in New York on Nov. 4.

Al Jean, an executive producer and the longtime show runner of ''The Simpsons,'' pulled back another layer of the curtain and explained the stunt to ArtsBeat on Monday afternoon.Q.How did you find Banksy to do this, and now that it's done, how much trouble are you in?A.Well, I haven't been fired yet, so that's a good sign. I saw the film Banksy directed, ''Exit Through the Gift Shop,'' and I thought, oh, we should see if he would do a main title for the show, a couch gag. So I asked Bonnie Pietila, our casting director, if she could locate him, because she had previously located people like Thomas Pynchon. And she did it through the producers of that film. We didn't have any agenda. We said, ''We'd like to see if you would do a couch gag.'' So he sent back boards for pretty much what you saw. Q.Were you concerned that what he sent you could get the show into hot water?A.I'd be lying if I said I didn't think about it for a little bit. Certainly, Fox has been very gracious about us biting the hand that feeds us, but I showed it to Matt Groening, and he said, no, we should go for it and try to do it pretty much as close as we can to his original intention. So we did. Like we always do, every show is submitted to broadcast standards, and they had a couple of [changes] which I agreed with, for taste. But 95 percent of it is just the way he wanted.Q.Can you say what got cut out?A.I'll just say, it was even a little sadder. But I would have to say almost all of it stayed in. We were thrilled. It was funny, I watched ''Mad Men'' last night and I wondered if this was my Don Draper letter to The New York Times. I knew just how he felt. But it was great to have a secret.Q.One of the things Banksy is known for is disguising his identity. How can you be sure that you were dealing with the real him?A.The original boards that we got from him were in his style and were certainly by an extremely proficient artist. We were dealing with the person that represented him making the movie. I haven't met him, I don't even know what he looks like, except what the Internet suggests. And he's taken credit for it now so I'm pretty sure it's him. We went through the people that made the movie so I assume they would know how to get to the real him.Q.Even compared to how ''The Simpsons'' has mocked Fox in the past, this seemed to push things to a different level. Are you sure there's no one higher up than you on the corporate ladder who's displeased with this?A.I think that we should always be able to say the holes in our DVDs are poked by unhappy unicorns.Q.Has Banksy's criticism made you reconsider any of the ways you do things at ''The Simpsons'' in terms of producing the show or its merchandise?A.I have to say, it's very fanciful, far-fetched. None of the things he depicts are true. That statement should be self-evident, but I will emphatically state it.Q.A lot of the show's animation is produced in South Korea, but not under those conditions.A.No, absolutely not.Q.And even that closing shot of the 20th Century Fox logo surrounded in barbed wire?A.Approved by them. Obviously, the animation to do this was pricey. I couldn't have just snuck it by Fox. I'll just say it's a place where edgy comedy can really thrive, as long as it's funny, which I think this was. None of it's personal. This is what made ''The Simpsons'' what it is. This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print."

In spite of the depth of the attachment that I feel to the city in which I have built my career, I am always aware that Milan does have its shortcomings and that it lies at times in thrall to a prevailing mood of melancholy, which has perhaps altered its character and diminished its sense of optimism, its capacity to think big and retain the confidence to accomplish its ambitions. As the Italian capital of financial activity and the world capital of fashion, design and opera, Milan derives its unique strength, I believe, from its capacity to promote a continuous flow of creative ideas and harness them into successful commercial ventures. I love this city most when its sense of discipline is evident, expressed through its citizens' work ethic and ability to plan on a large scale. I also love its rational approach - one driven by passion and generosity. (It's no coincidence that Milan is the center of the nation's charitable sector.) I hope that the optimism and the characteristic determination of the Milanese will provide a much-needed stimulus to the public sector, because the greater one's love for a city, the more one expects from it. From this perspective, Expo 2015 could be the turning point, the opportunity to boost Milan's prestige and provide the perfect arena to reassert our claim to greatness."
