The group, according to one member, ''just decided to quit while we were still having a good time.'' Formerly art students, the band members now hold odd jobs; the lead singer, a dynamo on stage, works in a copying shop. ''But I never planned on being a musician, so it's no big loss in my life,'' she said. Bear in mind that Pylon, having played several shows with U2 and begun to get some big-city bookings, stood on the verge of stardom while throwing in the towel. In Athens, Ga., which is the subject of Tony Gayton's bright, scrappy new documentary, this kind of attitude makes more sense than it might in other places. The musicians who are interviewed and perform in concert sequences display a uniformly easygoing attitude toward mainstream success. Some of them have made it (like the B-52's, senior statesmen of the Athens scene, and R.E.M.), and some have little chance. But they all share an appreciation for the friendly and comforting cultural atmosphere of Athens, and for the energy and eccentricity that have put the place on the map."
