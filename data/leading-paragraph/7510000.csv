2011-06-16T00:00:00Z,"9 P.M. (13) BOXING GYM (2010) ''For some a gym is a home, a refuge, a safe place to escape to from the turbulence of the streets, a place where parents bring troubled children,'' Richard Lord, a former professional fighter, says of the establishment he founded 20 years ago in Austin, Tex. ''A gym is also a one-room schoolhouse where the teacher, a trainer or coach, teaches on a one-to-one basis.'' This latest documentary from Frederick Wiseman observes Lord's Gym, where age, race, sex, ethnicity and social class blur in the pursuit of the sport of boxing; where some students seek to become professionals, others are satisfied to remain amateurs, and all hope to fulfill a dream. ''You notice the women in the documentary right away (at least I enviously did), partly because of their coiled strength and confidence,'' Manohla Dargis wrote in The New York Times. ''But you also notice that none of the men seem to be checking them out. Boxing is a gravely serious business at Lord's, where everything looks battered, not just some of the faces.'' Of Mr. Wiseman's filmmaking, she said, ''This kind of fly-on-the-wall style of documentary can create a sense that you're watching the unmediated truth, a fantasy belied by every camera position and each edit.'' Ms. Dargis added: ''He might be quieter than Michael Moore (literally and cinematically), who throws everything (found footage, interviews, himself) at the screen, but Mr. Wiseman says plenty in his work.'' At 10:30, ''New York Fight Clubs'' looks back at the city's once-popular pastime. 7 P.M. (Showtime) COLOR ME KUBRICK (2005) John Malkovich, below, plays Alan Conway, a real-life British con man who hustled his way across England by impersonating the reclusive filmmaker Stanley Kubrick. Gay and an alcoholic, Conway, who died in 1998 (three months before Kubrick himself), would try to seduce young men with the promise of work on forthcoming projects. But he wasn't always careful in his research, and his knowledge of Kubrick's films was so spotty that he was unmasked more than once and forced to flee. He crossed paths in London with Frank Rich, then the chief theater critic of The New York Times, who encountered Conway, posing as Kubrick, in a restaurant. When Mr. Rich looked further into the man's identity, he discovered the ruse and in 1993 wrote a column about it. Directed by Brian Cook, who was an assistant director on the Kubrick films ''The Shining,'' ''Barry Lyndon'' and ''Eyes Wide Shut,'' and written by Anthony Frewin, who was Kubrick's personal assistant, ''this arch, episodic movie is really an affectionate sequence of in-jokes conceived as a posthumous homage to Kubrick by two knowing insiders,'' Stephen Holden wrote in The New York Times. ''The sharpest satire is reserved for the fools who swallow an act that seems transparently fake. Anyone who has watched a TV star besieged by gawking and drooling fans knows what encounters with fame can do in a culture of blind celebrity worship.''"

And there's Margaretha de Geer, his wife, next to him, looking through those pale brown eyes as if into some abyss. I imagine that Jacob used to be the sort of vain young man accustomed to getting lots of attention. But Margaretha's the one I always focus on. I note how her head perches improbably above that elaborate ruff collar, like a raisin on top of one of those inflatable airplane neck pillows, which even at the time the picture was painted, in 1661, was already decades out of fashion. Swallowed inside her chair, she clutches a huge white handkerchief. It always looks to me as if she were holding a dead ferret."

2011-06-16T00:00:00Z,"Earlier this month, as the prospect of a shortened N.F.L. season loomed, so did the pessimism about the state of labor negotiations as owners and players awaited a critical court ruling in their fight over how to divide billions of dollars. More recently, people briefed on the state of negotiations have noted real progress, along with an optimistic whisper that a deal might be completed sooner than expected, perhaps by July 4. The sides met again Wednesday in Maryland, and one person briefed on the negotiations described both parties as having their respective ''noses to the grindstone.'' The parties are discussing a deal that could run 8 to 10 years, and the crux of the negotiations remains what percentage of revenue should go to the players and how players might share in an anticipated boost in television revenue -- the largest chunk of the roughly $9 billion a year the N.F.L. generates -- when new network contracts are negotiated later this decade. When all owners convene for a meeting in Chicago next Tuesday, the N.F.L. would like to give them as much information as possible, in broad strokes, about the framework for a deal. Still, a vote to ratify a final agreement in Chicago remains unlikely, as does the idea of an agreement in principle. The meeting will more likely aim to update the owners on where the league stands with players and get clubs comfortable with how a deal may look. ''I'm cautiously optimistic,'' said Jay Feely, the player representative in Arizona. ''Any time there are negotiations and meetings, it's better than anything happening in the courts.'' The league would like the deal finished around July 4. That date would allow for several weeks of free agency so teams could sort out their rosters in time for training camps in late July.

On Wednesday, HarperCollins Children's Books said an application would be released for Apple iPad, iPhone and iPod Touch devices based on Mr. Yankovic's best-selling children's book, ''When I Grow Up.'' The original book, written by Mr. Yankovic (who, in a rare career move, did not declare himself to be ''Weird'' on its cover) and illustrated by Wes Hargis, follows an 8-year-old boy named Billy as he considers grown-up career options, such as becoming a doctor, firefighter, giraffe milker or snail trainer. The ''When I Grow Up'' app, which is developed by the Web design company Bean Creative, offers interactive games and features based on the book, including the option to have Mr. Yankovic read it to you, and opportunities to practice some of Billy's more fanciful future occupations, such as shaving a tarantula or massaging a gorilla. Mr. Yankovic said in a statement that when he was a child, ''I dreamed of one day helping to produce a cross-platform app that would be sold in the iTunes Store.'' He added: ''I was a very prescient kid.'' The ''When I Grow Up'' app will cost $2.99 for download. For slightly older listeners (who still think like children), Mr. Yankovic's new album ''Alpocalypse'' will be released on Tuesday."

2011-06-16T00:00:00Z,"Adele returned to the top of the Billboard album chart this week, supplanting Lady Gaga after two weeks. But the biggest news is what's at No. 3: the cast recording of the Broadway show ''The Book of Mormon.'' According to Billboard it is the highest-charting Broadway album since 1969, when ''Hair'' was No. 1 for 13 weeks. ''The Book of Mormon'' sold 61,000 copies last week, according to Nielsen SoundScan. It was surely helped by hype for the Tony Awards on Sunday, where it won nine prizes. (Sales for ''The Book of Mormon'' album were so low the week before that it did not make the Billboard 200, the magazine's standard album chart.) But there's a slight catch to the success. Like Lady Gaga's ''Born This Way'' two weeks ago, ''The Book of Mormon'' benefited from a huge markdown by Amazon, which sold the digital version of the album for $1.99 for the four days leading up to the Tonys. As a result, 85 percent of the sales were digital downloads, a much higher ratio than usual. Also on this week's album chart, Adele's ''21'' sold 114,000 copies, bringing it to No. 1, and Lady Gaga's ''Born This Way'' fell to No. 2 with 100,000 sales. The rapper Tech N9ne opened at No. 4 with 56,000 sales of his album ''All 6's & 7's'' (Strange Music), and Ronnie Dunn, of the country duo Brooks & Dunn, bowed at No. 5 with 45,000 sales of his self-titled debut album, released by Arista Nashville. -Album sales so far this year have been holding steady. The tally as of Sunday was 136.9 million, up about half a percent from last year's sales to the same point (136.2 million). That may be a minuscule increase, but it is the third week in a row that weekly album sales have improved year over year, and for an industry accustomed to negative numbers, it's good news."

Crew, in a new collaboration with Nike, is releasing three sneakers that Mr. Bowerman, also a legendary track coach, designed in the early '70s. Its Nike Vintage Collection includes replicas of the Waffle Racer; the Tennis Classic AC, a shoe originally designed for clay courts and now available with custom-colored accents; and the Cortez, the first shoe to feature the Nike swoosh and a full-length mid-sole, which changed the approach to comfort and shock absorption, now with throwback touches like '70s-grade nylon.

2011-06-16T00:00:00Z,"LEVINE--David L.,died peacefully on June 14, 2011 at UniHealth Post-Acute Care - Athens Heritage in Athens, Georgia, at the age of 91. He was a proud graduate of DeWitt Clinton High School, Bronx, NY, winner of the New York Times Essay Contest on the United States Constitution in 1937, and graduated from the City College of New York in 1941. David received his Masters of Social Work from the University of Pennsylvania in 1943 and in 1953 his Doctorate in Social Work from the University of Minnesota. He then began his academic career at Florida State University (1953-1967), followed by two years as the Associate Dean of the School of Social Work at the University of Syracuse (1967-1969), and then as Professor at the University of Georgia School of Social Work (1969-1994). David was active in each community in which he lived and served on the Board of Directors of the mental health centers in Leon County, Florida, and Athens-Clarke County, Georgia. He was an appointee to the Georgia Council on Aging, the advisory body to the state on aging issues, from 1987 until the time of his death. He was a founding board member of the Athens Community Council on Aging and was named Honorary Director, a lifetime position, in 2000. He was proclaimed the Distinguished Older Georgian for 2009 by resolutions of the Georgia General Assembly and the Georgia State Senate. He was named Georgia Champion for Aging by the Southeastern Association of Area Agencies on Aging in 2010. He participated in the White House Conference on Aging for three decades and received countless awards from various professional groups reflecting his tireless commitment to advocacy for those who could not advocate for themselves. David was an educator and a social worker, but he thought of himself as a social work educator. Hundreds of his former students throughout the country and particularly in the Southeast passionately carry on his legacy. He was an active and dedicated member of the National Association of Social Workers and was serving on the Georgia NASW Ethics Committee at his death. David was pre-deceased by his wife Laura (nee Kaplan) in 2006 and is survived by his daughters Deborah L Davis of Philadelphia, PA and her spouse Tad and their children Sarah and Ben; Elizabeth Levine of Decatur, GA and her partner Ann Baker; Helen Levine of St. Petersburg, FL and her spouse Katee Tully; and his son Edwin, of Athens, GA and his partner Mary Anne McGuire; and long-time family friends Dottie Pettes and Charlon Seegar. A memorial service will be held on Sunday, June 26, 2011 at 2:30pm at Congregation Children of Israel, 115 Dudley Drive, Athens, GA 30606. In lieu of flowers the family asks that donations be made to the Athens Community Council on Aging, 135 Hoyt Street, Athens, GA 30601, or the charity of your choice.

On first glance, PS Vita (the short name) looks like a wide-body version PSP, with a bright (OLED), large (5-inch) touch screen. The familiar analog sticks and shoulder triggers work as expected. But when you mix in not one, but two multitouch surfaces (on the front and the back), six-axis motion sensing for lifting or tilting, front/back cameras for things social, gaming or augmented reality and a microphone, you have lot of controls to tame. In other words, this thing can be tricky."

The Washington revival of ''Follies'' at the John F. Kennedy Center for the Performing Arts will transfer north to the Marquis Theater for a limited run that is expected to begin performances in August, the president of the Kennedy Center said in an interview on Wednesday. Casting is not set, but it's fair to assume that the two stars of this ''Follies'' - Bernadette Peters as Sally Durant Plummer and Jan Maxwell as Phyllis Rogers Stone - will be sought to continue in the Broadway run, said Michael M. Kaiser, the Kennedy Center president. He said contract talks with the actors had yet to begin, and added that he was not certain which members of the cast would be available to continue to Broadway."

Of these, only the salmon and dessert strike me as dated — the former because salmon no longer seems nearly as good and guilt-free as it did a decade ago, and the latter because these days I rarely indulge in desserts that are 80 percent full-fat dairy and 20 percent sugar, as coeur à la crème is."

2011-06-17T00:00:00Z,"TURNER--Dana. Dana Turner uniquely navigated the worlds of civil rights law, public theater activism and computerized research. She was born October 13, 1954 in Gary, Indiana, grew up in California and graduated from Georgetown Law School. After working at the Library of Congress she moved to New York City to practice law on behalf of the transgender and HIV+ communities. She used her lively sense of humor, magnetic personality and strategic insight to pioneer the use of public theatre for civil rights activism. This was famously achieved with her organization of, and starring in, the first ever Drag Show on the Mall at the 1992 March on Washington for Gay & Lesbian Rights. She later starred for several years as the ""Mz Liberty"" persona on behalf of oppressed people in New York City Gay Pride events. Her work for the International Conferences on Transgender Law & Employment Policy helped put the ""T"" in the GLBT alliance, as well as deepen its sensitivity to issues of race, class and gender. Ms. Turner was an expert in online research, often finding key information that other lawyers missed. She also served on the board of the World Against Racism Foundation, provided legal support to the Sylvia Rivera Law Project and starred in the award-winning 2006 documentary ""Cruel & Unusual"" about transgender women in men's prisons, several of whom she represented. Dana was admitted to Roosevelt Hospital in New York City on April 26th with atrial fibrillation and passed in her sleep at 4:11am on April 28th. Her warmth, charm and generosity created a large family of loved ones in Oregon, San Francisco, New York City and beyond.

2011-06-17T00:00:00Z,"Scientists have designed a brain implant that restored lost memory function and strengthened recall of new information in laboratory rats -- a crucial first step in the development of so-called neuroprosthetic devices to repair deficits from dementia, stroke and other brain injuries in humans. Though still a long way from being tested in humans, the implant demonstrates for the first time that a cognitive function can be improved with a device that mimics the firing patterns of neurons. In recent years neuroscientists have developed implants that allow paralyzed people to move prosthetic limbs or a computer cursor, using their thoughts to activate the machines. In the new work, being published Friday, researchers at Wake Forest University and the University of Southern California used some of the same techniques to read neural activity.

This new film continues the series and features Buster from ages six to 10. While these films portray childhood, the perspective is parental. If Buster had made this film it would be all baseball, and the actual point of view, looking up at grownups twice his size, would surely feature more chins and nostrils. The angle might seem a small thing, but it can alter the feeling in subtle ways. Looking at children, our perspective is angled down and as they look up, we see eyes, those big ones, looking up like lasers. And, like every portrait, these films are double portraits, simultaneously reflecting the sensibility of who made them as well as who they picture."

2011-06-18T00:00:00Z,"8 P.M. (HBO) INCEPTION (2010) Leonardo DiCaprio, above, stars as Cobb, a specialist in corporate mental espionage who, using a combination of drugs, wires and other Matrix-y methods, penetrates the minds of his sleeping targets to extract information. Ken Watanabe is Saito, the wealthy client who has hired Cobb and his associates (Joseph Gordon-Levitt and Ellen Page, among others) to undertake the trick known as inception, which involves planting an idea in someone's mind that will come to fruition in the real world. Their mission: to induce a young man (Cillian Murphy), whose father (Pete Postlethwaite) is a business rival of Saito's, to break up the company he is about to inherit. Meanwhile, Cobb can't stop thinking about his wife (Marion Cotillard). '' 'Inception,' Christopher Nolan's visually arresting, noir-tinged caper, is as packed with allusions and citations as a film studies term paper,'' A. O. Scott wrote in The New York Times. ''Admirers of Ridley Scott's 'Blade Runner' and Stanley Kubrick's '2001' will find themselves in good company, though 'Inception' does not come close to matching the impact of those durable cult objects. It trades in crafty puzzles rather than profound mysteries, and gestures in the direction of mighty philosophical questions that Mr. Nolan is finally too tactful, too timid or perhaps just too busy to engage.'' Still, Mr. Scott said of the film, which won Oscars for cinematography, sound mixing, sound editing and visual effects, ''A lot of this is -- what is the critical term of art I'm looking for? -- pretty cool.'' NOON (13) RICHARD HEFFNER'S OPEN MIND Michele Moody-Adams, the dean of Columbia College of Columbia University, discusses the history and future of America's liberal arts colleges.

2011-06-18T00:00:00Z,"BOWLES--Sarah, passed away in her sleep at home in Essex, CT, on June 5. She will be remembered for her irreverent wit, generosity, love of life even in illness, trenchant critiques of what she considered erroneous political ideas, and lifelong commitment to public service. And also for her hilarious holiday gifts to the children of her extended family of Bowles, Bennets, Coombs and others. Sally (as most people knew her) was born April 26, 1938 in New Haven, the daughter of Dorothy Stebbins Bowles and Chester Bowles, a former governor of the State of Connecticut, Under Secretary of State under John F. Kennedy and Ambassador to India. She was educated in the Sidwell Friends School (in Washington, DC), Essex Elementary School, Noah Webster Elementary School (in Hartford), the Delhi Public School (in India), the Milton Academy and Smith College, where she was coxswain of the college crew and head of student government. She was among the founders of the Peace Corps as Sargent Shriver's right hand in the early 1960s and went on to be New York Mayor John Lindsey 's education advisor during the tumultuous late 1960s and early 70s. She met with African National Congress leaders Nelson Mandela and Walter Sisulu as part of a Rockefeller Foundation initiative supporting the struggle to end apartheid in the 1980s. She also served as Deputy Commissioner of Welfare and in other capacities for the State of Connecticut. During the 1990s she left public employment to become a national leader in the management of private philanthropy and a member of the board of directors of several nonprofit foundations focusing on learning, positions that she continued to hold until her death. In recent years, despite a serious respiratory illness, her signature enthusiasm and energy touched everyone in her orbit. Many who knew her only on the telephone (from which she was never far) were unaware that she was ill. She said she would live a life in full as long as it went; and she did. She leaves her brothers Sam and Chester, sisters Cynthia Aguilar and Barbara Coolidge, stepson Jody Rosen and a circle of lifelong, loving friends that stretches from the lower Connecticut Valley to India and across the world. The family has asked that in lieu of flowers, donations in her memory be sent to the Connecticut Nature Conservancy or the World Press Institute. A memorial service is planned for September."

(""Perry"") of Palm Beach Gardens, FL and Nantucket, MA and formerly of Cedar Grove, NJ died comfortably in his home surrounded by family after a prolonged illness on Wednesday, June 15. He was 75 years old. Mr. Ruddick was born in Montclair, NJ on March 28, 1936 to the late Girard Bliss Ruddick and Marcia Perry Ruddick Cook. He attended Montclair Academy and graduated from The Phillips Exeter Academy in 1954 and Princeton University in 1958. Mr. Ruddick received his M.B.A., with distinction, from The Harvard Business School in 1961. Mr. Ruddick, and his wife, Susan, were married on July 29, 1961 in Akron, OH. Mr. Ruddick's 30 year Wall Street career was spent entirely at Smith Barney. He first joined the firm as a Summer Associate in 1960, became the youngest partner at the time in 1968, and retired as Vice Chairman and Chief Administrative Officer in 1991. During his career he moved from international and domestic investment banking to securities trading, operations, finance, administration and asset management, allowing him to participate in almost every aspect of a business that he truly loved. After retiring, Mr. Ruddick undertook increased conservation activities as a board member and President of the Sconset Trust and a board member of the Nantucket Conservation Foundation, where he continued his efforts to help control the development of land activities on his beloved island, Nantucket. In 2008, Mr. Ruddick and his wife led the Sankaty Head Lighthouse Campaign, raising over $4 million to support the move of the lighthouse off the bluff and into a new spot where future generations can enjoy it for decades more to come. He also served as a member of the board of trustees at Nantucket Cottage Hospital. Mr. Ruddick was a sports enthusiast and an accomplished athlete, playing on his high school and college tennis teams, as well as various club tennis and paddle tennis teams. But his true passion was golf! He was a member of the Sankaty Head Golf Club in Nantucket and the Old Marsh Golf Club in Florida, and a former member of the Montclair Golf Club in New Jersey and the Nantucket Golf Club. Highlights of his golfing career include playing in the Bing Crosby Pro-Am for several years, playing on the U.S. Seniors Amateur Golf Circuit and scoring a hole-in-one at Ventana Canyon. Mr. Ruddick combined his business acumen with his love of sports when he served as a board member and President of the Sankaty Head Golf Club and the Sconset Casino Association (tennis club) in Nantucket, and on the Advisory Board of the Old Marsh Golf Club in Florida. In addition, he was a founding member of the Nantucket Golf Club. Formerly a long-standing member of the University Club of New York, Mr. Ruddick also enjoyed meeting there with his friends and business associates alike. Mr. Ruddick will be remembered as a man dedicated to his family, friends and communities and one who was extremely successful in all he attempted. He is survived by his devoted family, including his wife, of almost 50 years, Susan; his three children, Julie Meade of Bronxville, NY, Pam Holding of Wellesley, MA and Girard Ruddick of Warren, RI; his seven grandchildren, Perry and Tommy Meade, Will, Chase and Abby Holding, and JP and Read Ruddick; his sons-in-law, Charlie Meade and Bill Holding and his daughter-in-law, Erin Ruddick. He was predeceased by his sister, Janet Cook Phillips. Memorial services will be held in Siasconset, MA at 4:00pm on Tuesday, July 12, 2011 at the Sconset Chapel and Montclair, NJ at a later date.

Sony Pictures Classics said Thursday that it planned to increase the number of theaters showing Woody Allen's new time-traveling comedy ''Midnight in Paris,'' to 1,038 screens, the widest release of any of Mr. Allen's films. ''Midnight in Paris,'' which has been well-received by critics, has earned more than $16 million in the United States and more than $18.3 million overseas, where in recent years Mr. Allen has found a much bigger audience than he enjoys at home. (His last critically successful film, ''Vicky Christina Barcelona,'' earned $23.2 million in the United States and $73.2 million internationally, according to boxofficemojo.com.) ''Midnight in Paris,'' which stars Owen Wilson and a crowded bistro's worth of well-known actors - Adrien Brody, Rachel McAdams, Kathy Bates - follows a perpetually dissatisfied Hollywood screenwriter working in Paris who makes nightly excursions back into the 1920's Lost Generation version of the City of Light, communing with the likes of Hemingway and Salvador Dali.

The study, published in the journal Social Science Research, surveyed 3,079 students, the majority of whom were in their early- to mid-20s."

They set out to put great works on display in cultural capitals like New York and Boston. Instead, Ms. Walton's Crystal Bridges Museum of American Art -- the first major institution in 50 years dedicated to the vast spectrum of American art, to be housed in a building more than twice the size of the current Whitney Museum of American Art -- seeks to bring high art to middle America here in this town of 35,000 that is best known as the home of Wal-Mart."

But HBO’s adaptation of George R. R. Martin’s fantasy saga is one of the few high-profile attempts to take the cliche and try to literalize it, by faithfully translating a big fat teeming novel into a 10-episode television season. With exceptions like “True Blood,” which is based on Charlaine Harris’s vampire novels (though how closely I’m not sure, as a non-fan of the show and books  alike), few of the major cable dramas have been adaptations of existing stories. From Al Swearengen to Walter White to Stringer Bell, the great characters of television’s dramatic golden age have sprung from the imaginations of TV writers, rather than the printed page."

2011-06-19T00:00:00Z,"HOLMES--David L. David L. Holmes, 67, most recently of Delray Beach, Florida, died peacefully in his sleep on Sunday, May 29th. David was born and raised in Mineola, NY, but spent most of his working and family life in New Haven, CT. There he served as the Director of Downtown and Harbor Development during the city's most vigorous period of growth in the 1970s and 1980s and was responsible for more than $750 million in development. Holmes was widely known as a force of nature outspoken, passionate, and tenacious in his quest to bring sustainable development to the City. Prior to that appointment, Holmes was a leader in the completion of the landmark Long Island Sound Study. Holmes spent several years at the Lawrence Investing Company of New York where he began his second career as an executive with that real estate development firm. This period was distinguished by the design, financing and construction of Audubon Court, an award-winning, $35 million mixed-use project in New Haven, CT. From Lawrence Investing, Holmes returned to public service with the City of Yonkers, NY, where he served as the Commissioner of the Department of Planning and Development. Among his accomplishments were the settlement of a nationally famous housing desegregation case and the transformation of the City's downtown and waterfront districts. Leveraging his unique experience in both private and public sector development, Holmes also made his mark in military base redevelopment as President and CEO of the Plattsburgh Airbase Redevelopment Corporation. Under his leadership, the 5,000-acre former Strategic Air Command (SAC) base in New York was thoughtfully converted for civilian use, creating thousands of jobs and millions in annual rent. In recent years, under the auspices of his own Holmes Development Group, along with Joel Schiavone, David connected once again to New Haven on projects for the Quinnipiac River Village neighborhood and the Chapel West project next to the Yale campus. David received his BA in Economics from Rockford College and studied City Planning at Yale University and Urban Geography at Southern Connecticut State University. He leaves behind his daughter Jessica Evans and son-in-law, Laran Evans of San Mateo, California, and his son Michael Holmes, of Seoul, Korea. David will also be missed by his grandchildren, Milo and Charlotte. He is survived by his sisters, April Holmes and Jill Holmes, and brother, Gary Holmes, all of the Charlottesville, VA area. David had hundreds of friends throughout the country who relished his larger-than-life persona, tremendous wit, irrepressible sense of humor and relentless curiosity. His life will be fully celebrated at a joyful gathering at 11:00am on Saturday, June 25th at the Neighborhood Music School, 100 Audubon S., New Haven, CT. An informal reception will follow. Please RSVP to Mike Watt at mike.watt@americanavc.com. In lieu of flowers, David's family requests that donations go to CARE: www.care.org"

I asked, and the room went silent. France being one of the most visited countries in the world, the natives like to keep a few places to themselves. Le Touquet is a tiny jewel on the English Channel about two and a half hours north of Paris by train. It has a majestic forest right in the heart of town and an array of villas that form a kind of primer on changing bourgeois taste. There's also a wonderful Art Moderne market and the Westminster Hotel, a beautiful Edwardian pile that regulars call Le West. What the North Fork is to Manhattan, Le Touquet is to Paris.

2011-06-19T00:00:00Z,"MILLER--Albert Abraham, 83, passed away on June 2, 2011 in Tampa, FL, formerly a long-time resident of Valley Stream, NY. Al was born in the Edgemere neighborhood of Far Rockaway, NY, on December 27, 1927. He began work at his parents' local grocery store, frequented in the summertime by Babe Ruth and other notable beach vacationers. Al graduated from Far Rockaway High School and enlisted in the Army, where he served in Alaska's Aleutian Islands during WWII. Upon his return, Al proposed to his high school sweetheart, Bernice ""Bunny"" Finkelstein, and they were married in 1951. After graduating Hofstra and earning his professional license, Al embarked upon a CPA career in Manhattan which spanned over five decades, first as a partner with Dahut, Penn and Miller, then managing partner of Miller, Hershey & Co and later Miller, Levine & Co. Al was well known for treating his clients and friends like family and many remember with great fondness, when in need, the extraordinary help and sage counsel he provided. He loved his work and never intended to retire. Al was a member for many years and served as President of the 101 Club of New York. He loved sailing and skiing, and maintained a lifelong devotion to playing tennis--always attending the US Open. A loyal fan of both Giants teams, baseball and football, he happily recounted his day in the centerfield bleachers of the Polo Grounds when his favorite player Willie Mays ran towards him to make ""The Catch"" in the first game of the 1954 World Series (Al can be seen in the much publicized photograph fifth row, third from the left aisle). Al harbored a passion for learning and was an avid reader and movie buff. He and Bunny enjoyed the theater and nightlife of New York City, and they traveled extensively throughout the world. Al is survived by his beloved wife Bunny, his son Michael (and Sheryl), daughter Caryn Russ (and Andy) and grandchildren Caroline and Elizabeth Miller and Laura, Alexander and Benjamin Russ. Al was predeceased by his sisters Gertrude and Shirley, and son Kenny. Donations in Al's memory may be sent to Alzheimer's Association (www.alz.org) or Lifepath Hospice in Tampa (www.chaptershealth.org)."

After a big scare in the first round against their bete noire, Chicago, they won 8 of their next 11 games to get to the finals."

2011-06-19T00:00:00Z,"Weeks after a tornado ripped a 20-mile path through Joplin, Mo., many residents have retrieved the possessions that are in good-enough condition to keep -- and have left the rest to be carted off as garbage. But something is still being extracted from the ruins: a financial assessment of the damage. That is the job of hundreds of insurance adjusters, who are working long hours, including weekends, fanned out across devastated neighborhoods. They climb rooftops, peer through twisted window frames and stretch out lengths of measuring tape as they try to attach a dollar figure to what was lost. The adjusters work alongside utility employees, emergency management teams and clean-up crews in the disaster zone, where flies swarm in clouds and the stench of rot wafts from broken refrigerators. The adjusters operate from motels or mobile offices in the area, handing out checks and also refreshments, trash bags and children's toys to displaced residents, many of whom are living with family and friends or staying in hotels and other temporary housing. Risk analysts have estimated losses in Joplin at $1 billion to $3 billion. While it may be too early for a final tally, there is one statistic that already defines the catastrophe: at least 151 people were killed, making it the nation's deadliest tornado since 1947.

2011-06-19T00:00:00Z,"TURNER--Dana. Dana Turner uniquely navigated the worlds of civil rights law, public theater activism and computerized research. She was born October 13, 1954 in Gary, Indiana, grew up in California and graduated from Georgetown Law School. After working at the Library of Congress she moved to New York City to practice law on behalf of the transgender and HIV+ communities. She used her lively sense of humor, magnetic personality and strategic insight to pioneer the use of public theatre for civil rights activism. This was famously achieved with her organization of, and starring in, the first ever Drag Show on the Mall at the 1992 March on Washington for Gay & Lesbian Rights. She later starred for several years as the ""Mz Liberty"" persona on behalf of oppressed people in New York City Gay Pride events. Her work for the International Conferences on Transgender Law & Employment Policy helped put the ""T"" in the GLBT alliance, as well as deepen its sensitivity to issues of race, class and gender. Ms. Turner was an expert in online research, often finding key information that other lawyers missed. She also served on the board of the World Against Racism Foundation, provided legal support to the Sylvia Rivera Law Project and starred in the award-winning 2006 documentary ""Cruel & Unusual"" about transgender women in men's prisons, several of whom she represented. Dana was admitted to Roosevelt Hospital in New York City on April 26th with atrial fibrillation and passed in her sleep at 4:11am on April 28th. Her warmth, charm and generosity created a large family of loved ones in Oregon, San Francisco, New York City and beyond. A public visitation will be held at the Terasem Movement Transreligion Ashram at 2 Park Place, in Bristol, Vermont (30 miles south of Burlington, VT on Rte 116), from Noon 1pm on June 19th, 2011, followed by a 2pm burial at the nearby Maplewood Cemetery in Lincoln, Vermont.

2011-06-19T00:00:00Z,"For many years, Robert Jay Lifton has been recognized as a leading ''psychohistorian,'' or as he prefers to define his vocation, a ''historically minded psychiatrist.'' Psychohistory is the field of inquiry that explores the psychological motives of individuals and groups of historical actors, as well as the psychological impact of historical events. Lifton is perhaps best known as the author of ''Death in Life: Survivors of Hiroshima,'' published in 1967, which received a National Book Award. In that book, he described how the hibakusha, those residents of Hiroshima who survived the atomic bomb on Aug. 6, 1945, lived with deep and shameful feelings of being ''inwardly poisoned'' by their experience, as well as an embittered ''sense of special knowledge'' that set them apart from those who had not witnessed the horrors of the attack. ''Witness to an Extreme Century'' is a memoir of Lifton's life and career, and as one is forewarned by its title, he doesn't offer readers many laughs. Still, one passage toward the end did make me smile. ''Dad,'' he reports his daughter, Natasha, once asking him, ''have you ever considered taking up more cheerful subjects?''"

2011-06-19T00:00:00Z,"THE difference, for the traveler, between a first and repeated visit is crucial. To ''go back'' is not ''to go.'' Yet old, familiar places retain a kind of magic, and all the more so when the memories are shared. For our 40th wedding anniversary year, my wife, Elena, and I returned to the place where our marriage began: the South of France. We planned to visit old haunts, the area we'd once called home. Then, we had had all the time in the world; now we could spend a week. Too, there's a difference between 20-somethings living on a shoestring and tourists ''of a certain age'' who stay in fine hotels. ''Let's do it right this time,'' I said. ''Let's fly to Nice and stay where we couldn't afford to before. Let's ramble down Memory Lane.''"

Jihadism sure isn’t what it used to be. After 10 years, it seems, the time has come to go home. Troops are and will be coming back to the United States from Iraq and Afghanistan. The military budget will be cut. The outgoing secretary of defense feels able to openly mock NATO because, presumably, he thinks he can afford to — because it doesn’t matter all that much. The global war on terror is being downgraded from Armageddon to something more out of Leviticus: a tricked-out police action, just as John Kerry, in this magazine, always said it should be. On Sunday, Helene Cooper and Mark Landler reported that “American success in the counterterrorism campaign would seem to bolster arguments for a swift withdrawal from Afghanistan.” By Tuesday morning, they were reporting that President Obama would announce his withdrawal plans on Wednesday. Meanwhile, a Harris poll revealed that 51 percent of Americans and 54 percent of Britons believed “the death of Bin Laden meant it was time to bring troops from their countries home.”"

2011-06-21T00:00:00Z,"It's here today, gone tomorrow for ''Born Yesterday'' as that Broadway play will close on Sunday, its press representatives said on Monday. This latest production of Garson Kanin's comedy about a brutish tycoon, his girlfriend and the tutor entrusted with her education drew praise for the performance of its star Nina Arianda, who plays the dopey girlfriend, Billie. (Jim Belushi plays the tycoon and Robert Sean Leonard plays the tutor.) Ms. Arianda was compared favorably to Judy Holliday, who portrayed Billie in the original Broadway production and the George Cukor film version of ''Born Yesterday,'' and she was nominated for a Tony Award for leading actress in a play. The revival, directed by Doug Hughes (''Doubt''), also received a Tony nomination for costume design but did not win in either category. The production, which opened on April 24 at the Cort Theater, will have played 28 previews and 73 performances when it closes, its press representatives said. This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print."

2011-06-21T00:00:00Z,"Long before he was a star of the international art world and a target of the Chinese government, the artist Ai Weiwei was at the center of an obscure group of Chinese cultural emigres in the East Village, a community that he documented in some 10,000 photographs in the decade that he lived there, from 1983 to 1993. Now, while Mr. Ai remains under detention in China, without formal charges, the Asia Society is preparing to open an exhibition of 227 of his New York photographs. They show not only important East Village events like Wigstock and local characters like Allen Ginsberg, but also humble gatherings in Mr. Ai's Third Street apartment featuring people like the artist Xu Bing, the filmmaker Chen Kaige and the composer Tan Dun, all now major Chinese cultural figures who were then toiling in immigrant obscurity. In a telephone interview the director of the Asia Society Museum, Melissa Chiu, said that she had been planning the exhibition with Mr. Ai before his detention on April 3. He had selected the photographs and made a set of prints, but since those prints were stranded in his Beijing studio, which has been inaccessible since his detention, a new set had to be made for the exhibition, which will run from June 29 to Aug. 14. (A similar show was mounted in Beijing in 2009 by the Three Shadows Photography Art Center, which is helping the Asia Society organize the new show.) Asked how Mr. Ai's arrest had affected the show, Ms. Chiu said that she thought it was now more important than ever, since it sheds light on a period that was formative for him both artistically and politically. ''It also gives voice to an artist who has essentially been silenced since April 3,'' she said."

2011-06-21T00:00:00Z,"BLOOMBERG--Charlotte R. Hadassah, the Women's Zionist Organization of America, mourns the passing of Charlotte R. Bloomberg, an inspiration to the Zionist movement, who died June 19 in Medford, MA. She was 102. In addition to having the Mother and Child Center at Hadassah Ein Kerem named for her, Mrs. Bloomberg was the oldest living alumna and generous supporter of Hadassah's youth program, now called Young Judaea. The Jewish people, Israel and Hadassah have lost a truly inspirational figure, a role model and a friend, said Hadassah National President Nancy Falchuk. We are tremendously sad at her passing but also incredibly grateful for the legacy she left and the rich, full life she shared with us. Our hearts go out to her son, Mayor Michael Bloomberg, and her daughter, Marjorie Tiven. Mrs. Bloomberg was associated with Hadassah almost her entire life, starting with Young Judaea in her teenage years to eventually endowing a scholarship fund, and providing scholarship money to Camp Tel Yehudah. She was also president of Hadassah's Medford chapter. At the 2003 dedication of the Mother and Child Center in her name and in honor of her 95th birthday, Mayor Bloomberg quipped, I don't know if there is a more sublime mitzvah than a Jewish son taking his mother and sister to Israel. Hadassah is a greater mitzvah. Hadassah is the gold standard of health care, a place that practices world class medicine and produces exceptional scholarship; a place that treats more than one million people a year; a place where every one of them is treated as a person. Falchuk said, The real mitzvah was our opportunity to know Mrs. Bloomberg. In her devotion to her family and to Israel, Charlotte Bloomberg represented the finest Hadassah tradition. She will be missed, but her name lives on in the center that bears it. May her memory be for a blessing and may her family be comforted among the mourners of Zion and Jerusalem."" Donations in Charlotte Bloomberg's memory may be sent to Hadassah: 50 West 58th Street, New York, NY 10019."

She was 102 years old. She was an active community volunteer and known for maintaining a vigorous schedule until a few years ago. She served as co-president of her synagogue, Temple Shalom, when she was in her nineties. Mrs. Bloomberg frequently ate lunch out - Legal Seafood was a favorite - visited museums, and read The Boston Globe and The New York Times on a daily basis and participated in her monthly book club. She also delighted in new family photographs and enjoyed the visits of family, friends and neighbors. She was a crack Scrabble player and continued playing as recently as last month. Born in Jersey City in 1909, Mrs. Bloomberg earned a bachelors degree in accounting from New York University in 1929, a time when few women attended college. She moved to West Medford in 1945. In addition to family responsibilities and volunteer work, for several years she worked as an office manager in Boston. The Mayor was a devoted son and visited her frequently. A proud mother, Mrs. Bloomberg was an enthusiastic participant at the Mayor's swearing-in ceremonies in 2002 and 2006. Her daughter, Marjorie Tiven was her constant companion and advisor. Together, they enjoyed looking back and researching their family history, recognizing in particular the work ethic and devotion to philanthropy the family is noted for today. They proudly set standards for Mrs. Bloomberg's grandchildren going forward. With love and gratitude, the family made a donation in Mrs. Bloomberg's name to Hadassah for the Camp Tel Yehudah program on her 90th birthday, and also dedicated a Children's wing in her honor at the Hadassah Hospital in Jerusalem in 2003 for her 95th. To commemorate her 100th birthday, they made possible the Charlotte R. Bloomberg Children's Center at the Johns Hopkins Hospital in Baltimore. It is scheduled to open in 2012 and she took great pride in watching its construction over the last few years. Charlotte Rubens married William H. Bloomberg in 1934. He died in 1963.

2011-06-21T00:00:00Z,"Among the many novel ideas implemented at the New York Philharmonic since Alan Gilbert took the reins as its music director in 2009, one has come to loom larger than all the rest. ''Le Grand Macabre,'' a musically unorthodox, wickedly funny absurdist opera by Gyorgy Ligeti, represented a substantial risk when the Philharmonic mounted a series of performances of it at Avery Fisher Hall in May 2010, imaginatively and resourcefully staged by Doug Fitch, a designer and director with whom Mr. Gilbert had worked in opera houses. When the production was hailed as a stunning success among audiences and critics alike, ''Le Grand Macabre'' came to represent Mr. Gilbert's vision for the institution at its most audacious. But when you've brought down the house with the end of the world -- at least as Ligeti imagined it -- what do you do for an encore?"

That’s the question everyone’s asking with regard to Jon Huntsman, who formally announced his candidacy yesterday, and the answer is a resounding yes. From George H.W. Bush and Bob Dole through George W. Bush and John McCain, the modern-day Republican Party has a long tradition of picking nominees whose records and positions place them to the left of True Conservatism, at least as defined by movement institutions, talk radio and the like. Even in the age of the Tea Party, there’s reason to imagine this pattern persisting: Many Republican primary voters hold heterodox positions (for instance, on tax increases on the rich) relative to the official conservative line, several of the crucial early primaries allow independents to cross over and vote, and in races against incumbent presidents there’s a high premium on electability. It’s certainly possible for a Republican to be too liberal for the primary electorate, and often a moderate candidate has to flip-flop on a key issue (or six) to appease the party’s interest groups. But the historical record suggests that there’s more room between Rush Limbaugh and the center than many commentators (and politicians) seem to think."

For Balthus the talisman was the tablier he picked up at the American Hospital in Paris during World War II, which he wore religiously. Balthus always painted in the smock, using it like a cloth to wipe his brushes clean. It was never washed and, over 60 odd years, it accumulated layer upon layer of pigment, becoming an artwork in itself. The artist Katerina Jebb, who uses scanners and copy machines in her work, has scanned the front and back of the tablier in 12-by-16-inch fragments to create a life-size copy of it on paper that will be shown at the Balthus Chapel in the village of Rossinière, Switzerland from June 25, 2011 through May, 2012.

The Mariners are likely to generate more save situations than the average team because their pitcher-friendly park, strong starting staff, solid defense and terrible offense ensure that many of their wins are by small margins. League doesn’t strike out too many batters (20 in 30 2/3 innings), but he has walked only five, keeps the ball on the ground (2-to-1 ground-ball-to-fly-ball ratio) and averages 96 miles per hour on his fastball. He came out of Tuesday’s loss in Washington after a line drive hit him on the leg and could miss some time.Trevor Cahill went from a seven-walk, zero-strikeout disaster start on June 14 to an eight-inning, one-walk, seven-strikeout gem on Sunday.

The award, created in 2009, recognizes an American playwright whose work recently received its professional debut in New York; ''Chad Deity'' was produced Off Broadway in 2010 by Second Stage Theater, drawing mostly positive reviews. (The play was also a finalist for the Pulitzer Prize in drama that year.) Previous recipients of the Times playwright award, which comes with a cash prize of $5,000, were Tarell Alvin McCraney for ''The Brothers Size'' and Dan LeFranc for ''Sixty Miles to Silver Lake.'' The selection committee included the Pulitzer-winning playwrights Richard Greenberg, James Lapine and Lynn Nottage, as well as Times writers and editors. The committee chairwoman, Sylviane Gold, said in the statement announcing the award, ''The play appropriates both the comedy and cruelty of professional wrestling in order to explore the complex dance America does with its minorities.''

2011-06-22T00:00:00Z,"It is undoubtedly useful to sort music by nationality, period, genre and style, but the actual experience of listening to music can often leave such categories in shambles. If I said, for example, that ''Passione,''John Turturro's galvanic tribute to the songs and singers of Naples, Italy, was a documentary about soul music, that might be confusing, since that term commonly refers to 1960s African-American music. But what else could you call the tradition that Mr. Turturro samples? The music in ''Passione'' combines sensual suavity with raw emotion, mixes heartbreak with ecstasy, acknowledges the hard realities of poverty and injustice and soars above them. I suspect that if artists like Marvin Gaye, Otis Redding or Aretha Franklin were to see this film, they would recognize their own art within it."

(Discovery) LIFE ON A WIRE Nik Wallenda, above, a seventh-generation member of the acrobatic family the Flying Wallendas, is on a mission to take his high-wire act to a new audience. In this sneak peek of a series that will have its premiere later this year, Mr. Wallenda, 32, demonstrates how he routinely cheats death as he balances on a wire without a safety net, through the use of engineering and wind-speed analysis conducted by a crew that includes his uncle Mike and his father, Terry. His feat here: to try to break two world records by crossing a wire between towers at the Atlantis resort in the Bahamas. On June 4 he and his mother, Delilah, successfully completed a walk at the Condado Plaza Hotel in San Juan, P.R., on a wire stretched 121 feet above the pavement -- the crossing that killed his great-grandfather Karl in 1978. Mr. Wallenda eventually plans to honor Karl Wallenda's memory by walking across the Grand Canyon. 9:30 A.M.

The award, created in 2009, recognizes an American playwright whose work recently received its professional debut in New York; ''Chad Deity'' was produced Off Broadway in 2010 by Second Stage Theater, drawing mostly positive reviews. (The play was also a finalist for the Pulitzer Prize in drama that year.) Previous recipients of the Times playwright award, which comes with a cash prize of $5,000, were Tarell Alvin McCraney for ''The Brothers Size'' and Dan LeFranc for ''Sixty Miles to Silver Lake.'' The selection committee included the Pulitzer-winning playwrights James Lapine and Lynn Nottage; the playwright Richard Greenberg, who has been nominated twice for a Pulitzer; as well as Times writers and editors. The committee chairwoman, Sylviane Gold, said in the statement announcing the award, ''The play appropriates both the comedy and cruelty of professional wrestling in order to explore the complex dance America does with its minorities.'' She added, ''We were floored by its swaggering language, vivid theatricality and sheer energy.''"

On Tuesday the troubled pop singer canceled the remaining dates of a planned 12-stop concert series after a Saturday performance in Belgrade, Serbia, in which she was seen meandering around the stage and struggling to remember her own songs, The Associated Press reported. Ms. Winehouse, 27, the Grammy Award-winning singer of ''Rehab,'' began her tour in the Serbian capital after a one-week stay at the Priory, a London clinic that offers treatment for addiction problems. But any hopes of her cleaning the slate and setting a good first impression were quickly dashed after video of that concert, in which Ms. Winehouse drifts in and out of her songs and at one point tosses aside her microphone, made its way around the Internet. The A.P. said the Serbian newspaper Blic had called the concert ''the worst in the history of Belgrade.'' Chris Goodman, a spokesman for Ms. Winehouse, said she ''is withdrawing from all scheduled performances'' included planned dates in Spain, Switzerland, Italy, Austria, Poland, Hungary and Romania."

The focus on the link between statins and diabetes comes at a time when some medical experts and pharmaceutical companies have pushed to broaden the use of the drugs beyond the 40 million at-risk patients who already use them to healthy people who would take the drugs for prevention of heart disease."

2011-06-22T00:00:00Z,"ARMSTRONG--Thomas N.,III. The Board of Trustees and Staff of the Whitney Museum of American Art note with profound sadness the sudden passing of our beloved former director Thomas N. Armstrong III. Director of the Museum for 15 transformative years (1974-1990) his distinguished tenure was marked by seminal exhibitions by artists including Saul Steinberg, Richard Tuttle, Nam June Paik, Elie Nadelman, Red Grooms, Donald Judd, Richard Artschwager and Robert Mapplethorpe, as well as over 2,000 key acquisitions. So significant were the masterpieces acquired, including Jasper John's Three Flags and Alexander Calder's The Circus, that today the Museum's collection would be unimaginable without them. As Director he worked with three generations of Whitney women to lead the monumental transition from a family-run institution to the preeminent Museum that it is today. For Tom, the goal was to bring the best of American Art to the broadest possible public. He expanded the Museum's Branch program to include Philip Morris, Champion International, and the Equitable Center and established the National Committee, a patron group that brought together collectors from all over the country. He also conceived the idea and began the drive to expand the Whitney that recently got underway with groundbreaking on its future downtown building. We were pleased and honored that he joined us for this historic occasion. Much of what Whitney is today and what it will become in the future is a part of his legacy. With his broad smile and characteristic bow ties, Tom was a larger than life personality whose ebullience was infectious. He was a respected colleague as well as a mentor to so many in the Museum world. All who love American art, and all who are devoted to artists of our time are indebted to Tom. We will truly miss him. Our most sincere and heartfelt sympathies to his wife Bunty, his sister Susan, his children Thomas, Amory, Eliot, and Whitney, his seven grandchildren and his many friends and loved ones.

2011-06-23T16:18:27Z,"“I am a magpie collecting things everywhere I go,” says Lizzie Fortunato, the designer behind her namesake Lizzie Fortunato Jewels line. Her finds have included antique whalebone poker chips in Montevideo, Uruguay, textiles from a Guatemalan village and vintage arrows at a flea market in rural Texas. This inspiration from travel is delightfully apparent in her resort collection, “Paradise Is an Island.” The assortment is a tropical concoction of polychromatic glass beads, winsome brass arrowheads and carnelian tusks, all strung together on gold chains and rope — the perfect colorful addition to an urbanite’s summer wardrobe. Despite each piece having names of exotic vacation hot spots, like “Easter Island Necklace,” the root of the label could not be more down-to-earth. For Fortunato, jewelry has always been a natural outlet. “By the time I was in college, I was fashioning statement necklaces out of industrial bolts and chains, glass beads that a friend toted back from South Africa and family heirloom pieces — literally anything I could get my hands on,” she explains. The results are a fusion of high and low, with thoughtful handiwork and smart combinations of pearls, colorful rope and shapely gold."

Rumor has it that the entire music industry is chasing after Caveman, waving record contracts, but the gaggle of mischievous man-boys, led by a singer with an I.Q. purported to be off the charts, refuses to sign anything. Obscenely talented, and airtight in performance delivery, Caveman is finally getting over its commitment phobia, releasing its first album, “CoCo Beware,” this fall.

Now that I’m teaching photography at Pomona College, I knit on the train during my commute, and it’s a great way to pass the time in faculty meetings.” Auerbach, who lives and works in a space in downtown Los Angeles (which she shares with several other artists), still knits the old-fashioned way, with needles, but her studio also houses two computer-controlled knitting machines."

Guides with headsets preach with one eye toward the picture, the other on crowd control. Just around the corner, in a nearby gallery, a tiny landscape, paperback-book size, painted by Velázquez as a young man in Rome around 1630, shows the gardens at the Villa Medici. Few tourists pause or notice it. It's a summer scene, gazing from the ground up at a workman looking down from a rooftop at a pair of chatting colleagues, distractedly holding one end of a rope he has apparently dropped for them. He stands on a broad, low, whitewashed building with a large arched entryway blocked by scaffolding. Caught in the early morning light, the rope he has dropped glints like the silver thread of a spider's web. It is almost imperceptibly fine. Draped absently over a balustrade, like bunting, a white sheet also shimmers in the sun, reflecting at intervals on the stonework like patches of spilled milk."

The Board of Trustees and Staff of the Whitney Museum of American Art note with profound sadness the sudden passing of our beloved former director Thomas N. Armstrong III. Director of the Museum for 15 transformative years (1974-1990) his distinguished tenure was marked by seminal exhibitions by artists including Saul Steinberg, Richard Tuttle, Nam June Paik, Elie Nadelman, Red Grooms, Donald Judd, Richard Artschwager and Robert Mapplethorpe, as well as over 2,000 key acquisitions. So significant were the masterpieces acquired, including Jasper John's Three Flags and Alexander Calder's The Circus, that today the Museum's collection would be unimaginable without them. As Director he worked with three generations of Whitney women to lead the monumental transition from a family-run institution to the preeminent Museum that it is today. For Tom, the goal was to bring the best of American Art to the broadest possible public. He expanded the Museum's Branch program to include Philip Morris, Champion International, and the Equitable Center and established the National Committee, a patron group that brought together collectors from all over the country. He also conceived the idea and began the drive to expand the Whitney that recently got underway with groundbreaking on its future downtown building. We were pleased and honored that he joined us for this historic occasion. Much of what Whitney is today and what it will become in the future is a part of his legacy. With his broad smile and characteristic bow ties, Tom was a larger than life personality whose ebullience was infectious. He was a respected colleague as well as a mentor to so many in the Museum world. All who love American art, and all who are devoted to artists of our time are indebted to Tom. We will truly miss him. Our most sincere and heartfelt sympathies to his wife Bunty, his sister Susan, his children Thomas, Amory, Eliot, and Whitney, his seven grandchildren and his many friends and loved ones.

2011-06-23T00:00:00Z,"8 P.M. (13) LUCIA DI LAMMERMOOR The French soprano Natalie Dessay reprises the role of Donizetti's fragile heroine, driven to madness, in this revival of the production by Mary Zimmerman originally presented by the Metropolitan Opera in 2007. Joseph Calleja (above with Ms. Dessay) plays her lover, Edgardo; Ludovic Tézier is Enrico, the villainous brother who forces Lucia into an arranged marriage for his own gain; and Kwangchul Youn is the chaplain Raimondo. Patrick Summers, the music director of Houston Grand Opera, conducts; Renée Fleming hosts. ''There is an empty space where Lucia ought to be,'' Zachary Woolfe wrote in The New York Times about this production, shown in movie theaters on March 19 and presented here by ''Great Performances at the Met.'' ''Ms. Dessay and Ms. Zimmerman have clearly, carefully considered every motion,'' he continued, ''and the result is a Lucia almost entirely blank. The main consideration seems to have been avoiding going over the top, being too 'operatic.' But in this version Lucia -- that supremely expressive Romantic character, the one who weeps, swoons, trembles and is often, as the libretto describes, simply 'beside herself with misery and fear' in a work dominated by passions and blood -- is so internal that the audience perceives her only as indifferent and detached.'' But he called Mr. Calleja ''sensationally ardent.'' 3:30 P.M. (IFC) AWAY FROM HER (2007) Fiona and Grant, a long-married couple played by Julie Christie, left, in an Oscar-nominated role, and Gordon Pinsent, confront Alzheimer's disease in the feature directorial debut from Sarah Polley, who also earned an Oscar nomination for her screenplay, based on an Alice Munro short story. ''There is, in Ms. Munro's mature work, a flinty wisdom about heterosexual love, a skepticism about romantic ideals that does not altogether deny their power or necessity,'' A. O. Scott wrote in The Times. ''Ms. Polley, rather remarkably for someone still in her 20s, shows an intuitive grasp of this wisdom and a welcome, unsentimental interest in the puzzles and pleasures of a long, imperfect marriage.'' He added, ''I can't remember the last time the movies yielded up a love story so painful, so tender and so true.''"
2011-06-23T00:00:00Z,"The Philadelphia Orchestra, which in April filed for protection under Chapter 11 of the bankruptcy laws, said on Wednesday it has drummed up $27.5 million in pledges and donations as part of its search for financial stability. Most of the money -- $16.3 million - came in the form of challenge grants that must be met by the end of the year. Gifts and promised gifts came from several local foundations and members of the orchestra's board. The donors include the William Penn Foundation, Wyncote Foundation and Neubauer Family Foundation, the orchestra said. Management sought reorganization under Chapter 11 two months ago and announced a plan to reduce subscription concerts by 15 percent, put international touring on hold and play some lighter fare. Fund-raising for the challenge grants would go alongside its regular campaign for donations, the orchestra said. Management has announced a five-year plan that includes raising $100 million in endowment money and $60 million for artistic purposes."
2011-06-23T00:00:00Z,SPORTS An article on Friday about the Boston Bruins' victory over Vancouver in the Stanley Cup finals erroneously attributed a distinction to the Canucks in their Game 7 loss. They became the first team in a Stanley Cup finals to lose Game 7 in a shutout on home ice; they were not the first team to do so in any N.H.L. playoff series. (The Colorado Avalanche lost Game 7 by shutout to the visiting Edmonton Oilers in the first round of the 1998 playoffs.)

2011-06-23T00:00:00Z,"MAN-TAILORED pantsuits have made an unexpected showing for summer. There were plenty on the runways -- at Stella McCartney, at The Row -- and the look caught on for day and evening. At the C.F.D.A. awards this month, Kirsten Dunst wore a navy tuxedo by the men's-wear designer Patrik Ervell. Phoebe Philo, on hand to accept the international award, wore a sleek black suit, custom-made at Céline, with a collarless shirt. And the actress Leelee Sobieski (far right) chose a white linen suit inspired by Tom Wolfe and designed by her husband, Adam Kimmel, in his first foray into women's wear. ''It's so classic and becomes all about swag and not about showing your pretty dress,'' Ms. Sobieski said of the men's style. ''It felt clean and suave.'' Not that you need a bespoke tailor to pull off the look. Barneys has collaborated with Rag & Bone on a collection of sharp black suits, this shorts look included. And for his new line, BLK DNM, Johan Lindeberg designed spare suits with high-waist trousers in neutral shades. Unfussed-with and chic."

This bag's Star Wars-esque name reflects the dimensions (but not the thickness) of an A4 sheet of paper and is a uniquely Japanese take on the traditional laptop bag. The Wise-Walker can hold a small and light 13-inch laptop as well as any number of folders, documents or envelopes. Mini pockets hold either business cards or Japanese-style transit cards and a charming illustrated hang-tag shows that you can place devices like CD players and circa-1999 Palm Pilots into the smaller pockets."

Tom joined our board in 1991 at founder Frank Cabot's invitation, to strengthen the then-fledgling organization in our mission to preserve America's exceptional gardens. Today, the Conservancy has grown to encompass 16 major preservation projects from the Humes Japanese Stroll Garden on Long Island to the historic gardens on Alcatraz Island, an annual Open Days garden-visiting program across the country, and thousands of loyal members. Tom had tremendous respect for Conservancy staff and our network of partners, working energetically with them on a wide variety of projects to garner interest and support for garden preservation. The National Trust for Historic Preservation's recent Organizational Excellence Award to the Garden Conservancy is a tribute to his leadership. Tom's passion for the Conservancy was closely linked to his own fascination with the art of gardening. The development of his personal garden on Fishers Island and of the new glass house at its center was a creative obsession and a magnificent accomplishment. We send our deepest condolences to Bunty, Amory, Eliot, Tom, and Whitney and all his family and many friends. Francis H. Cabot, Chairman Emeritus Benjamin F. Lenhardt, Jr., Vice-Chairman Antonia F.

Perhaps because of its border-state decision to stay with the Union, Maryland and its slave-owning past are often forgotten today. And yet as the lives and scars of these two attested, slavery in rural Maryland could be as oppressive and isolated as the cotton fields of the Deep South. Swaths of white family-owned farmland were worked by thousands of enslaved people, who also worked on the water to bring back the rich catch of the Chesapeake Bay. And in no part of the state was slavery as brutal as the Eastern Shore — conditions exposed by the oddly parallel lives of these two famous Marylanders."

Sean McBride and Miss Liz Wendelbo, the duo behind Xeno & Oaklander, along with other members of the Wierd Records label, have been largely credited with the revival of minimal wave here in New York. Taryn Waldman of Boxmotion, who directed the “The Staircase,” and Patrick Stroub, its cinematographer, make references to Roman Polanski’s film “Repulsion,” as a slip of a woman, Xeno (Wendelbo), climbs the stairs of a claustrophobic 19th-century Brooklyn tenement building, seemingly unaware that the object of her affection and of her voyeurism, Oaklander (McBride), is right next to her. (Xeno’s stark, wintry eyes come courtesy of the master retoucher Pascal Dangin, known in fashion circles for his work for Annie Leibovitz, Patrick Demarchelier, Steven Meisel, Steven Klein, Craig McDean and others.)

The film, A. O. Scott wrote in The New York Times, ''acknowledges both the difficulty and the comic potential of the arrangement, and does so with enough insight and charm to make you wonder why frequent-flier love is not a more popular theme in romantic comedies,'' even though the scenario ''sounds kind of sad, even dreary.'' He added: ''Happy solutions to intractable problems are what romantic comedies are supposed to supply, of course, and while 'Going the Distance' hardly breaks the generic mold, it has enough honesty and charm to set it apart from most other recent examples.'' 10:30 A.M. (13) RELIGION & ETHICS NEWSWEEKLY Deborah Potter explores the separation of church and state in France and the modern manifestations of the country's secularism, including the prohibition of public displays of religious beliefs and the recent ban on veils worn by some Muslim women.

River Road Entertainment, which has previously produced features like ''The Tree of Life'' and ''Fair Game,'' said that it is developing a film about Mr. Wilson, who with his brothers, Dennis and Carl, and Mike Love and Al Jardine formed the Beach Boys in 1961. That band's groovy hits include ''Surfin' U.S.A.'' and ''Good Vibrations,'' as well as the album-length mini-masterpiece ''Pet Sounds.'' River Road Entertainment said in a statement that its film would ''take an unconventional look at Wilson's unique musical process as well as his struggles with mental illness, and how he managed to persevere as an artist with the love and support of his wife Melinda.'' The company has secured the musician's life rights for the project, and Oren Moverman, the director and co-writer of ''The Messenger,'' will write its screenplay.

The marriage bill, whose fate was uncertain until moments before the vote, was approved 33 to 29 in a packed but hushed Senate chamber.

But it can also affect the rates you pay for car insurance - sometimes quite significantly, when the savings are measured over time. The most important factors in setting rates generally are your age, where you live and driving record, says Des Toups, senior managing editor of CarInsurance.com, a rate-quoting Web site. But most insurers also check your credit when quoting a rate, because there's a correlation between your score and the likelihood you will file an insurance claim. The higher the score, the less likely you are to file one."

2011-06-26T00:00:00Z,"TOMITA--Iwao. It is with deep sadness that the firm of Deloitte Touche Tohmatsu LLC (hereafter Tohmatsu), the Japanese member firm of Deloitte Touche Tohmatsu Limited, announces the death of Iwao Tomita. He died on June 6, 2011, in Tokyo, surrounded by his family. One of the founding partners of the Japanese public accounting firm Tohmatsu, Mr. Tomita was 86 years old. He was a respected partner of Tohmatsu, and later a senior advisor to Deloitte Touche Tohmatsu International. In a final message to his family and colleagues, he said, ""My mission is accomplished."" That mission was to establish Tohmatsu as the leading public accounting firm in Japan, not only in size but also in professional standards and quality of service. One of Mr. Tomita's proudest moments was when Deloitte Haskins & Sells merged with Touche Ross in 1990, and the two international firms invited Tohmatsu to join them as an equal to form Deloitte Ross Tohmatsu International, which changed to Deloitte Touche Tohmatsu International in 1990. At the time, J. Michael Cook, chairman and CEO of Deloitte & Touche in the United States, referred to Tohmatsu as the crown jewel of the international organization. ""We have had no more global citizen, and no one more committed to our global organization. Tomita deserves significant credit for the global growth of our services for Japanese headquartered companies,"" said Jim Quigley, global CEO of DTTL until May 31, 2011. Quoted in a history of the Japanese firm published in 1995, Edward Kangas, then chairman of Deloitte Touche Tohmatsu International, said, ""Tomita-san has been a man of vision, a man who proposed practical implementation of his vision and a very good friend."" Many people are visionaries and strategists, but they can't translate their ideas into action. Tomita-san has an incredible capacity to translate his strategy and vision into action in a powerful way."" In 1967, the Deputy Minister of Finance asked Mr. Tomita to organize the first nationwide public accounting firm. It was to be established to accomplish two main objectives: the first, to be capable of reporting to the Securities and Exchange Commission in the United States according to U.S. accounting standards; the second, to establish offices overseas. He allied himself with former Admiral Nobuzo Tohmatsu to found Tohmatsu in 1968. Three years later, Mr. Tohmatsu withdrew from the business due to an incapacitating stroke; Mr. Tomita continued pursuing their original goal of making a truly international accounting firm for Japan. Mr. Tomita later succeeded to the position of chief executive officer. In 1975, Tohmatsu became a member firm of Touche Ross International, and Mr. Tomita was asked to join the international Board of Governors. The alliance meant that, rather than establish separate offices as it had done in New York, Tohmatsu would instead send forth a wave of professionals to be assigned to Touche Ross offices worldwide, coinciding with the rise of the Japanese economy. What began as a firm with a few offices in Japan is today an organization with a workforce of over 6000, including 658 partners, and professionals posted on long-term assignments to more than 40 locations outside Japan where they serve the unique needs of Japanese companies operating overseas. Today, the founders' goal is realized: Tohmatsu is one of the largest and the most international professional services firm in Japan. From the founding of the firm, Mr. Tomita traveled extensively to establish Tohmatsu's presence abroad, beginning in San Francisco and quickly spreading throughout the Americas, Europe and Asia. Until months before his death, Mr. Tomita kept up a heavy travel schedule, averaging 150 days annually outside Japan. In the past decade he increased his efforts in Asia, where he saw the most growth potential. His ability to see and shape the future led him to send a Tohmatsu professional to the People's Republic of China as early as 1979 to start the long process of establishing an office in Beijing. Wherever he traveled, he met with Tohmatsu professionals assigned overseas, to offer advice and encouragement. ""Tomita-san's extraordinary vision and courage as a founding partner of our Deloitte Japan Tohmatsu member firm and his global mindshare in his actions over many decades is a lesson for us all in As One behavior long before we termed this vision. We will miss his presence though will reap the benefits of his legacy for many years to come,"" said Barry Salzberg, global CEO, Deloitte Touche Tohmatsu Limited. Mr. Tomita was preceded in death by Yoko Tajima Tomita, his wife of 54 years. He is survived by three daughters; eight grandchildren; and four great-grandchildren. Funeral services were held June 10 at St. Ignatius Church in Tokyo. A memorial service will take place Tuesday, July 5, 2011, in Tokyo from 11:00am to 1:00pm at the Imperial Hotel ""Fuji No Ma."""

2011-06-26T00:00:00Z,"MILLER--Robert Peter, 72, who supported the careers of many significant contemporary artists, died from complications arising from a staph infection on June 22nd in Miami, Florida with his children by his side. He had been in poor health for many years and had retired to Florida more than a decade ago to paint for his own pleasure and spend time swimming and collecting. In the early 1960s shortly after earning a MFA degree in painting from Rutgers University, Mr. Miller moved to Manhattan at the urging of Roy Lichtenstein, for whom he had been a teaching assistant, and Lee Krasner, for whom he had been a studio assistant, intending to pursue a career as a painter. During this period he had two exhibitions at Martha Jackson Gallery, however, these were not commercially successful and he became focused on promoting the work of other artists. By 1966 he was a director at Andre Emmerich Gallery working with such artists as his friend David Hockney and eventually became a partner there. In 1977 he and his wife, Sarah Wittenborn Miller, opened the Robert Miller Gallery Inc. at 724 Fifth Avenue. Within a few years the gallery moved to the second floor at 41 East 57th Street. During these years he developed enduring friendships as well as working relationships with Robert Mapplethorpe, Rodrigo Moynihan, Alex Katz, Bruce Weber, Al Held, Lee Krasner, Patti Smith and Milton Resnick. Perhaps his most important contribution to the arts was his support of underrepresented voices in contemporary art, particularly those of female artists and open homosexuals. It is a testament to his dedication that many of these artists have now joined the 20th century canon and that the difficulty of their art within the historic context it was originally presented in has been forgotten. He established an international reputation working directly with some of the most important and influential artists of the last three decades such as Louise Bourgeois, Gilbert and George, Yayoi Kusama, David Hockney, Leon Kossoff, Lee Krasner, Robert Mapplethorpe, Joan Mitchell, Alice Neel, Georgia O'Keeffe, Patti Smith, Andy Warhol, and Tom Wesselmann, and with the estates of Diane Arbus, Eva Hesse and Jean-Michel Basquiat. He was a man of eclectic tastes; he loved to find unusual objects at flea markets as well to collect what he believed to be important art, antiquities and cultural artifacts. Over the years Mr. Miller became increasingly disenchanted with the changing art world and the speculation in art that he thought made it difficult for young artists to maintain their integrity and brought many older artists bitterness. In 1988 he said, One of the things that people equate with art's being of interest is that it so expensive... Perception and possession have so little to do with each other. You cannot possess much of the great art of the world, but you can perceive it, particularly through reading. With all the increased art activity, people are reading less and that opportunity to perceive is slipping away. So what people do is they seize the art, in order to think they have it. Miller painted throughout his life. He showed his work at Martha Jackson Gallery 1965, Nicole Klagsbrun Gallery, 1999, Dorothy Blau Gallery, Miami, 2000, Dorsch Gallery, Miami, 2001 and J.Johnson Gallery, Jacksonville, 2003. Robert Peter Miller was born in New Jersey on April 17, 1939. He is survived by his children, Robert Peter Miller Jr. Sarah Elizabeth Miller, Christopher Richard Miller, and a grandson, Alden Miller Gaussoin all of Manhattan and two brothers, Alfred Peter Miller III and Paul Joseph Miller.

But, at less than two hours by car from Lisbon, an overnight visit to the storied Portuguese city of Évora and the surrounding area packs a lot into relatively little time. To start, there is the stunning combination of Roman, Gothic and Baroque architecture for which Évora has been designated a Unesco World Heritage Site. But there are many other aspects to the city, which is a bit like its churches -- seemingly staid and whitewashed on the outside until you step inside to discover sumptuous interiors adorned with gleaming gold leaf and thousands of dazzling tiles."

While there have been defeats, and the Grad rockets of Colonel Qaddafi's forces still menace the outskirts of Nalut near the Tunisian border and Yafran to the east, rebels point hopefully to the growing stability of the towns under their control as evidence of how tenuous Colonel Qaddafi's grip may be."

Now the spring men's shows are under way, and though Mr. Galliano, looking thin and barely audible, was on trial this week, there was virtually no discussion in the front row about him or the racial-insult case. One reason is that the editors and writers who cover men's wear are less familiar with Mr. Galliano than those on the women's side. True, the Galliano brand sells men's clothing (a show by the design team will be presented tonight), but he is best known for his women's fashion at Dior, which transformed a decidedly stodgy French label."

The driver was a young, husky guy with mirrored shades, a faint goatee and a phone pressed to the side of his head. The car was painted in bright colors with the Google logo, and jutting upward from the roof was a small tower on which sat a bright red ball that contained a camera. It looked like a giant penis with an eye. I was on my Vespa, and I pulled over. The car crossed State Street and headed up Camp, toward Audubon Park. California plates. I took out my iPhone, turned on the camera and pursued. The adrenaline that coursed through me contained a mixture of surprise, excitement and hostility.

''The situation that City Opera now finds itself in cannot be blamed on its attempt to bring adventurous programming to 'the people.' The blame is on New York City's so-called leaders who don't care about opera, or classical music. Germany supports some 78 opera houses that all do what we would call wild productions, where the thought behind the voice is considered more important than luscious high notes. The problem lies with closed-minded audiences and uncaring official leaders.''"

2011-06-26T00:00:00Z,"EVER since I discovered mulberries growing in a park in Flushing, Queens, on the day of my grandmother's death two years ago, the delight of finding summer berries has been bittersweet for me. Last week, I was having another difficult day when my fiancé and I took a walk in Central Park to search for the linden trees, which I thought would be in full bloom and would make a lovely tea. But our most recent heat wave had spurred an early flowering, and when we arrived in the area I call ''Linden Hill,'' the creamy-colored blossoms were already browning with age. Disappointed, we walked toward the road to look at the juneberry trees. The week before, the berries had been small and whitish-green, but when we arrived, the trees' branches were heavy with thick clusters of pink and reddish-violet fruit, ripe for plucking. A small European starling landed on an upper branch and grabbed a rose-colored berry in its beak."

The Boston Globe reported that after a lengthy investigation into the work, an oil portrait by the Dutch painter Eglon van der Neer, the museum determined that it had belonged to Walter Westfeld, who had run a German gallery shut down by the Nazis in 1936 and who was sent to Auschwitz in 1943. The museum, which purchased the painting in 1941, posted an image of it online in 2000 amid concerns about its provenance; in 2004 it was contacted by Fred Westfield, a nephew of the art dealer. Mr. Westfield, a retired economics professor in Tennessee, learned about the painting from a Google search. The Globe said that the museum had in recent years returned other works stolen during World War II. It also fought a legal battle to keep the Oskar Kokoschka painting “Two Nudes (Lovers)”; a federal appeals court ruled last year that it was the rightful owner of this work."

2011-06-27T00:00:00Z,"The president of the cable channel AMC said he didn't regret the cliffhanger ending of ''The Killing'' a week ago but admitted there was a lesson to be learned. ''We underestimated the passion'' viewers have for closure within a season, Charlie Collier told Entertainment Weekly on Friday. ''If I could do anything differently, it would be to manage expectations.'' Many fans of ''The Killing'' (with Mireille Enos, above), which is about an investigation into the death of a teenage girl in Seattle, were left fuming when the first season ended on June 19 without an explanation for the crime. The anger was noticeable on social media Web sites, prompting Mr. Collier's acknowledgment. ''The audience has an important voice, we heard them and don't take them for granted,'' he said. Mr. Collier said he stood by the show's executive producer, Veena Sud, who told The Hollywood Reporter last week that the investigation would be resolved in Season 2. Ms. Sud recounted a conversation on one Web site that had a viewer declaring, ''I'll never ever come back for season two.'' She said, ''On the same thread three more people popped up and said: 'I haven't watched this show yet, but now I will because you guys are so emotional about it, it's gotta be something to watch.' So that's a great thing.''"

2011-06-27T00:00:00Z,"Pixar's ''Cars 2'' overcame surprisingly negative critical reviews to overperform at the weekend box office, selling an estimated $68 million at North American theaters. That No. 1 finish extends Pixar's perfect box-office track record - all 12 of its feature films have opened in first place. How sales hold up, however, will be watched carefully. ''Cars 2,'' directed by John Lasseter, chief creative officer at Pixar, represents an end to the studio's perfect critical track record; only about 34 percent of reviews were positive, according to RottenTomatoes.com, by far the worst for any Pixar title. The R-rated comedy ''Bad Teacher'' (Sony Pictures Entertainment) was a stronger-than-expected second with about $31 million in ticket sales - a result that cements mega-raunchy films as one of Hollywood's best performers of the moment. ''Green Lantern'' (Warner Brothers) fell 65 percent in its second weekend to third place, taking in about $18.4 million for a new total of $89 million, according to Hollywood.com, which compiles ticketing statistics. ''Super 8'' (Paramount Pictures) continued to show strength in its third weekend, selling about $12 million for a new total of $95 million. ''Mr. Popper's Penguins'' (20th Century Fox) was fifth with about $10.3 million for a two-week total of $39.4 million. Over all, ticket sales for the weekend stood at $176 million, an increase of 7 percent over the same weekend last year. Ticket sales for the year are down about 8 percent."
2011-06-27T00:00:00Z,"Dozens of new restrictions passed by states this year have chipped away at the right to abortion by requiring women to view ultrasounds, imposing waiting periods or cutting funds for clinics. But a new kind of law has gone beyond such restrictions, striking at the foundation of the abortion rules set out by the Supreme Court over the last four decades. These laws, passed in six states in little more than a year, ban abortions at the 20th week after conception, based on the theory that the fetus can feel pain at that point -- a notion disputed by mainstream medical organizations in the United States and Britain. Opponents of abortion say they expect that discussion of fetal pain -- even in the face of scientific criticism -- will alter public perception of abortion, and they have made support for the new laws a litmus test for Republicans seeking the presidency."

''What there isn't, as usual, is much in the way of good acting, with the decisive and impressive exception of Ms. Stewart, who can carry a close-up about as well as anyone in movies today.''

The Boston Globe reported that after a lengthy investigation into the work, an oil portrait by the Dutch painter Eglon van der Neer, the museum determined that it had belonged to Walter Westfeld, who had run a German gallery shut down by the Nazis in 1936 and who was sent to Auschwitz in 1943. The museum, which purchased the painting in 1941, posted an image of it online in 2000 amid concerns about its provenance; in 2004 it was contacted by Fred Westfield, a nephew of the art dealer. Mr. Westfield, a retired economics professor in Tennessee, learned about the painting from a Google search. The Globe said that the museum had in recent years returned other works stolen during World War II. It also fought a legal battle to keep the Oskar Kokoschka painting ''Two Nudes (Lovers)''; a federal appeals court ruled last year that it was the rightful owner of this work. This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print."

It is the fourth consecutive World Cup in which the teams have been drawn into the same first-round group.

2011-06-28T00:00:00Z,"NYMAN--Lawrence (Larry). A good man has died. A wise man has died. A courageous man has died. Lawrence (Larry) Nyman succumbed at age 85 on June 27, 2011 after a lengthy bout with prostate cancer, just shy of his 24th wedding anniversary. Larry was a generous friend and colleague, a most loving husband, father, and grandfather. A professor of psychology at City College of New York for 39 years, Dr. Nyman specialized in family therapy and maintained a clinical practice. Deeply interested in the roots of human behavior and in the processes of psychological and institutional change, he recorded the illustrious history of the City College Psychology Department based on interviews with notable past scholars including Gardner Murphy and Kenneth Clark, and in 1989 organized the fiftieth anniversary celebration of the Department's establishment. As part of his exploration of past accomplishments of previous faculty members, Nyman recently published an article on the life and work of Kenneth Clark, whose studies of African American children played a key role in the 1954 United States Supreme Court Brown v Board of Education decision that outlawed segregation in American public schools. To encourage continuing scholarly investigation of family process at CCNY, he established the Lawrence and Danielle Nyman award for the best yearly student project in this vital area of study.Larry was a WWII vet (a proud 1st lieutenant) and an avid athlete. He played football for Rutgers University, and received a number of tennis trophies, including one from Theix, France, given for good sportsmanship after a tough three-hour match with a man three decades younger. Larry was endowed with a multiplicity of talents. He was an astute reader of people and devoted to helping others. He was a repairer of cars, including those of his friends; a creative cook, a fixit man, a proficient gardener, an early environmentalist who taught many to garden without pesticides and to start compost heaps (he gave away many cuttings, some to strangers passing by). Larry is survived by his wife Danielle, two daughters, Tamar and Reba, a stepson Dov, and four grandchildren. Contributions in his memory may be made to the American Society for the Protection of Nature in Israel, 28 Arrandale Ave, Great Neck, NY 11024-1804.

2011-06-28T00:00:00Z,"9 P.M. (13) THE CHILD CASES When abuse is suspected in a child's death, experts are called to testify. But what happens when that testimony is considered flawed, as it was in the case of Ernie Lopez, above, who was sentenced to 60 years in prison after an infant in his care died? In this joint investigation with ProPublica and NPR, the ''Frontline'' correspondent A. C. Thompson examines more than 20 cases in which people were imprisoned based on medical evidence centered on abuse, assault and ''shaken baby syndrome'' that was later found to be unreliable. In other segments Martin Smith investigates for-profit colleges that aggressively recruit veterans from Iraq and Afghanistan. And Atul Gawande reports on Dr. Jeffrey Brenner and his team in Camden, N.J., who seek out the community's sickest and most expensive-to-treat patients in a practice called hotspotting, which is thought to reduce sharply the city's overall medical costs. In ''My Perestroika,'' presented by ''POV'' at 10 on Channel 13, and at 11 on Channel 49, Robin Hessman looks at the last generation of Soviet youth through the stories of five classmates. They go from living sheltered childhoods to experiencing the reforms enacted by President Mikhail S. Gorbachev and the chaos of the Soviet Union's dissolution to searching for their places in contemporary Moscow. 5:40 P.M. (Starz) SOLITARY MAN (2009) Michael Douglas (right, with Susan Sarandon) plays Ben Kalmen, a businessman trying to rebuild his life after cheating in his bookkeeping and on his wife (Ms. Sarandon), disappointing his daughter (Jenna Fischer) and ending up divorced and shackled by legal troubles. Now his most recent companion (Mary-Louise Parker) may want him dead. Danny DeVito plays the old college friend who takes pity on Ben; Jesse Eisenberg is the student who warily accepts him as a mentor. Writing in The New York Times, A. O. Scott said: ''The filmmakers' only misstep is to supply, early and late, a too-neat explanation for the slow-motion train wreck that Ben's life has become. But it is easy enough to ignore this lapse in the face of such unassumingly intelligent screenwriting and so much understated, brilliant acting.'' Especially that of Mr. Douglas, Mr. Scott added: ''After 'Wall Street' and 'Wonder Boys,' he could have played Ben Kalmen in his sleep, but instead he is fully alive, as engaged with the complexities of actorly portraiture as he has ever been. Ben, for all his manifold flaws, is never dishonest -- his mistake is to place a higher value on candor than he does on decency -- and Mr. Douglas never hits a false note. It may not be easy to like this solitary man. It may be impossible. But by the end of this trim and satisfying movie, you know him.''"

2011-06-28T00:00:00Z,"Engrossing storytelling is certainly among the pleasures the theater can provide. But how much story is too much story onstage, where time constraints make it harder to maintain a balance between narrative, character development and the exploration of theme? The question arose for me last week when I headed to San Francisco to review the new stage adaptation of Armistead Maupin's ''Tales of the City'' at the American Conservatory Theater. Having recently reread the novels, I was looking forward to getting reacquainted with the spirited gang whose romantic exploits Mr. Maupin chronicled with such warmth and humor in the books: the Cleveland refugee Mary Ann Singleton, her ever-on-the-prowl gay pal Michael ''Mouse'' Tolliver, their earth-mother landlady Anna Madrigal and the many other characters orbiting 28 Barbary Lane, Mrs. Madrigal's Russian Hill home. The musical's authors, Jeff Whitty (''Avenue Q'') and the songwriting team from the band Scissor Sisters, Jake Shears and John Garden, obviously have great affection for the material. In fact their affection for Mr. Maupin's books - and the ample cast of characters they contain - may have posed problems when it came time to shape the material into a single evening of musical theater."

The success of that initial effort, also replicated in the Southwest Bronx, resulted in over 200 such midwifery sponsored centers operating today with state licensure, national standards and formal accreditation available. One such center, opened in 2000 in a disadvantaged African American community of our nation's capital, has succeeded in reducing preterm birth, low birth weight infants and cesarean section, while simultaneously improving family cohesiveness and reducing the costs of care. It was Dr. Donnenfeld's early support for those childbearing families demanding the personalized care for which he was known, a homelike setting and low intervention, that provided significant support to the general acceptance of the midwifery model. He was undeterred by the reluctance of most colleagues to acknowledge his insights as to the potential and now demonstrated national benefits. Our hearts go out to his wife, Eleanor and his family.

In an interview with The Financial Times, Mr. Roth, the ornery author more than two dozen novels (the FT credits him with 53 books) including ''Portnoy's Complaint,'' ''The Human Stain'' and ''Nemesis,'' said that other people's literary inventions are no longer part of his diet. ''I've stopped reading fiction,'' he said. ''I don't read it at all. I read other things: history, biography. I don't have the same interest in fiction that I once did.'' Asked why he came to this position, Mr. Roth said: ''I don't know. I wised up.'' The Financial Times said Mr. Roth was not expected to be in London on Tuesday when he will be celebrated as the winner of the Man Booker International Prize, a literary award honoring his lifetime achievements. Carmen Callil, a former judge for that prize, probably wishes that she had the same discretion to read or not read other people's books.

The food, prepared off-site and frozen, would have been delivered to the franchise and then reheated.

Devoted husband of the late Lillian Schiowitz for 59 wonderful years, he is survived by his children Josh Schiowitz, Ellen and Keith Ellis, and his granddaughter Justine. An Osteopathic physician, Dr. Schiowitz graduated from the Philadelphia College of Osteopathic Medicine in October of 1944 at the age of 22. Over the next 35 years he worked as a Family Physician, incorporating Osteopathic manipulative medicine into his practice in his native Brooklyn. During the course of his career in Brooklyn, he held various positions in professional organizations, including serving as President of the New York State Osteopathic Medical Society. In 1966, he and several colleagues created Interboro General Hospital of which he became the Director of Medical Education from 1971 to 1977. One of the founders of the New York College of Osteopathic Medicine and first chair of the Department of Osteopathic Manipulative Medicine, Dr. Schiowitz became Dean of the school in 1992. He added duties as the Dean of the School of Allied Health and Life Science in 1995 for which he created degree programs in a variety of medical, allied fields. He is also the author of several articles as well as one of the editors of An Osteopathic Approach to Diagnosis and Treatment, a textbook in use at various Osteopathic medical colleges. He has received numerous awards, including the highest award given by the American Osteopathic Association, the Distinguished Service Certificate. After retiring in 2002, he remained active in the field by traveling around the country teaching Master classes to younger physician-colleagues already practicing the art and science of Osteopathic manipulative medicine. Stanley touched many lives. We have lost a healer, mentor, educator, wise counselor, friend, father, and grandfather. He spent his life as a humanitarian, helping others while never asking for help himself, and always going just one step more. In honor of his late wife Lillian he helped fund a lecture series concerning Jewish Women, knowing these events were just the kind of evenings Lillian would have happily attended. Memorial Service will take place on Wednesday, June 29th, 1pm, at Riverside-Nassau at 55 N. Station Plaza, Great Neck 11021.

2011-06-29T00:00:00Z,"PORGES--George Wolfgang, 74, a resident of Dallas, Texas, died in New York City on June 25, 2011, from complications of esophageal cancer. Born in Vienna, he had emigrated from Austria with his parents and brother shortly after the Anschluss, in May of 1938. His mother was a talented artist; his father was a practicing gynecologist-obstetrician. He grew up in Queens, attended Forest Hills High School, and was a graduate of Duke University. He worked for most of his adult life for Caltex Petroleum Company, beginning in 1960 and retiring in 1998. On his first expatriate assignment in Holland he met his wife Nicole (nee Margaine). Their life became an international voyage. His career moved from product engineering as a lubricant specialist, then into sales, oil trading, and finally various senior management positions with the company around the world. Early in his career he was part of the team in Korea that led to the establishment of the Caltex/LG joint venture Refining/Petrochemical company. Over the years George held a number of positions in the joint venture company ending up as General Manager of Caltex' Korean Operations. Today this company is arguably the most successful, long-lived joint venture company in Korea. He continued his involvement with Korea after retirement maintaining his membership in the US Korean Society and staying in contact with many of his Korean business associates. Interspersed with foreign assignments in Tokyo, Seoul, and Singapore were years of living in Dallas, New York City and summers in Connecticut. He and his friends from Caltex took many vacations sampling the world's best golf and ski resorts. George was charming and gregarious, liked and respected by all who knew him. Following a protracted illness, his wife Nicole predeceased him by less than three months. He is survived by his brother Robert and wife Felicia, his nephew John and wife Alexandra, their sons Dylan and David, and his niece Vicki and husband Joe Eisner, and their children Erin and Jesse, all in New York. Contributions may be made in George's memory to the NYU Langone Medical Center at 550 First Ave., New York City or to Duke University. A memorial gathering is planned in Dallas."

But after playing the sinister Severus Snape in the final installment of that boy-wizard franchise this summer, Mr. Rickman will next be portraying another in his long line of memorable creeps in ''Seminar,'' a new play by Theresa Rebeck that will open on Broadway in the fall. ''Seminar,'' a dark comedy, casts Mr. Rickman as Leonard, a legendary author who provides private instruction to four promising young writers. But, as a news release for the production says ominously, ''as Leonard deems some students more promising than others, tensions arise. Sex is used as a weapon, alliances are made and broken, and it's not just the wordplay that turns vicious.''"

The exhibition, ''Shipwrecked: Tang Treasures and Monsoon Winds,'' was tentatively scheduled for next spring at the Freer Gallery of Art and Arthur M. Sackler Gallery, the Smithsonian's Asian art museums. A museum spokeswoman, Deborah Galyan, said that the earliest the museum might mount a ''Shipwrecked'' exhibit now would be 2013, a delay that she said would give the museums' director, Julian Raby, who also curated the exhibition, time to address some of the archeologists' concerns. The exhibition was conceived by the government of Singapore, which bought the artifacts for $32 million from the company that salvaged them from a wreck off the coast of Indonesia. It is currently on view at the ArtScience museum at the Marina Bay Sands resort and casino in Singapore. The salvage company has said it mined the artifacts quickly to avoid looting.

2011-06-30T10:59:58Z,"When it comes to motion pictures, Charlie Chaplin is the man, no? Well, an all-but-forgotten short film featuring footage of the comic star failed to sell at a London auction, defying expectations that it might fetch a six-figure sum, Reuters reported. The reserve price on the film at Wednesday’s sale was £100,000 ($160,000) at Bonhams auctioneers, but apparently that was too high. “Charlie Chaplin in ‘Zepped,’ ” is believed to be a propaganda film made in Britain during World War I. A collector discovered the seven-minute short inside an old film reel tin and bought it in 2009 for £3.20 (about $5) on the online auction site eBay. The film shows Chaplin taking on a German Zeppelin aircraft and features some of the earliest animation in film history. Chaplin probably never knew of the movie’s existence, said the film critic and Chaplin biographer David Robinson, according to Reuters. Mr. Robinson said an anonymous filmmaker had put together outtakes from three earlier Chaplin pictures — “His New Profession” (1914), “A Jitney Elopement” (1915) and “The Tramp” (1915) — and included sequences of stop-motion animation and other effects. Chaplin was not involved in the production of “Zepped,” but famously satirized Adolf Hitler in the 1940 movie “The Great Dictator.”"

At Ricardo Rojas, one of the few salons offering Platinum, that fee includes color match, installation, cut and styling. I tried them out last week and Rojas, whose clients include Eva Longoria and Bar Rafaeli, told it to me straight: “You don’t need these.” But now that I have them, I know why women become addicted.

The center, designed by Renzo Piano, includes a 42-acre park, the headquarters for the National Library of Greece and a 1,400-seat opera house for the Greek National Opera. Budgeted at more than $800 million, the project is to be financed by the Stavros Niarchos Foundation. Construction, to begin later this year, is to be completed in 2015. The center's design is inspired by the Acropolis, with the park rising gradually to a summit where a ''reading room'' with glass walls will provide views of the city and the Aegean Sea. Under the reading room, the main library is to house more than two million books, and the opera house will mount a variety of concerts, ballets and musicals. The center's operations are to be run and paid for by the Greek government, raising obvious questions about center's future, given the current debt crisis. Andreas C. Dracopoulos, a co-president of the foundation's board of directors, wrote in an e-mail that the project is ''a good example of a public-private partnership where the State has made available the land, our Foundation has taken the full financial responsibility to build and deliver the project, and then upon delivery it will be wholly transferable to the State so that the people and society at large can enjoy it.'' Of the risk posed by the government's financial troubles, he said only that the group is ''closely working with all related parties to make sure that all operational and organizational issues are taken into account so that our finished product can be one of efficiency, viability and sustainability.''"

2011-06-30T00:00:00Z,"Over the last half-century, Barbie has come in about as many guises and get-ups as Inspector Clouseau: cheerleader, supermodel, ski queen, doctor, astronaut, lawyer. Last year, Mattel, the doll's maker, released ''Mad Men'' versions, giving Barbie a pile of fire-red hair and a fetching office-girl dress in her Joan Holloway incarnation. Now, high art is taking a turn at a makeover. Three Barbies have just been released, inspired by great paintings, Tablet Magazine reported. One takes a crack at Mona Lisa -- a long overdue role for Barbie -- though the doll itself, with heavy eyeliner and a shower of curls, looks more like a model in an ad for a Renaissance fair. Another doll is inspired by Van Gogh's ''Starry Night,'' a painting that does not happen to feature a woman, so the Barbie is simply a blonde with a ''Starry Night''-print strapless gown.Undoubtedly the strangest of the three is the Barbie based on Gustav Klimt's ''Portrait of Adele Bloch I,'' the Viennese Secessionist masterpiece that Ronald Lauder bought for what some reported to be $135 million in 2006, one of the highest prices ever paid for an artwork. The Barbie, with a winged hairdo and a dress that gets the dazzling Byzantine mosaic pattern from the painting almost right -- minus Klimt's gold-leaf -- goes for $34.95."

2011-07-01T15:37:25Z,"I discovered Dan Savage, the subject of my cover story this weekend, in 2004, when I became editor of the alternative weekly paper in New Haven. I did not know much about alt weeklies, and to get ideas I looked around for some of the best. Somebody said I had to check out The Stranger, the bigger of Seattle’s two alt weeklies. So I e-mailed the editor, who was this Dan Savage guy. I figured that couldn’t be his real name; it was probably some alt weekly stunt. But “Dan Savage” sent me a bunch of issues, and the paper was brilliant: smart, good-looking, edgy. Inside, the editor wrote a really good sex column called Savage Love, and I asked my publisher if we could drop our syndicated sex column and replace it with Savage Love. “Can’t,” he said. “Too dirty. People would object.” That was about all I knew of Dan Savage for the next couple years, although occasionally I would see links to Savage’s work on Andrew Sullivan’s blog."

A week of free time in Europe is no longer regarded by publications with the joie de vivre of the past, so I usually split the time between work and pleasure.

The group, published by DC Comics, has had a bit of a confounding history. The Legion was created in 1958. They were time travelers from the future who had traveled to the past to meet their heroic inspiration: Superboy. Cut to 1985 when DC published Crisis on Infinite Earths, a limited series intended to streamline the decades of convoluted continuity of its heroes. It was decided that Superman never had costumed adventures as a youth, so the reason for the Legion’s founding had to be reconsidered. A lot of stories were crafted to give them a new reason for forming – until it was decided, 20 years later when DC published Infinite Crisis – that Superman did have a career as Superboy so the Legion could be inspired by him."

(TCM) STAR OF THE MONTH: SINGING COWBOYS Turner Classic Movies celebrates the tuneful heroes of the Wild West -- the cowpokes like Gene Autry and Roy Rogers (above) who could ride, shoot and slug it out with the best of them before sliding out of the saddle, grabbing a guitar and serenading listeners with ballads like ''Tumbling Tumbleweeds'' and ''Happy Trails.'' Not every tough guy was up to the job. John Wayne once said, according to TCM, that the most embarrassing moment of his career took place during the filming of ''Riders of Destiny'' (1933) when executives at Monogram Pictures insisted he sit by a tree, move his lips and pretend to sing while a hidden warbler named Bill Bradbury did the actual crooning. This 26-movie tribute, shown on Fridays in July, kicks off with three classics starring Rogers; his wife, Dale Evans; and Rogers's golden palomino, Trigger: ''Cowboy and the Senorita'' (1944), about outlaws who conceal a gold mine's true value from the man who inherited it; ''Don't Fence Me In'' (1945), about a female reporter who travels west to dig up the truth about a long-dead bandit, at 9:30; and ''My Pal Trigger'' (1946), at 10:45, in which a cowboy fights to clear his name after he is accused of shooting a friend's horse. 8 P.M.

2011-07-01T00:00:00Z,"KRUGMAN--Dorothy C.,88, passed away peacefully, with her family by her side, on June 30, 2011 in Stamford, CT. Born in New Bedford, MA., Dorothy spent most her childhood in the Bronx and received a BS in Psychology CCNY in 1942, having been one of the first women liberal arts students at the Uptown Campus. She received an M.S.Ed. from Teachers College and worked during the war as a mental health counselor in various locations in Texas and Florida, where her husband was stationed. After the war she resumed her studies and earned a Ph.D. in psychology from Columbia University. She spent the next 50 years teaching and helping others in the field of child psychology, and working with foster children, foster parents, and staff at all of the major adoption agencies in the New York City area. Involved in dancing and the arts since her high school years, Dorothy became involved with and was eventually a board member for the New Dance Group Studio in Manhattan and the Joyce Trisler Danscompany. She took class at the Studio for many years, and went on pointe for the first time at the age of 48. Moving from Manhattan to Stamford in the 1970s, she became an active supporter of the Connecticut Ballet, acting as board member, donor, costumer, and all-around assistant for her great friend and company director Brett Raphael. Her work with the company continued until the day she died. The company gave her great joy, and its current growth and success are the culmination of three decades of devoted labor. In 1942, Dorothy married her college sweetheart, Herb Krugman, and she spent the next 69 years with him in a marriage based on deep love, mutual respect, and support for each other and their own individual endeavors. She is survived by her loving familyher husband, her son Ed, daughter-in-law Ethel Klein, daughter Laura, and son-in-law Rick Culley. She will also be greatly missed by her four grandsons, Aaron Krugman and Paul, Luke, and Alex Culley. Funeral Services will be held on Sunday, July 3, at 11:30, at The Riverside, Amsterdam and 76th. There will be a memorial performance on a date to be announced at the Connecticut Ballet studio, 20 Acosta St. in Stamford. In lieu of flowers, donations may be made to the Connecticut Ballet."
2011-07-01T00:00:00Z,"So much about the jazz bassist Ben Williams and his working band, Sound Effect, pushes a contemporary currency. There's the matter-of-fact way they engage with pop, and especially funk. There's the evident commitment to a group sound. There's the look: stylish but not dandyish, trying not to care too much. And finally there's the rhetoric. Mr. Williams has said repeatedly that with his debut release, just out on Concord, he wanted to reflect the sound of today; he titled the album ''State of Art.'' All of which is fine -- and a little puzzling, once you really deal with the music. On Wednesday night at Harlem Stage Gatehouse, in an engaging and admirably poised performance, Mr. Williams and crew kept evoking the flavor of a distinct moment in jazz and pop: the mid-1990s, when most of them were still in grade school."

2011-07-01T00:00:00Z,"The ethical judgments of the Supreme Court justices became an important issue in the just completed term. The court cannot maintain its legitimacy as guardian of the rule of law when justices behave like politicians. Yet, in several instances, justices acted in ways that weakened the court's reputation for being independent and impartial. Justices Antonin Scalia and Samuel Alito Jr., for example, appeared at political events. That kind of activity makes it less likely that the court's decisions will be accepted as nonpartisan judgments. Part of the problem is that the justices are not bound by an ethics code. At the very least, the court should make itself subject to the code of conduct that applies to the rest of the federal judiciary."

2011-07-01T00:00:00Z,"Effectively ending a two-year dispute, Brandeis University announced on Thursday that it had settled a lawsuit brought by supporters of the university's Rose Art Museum who went to court to prevent Brandeis from exploring a sale of the museum's art works in order to shore up the university's finances. In January 2009, during the depths of the economic recession, Brandeis's trustees voted to ''transition'' the museum -- founded in 1961 and one of the most important collections in the New England, with works by de Kooning, Warhol, Lichtenstein and others -- into a teaching center and gallery, and to conduct ''an orderly sale or other disposition'' of its works to raise money. Later that year Brandeis backed away from the decision, saying that no works would be sold in the immediate future and that the building would remain open as an art study center, but not as a public museum. Still, the action prompted widespread criticism, and four of the museum's benefactors, Jonathan Lee, Meryl Rose, Lois Foster and Gerald Fineberg, sued to stop any art sales. The Massachusetts attorney general's office also began an investigation of the propriety of the Brandeis plan."

2011-07-02T00:00:00Z,"Tim Pawlenty, the former governor of Minnesota, will report raising $4.2 million for his presidential campaign during the fund-raising period that ended on Thursday, his campaign announced Friday afternoon. But the campaign would not release a breakdown showing how much of that money is earmarked for a general election campaign. Since general election money raised now will not be available to Mr. Pawlenty until and unless he wins the Republican nomination, it remained unclear on Friday just how much cash the candidate actually has to spend in the Republican primary.People close to Mr. Pawlenty's campaign had suggested early in the week that he would report under $5 million raised. The campaign did not release any figures Friday indicating how much Mr. Pawlenty spent in the period, but it suggested that his cash on hand was comparable to that of past Republican candidates who won early primaries and caucuses.''Governor Pawlenty will report that his campaign has raised about $4.2 million and begins the third quarter with more available cash-on-hand than the Republicans who won the Iowa caucuses and New Hampshire primary had in July 2007,'' said Alex Conant, a Pawlenty spokesman, in a statement.For the record: By the end of June 2007, Mike Huckabee, the former Arkansas governor who went on to win the Iowa caucus the following year, had a total of $436,190 in cash on hand, according to the Federal Election Commission. At the same point in the race, Senator John McCain, who won the New Hampshire primary in 2008 and later the Republican nomination, had a total of $1,439,781.68 in cash on hand after subtracting its debt."

The drug, sodium pentobarbital, a barbiturate, has become a substitute drug for many states in light of shortages of a similar drug, sodium thiopental. ''We can't make guarantees'' that prisons will not circumvent the sales controls, he said, but ''we are confident that our new distribution program will play a substantial role in restricting prisons' access'' to the drug. Maya Foa, an investigator with the anti-death-penalty group Reprieve, said the move shows that ''any company manufacturing execution drugs and refusing to take such steps will therefore be directly complicit in executions.''"

2011-07-02T00:00:00Z,"When it comes to motion pictures, Charlie Chaplin is the man, no? Well, an all-but-forgotten short film featuring footage of the comic star failed to sell at a London auction, defying expectations that it might fetch a six-figure sum, Reuters reported. The reserve price on the film at Wednesday's sale was 100,000 ($160,000) at Bonhams auctioneers, but apparently that was too high. ''Charlie Chaplin in 'Zepped,' '' is believed to be a propaganda film made in Britain during World War I. A collector discovered the seven-minute short inside an old film reel tin and bought it in 2009 for 3.20 (about $5) on the online auction site eBay. The film shows Chaplin taking on a German Zeppelin aircraft and features some of the earliest animation in film history. Chaplin probably never knew of the movie's existence, said the film critic and Chaplin biographer David Robinson, according to Reuters. Mr. Robinson said an anonymous filmmaker had put together outtakes from three earlier Chaplin pictures -- ''His New Profession'' (1914), ''A Jitney Elopement'' (1915) and ''The Tramp'' (1915) -- and included sequences of stop-motion animation and other effects. Chaplin was not involved in the production of ''Zepped,'' but famously satirized Adolf Hitler in the 1940 movie ''The Great Dictator.'' This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print."

But while an official number from the Environmental Protection Agency and the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration is not expected until September, the reported standard has prompted intense jockeying among automakers and environmental groups and has again put a focus on California. In 2009, the state tabled its clean-car mandates to adopt a fleet-average standard set by the federal government for 2012-16.

Her forthcoming gig playing the quintessential cougar and not-so-nice mom Mrs. Robinson in ''The Graduate,'' at the Cape Playhouse on Cape Cod, is a wholly different job, of course, but then Ms. Richardson is a different actor today. ''I've had so many horrible things happen in my life since I did 'Home Improvement' that it's worried me about doing comedy because, how do I say this, I'm a much darker person than I was,'' she said from her home in Los Angeles, a few days before heading to the East Coast. ''I've lost my mother, I've lost my father. I just lost my brother-in-law in January. There's been a lot of grief and loss.'' Nowadays, she said, bleaker comedy suits her just fine."

It was 2008, she had been dancing with the troupe for four years, and her mind was slowly wrapping itself around the idea of what life after Cunningham might look like for her. And then she and her colleagues were informed of the organization's intention to dissolve the troupe at the end of a goodbye tour that would follow Cunningham's death (which came in 2009). For Ms. Weber this radical decision changed everything."

After her retirement she went on to teach the popular class ""Fashion Atelier"" at Parsons for 14 years and continued designing on her own while loving her life, family, friends, and traveling.

2011-07-03T00:00:00Z,"SWEDEN once again struggled to score but secured its second straight 1-0 victory on Saturday, beating NORTH KOREA in Augsburg, Germany. Midfielder Lisa Dahlkvist scored in the 64th minute. The UNITED STATES followed with a 3-0 win against COLOMBIA in Sinsheim, sending both the Americans and the Swedes to the quarterfinals. It could have been worse for the Colombians: the Americans missed at least a half-dozen other good scoring chances, and had a 27-12 advantage in shots. In a game with plenty of near misses, Lisa Dahlkvist of Sweden, left, provided the only highlight against North Korea. Linda Forsberg crossed into the middle and Therese Sjogran fed the ball to the unmarked Dahlkvist for a simple finish from close range."

2011-07-03T00:00:00Z,"When the playwright Michael Weller heard that Karen Allen wanted to direct his 1970 play, ''Moonchildren,'' at the Berkshire Theater Festival this summer, he was wary. ''I thought, 'Oh, she's an actress, she'll just want to work with the actors.' But the first thing she said was, 'I want to talk to you about the order of the scenes,' '' Mr. Weller recalled. ''She was just dramaturgically so astute.'' Ms. Allen, perhaps forever to be known as Marion Ravenwood, the love interest of Indiana Jones in ''Raiders of the Lost Ark,'' is directing professionally for the first time, though she said she has been ready for a while. ''There's always been a part of me that was very much interested in working as a director, but you end up sort of feeling like you can't straddle both,'' she said."
2011-07-03T00:00:00Z,"PORTLAND, Ore., boasts more craft breweries than any other city in the world. Probably the smallest of them, Captured by Porches, is a mom-and-pop operation in a one-of-a-kind location: a truck on wheels that takes advantage of the city's loose alcohol laws and roving spirit of culinary adventure. Between four and eight craft ales are served from three circulating trucks. Its flagship beer is made from local hops and smoothly toes the line between sweet and pleasantly bitter. ''We just can't make enough beer,'' said Brian White, a brewer and occasional bartender on wheels. Hence the operation's recent expansion from a nanobrewery (roughly two kegs at a time) to a proper microbrewery. Passing by its Alberta Street location, a curious local stopped to ask, ''Is there really a brewing company inside a bus?'' Go to capturedbyporches.com. JORDAN MICHELMAN"

2011-07-03T00:00:00Z,"Amar'e Stoudemire signed with the Knicks as a free agent last summer after eight seasons with the Phoenix Suns. He led the Knicks to their first winning record (42-40) in 10 years and their first playoff berth in seven. Stoudemire, 29, was limited by a pulled muscle in his back during the first-round series against Boston, and the Knicks were swept. He was in Manhattan for a promotion before the N.B.A. imposed a lockout last week.Q.What has been the best part about being a Knick?A.The fans. When we are winning, the fans are incredible. When we're losing, they can grow impatient. Winning a championship takes patience, and the fans here in New York are not willing to wait - and neither am I.Q.How can the Knicks improve themselves in the off-season?A.I think defense is where it all starts. We need an interior presence to help us on the floor. I don't have any one particular player in mind, but I know he's out there. Q.As a former member of the Suns, where do you prefer living, in the East or West?A.The East Coast is more entertaining. You have so many great cities here, like Miami, New York and Philadelphia, that have so much to offer culturally. These are intriguing cities to me. They're fun to visit and explore.Q.What were your thoughts on the N.B.A. finals?A.I thought the games were great, very exciting. Every game could have gone either way, depending on how the ball bounced.Q.Did Miami prove that having three talented go-to guys - LeBron James, Dwyane Wade and Chris Bosh - can actually disrupt team chemistry?A.It's hard to have three guys averaging 25 points a game. I think the Celtics do a great job with their Big Three because they believe in the pass, and that's something we're going to stress next season, believing in each other. I don't know if Miami had enough time to figure that out this season.Q.The Celtics' nucleus of Kevin Garnett, Paul Pierce and Ray Allen is aging. Have they missed their window of opportunity to win another championship?A.I think there's still a window of opportunity for them to win it all again, but it won't be easy because there are so many teams in the East, like the Knicks and the Chicago Bulls, who will keep getting better each season.Q.Are you worried about the possibility of an N.B.A. lockout?A.It's something I dread. I don't want a lockout, I want to play. I want to have a training camp to get me and my teammates in shape for the coming season. We need to negotiate and find a common denominator.Q.Tell us something no one knows about you.A.I enjoy eating Gummi Bears.Q.What are you doing in the off-season?A.A lot of traveling, a lot of resting and a lot of rehabbing my back. I never had a back injury before. It definitely hindered my style of play against Boston. I'm rehabbing my back in the gym almost every day by lifting weights. It's still a little sore, but it's getting better."

The article also referred incorrectly to the engine that won the race in automotive innovation a century ago. It was the gasoline-powered combustion engine, not a combustible engine. A chart with the continuation of the article, comparing four car models, misstated the electricity-only range of the Toyota Prius. It is one mile, not 13.

Every development in the case was tweeted and retweeted - Mr. Strauss-Kahn (known as #DSK on Twitter) was in the courtroom, he had been released on his own recognizance, the district attorney was about to speak. As the week began, the legalization of same-sex marriage bill, which passed two days before the city's Gay Pride Parade was held last Sunday, continued to dominate local Twitter feeds - with #equalityforall, #nycpride and Governor Andrew Cuomo. After all, what's a major legislative victory without a little gloating?"

2011-07-03T00:00:00Z,"A few years ago, just as the recession hit, the Chambre Syndicale, the French fashion authority, decided to separate the June men's shows and the haute couture by a week. The two groups of shows had followed each other, as they still do in January. A week of free time in Europe is no longer regarded by publications with the joie de vivre of the past, so I usually split the time between work and pleasure. At the moment I'm in a village in Burgundy, staying at La Source des Fees, a vineyard owned by Thierry Nouvel and Philippe Greffet. The place is as lovely as it is laid back, with delicious dinners, and each night brings new guests - Dutch, Swedes, French. It's the beginning of the European summer. Maybe because of the distance from the men's shows, it's easier to see what they lacked. The other day I wrote about the sensuality in the collections of Givenchy and Comme des Garcons. But I think in general what's missing from the Paris and Milan spring shows is a sense of fun. I had a chat with Carla Sozzani, the Milan retailer, after Lanvin, and she pointed out that the creative spirit that drove designers in the past was in part entrepreneurial; it meant as much to them to design exciting stuff as it did to be their own bosses. But while there are many young designers who still have that mind-set, the field is dominated by big brands. And they want results, Ms. Sozzani said."

Prior to becoming a Supreme Court Justice, he served three terms as Mayor and Supervisor of the City of Glen Cove, beginning in 1967.

In 1972, he was elected to the bench and was designated Associate Justice of the Appellate Term, beginning a 28 year career in the New York State Supreme Court. He was later named Presiding Justice of the Appellate term, where his energetic drive and willingness to face tough issues continued until his retirement at the age of 76. He took great joy in the company of his grandchildren who will remember their Poppy for his unfailing support and unique sense of humor. Judge DiPaola is survived by his wife of 65 years, Helen; two children, Andrew, Jr and Anne Nielsten (Gerald); grandchildren, Alysia, Emily, Meghan, and Matthew; and sister, Mary Santulli.

Nick Lachey is host of the show, whose theme, ''Gift of Freedom,'' recognizes the 125th anniversary of the Statue of Liberty. 3 P.M. (Starz) PRINCE OF PERSIA: THE SANDS OF TIME (2010) The producer Jerry Bruckheimer helps transform a video game into a swords-sandals-and-sorcery spectacular starring Jake Gyllenhaal as the warrior of the title, an adopted son of an ancient king. Gemma Arterton is the pouty princess who joins forces with him to safeguard a supernatural dagger; Alfred Molina plays a wisecracking sheik; and Ben Kingsley is the king's suspicious brother. ''For the most part this is perfectly painless mush,'' Manohla Dargis wrote in The New York Times. ''If nothing else, it's entertaining to think about how this mash-up of ancient Persian heroics and headline news might sit with the Iranian powers that be. In March 2009 a spokesman for the Iranian president, Mahmoud Ahmadinejad, demanded an apology from Hollywood for 'insults and accusations against the Iranian nation' over the last 30 years.

2011-07-04T00:00:00Z,"The Yankees are so rich with starting pitching options that on Sunday they sent Ivan Nova, who had lost once in his last nine starts, to the minor leagues. No other options made much sense for the Yankees, who demoted him to Class AAA Scranton/ Wilkes-Barre as a prelude to welcoming back Phil Hughes to their rotation after his three-month stay on the disabled list. Hughes will probably pitch Wednesday night in Cleveland in what would be his first start since April 14. ''I'm real excited to get back,'' said Hughes, who had a 13.94 earned run average in three starts. ''I guess they felt after my last outing that I'm ready, and I'm looking forward to it.'' Hughes's recovery from right shoulder inflammation, a condition that sapped his velocity and fatigued his arm, gave the Yankees a surplus of starting pitchers: six players for five spots. As much as Manager Joe Girardi insisted that the Yankees were considering a six-man rotation, it hardly seemed plausible that they would have their ace, C. C. Sabathia, pitch less often. The Yankees are planning to ride Freddy Garcia and Bartolo Colon, their surprising veterans, for as long as possible. That made Nova, who is 8-4 with a 4.12 earned run average, the logical choice to go, because he has minor league options remaining. He will slide into the Class AAA rotation, becoming the Yankees' first option for a call-up in the event of an injury to a starter. The move was not announced until after the clubhouse had closed to reporters before the Yankees' 3-2 loss to the Mets in 10 innings, but when addressing potential solutions to the logjam Sunday morning, Girardi said he did not think it was possible to make a wrong decision. ''It's just a tough decision,'' he said. The right-hander Lance Pendleton took Nova's place on the major league roster, but he might be just a placeholder for Hughes. With A. J.

Clearly, they agreed."

I had one good pickup line, and e-readers ruined it. I can no longer hit on a handsome man on a long commute by asking about his book -- because I can't see it.

2011-07-04T00:00:00Z,"When Daniel Snyder, the owner of the Washington Redskins, filed a defamation lawsuit against the Washington City Paper in February, readers rushed to show their support - and the newspaper gave them an outlet. The City Paper set up a fund for reader donations meant to offset the litigation fees, collecting 600 donations totaling $28,000 in the first three weeks. But since the initial influx, the fund has received only 190 donations totaling just over $3,000. With donations slowing to a trickle even as the lawsuit drags on, the paper is left with a fund that matters more for what it has come to represent: tangible evidence of reader loyalty at a time when many newspapers are fighting steep readership declines. Though the fund has not sustained the flood of contributions, its ability to continue to attract donations at all demonstrates what Michael Schaffer, the newspaper's editor, called the ''sense of real, fierce ownership'' that City Paper's readers share."

JoAnn is one of my favorite journalists. She wrote a nice story for this magazine in 2004 about the disenchantment of black voters with the Democratic Party, but the one that I am most indebted to her for is the riveting account of Nushawn Williams, a young man who infected at least 13 women with H.I.V., which she wrote for Harper’s Magazine in 1998. (Not available free online, sorry. Worth buying a subscription to the magazine, trust me.). This is one of the finest magazine stories I’ve ever read, in part because it so beautifully and sensitively evokes the desperate straits of Jamestown, N.Y., my father’s hometown.

2011-07-05T15:07:06Z,"Giorgio Armani called his fall haute couture collection an homage to Japan. The designer who helped liberate women from boring executive wear and floppy bow ties confined his homage to traditional Japanese costumes and feminine floral patterns. There was no Goth Lolita moment or anything you might associate with Tokyo street fashion of the last 20 years. He stuck to a silhouette seemingly drawn from the kimono and obi (translated as stiff black patent leather bodices), and one or two models were slowed to a mincing gait.

He did not say that many liberal Jewish communities regularly practice stunning before slaughter. (Jewish authorities have generally required that animals be conscious when they are slaughtered.)

2011-07-05T00:00:00Z,"We dance, of course, for joy. But ballet, with its built-in dichotomy of gender roles (women alone rise on point, men alone may do the partnering), has a romantic tension that can seem poignant, even tragic. The full-length ''Swan Lake'' alternates between scenes of celebration (Acts I and III) and romantic tragedy (Acts II and IV), and its classicism can express the tragic dimension in ways that are the very stuff that ballet is made of and yet are singular to this ballet. It's not just romantic and noble, it's fateful and laden with doom. And the storm Tchaikovsky composed in Act IV becomes as cosmic as the one in Shakespeare's ''King Lear.'' Thanks to the movie ''Black Swan,'' the full-length ''Swan Lake'' is more in demand than ever. New York ballet companies have been cashing in: American Ballet Theater's annual week of ''Swan Lake'' at the Metropolitan Opera House just ended, and this year New York City Ballet arranged, first, one batch of ''Swan Lakes'' near the end of its winter season and has programmed another to start its fall season."

The All Stars Project Board of Directors and staff are deeply saddened by the passing of the All Stars' extraordinary and much loved co-founder, Fred Newman, Ph.D. He was 76. Dr. Newman was born in the South Bronx, grew up in the shadow of the old Yankee Stadium (becoming a lifelong Yankees fan), and served in the U.S. Army in Korea. Upon his return he completed his undergraduate studies at City College and went on to earn his Ph.D. in analytic philosophy and foundations of mathematics from Stanford University in 1962, where he was mentored by the renowned analytic philosopher Donald Davidson. All who knew him will remember him as a fierce champion for giving the best, most sophisticated, most far-reaching tools of postmodern philosophy to ordinary people. He taught at several colleges and universities in the 1960s before dedicating himself to community organizing and the creation of numerous independent education, health, mental health, cultural and political projects in New York and nationally. Dr. Newman was a practicing therapist for more than 30 years and was the founder of a new humanistic psychology known as Social Therapy. The author of numerous books and articles on postmodern, Vygotskian, and performatory psychology, he and his colleagues worked to develop and popularize their breakthrough discoveries about human development. He co-founded the All Stars Project with Lenora Fulani, Ph.D. in 1981 to bring this new science of development to the lives of inner-city young people. He was the chief designer of the All Stars Project's performance-based development approach, which has transformed the lives of hundreds of thousands of poor, Black and Latino youth across the country and is providing a new theoretical and practical framework for eliminating poverty and underdevelopment. Dr. Newman was artistic director and playwright-in-residence of the All Stars' Castillo Theatre from 1989 until 2005. Often a lightning rod for controversy, Fred Newman was a relentless champion for a new style of progressivism. He was also a pioneer in the development of independent politics in the United States, starting in the 1970s, and had a major hand in the creation of the Independence Party of New York, playing a key role in the party's endorsement of Mayor Michael Bloomberg in 2001, 2005, and 2009. Despite serious illness, Dr. Newman was unflagging in his work. He will be deeply missed by the Board of Directors, staff, volunteers and countless young people and their families in our poor communities whose lives he and his work have touched. We extend our deepest condolences to Dr. Newman's life partners Gabrielle L. Kurlander, who so ably serves as the All Stars President and CEO, and Jacqueline S. Salit, and to his children Elizabeth and Donald and granddaughter, Jane. As we mourn the passing of our founder and friend Fred Newman, his legacy of radical humanism, his commitment to community, to development and to creating ensemble performances live on through the work of the All Stars Project."

That's for Comedy Central to figure out: on Tuesday that cable channel announced that Charlie Sheen, who has been an ex-star of ''Two and a Half Men'' for so long now that we can't remember why he's still famous, will be the subject-cum-victim of the next installment of its popular series of televised roasts. The ''Comedy Central Roast of Charlie Sheen,'' where celebrity guests and comedians will say to Mr. Sheen the things that they've already been saying behind his back and run catch phrases like ''tiger blood'' and ''winning!'' into the ground, will be filmed in Los Angeles on Sept. 10 and broadcast on Sept. 19, the channel said on Tuesday. Mr. Sheen, who follows in the footsteps of immortal roastees like Donald Trump, David Hasselhoff and Flavor Flav, said in a statement: ''You could say I've been providing kindling for this roast for a while. It's time to light it up. It's going to be epic.'' Comedy Central has already settled on a Twitter hashtag -- #SheenRoast -- for the event, but no celebrity roasters were immediately announced; we'll assume the ''Two and a Half Men'' co-creator Chuck Lorre won't be making a trip to the dais."

Sadly, a lack of idiocy is not the same thing as a presence of wisdom, and the demise of ag-gag won't give us a clearer view of food production. We need more visibility, not less. But when I visited Iowa in May, I appealed to producers of eggs, chickens, pork and even cooking oil to let me visit their facilities.

2011-07-06T00:00:00Z,"9 P.M. (Bio) CLIENT 9: THE RISE AND FALL OF ELIOT SPITZER (2010) Alex Gibney chronicles the prostitution scandal that forced Gov. Eliot Spitzer of New York, above, to resign on March 12, 2008 -- a stumble, Mr. Spitzer tells the camera, that was caused by hubris. ''After being exposed, Mr. Spitzer told an aide, 'Welcome to a Greek tragedy,' '' Manohla Dargis wrote in The New York Times. ''More like a depressing lesson in power politics, though that's probably not what Mr. Gibney was shooting for. While its full title suggests that 'Client 9' is about the highs and lows in one powerful man's life, the movie is more rightly an anatomy of political gamesmanship at a high level.'' It is also the fruit of a cross-media partnership with Peter Elkind, the author of ''Rough Justice: The Rise and Fall of Eliot Spitzer,'' she said, noting that both the film and the book draw on some of the conspiracy theories that circulated after Mr. Spitzer's fall from grace. ''Those swayed by the argument in 'Client 9' that some of the rich and powerful whom Mr. Spitzer crusaded against might have exploited his stupidity should find all this enthralling,'' Ms. Dargis wrote. ''Others might just remember the hubris.'' 8 P.M. (Encore) FIELD OF DREAMS (1989) Kevin Costner plays Ray Kinsella, an Iowa farmer who builds a baseball diamond in his cornfield, where some ghostly men in old-time white uniforms show up to play. (Above, in a scene from the film, Mr. Costner, far left, Amy Madigan, Gaby Hoffmann and Dwier Brown.) One is Shoeless Joe Jackson, the greatest player on the Chicago White Sox team that threw the 1919 World Series. ''The short route that has led to this point in 'Field of Dreams' goes to the heart of a work so smartly written, so beautifully filmed, so perfectly acted, that it does the almost impossible trick of turning sentimentality into true emotion,'' Caryn James wrote in The New York Times. Ray Liotta makes Shoeless Joe ''ethereal and real at once, a relic of an earlier age much more than a ghost from the past,'' she added. And ''Mr. Costner does not make one false move.''"
2011-07-06T00:00:00Z,"One of the more distressing euphemisms of soccer is ''the good result,'' a win, but more often a tie on the road. A point is a point, whether it be a 3-3 or 0-0 game. In Major League Soccer, where two coaches have already lost their jobs this season and making the playoffs is crucial, caution is accepted as the best strategy, especially on the road. With the M.L.S. season not yet at the midway point -- its all-star game against Manchester United coming on July 27 -- the 18 teams have combined for 20 scoreless draws, already a league record. The tally ticked over once more late Monday night when the Los Angeles Galaxy and the Seattle Sounders played the latest barren 90 minutes."

Afterward the Mets head north to San Francisco, where they will face Ryan Vogelsong of the Giants, who is 6-1 with a 6-1, 2.13 E.R.A.; Tim Lincecum, a two-time Cy Young Award winner; and Matt Cain, an All-Star in 2009, to close out the first half of the season."

BBC News reported that Opera North, a British company based in Leeds, said it was canceling its production of ''Beached,'' a new work by Mr. Hall. The opera, which was to open later this month, tells of a single father's struggles to relax on a trip to the beach, and would have involved about 300 school children from the nearby Bay Primary School."

Last month, in the middle of a run of Britten's ''Midsummer Night's Dream'' at the English National Opera here, the countertenor Iestyn Davies wrote in a Twitter post that singing along with the song was ''the perfect warm-up for the role of Oberon.''

Jackie Kennedy wore a red Marimekko dress on the cover of Sports Illustrated in 1960; the Marimekko unisex Even Stripe T-shirt was a fixture on the rock and jazz festival circuit in the ’70s. Today, there is no shortage of new Marimekko material around thanks to collaborations with the likes of Crate and Barrel and Converse; and a free-standing Marimekko shop is scheduled to open in the Flatiron district in the fall.

Cy Twombly was a man of profound culture, able to draw at will on the poetry of every age, and on the world's literature and its history. His art was intimate, personal, touchingly humble, and true to himself. At the same time it was deeply humanist, grandly ambitious and always heroic. His passing is the end of an era.

Moran, a Virginia Democrat who is concerned about the propagation of ethnic museums on the National Mall in Washington, sees a possible antidote: a National Museum of the American People, dedicated, in the words of a resolution Mr. Moran plans to introduce in the House, to celebrating all immigrants, ''from the very first to the most recent.'' It ''may be idealistic,'' Mr. Moran said in a telephone interview, ''but I do think there's merit in the idea of showing all the American people how all the various threads of ethnicities and races and religions came together.'' He said he hoped that such a museum would reduce the pressure to create museums for different ethnic groups, like the National Museum of African American History and Culture, expected to open in 2015, and the proposed National Museum of the American Latino."
2011-07-07T00:00:00Z,"TWOMBLY--Cy. The Trustees and the Staff of the Whitney Museum of American Art note with deep sorrow the passing of Cy Twombly. A dear friend of the Museum and an erudite and incomparable artist, Twombly created an utterly personal form of expression that defied categorization. He embraced everything from ancient mythology and epic poetry to the keenly observed forces of nature. Twombly was first shown at the Whitney in the 1967 painting annual and has subsequently been included in more than forty other exhibitions at the Museum. His mid-career retrospective, Cy Twombly: Paintings and Drawings 1954-1977 was organized by the Whitney in 1979. More recently he was the subject of the 2005 exhibition Cy Twombly: Fifty Years of Works on Paper at the Museum. The Whitney is proud to hold a number of his works in our permanent collection, some of which were generous gifts of the artist. He has left an irrepressible and inimitable mark on the history of American art and his indefatigable spirit will be sorely missed. We extend our condolences to his son Cyrus Alessandro Twombly, his two grandchildren, his longtime companion, Nicola Del Roscio, and to his many dear friends. Flora Miller Biddle, Honorary Chairman Leonard A. Lauder, Chairman Emeritus Robert J. Hurst, Co-Chairman Brooke Garber Neidich, Co-Chairman Neil G. Bluhm, President Adam D.

The invitation from his campaign to attend an evening reception, on a street where a house was listed recently for $26 million, was more candid: ''Suggested contribution to Romney for President: $2,500 per person.'' The event's co-chairmen and co-chairwomen included the hedge fund billionaire Louis Bacon, the New York Jets owner Woody Johnson and two dozen others, mostly drawn from London's still-booming financial sector. The perfectly coiffed guests were deposited by a series of sleek limousines."

The robberies, mostly of Chase branches, occurred in two clusters - one from December to February, and another beginning mid-June. All the robberies were ''note jobs,'' meaning that the robber handed over a demand note but never brandished a weapon, the police said."

2011-07-07T00:00:00Z,"Though the producers of ''The Office'' may still wish they had Warren E. Buffett's stock portfolio, they have ultimately been won over by the business acumen (and possibly the alluring stare) of James Spader, naming him on Wednesday to a top position in the fictional hierarchy of that NBC workplace sitcom. Mr. Spader, a star of films like ''Secretary'' and ''Sex, Lies and Videotape,'' and a three-time Emmy Award-winner for ''The Practice'' and ''Boston Legal,'' was one of several guest stars on the May 19 season finale of ''The Office.'' In that episode, which also featured Jim Carrey, Will Arnett, Ricky Gervais and Mr. Buffett, the Berkshire Hathaway chief executive, Mr. Spader appeared as Robert California, an oddly charismatic executive vying to replace Michael Scott as the regional manager of Dunder Mifflin. (Steve Carell, who played the Michael Scott character, triggered this round of musical chairs when he departed ''The Office'' in April.)"

The San Francisco Chronicle reported that the work, a 1965 pencil drawing measuring 10 5/8 inches by 8 1/4 inches, was taken from the Weinstein Gallery in the city's Union Square neighborhood; the robbery was reported to the police at 11:41 a.m. and the work was being offered by the gallery for more than $200,000. The police told The Chronicle that witnesses described the thief as a white man, 6 feet tall and 30 to 35 years old, dressed in a dark jacket and dark pants, wearing dark glasses and loafers with no socks. He was said to have left in a waiting taxi cab after taking the drawing. Rowland Weinstein, the gallery's president who returned from a European honeymoon on Tuesday, told The Chronicle that while the stolen Picasso may be difficult for a thief to sell, he remained concerned for its safety. ''My greatest fear,'' he said, ''is that, with all this attention on it, the person will realize it's unsellable and will dispose of it in a less-than-proper manner.''"

Uninterested in the obvious monuments, Adam rounded the corner and stopped instead before Kotva, a department store from the Communist 1970s in brawny, Brutalist mode. Low slung and blocky, Kotva presented itself as a hulking iron-and-concrete hexagon with wraparound windows, set a little awkwardly back from the sidewalk.

When sales are measured by ''track equivalent albums,'' which factors in single-track downloads -- the rule of thumb is 10 songs to an album -- the number is 221.5 million, up 3.6 percent. These increases may be small, but the edge has been sustained for the last six weeks, and in a business that has been battered as badly and for so long as the music industry has, any good news is very good news."

In the early '90s, Ms. Berman was known for designing costumes for hip-hop stars like Salt-n-Pepa and A Tribe Called Quest, as well as a rapper then known as Puff Daddy. That was when she acquired her moniker. ''I was a gangster rapper designer of the '90s, and we loved bling-bling,'' she said. ''All the kids on the block called me Thug Mama.'' Ms. Berman, a native New Yorker who learned sustainability from punks in '70s London (''Punks work with what they have,'' she said), worked in animation for several years before opening a store in 2006 that mysteriously burned down and another, three years later, that didn't survive the recession. At the new shop, her one-of-a-kind summer dresses made from vibrant vintage materials are very much in tune with the print-happy season. She has also amassed an impressive collection of '60s platforms and vintage accessories.

Carol had a long career in psychotherapy and was involved in many community leadership roles in Edgemont. Carol continued to be active professionally throughout her battle with Parkinson's.

That it showed up in shops for spring -- from The Row (in eggshell white); in the Rodarte collection for Opening Ceremony -- proves its staying power regardless of the season. Looking ahead to fall, a soft leather tee makes a perfect layering piece. In the Yves Saint Laurent prefall collection, a golden brown leather version was shown atop a long-sleeve print shirt with a leather skirt in the same rich tone. Or keep it simple, as you would with any tee, and wear it, as in this look from the prefall Céline collection (left), with a print pencil skirt.

Lorenzo di Bonaventura, a producer of the “Transformers” and “G. I. Joe” movie franchises, and Gigi Pritzker of Odd Lot Entertainment have optioned the film rights to Space Invaders, and boy do they have their work cut out for them: whereas even a Pac-Man movie would give you a built-in roster of dramatis personae (Jack Black as the pellet-gobbling hero, anyone?), Space Invaders features such characters as the alien that flaps its wings up and down and the boxlike tank that slides from side to side at the bottom of the screen. The producers did not immediately announce a creative team for the movie, nor how much money they will spend to recreate the level where the Space Invaders turn invisible."

I named a stuffed frog Gripoix, probably because it sounded somehow a bit like crapaud, the French word for toad, but more elegant. There was the chance that the toy would turn into a prince, and in that case, I would need to go to Chanel to have a dress made for our fairy-tale wedding. This season was my first at couture as an adult — one married to a man, not an amphibian — with a mature perspective on whimsy. Everything is so fast now, but the atelier creations are the sartorial version of slow food. The work is green and ethical: there is no waste, as each piece is custom-made with a client in mind (no discount racks or fast fashion to fill landfills). Every artisan is properly treated. Can we say the same of certain mass-manufactured goods?"

2011-07-08T00:00:00Z,"8 P.M. (TCM) THE OLD CORRAL (1936) Gene Autry, right, was a man of many talents who wore many hats, most famously a Stetson, during his 91 years. He is the only entertainer to have been given five stars on the Hollywood Walk of Fame -- one each for radio, recordings, film, television and live theatrical performance. He wrote and sang the holiday tune ''Here Comes Santa Claus,'' among others. From 1961 to 1997 he owned the Angels, the Major League Baseball team in Anaheim, Calif., that has gone through a few name changes through the years, and he served as the vice president of the American League from 1983 until his death in 1998. Here, Autry basks in the Turner Classic Movies spotlight of a monthlong celebration of singing cowboys. First up, he plays a sheriff who helps a blues singer (Hope Manning) after she witnesses the murder of a nightclub owner. At 9, Autry portrays a border inspector keeping livestock with hoof-and-mouth disease from entering the United States in ''Home on the Prairie.'' At 10:15, he plays a rancher who finds copper and is framed in a jailbreak with Tom Bennett (Edward Norris) in ''Back in the Saddle.'' At 11:45, he tries to stop a ring of lottery-ticket counterfeiters in ''Texans Never Cry.'' And at 1 a.m., he hunts for the payroll stolen from the Army in ''Wagon Team.'' 8 P.M. (CBS) FLASHPOINT Ed Lane (Hugh Dillon) goes to the hospital after being shot, and the Strategic Response Unit's Team One uncovers a trail of opium imported from Afghanistan while tracking down the shooter.

2011-07-08T00:00:00Z,"Darwin D. Martin, a soap-factory executive in Buffalo, was a serial client of Frank Lloyd Wright. Between 1903 and 1928, the charismatic architect designed a half-dozen buildings for Martin's family, including a carriage house and a mausoleum. Wright referred to his shy, bookish patron as ''my best friend,'' borrowed $70,000 from him over the years and never repaid the loans. By the 1930s the Martins were largely broke, and they had to abandon their sprawling main house on a leafy side street.

With ''Beats, Rhymes & Life,'' the actor Michael Rapaport (Brad Pitt's roommate in ''True Romance''), in his feature directorial debut, does an admirable job recounting the group's formation and dissecting its dissolution. Q-Tip and Phife were childhood friends who grew up in Queens following pioneers of East Coast rap like Run-D.M.C. and LL Cool J. What they brought was a smoother, more sophisticated flow incorporating jazz influences. Part of the Native Tongues, a collective comprising De La Soul and the Jungle Brothers, among others, A Tribe Called Quest struck gold with albums like ''The Low End Theory'' (1991) and hits like ''Bonita Applebum'' and ''Check the Rhime.''

The power of his art lay not just in its extraordinary and haunting beauty, but in its ability to connect us to those archetypal forces which have driven mankind since classical times and before. Cy Twombly was a man of profound culture, able to draw at will on the poetry of every age, and on the world's literature and its history. His art was intimate, personal, touchingly humble, and true to himself. At the same time it was deeply humanist, grandly ambitious and always heroic. His passing is the end of an era.

2011-07-08T00:00:00Z,"WELLNER--Kenneth, Age 90, a man who well lived several lives, and inspired many others, died unexpectedly on July 2 after a determined battle with multiple medical afflictions. A self-proclaimed Yankee Doodle Dandy, Ken Wellner passionately loved this country, its freedoms and its opportunities. The son of the late Emil and Freida Wellner, Ken graduated from Stuyvesant High School and attended NYU before joining the Army in December, 1941, serving in the CBI, achieving the rank of Major and receiving the Bronze Star Medal. He considered his military service the greatest privilege. In civilian life he joined Wellner Motors in NYC, the family enterprise, which evolved into a mega automobile dealership. He was President of the Automobile Merchants Assn of New York in 1958 and 1959, and eventually created and Chaired The Kemwel Group, a European car rental with close ties to the travel industry. Despite a debilitating motor neuron disorder, Ken Wellner was an avid sailor, a talented photographer and author of five privately published novels which he wrote while in his 80s. Ken Wellner was a deeply loyal friend, a man of insatiable curiosity, relentless humor and optimism, and undeniable charm. He never permitted his medical issues to interfere with living a full life, and became quite a terror on his scooter which provided mobility during his final year. He relished entertaining in his homes in Mamaroneck, NY; NYC; and Rancho Mirage, CA, and invariably provoked spirited political conversation. His own extraordinary spirit will endure in all who knew him. Ken Wellner is predeceased by first wife Barbara (Bronstein), second wife Eyrun (Herbertsdottir), brother Maurice and his adored son, Rick. He is survived by his wife and best friend, JoAnn (Giffuni) who he affectionately called Murgy, nephew Michael Wellner, niece Susan Merrett (Mark), and their children and daughter-in-law, Gabrielle Wellner. Donations in Ken's memory are suggested to NYU Langone Medical Center, ED Development, One Park Ave, 17th Flr., NY, NY 10016, attn: Donna Marino or to WNET-THIRTEEN, 825 8th Ave, NY, NY 10019 attn: P.

He leads N.L. pitchers in wins and E.R.A. this season, and his 4.2 Wins Above Replacement have been perhaps the biggest factor keeping the Braves in the wild card lead. If it seems as if Jurrjens is coming in under the radar this season, think back to 2008, when as a 22-year-old rookie he had a 3.68 E.R.A. in 188 innings and finished third in rookie of the year balloting. The following season, he posted 14 wins and a 2.60 E.R.A. in 215 innings. Since 2008, Johan Santana and Tim Lincecum are the only N.L. pitchers with 600 or more total innings and a lower E.R.A. than Jurrjens."

Mark Lugo, 31, of Hoboken, is being held on burglary, grand theft and drug charges, with bail set at $5 million. He was arrested at a hotel in Napa, Calif., about 50 miles north of San Francisco. Mr. Lugo is accused of taking a 1965 work titled ''Tête de Femme'' (''Head of a Woman''), above, from the Weinstein Gallery and fleeing in a taxi. Surveillance video from a nearby restaurant shows a man matching his description walking by with a piece of framed artwork under his arm.

2011-07-08T00:00:00Z,"SKLAR--Robert A.,74, influential historian of film, died peacefully on July 2, family by his side, after a bicycle accident in Barcelona, Spain. To those who knew him well Bob was easy to love; he radiated warmth, intelligence and collegiality; a wonderful, kind, patient man with a sharp mind and keen sense of humor. Born to Lilyn and Leon Sklar, December 3, 1936, New Brunswick, NJ, Bob grew up in Long Beach, CA, and graduated summa cum laude from Princeton (BA 58), where he was chief editor of Daily Princetonian. At Harvard (PhD '65), his dissertation was a cultural analysis of F. Scott Fitzgerald. Bob went on to define the field of Cinema Studies, with 11 books, hundreds of articles, leadership of the NYU Dept. of Cinema Studies, where he was Professor for 33 years, and key roles in the Society of Cinema and Media Studies, National Film Preservation Board, NY Film Festival Selection Committee, and editorial board of Cineaste magazine. His prize-winning seminal work, Movie-Made America, pioneered a politically informed socio-cultural approach that set a standard for historical scholarship in the field and inspires each generation of film scholars anew. As a husband, Bob gave loving thoughtful support to two pioneering and prolific feminist scholars: his wife of 29 years, psychoanalyst Adrienne Harris, and his first wife, historian Kathryn Kish Sklar. Adrienne and Bob had an exceptionally close and happy marriage, rarely apart, a match of two complementary sensibilities and intellects. They were engaged in an intimate ongoing passionate conversation, involved and sustained in a wonderful, spirited community of friends and family. Bob gave his children unconditional love, supported their rebellious explorations, invested in their dreams, and celebrated his grandchildren's passions. He loved watching movies, being with family, his dogs, marathon running, wine, bicycling, world travel, and especially baseball, co-inventing fantasy baseball with the Rotisserie League. He is survived by his wife Adrienne, his children Leonard Sklar and Susan Sklar Friedman and their mother Kathryn Kish Sklar, step-children Kate and Justin Tentler, brother and sister-in-law Martin and Leah Sklar, sister-in-law Lorna Harris, grandchildren Nevona and Nadav Friedman, Cedar Sklar-Luers, and Jake Tentler, and children-in-law Amy Luers and Aryeh Friedman. A private service will be held in Sag Harbor, NY, and a public celebration of Bob's life is planned for the fall in New York City (date TBA). In lieu of flowers, donations may be made to Jewish Voice for Peace (jvp.org) or NPR (npr.org)."

2011-07-09T00:00:00Z,"After a weak touring season last year that shook the confidence of the concert industry, ticket sales for the first half of 2011 have made healthy gains, according to a report. But the increased grosses owe a lot to the price of tickets for the biggest shows, which have climbed to a level near their most expensive ever. The report, released Thursday by Pollstar, a trade magazine that collects data from concert promoters, ticketers and theaters, says that gross ticket sales for the top 100 tours in North America amounted to $1.12 billion for the first six months of this year. That is a gain of 16.2 percent over the same period last year, but 3.4 percent off the midyear peak of $1.16 billion two years ago. The top 50 tours around the world sold $1.65 billion in tickets, up 11.2 percent over last year, Pollstar said. The top tour by far was U2's (with lead singer Bono, above), which sold $164 million in tickets around the world, with $85.8 million in North America. According to Pollstar, the average price for a ticket in the first half of 2011 was $67.02, up 10.2 percent from this point last year. That is close to the industry's all-time high of $67.33, recorded for the full year 2008."

She is survived by her husband of 47 years, James Findlay, her son Robert, her brother Leon Morse, of Boca Raton, Florida, and her nieces, Gara and Mallory Morse. Harriet was a force for success in the lives of persons with disabilities. At age six, poliomyelitis left her quadriplegic. After graduating from Packer Collegiate Institute, The New School (B.A.), and New York University (M.A.), she embarked on her career in rehabilitation, a career marked by innovation and a drive for enhancing the success of adults and adolescents. Harriet partnered with major corporations, government planning boards, legislators and parent groups to build a successful Vocational Rehabilitation Program in the JFK-Johnson Rehabilitation Institute, in Edison, NJ. As Director, with a sharp pencil, Harriet garnered the analytical planning skills of the business community through Interface, her advisory group of ten corporations which met with her monthly. She shared her perspectives with the Governor's State Rehabilitation Advisory Council, The NJ Transit Advisory Board, The UMDNJ Rehabilitation Counseling Training Program, and ten other Boards. Harriet loved music, especially opera. She traveled extensively to Europe, Israel, Hawaii and the United States, always taking her service dog, Champ. Harriet refused to permit defeat of her spirit, working up to one month before her death. A memorial service will be held at the JFK Johnson Rehabilitation Institute's Conference Center which is located at 70 James St. Edison, NJ on July 20, at 6:00pm. For information you can call 732-321-7069. In lieu of flowers, donations can be made to Canine Partners for Life, PO Box 170, Cochranville, PA, 19330-0170.

Lorenzo di Bonaventura, a producer of the ''Transformers'' and ''G. I. Joe'' movie franchises, and Gigi Pritzker of Odd Lot Entertainment have optioned the film rights to Space Invaders, and boy do they have their work cut out for them: whereas even a Pac-Man movie would give you a built-in roster of dramatis personae (Jack Black as the pellet-gobbling hero, anyone?), Space Invaders features such characters as the alien that flaps its wings up and down and the boxlike tank that slides from side to side at the bottom of the screen. The producers did not immediately announce a creative team for the movie, nor how much money they will spend to recreate the level where the Space Invaders turn invisible. This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print."
2011-07-09T00:00:00Z,"COLORADO SPRINGS - At the Oxbow Golf and Country Club pro shop in North Dakota, the phone rang nonstop on Friday morning. Most of the callers weren't seeking a tee time but, rather, a score. Amy Anderson, an 18-year-old whose family belongs to the club, was playing in her first United States Women's Open and had charged to the top of the leader board on Thursday before play was suspended because of lightning. ''A lot of people were calling into the pro shop to ask how she's doing,'' said David Talley, who was manning the phone. Talley, 17, a golfer on his high school team, added, ''It's a big deal in our small town to see one of our own on the big stage.'' After sleeping on the lead, as it were, Anderson, a rising junior at North Dakota State, played the final five holes of her first round in even par to card a two-under-par 69 to remain the front-runner into Friday afternoon. It was a surreal start for Anderson, whose older brother, Nathan, is caddying for her. ''It's exciting,'' she said. ''It hasn't sunk in.'' Anderson's first stroke Friday was a 15-foot putt for birdie, which she left four-feet short. She made a bogey at No. 15, a par 4, but got the stroke back with a seven-foot birdie putt at No. 17. ''I'm trying not to get ahead of myself,'' said Anderson, who was asked to describe her hometown of Oxbow. ''It's a town of about 300,'' she said. ''Basically just a golf course with no houses. No gas station. No grocery store. Nothing too glamorous. But Fargo is a pretty decent-size town, and that's just 10 minutes away.'' Anderson has won five tournaments in each of her two years at North Dakota State and has twice qualified for the N.C.A.A. Division I tournament. Her 12th-place finish this year was the highest finish ever by a Summit League player. She usually takes a break from golf in November and December, she said, once winter settles in. When she resumes practicing in January, she hits off a mat in a 60-yard indoor facility."

The power of his art lay not just in its extraordinary and haunting beauty, but in its ability to connect us to those archetypal forces which have driven mankind since classical times and before. Cy Twombly was a man of profound culture, able to draw at will on the poetry of every age, and on the world's literature and its history. His art was intimate, personal, touchingly humble, and true to himself. At the same time it was deeply humanist, grandly ambitious and always heroic. His passing is the end of an era. I extend my deepest sympathy to Cy's family and close friends. Larry Gagosian"
2011-07-09T00:00:00Z,"BALLAN--Jack, on Thursday July 7, 84, long-time New Jersey public servant and attorney, passed away after a prolonged illness.

He is survived by the former Sally Roth, his wife of 55 years, his children Jonathan and Sandy Ballan, Harry and Judith Ballan, Jessica and Paul Julius, Carolyn and David Wasserman and fifteen grandchildren.

The TNT series will also chronicle a new generation's feud between Christopher Ewing, Bobby's adopted son (played by Jesse Metcalfe), and his cousin John Ross Ewing (Josh Henderson), the son of J.

If a factory fire or strike in France delays delivery of a purchase by weeks or even months, some consumers must simply wait. They have no legal right to cancel the purchase. When it comes to what is called contract law in the European Union, the single market is actually a patchwork of 27 national legal codes offering varying degrees of protection to consumers and merchants. Those differences, and the costs of overcoming them, have limited cross-border trade primarily to multinational companies with the legal staffs to negotiate the maze."

The power of his art lay not just in its extraordinary and haunting beauty, but in its ability to connect us to those archetypal forces which have driven mankind since classical times and before. Cy Twombly was a man of profound culture, able to draw at will on the poetry of every age, and on the world's literature and its history. His art was intimate, personal, touchingly humble, and true to himself. At the same time it was deeply humanist, grandly ambitious and always heroic. His passing is the end of an era.

2011-07-10T00:00:00Z,"WELLNER--Kenneth, Age 90, a man who well lived several lives, and inspired many others, died unexpectedly on July 2 after a determined battle with multiple medical afflictions. A self-proclaimed Yankee Doodle Dandy, Ken Wellner passionately loved this country, its freedoms and its opportunities. The son of the late Emil and Freida Wellner, Ken graduated from Stuyvesant High School and attended NYU before joining the Army in December, 1941, serving in the CBI, achieving the rank of Major and receiving the Bronze Star Medal. He considered his military service the greatest privilege. In civilian life he joined Wellner Motors in NYC, the family enterprise, which evolved into a mega automobile dealership. He was President of the Automobile Merchants Assn of New York in 1958 and 1959, and eventually created and Chaired The Kemwel Group, a European car rental with close ties to the travel industry. Despite a debilitating motor neuron disorder, Ken Wellner was an avid sailor, a talented photographer and author of five privately published novels which he wrote while in his 80s. Ken Wellner was a deeply loyal friend, a man of insatiable curiosity, relentless humor and optimism, and undeniable charm. He never permitted his medical issues to interfere with living a full life, and became quite a terror on his scooter which provided mobility during his final year. He relished entertaining in his homes in Mamaroneck, NY; NYC; and Rancho Mirage, CA, and invariably provoked spirited political conversation. His own extraordinary spirit will endure in all who knew him. Ken Wellner is predeceased by first wife Barbara (Bronstein), second wife Eyrun (Herbertsdottir), brother Maurice and his adored son, Rick. He is survived by his wife and best friend, JoAnn (Giffuni) who he affectionately called Murgy, nephew Michael Wellner, niece Susan Merrett (Mark), and their children and daughter-in-law, Gabrielle Wellner. Donations in Ken's memory are suggested to NYU Langone Medical Center, ED Development, One Park Ave, 17th Flr., NY, NY 10016, attn: Donna Marino or to WNET-THIRTEEN, 825 8th Ave, NY, NY 10019 attn: P.

Murray Gartner, one of the nation's top specialists in labor law, died on Saturday, June 25, of a massive aneurism, at the Maine Medical Center in Portland, Maine. A life-long resident of New York City, Mr. Gartner had recently retired with his wife, Anne, to Scarborough, ME, in 2004. Mr. and Mrs. Gartner had just celebrated their 50th wedding anniversary. Born in Queens, New York, in 1922, to Leo and Celia Gartner, recent immigrants from Eastern Europe, and the second of their three children, Murray Gartner's family lived first in Forest Hills, but later moved to Newark, New Jersey, where he received his high school education from the Newark public school system. Advancing through his early education at an accelerated rate, Mr. Gartner graduated high school at the age of fifteen and was admitted that same year to New York University. Graduating from NYU summa cum laude and Phi Beta Kappa in 1942, at the age of nineteen, he immediately went on to Harvard Law School, from which he graduated magna cum laude in 1945, after serving as President of the Harvard Law Review. Even before he graduated from Harvard Law, Mr. Gartner was hired by Associate Justice Robert H. Jackson to be his law clerk at the U.S. Supreme Court. He served as Justice Jackson's clerk for two-and-a-half terms, from February of 1945 through June 1947. He then joined the prestigious San Francisco firm of Pillsbury, Madison and Sutro. In 1951, he was tapped by the U.S. Special Representative in Europe to serve as Assistant to the General Council, as part of the Marshall Plan. Working for two years out of the Marshall Plan's headquarters in Paris, France, Mr. Gartner's main assignment was negotiating for the establishment of U.S. military bases in Spain. In 1953, Mr. Gartner returned to the United States, and to New York City, where he joined the law firm of Poletti, Freidin & Littauer. At Poletti, Freidin, Mr. Gartner established a successful, national practice in labor law, and in due course the firm soon became known as Poletti, Freidin, Prashker, Feldman & Gartner. After the death of Jesse Freidin in 1968, Murray Gartner and Herbert Prashker took over as senior partners, continuing their firm's specialization in labor law for the airline industry. Over the course of his practice, Mr. Gartner established himself as the ""go-to"" labor specialist for foreign airlines operating in the United States. His client list included British Airways, Air France, Qantas, Japan Airlines, Iberia Airlines, Air Canada, and Air India, as well as Pan Am. He represented them both as a litigator in labor disputes and in the negotiation of collective bargaining agreements. As a litigator, he tried a number of landmark federal cases under the Railway Labor Act. Despite his national reputation as a labor specialist for the airline industry, he also maintained a career as a general litigator, with a diverse roster of clients which included R. H. Macy & Co. and Restaurant Associates. In 1985, Poletti, Freidin, Prashker & Gartner was dissolved as a firm, and Mr. Gartner then moved over to a position as a senior partner at Proskauer, Rose, Goetz & Mendelsohn, LLP. While at Proskauer, Rose he had the opportunity to try two related appellate cases before the U.S. Supreme Court. The second of these cases, decided by the Court in 1989, established that the Railway Labor Act does not require employers, when a strike is over, to replace employees who have crossed the picket line to return to work during the strike with full-term strikers, even when those full-term strikers have greater seniority than the crossovers. Mr. Gartner is survived by his wife, Anne Thompson Gartner, his two children, Marion Moreau Gartner Carling of Hartford, CT, and Thomas Murray Gartner of Philadelphia, PA., and five grandchildren. His brother, David Gartner, and sister, Patricia Gartner, both predeceased him. Memorial Gifts may be made to the Harvard Law School, or to the Children's Aid Society of New York, 105 E. 22nd Street, Room 504, New York, NY 10010-5413. Funeral Services will be private.

2011-07-10T00:00:00Z,"DEN--Dr. Halina, born in Radom, Poland in 1922, died on July 7, 2011. The daughter of prosperous parents, Ita and Mordka Den, Halina enjoyed a life rich in culture and academic achievement until the Nazis overran her country. In April of 1941, when Halina was 19, all the Jews of Radom were forced to move into the Ghetto. To avoid deportation to an extermination camp in 1942, Halina took employment in the Kromolowski factory sewing saddles and mattresses for the German Army. She was separated from her family and forced to work 12 to 16 hours a day. By 1943, of the original 30,000 Jews in the Radom Ghetto only 1,500 survived. Halina was now ordered to dig peat for fuel, constantly guarded by the SS. Later that year she was sent to AZ Pionki munitions factory, and then to Auschwitz in a cattle car. With Russian troops closing in, Halina and other survivors were driven west on foot, during which many died. The British liberated her from Bergen-Belsen on April 15, 1945. The same fortitude that made it possible for her to survive incarceration, death marches, and loss of her family during the war, also made certain that she would succeed at her chosen profession once peace came. After doing undergraduate studies at the University of Frankfurt, Halina entered the United States under the auspices of her uncle Morris Schwartz, and earned her PhD in Bio-Chemistry at the University of Michigan. She later became a professor and researcher at Columbia University. Although surviving blood relations are few-cousins Norman Schwartz, Edward Sorel, and Ruth Froimowicz and her daughter Rachel Sutin, Eva Lenko, Alexandra Fish, Zeev Kuncman, Michelle Den, Hanna Katz, Hanna Silvers, Ruth Ryba and Chaim Weiner-she was loved by all in her extended family of friends and distant relatives, especially by Rebecca Schwartz, who was always there for Halina in her times of crises We all admired her determination to cherish and nourish whatever bit of joy came her way."

Competitive windsurf racing combines the high-speed maneuvering of ski cross with the blind courage of ski jumping. Pioneered in California in the late '60s by a sailor (who was also an engineer) and a surfer, windsurfing has become a global sport, with major competitions in at least 50 countries. While less popular than surfing, windsurfing has the advantage of simplicity. How do you win? ''That's easy,'' says Philippe Bru, founder of Défi Wind, one of the sport's most prestigious events, held annually in Gruissan, France.

2011-07-10T00:00:00Z,"NEWMAN--Frederick Delano. The All Stars Project Board of Directors and staff are deeply saddened by the passing of the All Stars' extraordinary and much loved co-founder, Fred Newman, Ph.D. He was 76. Dr. Newman was born in the South Bronx, grew up in the shadow of the old Yankee Stadium (becoming a lifelong Yankees fan), and served in the U.S. Army in Korea. Upon his return he completed his undergraduate studies at City College and went on to earn his Ph.D. in analytic philosophy and foundations of mathematics from Stanford University in 1962, where he was mentored by the renowned analytic philosopher Donald Davidson. All who knew him will remember him as a fierce champion for giving the best, most sophisticated, most far-reaching tools of postmodern philosophy to ordinary people. He taught at several colleges and universities in the 1960s before dedicating himself to community organizing and the creation of numerous independent education, health, mental health, cultural and political projects in New York and nationally. Dr. Newman was a practicing therapist for more than 30 years and was the founder of a new humanistic psychology known as Social Therapy. The author of numerous books and articles on postmodern, Vygotskian, and performatory psychology, he and his colleagues worked to develop and popularize their breakthrough discoveries about human development. He co-founded the All Stars Project with Lenora Fulani, Ph.D. in 1981 to bring this new science of development to the lives of inner-city young people. He was the chief designer of the All Stars Project's performance-based development approach, which has transformed the lives of hundreds of thousands of poor, Black and Latino youth across the country and is providing a new theoretical and practical framework for eliminating poverty and underdevelopment. Dr. Newman was artistic director and playwright-in-residence of the All Stars' Castillo Theatre from 1989 until 2005. Often a lightning rod for controversy, Fred Newman was a relentless champion for a new style of progressivism. He was also a pioneer in the development of independent politics in the United States, starting in the 1970s, and had a major hand in the creation of the Independence Party of New York, playing a key role in the party's endorsement of Mayor Michael Bloomberg in 2001, 2005, and 2009. Despite serious illness, Dr. Newman was unflagging in his work. He will be deeply missed by the Board of Directors, staff, volunteers and countless young people and their families in our poor communities whose lives he and his work have touched. We extend our deepest condolences to Dr. Newman's life partners Gabrielle L. Kurlander, who so ably serves as the All Stars President and CEO, and Jacqueline S. Salit, and to his children Elizabeth and Donald and granddaughter, Jane. As we mourn the passing of our founder and friend Fred Newman, his legacy of radical humanism, his commitment to community, to development and to creating ensemble performances live on through the work of the All Stars Project."

2011-07-10T00:00:00Z,"NEW YORK has been a melting pot of national ballet companies of late: the Cubans, the Danes and, of course, American Ballet Theater's rotating casts of international stars. And now the Russians. On Monday the Mariinsky Ballet and Orchestra will begin a week of performances at the Lincoln Center Festival. Valery Gergiev, the Mariinsky Theater's artistic director, will share conducting duties. In addition to George Balanchine's ''Symphony in C'' and Alberto Alonso's ''Carmen Suite'' come the American premieres of two works by the choreographer Alexei Ratmansky: ''Anna Karenina'' and ''The Little Humpbacked Horse.'' These two very different Russian tales feature scores by Rodion Shchedrin, the Russian composer and husband of the great Bolshoi ballerina Maya Plisetskaya."

2011-07-10T00:00:00Z,"WHEN the 24-year-old painter from Indianapolis received a message from his girlfriend that she was out with the girls, the brief text on his phone gave no grounds for suspicion. Months later, post-breakup, he learned she was cheating on him that night. It was not the only time she tried to deceive by text, he said. ''If she wasn't physically in front of me during a discussion, I had no real way to judge as to whether or not she was telling the truth,'' said the painter, who was granted anonymity because his ex-girlfriend wasn't around to give her side."

Competitive windsurf racing combines the high-speed maneuvering of ski cross with the blind courage of ski jumping. Pioneered in California in the late '60s by a sailor (who was also an engineer) and a surfer, windsurfing has become a global sport, with major competitions in at least 50 countries. While less popular than surfing, windsurfing has the advantage of simplicity. How do you win? ''That's easy,'' says Philippe Bru, founder of Défi Wind, one of the sport's most prestigious events, held annually in Gruissan, France. ''You want to go faster than the guys in front of you and the guys behind you.'' And if you do that at Défi, your grand prize is . . . ''nothing,'' Bru says. ''No money, just a trophy and the ability to tell people, 'I won the Défi Wind, because I was the fastest.' '' Dates of Défi Wind 2011: June 2-5"

2011-07-10T00:00:00Z,"IN the late 19th century, in Louisville, Ky., farm animals shuffled down East Market Street, flanked by shops selling dry goods and animal hides. A century later, what remained was a barren conduit between residential neighborhoods and the city's downtown. Today, the brick facades that line the wide street retain the remnants of paint faintly advertising the old tenants' wares, but the buildings are occupied by new boutiques, restaurants and architecture firms, and the buzz and rattle of construction fills the daytime hours. On the first Friday evening of each month, people, not livestock, mill along the sidewalks, ducking into galleries as part of the First Friday Trolley Hop, the nomadic art party that follows a free trolley route through the neighborhood. This five-block strip is often called East Market District, though some prefer NuLu, for New Louisville, a term coined by Gill Holland, a local investor.ANDREW SIMMONS"

The cause was metastatic breast cancer. Maggie was a lifelong photographer, painter, fashion designer and more recently a digital computer artist. In January 1999 she made her first silkscreen, Consciousness is the Self and hand screened it on an old t-shirt. This was the first Shiva Sutra and the auspicious beginning of Hermitwear, Maggie's design company. Maggie created each of her clothing pieces as if they were works of art on canvas. Friends and colleagues from the fashion industry and yoga community expressed that wearing her line of clothes made them feel full of good will and love, which reflected Maggie's approach to life, friendship and the world. Her charismatic and magnetic personality attracted so many people in her hometown of Scarsdale, NY and New York City where Maggie is beloved by friends throughout those communities. Maggie is survived by her friends Lori, Frank, Prema, Pat, Susan, Sam, Ellen, cousins Linda, Ricky, Tommy, Claudia, Paul, Valerie, Antoinette, John and Mary Ann, mother Nancy and brother John.

If many more players follow the lead of the Yankees' Mariano Rivera, Derek Jeter and Alex Rodriguez, who all dropped out of Tuesday's game because of nagging injuries, there could be a new mark. Besides injuries, the rule preventing pitchers who start on Sunday from working in the All-Star Game will also swell the ranks.

Philosophers, literary critics and psychoanalysts have offered diagnoses for Hamlet's procrastination. For some, Hamlet simply cannot make up his mind: he waits, hesitates and is divided from himself in his ''madness,'' all the while dreaming of a redeeming, cataclysmic violence. In this view, Hamlet is a creature of endless vacillation, a cipher for the alienated, inward modern self in a world that is insubstantial and rotten: ''Denmark's a prison,'' Hamlet sighs. For others, Hamlet is the great melancholic who is jealous of Claudius for realizing his own secret desire -- to usurp the place of his rival in the affection of his mother."

We have a word for the stuff that doesn't fit the way we want: noise. The term comes from the early days of telecommunication when phone calls, telegraph signals and radio transmissions were spotty and indistinct because of mysterious distortions."

2011-07-10T00:00:00Z,"In last week's Metropolitan section, John Leland wrote about the battle that Celeste Holm, 94, and her husband, Frank Basile, 48, had fought with her sons over control of her finances. Following are excerpts from reader comments posted on NYTimes.com. Readers also responded to Elissa Gootman's essay about the theft of her stroller and to Neil Genzlinger's City Critic column about Ellis Island. Love takes many forms. And people have much more difficulty accepting a gap in age when the older member of the couple is female. The largest tragedy here is that all the supposed adults were unable to sit down and have a rational discussion about how to care for Ms. Holm, and how her assets should be dispersed. It is her money, after all."
2011-07-10T00:00:00Z,"AZZEDINE ALAÏA has been busy these last eight years -- creating a shoe line with the help of Prada's factories, tidying up his house, expanding his ateliers with financing from Richemont. He has also been prolific as a designer. Remember the black crackled patent leather coats that fashionistas craved? Or the frilled knit dresses that Michelle Obama wore in Oslo and New York? Without his doing shows (not since 2003), without advertising, or being on Twitter, Mr. Alaïa has seen the world come to him. And ideally that's how it should be. People find him, or they want to talk about his clothes, because the work speaks so clearly for itself. Last March, when he gave me and Vanessa Friedman of The Financial Times a look at his fall ready-to-wear, he temptingly showed a few works in progress. With Mr. Alaïa, that's how it is: clothes are ready when they are ready, not before."

I wished to create a rare and unique perfume that would stimulate certain olfactory senses and refer back to my fashion collection.” If notes like black iris and dark chocolate don’t say “rare and unique,” the fact that only 1,000 numbered bottles of La Femme Bleue were produced should do the trick.

2011-07-11T00:00:00Z,"CION--Judith Ann nee Schneider, 68, died July 6 at home in Connecticut after a five year valiant battle with ovarian cancer. Born in New York City to Peter and Ruth Schneider she graduated from high school in Scarsdale. Judy spent her childhood summers at Cape Cod in her family's summer home which she loved and later shared with her friends until it was sold after her father's death. After enrolling in college on the East Coast, she decided that a change of scenery was in order and transferred to Pomona College in Claremont, CA. After returning to the East Coast and graduating from Harvard Law School, Judy practiced law and held various positions, including, partner at Lovejoy, Wasson, head of the securities group at Mellon Bank, and general counsel at Hibernia Bank. Judy was a member of the Society of Corporate Secretaries and Governance Professionals and its Chairman from 1992-1993. She co-authored various publications on corporate governance. An expert in the field, she spent several years in Eastern Europe after the collapse of the Soviet Union and worked tirelessly with NGO's to assist Eastern European and former Soviet Bloc nations to build and maintain stable corporate and financial systems. Her love for theatre and modern dance, especially ballet, was unwavering. Among other positions, Judy was a Board Member of the New Orleans Ballet Association from 1992 through 1998. There was no show on Broadway or off-off Broadway that she did not attend. An avid traveler, Judy introduced her many friends to Golden Rock in Nevis and Rollins rum cocktails long before Nevis became fashionable. Judy applied her boundless energy to everything she did and everyone she met. She did not shy away from lively debate, especially political. Any left leaning liberal could always rely on her zealous support. She dispensed advice on any subject to close friends and new acquaintances alike. Judy was a stickler for the propriety of others, but not her own. She advised that houseguests were like fish and should be tossed out after three days. However, as a houseguest, her sojourns lasted longer than her prescription. She was an adventurous and industrious cook and baker to the delight and dismay of her friends. She once cooked broccoli rabe for 120 people for the Palio on Minetta Street and took charge of neighborhood children for set-up and table service. At Christmas, she manufactured her renowned spiced nuts and cookies for holiday delivery. Most of all Judy loved to entertain friends at home and her Thanksgiving dinners were produced as super sized crowd pleasers. After Hurricane Katrina and learning of her illness, Judy left New Orleans. Following a long search she found a new home in which she could celebrate her final Thanksgiving in the company of her closest friends. She purchased and renovated a house in Connecticut and continued those renovations until her death. Thanksgiving was her favorite holiday and her last one was joyfully celebrated with the family that she created through will and circumstance. Donations in Judy's memory may be made to The Joyce Theater Foundation (www.joyce.org) or Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center (www.mskcc.org). A gathering to celebrate Judy's life will be held in the Fall at a date to be determined. If you wish to be included in this event please register your interest at judycionMemorial@gmail.com"

More than 30 South Koreans kill themselves every day, and the suicides of entertainers, politicians, athletes and business leaders have become almost commonplace.

2011-07-11T00:00:00Z,"''Madness in great ones must not unwatch'd go.'' That well-turned observation was originally made about one Prince Hamlet, and doubtless it's useful advice regarding future heads of state. But the dictum applies equally to those who tread the stage. Few things test the mettle of an actor - or separate the artists from the hacks - like the simulation of a whopping case of mental illness. On one level, conveying the idea that you're out of your mind is a piece of cake (three layers, heavily frosted, lots of candles), in the same way that portraying drunkenness is. You or I could do it. Widen the eyes as far as possible, gnash the teeth until they threaten to crack, shake like a leaf in a hurricane and - voila - you're a certifiable basket case for public consumption. (For drunkenness, substitute: slur the words, squint the eyes and lean to one side until you almost fall over.)"

A self-proclaimed Yankee Doodle Dandy, Ken Wellner passionately loved this country, its freedoms and its opportunities. The son of the late Emil and Freida Wellner, Ken graduated from Stuyvesant High School and attended NYU before joining the Army in December, 1941, serving in the CBI, achieving the rank of Major and receiving the Bronze Star Medal. He considered his military service the greatest privilege. In civilian life he joined Wellner Motors in NYC, the family enterprise, which evolved into a mega automobile dealership. He was President of the Automobile Merchants Assn of New York in 1958 and 1959, and eventually created and Chaired The Kemwel Group, a European car rental with close ties to the travel industry. Despite a debilitating motor neuron disorder, Ken Wellner was an avid sailor, a talented photographer and author of five privately published novels which he wrote while in his 80s. Ken Wellner was a deeply loyal friend, a man of insatiable curiosity, relentless humor and optimism, and undeniable charm. He never permitted his medical issues to interfere with living a full life, and became quite a terror on his scooter which provided mobility during his final year. He relished entertaining in his homes in Mamaroneck, NY; NYC; and Rancho Mirage, CA, and invariably provoked spirited political conversation. His own extraordinary spirit will endure in all who knew him. Ken Wellner is predeceased by first wife Barbara (Bronstein), second wife Eyrun (Herbertsdottir), brother Maurice and his adored son, Rick. He is survived by his wife and best friend, JoAnn (Giffuni) who he affectionately called Murgy, nephew Michael Wellner, niece Susan Merrett (Mark), and their children and daughter-in-law, Gabrielle Wellner.

Prominent philanthropist, businessman and civic leader, beloved husband and partner of 51 years of Lyn (nee Goldberg) cherished father of Merry Ross (Patrick Zimski) and Michael (Nancy) Ross and adoring grandfather to Zoe and Phoebe Zimski, died peacefully at home in Bryn Mawr, PA on July 8th surrounded by his family. George, who also lived in Palm Beach, FL, died after a heroic battle with lung cancer. He was born in 1933, son of the late Beatrice and the late David Rosenkoff, in West Philadelphia and throughout his adult life made a difference in the lives of many people. After graduating from Drexel University in 1955, George began his successful career with Goldman Sachs & Co. in 1959.

2011-07-11T00:00:00Z,"Another weekend, another splash in the cinematic sewer. Paramount's ''Transformers: Dark of the Moon'' remained a huge No. 1 at North American theaters with $47 million in ticket sales ($261 million to date). But it was the unexpectedly strong performance of ''Horrible Bosses'' - noted by critics for its homophobia and misogyny - that caught Hollywood's attention. ''Horrible Bosses,'' which cost the New Line division of Warner Brothers about $35 million to make and is rated R, sold an estimated $28 million in tickets for second place, proving that audiences are anything but weary of crude comedies. (Still to come this summer: ''Friends With Benefits,'' in which Justin Timberlake uses an iPhone app to detect menstrual cycles, and ''The Change-Up,'' featuring a baby defecating on Jason Bateman's face.) ''Zookeeper,'' a family comedy that cost Sony Pictures Entertainment and Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer $80 million to make, was a soft third with about $21 million, according to Hollywood.com, which compiles box-office data. That result, which a Sony spokesman called ''solid,'' was in line with prerelease expectations."

2011-07-11T00:00:00Z,"The Barnes Foundation, the stupendous collection of Impressionist and early modernist painting and sculpture amassed by Albert C. Barnes, a pharmaceutical tycoon, has been one of America's strangest and most affecting art museums from the day its doors opened in 1925 in the Philadelphia suburb of Merion. It is difficult now, looking at the artists Barnes loved -- Cézanne, Renoir, Matisse, Picasso, Modigliani, Seurat --to grasp just how revolutionary such a collection was at the time he was building it. And the way Barnes exhibited the works -- filling walls with paintings in odd arrangements to echo and rhyme their formal qualities -- made the gallery a monument to his eccentric vision. Now, in some ways, the Barnes will certainly become more like other American museums. After a 2004 judge's ruling permitting the foundation to bypass Barnes's rigid charter and bylaws, which stipulated that no picture could be lent, sold or moved from the walls of the galleries he built, the collection is moving from its Merion home to a new building in downtown Philadelphia, expected to be completed next year. Right, a final look at a room from the Merion museum, which closed to the public at the end of June. RANDY KENNEDY COLOR"

His vision and passion were critical to the creation of our new Museum. George was an extraordinarily generous philanthropist and community leader who supported many causes, but his contributions to the Museum were paramount. Through his leadership, dedication and generosity, George shaped this institution into the central home for the evolving and vibrant story of American Jewish life. We will forever be grateful for the enduring legacy he leaves us. We offer our heartfelt condolences to our beloved Lyn and their children Merry (Patrick Zimski) Ross, Michael (Nancy) Ross, granddaughters Zoe and Phoebe Zimski and brother Charles (Marilyn) Ross. May his memory be a blessing. The family requests that gifts in his memory be sent to NMAJH, 101 S. Independence Mall East, Philadelphia, PA 19106.

2011-07-12T00:00:00Z,"This year, a Seattle nurse named Kim Hiatt committed suicide. Ms. Hiatt's death came nearly seven months after she had given an unintended overdose to an infant heart patient, a medical error that was said to have contributed to the child's death days later. Ms. Hiatt had been a nurse for 27 years and had often cared for the 8-month-old girl during the child's stay in the pediatric intensive care unit of her hospital. She had probably drawn up the right dose of the drug hundreds of times in her career. But once, she made a life-changing error. A baby died, and she was suspended, then fired from a profession she loved. And now she's dead. This story makes me feel sick -- sick for that dead baby and her parents, and sick for Kim, who must have felt so alone with her pain."

McKinney fled the country in an outlandish disguise and, three decades later, made the news again, this time for persuading a South Korean doctor to clone her beloved pit bull, Booger.

2011-07-13T08:00:47Z,"It’s not as though anyone in Berlin really needed proof, last week, that the city’s once-hip central Mitte neighborhood had officially jumped the shark — two years’ worth of boutique hotel and Mavi-store openings, plus skyrocketing rents and a mass exodus of the gallery scene, had all been fairly obvious clues. But as the local fashion crowd milled around on Wednesday night outside the opening of Andreas Murkudis’s sprawling concept shop, newly and thrillingly relocated to a remote stretch of Potsdamer Strasse once ruled by drug dealers and prostitutes, there seemed to be only one sentiment on everybody’s lips: Goodbye, and good riddance. Murkudis may have helped pioneer the Mitte retail scene when he began selling Margiela and Yohji from three minimalist storefronts inside a courtyard off Münzstrasse in the early 2000s, but with a few notable exceptions — the recently opened Gestalten bookshop, the Kunstwerke contemporary art museum — it’s no longer the place that in-the-know young people go to hang out and discover things.

After one reader wondered what prevents those companies from dropping health insurance now, another, adam of Washington, wrote a thoughtful response that is worth reprinting at length.

2011-07-13T00:00:00Z,"VITAGLIANO--Maggie, a prolific artist who brought together her love of sacred Indian Scripture and her abundant artistic talent to create a distinctive clothing line, died on April 13th, 2011 three days before her 60th birthday. The cause was metastatic breast cancer. Maggie was a lifelong photographer, painter, fashion designer and more recently a digital computer artist. In January 1999 she made her first silkscreen, Consciousness is the Self and hand screened it on an old t-shirt. This was the first Shiva Sutra and the auspicious beginning of Hermitwear, Maggie's design company. Maggie created each of her clothing pieces as if they were works of art on canvas. Friends and colleagues from the fashion industry and yoga community expressed that wearing her line of clothes made them feel full of good will and love, which reflected Maggie's approach to life, friendship and the world. Her charismatic and magnetic personality attracted so many people in her hometown of Scarsdale, NY and New York City where Maggie is beloved by friends throughout those communities. Maggie is survived by her friends Lori, Frank, Prema, Pat, Susan, Sam, Ellen, cousins Linda, Ricky, Tommy, Claudia, Paul, Valerie, Antoinette, John and Mary Ann, mother Nancy and brother John.

2011-07-13T00:00:00Z,"As bad ballets go, Alexei Ratmansky's two-act ''Anna Karenina'' is one of the best. It tells its potted version of Tolstoy's novel with a fair bit of narrative clarity; it manages many complex changes of scene deftly; its décor and costumes (by Mikael Melbye) are generally elegant; its extensive use of video projections (by Wendall Harrington) is unusual and effective; and most of its leading characters are immediately identifiable and distinct. But these virtues don't suffice. The ballet is a complete waste of everybody's time. In this case ''everybody'' includes the Mariinsky Ballet of St. Petersburg, Valery Gergiev conducting the Mariinsky Theater Orchestra, and the Lincoln Center Festival audience at the Metropolitan Opera House on Monday's opening night of the Mariinsky's weeklong season."

2011-07-13T00:00:00Z,"A $16 million musical production of ''Rebecca,'' based on the classic 1938 novel by Daphne du Maurier, has been scaled down to a budget of about $12 million - largely thanks to the loss of a collapsing staircase special effect - and is now on track for Broadway, the producers announced on Tuesday. Preview performances at a Shubert theater still to be named are scheduled to begin March 27, 2012, with an opening night set for April 22. A Gothic love story about a wealthy Englishman, Maxim de Winter, his new wife, and his estate, Manderley, that may be haunted by his dead first wife, ''Rebecca'' was popularized in the 1940 film by Alfred Hitchcock and, over the last several years, in a musical that played through Europe.

2011-07-14T00:00:00Z,"In ''Weighty Concerns,'' by Samantha Kwan and Mary Nell Trautner, in the spring 2011 issue of Contexts, the magazine of the American Sociological Association, the authors complain that Americans are in the thrall of a ''moral panic'' about weight. Constant and exaggerated warnings about an obesity epidemic, they say, are causing ''fatism'' and ''sizeism,'' discrimination against those who are overweight. As evidence the authors note that people who are obese tend to earn less money and marry less frequently than their thinner counterparts, and that women are most frequently affected. Ms. Kwan and Ms. Trautner maintain that someone can be fit and fat, and that public-health officials ''exacerbate sizeism'' by their repeated messages that being overweight increases the risk of a series of diseases including cancer and diabetes."

So it goes for Kristen Wiig, the star and co-writer of ''Bridesmaids,'' the $150 million hit, who could be spending her summer unwinding to the music of Wilson Phillips and chowing down on cheap Brazilian food but is instead moving on to her next project. The production companies Maven Pictures and Anonymous Content said that Ms. Wiig would star for them in ''Imogene,'' a dark comedy written by Michelle Morgan. In a news release the companies said the film tells the story ''of a moderately successful New York playwright who stages a fake suicide attempt to win back her ex-boyfriend, only to end up being forced into the custody of her gambling-addict mother.''

CBS announced Tuesday night that Mr. Danson, who has been among the most popular stars in television since his days leading the NBC comedy hit ''Cheers,'' will take over in the fall as the chief investigator of the Las Vegas Crime Scene Investigation team, the job first held by William Petersen and most recently by Laurence Fishburne. CBS has moved ''C.S.I.'' out of its longtime home on Thursday night to Wednesdays in the fall. Ratings for the series began to fall off sharply toward the end of last season, the show's 11th on the air. There had been some question about whether CBS would try to keep the crime drama alive, facing the challenges of having to replace a star for the second time. But CBS often retains shows longer than other networks, calculating that new shows are always a bigger risk And ''C.S.I.'' remains a significant financial asset for the company, which has an ownership stake in the series. The drama still sells to many international broadcasters and its repeats are still purchased for a high price by the cable channel Spike. Mr. Danson has expanded his acting repertoire in recent years, playing a villain on the FX series ''Damages'' -- and gaining an Emmy nomination - and a reprobate publisher on the HBO comedy ''Bored to Death.'' According to CBS's announcement Mr. Danson will continue in that role. This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print."

She was the widow of Hubert M. Tibbetts, former President and CEO of Thomas J. Lipton, Inc. Gunhild was born Kerstin Gunhild Margareta on October 12, 1929, in Malmo, Sweden, to Harry and Margareta Wetterhorn. She moved to the United States in 1951, first living in Florida where she attended junior college and was crowned in the Miss St. Petersburg beauty pageant. A lovely Swedish blonde with piercing blue eyes and flawless skin, her looks could have taken her to Hollywood. Always stunningly put together, she had an impeccable eye for fashion and design. After moving to New York City in the mid 1950s, she worked as a buyer for the Cotton Shop on Madison Avenue. It was love at first sight when she met Hubert Tibbetts in New York in 1954. Although multi-talented and creatively gifted, her main goals in life were to have a successful marriage and to provide a loving home for her children. She was happily married to Hubert for 46 years, before he passed away in 2002. Over the years, she played many roles in addition to wife, mother and homemaker: chicken farmer, taxi dispatcher, gardener, chef, and real estate agent. In her spare time, she enjoyed knitting and needlework, and vacationing on the beach in the Cayman Islands. Although beautiful beyond compare, it was her inner beauty that shone brightest. Always there with a friendly smile, she was exceptionally kind-hearted and extremely generous. Your happiness was always the greatest gift to her. A proud U.S. citizen and staunch Republican, she lived her life with no regrets. Family came first for her, and she focused much of the last 15 years spending time with her grandchildren, Serena and Marisa, whom she adored. She is survived by her sister Inger Wetterhorn; brother Richard Wetterhorn; son Lance Tibbetts; daughter and son-in-law Kerstin and Ron Kripalani; and granddaughters Serena and Marisa Kripalani.

She wanted to know more about the American companies that buy coveted minerals extracted from the region."

Today was such a day for me, and I hope it was for you, too. But I came awfully close to this being a D.N.F. (Did Not Finish, for those of you who are new here) for me. That would have been a shame, primarily because I happen to love Patrick Berry’s puzzles, and secondly, because I can’t really write intelligently about the puzzle if I don’t finish, and that ticks off my editors like you can’t imagine."

The sax matters now more than it has at any time since the recently departed Clarence Clemons was at his peak. But unlike some of her kitsch-minded contemporaries, who use the instrument to connote post-wink post-irony, Ms. Garbus makes her sax players work, using their meaty lines to thicken her one-woman ukulele-and-drums-and-howls cornucopia. Hers is hard, muscular, construction-site soul, and the frenzied saxophones behind her highlighted how much sweat making this music generates."
