2013-12-24T00:00:00Z,"MARSHALL--Mildred P. Milly Marshall died peacefully in her apartment at Essex Meadows on December 19. She was born June 5, 1921 in Memphis, the youngest of the three Puryear girls, belles of Memphis society. Her father, a prominent attorney, died when she was eight, and she was raised through the Depression years by her mother. Graduating from the Hutchison School in Memphis, she went to Vassar College on a scholarship, graduating in 1942 with an economics major. She went to Washington during World War II to work as Assistant to the Rubber Director in the Office of Price Administration. A year later in Washington she married a handsome Navy lieutenant, Bob Marshall (Princeton '40), who would remain the focus of her life for the next 64 years. Milly and Bob moved to Bronxville, NY in 1950 and were pillars of the community for more than 50 years. Milly taught Sunday School at Christ Church, was on the board of the Bronxville Junior League, helped her three children, Bob Jr., Sara and Nancy, with their homework while herself studying at Union Theological Seminary, where she also served on the board. Inspired by a lecture at Union that challenged the audience to improve city schools, Milly rounded up a half-dozen mothers to take suburban students in to Harlem every Wednesday afternoon to a tutoring program that had just been started. With Milly providing crucial early leadership, the East Harlem Tutorial Program has grown from an organization with a $30,000 budget when she started to a $10 million enterprise today. Drawing on her experience caring for her older sister Narnie as she died, Milly became a board member of Concern for Dying, an early proponent of living wills. Later in life, Milly pioneered again, as one of the first to obtain a Masters in Health Advocacy from Sarah Lawrence College. She helped organize Jansen Memorial Hospice in Tuckahoe and became an active volunteer for the Cancer Support Team in Rye.

2013-12-25T00:00:00Z,"WILSON--Robert W. A unique, innovative and philanthropic man, died December 23, 2013 in New York City. He is survived by his brother William Wilson II, his nephew William Wilson III, and his niece Karen DeFiore. Born in Detroit, Michigan in 1926, he graduated magna cum laude, Phi Beta Kappa from Amherst College and received a master's degree in economics from the University of Michigan. He worked for a number of investment firms in the 50s and 60s and in 1969 started his own hedge fund. He was an astute investor and soon gained a reputation as Wall Street's premier short seller. Before retiring in 1986, he had been able to parlay an initial stake of $15,000 from his mother into an immense fortune and then spent the latter part of his life giving it away. He was an ardent conservationist, with the goal of preserving natural and man-made wonders. His philanthropy in that field was transformative for many of the institutions he supported. Ever the astute businessman, he was a pioneer in leveraged philanthropy, which, through the use of many unique and innovative programs, challenged the recipient organizations to achieve unique benchmarks, which strengthened and improved them far in excess of his contributions. His philanthropy was diverse, touching on many of his other interests: the arts, education, and policy reform, to name a few. Bob was cultured and well-read, with an insatiable appetite for newspapers and news journals. He loved fine restaurants and wine, and was passionate about opera and traveled all over the world to hear his favorites performed. He enjoyed movies and good jokes, and was delighted to email a long list of friends the latest and greatest anecdotes he had discovered. Bob was, no doubt, a man with the courage of his own convictions, albeit one who was willing to listen with an open mind to a new idea. Endowed with a brilliant mind, decisive and direct, he was always his own man. Throughout his career, he served on numerous boards and never hesitated to express his own strongly held opinions, no matter how controversial. Bob used his intelligence and his fortune to make the world a better place. That is his legacy. A memorial service for Bob will be announced at a later date."

He is survived by his devoted and loving wife of 73 years, Ruth Schlesinger Liss, his son Robert Liss, a psycho-analyst, writer, and basketball coach who resides in San Francisco, and his grandson, David Liss. Stanley Liss was born in New York City on November 22, 1916, the first son of Jack and Fannie Hecht Liss, followed by Seymour and Teddy. After moving to England, he matriculated at The London Polytechnic School, and studied at The London School of Economics. He then became a partner in Jack Liss and Sons Company, an innovative import/export business in New York and London, known for introducing the notion of half-sizes in women's dresses, and for stressing the importance of exemplary ethics in business. Stanley was an outstanding athlete. In 1936, when Hank Luisetti was revolutionizing basketball by shooting with one hand, Stanley responded intuitively to the smaller English ball by doing the same. Only an injury prevented him from representing England in the 1936 Olympics. The loving tributes of his family, friends and associates uniformly described Stanley as the quintessential model of the perfect gentleman."

2013-12-25T00:00:00Z,"BOURAS--Nicholas J. A member of the greatest generation and a brother in Christ, fell asleep in the Lord on December 22, 2013, while surrounded by his loving family and friends at his residence in Summit, NJ. He was 93 and was blessed to have lived a wonderful life. Mr. Bouras enlisted in the United States Army Air Corps in 1942. By the end of 1945, he attained the rank of Major and flew 44 combat missions in the European theater as the lead navigator and bombardier of 36 B-26 bomber aircraft. In 1946, the President of the United States awarded Mr. Bouras the Distinguished Flying Cross and the Air Medal with seven oak leaf clusters. His assignments included the Headquarters 9th Air Force, 386th Bomb Group and the Headquarters 9th Air Division, 552nd Bomb Squadron. After his honorable discharge from the military, Mr. Bouras returned to his position with the United States Steel Corporation, where he remained for twenty years. In 1960, he and his late wife, Anna K. Bouras, embarked on an entrepreneurial career that led to the creation of one of America's leading manufacturers of fabricated steel components for the commercial real estate industry. For nearly 40 years, his privately owned company supplied steel to contractors who helped transform New York's skyline. In 1970, this impact on the skyline began with the construction of World Trade Center Tower 4 and was followed by the construction of headquarter buildings for Hearst, Bloomberg, Bear Sterns, and Goldman Sachs, as well as the Time Warner Center. His company also supplied steel for the construction of professional sports stadiums and arenas, which included the Yankees, Giants, Patriots, Ravens, Redskins, Celtics, 76ers, Wizards, and the Devils. In 2007, Bouras Industries ceased operations with the sale of four companies and over 700 employees. Mr. Bouras' business achievements enabled him to positively impact the lives of thousands of people in need, including those in pursuit of higher education, as well as numerous non-profit institutions throughout the world. He exhibited extraordinary commitment to his local parish, Holy Trinity Greek Orthodox Church, which he helped found and served on the Parish Council for over 40 years. His support of the Ecumenical Patriarchate, the Greek Orthodox Archdiocese of America, Hellenic College, Orthodox Christian Mission Center, and numerous philanthropic causes typified his enduring generosity for humanitarian projects. A 25 year member of the Archdiocesan Council and National Council of the Order of St. Andrew the Apostle, Archon Vice Commander Bouras was central to expanding initiatives of these important institutions. His philanthropy empowered the Order of St. Andrew to develop a multifaceted domestic and international strategic plan to secure religious freedom for the Ecumenical Patriarchate, the spiritual center of the world's 300 million Orthodox Christians located in Istanbul, Turkey. Mr. Bouras is the recipient of numerous awards and honors, including an Honorary Doctor of Humanities from Hellenic College, the Ellis Island Medal of Honor, the Alpha Omega Council Lifetime Achievement Award, the Hellenic Heritage Achievement Award from the American Hellenic Institute, the Entrepreneur of the Year Award from Ernst and Young, the Humanitarian Philanthropic Award from the Cyprus Federation of America, the Athenagoras Human Rights Award from the Order of St. Andrew the Apostle, and the Republican Senatorial Medal of Freedom, the highest honor the Republican members of the U.S. Senate can bestow. Born in Pontiac, MI, and raised in Chicago, Il, Mr. Bouras was an alumnus of Northwestern University. Mr. Bouras is survived by his sister-in-law Tina Kariotis and brother-in-law John Mathrusse; nieces Susan Tseng (Greg), Pamela Kariotis (James), Elizabeth Smejda (Karolus), and Georgeane Valos (John); nephews James Mathrusse (Jiemin) and Robert Kariotis; grandnieces Katie and Emma; and grandnephews Matt, Brian, Andrew, and Rocco. United States Presidents, world business leaders, and Veterans have had the distinct honor and pleasure to know and serve with Nicholas J. Bouras, who so distinguished himself in faithful service to his country, fellow man, and his beloved church. Funeral services will be held at Holy Trinity Greek Orthodox Church in Westfield, NJ as follows: A Viewing will take place on Friday, December 27, 2013 from 2pm to 8pm with Trisagion (Memorial) services every hour with Hierarchical Trisagion at 7pm.

2013-12-26T00:00:00Z,"BOURAS--Nicholas J. A member of the greatest generation and a brother in Christ, fell asleep in the Lord on December 22, 2013, while surrounded by his loving family and friends at his residence in Summit, NJ. He was 93 and was blessed to have lived a wonderful life. Mr. Bouras enlisted in the United States Army Air Corps in 1942. By the end of 1945, he attained the rank of Major and flew 44 combat missions in the European theater as the lead navigator and bombardier of 36 B-26 bomber aircraft. In 1946, the President of the United States awarded Mr. Bouras the Distinguished Flying Cross and the Air Medal with seven oak leaf clusters. His assignments included the Headquarters 9th Air Force, 386th Bomb Group and the Headquarters 9th Air Division, 552nd Bomb Squadron. After his honorable discharge from the military, Mr. Bouras returned to his position with the United States Steel Corporation, where he remained for twenty years. In 1960, he and his late wife, Anna K. Bouras, embarked on an entrepreneurial career that led to the creation of one of America's leading manufacturers of fabricated steel components for the commercial real estate industry. For nearly 40 years, his privately owned company supplied steel to contractors who helped transform New York's skyline. In 1970, this impact on the skyline began with the construction of World Trade Center Tower 4 and was followed by the construction of headquarter buildings for Hearst, Bloomberg, Bear Sterns, and Goldman Sachs, as well as the Time Warner Center. His company also supplied steel for the construction of professional sports stadiums and arenas, which included the Yankees, Giants, Patriots, Ravens, Redskins, Celtics, 76ers, Wizards, and the Devils. In 2007, Bouras Industries ceased operations with the sale of four companies and over 700 employees. Mr. Bouras' business achievements enabled him to positively impact the lives of thousands of people in need, including those in pursuit of higher education, as well as numerous non-profit institutions throughout the world. He exhibited extraordinary commitment to his local parish, Holy Trinity Greek Orthodox Church, which he helped found and served on the Parish Council for over 40 years. His support of the Ecumenical Patriarchate, the Greek Orthodox Archdiocese of America, Hellenic College, Orthodox Christian Mission Center, and numerous philanthropic causes typified his enduring generosity for humanitarian projects. A 25 year member of the Archdiocesan Council and National Council of the Order of St. Andrew the Apostle, Archon Vice Commander Bouras was central to expanding initiatives of these important institutions. His philanthropy empowered the Order of St. Andrew to develop a multifaceted domestic and international strategic plan to secure religious freedom for the Ecumenical Patriarchate, the spiritual center of the world's 300 million Orthodox Christians located in Istanbul, Turkey. Mr. Bouras is the recipient of numerous awards and honors, including an Honorary Doctor of Humanities from Hellenic College, the Ellis Island Medal of Honor, the Alpha Omega Council Lifetime Achievement Award, the Hellenic Heritage Achievement Award from the American Hellenic Institute, the Entrepreneur of the Year Award from Ernst and Young, the Humanitarian Philanthropic Award from the Cyprus Federation of America, the Athenagoras Human Rights Award from the Order of St. Andrew the Apostle, and the Republican Senatorial Medal of Freedom, the highest honor the Republican members of the U.S. Senate can bestow. Born in Pontiac, MI, and raised in Chicago, Il, Mr. Bouras was an alumnus of Northwestern University. Mr. Bouras is survived by his sister-in-law Tina Kariotis and brother-in-law John Mathrusse; nieces Susan Tseng (Greg), Pamela Kariotis (James), Elizabeth Smejda (Karolus), and Georgeane Valos (John); nephews James Mathrusse (Jiemin) and Robert Kariotis; grandnieces Katie and Emma; and grandnephews Matt, Brian, Andrew, and Rocco. United States Presidents, world business leaders, and Veterans have had the distinct honor and pleasure to know and serve with Nicholas J.

Born in Detroit, Michigan in 1926, he graduated magna cum laude, Phi Beta Kappa from Amherst College and received a master's degree in economics from the University of Michigan. He worked for a number of investment firms in the 50s and 60s and in 1969 started his own hedge fund. He was an astute investor and soon gained a reputation as Wall Street's premier short seller. Before retiring in 1986, he had been able to parlay an initial stake of $15,000 from his mother into an immense fortune and then spent the latter part of his life giving it away. He was an ardent conservationist, with the goal of preserving natural and man-made wonders. His philanthropy in that field was transformative for many of the institutions he supported. Ever the astute businessman, he was a pioneer in leveraged philanthropy, which, through the use of many unique and innovative programs, challenged the recipient organizations to achieve unique benchmarks, which strengthened and improved them far in excess of his contributions. His philanthropy was diverse, touching on many of his other interests: the arts, education, and policy reform, to name a few. Bob was cultured and well-read, with an insatiable appetite for newspapers and news journals. He loved fine restaurants and wine preceded by a good martini, and was passionate about opera and traveled all over the world to hear his favorites performed. He enjoyed movies and good jokes, and was delighted to email a long list of friends the latest and greatest anecdotes he had discovered. Bob was, no doubt, a man with the courage of his own convictions, albeit one who was willing to listen with an open mind to a new idea. Endowed with a brilliant mind, decisive and direct, he was always his own man. Throughout his career, he served on numerous boards and never hesitated to express his own strongly held opinions, no matter how controversial. Bob used his intelligence and his fortune to make the world a better place. That is his legacy. A memorial service for Bob will be announced at a later date."

2013-12-29T00:00:00Z,"BLUM--Martin H. M.D.,an extraordinary and dedicated teacher who influenced the lives and careers of hundreds of psychiatric residents during his long career at The Zucker Hillside Hospital died on December 4th. Teaching the art and science of psychotherapy is a daunting task. To do so with extraordinary patience and erudition, while pushing the trainee to recognize the complex interplay of the numerous factors that influence our perceptions, beliefs and behavior was as characteristic of Marty as the uniquely intoned 'hmm' which followed his comments. His ability to link diverse areas and aspects of history, the arts and human experience in the context of his teaching and supervision was a characteristic which made him one of the most consistently sought after and admired teachers, year after year. Even when an idea or interpretation was proven to be off the mark, it was provocative and useful as a stimulus to critical thinking. He taught us how to think and reflect, not only about our patients, but ourselves as well. What greater gift. Dr. Blum was on the staff at The Zucker Hillside Hospital for forty six years. He was always willing to help meet any clinical and teaching need that arose. He embraced new technology with greater ease than many of his younger colleagues, and was open to new systems, if they made sense, even into his 80's. He was voted teacher of the year on multiple occasions. His patients were enormously grateful to him for his ability to hone in on their particular problems, to make them feel special and understood, no matter what their condition. His intellectual curiosity led him to know an enormous amount about very diverse topics. He was a true gentleman. Martin Blum was born on October 20, 1932. He received his BA from Columbia University and his MD from The State University of New York College of Medicine in Brooklyn. He completed both a psychiatric residency and psychoanalytic training at SUNY Downstate Medical Center. He is survived by a son Asher, a daughter Agnes and two grandchildren. He will be sorely missed."

He was 94. Born February 28, 1919 in Lawrence, MA he was the son of the late Louis and Annie (Spector) Marshall. Alfred grew up in Beverly and graduated from Beverly High School. After graduation, he enlisted in the Navy and was enroute to Pearl Harbor in Hawaii on December 7th, 1941. On arrival he volunteered to be an underwater diver, repairing the ships that were destroyed in the attack. Following the war, he returned to live in Beverly. His many jobs included building homes and general contracting as well as welding, which he had learned in the Navy. On Enon Street in North Beverly, he started many businesses including a fruit stand, grocery store and an ice cream stand where he sold banana splits on Sundays for 29 cents to use the ripe bananas. He also ran an auction in the basement. In 1956, Marshall conceived the idea of a self-service department store offering brand names for less. It was on that spot that he opened the original Marshall's Department Store, which he helped build. Years later, after selling Marshall's in the US, he moved to the Caribbean where he opened Marshall's in St. Thomas, St. Croix and St. Maarten. American tourists leaving their cruise ships in St. Thomas were always pleasantly surprised to be greeted by the familiar Marshall's sign. Alfred loved to sail and to travel. He set up buying offices in South Korea and Hong Kong, importing all manner of merchandise to sell and distribute throughout the Caribbean. In St. Maarten, he started Marshall Motors and his grandson Aaron is still affiliated with the company.

2013-12-31T00:00:00Z,"LAZAROF--Henri. Prolific composer and educator, Henri Lazarof, passed away from Alzheimer's disease at his home in Los Angeles, California. Mr. Lazarof was born in Sofia, Bulgaria on April 12, 1943, where he spent his youth studying at the Jesuit Lycee Francais. As a student, he showed an early talent in music, and became a concert pianist before his teenage years. In his early teens, he turned to music composition. His family immigrated to Tel Aviv, Israel where he studied with Paul Ben-Haim, a prominent Israeli composer. During Mr. Lazarof's army service, he organized concerts throughout Israel for the Israeli troops. He won the first musical scholarship awarded in Israel to attend the prestigious Saint Cecilia Academy in Rome, where he studied with the renowned composer Goffredo Petrassi. Mr. Lazarof arrived in Rome speaking four languages fluently but not one word of Italian. In three months, he mastered the Italian language and became a tour guide. He finished his four-year courses in three years, and won another scholarship to Brandeis University in Massachusetts. There he studied under the guidance of American composers Arthur Berger and Harold Shapero, and became fluent in English, his eighth language. In 1966, Mr. Lazarof moved to California and became a Professor Emeritus at the University of California, Los Angeles, teaching music composition and organizing contemporary music festivals. From 1970 to 1971, he served as composer-in-residence in Berlin; in 1979 he held the same position at the highly acclaimed Tanglewood Music Center in Boston, Massachusetts. In 1982 Mr. Lazarof decided to solely focus his attention on musical composition. Throughout the course of his career, Mr. Lazarof had 126 works published with the Associated Music Publishers, Theodore Presser, Bot and Bock, and others. These works include seven symphonies, three concertos for orchestra, three violin concertos, three cello concertos, two flute concertos, a viola concerto, a piano concerto, 11 string quartets, and innumerable pieces for orchestra, chamber orchestra, small ensembles, solo instruments, and mixed chorus. Numerous works were commissioned and recorded, and premiered by various orchestras throughout Europe, Asia, and the United States, including Carnegie Hall in New York; ""First Symphony"" with the Utah Symphony Orchestra; ""Concerto No. 2 Icarus"" with the Houston Symphony Orchestra; ""Concerto for Oboe and Chamber Orchestra"" with the New York Chamber Symphony; ""Symphony No. 5 for Solo Baritone, Mixed Chorus and Orchestra"" with the Seattle Symphony Orchestra. Mr. Lazarof's passion for art was reflected in his music, such as the ""String Quartet No. 8,"" homage to Paul Klee, and ""Tableaux (after Kandinsky)"" premiered by Garrick Ohlson and the Seattle Symphony Orchestra. His prizes included first place in the International Tchaikovsky Competition; First International Competition from Monaco for Concerto for Viola and Orchestra; and First International Prize City of Milan La Scala Award for his musical composition, ""Structures Sonores."" He also received grants from the Ford Foundation and the National Endowment for the Arts, as well as two Grammy nominations in 1991 for Best Contemporary Composition and Best Classical Performance Instrumental Soloist(s) with Orchestra. Mr. Lazarof's compositions were known for their broad range of textures, dynamics, and diversity of rhythms. Many of his works used unusual, seldom written combinations of instruments. By refusing to settle within any one ideology or style even those of his own previous works Mr. Lazarof remained faithful to his principal of growth and exploration, producing a body of work that will endure. Survivors include his wife, sister, son, daughter-in-law, four stepdaughters and their spouses, and nine grandchildren. Services will be on Friday, January 3, 2014, at Hillside Mortuary in Los Angeles, California, at 2:00pm.

She was born in Greenwich, CT, in 1918 and grew up in New York City, where she was valedictorian of her class at the Lincoln School. Hilda graduated from Vassar College in 1940. After working for Theatre Arts Magazine she went to Washington, D.C., to work at the Red Cross during WWII, writing for its publication.

Within a week of Bill's death, she was photographing at Union Theological Seminary. In 1965 she started photographing for the World Bank. Over the next ten years she was sent to the Ivory Coast, Senegal, Spain, Portugal, Turkey, Malta, Jamaica, Mexico, Trinidad, Morocco, and Israel to photograph World Bank projects. She also served proudly as president of the Cosmopolitan Club. She was the most devoted, supportive, and loving mother, a rock of Gibralter not just to her children but also to her extended family and her friends.

2014-01-01T00:00:00Z,"LAZAROF--Henri. Prolific composer and educator, Henri Lazarof, passed away from Alzheimer's disease at his home in Los Angeles, California. Mr. Lazarof was born in Sofia, Bulgaria on April 12, 1932, where he spent his youth studying at the Jesuit Lycee Francais. As a student, he showed an early talent in music, and became a concert pianist before his teenage years. In his early teens, he turned to music composition. His family immigrated to Tel Aviv, Israel where he studied with Paul Ben-Haim, a prominent Israeli composer. During Mr. Lazarof's army service, he organized concerts throughout Israel for the Israeli troops. He won the first musical scholarship awarded in Israel to attend the prestigious Saint Cecilia Academy in Rome, where he studied with the renowned composer Goffredo Petrassi. Mr. Lazarof arrived in Rome speaking four languages fluently but not one word of Italian. In three months, he mastered the Italian language and became a tour guide. He finished his four-year courses in three years, and won another scholarship to Brandeis University in Massachusetts. There he studied under the guidance of American composers Arthur Berger and Harold Shapero, and became fluent in English, his eighth language. In 1966, Mr. Lazarof moved to California and became a Professor Emeritus at the University of California, Los Angeles, teaching music composition and organizing contemporary music festivals. From 1970 to 1971, he served as composer-in-residence in Berlin; in 1979 he held the same position at the highly acclaimed Tanglewood Music Center in Boston, Massachusetts. In 1982 Mr. Lazarof decided to solely focus his attention on musical composition. Throughout the course of his career, Mr. Lazarof had 126 works published with the Associated Music Publishers, Theodore Presser, Bot and Bock, and others. These works include seven symphonies, three concertos for orchestra, three violin concertos, three cello concertos, two flute concertos, a viola concerto, a piano concerto, 11 string quartets, and innumerable pieces for orchestra, chamber orchestra, small ensembles, solo instruments, and mixed chorus. Numerous works were commissioned and recorded, and premiered by various orchestras throughout Europe, Asia, and the United States, including Carnegie Hall in New York; ""First Symphony"" with the Utah Symphony Orchestra; ""Concerto No. 2 Icarus"" with the Houston Symphony Orchestra; ""Concerto for Oboe and Chamber Orchestra"" with the New York Chamber Symphony; ""Symphony No. 5 for Solo Baritone, Mixed Chorus and Orchestra"" with the Seattle Symphony Orchestra. Mr. Lazarof's passion for art was reflected in his music, such as the ""String Quartet No. 8,"" homage to Paul Klee, and ""Tableaux (after Kandinsky)"" premiered by Garrick Ohlson and the Seattle Symphony Orchestra. His prizes included first place in the International Tchaikovsky Competition; First International Competition from Monaco for Concerto for Viola and Orchestra; and First International Prize City of Milan La Scala Award for his musical composition, ""Structures Sonores."" He also received grants from the Ford Foundation and the National Endowment for the Arts, as well as two Grammy nominations in 1991 for Best Contemporary Composition and Best Classical Performance Instrumental Soloist(s) with Orchestra. Mr. Lazarof's compositions were known for their broad range of textures, dynamics, and diversity of rhythms. Many of his works used unusual, seldom written combinations of instruments. By refusing to settle within any one ideology or style even those of his own previous works Mr. Lazarof remained faithful to his principal of growth and exploration, producing a body of work that will endure. Survivors include his wife, sister, son, daughter-in-law, four stepdaughters and their spouses, and nine grandchildren. Services will be on Friday, January 3, 2014, at Hillside Mortuary in Los Angeles, California, at 2:00pm. In lieu of flowers, the family would appreciate contributions to the Henri Lazarof Memorial Fund, c/o American Youth Symphony, 3424 Wilshire Boulevard, Suite 830, Los Angeles, California 90010, (310) 470-2332."
2014-01-01T00:00:00Z,"TETENBAUM--Herbert, whose boyhood bout with oseomyelitis, a bone-marrow infection that sent him to the hospital for multiple surgeries as a child and engendered within him a lifelong reverence for the practice of medicine, died December 29, 2013 in Palm Desert, CA, after a short illness at the age of 92. A retired obstetrician-gynecologist long active in medical education, Dr. Tetenbaum had moved to the desert community from Long Beach, NY, six months earlier with Sylvia Tetenbaum (nee Balopole), his wife of 69 years, who survives him. He is also survived by his children, Barbara Shepard of Las Vegas, NV, wife of Curtis Shepard; Abraham Tetenbaum of Los Angeles, CA, husband of Elizabeth R. Shafer; and Zelda Yoder, Reading, PA, wife of Mark Yoder. Additionally, he is survived by seven grandchildren and four great-grandchildren. Three sisters survive him: Esther Heller, Mildred Berwitz, and Gloria Gimbel. He was predeceased by a brother, T. Leonard Tetenbaum and a sister, Beverly Schneider. Herbert Tetenbaum was born on March 25, 1921, at Beth-El Hospital in Brooklyn, NY, which later became Brookdale Hospital Medical Center during the 41 years he served on its medical staff. He graduated from Chicago Medical School (CMS), which later grew to become Rosalind Franklin University of Medicine and Science during his tenure on its Board of Trustees. Dr. Tetenbaum grew up in the Brownsville section of Brooklyn, the third of six children of Eastern European immigrants, Isaac and Anna Tetenbaum. He worked at his father's dry goods store and attended Samuel J. Tilden High School where he led the swing band to a city championship. As ""Ted Herberts,"" he played clarinet and saxophone at school dances and entertained at Catskill Mountains resorts during the summer. Dr. Tetenbaum attended the University of Texas at Austin where he majored in bacteriology, and drove the 1,750 miles back to Brooklyn every chance he got. He believed that attending school so far from home might give him an edge in applying to medical school as there were quotas in place restricting admissions for Jewish candidates from New York, but his admission was not immediate. Even the Army turned him down during World War II because of physical limitations resulting from his childhood operations. He worked in a defense plant before landing a job at the Rockefeller Institute in Manhattan as laboratory assistant to Dr. Karl Landsteiner, who in 1930 had won the Nobel Prize for discovering the blood groups. When Dr. Tetenbaum opened the letter that contained the news that he finally had been accepted to medical school, he was riding in a subway car with his girlfriend Sylvia, who exclaimed, ""Now we can get married!"" They sealed the bargain with a kiss and received a round of applause from their fellow passengers. Herb and Sylvia proved to be a formidable team in Chicago, together raising funds for the school, which attained its national accreditation the year he graduated. When they returned to Brooklyn and purchased their first home, which included an office for his general practice, the last thing in the world he expected was to be drafted. But the United States Army, now in need of physicians, had changed its mind and sent the growing Tetenbaum family to Fort Brooke in San Juan, Puerto Rico. There, by his own account, Dr. Tetenbaum attained the rank of Major, ""fought the battle of the Officers Club"" and acquired his medical specialty training. Back in Brooklyn, Dr. Tetenbaum became a Fellow of the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists and the American College of Surgeons, delivered thousands upon thousands of babies and remained deeply involved in the institutional lives of his school, hospital and various medical groups. For his tireless efforts on their behalf, he was showered with recognition in the form of dinners, tributes, awards, plaques, citations and statuettes. He especially prized his 1985 Distinguished Alumnus Award from Chicago Medical School where for several years he administered the Hippocratic oath to its graduating class. Dr. Tetenbaum earned the esteem and affection of all who knew him through loyalty, generosity, dedication, a Borscht Belt sense of humor and, when asked for it, sound advice. He lived to see his children's lives reflect his values. Barbara became a psychotherapist, Abraham a Broadway playwright and nonprofit executive, and Zelda an educator. His grandchildren and great-grandchildren gave him immense pleasure, and three family ""convocations"" on cruise ships were among the highlights of his later years. Dr. Tetenbaum was an avid music lover, theatergoer, horseback rider, reader, world traveler, extemporaneous speaker, mixologist and sports fan. He rooted for the home team, and when there was no home team, he rooted for the underdog. Having fulfilled his own dream, he encouraged and supported the aspirations of his family and friends. For someone who was not expected to make it out of childhood, he ended up touching and enriching countless lives."

In 1951, he joined the Washington D.C. regional real estate office of Equitable Life Assurance Society, now AXA Equitable, to start a 40 year career with that Company. Moving to the NY Home Office in 1979, he became Vice Chairman of the Board of Director of the Equitable Life Assurance Society and President and Chief Executive Officer of the Equitable Investment Corporation, responsible for all investment areas in 1987. Throughout his career, Holloway felt that in addition to responsibilities for wise financial management, large corporations also had obligations to support constructive improvement in their communities. Due to his vision and leadership, Equitable's portfolio of real estate investments, both as owner and lender, expanded greatly and contributed importantly to the growth and resurgence of many of the country's cities. In the late 1970's, while exploring South Florida real estate opportunities, Holloway developed a strong attachment to the area, and had been at least a part-time resident of Coconut Grove since then. Holloway is survived by his wife of thirty-one years, the former Rita DiGiallonardo, and by children Peter Eric, Sherry Elizabeth, Paul Buchanan, Anne Duke and Virginia Leigh, whose mother is former spouse Joan Briggs. Visitation will be at the Van-Orsdel Funeral Home at 3333 NE 2nd Avenue on Thursday, January 2 from 4-6pm. Final services and burial will be at a later date in his Durham birthplace. It is requested that in lieu of flowers, donations be made to the Duke University Libraries- in memory of Benjamin Holloway- PO Box 90581, Durham, NC, 27708."

He led Mount Sinai through periods of extraordinary growth, first as Chairman of the Development Committee, and later as Chairman of the Boards of Trustees from 1977 to 1985. The guidance and support Alfred provided during his tenure helped chart a new course for Mount Sinai's future, and was critical to the founding of the Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai as well as the creation of the Hospital's Guggenheim Pavilion, both of which greatly expanded Mount Sinai's teaching, research and clinical capabilities. Over the years he has generously supported institutional growth initiatives, including the construction of the Annenberg Building and the Campaign to Rebuild Mount Sinai. Alongside his wife Barbara R. Biben, a founding member of the Mount Sinai Adolescent Health Center Advisory Board, Alfred has also directed his support to the Adolescent Health program and endowment. Mount Sinai would not exist as it does today without Alfred's leadership, and we are deeply grateful for his many years of service, generosity and commitment to our institution. In honor of his many contributions, Mount Sinai was proud to award Alfred with an honorary Doctor of Humane Letters in 1997. He will long be remembered for his vision and wise counsel.

Review NY Times May 12, l989 ""Helene Brandt"" by Michael Brenson. Many solo and group shows - for CV see helenebrandt.com. I was blessed to be Helene's husband. We were married when she was just 18. We grew up, raised a family, and grew old together. We shared a love of classical music, hiking, camping, travel and living abroad. Helene loved languages and became fluent in French, Danish, and Italian. Most of all Helene loved making art in her studio at 43 Great Jones Street, NoHo. Many writers have created fantasy worlds, populated with unusual forms of life and explored by heroic mortals. Helene sculpted a welded steel collection of imaginary forms of life as well as her signature cages. It was her fantasy world and she was its hero. Her later work combined steel with other more organic materials like vegetables and roots in wall pieces that expanded her magic world. She has left us all grieving: her husband, Philip; two sons, David and Daniel; a daughter-in-law, Kristin; two grandchildren, Alexander and Christopher; and many friends and students. It must be so."

He attended Yale University, graduating in 1954, and subsequently served in the United States Army Counter Intelligence Corp. Following his military service, he earned an MBA from Columbia University, and pursued a successful career in private equity and investment management. In 1972, inspired by a lifelong passion for architecture, he enrolled in the University of Pennsylvania and received his Masters in Architecture. He will be remembered most notably for his extraordinary philanthropic vision, humble spirit, and charitable gestures for which he sought no accolades. His enduring contributions and community leadership are best described by his dedication to the public and private institutions of Rhode Island. He served on the Board of Directors of Fleet Bank, the Naval War College Foundation, St. George's School, was a Governor, Trustee and Chair of the Investments Committee for Newport Hospital, and a Governor of Lifespan. In 1986, with his wife Happy, he established the van Beuren Charitable Foundation. Through the Foundation he put forward his vision of public service. The Foundation became the largest contributor to the Newport Hospital Foundation; the driving force behind the creation of the Trinity Landmark Preservation Fund; an initial investor in the Aquidneck Land Trust; and funder of the Chair of Asia-Pacific Studies at the Naval War College. His lifelong love for architecture was demonstrated by his support of all Newport's historic buildings and sites. In 2013, in recognition of his untiring dedication to serving his community and his country, he was presented with the Navy Meritorious Public Service Award by Admiral Jonathan Greenert, United States Chief of Naval Operations. Beyond his civic commitments, his leisure activities were informed by his love of the outdoors, and his intellectual curiosity. He was an avid sportsman, particularly in fly-fishing, field shooting, and golf; an ardent consumer of history and current events; and a lover of dogs. Most recently, he chose to spend time in Boca Grande, FL. Beloved husband, brother, father, grandfather, Archie van Beuren is survived by his wife Happy; his sister, Marilla van Beuren; his three children, Barbara van Beuren, Archbold Dorrance van Beuren, and Andrea van Beuren; his grandchildren, Alexander Hill Glascock, Adrianne Glascock, Archbold Victor van Beuren, Andrew Hill van Beuren, Ainsley Dorrance Kass, Fiona Sarah Kass, and Lucian Evan Kass.

2014-01-05T00:00:00Z,"SALTZMAN--Arnold A.,Businessman, art collector, diplomat and beloved husband, father, grandfather, and great-grandfather. Died peacefully at home with his family in Sands Point, NY, January 2, 2014. To no one's surprise, he was at work in his Manhattan office until a few weeks ago. Born October 1, 1916, in New York City of immigrant parents, Isidore and Dora. Brother of Muriel and Ruth. Runner-up in a citywide grade school oratory contest, and upward from there. His principal at Brooklyn's Samuel J. Tilden High School recommended him to Columbia College, certain he ""would be a credit to his race."" Columbia opened the world to 16-year-old Arnold. President of his fraternity, tennis team member, a debater, economics and government major, with a single class in art history these formed four great passions of Arnold's life: business, government service, arguing, and collecting art. The fifth was family, starting with a sales call for his family's sweater company (Premier Knitting) to Abraham & Straus, where a beautiful young woman, Joan Roth, caught his eye and accepted his invitation for lunch (although she'd just eaten). Joan's mother learned that evening ""I just met the man I'm going to marry."" Married November 21, 1942, in a rabbi's study on West 88th Street, then off to a three-hour honeymoon on the train to Washington, DC, where Arnold worked on military procurement. During the war, Arnold served as Lieutenant J.G. in the US Coast Guard. Sons Robert and Eric were born in 1945 and 1947 and daughter Marian (Mimi) in 1951. Arnold merged Premier Knitting with Botany Industries, then became CEO of Seagrave Corp. (a NYSE company, later Vista Resources), which made Seagrave fire engines, paint, leather, glass and architectural window walls. He maintained a devotion to public service, during the Korean War, working for the Office of Price Administration, and later with USAID and advising the Office of Economic Opportunity, and Sargent Shriver's new Peace Corps (and giving a Seagrave fire engine to Adis Ababa). Arnold undertook diplomatic assignments for Presidents Kennedy and Johnson. In 1967, he marched in a Washington, DC demonstration holding his hand-made sign, ""Businessmen Against the Vietnam War"". In 1968, he received a Presidential Commendation for his work on the Atomic Weapons Non-proliferation Treaty. He was a close friend and senior adviser to Senator Hubert Humphrey during his run for President, and was chairman of the National Committee on American Foreign Policy and worked on US relations with the USSR, and later with the new republics after it broke up. Reciprocating at Columbia College, Arnold served as chairman of the Board of Trustees. He established the much-admired Double Discovery program, pairing college and Harlem students. He received the Columbia University Medal, and the Institute for War and Peace Studies, founded by President Eisenhower, was later named for Arnold. Grateful for his own opportunity, Arnold has given scores of scholarships both through university programs, and directly to young people eager to learn and in need of a financial leg up. At the 2012 Columbia College commencement, he walked behind the Class of 1936 banner, its sole representative, to the cheers of the new graduates. That art history class kindled a lifelong love of art. Arnold collected throughout his life, astutely studying and chasing paintings and sculpture -- in New York and Europe, at artists' studios, auction houses and art dealers buying, trading, and selling. He made a major gift, of his German Expressionist paintings, to the National Gallery of Art in Washington. He assumed direction and revitalized the Nassau County Museum of Fine Arts. He was a Trustee of the Baltimore Museum of Art. He and Joan established the Joan and Arnold Saltzman Center for Community Services at Hofstra University, and a group home in Glen Cove, NY, with the YAI Network. Arnold was a Trustee of North Shore University Hospital and Maimonides Hospital and a major donor to the New York Public Library. He was awarded honorary doctorates from Hofstra and Adelphi Universities. He adored his five grandchildren -- Xylon Saltzman; Chloe Saltzman, Gabriel Saltzman; Ian Gottschalk; Michael Saltzman; and two great-grandchildren, Theo and Saskia Saltzman and they loved and admired him often expressed with anecdotes and insightful ""Pop"" imitations. He was devoted to his granddaughter, Chloe, who was born with disabilities. Arnold was like a father to his nephew and nieces, Rick Salwen, Laura Salwen, Barbara Dash and Muriel Wolf. The love of Arnold's life was, and remained to his last day, his remarkable wife, Joan, who survives him. Everyone recognized this, as in this toast at his 80th birthday, ""To the best thing about Arnold -- Joan."" To which Arnold promptly assented. Services will be at Temple Beth-El, 5 Old Mill Road, Great Neck, New York, 11:30am Monday, January 6. In lieu of flowers, contributions may be made to Joan and Arnold Saltzman Center for Community Services at Hofstra University."

Helene loved languages and became fluent in French, Danish, and Italian. Most of all Helene loved making art in her studio at 43 Great Jones Street, NoHo. Many writers have created fantasy worlds, populated with unusual forms of life and explored by heroic mortals. Helene sculpted a welded steel collection of imaginary forms of life as well as her signature cages. It was her fantasy world and she was its hero. Her later work combined steel with other more organic materials like vegetables and roots in wall pieces that expanded her magic world. She has left us all grieving: her husband, Philip; two sons, David and Daniel; a daughter-in-law, Kristin; two grandchildren, Alexander and Christopher; and many friends and students. It must be so."

2014-01-06T00:00:00Z,"SALTZMAN--Arnold A.,Businessman, art collector, diplomat and beloved husband, father, grandfather, and great-grandfather. Died peacefully at home with his family in Sands Point, NY, January 2, 2014. To no one's surprise, he was at work in his Manhattan office until a few weeks ago. Born October 1, 1916, in New York City of immigrant parents, Isidore and Dora. Brother of Muriel and Ruth. Runner-up in a citywide grade school oratory contest, and upward from there. His principal at Brooklyn's Samuel J. Tilden High School recommended him to Columbia College, certain he ""would be a credit to his race."" Columbia opened the world to 16-year-old Arnold. President of his fraternity, tennis team member, a debater, economics and government major, with a single class in art history these formed four great passions of Arnold's life: business, government service, arguing, and collecting art. The fifth was family, starting with a sales call for his family's sweater company (Premier Knitting) to Abraham & Straus, where a beautiful young woman, Joan Roth, caught his eye and accepted his invitation for lunch (although she'd just eaten). Joan's mother learned that evening ""I just met the man I'm going to marry."" Married November 21, 1942, in a rabbi's study on West 88th Street, then off to a three-hour honeymoon on the train to Washington, DC, where Arnold worked on military procurement. During the war, Arnold served as Lieutenant J.G. in the US Coast Guard. Sons Robert and Eric were born in 1945 and 1947 and daughter Marian (Mimi) in 1951. Arnold merged Premier Knitting with Botany Industries, then became CEO of Seagrave Corp. (a NYSE company, later Vista Resources), which made Seagrave fire engines, paint, leather, glass and architectural window walls. He maintained a devotion to public service, during the Korean War, working for the Office of Price Administration, and later with USAID and advising the Office of Economic Opportunity, and Sargent Shriver's new Peace Corps (and giving a Seagrave fire engine to Adis Ababa). Arnold undertook diplomatic assignments for Presidents Kennedy and Johnson. In 1967, he marched in a Washington, DC demonstration holding his hand-made sign, ""Businessmen Against the Vietnam War"". In 1968, he received a Presidential Commendation for his work on the Atomic Weapons Non-proliferation Treaty. He was a close friend and senior adviser to Senator Hubert Humphrey during his run for President, and was chairman of the National Committee on American Foreign Policy and worked on US relations with the USSR, and later with the new republics after it broke up. Reciprocating at Columbia College, Arnold served as chairman of the Board of Trustees. He established the much-admired Double Discovery program, pairing college and Harlem students. He received the Columbia University Medal, and the Institute for War and Peace Studies, founded by President Eisenhower, was later named for Arnold. Grateful for his own opportunity, Arnold has given scores of scholarships both through university programs, and directly to young people eager to learn and in need of a financial leg up. At the 2012 Columbia College commencement, he walked behind the Class of 1936 banner, its sole representative, to the cheers of the new graduates. That art history class kindled a lifelong love of art. Arnold collected throughout his life, astutely studying and chasing paintings and sculpture -- in New York and Europe, at artists' studios, auction houses and art dealers buying, trading, and selling. He made a major gift, of his German Expressionist paintings, to the National Gallery of Art in Washington. He assumed direction and revitalized the Nassau County Museum of Fine Arts. He was a Trustee of the Baltimore Museum of Art. He and Joan established the Joan and Arnold Saltzman Center for Community Services at Hofstra University, and a group home in Glen Cove, NY, with the YAI Network. Arnold was a Trustee of North Shore University Hospital and Maimonides Hospital and a major donor to the New York Public Library. He was awarded honorary doctorates from Hofstra and Adelphi Universities. He adored his five grandchildren -- Xylon Saltzman; Chloe Saltzman, Gabriel Saltzman; Ian Gottschalk; Michael Saltzman; and two great-grandchildren, Theo and Saskia Saltzman and they loved and admired him often expressed with anecdotes and insightful ""Pop"" imitations. He was devoted to his granddaughter, Chloe, who was born with disabilities. Arnold was like a father to his nephew and nieces, Rick Salwen, Laura Salwen, Barbara Dash and Muriel Wolf. The love of Arnold's life was, and remained to his last day, his remarkable wife, Joan, who survives him. Everyone recognized this, as in this toast at his 80th birthday, ""To the best thing about Arnold -- Joan."" To which Arnold promptly assented. Services will be at Temple Beth-El, 5 Old Mill Road, Great Neck, New York, 11:30am Monday, January 6. In lieu of flowers, contributions may be made to Joan and Arnold Saltzman Center for Community Services at Hofstra University."

Following his military service, he earned an MBA from Columbia University, and pursued a successful career in private equity and investment management. In 1972, inspired by a lifelong passion for architecture, he enrolled in the University of Pennsylvania and received his Masters in Architecture. He will be remembered most notably for his extraordinary philanthropic vision, humble spirit, and charitable gestures for which he sought no accolades.

His lifelong love for architecture was demonstrated by his support of all Newport's historic buildings and sites. In 2013, in recognition of his untiring dedication to serving his community and his country, he was presented with the Navy Meritorious Public Service Award by Admiral Jonathan Greenert, United States Chief of Naval Operations. Beyond his civic commitments, his leisure activities were informed by his love of the outdoors, and his intellectual curiosity. He was an avid sportsman, particularly in fly-fishing, field shooting, and golf; an ardent consumer of history and current events; and a lover of dogs. Most recently, he chose to spend time in Boca Grande, FL. Beloved husband, brother, father, grandfather, Archie van Beuren is survived by his wife Happy; his sister, Marilla van Beuren; his three children, Barbara van Beuren, Archbold Dorrance van Beuren, and Andrea van Beuren; his grandchildren, Alexander Hill Glascock, Adrianne Glascock, Archbold Victor van Beuren, Andrew Hill van Beuren, Ainsley Dorrance Kass, Fiona Sarah Kass, and Lucian Evan Kass.

The Board of Directors and staff of the Christopher & Dana Reeve Foundation express great sadness at the loss of our Vice Chairman, Arnie Snider; he was an influential leader and visionary for the Reeve Foundation, sharing his stellar intellect and big heart for humanitarian efforts. What was truly unique about Arnie's arrival as a board member in 2005 was he had no personal connection to spinal cord injuries. His reasons for locking arms with the Reeve Foundation was fueled by a moral imperative to change the world and transform the quality of life for millions living with paralysis. He was instrumental in the wake of Christopher and Dana Reeve's untimely passing, pioneering new initiatives such as epidural stimulation and rallying for advanced rehabilitative methods through the NeuroRecovery Network. It is due to Arnie's unwavering commitment that the organization is on the precipice of discovering cures for paralysis. We will remember Arnie's wisdom and spirit, but most of all, his determination to achieve the ""impossible dream"" of redefining the reality for those with spinal cord injuries. In Arnie's honor, the Reeve Foundation will harness his legacy to move its mission forward with his vision shaping the future of the organization. Our thoughts are with Arnie's wife, Katherine, and the entire Snider family."

2014-01-09T00:00:00Z,"SCHIFFMAN--Gerald, PhD, SUNY Downstate Medical Center mourns the passing of Gerald Schiffman, PhD, distinguished service professor emeritus of microbiology and immunology. Along with the late Robert Austrian, MD, Dr. Schiffman developed and introduced the first effective, widely used vaccine to prevent a potentially lethal variety of bacterial pneumonia caused by Pneumococcus. His pneumococcal polysaccharide vaccine (PPSV23) stimulated global interest in efforts to block bacterial pneumonia by prior immunization. Dr. Schiffman's work established SUNY Downstate as a national resource for pneumococcal typing. He also developed a unique assay to test immune function. Although two vaccines against bacterial pneumonia were available in the 1940s, they were withdrawn from the market because most physicians preferred treating the disease with antibiotics rather than submitting the adult population to extensive injections with multiple vaccines, as a wide range of bacteria is known to induce life threatening lung infections. Dr. Schiffman demonstrated severe limitations in treating pneumococcal infections with antibiotic therapy, and, with Dr. Austrian, introduced a new vaccine in 1978. However, it was not until the 1990s, with the increasing pneumococcal resistance to multiple antibiotics, that the world of medicine fully accepted their wisdom. Pneumococcal vaccination has since become the established standard of care for high-risk patients. Dr. Schiffman was also known for developing a test to measure a wide range of immune system functions and disorders. His was the only laboratory to use this assay, and each year, about 100,000 samples from around the world were sent to him for analysis. In 2010, the State University of New York awarded Dr. Schiffman an honorary Doctor of Science degree. John F. Williams, MD, EdD, MPH, President Ian L. Taylor, MD, PhD, Dean, College of Medicine"

2014-01-10T00:00:00Z,"SNIDER--Arnold H. III, passed away Friday, January 3rd after a short but courageous battle with cancer. Arnie was 68 years old. Arnie was a loving husband, father and grandfather who not only achieved great success in his career on Wall Street, but was also a dedicated and tireless philanthropist. Arnie began his career as a financial analyst specializing in pharmaceuticals at Kidder Peabody. During his seventeen years at Kidder, he established and led a recognized team of health care analysts, served as Head of the Healthcare Research Group as Managing Director, and as Chairman of the Stock Selection Committee. He was considered a highly successful analyst and ""stock picker"", who was selected to the Institutional Investor All-America Research Team in 1986 and 1987. He was also ranked as the leading pharmaceutical industry analyst by the Greenwich Research Poll. Arnie moved to the field of asset management in 1988 when he joined Tiger Management, bringing his business acumen and deep knowledge of the pharmaceutical industry to his oversight of the firm's global healthcare investments. In 1993, he founded Deerfield Management Company, which specialized in healthcare equities, and served as Deerfield's Managing Partner until he formally retired in 2005. During retirement, he utilized his business and financial skills to successfully advise on a number of important business and charitable projects. He served as a Chairman of the Board of N30, a small, privately owned pharmaceutical company engaged in the development of novel drugs in diseases which currently have no cure. He also served as a trustee and as the Chairman of the Investment Committee for the Davidson College endowment, his alma mater where he was a champion of The Davidson Trust, committed to making Davidson accessible to all talented students regardless of their financial circumstances. While a Trustee, he created the Arnold H. Snider Scholarship, which provides full scholarships for two students in each class. As important as Arnie's professional accomplishments were, he was equally committed to a number of philanthropic endeavors. Arnie's expansive knowledge of the healthcare industry and drug development provided a foundation for his philanthropic efforts in a number of areas of medical and scientific research, including geriatric medicine, spinal cord injuries, and lupus. Along with his wife, Katherine, he endowed the Kate Mills Snider Geropsychiatry Outreach Program and Professorship Fund within the Department of Psychiatry and Behavioral Medicine at Wake Forest Baptist Medical Center. They also established the Arnold and Katherine Snider Geriatric Fund at Princeton Hospital. Arnie also served as the Vice Chairman, Board of Directors, for the Christopher & Dana Reeve Foundation and as Chairman of the Foundation's Research Planning Committee. In 2000, Arnie and his wife established Rheuminations, Inc. a foundation to support lupus research and develop educational programs for patients with lupus, through which they created The Mary Kirkland Center for Lupus Research at the Hospital for Special Surgery, a related Kirkland Scholar Program that has provided research grants to individual lupus investigators at academic institutions in the US and Canada, and an educational website for lupus patients. In 2003, they founded the Lupus Clinical Trials Consortium, Inc. to support the development of new therapies for lupus, which evolved into a multi-center lupus patient data base registry intended to support lupus research and related publications. Arnie received his BA from Davidson College and an MBA from the University of Virginia School of Business. Arnie was an avid reader of politics and history, and was devoted to classical music and to golf. He was a gentle, kind and generous person whose friendships were defined by warmth and loyalty. Arnie deeply loved and took immense pride in his family. He is survived by his wife, Katherine, daughter, Sarah Kirkland Snider Mackey, son, Ned Snider, son-in-law, Steven Mackey, daughter-in-law Marina Greenstein Snider, three grandchildren, Jasper and Dylan Mackey and Simone Snider; his brother, Lewis Brittle Snider of McLean Virginia, and a nephew, Britt Arnold Snider of Chevy Chase, VA. In lieu of flowers, contributions in Arnie's memory may be made to any of the following charities: Arnold H. Snider Scholarship at Davidson College; the Kate Mills Snider Geropsychiatry Outreach Program (GO) at Wake Forest Baptist Health, or the Christopher and Dana Reeve Foundation."

In 1947, as the first person in his family to finish high school, he graduated as valedictorian from St Mary's of Milford, and received a full scholarship to attend the College of the Holy Cross in Worcester, MA. During this time he developed his lifelong passion for literature, and received a Master's in English from Boston College in 1952. John then enrolled in a Ph.D program in English at the University of Wisconsin, but left in 1953 to enter the Catholic priesthood. He was ordained as a Franciscan friar after six years, and as Father Alfred Augustus, served in the priesthood for ten years.

2014-01-11T00:00:00Z,"LICHT--Paul. May 5, 1920 - January 8, 2014. Beloved husband to Vera and then after her passing, to the late Blossom, adored father to Beth, David, Larry and Judy, loving stepfather to Jane Melnick, David Melnick and Ed Melnick, loving grandfather to 19, and delighted great-grandfather to six. He was a man who loved to be busy, fixing things, making things. He loved travel, and the outdoors especially in Lee, Massachusetts where he was usually sailing, canoeing, chopping wood or fixing what ever was broken in the house. Poppi, as he was known to his children and grandchildren lived his life doing what had to be done for his family. When he left college to support his young family, he gave up his dream of becoming a chemist, and began working in a store, a store he wound up owning and running for the next 56 years, retiring at the youthful age of 81. His store, Canal Self Service was an ""everything store"" that took customers back to an era where they could, as the slogan said, ""Serve yourself and save"" in the days when lower Manhattan was home to industry. Paul found time to have fun. One summer while out on party boat to fish for bluefish, Poppi got seasick. But while suffering, he still had a positive attitude and Poppi said with a smile: ""Well, now you've got Hot Chum. Catch some fish!"" It seemed he could fix most anything including replacing all the copper pipes in his house in Valley Stream, LI and fixing the roof of the house in Lee, MA. As Poppi got older his determination and strength seemingly knew no bounds. In his late 80's he still went to the gym regularly. His strength was a marvel; he was respected by all of the weightlifters, all while wearing his blue jeans, flannel shirts and Leatherman. Poppi had a way of talking with people that garnered him many acquaintances throughout the Chinatown and Tribeca neighborhoods that he spent the past 30+ years in. All who knew him were touched by his generosity, his willingness to lend a helping hand and most importantly his love for family and friends."

He was just nine years old. Cooper was a spirited third grader who attended the Calhoun School. Cooper had a larger than life personality and will be massively missed by everyone who knew him.

Cooper will live in our hearts forever. We will never understand why we had to say goodbye so soon. Services will be held on Monday, January 13th at 11:45 at Riverside Memorial Chapel on 76th Street and Amsterdam Avenue.

2014-01-12T00:00:00Z,"LICHT--Paul. May 5, 1920 - January 8, 2014. Beloved husband to Vera and then after her passing, to the late Blossom, adored father to Beth, David, Larry and Judy, loving stepfather to Jane Melnick, David Melnick and Ed Melnick, loving grandfather to 19, and delighted great-grandfather to six. He was a man who loved to be busy, fixing things, making things. He loved travel, and the outdoors especially in Lee, Massachusetts where he was usually sailing, canoeing, chopping wood or fixing what ever was broken in the house. Poppi, as he was known to his children and grandchildren lived his life doing what had to be done for his family. When he left college to support his young family, he gave up his dream of becoming a chemist, and began working in a store, a store he wound up owning and running for the next 56 years, retiring at the youthful age of 81. His store, Canal Self Service was an ""everything store"" that took customers back to an era where they could, as the slogan said, ""Serve yourself and save"" in the days when lower Manhattan was home to industry. Paul found time to have fun. One summer while out on party boat to fish for bluefish, Poppi got seasick. But while suffering, he still had a positive attitude and Poppi said with a smile: ""Well, now you've got Hot Chum. Catch some fish!"" It seemed he could fix most anything including replacing all the copper pipes in his house in Valley Stream, LI and fixing the roof of the house in Lee, MA. As Poppi got older his determination and strength seemingly knew no bounds. In his late 80's he still went to the gym regularly. His strength was a marvel; he was respected by all of the weightlifters, all while wearing his blue jeans, flannel shirts and Leatherman. Poppi had a way of talking with people that garnered him many acquaintances throughout the Chinatown and Tribeca neighborhoods that he spent the past 30+ years in. All who knew him were touched by his generosity, his willingness to lend a helping hand and most importantly his love for family and friends."

He went on to create and manage computer systems for IBM and CBS and design software programs, working feverishly for years on a high-speed stock-trade software program before the concept became popular, and came close to putting the final touches on it before the onset of an intestinal disorder that eventually claimed his life.

After he was graduated, he returned as a full-time test engineer, with his initial assignments supporting the company's manufacturing activities for engines powering the majority of the military aircraft flown by the United States in World War II. After the War, Coar began a steady rise in responsibilities with Pratt & Whitney, and later with United Technologies Corporation, P&W's parent company. He was one of the key individuals who led Pratt & Whitney into gas turbine engine design and development, and was involved with every major P&W engine program. In 1956 he became the Chief Engineer at the Florida Research and Development Center in West Palm Beach, FL, which was the company's space and military engine organization. He had technical responsibility for the design and development of advanced propulsion systems, including the J58 Mach 3+ turbojet for the SR-71 ""Blackbird"" airplane, the pioneering RL-10 hydrogen-fueled rocket engine, high pressure rocket research, and the initial development of the jet engines powering many of the country's frontline military aircraft. In 1971, he was made a vice president and returned to Connecticut. He was responsible for commercial as well as military engine development, and oversaw the introduction of the powerful turbofan engines that made jumbo jets possible and revolutionized commercial air travel. In 1976 he became the executive vice president, and in 1983 he was named president of Pratt & Whitney. In 1984, Coar became the executive vice president of United Technologies. He retired in 1986. Coar had many lifelong interests and avocations, including golf and fine music. His family and colleagues marveled at his collection of orchestral recordings - and the audio equipment he used for listening to it. He became a dedicated sailor, and remarked after his first year with his own sailboat that he'd learned more about subsonic aerodynamics than he had in the previous 30 years. Coar was elected to the National Academy of Engineering, was a member of the American Society of Mechanical Engineers, and a distinguished life member of the American Society for Metals. He served on the National Research Council's Aeronautics and Space Engineering Board. Additional honors include the Society of Automotive Engineers' Franklin W. Kolk Air Transportation Award in 1985 and the American Society of Mechanical Engineers' prestigious George Westinghouse Gold Medal in 1986. He received the Daniel Guggenheim Medal in 1998 for notable achievement in the advancement of aeronautics. He held more than a dozen patents. Coar was predeceased by his wife Cecilie Berle in 1971, and by his wife Lucille Hicks in 2013. He is survived by his son Gregory, of San Diego, CA; his daughter Candace, of Roanoke, VA; his daughter Andrea Tittle, of Pittsburg, CA; his son Kenneth, of Raleigh, NC; and his brother Roger, of Redondo Beach, CA."
2014-01-12T00:00:00Z,"CAMPBELL--Esther Francis, Esther Francis Campbell of Southampton, New York, died January 2, 2014. She was born to Dr. Carl Bennison Campbell and Emma Frances Shaffer in Puritan Mines, West Virginia, on February 15, 1924. ""Estee"", as she preferred to be addressed, was valedictorian of the class of 1940 at Seton Hill Academy in Greensburg, Pennsylvania, graduating at the age of 16. She attended Allegheny College in Meadville, Pennsylvania, for two years before transferring to Penn State University to study journalism. At Penn State Estee met Charles Bishop Scarborough, Jr., of Scranton, Pennsylvania, whom she married in 1943 as he was training to fly B-17 bombers in World War II. They were divorced in 1954. Her second husband was Richard Gilliam Peabody of Kansas City, Missouri. Estee was an accomplished writer and actress, co-founding The Footlight Players in 1950, a theater company in Coshocton, Ohio, where she performed leading roles and wrote the playbills, setting the stage for two significant ""firsts"" in her professional life. Estee was Kansas City, Missouri's first female weathercaster, broadcasting on KCMO-TV, and was the first female critic for Daily Variety in Los Angeles, working with the redoubtable Army Archerd. She was a publicist for the movie industry until her retirement in 1991. Estee loved words. She was a strict and ruthless grammarian armed with a formidable vocabulary and biting wit. In retirement she began her days by doing the New York Times crossword puzzle in ink in twenty minutes, then venturing out to augment her income playing Bridge. Estee's youngest child, Cynthia Ellen Scarborough, preceded her in death, as did her only sibling, Mary Lois Summer. She is survived by two sons, Charles Bishop Scarborough III and Jeffrey Campbell Scarborough, two daughters-in-law, Ellen Ward Scarborough and Alice Hoppe Scarborough, seven grandchildren and four great-grandchildren.

With her mother, Susan Hoch Kubie, a pioneering gerontologist, lay analyst, photographer and interior designer, she lived in New York, Vienna and Lucerne before returning to the United States in 1936 and resuming residence in New York City with her father and her brother, and, later, with her step-mother Eleanor Gottheil Kubie. Annie was educated at the Horace Mann and Fieldston Schools, and at Radcliffe College and Barnard College (BA 1950). She later pursued graduate studies at New York University, where she took her MA in 1982 and was ABD in Medieval History. Upon her marriage in 1948 to Bernard Rabinowitz she moved for a year to Fair Lawn, New Jersey, and in 1950 to Nutley, where she lived until the death of her husband Bernard in 1996. Through her marriage she became a loving and engaged member of the extensive Rabinowitz-Sonenshein-Blumrosen-Pepkowitz clan of Nutley, Passaic and Clifton, establishing warm and life-long relationships with her extensive network of in-laws, nieces and nephews. She was a published poet, and the author of two novels, Knight on Horseback (Atheneum 1987) and Bethie (Atheneum 1989). Annie was at work on two additional books at the time of her death: a children's book about family life in a family which had lost a child to illness, and an adult novel about a feminist awakening in the New York psychiatric community of the 1940's. Annie was an enthusiastic amateur musician and a lover of early and Baroque music. She was a singer and a lutenist, and one of her greatest pleasures in later years was her lute studies with the well-known teacher and early music specialist Patrick O'Brien. She was a committed member of the St. George's Choral Society, and a cheerfully vociferous advocate within that group for performances of the music of Johann Sebastian Bach. During the nearly fifty years that she lived in Nutley, Annie was a community leader and a committed public servant, serving with distinction on the Boards of the Nutley Family Service Bureau, the Nutley Public Library and Planned Parenthood of New Jersey, and as an elected (and re-elected) member of the Nutley Board of Education. The friendships she made and preserved in her public endeavors were a sustaining element in her life. She was a proud and committed progressive Democrat. She is survived by her children, Daniel Lawrence Rabinowitz and his wife, Ann Freda Thomas (of Greenwich Village); Rebecca Susan Rabinowitz (of Delran, NJ); Sarah Judith Rabinowitz Mognoni and her husband Russell Mognoni (of Labrador Hill Farm, Waterford Works, NJ); and John Benjamin Rabinowitz (of Arlington, MA). She is also survived by much-loved grandchildren: Joshua Nachowitz and his wife Meghan Sheehan (of Brooklyn, NY); Caleb Lawrence Thomas Rabinowitz and his fiancee Lisa Walldez (of Santa Monica, CA); Samuel Dwight Thomas Rabinowitz (of San Francisco, CA); and Elizabeth Mognoni (of Waterford Works, NJ). There will be a Memorial Service for Annie on Tuesday, January 14th, 2014, at 10:45am. The Memorial Service will be held at the Greenwich Village Funeral Home, 199 Bleecker Street (between 6th Avenue and MacDougal Street), New York, New York, 10012. In lieu of flowers, contributions may be made in Annie's honor to Selfhelp Community Services, Inc., NY, NY; to the St. George's Choral Society, NY, NY; or to the NAACP Legal Defense and Educational Fund, Inc., NY NY."

2014-01-14T00:00:00Z,"RABINOWITZ--Ann Hoch Kubie, 85, died peacefully at home in Greenwich Village in the early evening of January 11, 2014. She was attended throughout her last, brief illness by her loving and grateful children and grandchildren, by her beloved caregiver, Sabrina Vasquez, and by the music of John Dowland, William Byrd, and Orlando Gibbons. She was predeceased by her much-loved husband of nearly fifty years, Bernard Rabinowitz, of Nutley, New Jersey; by her brother Robert Hoch Kubie, and by her step-brother John Jacob Benjamin. Annie was born in London in 1928 while her father, the distinguished neurologist and psychiatrist Lawrence S. Kubie, MD, D.Sc., was conducting research at Guy's Hospital. With her mother, Susan Hoch Kubie, a pioneering gerontologist, lay analyst, photographer and interior designer, she lived in New York, Vienna and Lucerne before returning to the United States in 1936 and resuming residence in New York City with her father and her brother, and, later, with her step-mother Eleanor Gottheil Kubie. Annie was educated at the Horace Mann and Fieldston Schools, and at Radcliffe College and Barnard College (BA 1950). She later pursued graduate studies at New York University, where she took her MA in 1982 and was ABD in Medieval History. Upon her marriage in 1948 to Bernard Rabinowitz she moved for a year to Fair Lawn, New Jersey, and in 1950 to Nutley, where she lived until the death of her husband Bernard in 1996. Through her marriage she became a loving and engaged member of the extensive Rabinowitz-Sonenshein-Blumrosen-Pepkowitz clan of Nutley, Passaic and Clifton, establishing warm and life-long relationships with her extensive network of in-laws, nieces and nephews. She was a published poet, and the author of two novels, Knight on Horseback (Atheneum 1987) and Bethie (Atheneum 1989). Annie was at work on two additional books at the time of her death: a children's book about family life in a family which had lost a child to illness, and an adult novel about a feminist awakening in the New York psychiatric community of the 1940's. Annie was an enthusiastic amateur musician and a lover of early and Baroque music. She was a singer and a lutenist, and one of her greatest pleasures in later years was her lute studies with the well-known teacher and early music specialist Patrick O'Brien. She was a committed member of the St. George's Choral Society, and a cheerfully vociferous advocate within that group for performances of the music of Johann Sebastian Bach. During the nearly fifty years that she lived in Nutley, Annie was a community leader and a committed public servant, serving with distinction on the Boards of the Nutley Family Service Bureau, the Nutley Public Library and Planned Parenthood of New Jersey, and as an elected (and re-elected) member of the Nutley Board of Education.

He was 82. His son Bill confirmed the death, which came suddenly after a five year bout with Alzheimer's disease. Mr. Kinder was born in Providence, Rhode Island on February 19, 1931, the son of Mildred Fearney and Harold Kinder. He grew up in Waynesboro, Virginia and was educated at Northfield Mount Hermon, Brown University (cum laude, Phi Beta Kappa), and Harvard Business School.

Subsequently, he was hired by the Ohrbach's family, where he was elevated to the position of Executive Vice President responsible for real estate development.

Some of the most notable projects in which he was involved include Queens Center Mall, Stamford Town Center and The Mall at Short Hills. Leonard's love for art led him to travel the world where he sponsored many talented, growing artists, including Dale Chihuly. He became an expert and avid collector of glass art and traveled as a guest of Chihuly to Israel in 2000 for a unique exhibition at the Tower of David Museum in Jerusalem. Leonard was a gifted, creative and courageous soul with a deep passion for life, nature, art, and all things beautiful. He was also a brilliant writer of poems. Below is an excerpt from a favorite poem by the poet William Penn: ""They that love beyond the world cannot be separated from it. Death cannot kill what never dies. Nor can spirits ever be divided, that love and live in the same divine principle, the root and record of their friendship. If absence be not death, neither is theirs. Death is but crossing the world, as friends do the seas; they live in one another still"". In lieu of flowers, donations can be given to Stand Up To Cancer at www.standup2cancer.org."

2014-01-15T00:00:00Z,"RABINOWITZ--Ann Hoch Kubie, 85, died peacefully at home in Greenwich Village in the early evening of January 11, 2014. She was attended throughout her last, brief illness by her loving and grateful children and grandchildren, by her beloved caregiver, Sabrina Vasquez, and by the music of John Dowland, William Byrd, and Orlando Gibbons. She was predeceased by her much-loved husband of nearly fifty years, Bernard Rabinowitz, of Nutley, New Jersey; by her brother Robert Hoch Kubie, and by her step-brother John Jacob Benjamin. Annie was born in London in 1928 while her father, the distinguished neurologist and psychiatrist Lawrence S. Kubie, MD, D.Sc., was conducting research at Guy's Hospital. With her mother, Susan Hoch Kubie, a pioneering gerontologist, lay analyst, photographer and interior designer, she lived in New York, Vienna and Lucerne before returning to the United States in 1936 and resuming residence in New York City with her father and her brother, and, later, with her step-mother Eleanor Gottheil Kubie. Annie was educated at the Horace Mann and Fieldston Schools, and at Radcliffe College and Barnard College (BA 1950). She later pursued graduate studies at New York University, where she took her MA in 1982 and was ABD in Medieval History. Upon her marriage in 1948 to Bernard Rabinowitz she moved for a year to Fair Lawn, New Jersey, and in 1950 to Nutley, where she lived until the death of her husband Bernard in 1996. Through her marriage she became a loving and engaged member of the extensive Rabinowitz-Sonenshein-Blumrosen-Pepkowitz clan of Nutley, Passaic and Clifton, establishing warm and life-long relationships with her extensive network of in-laws, nieces and nephews. She was a published poet, and the author of two novels, Knight on Horseback (Atheneum 1987) and Bethie (Atheneum 1989). Annie was at work on two additional books at the time of her death: a children's book about family life in a family which had lost a child to illness, and an adult novel about a feminist awakening in the New York psychiatric community of the 1940's. Annie was an enthusiastic amateur musician and a lover of early and Baroque music. She was a singer and a lutenist, and one of her greatest pleasures in later years was her lute studies with the well-known teacher and early music specialist Patrick O'Brien. She was a committed member of the St. George's Choral Society, and a cheerfully vociferous advocate within that group for performances of the music of Johann Sebastian Bach.

2014-01-16T00:00:00Z,"RABINOWITZ--Ann Hoch Kubie, 85, died peacefully at home in Greenwich Village in the early evening of January 11, 2014. She was attended throughout her last, brief illness by her loving and grateful children and grandchildren, by her beloved caregiver, Sabrina Vasquez, and by the music of John Dowland, William Byrd, and Orlando Gibbons. She was predeceased by her much-loved husband of nearly fifty years, Bernard Rabinowitz, of Nutley, New Jersey; by her brother Robert Hoch Kubie, and by her step-brother John Jacob Benjamin. Annie was born in London in 1928 while her father, the distinguished neurologist and psychiatrist Lawrence S. Kubie, MD, D.Sc., was conducting research at Guy's Hospital. With her mother, Susan Hoch Kubie, a pioneering gerontologist, lay analyst, photographer and interior designer, she lived in New York, Vienna and Lucerne before returning to the United States in 1936 and resuming residence in New York City with her father and her brother, and, later, with her step-mother Eleanor Gottheil Kubie. Annie was educated at the Horace Mann and Fieldston Schools, and at Radcliffe College and Barnard College (BA 1950). She later pursued graduate studies at New York University, where she took her MA in 1982 and was ABD in Medieval History. Upon her marriage in 1948 to Bernard Rabinowitz she moved for a year to Fair Lawn, New Jersey, and in 1950 to Nutley, where she lived until the death of her husband Bernard in 1996. Through her marriage she became a loving and engaged member of the extensive Rabinowitz-Sonenshein-Blumrosen-Pepkowitz clan of Nutley, Passaic and Clifton, establishing warm and life-long relationships with her extensive network of in-laws, nieces and nephews. She was a published poet, and the author of two novels, Knight on Horseback (Atheneum 1987) and Bethie (Atheneum 1989). Annie was at work on two additional books at the time of her death: a children's book about family life in a family which had lost a child to illness, and an adult novel about a feminist awakening in the New York psychiatric community of the 1940's. Annie was an enthusiastic amateur musician and a lover of early and Baroque music. She was a singer and a lutenist, and one of her greatest pleasures in later years was her lute studies with the well-known teacher and early music specialist Patrick O'Brien. She was a committed member of the St. George's Choral Society, and a cheerfully vociferous advocate within that group for performances of the music of Johann Sebastian Bach.

2014-01-17T00:00:00Z,"PAULIN--Sven M.D. Ph.D. Pioneer of Coronary Angiography, has Died at 87. (October 18, 1926-January 10, 2014) passed away suddenly and unexpectedly at his home on January 10, 2014. One of the pioneers in modern radiology, Dr. Paulin was highly regarded throughout the world for his work by both the radiology and cardiology communities. At the time of his death, he was Professor Emeritus at Harvard Medical School and had been working regularly in the Department of Radiology at the Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center, as he had for almost a half century. He led a full and active life until this death. Dr. Paulin was born in Bad-Muenster am Stein, Germany, and immigrated to Sweden in 1953 where he met his wife, Birgit, a few years later. In 1970 he immigrated with his family to the United States and became an American Citizen in 1979. He loved the personal and academic freedom that the United States provided him and his family. Dr. Paulin was an avid sports enthusiast, dedicated chess player, voracious reader, and art and oyster lover. In 1951, he graduated from the University of Mainz, Germany with a Doctor of Medicine degree. He then received the degree of Medical License from the Karolinska Institute in Stockholm, Sweden in 1958. This was followed some years later by the degree of Medicine Doctor (equivalent to a Ph.D.) from the University of Gothenburg, Sweden. In 1965, Coronary Angiography was a new field when Dr. Paulin, as a doctoral candidate at the University of Gothenburg, published his dissertation on the subject. His doctoral thesis, ""Coronary Angiography A Technical, Anatomic and Clinical Study"", written 50 years ago, was recognized as a landmark immediately after publication. Coronary angiography, the graphic demonstration of the coronary arteries in the living patient, is one of the most often practiced invasive diagnostic procedures today. His colleagues at Boston's Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center (BIDMC) say that is in large part due to Dr. Paulin himself. Shortly after the publication of the thesis, Dr. Paulin was invited to study at Stanford by Herbert Abrams, M.D. In 1970, Dr. Paulin became Radiologist-in-Chief at Beth Israel Hospital and was awarded a full Professorship in Radiology, at Harvard Medical School, Boston, Massachusetts. In 1974, he was further honored by being the first recipient of an endowed chair in Radiology by the family of Miriam M. Stoneman and retired from this position in 1994. He continued to work in the department until his retirement from medicine on his 87th birthday in 2013. Dr. Paulin is survived by his wife of 57 years, Birgit, and his four children Susanne, Magnus, Helena and Viveca. In addition five grandchildren, Elizabeth Michael, Magnus, Mattias, Axel and his sister Tosca Roeren and several nieces and nephews survive him. Funeral services will be private; a public memorial will be announced at a later date. In lieu of flowers, donations can be made to the Sven Paulin MD Radiology Research Fund. Checks can be mailed to: Trudy Howard, Office of Development, BIDMC, 330 Brookline Avenue, Boston, MA 02215. For gifts via check, make checks payable to ""BIDMC."" In the memo section, please annotate that the gift is in memory of Dr. Sven Paulin. For gifts via phone/credit card, contact Trudy Howard at 617-667-3393.

He was 77 years old. Jon was born to William and Dorothy Anderson on March 13, 1936, on St. Urbain Street, the main drag of Montreal's immigrant district, home to many writers including Saul Bellow and Mordecai Richler. In 1952, he graduated from Westmount High School, sharing with Leonard Cohen an English teacher who taught them both how to ""write tight."" Inspired by an uncle, Johnny Walsh, a legendary crime reporter in Montreal, he started in journalism by describing contentious town council meetings for the Sackville Tribune-Post while completing a Bachelor of Arts degree (1955) at Mount Allison University. Before graduating from McGill University Law School in 1959, he reported for the Montreal Gazette, covering everything from theater to political riots. In 1960, he became Montreal bureau chief for TIME, an assignment that triggered a Mafia death threat for his coverage of their local crimes. Transferred by TIME to Chicago in 1963, he contributed to major stories on football star Jim Brown, archaeologist Nelson Glueck and the murder of eight student nurses. He later worked for the Chicago Sun-Times, Chicago Daily News, Chicago Tribune and Second City. In 1991, he earned a Master of Arts degree in non-fiction writing from the University of Iowa. His book, ""City Watch: Discovering the Uncommon Chicago,"" was published by the University of Iowa Press. Survivors include his wife and sweetheart, Pamela Sherrod Anderson, of Chicago; three beloved children, Ashley Prentice Norton of New York, Abra Williams of San Francisco and Anthony Anderson of Los Angeles; seven grandchildren, and a brother, Derek Anderson of Montreal. A son, Jon Gregory Anderson, predeceased him in 1999. In lieu of flowers, memorial gifts may be sent to Rush University Medical Center, Chappell Fund/ Hematology, 1700 W.

Richard led a private life and was a man of few words, but his true nature showed through in his unfailing acts of generosity, kindness and support. In times of need, Richard was always there, no questions asked. Our family is still in shock from his untimely passing. He will be missed dearly by all those whom he loved and who loved him."
2014-01-19T00:00:00Z,"SIEGEL--Alfred, The staff of the Center for Court Innovation deeply mourns the untimely passing of our dear friend and colleague Alfred Siegel. Over his long career in the field of criminal justice from his years as an Assistant District Attorney in the Bronx, to his tenure as deputy commissioner of New York City's Department of Probation, to his work with the Task Force on Transforming New York State's Juvenile Justice System, to his fifteen years here at the Center Alfred worked tirelessly to make New York a better, safer and more just place for all of us. He approached his work with a unique combination of wisdom, humility, generosity, and humor, and his absence leaves a deep hole in our lives. Alfred, the world is a better place because you were in it. You will be truly missed."
2014-01-19T00:00:00Z,"UROWSKY--Richard J. The lawyers and staff of Sullivan & Cromwell LLP mourn the loss of our beloved partner Richard J. Urowsky. Richard died at New York Presbyterian Hospital on January 14, 2014 after a long battle with cancer. He was 67 years old. We regret that Richard was taken from us so soon. Richard is survived by his sister, Ellen, brother-in-law Allen, nephews Andrew and Jonathan, cousins Edward, Norma, Peter and Robert, and many close friends and family. Richard was raised in the Bronx, and graduated from the Bronx High School of Science in 1963. He then attended Yale College, where he was a member of the Elihu Senior Society, secretary of the Aurelian Honor Society, a member of the Elizabethan Club, and an editorial assistant for The Review of Metaphysics. Richard was a philosopher from an early age. After eight straight semesters on the Dean's List and his election to Phi Beta Kappa, Richard graduated from Yale with high honors in 1967. He studied with the great legal philosopher H.L.A. Hart at New College in Oxford University as the C.P. Howland Fellow, receiving a degree in Political Theory and Legal Philosophy. Richard also was a graduate of Yale Law School, where he was an editor of the Yale Law Journal. Following law school, Richard was a law clerk for Justice Stanley Reed of the US Supreme Court. During his tenure at the Court, Richard also spent time working in the chambers of Chief Justice Warren Burger and Justices Potter Stewart and Byron White. Richard returned to New York to begin the private practice of law in 1973. He spent his entire legal career at Sullivan & Cromwell, starting as an associate in the litigation department, and becoming a partner of the firm in 1980. He represented a wide range of clients, from financial services firms to automobile manufacturers to commercial printing companies. Whether the case was large or small, Richard always brought his incisive approach to legal issues to bear. Richard was perhaps best known for leading the defense of Microsoft in several antitrust cases brought against the company during the 1990s by the US government. His command of the enormous factual record developed during a six-month trial and his mastery of a wide range of complex legal subjects during a multi-day oral argument before the en banc US Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit in February 2001 was a sight to behold. Richard was a brilliant lawyer, one who combined a rigorous analytical mind with a sparkling wit. Richard was also a wonderful teacher who was very generous with his time in mentoring younger lawyers. We all learned a lot from him. We were lucky to have had Richard as a friend and colleague for the last 40 years. He was, as one loyal client said upon hearing of his death, ""a force of nature and a very good human being."" He made us proud of his many accomplishments, but he also made us laugh. We will miss his great intelligence and his subversive sense of humor in equal measure."

2014-01-19T00:00:00Z,"PAULIN--Sven M.D. Ph.D. Pioneer of Coronary Angiography, has Died at 87. (October 18, 1926-January 10, 2014) passed away suddenly and unexpectedly at his home on January 10, 2014. One of the pioneers in modern radiology, Dr. Paulin was highly regarded throughout the world for his work by both the radiology and cardiology communities. At the time of his death, he was Professor Emeritus at Harvard Medical School and had been working regularly in the Department of Radiology at the Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center, as he had for almost a half century. He led a full and active life until this death. Dr. Paulin was born in Bad-Muenster am Stein, Germany, and immigrated to Sweden in 1953 where he met his wife, Birgit, a few years later. In 1970 he immigrated with his family to the United States and became an American Citizen in 1979. He loved the personal and academic freedom that the United States provided him and his family. Dr. Paulin was an avid sports enthusiast, dedicated chess player, voracious reader, and art and oyster lover. In 1951, he graduated from the University of Mainz, Germany with a Doctor of Medicine degree. He then received the degree of Medical License from the Karolinska Institute in Stockholm, Sweden in 1958. This was followed some years later by the degree of Medicine Doctor (equivalent to a Ph.D.) from the University of Gothenburg, Sweden. In 1965, Coronary Angiography was a new field when Dr. Paulin, as a doctoral candidate at the University of Gothenburg, published his dissertation on the subject. His doctoral thesis, ""Coronary Angiography A Technical, Anatomic and Clinical Study"", written 50 years ago, was recognized as a landmark immediately after publication. Coronary angiography, the graphic demonstration of the coronary arteries in the living patient, is one of the most often practiced invasive diagnostic procedures today. His colleagues at Boston's Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center (BIDMC) say that is in large part due to Dr. Paulin himself. Shortly after the publication of the thesis, Dr. Paulin was invited to study at Stanford by Herbert Abrams, M.D. In 1970, Dr. Paulin became Radiologist-in-Chief at Beth Israel Hospital and was awarded a full Professorship in Radiology, at Harvard Medical School, Boston, Massachusetts. In 1974, he was further honored by being the first recipient of an endowed chair in Radiology by the family of Miriam M. Stoneman and retired from this position in 1994. He continued to work in the department until his retirement from medicine on his 87th birthday in 2013. Dr. Paulin is survived by his wife of 57 years, Birgit, and his four children Susanne, Magnus, Helena and Viveca. In addition five grandchildren, Elizabeth Michael, Magnus, Mattias, Axel and his sister Tosca Roeren and several nieces and nephews survive him. Funeral services will be private; a public memorial will be announced at a later date. In lieu of flowers, donations can be made to the Sven Paulin MD Radiology Research Fund. Checks can be mailed to: Trudy Howard, Office of Development, BIDMC, 330 Brookline Avenue, Boston, MA 02215. For gifts via check, make checks payable to ""BIDMC.""

2014-01-19T00:00:00Z,"McGUIRE--John C.,May 6, 1920 - December 21, 2013. John C. McGuire, founder of McGuire Furniture Company, died peacefully in his home in Portland, Oregon on December 21, 2013, with his beloved daughter Jean holding his hand. John's wife Elinor, predeceased him in November 2005. He is survived by his son, Don, and his daughter-in-law Clay, his daughter Jean McGuire Coleman, and her children, Mark, Amanda, Jessie, Perry and Don Robert. He is survived by his sister-in-law Jean Stevenson (Mrs. Donald), his brother-in-law and sister-in-law Wally and Priscilla Stevenson, and his brother-in-law and sister-in-law Rees and Eloise Stevenson. John was born in St. Augustine, Florida on May 6, 1920. With his mother, Jessie Clark McGuire, and his brother, Bill, he spent his childhood in the Boston suburb of Hingham, Massachusetts. He graduated from Hingham High School and attended Northwestern University in Evanston, Illinois. His education was interrupted by the bombing of Pearl Harbor; John enlisted in the Navy. He was sent to flight school at the Naval Air Station in Pensacola, Florida, where he advanced to train new pilots. Also in Pensacola was Elinor Stevenson who was a navigation instructor and the First Assistant to the Commander of Training. John and Elinor met and fell in love, beginning their extraordinary lifetime partnership. Following the end of World War II, John retired from the Navy and began working for the Standard Vacuum Oil Company in the Far East. John returned to the United States and married Elinor at her family home in Portland, Oregon in 1947. John and Elinor settled in San Francisco. John initially found work selling newspaper ads for the San Francisco Examiner where he fortuitously ran into Dwayne White, a friend from the Navy. Dwayne had a warehouse full of rattan furniture which he was having trouble selling. John sold the furniture for him and wanted to order more but Dwayne declined. During his tenure with Standard Oil in the Philippines, John met Dona Maria Aboitiz, the matriarch of the prominent Aboitiz Company, who was making rattan furniture for her own use. John saw the potential of rattan and in 1948 contacted Dona Maria who agreed to produce rattan furniture for him to design and sell. The McGuire Furniture Company was born. Today, Josephine Booth, the daughter of Dona Maria, with her son, Robert Booth, still supply furniture to the McGuire Furniture Company. They became an extended part of the McGuire Family. In 1995, the Philippine Government, under the Presidency of Corizan Aquino, honored John with an award for his leadership in developing the rattan furniture industry in the Philippines. John was the innovator and promoter. Elinor was the accountant and business manager and had design and engineering experience with the Boeing Aircraft Corporation. Together these two entrepreneurs designed furniture for the company. With their patented invention of applying rawhide to bind the rattan and the introduction of color to the rattan, they created the most uniquely designed and fashionable rattan furniture on the market. The McGuire collection grew over the years to include the use of different materials including willow, redwood, teak, special bamboos and Oriental hardwood. With their keen sense of style and design excellence, John and Elinor created furniture which appeared in many of the finest residences, resorts, hotels, clubs, restaurants and even in the Nixon White House and yacht. Town & Country Magazine would write, ""A McGuire in the drawing room is on a par with a Rolls in the garage"". Some of the first McGuire designs are now part of the permanent Smithsonian Collection at the Cooper-Hewitt Museum in New York City. John and Elinor were leaders in the area of employee relations. They understood that their employees were essential to the success of the company, and they considered them a part of the McGuire Furniture Company family. John possessed a keen interest in others, as was shown to a new young employee Frank Doodha. He befriended and mentored this 15-year-old boy who under his guidance and friendship became President of the McGuire Company after the company was sold to Chicago Pacific in 1986 and John and Elinor retired. The Company is now owned by the Kohler Co. From their first years together, John and Elinor traveled the world promoting their furniture. John met thousands of people during his life and reign as Chairman and CEO of the McGuire Company, many became cherished friends. In their retirement, they continued to travel and visit friends all over the United States, and in London, Munich, Paris, Milan, Rome, Hong Kong, and of course, the Philippines. For each of us who knew John, we knew a man who was vibrant and fun, who had great wit which was formidable, amusing and contagious and who told delightful stories. He loved his family, and was a favorite Uncle to his many nieces and nephews and their husbands and wives and all their children. He was delighted to meet new people. He wrote hundreds of letters to friends throughout his life. How many of us got calls in the early morning as he was up early and ready to make contact! He had an amazing life and we are all enriched to have shared it with him John's family consider themselves remarkably fortunate to have been nurtured by him and he was a proud father of his children and an especially proud grandfather to his grandchildren. A memorial service for John will be held on Friday, February 14, 2014, at 2:00pm at the Trinity Episcopal Cathedral, 147 NW 19th Avenue, Portland, Oregon."

2014-01-20T00:00:00Z,"LOWENBERG--Sidney, My father, Sid Lowenberg, died today. He was 100 years old, turning 101 in June. Most people marvel at a life that spans an entire century for its mere duration, but I marvel at how he lived those 100 years. Born and raised in the Bronx, he met and fell in love with my mother, Beatrice, when he was only 16 years old. He was a smart young man and had dreams of becoming a doctor, but abandoned them before he could finish college so that he could marry and make a life with his one true love --Bea. Their love for each only grew stronger over the years as they began to raise a family. He was determined to give his family a good life, and before long he began a career that encompassed two full time jobs so that he could earn enough money to do so. By day, he worked in the General Post Office in NYC and by night, the educational department at the 92nd St. YMHA. I grew up watching his tireless energy, as he went from one job to the other with only one night and one day off each week. In those few hours each week he somehow managed to teach me life lessons that have molded who I am today. His work ethic was rivaled by no one I have ever known. His innate intelligence and commanding personality enabled him to balance both jobs, gain respect of his peers and friends, and adore his wife and children. His devotion to his family, however, was paramount to everything else. He prided himself on his success and he measured success by who he was as a man, a husband and a father. My brother and I learned about love and family by his example, not by his words. He adored the woman he married and for 78 years of marriage we witnessed their everlasting love affair that never wavered. Growing up in their presence was so awe inspiring that even as a teenage boy I would talk to my friends about my parents being the gold standard for love and marriage. He was my best friend, my champion, my advisor and my mentor. There was nothing that I did not share with him or confide in him--nothing. He was always there when I needed him, always emotionally available and always loved me for who I was without any judgment. He was kind and generous. He was loyal and filled with great integrity. He was strong and tough, but sensitive in an era when sensitivity in men was rare. In short, he was my hero. In the last hours of his life, his aged hand wrapped around my index finger and held on tightly, in the same manner that my five year old little hand once held onto his finger. Our eyes met for that last moment and I smiled at him, thinking, for as long as I can remember, he was the man I had hoped to become. I'm still trying."
2014-01-20T00:00:00Z,"LOWENBERG--Sidney,My grandfather died on Saturday following my grandmother three months earlier. He was 100, she was 98. They were married for 78 years. It is impossible to speak of one without speaking of them both. For 38 years they have been Mama and Papa never one without the other. It is hard to imagine life without them now. For all of us, they have been the guiding example for how to live your life. Each time I saw them I would try to analyze what made them have such good fortune in life. They were the most grateful people throughout the day they would remark on their good fortunes. They didn't measure the success of their life by money or stature, but against only what they had their family, their health, their love for each other and their entire family. As their grandchild, I felt loved in a way I have felt by no other. It is said that a grandparent can love their grandchildren in a different way than a parent can. Both mama and papa genuinely loved me unconditionally, thought the world of me, were rooting for me, were genuinely interested in me and whatever I was doing, took the time to always make me feel special and so loved, and made me feel the pleasure I had brought to their lives simply by living my own life. In turn, I tried to let them know as often as I could how much I loved them and how much they meant to me. I will always remember them holding hands on the couch, the warmth of Papa's smile and kindness in his eyes, Mama laughing at Papa, and hearing them say ""I love you"" to each other a hundred times throughout the day up until the very end. I am fortunate that they lived long enough to meet my son and know him for the first four years of his life. I know that he too, will remember them and carry their love throughout his own life. This is how they live on forever. It is a gift to have known them, my good fortune to have been loved by them, and my duty to try and live up to the legacy they leave behind.Tara Lowenberg"

2014-01-21T00:00:00Z,"ROSEN--Philip, of New Rochelle, NY passed away on Sunday, January 19, 2014. He is survived by his beloved wife Rita of 66 years, his loving children Phyllis Hadley and Michael Rosen, his sons-in-law Robert Landes and Richard Hadley, his daughter-in-law Stephanie Rosen, and his adoring grandchildren; Brett Raskin, Shaun Raskin-Deutschlander, Weston Deutschlander, Matthew Landes, Alexandra Landes, Jacqueline Landes, Alec Rosen, Kayla Rosen and Sierra Rosen. Sadly, Philip was predeceased by his daughter Wendy Landes on March 14, 2013. Born in the Bronx, on September 1, 1921, to Isadore and Anna Rosen, Philip was an outstanding student which enabled him to gain entrance into the Townsend Harris High School. He won a Merit Scholarship for mathematics and was admitted to Cornell University where he graduated in 1942 with a Bachelor of Science degree in Civil Engineering and a letter in Varsity Crew. Immediately after graduation he worked as an engineer for Stone and Webster while working for the United States government on ""The Manhattan Project."" During World War II he served his country as a Lieutenant in the United States Navy. After the War, Philip joined his father's masonry contracting business, Isadore Rosen and Sons, constructing many buildings throughout the metropolitan area. In addition to providing masonry services for other developers, Isadore Rosen and Sons went on to develop and build numerous buildings on their own behalf. Although success in business was very important to Philip, the idea of ""giving back"" and social responsibility were paramount. He felt fortunate to be able to contribute much time and energy to the many causes he believed in. Philip was a benefactor of Technion in Israel, a founder of The Chemotherapy Foundation, a benefactor of New Rochelle Hospital, The Juvenile Diabetes Foundation, The Cystic Fibrosis Foundation, and the Anti-Defamation League of B'Nai Brith. He was active in UJA, Federation of Jewish Philanthropies, and United Way. He was an honorary trustee of Temple Israel of New Rochelle, on the Board of Trustees of the Jewish Braille Institute (JBI), and was the founding member of the Albert Einstein College of Medicine's Young Men's Division. Philip and Rita were honored with the Lifetime Achievement Award, in 2004 and Philip remained a ""Life Overseer"" on The Board of Overseers of the Albert Einstein College of Medicine. Philip was a man of many hobbies. He loved literature and art, collecting stamps and shells but most of all he loved to ski. He skied well into his 80's and passed on that love to all of his children and grandchildren. Philip had a tremendous zest for life and felt he truly got the opportunity to live his American dream. He was loved by many and will be missed. A funeral service will be held on Wednesday, January 22, 2014 at 11:30am at Temple Israel of New Rochelle, 1000 Pinebrook Boulevard, New Rochelle, NY.

2014-01-21T00:00:00Z,"LOWENBERG--Sidney, My father, Sid Lowenberg, died today. He was 100 years old, turning 101 in June. Most people marvel at a life that spans an entire century for its mere duration, but I marvel at how he lived those 100 years. Born and raised in the Bronx, he met and fell in love with my mother, Beatrice, when he was only 16 years old. He was a smart young man and had dreams of becoming a doctor, but abandoned them before he could finish college so that he could marry and make a life with his one true love --Bea. Their love for each only grew stronger over the years as they began to raise a family. He was determined to give his family a good life, and before long he began a career that encompassed two full time jobs so that he could earn enough money to do so. By day, he worked in the General Post Office in NYC and by night, the educational department at the 92nd St. YMHA. I grew up watching his tireless energy, as he went from one job to the other with only one night and one day off each week. In those few hours each week he somehow managed to teach me life lessons that have molded who I am today. His work ethic was rivaled by no one I have ever known. His innate intelligence and commanding personality enabled him to balance both jobs, gain respect of his peers and friends, and adore his wife and children. His devotion to his family, however, was paramount to everything else. He prided himself on his success and he measured success by who he was as a man, a husband and a father. My brother and I learned about love and family by his example, not by his words. He adored the woman he married and for 78 years of marriage we witnessed their everlasting love affair that never wavered. Growing up in their presence was so awe inspiring that even as a teenage boy I would talk to my friends about my parents being the gold standard for love and marriage. He was my best friend, my champion, my advisor and my mentor. There was nothing that I did not share with him or confide in him--nothing. He was always there when I needed him, always emotionally available and always loved me for who I was without any judgment. He was kind and generous. He was loyal and filled with great integrity. He was strong and tough, but sensitive in an era when sensitivity in men was rare. In short, he was my hero. In the last hours of his life, his aged hand wrapped around my index finger and held on tightly, in the same manner that my five year old little hand once held onto his finger. Our eyes met for that last moment and I smiled at him, thinking, for as long as I can remember, he was the man I had hoped to become. I'm still trying."

She had had Alzheimer's disease for a few years. In 1990, after doing volunteer work in Peru, she and her husband, Dr. Robert Zufall, started the Dover Free Clinic, providing primary medical care to underserved people in Dover, NJ.

In 1956, along with her brother-in law, Joseph McVicker, she created Play-Doh. Joe had a company which made a doughy wallpaper cleaner. Kay suggested that this could be modeled, rolled out, cut with cookie cutters, and made into a creative children's toy. She and her husband suggested the name 'Play-Doh'. Joe produced and marketed it, and it has since become a worldwide product. Donations may be made in her memory to the Zufall Health Center, 18 West Blackwell Street, Dover, NJ 07801."

2014-01-26T00:00:00Z,"TRUBIN--Sybil, passed away on November 3, 2013 at the age of 88 after a long bout with COPD. The last surviving daughter of Bernard ""Barney"" and Jennie Trubin and sister of Ruth and Charlotte Trubin, Sybil grew up in Rye, NY, where her father, a self-taught contractor built homes and apartments, named streets after his daughters and bought property including a gully which early on became known locally as ""Barney's Folly"" but eventually became the land where the New England Thruway and the Cross Westchester Parkway intersect. Sybil majored in political science at the University of Wisconsin and was the president of the university theatrical group, the Wisconsin Players. Her first job in 1947 as a go-fer on the Broadway production of ""Brigadoon"" resulted in her being hired by its star, Marion Bell, and Marion's composer husband, Alan Jay Lerner. She later worked as a talent agent, at the production office of the City Center of Music and Drama, and at the production office of renowned Shakespearean actor and producer Maurice Evans. When in 1954 Sybil went on to produce her first season at the Cherry Lane Theater in New York City, the New York Times referred to her as ""a young lady from Rye."" That ""young lady"", with her partners Robert Merriman and Warren Enters with whom she shared life long friendships, produced five shows at the Cherry Lane and won the first Tony ever awarded to an off-Broadway organization for its presentations of among others, ""The Way of the World"" and ""Thieves Carnival"". In the mid 50's Sybil began her long association with stage and television director/producer George Schaefer, and in 1959 when George formed his own production company, Compass Productions, Sybil became its Vice President of Business Affairs - for over a decade, first as a talent consultant or in charge of casting and then supervising all business matters for Compass, Sybil was instrumental in the production of over 30 award-winning Hallmark Hall of Fame and other television productions. After the closing of Compass Productions, during the late 70's and early 80's, Sybil became Vice President of Business Affairs for Quinn Martin's QM Productions, one of the largest independent suppliers of dramatic television series at the time, including ""Streets of San Francisco"" and ""Barnaby Jones"", and later held the same position at Lorimar before retiring in 1987. Following her retirement, Sybil, a life long and passionate political liberal volunteered at the office of California State Senator and Assembly person Tom Hayden and at the Santa Monica Public Library. At the request of George Schaefer, Sybil came out of retirement to supervise the clearance and arrange for the television syndication and first home video release of ten of the classic Hallmark Hall of Fame shows which had been produced during the ""Golden Age of Television"". Sybil was a renaissance woman - interested and knowledgeable in business, politics, the arts and almost everything else, incredibly organized and efficient, with unlimited energy, enthusiasm and optimism. Her abiding belief in fairness and justice kept the words ""no"" and ""can't"" out of her vocabulary. She graduated from college when few women attended college; she went back to college to get trained as an accountant when few women became accountants; she was the head of business affairs at television production companies when few women were involved in television business affairs or production--and she did so with an accounting background when business affairs was almost exclusively the province of lawyers. Sybil will be remembered for her ability to light up any gathering and her gift for enduring friendships--they don't make them like Sybil any more. ""Aunt Sybil"" as she was affectionately called is survived by her nieces and nephews, Jennifer (and Charles) Graham, Liz (and Lance) Sussman, Bruce (and Anne) Zeller, Peter (and Nickie) Zeller, Bernie (and Joyce) Bogrow, Jan (and John) Fleder and Michael (and Moira) Bogrov and their families, by her surrogate niece and nephew, Jeanna Michaels and Steve Katz, and by friends all over the country."

She was raised in St. Albans, NY, graduating from St. Catherine of Sienna School, St. Agnes Academic High School in Rockville Centre, and St. Joseph's College in Brooklyn, NY, and received an MS in Guidance & Counseling from Fordham University. For many years, Dolores served in the Commack Public School system in Commack, NY, where she was Director of Special Education and Curriculum Director for the school district with a student body of 9,000. As a young mother and while teaching in Commack, Dolores continued her education and went on to earn her Ph.D. in Child Psychology from St. John's University. Dolores was known as a dedicated professional, keenly interested in the development of each and every child. She touched many lives on Long Island with her kind, thoughtful, brilliant mind that was always looking to advance education by offering alternative methods of teaching so that each child could learn. Dolores was a national pioneer in education in the early 1970's, introducing computers into every classroom and teaching the school district the benefits of technology for learning. In 1977, she created Project CAL (Computer Accelerated Learning), a pilot program to measure the effectiveness of using computers in an elementary learning environment that led to the district-wide implementation of a comprehensive computer-learning program. She also wrote about and promoted the use of computers for special needs education. Dolores lectured at conferences all around New York State about the program she had developed for Commack Public Schools. Many school systems from across the US visited Commack to learn how to develop a similar model. Dolores had many intellectual and creative interests, was a published poet, an avid gardener and traveled extensively throughout the world. She was actively involved with many adult education committees at her parish, Our Lady Queen of Martyrs Roman Catholic Church in Centerport, NY, and taught English as a second language to women immigrants with the Dominican Sisters of Amityville, NY, at their Motherhouse. Throughout her life, Dolores remained an active, outgoing and loving woman. She enriched the lives of countless students, parents, teachers and school administrators. She will be sorely missed by her family and those whose lives she brightened on Long Island and in NYC. Dolores was predeceased by her husband, William J. Shanahan, and her sister Rose Ann. She is survived by her husband, Francis X. O'Shea; a daughter, Jeanne Shanahan, of Hoboken, NJ; a son, William Jr., of Nissequoque, NY; grandsons, Connor and Christopher Langer, also of Hoboken; and one brother, Frank Yoerg, and his wife Kathy of Williamsburg, VA. There will be no calling hours. A memorial service will be planned in the future at Our Lady Queen of Martyrs Church, Centerport, NY.

2014-01-26T00:00:00Z,"SPOOR--Janet Spain, left this world in Salt Lake City, UT on January 18, 2014. Gracious, beautiful and loving, Janet was born in New York City to Dr. Will Cook and Grace Jones Spain on October 19, 1926. She attended Smith College where she graduated in 1948 with a Bachelor of Arts degree. On a weekend trip to Dartmouth College, she met the love of her life, William Howard Spoor. They were married in New York City on September 23, 1950 and embarked on what was to become an extraordinary life. Their first years were spent together in New York City and Chappaqua, NY where they began their family. In 1962, Bill was transferred to Minneapolis, MN by his employer The Pillsbury Company. There, they thrived for over forty years. They put down strong roots and became pillars of their community. When Bill was elected Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of The Pillsbury Company in 1973, he was widely quoted as saying that Janet ""Was the perfect wife and partner for this endeavor."" The two of them went hand in hand in everything they did. Janet was devoted to her family and friends and believed strongly in giving to others. Our mother loved people. She had an amazing memory for names, faces, places and events that was present until the day she died. She was elegant in both her manner and style. Genuinely kind and thoughtful, she was also generous to a fault. She loved to laugh, had a big, soft heart and a beautiful, engaging smile. She was an outstanding cook and threw large, elegant parties and served delicious food she made herself. She adored all animals and spoiled her pets (as well as her children) terribly. In order to be closer to their children and grandchildren, Janet and Bill moved to a hilltop in Salt Lake City where they enjoyed the peace and tranquility of the Wasatch Range with views of the city below. She delighted in feeding the deer and birds that flocked to her gardens. Her grandchildren were her pride and joy and they all benefited from her love and devotion. She was a member of numerous boards including The Center for the Study of The Presidency, University of Minnesota Nursing Foundation, Planned Parenthood of Minnesota and The Madeline Island Music Camp where she was honored by the establishment of the Janet Spain Spoor Scholarship Program. She is survived by her husband William H. Spoor, her children Melanie Grace Spoor, Cynthia Field Spoor (Douglas Howard), William Lincoln Spoor (Sarah), six grandchildren: Charles Spoor Howard, Anna Grace Howard, Blakely Madison Spoor, Savannah Spain Spoor, William Walker Spoor and Lincoln Campbell Spoor; her sister Joann Spain Rasmussen of Walton, NY and numerous nieces and nephews who loved her dearly. She had an immense impact on all who knew her and will be missed beyond words. With deepest gratitude to Dr. Anne Pendo, Becky Christensen, Claire Anderson, Lesila Kolomalu, Sue Christopherson, Dr. Jane MacPherson and the staff at Quality Solace Services. In lieu of flowers, please make a donation to the charity of your choice. A gathering of close friends and family is planned for a later date."

He is survived by his beloved wife Rita of 66 years, his loving children Phyllis Hadley and Michael Rosen, his sons-in-law Robert Landes and Richard Hadley, his daughter-in-law Stephanie Rosen, and his adoring grandchildren; Brett Raskin, Shaun Raskin-Deutschlander, Weston Deutschlander, Matthew Landes, Alexandra Landes, Jacqueline Landes, Alec Rosen, Kayla Rosen and Sierra Rosen. Sadly, Philip was predeceased by his daughter Wendy Landes on March 14, 2013. Born in the Bronx, on September 1, 1921, to Isadore and Anna Rosen, Philip was an outstanding student which enabled him to gain entrance into the Townsend Harris High School. He won a Merit Scholarship for mathematics and was admitted to Cornell University where he graduated in 1942 with a Bachelor of Science degree in Civil Engineering and a letter in Varsity Crew. Immediately after graduation he worked as an engineer for Stone and Webster while working for the United States government on ""The Manhattan Project."" During World War II he served his country as a Lieutenant in the United States Navy. After the War, Philip joined his father's masonry contracting business, Isadore Rosen and Sons, constructing many buildings throughout the metropolitan area. In addition to providing masonry services for other developers, Isadore Rosen and Sons went on to develop and build numerous buildings on their own behalf. Although success in business was very important to Philip, the idea of ""giving back"" and social responsibility were paramount. He felt fortunate to be able to contribute much time and energy to the many causes he believed in. Philip was a benefactor of Technion in Israel, a founder of The Chemotherapy Foundation, a benefactor of New Rochelle Hospital, The Juvenile Diabetes Foundation, The Cystic Fibrosis Foundation, and the Anti-Defamation League of B'Nai Brith. He was active in UJA, Federation of Jewish Philanthropies, and United Way. He was an honorary trustee of Temple Israel of New Rochelle, on the Board of Trustees of the Jewish Braille Institute (JBI), and was the founding member of the Albert Einstein College of Medicine's Young Men's Division. Philip and Rita were honored with the Lifetime Achievement Award, in 2004 and Philip remained a ""Life Overseer"" on The Board of Overseers of the Albert Einstein College of Medicine. Philip was a man of many hobbies. He loved literature and art, collecting stamps and shells but most of all he loved to ski. He skied well into his 80's and passed on that love to all of his children and grandchildren. Philip had a tremendous zest for life and felt he truly got the opportunity to live his American dream. He was loved by many and will be missed. A funeral service was held on Wednesday, January 22, 2014. Donations in Philip's memory should be made to ""The Wendy Walk"" (www.wendywalk.com) or to the Albert Einstein College of Medicine Men's Division."

Peter, Eileen, Debora, and Suzanne Lehrer pay tribute to the memory of Gene McGovern, a friend, business partner, godfather, mentor, and life inspiration who passed away too soon for someone with such a zest for life. Gene left a lasting impression on all whom he encountered, someone who wasted very few words, lived life on his own terms, had a remarkable sense of humor, and was utterly devoted to family and those lucky enough to be considered his true friends. His bigger-than-life stature, swagger, and Stetson hat belied a razor sharp mind and adaptability to situations and circumstances be it reconstructing the Statue of Liberty, managing the construction of EuroDisney, building Canary Wharf in London, baling hay on his beloved Castle Rock Ranch in Wyoming, or lavishing attention on his horde of grandchildren during visits to their homes and at his home in Boca Raton. Gene lived many lives in one lifetime. He was determined from a young age to be the best at whatever he did and in that he more than succeeded. For Peter Lehrer, who first met Gene McGovern on a construction jobsite 45 years ago and in whom he found a kindred spirit to create together one of the largest, most influential and innovative construction management firms worldwide, the art of friendship was perfected throughout whatever trials and tribulations came their way. As such, Gene was admired and appreciated by the rest of the Lehrer family as well. To Lisa, and to Phyllis, Eric, Danny, Derek, P.J., and all the family, we extend our heartfelt condolences."

2014-01-26T00:00:00Z,"McGOVERN--Eugene, age 72, passed away suddenly on January 22 in New York City. Gene was a resident of Boca Raton, FL, and Cody, WY. Gene was born in Manhattan on January 27, 1941 to Julie and Frank McGovern. He was a builder extraordinaire and the co-founder of Lehrer McGovern, Inc. in 1979, which grew to become one of the largest and most respected construction companies in the world. The company later merged into Bovis Ltd and, subsequently, Lend Lease. Gene's remarkable career as a leader in the construction industry spanned 50 years, and he was responsible for some of the largest and most visible projects ever constructed, such as Petronas Towers in Kuala Lumpur, Euro Disney in Paris, Canary Wharf in London, the renovation of the Statute of Liberty and Ellis Island and hundreds of monumental undertakings. A man of imposing presence and personality, he innovated techniques that revolutionized the construction industry. Gene not only led and managed thousands of workers, but took the time to train and personally mentor hundreds of people. Besides taking time to build a company, Gene was one of the founding members of the most important trade association in New York, CAGNY. After a long career in the United States, Gene ventured to Europe and Asia in the late 1980's and 1990's to create and manage companies and projects and adapted to all cultures and challenges he faced. No project or task was ever too complicated. Gene was one of the three arbitrators in settling the disputes at Ground Zero, and later was responsible for helping to steer the September 11 Memorial and Museum project to a timely completion. Gene, with his trademark cowboy boots and ever-present cigar, left memorable impacts on every life he touched, and created a legacy that will live on. With a dry sense of humor and absolute candor, Gene made things happen when he was on the scene, and the impossible became possible. Unquestionably, he was truly bigger than life, and a giant in the world of construction. Gene leaves behind his wife Lisa, his former wife, Phyllis, and four children, Eric (Donna), Danny (Tessa), Derek (Gina) and PJ (Allan) and 13 grandchildren; Ryan, Jordan, Christopher, Danielle, Phillip, Colton, Katie, Tyler, Garrett, Dillion McGovern and Gene, Maxx and PJ Middleton, and two sisters Lorna Mion and Patti Hahn and one brother Brian. McGovern and 4 dogs, Roscoe, Brie, Bogey & Ginger. A true patriarch in every sense, as a family man, father, and grandfather devoted to his family. We will miss him and cherish the time we knew him. Visitation will be at Frank E. Campbell's Funeral Home at 1076 Madison Avenue at 81st Street, New York, NY on Monday, January 27th 2014 with visitation between 2-5pm and 7-9pm with a celebration of Gene's life at 4pm.

2014-01-26T00:00:00Z,"GEIGER--Dr. Arnold, on Friday, January 17, at dusk, Dr. Arnold Geiger ""Cap"", Pop and ""The Fish Doctor"" - of Martha's Vineyard, slipped the mooring for his final voyage. He lived a rich and full 95 years. He was pre-deceased by his loving wife; Ruth Geiger. Arnold was born August 11, 1918, in New York City, attended New York University, and then the University of Pennsylvania College of Dentistry. Following a Surgical Internship at Harlem Hospital in 1941, Arnold embarked on a life-long career in dentistry. In 1950 he began a private Orthodontic practice in Manhattan and Port Chester, NY, finally retiring in 1995. Along the way, he taught dentistry at Columbia University, gave lectures at various institutions and was active in state and national dental associations. He co-authored a text book which was required reading at universities and translated into six languages. Over a career that spanned 45 years, Arnold improved the lives and smiles of countless patients. That was the professional side of ""Pop"". The other side was a crusty fisherman, at home on his beloved boat, the Noe-pe, in pursuit of stripers, blues, fluke, and lobster. He and Ruth first brought the family to Martha's Vineyard in 1961 for a two-week holiday - it immediately became a second home. As much as Dad loved fishing and his boat, Ruth preferred gardening in the rich earth of the Vineyard. Dad became quite the gardener himself. I'll always admire my father for the ease with which he wore this duality: medical professional in New York, and man of the land and sea on the Vineyard. Even when alone on his boat, surrounded by only sun, wind and ocean, he would smilingly receive a radio hail from Ruth just checking that he was well and the fish were biting. When Dad retired, he and Mom settled on the Island. Arnold was a life-long campaigner against racial, gender and class prejudice, and the proliferation of nuclear weapons. He loved music and the performing arts, Mexican painting and sculpture, and his many friends. Arnold also loved his dogs a Golden Retriever was always a constant companion. Pop was charming and warm; universally admired by people he met. He was also calm and logical a reassuring presence for his patients, and a source of sound advice for his family as we navigated the storms of life. With his quiet intelligence, high standards, and unwavering ethics, he has always been -- and always will be -- the family's moral compass. Arnold is survived by his children Julie Geiger; William and wife Donna Geiger; David Nathanson, wife Kathy McKeough, and their son Samuel; and Adam Geiger, wife Colette Beaudry and sons Addison and Aidan. All of us owe a special thanks to Sheryl Enos, CNA who cared for Dad with professionalism, love and compassion in his final months. Dr Geiger was a gentleman; a prince among men. His wish for his children was simple, but profound: a long and happy life. He led by example. Donations can be sent to Overlook CARE, 88 Masonic Home Rd, Charlton, MA 01507. Adam Geiger"

The son of Enno and Hildegard Ercklentz, who came to this country in the 1920's, Enno was born in New York City. At the age of 10, he found himself stranded with his parents and siblings in Japan at the outbreak of WWII, and attended St. Joseph's College in Yokohama. In 1947, the family was repatriated to Germany, where, he served as a civilian in the US Army in Frankfurt, Germany. In 1950 they returned to New York City, where Enno graduated in 1951 from the Collegiate School and in 1954 with a Bachelor of Arts from Columbia University. He then went on to earn a law degree from Harvard Law School in 1957. A highly regarded international corporate lawyer, Enno maintained an active legal practice up until his death. His acclaimed two-volume study entitled ""Modern German Corporate Law,"" is still in use as a reference work. Enno served for many years as the Chairman of the Deutsche Schule in White Plains, NY. For his contributions to the school, he was awarded the Cross of the Order of Merit by the Federal Republic of Germany. A devout Catholic, he was honored to become a part of the Order of the Teutonic Knights. An exceptional human being, he was charming, urbane, a marvelous conversationalist and a true gentleman. Anyone who met Enno fell in love with his contagious smile and laughter. His kind and polite manner belied a sharp and witty intellect. His knowledge and passion for music, history, geography and travel was encyclopedic, the result of a voracious reading habit and a brilliant mind. He was and always will be remembered as someone special. Enno was a devoted father to his two lovely and loyal daughters, Cornelia Ercklentz and Stephanie Ercklentz Coleman, and a doting and proud grandfather ""Opi"" to Devon, Blake and Kendall Coleman, to whom he affectionately referred as his ""little pups."" He is survived by his daughters and grandchildren, his son-in-law, Chase Coleman, his sister Hildegard Mahoney, his brother and sister-in-law, Alexander and Margild Ercklentz, his former wife and best friend Mai Hallingby Harrison, his sister-in-law, Eevi Truumees, as well as seven nieces and nephews. There will be a private funeral mass for the immediate family and a celebration of his life is planned for the Spring.

Johnson White House to assist tourism and a pilot launch predating for what is now NYC & CO. The next time you follow a color-coded line at an airport or hospital you can think of Reva for helping you to find your way. One of the few women stockbrokers in the nineteen sixties; then at an age when most retire, turned her love of art into culinary confections. Reva's talent spawned an industry's new dawn on the lost genre of sugar art. Reva dearly loved her friends and family and was truly grateful for all the kindnesses she received in her lifetime and the good wishes from many in her last days. She requested no funeral service and only wanted to send her love to all those with whom she spent happy times. Elegant, corn flower blue eyed Reva Mae younger than springtime and always young at heart, a glamour girl, Grande Dame, fashion plate, sportswoman, master chef, artist, hostess, animal lover, friend, aunt, cousin, daughter, wife, and mother extraordinaire, you taught us to walk through the storms with our heads held high, to walk on the sunny side of the street, put on a happy face and dream. Your love made our world go round. Since you're gone and won't be ours again, we'll remember when it was a party just to be near you. Together, wherever we go, we'll be loving you always. We had the very best when we got you for a mother. We only wish we could do it all over again. We will forever be your team. It has been the highest honor and greatest privilege to be your children. You lived an honorable life setting an example for all who follow. Reva has now joined her beloved Seymour in spiritual eternity with their two hearts now resting as one. You will always be the first star we see at night. Feel the hugs and give one to Daddy."

2014-01-29T00:00:00Z,"STACOM--Matthew John, 95, died peacefully on January 25, 2014 in Aventura, Florida. Born and raised in Long Island City, Matthew was fiercely proud of his New York roots. His father, Matthew, was a builder of private homes and commercial properties and his mother, Helen, was a homemaker. He and his surviving brother, Ray, had an active and happy childhood. Matthew was a graduate of Xavier High School and received a Bachelor of Arts degree from Lehigh University in 1941. After serving as a lieutenant in the U.S. Navy during World War II, he obtained a Masters in business administration from New York University in 1948. Known to his friends and family as ""MJ"", as a bachelor, Matthew was well known for his good looks and impeccable dress. He was a man about town in New York City and a two-time winner of the New York Sun's Most Eligible Bachelor award. During his 67 year career at Cushman & Wakefield, Inc. (C&W), MJ played an integral role in the development, sale, and leasing of commercial properties in major cities throughout the U.S. Rising rapidly through the ranks at C&W, he held the title of number one sales professional year after year and was eventually promoted to Vice Chairman. He was a long-time Member of the Board of Directors and prominent shareholder in C&W and was intimately involved in the firm's sale to, and buy-back from, RCA. MJ's career accomplishments include representation of a who's who of America's finest corporations, developers, and owners, including HBO, Ebasco Service, Inc., and others too numerous to name. His crowning glory was the sale of two square blocks in downtown Chicago to Sears, Roebuck and Company. This led to the development of what was then the world's tallest building Sears Tower - for which Stacom served as the exclusive leasing and management agent. During his career, MJ also served on innumerable committees within the Real Estate Board of New York, including the Municipal Affairs and Civil Rights Committees. In 1962 and 1963 he won REBNY's Most Ingenious Sales award. MJ also served as Chairman of the Sales Brokers Committee and became the third Chairman of the Young Men's / Women's Real Estate Association of New York. An avid tennis player and swimmer, MJ truly enjoyed the outdoors. He was the beloved father of six children who he raised with his late wife, Claire Murphy, in Greenwich, CT. MJ was an active community member and strong supporter of the Greenwich Historical Society and Greenwich Library. His was a founding family of the Whitby School and he was extremely active at Greenwich Academy and Brunswick School, from which his children graduated. MJ was also an active member of numerous clubs including The Greenwich Country Club, The University Club, The Metropolitan Club, where he served on the Board of Governors, and the Fisher Island Club in Miami. The family patriarch, MJ hosted family gatherings and celebrations with gusto. He treasured the role of provider, storyteller, and family man. He adored his children and grandchildren, and enjoyed telling them unique tales of his life. After the death of Claire, MJ met and married Lesta Summerfield in 1983. They enjoyed a glorious life together which led from Manhattan to Fisher Island and, finally, to Aventura, Florida. Matthew is survived by his beloved wife, Lesta, his brother Ray, and his beloved children and their families, including his daughter Pat; daughter Stacy and her husband Eric Ossorio and their children Willem, Kane and Beau; daughter Tara and her husband Arthur Diedrick; daughter Darcy and her husband Chris Kraus and their children Amber and Teal; son Matthew, and daughter Beau and her husband Daniel Gerson and their children Claire and Asher. Matthew is also survived by his beloved stepdaughters and their families, including Marianne and her husband Rick Dornfeld and their children Paul and Micah; Paulette and her husband Richard Landes and their children Andrew and Jane; and Melissa and her husband Chris Gough and their children Alexander and Cameron. In lieu of flowers, the family would sincerely appreciate donations be made to The Stacom Family Speaker Series at MJ's alma mater, Lehigh University.

Elsie painted and sculpted for many years and exhibited in multiple galleries in Washington. In the late 1970's, she ""discovered"" photography. In 1983, she was a founding member of PRISMA, a Washington photographic group. She was fascinated with technique, and worked in multiple formats with cameras that ranged from modern to primitive. She did multiple shows and trips, and published three books of photographs detailing her travels, particularly to Cuba. With a simple camera, she did wedding books in black and white attempting to capture the spirit of the event rather than its details. She traveled widely and her pictures reflected that adventurous spirit; two weeks before her death, she was in Aruba. Her travels also included trips to India to meet the Dalai Lama and to Brazil to meet John of God. An early marriage to Harry Hull III ended in divorce. She is survived by her husband, James Sprague; her daughters, Celina and Julia; and her brothers, William and Robert Youngman.

The Contemporary Freudian Track of The New York University Postdoctoral Program in Psychoanalysis mourns the loss of Professor Martin Bergmann, one of the leading scholars and practitioners in the field of psychoanalysis, beloved colleague, mentor, teacher and friend. We extend deepest sympathies to his wife, Maria Bergmann, son, Michael Bergmann and his grandson. Professor Bergmann died on January 22, 2014, just before his 101st birthday. Until the end, he kept a full schedule of students, patients, supervisees and writing. We witnessed his awe inspiring, creative odyssey through the latter part of his life. In addition to his treatment of patients and his teaching, especially of Freud, his prodigious contributions to the field included the areas of The History of Psychoanalysis, Nazism, Romantic Love, The Oedipus Complex, Psychoanalysis in Old Age and Shakespeare. Martin was passionate about teaching, independent and original thinking, new ideas and the uniqueness of each patient. He eschewed orthodoxy and fanaticism. He combined a formidable intellect with a sense of personal importance to patients and students. He was instrumental in preserving Freud's legacy but did so in a critical and intimate way. Martin was born in Prague, Czechoslovakia on February 15, 1913. He moved to Palestine when he was seven years old where his father, Hugo Bergmann became a world renowned scholar at the Hebrew University. He emigrated to the United States to study genetics. There he became interested in psychology. He served as a psychologist in the U.S. army and came to New York to pursue psychoanalysis. A memorial service will be held in the spring.

Her last position was Division Executive/Managing Director of the Special Loan Division, where she was responsible for Chase's global non-real estate-related troubled loan portfolio. Margaret ultimately left Chase to become CEO/CFO of a near-bankrupt oil distribution company in Connecticut, which she restructured and brought back to life. While Margaret was astute financially and a strong negotiator, her main priorities were family and friends. She had scores of very good friends on many continents, since she had a love for adventure and travelled widely from an early age to all parts of the globe. She kept in close touch with her family and friends and developed special relationships with their children. Margaret enjoyed the fact that her apartment in New York was a welcoming way-station for visitors from everywhere. Margaret was passionate about women's rights, education, international affairs, environmental conservation and the arts and, through the family foundation she headed, supported many philanthropic organizations, including Trickle Up (an organization helping women around the world escape extreme poverty), Planned Parenthood, the American Museum of Natural History, Wellesley College and Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute. Margaret is survived by her brother John E. Klein of Washington, D.C. and by her niece and nephew Jennifer Klein Seaman and Thomas Eddy Klein of New York City. She was pre-deceased by her brother Walter C. (Terry) Klein, Jr. Margaret is also mourned by her eight god-children. A memorial service for Margaret will be held at St. James' Episcopal Church, 865 Madison Avenue (at 71st Street), New York City on February 25 at 3:00pm. In lieu of flowers, contributions may be made in Margaret's memory to Trickle Up or to Planned Parenthood of New York City."

A multi-lingual expert in international film finance known for her keen trend spotting, negotiation skills, irreverence, wit, style, and indomitable spirit, beating the odds with a rare form of cancer that ultimately claimed her life.

Subsequently she was in-house counsel at Balthazar Pictures, then Scala Productions Ltd., establishing herself in European film acquisition, development, and related activities involving parties such as Miramax and Canal Plus. The bulk of her career was spent at Hallmark Entertainment/RHI Entertainment structuring production finance, tax incentives and co-production arrangements and liaison work with producers, distributors and broadcasters in the television industry. During this period she pioneered film production finance in Hungary and other Eastern European countries. Ultimately she founded Film Borders, Inc., a legal and financial consulting firm for film and television clients. She is survived by her husband, James H. Wildman, former managing partner of the King & Spalding law firm and founding partner of its New York City office; her father and step-mother, Dr. Julius H. and Mrs. Joan L.

Born on January 5, 1942, she was the only child of George Edward Fulop and Elizabeth Helen (Meruse) Fulop. Nancy was raised in Toledo, Ohio, first in its Birmingham neighborhood until her family moved to the Point Place neighborhood in the late 1940s. Eventually, she moved to New York City to practice law and into Lincoln Plaza Tower, an apartment building overlooking Lincoln Center and Central Park, where she lived from 1976 until her death. She was the wife of William P. Short III, whom she married in 1978, and the mother of Bradford W. Short, who was born in 1979. Both survive her. Until she became ill, she was an active member of the Certificate of Appropriateness Committee of Landmark West as well as of her building's co-op board. She was a parishioner of the Church of St. Ignatius Loyola, where she also served as a lector. She was especially fond of reading at the Easter Vigil and Christmas Eve Masses. After she retired, she was a student at the New York School of Interior Design (""NYSID""), where she was pursuing an associate degree in interior design. Her hope was to graduate from NYSID and work in the interior design industry. Nancy worked for Bowne & Co. Inc., first as Editor of its Legal Publishing Division from 1997 to early 2003 and then as Editor of Bowne's securities compliance resource, SecuritiesConnect, from 2003 to late 2005. Before working at Bowne, she was Publications Manager of securities publications at Matthew Bender. Nancy had more than 30 years experience in securities law. She practiced as a corporate and securities attorney in New York for ten years at Skadden, Burns Summit and Warshaw Burstein and as an assistant professor of corporate finance and securities law at Rutgers School of Law-Camden for four years. She was awarded a J.D. degree from The University of Toledo - College of Law, where she was first in her class, and an LL.M. degree from Yale Law School.

Elsie painted and sculpted for many years and exhibited in multiple galleries in Washington. In the late 1970's, she ""discovered"" photography. In 1983, she was a founding member of PRISMA, a Washington photographic group. She was fascinated with technique, and worked in multiple formats with cameras that ranged from modern to primitive. She did multiple shows and trips, and published three books of photographs detailing her travels, particularly to Cuba. With a simple camera, she did wedding books in black and white attempting to capture the spirit of the event rather than its details. She traveled widely and her pictures reflected that adventurous spirit; two weeks before her death, she was in Aruba. Her travels also included trips to India to meet the Dalai Lama and to Brazil to meet John of God. An early marriage to Harry Hull III ended in divorce. She is survived by her husband, James Sprague; her daughters, Celina and Julia; and her brothers, William and Robert Youngman.

2014-02-02T00:00:00Z,"SMOLEV--Richard, Gifted lawyer, published author, loving husband and devoted father and grandfather. After battling ALS for more than two years, Richard Smolev passed away on January 25, 2014 at age 65. A New York State Regent Scholarship graduate of Columbia University, Richard obtained his JD from Chicago's Northwestern University Law School. He began his career as a litigator before focusing on bankruptcy law, first as an attorney at Wiseman, Smolev and Solow, then at Sachnoff and Weaver, before joining Kaye Scholer as a Founding Partner of the Chicago office in 2000. Recognized by Best Lawyers in America, and recipient of a 2011 International Law Office (ILO) Client Choice Award, Richard focused on the insolvency aspects of leveraged and operating leases, and routinely worked with Kaye Scholer's structured finance and real estate securitization practices in their financing and capital markets transactions. Richard continued working at Kaye Scholer for a year after his diagnosis, retiring at the end of 2012. But rather than give in to his disease, Richard decided to pursue his lifelong passion for creative writing full-time. He achieved literary success quickly, when, in July 2012, Academy Chicago Press published his first novel, Offerings, about a female Wall Street executive who must prove her worth by putting together an unconventional IPO for a small games maker whose most valuable, but unknown, asset may be a painting stolen from a Jewish family as they fled Austria after the Nazi invasion. His second book, In Praise of Angels, a historical novel about the Reconstruction Era, was published a year later. Richard's decision to pursue a second career as a writer, even as his illness became more debilitating, and the joy he took in his family, inspired many who knew him. Noted for his wry wit, vast intellect and pragmatic approach to complex problems, Richard lived and died on his own terms. A resident of Bucks County, Pennsylvania, he is survived by his wife Nancy Alessi, sons Michael and David, grandchildren Lily, Ella, Jake and Bode, brother Dr. James Smolev and sister Carole Smolev Landau. While no funeral services will be held, family members request that donations be made in Richard's memory to the ALS Association's Greater Philadelphia Chapter."

2014-02-02T00:00:00Z,"KOVALESKI--Manya. Beloved and cherished wife of Fred, mother of Serge and mother-in-law of Jo, passed away on January 23, 2014. Born in Cairo, Egypt to parents who left Russia during the Bolshevik Revolution, Manya was a true internationalist blessed with extraordinary beauty, grace and a deep sense of compassion. She was a socially sought-after member of every community in which she lived. As part of Cairo's exclusive social milieu in the 1950's, she was often in the company of members of the Royal family, and King Farouk himself often enjoyed greeting her with the few Russian words he knew. Manya was a loving, inspirational mother whose guiding philosophy was that ""life is beautiful"" and ""out of everything bad, comes something good."" Educated at the Lycee Francais and English Mission College, she was conversant in six languages: French, English, Russian, Italian, Greek and Arabic. Following her marriage to Fred, this sophisticated and highly intuitive woman played a big role in furthering her husband's career as an international business executive. Over the span of nearly 20 years, his assignments took them to Cairo, Beirut, Khartoum, Yemen, Cape Town and Sydney. During their stay in Khartoum, the Station Chief for the CIA learned that Manya was a polyglot and recruited her to translate the tapes of wire-taps done on the Soviet Embassy. Manya was also witness to two revolutions overthrowing Sudanese governments. In Cape Town, Manya gave birth to her beloved son, Serge, who then spent several of his early years in Sydney. Once again, Manya showed her flair for fashion and was the subject of articles and pictorial features in such publications as Vogue magazine, Women's Wear Daily and the Sydney Morning Herald. Manya also had a talent for interior decorating, creating chic and comfortable homes for her family in the Point Piper section of Sydney and on Manhattan's Park Avenue, where she lived for more than four decades. Manya was a true socialite, hosting lavish dinners for friends and always attracting an eclectic mix of guests. Special among them was Oleg Cassini, the renowned fashion designer who became a life-long friend. Mr. Cassini, recognizing Manya's sense of style, proposed she join him in a new retail venture in which she would be the fashion director. As tempting as it was for Manya, she was a devoted mother to Serge, who was around 10 at the time, and declined the offer. During her many years abroad, Manya enjoyed memberships in a number of exclusive clubs including The Gezira Sporting Club (Cairo), The American University Alumni Club (Beirut), Rondebosch Tennis Club (Cape Town), White City Tennis Club and The American National Club (Sydney). In New York City, she belonged to the dining club, Doubles. Manya was also an extraordinary mother to two other children, from a previous marriage: Claudine, who passed away in 2007, and Pierre, who lives in France."

2014-02-02T00:00:00Z,"KNUTH--Charles Joseph, a chemical engineer who worked on the Manhattan Project, then as a research chemist for Pfizer, Inc., until he became Director of Patents for Pfizer International, died at his home in Manhasset Long Island on January 5. He was 89. The son of a mailman, Dr. Knuth was born in Queens in 1924. He attended Brooklyn Polytechnic Institute (now the Polytechnic Institute of New York University), from which he was drafted after receiving his Bachelor's Degree, returning for his doctorate after World War II. Sent to army specialized training at Ohio State University, he was suddenly, and with some secrecy, transferred to Oak Ridge, Tennessee, then to Los Alamos, New Mexico, to work on purifying enriched fissionable materials for the atomic bomb. While completing his doctoral research, Knuth was supported by a Pfizer fellowship, and upon graduation, he joined their research division in Brooklyn. His many discoveries were patented by Pfizer, and, after he had repeatedly rewritten the draft applications prepared by the patent specialists, he was offered a position in the Legal Division, eventually becoming Director of Patents. Patent work gradually became a job not of writing but of testifying at infringement cases: Knuth took well to the role of expert witness and helped Pfizer to win considerable infringement damages. But the hectic challenges of constant litigation prompted Knuth to take early retirement in 1987, when he took up a new career as a book-discussion leader at the Manhasset Public Library. These annual courses were extremely popular: they went on for eighteen years. Charles took great pains in selecting each year's ""syllabus"" and was able to enjoy literature, really his first love, in a life that had been dedicated to polymer chemistry and the abstruse byways of patent law. Dr. Knuth was married for 49 years to the former Nancy Addor, who predeceased him in 2001. He is survived by four daughters, Deborah Knuth Klenck of Hamilton, New York; Penelope Knuth of Santiago, Chile; Nancy Thompson of North Bay, Ontario; and Jane Patukas of Lancaster, Pennsylvania, and six grandchildren.

The Contemporary Freudian Track of The New York University Postdoctoral Program in Psychoanalysis mourns the loss of Professor Martin Bergmann, one of the leading scholars and practitioners in the field of psychoanalysis, beloved colleague, mentor, teacher and friend. We extend deepest sympathies to his wife, Maria Bergmann, son, Michael Bergmann and his grandson. Professor Bergmann died on January 22, 2014, just before his 101st birthday. Until the end, he kept a full schedule of students, patients, supervisees and writing. We witnessed his awe inspiring, creative odyssey through the latter part of his life. In addition to his treatment of patients and his teaching, especially of Freud, his prodigious contributions to the field included the areas of The History of Psychoanalysis, Nazism, Romantic Love, The Oedipus Complex, Psychoanalysis in Old Age and Shakespeare. Martin was passionate about teaching, independent and original thinking, new ideas and the uniqueness of each patient. He eschewed orthodoxy and fanaticism. He combined a formidable intellect with a sense of personal importance to patients and students. He was instrumental in preserving Freud's legacy but did so in a critical and intimate way. Martin was born in Prague, Czechoslovakia on February 15, 1913. He moved to Palestine when he was seven years old where his father, Hugo Bergmann became a world renowned scholar at the Hebrew University. He emigrated to the United States to study genetics. There he became interested in psychology. He served as a psychologist in the U.S. army and came to New York to pursue psychoanalysis. A memorial service will be held in the spring.

2014-02-03T00:00:00Z,"SHORT--Nancy Jean Fulop, 72, On Monday, January 20, 2014, Nancy Jean Fulop Short died unexpectedly at New York Hospital after a long fight with the side effects and complications resulting from the re-emergence of thyroid cancer. Born on January 5, 1942, she was the only child of George Edward Fulop and Elizabeth Helen (Meruse) Fulop. Nancy was raised in Toledo, Ohio, first in its Birmingham neighborhood until her family moved to the Point Place neighborhood in the late 1940s. Eventually, she moved to New York City to practice law and into Lincoln Plaza Tower, an apartment building overlooking Lincoln Center and Central Park, where she lived from 1976 until her death. She was the wife of William P. Short III, whom she married in 1978, and the mother of Bradford W. Short, who was born in 1979. Both survive her. Until she became ill, she was an active member of the Certificate of Appropriateness Committee of Landmark West as well as of her building's co-op board. She was a parishioner of the Church of St. Ignatius Loyola, where she also served as a lector. She was especially fond of reading at the Easter Vigil and Christmas Eve Masses. After she retired, she was a student at the New York School of Interior Design (""NYSID""), where she was pursuing an associate degree in interior design. Her hope was to graduate from NYSID and work in the interior design industry. Nancy worked for Bowne & Co. Inc., first as Editor of its Legal Publishing Division from 1997 to early 2003 and then as Editor of Bowne's securities compliance resource, SecuritiesConnect, from 2003 to late 2005. Before working at Bowne, she was Publications Manager of securities publications at Matthew Bender. Nancy had more than 30 years experience in securities law. She practiced as a corporate and securities attorney in New York for ten years at Skadden, Burns Summit and Warshaw Burstein and as an assistant professor of corporate finance and securities law at Rutgers School of Law-Camden for four years. She was awarded a J.D. degree from The University of Toledo - College of Law, where she was first in her class, and an LL.M. degree from Yale Law School. She was a graduate of St. Ursula Academy and Mary Manse College, both located in Toledo. She was valedictorian of her class at St. Ursula and was awarded the Bishop's Cross. At Mary Manse College, she graduated summa cum laude. Nancy taught high school art as well as English literature in the Toledo school system before starting her legal career. There will be a viewing on Monday, February 3, 2014 from 2:00-5:00pm followed by an evening viewing from 7:00-9:00pm at the Frank E.

2014-02-03T00:00:00Z,"HEYMAN--Anne, a wife, mother, philanthropist and social justice activist, died Friday at the age of 52. The cause was from complications sustained from a horse riding accident during a jumping competition at the Palm Beach International Equestrian Center in the town of Wellington. Born in South Africa to Sydney and Hermia Heyman, Anne Heyman was the second of four children and raised in Capetown. A born Zionist, athlete and go-getter from an early age, Anne was involved in the Jewish Zionist Youth Movement Habonim and just about every sport offered at her school. One day she picked up a table tennis paddle to learn to play and the next year she became the champion. This was an early indication of the extraordinary woman she would become. Her family moved to America when she was 15 and she immediately became active in Young Judaea. Through it, she participated in a year-long trip to Israel after High School. During the second week of the program, she met Seth Merrin, the man who would become her husband. Following the year in Israel, Anne returned to the United States where she attended and graduated from the University of Pennsylvania in 1982. After another year in Israel, Anne returned to the US to attend George Washington Law School where she became editor of the Law Review. In 1984 she transferred to Columbia Law School and graduated in 1985. Anne began her career shortly after as a corporate lawyer at Kronish Lieb Weiner and Hellman. Two years later she became an Assistant District Attorney in Manhattan, prosecuting white-collar crime. Seth and Anne marriedon August 17, 1986. They had three beautiful children - Jason Liav, Jenna Chen and Jonathan Gavriel. After Jonathan was born in 1994, Anne left her job as a lawyer to devote her time to her family. As a full time mother, Anne exposed her kids to every museum, concert and activity throughout New York City where they lived. The family also traveled the world in the summer where Anne would create activity books for the kids describing the history of the location with fun facts contained in coloring pages, word scrambles and crossword puzzles. Anne and Seth's connection to Israel remained strong and they raised their children with Hebrew as their first language, requiring Anne's parents to take Hebrew lessons so that they could communicate with their grandchildren. It was while at home with the kids that Anne began her next career as an activist, a philanthropist, and a light unto nations. As with everything Anne did, she did it with incredible passion and involved her entire family. Anne became involved in Dorot, a Manhattan based organization that mobilizes thousands of volunteers to provide food, service, and companionship to the elderly. In a short time, Anne joined the board and became its chairman. Anne also worked with Rabbi Jeff Summit at Tufts University Hillel to create an ongoing lecture series called ""Moral Voices"" that invites college youth to get involved and take action against social injustices and moral causes around the world. The program has since been expanded to other campuses. It was during the first year of the program in 2005 where the featured speaker was a famous genocide survivor. During this event Anne began to understand the severity of the orphan problem created by the Rwandan genocide in 1994 and was inspired to take action. Anne connected the challenge to the similar one Israel faced following the second World War. After the Holocaust, Israel created youth villages that housed, fed, clothed, and educated orphans in order to recreate a family environment of love and safety to help heal. Anne's vision was to adopt the ""youth village"" model and bring it to Rwanda. Not knowing anyone in Rwanda or anything about the country in no way deterred Anne. What she didn't know she learned, whom she had to know, she met. And what resulted would change the world. Anne raised millions of dollars and recruited an international team from Rwanda, Israel and the United States which included a partnership with Chaim Peri and Yemin Orde, a youth village near Haifa, to make her vision a reality. In August 2007, Anne broke ground for The Agahozo-Shalom Youth Village and in 2008, the village officially opened its doors to its first class of 125 students. Named by Anne's daughter Jenna, ""Agahozo"" is the Kinyarwanda word meaning ""a place where tears are dried"" and Shalom is the Hebrew word for peace. Students of the village are provided with new family structures, complete with resident ""House Mothers, Brothers and Sisters."" They are also given a world class education and are introduced to extracurricular activities including art, music, and sports. As part of their education, Anne made sure each child was taught the value of ""Tikun Olam"" the obligation every person has to try and repair the world and students find ways to contribute to the greater community on a weekly basis. Among the students, Anne was affectionately known as ""mom"" or ""grandmother."" Anne believed in transformation, and often reminded the students that ""if you see far, you will go far."" Each student knew that the future of Rwanda was on their shoulders, that they were being trained to be the country's future leaders, its greatest hope and each student rose to the challenge. By the time the first class graduated in 2013, the village was home to 500 students. Anne's efforts have been recognized globally."

He earned an MBA at Northwestern University's Kellogg School of Management in 1982. He started his banking career with Continental Illinois National Bank in Chicago. He held senior positions at Merrill Lynch and Deutsche Bank in New York and London and had recently retired from Deutsche Bank. He was a visionary financial executive and an inspiring mentor, considered to be among the finest minds in the fields of risk and capital management. Those who loved him most will remember him by his devotion to his family, brilliance, humility, eloquence, deep laugh, and love of cooking. Bill had a curiosity about all aspects of life, reading and traveling widely and relishing conversation with family and friends old and new. He was a compass, and his guidance cannot be replaced. A memorial service will be held on Saturday, February 8th, at 3pm at The Brick Presbyterian Church, Park Avenue at 91st Street. Memorials may be given to the National Institute of Mental Health."

2014-02-05T00:00:00Z,"GALLAGHER--James Joseph, Of Vero Beach, FL, passed away on February 1, 2014 after a brief battle with cancer. He was 77 years young. Mr. Gallagher, best known as ""Jim,"" was born on August 29 in the Bronx, and raised in Elmhurst, Queens, where he attended Resurrection Ascension Grammar School. He graduated from Xavier High School in Manhattan in 1954, and attended the University of Mississippi. Baseball was Jim's first love and profession, and he played for the New York Giants, New York Yankees, and Kansas City Athletics organizations. When his pitching coach walked to the mound and told him it was ""time to figure out what he was going to do for a living,"" he did just that, joining the then-burgeoning outdoor advertising industry as an account representative for NOAB. Thus began a 45-year career in advertising that included a stint at J. Walter Thompson in New York, New Orleans and Detroit, and culminated in 33 years as president of his own firm, Gallagher Group, Inc., from which he retired in 2005. In retirement, he and his wife of 54 years, Ann, relocated from Manhattan to Vero Beach, FL, and took up residence at Orchid Island Golf & Beach Club. Jim was an avid reader, golfer and grandfather. He enjoyed baseball, fine cuisine, movies, theatre, travel, his beloved New York Giants, Mets, and Rangers, people everywhere, a good martini, a good laugh and a good story not necessarily in that order. He was an immensely gregarious and curious man who genuinely engaged with everyone he met, regardless of their station in life, and charmed all with his ready wit. He was deeply loyal and generous to his friends and family, and in contrast to his larger-than-life personality, had a notorious soft spot for babies and cats. He was a member of the Metropolitan Club, a 35-year member of Sleepy Hollow Country Club in Scarborough, NY, and a member of both Orchid Island Golf and Beach Club and Quail Valley Golf and River Clubs in Vero Beach, FL. He served on numerous boards and committees of the many clubs and organizations he supported and was extremely active in the Xavier High School Alumni Association. Jim is survived by his wife, Ann (nee Corbin); his daughter Maura Wilson (Thomas) of Darien, CT; son Matthew (Fabrisa) of Matamoras, PA; son Thomas of Beacon, NY; grandchildren Liam Wilson of Darien, CT, Christian, James and Anna Maria Gallagher of Matamoras, PA; sister Maureen Vlack, of Edison, NJ; and many nieces and nephews. Services will be held Thursday, February 6, 2014 at 2pm at Holy Cross Catholic Church in Vero Beach, FL, followed immediately by a reception at Orchid Beach Club. A funeral Mass and Memorial Service will be held in March at the Church of St. Francis Xavier in New York City, followed by a reception at Sleepy Hollow Country Club and interment at Sleepy Hollow Cemetery in Sleepy Hollow, NY. In lieu of flowers the family asks that donations be made in Jim's name to Xavier High School, 30 West 16 Street, New York, NY 10011. Services are by Strunk Funeral Home and Crematory, Vero Beach.

After seven years living outside of Chicago (long enough to become a lifelong Cubs fan), he grew up in Bronxville, New York and proudly attended Williams College, in the class of 1944 (but actually graduating in September 1946 due to service in the First Army of the United States in Europe in the Second World War). After graduating from the University of Virginia Law School in 1949, he joined the New York law firm of Dwight, Royall, Harris, Koegel & Caskey, where he spent his entire professional life, retiring in 1989 as a senior partner and head of the litigation department (the firm then being known as Rogers & Wells). From 1952 to 2007, he resided in Scarsdale, New York where he was active in a range of civic affairs. In 1946 he married Barbara Bixler, whom he had met in 1941 while she was attending Smith College. She died in 1968. In 1969 he married Ruth Swan Boynton, who died in 1983. In 1984 he married Irene Lawrence, who survives him.

2014-02-06T00:00:00Z,"HIRSCH--Shay Yandell. June 8, 1947 to February 3, 2014. A beloved mother, wife, grandmother, social worker, friend, marathon runner, skier, writer, advocate, hiker, traveler, defender of the vulnerable and cancer warrior, passed away peacefully at home, surrounded by family, on February 3rd. Shay grew up in Boise, Idaho, where she was a 1965 graduate of Boise High School. Her childhood in the American West sparked a lasting love of nature. She entered a career in social work after graduating from Whitman College in 1969, and she devoted her life to others. In 1973, she married Greg Scrivner; the couple's two sons, Ian and Sean, were born in Alaska. After living in France, Ireland, Colombia, and New Jersey, Shay returned to Boise, where she became the director of YWCA's shelter for battered women, now called the Women's and Children's Alliance. At the 1988 New Jersey Waterfront Marathon, George Hirsch, who had met Shay only the day before at a marathon expo, and who was irrevocably lovestruck, ran through the crowded field of a race for which he had not registered until he found her. They ran the remaining 21 miles together, and they married the next year. Shay relocated to New York City, but the Hirsches maintained strong ties to Idaho, and they kept a home in Sun Valley. For the past eleven years, Shay wrote eloquently of her fight against multiple myeloma, an incurable blood cancer. Through two stem cell transplants and through more recent encounters with myelodysplastic syndrome and acute myeloid leukemia, Shay faced wave after wave of indignities with dignity and grace. She ended each post about her cancer battle by saying ""Onward!"" She embraced every part of life as an adventure, even the difficult ones. The impact of Shay's life is ""incalculably diffusive,"" as George Eliot once wrote. Shay's memory will be held closely in the hearts of her husband, George A. Hirsch, the chairman of the New York Road Runners; her son Ian Scrivner and spouse Cinzia Dinoi; her son Sean Scrivner and partner Rachel Teannalach; her stepsons David and William Hirsch; her father Robert Yandell, brother Robert Yandell, and brother John Yandell and spouse Julie Yandell; her grandchildren Anjali Hirsch and Rhys Scrivner; and her nephews Christopher and Nicholas Yandell. A celebration of Shay's life will be held in March."

2014-02-07T00:00:00Z,"HIRSCH--Shay Yandell. June 8, 1947 to February 3, 2014. A beloved mother, wife, grandmother, social worker, friend, marathon runner, skier, writer, advocate, hiker, traveler, defender of the vulnerable and cancer warrior, passed away peacefully at home, surrounded by family, on February 3rd. Shay grew up in Boise, Idaho, where she was a 1965 graduate of Boise High School. Her childhood in the American West sparked a lasting love of nature. She entered a career in social work after graduating from Whitman College in 1969, and she devoted her life to others. In 1973, she married Greg Scrivner; the couple's two sons, Ian and Sean, were born in Alaska. After living in France, Ireland, Colombia, and New Jersey, Shay returned to Boise, where she became the director of YWCA's shelter for battered women, now called the Women's and Children's Alliance. At the 1988 New Jersey Waterfront Marathon, George Hirsch, who had met Shay only the day before at a marathon expo, and who was irrevocably lovestruck, ran through the crowded field of a race for which he had not registered until he found her. They ran the remaining 21 miles together, and they married the next year. Shay relocated to New York City, but the Hirsches maintained strong ties to Idaho, and they kept a home in Sun Valley. For the past eleven years, Shay wrote eloquently of her fight against multiple myeloma, an incurable blood cancer. Through two stem cell transplants and through more recent encounters with myelodysplastic syndrome and acute myeloid leukemia, Shay faced wave after wave of indignities with dignity and grace. She ended each post about her cancer battle by saying ""Onward!"" She embraced every part of life as an adventure, even the difficult ones. The impact of Shay's life is ""incalculably diffusive,"" as George Eliot once wrote. Shay's memory will be held closely in the hearts of her husband, George A. Hirsch, the chairman of the New York Road Runners; her son Ian Scrivner and spouse Cinzia Dinoi; her son Sean Scrivner and partner Rachel Teannalach; her stepsons David and William Hirsch; her father Robert Yandell, brother Robert Yandell, and brother John Yandell and spouse Julie Yandell; her grandchildren Anjali Hirsch and Rhys Scrivner; and her nephews Christopher and Nicholas Yandell. A celebration of Shay's life will be held in March."

2014-02-07T00:00:00Z,"LOCKSLEY--Gordon, private art dealer, contemporary art collector and bon vivant, passed away quietly in Fort Lauderdale, Florida on February 1, 2014. He was 84. Mr. Locksley is remembered for his keen wit and wry sense of humor, his thoughtful generosity and devotion to friends, family and the art world. He is survived by his spouse, Wayne Boeck and long time partner George Shea. Mr. Locksley was born in Chicago, Illinois on August 27, 1930 to Sheila and William Locksley (Lukowitz). Gordon's father worked in pharmaceutical sales for Max Factor and instilled a love of fragrances and their histories in his young son. His grandparents, Isadore and Ella Lukowitz, came from Poland, emigrating before World War II and were renowned for their bakery, which provided Chicago residents with their famous onion rye bread. As a teenager, Gordon developed a love of opera, through weekly radio programs and later, a passion for Broadway musicals. Surrounded by his mother and aunts, Gordon was tutored in the art of cooking and acquired a passion for fine dining and entertaining, which lasted throughout his life. As a young man, Mr. Locksley lived briefly in Columbus, Ohio and then moved to Minneapolis, where he arrived on a bus in a snowstorm, wrapped in an opera cape.and in 1954 met Dr. George Shea, a professor of Japanese language and literature at the University of Minnesota. Together they opened the Red Carpet Beauty Salon and College, where Gordon styled hair, and where he eventually began selling art, first on the salon walls and then in a private space which came to be known as Locksley Shea Gallery, one of the leading spaces for contemporary art in Minneapolis, in the 1960s and 70s. The Locksley Shea Gallery hosted exhibitions by many of the leading names in contemporary art; Christo, Andy Warhol, Donald Judd, Brice Marden, Ellsworth Kelly and Robert Rauschenberg all came for the opening night party of their exhibitions. Legendary parties; Christo wrapped two nude models in cellophane one night, Warhol and his entourage arrived by limousine, there were outrageous costume parties with live bands, multiple bars, dancing and gogo dancers. Gordon was a partner in Sutton Place, the first gay bar in Minneapolis. He and his attorney, Elliot Kaplan, worked tirelessly with local licensing authorities and the city council to create higher visibility for gay rights and equality. In 1974, following a downturn in the art market, a historic snowstorm and a notably large piece of business, Gordon and George Shea departed Minneapolis for Rome, Cannes and Paris where they lived until 1994, when they returned to the US and settled into an A. Quincy Jones designed estate, which was featured in the movie ""Oceans Eleven,"" in Palm Springs. In 1998, Mr. Locksley met Wayne Boeck and moved to Fort Lauderdale, Florida, where they were married in November 2013. Selections from the Locksley Shea Art Collection are currently on view at the Minneapolis Art Institute. Mr. Locksley's ashes will be scattered on the mountainside above Palm Springs, California. There will be no memorial service."

2014-02-08T00:00:00Z,"HIRSCH--Shay Yandell. June 8, 1947 to February 3, 2014. A beloved mother, wife, grandmother, social worker, friend, marathon runner, skier, writer, advocate, hiker, traveler, defender of the vulnerable and cancer warrior, passed away peacefully at home, surrounded by family, on February 3rd. Shay grew up in Boise, Idaho, where she was a 1965 graduate of Boise High School. Her childhood in the American West sparked a lasting love of nature. She entered a career in social work after graduating from Whitman College in 1969, and she devoted her life to others. In 1973, she married Greg Scrivner; the couple's two sons, Ian and Sean, were born in Alaska. After living in France, Ireland, Colombia, and New Jersey, Shay returned to Boise, where she became the director of YWCA's shelter for battered women, now called the Women's and Children's Alliance. At the 1988 New Jersey Waterfront Marathon, George Hirsch, who had met Shay only the day before at a marathon expo, and who was irrevocably lovestruck, ran through the crowded field of a race for which he had not registered until he found her. They ran the remaining 21 miles together, and they married the next year. Shay relocated to New York City, but the Hirsches maintained strong ties to Idaho, and they kept a home in Sun Valley. For the past eleven years, Shay wrote eloquently of her fight against multiple myeloma, an incurable blood cancer. Through two stem cell transplants and through more recent encounters with myelodysplastic syndrome and acute myeloid leukemia, Shay faced wave after wave of indignities with dignity and grace. She ended each post about her cancer battle by saying ""Onward!"" She embraced every part of life as an adventure, even the difficult ones. The impact of Shay's life is ""incalculably diffusive,"" as George Eliot once wrote. Shay's memory will be held closely in the hearts of her husband, George A. Hirsch, the chairman of the New York Road Runners; her son Ian Scrivner and spouse Cinzia Dinoi; her son Sean Scrivner and partner Rachel Teannalach; her stepsons David and William Hirsch; her father Robert Yandell, brother Robert Yandell, and brother John Yandell and spouse Julie Yandell; her grandchildren Anjali Hirsch and Rhys Scrivner; and her nephews Christopher and Nicholas Yandell. A celebration of Shay's life will be held in March."

2014-02-09T00:00:00Z,"ZUBAY--Geoffrey Louis. Professor Geoffrey Louis Zubay, who pioneered early studies on gene expression after the discovery of the double helical structure of DNA and genetic code, died on February 5 in West Palm Beach, FL, where he and his wife resided since 2011. He was 82 years old. The cause of death was cardiac arrest. Born in Chicago November 15, 1931, Dr. Zubay had a very precocious youth and graduated from the University of Chicago with an A.B. in Philosophy at the age of seventeen. He received an M.A. in Physical Chemistry from the University of Chicago in 1952, and a Ph.D. from Harvard University in 1957. He completed three years of post-doctoral study at Kings College of the University of London, and the Rockefeller Institute in New York. Dr. Zubay then established his own lab at the Biology Department of Brookhaven National Laboratory on Long Island in 1961. Three years later Dr. Zubay was recruited to Columbia University where he remained for 41 years. During his tenure at Columbia, Dr. Zubay's lab became renowned for the development of several cell-free systems for examining the expression of genes. This was during a time of great interest in gene expression following elucidation of the structure of DNA and genetic code. In addition to a long distinguished scientific research that included more than 160 publications, Dr. Zubay wrote a widely employed textbook in Biochemistry that survived four editions. He also wrote a Genetics textbook published in 1987. In his later career, his research interests shifted to the origins of life and prebiotic chemistry. This direction led to another text Origins of Life on the Earth and in the Cosmos, for which there were two editions published by Academic Press. In the aftermath of 9/11, Dr. Zubay compiled, along with othercontributing authors Agents of Bioterrorism: Pathogens and their Weaponization published by Columbia University Press. Athletically gifted, Dr. Zubay enjoyed playing basketball with colleagues, swimming daily on the University campus, and relaxed playing poker with friends. After retirement, Dr. Zubay and his wife relocated to San Diego, CA where he served for three years as a visiting research scholar at the Scripps Institute of Oceanography in La Jolla. Dr. Zubay is survived by his wife of 47 years, Bongsoon, his son Geoffrey Pyong, Director of Neurosurgery Department at Memorial Hermann The Woodlands Hospital in Houston, TX, his daughter-in-law, Erin, and three grandchildren, Ryan, Abby, and Geoffrey Mitchell."
