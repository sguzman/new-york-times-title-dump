Some of Schley's pretended friends are evidently Sampson's enemies, and, provided they can hurt him, care nothing about the harm they may do Schley."

1898-11-08T00:00:00Z,"If ""Danny"" Maher ever again gives such an exhibition of jockeyship as he did yesterday on Kirkwood, he will lose the confidence that his brilliant work this year has won for him. Kirkwood should have won, and the fact that Hilee beat him is due solely to Maher's atrocious riding, for Kirkwood was pounds the better horse of the two."
1898-11-08T00:00:00Z,"The outburst of anger and indignation that greeted the announcement of the Rev. Daniel W.

1898-11-08T00:00:00Z,"-- If the inhabitants of Plainfield really want a curfew law, of course they ought to have one.

Post before the Institute of Architects at Washington, deploring conditions productive of certain public buildings, which must, in a sense, stand for the art of the latter half of this century, applies with equal aptness to the sister arts, and particularly that of sculpture, which, being mostly in the form of public monuments, influences public taste as directly as architecture."

ROBERTS, Director of the Mint, to put into his annual report an essay on the theoretic advantages of an international bimetallic standard to be secured by agreement between the chief financial powers.

1898-11-26T00:00:00Z,The editor of our Santiago contemporary El Porvenir is quite unnecessarily alarmed about the danger that we may colonize Cuba with negroes from the Southern States.

(Lycidas, l., 21,) therefore it is allowable to say that the muse of Medford, inspired by the legends of Maine, has given to the world the legend of Moosehead.

1898-11-30T00:00:00Z,"The French Chamber of Deputies is in a wonderful condition. The disclosures of the session of Monday would be difficult to parallel from the records of any legislative body this side of the Rums Parliament. The avowal of MM. POINCARE and BARTHOU that when DREYFUS was convicted, under the Ministry of which they were members, the only evidence against him was the bordereau should have sufficed of itself to secure a new trial."

1898-11-30T00:00:00Z,Perhaps the most singular report that has ever been submitted to the Corporation will be discussed at the next meeting of that body. It seems that there are many properties in the city which have not been assessed for the consolidated -- or sewers -- rate for several years past. The most peculiar feature of the discovery is that it has been more or less accidental.

1898-11-30T00:00:00Z,"Not quite like Robinson Crusoe, but with a tale that smacked of the old-fashioned stories of shipwreck and quaint experiences in foreign lands, the Captain and crew of the Bath schooner Talofa reached here yesterday on the Ward Line steamship City of Washington, from Progreso, Mexico. The Talofa is a four-masted schooner of the Sewall fleet."

Did those the Saviour preached to 1900 years ago prove less exacting than the churchgoer of the present day? Was the task less arduous -- say, rather, more exacting?

Time moves somewhere that magic night, call it forward or backward, and the war reminiscences seem out of date, expansionist articles mere idle theories, and accounts of the colonies only the visions of dreamers.

1898-12-24T00:00:00Z,The complete acephalousness of the present minority of Congress has been illustrated and exhibited every day since the session began.

That is the bait that has been causing more people to perpetuate themselves upon paper than any bargain that has been offered in New York for a long time, and it is probable that more people had 1-cent Christmas presents this year than knew that they had."
1899-01-01T00:00:00Z,"From a high ridge in Berkshire there is occasionally to be heard the sound of the firing of guns at Aldershot, thirty miles to the eastward. These guns are chiefly noticed in the Summer time, when there is very rarely an east wind to help the sound.

1899-01-01T00:00:00Z,"A history of the various protective tariffs of the United States indicates that at times they have been instituted for the purpose of raising the revenue, and at others with a view to reducing same. This series of explanations certainly covered many possibilities, but, with all its elasticity, it is not sufficient to cover a contingency which has risen and to which, strange to say, no one has yet called attention."
1899-01-01T00:00:00Z,Among the first of the heroes of the recent war with Spain was the late Ensign Worth Bagley. It was his privilege to be the first of all to give his life to the cause which brought about the freedom of an enslaved people.

The best previous record was in 1890, when 469,607 cases were shipped. March, April, and September were the banner months. June and October were the poorest. The big strike was on in the latter month, which accounts for the slump."
1899-01-01T00:00:00Z,"In yesterday's Illustrated Magazine a writer of one of the ""Without Prejudice"" paragraphs falls into a curious error in attributing the origin of the word canard to M. Cornelissen ten years ago. In Balzac's ""A Distinguished Provincial at Paris"" occurs the following:"

1899-01-01T00:00:00Z,"CHRISTMAS seems to have been more generally and joyously observed in New York this year than for several years previously. This was probably owing to the fact that the war had ceased and peace was assured to this country, and everything betokened future prosperity."
1899-01-01T00:00:00Z,"Where do you get your seamanship? I constantly wonder at it, for it is good. It reads with the genuine professional twang.

Who was ever more courteous and considerate and (despite Mrs. Bardell and the lady in yellow curl papers) more blameless in his relations with women?

1899-01-07T00:00:00Z,Mr. Emil Paur and his symphony orchestra gave their third public rehearsal yesterday afternoon at Carnegie Hall.

1899-01-07T00:00:00Z,"As for Walpole's admiration of Mme. de Sevigne, it passes almost at once into a heroine worship.

1899-01-07T00:00:00Z,"The book collector's lot is not always a happy one. He is one of the most misunderstood of mortals. Among his intimates and acquaintances he finds few kindred souls to appreciate his passion for volumes that are precious because of their rarity, beauty, or associations.

Our inn is kept by a Greek, from Corfu, as his name, Corfiotti, tells us, and as the loquacity of his wife would lead us to infer -- for at Cargese the Corsican taciturnity has given place to the Hellenic love of talk."
1899-01-07T00:00:00Z,"In THE TIMES of Dec. 26 there was a article copied from The Picayune about the powerful tug R.W. Wilmot.

1899-01-07T00:00:00Z,"The Grand Army desires that more attention be given to the teaching of patriotism in our public schools. This is all very good.

1899-01-28T00:00:00Z,"Mr. Eliot Gregory has usually such a delightful way of embedding wisdom in an amberlike envelope of bright humor that his paper on ""Down-Town Architecture"" may be taken by his numerous admirers more seriously than perhaps he intended. If one regards it simply as a jeu d'esprit it is all very pleasant, but as a real contribution to the literature of the sky-scraper it has no value."
1899-01-28T00:00:00Z,"An amendment to the Agricultural Department Appropriation bill is pending in the Senate which we think should be adopted in the general interest.

1899-01-28T00:00:00Z,"The regular Friday prayer meeting in Plymouth Church last night resolved itself into something like a mass meeting to eulogize Dr. Lyman Abbott.

1899-01-28T00:00:00Z,"Poetry, no one will question, is far more easily memorized than prose. Whether invented as a species of mnemonics, or already existing in some form, it is easy to see why it would be adopted as the language of early philosophy and religion. Not only would it have the capacity to give a far wider oral publication, but it had something of the character of a record."
1899-01-28T00:00:00Z,"The decision of the Spanish Cabinet to try Admiral MONTOJO for the unprepared condition in which Commodore DEWEY found his squadron may be necessary as a sop to Spanish pride, which requires some very curious sops.

Watson dwells, whenever the occasion presents itself, with much elaboration of detail, on the inhumanity of man to man.

1899-01-28T00:00:00Z,"Canon MacColl having been the authority for a story fastened on Gladstone, the conclusion of which was that the Premier, disgusted with an art criticism by Disraeli, said to Browning: ""I consider that devilish.''

1899-02-11T00:00:00Z,"It is now many years since Mr. Stopford Brooke brought out his ""Primer of English Literature."" But, although several short histories of the same subject by highly qualified men have followed the ""Primer,"" Mr. Brooke's little volume has not been superseded in the public esteem.

1899-02-11T00:00:00Z,"There is something pathetic in Mr. Alfred Ollivant's life story, whose romance of the collie in ""Bob Son of Battle"" is a most attractive book. Mr. Ollivant had chosen a military career when, owing to a fall from a horse, he had to abandon army service. Of all the dogs which render man's life happier it is the collie that is the grand consoler. You never can treat a collie with indignity."

The delay is due to the fact that W.G. Byrne cannot find one certificate representing 61 shares of stock, part of 311 shares, for which F.A. Abell has agreed to pay $10,000."

1899-02-11T00:00:00Z,"Will correspondents come down upon the present writer as they have come down upon Mr. Alden, if we say that Susan Edmonstone Ferrier is barely more than a name in literature to-day?

Mr. Landor, having expressed a desire to read a paper on his recent travels before the society, this offer was declined, whether with or without ""thanks"" is not stated.

1899-02-11T00:00:00Z,"This is a book with uncut pages. That does not sound like a fact of any importance or interest. The reason why the reviewer mentions it is this: The first ninety pages were cut. From this fact the reviewer shrewdly suspects that the hook was first given some one else to review, and that that person, after reading ninety pages, gave it up in despair."
1899-02-11T00:00:00Z,"The need of ""bread"" is a common and universal need. The term itself is a term which covers all kinds of food -- for body, mind, and spirit. In this sense everything living, whether it be vegetable or animal, has a natural and an irresistible craving for it, and if that craving is not soon satisfied it dies. The grass, the brute, and the man, in this respect, stand side by side."

1899-02-11T00:00:00Z,"That was a very tart anathema, Mr. Editor, which your correspondent, ""K.,"" in your SATURDAY REVIEW of Feb. 4, proclaimed over those who dare object to the creations from Mr. Kipling's pen.

Stanley has written a preface, tells us of a nomad race, living to the west of the Albert Nyanza."

1899-02-11T00:00:00Z,"There are elements of romance to be found in pork butchers, scissors grinders, makers of books, or journalists. The interest in such characters depends on the skill in handling them. In later days Thackeray's ""Pendennis"" showed how the literary man could be amusingly exploited, and he was a personage Balzac in his ""Comedie Humaine"" dwelt on."

1899-02-14T00:00:00Z,"While we think that there is not very much probability of an extra session, because we can see no political advantage to be gained from it by the party in power, and because it seems to us only too practicable for the Administration to avoid it, if it really wishes to do so, yet we note with extreme pleasure one of the arguments used by Republicans to dissuade Democrats from forcing it."

1899-02-14T00:00:00Z,That two such explorers as NANSEN and NORDENSKJOLD should have combined to discredit the story that comes from Siberia of the finding of the remains of ANDREE and his party is of course pertinent.

Mr. WHITELAW REID, one of our Peace Commissioners at Paris, said publicly in this city last week that they were ""treacherously murdered.""

It indicates a benevolent desire to relieve suffering, for which we venture to point out another mode of gratification.

1899-03-19T00:00:00Z,"THE heart surcharged with sorrow must have an outlet provided for it; otherwise the dark flood will burst its barriers and overwhelm the soul in ruin.

He consults this doctor and that doctor. He indulges in all kinds of absurd athletic exercises. He tries first one climate and then another. He tries the rest cure and the work cure. He grows steadily worse."

1899-03-26T00:00:00Z,"Of all the wonderful performances of Gen. ALGER none has been so wonderful, in the way of impudence, as the scheme he is reported to have now under consideration.

1899-03-26T00:00:00Z,"Fair Euphrosyne has had very little to do with the manufacture of the new show at the Casino. Not much of it is any funnier than a dress parade of a National Guard regiment.

The Forty-first Street Presbyterian Church, Chicago, received into its membership above 1,000 persons during the four-year pastorate of the Rev. Dr. Howard Agnew Johnston, more than 300 of these on confession of faith."
1899-03-26T00:00:00Z,"I notice that many theories are advanced with reference to the probable cause of the rapid progress of the fire in the Windsor Hotel. None of them seems to give any reasonable explanation of the fire's appearing in so many parts of the hotel almost immediately after it was first discovered, except the statement published to-day of Charles W. Squires, the cashier of the hotel."

The combination's purposes have undoubtedly a considerable effect on the trading generally, but in addition to this there is a better business to be found in regular channels. Business is still rather slow, though some good-sized orders have been booked."
1899-03-27T00:00:00Z,"ALBANY, March 26. -- The events of the coming week in the Legislature will be important enough in themselves, but they will be the more interesting because of the effect which the visit of Senator Platt is expected to exert on them.

Butler Thompkins in your issue of the 25th inst., in reference to the lynchings in Georgia, would not be accepted by practical, well-informed Americans as a fair, unbiased statement of facts, but rather as palpably a one-sided and extravagant expression with, in the main, only a shadow of truth for a foundation."
