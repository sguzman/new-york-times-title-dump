2016-01-26T00:00:00Z,"KENNEDY--Michael John, on January 25, 2016 at age 78 of cancer. Civil rights lawyer who fought for the First, Fourth, Fifth and Sixth Amendments. Mr. Kennedy, whose career as both a civil liberties and criminal attorney began in California in the 1960s, successfully defended Black Panther Huey Newton on manslaughter and murder charges in Oakland. In San Francisco, he won acquittal for all seven young Mexican Americans, Los Siete de la Raza, charged with murdering a police officer in the city's Mission District. And when Jimmy Mitchell, co-owner of San Francisco's notorious O'Farrell Theatre-which journalist Hunter S. Thompson called 'The Carnegie Hall of Public Sex'-was accused of killing his brother Artie in a drunken rage, Mr. Kennedy succeeded in having the charge reduced from murder in the second degree to manslaughter. In Illinois he represented Rennie Davis, a member of the Chicago Eight accused of conspiracy and inciting a riot during the 1968 Democratic National Convention and served as Mr. Davis's lawyer before the House Un-American Activities Committee in Washington, D.C. He also represented Bernardine Dohrn who belonged to 1960s radical group, The Weathermen. Other of his clients belonged to the Brotherhood of Eternal Love, the most famous member of which was Timothy Leary, LSD guru to a generation. In Lincoln, Nebraska, Mr. Kennedy won acquittal for a Penobscot Native American charged with assaulting FBI agents at Wounded Knee. Perhaps his most famous trial and certainly the most time consuming-it still remains the longest criminal jury trial in U.S. Federal Court history-was The Pizza Connection; the name came from accusations of drug money laundering through pizza parlors in New York City. When the U.S. Attorney put two warring mafia families on trial, the case played out like a drama between the Capulets and the Montagues with Mr. Kennedy retained as chief council representing one of the godfathers, Sicilian mob boss Gaetano Badalamenti. Wire taps were the basis for charges against six Americans raising money in New York to buy weapons for the IRA in Ireland. As lead council, Mr. Kennedy won an acquittal for all six men. He also won clemency from New York Governor Mario Cuomo for Jean Harris, the private girls' school headmistress who was in prison for the notorious murder of her lover, Scarsdale Diet doctor Herman Tarnower. Mr. Kennedy worked on only one divorce case in his career and although the settlement was sealed, reliable sources reported that Ivana Trump was very pleased. There were many pro-bono cases about which no one has written. And there were many times when people from all walks of life, the high, the low, and the undocumented, sought Kennedy's advice privately and many times he privately reached out to connections, sometimes in the government, sometimes in the underworld. As general council to High Times Magazine for 41 years, Mr. Kennedy and his friend, the magazine's founder, the late Tom Forcade, sought to subvert prohibition of marijuana. When a reporter recently asked Mr. Kennedy how he kept High Times out of trouble for so long, he replied simply that he had never asked or allowed them to do anything illegal but added: ""At High Times we will never forget what was done in the name of law enforcement to our scarred arrestees, and those who still rot in prison for daring to try to enjoy themselves peacefully and harmlessly."" Mr. Kennedy was the consummate gentleman, with a quick Irish wit and a quick Irish temper. But he very rarely raised his voice, being the personification of Theodore Roosevelt's foreign policy: Speak softly but carry a big stick. The romance between Michael Kennedy and Eleanora, his wife of forty-seven years, is the stuff of fairy tales. Marrying after love at first sight, they never spent a night apart and sometimes signed their names as one word. Although not an attorney, Mrs. Kennedy was her husband's most trusted associate and confidant working entirely behind the scenes on every case, becoming an unofficial voir dire expert. The couple eschewed the label 'socialite' but could be seen often at benefits for Memorial Sloan Kettering Hospital, the Central Park Conservancy and the United Nations. They gave as many parties as they attended, a number of which were chronicled in New York Magazine and the New York Social Diary. When not working or traveling, Mr. Kennedy spent his time between New York City, his Hamptons home Kilkare, his old Key West cottage in West Palm Beach and his house in Ireland's Black Valley. Michael John Kennedy, who died at Memorial Sloan Kettering Hospital, was born in the state of Washington in 1937. After boarding school in Washington, he attended University of California at Berkeley and Hastings Law School. Besides his wife Eleanora, he leaves his daughters Anna Safir and Lisa Kennedy, his son Scott Hamilton Kennedy, three granddaughters and two grandsons. Friends may call at Frank E. Campbell, 1076 Madison Avenue at 81st Street on Wednesday from 2-4 and 6-8pm. The funeral service will be held on Thursday at 10am at the Church of St. Paul the Apostle, 60th Street and Columbus Avenue. 1/3"

2016-01-27T00:00:00Z,"KENNEDY--Michael John. On January 25, 2016 at age 78 of cancer. Civil rights lawyer who fought for the First, Fourth, Fifth and Sixth Amendments. Mr. Kennedy, whose career as both a civil liberties and criminal attorney began in California in the 1960s and culminated in 2009 as Special Advisor to the President of the United Nations, Miguel D'Escoto. He successfully defended Black Panther Huey Newton on manslaughter and murder charges in Oakland. In San Francisco, he won acquittal for all seven young Mexican Americans, Los Siete de la Raza, charged with murdering a police officer in the city's Mission District. And when Jimmy Mitchell, co- owner of San Francisco's notorious O'Farrell Theatre- which journalist Hunter S. Thompson called 'The Carnegie Hall of Public Sex'-was accused of killing his brother Artie in a drunken rage, Mr. Kennedy succeeded in having the charge reduced from murder in the second degree to manslaughter. In Illinois he represented Rennie Davis, a member of the Chicago Eight accused of conspiracy and inciting a riot during the 1968 Democratic National Convention and served as Mr. Davis's lawyer before the House Un-American Activities Committee in Washington, D.C. He also represented Bernardine Dohrn who belonged to 1960s radical group, The Weathermen. Other of his clients belonged to the Brotherhood of Eternal Love, the most famous member of which was Timothy Leary, LSD guru to a generation. In Lincoln, Nebraska, Mr. Kennedy won acquittal for a Penobscot Native American charged with assaulting FBI agents at Wounded Knee. Perhaps his most famous trial and certainly the most time consuming-it still remains the longest criminal jury trial in U.S. Federal Court history-was The Pizza Connection; the name came from accusations of drug money laundering through pizza parlors in New York City. When the U.S. Attorney put two warring mafia families on trial, the case played out like a drama between the Capulets and the Montagues with Mr. Kennedy retained as chief council representing one of the godfathers, Sicilian mob boss Gaetano Badalamenti. Wire taps were the basis for charges against six Americans raising money in New York to buy weapons for the IRA in Ireland. As lead council, Mr. Kennedy won an acquittal for all six men. He also won clemency from New York Governor Mario Cuomo for Jean Harris, the private girls' school headmistress who was in prison for the notorious murder of her lover, Scarsdale Diet doctor Herman Tarnower. Mr. Kennedy worked on only one divorce case in his career and although the settlement was sealed, reliable sources reported that Ivana Trump was very pleased. There were many pro-bono cases about which no one has written. And there were many times when people from all walks of life, the high, the low, and the undocumented, sought Kennedy's advice privately and many times he privately reached out to connections, sometimes in the government, sometimes in the underworld. As general council to High Times Magazine for 41 years, Mr. Kennedy and his friend, the magazine's founder, the late Tom Forcade, sought to subvert prohibition of marijuana. When a reporter recently asked Mr. Kennedy how he kept High Times out of trouble for so long, he replied simply that he had never asked or allowed them to do anything illegal but added: ""At High Times we will never forget what was done in the name of law enforcement to our scarred arrestees, and those who still rot in prison for daring to try to enjoy themselves peacefully and harmlessly."" Mr. Kennedy was the consummate gentleman, with a quick Irish wit and a quick Irish temper. But he very rarely raised his voice, being the personification of Theodore Roosevelt's foreign policy: Speak softly but carry a big stick. The romance between Michael Kennedy and Eleanora, his wife of forty-seven years, is the stuff of fairy tales. Marrying after love at first sight, they never spent a night apart and sometimes signed their names as one word. Although not an attorney, Mrs. Kennedy was her husband's most trusted associate and confidant working entirely behind the scenes on every case, becoming an unofficial voir dire expert. The couple eschewed the label 'socialite' but could be seen often at benefits for Memorial Sloan Kettering Hospital, the Central Park Conservancy and the United Nations. They gave as many parties as they attended, a number of which were chronicled in New York Magazine and the New York Social Diary. When not working or traveling, Mr. Kennedy spent his time between New York City, his Hamptons home Kilkare, his old Key West cottage in West Palm Beach and his house in Ireland's Black Valley. Michael John Kennedy, who died at Memorial Sloan Kettering Hospital, was born in the state of Washington in 1937. After boarding school in Washington, he attended University of California at Berkeley and Hastings Law School. Besides his wife Eleanora, he leaves his daughters Anna Safir and Lisa Kennedy, his son Scott Hamilton Kennedy, three granddaughters and two grandsons. Friends may call at Frank E. Campbell, 1076 Madison Avenue at 81st Street on Wednesday from 2-4 and 6-8pm.

2016-01-27T00:00:00Z,"DRAZEN--Ruth Yorkin. We mourn the loss of Ruth Yorkin Drazen-mother, filmmaker and pioneer in genetics-who died quietly in her sleep on Monday evening at the age of 97. Ruth was born in Washington, PA on May 15, 1918, the daughter of Jesse Sachs Yorkin and Maurice A. Yorkin. Ruth adored classical music from early childhood on, studying piano at the Curtis School of Music with Henry Kaufman. In 1938 she married fellow Curtis student, Mario Berini, and they moved to New York City, where Mario began his career as a tenor with the Met. Their only child, Anton, died in infancy of a rare genetic disease, and Ruth's grief sparked her interest in curing genetic illnesses. She spent years working tirelessly as executive director of The Muscular Dystrophy Association and The National Genetics Foundation. When her second husband, New York attorney Jerome Drazen, died of prostate cancer in 1988, she developed an abiding passion for the subject of humanism in medicine, expressing it through the making of documentary films, which she continued to create into her early nineties. Her first film, ""When Doctors Get Cancer,"" was a sensitive look at doctors treating other doctors, in the hope that it might make more humane the care that physicians gave, when they were able to observe themselves as cancer patients. Five other award-winning films followed, most of them shown on PBS. They included, ""The Choice is Yours,"" the inspirational life of the great psychiatrist, Victor Frankl, ""A Wayfayer's Journey; Listening to Mahler;"" ""Notes From the Edge, the Diary of Peter J. Morgan, M.D.,"" an intimate narrative of the last two years of the life of a 29-year old physician diagnosed with cancer, and ""Healing Through Humanism,"" a five DVD teaching series devoted to the practice of compassionate medicine. Ruth was an intellectual and spiritual inspiration to everyone she touched, and will be sorely missed. Ruth is survived by a son, Myron Drazen and daughter-in-law, Lucille; a sister, Martha Yorkin Berman; two step-sons, Michael and Roger Drazen and seven grandchildren, Julie, Debra, Jacob, Dylan, Emily, Kate and Zoe Drazen. She was predeceased by a son, Anton Berini, as well as brother Alan ""Bud"" Yorkin; husbands Mario Berini and Jerome Drazen.

George was born on April 23, 1917 in Brooklyn, New York, and attended both City College and Pratt Institute. George was an accomplished businessman, Chairman and CEO of National Die and Button Mould Company. He loved sports, including fishing, golfing, skiing and horse racing. And was a great comrade among his peers. He practiced hatha yoga, deep breathing and exercised throughout his life. He also enjoyed collecting art and adding to his collection-and loaned selected pieces to museums. He had a sense of humor and outstanding charm with elegance and wit. Everyone loved him-children, adults, friends and peers. His writings and his conversations were always enlightening to hear. He was a World War II veteran and fought in battles and campaigns, including Ardennes, Central Europe, Rhineland, Normandy, Northern France, and Belgium. Throughout his life he belonged to many clubs, including the Seawane Country Club and the Lone Star Boat Club. He was a religious man and a member of Central Synagogue. For over 70 years he designed and manufactured varieties of metal stampings-nailheads, studs, rhinestones and settings, metal and covered buttons, buckles, and other metal works. His customers included leaders in the fashion industry, automotive, aviation, and the United States Military. He loved people and could converse with anyone on any level-he would always light up a room. His time in World War II as a French interpreter and radar specialist in the anti-aircraft division, and his participation in the Battle of the Bulge and the invasion of Normandy left him with many great stories that he loved to share.

2016-01-28T00:00:00Z,"REICH--Dr. Robert (Bob), a psychiatrist who treated patients in his Upper East Side and Great Neck practices and a clinical assistant professor at Mt. Sinai Medical School, died on Monday at 79. Born in Montreal, he attended McGill University, edited The McGill Daily, and earned his M.D. at the University of Saskatchewan, where he met Mary, his wife of 54 years. As head of Psychiatry for the New York City Welfare Department under Mayor Koch, he waged a prescient fight against the impending homeless crisis. His patients ranged from celebrities to the indigent, and he was deeply committed to each one as an individual. A broad smile and a winning sense of humor told you instantly that you were in the presence of someone who would sympathetically take the full measure of your being. His stamina was superhuman; he worked long hours and still made himself available round the clock until the day he entered the hospital. His involvement was uncommonly broad, running from child to geriatric, from drugs and talk therapy, to being a pioneer in public psychiatry. Lover of hootenannies, Leadbelly, and opera; gourmet and wine connoisseur; tennis player and fan; magnanimous host and storyteller, Dr. Reich is survived by Mary, two children, Jim and Sharon, and three grandchildren.

2016-01-28T00:00:00Z,"HUDNER--Hope Freeman. Artist, Designer, Mother and Friend. Hope F. Hudner died at home in Little Compton, RI on January 14, 2016 following a thirteen month battle with glioblastoma multiforme, a form of brain cancer. Hope is survived by her husband of 40 years, Michael, and her daughter, Bay, who were deeply involved as caregivers and comforters during the past year, and were at her side at the time of her peaceful passing. Hope is also survived by her aunt, Judy Freeman N. Gross; brothers, Ambassador Charles ""Chas"" W. Freeman, Jr. (Margaret Carpenter) and Robert P. Freeman (Inge Reist); their five children and nine grandchildren (Hope's grand-nieces and -nephews); siblings-in-law, Mr. Kennedy Hudner (Jennifer), Ms. Cornelia Futterman (Michael), and Ms. Kristina Beitman (Harty), and their five children. Hope was born on January 11, 1951 in Nassau, The Bahamas, and lived there until age 10, then alternating time in Southern California with years in Providence and Bristol, RI. Hope was predeceased by her son, Michael Ripley (""Rip"") Hudner, and her parents (father, Charles Wellman Freeman, and mother, Carla Park Freeman, who died when Hope was 20 months old). Hope was largely raised by her two sets of deceased grandparents, Hovey T. and Marjorie W. Freeman of Providence and Bristol, and George C. and Fentress K. Park of Wollaston, MA and Roaring Brook, MI. Hope graduated from The Lincoln School, Providence (1969), Smith College (1973), and also acquired an MFA from New York University. The family lived in New York City from 1974 through 1994, and then resided in Little Compton and Providence, RI. Hope was an accomplished artist and designer with a portfolio including work in graphic, interior, jewelry, and apparel design. These efforts led to her 2013 creation of Hope Hudner Designs, focused on elegant silk infinity scarves. Hope was deeply involved in Rhode Island public service, including, at various times, board and/or development responsibilities at Moses Brown School, Women & Infants Hospital, Rhode Islanders Sponsoring Education (RISE), RISD Museum, Perennial Planters, The National Society of the Colonial Dames of America (Rhode Island), and Providence Preservation Society. Hope's social involvements included membership in the Providence Art Club, Colony Club of New York City, Lyford Cay Club, Sakonnet Golf Club, and Sakonnet Point Club. Hope had great admiration for the natural world and actively cultivated a sense of wonder: she was a faithful student of plants and flowers (as evidenced by the thousands of bulbs planted across Rhode Island, Maine, and New York); she loved sailing with her family and friends (countless excursions on Narragansett Bay and longer trips to Maine, Nova Scotia, Newfoundland, and Ireland number among the most special); and her keen curiosity led her to explore the far corners of the world, from Spain and Taiwan at age 18 to Antarctica at 49, covering every other continent and many countries in between. Hope had enormous energy, deep intelligence, natural grace, and remarkable warmth. She believed that life presented endless opportunity to learn, remarking on the tenth anniversary of her son's death that, ""Each time it rains in our lives, we are given an opportunity for further growth. I am grateful for the challenges in my life as chances to grow and blossom."" Hope faced her illness with the same fortitude and poise. While she was indeed a lifelong learner, Hope was perhaps most notable as a teacher of these invaluable lessons to the rest of us. Hope felt a profound duty to embrace everyone she encountered with love and kindness, and she shared this love of people and life like water from a fire hose. All within range were enriched by her presence and generosity of spirit. Hope inspired people to think lovingly and boldly on behalf of the larger community, themselves, and their friends, prompting many to find more inside themselves to enhance their own lives and those of others. A college classmate of Bay's said it beautifully in a recent note to Hope: ""You feature prominently as an inspiration for the life I want to live-to pursue my interests, to live fully and with panache, to spend time in nature, and, most of all, to be kind to people. I know I am just one of the many, many people you affect in this way!"" A celebration of Hope's life will be held in Little Compton in early June on a date to be announced. In lieu of flowers, the family suggests contributions in Hope's memory be made to: the Rip Hudner Memorial Fund at Moses Brown School, Providence; Dr. Patrick Wen's Research in Neuro-Oncology at Dana Faber Cancer Institute, Boston; or a charity of your choice. Above all, the family encourages you to remember Hope by engaging with the world through love and kindness. 1/3"

2016-01-29T00:00:00Z,"SLOAN--Howard, WWII bomber pilot, former Chairman of New York Blood Center, died at 91. From a base in East Anglia during World War II, 19 year old Howard Sloan flew 33 missions over Germany. His B-24 was named ""The Stork Club."" When praised for his bravery, he would invariably respond: ""Was there a choice?"" Cheers erupted from a crowd on the beach when, piloting his plane home to the states after the war, he dipped his wings over the Inwood Country Club. Mr. Sloan was born in New York City on March 20, 1924. He graduated from the Woodmere Academy and Pawling Preparatory School, and received a Bachelor of Arts degree from Yale University, Class of '45W. He and his late wife, Sonny, along with George and Barbara Bush, were the only two married couples on campus. Dreams of business school were dashed by financial necessity and he joined his father's insurance company, Harris, Sloan and Finn. Characteristically, he turned the experience into a colorful one, representing clients such as Restaurant Associates; Richard Burton, who dispatched him to Rome to deliver a diamond he'd bought at auction for Elizabeth Taylor, or Cartier to present a love bracelet to Valentino, who insisted Howard personally fasten it on his wrist. He became an art insurer, developing great interest and knowledge of art in the process, befriending numerous artists and inspiring a lifetime of collecting: Mayan and PreColumbian sculpture, works by artists as diverse as Giacometti and Bill King, Henry Moore and Lindner. He acquired an art gallery, Multiples, for his wife, Sonny, and Marian Goodman to run. In 1990, he was invited by his friend and mentor, Charles Wohlstetter, to become a partner in the latter's acquisitions of hundreds of independent telephone companies from Alaska to California. They formed Continental Telephone, later known as Contel, in 1962. The company then agreed to be acquired by GTE, a combination that created the nation's largest local telephone company. Sloan remained on the Board of GTE until it was restructured as Verizon. In 1968, an American syndicate acquired an 18th century chateau in Bordeaux with Wohlstetter and Sloan installed as new owners. Chateau Bouscaut was the second most beautiful vineyard in Bordeaux, Sloan proclaimed, second, he said, because he didn't want to boast. Among the many American guests who flocked to visit, his favorite was Mary Lindsay, whom he overheard saying to her husband, then mayor of NYC, ""John, if I have to see one more vineyard, I'll kill myself."" To Sloan's eternal regret, Bouscat was sold in 1980. Mayor Lindsay brought Sloan onto the board of the Vivian Beaumont Theatre in 1984. At that time, according to Andre Bishop, current artistic director, ""Nobody would give you a nickel for the Beaumont."" It is now one of the leading theatrical companies in New York, if not the world. Mr. Sloan served on the Board until his death on Thursday. In 1977, Sloan joined the Board of Trustees of the New York Blood Center, of which he was Chairman from 1993 to 2000, nominating his successor, Howard Milstein. In January 2013, a congressional extension prepared by Representative Carolyn Maloney in recognition of Mr. Sloan's 15 years of distinguished service and dedication to NYBC's mission, was entered into the congressional record. She cited his humanitarian status and commended his leadership and tireless advocacy. For several years, he presided as Chairman of Northside Center for Child Development, founded by Kenneth and Mamie Clarke, earning a colleague's recent comment, ""There was a time this place wouldn't have existed without Howard Sloan."" He and his wife are to be honored for their dedication to Northside at a gala in May 2017. Howard Sloan died of kidney failure in Columbia-Presbyterian Hospital on January 21, 2016. Handsome as a film star, he will be remembered for his elegance and extraordinary wit. He is survived by his wife, Barbara; two daughters, Kathryn Roth of Weston, Massachusetts, Gillis Cone of Woodbury, Connecticut; a son, Douglas Sloan, of Palm Beach; a stepdaughter, Paulette Bartlett Robinson, of Los Angeles, and four grandchildren. Interment will be private and a memorial service will take place at Frank E. Campbell Funeral Home on Wednesday, February 10th. 1/3"

2016-01-29T00:00:00Z,"KIBEL--Henry. After 96 years of laughing, loving, shouting, learning, teaching, and building, Henry, the beloved patriarch of the Kibel family, passed away peacefully Wednesday night surrounded by family and friends. Henry created a wonderful life for his family and for the many others who benefited from his generosity. He graduated from Stuyvesant High School, William & Mary College and Yale University School of Architecture. He was a naval officer in the South Pacific during World War II. Henry was an architect, a builder and an artist. He built thousands of apartments in New York City. Every part of the development process carried his imprint. Henry was a master of making things-creating gave him joy. Whether he was building an apartment tower or creating illustrations that accompany the recipes of the renowned chef Andre Soltner's cookbook, Henry's passion never stopped. In addition to the building legacy he created, Henry was, in his own words, the inventor of important things: the 12"" kitchen cabinet and innovative real estate advertising- including the successful campaign for 85 John Street, 'featuring lousy views and flushing toilets.' The fancy suspender companies will sorely miss Henry, who supported their industry and whose industry supported his pants. Although he oversalted everything, he managed to live to 96. On second thought, his memory was not so great for the last 10 years, so maybe the salt was not so good. Henry is survived by his sister, three children, eight grandchildren, and many nephews and nieces. The funeral will be held on Friday, January 29 at 11:30am at Frank Campbell Funeral Chapel, 1076 Madison Avenue. We will sorely miss him. The Kibel and Levenson Families 1/3"

2016-01-30T00:00:00Z,"SMITH--Howard. NYU Lutheran's board and staff are deeply saddened by the passing of chair emeritus Howard Smith. As chairman of Lutheran Medical Center and Augustana Center from 1966 until 2004, Smith, who died Thursday at age 85, left an indelible legacy on southwest Brooklyn. With his friend New York City Mayor John Lindsay and the American Lutheran Church, Mr. Smith brokered the 1977 expansion and relocation of Lutheran Medical Center from 4th Avenue and 46th Street to its present location, a former warehouse at 55th Street and 2nd Avenue in Sunset Park. He facilitated the creation of the Sunset Park Family Health Center, now called NYU Lutheran Family Health Centers, the second largest federally qualified health center network in the nation. He created a lasting financial foundation for Lutheran through Health Plus, an innovative government-sponsored insurance program for low-income residents. Lutheran's sale of Health Plus to Amerigroup in 2011 created an endowment that continues to help modernize the health system. Mr. Smith, a lifelong Brooklyn resident, was chairman emeritus of the United Hospital Fund, former president of the Brooklyn Public Library Board of Trustees, and past vice president and director of the Brooklyn Chamber of Commerce. Mr. Smith received a bachelor's in chemical engineering from Princeton University and served in the U.S. Army. He served 40 years as president of Virginia Dare Extract Company, which was founded by his grandfather Bernard, and was a former director of Dime Savings Bank of New York before it merged with Washington Mutual in 2002. He is predeceased by his wife, Elsie, and survived by his three children, Howard Jr., Jean, and Lilla, and grandchildren. NYU Lutheran mourns as we celebrate Mr. Smith's life and legacy. A wake will be held at Clavin Funeral Home, 7722 4th Ave., Brooklyn, on Tuesday, February 2, at 4-8pm. Services will be held at the Lutheran Church of the Good Shepherd, 7420 4th Ave., Brooklyn, on Wednesday, February 3, at 10 am. 1/3"

After 96 years of laughing, loving, shouting, learning, teaching, and building, Henry, the beloved patriarch of the Kibel family, passed away peacefully Wednesday night surrounded by family and friends. Henry created a wonderful life for his family and for the many others who benefited from his generosity. He graduated from Stuyvesant High School, William & Mary College and Yale University School of Architecture. He was a naval officer in the South Pacific during World War II. Henry was an architect, a builder and an artist. He built thousands of apartments in New York City. Every part of the development process carried his imprint. Henry was a master of making things-creating gave him joy. Whether he was building an apartment tower or creating illustrations that accompany the recipes of the renowned chef Andre Soltner's cookbook, Henry's passion never stopped. In addition to the building legacy he created, Henry was, in his own words, the inventor of important things: the 12"" kitchen cabinet and innovative real estate advertising- including the successful campaign for 85 John Street, 'featuring lousy views and flushing toilets.' The fancy suspender companies will sorely miss Henry, who supported their industry and whose industry supported his pants. Although he oversalted everything, he managed to live to 96. On second thought, his memory was not so great for the last 10 years, so maybe the salt was not so good. Henry is survived by his sister, three children, eight grandchildren, and many nephews and nieces. The funeral will be held on Friday, January 29 at 11:30am at Frank Campbell Funeral Chapel, 1076 Madison Avenue. We will sorely miss him. The Kibel and Levenson Families 1/3"

2016-01-31T00:00:00Z,"GROSS--Martin L. Martin L. Gross of New London, NH and Ocean Ridge, FL died on Tuesday, January 26, 2016 in Ushuaia, Argentina following a stroke suffered en route to Antarctica. He was 77 years old. Martin's adventures began in New York City where he was born on October 22, 1938. As a young child, Martin and his older brother, Woolf, were dispatched to summer camps and later to working cattle ranches in Utah during the summer months to escape the polio outbreaks that plagued New York City in the years following World War II. After high school, Martin headed north to Cambridge, MA where he attended both Harvard College and Harvard Law School, graduating from the latter in 1964. Before embarking on his first job as a law clerk in New Hampshire, Martin and his first wife, the late Caroline Lord Gross, purchased a Volkswagen pop-up camper and drove to Alaska with Martin's mother, Harriet. Harriet slept in the camper; Martin and Caroline slept outdoors in a tent. After several weeks of abysmal weather the camper was coated with a thick layer of adobe-colored mud. When the trio returned to Concord and washed the car for the first time, it was in pristine condition. Thereafter, Martin never worried much if his car was dirty. Following his clerkship, Martin joined the Concord, New Hampshire law firm of Sulloway & Hollis, P.L.L.C. from which he retired (while maintaining senior counsel status) in 2015 after more than 50 years of distinguished service to his clients and to the New Hampshire Bar. As with everything else in life, Martin viewed the practice of law as an adventure. He delighted in besting his adversaries and often developed long and lasting friendships with them. His in-house writing boot camps were legendary and his wit and charm were ever present at the office and in the courtroom. While working full-time as a Sulloway lawyer, Martin served three terms as the mayor of Concord. During these years, Martin developed a real talent for cooking. This was driven by necessity since Caroline's busy schedule at the State House meant she was often home late. Undeterred by a complete lack of training (and by a lifelong aversion to cookbooks) Martin channeled his inner top chef and produced thousands of wonderful meals for friends and family. The informal ""Sunday Suppers"" he enjoyed with his close friends Malcolm and Susan McLane, Liz and Dennis Hager and other dear Concord friends were a social staple. Six years after the loss of his beloved Caroline in 1993, fate intervened and Martin met his second wife, Deirdre Sheerr-Gross, architect, New London, NH. The meeting occurred at Chicago's O'Hare Airport where both were waiting to board a flight back to New Hampshire. It would turn out to be a kismet flight on United Airlines (friendly skies indeed!) with Deirdre sitting in seat 2B and Martin (who always flew coach and never paid for upgrades) inexplicably seated in seat 3B directly behind Deirdre. Seeing that seat 2A was open, Martin leaned over and graciously asked Deirdre ""Can I buy you dinner?"" They have been having dinner together ever since. This episode gave Martin plenty of fodder for his expansive repertoire of bad puns....""United"" Airlines.... 2B or not to be.... Martin made the most of it. Six months later, in July 2000, Martin and Deirdre were married. During their 15 year marriage, Martin and Deirdre traveled the world. Despite temporary setbacks (Martin's surgeries, lost luggage, etc.) they visited South America, Africa, Australia, New Zealand, Canada, Central America and multiple European countries. This past September, Martin and Deirdre rented an Airstream trailer and toured Grand Teton and Yellowstone parks; they did not have to sleep outdoors. Over the past few years, one of Martin's happiest endeavors was building a warm winter getaway in Ocean Ridge, FL. He loved living in a house designed by his wife, Deirdre. Two weeks ago, Martin and Deirdre left for Antarctica; a trip that was to be Martin's last great adventure. While southbound on his way to Antarctica on a cruise ship he suffered a stroke and had to be transferred to a passing northbound vessel. That ship docked safely in Ushuaia (the cruise's point of origin) where Martin underwent surgery to relieve a subdural hematoma. Despite excellent care and a successful surgery, Martin contracted an infection from which he did not recover. Martin loved the spontaneity and unpredictability of travel. He would have appreciated the irony of his last great adventure. Martin is survived by his wife, Deirdre Sheerr-Gross, of New London, NH; his brother, Woolf Gross (spouse Lucy) of Arlington, VA; a nephew, William Gross, of Arlington, VA; two cousins, John and Charles Gross, both of New York City, and his brother-in-law (affectionately referred to as ""hermano west,"" Hugh McCrystal (spouse Polly). In addition, Martin is survived by dozens of close friends including his childhood friend, Peter Soloman (who Martin always introduced as ""the man I've never not known""), Will and Sherry Rogers and their two daughters, Anne and Catherine (who were Martin's goddaughters and who lovingly called him ""Uncle Martin""), Peter and Jean Burling, Rick and Karla Karash, Alex Bernhart and Myra Mayman, Merwyn and Carol Bagan, and others too numerous to name. In honor of Martin's extraordinary service to his community, donations can be made to the New Hampshire Charitable Foundation (on whose board he served for many years), to the Capitol Center for the Arts, to New Hampshire Public Radio, or to the charity of one's choice. Funeral arrangements and information about a celebration of Martin's life will be announced at a later date. 1/3"

Sinai Medical School, died on Monday at 79. Born in Montreal, he attended McGill University, edited The McGill Daily, and earned his M.D. at the University of Saskatchewan, where he met Mary, his wife of 54 years. As head of Psychiatry for the New York City Welfare Department under Mayor Koch, he waged a prescient fight against the impending homeless crisis. His patients ranged from celebrities to the indigent, and he was deeply committed to each one as an individual. A broad smile and a winning sense of humor told you instantly that you were in the presence of someone who would sympathetically take the full measure of your being. His stamina was superhuman; he worked long hours and still made himself available round the clock until the day he entered the hospital. His involvement was uncommonly broad, running from child to geriatric, from drugs and talk therapy, to being a pioneer in public psychiatry.

Laurence Finberg, a pediatrician and scientist, was known for his contributions to the management of salt and water balance in children. He served as Chair of Pediatrics at the State University of New York (SUNY) at Downstate in Brooklyn from 1982- 1994, and was Dean of the School of Medicine at SUNY Downstate from 1988-1991. A native of Chicago, Dr. Finberg received an SB (1944) and MD degree (1946) from the University of Chicago. In August, 1950 during a major epidemic of poliomyelitis, when he was the Admitting Officer for Contagious Diseases at Baltimore City Hospitals, he took the bold step of integrating previously segregated medical services by admitting an African American adult to previously all white wards, breaking the color barrier. Dr. Finberg served on the faculty at Johns Hopkins from 1951-1963. He became Chair of Pediatrics at Montefiore Hospital and Professor of Pediatrics at Albert Einstein College of Medicine in 1963. After moving to San Francisco in 1995, he continued to teach Pediatrics, serving on the faculty of both Stanford and UCSF medical schools. Dr. Finberg was beloved by medical students and residents and as teacher and served as a role model for countless young physicians and aspiring physicians. His work led to life-saving treatment for children, especially children from disadvantaged backgrounds all over the world, who have been the victims of dehydration. Dr. Finberg was Chair of the Academy of Pediatrics Committees on Nutrition and Environmental Hazards. An expert in the diagnosis and treatment of lead poisoning in children, he promoted the idea of testing the environment (obtaining lead levels in paint and other areas in the environment), rather than waiting to find high levels in the blood of children. His arguments against ""using children as the canaries in the coal mine,"" changed the emphasis and undoubtedly prevented disease in many children exposed to peeling paint and poor housing conditions. A gentle man, he was incredibly devoted to his friends and family, and will be remembered for his good natured sense of humor that lightened all occasions. In addition to being a devoted husband, father, grandfather, and great-grandfather, he is remembered by his family and friends for his love of chocolate, travel, good wines, and the Chicago Cubs. He is survived by his wife of 20 years, Joann Quane-Finberg, his children Robert W. Finberg, Jeanne Finberg, James M. Finberg, their spouses Joyce, Robert, Melanie, and many loving grandchildren and great-grand children. His first wife, Harriet Levinson Finberg, died in 1994 after 49 years of marriage. 1/3"
2016-01-31T00:00:00Z,"COOPER--Richard A. Richard A. ""Buz"" Cooper, MD, a pioneering cancer research scientist who became one of the world's leading authorities on physician supply and the causes of healthcare disparities, died peacefully at home in New York City on January 15, 2016. During more than 50 years as a physician-scientist, Dr. Cooper had a distinguished and diverse career. He began his clinical and investigative training in hematology and oncology in the 1960s at the National Cancer Institute and Boston City Hospital's Thorndike Laboratory. He later joined the University of Pennsylvania faculty as Chief of Hematology, founded the Abramson Cancer Center, and taught in the Leonard Davis Institute, both at Penn. A native of Milwaukee, Dr. Cooper returned there as dean of the Medical College of Wisconsin in 1985, subsequently founding and directing MCW's Health Policy Institute. Among the first to recognize a potential doctor shortage, Dr. Cooper was a leading authority on the economic and social dynamics underlying healthcare spending and utilization. Increasingly he studied healthcare through the lens of poverty; his book about the effect of income inequality on poor healthcare outcomes will be published by Johns Hopkins University Press later this year. He was preceded in death by his first wife, Jacqueline Cooper, and is survived by his second wife, Andrea Pastor; his current wife, Barrie Cassileth; daughter, Stephanie (David) Cooper Cornelius; son, Jonathan (Eileen Harris) Cooper; and grandchildren, Jordan, Matthew, and Halle Cooper.

Ruth was born in Washington, PA on May 15, 1918, the daughter of Jesse Sachs Yorkin and Maurice A. Yorkin. Ruth adored classical music from early childhood on, studying piano at the Curtis School of Music with Henry Kaufman. In 1938 she married fellow Curtis student, Mario Berini, and they moved to New York City, where Mario began his career as a tenor with the Met. Their only child, Anton, died in infancy of a rare genetic disease, and Ruth's grief sparked her interest in curing genetic illnesses. She spent years working tirelessly as executive director of The Muscular Dystrophy Association and The National Genetics Foundation. When her second husband, New York attorney Jerome Drazen, died of prostate cancer in 1988, she developed an abiding passion for the subject of humanism in medicine, expressing it through the making of documentary films, which she continued to create into her early nineties. Her first film, ""When Doctors Get Cancer,"" was a sensitive look at doctors treating other doctors, in the hope that it might make more humane the care that physicians gave, when they were able to observe themselves as cancer patients. Five other award-winning films followed, most of them shown on PBS. They included, ""The Choice is Yours,"" the inspirational life of the great psychiatrist, Victor Frankl, ""A Wayfayer's Journey; Listening to Mahler;"" ""Notes From the Edge, the Diary of Peter J. Morgan, M.D.,"" an intimate narrative of the last two years of the life of a 29-year old physician diagnosed with cancer, and ""Healing Through Humanism,"" a five DVD teaching series devoted to the practice of compassionate medicine. Ruth was an intellectual and spiritual inspiration to everyone she touched, and will be sorely missed. Ruth is survived by a son, Myron Drazen and daughter-in-law, Lucille; a sister, Martha Yorkin Berman; two step-sons, Michael and Roger Drazen and seven grandchildren, Julie, Debra, Jacob, Dylan, Emily, Kate and Zoe Drazen.

Henry created a wonderful life for his family and for the many others who benefited from his generosity. He graduated from Stuyvesant High School, William & Mary College and Yale University School of Architecture. He was a naval officer in the South Pacific during World War II. Henry was an architect, a builder and an artist. He built thousands of apartments in New York City. Every part of the development process carried his imprint. Henry was a master of making things-creating gave him joy. Whether he was building an apartment tower or creating illustrations that accompany the recipes of the renowned chef Andre Soltner's cookbook, Henry's passion never stopped. In addition to the building legacy he created, Henry was, in his own words, the inventor of important things: the 12"" kitchen cabinet and innovative real estate advertising- including the successful campaign for 85 John Street, 'featuring lousy views and flushing toilets.' The fancy suspender companies will sorely miss Henry, who supported their industry and whose industry supported his pants. Although he oversalted everything, he managed to live to 96.

2016-01-31T00:00:00Z,"SLOAN--Howard, WWII bomber pilot, former Chairman of New York Blood Center, died at 91. From a base in East Anglia during World War II, 19 year old Howard Sloan flew 33 missions over Germany. His B-24 was named ""The Stork Club."" When praised for his bravery, he would invariably respond: ""Was there a choice?"" Cheers erupted from a crowd on the beach when, piloting his plane home to the states after the war, he dipped his wings over the Inwood Country Club. Mr. Sloan was born in New York City on March 20, 1924. He graduated from the Woodmere Academy and Pawling Preparatory School, and received a Bachelor of Arts degree from Yale University, Class of '45W. He and his late wife, Sonny, along with George and Barbara Bush, were the only two married couples on campus. Dreams of business school were dashed by financial necessity and he joined his father's insurance company, Harris, Sloan and Finn. Characteristically, he turned the experience into a colorful one, representing clients such as Restaurant Associates; Richard Burton, who dispatched him to Rome to deliver a diamond he'd bought at auction for Elizabeth Taylor, or Cartier to present a love bracelet to Valentino, who insisted Howard personally fasten it on his wrist. He became an art insurer, developing great interest and knowledge of art in the process, befriending numerous artists and inspiring a lifetime of collecting: Mayan and PreColumbian sculpture, works by artists as diverse as Giacometti and Bill King, Henry Moore and Lindner. He acquired an art gallery, Multiples, for his wife, Sonny, and Marian Goodman to run. In 1990, he was invited by his friend and mentor, Charles Wohlstetter, to become a partner in the latter's acquisitions of hundreds of independent telephone companies from Alaska to California. They formed Continental Telephone, later known as Contel, in 1962. The company then agreed to be acquired by GTE, a combination that created the nation's largest local telephone company. Sloan remained on the Board of GTE until it was restructured as Verizon. In 1968, an American syndicate acquired an 18th century chateau in Bordeaux with Wohlstetter and Sloan installed as new owners. Chateau Bouscaut was the second most beautiful vineyard in Bordeaux, Sloan proclaimed, second, he said, because he didn't want to boast. Among the many American guests who flocked to visit, his favorite was Mary Lindsay, whom he overheard saying to her husband, then mayor of NYC, ""John, if I have to see one more vineyard, I'll kill myself."" To Sloan's eternal regret, Bouscat was sold in 1980. Mayor Lindsay brought Sloan onto the board of the Vivian Beaumont Theatre in 1984. At that time, according to Andre Bishop, current artistic director, ""Nobody would give you a nickel for the Beaumont."" It is now one of the leading theatrical companies in New York, if not the world. Mr. Sloan served on the Board until his death on Thursday. In 1977, Sloan joined the Board of Trustees of the New York Blood Center, of which he was Chairman from 1993 to 2000, nominating his successor, Howard Milstein. In January 2013, a congressional extension prepared by Representative Carolyn Maloney in recognition of Mr. Sloan's 15 years of distinguished service and dedication to NYBC's mission, was entered into the congressional record. She cited his humanitarian status and commended his leadership and tireless advocacy. For several years, he presided as Chairman of Northside Center for Child Development, founded by Kenneth and Mamie Clarke, earning a colleague's recent comment, ""There was a time this place wouldn't have existed without Howard Sloan."" He and his wife are to be honored for their dedication to Northside at a gala in May 2017. Howard Sloan died of kidney failure in Columbia-Presbyterian Hospital on January 21, 2016. Handsome as a film star, he will be remembered for his elegance and extraordinary wit. He is survived by his wife, Barbara; two daughters, Kathryn Roth of Weston, Massachusetts, Gillis Cone of Woodbury, Connecticut; a son, Douglas Sloan, of Palm Beach; a stepdaughter, Paulette Bartlett Robinson, of Los Angeles, and four grandchildren.

Adoring grandfather of Ceara, Melanie, Matthew, Latham, Alexander, Beatrice, and Anabelle. Son of the late William Todd Fairbairn Jr. and Mary Elizabeth Latham. Brother of the late Latham Todd, Anne Fairbairn, and Patti Gibney. Uncle to wonderful nieces and nephews. Friend and colleague to many. He lived life fully with passion, energy, and style.

He loved language and words of every form-crosswords, all kinds of word puzzles, limericks, gifting books, reading books with grandchildren and more. So it was no surprise that after returning to NYC in 1996, he enrolled full time in Bill Esper's two year Acting Program and upon graduation, with his deep resonant voice, played numerous stage parts including leading roles in The Late Henry Moss, Cockfighters, Buried Child, Merchant of Venice, The Play About Henry, Long Day's Journey into Night as well as playing Lear in three productions of King Lear.

2016-01-31T00:00:00Z,"SCHWARTZ--Sol. Sol Schwartz, of Sarasota, Florida passed away on December 25, 2015 at the age of 84. Sol was a gifted and prolific artist, the founder of the nationally acclaimed Options college counseling program, a talented musician, a dedicated art teacher and guidance counselor at Sheepshead Bay High School. Sol was the de facto ""artist in residence"" at Tanglewood Music Center in the Berkshires where he created the iconic graphic of Seiji Ozawa now immortalized on Tanglewood's poster. His work has been exhibited at the Norman Rockwell Museum in Stockbridge, MA, at the Massachusetts College of Art in Boston, numerous galleries, and is to be featured in an upcoming show at Wigmore Hall, London. A selection of his art can be viewed at www.solschwartz.com. The son of Ukrainian Jewish immigrants, Sol grew up on Manhattan's Lower East Side. As a child, he lugged wet wash up tenements to his father's laundry's customers. Sol started drawing at five. He entered New York City's High School of Music and Art. By 16 Sol had joined the New York Mandolin Symphony Orchestra. He starred in the play ""Tomorrow the World"" as a teen. At 35 he studied cello and played in a quartet, and at 60 learned jazz piano. He studied art at Brooklyn College with New York School artists Mark Rothko, Ad Reinhardt, Alfred Russell, and Robert Jay Wolff. Following his graduation in 1952, he taught art and, after receiving a Master's degree in Counseling, served as a guidance counselor at Sheepshead Bay High School. Frustrated by the limited college and financial aid resources available to his students, Schwartz created a program to help the students explore options, navigate applications and obtain aid. Without assistance from the public school administration, Schwartz designed the Options program, obtained mainframe computer access, and researched college and aid data nationwide. He integrated a culture of participation and giving back: seniors worked and assisted the younger students in the Options office. It was the first of its kind in the country. After Options was instituted, students gained entrance to elite universities, graduated without debilitating debt, and achieved significant careers in the arts, investment banking, teaching, medicine and public health. Sol's Options program relocated to New York City's Goddard Riverside in 1985 where Sol built it into the gold standard college access program that today is a key partner to Michelle Obama's Reach Higher Initiative. The program remains as Sol intended it: non-profit, free of charge, available to all, providing the finest level of college and financial aid counseling services, all delivered free with one proviso, that Options' recipients give back to others when they can. After retiring from the school system, Sol returned to his first love: drawing. Combining his love of art with his love of music, theatre and dance, Sol began bringing a sketchbook to performances. Through the years he has sketched Andre Previn, Itzhak Perlman, Emanual Ax, Seiji Ozawa, Yo-Yo Ma, James Levine, Kurt Mazur, Katherine Dunham, Savion Glover, Mark Morris, the Juilliard and Emerson string quartets and others in performance. Sol said he drew during performances to convey ""the spirit of the concert that ineffable nature of a great performance. ""His art is published in the ""Drawing Music"" series and other books, all of artists drawn in performance. Sol's work is in many of the performers' homes. His art often includes a written comment from performers, such as cellist Sharon Robinson, who wrote ""Sol, thank you for capturing my soul."" The unique nature of Sol's art - artists captured in performance - is reflected in the dual introductions to his first book, Drawing Music: The Tanglewood Sketchbooks, with one introduction by Joel Smirnoff, the Juilliard String Quartet's first violinist, who wrote ""Schwartz has captured the unique stage and musical personality of each performer. And the sound of music permeates the atmosphere of each portrait...As performers, we as artists are ever grateful that Sol Schwartz has helped our expression linger in the air yet a moment longer. We celebrate him for his work and for his musicality,"" and the other introduction by art critic Colin Eisler, who wrote ""Sol's lyrical lines pay homage to the musician... retracing the mysterious union of individual, instrument and passion...[his] pages let us share the collective joy of hearing and seeing music made, we the beneficiaries of his arresting lines in all their ecstatic freedom and harmony."" Sol was dedicated to helping people experience the joy of learning. He was a donor to many organizations, including Shakespeare & Company, Children's Book Project, Theater for a New Audience, Kids4Harmony, Norman Rockwell Museum, Tanglewood, Jacob's Pillow, Ringling School of Art and Design, the Guitar Society, Asolo State Theater, La Musica, Perlman Music Program and the Florida Studio Theater. He also quietly helped many others when he saw an opportunity. The force of his interest in people and life, and his determination to help others was palpable. Sol was a loving husband to his first wife Lillian, a devoted father to Risa and David, and a delighted grandfather to John Cortner. After Lillian's death in 1999, Sol married Elayne P. Bernstein, who shared his passion for the arts and generosity, introducing him to Shakespeare & Company in Lenox. MA where he served as a trustee. In addition to his immediate family, Sol is survived by several cousins and countless friends who will deeply miss him. Memorial services will be held in Sarasota, FL on February 13 at 2pm and in Lenox, MA during the summer of 2016. Condolences may be sent to the family at P.O. Box 73, Lenox, MA 01240. In lieu of flowers, donations may be made in Sol's honor to the Children's Book Project (www.children sbookproject.org, 3433 21st Street, San Francisco, CA 94110), Shakespeare & Company (www.shakespeare.org, 70 Kemble Street, Lenox, MA 01240) and Kids4Harmony (www.berkshirechildren.org, 480 West Street, Pittsfield, MA 01201). 1/3"
2016-01-31T00:00:00Z,"HUDNER--Hope Freeman. Artist, Designer, Mother and Friend. Hope F. Hudner died at home in Little Compton, RI on January 14, 2016 following a thirteen month battle with glioblastoma multiforme, a form of brain cancer. Hope is survived by her husband of 40 years, Michael, and her daughter, Bay, who were deeply involved as caregivers and comforters during the past year, and were at her side at the time of her peaceful passing. Hope is also survived by her aunt, Judy Freeman N. Gross; brothers, Ambassador Charles ""Chas"" W. Freeman, Jr. (Margaret Carpenter) and Robert P. Freeman (Inge Reist); their five children and nine grandchildren (Hope's grand-nieces and -nephews); siblings-in-law, Mr. Kennedy Hudner (Jennifer), Ms. Cornelia Futterman (Michael), and Ms. Kristina Beitman (Harty), and their five children. Hope was born on January 11, 1951 in Nassau, The Bahamas, and lived there until age 10, then alternating time in Southern California with years in Providence and Bristol, RI. Hope was predeceased by her son, Michael Ripley (""Rip"") Hudner, and her parents (father, Charles Wellman Freeman, and mother, Carla Park Freeman, who died when Hope was 20 months old). Hope was largely raised by her two sets of deceased grandparents, Hovey T. and Marjorie W. Freeman of Providence and Bristol, and Edward and Fentress K. Park of Wollaston, MA and Roaring Brook, MI. Hope graduated from The Lincoln School, Providence (1969), Smith College (1973), and also acquired an MFA from New York University. The family lived in New York City from 1974 through 1994, and then resided in Little Compton and Providence, RI. Hope was an accomplished artist and designer with a portfolio including work in graphic, interior, jewelry, and apparel design. These efforts led to her 2013 creation of Hope Hudner Designs, focused on elegant silk infinity scarves. Hope was deeply involved in Rhode Island public service, including, at various times, board and/or development responsibilities at Moses Brown School, Women & Infants Hospital, Rhode Islanders Sponsoring Education (RISE), RISD Museum, Perennial Planters, The National Society of the Colonial Dames of America (Rhode Island), and Providence Preservation Society. Hope's social involvements included membership in the Providence Art Club, Colony Club of New York City, Lyford Cay Club, Sakonnet Golf Club, and Sakonnet Point Club. Hope had great admiration for the natural world and actively cultivated a sense of wonder: she was a faithful student of plants and flowers (as evidenced by the thousands of bulbs planted across Rhode Island, Maine, and New York); she loved sailing with her family and friends (countless excursions on Narragansett Bay and longer trips to Maine, Nova Scotia, Newfoundland, and Ireland number among the most special); and her keen curiosity led her to explore the far corners of the world, from Spain and Taiwan at age 18 to Antarctica at 49, covering every other continent and many countries in between. Hope had enormous energy, deep intelligence, natural grace, and remarkable warmth. She believed that life presented endless opportunity to learn, remarking on the tenth anniversary of her son's death that, ""Each time it rains in our lives, we are given an opportunity for further growth. I am grateful for the challenges in my life as chances to grow and blossom."" Hope faced her illness with the same fortitude and poise. While she was indeed a lifelong learner, Hope was perhaps most notable as a teacher of these invaluable lessons to the rest of us. Hope felt a profound duty to embrace everyone she encountered with love and kindness, and she shared this love of people and life like water from a fire hose. All within range were enriched by her presence and generosity of spirit. Hope inspired people to think lovingly and boldly on behalf of the larger community, themselves, and their friends, prompting many to find more inside themselves to enhance their own lives and those of others. A college classmate of Bay's said it beautifully in a recent note to Hope: ""You feature prominently as an inspiration for the life I want to live-to pursue my interests, to live fully and with panache, to spend time in nature, and, most of all, to be kind to people. I know I am just one of the many, many people you affect in this way!"" A celebration of Hope's life will be held in Little Compton in early June on a date to be announced. In lieu of flowers, the family suggests contributions in Hope's memory be made to: the Rip Hudner Memorial Fund at Moses Brown School, Providence; Dr. Patrick Wen's Research in Neuro-Oncology at Dana Faber Cancer Institute, Boston; or a charity of your choice. Above all, the family encourages you to remember Hope by engaging with the world through love and kindness. 1/3"

They lived in Los Angeles, CA in a house designed for them by Lloyd Wright where, at the age of 101, Mrs. Kaufman died peacefully on January 25, 2016. The Kaufmans were well known in the Los Angeles pre-and post-war cultural scene. They were the first collectors of Milton Avery and, being softhearted and generous, helped many struggling painters during Depression-era America. In Brussels after the war, they were shown an obscure piece of music by Vivaldi, The Four Seasons; Mr. Kaufman became the first person to record it. A generous benefactor to many cultural institutions including the Library of Congress, the National Portrait Gallery and the Portland Art Museum, Annette was a vivid raconteur of a time in Europe and Los Angeles that, while largely faded from memory, lived on in her ebullient recounting of it. 1/3"

2016-01-31T00:00:00Z,"SMITH--Howard. NYU Lutheran's board and staff are deeply saddened by the passing of chair emeritus Howard Smith. As chairman of Lutheran Medical Center and Augustana Center from 1966 until 2004, Smith, who died Thursday at age 85, left an indelible legacy on southwest Brooklyn. With his friend New York City Mayor John Lindsay and the American Lutheran Church, Mr. Smith brokered the 1977 expansion and relocation of Lutheran Medical Center from 4th Avenue and 46th Street to its present location, a former warehouse at 55th Street and 2nd Avenue in Sunset Park. He facilitated the creation of the Sunset Park Family Health Center, now called NYU Lutheran Family Health Centers, the second largest federally qualified health center network in the nation. He created a lasting financial foundation for Lutheran through Health Plus, an innovative government-sponsored insurance program for low-income residents. Lutheran's sale of Health Plus to Amerigroup in 2011 created an endowment that continues to help modernize the health system. Mr. Smith, a lifelong Brooklyn resident, was chairman emeritus of the United Hospital Fund, former president of the Brooklyn Public Library Board of Trustees, and past vice president and director of the Brooklyn Chamber of Commerce. Mr. Smith received a bachelor's in chemical engineering from Princeton University and served in the U.S. Army. He served 40 years as president of Virginia Dare Extract Company, which was founded by his grandfather Bernard, and was a former director of Dime Savings Bank of New York before it merged with Washington Mutual in 2002.

2016-01-31T00:00:00Z,"LANEY--Christina B. Christina Bertrand Laney, age 83, of New York City died January 21, 2016. A classic ""New Yorker,"" in every sense of the word, Christina was a native of the Upper West Side for over 50 years. She was an avid Riverside Park gardener, a frequent face at Fairway, and knew every sidewalk crack and crevasse of the Upper West Side. The daughter of Vera Federoff, of Ryazan, Russia, and Bertrand J. Laney, of New York City, Christina was born in Hankow, China, on December 28, 1932, her family fleeing China in 1940, shortly after the Japanese offensive. A true explorer, Christina traveled the world with her family, attending schools in China, Panama, El Salvador, and finally, at the University of Texas, and at New York University. It was in 1953, that Christina, in her own words, ""found her Nirvana""-New York City. For over 30 years, she was involved in the entertainment industry, acting in small movie and television roles, then working behind the scenes in public relations, advertising, and film production. At United Artists, Christina was the Assistant to the Director of Special Projects for six years. She also worked for the Writer's Guild. Christina was a Vice President of Women of the Motion Picture Industry, and won their Dottie Reeves Humanitarian Award for Community Service. Christina's hobbies were manifold. Her diminutive size and powerhouse personality made her a natural spelunker. She was a member of the National Speleological Society for many years. A talented artist and poet in her own right, Christina supported Women in Motion Pictures, and the Curtain Club. She championed dozens of causes including: The Humane Society, The New York Historical Society, Sierra Club, The Wilderness Society, World Wildlife Fund, The Nature Conservancy, and the ASPCA. Christina was a lifelong volunteer for groups such as Channel 13, The Girl Scout Council of Greater New York, and, for 50 years, the Riverside Park Conservancy, where she was honored for her volunteer contribution in her beloved garden on 78th Street and Riverside Drive. Before there was Google, there was Christina. A voracious reader and a fount of knowledge about a myriad of subjects, especially New York City, family and friends could always rely on Christina for an irrefutable answer. Into her 80s, Christina was a brilliant, plucky, feisty spitfire who continued to stimulate her mind by regular attendance at jazz concerts, museums, art galleries, and theater. She was a devoted sister, aunt, cousin, and friend-a tiny woman with a huge spirit, who will be deeply missed. Christina is survived by her older sister, Kera Toline Rogers of Charleston, SC; niece Catherine Anna Toline, husband Leo Lentsch; nephews, John Colin Toline, and son John, Mark Anderson Toline, wife Ann, and son North, and Paul Alexander Toline; and cousins, Barbara Laney Swenson of Hanover, New Hampshire, Ainslie Drummond of Florida, and Irene Morgan Kay of Australia. Christina's ashes will be interred in Moline, Illinois, with her parents and Russian grandmother, Barbara (Babi) Federoff. In lieu of flowers, donations may be made in memory of Christina B.

2016-02-03T00:00:00Z,"GROSS--Martin L. Martin L. Gross of New London, NH and Ocean Ridge, FL died on Tuesday, January 26, 2016 in Ushuaia, Argentina following a stroke suffered en route to Antarctica. He was 77 years old. Martin's adventures began in New York City where he was born on October 22, 1938. As a young child, Martin and his older brother, Woolf, were dispatched to summer camps and later to working cattle ranches in Utah during the summer months to escape the polio outbreaks that plagued New York City in the years following World War II. After high school, Martin headed north to Cambridge, MA where he attended both Harvard College and Harvard Law School, graduating from the latter in 1964. Before embarking on his first job as a law clerk in New Hampshire, Martin and his first wife, the late Caroline Lord Gross, purchased a Volkswagen pop-up camper and drove to Alaska with Martin's mother, Harriet. Harriet slept in the camper; Martin and Caroline slept outdoors in a tent. After several weeks of abysmal weather the camper was coated with a thick layer of adobe-colored mud. When the trio returned to Concord and washed the car for the first time, it was in pristine condition. Thereafter, Martin never worried much if his car was dirty. Following his clerkship, Martin joined the Concord, New Hampshire law firm of Sulloway & Hollis, P.L.L.C. from which he retired (while maintaining senior counsel status) in 2015 after more than 50 years of distinguished service to his clients and to the New Hampshire Bar. As with everything else in life, Martin viewed the practice of law as an adventure. He delighted in besting his adversaries and often developed long and lasting friendships with them. His in-house writing boot camps were legendary and his wit and charm were ever present at the office and in the courtroom. While working full-time as a Sulloway lawyer, Martin served three terms as the mayor of Concord. During these years, Martin developed a real talent for cooking. This was driven by necessity since Caroline's busy schedule at the State House meant she was often home late. Undeterred by a complete lack of training (and by a lifelong aversion to cookbooks) Martin channeled his inner top chef and produced thousands of wonderful meals for friends and family. The informal ""Sunday Suppers"" he enjoyed with his close friends Malcolm and Susan McLane, Liz and Dennis Hager and other dear Concord friends were a social staple. Six years after the loss of his beloved Caroline in 1993, fate intervened and Martin met his second wife, Deirdre Sheerr-Gross, architect, New London, NH. The meeting occurred at Chicago's O'Hare Airport where both were waiting to board a flight back to New Hampshire. It would turn out to be a kismet flight on United Airlines (friendly skies indeed!) with Deirdre sitting in seat 2B and Martin (who always flew coach and never paid for upgrades) inexplicably seated in seat 3B directly behind Deirdre. Seeing that seat 2A was open, Martin leaned over and graciously asked Deirdre ""Can I buy you dinner?"" They have been having dinner together ever since. This episode gave Martin plenty of fodder for his expansive repertoire of bad puns....""United"" Airlines.... 2B or not to be.... Martin made the most of it. Six months later, in July 2000, Martin and Deirdre were married. During their 15 year marriage, Martin and Deirdre traveled the world. Despite temporary setbacks (Martin's surgeries, lost luggage, etc.) they visited South America, Africa, Australia, New Zealand, Canada, Central America and multiple European countries. This past September, Martin and Deirdre rented an Airstream trailer and toured Grand Teton and Yellowstone parks; they did not have to sleep outdoors. Over the past few years, one of Martin's happiest endeavors was building a warm winter getaway in Ocean Ridge, FL. He loved living in a house designed by his wife, Deirdre. Two weeks ago, Martin and Deirdre left for Antarctica; a trip that was to be Martin's last great adventure. While southbound on his way to Antarctica on a cruise ship he suffered a stroke and had to be transferred to a passing northbound vessel. That ship docked safely in Ushuaia (the cruise's point of origin) where Martin underwent surgery to relieve a subdural hematoma. Despite excellent care and a successful surgery, Martin contracted an infection from which he did not recover. Martin loved the spontaneity and unpredictability of travel. He would have appreciated the irony of his last great adventure. Martin is survived by his wife, Deirdre Sheerr-Gross, of New London, NH; his brother, Woolf Gross (spouse Lucy) of Arlington, VA; a nephew, William Gross, of Arlington, VA; two cousins, John and Charles Gross, both of New York City, and his brother-in-law (affectionately referred to as ""hermano west,"" Hugh McCrystal (spouse Polly). In addition, Martin is survived by dozens of close friends including his childhood friend, Peter Soloman (who Martin always introduced as ""the man I've never not known""), Will and Sherry Rogers and their two daughters, Anne and Catherine (who were Martin's goddaughters and who lovingly called him ""Uncle Martin""), Peter and Jean Burling, Rick and Karla Karash, Alex Bernhart and Myra Mayman, Merwyn and Carol Bagan, and others too numerous to name. In honor of Martin's extraordinary service to his community, donations can be made to the New Hampshire Charitable Foundation (on whose board he served for many years), to the Capitol Center for the Arts, to New Hampshire Public Radio, or to the charity of one's choice. Funeral arrangements and information about a celebration of Martin's life will be announced at a later date. 1/3"

Beloved brother of Morton, Julius and David. Gerry was a brilliant and dedicated OB/GYN who practiced in Queens, NY. He attended McGill University and McGill Medical School and came to NY for his residency where he met Ruth in 1954 and married in 1955. In his life he was totally devoted to his family and to his patients. In 1976 he was the first obstetrician in New York State to perform a Caesarean Section with the husband present in the delivery room. Those who knew him in the operating room still talk about his tremendous surgical skills and his ability to teach his successors. He cared deeply about women's reproductive healthcare and took great pride in his daughter Jill's position as Board Chair of Planned Parenthood Federation of America. He was one of the founding physicians of Booth Memorial Medical Center, now New York Hospital of Queens. His patients adored him and there are many Gerrys and Geralds named after him.

He horseback rode, skated, skied, played tennis and was often spotted jogging and biking through the streets of Great Neck. He retired in 1990 and traveled the world with his wife, Ruth and spent his time with his grandchildren. He was proud of his knowledge of Shakespeare, constantly quoting him as well as much of classical literature. He was a voracious reader and an astute investor, one of his talents and loves. He was a wordsmith and enjoyed studying the derivation of words and their meanings. His knowledge of history and literature were legendary in our family. He took cooking lessons and enjoyed cooking and wines. He loved the opera, hockey and a good dramatic play. Most of all, he had a great sense of humor and an appreciation and a love of life. He loved his jokes and repeated them often! He will be missed by his family and friends but his memory and life lessons will live on in our hearts forever.

Her greatest legacy is her grandchildren, Rachel and Chloe Fadem; Mark, Daniel and Sarah Hayden; Caitlin and Carly Ivrey and Cody Kennedy, who were all madly in love with their Grandma Sunny and she loved them back with an intense fervor. She taught all of us what it means to be loving and caring and how to overcome any adversity with a smile, tenacity and grit. She will be missed in ways she will never understand.

His passion for helping children learn to read was his driving force. He put his heart and soul into READ 180 and other programs designed to serve the diverse populations of children who needed stories in which they could find themselves.

2016-02-07T00:00:00Z,"SCHOTTLAND--Stanley Adrian. If success can be measured by happiness, then Stan Schottland was a very successful man. He had a charmed life and in every way, the American dream. Stanley Adrian Schottland was born May 27th, 1919 in New York City to Ruth and Charles Schottland. He was predeceased by his older brother Jack. Stan attended DeWitt Clinton High School, but after his father died during his senior year, he chose to leave to go to work and help support his family. The year was 1936. Stan enlisted in the Army the day after Pearl Harbor, was promoted to Lieutenant and landed on Omaha beach in July 1944 as part of George Patton's army. He fought bravely and was wounded in action in September of that year. During his training state side, he met the love of his life Ellen Bordley Schottland in Sebring Florida. Ellen and Stan were married on December 24, 1944 in Chestertown, MD. They had three sons: Charles (Buck), Steven and Peter who they adored. Married more than sixty years, what a life they shared together. Stan and Ellen made friends all across the country where they owned homes including Bronxville, NY, Chestertown, Maryland, Rochester, NY, Gladwyne, PA, Cordillera, Colorado, Kiawah Island, SC, Hobe Sound, Florida and Naples, Florida. Soon after the war, he went back to work for Schenley Distillers where he began his career as an office boy years earlier. Stan was employed by Schenley for 27 years, including his three years while serving in the Army. With Stan's tenacious drive, he rose to the position of President of their Bourbon Division. In 1963, his career was flourishing but Stan was determined to own his own company. In 1966, he joined hands with a small bag manufacturer named American Bag and Paper located in Philadelphia and together they purchased Northern Packaging in Rochester, NY. Three years later, Stan was invited to come to Philadelphia and take over American Bag and Paper as a partner and CEO. In 1986, he bought out his partner with his three sons and grew the company to what is today American Packaging Corporation. American Packaging is one of America's largest privately owned flexible packaging companies employing over 800 families. Stan's philanthropic efforts were significant. With a passion for young talent and leadership skills, Stan founded several programs at the College of Charleston and Washington College. Another passion of Stan's was the health and well-being of children. American Packaging is one of the founding companies supporting Paul Newman's Hole in the Wall Gang Camp. While his military career was formidable, his business success quite remarkable and his charitable passions to be respected, at the end of the day, family was everything to him. Stan absolutely adored his elegant lady Ellen, his sons Buck, Steven and Peter, his 10 grandchildren and his 10 great-grandchildren. Most summers were spent on the Eastern Shore of Maryland surrounded by friends and family. In his later years after Ellen's passing, he had the blessing of companionship with a wonderful lady named Betty Flora. Stan touched so many people along the way and will be truly missed by all.

Always generous with sharing his profound knowledge, Bill returned questions posed to him from all over the world through ever inspired and voluminous emails, phone calls and letters. He was truly a correspondent extraordinaire. There is no doubt that his legacy and work will only continue to expand its reach in the future. The Ray Johnson Estate is profoundly grateful for the many thrilling conceptions and inceptions, on Ray Johnson and in all of his art scholarship, with which Bill has left us. The art world, this estate, and his many friends and family, have lost a cherished friend and mentor. Richard L. Feigen, Chairman Frances F. L. Beatty, President, Richard L. Feigen & Co. 1/3"

She lived in Manhattan with her husband, Michael Dubin, whom she married in 1982. She and her husband raised three daughters, Krista, Erika and Karoline, who each regard her as their best friend. Randi was selflessly devoted to her daughters and had the ability to make others feel part of the family. She was known as a film aficionado, a gifted chef and a close confidante. Randi had a lifelong interest in advocating for animal rights, adopting four rescue animals and volunteering with Camp Rusk, a foundation for retired horses. While struggling with a motor neuropathy, she inspired us with her sharp wit and vibrant sense of humor. Her ashes will be scattered onto Accabonac Harbor off the dock of the Dubins' Hamptons property. In addition to her daughters and her husband, she is survived by her parents, Einar and Louise Thulin of Staten Island, NY, and two brothers, Richard Thulin of Bethlehem, PA, and John-David Thulin of Southampton, NY. A memorial service will be held on Sat February 20th at 10:30am in Manhattan at St. Jean Baptiste Church (184 East 76th Street). 1/3"

Beloved wife of Robert; sister to Harry, Virginia, and Jackie; mother to Christopher, Barbara and Thomas; mother-in-law to Kari, Chuck, and Claire; grandmother to Ryan, Kyle, Samantha, Matthew, Elisa, Kristia, Danielle, Caitlin, Juliet, and Isobel, and great grandmother to Brandon, Charlotte, Maverick, Daemon, Wade, and Aurora. She was the guiding light of the MacCrate family. Born in Laconia, New Hampshire in 1920 to Judge Harry Trapp and Florence McGloughlin Trapp, she lived her life as a true New Hampshirite, following the state motto: Live Free or Die, and taught by example humility, kindness, and resolve (some say stubbornness) to all who met her. Devoted to children and education, she volunteered for many years at Shelter Rock School, taught Sunday school at the Congregational Church of Manhasset, and never missed a game or recital or anything else her kids participated in, always offering her unfaltering support. She was a true constant in her family's lives. Connie matriculated from Mount Holyoke College in 1942, went on to work at Harvard Business School, and met her husband, Robert MacCrate, while he was attending Harvard Law School. They were married on May 4,1946 in Laconia, New Hampshire, and spent the next 69 years together, until her passing with Robert at her side. She was remembered privately by the family. Those who would like to share in her remembrance may send memorial gifts to The Legal Aid Society of New York (www.donate.legal-aid.org); questions regarding these gifts may be directed to Connie's granddaughter Caitlin MacCrate (cjmaccrate@ gmail.com), who is running the New York City Half Marathon to benefit the Legal Aid Society in her grandmother's honor. 1/3"

Arbitrator of labor- management disputes for almost his entire 58 year career, he served as umpire in major industries, including steel, automotive, beverage and government service. Mittenthal wrote many papers on the craft of arbitration, including an oft-cited article on past practice. He served as President of the National Academy of Arbitrators (1978-79) and received a lifetime achievement award from the Michigan Bar in 2015. Raised in NYC, he graduated Cornell University and New York University law school. He was predeceased by his loving wife of 61 years, Joyce Janeway. They married in 1953 and moved to Detroit, MI where he spent the majority of his life and career. He was not only devoted to his work, but to being husband and father. He loved tennis, practiced poetry and was a fervent football fan. The rigor he displayed in his work carried to all aspects of his life. He was driven to know the ""you"" of you, your values, the reasoning underlying them, your deep thoughts. And his courage in sharing all those things about himself encouraged you to feel sufficiently accepted and secure to respond in kind. In his 1979 NAA presidential address, he quipped that he'd experienced a dream where he saw the headline on his own obituary. It read: ""Arbitrator seeks immortality; grievance denied.""

Raised on the Upper West Side, Dan was a third generation New Yorker. He grew up with a love of tap dancing and drumming throughout his childhood, and starred in musical theater performances at his high school, Ethical Culture Fieldston School in the Bronx and at Cornell University.

Beyond his creative talents, what distinguished Daniel was a profound commitment to honesty, fairness and concern for the less fortunate. He was a fiercely loyal, loving and caring human being. The humanity, humor, and compassion that he brought to his writing, he brought to his family and friends in equal measure. The heart of his life was his family, his deep love for his wife of 20 years, Beau Stacom, his two children, Claire and Asher, his parents, Mary-Joan and Charles Gerson, his sister, Jessica Gerson, and her children, Daisy and Henry, as well as nieces and nephews.

2016-02-08T00:00:00Z,"SCHOTTLAND--Stanley Adrian. If success can be measured by happiness, then Stan Schottland was a very successful man. He had a charmed life and in every way, the American dream. Stanley Adrian Schottland was born May 27th, 1919 in New York City to Ruth and Charles Schottland. He was predeceased by his older brother Jack. Stan attended DeWitt Clinton High School, but after his father died during his senior year, he chose to leave to go to work and help support his family. The year was 1936. Stan enlisted in the Army the day after Pearl Harbor, was promoted to Lieutenant and landed on Omaha beach in July 1944 as part of George Patton's army. He fought bravely and was wounded in action in September of that year. During his training state side, he met the love of his life Ellen Bordley Schottland in Sebring Florida. Ellen and Stan were married on December 24, 1944 in Chestertown, MD. They had three sons: Charles (Buck), Steven and Peter who they adored. Married more than sixty years, what a life they shared together. Stan and Ellen made friends all across the country where they owned homes including Bronxville, NY, Chestertown, Maryland, Rochester, NY, Gladwyne, PA, Cordillera, Colorado, Kiawah Island, SC, Hobe Sound, Florida and Naples, Florida. Soon after the war, he went back to work for Schenley Distillers where he began his career as an office boy years earlier. Stan was employed by Schenley for 27 years, including his three years while serving in the Army. With Stan's tenacious drive, he rose to the position of President of their Bourbon Division. In 1963, his career was flourishing but Stan was determined to own his own company. In 1966, he joined hands with a small bag manufacturer named American Bag and Paper located in Philadelphia and together they purchased Northern Packaging in Rochester, NY. Three years later, Stan was invited to come to Philadelphia and take over American Bag and Paper as a partner and CEO. In 1986, he bought out his partner with his three sons and grew the company to what is today American Packaging Corporation. American Packaging is one of America's largest privately owned flexible packaging companies employing over 800 families. Stan's philanthropic efforts were significant. With a passion for young talent and leadership skills, Stan founded several programs at the College of Charleston and Washington College. Another passion of Stan's was the health and well-being of children. American Packaging is one of the founding companies supporting Paul Newman's Hole in the Wall Gang Camp. While his military career was formidable, his business success quite remarkable and his charitable passions to be respected, at the end of the day, family was everything to him. Stan absolutely adored his elegant lady Ellen, his sons Buck, Steven and Peter, his 10 grandchildren and his 10 great-grandchildren. Most summers were spent on the Eastern Shore of Maryland surrounded by friends and family. In his later years after Ellen's passing, he had the blessing of companionship with a wonderful lady named Betty Flora. Stan touched so many people along the way and will be truly missed by all. God bless "" Stan the man, Dad , Grandpa and GG Pop "". A Funeral Service will be held on Sunday, February 14 at 1:00pm at St. Paul's Kent Episcopal Church, Chestertown.

From the time he first stepped onto the field as manager of the 1945-1946 football team, until his death on February 6, 2016, he never wavered in his love of his alma mater. His counsel to deans and presidents; his leadership on the 55M Campaign during the 1960s, Capital Campaign Planning Committee in the 1970s and Honorary Chairmanship of the College's 150th Anniversary Campaign in the 2000s; his generosity of heart to staff and students-these were among his many contributions that spoke to the quality of character that was his hallmark. In 1998, the College was pleased to award John its highest distinction, the Alumni Society Medal, honoring the profound effect his leadership in construction management had on the construction industry. The University was proud to bestow upon him an honorary Doctor of Engineering degree in 2000 in recognition of his transformative contributions to construction management as well as his civic and philanthropic activities.

Stunned by the bitter winds that swirled around Bryn Mawr College during the winter of 1958, Grace van Hulsteyn and her college friend Betsy Nelson crouched a colorful wool contraption that fit over the nose and was secured at the back of the head. Fellow classmates asked for examples and eventually the devices caused a bit of stir in ever widening circles until one of the apogees of pop culture stardom in the 1950s, the TV show What's My Line, got wind (so to speak) of the phenomenon and the young inventors appeared on the March 23, 1958 broadcast. Their claim to faddish fame was discovered by panelist Arlene Francis, but the pair returned to school with their noses held high. After a three year battle with ALS, Miss van Hulsteyn, suffered a stroke, thereby denying ALS its victory over her. She passed away December 12, 2015 at the New York Visiting Nurses facility, The Haven. Grace pursued many interests: ceramics, law practice, french horn, living in Rome, travel, working on her beloved barn and property in Cochecton, NY. Grace would have become annoyed if they were all to be mentioned, as she was extremely ""frugal"" and this obituary is ""pay by the word.""

Kerbs and William Kallman Kerbs, brother of Edward A. Kerbs and Carlee Kerbs Walker, and loving husband of Hildegard Johnson Kerbs, all of whom predeceased him. John was a paradigmatic member of that greatest generation.

As a young adult, John was active in such adventurous pursuits as hunting, racing midget cars, and flying airplanes before embarking on a career as a stock broker, financial consultant, and businessman. His passion for electronics and technology first developed when he worked with a team of Lawrenceville students rebuilding aircraft engines during WWII, was widely known among his family and friends.

Ambassador Duke understood in 1980 that Japan and the United States were moving into an era of unnecessary friction over trade and other issues, friction that threatened our alliance. With characteristic energy and vision, she approached Mr. Ryoichi Sasakawa, a Japanese philanthropist, and persuaded him to make a generous contribution of $45 million to endow what has become today the US-Japan Foundation in New York. In the past 35 years this foundation has donated more than $90 million to our core programs, enhancing K-12 education in each country about the other, bringing young leaders from both nations together into lasting networks of communication and friendship, and more recently, strengthening the role of women in both nations. Robin Duke played a critical role in building a strong board of trustees, infusing the board and staff with her dynamism and practical knowledge of international affairs, and her strong conviction that Japan and the U.S. share the same values.

2016-02-14T00:00:00Z,"DUKE--Robin Chandler. The trustees and staff of the United States - Japan Foundation note with deep sadness the passing of our beloved founder, Robin Chandler Duke, on February 6. Ambassador Duke understood in 1980 that Japan and the United States were moving into an era of unnecessary friction over trade and other issues, friction that threatened our alliance. With characteristic energy and vision, she approached Mr. Ryoichi Sasakawa, a Japanese philanthropist, and persuaded him to make a generous contribution of $45 million to endow what has become today the US-Japan Foundation in New York. In the past 35 years this foundation has donated more than $90 million to our core programs, enhancing K-12 education in each country about the other, bringing young leaders from both nations together into lasting networks of communication and friendship, and more recently, strengthening the role of women in both nations. Robin Duke played a critical role in building a strong board of trustees, infusing the board and staff with her dynamism and practical knowledge of international affairs, and her strong conviction that Japan and the U.S. share the same values. Her legacy will last well into the future. We miss her vibrant presence. James Lintott, Chairman of the Board; George R. Packard, President 1/3"

2016-02-14T00:00:00Z,"LEE--Robert Morton. 88, renowned automobile and antique arms collector, explorer and conservationist passed away January 28, 2016 in Reno, NV surrounded by friends and his devoted wife, Anne Brockinton Lee. He was born in Woodmere, Long Island, NY on October 2, 1927. He was taught a love of nature and the outdoors by his parents, Dr. William F. Lee and Sally W. Lee. He graduated from Oakwood Friends School in Poughkeepsie and attended Lehigh University in Pennsylvania majoring in Engineering and Business. He served in the U.S. Army. Mr. Lee was a ""Renaissance Man"" who presented a multi-faceted talent to the world. He turned his hand to many things and rarely failed. He was a premier fly-tier; successful builder-developer; excellent rifle shot and fly-fisherman; safari outfitter and PH in Africa; designer and manufacturer of a multitude of outdoor equipment, fine luggage and clothing; a patron of the arts; a merchandiser and marketing wiz; an author of many books; an explorer and natural scientist with museum accreditation; a classic car and antique gun collector nonpareil. During his life, his inquisitive nature, keen intelligence and sense of fearless daring carried him ever further, pushing back horizons and challenging the new or unthinkable. At age fourteen, Bob Lee designed a unique telescopic sighting, called the Lee Mount and at age seventeen designed and manufactured a range of several ultra-high-velocity rifle cartridges. Lee was one of the first Americans to have a hunting concession in Africa (Lee Expeditions, Ltd.) and the first PH to open Portuguese Angola to foreign hunters. He was a conservationist long before it became fashionable. While living in Angola in 1960s, he was instrumental in obtaining government protection for lion, cheetah, black rhino and their habitats. He designed the first ecologically sound wildlife management program in Africa with the then Portuguese Provincial government (Angola) to counteract the decimation of the big-game population by over-hunting and poaching. The result: there was more game there when he left than when he arrived! This was a cause Mr. Lee championed around the world during his lifetime. In 1965, with the outbreak of the Angolan civil war, Lee returned to New York and founded Hunting World, a luggage, leather goods, outdoor clothing and sporting specialties company. His products were designed to his exacting specifications and mercilessly field- tested. He developed a nearly indestructible lightweight material called ""Battue"". Between 1980 and 1984, after six years of negotiations with the government of the People's Republic of China, Mr. Lee became the first Westerner to gain access to and lead three scientific expeditions into the rugged Tien Shan mountains and Chinese Pamirs - known as ""The Roof of the World"" - where he rediscovered the fabled Marco Polo sheep, Ovis ammon poli, on Chinese soil and documented their migration. He was successful in convincing the Xinjiang (Shin-jiang) Provincial government to institute protection for many of its wonderful species and his reports were responsible for the creation of the Tashgorgan Wildlife Reserve in the Pamirs. These expeditions and conservation achievements are memorialized in his 2nd book, China Safari (1988). Bob Lee was a Fellow of Exploration in The Explorers Club, a member of the Boone & Crockett Club founded by Theodore Roosevelt in 1887, a Life Member of the National Rifle Association, a member of the Visiting Committee of the Arms and Armor Department at the Metropolitan Museum of Art, a research associate in Mammalogy, Museum of Natural History, at the University of Kansas, and an Affiliate Professor of Management at The University of Montana, where he lectured graduate students on the problems involved in saving our ancient forests in the Pacific Northwest, clear-cutting and lack of regrowth in the Rocky Mountain states and the responsibilities of business and industry with respect to the environment. In 1988, Lee created an endowment for graduate studies in wildlife management at The University of Montana. His gift was the largest single donation ever received and resulted in three scientific expeditions to the Qinghai (Ching-Hy) Province of China, on the Tibetan Plateau, to study increased population management for wild yak and musk deer. In 1999, Lee was presented with the C.J. McElroy Award from Safari Club International for his contributions to hunting and conservation. The Robert M. Lee Foundation has awarded large sums to various conservation organizations. In 1991, he funded the endowment of the Robert M. Lee Gallery of American Arms at the Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York City. Mr. Lee was a collector of antique Colts, Winchesters, European Arms and Armor and Modern Sporting guns, selections of which are featured in his book series, The Art of the Gun (2002-2003) and Magnificent Colts (2011). An Exhibition of his many Collections was held at Sotheby's New York in June 2013. An avid car collector, Lee won the coveted ""Best of Show"" award at Pebble Beach Concours d'Elegance, the world's premier automobile competition, in 2006 and 2009; ""Best of Show"" at The Quail: A Motorsports Gathering, in 2006 and 2012; and ""Best of Show"" at Amelia Island Concours in 2014.

Kerbs and William Kallman Kerbs, brother of Edward A. Kerbs and Carlee Kerbs Walker, and loving husband of Hildegard Johnson Kerbs, all of whom predeceased him, John was a paradigmatic member of that greatest generation. Although he lost a leg and very nearly his life at the age of 15 in an accident at a camp in Vermont, John never complained and scarcely acknowledged that misfortune, quickly returning to his studies at The Lawrenceville School and Yale University. As a young adult, John was active in such adventurous pursuits as hunting, racing midget cars, and flying airplanes before embarking on a career as a stock broker, financial consultant, and businessman. His passion for electronics and technology, first developed when he worked with a team of Lawrenceville students rebuilding aircraft engines during WWII, was widely known among his family and friends.

2016-02-14T00:00:00Z,"SPENCER--Michael Jon, Founder and Executive Director of Hospital Audiences, Inc. (HAI) for over 40 years, passed away on November 30, 2015 in New York City at the age of 77 due to complications arising from pneumonia. He is survived by his daughter, Joanna Spencer; granddaughter Katherine ""Katie"" MacAaron; sister Caryle Wells; son-in-law David MacAaron; brother-in-law Arthur Wells; nephew Andrew Wells; many cousins; and numerous pets including dogs, cats, horses, goats and chickens. He was the son of Joseph and Ethel Spencer. Michael was born on Valentine's Day, 1938, in Brooklyn, NY. He spent his formative years in Los Angeles, CA, where he attended Fairfax High School, and became friends with schoolmate Phil Spector. Later, he became a sessions pianist as well as music contractor for Spector. His playing can be heard on the original classics ""Be My Baby"" and ""Pretty Little Angel Eyes."" In his youth he also studied classical piano with Serge Tarnowsky, who had been Vladimir Horowitz's teacher. As a teenager, he and another friend found Bela Lugosi listed in the telephone book, which began a friendship with the actor famed for portraying Dracula, that culminated in Michael being a pallbearer at Lugosi's funeral. Michael graduated Phi Beta Kappa from UCLA with a degree in Economics, then moved back to the East Coast to attend Harvard Law School. However, he chose to leave after three months to resume piano studies, at Mannes College of Music in New York City. Soon after, he married fellow Mannes student Ruth Albert. Over the next few years, Michael gave many weekly performances for patients in long term, chronic psychiatric hospitals around New York City. It was during this period that he attended a Ravi Shankar concert at a huge hall with only a handful of people in attendance. He realized that he could have filled the empty seats in the hall with very appreciative patients from the hospitals nearby where he performed regularly. He began requesting free, unused tickets, bringing his first busload of 200 patients to a Senior Musicians Orchestra concert in 1967. It was this event that shaped his destiny and Michael decided that he would dedicate his life to patients in hospitals, uplifting their lives and bringing them out of their grim existences. Working from his dining room table, he began his quest for funding, operating on a ""never take no for an answer"" and ""it's now or never"" approach. In 1969, Hospital Audiences Inc. (HAI) was incorporated. The organization grew, expanded and flourished over the years, reaching over 14 million people, in a wide variety of programs. In addition to serving the original hospital clientele, HAI consumers grew to include underserved populations such as residents in homeless shelters, at-risk youth, adults in rehab programs, frail elderly, the incarcerated, and the physically and mentally challenged. Decades ago, Michael described his work as bringing ""chicken soup to the soul."" Under his guidance, and by always thinking out of the box, exceptional things happened, such as transporting patients on gurneys to cultural events on the HAI buses which he helped design, or bringing wounded soldiers from Walter Reed Army Medical Center in Washington, DC to NYC for a weekend of cultural and special events. He was the recipient of many awards, among them an Honorary Doctorate from Hobart-William Smith College, and numerous awards from the City and State of New York. Michael was a passionate musician, playing his Bechstein piano for hours daily, and choosing to celebrate his 75th birthday in Slovakia with his daughter Joanna, playing the Rachmaninoff Piano Concerto #"

Leonard was an economist with a career in bank regulation with the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, New York State Banking Department, The Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, The National Credit Union Administration, and the US Treasury. He was President of the Depositors Insurance Fund, a private fund insuring deposits of savings banks in Massachusetts from 1981-1994. He was a graduate of CCNY (1951) and earned a Ph.D. at New York University (1975). He served in Korea as a sergeant in the Army for a year during the war. He had a restless intelligence, an intense affect, a sharp wit, and a laugh that filled the room. He had many friends whom he cherished and some enemies of whom he was singularly proud. He fell in love with Jackie 20 minutes after meeting her and never stopped loving her for their 35 years of marriage; he asks her forgiveness for being easier to love than to live with. A private remembrance will be held at a later date. If he wanted you there, you will receive an invitation for good food, good wine, a few laughs, and a few tears.

2016-02-17T00:00:00Z,"VAN MUNCHING--Leo, Jr.,retired beer-importing executive and longtime Darien, CT resident, died after a long illness. He was 89. Born in 1926 in Rotterdam, the Netherlands, Leo and his family immigrated to the United States in 1933. His father, the late Leo van Munching of Greenwich, came as a representative of the Heineken brewery, eventually establishing Van Munching & Company as the exclusive US importer of Heineken brands. Drafted into the United States Navy while in high school, Leo served as a Seabee in the 35th Special Naval Construction Battalion on Oahu, Hawaii from 1944 to 1946. Upon discharge, he enrolled in the University of Maryland on the G.I. Bill, receiving a degree from the College of Business and Management in 1950. After graduation, he went to work for the family business, eventually becoming president of Van Munching & Company, a role he remained in until his retirement in 1993. During his time with Van Munching & Company, no other brand approached Heineken's position as the largest-selling imported beer. In recognition of his outstanding contributions and personal dedication to US-Netherlands trade relations, and his promotion of goodwill for the Netherlands in the United States, Queen Beatrix honored Leo with The Order of Orange-Nassau in 1982. Six years later, the Netherlands Chamber of Commerce in the United States also recognized his role in the expansion of trade between the two countries, presenting him with the George Washington Vanderbilt Award. Leo's efforts as a philanthropist, often anonymous, were made out of appreciation for the opportunities he and his family enjoyed in America. In 1983, he supported the restoration of the Statue of Liberty in memory of his mother, Mia. He donated Van Munching Hall, dedicated in 1992, to house the University of Maryland School of Business, in part to thank the university for its kind treatment of the veterans of World War II. Leo's fervent commitment to supporting education led him to a long-standing relationship with Kolbe Cathedral High School in Bridgeport. His support of that school, both as a benefactor and member of the Advisory Board, prompted the Diocese of Bridgeport to honor him with the Order of St. Augustine Medal of Service in 2012. Leo also established the Van Munching Rehabilitation Unit at Stamford Hospital, was a leadership donor to the construction of the new Darien Library, which opened in 2009, and was a founding donor to the Margaret M. Dyson Vision Research Institute at New York Hospital-Cornell Medical Center. He was an active supporter of several Darien-based charities, and a member of the Wee Burn Country Club. Leo is survived by his wife of 62 years, Peggy, and their eight children: Leo, III (Laura) of San Francisco, CA, Jan Phillips (Charles) of Bonita Springs, FL, Pieter of Darien, Paul (Heather) of Bath, England, Maria of Newport, RI, Anne Ardery (Peter) of Darien, Philip (Christina) of Darien, and Christopher (Kimberly) of Darien. He is also survived by thirteen grandchildren, Kyle, Charlie, Brennan, Annebet, Max, Anneka, Lily, Mia, Megan, William, Anna, Maggie, and Leo, IV, and two great-grandchildren, River and Rory. In addition, he is survived by his sister, Anne Wilsey, of Greenwich. A funeral Mass will be celebrated at St. Thomas More Church in Darien, CT on February 20th at 10:30am.

In the spring of 1943 his botany studies at Cornell were interrupted when he enlisted in the Army as part of the Fighting 69th Regiment of New York State. On April 19, 1945, he helped liberate the Leipzig-Thekla Concentration Camp. On April 25, 1945, he was a part of the historic meeting of the American and Russian ground troops at the River Elbe in Germany. In 1946 he returned to Cornell and transferred to Bauhaus-based Institute of Design in Chicago where he graduated in 1952. In 1954 he and a friend from Cornell, Bill Wainwright, founded Geodesics with Bucky Fuller as honorary president. In 1957 he began building the first residential geodesic dome ever built. He designed a pattern of diamonds and triangles for the dome floor that was an undiscovered tessilation later known as Penrose tiles after a later discovery by Roger Penrose. Bernie enjoyed success as a sculptor and professor of sculpture, receiving a Guggenheim Fellowship and two National Endowment for the Arts Fellowships. He had dozens of exhibitions of his work in the United States, Sweden, Belgium and Finland. Bernie is survived by his beloved wife, Susan Weil Kirschenbaum, his two children, Christopher Rauschenberg and Sara Kirschenbaum; daughter-in-law Janet Stein; two grandchildren, Sage Bedell and Flint Kirschenbaum; his sister, Frances Brandt, and her husband, children, and grandchildren, all of whom loved and esteemed him. The family would like to thank Isaac Amponsah for his excellent care of Bernie.

Schorr, 94, who served as General Director of CSS from 1973 to 1977, and received many awards and honors over a distinguished career fighting poverty on many fronts. He died on February 13, in Charlotte, NC. Born in New York City in 1921, Mr. Schorr graduated from City College of New York and Washington University in St. Louis where he received his Master's Degree in Social Work. After working for several years in social service agencies he began a career in policy. In 1963, he headed up analysis of poverty in the United States with a focus on the relationship of family and income development. Two years later he moved to the Office of Economic Opportunity where he did research, planning and allocation of government funds in the fight against poverty. By 1968, Schorr was a professor of social policy and director of the Center for Studies of Income Maintenance Policy at Brandeis University. He would later establish a similar center at New York University where he served as dean of the School of Social Work from 1970 to 1973. When he took over CSS in 1973, the anti-poverty organization was transitioning from an agency working primarily with disadvantaged families to one focused on aiding the poor in their own communities -- in housing projects, schools, community centers and neighborhoods. Among the many awards Schorr received was the Distinguished Service Award (1966), the Distinguished Alumnus Citation (1970) from Washington University's George Warren Brown School of Social Work, the Michael Schwerner award for civil rights leadership (1972), and an Honorary Doctor of Humane Letters from Adelphi University (1975).

Mr. Michael Jaharis, entrepreneur, philanthropist, and humanitarian community passed away peacefully on February 17, 2016 in his home with his family by his side. Born and raised in Evanston, Illinois, Michael was the son of Greek immigrants, Michael and Katerina Jaharis, from the island of Lesvos. Shortly after his college graduation from Carroll University in June 1950, Michael was called to serve in the US Army during the Korean War and was deployed to help run the medical and pharmaceutical supply in Austria. After his service, Michael joined Miles Laboratories as a Sales Representative in the Ethical Drug Division (Prescription Drug), and earned his JD as a night student at DePaul University. Michael rose through the ranks at Miles to be appointed Vice President and Executive Legal Counsel for Food and Drug Law, where he also became involved in marketing for the company. In 1972, Michael became president and CEO of Key Pharmaceuticals, where he led his team to develop pharmaceutical breakthroughs such as sustained-release Theo-Dur, which became the nation's best selling asthma remedy, and Nitro-Dur, the first transdermal sustained-release product to release nitroglycerin through the skin. In 1988, Michael founded Kos Pharmaceuticals, where he led his team to pioneer innovative drug therapies to treat cardiovascular disease; the first product Niaspan, which raised HDL levels and improved the lives of millions of people. After selling Kos, he co-founded Vatera Healthcare Partners LLC, a New York City-based investment group focused on taking active positions in healthcare companies that develop innovative products for unmet and underserved medical needs in a broad range of therapeutic areas. In 1986, Michael and Mary founded the Jaharis Family Foundation, Inc. He was member of several non-profit and education boards: Trustee Emeritus of Tufts University, Chairman of the Board of Overseers for Tufts School of Medicine, Columbia University Medical Center Board of Visitors, and Member of the Board of Overseers of the Weill Cornell Medical College and Graduate School of Medical Sciences. He and his wife were Benefactors of the Metropolitan Museum of Art, the Art Institute of Chicago, and the Metropolitan Opera. They were Scholarship Sponsors of DePaul University College of Law in Chicago and developed the Mary and Michael Jaharis Center for Health Law at DePaul University. At Tufts University School of Medicine, they endowed the Jaharis Family Center for Biomedical and Nutrition Sciences, the Jaharis Family Chair in Family Medicine, and multiple Scholarship Funds. Through The Jaharis Family Foundation, he was also a Benefactor of Columbia University Medical College and Weill Cornell Medical College. He received an Honorary Doctor of Public Service degree from Tufts and Crown Award from Columbia University Medical. Proud of his Greek ancestry and Greek Orthodox faith, Michael served as Vice Chairman of the Greek Orthodox Archdiocesan Council, Founding Member of Faith Endowment for Orthodoxy and Hellenism and Founding Member and Executive Committee Member of Leadership 100. The Greek Orthodox Archdiocese of America made Michael an ""Archon Exarchos of the Order of St. Andrew the Apostle,"" one of the highest honors bestowed upon laity on behalf of His All Holiness, Ecumenical Patriarch Bartholomew. Most recently, Michael and Mary directed their philanthropic efforts to supporting humanitarian initiatives to provide food, medical care and education to children and elderly living in Greece during the ongoing financial crisis and to support the refugee families fleeing to Greece. Michael Jaharis was a model of how to offer time, energy and intelligence in pursuit of a better world. He is survived by his wife Mary (nee Spyros), children Steven and Kathryn, and grandchildren Melina, Michael, Valerie, Wilder, and Ava, as well as by the millions of people whose lives he has positively impacted. Visitation hours and a funeral service will be held at the Archdiocesan Greek Orthodox Cathedral of the Holy Trinity at 337 East 74th Street, New York City. Visitation hours will be on Friday, February 19, 5:00pm - 9:30pm; the funeral service will take place on Saturday, February 20th at 11:00am. The family has requested that in lieu of flowers, donations be made to the Rebuilding of St. Nicholas Greek Orthodox Church or the Cancer Programs at Columbia University Medical Center. 1/3"

2016-02-21T00:00:00Z,"KURZWEIL--Edith. 1924 - 2016, a Viennese-born scholar, who served as the final editor of Partisan Review, died February 6, four days after suffering a stroke. She was 91. Born into a family of privilege, her adolescence was marked by hardship that faced all Jews living in Austria after the Anschluss. As a twelve-year-old she witnessed the devastation of Kristallnacht first hand before undertaking a two-year odyssey through war-torn Europe. Separated from her parents, she was compelled to shepherd her younger brother John through Belgium, France, Spain and Portugal - often surviving for days at a time on little more than bread and bananas - before securing passage on the New York-bound S.S. Excalibur in 1940. Newly arrived in the United States, she worked as a milliner, tailor's apprentice, and diamond cutter by day, and attended high school at night. Her scholarly life - as an expert on, among other things, psychoanalysis and French Structuralism - only began after the untimely death of her second husband, Robert Kurzweil, in 1966. That was when she returned to school, eventually earning a Ph.D. in sociology from the New School for Social Research, where she would later serve on its Board of Governors. In 1973, she met, worked with, and eventually married, William Phillips, one of the two founding editors of Partisan Review. The National Endowment of the Humanities honored Kurzweil with its highest award, the National Humanities Medal, in 2003. Professor Kurzweil is survived by her three children Ronald Schmidt, Vivien Schmidt, and Allen Kurzweil, two stepsons, Peter and Leonard Kurzweil, her brother John Weiss, and a cherished grandson, Maximilian Kurzweil. 1/3"

We mourn the sudden passing of Jean Gazarian on January 18, 2016, an international civil servant who, working under every Secretary-General of the United Nations, spent over six decades dedicated to world peace. A mentor to so many, a true humanitarian, a gentle and kind man, he was highly respected for his integrity and generosity, and inspired love and affection to all those who met him. As a former director at Drew University expressed: ""When he talked, everyone listened."" Jean Gazarian joined the United Nations in 1946, when he was 24. He served first as a translator, then as an editor and, in 1959, was called to work in the Executive Office of the Secretary-General to deal with General Assembly affairs. In 1966, he became Director of the Division of the General Assembly Affairs, a position he held for 18 years. A witness to many world events, he met kings and queens, and presidents, but always remained humble. Ambassador Ahmad Kamal, Senior Fellow at the United Nations Institute for Training and Research (UNITAR), told the UN News Centre: ""He was absolutely unique as a person. His knowledge, his devotion to the UN and the manner in which he inspired love and affection among thousands of UN diplomats and staff members made him a prince among men."" While working for the General Assembly, he traveled extensively as secretary and coordinator of conferences, held in Geneva, Oslo, Vienna, Paris, Rio de Janeiro, Managua, Jakarta, Guatemala, etc. He also assisted Secretary- General U Thant during his official visit in 1970 to eleven Francophone African countries, where he served as his interpreter. From 1983 to 1985, Jean was Principal Advisor to the Under-Secretary-General for General Assembly Affairs and to the President of the General Assembly. From 1985 to 1986, he was Director of the Office for the Commemoration of the Fortieth Anniversary of the United Nations. In 1986, he was Secretary of the High Level Intergovernmental Group of Experts regarding the administrative and financial functioning of the United Nations. In 1987, Jean Gazarian became a Senior Fellow of the United Nations Institute for Training and Research (UNITAR), where he taught for 25 years a large number of diplomats through training programs and seminars. He was one of the pioneers of Model UN, spoke to large assemblies of students from all over the world, and was an instrumental figure of the ""UN Semester"" co-organized by Drew University. Jean Gazarian was recognized by governments and universities for his outstanding contribution to the United Nations and world peace: Officier de l'Ordre de La Pleiade, Organisation internationale de la Francophonie (1977). Chevalier de l'Ordre de la Legion d'honneur, France (1984). Grand Officier de l'Ordre de Vasco Nunez de Balboa, Panama (1984). Doctor of Letters, Old Dominion University, Norfolk, Virginia (1986). Doctor of Laws, Bentley College, Waltham, Massachusetts (1996). Doctor en Administration de la Paix, Cercle de Reflexion des Nations (2004). Doctor of Humane Letters, Drew University, Madison, New Jersey (2007).

Baroness Mary de Gunzburg died surrounded by her three loving children in her home in Miami Beach. She was 89. Mary was born in Memphis, Tennessee to Otis A. and Lucy Ward McFall, where she was raised with her beloved sister Beverly. She attended the Lausanne Collegiate School and Southwestern College. As a child, Mary discovered and nurtured what would become her lifelong passion for art; she studied and excelled at ballet and spent countless hours drawing and reading. Mary pursued her love for the fine arts in New York. She studied at the Art Students League, where she took classes to develop her craft as an impressionist painter. Mary was a proud New Yorker and found a second home at the Metropolitan Museum of Art, of which she was a patron. She could often be found in the impressionist wing studying and copying masterpieces, working at her easel, color-rich oils bringing her canvases to life. She loved color, and it was this love that engendered in her an admiration and a fondness for the works of her favorite artists, Bonnard and Titian, from whom she drew much inspiration. She was happily married, for over forty years, to Baron Guy de Gunzburg. They shared passions for learning, world travel, reading, and collecting art and antiques. Together they lived in New York, Virginia, and South Florida and traveled extensively in Europe. Mary and Guy were generous benefactors of Baptist Health South Florida in Miami, making possible the creation of the Center for Excellence in Nursing. They also gave generously to the Mayo Clinic in Rochester, Minnesota. Mary was ever elegant, ever beautiful - whether dressed up in evening gown, or down in a Seurat-spattered smock. And her youthful energy and playful humor never faded. She danced until the final curtain - quite literally. Even in the last year, in bed, she would often kick up a leg to showcase the flexibility she had maintained from her ballet-days! Mary is survived by her three children from her first marriage to William E. Buxton: Robert Malcolm Buxton, Lucy Buxton Geppert, and Mary Martin Buxton; her stepchildren, Baron Jean-Louis de Gunzburg, Madame Eliane de Gunzburg Beckman, and Baron Gerard de Gunzburg; and her grandchildren, Jesse, Hannah, Nicky, Henry, and Will. In addition to her sister Beverly, Mary had four lifelong friends who were always there for her and with whom she shared many cherished memories: Imogene Erb, Nancy McFadden Copp, Emily Haizlip, and Lucy Barboro Fisher. Mary would want to express her thanks and gratitude to Alexy Turcios and Thelma Scott for all their years of hard work, for their friendship, and their devotion. Mary was preceded in death by her parents, her sisters Cynthia and Beverly, and her husband Guy.

Lakes, NJ, graduating from Mt. Lakes High School in 1945 and from Hood College in 1949, with a BA in music. She always wanted to live in the city, and moved to Manhattan after college to begin a long and varied career in the radio and television industries. She worked for the Arthur Godfrey Show on CBS-TV, wrote for NBC TV's The Home Show and worked with Dave Garroway on NBC TV's The Today Show, where she was a ""Today Girl"" feature panelist (1960-61). She received three Emmy Award nominations (1980-82), and won an Emmy in 1980, for producing ""Ask NBC News, with John Chancellor."" She wrote for NBC TV's broadcasts of The Macy's Thanksgiving Parade (1987-89), for NBC's MONITOR Radio, and for Edwin Newman; imagine the challenge of writing for the author of ""Strictly Speaking!"" She worked for NBC News at many Democratic National Conventions, including 1968 in Chicago. She produced ""The Women's Program"" series for the NBC Radio Network, which received a commendation from American Women in Radio and Television in 1979. Beryl also wrote and produced NBC-TV's ""The All- New Pink Panther Show"" (1971-74), which featured those famous cartoons and live-action segments with The Ritts Puppets and comedian Lenny Schultz reading letters and jokes from viewers. She produced medical and health stories for the NBC flagship TV station in New York City. She was the author of ""Poor Woman's Almanac"", humorous and pithy quips published in Ladies Home Journal. She received the Distinguished Alumni Award from Hood College, where she sponsored scholarships in writing and theater arts. Beryl was also an avid athlete and enjoyed playing tennis. She took up running and unexpectedly won prizes in the upper age groups of Jersey Shore 5 K's for many years, which tickled her to no end. She was proud to have completed a New York City marathon, and she loved the Midnight Run on New Year's Eve in Central Park, running her last race just last month. Beryl was generous, quietly helping many people. Terence Cardinal Cooke Healthcare Center awarded her the Mary P. Clark award for exceptional care and volunteer work for the Huntington's Disease unit of the hospital. She is survived by her sister, Joan Pfizer Sussmann, her four nieces and nephews, and five grand nieces and grand nephews. The family will hold a private memorial. In lieu of flowers, please honor Beryl by donating to your favorite charity. 1/3"

2016-02-22T00:00:00Z,"GAZARIAN--Jean Bernard. We mourn the sudden passing of Jean Gazarian on January 18, 2016, an international civil servant who, working under every Secretary-General of the United Nations, spent over six decades dedicated to world peace. A mentor to so many, a true humanitarian, a gentle and kind man, he was highly respected for his integrity and generosity, and inspired love and affection to all those who met him. As a former director at Drew University expressed: ""When he talked, everyone listened."" Jean Gazarian joined the United Nations in 1946, when he was 24. He served first as a translator, then as an editor and, in 1959, was called to work in the Executive Office of the Secretary-General to deal with General Assembly affairs. In 1966, he became Director of the Division of the General Assembly Affairs, a position he held for 18 years. A witness to many world events, he met kings and queens, and presidents, but always remained humble. Ambassador Ahmad Kamal, Senior Fellow at the United Nations Institute for Training and Research (UNITAR), told the UN News Centre: ""He was absolutely unique as a person. His knowledge, his devotion to the UN and the manner in which he inspired love and affection among thousands of UN diplomats and staff members made him a prince among men."" While working for the General Assembly, he traveled extensively as secretary and coordinator of conferences, held in Geneva, Oslo, Vienna, Paris, Rio de Janeiro, Managua, Jakarta, Guatemala, etc. He also assisted Secretary- General U Thant during his official visit in 1970 to eleven Francophone African countries, where he served as his interpreter. From 1983 to 1985, Jean was Principal Advisor to the Under-Secretary-General for General Assembly Affairs and to the President of the General Assembly. From 1985 to 1986, he was Director of the Office for the Commemoration of the Fortieth Anniversary of the United Nations. In 1986, he was Secretary of the High Level Intergovernmental Group of Experts regarding the administrative and financial functioning of the United Nations. In 1987, Jean Gazarian became a Senior Fellow of the United Nations Institute for Training and Research (UNITAR), where he taught for 25 years a large number of diplomats through training programs and seminars. He was one of the pioneers of Model UN, spoke to large assemblies of students from all over the world, and was an instrumental figure of the ""UN Semester"" co-organized by Drew University. Jean Gazarian was recognized by governments and universities for his outstanding contribution to the United Nations and world peace: Officier de l'Ordre de La Pleiade, Organisation internationale de la Francophonie (1977). Chevalier de l'Ordre de la Legion d'honneur, France (1984). Grand Officier de l'Ordre de Vasco Nunez de Balboa, Panama (1984). Doctor of Letters, Old Dominion University, Norfolk, Virginia (1986). Doctor of Laws, Bentley College, Waltham, Massachusetts (1996). Doctor en Administration de la Paix, Cercle de Reflexion des Nations (2004). Doctor of Humane Letters, Drew University, Madison, New Jersey (2007). On December 4, 2013, Ban Ki-moon, the Secretary-General of the United Nations, honored Jean Gazarian during the 50th anniversary of UNITAR. Jean Gazarian is survived by his brother, Pierre Gazarian, columnist for The Suffolk Times, and his sister, Marie- Lise Gazarian, Director of the Graduate Program in Spanish, St. John's University, and the Mirimanoff family, from Geneva, Switzerland. A Prayer Service, at the Church of the Holy Family, United Nations Parish, was held on Friday, January 29, where friends, colleagues and family paid tribute to Jean Gazarian. 1/3"

He was the Managing Director of The Netherlands Chamber of Commerce in the U.S., was a consummate networker, and hired many Dutch interns which was the start of his history of helping and mentoring young people. At age 26, he lost both legs in a car accident. Kersen was soon walking again with two artificial legs. He dedicated his entire life to not being handicapped. He became an outspoken defender of equality and social justice for the handicapped, underserved, and the underrepresented. Kersen was dedicated to creating educational and cultural opportunities for young people. His passion for music led to his association with the Boys Choir of Harlem often funding their high school and college education. He started a new foundation called The Netherlands American Community Trust. Many have gone on to become successful opera singers, playwrights, and entertainers. He was a member of the Board of Governors for the Roosevelt Institute and The Four Freedoms, a member and judge of the United Nations Franklin D. Roosevelt International Disability Rights Award Advisory Board, board member of A Leg to Stand On, instrumental in setting up the Chicago Boys Choir, and helped start the Choir Academy of Chicago. Queen Beatrix of The Netherlands considered his contributions to Dutch interests in the United States so valuable that she granted him a Knighthood in the Order of Orange-Nassau. Kersen will be remembered for his passion for living and most of all his generosity. He gave to many unconditionally. He believed he could make the world a better place. He will be fondly remembered for the lives he touched and the lasting impact he had on the communities he served. His life is living proof that you can change things in this world. He is survived by Phillip Perkins, his life-long partner of 37 years, and a brother, Martin De Jong. Donation in lieu of flowers to Shake-a-Leg, Miami.

2016-02-28T00:00:00Z,"ASTREDO--Humbert Allen Jr ""Bud"", passed into the universe on February 19, 2016. A consummate actor, story teller and entertainer, he honed his skills during the Korean War doing stand- up and entertaining the troops. He carried a weapon but always preferred bullets of laughter. Born in Pasadena, California on April 4, 1929, Bud grew up in San Francisco and Pasadena. His mother Bessie taught young Humbert to play the piano and this accomplishment made him the life of every party. As a teenager he loved souping up hot rods and burning rubber on the streets. His father Humbert Sr. infused his son with a passion for all the arts. Bud learned to sail a boat and to hunt and fish with his father on the Russian River and in the Sierra Nevadas. After the military, Humbert studied acting at the Pasadena Playhouse, worked in local theaters in Los Angeles and established a classical theater company, The Hollywood Center Theatre. In 1965 he loaded his possessions into his truck and drove to New York City, where he was immediately recognized as a very special talent and cast by Joe Papp for Shakespeare in the Park, which led to his big break playing Sergius in ""Arms and the Man"". Humbert was an early client and lifelong friend of agent Don Buchwald. He performed with James Earl Jones in ""Othello"", and became a fixture in off- broadway and regional theaters. He became wildly popular as a star of ""Dark Shadows"", the innovative gothic TV soap opera of the late 60's. Humbert toured nationally with both Frank Langella and Martin Landau in ""Dracula"". On Broadway he performed in Gore Vidal's ""An Evening with Richard Nixon"", Lorraine Hansberry's ""Les Blancs"" and the world tour of ""Little Foxes"" with Elizabeth Taylor. For 10 years he made his sailboat the ""Whimsey"" his home and later retired to a historical farm house in Guilford, Connecticut, where he continued to receive fan mail from followers of his career. Humbert is predeceased by his daughter Jennifer ""Jenny"" and survived by the Hanson Family and the Small Family. 1/3"

2016-02-28T00:00:00Z,"GRIMM--Robert Dean, Jr.,known as Dean, died suddenly in Lexington, Kentucky on 21 February at the age of 54 years and one month. He was born in Manhattan, New York, the son of Robert Dean Grimm Sr. and Virginia Kraft. His father and his only child Payson Dean Grimm preceded him in death. He leaves his mother Virginia Kraft Payson of Indiantown, Florida, Lexington, Kentucky and Saratoga Springs, New York, three sisters, Tana Aurland Bostian (Jeff) of East Hampton, Massachusetts, Tara Kraft Grimm of Paris, France and Jill Aurland of Vernon Hills, Illinois, a nephew and two nieces. Dean was raised at the Gipsy Trail Club near Carmel, New York. He spent his early years playing tennis, Trap Shooting, (Dean shot his first ""perfect round"" of trap at age eight using a 20-guage specially retooled shotgun), and downhill skiing at Grayrocks in the Laurentian Mountains of Quebec, Canada. Dean attended Frederick Military Academy in Portsmouth, Virginia, graduated from Salisbury Prepratory School in Salisbury, Connecticut and The University of Kentucky in Lexington, Kentucky, receiving a BA in Political Science. He was the co- breeder with his mother of 1992 Irish Derby winner St. Jovite, who was named after the town in the Laurentians where Dean learned to ski. St. Jovite, who posted the fastest Irish Derby time in 150 years, and was named 1992 European Horse of the Year, stood at stud initially at Dean's solely owned Payson Stud Management, LLC, before moving to Ireland where he stood the better part of his stud career. St. Jovite died earlier this year at age 27. Dean later bred and sold (in partnership with actor Woody Harrelson and Len Green), the highest priced thoroughbred weanling colt in North America, and the last stakes-winning son of Seattle Slew, Council Member, to go to stud. At the time of his death Dean was currently President of The Breeders Association (TBA), owner of the National Stud, LLC, owner of Payson Stud Management, LLC, former Director of Cardinal Bancshares, Vine Street Trust, and World Gaming, 1998 Philanthropist of the Year (National Philanthropic Association of America), Founding Member, co-owner Smoke Switchers.com, Rand Paul Victory Committee. Dean lost his only child, 20- year old Payson Dean Grimm in an auto accident on 15 February 2016. For the twenty years since his son's birth, Dean waged an unsuccessful legal battle with his son's mother, to whom he was never married, for visitation rights to his son. The death of his son put Dean in a state of depression much worse than any he had previously experienced. His many good friends and his loving family were unable to relieve his pain. Six days after his son's death, Dean joined him. May they live side-by- side in perpetual peace until the Lord raises them up to Eternal Glory. Catholic services were held at the Newman Center, University of Kentucky, on Wednesday 24 February with interment on Friday at Raymond Hill Cemetery in Carmel, New York. In lieu of flowers, expressions of sympathy in the name of Dean Grimm may be made to The Newman Center, 320 Rose Lane, Lexington, KY 40508. www.milward funeral.com 1/3"

2016-02-29T00:00:00Z,"ASTREDO--Humbert Allen Jr ""Bud"", passed into the universe on February 19, 2016. A consummate actor, story teller and entertainer, he honed his skills during the Korean War doing stand- up and entertaining the troops. He carried a weapon but always preferred bullets of laughter. Born in Pasadena, California on April 4, 1929, Bud grew up in San Francisco and Pasadena. His mother Bessie taught young Humbert to play the piano and this accomplishment made him the life of every party. As a teenager he loved souping up hot rods and burning rubber on the streets. His father Humbert Sr. infused his son with a passion for all the arts. Bud learned to sail a boat and to hunt and fish with his father on the Russian River and in the Sierra Nevadas. After the military, Humbert studied acting at the Pasadena Playhouse, worked in local theaters in Los Angeles and established a classical theater company, The Hollywood Center Theatre. In 1965 he loaded his possessions into his truck and drove to New York City, where he was immediately recognized as a very special talent and cast by Joe Papp for Shakespeare in the Park, which led to his big break playing Sergius in ""Arms and the Man"". Humbert was an early client and lifelong friend of agent Don Buchwald. He performed with James Earl Jones in ""Othello"", and became a fixture in off- broadway and regional theaters. He became wildly popular as a star of ""Dark Shadows"", the innovative gothic TV soap opera of the late 60's. Humbert toured nationally with both Frank Langella and Martin Landau in ""Dracula"". On Broadway he performed in Gore Vidal's ""An Evening with Richard Nixon"", Lorraine Hansberry's ""Les Blancs"" and the world tour of ""Little Foxes"" with Elizabeth Taylor. For 10 years he made his sailboat the ""Whimsey"" his home and later retired to a historical farm house in Guilford, Connecticut, where he continued to receive fan mail from followers of his career. Humbert is predeceased by his daughter Jennifer ""Jenny"" and survived by the Hanson Family and the Small Family. 1/3"

As a girl, Ms. Delany loved visiting his corner office in the Chrysler building to see the gargoyles outside his window. Her mother Helen, nee Graves, was also an interior designer. The Welles family history in America dates back to Thomas Welles who was the first Treasurer of the Colony of Connecticut in 1639 and subsequently the 17th and 20th Governor of the Colony of Connecticut. Another distinguished descendant, Gideon Welles, served as United States Secretary of the Navy under Presidents Abraham Lincoln and Andrew Johnson from 1861 to 1869. Ms. Delany was an avid sailor and grew up on boats on Long Island Sound. She sailed the entire eastern seaboard between Maine and the Caribbean. Her artistic accomplishments included cuisine, art and design. Many homes in Connecticut and New York bear her bold mix of playful color and humor. She is still remembered for the odalisque painting over the bar in Fat Tuesday restaurant in New Canaan, CT. After graduating Goucher College with a BA in fine arts, Ms. Delany moved to Manhattan where she worked as a designer at Norcross Greeting Cards. She was known for her sense of adventure and a distinguishing laugh. After marrying John J. Delany III, President of Coyne and Delany Company, the Connecticut suburbs and family beckoned. Following in her mother's tradition, she started Mary W. Delany Interiors and continued to work. Her daughter, Corey Delany who is also an interior designer, continues the family lineage. The eldest, Sean Delany is the Executive Director of Lawyers Alliance for New York. Her daughter Dana Delany is an actor. She was the proud mother-in-law of Barbara Finkelstein, and loving grandmother of Leah and William Delany. Ms. Delany's marriage ended in divorce.

2016-03-03T00:00:00Z,"HOLLISTER--Irene McLean, of Hanover, NH, died on February 22, 2016, at Kendal in Hanover, NH. She was born in Detroit, MI, on June 14, 1920, daughter of Leo and Alice Marie Bohn McLean, originally of New Jersey. She was predeceased by her brother Major Donald R. McLean, United States Army, who was killed in action in New Guinea in World War II. Irene Hollister graduated from the University of Toledo in 1943, with a bachelor's degree in Business Administration. After her move to New York City in the mid-1940s she worked as employment manager at Gimbels New York and Bonwit Teller. She also was employed at Richardson Bellows Henry and Co. where she worked on technical staff procurement for clients. In 1960 she was hired to establish the first permanent office for the not-for-profit Association for Computing Machinery, the world's largest educational and scientific society for computers founded in 1947. The mathematician Franz Alt, a founding member of the Association, noted that her implementation of sound business practices and quality management ""marked the beginning of professional administration for the Association for Computing Machinery."" During her 26-year tenure as ACM's Director of Membership and Corporate Relations, she oversaw the growth of membership from 8,000 to over 75,000. Working closely with ACM's Executive Committee and Council, and traveling widely in the United States and abroad, provided her with the opportunity to develop a working relationship with computer science leaders in government, education, and research during a period of rapid growth and innovation of the field. In addition to her professionalism, Irene Hollister had a talent for recognizing people of potential whom she supported with training and mentoring. This talent proved invaluable at the time of her retirement which made for a smooth transition. Irene Hollister married the author and artist Paul M. Hollister in 1951, whom she met at Carnegie Hall while she moonlighted as an usher; they were introduced by the author and music critic Louis Biancolli. Paul Hollister was teaching journalism at New York University at the time, and they were married for 53 years until his death in 2004. A noted art critic and author specializing in the history of glass, he wrote many articles for decorative arts publications, such as American Craft, the Corning Museum of Glass Journal of Glass Studies, The Magazine Antiques, and the international publication Neues Glas. His reviews of studio glass exhibitions which appeared in the New York Times during the 1970s and 1980s were especially of note. After Irene's retirement, Irene and Paul traveled extensively, combining sight-seeing with visits to private and public glass collections, where many curators graciously opened storage units to them for study. Irene and Paul Hollister donated their collection of modern Scottish paperweights to the Currier Museum of Art in Manchester, NH. In 2007 Irene established the Paul and Irene Hollister Endowed Lecture on Glass at the Bard Graduate Center in New York where much of Paul Hollister's library on glass is located. According to Forrest Proper of Joslin Hall Rare Books, this was ""probably the finest collection of books on glass in private hands in this country,"" and now forms the basis of BGC's glass library. She was also a major contributor to the Paul Hollister Archives at the Rakow Research Library, Corning Museum of Glass in Corning, NY, which includes an assemblage of his audio lectures and interviews with studio glass artists. Their extensive collection of vintage Kuna mola applique textiles from the San Blas Islands, Panama, was gifted by her to the Indianapolis Museum of Art in 2008. Her husband's watercolors of interiors of Beauport, the Sleeper-McCann House, a National Historic Landmark at Historic New England in Gloucester, MA, drawn in color when he was 16 years old from black and white photographs, have been gifted to the Beauport Museum. She also co-edited Paul Hollister's ""Collected Writings on Studio Glass"" with Associate Professor Catherine Whalen of Bard Graduate Center (work in progress). In addition, Irene Hollister was interested in and supported the AVA Gallery in Lebanon, NH; Craft Emergency Relief Fund (CERF+) in Montpelier, VT; Urban Glass in Brooklyn, NY; and the Upper Valley Haven in White River Jct., VT. Contributions in Irene Hollister's memory may be made to the Paul and Irene Hollister Endowed Lecture on Glass at Bard Graduate Center or to the Upper Valley Haven. 1/3"

A longtime resident of the Bronx, Audrey's wit and wonderful conversation and beautiful British accent will be missed by her friends and family. Audrey was married to Eric K. Frey for 40 years. When he died in 1999, her life continued, but her heart was broken. Born in British India, Audrey was a graduate of St. Theresa's in Calcutta, with honors, Senior Cambridge. She also attended the Calcutta Government School of Art. After WWII, Audrey moved from India to New York City, where she studied with the Art Students League. Audrey was a lifelong artist; her hand-drawn cards depicting flowers and animals delighted their recipients, and her cards and books made from dried plants and flowers are truly remarkable and treasured. She always made sure to depict her signature lady bug on her drawings, cards and letters. While working for McGraw Hill Publications Company, Audrey quickly rose to a management level. Hired in 1950, she traveled the world for her job and relished every adventure. Audrey spoke several languages and was one of the first women to hold advanced management positions. She was a trailblazer for those who followed. She became production manager of Coal Age in 1955, then was appointed as US Business Manager of International Management in 1966. In 1976, Audrey was named Director of US Publication Services for International Management. She became the Manager of Marketing Communications at McGraw Hill in 1985, shortly before her retirement. As an eager and capable volunteer, Audrey worked extensively with The New York Botanical Gardens and with Wave Hill, a public garden and nature center in the Bronx. She loved the natural beauty of flowers and plants and had so many plants in her apartment, she had a reputation as an amateur botanist with her very own at-home greenhouse.

Under President Reagan, Ralph served for seven years as Chairman of the USIA's Television Communications Board of Advisors and as a member of the President's International Youth Exchange Initiative. In 1988, he served as a Senior Fellow of the Freedom Forum at Columbia University. Ralph was a co-founder, immediate past Chairman and Chairman Emeritus of the National Academy of Cable Programming. He received the Academy's first ""Governor's Award,"" recognizing his contributions to the development of cable programming.

MacAvoy, Ph.D., Williams Brother Professor Emeritus of the Yale School of Management, passed peacefully surrounded by his family on February 24, 2016. Professor MacAvoy is survived by his spouse and best friend of more than sixty (60) years, Katherine Ann MacAvoy, daughter Libby, son Matthew, four adoring grandchildren, and brother Alan MacAvoy. Born in Haverhill, Massachusetts on April 21, 1933, Professor MacAvoy earned a B.A. from Bates College in 1955 and a Ph.D. in Economics from Yale University in 1960. He later went on to receive honorary doctorates from both Bates College and Sacred Heart University where he also served as a member of both universities' Boards of Trustees. Professor MacAvoy was elected as a member to the American Academy of Arts and Sciences, Elected Member in 1981. Professor MacAvoy taught at the University of Chicago, the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, and the Yale School of Management. He served as the Frederick William Beinecke Professor of Economics in the Yale University Department of Economics from 1981 through 1983 and was awarded the Wilbur Lucius Cross Medal in 1982 for distinguished achievements in scholarship, teaching, academic administration, and public service.

He returned to his beloved Yale University in 1992, serving as Dean of the School of Management and, subsequently, as Williams Brothers Professor of Management and Public Policy. In reporting Professor MacAvoy's passing, Yale School of Management professor, Sharon Oster, wrote, ""In his economics work and in his life outside of the academy, Paul was committed to the idea of public service and to the view that economic thinking and evidence could and should be used to improve society. Paul was demanding of his students and devoted to them, drawing several of them into his considerable research operation and following and helping their careers over many years."" During the course of his illustrious career, Professor MacAvoy served on President Gerald Ford's Council of Economic Advisors and as co-chairman of the President's Task Force on Regulatory Reform. He also served on the Boards of Directors of the Chase Manhattan Bank, the Alumax Corporation, AMAX Gold Incorporated, the American Cyanamid Corporation, the Lafarge Corporation, Colt Industries, and Combustion Engineering.

From his time as an undersized guard for the Haverhill High School Hillies football team, his service to his country on the Council of Economic Advisors, his stewardship of the William E. Simon School and the Yale School of Management, to his ultimate position as family patriarch and beloved grandfather, Paul always ""gave it his best"" and encouraged those around him to do the same. A wise, kind and gentle man, Professor MacAvoy's wit, wisdom, kindness and generosity will be sadly missed. A private celebration of his life will be held in Woodstock, Vermont in June. 1/3"

Jim Dixon, a Harvard-educated physician and President of Antioch College from 1959 through 1975, died at his home in Haverford, Pennsylvania on February 27, 2016 at the age of 98. Born March 15, 1917 in Lebanon, ME, Jim was the second child of Mary Russell and James P. Dixon Jr. He attended Antioch College from 1934 to 1939 where he met Edla (Eddie) Denton Mills. They were married at the Mills Family Homestead near Middletown New York on August 30, 1941 and their devoted partnership spanned 54 years until Eddie's death at age 76 on December 17, 1995. Jim was one of the first students at Harvard Medical School on academic scholarship and received his medical degree in 1943. A life-long pacifist, Jim registered as a conscientious objector during WWII. He completed his alternative military service with the National Institutes of Health. Jim earned a Master's in Public Health Administration degree from Columbia University in 1947. After being a Kellogg Foundation fellow in Public Health and Preventive Medicine, he was a fellow in Community Medicine through the Rockefeller Foundation. Jim was drawn to the challenges and opportunities in the emerging field of public health. He first served the City and County of Denver, CO as Manager of Health and Hospitals from 1948-1952. Jim went on to become the Commissioner of Health for the City and County of Philadelphia, PA from 1952-1959. Throughout his professional career, Jim participated in many national and international policy discussions regarding public health issues. While serving on the Board of Trustees at Antioch, Jim was asked to consider and then accepted the role of President of the College. He led Antioch for sixteen years, including the dynamic 1960's. As a lifelong champion of civil rights, Jim was especially pleased to bring Martin Luther King, Jr. to campus as the 1965 college commencement speaker. Those interested in an expanded view of the years at Antioch are referred to the book: Antioch: The Dixon Era 1959-1975, compiled and edited by Edla M. Dixon.

2016-03-08T00:00:00Z,"DOUNDOULAKIS--Helias ""Louis"", a spy for the Office of Strategic Services during World War II and the designer of the suspension system for the largest radio telescope in the world, died on February 29, 2016, in Freeport, NY. He was 92. Doundoulakis was born July 12, 1923, in Canton, Ohio, to Greek immigrant parents, grew up in Crete, Greece, and returned to America in 1945 after serving in the United States Army and the OSS. When his maternal grandmother became blind, the family packed and moved to Greece to care for her. Mr. Doundoulakis was still in high school when Axis forces invaded Crete in 1941. Nevertheless, he joined the Cretan resistance movement and worked directly under English Intelligence with the legendary saboteur and author Patrick Leigh Fermor. His friendship with Leigh Fermor would serve as a catalyst for his future role in the OSS. Eventually, Doundoulakis fled, hiding in the Cretan mountains for a month. He finally escaped to Egypt on a torpedo boat provided by Leigh Fermor. Billeted in the Special Operations Executives' lavish villa in Cairo, he was trained as a saboteur and then enlisted in the American Army. He was transferred to the OSS and was assigned to the SI, ""Special Intelligence"" section. Doundoulakis was trained for six months in the OSS' 'Spy School'. After completion of his training, and armed with only a .32 cal. pistol and 150 gold sovereigns in a nylon belt, he set up a phony business which he used to send messages to Cairo by a wireless radio he smuggled into Greece, hidden in a can of olive oil. He was the only American spy in Salonica from March to December 1944, sending over 400 encrypted messages. With his wireless radio in plain view, he sent these messages from a blown-out textile factory once owned by prominent Greek Jews and had resolved to take a cyanide capsule to end his life if caught. One such message brought a squadron of American B-25's to that city, destroying a trainload of troops scheduled to leave. On another occasion, the Germans leaked intelligence intending to trap him by triangulating his position but escaped. Continuously hunted by the Germans, he fabricated stories and remained cool-headed, fooling the Germans and even the Greeks. After the war, he married Rita Gianoplus and settled in Brooklyn's Borough Park neighborhood, eventually moving to Baldwin, Long Island. Helias became a prominent civil engineer and was employed at Grumman Aerospace Corporation for over 30 years. He worked on the Apollo Space missions, the F-14 fighter jet as well as the Space Shuttle. He was awarded a plaque by Captain James Lovell of the ill-fated Apollo 13 mission in recognition and 'Thanks' for his work on the oxygen tanks of the Lunar Module, which saved their lives. His crowning achievement was his unique patent for the largest radio telescope in the world, designed along with his brother George and constructed in Arecibo, Puerto Rico, at the NAIC Observatory. William J. Casey, CIA director under President Reagan, is an assignee of this patent. Mr. Doundoulakis was a gifted writer, artist, and musician. He loved the opera and accordion music, and his hobbies included tango and ballroom dancing. He was known to paint on canvas anyone whom he met, and his love for photography and relentless ambition to record everything around him was known throughout Long Island. ""I Was Trained to be a Spy"" books I and II, ""Trained to be an OSS Spy,"" and ""My Unique Lifetime Association with Patrick Leigh Fermor"" are Doundoulakis' books chronicling the war years. He is survived by his wife of 63 years, Rita, four children: James (Maro), Stephen (Elenne), Plato (Kristin), and Thomas; and ten grandchildren: Noelle (William), Elias, Tabitha, Justin, Sirena, Thalia, James, Zoe, Brienne, and Aurora. His love and commitment to his wife, family, and friends was unconditional. Mr. Doundoulakis was interred on Friday at Greenfield Cemetery in Uniondale, NY.

2016-03-08T00:00:00Z,"McGOWAN--Joseph J. Jr. Joseph J. ""Jay"" McGowan Jr., visionary president of Bellarmine University in Louisville, KY, died suddenly and peacefully at his home on Tuesday of a pulmonary embolism. He was 71. His tenacious pursuit of academic excellence and sustainable growth at Bellarmine developed for Louisville a preeminent private university that serves the public interest and has gained national renown. His personal grace, compassion and lightning-fast wit brought energy and light to all who met him. When Dr. McGowan assumed the leadership of then- Bellarmine College in 1990, the school was a largely commuter liberal-arts college with 15 mostly yellow-brick buildings and 2,500 students. Today Bellarmine is a distinguished, bustling university with 46 buildings and it attracts 4,000 students from all over the world to its stunning Italianate campus and its curriculum steeped in the Catholic tradition of academic excellence and ethical awareness. Dr. McGowan was the third and longest-serving president of Bellarmine, which was founded in 1950. ""Jay McGowan was a visionary leader who took Bellarmine from college to university, from a local learning institution to an international destination for innovation and knowledge,"" said Louisville Mayor Greg Fischer. Joseph J. McGowan Jr. was born to Joseph and Joan McGowan on Barksdale Air Force Base in Shreveport, LA, but moved with his parents to Scranton, PA as a child. He spoke about growing up in Scranton, where he played little league baseball with Vice President Joe Biden and once turned an unassisted triple play. He earned his bachelor's and master's degrees at the University of Notre Dame, and his doctorate in higher education from Columbia University. He later graduated from Harvard University's Institute for Educational Management. Before taking the reins at Bellarmine, President McGowan served for 21 years at Fordham University in New York City as vice president of student affairs and dean of students. ""The world of higher education has lost a giant in Dr. McGowan,"" said Joseph M. McShane, SJ, president of Fordham University. ""A man of great vision and integrity, his transformation of Bellarmine was nothing less than miraculous."" At Bellarmine, Dr. McGowan sought to instill a ""vision built on hope,"" which was the title of his 1990 inaugural address. His vision for Bellarmine included faculty development, intellectual and personal growth of students, a firm commitment to the liberal arts, new and renovated facilities and the intellectual and spiritual presence of Thomas Merton, whose spirit ""inspires the development of Bellarmine as the intellectual center of the region considering such issues as peace and justice, world religions and East-West and North-South dialogues."" The Thomas Merton Center at Bellarmine University, which is the official repository of Merton's artistic estate and archives more than 50,000 Merton-related materials, is a destination for international scholars. In 2005, Dr. McGowan launched Vision 2020, his plan for Bellarmine to become ""the premier independent Catholic university in the South, and thereby the leading private institution in the Commonwealth and region."" He envisioned growing Bellarmine into a nationally preeminent private university of significant size and stature. His vision gave birth to Bellarmine's first doctoral programs and graduate programs in fields like education and social change, analytics, physical therapy and digital media, as well as a reinvigorated liberal-arts undergraduate academic core. Dr. McGowan displayed a passion for architecture, remaking Bellarmine's hilly campus in the style of his beloved Tuscany (birthplace of school namesake St. Roberto Bellarmino). The Siena residential complex--widely acclaimed as one of the nation's most beautiful, Our Lady of the Woods Chapel and the new hilltop Centro are among the projects that routinely drop jaws of alumni and friends who visit after a time away. St. Robert's Gate at the school's entrance is emblematic of the University's culture of hospitality, welcoming new people and new ideas. A longtime virtuoso of student-life leadership at Fordham, Dr. McGowan recognized the need to invigorate the quality of residential life at Bellarmine, and he more than tripled the number of students living in residence on campus. Bellarmine was classified as ""primarily residential"" and has since added 24 intramural sports, as well as NCAA Division I men's lacrosse. The men's basketball team won the NCAA Division II National Championship in 2011. Throughout the stunning growth, President McGowan zealously safeguarded Bellarmine's values, integrity, small class sizes, independent Catholic ideals and respect for all people. Famous for his competitive spirit and ability to spot opportunities others overlooked, President McGowan will perhaps be missed most for his sense of humor. ""Jay was brilliant, charming, hilarious and always exciting to be around; the rare university president known for an Elvis impersonation,"" said US Representative John Yarmuth. The Reverend Theodore Martin Hesburgh, president of Notre Dame for 35 years, was a mentor to Dr. McGowan and wrote to him on the 20th anniversary of his presidency: ""Under your leadership, Bellarmine has thrived in every conceivable way,"" the Reverend Hesburgh wrote, ""and the Academy, the Church, and our Nation, are better and stronger because of your inspired vision."" Dr. McGowan is survived by his loving wife, Maureen McRaith McGowan, and their fraternal twin sons, Joseph and Matthew; their daughters-in-law Emma and Heidi; and five adoring grandchildren, Alessia, Sofia, Neve, Fiona, and Luke; his sister, Mary Hoban (William); his brother, Timothy (Theresa); his uncle, Thomas J. Rittenhouse, Jr. (Joyce); and a large extended family. 1/3"

2016-03-09T00:00:00Z,"McGOWAN--Joseph J. Jr. Joseph J. ""Jay"" McGowan Jr., visionary president of Bellarmine University in Louisville, KY, died suddenly and peacefully at his home on Tuesday of a pulmonary embolism. He was 71. His tenacious pursuit of academic excellence and sustainable growth at Bellarmine developed for Louisville a preeminent private university that serves the public interest and has gained national renown. His personal grace, compassion and lightning-fast wit brought energy and light to all who met him. When Dr. McGowan assumed the leadership of then- Bellarmine College in 1990, the school was a largely commuter liberal-arts college with 15 mostly yellow-brick buildings and 2,500 students. Today Bellarmine is a distinguished, bustling university with 46 buildings and it attracts 4,000 students from all over the world to its stunning Italianate campus and its curriculum steeped in the Catholic tradition of academic excellence and ethical awareness. Dr. McGowan was the third and longest-serving president of Bellarmine, which was founded in 1950. ""Jay McGowan was a visionary leader who took Bellarmine from college to university, from a local learning institution to an international destination for innovation and knowledge,"" said Louisville Mayor Greg Fischer. Joseph J. McGowan Jr. was born to Joseph and Joan McGowan on Barksdale Air Force Base in Shreveport, LA, but moved with his parents to Scranton, PA as a child. He spoke about growing up in Scranton, where he played little league baseball with Vice President Joe Biden and once turned an unassisted triple play. He earned his bachelor's and master's degrees at the University of Notre Dame, and his doctorate in higher education from Columbia University. He later graduated from Harvard University's Institute for Educational Management. Before taking the reins at Bellarmine, President McGowan served for 21 years at Fordham University in New York City as vice president of student affairs and dean of students. ""The world of higher education has lost a giant in Dr. McGowan,"" said Joseph M. McShane, SJ, president of Fordham University. ""A man of great vision and integrity, his transformation of Bellarmine was nothing less than miraculous."" At Bellarmine, Dr. McGowan sought to instill a ""vision built on hope,"" which was the title of his 1990 inaugural address. His vision for Bellarmine included faculty development, intellectual and personal growth of students, a firm commitment to the liberal arts, new and renovated facilities and the intellectual and spiritual presence of Thomas Merton, whose spirit ""inspires the development of Bellarmine as the intellectual center of the region considering such issues as peace and justice, world religions and East-West and North-South dialogues."" The Thomas Merton Center at Bellarmine University, which is the official repository of Merton's artistic estate and archives more than 50,000 Merton-related materials, is a destination for international scholars. In 2005, Dr. McGowan launched Vision 2020, his plan for Bellarmine to become ""the premier independent Catholic university in the South, and thereby the leading private institution in the Commonwealth and region."" He envisioned growing Bellarmine into a nationally preeminent private university of significant size and stature. His vision gave birth to Bellarmine's first doctoral programs and graduate programs in fields like education and social change, analytics, physical therapy and digital media, as well as a reinvigorated liberal-arts undergraduate academic core. Dr. McGowan displayed a passion for architecture, remaking Bellarmine's hilly campus in the style of his beloved Tuscany (birthplace of school namesake St. Roberto Bellarmino). The Siena residential complex--widely acclaimed as one of the nation's most beautiful, Our Lady of the Woods Chapel and the new hilltop Centro are among the projects that routinely drop jaws of alumni and friends who visit after a time away. St. Robert's Gate at the school's entrance is emblematic of the University's culture of hospitality, welcoming new people and new ideas. A longtime virtuoso of student-life leadership at Fordham, Dr. McGowan recognized the need to invigorate the quality of residential life at Bellarmine, and he more than tripled the number of students living in residence on campus. Bellarmine was classified as ""primarily residential"" and has since added 24 intramural sports, as well as NCAA Division I men's lacrosse. The men's basketball team won the NCAA Division II National Championship in 2011. Throughout the stunning growth, President McGowan zealously safeguarded Bellarmine's values, integrity, small class sizes, independent Catholic ideals and respect for all people. Famous for his competitive spirit and ability to spot opportunities others overlooked, President McGowan will perhaps be missed most for his sense of humor. ""Jay was brilliant, charming, hilarious and always exciting to be around; the rare university president known for an Elvis impersonation,"" said US Representative John Yarmuth. The Reverend Theodore Martin Hesburgh, president of Notre Dame for 35 years, was a mentor to Dr. McGowan and wrote to him on the 20th anniversary of his presidency: ""Under your leadership, Bellarmine has thrived in every conceivable way,"" the Reverend Hesburgh wrote, ""and the Academy, the Church, and our Nation, are better and stronger because of your inspired vision."" Dr. McGowan is survived by his loving wife, Maureen McRaith McGowan, and their fraternal twin sons, Joseph and Matthew; their daughters-in-law Emma and Heidi; and five adoring grandchildren, Alessia, Sofia, Neve, Fiona, and Luke; his sister, Mary Hoban (William); his brother, Timothy (Theresa); his uncle, Thomas J.

2016-03-09T00:00:00Z,"DOUNDOULAKIS--Helias ""Louis"", a spy for the Office of Strategic Services during World War II and the designer of the suspension system for the largest radio telescope in the world, died on February 29, 2016, in Freeport, NY. He was 92. Doundoulakis was born July 12, 1923, in Canton, Ohio, to Greek immigrant parents, grew up in Crete, Greece, and returned to America in 1945 after serving in the United States Army and the OSS. When his maternal grandmother became blind, the family packed and moved to Greece to care for her. Mr. Doundoulakis was still in high school when Axis forces invaded Crete in 1941. Nevertheless, he joined the Cretan resistance movement and worked directly under English Intelligence with the legendary saboteur and author Patrick Leigh Fermor. His friendship with Leigh Fermor would serve as a catalyst for his future role in the OSS. Eventually, Doundoulakis fled, hiding in the Cretan mountains for a month. He finally escaped to Egypt on a torpedo boat provided by Leigh Fermor. Billeted in the Special Operations Executives' lavish villa in Cairo, he was trained as a saboteur and then enlisted in the American Army. He was transferred to the OSS and was assigned to the SI, ""Special Intelligence"" section. Doundoulakis was trained for six months in the OSS' 'Spy School'. After completion of his training, and armed with only a .32 cal. pistol and 150 gold sovereigns in a nylon belt, he set up a phony business which he used to send messages to Cairo by a wireless radio he smuggled into Greece, hidden in a can of olive oil. He was the only American spy in Salonica from March to December 1944, sending over 400 encrypted messages. With his wireless radio in plain view, he sent these messages from a blown-out textile factory once owned by prominent Greek Jews and had resolved to take a cyanide capsule to end his life if caught. One such message brought a squadron of American B-25's to that city, destroying a trainload of troops scheduled to leave. On another occasion, the Germans leaked intelligence intending to trap him by triangulating his position but escaped. Continuously hunted by the Germans, he fabricated stories and remained cool-headed, fooling the Germans and even the Greeks. After the war, he married Rita Gianoplus and settled in Brooklyn's Borough Park neighborhood, eventually moving to Baldwin, Long Island. Helias became a prominent civil engineer and was employed at Grumman Aerospace Corporation for over 30 years. He worked on the Apollo Space missions, the F-14 fighter jet as well as the Space Shuttle. He was awarded a plaque by Captain James Lovell of the ill-fated Apollo 13 mission in recognition and 'Thanks' for his work on the oxygen tanks of the Lunar Module, which saved their lives. His crowning achievement was his unique patent for the largest radio telescope in the world, designed along with his brother George and constructed in Arecibo, Puerto Rico, at the NAIC Observatory. William J. Casey, CIA director under President Reagan, is an assignee of this patent. Mr. Doundoulakis was a gifted writer, artist, and musician. He loved the opera and accordion music, and his hobbies included tango and ballroom dancing. He was known to paint on canvas anyone whom he met, and his love for photography and relentless ambition to record everything around him was known throughout Long Island. ""I Was Trained to be a Spy"" books I and II, ""Trained to be an OSS Spy,"" and ""My Unique Lifetime Association with Patrick Leigh Fermor"" are Doundoulakis' books chronicling the war years. He is survived by his wife of 63 years, Rita, four children: James (Maro), Stephen (Elenne), Plato (Kristin), and Thomas; and ten grandchildren: Noelle (William), Elias, Tabitha, Justin, Sirena, Thalia, James, Zoe, Brienne, and Aurora. His love and commitment to his wife, family, and friends was unconditional. Mr. Doundoulakis was interred on Friday at Greenfield Cemetery in Uniondale, NY.
