The film is so sincere, blunt and awkward it resembles a 94-minute-long public service message about the dangers of drugs.

The only reason this team is competitive is Patrick Ewing."
1990-03-04T00:00:00Z,"LEAD: A listing of travel arrangements and hotel rates for Trinidad on Feb. 11 with an article about carnival misstated the availability of flights from New York to the island's capital, Port of Spain. There is indeed direct service - with stops but without a change of aircraft - on BWIA and Pan Am."
1990-03-04T00:00:00Z,"LEAD: In choosing a tour guide to crime and corruption in New Orleans, you want to know where the authors will send you for a good time.

1990-03-04T00:00:00Z,"LEAD: The Army's standard combat weapon, the M-16, in use since the Vietnam War, is still considered the finest extant assault rifle. Nonetheless, since 1982, when six weapons manufacturers were asked to develop new technologies, the Army has been seeking to improve on it. Four companies have produced prototypes - including the Steyr-Mannlicher from Austria (above) - that are now being tested at Fort Benning, Ga., and at Aberdeen Proving Ground,"
1990-03-04T00:00:00Z,"LEAD: At 2 A.M. today, Ilya I. Zaslavsky, political kingpin, was on the phone with his pollster.

1990-03-04T00:00:00Z,"LEAD: In fairy tales, love songs and most Hollywood movies, any boy-meets- girl story takes the long way around to proving the predictable; the neat trajectory of conventional romance always shows that Cinderella and the Prince, tomato and tomahto, Tracy and Hepburn were right for each other all along. But in real life, who hasn't been an idiot in love, defying the odds to find the wrong person at the least convenient time to create an emotional mess?"

Freese has penned an eloquent plea for a grade school Kulturkampf in ''Teachers Have No Chance to Give Their Best'' (Long Island Opinion, Jan. 21), and one which I heartily endorse. I was one of Mr. Freese's advanced 10th-grade English students five years ago, and I consider myself an antecedent to what he cites as a ''general diminishment in students'' over time."
1990-03-04T00:00:00Z,"LEAD: I am pleased that Walter McCarthy brought up the topic of social skills for the retarded. Interestingly, it is an area that does receive a great deal of emphasis in schools and agencies, while being an area that the public does not hear much about."
1990-03-04T00:00:00Z,"LEAD: It was with great interest that I read ''What the Retarded Need: Social Skills.'' Yes, concern, imagination and time are desperately needed attributes for our developmentally disabled population.

1990-03-04T00:00:00Z,"LEAD: PASTA VIOLA, a newcomer in Stony Brook, sounds like yet another strutter in Long Island's never-ending parade of Italian restaurants. But take a second look; it is not the same old tarantella. There isn't a Bolognese, Alfredo or carbonara in sight. Insted, fasten your seatbelts for the likes of violet linguine, an amalgam of pasta, sauteed red cabbage, prosciutto and olive oil splashed with balsamic vinegar."
1990-03-04T00:00:00Z,"LEAD: An explosion in the basement of a house in Cresskill, N.J., where the authorities found weapons and ammunition, killed an 83-year-old woman yesterday and injured her grandson and another family member."

1990-03-04T00:00:00Z,"LEAD: To the Editor If your section had less concern for corporations and more for their stockholders, ''Butlers and Crystal as Well as a View'' (Feb. 4) would have appeared on page 1 of The Times, and not on page 29 of your section. More important, the story would not have been about the ''bosses' '' uniformed butlers, crystal decanters, peeled oranges, Acapulco retreats and other ''perks,'' but about their corruption."

1990-03-04T00:00:00Z,"LEAD: A BRIDGE OF CHILDHOOD: Truman Capote's Southern Years. By Marianne M. Moates. (Holt, $19.95.) ''He was a kook,'' declares Marianne M. Moates in her prologue to ''A Bridge of Childhood.'' ''He was a squeaky-voiced homosexual who drank too much.'' A rather crotchety view, but typical of the unreverential squint taken at Truman Capote in this homespun reminiscence."

And let's not forget Elizabeth Taylor's Passion, Cher's Uninhibited, Undeniable by Billy Dee Williams, Only by Julio Iglesias and those named Paloma, Deneuve, Cassini and Misha, named for you know who. Now, in the upper reaches of Madison Avenue, you can have your very own fragrance created for you and you alone and identified not with your name but - how tony can you get?"
1990-03-04T00:00:00Z,"LEAD: Having talked about inexpensive loudspeakers last week, it now seems fair to allot equal time to costly ones. It is also fair to point out at the start that such speakers aren't for average listeners. They are meant for passionate devotees of high-fidelity, unsparing in the effort to narrow the persistent gap between music (the real thing) and its electronic replica."
1990-03-04T00:00:00Z,"LEAD: LESTER D. MORAN, who left his job as vice president of Bloomingdale's Dallas store last year, put the tax laws to work for him to help get the cash flow needed to start his own company."

1990-03-04T00:00:00Z,"LEAD: IF ''King Lear'' is unplayable - oft times, it has been so declared - then what seems like a recent inundation of stage and screen Lears may have a common cause. That is to prove how Shakespeare's ''very foolish, fond old man'' who is ''every inch a king'' can be played any which way, and the play can happen anytime, anyplace or in limbo."

1990-03-04T00:00:00Z,"LEAD: NO two analysts agree on the percentages or the dollars. Nor do they agree on what defines an office building or what constitutes midtown Manhattan. They don't even agree on whether empty space is ''vacant'' or ''available,'' or whether it can be measured accurately in the first place."
1990-03-04T00:00:00Z,"LEAD: Will the dollar continue the small rally it started last week against the West German mark and other European currencies? The West German Bundesbank signaled its concern about the rally of almost three pfennigs by selling dollars in Frankfurt Friday. (See Friday closings for New York at right.)

1990-03-04T00:00:00Z,"LEAD: I have for many years been fascinated by Romania, and in particular by Bucharest. It is a purely literary fascination. It began when I read Olivia Manning's ''Balkan Trilogy,'' from whose pages there rose a seedy glamour, a whiff of alluring decadence that was irresistible. Gradually it attained the status of a disreputable Mecca, something between Anthony Hope's Ruritania and Malcolm Bradbury's Slaka."
1990-03-04T00:00:00Z,"LEAD: Barcelona is a city that has been brushed aside by history - and has learned how to take advantage of that neglect. In the 13th century, Catalan culture flourished from Valencia to Nice; if events had taken a different turn, Barcelona might have become the natural center of a country about the size of Portugal."

1990-03-04T00:00:00Z,"LEAD: It's a bleak day in Manhattan as I'm writing this, and I can't help wondering why I'm here and not on some gorgeous tropical island. In fact, I wonder why I've never been on a gorgeous tropical island. My favorite Broadway number is still ''Bali Ha'i,'' from ''South Pacific,'' with its romantic longing for lush, waterlapped surroundings, and its seductive refrain, ''Come to me, come to me."

The novel, she said, ''made Jonah such a prophet for the 80's and 90's, so narcissistic, full of complaints, apathetic, unwilling to do anything for anyone because there wasn't enough in it for him."
