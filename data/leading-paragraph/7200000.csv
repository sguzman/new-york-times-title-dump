2009-04-05T00:00:00Z,"I find it curious that in his Lives essay (March 22), Michael Krikorian reveals such a deep appreciation for Sarah Vaughan’s version of “Just a Little Lovin’ ” and yet didn’t think much about “pinching” that intellectual property by having his girlfriend’s son burn a copy to give away. Jerry could have easily sent him a link to a site where he could purchase it, and Krikorian could have done the same for EAllen4787. Then he could also feel good about compensating the artists who created such a beautiful work of art."
2009-04-05T00:00:00Z,"I am disturbed by Randy Cohen’s implication that pursuing sweeping change is a nobler pursuit than meeting the immediate needs of those in distress (The Ethicist, March 22). While those who work on the macro level seek financing and negotiate the government bureaucracy, a long-term proposition at best, surely those in need take immeasurable comfort in that bowl of soup. Let’s each give according to our talents and our hearts. The world’s problems need both the big-idea strategist and the human touch."
2009-04-05T00:00:00Z,"I have to agree with A. O. Scott when he writes that “in spite of the abundance of American movies, there is an awful lot of American life that remains off screen” (“Neo-Neo Realism,” March 22). As a sociologist and college educator, I often show films that illuminate a series of social problems and the human experience that results. It has been part of our American culture to search for a deeper understanding of our lives through art and particularly through the visual and emotional immediacy of film. But what do we find?."

A paleoanthropologist, Elizabeth was a faculty member in the Department of Anthropology at Hunter College--CUNY and a contributor to the New York Consortium in Evolutionary Primatology. She was a gifted teacher and scholar. Her research interests took her to Ethiopia every year where she co-directed a paleontological field project in the Rift Valley of Ethiopia. Elizabeth was born in 1965 in Laramie, WY and raised in Pocatello, ID. After graduating from Portland State University in Portland, OR, she spent several years as a field archaeologist in various areas of the world before entering Arizona State University where she earned her Ph.D. under the tutelage of the Institute of Human Origins. Elizabeth leaves behind many dear friends, colleagues, students and a legacy of work that has earned her the respect and admiration of her peers.

2009-04-05T00:00:00Z,"BRESLAU Lawrence (Larry) D.,died at home Monday, March 23, 2009. Larry was born on December 18, 1930 in Albany, New York to Lillian and Ted Nachison. He received a B.A. from Cornell University in 1952, and an M.D. in 1959; a member of the first graduating class of the Albert Einstein College of Medicine, New York City. This was followed by an internship and residency in psychiatry at Greenwich Hospital, Greenwich, and University Hospitals of Cleveland. A well-known psychiatrist, Dr. Breslau practiced in Cleveland from 1960 to 1987. In Baltimore he practiced until his death. While he maintained a private practice in general psychiatry through most of his career, his major contributions to the profession were in the area of geriatric psychiatry. A pioneer in the psychiatric treatment of the aged, Dr. Breslau described the ""exaggerated helplessness"" syndrome, which provided a new understanding of psychiatric disorders in the elderly, especially among those with early senile dementia and Alzheimer's disease. His work contributed to the development of geriatric psychiatry as a distinct sub-specialty. Dr. Breslau taught and mentored future generations of psychiatry residents, emphasizing treatment of the entire human being. Patients and staff reported his passion for psychiatry, and describe that his approach was guided by the common strains of warmth, gentleness, compassion, and frequent humor. Dr. Breslau's greatest influence was the respect and love of patients and colleagues who worked with him. Dr. Breslau is survived by his wife, Erica Sharp, his former wife Naomi Zeidel, and their three children Jonathan and Lisa; Daniel and Margaret; Joshua Breslau and Elizabeth Miller; seven grandchildren; and a sister Judith Moore. Contributions may be made to Kol HaLev, P.O. Box 16399, Baltimore, MD 21210 or Johns Hopkins University, sent to Johns Hopkins Medicine Fund, 100 N. Charles St., Suite 437, Baltimore, MD 21201."

2009-04-05T00:00:00Z,"ZOOM The soldier's body was found near the center of Gettysburg with no identification -- no regimental numbers on his cap, no corps badge on his jacket, no letters, no diary. Nothing save for an ambrotype (an early type of photograph popular in the late 1850s and 1860s) of three small children clutched in his hand. Within a few days the ambrotype came into the possession of Benjamin Schriver, a tavern keeper in the small town of Graeffenburg, about 13 miles west of Gettysburg. The details of how Schriver came into possession of the ambrotype have been lost to history. But the rest of the story survives. ... There is something magical and sad about chronicling the history of a man who went more than halfway around the world on a whaling ship and then died (presumably alone) in a small town, a couple of hundred miles from his home. It is possible to chart Amos Humiston's movements from the moment he joined the 154th New York Volunteer Infantry in Jamestown, N.Y., to Gettysburg, Pa. -- a winding, circuitous, ant-like path that might have meaning, but then again, might not. And even if we could chart it completely, does it bring us closer to Amos Humiston? Does it capture the essence of the man? Even if we knew where he was every minute of his waking life? Would that tell us who he is?"

''I like to take the fashion out it,'' he said. ''And make it more human.'' Which is to say, he eschews airbrushed glamour for a kind of carefree, sun-soaked innocence; not surprisingly, his new book, aptly titled ''Not in Fashion,'' is more akin to a journal than a glossy Rizzoli monograph. It features photos that span his two-decade career, including early fashion shots of a baby-faced Chloë Sevigny (far left) and Angela Lindvall (right). The pages are littered with newspaper clippings, hand-scrawled notes and family photos intentionally blown out by overexposing the film. ''As a photographer, you have so much control,'' Mr. Borthwick said. ''I like to liberate the image so it can breathe a little and allow people to feel and discover new things.''"

2009-04-05T00:00:00Z,"BENJAMIN--John Townshend, of Oxford, died Sunday, March 22, 2009, at Memorial Hospital at Easton after a brief illness. He was 87. Born June 21, 1921, in Southampton, Long Island, NY, the son of the late Henry Rogers Benjamin, a Mayflower descendant and Dorothy Rennard Benjamin. He attended the Beauvais School and the Buckley School in New York City and concluded his preparatory education at St. Paul's School in Concord, NH with the Class of 1939. After graduating, Mr. Benjamin undertook aeronautical training, both elementary and advanced, at Roosevelt Field on Long Island, NY. Upon England's entry into World War II, he attempted to enlist in the Royal Canadian Air Force but was dismissed after failing to tell the enlistment officer he had not yet reached his majority. Upon entry of the United States into the war, Mr. Benjamin joined the United States Naval Air Force and after graduation from flight school became officer in the U.S. Marine Corps. As a Marine flyer he undertook further training in the San Francisco and Seattle areas and successfully flew 59 missions in the Pacific theatre and was awarded two Distinguished Flying Crosses. Piloting B-25 Mitchell bombers from the Pacific island of Ulithi he undertook numerous long range missions in order to bomb the major Japanese military bases on the island of Truk in the Caroline Islands. Mr. Benjamin was discharged at the end of the war after a brief recovery period at Camp Pendleton hospital from an infection contracted from the jungle climate. After leaving the service with the rank of Captain, Mr. Benjamin was employed by the Boeing Corporation in Seattle, but left the company after approximately two years to participate in the family automobile dealerships in Cali, Columbia. On his return from Cali, Mr. Benjamin managed his own widespread investments in the New York area. He was also active in wildcat oil drilling in the North Texas and Oklahoma regions. In 1958, Mr. Benjamin acquired a wooden 110-foot converted World War II Canadian Sub Chaser which he kept in the Miami River in Florida and on which he and his wife, Patricia Traer Benjamin cruised extensively in the United States, the Bahamas and Central America. In 1963, they relocated to Talbot County, residing first on Old Country Club Road in Easton and then in 1969 acquiring Long Point Farm in Oxford. Mr. Benjamin's marriage to Patty ended in divorce in 1972. He was remarried in 1974 to Florence Mackay of Los Angeles, CA. Mrs. Florence Benjamin preceded Mr. Benjamin in death, dying 1989. Mr. Benjamin loved Talbot County, and especially the shorefront scenery around Long Point Farm. He was active in many community organizations and was a generous benefactor of the YMCA of Talbot County. Mr. Benjamin is survived by his sister, Anne Benjamin Barry of Palm Desert, CA and Southampton, NY; his brother, William Evarts Benjamin II of Manalapan, FL and Mount Desert, Maine; his half-brother, Thomas Hyde Clarke of Cooperstown, NY; and by many nieces and nephews whom he always treated with affection and generosity. He was preceded in death by his older brother, Henry Rogers Benjamin, who died in 2004. Funeral services will be private and limited to the close family and friends.

He also served as Democratic Municipal Chairman of Englewood, and then was elected Councilman-at-Large and President of the Englewood City Council in 1971. in 1974, the Ganz family moved to Aspen, CO where they built a house on Red Mountain.

Following the death of his older daughter, Diana in 1992 and his wife Ruth's move to the East Coast, he moved to Santa Fe in 1993, where he married Kate Wall in 1998. He also became active in Santa Fe and served on the boards of various community organizations, including the Santa Fe Community Foundation.

2009-04-05T00:00:00Z,"FROM the growing clamor among shareholders for a greater say on pay, to the public excoriation of A.I.G. executives, the spotlight has been on executive compensation, perhaps as never before. The large bonuses paid to executives, particularly in the financial industry, have come under fire as having helped fuel the credit crisis. Yet even amid economic turmoil, some companies keep increasing pay for their top executives. While some on the following list saw their pay decline, as a group these executives saw their pay climb by an average of 21 percent. Granted, many companies we have become used to seeing on lists of the highest pay, particularly in the financial industry, were knocked out of the running last year, or even out of existence, like Lehman Brothers, whose chief was Richard Fuld. And there is one generous benefit that, for now, few executives can take advantage of. Because of generally falling stock prices, the options awards that form a large part of most executives' pay are now largely valueless -- at least until stocks rise again."

He received a B.A. from Cornell University in 1952, and an M.D. in 1959; a member of the first graduating class of the Albert Einstein College of Medicine, New York City. This was followed by an internship and residency in psychiatry at Greenwich Hospital, Greenwich, and University Hospitals of Cleveland. A well-known psychiatrist, Dr. Breslau practiced in Cleveland from 1960 to 1987. In Baltimore he practiced until his death. While he maintained a private practice in general psychiatry through most of his career, his major contributions to the profession were in the area of geriatric psychiatry. A pioneer in the psychiatric treatment of the aged, Dr. Breslau described the ""exaggerated helplessness"" syndrome, which provided a new understanding of psychiatric disorders in the elderly, especially among those with early senile dementia and Alzheimer's disease. His work contributed to the development of geriatric psychiatry as a distinct sub-specialty. Dr. Breslau taught and mentored future generations of psychiatry residents, emphasizing treatment of the entire human being. Patients and staff reported his passion for psychiatry, and describe that his approach was guided by the common strains of warmth, gentleness, compassion, and frequent humor. Dr. Breslau's greatest influence was the respect and love of patients and colleagues who worked with him. Dr. Breslau is survived by his wife, Erica Sharp, his former wife Naomi Zeidel, and their three children Jonathan and Lisa; Daniel and Margaret; Joshua Breslau and Elizabeth Miller; seven grandchildren; and a sister Judith Moore.

At the start of a 10-day trial at the Kowloon City Magistracy, prosecutors said that Mr. Sze obtained about 1,300 photos of Mr. Chen when the singer brought his computer to a repair shop in 2006, and that Mr. Tze put the images on CDs for other customers.

2009-04-06T11:12:10Z,"Advertisements placed by Warner Brothers warned Bollywood film producers not to proceed with a planned Hindi remake of “The Curious Case of Benjamin Button,” Agence France-Press reported. Last month, The Times of India said that the Bollywood actors Akshay Kumar and Aishwarya Rai would star in a film called “Action Replay,” about a man who ages in reverse. The plot appears to mirror “Benjamin Button,” the David Fincher film that starred Brad Pitt as a man who is born elderly and dies as a baby; that movie was co-produced by Warner Brothers and Paramount. In the advertisements, which appeared in The Times of India and local trade publications on Monday, a New Delhi law firm said that it would pursue legal action against any film made “either in English or Hindi or other language, having a similar script, screenplay or story line or character sketches or interplay of characters or sequence of events” to “Benjamin Button,” according to Agence France-Press."

It is rare to find an outlier, a player unlike any who has come before. The Yankees have a big one in C. C. Sabathia, who makes his regular-season debut for the team on Monday afternoon in Baltimore. The Yankees gave him the most money ever guaranteed to a pitcher -- $161 million for seven years -- without any precedent to study."

2009-04-08T00:00:00Z,"CULLMAN--Dorothy. The Trustees and staff of The Museum of Modern Art deeply mourn the loss of our beloved friend Dorothy Cullman. Her generosity, passion, wit, elegance, and style will be missed throughout the Museum, as well as throughout the philanthropic community. Lewis and Dorothy Cullman have been visionary benefactors to the arts, sciences, and education and their generosity is distinguished by a deep personal involvement and encouragement of others to support the causes that they love. The Cullmans' support of MoMA began in 1971 when they joined the Museum's International Council, and Lewis has always credited Dorothy, who was more familiar with modern art at the time, for his involvement in the art world and with MoMA. The Cullmans' generosity to MoMA established The Lewis B. and Dorothy Cullman Education and Research Building, which completed the Museum's expansion and renovation project and crystallized MoMA's dual missions of art and education. Their support has also made possible The Dorothy and Lewis B. Cullman Gallery in the Museum's Philip Johnson Architecture and Design Galleries, and The Lewis B. and Dorothy Cullman Foundation has endowed a number of education programs at the Museum. Dorothy was a member of The International Council, Architecture and Design Committee, Library Council, and Chairman's Council. Dorothy was a television producer and an avid supporter of writers, artists, and human rights efforts. She served on the boards of numerous not-for-profit organizations and was instrumental in bringing many arts and culture programs to public television by supporting Thirteen WNET. She was a great philanthropist, a committed and inspirational leader, and the best and most beloved of friends. We extend our deepest condolences to her husband Lewis and to their family. The Board of Trustees of The Museum of Modern Art"

Division I men's Frozen Four, but Bemidji State goalie Matt Dalton is keeping the Beavers in the game through the scoreless first period. Though shots are tied, 12-12, the Redhawks have had a distinct edge in terms of quality chances, making Dalton scramble around in the crease to keep pucks out early on.Chris Wideman's slap shot from above the left circle caromed off Dalton and over to Pat Cannone, who had a clear shooting lane but rattled the puck off the outside of the net. The game began with a slow pace, but by the end of the first Miami was challenging with consistency. Dalton's quick glove snagged hard shots from forwards Andy Miele and Justin Mercier in the final two minutes, getting a rise out of a crowd eager to cheer on the underdog Beavers."
2009-04-09T18:07:13Z,"I see that the Obama hound hounds are baying about an imminent arrival. My bet is that it will be a Portuguese water dog, justified in part because the PWD, as they are sometimes known, did not cause Malia to go into full allergic melt down in one or more unannounced trial runs. If that's true, the dog is unlikely to come from a pound, but could come from the breed rescue group. PWDs are not abundant, and the club is highly active and protective--it's been a leader in genetic research, due to a plant geneticist in Utah, Karl Gordon Lark, who decided to find out why his beloved PWD died young. If not a rescue, and there are plenty of reasons not to go that route, even if a dog were available, then it will come from a breeder--that's my bet--and the animal welfare groups will howl. Not a thing new about that. They have to howl about something. I say let the Obamas have the dog of their choosing. Anyway, those are guesses. I have no insider knowledge on this one. We'll see."

As a founding member of the Botanical Science Committee, Dorothy's intellectual and philanthropic interests were very broad and included a wide range of science research efforts at the Garden. Together Dorothy and Lewis founded the Lewis B. and Dorothy Cullman Program for Molecular Systematics, providing our scientists with state-of-the-art facilities and cutting-edge technologies for botanical research.

2009-04-10T09:20:53Z,"The civility and hospitality that Canada is known for was in short supply at a Thursday night concert performed in Toronto by Billy Bob Thornton and his band, the Boxmasters, The Toronto Star reported. The performance came one day after Mr. Thornton gave a cantankerous interview to Canada’s public CBC radio, in which he frequently responded to the questions of his interviewer, Jian Ghomeshi, with silence or non sequiturs. (Asked what music he listened to when he was young, Mr. Thornton replied with an answer about the magazine Famous Monsters of Filmland.) Appearing Thursday at Massey Hall, Mr. Thornton was greeted with numerous boos and taunts of “Here comes the gravy!” (a response to Mr. Thorton’s claim in the interview that Canadian audiences are “mashed potatoes with no gravy”). The performer told the audience that he was displeased that Mr. Ghomeshi ignored a request not to discuss Mr. Thornton’s film career in the interview. “I don’t really like sensationalism,” Mr. Thortnon said, according to The Star. “If you look someone in the eyes and promise them something, and you don’t do it, you don’t get the interview. That’s the way it goes.”"

In a release, the producer Randall L. Wreghitt said that Mr. Nichols, whose albums include the 2007 best-seller “Real Things,” would play the central character portrayed by George Strait in the film. (In the movie, the character was named Dusty; in the show, he will be named Rusty.) Mr. Wreghitt said that the show was still securing financing but was planned for an early 2010 opening. The “Pure Country” musical will be directed by Peter Masterson (“The Best Little Whorehouse in Texas”), who is writing the book with Rex McGee (the original film’s screenwriter); the music is by Steve Dorff and the lyrics are by John Bettis."

In a news release, the Corcoran said that the positions eliminated ranged from entry-level jobs to senior management, and that the job reductions represented 5.6 percent of its total full- and part-time staff. The museum said that it was also instituting other cost-cutting measures in response to the economic slowdown, including an extension of its hiring freeze and the suspension of its employer contributions to workers’ pension plans starting in May.

2009-04-10T13:56:56Z,"In uncertain times for newspapers, readers of The Courier-Journal in Louisville, Ky., might be forgiven for wondering if what they saw when they looked at Friday’s front page was a cost-cutting measure: all the words and even the pictures on the printed page had been hand-drawn, down to the weather box and the captions. But the transformation was the work of the Turkish artist Serkan Ozkaya, who has done the same thing to parts or whole pages with the cooperation of several other newspapers around the world (including The New York Times) to create what he describes as cheap, unexpected mass-produced works of art. The latest newspaper drawing – Mr. Ozkaya renders the page with the help of assistants after it has been laid out by editors and the drawing is then printed – is the first project of a new nonprofit, noncollecting art organization called artwithoutwalls, founded in Louisville by the art collectors Steve Wilson and Laura Lee Brown to help artists create works in nontraditional settings around the country.

It ranges from the very old (Giovanni Gabrieli’s Canzon Septimi Toni No. 2) to the very new (works by Tan Dun and Mason Bates) and includes a healthy dose of classic symphonic fare: the Allegro giocoso from Brahms’s Fourth Symphony, “Nuages” from Debussy’s “Nocturnes,” the finale from Tchaikovsky’s Fourth Symphony. Yuja Wang is the piano soloist in the Scherzo from Prokofiev’s Concerto No. 2; Gil Shaham, the violin soloist in the finale from Mozart’s Concerto No. 5; and Measha Brueggergosman, the soprano soloist in John Cage’s “Aria With Renga.” There is also music by Bach (for unaccompanied cello), Dvorak, Wagner, Rachmaninoff (for piano, six hands), Villa-Lobos and Lou Harrison. The orchestra — more than 90 players from more than 30 countries, selected through auditions posted on YouTube — is to gather for its first rehearsal on Monday morning at the Juilliard School.

2009-04-10T15:16:16Z,"“Trust Me,” a comedy-drama about a make-believe advertising agency in Chicago, was canceled by TNT on Friday after a single season. It “achieved creative success,” said Michael Wright, executive vice president and head of programming for TNT, TBS and TCM in Atlanta. “It just didn’t find an audience.” According to ratings data from TNT, a Time Warner cable channel, “Trust Me” drew only about 1.4 million viewers for each episode during its 13-episode season, which started in January and ended on Tuesday. The series featured Eric McCormack and Tom Cavanagh as creative executives at the imaginary agency. “People sometimes lament there’s so much drama built around doctors and lawyers and police,” Mr. Wright said, but it may be that the world of advertising is “not as accessible a subject as other subjects on television.” The acclaimed drama about advertising on AMC, “Mad Men,” also draws a smaller audience than procedural dramas. Turner Entertainment, which oversees TNT, integrated real products into the scripts of “Trust Me” as part of advertising sales packages; the characters at the agency, Rothman Greene & Mohr, worked on campaigns for brands including Dove."

He was always a man of great character, intelligence, generosity and loyalty. He was an unwaveringly devoted husband, father, grandfather and great-grandfather; always there for his family as a selfless, unconditionally loving mentor and coach. More importantly, he led and taught by example. His refusal to bow to adversity, particularly evident in recent years, has provided an indelible lesson of tenacity and perseverance to all those fortunate enough to know him. Born December 19, 1921 to Martin and Henrietta Katzenstein in New York City, he was the adored younger brother to Ruth (Reiss) and Robert Kay. He attended Horace Mann High School and went on to Cornell University, where he studied engineering. Married to Dickie Sloman in 1952, they spent the next 57 years together in what can only be characterized as the perfect relationship. In retirement, Marty and Dickie traveled together, played tennis and bridge and participated in numerous volunteer roles with United and White Plains Hospitals and Meals on Wheels. Marty's children, Patty (Raddock), Peter and Kathy (Gutner) were always at the center of his world and his pride in them was boundless. His love and friendship also made him Dad to their spouses Steve, Sheri and Richard. Marty had a special relationship with his 10 grandchildren. He loved talking to them and in later years, just being able to sit and watch them play together brought him enormous happiness. In 1945 Marty took over the reins of his grandfather's company, L. Katzenstein & Co. and ran it successfully for the next 45 years. Marty was a loyal and loving friend to all. For enjoyment, Marty loved playing tennis and bridge at Quaker Ridge Country Club, doing the Sunday Times crossword puzzle, and rooting for all New York pro teams (he was always a big baseball fan and equally loved the Yankees and Mets). Marty was a member of the King Solomon Lodge for 67 years. His optimism and courage are legacies that will be carried by the generations, present and future, that he helped to create. His family and friends celebrate his life and will dearly miss this extraordinary person.

Throughout their life together, they continued to travel and enjoy mountain and wilderness areas on foot and by canoe, including overseas and in Montana where they retired in 1975 to Missoula. In Rochester, NY, Alice took up teaching elementary grades in the inner-city schools and working for Planned Parenthood, living out her deep commitment to social justice and equality started in the family by her grandfather, General Samuel Chapman Armstrong, who founded Hampton Institute, the first college for black students, at the end of the Civil War. In Missoula, Alice became well-known for her dedication and service to preservation of the natural environment through her extensive lobbying and volunteer efforts, and the sense of community she found in Montana derived from these efforts brought her great pleasure."

2009-04-12T00:00:00Z,"BARNETT--Dr. Marjorie C.,a leading Chicago psychoanalyst, patron of the arts, passed away peacefully on April 2 at her home in Lincoln Park, Chicago surrounded by her friends and family. She was 78 years old. Dr. Barnett loved her children, loved music, loved art, loved her profession, loved her patients, loved good food and fine wine, loved good literature, loved tennis, loved skiing and running, loved and was loved by her friends she truly loved and embraced life. Dr. Barnett founded the A.N. and Pearl G. Barnett Family Foundation in 1989 to underwrite research in medicine and psychoanalysis. For many years, she supported clinical research in Hematology. Since 1997, the Foundation has sponsored an annual competition for young talented musicians. Each year a different instrument was featured, the young competitors played a selection of classical repertoire. Under her direction, The Foundation commissioned works by young composers to be learned and performed by all contestants. Most recently, she funded the Israeli String Quartet that was suggested to her by her friend, Itzhak Perlman, who has admitted her into his Perlman Music Program. She hosted eagerly anticipated evenings for the competitions, and concert soirees featuring the finest professional musicians reminiscent of the grand salons of 19th century Europe. The invitees came from all walks of life, the established, working folk, musicians, students, photographers, career professionals, artists anyone who shared Dr. Barnett's interest in music, art, and stimulating conversation. She thrived on lively conversation, analysis, art, music and fine food. Often the chef de cuisine was a famous local chef- and more recently her brilliant chef son-Douglas. Dr. Barnett was born in Brooklyn, New York, attended Stanford University at the young age of 16, and later graduated from the University of Wisconsin-Madison. She was the first woman to attend and to graduate from the Chicago Medical School. After receiving her medical degree, she completed her internship at the University of Minnesota Hospital, and a residency in Psychiatry at Michael Reese Hospital. She continued her studies at the Institute for Psychoanalysis in Chicago, graduating in both the core analytic and child analytic programs, and later served on the faculty. She also served on the faculty of the University of Chicago, authored several seminal articles on psychoanalytic theory published in the Journal of the American Psychoanalytic Association, and the Annual of Psychoanalysis. Well-known as a person of wide ranging interests and remarkable intensity and ability, she was exceptionally dedicated to her patients and practice continuing to see patients until the very end. She played piano brilliantly, traveled extensively and was a devoted enthusiast of 20th Century modern art. She skied well enough to be selected to join the Aspen Ski Patrol, piloted an airplane, played tennis every Saturday and challenged the best players on the court. She explored the intellectual aspects of all facets of the world and was a slave to none although she remained a confirmed and convinced Freudian. As with music, she had the same keen understanding and appreciation of art and literature. Anyone who visited a museum with her, or attended a concert, or shared in a book discussion, came away amazed at the independence, and depth and subtlety of her appreciation. She will be missed by all who loved and knew her. She is survived by two adoring sons, Alexander Gordon Barnett, and Douglas George Barnett of Chicago, two sisters, Sally Barnett and Barbara Barnett Goldfarb of New York, and an extensive network of close friends that she cultivated throughout her life. A memorial service will be announced at a later date. Contributions may be made to the A.N. and Pearl G.

2009-04-12T00:00:00Z,"BENJAMIN--John Townshend, of Oxford, died Sunday, March 22, 2009, at Memorial Hospital at Easton after a brief illness. He was 87. Born June 21, 1921, in Southampton, Long Island, NY, the son of the late Henry Rogers Benjamin, a Mayflower descendant and Dorothy Rennard Benjamin. He attended the Beauvais School and the Buckley School in New York City and concluded his preparatory education at St. Paul's School in Concord, NH with the Class of 1939. After graduating, Mr. Benjamin undertook aeronautical training, both elementary and advanced, at Roosevelt Field on Long Island, NY. Upon England's entry into World War II, he attempted to enlist in the Royal Canadian Air Force but was dismissed after failing to tell the enlistment officer he had not yet reached his majority. Upon entry of the United States into the war, Mr. Benjamin joined the United States Naval Air Force and after graduation from flight school became officer in the U.S. Marine Corps. As a Marine flyer he undertook further training in the San Francisco and Seattle areas and successfully flew 59 missions in the Pacific theatre and was awarded two Distinguished Flying Crosses. Piloting B-25 Mitchell bombers from the Pacific island of Ulithi he undertook numerous long range missions in order to bomb the major Japanese military bases on the island of Truk in the Caroline Islands. Mr. Benjamin was discharged at the end of the war after a brief recovery period at Camp Pendleton hospital from an infection contracted from the jungle climate. After leaving the service with the rank of Captain, Mr. Benjamin was employed by the Boeing Corporation in Seattle, but left the company after approximately two years to participate in the family automobile dealerships in Cali, Columbia. On his return from Cali, Mr. Benjamin managed his own widespread investments in the New York area. He was also active in wildcat oil drilling in the North Texas and Oklahoma regions. In 1958, Mr. Benjamin acquired a wooden 110-foot converted World War II Canadian Sub Chaser which he kept in the Miami River in Florida and on which he and his wife, Patricia Traer Benjamin cruised extensively in the United States, the Bahamas and Central America. In 1963, they relocated to Talbot County, residing first on Old Country Club Road in Easton and then in 1969 acquiring Long Point Farm in Oxford. Mr. Benjamin's marriage to Patty ended in divorce in 1972. He was remarried in 1974 to Florence Mackay of Los Angeles, CA. Mrs. Florence Benjamin preceded Mr. Benjamin in death, dying 1989. Mr. Benjamin loved Talbot County, and especially the shorefront scenery around Long Point Farm. He was active in many community organizations and was a generous benefactor of the YMCA of Talbot County. Mr. Benjamin is survived by his sister, Anne Benjamin Barry of Palm Desert, CA and Southampton, NY; his brother, William Evarts Benjamin II of Manalapan, FL and Mount Desert, Maine; his half-brother, Thomas Hyde Clarke of Cooperstown, NY; and by many nieces and nephews whom he always treated with affection and generosity. He was preceded in death by his older brother, Henry Rogers Benjamin, who died in 2004. Funeral services will be private and limited to the close family and friends.

Founder and CEO of Angela Cummings Fine Jewelry, Inc. and former Vice President of Tiffany & Co., passed away at his home in Salt Lake City on January 30, 2009, after a brave battle with lymphoma. Cummings, a certified Gemologist of the American Gem Society (1972) and a Fellow of the Gemological Association of Great Britain (1973), was employed in the diamond office of Tiffany & Co. in New York City for many years before becoming Vice President of the Company, a position he held for over two decades. Mr. Cummings also held a B.A. in Business Management from Stamford University. While at Tiffany & Co., Bruce met the young jewelry designer, Angela Baeumker, and married in 1970. The Cummings left Tiffany & Co. in 1984 to found Angela Cummings, Inc., a privately held corporation. For 20 years Bruce and Angela worked side by side building the Angela Cummings brand, best known its exquisite jewelry pieces composed of 18-karat gold as well as platinum and sterling silver, highlighted with bright-colored gems. The brand later expanded into categories other than jewelry, such as tabletop, accessories and leather goods. Bruce and Angela opened the first Angela Cummings Fine Jewelry Boutique in the upscale Bergdorf Goodman on Valentine's Day 1985. The 500-square-foot space, a first for a fine jewelry designer at the Fifth Avenue retailer, enjoyed an unprecedented 20-year success. Angela Cummings Boutiques were also showcased throughout Neiman Marcus, Saks Fifth Avenue and Bloomingdales, as well as internationally in a long-term partnership with Shiseido in Japan. In June 2003, Bruce and Angela and their business partner, Michele Ateyeh, decided to retire and close the design studio and the wholesale showroom. Over 400 retail executives, designers, clients and friends of the Cummings attended the farewell event at the Grill Room in Manhattan's Four Seasons restaurant to wish the two well-liked industry figures well in their new endeavors. Upon retirement, Bruce and Angela moved from Greenwich, Connecticut, to Salt Lake City, Utah, where Bruce had resided most of his life, prior to moving to the East Coast. He was an avid skier and tennis player who very much enjoyed the active lifestyle offered in Salt Lake City. Bruce is survived by his wife, Angela, his son, Bruce Campbell Cummings (Nicole), and his daughters, Allison McPherson, Hillary Pugh and Millicent Cummings. He is also survived by four grandchildren, by his brothers, Richard (Julie) and Robert (JoAnn) and by many nieces and nephews.

2009-04-12T00:00:00Z,"MYERS--Dr. Warren Powers Laird, 87, of Norwich, VT and Hanover, NH, a noted medical oncologist, died at home on April 1, 2009. A graduate of Episcopal Academy, Yale University and the College of Physicians and Surgeons of Columbia University, Dr. Myers was also the recipient of various honors for his post-doctoral work at the Mayo Clinic and at Trinity College of Cambridge University in Cambridge, England. For his work in medical school, he was awarded membership in Alpha Omega Alpha, the national medical honor society. Following his service as a medical officer in the United States Navy, internships at Philadelphia General Hospital and Maimonides Hospital, and fellowship at the Mayo Clinic, Dr. Myers joined the staff of the Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center in New York City. Apart from a fellowship at Cambridge, he remained with Memorial Sloan-Kettering for 34 years until his retirement in 1986. As Chairman of the Department of Medicine, he transformed Memorial Sloan-Kettering's approach to oncology in accord with his belief that the best cancer care is delivered by physicians who are specialists in both oncology and internal medicine. Later, he served as Memorial's vice president for educational affairs, occupying the Eugene Kettering chair of education. Throughout his years at Memorial, he also taught on the faculty of Cornell University Medical College, served as its associate dean, and authored numerous articles, research studies, and a portion of a prominent medical textbook. During his years in New York, Dr. Myers was a leader in a variety of civic and professional organizations. He was a director of the Damon Runyon Cancer Fund and an active member of the Charaka Society, the Practitioners' Society of NY and the Century Association. He also served as an elder of the Rye, NY and the Fifth Avenue (NYC) Presbyterian Churches and as a deacon of the Norwich Congregational Church. Following retirement, Dr. Myers and his wife moved to Norwich, VT. There he found great pleasure in riding his 1946 Ford tractor, monitoring the progress of his corn crop, and walking with his dog. Professionally, he continued to teach physical diagnosis at nearby Dartmouth Medical School, from which he retired as Emeritus Professor of Medicine in 1996, and served on the Boards of Trustees of the Hitchcock Clinic and Dartmouth-Hitchcock Medical Center from 1983 to 1996. Renowned both as a ""patient's doctor"" and as a ""doctor's doctor,"" Myers will probably be best remembered as an educator of physicians. Scores of today's leading oncologists and internists trained under Dr. Myers at Memorial Sloan-Kettering and learned physical diagnosis under his tutelage at Cornell and Dartmouth medical schools. The other side of the student-teacher relationship was equally important to him. He always considered himself the most fortunate of physicians for having been allowed to train under and work with the very best men and women in their fields."
2009-04-12T00:00:00Z,"I DON'T keep a stocked bar. I usually have wine if I haven't forgotten to go to the liquor store. When I was in my 20s, however, I kept Scotch, bourbon, gin, vodka, vermouth and various aperitifs. I did this because my parents did it, although they had a real bar with a black marble sink. My parents lived a relatively formal life. They gave cocktail parties and dinner parties at which I sometimes helped wait table. My mother used silver every day: flat silver, silver trays, silver teapots, silver coffeepots, sugar bowls, creamers, on and on. My mother had grown up in England with impossibly high housekeeping standards maintained by servants. I can still remember meals at my grandparents', the table arrayed in crystal and silver and china, bowls of roses from the garden. Even the dog and cat were brushed every morning to prevent shedding."

2009-04-12T00:00:00Z,"FOR nearly 25 years, Marc J. Straus ran an oncology practice in White Plains, working 80-hour weeks. ''It's rewarding being able to help people this way,'' said Mr. Straus, a resident of Chappaqua, N.Y. ''But there wasn't a day or night that I wasn't called on a new case. No one could ever play tennis or racquetball with me because the odds were I wouldn't show up.'' Three years ago, Mr. Straus, 65, who also is a well-known art collector, closed his full-time practice (though he is still taking on cases selectively) and turned his attention toward another passion: poetry. A latecomer to writing verse, he has published more than 100 poems and three books since taking his first course in poetry writing at the 92nd Street Y in 1991. Now his first play -- ''Not God,'' a two-act, two-character piece written in verse -- makes its full-fledged debut at Luna Stage in Montclair in previews on April 16 (the official opening is April 24)."

2009-04-12T00:00:00Z,"Even with an extended spring training because of the World Baseball Classic, some competitions for starting positions were still not decided by the first week of the season. And some who had won jobs had tenuous holds on them. Jason Motte, left, had a strong spring to tag himself as the Cardinals' closer. But in his first save opportunity, he gave up four runs in the ninth inning to the Pirates and took a loss. Dennys Reyes collected a save on Thursday, and in Motte's next opportunity, on Friday, he gave up two singles while facing three batters. He was pulled in favor of Kyle McClellan -- like Motte, a right-hander -- who got the save."

''In our crew, we're all part of a small group of power gliding pilots, and the idea for a yacht race started when one of our members, who's a skipper, suggested we organize something. We wanted to have it annually on Oct. 11, our national holiday, the day of the people's uprising. So, symbolically, we had 11 boats, and all the competitors were Macedonian. This year was our second run, with three days of training, two days of racing and two days of partying. It's great. You have the sun, the open water; sometimes you have dolphins swimming beside you. And if the wind is good and you're at full sail, the adrenaline rush is perfect. When you have a whole crew that's working toward the same goal, you become very close, like a family. You've got 10 people on a boat that's only 43 feet long, for a whole week, so you must be very open-minded.'' As told to Austin Considine"

Coraghessan Boyle, two authors who are generally not wildly enthusiastic about honors or distinctions, are among the newest inductees of the American Academy of Arts and Letters, The Associated Press reported. On Monday, the academy was to announce that Mr. Price (whose novels include “Clockers” and “Lush Life”) and Mr. Boyle (“Drop City”) would be among the nine artists added to its 250-member roster. The new class will also include the poets Jorie Graham and Yusef Komunyakaa, the visual artist Judy Pfaff, the architect Tod Williams and the composers Stephen Hartke, Frederic Rzewski and Augusta Read Thomas. The new members will be inducted in a ceremony in May, and will be allowed to serve on academy committees that award prizes but otherwise they have no official responsibilities. Upon learning in 1999 that he had won a literary prize from the academy, Mr. Price said, “I thought maybe I get discounts at local restaurants,” according to The A.P."
2009-04-13T09:41:59Z,"Having scored an unexpected hit with his literary mashup “Pride and Prejudice and Zombies,” the writer Seth Grahame-Smith will take at least two more stabs at combining period drama and horror, Publishers Weekly reported. Mr. Grahame-Smith currently finds himself at No. 3 on the New York Times’s Paperback Trade Fiction Bestseller list with “Pride and Prejudice and Zombies” (Quirk Books), which combines Jane Austen’s classic, out-of-copyright novel with scenes of bone-chomping gore. (Opening line: “It is a truth universally acknowledged that a zombie in possession of brains must be in want of more brains.”) So of course publishers want a second and third helping: Grand Central Press signed Mr. Grahame-Smith to a two-book deal, starting with a new book called “Abraham Lincoln: Vampire Hunter” that imagines the 16th president dedicating himself to the great task that the undead shall perish from the earth.

The exhibit, “Dead Sea Scrolls: Words That Changed the World,” is scheduled to open at the museum on June 27 and would display scrolls discovered in caves near the Dead Sea between 1947 and 1956. But in a letter sent to Canada’s Prime Minister Stephen Harper and to the museum, Palestinian officials say that the scrolls were obtained illegally by Israel when it annexed East Jerusalem after the war in 1967. “The exhibition would entail exhibiting or displaying artifacts removed from the Palestinian territories,” wrote Hamdan Taha, the director-general of the archaeological department in the Palestinian Ministry of Tourism and Antiquities, according to The Star.

A Fox spokesperson told TV Guide that the eighth season of “24,” a spy serial whose events are supposed to take place in real time, would be set and at least partly shot in New York.

2009-04-15T14:06:03Z,"One fewer contestant and a muzzle on the judges could not help “American Idol” finish on time Tuesday night, as the most popular show on television once again ran over its hourlong slot on Fox, this time by about four minutes. After receiving numerous complaints the previous week, when the Tuesday-night competition episode ran about eight minutes long, the “Idol” producers tried to keep the live show within bounds this week by allowing only two of the four judges to critique each of the seven contestants. Many of the complaints about last week’s overrun came from viewers who set their digital video recorders to save the broadcast for later viewing but who apparently did not avail themselves of the feature that allows the machine to keep recording beyond the scheduled finishing time. But the delay in the start of the following Fox series, “Fringe,” also potentially gave fits to Fox’s local affiliates, which were faced with either letting that program infringe on their newscasts or cutting short their own broadcast time."

Among those in attendance at the ceremony were his widow, Olivia, and his son, Dhani, as well as his former bandmate Paul McCartney. Mr. McCartney did not make any public remarks, but Olivia Harrison said of her late husband, “He was a beautiful, mystical man living in a material world, and he was as funny as the day is long, and just as perplexing,” according to Reuters.

2009-04-15T11:42:35Z,"Though Woody Allen is used to having his late-period movies criticized, even his resilient ego may be stung by the comments made by a lawyer for the clothing company American Apparel and reported by The Associated Press. Last year, Mr. Allen filed suit against American Apparel after it posted billboards in New York and Los Angeles that used an image of him in rabbinical attire, from his movie “Annie Hall,” without his authorization. In a deposition in December, Mr. Allen said the ads were “sleazy” and “infantile,” according to The A.P. Stuart Slotnick, a lawyer for American Apparel, told The A.P that at a May trial date he intends to bring up Mr. Allen’s affair with the woman he later married, Soon-Yi Previn, the adopted daughter of his then-companion, Mia Farrow. “Certainly, our belief is that after the various sex scandals that Woody Allen has been associated with, corporate America’s desire to have Woody Allen endorse their product is not what he may believe it is,” Mr. Slotnick told the A.P."

Mascot Books, a small independent publisher in Herndon, Va., that specializes in producing titles based on university and school mascots, is rushing out the book to capture the fervor surrounding the Obamas’ new dog. The book is written by Naren Aryal, a founder of Mascot Books, and illustrated by Danny Moore, an employee of the company. Mr. Aryal said he and Mr. Moore had been working on the project for about two months, leaving space for pictures of the dog once it was chosen. The 32-page book includes references to longstanding White House traditions like the Easter egg roll and the pardoning of the Thanksgiving turkey, as well as newer things introduced by the Obamas like the swing set for their daughters, and Michelle Obama’s organic garden. Mr. Aryal said neither of the Obamas’ daughters are named in the book because he wanted to protect their privacy."

Highlights of the books she wrote and illustrated include ""A Whittle Too Much,"" winner of the Catholic Book Club Award and one of The New York Times 100 Best Books for 1955. ""Reindeer Rescue,"" won the William Allen White Children's Book Award for 1957-1958. Her next book, ""The Bear Ship of Many Lives,"" received the Boys Life Dodd Mead Writing Award in 1962. To research the true story for this book, Stella traveled above the Arctic Circle. Stella also illustrated and authored ""Binkley's Bottleneck"" and ""Philip and the Ninety-Nine Frogs.""

2009-04-15T00:00:00Z,"In the span of a couple of weeks recently, I enjoyed salads made with pears and pecorino. One was a rather delicate and refreshing assembly on a bed of sliced fennel, with a sprinkling of pine nuts, at the new Armani Ristorante on Fifth Avenue. The other was at Insieme in the theater district; it had scattered walnuts and used escarole and frisée as the bed. Both restaurants used pecorino, a firm and tangy sheep's milk cheese, from Pienza in Tuscany, which is famous for it. Despite the allure of these salads, they challenge wine. Sancerre to the rescue! Its grape, sauvignon blanc, is the default when it comes to salad. It classically yields a wine whose minerality, herbaceous notes and steely backbone are undaunted by whatever vinegar you might splash its way. And it proved the right choice for my take on the pear-pecorino combo, made with fava beans that caught my eye in the market. FLORENCE FABRICANT"

2009-04-16T00:00:00Z,"The opponents are imaginary in the samurai martial arts form known as iaido (pronounced ee-eye-doe), an unlikely combination of dancelike movements and a nasty-looking weapon. Iaido is especially appealing, perhaps, to anyone who's ever practiced tough-guy poses in the bathroom mirror. Iaido (below) can be a ''moving meditation,'' but its operative idea is deadly, explained Noboru Kataoka, one of its leading masters and a martial arts film actor. ''The moment you draw the sword, you have to kill your opponent,'' he said. Each of its swordsmanship routines, called kata, evokes a specific peril, like fighting in a low-ceilinged tunnel, sparring in the dark, or being jumped from two sides."
2009-04-16T00:00:00Z,"It can be surprising in Japanese archery to see a shooter taking aim a mere bow's length from her target. While that distance can stretch, kyudo (below) is not about the bull's-eye. ''You have to have this awareness of what you're doing but not be judging it,'' explained Vivi Spicer, a Maryland curator, as she trained in her yard. Indoors, she popped in a video profile of Kanjuro Shibata, her school's master, who looks like a Japanese Jack LaLanne but sounds like a mystic. ''A master does not try to hit the target,'' Mr. Shibata intoned, adding that ''if he has a good heart, he will hit the target even if he is blind.'' Kyudo is more stillness than action. ''Every movement of the hands, of the body, of the feet, is prescribed'' by sequences analogous to iaido's kata, Ms. Spicer said. Even releasing the arrow is less a decision than something ''that happens when the movement is right, like fruit dropping.''"

It's no accident that their weapons -- rattan sticks, wood daggers and the hard side of one's hand -- can be approximated by items you might have on hand, like umbrellas, bottles or even a pen, Mr. Acosta said. Classes consist of sparring and grappling drills called offensiva-defensiva, usually practiced in pairs. But instructors eschew rigid sequences.

2009-04-16T00:00:00Z,"URBAIN--John, of Block Island, RI, died peacefully on April 8, 2009, in Milford, CT at age 88. A devoted father, husband, poet, and artist-- his talent, insights, humor and warm spirit, inspired and touched the lives of many. Born in Brussels, Belgium in 1920, he immigrated with his parents to Detroit, Michigan in 1922. Drafted into the US Army in 1941, John was an infantry Corporal whose skill as an illustrator led him to create army training graphics and murals. Wounded during WWII, he later depicted the pathos of war in his own artwork. Under the G.I. Bill, John studied art at Black Mountain College, where his most influential teacher, Josef Albers, opened his eyes to new approaches to design, color, matiere, and collage, that soon became the dominant perspective from which John would create his art. In 1946, John and his new wife, fellow artist and Black Mountain student, Elaine Schmidt moved to Paris where they studied art at the Academie de la Grande Chaumiere. John worked as Art Director for Philip Morris for over 25 years, where he was instrumental in acquiring an outstanding corporate art collection. John's own work has been in the collections of the Museum of Modern Art, the Brooklyn Museum of Art, the National Gallery of Art, the Detroit, Houston and North Carolina Museums of Art, the Asheville Art Museum, and in numerous private collections and galleries in the US and abroad. Throughout his life, John worked pro bono for the civil rights and anti-war movements; taught neighborhood children painting and stained glass; and served as an inspiration to countless artists. John also studied poetry and was published in the New York Quarterly and Yankee Magazine. In an exhibition catalogue, he wrote: ""I offer here a portrait of my life - not as a finished piece, but rather as a work in progress-- not so much about what I have produced as it is about the journey itself. I am continually struck by my indebtedness to friends and family who have helped at every juncture along the way. Art, in the end, is a reflection of existence: yearning, suffering, epiphany and love."" John is survived by his son, Michael, of Peekskill, NY, and his daughter, Catherine, and granddaughter, Carina, of Milford, Connecticut. A memorial service will be held on April 18th in Scarborough, NY. In lieu of flowers, contributions can be sent to the Block Island Nature Conservancy. The family is in the process of establishing the John Urbain Memorial Scholarship to support the study of art for students at the Block Island School.

2009-04-16T00:00:00Z,"Developed a thousand years ago as warriors' pole-arms, naginata (above) later passed to samurai wives for defense. Eventually, ''a fine naginata became a requisite item in the dowry of a samurai bride,'' said Ray Sosnowski, a Maryland engineer, Zen lay priest and instructor of weapons arts. In 1912, naginata was introduced in Japanese high schools, where it remains a staple of girls' physical education. Though Japanese men disdain it, perhaps half the roughly 200 United States naginata practitioners are male, Mr. Sosnowski estimated. Today's naginata are slender and lightweight, up to seven and a half feet long, with curved tips of wood or bamboo. Their use -- to batter, stab or hook an opponent -- makes sense for women, as it relies on ''the centripetal force of rotating hips, of swinging arms, and of the long, rotating weapon'' rather than upper-body strength, Mr. Sosnowski explained."

2009-04-16T00:00:00Z,"8:30 P.M. (TV5Monde) THE TRILOGY The director Lucas Belvaux used three editors (each of whom won a César Award) to create three films -- a romantic comedy, a thriller and a melodrama -- all shot at the same time in southwestern France using the same cast. In this first installment, ''The Amazing Couple'' (2002), a man finds out that he has to undergo minor surgery but decides not to tell his wife so as not to worry her. She knows he's keeping a secret and suspects he's cheating, so she asks her best friend's husband, a police inspector, to track him. The film ''is, for the most part, pretty funny,'' A. O. Scott wrote in The New York Times. ''It helps enormously that the protagonist, a fussy, hypochondriacal lawyer named Alain, is played by François Morel, whose rubbery, hangdog face and slumping posture take some pressure off Mr. Belvaux, who as a farceur is more competent than dazzling.'' Ornella Muti and Gilbert Melki, above, also star. Part 2, ''On the Run,'' will be shown on April 23; Part 3, ''After the Life'' on April 30. 7 A.M.

2009-04-16T00:00:00Z,"BOREK--Gene. The members of Metropolis Country Club in White Plains, NY, mourn the passing of a consummate gentleman, their long time Head Golf Professional and friend, Gene Borek, who died on April 15, 2009 at his home in Hartsdale after a more than seven year battle with cancer. Mr. Borek, who was 72, joined Metropolis as Head Golf Professional in 1980 and remained in that position for 25 years. Following his retirement, Gene became an honorary member of Metropolis and continued to be at the Club on a regular basis maintaining the many friendships and student-teacher relationships he had established over the years. Gene Borek is widely regarded as one of the best club pro players of the modern era. He gathered national attention when he shot a course-record 65 in the 1973 U.S. Open at Oakmont, a record that was broken two days later by the Championship winner, Johnny Miller. Additional national honors included Mr. Borek winning the PGA National Stroke Play championship twice and the PGA National Match Play Championship once. He competed in 11 PGA Championships and 10 US Opens, for a total of 21 PGA Tour majors. On the local level Mr. Borek had a truly successful career. He won the Met PGA Championship three times, was twice Met Player of the Year, won three Long Island PGA Championships, two Long Island Open titles and two Westchester PGA titles. Gene is a member of four Halls of Fame (Metropolitan PGA, Westchester Sports, Yonkers and Metropolis). In addition to being a great player, Mr. Borek was a great teacher, mentor and all-around professional. His list of non-playing honors and awards is legendary and includes being named Met PGA Professional of the year in 1972, Met PGA Teacher of the Year in 1996, and the 2003 recipient of the Met PGA Bill Strausbaugh Award for Club Relations and Mentoring, to name a few. While Mr. Borek was a gifted player and Teaching Professional, he was also a dignified and gentle man and a good friend to many of the club's members. A private person himself, he never failed to show genuine interest in the personal lives of his friends at Metropolis. Numerous Metropolis members have said that the best decision made in the Club's long history was inviting Gene Borek to join the Metropolis family. Mr. Borek is survived by his daughter, Coleen, sons Robert and Wesley and by his wife, Joan."

With her sister Edith Harris (1907-1999) and brother Bernard Fread (1904-1992), she shared many wonderful memories growing up which became the basis for some of her books. She attended Hunter College and The Art Students League. Among her best known artistic endeavors were her watercolor and oil paintings, often whimsical, combining nature scenes from her global travels with her great knowledge of birds and animals. Highlights of the books she wrote and illustrated include ""A Whittle Too Much,"" winner of the Catholic Book Club Award and one of The New York Times 100 Best Books for 1955. ""Reindeer Rescue,"" won the William Allen White Children's Book Award for 1957-1958. Her next book, ""The Bear Ship of Many Lives,"" received the Boys Life Dodd Mead Writing Award in 1962.

The orchestra said it would continue its teaching projects and school concerts, which still have funding, mainly from government sources. The orchestra, which is led by Michael Christie, usually presents about four programs a year at the Brooklyn Academy of Music. J. Barclay Collins II, the orchestra’s board chairman, said the philharmonic was in talks with the Brooklyn Academy about paying some of the concert costs for future seasons. Separately, Mr. Collins said a recent lawsuit filed against the orchestra by a composer was “totally without merit.” The composer, Nathan Currier, accused the Brooklyn Philharmonic of truncating his two-hour work during a performance in 2004 to avoid paying overtime to the musicians."

2009-04-17T00:00:00Z,"It is a story whose outlines are already well-known. Last week, the 20-member crew of an American cargo ship foiled a pirate hijacking attempt hundreds of miles off the coast of Somalia. Their captain, in the process, became a hostage in a lifeboat, floating at sea for four days until Navy sharpshooters killed his pirate captors. But just how the unarmed crew regained control of their ship -- and how the captain ended up in an enclosed orange lifeboat -- have remained murky. On Thursday, the 19 crew members sketched a fuller picture of what took place. No doubt the captain, Richard Phillips, who left Mombasa, Kenya, and is expected back in the United States on Friday, will be able to fill in many of the details."

More important, there are signs that Premier Wen Jiabao's $585 billion stimulus is taking effect. The problem now isn't the efficacy of the medicine but the severity of the side effects. On their own, gross domestic product figures don't mean much. They reflect what was, not what will be, and in China their reliability is always questionable."

The cyclist, Tony Fadell, an Apple engineer who led the iPod and iPhone design teams, and I grinned at each other, but we had to sympathize with the driver's plight. Perhaps more than any region, Silicon Valley has transformed the world in the last half century. Yet exploring -- or even finding -- this patchwork quilt of high-tech research and development centers, factories and California suburbia can be baffling.

For some, his decline began as early as 1914, when he and Braque went their separate ways after inventing Cubism. Others deferred until the arrival of the bourgeois Olga Khokhlova in 1917, or the pliant Marie-Thérèse Walter in 1927, or the end of World War II. But the mid-1950s have been generally accepted as the point of no return."

Graduated Wharton in 1957: Joined older brother Morton in Seaman's Furniture and grew to second largest retail furniture chain in US before sold in 1987. Carl went on to develop ETI Financial Corp., and Seminole Casualty Insurance Co. in Florida. He always loved the people who worked for and with him. A devout gold investor since 1979, he wanted you to invest in gold (or oil and gas) for your own good. A sports fan from birth-to-death he enthralled in the Brooklyn Dodgers as a boy, and was often seen inside Ebbets Field before pre-game practice had begun. Duke Snider was the greatest. The Dodgers' move? Unforgivable! But not Mr. O'Malley's fault (see Robert Moses). Later, devotee of the football Giants, Knicks, Islanders, Mets, and Tar Heels, he could be seen dressing like Walt Frazier and working quietly at home with the game on the radio and a cigar in his mouth. He loved lifting weights. Also propped up candy industry in good times and bad, he once considered malted milk balls a healthy snack (milk), and did not believe it necessary to eat at any restaurant fancier than Wendy's (maybe a diner). Really, why do you have to be so ""fancy""? He did love his cats. Linus was a mensch; Butch and Sunny great, too. A philanthropist as well, Carl Seaman and family were instrumental in the development of carrier testing for familial dysautonomia, and virtually eliminating new cases of this terrible (primarily Jewish) disease. He supported many other important causes as well through his Julius Ada Foundation, including North Shore Child and Family Guidance, in Roslyn, Long Island. Success did not spoil Carl Seaman, and he would never be a member of any club that would have someone like him as a member. Now, at the great Ebbets Field in the sky, he is ordering a ""smaller piece"" of cake for each of his many childhood heroes that are already there. Yes, Clem Labine would have struck out Bobby Thompson, and if you think that some of today's games are not ""fixed"", you don't watch sports. ""This was a man."" Memorial Service to be announced.

After video recordings of his plots were played in court, Wesam al-Delaema, 36, an Iraqi-born Dutch citizen, was sentenced by Judge Paul L. Friedman in United States District Court in Washington for conspiring to kill Americans in Iraq. But because the sentence will be served in the Netherlands, Mr. Delaema may spend much less than a quarter-century behind bars. Under an agreement between the United States and the Netherlands, Mr. Delaema was extradited to the United States two years ago on condition that he be tried in a civilian court and that he be returned to the Netherlands to serve his sentence. ''I didn't agree to that,'' Judge Friedman said Wednesday. ''The executive branch did.''

He talked to the ball, got down on his knees to manicure the mound, congratulated his teammates and took a postgame curtain call as the cheers rained down at Tiger Stadium.It's no surprise that game is so well remembered. It was shown on ABC's ""Monday Night Baseball,"" which at the time was one of only a few nationally televised games that fans could watch. For Fidrych, the timing was perfect.Although he had a 7-1 record going into the game, even Warner Wolf, who called the game for ABC, was relatively unfamiliar with Fidrych, a 21-year-old rookie. His broadcast partner, Bob Uecker, had seen Fidrych pitch an 11-inning complete game against the Milwaukee Brewers earlier in the season and told Wolf that he was in for a treat.""Uecker told me: 'Warner, you got to see this kid.

Now, some winter visitors are stopping to fly fish at one of California's most fabled trout streams, although not everyone seems pleased. Hot Creek is in a valley framed by the Sierra to the west and the Glass and Inyo Mountains to the east. This is volcano country, formed by a huge eruption 760,000 years ago. Earthquakes still rattle ski condominiums, and geothermal springs provide water to Hot Creek that is mixed with mountain snowmelt from Mammoth Creek. The result is mineral-rich water with stable year-round water temperatures ideal for trout."

She was born in Windsor, CT on August 6, 1917 to Arthur Howe and Margaret Armstrong Howe. Alice grew up in Windsor, CT, Hanover, NH, and Hampton, VA, where her father was an educator and administrator at Taft School, Dartmouth College and Hampton Institute. Her mother was self-employed in her later years managing the family-owned resort Rockywold-Deephaven Camps on Squam Lake, NH, that became the center of her family's life over the years. It was on a Vassar Outing Club trip to Mt. Moosilauke, NH that Alice met her husband, Briggs M. Austin, who was on a similar climb with Dartmouth's Outing Club. Throughout their life together, they traveled and enjoyed mountain and wilderness areas on foot and by canoe, both overseas and in Missoula where they retired in 1975. In Rochester, NY, Alice taught elementary grades in the inner-city schools and worked for Planned Parenthood, living out her deep commitment to social justice and equality started in the family by her grandfather, General Samuel Chapman Armstrong, who, at the end of the Civil War, founded Hampton Institute, the first college for black students. Through her volunteer efforts in preserving the natural environment, Alice became well known in Missoula and derived great pleasure in serving the community."

2009-04-19T00:00:00Z,"In 1985, a brash new pop star named Madonna, channeling Marilyn Monroe and surrounded by a chorus of men proffering diamonds, declared that we were “living in a material world” — a proposition that at the time seemed provocative and even a little crass. By today’s standards, the song’s music video, a campy anthem to ’80s excess, looks unbelievably quaint: the party was just getting started. And now it’s over. We woke up one morning to discover that we had too many toys and no retirement. Somewhere along the way, our entire economy came to be based on consuming stuff. Waving the flag for those who persist in the belief that shopping will be our salvation, Louis Vuitton’s ad campaign this season features the Material Girl herself."

2009-04-19T00:00:00Z,"More Serpentine Gallery than Safeway, the supermarket chain Mpreis is the unlikely patron of some of Austria’s best architecture. Founded in 1920 in Innsbruck, the family-owned company started taking architecture seriously in the early 1980s. Now most of the chain’s 156 locations are light-filled pavilions that are made out of such gourmet materials as structural glass, perforated steel, poured concrete and raw birch timbers. The chain is based in the Tyrolean Alps, and the most striking stores take full advantage of the dramatic mountain backdrops. Every Mpreis is different — no cookie-cutter here — designed by architects who range from international stars like Dominique Perrault to regional talents like Peter Lorenz. No wonder Mpreis was selected in 2004 to represent Austria for the architecture Biennale di Venezia. A new store is scheduled to open this summer in Wildschönau-Oberau, a secluded village with good skiing. There, Helmut Seelos of Seelos Architekten will turn a 40-year-old stucco market into a sleek wood-shingled box, the 21st collaboration between Mpreis and the architect. “Those clients who care about architecture are the ones we like,” Seelos said. “We like Mpreis.” [?][?][?] OLIVER SCHWANER-ALBRIGHT."
2009-04-19T00:00:00Z,"Depending on how you look at it, “Baroque 16201800: Style in the Age of Magnificence” is either a glorious romp through the original age of excess or a cautionary tale about making a sensible decorating budget and sticking to it. The exhibition, which is at the Victoria and Albert Museum in London through July 19, traces the proliferation of the Baroque style through all manner of things gilded and grandiose — from paintings by Peter Paul Rubens and this Bavarian monstrance (below) to the Duchess of Devonshire’s silver-gilt toilet service and a rare Louis XIV cabinet. Such opulent objects were expressions not so much of contemporary good taste but rather of wealth and power at a time when those who had them were not in the least afraid to flaunt them.

2009-04-19T00:00:00Z,"It’s difficult to imagine that the wisdom of the Italian design maestro Bruno Munari once seemed unfashionable. And yet his about-to-be-reissued 1971 manifesto, “Design as Art” — in which he urges his peers to create everyday objects rather than elitist masterpieces — spent more than two decades out of print. In the excess-happy 1980s, Munari’s suggestions — that expensive utensils be tossed in favor of chopsticks or that a lamp should actually look like a lamp — seemed curmudgeonly. Now his preoccupations look a lot like our own: furniture must be constructed so that “out of a flat box comes a three-dimensional object” (the flatpack); a designer should study “the structures of nature, observing the evolution of forms” (biomimicry); the designer should always be prepared to “step down from his pedestal” and “make a sign for a butcher’s shop” (recession).

2009-04-19T00:00:00Z,"When Russel Wright’s American Modern dinnerware first appeared in 1939, it brought unfussy elegance straight to the table. Each piece, designed with the eye and hand in mind, presented a wonderfully refined silhouette — a creamer as stout as a Disney dwarf, a water pitcher as sleek as a heron in flight. Manufactured until 1959 by Steubenville Pottery in Ohio, American Modern became one of the best-selling tableware lines in history. After a lackluster attempt by Oneida to bring American Modern to the masses via Bed Bath and Beyond in 2002 (curves were deleted, sizes amped up, and the 16 new, uninflected colors were reminiscent of Necco Wafers), Russel Wright Studios — under the direction of the designer’s daughter, Annie Wright, and the industrial designer Patrick Dickson — is taking American Modern back into its own hands. A collaboration with Bauer Pottery of Los Angeles, the new version captures the delicate forms and luminous palette of the originals, including radiant chartreuse and sea-foam blue in newly formulated glazes. “We also thought it was important to include Russel’s perfect tea tumbler,” Dickson says. “Because sustainable design isn’t just about recyclables. It’s about good design that can go on forever.” This time around, let’s hope so. [?][?][?] SUSAN MORGAN."

Even spacesuits aren’t immune to the changing winds of style — one minute it’s gold-visored helmets, the next it’s all about blue silicone soles. “Spacesuits: Within the Collections of the Smithsonian National Air and Space Museum” (Powerhouse Books), written and compiled by the museum’s resident space historian Amanda Young, showcases the most interesting of the 3,000 intergalactic artifacts from the Smithsonian vaults, many of which have not been shown to the public until now. Highlights include the campy, custom-made aluminized suits worn by the “Mercury Seven” for their first mission (the filmmaker Michel Gondry would be over the moon) and a pair of astro gloves from 1967 that feature sharkskin pads and pressure-resistant stainless steel “fingernails.” While NASA no longer offers bespoke suits for its astronauts, it recently hired a new company, Oceaneering International, to revamp its look.

The one-off bench, which cost around $250,000 to produce, takes its name from a creative spelling of the Spanish for “yours and mine,” signifying Gehry’s realization that the design is better suited to two people than to one. For now, Tuyomyo is a charitable venture; after its debut this month at the Milan Furniture Fair, the bench will be sold at auction in New York later this year to support the Hereditary Disease Foundation, Gehry’s favorite charity.

Bergdoll, after all, is the chief curator of architecture and design at the Museum of Modern Art and freely admits to being “an old-fashioned cliché modernist.” Still, even modernists need light. The two men (Ryall, a New York architect, designed the house) had searched in vain for the perfect light fixture for the kitchen, a double-height room that is the focal point of the house. And the focus of the focus had to be special. Then they saw the Zettel’z Hanging Lamp by Ingo Maurer. On sale. Bergdoll was familiar with it — it’s in MoMA’s collection — and thought it might work. A sprightly nimbus of wires with small clips clasping little paper notes, it could stand for the kind of jotted informality of kitchen communiqués (messages, lists, recipes) and not be confused with “decoration.” At first, they used the notes that came with the chandelier. “We were unbelievably respectful of it,” Bergdoll said."

Graduated Wharton in 1957: Joined older brother Morton in Seaman's Furniture and grew to second largest retail furniture chain in US before sold in 1987. Carl went on to develop ETI Financial Corp., and Seminole Casualty Insurance Co. in Florida. He always loved the people who worked for and with him. A devout gold investor since 1979, he wanted you to invest in gold (or oil and gas) for your own good. A sports fan from birth-to-death he enthralled in the Brooklyn Dodgers as a boy, and was often seen inside Ebbets Field before pre-game practice had begun. Duke Snider was the greatest. The Dodgers' move? Unforgivable! But not Mr. O'Malley's fault (see Robert Moses). Later, devotee of the football Giants, Knicks, Islanders, Mets, and Tar Heels, he could be seen dressing like Walt Frazier and working quietly at home with the game on the radio and a cigar in his mouth. He loved lifting weights. Also propped up candy industry in good times and bad, he once considered malted milk balls a healthy snack (milk), and did not believe it necessary to eat at any restaurant fancier than Wendy's (maybe a diner). Really, why do you have to be so ""fancy""? He did love his cats. Linus was a mensch; Butch and Sunny great, too. A philanthropist as well, Carl Seaman and family were instrumental in the development of carrier testing for familial dysautonomia, and virtually eliminating new cases of this terrible (primarily Jewish) disease. He supported many other important causes as well through his Julius Ada Foundation, including North Shore Child and Family Guidance, in Roslyn, Long Island. Success did not spoil Carl Seaman, and he would never be a member of any club that would have someone like him as a member. Now, at the great Ebbets Field in the sky, he is ordering a ""smaller piece"" of cake for each of his many childhood heroes that are already there.

Long affiliated with Queens College and Columbia University, Wu was the author of The Confucian's Progress, a book on the origins and history of autobiography in China. Professor Wu was born in Nanking in 1927, the son of Ou Tsin-Chen, Vice-Minister of Education in the Nationalist government and Ni Lian, Professor of Psychology and Statistics at National Taiwan University. After receiving an undergraduate degree in Foreign Literature from Nanking University in 1948, he emigrated to the United States where he received various degrees. Among them were an MA in Mathematics and a doctorate in East Asian Languages and Culture. Both these degrees were from Columbia. In 1967 Professor Wu became a full time member of the Queens College faculty, retiring in 1996 with the rank of full professor. During the last thirty years of his life, Pei-Yi Wu was an adjunct professor at Columbia University. His signature course was Directed Readings. It examined classical and modern Chinese texts. He gained recognition for his work on Confucian guilt, self-examination, autobiography, the history of childhood, Chinese women warriors and the literature of pilgrimage. The work on autobiography culminated in The Confucian's Progress (Princeton, 1990). To quote, Philip Kuhn, a close friend, ""PY's diverse circle of friends will continue to revere his invincible skepticism, his inter-cultural curiosity and his belief that the human condition is grave but not serious"". Pei-Yi Wu is survived by his sisters, Helen Pei-Ping Chang and Pei-Ching Chen, his nephews, Julius Chang and Raymond Chen, and his long time companion, Mary Jo Robertiello."

2009-04-19T00:00:00Z,"LEFKOWITZ--Estelle Ruth, MD, 74, passed on March 31, 2009 due to complications of cancer. Daughter of Anne and William Rosenburg of Brooklyn NY. She was born September 22, 1934. She attended Brooklyn College, graduated from the University of Geneva School of Medicine in 1960, interned at Newton Wellesley Hospital, and was a fellow in Oncology at Yale New Haven Hospital. She established her own practice in Oncology in Mount Kisco, NY 1972, and was a physician with old-world values, who dedicated over 30 years to her patients and her profession. She always gave of herself and cared for those in need, continuing to make house calls until she retired. During college she was a competitive swimmer. As an adult she became an enthusiastic collector of antiques, glassware, and jewelry, and a true lover of the theatre, arts, world travel, animals, and beautiful vistas. She was well known for her storytelling, infectious laughter, world class cuisine, and entertaining. She was a loving and dedicated wife of over 50 years, a mother, role model and mentor to her three children and five grandchildren. She is survived by her husband, Marty; children, Bill, Mia and Mark; grandchildren, Samantha, Molly, Joseph, Jacob and Isabella, and brother Herman. She was one of those special people in this world, who had a joie de vivre that was unforgettable. She had a big heart and would have liked to have cared for the whole world. She gave more to us than she'll ever know, and she will be remembered, celebrated and deeply missed. We love you."

For football games, that middle group of toilets becomes male territory. For a grade school teachers conference, the middle group of toilets becomes female territory. No firm rules for potty parity will ever work for all groups.Dennie Van Tassel"

2009-04-19T00:00:00Z,"In the sprawling city of Addis Ababa, Ethiopia, where contemporary architecture tends toward the straight and angular -- blue glass high-rises, narrow makeshift shops constructed from repurposed shipping containers -- the house that Elias Sime has spent the past decade hand-building from mud and straw is an anachronism. Round shelters known as tukuls, made from unbaked earth, thatched straw and green timber poles, have been part of the region's architectural heritage since before the Queen of Sheba. Still, this is an artist's house. Its organic, circular structure, intricately carved walls and woven roof appear like a voluptuous dream, a swirl of ancient techniques and ecstatic imagination. Born in 1968, Sime grew up in Addis Ababa during the Derg era, Ethiopia's 12-year period of Communist military rule. As a child, he taught himself to sew, embroider and repair furniture. His widower father, a road construction foreman, recognized his son's gift and supported his desire to become an artist. ''In Ethiopia, most families do not encourage their children to become artists unless they are descended from traditional ceramicists, carvers, painters, blacksmiths or weavers,'' observes Meskerem Assegued, a curator and the director of the Zoma Center for Contemporary Art in Addis Ababa. ''In many parts of the country, artists and craftspeople are considered almost subhuman, with the power to use their 'evil eye' to harm the public.''"
2009-04-19T00:00:00Z,"The emphasis by Lisa Belkin on the lower intelligence of children born to older fathers (April 5) is potentially intimidating and misleading. In several of my texts, I cite studies to the contrary from different cultures (France; Scotland; Israeli students of Asian-African origin) wherein achievement actually may increase as a function of birth order in large families. Indeed, the extensive study of historically famous persons by Ivor Aleksachin and Andrei Tkatschenk concluded that the fathers of 2,000 men of genius were predominantly older than 30 years, whereas the age of their mothers played no significant role.

And so staunchly defended: Boys avail themselves most frequently of epithets like ''fag'' to ''police'' one another's behavior and bring it back to being sufficiently masculine when someone steps out of line, found Barbara J. Risman, a sociologist at the University of Illinois at Chicago, while conducting extensive interviews in a Southeastern urban middle school in 2003 and 2004.

There were once Iranian cafes at nearly every corner in south Mumbai. Originated by Iranian immigrants in the 19th century, they provided cheap food and good company in a leisurely -- though often rather grimy -- setting. Many have vanished, but those that have survived have kept prices low and their ambience intact.

His still-life portraits, which have appeared in publications like Another Magazine and Italian Glamour, often play up the eroticism that lurks below the surface of, say, a B&B Italia armchair. He once placed a fur hat on the tip of a phallic pink balloon sculpture (far right) and enjoys creating female forms out of luxury accessories. (Another example of his work is at center.) ''Our society is very conscious of the body,'' he says. ''In a way, it is our big fetish.'' Inspired by the idea of ''a nice sunny day at the pool,'' Borsodi shot the best new outdoor furniture for ''Sunny Side Up'' on Page 84. ''Many of the products in my images relate very much to our psyche -- our society, our vanities, our insecurities.'' If that sounds like some armchair philosophizing, Borsodi's aim is actually quite succinct: ''What can an object tell us about a person?''"

2009-04-19T00:00:00Z,"There are two words that should give every N.F.L. team hope when the draft starts next Saturday: Matt Ryan. Two more? Joe Flacco. At this time last year, Ryan and Flacco were quarterback prospects generating considerable questions, and Atlanta and Baltimore were losing teams embarking on rebuilding. Then the Falcons chose Ryan, the Ravens maneuvered for Flacco and the rest is playoff history. As rookies, Ryan and Flacco proved that adept drafting really can instantly reverse a franchise's fortunes. Is Matthew Stafford, out of Georgia, the next Ryan or Flacco? And who will have the nerve to find out Saturday if Stafford or Southern California's Mark Sanchez can make the transition as smoothly? Quarterbacks are always the draft-day stars, but this draft is loaded with offensive linemen and receivers. With not much delineation between players who could go in the first few picks and the middle of the first round - the draft analyst Gil Brandt said he believed there were 23 players who could be taken in the top 10 - and so much money due players who go in the first few spots, expect the teams near the top of the draft list to try to trade down to get more bang for their buck. Here is a look at each team's needs going into the draft. (Position of first-round picks in parentheses.) AMERICAN CONFERENCE East Buffalo Bills (11, 28) No draft pick is going to change the Bills more than Terrell Owens will, but getting a tight end and shoring up the offensive line would help Owens, too. And the Bills have to upgrade in the pass rush, which was awful last year. Jets (17) At least one of the top three quarterbacks could still be on the board when the Jets pick in the first round. Moving on from the messy Brett Favre experiment is the Jets' greatest need. But if they stick with a training-camp battle between Kellen Clemens and Brett Ratliff, they have to get a big-time wide receiver to ease their quarterback's path. New England Patriots (23) With 4 of the first 58 picks - and with holes in the secondary and at running back filled in free agency - Coach Bill Belichick can add more youth and speed to his defense. Miami Dolphins (25) Their needs do not seem quite as desperate as last year's, but to keep the progress going, the Dolphins need upgrades at receiver and across the board on defense, especially at cornerback. North Cleveland Browns (5) Whoever becomes their starting quarterback will find major issues at receiver, including Donté Stallworth's legal situation. But with Eric Mangini in charge, they will try to rebuild the pass rush, too. If linebacker Aaron Curry is on the board when Cleveland picks at No. 5, he will be tempting. Cincinnati Bengals (6) The Bengals have spent their last four first-round picks on defense. Now it is time to shore up the offense again. Carson Palmer's elbow should be healthy again, but to keep it that way, the Bengals need reinforcements on the offensive line. If they really want to make Palmer feel good, they will get him a pass-catching tight end or another receiver. Baltimore Ravens (26) Now that the Ravens have solved a decade-long quarterback problem with Flacco, they could use a top-notch receiver from a deep class to pair with him. Pittsburgh Steelers (32) The Super Bowl champions are some of the best drafters around, so expect them to go for a cornerback to replace Bryant McFadden and perhaps another offensive lineman. South Jacksonville Jaguars (8) The Jaguars should get one of the top players in the draft. They can use it -- at wide receiver, on both lines, and at linebacker and in the secondary. Houston Texans (15) With the dynamic offense in great shape, it will be all defense, all the time for the Texans. Look for them to go for linebackers and defensive backs. Indianapolis Colts (27) There has been a lot of change with the Colts -- farewell, Tony Dungy, and good luck finding another job, Marvin Harrison -- but as in recent years, the defense needs a few upgrades, particularly at linebacker and on the interior defensive line. Any offensive picks are for depth only. Tennessee Titans (30) The Titans do not need much to remain competitive. They have already replaced the departed Albert Haynesworth, but could use quality pickups at wide receiver and at linebacker to fill out a strong roster. West Kansas City Chiefs (3) Almost everybody expects that General Manager Scott Pioli will take Wake Forest linebacker Aaron Curry, perhaps the best player in the draft, with the third pick to address the Chiefs' woeful pass rush and begin building a defense in the Patriots' image. Oakland Raiders (7) If JaMarcus Russell is ever going to become a real force, he is going to have to have a go-to receiver. The Raiders don't have anything close right now. Denver Broncos (12, 18) The Broncos have a boatload of picks from the Jay Cutler trade, 2 in the first 18 over all. Despite an active free agency, they need a lot of help in shifting their defense to a 3-4. But the questions remain: Is Kyle Orton really their quarterback, or will they take one this year? San Diego Chargers (16) The biggest addition will be getting Shawne Merriman back, but the Chargers lost Igor Olshansky this off-season, and finding a defensive end to replace him is a priority. NATIONAL CONFERENCE East Washington Redskins (13) From Dan Snyder's off-season activity, you might think the Redskins need a quarterback. Not so much. They do need an offensive tackle and help on the defensive line and at linebacker. But Snyder likes to ''win'' free agency and the draft with splashy acquisitions, so don't rule anything out. Philadelphia Eagles (21) For a conference finalist, the Eagles need plenty: a running back to take some heat off Brian Westbrook, a go-to receiver for Donovan McNabb and reinforcements for both lines and the secondary. Oh, yes, and somebody who can possibly replace Brian Dawkins's leadership. Giants (29) Even before they sent Plaxico Burress packing, the Giants needed a receiver. Now the need for a tall, red-zone threat is more acute than ever. Maybe a Braylon Edwards trade will finally come together, but if it doesn't, the Giants have to find Burress's replacement. Dallas Cowboys (none) You cannot draft peace and quiet, which is what the Cowboys need most of all. In lieu of that, the Cowboys need depth on the offensive line and on defense. But this is still a talented team and the departures of Adam Jones, safety Roy Williams and Terrell Owens can only help. North Detroit Lions (1, 20) When you're 0-16, what don't you need? The new coach, Jim Schwartz, comes from the defensive side, and the Lions need help front to back on defense. But if they're going to pay the big money that the first overall pick commands, they need a quarterback - and a franchise face - who can lead the long rebuilding slog. Plus, Matthew Stafford actually wants to play for Detroit. Green Bay Packers (9) Don't blame Aaron Rodgers for the Packers' downfall last year. He got little help from the running game and an ineffective offensive line, and the defense was dreadful. Green Bay is switching to the 3-4 defense, which means it needs a nose tackle. Minnesota Vikings (22) Let's assume they are going to choose between Tarvaris Jackson and Sage Rosenfels at quarterback. The Vikings had better protect whomever they choose - last year they gave up 43 sacks, making the drafting of a tackle a near necessity. Chicago Bears (none) The Bears have already made their biggest acquisition of this off-season, when they traded for quarterback Jay Cutler. They don't have a pick until the 49th over all, but they'll need a No. 1 receiver to keep Cutler happy and a cornerback so that Cutler doesn't find himself in too many shootouts. South New Orleans Saints (14) Drew Brees and his offensive teammates can set all the records they like, but if the Saints don't upgrade their defense, it will be for nothing. Jonathan Vilma could use some help at linebacker. Tampa Bay Buccaneers (19) The Buccaneers still don't have a franchise quarterback and they could draft one. But they also need a lot of parts for their gutted defense, particularly in the front seven. Atlanta Falcons (24) They got the offense straightened out faster than anybody imagined. Now it's time for help on defense, especially on the defensive line. Carolina Panthers (none) On paper, the Panthers don't need much to contend again. But if they wind up trading the disgruntled defensive end Julius Peppers, it will leave an enormous hole in the pass rush that they will have to fill immediately. West St. Louis Rams (2) Their fingers are probably crossed that the Lions don't take tackle Jason Smith, who could replace Orlando Pace. They also need a receiver to take over for Torry Holt. Lucky for the Rams, this draft is flush at both positions. Seattle Seahawks (4) Their passing defense was abysmal last season, so they could use the fourth overall pick on a pass rusher. San Francisco 49ers (10) Maybe it's time to finally give up on Alex Smith and draft a quarterback. The Niners could move down and still get Mark Sanchez or Josh Freeman if Matthew Stafford doesn't somehow fall to them. Arizona Cardinals (31) That passing game sure is exciting, but how about another running back to bring some balance, and to relieve some pressure on the not-getting-any-younger Kurt Warner?"

Alice grew up in Windsor, CT, Hanover, NH, and Hampton, VA, where her father was an educator and administrator at Taft School, Dartmouth College and Hampton Institute. Her mother was self-employed in her later years managing the family-owned resort Rockywold-Deephaven Camps on Squam Lake, NH, that became the center of her family's life over the years. It was on a Vassar Outing Club trip to Mt. Moosilauke, NH that Alice met her husband, Briggs M. Austin, who was on a similar climb with Dartmouth's Outing Club. Throughout their life together, they traveled and enjoyed mountain and wilderness areas on foot and by canoe, both overseas and in Missoula where they retired in 1975. In Rochester, NY, Alice taught elementary grades in the inner-city schools and worked for Planned Parenthood, living out her deep commitment to social justice and equality started in the family by her grandfather, General Samuel Chapman Armstrong, who, at the end of the Civil War, founded Hampton Institute, the first college for black students. Through her volunteer efforts in preserving the natural environment, Alice became well known in Missoula and derived great pleasure in serving the community."
2009-04-19T00:00:00Z,"ANDREOLI--Thomas E.,M.D., passed away on April 14, 2009 due to a cerebrovascular accident. A devoted husband, father, grandfather, physician, mentor and friend, Dr. Andreoli was born on January 9, 1935 in The Bronx, New York. He received his B.S., cum laude, from St. Vincent College in 1956 and his M.D., magna cum laude, from Georgetown University in 1960. It was as a resident in Internal Medicine and fellowship at Duke University, where under the mentorship of Eugene Stead he crystallized his vision for academic internal medicine departments. After solidifying his training in basic science at the Laboratory of Intermediary Metabolism at the NIH, he was appointed to the faculty at Duke University where he trained with Roscoe R.

2009-04-19T00:00:00Z,"Although central Essex County has remained an oasis from the worst of the nation's real estate meltdown, there is still the occasional housing horror story -- like the sorry tale of 572 Prospect Street in Maplewood. A gracious six-bedroom brick Tudor -- with wood floors, high ceilings, a one-bedroom carriage house and nanny's suite -- the house was put up for sale in the heady days of March 2007 at an asking price of $899,000. Within a month, the owners received an offer within $40,000 below the asking price. A deal never materialized, but in an era of bidding wars and easy credit -- when Maplewood homes routinely sold for 99 percent of asking price -- it was completely reasonable to expect that another buyer might come along to snatch it up soon."

With Davies following Gil Meche and Zack Greinke, the Royals could match three starters with virtually anyone. Carlos Marmol has not displaced Kevin Gregg as the Cubs' closer -- yet. He got his second save Friday because he was already warming up to pitch the ninth inning with Chicago trailing when the Cubs took a one-run lead in the eighth.

Reality check,says David Wilson, president of the Graduate Management AdmissionCouncil, makers of the GMAT: ''Only a handful of M.B.A.'s go into financial services. Graduates may have to refocus their search, but there are going to be jobs out there.'' Meanwhile, his business is good:the number taking the GMAT is up 8 percent.

2009-04-19T00:00:00Z,"EARTH DAY is this Wednesday, and all things ''green'' will be celebrated. But it's worth asking: how environmentally friendly are ''green'' products, really? Consider, for example, this paragon of eco-virtue: the stainless steel water bottle that lets us hydrate without discarding endless plastic bottles. Using a method called life cycle assessment, we have evaluated the environmental and health impact of a stainless steel thermos -- from the extraction and processing of its ingredients, to its manufacture, distribution, use and final disposal. There were some surprises. What we think of as ''green'' turns out to be less so (and, yes, sometimes more so) than we assume."

On June 28, 1976, Fidrych pitched a complete-game victory over the Yankees in less than two hours. He talked to the ball, got down on his knees to manicure the mound, congratulated his teammates and took a postgame curtain call as the cheers rained down at Tiger Stadium. It's no surprise that game is so well remembered. It was shown on ABC's ''Monday Night Baseball,'' which at the time was one of only a few nationally televised games that fans could watch. For Fidrych, the timing was perfect."

The youngest of five siblings, Bernice put herself through school, earned a Bachelor's and Master's Degree from Columbia University. She became a teacher, selflessly giving to others, as she did throughout her life for family and friends. Her courage in fighting and beating ovarian cancer 14 years ago was an inspiration. The graceful but determined manner she fought a second cancer more than ten years later was an example to all. Her passion for family, from doting over her children growing up to nursing Irving back to health after he suffered a stroke, will remain part of her legacy.

A stylist, writer and editor at large for Elle Décor magazine, he is also the designer of Casa Carlos Mota, a collection of six polyester-silk flower arrangements with recession-friendly prices that are making their television debut (along with Mota himself) tonight on HSN. Mota has always loved silk flowers, but he didn't love their fusty reputation, or the daunting price tags of the better arrangements. As fate would have it, he was styling a photo shoot at the home of Mindy Grossman, the chief executive of HSN, and when she complimented Mota on his (fresh) flower-arranging skills, he promptly pitched the idea of a silk collection. The most expensive arrangement, of hydrangeas, is $49.95; the least expensive, a small bouquet of roses, is $29.95. All six are in white ceramic vases. A few months ago, Mota sent a sample arrangement of peonies and ranunculus ($39.95) to my office. At first, I felt a little sheepish with a bouquet of fake flowers on my desk and wondered whether people at work would see it as some kind of ironic, anti-design statement -- or whether they would just consider me deeply uncool. Instead, all they saw was a bunch of pretty blossoms, and soon, so did I. I've lost count of the number of colleagues, style mavens all, who walk by my workstation and exclaim, ""What beautiful flowers. Wait - are those real?"" And, as Mota points out, faux flowers just keep on giving: ""They offer unconditional love."""

2009-04-20T00:00:00Z,"LOWENSTEIN--Louis. We mourn the death of the firm's co-founder Louis Lowenstein, who practiced law with us from 1968 until 1978 when the firm was known as Kramer Lowenstein Nessen & Kamin. As a young man of 43 with energy and noble ambition, Lou led a group of departing lawyers from Hays, Aklar & Hertzberg to join Kramer, Nessen & Hochman in forming an upstart firm that was guided by a vision: creating an egalitarian, first class group of lawyers that would compete with the major firms of the day. Forty-one years later, the firm is one of the country's largest first-tier law firms. Lou was a brilliant legal strategist, deep thinker and a consummate professional who created and led the firm's corporate department and provided sage advice to diverse clients. Lou left private practice to accept the challenge of running a NYSE company and thereafter joined the faculty at Columbia Law School, from which he had graduated after serving as editor-in-chief of the Columbia Law Review. As an academic, Lou used his business saavy and practical experience to write and lecture on corporate governance, markets and finance; to direct the law school's institutional investor project; and to teach students as the Simon H. Rifkind professor emeritus of finance and law. Lou generously dedicated his extraordinary talents to a variety of philanthropic efforts, including unstinting service on behalf of the Coalition for the Homeless. He was a noble character and inspirational figure whose legacy continues to guide our law firm. To his beloved Helen and Roger, Jane, and Barbara we extend heartfelt sympathy. The partners, attorneys and staff of Kramer Levin Naftalis & Frankel LLP"

''If you get any weight on your right foot at impact, it's going to be easy to hit it fat or behind the ball. And hitting the wet grass behind the ball in the rain can lead to a pretty ugly shot -- lots of flying wet turf but the ball goes nowhere.''"

Imagem, which is owned by the Dutch pension fund ABP and the European media company CP Masters BV, said it had acquired the Rodgers & Hammerstein Organization, which handles licensing for the works of many composers including Irving Berlin, Andrew Lloyd Webber and Kurt Weill. Imagem said it would retain the current management of the Rodgers & Hammerstein Organization, including its president and executive director, Theodore S. Chapin. Terms of the deal were not disclosed.

Dr. Habermann graduated Johns Hopkins University, where he was awarded the Barton's Cup Award for outstanding student. He earned his medical degree from the State University of New York at Syracuse and did an internship at the University of California Medical Center in San Francisco. He later joined the U.S. Navy for two years as a medical officer. Upon discharge, Dr. Habermann did a residency in general and orthopaedic surgery at the Hospital for Joint Diseases in NYC. He became a full time staff member in orthopaedic surgery at Montefiore Medical Center and the Albert Einstein College of Medicine in 1966, where he rose to the rank of Chairman and University Professor of Orthopaedic Surgery. During his professional career, Dr. Habermann was a visiting professor at 122 universities and medical centers in the United States and abroad. He retired in 1998 and was given the rank of Chairman Emeritus of the Department of Orthopaedic Surgery and Professor Emeritus of both Orthopaedic Surgery and Radiology at Albert Einstein Medical College. In 1967, Dr. Habermann did a fellowship in hip surgery with Sir John Charnley, the pioneer of hip replacement surgery, at the Wrightington Hospital in England, and became one of the first orthopaedic surgeons in New York to introduce total joint replacement surgery. He also helped design and develop hip and knee replacement prostheses that are now implanted in over two million patients. Dr. Habermann volunteered for medical service in Israel during the 1967 and 1972 Arab-Israeli conflicts and, between 1968 and 1980, spent many weeks each year teaching in Israel, primarily at Hadassah Hospital.

He was active in his local community of Chappaqua, serving on the Parks and Recreation Commission and on the New Castle Community Television Board. He volunteered as assistant coach of Horace Greeley's varsity lacrosse and soccer teams. He also was an unofficial ""beach doctor"" at his summer home in Bridgehampton.

ABC announced Wednesday that “Millionaire” will return on Aug. 9, at 8 p.m. and will play on five consecutive nights that week and the following week. The finale will be broadcast on Aug. 23. “Millionaire” emerged as a hit show after its premiere in August 1999 and for the next three years various weeknight versions of it show ranked as the top-rated prime-time shows on television. “Millionaire” led ABC to the top of the network ratings that season. At its height, “Millionaire” was attracting about 29 million viewers. But ABC became heavily reliant on the show, running it as many as four times a week. By the end of 2001 its audience had dropped to 10 million viewers and ABC removed it from its schedule a year later. But the show has continued in syndication, and has been successful in other countries, especially where it has played as a once or twice a year tournament. Interest was also revived by the success of the film “Slumdog Millionaire,” which depicted the Indian version of the game show."

Earlier this month, JPMorgan filed a claim on the work, saying that Mr. Reijtenbagh owed it more than $23 million in unpaid loans. The painting was acquired from Mr. Reijtenbagh by the Rijksmuseum in Amsterdam in September, and is currently on loan to the National Gallery of Art in Washington until May 3."

2009-04-22T16:54:27Z,"The current exhibition at San Francisco's Fraenkel Gallery, ""Edward Hopper & Company,"" examines the celebrated American painter's work and its influence on photography. Although the curator Jeffrey Fraenkel writes in the show's catalog that Hopper had an impact on a wide range of photographers, in the show he selects just eight: Robert Adams, Diane Arbus, Harry Callahan, William Eggleston, Walker Evans, Robert Frank, Lee Friedlander and Stephen Shore. Displayed alongside their work is a small but diverse selection of Hopper's paintings and drawings that cover many of the artist's central themes of isolation and contemplation. The architectural cityscapes and rural landscapes are unadorned and unpretentious, perfect complements and, in most cases, antecedents to the matter-of-fact photography on view. Shore's near-dusk view of a movie theater and Adams's austere house on Interstate 25 are quite possibly the photographic equivalents of the painter's ""New York Corner"" and ""Lombard's House."" And in the work of Arbus, Frank and Friedlander, you can see the another frequent Hopper subject: the solitary, forlorn figure.

2009-04-22T11:28:08Z,"Tom Cruise has almost single-handedly propped up the script-doctoring business, Variety writes, as he has circled a half-dozen potential projects in search of his next starring role. Writers like Scott Frank, Richard Curtis and Paul Attanasio have been making as much as $250,000 a week, for anywhere from two to six weeks, to rewrite existing scripts to the persnickety star's specifications, all in the hopes that Mr. Cruise will choose that project over the others. At the moment, Variety says, the leading contenders are ""Motorcade,"" a thriller involving a presidential procession, ""The Tourist,"" another thriller about an American abroad who gets mixed up with Interpol agents (including Charlize Theron) and ""Wichita,"" a romantic comedy about an undercover agent and a woman (Cameron Diaz) who has trouble with the men in her life. Also in the mix is ""The Matarese Circle,"" based on the Robert Ludlum novel, about a pair of spies, a project that would team Mr. Cruise with Denzel Washington. An older post here on Slashfilm includes more details about the competing projects."

2009-04-22T10:45:00Z,"I'm sure some of you have seen the profile in May Vogue of Steven Meisel. If not, I encourage everyone to read it. Jonathan Van Meter, the writer of the piece, spends too much time at the start discussing Meisel's reclusive nature. Ultimately it doesn't matter if he is shy or mysterious or a chameleon; he has become an influential photographer with specific ideas about the work. I've done a couple of interviews with Meisel over the past decade and a half, and, as Van Meter notes, he is actually very forthcoming. What I like most about this profile are the details about Meisel's family, especially his parents, and how he started his career. Already a fashion illustrator at Women's Wear, he met Valerie Cates, the sister of Phoebe Cates, while she was shopping, and began taking pictures of the sisters on weekends. Then he was asked by Elite to take test shots of new models. He did the hair, makeup and styling himself, he told Van Meter. ""I didn't know any different,"" he said. Anyway, there's a lot of fascinating stuff here-about Meisel, New York, and of course the supers. The profile features a self-portrait taken in a barber shop in the West Village, with Meisel surrounded by the models whose careers he helped launch. The issue, timed for the opening of the Costume Institute's ""The Model as Muse"" exhibit in early May, also includes an interesting piece (by Hamish Bowles) about Marc Jacobs."

For a simple flatbread, for example, take one part whole wheat flour (let's say a cup), combine it with just a bit more water (about 1 1/4 cups, usually, though it varies with the moisture content of the air and therefore the flour) and a large pinch of salt. Place enough olive oil (say, a couple of tablespoons) in a large skillet, then pour the batter in and bake it in a hot oven until firm and lightly browned."

The cuts, which were reported Friday in The Washington Post, also include reductions in medical benefit contributions and the addition of unpaid holidays. They follow layoffs of 64 people, or 7% of the staff, in December, because of a revenue shortfall. Employees at the vice presidential level and above will absorb additional cuts. Merit pay increases scheduled for January 2010 are being eliminated, and 18 unfilled positions are either being eliminated or temporarily frozen. Corporate underwriting has continued to drop since December, Anna Christopher, a spokeswoman for NPR, said. The new cuts add up to savings of about $17 million over the two fiscal years, which is more than the $15 million deficit that NPR has forecast. Most of the staff cuts are in the areas of information technology, legal services and communications and won’t affect programming, NPR said."

2009-04-24T10:30:21Z,"Thirteen paintings said to have been made by Hitler were sold Thursday for a total of about $143,000 at an auction in Shropshire in Britain, Reuters reported. The works, which are believed to date from the early 1900s, when Hitler was still a struggling artist with unfulfilled aspirations of entering Vienna’s Academy of Arts, included an oil painting of an Alpine landscape (which sold for about $19,700) and a possible self-portrait (which sold for about $14,600). Richard Westwood-Brookes, a historical documents specialist who ran the sale for the British auction house Mullock’s, told Reuters that “people do not want to acquire these for their artistic merit; they just want to have something that belonged to someone famous from history.” Though the artworks were signed “A. Hitler” or “A.H.” and certified by an Austrian expert, Mr. Westwood-Brookes said no one could be completely certain they were painted by Hitler."

The findings provide ''tantalizing clues to explain 'the essence of bovinity,' '' according to an essay in the journal Science, which is publishing several articles on the work. ''The cows have not disappointed us,'' wrote Harris A. Lewin, an animal sciences professor at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, noting that the research had fulfilled its promise to provide ''exciting new information'' about the evolution of mammals and the workings of their genes. The cow whose genome was sequenced was a Hereford named L1 Dominette 01449, above, one of the 94 million cows in the United States, where cattle are a $49 billion industry. The project was a six-year effort that involved more than 300 scientists from 25 countries and cost $53 million. Cows have about 22,000 genes. Scientists say the new information may help them find ways to improve meat and milk production and resistance to disease, and to reduce the amount of heat-trapping gases released by herds of cows."

JC Wynn died on March 31, 2009 at 88 years of age in Catonsville, Maryland where he lived with his wife Rachel at the Charlestown Retirement Community. He grew up in Johnstown, PA, where he graduated from high school. After completing his major in philosophy at The College of Wooster and graduate work at Yale Divinity School, Rev. Wynn was ordained in 1944 and served as associate pastor at the First Presbyterian Church in Evanston, Illinois, and subsequently as pastor of the Presbyterian Church of El Dorado, Kansas. He developed a specialty in the field of marriage, family and sexuality, and was appointed in 1950 as Director of Family Education for the Presbyterian Board of Christian Education in Philadelphia. This led to Wynn's pioneering work in the field for the denomination through numerous articles, books, lecturing, and conferences. He became the chairman on the Commission on Sexuality in the Human Community, served on the Committee on the Family for the National Council of Churches and the Family Council at the World Council of Churches, and helped to write the Vatican-Protestant report on inter-faith marriage. Dr. Wynn was a fellow of the American Association of Marriage and Family Counseling, and a member of the national clergy committee for Planned Parenthood, among others. He wrote or edited nine books on marriage therapy and family issues. Dr. Wynn received his MA and Doctor of Education degrees from Columbia University, as well as a Doctor of Divinity degree from Davis and Elkins College. He joined the inter-denominational faculty of Colgate Rochester Divinity School in Rochester, New York in 1960, where he developed and administered an innovative doctoral (Doctor of Ministry) program in family therapy that graduated many ministers, priests, rabbis, and nuns over a period of 28 years until his retirement. During those years, he was a frequent guest lecturer at Wesley Theological Seminary in Washington, Union Theological Seminary, San Francisco Theological Seminary and at colleges throughout the US, Canada, South Africa, Lesotho, and Korea. In retirement, Dr. Wynn lectured and served on various committees as a member of the Presbytery of Baltimore, Maryland, ministered locally to residents of Charlestown, and taught seminars there on philosophy, especially on Plato. A memorial service was held on April 13 at Charlestown Retirement Community, Catonsville, MD. Memorial gifts may be sent to The Wynn Fund for Family Ministries, Colgate Rochester Divinity School, 1100 S. Goodman St., Rochester, NY 14620.

2009-04-24T00:00:00Z,"DILLON--Thomas E. April 18, 1946 April 15, 2009. Thomas Edward Dillon was the first of six children born to Shirley and Thomas J. Dillon of San Francisco. Even from childhood, he had a keen sense of wonder and a hunger for knowledge, spending hours reading through encyclopedias. Tom was immensely grateful for his loving family, and had tremendous gratitude for his parents' love and example. He cherished many fond memories of growing up with his siblings, Nancy, Tim, John, Mary, and Robert. He was deeply saddened by the loss of his own father, whom he described as his hero, only a few years ago. Tom married the love of his life, Theresa Ann Corkery, on March 4, 1967. They were not only husband and wife, but also best friends. Tom had a great sense of humor and he could always make Terri laugh. They complemented one another perfectly. The Dillons were blessed with 42 years of marriage, four children, and 15 grandchildren. One of Tom's greatest joys was spending time with Terri and their children. He delighted in playing ping-pong with his youngest son, Danny, and loved to chronicle his family members' lives through his passion for photography. Tom had a true appreciation for beauty, and nowhere did he treasure it more than in his own family. A graduate of St. Mary's College of California, with masters and doctoral degrees in philosophy from the University of Notre Dame, Dr. Dillon devoted the last 38 years of his life to advancing and sustaining Catholic liberal education at Thomas Aquinas College in Santa Paula. Appointed to the college's teaching faculty in 1972, he served as assistant dean for student affairs from 1976 to 1981; he then served as academic dean from 1981 until his appointment as president in 1991. Throughout that time, he took great pride in the college's growing reputation for excellence, as well as in its alumni, which include 45 priests and more than 20 fully professed religious brothers and sisters. Widely recognized as a national leader in the reform of accreditation in higher education, Dr. Dillon was active in the early 1990s in organizing a new national accrediting agency, the American Academy for Liberal Education. In 2003, he was appointed to a three-year term by the United States Secretary of Education to the 15-member National Advisory Committee on Institutional Quality and Integrity, a group that, in effect, accredits the accreditors. Dr. Dillon was a member of the Sovereign Military Order of Malta and chairman of the Western Association's Defense of the Faith Committee. He served on the Board of Directors of a number of organizations, including the Institute on Religious Life, and was a member of Legatus for the past 11 years. On April 15, Dr. Dillon was killed in an automobile accident in Ireland, where he was traveling on behalf of Thomas Aquinas College. He is survived by his mother and five siblings, his beloved wife, Terri, and their four children and their spouses: Elizabeth and Thomas J. Dillon, Maria and Domiane Forte, Christine and Thomas Ellis, and Danny Dillon. He also leaves behind 15 grandchildren: Cecilia, Maggie, Sean, Frances, and Jane Dillon; Emma, Giuseppe, Enzo, Francesco, and Bella Forte; and Andrew, Liam, Seth, Caitriona, and Joey Ellis. He will be deeply mourned by his family and by the entire community of Thomas Aquinas College, to which he gave his life. The Funeral Mass for Dr. Dillon will be held in Our Lady of the Most Holy Trinity Chapel at Thomas Aquinas College on Friday, April 24, 2009, at 10:00am. Interment will be at Santa Paula Cemetery. A rosary was held Thursday evening, April 23, 2009 at 7:30pm, also in the college chapel. An all-night vigil followed. The Dillon family asks that, in lieu of flowers, donations be made to Thomas Aquinas College or, more specifically, to Our Lady of the Most Holy Trinity Chapel. Funeral services are under the direction of the family owned and operated Robert Rey Garcia Jr., Funeral Services, Santa Paula, CA. 93060. For further information, please call (805)229-7054."

Franca and John opened Parliamo Italiano in 1978, and Franca designed and implemented the curriculum which made it one of the most successful language programs in the city. She continued to teach classes until a few months ago. We will remember with love and admiration her courage, her enormous intellect, her commitment to high moral principles, and her generous and loving heart which drew so many to her. May she be reunited now with her beloved John. The family will receive friends at an Open House at Parliamo Italiano Italian Language School, 132 East 65th Street, between 4 and 7pm on Sunday, April 26th. There will be a memorial service at a later date."

Although Greinke's scoreless streak to begin the season stopped at 24 innings, he pitched brilliantly in guiding the Kansas City Royals to a 6-1 victory against the Detroit Tigers at Kauffman Stadium. Greinke was dominant in pitching a three-hitter for his second consecutive complete game. He used a 97-mile-per-hour fastball, a vicious slider and a curveball that almost bounced to collect some of his 10 strikeouts. Although Greinke (4-0) was nicked for a run, it was unearned, so he maintained his 0.00 earned run average."

2009-04-26T00:00:00Z,"The antecedents of some of the teachings of the Redeemed Christian Church of God (Andrew Rice, April 12) are historically familiar, but the implications are fraught with potential danger. When Pastor Enoch Adeboye preaches that his followers “are a chosen people and have a special covenant with God,” he is merely echoing what other faiths have been claiming for centuries, starting with Judaism and continuing through Christianity (especially Calvinism and Mormonism) and Islam. But I wonder what Pastor Daniel Ajayi-Adeniran means when he speaks against “the gospel of tolerance” that has contributed to “moral decadence”? With the exception of Judaism, the above-mentioned have all been and are proselytizing faiths; faiths that have been and still are all too quick, in their extreme forms, to condemn or eliminate those who don’t accept their version of the truth. We live in a religiously diverse nation and world. Without toleration and respect for the faiths of others, including the views of those who reject religious faith completely, we will continue to make war on our fellow human beings based on the self-serving provincialism of these pastors and their ilk across the religious spectrum."
2009-04-26T00:00:00Z,"According to Wyatt Mason’s article on Frederick Seidel (April 12), anthologists keep leaving him out. “From one major anthology of poetry, the Oxford, he was excluded for 47 years, and he still won’t be found in another, the Norton.” For the record, Seidel is represented with two substantial poems in “The Oxford Book of American Poetry” (2006). His work also appears in three of the last five volumes in the annual “Best American Poetry” series as well as in previous editions assembled by Jorie Graham (1990) and A. R. Ammons (1994). Only two editions of “The Oxford” appeared in the 47 years prior to 2006. When Oxford published F. O. Matthiessen’s selection in 1950, Seidel was 14. If Richard Ellmann had chosen Seidel for the 1976 book, he would have been the youngest contemporary poet in the volume, with one book to his name. Neither the 1950 nor the 1976 edition was revised when reprinted. To say that Seidel “was excluded for 47 years” from the Oxford is a little like saying that The New York Times Magazine has ignored him for 73 years."

Lance Berkman was bothered early by shoulder soreness. Mark Reynolds set a single-season record in 2008 by striking out 204 times. That leaves David Wright, who had 20 strikeouts in 66 at-bats (77 plate appearances) after Saturday's game against the Nationals -- or one every 3.85 times up. On Saturday, he went 0 for 3 with one strikeout. Since 2006, Wright has gradually struck out less often -- once every 5.85 plate appearances in 2006 to 6.18 in 2007 to 6.24 in 2008."

He was the beloved son of Catherine and Jonathan Shapiro, the younger brother of Joshua and Jeremy, brother-in-law of Amy, uncle to Benjamin, grandson of Samuel L.

2009-04-26T00:00:00Z,"When Vladimir Guerrero went on the disabled list, the popular thinking was that the power-hitting prospect Brandon Wood would get his chance in what has been a weak Los Angeles Angels lineup. Wood, left, had a strong spring and had four home runs in six Class AAA games. But Manager Mike Scioscia said Wood's stay may be short as the team fiddles with its pitching. Wood was first available on Wednesday, but Scioscia started the light-hitting Maicer Izturis at designated hitter and batted him third. On Friday, Robb Quinlan was the D.H. Go figure. Joel Hanrahan blew his first two save opportunities with Washington and had an earned run average of 9.00. Then the closer-in-waiting Garrett Mock was promoted, and Hanrahan notched his next two saves, with two scoreless innings. But Mock, who took a loss last week by allowing a run in a second inning of work, has been groomed to close. Last season, he averaged more than 10 strikeouts per nine innings."

Born in 1920, he lived most of his childhood in New York City where his father (a prominent leftist doctor and medical researcher) introduced him to radical politics from a young age. Inspired by his father, he later became very involved in union organizing in the late 1930s and early 40s. After serving in the army during World War II, he worked at the Kellex corporation on the Manhatten Project. After this, he went to college at CCNY, and got a degree in chemistry. He earned a Ph.D in Physical Chemistry from Brooklyn Polytechnic, and went on to a post-doc at Yale. Dr. Luttinger spent much of his professional career working in the industrial sector, specializing in polymer chemistry, reverse osmosis, and environmental chemistry. His work resulted in numerous patents in these fields, including those for the chemistry behind glow sticks, photogrey lenses (a precursor to the Transitions lenses for glasses that become darker in sunlight), a process for purifying gold, and amergize, a petroleum additive that allows oil to burn more efficiently. A catalyst he developed for the synthesis of polyacetylene is known as the Luttinger catalyst. After raising his children in Connecticut and Pennsylvania, Lionel lived mostly in Brooklyn Heights in his later years. After retiring he became very involved in writing his memoirs as well as fiction. In 2007, he moved out to Iowa City to be nearer to his daughter Amy and her children. Dr. Luttinger is survived by his five children (Andrey, Amy, Karl, Tanya, and Nina Luttinger), seven grandchildren (Hannah Pomales, Celeste Alexander, Alexander Kaaret, Maija Liisa Luttinger, Zachery James, Owen James, and Xeno Madrone), and his sister Judy Florence."

Dick of Armonk, NY, passed away early Sunday morning (April 19, 2009) at Northern Westchester Hospital after a protracted illness. Born May 14, 1924, in New Haven, CT, to Morris and Beatrice, he graduated from Yale University (B.A., 1945; A.M., 1951); Yale Law School (LL.B., 1950); Harvard University (Ph.D., 1956). Dick studied Japanese while serving his country in WWII. While working on his doctoral degree in Japan, he became one of a handful of foreign lawyers ever admitted to the Japanese Bar, and was admitted to the Korean Bar as well. He practiced law in Tokyo for more than 35 years as a founding partner of what was then the largest and most well-known firm in Japan, Anderson Mori & Rabinowitz. He returned to the United States in 1991, teaching at Harvard and Yale Law Schools. From 1995 until his death, he was Of Counsel to Tozai Sogo Law Office, also of Tokyo, Japan. A lover of Jazz since his early days at University, Dick wept when listening to Billie Holiday, and had great reverence for Count Basie, Duke Ellington and Coleman Hawkins, who, as he explained, got him through many late night study sessions. A high school ice hockey goalie, his devotion to the sport only intensified with age. It was not uncommon for him to schedule his work and naps around what game was on, and was loyal to the game, not a team. Dick is survived by his wife of 57 years, Janice Hope Rabinowitz (Rosenbaum), and their three children, Ann Akiko Rabinowitz Dantzig (Armonk, NY) and her longtime partner John Diacnois, John Makoto Rabinowitz (Benicia, CA) and his wife Loan, Anthony Carl Rabinowitz (South Lake Tahoe, CA) and his wife Lisa, two granddaughters Natasha Chieko and Alexia Haruko Dantzig, and John's children Ari and Alix Diaconis Contributions in Dick's memory may be made in the United States to the Ken Hamilton Caregivers Center, Northern Westchester Hospital Center, 400 East Main Street, Mt.

She grew up in New York City, but her connection with Italy was lifelong, beginning with summers spent on the farm near Florence where her mother had been born, and continuing with yearly travel in Europe and beyond as she accompanied her husband, Alfred, who was an international banker, and for many years President of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York. After Brearley and Vassar she studied painting in New York, producing some quite-wonderful work that now hangs in the houses of her children, Tita Gratwick of Philadelphia and Tom Hayes of Cambridge, Mass. She is survived also by five grandchildren and two great-grandchildren. She lived, for most of her adult life, in New Canaan, Connecticut, and spent many summers in Wainscott, Long Island, where she will be buried alongside her husband.

She was the loving mother of Kevin, Alexandra, Cherida, Brendan, and Fiona, the mother in law of Frederick Peters, Stuart Shultz, Linda Lally, and Joseph Ogilvie, and the beloved grandmother of Justin, Clelia, Jack, Bart, Max, Oliver, Simon, Francesca, Jude, Liam and Josephine. Born in Spoleto, Italy in 1927, Franca was the daughter of Professor Francesco Pironti and his wife Teresa. She met and married Captain John Lally, a British officer stationed in Naples, in 1946. They moved intrepidly through life, creating opportunity in each of the many countries in which they lived before settling in 1966 at 132 East 65th Street, where they created a salon of family, friends, artists, educators, and students which influenced everyone who was drawn in by its magnetic pull. Franca and John opened Parliamo Italiano in 1978, and Franca designed and implemented the curriculum which made it one of the most successful language programs in the city. She continued to teach classes until a few months ago. We will remember with love and admiration her courage, her enormous intellect, her commitment to high moral principles, and her generous and loving heart which drew so many to her. May she be reunited now with her beloved John. The family will receive friends at an Open House at Parliamo Italiano Italian Language School, 132 East 65th Street, between 4 and 7pm on Sunday, April 26th.

2009-04-26T00:00:00Z,"THE WILD SIDE Bright light has a powerful effect on our body clocks, and if we don't see much of it -- and many office workers do not -- then our circadian health suffers. Till Roenneberg, a professor at Ludwig Maximilians University in Munich, has developed a questionnaire that determines an individual's proclivity to ''morningness'' and ''eveningness.'' He has coined the phrase ''social jet lag'' to describe the persistent mismatch between people's biological clocks and the demands of their jobs or education. It is bad enough for ''larks,'' who tend to be up early, and late-rising ''owls,'' whose genes cause a mismatch between modern life and the ancient human body clock. For ''hummingbirds,'' the 70 percent to 80 percent of us who manage the 24-hour solar cycle well, working night shifts or burning the proverbial candle at both ends, the implications are far-ranging for learning, memory, performance and quality of life. Roenneberg's call to employers to say to their workforce, ''Please wake up in your own time and come in when you are ready,'' is provocative but a challenge that we have not been meeting."

Qualls (who we’ll always love for “Hustle & Flow”), the episode was stolen by Bob Odenkirk. Over the weekend, Mr. Odenkirk made his first appearance as Saul Goodman, a follicly-challenged lawyer who’s called upon to help Walter (Bryan Cranston) and Jesse (Aaron Paul) out of a jam, but who may have an ulterior motive or two up his rumpled sleeves. You can get a taste of Mr. Odenkirk’s work in this behind-the-scenes segment hosted by the “Breaking Bad” creator Vince Gilligan:"

The rock band Aerosmith agreed to play a makeup show in Maui to help resolve a class-action suit by fans who were disappointed when the group pulled out of a concert there in 2007, The Associated Press reported. In September 2007, the band was scheduled to play a show at Maui’s War Memorial Stadium but canceled abruptly, citing logistical problems. Lawyers for the more than 8,000 fans who filed the suit said that Aerosmith had passed them over to play a concert in Chicago and to perform a private show at a car dealership in Oahu. A date for the makeup performance in Maui has not been set, but a lawyer representing the fans said that it would probably be in September or October, and that all original ticket holders would receive free tickets."

On Monday, the Harry Ransom Center at the University of Texas at Austin announced that it had made available more than 1,300 boxes of papers, film, movie props and costumes donated by Mr. De Niro to researchers and the public. The collection, which has been appraised at $5 million, covers Mr. De Niro’s career from the 1968 Brian De Palma feature “Greetings” through 2005’s “Hide and Seek,” and includes everything from the leopard-print boxing robe the actor wore in “Raging Bull” to the coats he donned as the Creature in “Frankenstein.”"

2009-04-27T14:47:57Z,"Two weeks ago, I took some time to make a trip to Brooklyn to visit a tailoring company run by a man named Martin Greenfield. It was a hike, I got lost, but I finally found the brick factory in East Williamsburg, Brooklyn. Formerly called Three G's, Martin Greenfield Tailoring is a pretty incredible place run by a no less incredible man. In all my years in fashion I've never seen anything like it: a factory in the truest sense of the word, down to the creaky wood boards that make up the open loft floors. It's a living anachronism, perfectly art directed for a movie set. Martin Greenfield, a Holocaust survivor, has been working at the factory since 1947 when he started as a floor boy. In the late 1970's he purchased the company and he now turns out old-school tailoring like very few others do. He is the keeper of the rapidly disappearing art of handmade tailoring, crafting suits for companies like Neiman Marcus and Brooks Brothers, and, once upon a time, for customers like Bill Clinton and the late Paul Newman. Not one to live in the past, Greenfield is also working with younger, fashion-minded designers (who would probably not appreciate my mentioning them here!), who sought him out for his mastery of the art of tailoring. Costume designers eager to recreate period perfection utilize his expertise and history to help tell their sartorial stories. (He showed me a few pieces from an upcoming cable TV series that he is working on.) Greenfield is filled with stories and is generous with the telling as he walked me through the cutting and sewing floors, past walls filled with photographs and laminated articles. He flipped through books of the finest fabrics from Loro Piana and the like while he talked about the new softer shoulder he was crafting for a particular suit. It was inspiring and heartening to spend a short afternoon with someone with such passion and knowledge ... I'm feeling for Martin Greenfield."

2009-04-27T00:00:00Z,"GRADUATE education is the Detroit of higher learning. Most graduate programs in American universities produce a product for which there is no market (candidates for teaching positions that do not exist) and develop skills for which there is diminishing demand (research in subfields within subfields and publication in journals read by no one other than a few like-minded colleagues), all at a rapidly rising cost (sometimes well over $100,000 in student loans). Widespread hiring freezes and layoffs have brought these problems into sharp relief now. But our graduate system has been in crisis for decades, and the seeds of this crisis go as far back as the formation of modern universities. Kant, in his 1798 work ''The Conflict of the Faculties,'' wrote that universities should ''handle the entire content of learning by mass production, so to speak, by a division of labor, so that for every branch of the sciences there would be a public teacher or professor appointed as its trustee.''"

Jordan, known to many as ""Jordy"", died peacefully after a sudden illness on April 23rd, surrounded by his family. He was 70 years old. A life-long resident of New York, Jordy maintained homes on the Upper East Side and in Westhampton Beach. After founding and operating The New York Jean Company, his successful denim business, where he became known as ""The King of Jeans"", he ""retired"" and joined his sons Scott, Rande and Kenny in the creation of Gerber Group, which owns and operates more than 30 bars and restaurants nationwide, including Stone Rose in the Time Warner Center and Whiskey Blue in the W Hotel. Jordy's role at the Gerber Group included oversight of construction projects for the company and, more importantly, served as a primary point of contact between management and the thousands of employees who adored him. The familial relationship Jordy built with his employees helped foster the outstanding customer service that has become a trademark of the Gerber Group's success. Jordy's extended family very clearly included both the Gerber Group's employees and its celebrity clientele. Born in Brooklyn, New York he was a graduate of Oceanside High School and Boston University where he was a member of the Phi Epsilon Chi fraternity. He was also a passionate sportsman who loved spending time outdoors and enjoyed the beauty of the Hamptons. Jordy is survived by his beloved wife Kelly, sons Scott (wife Tracey), Rande (wife Cindy Crawford) and Kenny, daughter Sophie, grandchildren (who called him PeaPa) Chase, Owen, Georgia, Presley and Kaia, sisters Joni and Cassie, nieces Wendee and Jessie and nephews Doug, Nick, Tommy and Hawke. The family wishes to extend their gratitude to the caregivers at Mt. Sinai Hospital in New York City for their compassion and care. A celebration of Jordy's life will be held on Tuesday, April 28th at Stone Rose Lounge in the Time Warner Center from 6-9 pm. In lieu of flowers, the family is requesting donations be made in the name of Jordan Gerber to the Juvenile Diabetes Research Foundation (www.jdrf.org).

When Mr. Riley created the piece, in 1964, modern music had long been dominated by serialism: rigorously controlled, intellectual in its appeal, often bone dry. Mr. Riley's simple recipe -- performers repeat each of 53 melodic kernels for as long as they like against a pulsating C in octaves, ending when everyone has played every section -- asserted a view of music as a communal action and a key to transcendence."

The daughter of Harry Hershenson and Anna Alper, she was born in Brooklyn, New York in 1917 where she lived for most of her life. On June 12, 1938 she married Norman Orleck with whom she enjoyed a legendarily loving relationship - raising two children, throwing unforgettable costume parties in the basement, working side by side in a series of candy stores, luncheonettes and a gift store then putting on records and dancing all night. They were inseparable for 43 years until he died in her arms on the dance floor in 1980. Thelma found solace and intellectual passion in competitive contract bridge. She was a Life Master and a dazzling bridge strategist right up to the end of her life. She moved up to Vermont last year, where she was just beginning to make a new community of friends at Upper Valley bridge clubs when she became ill. In Vermont as in Brooklyn, she was loved by all who knew her. She was predeceased by her husband Norman Orleck and by her companion of 24 years, George Berger. She is survived, and will be deeply and forever missed, by her two children Jerry Orleck and Annelise Orleck, by her sister Mildred Katz, her grandchildren Lawrence Orleck, Jonathan Orleck, Evann Orleck-Jetter and Raphael Orleck-Jetter, her great-granddaughter Genevieve Piper Orleck, her daughters-in-law Alexis Jetter and Joanne Sherman and her grand-daughters-in-law Kelli Orleck and Sy Ingoglia. She taught us all to make love and joy a part of every day. Funeral services will be at Kirschenbaum Chapel at 1153 Coney Island Avenue in Brooklyn at noon on Tuesday April 28."

But if you’d like to see the actual hack license that Mr. De Niro wielded while he was preparing for his role in “Taxi Driver,” along with artifacts and papers from 68 of his other films, they’re now easy enough to find. On Monday the Harry Ransom Center at the University of Texas at Austin announced that it had made available to researchers and the public the more than 1,300 boxes of papers, film, movie props and costumes donated by Mr. De Niro, above. The collection covers his career from the 1968 Brian De Palma feature “Greetings” through the 2005 film “Hide and Seek.” It includes the leopard-print boxing robe Mr. De Niro wore in “Raging Bull” and the coats he wore as the Creature in “Mary Shelley’s Frankenstein.”."
2009-04-28T00:00:00Z,"The Polish pianist Krystian Zimerman surprised his audience during a recital on Sunday at the Walt Disney Concert Hall in Los Angeles when he announced that he would no longer perform in the United States in protest of the country’s military policies, the Web site of The Los Angeles Times, latimes.com, reported. Mr. Zimerman was about to play Karol Szymanowski’s “Variations on a Polish Folk Theme,” his final piece of the evening, when he told concertgoers that he would not continue to perform in a country whose military, he said, wants to take over the world. “Get your hands off my country,” Mr. Zimerman said, according to the report. In 2006 Mr. Zimerman halted a performance at Carnegie Hall when he believed he observed a concertgoer recording the recital. Amid heightened security after the 9/11 attacks, a Steinway grand piano that he traveled with was destroyed by the Transportation Security Administration, apparently because the piano’s glue resembled a compound used in explosives."

2009-04-28T00:00:00Z,"The Broadway production of “Impressionism,” which opened on March 24 to largely negative reviews, will close on May 10, its publicist announced on Sunday night. “Impressionism,” directed by Jack O’Brien and starring Jeremy Irons and Joan Allen, above, will have played 23 previews and 56 regular performances when it closes. The play by Michael Jacobs, about a New York art gallery owner (Ms. Allen) and a photojournalist (Mr. Irons), took the somewhat unusual route of having its world premiere on Broadway, rather than first opening in an out-of-town theater or off Broadway. Ms. Allen had not been seen on Broadway since 1989, when she starred in Wendy Wasserstein’s “Heidi Chronicles,” and it was Mr. Irons’s first Broadway appearance since 1985, when he was in “The Real Thing” by Tom Stoppard."

Marchi was uniquely sensitive to and supportive of CUNY's overall vital educational mission, its urban orientation and its place in the national marketplace of public higher education. During a career that spanned a half century, he served as the lead sponsor in the State Senate of laws that helped to transform CUNY into the nation's leading urban public university. These included legislation to create the groundbreaking SEEK program; to separate the CUNY community colleges from SUNY's jurisdiction; and to designate CSI and The New York City College of Technology as senior colleges. In 2006, the CUNY Board of Trustees approved the naming of CSI's Building 2N -- which houses the History and Political Science departments -- as John J. Marchi Hall.

It's called the ''widow penalty,'' a tragic quirk in federal law that unfairly punishes recently married immigrants whose citizen spouses die before their green-card paperwork is processed. United States Citizenship and Immigration Services, which handles applications for legal permanent residence, says its hands are tied. According to its interpretation of the law, if a citizen dies before the agency acts on his or her petition for a spouse's green card -- and if the marriage is less than 2 years old -- the surviving spouse automatically ceases to be a spouse."

The three come from different viruses and carry different kinds of danger, depending on ease of transmission and virulence. As a benchmark, the deadliest influenza pandemic in the past century, the Spanish influenza of 1918 to 1919, had an estimated mortality rate of around 2.5 percent but killed tens of millions of people because it spread so widely."

On Monday the Harry Ransom Center at the University of Texas at Austin announced that it had made available to researchers and the public the more than 1,300 boxes of papers, film, movie props and costumes donated by Mr. De Niro, above. The collection covers his career from the 1968 Brian De Palma feature ''Greetings'' through the 2005 film ''Hide and Seek.''

It was rarer, perhaps, than a Mets starter pitching six innings. Or their dysfunctional offense erupting for a six-run first inning. Or their fans rewarding Santos, whose name they did not know a week ago, with an extended standing ovation, which he answered with an enthusiastic curtain call."

That was in the early 1990s, he explained recently. Just out of Harvard, he was working at The Village Voice Literary Supplement, where one of his jobs was opening the mail.

2009-04-28T00:00:00Z,"FEDERAL prosecutors last week persuaded a judge to stop a group of Bernard L. Madoff's victims from using an involuntary bankruptcy filing to claim more than $100 million of his personal assets. The prosecutors' argument was simple: preserving Mr. Madoff's assets for eventual forfeiture to the government is the best way to ensure as much money as possible is returned to the victims of his Ponzi scheme in an equitable manner. Most people would assume that this is business as usual, that the government routinely seizes the assets of criminals and returns them to victims. After all, criminals should not have ill-gotten houses, cars and yachts waiting for them when they finish their sentences. But the reality is that the government's focus on seizing Mr. Madoff's assets for restitution is unusual. Lawbreakers are rarely forced to give up the proceeds of their crimes."

Prosecutors said that Mr. Sze obtained about 1,300 photos of Mr. Chen when the performer brought his computer to a repair shop in 2006, and that Mr. Sze put the images on CDs for other customers. In the ensuing scandal, Mr. Chen announced that he had retired from the Hong Kong entertainment industry. Mr. Sze remains in custody and is expected to be sentenced on May 13."

He deeply loved and was devoted to his wife of 67 years, Muriel, and his son, Douglas. The son of the late Maurice E. and Mary Barzelay, he was born and raised in Malden, Mass. He received a BSME from Northeastern University in 1939 and an MS from Harvard University in 1941. After serving as an aircraft designer during WWII, he joined the faculty of Syracuse University in 1947, becoming Professor of Mechanical and Aerospace Engineering in 1953 until his retirement in 1978. During his tenure, his areas of interest included aircraft design, heat transfer and safety engineering, on which he acted as a consultant to NASA. He was a Visiting Professor at Harvard in 1963-64. After retiring from Syracuse University, he built an active and thriving consulting engineering practice, specializing in safety engineering and in accident analysis and reconstruction. He was the author of several treatises and numerous articles in his fields of expertise. For many years he was a leader of the reform movement in the Democratic Party in Syracuse and was active in statewide politics as well. He was also a highly accomplished painter and many of his works are in private collections around the country. Until his final illness, he also retained his keen interests in gardening and in the computer, a technology he embraced avidly in his 80s. He was fortunate to have lived a full, active and productive life, as he wished to live it, with his vibrant intellect and strong will intact and the welfare of his close-knit and loving family always uppermost in his mind. Donations, in lieu of flowers, may be made to the Southampton Hospital Foundation, 240 Meetinghouse Lane, Southampton, NY 11968, where a fund has been established in his memory. A commemoration of his life will be held on Sunday, May 3rd at 4pm in Parrish Memorial Hall, Southampton."
2009-04-29T00:00:00Z,"It was only five years ago that opposition to same-sex marriage was so strong that Republicans explicitly turned to the issue as a way to energize conservative voters. Yet today, as the party contemplates the task of rebuilding itself, some Republicans say the marriage issue may be turning into more of a hindrance than a help. The fact that a run of states have legalized same-sex marriage in recent months -- either by court decision or by legislative action -- with little backlash is only one indication of how public attitudes about this subject appear to be changing."
