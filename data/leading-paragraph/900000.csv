Pantalas is a human monstrosity, one-eyed, one-legged, one-armed, and represents the ""submerged tenth."" The Salvation Army is introduced into the story."
1897-07-31T00:00:00Z,"The question has been asked by us: ""Did the Greek sculptor of the best period make reins for his horses?"" A ready answer to this may be found in a superb article of Walter Paters, entitled ""The Beginnings of Greek Sculpture."" He wishes to explain how impossible it is for us to-day to appreciate the complete grandeur of Greek art since its surroundings have been changed."
1897-07-31T00:00:00Z,"The Springfield American remarks that there is perhaps nothing in our social structure more noteworthy than the vigorous Americanization of the Jews. That the Americanism of the Jews is robustly vigorous is one of the many notable facts in our social structure, but it is not a new development, nor is there anything strange about it."

1897-08-01T00:00:00Z,"The annual regatta of the Indian Harbor Yacht Club, which was sailed yesterday off Greenwich, was full of incidents. The Sirene and Montauk lost their masts, the E.Z. Sloat parted her throat halyards, and the home mark boat dragged her anchors and made serious trouble. The racing was good, and, much to the surprise of all, the half-rater Yola gave the Paprika a bad beating."

Ambassador Hay and the members of the United States Embassy were at Waterloo Station to bid him farewell."
1897-08-01T00:00:00Z,"People in silver countries well understand the difference between their money and ours. When I was in China and Japan two months ago often a shopkeeper would say, after giving his price, that it was only half as much in gold. My firm imports large quantities of sisal hemp from Yucatan, and buys, with Mexican dollars costing in our money about 47 cents each, at 5 cents per pound."
1897-08-01T00:00:00Z,"PITTSBURG, July 31. -- A number of coal operators who congregated at the Monongahela House to-day expressed themselves very forcibly on the strike situation.

Of these the mackerel and whiting are of all our sea fish almost the quickest to decompose, and are therefore, the mackerel more particularly, peculiarly unfitted for consumption in inland centres."
1897-08-01T00:00:00Z,"PARIS, July 20. -- The dinner given to the Colonial Premiers by the British Chamber of Commerce has had a certain political importance attributed to it, mainly owing to the plain speaking of Sir Wilfrid Laurier, the Canadian Premier. Sir Wilfrid speaks perfect French, with a strong American accent. He resembles Sardou and also Joseph, that famous chef who was once in the domestic service of Mr. Vanderbilt."

There was a large number of entries in both competitions, and the play was close and exciting throughout."
1897-08-01T00:00:00Z,"We say much in our press of militarism being a heavy burden to Germany. We mean usually that the cost of maintaining half a million men in times of peace is something of a burden to a sandy country with a poor population.

1897-08-01T00:00:00Z,"Scrambling through a creek choked with bulrushes many times higher than our heads, we climbed up the clay bank and attempted to push through the dense undergrowth in the direction of the turmoil. More easily said than done!"
1897-08-01T00:00:00Z,"HE New York City Room in the Woman's Building at the Tennessee Centennial Exposition is admittedly the most attractive room there.

We speak not now of the trumpeter of Tasmania nor of the blue cod of New Zealand, about which the inhabitants of these colonies are not unnaturally proud. Judging by his shape, the schnapper is an ugly fish. His color is good, but his proportions are not fair, as he lies on the slab of the fishmonger."

1897-08-14T00:00:00Z,"There never was a charge more baseless and malicious than that Christianity dwarfed and narrowed human life. In its most perverted forms, in the hands of the most selfish and depraved men, Christianity has been a force for enfranchising human life.

1897-08-14T00:00:00Z,"The approaching substitution of motor power for horses as a means of traction in several of the principal streets of the city suggests some interesting speculation.

It was a slugging contest, and four pitchers were required during the game. The Pittsburgs outbatted the home team, but their fielding was execrable Score:"

English riders have employed the contrivance almost since the wheel came into vogue, but the weight and general ugliness of the English models has militated against their introduction on the Western Hemisphere."

1897-08-22T00:00:00Z,"NEWPORT, Aug. 19. -- This has been a gay week in Newport. Each night has seen a large number of dinners, and dances have been held on three nights.

They glibly speak of conference and union as though in this relation those words bore their common and laudable meaning; as though a conference with PLATT to save the city were comparable to a conference of two earnest religious bodies seeking by union of effort to save more souls.
1897-08-22T00:00:00Z,"Years ago, when racing was sport indulged in by wealthy men, solely for the recreation it afforded them, a cup race would call forth the greatest amount of enthusiasm.

1897-08-22T00:00:00Z,"The workmanship of the printer in his own proper field is wonderful when we regard the circumstances under which it was done, but it would not satisfy the requirements of a modern publisher or bookbuyer. It is of its own time, with the faults of that time in manner and matter. The promise of legibility which seem warranted by the bold and black types is delusive."

Those who are not witnesses of the almost magic growth cannot appreciate the feverish activity, the inventive capacity, and the habit of rapid decision which such a condition of life rears.

A conservative estimate gives $500,000 as the sum of which Chicago has been robbed during the last two years.

A hunt club is rather better than a share in a gold mine in a rural neighborhood, because the members not only spend money freely, but pay liberal damages when in their enthusiasm they ride over ground supposed to be under cultivation."

1897-09-12T00:00:00Z,"The ""one-design"" class of the Seawanhaka-Corinthian Yacht Club for next year has started off in a very promising manner.

Stearns of Marblehead should be accepted."
1897-09-12T00:00:00Z,"The showing the New Yorks made against their intercity rivals, the Brooklyns, in the presence of 8,000 persons at the Polo Grounds yesterday afternoon did not cast any credit on the local team, and the Brooklyns won rather easily. It was either the oppressive heat, or the fact that the Giants are practically out of the fight for second place, that made the players give such a wretched exhibition."

In this inning Dahlen was hurt sliding to second and was replaced by Callahan, Connor going to second. Umpire McDonald called the game on account of darkness. Score:"

1897-09-12T00:00:00Z,"ANTWERP, Aug. 19. -- This flat country reminds me of the story of a London friend who was explaining how impossible it is to make a Hollander understand what a real hill is, or a cataract, or anything that involves elevation. He was riding through Holland one day in a railway train with a native, and as there was no scenery they naturally fell to talking about it."

They are as anxious for good government, with all that implies, as the most superior member of the Citizens' Union. They want clean streets and the honest expenditure of public money and they expect to get these things from the Democracy."

1897-11-03T00:00:00Z,"The Citizens' Union movement has been vindicated by the result of the election.

1897-11-04T00:00:00Z,"Nothing has yet come to light to show that Jessie K. Parsons, who killed herself in the Manhattan Hotel, had any special reason for the act other than that, being of a pessimistic turn of mind, life had lost its charm for her. Her relatives say that is the only explanation of the deed that they can give."
1897-11-04T00:00:00Z,"The place of Lord Rector of a Scotch university is one of brief but considerable distinction. His sole function is the de livery of an address, but among these addresses have been some of the most notable and a few of the noblest passages of modern literature. Naturally, the standard set in the vividly characteristic effort of CARLYLE and the equally original but more subtle address of Mr. BALFOUR cannot be maintained every year."

In 1820 she had become a devout collector of book plates -- the first of a long and expanding line -- and, while others might have taken up the pursuit had she failed to do so, the opprobrium of founding this industry seems to belong to her."

Raphael Tuck Sons' Company, of 368 Broadway, New York, have produced for the coming holiday season and the approaching new year a very handsomely adorned collection of calendars and Christmas cards.

1897-12-18T00:00:00Z,"The judgment of the Court of Appeal in Paris in the action between Sir William Eden and ""Jimmy"" McNeil Whistler is satisfactory to artists in general and to Whistler in particular.

Mr. Savage, and in that connection expresses himself thus: ""Nearly everything is to be gained and almost nothing lost by a fair and open discussion of truth,"" (the ""nearly"" and ""almost"" are amusingly ecclesiastical, as well as theologically inscrutable.) Mr. Stoddard complains that on some occasion Mr. Savage expressed his views in thee words:"

1897-12-25T00:00:00Z,""" The lover is an idealist. He is not in love with a living reality, though he thinks he is. His happiness, as an idealist, consists in believing a poem to be not only poetical, but a fact. True love is a religion, that is, a believed poem, but it is inferior to the celestial religions in expecting its ideal fruition on the earth."

1897-12-25T00:00:00Z,"Hesiod was a verista, a rather morose verista who had not kept a single illusion. His advice is the essence of plain common sense tinged a little with pessimism. He makes the Bocotian peasant stand before us as clearly as the Dutch peasants in the ""Village Fete"" of Teniers. Many of his precepts are no less sound now than they were in his own day."

1897-12-25T00:00:00Z,Dr. DEPEW's rushing journey of 450 miles to dine with the Congregational Club of Washington on Forefathers' Day was well worth making if we consider what he had to say to his hosts. He might well have gone across the continent to announce his acceptance of doctrines so different in important regards from those he has long sustained that his acceptance of them is equivalent to a conversion.
1897-12-25T00:00:00Z,"Works which are greedily sought after in one generation are neglected in the next. Booksellers now rarely think it worth while to give the height of an Elzevir or to devote a note to an Aldus.

1897-12-25T00:00:00Z,"I think it remarkable that amid all the collective pressure in the bookselling business, and the easy and familiar way in which writers are quoted by dry goods houses that have the earth on sale, and the especially loud cries regarding the half-nothing prices at which novels can be purchased, from Fielding to Corelli, one never, or hardly ever, sees the name of Henry Kingsley quoted.

1897-12-25T00:00:00Z,"An actual operation officially and scientifically reported by able surgeons and the indisputable life and presence of a human being seem to nullify all the theories of the learned men of all ages regarding the human stomach.

Some have supposed that it originated in Egypt, the land that gave birth to nearly all the arts; but search diligently as you may, and you will never discover in mummy's tomb, on sculptured or painted wall, or in any archaeological find whatever, the pictorial or actual remains of this poetic tissue; neither is there documentary evidence of its presence there."
