Woody Allen has chosen to talk about it in ''Crimes and Misdemeanors,'' which opened Friday.

1989-10-15T00:00:00Z,"LEAD: The 1980's have been an extraordinary time for home design. Many trends have come and gone: The English country style swept the nation with cluttered rooms done in chintz and ribbons. Post-modern buildings, boasting pediments and oversize columns, began cropping up in all major cities.

1989-10-22T00:00:00Z,"LEAD: THE PEOPLE OF Chad had good reason to change the name of >Fort-Archambault to >Sarh, and >Fort-Lamy to >Ndjamena: the new names are less warlike, contain no memories of a colonial past and are easier for local residents to pronounce.

Under budgets proposed by the state's 34 general hospitals for the current year, that same patient would pay nearly $6,900, an increase of 18.8 percent, and the magnitude of that increase has shocked state officials and the businesses that would pay higher health insurance premiums to support those rates."

1989-10-22T00:00:00Z,"LEAD: Vern Gosdin's voice resonates with country tradition - the conversational, smoke-cured twang of George Jones and Ernest Tubb, holding back pain with quiet dignity. But what brought an admiring cult to the Lone Star on Thursday night for a rare New York performance by Mr. Gosdin was his songs, which are the work of a specialist - or a man obsessed."
1989-10-22T00:00:00Z,"LEAD: Pressure is building to revise Gramm-Rudman, the budget-balancing legislation enacted in 1985 and amended in 1987. Indeed, Congress seems to be on the verge of adopting a pattern of amending the law every two years. This year the argument for revising the targets will have a new and powerful twist: the need to protect people's retirement checks by segregating the Social Security accounts from the rest of the budget for deficit reduction purposes."
1989-10-22T00:00:00Z,"LEAD: In his plays, Slawomir Mrozek mixes art and polemics. Sometimes, as in ''Tango'' and ''Emigres,'' his sense of theater is as strong as his political awareness. This is not the case with ''The Ambassador,'' receiving its United States premiere at the Vietnam Veterans Ensemble Theater Company. With politics taking precedence, the narrative becomes a thin thread on which to hang the author's inquiry into the nature of dissidence and diplomacy during a time of subversion."
1989-10-22T00:00:00Z,"LEAD: When he finally got around to answering a complex set of allegations about his personal finances, David Dinkins did it with poise and patience.

The pylons announce Solana's presence from a mile down the freeway, and they foretell the nature of its architecture, a series of stucco-clad buildings with intense, rich color and a surprisingly urbane presence."
1989-10-22T00:00:00Z,"LEAD: From skiing to surfing, California is a state of exhilarating extremes, and perils. Even with respect to risk, Californians cover the spectrum. A law passed by popular ballot in 1986 requires warning labels on any food whose ingredients have a 1-in-100,000 chance of causing cancer. Yet, as Tuesday's tremor hammered home, tens of thousands could be killed in the truly major earthquake that might strike at any time."

1989-10-22T00:00:00Z,"LEAD: The devastating earthquake here is already having a political aftershock: a re-examination of California's reluctance to tax and spend, enshrined in law by a series of voter initiatives over the last decade that now constitutionally handcuff the state's ability to repair its crumbled highways and bridges."

1989-10-22T00:00:00Z,"LEAD: FOR more than 500 years the treasure of the Kremlin has been one of the great sights of Moscow. In 1485, after the completion of the first stone churches and palaces, the collection had become important enough to erect a special building to house it.

1989-10-22T00:00:00Z,"LEAD: MARINATING accomplishes many purposes. It is an excellent method of providing flavor. It also tenderizes and even cures foods, pickling or ''cooking'' them in acid. How long a food is left in a marinade depends on what the final product should be as well as the character of the main ingredient. The following recipes illustrate these points."
1989-10-22T00:00:00Z,"LEAD: Chazz Palminteri's one-man play ''A Bronx Tale'' is the theatrical equivalent of sprawling streetwise rock songs like Bruce Springsteen's ''Jungleland'' and Billy Joel's ''Scenes From an Italian Restaurant.''

''There may be a large inventory of unsold homes, but they just aren't affordable,'' said the Putnam County developer, who is offering 75 two-bedroom town-house units in Kent at $129,900 apiece, well below the prices of most new homes in the area."
1989-10-22T00:00:00Z,"LEAD: ''The intimate world of Alexander Calder'' at the Cooper-Hewitt Museum is as much fun as any exhibition we can hope to see. But, quite apart from being so much fun, it is also a lesson in life, for Calder had in a high degree the gift of metamorphosis. The first thing we learn from this exhibition is that in the everyday things around him - a clothespin, a cork, a fishbone, a discarded can of this or that - he saw disinherited ingredients that could be put to magical use."
1989-10-22T00:00:00Z,"LEAD: I WALK every morning, a habit I acquired after the death of my father.

The DiFeos, for one, now have 35 franchises mainly in New York, New Jersey and Connecticut. And the family, which now sells all but 6 of the 40 makes on the market in this country, hopes to buy five more franchises in the next year."
1989-10-22T00:00:00Z,"LEAD: The decision to bench Ken O'Brien for the journeyman Kyle Mackey has deeper implications than the quick-fix remedy for a troubled team. It is this kind of unstable decision making that mirrors the disorganization that is the New York Jets, during the tenure of Joe Walton."
1989-10-22T00:00:00Z,LEAD: I was saddened to see President Truman's diatribe appearing in print on the eve of President Eisenhower's centennial. It is also sad that this sour note comes when both Presidents are rising in the estimation of historians of the 1980's.

1989-10-22T00:00:00Z,"LEAD: The opening concert of P.S. 122's Hearings series on Wednesday night had a good concept: the double bill of Irene Schweizer and Maggie Nichols, who have a large following in Europe, and Anthony Coleman and Jim Pugliese showed the differences between European and American improvising styles.

These glamour-pusses do not do much chasing or digging; sometimes they deign to commit the odd interview, but mainly they are performers, reading lines often written for them in circumstances concocted by their shows' producers."

1989-10-29T00:00:00Z,"LEAD: SOMEBODY somewhere must want to buy a dismantled 18th-century tavern, move an early 19th-century Greek Revival house or help solve the problems of a 1933 International Style prefabricated home.

1989-10-29T00:00:00Z,"LEAD: Amid the growing number of films dealing with the Holocaust, some of the most effective have been those that bracket the horrors of World War II with the flashbacks of a central character.

1989-11-05T00:00:00Z,"LEAD: Time was when being average was, well, the norm, and the norm was something that people could live with. Beaver Cleaver could bring home C's without his parents running to a psychiatrist - or sending him to one - and the principal never transferred Dennis the Menace to a class for learning-disabled students."

1989-11-05T00:00:00Z,"LEAD: To be sure, life in New York City has its drawbacks. Crime is rampant, pollution is everywhere and nothing works: if the hospitals or the garbage men aren't on strike, the water is turned off. But it could be worse. You could have Mel Edison as a neighbor."
1989-11-05T00:00:00Z,"LEAD: In describing her first face-to-face meeting with Ronald Reagan, Peggy Noonan writes: ''There was a quizzical look on his face as he listened to what was going on around him, and I realized he doesn't really hear very much, and his appearance of constant good humor is connected to his deafness.''"
1989-11-05T00:00:00Z,"LEAD: There are some people who have only to open their mouths to be real downers. They are not insulting and they are not necessarily complainers about life, marriage, children or finances - they're not even negative in the traditional sense. They merely bring out the not-so-nice characteristics in others, and one of those characteristics is an almost irresistible urge to give them a good swat."

1989-11-05T00:00:00Z,"LEAD: Ralph Waldo Emerson, who as a gardener really should have known better, once said that a weed is simply a plant whose virtues we haven't yet discovered. ''Weed,'' that is, is not a category of nature but a human construct, a defect of our perception. This kind of attitude, which draws on an old American strain of romantic thinking about wild nature, can get you into trouble."

1989-11-05T00:00:00Z,"LEAD: Your article on Basia Johnson gave me a sense of deja-vu; she seems so much like that other immensely wealthy ''queen'' who has been in the news lately. Who knows, she may be able to do for Polish shipbuilding what Leona Helmsley has done for the New York hotel business. Even if the Gdansk shipyard venture fails, she still gets a tax write-off."
1989-11-05T00:00:00Z,LEAD: Behind the program trading battle raging on Wall Street is more than a concern that computerized trading techniques are scaring away investors by triggering wild price swings.

There was an announcement that those of us waiting on the platform should walk to the New Haven side of the tracks, where a train would pick us up in 10 minutes.

1989-11-05T00:00:00Z,"LEAD: David Margolick's article might have provided insight into this unusual woman of great initiative. He speaks of Basia Johnson's story as ''the American dream come true.'' But, as her story demonstrates, women in America are not guaranteed lasting happiness simply by marrying the American dream. Women may be driven by aspirations and agendas that need not be centered around the men in their lives."

1989-11-05T00:00:00Z,"LEAD: The familiar thud of another unsolicited script coming through his letter box left Daniel Day-Lewis cold. He was suffering the somewhat sour aftertaste of becoming a star, the anticlimax that followed the rapid succession of films - ''My Beautiful Laundrette,'' ''The Unbearable Lightness of Being,'' ''A Room With a View,'' ''Stars and Bars'' - that had quite suddenly marked him as one of the most extraordinary British actor of his generation."
1989-11-05T00:00:00Z,"LEAD: MOST OF MY 240 graduate and undergraduate students at the Beijing Institute of Chemical Technology were witty, wise, sweet and highly intelligent - sometimes brilliant. They were patriotic, with a deep-rooted love of their homeland, its ways and its people."

1989-11-05T00:00:00Z,"LEAD: At once compatible and contradictory were the first two items on Wednesday's program by the Tokyo String Quartet at the 92d Street Y. Mozart - whose Quartet in G (K. 387) began the evening - was perhaps the first of our confessional composers. This confiding, commiserating tone established an intimacy between musician and listener that became the modus operandi of 19th-century music."
1989-11-05T00:00:00Z,"LEAD: In a bid for support in its drive to have large tracts of TriBeCa landmarked, the public-interest group leading the fight has published a 64-page architectural history of the area of southwestern Manhattan titled ''The Texture of TriBeCa.''

1989-11-05T00:00:00Z,"LEAD: One of the more alarming chapters in recent American history is an often overlooked episode from the 1920's. The wonder is that a time so filled with evil men and frightening doings has remained in obscurity; that it didn't scare Americans half to death. And that such an episode has only now been given dramatic re-creation, in a two-part NBC mini-series, ''Cross of Fire."

It is easy to compensate for that lack of fat with a savory marinade, which adds immeasurably to the flavor of the meat. The longer it is allowed to sit, the deeper it penetrates."

1989-11-05T00:00:00Z,"LEAD: On the occasion of the 20th New York City Marathon, I think it's only fair that nouveau runners be told how it used to be in the old days when the race was confined to Central Park. The tune from ''Rocky'' had not yet serenaded runners. There were two Port-a-Johns and no waiting. The rallying cry of the underdog, as reflected in the ''Rocky'' metaphor, has been the marathon's most compelling theme."
