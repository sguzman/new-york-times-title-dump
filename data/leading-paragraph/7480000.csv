I never thought I would be excited to see a van, especially a white, 15-seat Ford E-350 Super Duty XLT. (I fancy myself more of a vintage-Jaguar kind of girl.) But after a few days hiking the hills above Laguna Beach, Calif., which looked innocuous in the distance but felt like Kilimanjaro as I walked up them, the sight of Blanche, as I named her, at the end of the trail was pure ecstasy. I'd been at Blue Pearl Laguna, a new holistic retreat (read: boot camp) nestled in Laguna Canyon, for three days and 30 hours worth of yoga, hiking, gym workouts, more yoga, tai chi, nutrition lectures and very little food. I'd traded my Lanvin and Louboutins for a frightening bush hat, dirt-colored hiking shoes and one of those water backpacks with a tube that leads to your mouth. I no longer bothered to brush my hair. Or apply mascara. I had turned into someone I didn't recognize. I had become sporty."

And that story, recounted by the princess in her letters and repeated in almost every account of Rilke's life, sums up much that's distinct and singular about Trieste and its environs: its isolation, wedged as it is on the far eastern coast of Italy, between a steep limestone escarpment and the deep blue sea; its fierce weather mitigated by solid comforts; its muted splendor; and its reputation as a haven for distinguished exiles, outsiders and eccentrics - especially writers, of whom Trieste has hosted a great many. Aside from Rilke, there was Casanova, whose memoirs end with his sojourn in Trieste, and Stendahl, who served as a consul here, as did Richard Burton (the half-mad explorer, not the actor), who disliked the place and bided his time by translating the Kama Sutra and the Arabian Nights. Johann Joachim Winckelmann, the pioneering German art historian, died here - murdered by a robber in his hotel room. At the age of 20, Freud spent some time in the city, dissecting eels as part of his medical training. The poet Filippo Marinetti started his Futurist movement here, with an evening of theater, readings, manifestos and mayhem. James Joyce accomplished most of his life's work while teaching English to Triestini, and Italo Svevo was born and raised here. The great travel essayist Jan Morris chose Trieste as the subject of her final book, and its subtitle - ''The Meaning of Nowhere'' - perhaps gives some insight into why, of all these figures, only Svevo was a local. Trieste is where you go to reinvent yourself, to be left alone, if you want - or not, if you don't."

2011-03-27T00:00:00Z,"More than 2,000 young Burmese gathered on the lawn of the Mya Yeik Nyo Hotel in Yangon last month for a Valentine's Day hip-hop concert. In many places, the scene would have been unremarkable. But Myanmar has been ruled by a military junta for decades; its anti-Western, conservative culture is marked by political and sexual repression. In 2005, the government drew international criticism when it suspended the magazine Han Thit (New Style) for running a Valentine's Day celebration advertisement. But on this occasion, among the young at least, the mood was uninhibited. Boys kissed girls. Girls kissed girls. They chanted aloud, dressed in jeans and sneakers and miniskirts, fueled by whiskey and beer. ''I want to change things, but here, if you say something, you're either dead or in prison for 200 years,'' one participant, the son of a retired colonel, said. ''So what do you do besides take advantage of this life?''"
2011-03-27T00:00:00Z,"Alexandria Schmidt, 18: A Marine told us that a perfect score was 70 seconds. I was going to try to hang there as long as I could. One of the Marines said that when you sing a song in your head, it really helps you through pain. ''Old MacDonald'' was what came into my head. I made it 30 seconds. I definitely could have gone 45 seconds if I hadn't started laughing. I heard a Marine shout, ''Don't let go,'' and it made me laugh, and it made me lose my song, and that's when I started slipping. I do choir and drama -- I don't do sports, so I was actually pretty impressed by myself. I think I was the longest up there, except maybe for this one itty-bitty girl who was just floating up there because she's so tiny. Whenever I had tried to do that at the gym, I couldn't even pull myself up. I figured I did it because of the Marines. I don't want to be a Marine -- I just have respect for them. They do so much for us, so I told myself: I can do this. I can try."
2011-03-27T00:00:00Z,"AHERN--Bishop Patrick D.D. The D'Urso family gives praise and thanks to God for the life of an extraordinary priest and beloved friend, His Excellency Patrick Ahern, D.D, who was ""a Special Gift from God."" A Priest for over 65 years, Bishop Ahern served as secretary to two cardinals in the Archdiocese of New York, first Cardinal Spellman and then our saintly Cardinal Cooke, and was appointed bishop by Pope John Paul VI in 1970. Bishop Ahern's priesthood was truly an imitation of Christ and a reflection of his deep love for the Blessed Mother and St. Therese of the Child Jesus, whose spirituality, humility and great joy radiated in his smile, good humor, and authentic compassion for all people, especially disabled. The D'Urso family cherishes many happy memories of times shared with Bishop Ahern on all of our March birthdays with Bishop Sheridan and particularly our Christmas dinners over 12 years, when Bishop Ahern became part of our family. We will always treasure those beautiful, unforgettable moments of joy and are forever grateful to Bishop Ahern for his invaluable friendship. I will never forget Bishop Ahern traveling all the way to Pennsylvania for my beloved mother's funeral 20 years ago, as Cardinal O'Connor was on his way to Rome. Our family has restored many items in the Papal Sacristy of the Vatican Museums. Among them are two chests of Leo XIII in honor of two treasures of our Church, Bishop Patrick Ahern and Bishop Patrick Sheridan who served our Church so faithfully for so many years. the Church has truly lost a Great Priest. What a consolation that Our Lord would receive Bishop Ahern into eternal life on the 41st anniversary of his ordination as bishop and on the Feast of St. Joseph. St. Therese must have showered him with rose pedals, as the angels brought him to meet Our Lord. Jesus must have said to him, ""Well Done, Good and Faithful Servant."" We love you dearly, Your Excellency. We will never forget your smile, and you will always be in our hearts! With dearest love, prayers and admiration, Florence B. D'Urso and family."

In April of 1961, an English art-school screw-up and musician named John Lennon stepped into a doorway in the St. Pauli neighborhood of Hamburg, Germany, and had his image snapped by a local photographer named Jurgen Vollmer. That black-and-white picture is now an iconic symbol of the days when Lennon and his band - hopped up on Holsten beer and over-the-counter uppers called Preludin - played marathon shows, fraternized with strippers and, along the way, became the Beatles, forever enshrining Hamburg's improbable place in the rock cosmology. As Lennon put it, ''I grew up in Hamburg, not Liverpool.''"

A Houston resident since 1983, she was passionate about reading, writing, and the visual arts, and was vibrant, engaged, and tireless in promoting and developing these art forms here and elsewhere. She was Vice President of the Board of Trustees of The Menil Collection, and Chairman of Nominating and Governance Committee there. She joined the Inprint board in 1990, served as President and Chairman, and remained very active on their University of Houston Liaison Committee. In February, Inprint honored her, along with others, for her many contributions to creative writing and literature. Marion was also a board member and past President of ""Gulf Coast: A Journal of Literature and Fine Arts,"" and honored at their last annual Gala; as well as a former board member of the Chinati Foundation; the Alley Theatre, where she was also honored for her work on their Gala evening; and an Advisory Board member of the Houston Seminar.

2011-03-27T00:00:00Z,"One of the primary pleasures of travel magazines is that they teach us how to explore the world with efficiency and grace. Sometimes this is in the spirit of escapism and fun, and sometimes it serves other purposes. Sean Penn's decision to spend most of the past year in Haiti trying to provide housing, health care and basic services to 50,000 people left homeless after the earthquake of January 2010 adds extraordinary heft to the notion that travel is more than tourism. What I find most moving in Zoë Heller's remarkable profile of Penn (''The Accidental Activist,'' Page 82) is the actor's commitment to that country and its citizens, and his fundamental belief in the beauty that lies there beneath the devastation. Joumana Haddad is another star -- she is considered the Oprah of Lebanon -- who sees bright possibilities in dark times. Haddad is an editor, journalist and commentator whose embracing of eroticism and women's sexual expressiveness has made her a controversial figure in Beirut. Nina Burleigh traveled to that city to interview Haddad, and the story she brought back (''Sex and the Souk,'' Page 64) is a riveting view of a society in flux."

2011-03-27T00:00:00Z,"The seaside town of Margate, England, a thriving summer playground until its decline in the 1970s, is counting on the Turner Contemporary to revive its fortunes. Opening April 16, this striking museum - designed by David Chipperfield and named for the painter J. M. W. Turner, one of Margate's famous visitors - has already spurred new galleries, pubs and cafes, as well as the restoration of Dreamland, a 1920s amusement park down the road. And it has inspired a lyrical new work by Tracey Emin, who grew up in Margate. Her pink neon sculpture ''I Never Stopped Loving You'' hangs adjacent to the museum. (Hundreds of people showed up to cheer its installation last year.) ''There is more of an appetite for contemporary art here than you might imagine,'' says Victoria Pomery, the Turner's founding director. The inaugural show presents six artists whose works relate to a little-known Turner canvas depicting the Soufriere volcano on St. Vincent. ''We want to help audiences get a better sense of the contemporary through the historical,'' Pomery says. ''And we will always have a Turner presence.'' Adds Emin, ''The other nice thing about the Turner is that it will have a really beautiful cafe, so people like my 82-year-old mum can go and look out at the sea and have a nice cup of tea.''

2011-03-27T00:00:00Z,"BERLIN--Jerry, 89, passed away peacefully on March 13th in Michigan at the sides of his brother, Robert, and niece, Ellen Mahoney. Raised in Newark and born the eldest child to Molly and Louis, Jerry was a lifelong New Yorker. Educated at the University of Chicago and earning an A.B., he remained a proud alum. Jerry spent his career at sea as a merchant marine, captaining ferries between the Cape and Islands during some summers. When not at sea, he split his time between his residence in Greenwich Village, and by the side of the late Mary O'Brien of New Jersey, to whom he was a devoted partner for more than three decades. A voracious reader and prolific writer eschewing television - Jerry consumed letters from family and friends made around the world and remained a loyal correspondent. Using a Smith Corona, he produced a treasure trove of letters, aphorisms, poems, and manuscripts. He also served as an enthusiastic and generous editor and reviewer for his literary friends. Jerry lived life like a native New Yorker. A consummate world traveler and global thinker, he consistently promoted the value of education and bemoaned the state of this country's education system. Sitting on the front stoop of his Village brownstone, he befriended countless people, often learning about their journeys to America. A doting uncle, he loved children and quickly won them over with his rollicking nature. Jerry is the brother of Robert Berlin, of Beverly Hills, Michigan and the former Arthur Berlin of Evanston, Illinois. He is survived by his nieces Ellen Mahoney of Bloomfield Hills, Michigan, Linda Berlin of Burlington, Vermont, and Leslie Starsoneck of Raleigh, North Carolina and by his nephews Stephen Lewin-Berlin of Acton, Massachusetts, and Andrew Berlin of Gloucester, Massachusetts."

2011-03-27T00:00:00Z,"The Youth Issue: It's both a straightforward description of what you're about to read and a more evocative phrase -- as in, What exactly is our issue with youth? Not with the concept (which everyone seems to be pretty much eternally enamored of) but with the demographic. Judging by recent cultural portrayals, we are currently befuddled by and/or terrified of the young -- whether they're cold-eyed, ambitious automatons (Jesse Eisenberg's take on the friendless Mark Zuckerberg in ''The Social Network'') or vaguely threatening, hypercompetent agents of our obsolescence (Saoirse Ronan in the coming ''Hanna,'' in which she plays a teenager trained to murder Cate Blanchett, her surrogate pseudo-mom). Meanwhile, the young (or at least those youths who aren't busy fomenting historic revolution overseas) are often lumped together as a drifting generation, faced with a bankrupt government, genuinely dire employment prospects and a generally dismal tomorrow. We're repeatedly told that they are distracted and listless, their brains hot-wired and short-circuited by an overload of neurally frazzling technologies. None of which will be confirmed, or even supported, on the pages that follow. Because if these youths -- a pair of tech geniuses (and best friends), a soccer sensation, a tween idol, a poker phenom and a generally upbeat crew of California high-school students -- are lost, or drifting, or facing futures even bleaker than today, it certainly hasn't registered with them. But then, this is the enduring gift of youth, when we ''post-youths'' shut up long enough to listen: not to what we can tell them, but to what they will tell us."

Two elderly brothers run the shop, which they inherited from their mother. I often go in to buy T-shirts (rung up on a cash register that, like the brothers, is old but still working). When my friend and I walked by the store, she remarked that she loved it. I told her I did, too, especially because the brothers were perversely opposed to raising prices and you could get a three-pack of men's briefs for $5.

Before there were skyscrapers and restaurants, the city's wealth was measured in flora and fauna. Early Dutch sailors were disoriented by the scent of wildflowers wafting out to sea from Manhattan. Even today, forests, marshes and meadows cover nearly one-eighth of the city. But it is not a safe haven for flowers. Of 1,357 native plant species documented in New York City's history, only 778 remain here. There are various reasons for their disappearance, but always the causal factor is human -- a pest we accidentally introduced, a habitat we made unwelcoming or destroyed altogether. Our urban lives are impoverished in their absence. Here is a selection of plants that have vanished from the city. Some thrive elsewhere; others are barely hanging on. And one has recently reappeared in New York City, a signal of hope in a concrete landscape."

In 1972, he was approached by his friend and fellow outdoor advertising colleague, Karl Eller, who asked him to run his national sales office for Combined Communications, an outdoor and broadcast media company based in New York. Ever the entrepreneur, in 1975 Mr. Ackerley purchased Obie Media in Seattle, WA. This company would become the foundation on which a national media and entertainment empire would be built, one day becoming The Ackerley Group, Inc., listed on the New York Stock Exchange. In 2002, when The Ackerley Group, Inc. was acquired by Clear Channel Worldwide, the company owned and operated 18 television stations, five radio stations and outdoor advertising operations in six states and over 20 markets. In 1983, Mr. Ackerley purchased the Seattle SuperSonics of the National Basketball Association to ensure the team would remain in Seattle, WA. Over the next 18 years, the Sonics became the region's most successful professional sports franchise. During his tenure as Owner, the Sonics appeared in the NBA playoffs 13 times which included four Pacific Division Championships, one Western Conference Championship and an appearance in the 1996 NBA Finals. Ever the innovator, Mr. Ackerley was one of the first sports owners in America to broadcast the team's games on both radio and television stations that he owned reaching more Sonics fans than ever before. Following the creation of Full House Sports & Entertainment under Mr. Ackerley's leadership, two successful sports franchises were launched: the Seattle SeaDogs of the Continental Indoor Soccer League who would win the 1997 CISL Championship and the Seattle Storm of the Women's National Basketball Association. Mr. Ackerley's record of community service and philanthropy both professionally and personally spanned over three decades and impacted communities across America. Through Ackerley Corporate Giving, the philanthropic arm of The Ackerley Group, the company annually contributed six percent of its annual gross revenues in cash and in-kind services to the communities it served. Additionally, in 1997, Mr. Ackerley and his wife Ginger established The Ginger and Barry Ackerley Foundation which focuses on early childhood education throughout the state of Washington. Mr. Ackerley was the recipient of many lifetime achievement awards. Among them were the Roosevelt High School (Des Moines, Iowa) Alumnus of the Year and the Sigma Chi Fraternity's Significant Sig Award. Along with his wife Ginger, Mr. Ackerley received the Corporate Council for the Arts Lifetime Achievement in the Arts award, the Anti-Defamation League's Torch of Liberty Award, Junior Achievement's Stanley O. McNaughton Award and became a Laureate of the Puget Sound Business Journal's Hall of Fame. Mr. Ackerley was deeply devoted family man. He enjoyed boating in the Pacific Northwest with his family; summers on San Juan Island with his grandchildren and winters in the California desert with family and friends. Mr. Ackerley is survived by his wife Ginger, his daughter Kim Ackerley Cleworth, his two sons Christopher and Ted Ackerley and seven grandchildren Henry, Atty, Charlie, Anabelle, Benjamin, Hunter and Ashley. Memorial services will be held at 12:00pm on Thursday, April 7th at St. Mark's Cathedral, 1245 10th Avenue East, Seattle, WA with the Rev. Doyt L. Conn, Jr. presiding. In lieu of flowers, the family requests contributions be directed to: Eisenhower Medical Hospital/Foundation 39000 Bob Hope Drive, Rancho Mirage, CA 92270."
2011-03-27T00:00:00Z,"When Hotel Americano opens next month in New York, it will be the 11th hotel in 11 years from Grupo Habita, a company not well known north of the border but considered Mexico's boutique hotel pioneer in the Ian Schrager mold. The Americano is also the company's first venture stateside, a 56-room property in a 10-story building designed by the Mexican architect Enrique Norten (who also designed Hotel Habita, the company's first property in Mexico City) with interiors by the Parisian designer Arnaud Montigny. On an industrial block of gallery-packed west Chelsea, the hotel is well poised to be an art-world home base. ''Because of where it's located it has to be a little bit industrial, a little bit gritty,'' says Carlos Couturier, co-founder of Grupo Habita. Norten's design for the glass building includes metal mesh cladding and an exterior elevator that ferries restaurant patrons from street level directly to the rooftop restaurant and pool. (A separate, interior elevator provides access to guest rooms.) A modern ethos - whether with a vintage bent or one more of this century - permeates both public and private spaces. Guest rooms feature Kengo Kuma-style, low-to-the-ground platform beds and black vinyl Zanotta bean bag chairs alongside less aggressively slick accouterments like touch-tone phones, denim bathrobes by Loden Dager (which also outfitted the staff) and harmonicas for sale in the minibar. In-room iPads are loaded with music as well as the Hotel Americano version of a city guide, with regularly updated listings of things to do, both in the ZIP code and beyond. Some north-facing rooms have views of the Empire State Building, but to Couturier, ''the best rooms in the house are the ones where you're looking at fire escapes. That's how you know you're in New York, not Paris or Shanghai.''"
2011-03-27T00:00:00Z,"SANDIFER--Lucie Eveleen Dourif, August 27, 1919 to March 12, 2011. Born in Haute Savoie, France and raised in Paris, she was the daughter of Major Henri Dourif and Eveleen Huillard Dourif of Paris and Huntington, West Virginia where Major Dourif co-founded the chemical and color company, SUCO. She graduated from Vassar College in 1941 with a BA in English, and later from Columbia Teacher's College with an MA in Early Childhood Education. She maintained a lifelong interest in children, education and France. During the war, she taught at Greenwich Settlement House in New York City, and was active in French war relief efforts. In 1945, she married Navy Lt. John Seay Sandifer, a graduate of Yale School of Architecture and the Beaux Arts in Paris. Following the birth of their first child, they moved from New York City to Greenwich, CT where the family grew to five children: Henri-Philippe of Guilford, CT; Michael of Greenwich, CT; Claire of Paris, France; John of Paris, France, and Nicole of Durham, CT. In Connecticut, Lucie Sandifer taught French at St. Mary's, and the Greenwich High School for many years. She was also active as President in the Alliance Francaise of Greenwich, and she was a founding member of the French American Aid for Children in New York City, serving as its President from 1955 to 1965. She was married for sixty-one years to her husband, who predeceased her in 2007. Later in life, they devoted considerable energy to restoring La Tourbeille, the family home in the Dordogne region of France. She is survived by her five children, ten grandchildren and two great-grandchildren."

2011-03-27T00:00:00Z,"Minnesota catcher Joe Mauer has won three American League batting titles and was the A.L.'s most valuable player in 2009. He is the cover athlete for MLB 11 the Show, the new PlayStation game that features 3-D technology. Mauer, 27, who signed an eight-year, $184 million extension with the Twins before last season, was in Manhattan recently to promote the game. Q.Do you consider yourself the best player in baseball?A.I consider myself to be a good baseball player, definitely. I think there's more important things out there than just saying, ''I'm the best.'' I'd like to be on the best team and win the World Series. I'm confident in what I can do, and I work hard at trying to become better and better.Q.Before you signed an extension with the Twins, did you consider the possibility of being a Yankee?A.I'd be lying to say that I didn't. It's something that you're curious about when you consider testing the free-agent market, but looking back on it, I always wanted to be a Twin because I grew up in Minnesota. My ultimate goal is winning a World Series, and I think we can do that in Minnesota, so I'm happy to stay home.Q.What is it like to have grown up in Minnesota and now be its biggest baseball star?A.It's pretty crazy. It's great to be able to have my parents and grandparents at every home game; it's something I value a lot. To see your family and friends around all the time, it's pretty neat. Everyone still treats me the same, and I wouldn't have it any other way.Q.Who are some of the toughest pitchers you have faced?A.Obviously, there are a lot of great pitchers, a lot of guys who go out there and everything seems to be working for them. C. C. Sabathia seems to have a lot of those days, and others who come to mind are Zack Greinke and Felix Hernandez. They always seem to be on top of their game.Q.Jorge Posada of the Yankees will be used as a designated hitter and not catch as often as he used to. Do you dread that fate late in your career?A.Jorge has been a great player for a long time, and it's pretty amazing to see what he has been able to do over his career. But he's a little bit older, and you can't play baseball forever. I think when I get to that point where I'm not catching as much, hopefully I can help the team in other areas.Q.What is your forecast for the Twins' season?A.We're going to go out and try and win the division again and try to get back to the playoffs. That's our goal every year, and we feel like we have a good shot to do that. My main goal is to put a World Series ring on my finger.Q.You have had trouble hitting home runs at Target Field. Are you worried about that?A.Well, it was a new park for us, and much like David Wright at Citi Field, I had some trouble getting used to a new park. I'm not too concerned about hitting home runs, so I'm not going to adjust my swing. I'm more concerned about winning ballgames.Q.With the Metrodome roof collapsing during the football season, are you happy the Twins are no longer playing there?A.Yeah, I'm happy we're out of there. I don't know what we would have done if we had to play a full season there. I'm happy to be playing baseball at Target Field, outdoors. It's pretty good.Q.Who was your baseball idol growing up?A.I really admired Kent Hrbek and Kirby Puckett, I enjoyed the way they played the game. Hrbek was a Minnesota guy who played at home, like me, and Puckett always had a smile on his face, so they would be my favorites."

2011-03-27T00:00:00Z,"Related: Adventures in Humanitarian Tourism On a hot morning in January, at the Petionville Internally Displaced Person camp in suburban Port-au-Prince, Haiti, a four-wheel dirt bike pulled up outside the tent hospital, bearing an elderly woman with a deep gash in her cheek. While a group of medics assisted the patient inside, Sean Penn ambled over from under a tree where he had been having a meeting with one of his camp workers. He walked with a slightly bowlegged cowboy gait, a walkie-talkie crackling at his waistband, a cigarette dangling from his mouth. Having glanced into the tent and ascertained that the situation was in hand, he turned his rather dour gaze on a newly arrived reporter. Penn has never had conventional movie-star looks, but he does have the arguably superior gift of a magnificently interesting face. When he is in grooming mode, he tends to shellac his hair into a high, rather splendid, Little Richard-style pompadour, but today, as on most days in Haiti, the hair had been allowed to collapse into a dusty quiff. With his big, arrow-shaped nose and his heavy eyelids hanging at half-mast, he emanated the slightly sinister allure of a fairground carny. ''You ready to see the camp?'' he muttered."

A five-hour drive north from San Francisco, Humboldt is a mostly rural coastal region a little less than twice the size of Delaware, inhabited by 129,000 or so artists, back-to-the-landers, outdoorsfolk, slow-food entrepreneurs and urban refugees who found the Upper Haight too staid. The county is also home to a large community of people whose knack for growing high-quality marijuana has made ''Humboldt'' a sacred word to dope smokers worldwide. Cannabis cultivation is more or less rampant throughout the county, though the outdoor industrial-scale plantations lie mostly in southern Humboldt (''SoHum,'' to locals), where rough-hewn settlements give off an aura of people being up to something. A fair proportion of homes visible to highway traffic have additions built of plastic sheeting. Much of SoHum's population lives up rutted, hillside tracks where tourists, locals caution, would be most unwise to venture on their own."

The rest of the CBS lineup drew slightly smaller audiences: ""The Amazing Race"" (roughly 10.9 million), ""Undercover Boss"" (11.8 million) and ""CSI: Miami"" (10.6 million).

They found that a fairly small number of people who use Twitter generate an awful lot of the posts. As with many things Webby (e.g. Wikipedia), Twitter empowers a small set of superusers. It also extends the reach of existing elites - specifically celebrities and us old-media peeps (joined by new-media bloggers)."

The rugs' abstract, wildly colorful, intensely personal designs make them catnip to creative types like Davis and Provisor. They came home with 33 rugs, which they are exhibiting at their SoHo showroom for two weeks beginning April 28. Along with the boucherouites, the show will include the spoils of one of the couple's frequent trips to China, where Fort Street's factory is located: seven Chinese art rugs from the 1980s, including one by LeRoy Neiman that depicts the floor of the New York Stock Exchange.

2011-03-29T10:01:53Z,"One of President Obama's recurrent rhetorical tropes during the 2008 campaign was the ""false choice"" maneuver, in which he would distance himself from straw men of the left and right to better sell himself as a post-partisan figure. He made the same move last night, defending his administration's Libya policy by distancing himself from the ""some"" who ""question why America should intervene at all,"" and the ""others"" who ""have suggested that we broaden our military mission beyond the task of protecting the Libyan people, and do whatever it takes to bring down Qaddafi and usher in a new government."" The proper course, the president argued, lay somewhere in between, with an intervention designed to save civilian lives, prevent a destabilizing refugee crisis, and ""stop Qaddafi's forces in their tracks,"" without committing American power (and American troops, and American money ...) to the task of changing Libya's regime outright. Here was his defense of of making war (a word he never used, of course) on Qaddafi's regime while stopping short of toppling the dictator directly:"

The show's focus is on the Republic of Benin, where voodoo orginated, and the objects can be mind-boggling in their dense, everything-but-the-kitchen-sink assemblage. But according to the exhibition's co-curator, Leanne Sacramone, we can now only imagine the circumstances of their creation.

2011-03-29T06:00:22Z,"During a lengthy debate on the wisdom of my Mike Stanton pick in the fourth round of the 14-team Yahoo! Friends and Family League, a couple of the commenters panned the pick, citing the possibility that Stanton would struggle would because of his low contact rate and get sent down to the minors. They estimated the chance at 20 percent. Whether that's true (I think 20 is too high, and if so, that would mean he was playing badly enough to get sent down, which means getting sent down would hardly make things worse), the argument boils down to this: ""Stanton is a bad pick in the fourth round of a 14-team mixed league because his non-injury-related floor is too low."" Setting aside the merits of the argument about Stanton in particular (which are laid out in detail in the debate linked above), I think the argument misses a key point generally."

Born in Brooklyn on July 22, 1923, he was a proud alumnus of Poly Prep Day School in Brooklyn and Yale University. He honorably served in the U.S. Navy in World War II. Mr. Streicher was a revered Wall Street executive, the senior member of J. Streicher & Co. LLC, a family-owned and operated brokerage business founded by his father more than a century ago, and a Member of the NYSE for over 50 years. A lifelong animal enthusiast, Jud typified all that is good in the sport of dogs. He was kind to everyone he met in a career spanning more than 50 years, as a judge in obedience trials throughout the country before retiring with emeritus status in 2000. His guidance and leadership encompassed such well-known clubs as the American Boxer Club, where he earned the Lifetime Achievement award in 2001; the Westchester Kennel Club; the Westminster Kennel Club; the Tuxedo Park Kennel Club; the Port Chester Obedience Club; The Palm Beach Dog Fanciers Association; and the Peggy Adams Animal Rescue League. In 2010, he received a Certificate of Honor from the American Kennel Club for service as an AKC delegate for the entire first decade of the 21st Century. Through Galanjud Kennel, he and Gale bred and showed Boxers and an occasional Standard Poodle in both conformation and obedience, winning several obedience and Best in Show titles. Jud was the 9th recipient of the Langdon Skarda Award in 2004. The couple raised miniature horses at their farm in Chester, and enjoyed a long career in thoroughbred race horses through Streicher Stables and Centennial Farms. He loved this sport of kings and savored victories at many tracks. With his beloved Gale, Mr. Streicher traveled extensively throughout the world. He enjoyed lacrosse, swimming, and backgammon and had a passion for photography and golf. He was a loyal fan of NY football Giants and the NY Mets baseball team. Jud's honest, quiet strength, undying friendship and loyalty above all else are the character traits of this man; the world has lost a true gentleman. Mr. Streicher is survived by his wife of 67 years, Dorothy Gale; a daughter, Katherine O'Brien; a son, James Streicher; and his Standard Poodle Danny. In lieu of flowers, kindly send donations to: Take the Lead, (P.O.Box 6353 Watertown, NY 13601), the Peggy Adams Animal Rescue League (3200 N.

(49) MONEY AND MARCH MADNESS With the Final Four now set for this year's N.C.A.A. men's basketball championship, ''Frontline'' delves into the multibillion-dollar business of the National Collegiate Athletic Association and its brand of amateur sports. Lowell Bergman interviews Sonny Vaccaro, above, a former marketing executive at Nike, Adidas and Reebok who helped bring about the commercialization of college basketball, which last year resulted in a $10.8 billion, 14-year contract for the tournament with CBS and Turner Broadcasting. Now Mr. Vaccaro is leading a class-action suit aimed at getting college athletes, who traditionally have not been paid, a piece of the pie, and accusing the N.C.A.A. of preventing players from profiting from the use of their images and likenesses in licensed merchandise. Other ''Frontline'' segments include a portrait of Ai Weiwei, a global art star armed with a video camera and a growing Twitter following who is sometimes called China's Andy Warhol; and an interview with Brian Manning, the father of the imprisoned former military intelligence analyst Pfc. Bradley E. Manning, who maintains that his son did not hand over secret government documents to WikiLeaks. 8 P.M.

But this year Mr. Burns gets a platform all to himself: the festival's organizers said on Monday that the closing night film of its 2011 program would be ''Newlyweds,'' which Mr. Burns wrote, directed and stars in. It is the latest in a series of films (including ''Ash Wednesday,'' ''Looking for Kitty'' and ''Purple Violets'') that have made their debuts at Tribeca. A news release from the Tribeca Film Festival described ''Newlyweds'' as ''a chronicle of modern marriage'' that follows ''a newly wedded couple whose honeymoon period is upended by the arrival of the husband's wild-child baby sister and the crumbling marriage of the wife's meddlesome sister.'' In addition to Mr. Burns, the cast includes Caitlin Fitzgerald, Max Baker, Marsha Dietlein Bennett and Kerry Bishe. The film is to have its premiere on April 30 at the Tribeca Performing Arts Center at the Borough of Manhattan Community College. The full festival runs from April 20 through May 1."

Amy Adams, an Academy Award nominee for ''The Fighter,'' ''Doubt'' and ''Junebug,'' will play that fearless Daily Planet reporter and sometime paramour to the Man of Steel and his alter ego, Clark Kent. In a statement to The Hollywood Reporter, Mr. Snyder described Ms. Adams as ''one of the most versatile and respected actresses in films today'' with ''the talent to capture all of the qualities we love about Lois: smart, tough, funny, warm, ambitious and, of course, beautiful.'' Warner Brothers had previously announced that Mr. Snyder's Superman movie, planned for a 2012 release, would starHenry Cavill (of ''The Tudors'') as the title red-and-blue hero, and Kevin Costner and Diane Lane as his adoptive parents, Jonathan and Martha Kent. No word yet who might play other familiar characters like Perry White or Jimmy Olsen, or who would be the villains of the film. (Here's hoping that unlike ''Sucker Punch,'' it won't be the critics.)"

Cherished husband of the late Jean Hogan Hickey, his bride of 56 years, adored father of Elizabeth Hickey Lavin of Pelham Manor, NY, Frank Hickey, Magee Hickey Salembier and Jane Hickey Sexton, all of New York City, and beloved father-in-law of Tom Lavin, Rick Salembier and Mason Speed Sexton. He was the devoted grandfather of 11: Tom, Kate, Meg, Jack and Janie Lavin, Lily and Floy Salembier, Mason, Buckman, Keats and Daisy Sexton and beloved grandfather-in-law of Scott Phillips. He was a special friend of Miao Hua Zhou. He was lovingly cared for by Felicidad Collado, Astou Diop, Nur Purnamawaty and so many others. Mr. Hickey, born in Brooklyn, was a graduate of the University of Notre Dame class of 1942. He served in World War II as a lieutenant senior grade USN in the Pacific. He received the William D. Reynolds Award in 1992 from Notre Dame and was the Notre Dame Club of New York ""Man of the Year"" in 1993. He also received an Honorary Degree of Doctor of Humane Letters in 1995 from St. John's University. After retiring from his family's concrete business, M.F. Hickey Company, which was founded by his grandfather in 1896, Mr. Hickey spent the last three decades helping the mentally retarded and emotionally disturbed children of New York City. He served on the Board of the Kennedy Child Study Center for decades. Mr. Hickey was head of the Parish Council, Eucharistic Minister, lector, and altar server at Saint Vincent Ferrer Church. He was also a member of the board of Astor Services for Children for many years. During that time, he oversaw the purchase and renovation of a two-room, Victorian Gothic schoolhouse known as ""The Little Red Schoolhouse."" It was renamed in honor of him and is now called the Lawrence F. Hickey Center for Child Development, a therapeutic early childhood development program. In addition, Mr. Hickey was a past president of the Neighborhood Coalition for Shelter, The Amateur Comedy Club and The Jones Wood Association. He was chief Honorary Usher and a lector at St. Patrick's Cathedral, a Knight Equestrian of the Holy Sepulchre of Jerusalem and a Knight of Malta. The Daughters of Charity recognized him for his work at the Kennedy and Astor facilities by naming him an ""Affiliate"" of the Order in 1990. Mr. Hickey was a member of the Friends of Cardinal Cooke Guild and an early member of the Bishop Fulton J. Sheen Foundation promoting the case for sainthood. When asked why he spent his retirement years helping others, Mr. Hickey wrote: ""Lessons learned on the campus of Notre Dame, from my Irish Catholic background, and a tour of 49 months in the Navy in WWII, convinced me that we all must help God's less fortunate."" And in his final years, nothing made him happier than to be surrounded by his large and adoring circle of family and friends in his weekend home in Millerton, New York. The wake will be held at Frank E. Campbell, 1076 Madison Avenue at 81st Street on Thursday from 6 to 9pm. The Funeral Mass will be held at Saint Patrick's Cathedral at 10am, Friday.

The 2004 ruling by Stanley R. Ott of the Montgomery County Orphans' Court permitted the foundation, which had struggled financially, to go against the wishes of Albert C. Barnes, who built the collection and stipulated that no picture in it could be lent, sold or moved from the walls of the galleries that he built for it in Merion. Judge Ott said at the time that he considered the move ''the only viable alternative'' to save the Barnes from bankruptcy, but opponents argued that the foundation's troubles had been overstated.On Tuesday a lawyer for the Friends of the Barnes Foundation, a community group that opposes the move, asked Judge Ott to reconsider the decision because of statements that Michael Fisher, who was Pennsylvania's attorney general when the case was heard, made in the documentary suggesting that though his role was to represent the public, including opponents of the move, in the case, he had applied pressure to help ensure the move. Mr. Fisher said in an interview in the movie that he communicated with officials at Lincoln University, who controlled the Barnes Foundation board, and warned them that his office ''would have to take some action'' to change the composition of the board unless they agreed to the move, which was sought by members Philadelphia's political establishment."

Earlier this month, Mr. Dodd took charge of the motion picture association, an industry trade group, after a long career in politics. In his first major public address, Mr. Dodd said he was not unduly alarmed by a sharp drop at the box-office, as domestic ticket sales fell by about 19% in the first quarter of 2011 compared to the same period last year, according to figures from Hollywood.com, an entertainment Web site that tracks ticket sales. ''I for one do not believe the sky is falling,'' Mr. Dodd said, according to a copy of remarks prepared for the occasion. On the positive side, he said one in five dollars spent at the domestic box-office now comes from 3-D screenings, pointing to the power of new technology."

Phase 2 of the promotion is a lot less 21st century. On Tuesday, the day that CD and vinyl LP versions of ''The King of Limbs'' were released (along with another release of the download), the band distributed copies of a free 12-page newspaper called The Universal Sigh at 61 locations around the world, including three in Manhattan. Although there's little in the newspaper that explicitly advertises the album (the title and a few scattered lyrics are all that one reader/listener could find on a quick perusal), its existence to some extent also promotes yet another iteration of ''The King of Limbs'': a deluxe edition, which costs about $50 and includes two vinyl records, a CD, a download and artwork ''all in a special 'newspaper' format,'' the band said.The Universal Sigh was released at 1 p.m. on Tuesday, and at about 1:20, the Times Square distribution spot was fairly quiet. Three young people, one with an old-fashioned paperboy bag slung over his shoulder, held up copies of the paper and asked passers by, ''Are you a Radiohead fan?'' Most people apparently weren't, because a reporter worried about being 20 minutes late to the release had an easier time getting a copy than one usually would for discounted Broadway tickets at the TKTS booth."

2011-03-31T10:14:30Z,"By the calendar it has been spring for more than a week, but the Manhattan farmers' markets remain in winter mode, and our home vegetable bin contains onions (and their kin), carrots, parsnips, celery root and not much else. These, of course, are the foundations of many a dish, so there's no ground for complaint. Yet with company coming, I needed to come up with a delicious and, preferably, unexpected first course. A slice of onion tart is always a nice way to start a meal -- who could ever get tired of onions? Plus, I had already cooked a couple of pounds of onions in butter, and these were waiting in the refrigerator (keeping cooked onions at the ready is a great time saver, as they can kick-start innumerable preparations)."

2011-03-31T10:00:52Z,"Precocious and self-possessed, Charlotte Perriand was a girl among men, admitted to the ranks of the architects whose names would become synonymous with the new century, at an age when her outlook on design and the world was still in formation. In what would prove to be one of Modernism's signal images, she reclines in the chaise longue she designed in collaboration with Le Corbusier and his cousin Pierre Jeanneret. It was, in Le Corbusier's utopian terms, a ""machine for resting in,"" and as if to remind us that it's the chair, not the woman, being presented for our consideration, her face is turned away; she is at once familiar and unrecognizable. That the design of their now-famous furniture was for many years attributed to Le Corbusier alone, that most of her architectural projects never made it past the drawing board, that her far-ranging commissions defied easy classification, that her most significant projects are either gone or off the beaten path: all this only contributed to the enigma. Now, 12 years after her death, at 96, ""Charlotte Perriand: Photography: A Wide-Angle Eye,"" by Jacques Barsac (5 Continents Editions), offers an intimate glimpse of the woman and the workings of her mind."

Dianne Wiest and Amy Ryan also starred, as Dr. Weston's own therapists. And while a cigar is sometimes just a cigar, HBO seemed to suggest that this cancellation was not necessarily a cancellation. In a statement, the network said: ""It's true that we have no plans to continue with 'In Treatment' as previously formatted. However, we are in continued conversations with the executive producers to find another way to continue telling these rich stories."""

Mr. Hawass, a powerful figure in the world of Egyptology, was promoted to a cabinet position in the early days of the uprising, and drew the animosity of the revolutionaries by saying at the time that Mr. Mubarak should be allowed to hold power for another six months. He also said that Egypt's museums and archeological sites were largely secure and that cases of looting were very limited. In the weeks that followed, that turned out not to be the case: several dozen objects were stolen from the Egyptian Museum in Cairo during a break-in on Jan. 28 - many have been recovered, though 37 are still missing - and hundreds more were taken from tombs and warehouses elsewhere in Egypt."

To check if Zoom feature inadvertently got turned on, press the Option-Command-8 keys to see if the setting reverses itself.

These supporters say they do not want to get too far ahead of themselves, and make clear that Ms. Giffords, who was shot in the head, is still relearning basic tasks and might emerge from the hospital with neither the same political abilities nor aspirations that she had before.

She was born March 4, 1917 in Utica, daughter of the late Dr. Thomas Wood Clarke and Angela Clorinda Tracy. She graduated from Manhattanville College in 1938 and then enrolled in a Masters program in English at Oxford University. She studied there until the fall of 1939 when the outbreak of World War II forced her to return stateside. Once back in New York, she worked for US military intelligence on Governors Island until 1945. Toto continued to live in New York City for the next forty-plus years. After completing a Masters in English at Columbia University, she spent the next thirty years, working for New York Life Insurance Company, becoming the managing editor of the New York Life Review. She moved back to Utica in 1989. A poet, historian, and author, Toto had a great interest in the American Revolution. In the 1960s, she wrote two books, ""The American Revolution 1775-83"" and ""Young America Republic"", for British school children. McGraw-Hill later reprinted in hardcover her book on the Revolution. In lieu of flowers, donations may be made to the Sunset Wood Foundation, 118 Genesee St., New Hartford, NY 13413."
2011-03-31T00:00:00Z,"A Texas prosecutor's proposal that Willie Nelson sing his way out of a recent arrest for marijuana possession has all but gone up in smoke after a judge there rejected the idea. Kit Bramblett, the county attorney for Hudspeth County in West Texas, had suggested that Mr. Nelson pay a small fine and sing ''Blue Eyes Crying in the Rain'' at the courthouse as punishment after his arrest at a border stop in Sierra Blanca, Tex., on Nov. 26, when a Border Patrol agent smelled pot on his tour bus. Mr. Bramblett acknowledged that his suggested sentencing would still need to be approved by a judge. Unfortunately for Willie Nelson fans in Hudspeth County, Judge Becky Dean-Walker told The Associated Press that Mr. Nelson can plead guilty without going to court and giving an impromptu performance, adding that she believed Mr. Bramblett was making a joke ''and it got out of hand.'' For those who don't remember, ''Blue Eyes Crying in the Rain'' is track No. 5 on Mr. Nelson's 1975 album ''Red Headed Stranger.''"

2011-03-31T00:00:00Z,"Success came quickly for SolTec Electronics. The company, which Dawn Gluskin founded from her living room and financed with her savings and retirement accounts in 2008, sells hard-to-find electronic circuit board components, such as semi-conductors and integrated circuits to companies operating in the electronic manufacturing and aerospace industries. By 2009, SolTec had annual revenue of $700,000. In 2010, it moved into office space in Rockledge, Fla., hit $2.7 million in revenue, and secured a $150,000 line of credit. SolTec, according to Ms. Gluskin, helps clients when traditional distributor relationships break down. Given the rapid pace of technological advance, critical components in a supply chain can suddenly become obsolete. Many manufacturers also have trouble keeping up with demand, which can result in long lead times as they wait for parts. In addition, counterfeit parts have flooded the global market, which is why SolTec tests all components in its lab before sending them to customers."

He was the devoted grandfather of 11: Tom, Kate, Meg, Jack and Janie Lavin, Lily and Floy Salembier, Mason, Buckman, Keats and Daisy Sexton and beloved grandfather-in-law of Scott Phillips. He was a special friend of Miao Hua Zhou. He was lovingly cared for by Felicidad Collado, Astou Diop, Nur Purnamawaty and so many others. Mr. Hickey, born in Brooklyn, was a graduate of the University of Notre Dame class of 1942. He served in World War II as a lieutenant senior grade USN in the Pacific. He received the William D. Reynolds Award in 1992 from Notre Dame and was the Notre Dame Club of New York ""Man of the Year"" in 1993. He also received an Honorary Degree of Doctor of Humane Letters in 1995 from St. John's University. After retiring from his family's concrete business, M.F. Hickey Company, which was founded by his grandfather in 1896, Mr. Hickey spent the last three decades helping the mentally retarded and emotionally disturbed children of New York City. He served on the Board of the Kennedy Child Study Center for decades. Mr. Hickey was head of the Parish Council, Eucharistic Minister, lector, and altar server at Saint Vincent Ferrer Church. He was also a member of the board of Astor Services for Children for many years. During that time, he oversaw the purchase and renovation of a two-room, Victorian Gothic schoolhouse known as ""The Little Red Schoolhouse."" It was renamed in honor of him and is now called the Lawrence F. Hickey Center for Child Development, a therapeutic early childhood development program. In addition, Mr. Hickey was a past president of the Neighborhood Coalition for Shelter, The Amateur Comedy Club and The Jones Wood Association. He was chief Honorary Usher and a lector at St. Patrick's Cathedral, a Knight Equestrian of the Holy Sepulchre of Jerusalem and a Knight of Malta. The Daughters of Charity recognized him for his work at the Kennedy and Astor facilities by naming him an ""Affiliate"" of the Order in 1990. Mr. Hickey was a member of the Friends of Cardinal Cooke Guild and an early member of the Bishop Fulton J. Sheen Foundation promoting the case for sainthood. When asked why he spent his retirement years helping others, Mr. Hickey wrote: ""Lessons learned on the campus of Notre Dame, from my Irish Catholic background, and a tour of 49 months in the Navy in WWII, convinced me that we all must help God's less fortunate."" And in his final years, nothing made him happier than to be surrounded by his large and adoring circle of family and friends in his weekend home in Millerton, New York. The wake will be held at Frank E. Campbell, 1076 Madison Avenue at 81st Street on Thursday from 6 to 9pm. The Funeral Mass will be held at Saint Patrick's Cathedral at 10am, Friday.

His collection was looted, and some of the art ended up in the hands of the Nazi leader Hermann Goering, according to the Associated Press report. In a written statement released Monday, museum officials stated: ''Working in cooperation with representatives of the Goudstikker heirs, the Getty's research revealed that the painting was in Goudstikker's inventory at the time of the invasion in 1940, and that it was never restituted after World War II. Based on its findings, the Getty concluded that the painting should be transferred to the heirs.''"
2011-03-31T00:00:00Z,"BOLLON--Vincent J. Washington, D.C. Long-time labor leader and former New York City fire fighter and fire officer Vincent J. Bollon, 77, passed away March 28 at his home in Fairfax County, Virginia. Bollon served as General Secretary-Treasurer of the International Association of Fire Fighters from 1988 until 2010, making him the second-longest serving principal officer in the 92-year history of the IAFF. He retired in January 2010. Bollon joined the FDNY in 1959, fulfilling his ambition to be a New York City fire fighter. During his firefighting career he served as a fire fighter in the busiest fire station in the Bronx and as a fire officer in the busiest fire station in Harlem. He was awarded FDNY's Medal for Bravery, twice; and presented with meritorious medals for service on nine separate occasions. Bollon was an extraordinary union leader going back to his first election in 1975 as the Financial Recording Secretary for Uniformed Firefighters Association (UFA) Local 94. After his promotion to Lieutenant in 1977, he continued his union service to Uniformed Fire Officers Association (UFOA) Local 854 and was first elected to the Local 854 Executive Board in 1978 and served as the President of Local 854 for eight years. He was also first vice chairman of the largest fire fighter pension fund in the United States and Canada from 1980 to 1988. Most recently he was chairman of the NFPA Pension Fund and a trustee on the Fairfax County, Virginia, Uniformed Retirement System. While in New York City, Bollon was instrumental in enacting legislation for fire fighters throughout the State of New York, protecting their benefits and their occupational health and safety. In addition, he drafted and helped secure the passage of the New York State First Line Supervisors Law, which provides officer training at state expense for newly promoted first line supervisors in all New York State paid fire departments. He also served on the boards of directors for the National Fire Protection Association (NFPA), New York State Fire Safety Advisory Board, New York City Fire Museum and John Jay College. During Bollon's 21 years as the IAFF General Secretary-Treasurer he succeeded in implementing new programs, processes and tools to assist local union leadership with financial, membership and accounting issues. He worked diligently to grow union membership, not just in finances and numbers, but in influence within the North American labor movement. He leaves his wife, Linda; his children Janice and her husband Ron Roveto, Suzanne Bollon, Chrysee Bollon, and Kathleen and her husband Walter Scott; and his grandchildren Jennifer, Steven, Matthew, Nicholas, Caitlin, and Brianne. The wake will be held on Saturday, April 2nd and Sunday, April 3rd from 2:00 to 4:00 and from 7:00 to 9:00pm at the St. James Funeral Home - South Chapel, 829 Middle Country Road, Route 25, St. James, New York 11780; telephone: 631-584-7200.

Latakia is particularly interesting because the town and province are the heartland of the Alawites, a Shiite sect that produced the ruling Assad family and much of the current governing elite. (In the wake of the Ottoman collapse in the early 20th century, there was an on-again-off-again Alawite ""state"" based in and around Latakia until 1944, when it integrated with Syria.)"

William Somerville (think Jane Austen), it sits on 23 acres of landscaped and walled gardens, in a valley with a Constable-worthy view of the church spire in the village after which it is named. Like many large old English houses, Dinder House was converted to commercial use (in this case by a shoe company rather than, say, a hotel) in recent times, but in 2004 it was bought by Chris and Jo Mycock, the owners of a successful I.T. company.

2011-04-01T00:00:00Z,"HICKEY--Lawrence Francis, Lawrence Francis Hickey, 90, died peacefully at home in New York City. Cherished husband of the late Jean Hogan Hickey, his bride of 56 years, adored father of Elizabeth Hickey Lavin of Pelham Manor, NY, Frank Hickey, Magee Hickey Salembier and Jane Hickey Sexton, all of New York City, and beloved father-in-law of Tom Lavin, Rick Salembier and Mason Speed Sexton. He was the devoted grandfather of 11: Tom, Kate, Meg, Jack and Janie Lavin, Lily and Floy Salembier, Mason, Buckman, Keats and Daisy Sexton and beloved grandfather-in-law of Scott Phillips. He was a special friend of Miao Hua Zhou. He was lovingly cared for by Felicidad Collado, Astou Diop, Nur Purnamawaty and so many others. Mr. Hickey, born in Brooklyn, was a graduate of the University of Notre Dame class of 1942. He served in World War II as a lieutenant senior grade USN in the Pacific. He received the William D. Reynolds Award in 1992 from Notre Dame and was the Notre Dame Club of New York ""Man of the Year"" in 1993. He also received an Honorary Degree of Doctor of Humane Letters in 1995 from St. John's University. After retiring from his family's concrete business, M.F. Hickey Company, which was founded by his grandfather in 1896, Mr. Hickey spent the last three decades helping the mentally retarded and emotionally disturbed children of New York City. He served on the Board of the Kennedy Child Study Center for decades. Mr. Hickey was head of the Parish Council, Eucharistic Minister, lector, and altar server at Saint Vincent Ferrer Church. He was also a member of the board of Astor Services for Children for many years. During that time, he oversaw the purchase and renovation of a two-room, Victorian Gothic schoolhouse known as ""The Little Red Schoolhouse."" It was renamed in honor of him and is now called the Lawrence F. Hickey Center for Child Development, a therapeutic early childhood development program. In addition, Mr. Hickey was a past president of the Neighborhood Coalition for Shelter, The Amateur Comedy Club and The Jones Wood Association. He was chief Honorary Usher and a lector at St. Patrick's Cathedral, a Knight Equestrian of the Holy Sepulchre of Jerusalem and a Knight of Malta. The Daughters of Charity recognized him for his work at the Kennedy and Astor facilities by naming him an ""Affiliate"" of the Order in 1990. Mr. Hickey was a member of the Friends of Cardinal Cooke Guild and an early member of the Bishop Fulton J. Sheen Foundation promoting the case for sainthood. When asked why he spent his retirement years helping others, Mr. Hickey wrote: ""Lessons learned on the campus of Notre Dame, from my Irish Catholic background, and a tour of 49 months in the Navy in WWII, convinced me that we all must help God's less fortunate."" And in his final years, nothing made him happier than to be surrounded by his large and adoring circle of family and friends in his weekend home in Millerton, New York. The wake will be held at Frank E. Campbell, 1076 Madison Avenue at 81st Street on Thursday from 6 to 9pm. The Funeral Mass will be held at Saint Patrick's Cathedral at 10am, Friday. In lieu of flowers, donations can be made to the Lawrence F. Hickey Center for Child Development, 4010 Dyre Avenue, Bronx, NY 10466 or the Kennedy Child Study Center, 151 East 67th Street, New York, NY 10065."

Lanford was discovered in the 1960s at the beginning of the Off-Off and Off-Broadway movement by the legendary play agent Audrey Wood who recognized his unique ability to truthfully capture humanity in his writing which he displayed with love in all his characters. Lanford was one of the founding members of the famed Circle Repertory Company where many of his plays premiered and then quickly became staples of the American Theatre. From his short plays including the groundbreaking The Madness of Lady Bright, through Balm in Gillead and The Hot L Baltimore, and Talley's Folly and Burn This, we were always deeply moved by what Lanford wrote. Whether it's in a black box in Alphabet City, a university auditorium or a Broadway Theatre, Lanford will still be here with us. Dramatists Play Service, Inc. Stephen Sultan, President"

He is survived by his beloved wife of 68 years, Carol Ruth Shepherd, and their four children. Shep was proud of having grown up in Brooklyn. He received his Bachelor of Science degree from Cornell University and later served in the U.S. Army during World War II. He received Honorary Doctorate degrees from Villanova University and The George Washington University. He was internationally renowned for his pioneering work in aerosol technology, which resulted in pivotal breakthroughs in a variety of areas, most notably in the treatment of asthma. Shep was a close friend of Dr. Albert B. Sabin, the discoverer of the oral polio vaccine, whose lifelong work in the field of vaccines inspired Shep to found the Sabin Vaccine Institute, along with Dr. Sabin's widow, Heloisa Sabin. Dr. Shepherd served as Chairman of the Institute's Board of Trustees for over 15 years and as its President for eight years. He was passionately committed to the Institute's mission to reduce the needless suffering of the world's poorest one billion people from vaccine-preventable and neglected tropical diseases. Under his visionary leadership, the Institute is developing new vaccines, advocates for the use of existing vaccines and helps provide treatments to hundreds of millions of people around the globe. He will be sorely missed. We extend our heartfelt sympathies to Carol Ruth, his children John, Marjorie, Elizabeth and Benjamin, his extended family and many friends and admirers.

Higgins (Kurtwood Smith). Higgins thinks the new guy would be a perfect addition -- as a mole -- to the roster of unruly agents in the Clandestine Administration and Oversight Services. Otherwise known as Chaos, the division is assigned to handle threats to national security, the biggest of which seem to be its own bureaucratic gridlock and incompetence. But when the agents dig up dirt on Rick, he finds himself playing their game. Eric Close portrays Michael Dorset, a psychologist turned operative motivated by paranoia; James Murray is Billy Collins, a Scot who was decommissioned from the British Secret Service and banished; Tim Blake Nelson (above right, with Mr. Close, center, and Mr. Rodriguez) is Casey Malick, whose understated demeanor serves to camouflage his ability to transform into a ''human weapon''; and Christina Cole is Adele Ferrer, who seems to have Rick's best interests at heart.

On Wednesday night, reports surfaced that HBO had canceled its drama ''In Treatment,'' which has starred Gabriel Byrne as the psychotherapist Dr. Paul Weston, and featured a rotating roster of actors including Hope Davis, Debra Winger and Mia Wasikowska as his patients. Dianne Wiest and Amy Ryan also starred, as Dr. Weston's own therapists. And while a cigar is sometimes just a cigar, HBO seemed to suggest that this cancellation was not necessarily a cancellation. In a statement, the network said: ''It's true that we have no plans to continue with 'In Treatment' as previously formatted. However, we are in continued conversations with the executive producers to find another way to continue telling these rich stories.'' ''In Treatment,'' which is adapted from the Israeli series ''BeTipul,'' was broadcast on multiple nights of the week and focused on the story of a different patient on each night, so it was possible that HBO was somehow seeking to consolidate this format. But like a strict Freudian, the network declined to comment further."

As I noted, even a quick look at the actual facts shows that 1920-21 bears no resemblance to 2008-?, and instead looks like 1981-82: a recession was brought on by tight monetary policy aimed at limiting inflation, and was followed by a rapid recovery when monetary policy was relaxed."

With music and lyrics by Mr. Mellencamp, a book by Mr. King, and music direction by T Bone Burnett, ''Ghost Brothers'' had previously been announced for a 2009 production at the Alliance but was delayed for unspecified script problems.

Mr. Makine, a Franco-Russian author who was awarded the prestigious Prix Goncourt in 1995, was ''leading a literary double life,'' Le Figaro said. He kept the secret for more than 10 years; Osmonde never showed himself in public and even one of his publishers, Albin Michel, said he had never seen or spoken to him. A prolific author often compared to Chekhov and known for his limpid French prose, Mr. Makine has used the pen name since 2001 to write novels about the world's cruelty and the human quest for transcendence. The fourth, ''Alternaissance,'' was published in March. In France critics and publishers had speculated for years about the author's identity. Mr. Makine came clean about writing under the other name after a French scholar said publicly that excerpts from one Osmonde book had been inspired by ''Dreams of My Russian Summers.'' Explaining the need for a pen name, Mr. Makine told Le Figaro: ''I wanted to create someone who lived far from the hurly-burly of the world.''"

Billy Crudup is the husband Liz leaves before embarking on her journey of liberation; James Franco is the soulful young actor who makes it only too clear that she is drifting further and further from her intended course. And Mr. Bardem is Felipe, the Brazilian expatriate at the end of the road, after she has eaten her way through Italy, meditated in India and apprenticed herself to an elderly shaman (Hadi Subiyanto) in Bali. ''Will her feelings for Felipe cause her to abandon the self-sufficiency that had been the point of her quest?,'' A. O. Scott pondered in The New York Times. ''And because 'Eat Pray Love' builds its climax around this question, does that mean, in the end, that it reverts to the man-centric romantic-comedy formula? Yes and no.'' He added: '' 'Eat Pray Love' is unlikely to change anybody's life or even to provoke emotions anywhere near as intense as those experienced, early and late, by its intrepid heroine. Its span may be global, but its scope is modest, and it accepts a certain superficiality as the price of useful insight. Watch. Smile. Go home and dream of Brazilians in Bali.'' 10:30 A.M.

With epic vision and intellect, Mr. Taub promoted Jewish scholarship and maintained a passionate belief that we should leave the world a better place than we found it. He was immensely generous and philanthropic and will always be remembered for his kindness, compassion and commitment to making a difference. Founder of Automatic Data Processing (ADP), the leading provider of computerized payroll services in the U.S, Henry Taub was a founder and the first president of the JCC in its Tenafly location (1980-1984). During his presidency, he solidified the JCC as a focal point for Jewish life in our community. He instituted our system of contributory memberships which continue to support our Center, as well as a comprehensive committee structure that brought hundreds of volunteers and future leaders to our Center. Our Judaic-Scholar-in-Residence program and numerous cultural and athletic programs were also established during his presidency, bringing an influx of new families to the JCC. In their devotion to the arts and culture, Henry and his wife Marilyn (Mickey) dedicated the Taub Auditorium, which they recently refurbished as part of the JCC Gift of Community Campaign. In memory of Mickey's parents and their love of seniors and Yiddish music, the Taubs created the Esther and Julius Adler Semi-Annual Yiddish Concert Series, which is attended by more than 1,000 people each year.

Profoundly touched by the vulnerability of the Jewish community, he became a lifetime supporter of institutions and causes that espouse Jewish values. A pillar of the community, Mr. Taub provided extraordinary philanthropic support to the UJA Federation of Northern New Jersey (and its predecessors) for over 40 years. Among the many programs he created and funded was the Synagogue Leadership Initiative. He served as president of the Joint Distribution Committee and United Israel Appeal. Henry Taub was the first American to hold the position of chairman of the International Board of Governors of the Technion-Israel Institute of Technology. He also established the Henry and Marilyn Taub Foundation, which supports important charitable endeavors, including the Taub Institute for Research on Alzheimer Disease and the Aging Brain at NY-Presbyterian/Columbia Hospital and the Taub Urban Research Center at New York University. Henry Taub will be remembered for his extraordinary generosity and for inspiring a new generation of leaders. He possessed a rare gift of greatness and truly left the world a better place. We will remember him always for the indelible mark he left on all our lives. We extend our sincerest condolences to his wife Mickey; children Judy, Ron, Steven, Benay, Ira, Shelley, 10 grandchildren and his brother Joe. He was deeply loved and will be sorely missed. May his memory be for a blessing. Pearl Seiden, President; Avi A. Lewinson, Executive Director"

Last week, we reported that some taxpayers were facing delays in getting refund checks, due to computer snafus in processing their repayment of the 2008 first-time home buyer tax credit. (The credit was really a no-interest loan and has to be repaid over 15 years, beginning this year). Many of those filers, the Internal Revenue Service says, should begin getting their refunds in April. But Mr. Ryan, a 28-year old logistics manager near Des Moines, said that when he called the agency on March 11 to check on his refund, a representative said it would be another 145 days - or, sometime in the middle of the summer."

Vendors all seem to know their building's original function: a blacksmith shop, a Civil War hospital, tobacco storage. Developers in this town of about 75,000 have taken pains to preserve the historic feel of the downtown area, which, until a few years ago, was mired in decay. Now, loft apartments, art studios, restaurants and a tearoom fill the hulking warehouses and factories along the banks of the James River.

2011-04-03T00:00:00Z,"Someday someone will make a movie about the colorful life of Ford Wheeler. And when that day comes, pity the poor production designer. Wheeler, who is himself a production designer, has worked on projects as varied as ''Let Me In,'' last year's remake of a Swedish vampire film, and the intensely messy drama ''Rachel Getting Married.'' He also ran Craft Caravan, the now-closed but once wildly popular SoHo emporium for African design objects and art. He has lived in no fewer than 17 different houses and apartments in and around San Francisco, where he spent his 20s - including an authentic Victorian with a taxidermied elk in the dining room - and various New York City lofts. He has a country compound in the quaintly named upstate New York town of Dairyland, and he recently picked up a colonial house in Merida, Mexico. And that's just for the location scout to deal with. Then there is the stuff - the rolling pins, rulers, folk art, African statuary, religious icons, globes, clowns, cases of Pee cola from Ghana, obscure LP's, Kewpie dolls, Ford hubcaps, false eyelashes, hot-water bottles, knitted bottle covers in the shape of poodles. These things have a way of finding Wheeler, and he graciously makes a home for them. Or, in the case of the faux Wedgwood elephant-shaped cake topper from ''Rachel Getting Married'' that now sits on the sideboard in his loft, he finds or designs them for a movie and then can't let them go. ''That plant over there in the corner?'' he says, pointing to a night-blooming cereus in a ceramic pot. ''That was my mother's. She died when I was 20, and now I'm 65. I don't like to throw things out. It's very difficult for me.''"

His life was an extraordinary, inspirational journey from Brighton Beach, Brooklyn--where he met the love of his life, Rosalyn Breg Heller, on the elevated subway platform when they were both headed to the NYU Heights campus--to homes in Los Angeles, California; Livingston, New Jersey; Stamford, Connecticut; London, England; New York, New York; Highland Beach, Florida; and finally, Maplewood, New Jersey. The son of a jeweler who'd immigrated alone from Austria as a boy, and the grandson of a woman who peddled fish from a cart on the Lower East Side, he rose to become one of the first Jewish executives at a major American corporation and one of the first Jewish members of the University Club. As Senior Vice President, Western Hemisphere of PepsiCo International in the 1970s and later as President and Chief Executive Officer of PepsiCo Wines and Spirits, International through 1987, he helped introduce Pepsi to the USSR and Eastern Europe and first imported Stolichnaya Vodka in the west. He loved business, but was a cultured intellectual with passionate interests in the arts, especially. Ever positive, his favorite word was ""phenomenal,"" and he was, above all, phenomenally devoted to his wife of 62 years, his sister Judy Coleman, his three children, Karen Abada, Nanci McAlpin, and Matthew Heller, and their spouses, and his six grandchildren--all of whom adored and survive him.

He received the Purple Heart and other medals for distinguished service from the U.S. Government. 1949 Mr. Assael began trading in left over U.S. Army watches with Japan. He was paid in pearls, which is how he started the pearl business. In 1972 he took over the business from his family, and founded Assael International.

2011-04-03T00:00:00Z,"Anyone lucky enough to be invited to Camp Topridge, the cereal heiress Marjorie Merriweather Post's 207-acre Adirondack camp, was greeted - upon arrival by water on her private launch - by an elaborate two-story, five-bay boathouse. Built in the 1920s with natural cedar logs with bark cut directly from local woods, it was decorated with a profusion of intricate twigs and branches. Later, a second boathouse was added. Like other boathouses along the Adirondacks' 11,000 lakes and ponds, Post's was the front door to a glamorous vacation getaway. Boathouses were often the only visible part of a camp, with the main house and guest cottages hidden from view among the trees. A mix of opulence and rustic whimsy, they were also a necessity when roads were scarce, making boats the sole means of reaching the camps (even if, like Post, you could afford to fly in on a float plane). The buildings' second floors served as massive playrooms where guests could sip drinks while their children swam and fished. Some boathouses were even grander than their camp's main house."

(Showtime) THE BORGIASJeremy Irons, above, who had a recurring gig on American television recently in ''Law & Order: Special Victims Unit,'' camps it up as Rodrigo Borgia, the ruthless chief of the corrupt Italian clan, in this new series filmed by Neil Jordan (''The Crying Game''). The story begins in 1492 with the death of Pope Innocent VIII and ''lavishly depicts how Rodrigo used bribery, poison and other tricks (scrolls carrying offers of bribes stuffed into the snouts of suckling pigs) to become Pope Alexander VI,'' Alessandra Stanley wrote in The New York Times. But although a cynical, black-hearted pope, Rodrigo was a doting father, naming his son Cesare (François Arnaud) a cardinal; assigning another, Juan (David Oakes), to lead the papal army; and putting his daughter Lucrezia (Holliday Grainger) to work, through strategic marriages.

2011-04-03T00:00:00Z,"The silent star of the 1948 hit film ''Mr. Blandings Builds His Dream House'' is a handsome Colonial with bright clapboard walls and dark shutters. Cary Grant and Myrna Loy co-starred as the New York City adman Jim Blandings and his wife, Muriel - up-to-date apartment dwellers whose relationship with early-American style personified the hopes and struggles of moviegoers from coast to coast. The Blandings' country home became so popular that Kellogg's cereal boxes offered a cardboard cutout model, and Manhattan charity fund-raisers oversaw the construction of a full-scale Dream House knockoff on a vacant lot in Midtown. As the backdrop for a 1949 fashion photo in Cosmopolitan magazine, the suburban colonial parked at the corner of 48th and Fifth now seems quaintly surreal, but at the time it was shot, this ''back to the New Look'' tableau would have made perfect sense to passers-by. Colonial-inspired design loomed surprisingly large on Gotham's aesthetic skyline from the 1920s until the aftermath of World War II, a prominence ignored by conventional histories that rate Art Deco and Modernism as the era's only shows in town. Such scenarios routinely cast Colonial Revival architects and other traditionalists as doddering throwbacks to effete ideas. A more evenhanded appraisal of the latter camp - and its active engagement in contemporary social and cultural issues - informs ''The American Style: Colonial Revival and the Modern Metropolis,'' an exhibition at the Museum of the City of New York (June 14 to October 30). The museum's own home, a 1932 redbrick Colonial Revival landmark, rightly figures as a prime artifact. ''A lot of people look at Colonial Revival as kind of a joke, as if it were all spinning-wheel chairs,'' says Donald Albrecht, who curated the show with Thomas Mellins. ''We're saying it is a style of high quality with its own masters - and it's the ur-example of architecture and design as a narrative art.''"

During his presidency, he solidified the JCC as a focal point for Jewish life in our community. He instituted our system of contributory memberships which continue to support our Center, as well as a comprehensive committee structure that brought hundreds of volunteers and future leaders to our Center. Our Judaic-Scholar-in-Residence program and numerous cultural and athletic programs were also established during his presidency, bringing an influx of new families to the JCC. In their devotion to the arts and culture, Henry and his wife Marilyn (Mickey) dedicated the Taub Auditorium, which they recently refurbished as part of the JCC Gift of Community Campaign. In memory of Mickey's parents and their love of seniors and Yiddish music, the Taubs created the Esther and Julius Adler Semi-Annual Yiddish Concert Series, which is attended by more than 1,000 people each year. Growing up in Paterson, Henry and his family lived among hundreds of Holocaust survivors. Profoundly touched by the vulnerability of the Jewish community, he became a lifetime supporter of institutions and causes that espouse Jewish values. A pillar of the community, Mr. Taub provided extraordinary philanthropic support to the UJA Federation of Northern New Jersey (and its predecessors) for over 40 years. Among the many programs he created and funded was the Synagogue Leadership Initiative. He served as president of the Joint Distribution Committee and United Israel Appeal. Henry Taub was the first American to hold the position of chairman of the International Board of Governors of the Technion-Israel Institute of Technology. He also established the Henry and Marilyn Taub Foundation, which supports important charitable endeavors, including the Taub Institute for Research on Alzheimer Disease and the Aging Brain at NY-Presbyterian/Columbia Hospital and the Taub Urban Research Center at New York University. Henry Taub will be remembered for his extraordinary generosity and for inspiring a new generation of leaders. He possessed a rare gift of greatness and truly left the world a better place. We will remember him always for the indelible mark he left on all our lives. We extend our sincerest condolences to his wife Mickey; children Judy, Ron, Steven, Benay, Ira, Shelley, 10 grandchildren and his brother Joe. He was deeply loved and will be sorely missed. May his memory be for a blessing. Pearl Seiden, President; Avi A. Lewinson, Executive Director"

2011-04-03T00:00:00Z,"WILLIAM D. COHAN There is the crowing about AT&T's $39 billion proposed acquisition of Deutsche Telekom's wireless business -- one of the largest acquisitions in years. Is this what Washington was hoping would happen when it chose to recapitalize the banks in October 2008 with taxpayer money? That they would be helping the giants arrange even bigger deals, reducing competition and -- likely -- existing jobs? Which brings us to the still-absurd level of Wall Street compensation. Bonus payments in 2010 hovered close to $150 billion. There are even reports that the war for talent has resumed, with the return of multiyear, multimillion dollar contracts. And yet, there has not even been a baby step toward holding Wall Street's top executives fully accountable for their actions -- by asking them to once again put their entire net worth on the line as they did in days of yore. Another lost opportunity."

2011-04-03T00:00:00Z,"Perhaps no aspect of baseball has received more statistical scrutiny over the last decade than pitchers' control over the outcomes of balls in play. Ever since a paralegal named Voros McCracken posted a theory on the Internet in 1999 that pitchers could exert influence only on their strikeouts, walks and home runs allowed - leaving everything else up to fielders and luck - researchers have pored over a century's worth of data on batting averages on balls in play. It turns out that McCracken and his detractors were partly right: although some pitchers are in fact more hittable than others, figuring out which ones they are while they are active is exceedingly hard. Far less attention has been paid, however, to the other side of the balls-in-play coin: offense. Clearly, hitters control their averages on balls in play far more than pitchers do. A hard-to-hit pitcher like Barry Zito and an easy one like Carlos Silva are separated by about 40 points of career average on balls in play. For batters, the gap is twice as large. Pedro Feliz and Alex Cora have hit .268 and .269 on balls in play, and Derek Jeter and Ichiro Suzuki are at .358 and .359."

Kameon, who lives and works in Los Angeles, has been a painter, a retailer, a stylist-costumer and (for two weeks) the proprietor of an underground restaurant. Today she's a garden designer who has created domestic landscapes for clients like Sofia Coppola, Mike D of the Beastie Boys and the hotelier Sean MacPherson, and public ones for the fashion houses Marc Jacobs and Balenciaga as well as the Parker Palm Springs hotel. In addition to her design firm, Elysian Landscapes, she owns Plain Air - a company that makes Modernist-influenced outdoor furniture - with her husband, Erik Otsea, a photographer. All these lives inform her current one, in which she is a combination designer/artist/plant geek/avid cook/hostess/mother hen who is happy to describe the properties of a particular variety of cactus in her garden while she offers a plate of freshly baked scones or negotiates a play date for her 5-year-old son. For Kameon, it all grows together. By her own description, Kameon's garden, on a narrow street in Elysian Park, near downtown L.A., has been her laboratory for 20 years. From the street, which is lined with modest houses, you open a tall wooden gate, and suddenly you're in an enchanted backyard. By terracing the hillside, Kameon created outdoor living spaces, like an al fresco dining area under a huge California pepper tree, a comfortable patio behind the house and an egg-shaped swimming pool that is surrounded by greenery. And almost all of it - except for the very old pepper tree - is Kameon's invention."

''It's not like the Farnsworth House, which was a weekend getaway, or the Glass House, which is purely an architect's personal expression of his ideas,'' says Bradley Brooks, the museum's director of historic resources. ''It had to accommodate entertaining and employees and five kids, and yet it was still resolved so beautifully. This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print."

Ruth spent most of her life in the Bronx and Manhattan, where she was involved in the human rights struggles of both the Black and Jewish communities. During WWII, she was a draftsman in ship building. Drafting led her to the Port Authority of NY & NJ, where she also worked in the Model Cities Program, as well as the Audio Visual and Public Relation Departments in the World Trade Center. While working she obtained her masters at Empire State College, where she also served as President, Executive member and was a founder of the Alumni/Student Association.

2011-04-03T00:00:00Z,"In certain cultures, voodoo objects were commissioned to solve anything that vexed you - from failed crops to failed romance. Approximately 100 such tools of divine intervention are at hand this month when the Fondation Cartier in Paris presents ''Voodoo'' (April 5 to Sept. 25), an exhibition culled mostly from the collection of Jacques Kerchache, a legendary curator and champion of primitive art. The show's focus is on the Republic of Benin, where voodoo orginated, and the objects can be mind-boggling in their dense, everything-but-the-kitchen-sink assemblage. But according to the exhibition's co-curator, Leanne Sacramone, we can now only imagine the circumstances of their creation. The figure above, made of wood, rope, animal bones, terra cotta pots, plants, feathers, cotton threads, shells, cloth, hair, beads and chain, might have done wonders for a fashion designer in need of inspiration.

A giant in our organization and in the international Jewish community, Mr. Taub held the most influential offices and was recognized with the highest ATS and Technion honors during his decades of dedicated leadership and inspiring support. He served as ATS national president from 1974 to 1976, and chair of the Technion International Board of Governors from 1990 to 2003. He gave inspiring leadership during a time of dramatic expansion and scientific advancement at the university.

Mr. Taub and his wife, Marilyn, have spearheaded numerous projects including the Henry and Marilyn Taub and Family Science and Technology Center, a Technion campus landmark and home to its Faculty of Computer Science, considered one of the best in the world; the Leaders in Science and Technology Faculty Recruitment Program; and the Henry and Marilyn Taub Fund for the Future. Mr. Taub was awarded the Technion Medal, a Technion honorary doctorate, and a Technion honorary fellowship. A special ATS celebration in 2004 at the Plaza Hotel in New York City was held in tribute to Mr. Taub's lifetime of brilliant and dedicated service. A legendary business leader, Mr. Taub founded Automatic Data Processing (ADP), a global provider of integrated computing and business outsourcing. He served as president and chief executive officer and subsequently chairman of the board for many years.

2011-04-03T00:00:00Z,"A few months ago, Pilar Viladas, our brilliant design editor, came to an editorial meeting with a clutch of pictures of a Georgian manor house in Somerset, England, that the interiors whiz Ilse Crawford had recently reworked for a young family. The project was spectacular in its grand but subtle blending of the minimal and the baroque: the ballroom turned family kitchen was particularly envy-making to a staff of square-foot-challenged New Yorkers. But two images really grabbed our attention: one was of a small child reaching up to open a one-off marquetry cabinet, and the other was of a glorious mess of a playroom. The latter -- the former basement kitchen at Dinder House -- was immediately deemed our cover. What we saw in that room was imagination, spontaneity, persistence (all those open-ended projects) and heart. We saw, in essence, the underpinnings of great design. (There's plenty more to see in ''Family Style,'' Page 74.) It would be extraordinary to see the rooms Ford Wheeler played in when he was growing up in Southern California in his parents' Modernist house. The production designer and downtown New York legend, profiled on Page 86 by Alix Browne, is one of those rare collectors of vernacular and artisanal everything who actually understands how to create a seamless and emotionally compelling backdrop from amassed ephemera. It's hardly surprising that his collaborations with Jonathan Demme (most recently ''Rachel Getting Married'') are memorable for their characters and not their ceramics. His three homes are a moving tribute to a life well lived and well loved."

2011-04-03T00:00:00Z,"IN the bungling and bellicosity that constitute the back and forth of history, worsened by natural disasters and unprovoked cruelty, humble citizens pay the highest price. To be a traveler in such circumstances can be inconvenient at best, fatal at worst. But if the traveler manages to breeze past such unpleasantness on tiny feet, he or she is able to return home to report: ''I was there. I saw it all.'' The traveler's boast, sometimes couched as a complaint, is that of having been an eyewitness, and invariably this experience -- shocking though it may seem at the time -- is an enrichment, even a blessing, one of the life-altering trophies of the road. ''Don't go there,'' the know-it-all, stay-at-home finger wagger says of many a distant place. I have heard it my whole traveling life, and in almost every case it was bad advice. In my experience these maligned countries are often the most fulfilling. I am not saying they are fun. For undiluted jollification you bake in the sun at Waikiki with a mai tai in your fist, or eat lotuses on the Côte d'Azur. As for the recognition of hard travel as rewarding, the feeling is mainly retrospective, since it is only in looking back that we see how we have been enriched. At the time, of course, the experience of being a bystander to sudden political or social change can be alarming."

Or so it used to be until the appearance of Bergdorf Goodman's spring shoe catalog. From the first item on, which is a crazy-quilt of a Dries Van Noten sandal that rings in at $920, it is clear that one should beware all enterprises requiring new shoes. Which is not to say that there isn't the occasional bargain, like a Manolo Blahnik ballet flat for $665 (!). But if you're looking for the kind of footwear that will knock somebody's socks off (i.e., Azzedine Alaïa's bootie, above), the new normal hovers around $2,000. And then there's Alexander McQueen's gold T-strap wedge, set on a 5 1/2-inch heel, which calls for an outlay of $3,495. If you think too hard about any of this, it can make you weep. DAPHNE MERKIN"

They married on April 24, 1988 at the Regency Hotel in New York City. They honeymooned in Germany at the Bayreuth Festspiel where they saw the complete Ring Cycle by Wagner. Some of their happiest times were the summer festivals in Weikersheim where they were able to conduct operas on opposite nights, watching each other's conducting of La Traviata, Carmen, and La Boheme in the summers of 2001, 2003, and 2005. On holidays, Yakov enjoyed swimming and boogie boarding with his two boys, and taking long walks along the beach with his wife. He had many friends to whom he was very faithful to, especially ones he met when he first arrived in New York City 35 years ago. Yakov loved Woody Allen movies, Haagen Dazs coffee ice cream, telling jokes, and spending time with dear friends and family. Condolences can be shared through: yakovkreizberg.com"

2011-04-03T00:00:00Z,"I'm pretty sure you don't know what ''head and tail bands'' are. I didn't, anyway: I had never heard the term before, and if I'd ever seen one, I hadn't noticed it. They're the tiny strips of cloth that lie at the top and bottom of a book, between the back of the paper and the spine. They were originally meant to cover up imperfectly hand-cut pages, but now that commercial bookbinding is done by machine, they've become mostly decorative, and most books don't have them anymore. You may be wondering how I learned this; you're almost certainly wondering why it matters. I know it because Gerhard Steidl explained it to me, at great speed and considerable length, pulling down books of sample head and tail bands from a shelf above his desk, pointing out who makes the best ones, what colors they come in, how much they cost, why they are seldom used and why he uses them. And it matters because it's Steidl's attention to details like these - the look of a spine, the smell of ink, the way different kinds of papers feel on one's fingertips - that makes him one of the world's great publishers."
2011-04-03T00:00:00Z,"Let's face it - as trendy as taxidermy has become, it can also be a little creepy. Enter Anna-Wili Highfield (above), a Sydney, Australia-based artist whose hand-painted paper bird and horse sculptures are a perfect vegan alternative to the formaldehyde-filled, flea-bitten critters inhabiting hip hotels, restaurants and bars. Formerly a scenic painter at Opera Australia, the 30-year-old Highfield made her first ''fairy wren'' in 2008. Since then, she has created scores of avian and equine wonders out of thick cotton paper and copper or brass wire. Highfield doesn't have a gallery, but thanks to a few mentions in design magazines down under, there's a sizable waiting list for her work. Hermes recently commissioned two large Pegasus sculptures for its store in Brisbane, but despite this haute horsy endorsement, the artist's favorite winged muses aren't of the hooved variety. ''Raptors fascinate me,'' she says. ''Hawks, eagles, owls - they have an intensity that I try to capture in my pieces. I like to think they look alive.'' Go to annawilihighfield.com.

2011-04-03T00:00:00Z,"ABRAMOWITZ--Mildred W. Mildred W. Abramowitz, Ph.D., former New York City secondary school principal, attorney, and expert on Eleanor Roosevelt, died at age 94 on March 29th. Mildred was 15 when she first heard Eleanor Roosevelt speak, and many years later, in 1970, Mildred received a Ph.D. from NYU, writing her doctoral thesis on Eleanor Roosevelt. Mildred counted as her blessings giving birth to twins Margaret and Anne (Penny) Sablove, passing the New York City principal's exam, having two long marriages, first to Leo Sablove and then to Mortimer Abramowitz, former Great Neck superintendent of schools, becoming an attorney in her 60s, and being a grandmother to Margaret's children, William and Oliver Sablove. Mildred's life was enriched by deep and enduring friendships with Pearl Myers, Claudia Macari, and four of her high school students in the class of 1949 Joe Intile, Joan Kosan, Roy Solaski, and Emeline Angevine. Born four years before women got the vote, at the age of 91 Mildred cast her vote for Hillary Clinton in the California 2008 primary election. Mildred said that her one regret was, ""not living long enough to see a woman become president of the United States."" Donations can be made to the Eleanor Roosevelt Papers Project at George Washington University."

2011-04-03T00:00:00Z,"When Jonathan Ive, Apple's senior vice president of industrial design, was a boy, a Braun juicer designed by Dieter Rams (above) made a big impression: ''At a glance, you knew exactly what it was and exactly how to use it.'' So it's fitting that Ive, whose own work reflects the German master's principles, wrote the introduction to ''As Little Design as Possible: The Work of Dieter Rams,'' to be published by Phaidon in June. Written by Sophie Lovell and Klaus Kemp, the book examines Rams's ''less but better'' philosophy, as illustrated by the hundreds of products (like the coffee grinder shown here) that he produced for Braun, as well as by the iconic 606 shelving system for Vitsoe, still in production after 50 years. On May 2, the Vitsoe shop at 33 Bond Street will open an exhibition of early 606 pieces, while Braun is producing watches - including the one shown here - inspired by models that Rams and Dietrich Lubs designed in the 1970s.

2011-04-03T00:00:00Z,"Precocious and self-possessed, Charlotte Perriand was a girl among men, admitted to the ranks of the architects whose names would become synonymous with the new century, at an age when her outlook on design and the world was still in formation. In what would prove to be one of Modernism's signal images, she reclines in the chaise longue she designed in collaboration with Le Corbusier and his cousin Pierre Jeanneret. It was, in Le Corbusier's utopian terms, a ''machine for resting in,'' and as if to remind us that it's the chair, not the woman, being presented for our consideration, her face is turned away; she is at once familiar and unrecognizable. That the design of their now-famous furniture was for many years attributed to Le Corbusier alone, that most of her architectural projects never made it past the drawing board, that her far-ranging commissions defied easy classification, that her most significant projects are either gone or off the beaten path: all this only contributed to the enigma. Now, 12 years after her death, at 96, ''Charlotte Perriand: Photography: A Wide-Angle Eye,'' by Jacques Barsac (5 Continents Editions), offers an intimate glimpse of the woman and the workings of her mind. Perriand would have been the first to admit that she wasn't a photographer, and Barsac and the essayists who weigh in here stop short of calling her one. She was, however, convinced that photography and cinema were the forms best suited to capturing the spirit of the new age, and in her hands the camera became an extension of her eye and brain. Taking pictures, she could think without words, as looking turned into seeing and objects viewed from uncommon angles revealed themselves. There is, as Barsac notes, ''an almost primitive dimension . . . a sense of wonderment'' that runs throughout her photos. Every scene, every object is made new, seen with ''the fresh eye of a child who discovers the world with innocence and imagination.''"

2011-04-03T00:00:00Z,"Dinder House, a historic Georgian building in Somerset, England, is like a child's drawing of a house: three stories high, with floor-to-ceiling windows and a slate roof. Completed in 1801 for the Rev. William Somerville (think Jane Austen), it sits on 23 acres of landscaped and walled gardens, in a valley with a Constable-worthy view of the church spire in the village after which it is named. Like many large old English houses, Dinder House was converted to commercial use (in this case by a shoe company rather than, say, a hotel) in recent times, but in 2004 it was bought by Chris and Jo Mycock, the owners of a successful I.T. company. Four years (and five architects) later, they finally moved in, once the soul of the building had been restored - as a family house, for a modern family - by the London designer Ilse Crawford. When the Mycocks, who are from Lancashire, in the north of England, decided that they wanted a big house for themselves and their four small sons, they also decided that it should be Georgian. ''They make the best family houses,'' Chris explained. ''The rooms are the right size. They are full of light. The proportions work.''

2011-04-03T00:00:00Z,"HICKEY--Lawrence Francis, Lawrence Francis Hickey, 90, died peacefully at home in New York City. Cherished husband of the late Jean Hogan Hickey, his bride of 56 years, adored father of Elizabeth Hickey Lavin of Pelham Manor, NY, Frank Hickey, Magee Hickey Salembier and Jane Hickey Sexton, all of New York City, and beloved father-in-law of Tom Lavin, Rick Salembier and Mason Speed Sexton. He was the devoted grandfather of 11: Tom, Kate, Meg, Jack and Janie Lavin, Lily and Floy Salembier, Mason, Buckman, Keats and Daisy Sexton and beloved grandfather-in-law of Scott Phillips. He was a special friend of Miao Hua Zhou. He was lovingly cared for by Felicidad Collado, Astou Diop, Nur Purnamawaty and so many others. Mr. Hickey, born in Brooklyn, was a graduate of the University of Notre Dame class of 1942. He served in World War II as a lieutenant senior grade USN in the Pacific. He received the William D. Reynolds Award in 1992 from Notre Dame and was the Notre Dame Club of New York ""Man of the Year"" in 1993. He also received an Honorary Degree of Doctor of Humane Letters in 1995 from St. John's University. After retiring from his family's concrete business, M.F. Hickey Company, which was founded by his grandfather in 1896, Mr. Hickey spent the last three decades helping the mentally retarded and emotionally disturbed children of New York City. He served on the Board of the Kennedy Child Study Center for decades. Mr. Hickey was head of the Parish Council, Eucharistic Minister, lector, and altar server at Saint Vincent Ferrer Church. He was also a member of the board of Astor Services for Children for many years. During that time, he oversaw the purchase and renovation of a two-room, Victorian Gothic schoolhouse known as ""The Little Red Schoolhouse."" It was renamed in honor of him and is now called the Lawrence F. Hickey Center for Child Development, a therapeutic early childhood development program. In addition, Mr. Hickey was a past president of the Neighborhood Coalition for Shelter, The Amateur Comedy Club and The Jones Wood Association. He was chief Honorary Usher and a lector at St. Patrick's Cathedral, a Knight Equestrian of the Holy Sepulchre of Jerusalem and a Knight of Malta. The Daughters of Charity recognized him for his work at the Kennedy and Astor facilities by naming him an ""Affiliate"" of the Order in 1990. Mr. Hickey was a member of the Friends of Cardinal Cooke Guild and an early member of the Bishop Fulton J. Sheen Foundation promoting the case for sainthood. When asked why he spent his retirement years helping others, Mr. Hickey wrote: ""Lessons learned on the campus of Notre Dame, from my Irish Catholic background, and a tour of 49 months in the Navy in WWII, convinced me that we all must help God's less fortunate."" And in his final years, nothing made him happier than to be surrounded by his large and adoring circle of family and friends in his weekend home in Millerton, New York. The wake will be held at Frank E. Campbell, 1076 Madison Avenue at 81st Street on Thursday from 6 to 9pm. The Funeral Mass will be held at Saint Patrick's Cathedral at 10am, Friday. In lieu of flowers, donations can be made to the Lawrence F.

James’s piece begins by noting that the population of a city like Topeka, Kan., is roughly similar to the population of London in the age of Shakespeare, and then suggests the absence of a Topekan Shakespeare is evidence that Elizabethan England was better at cultivating men of letters than contemporary America — whereas we’re better at cultivating professional athletes:"

Cumbia often trots calmly, but Chico Trujillo's version gallops, bounding along; now and then, the music switches into rumba, equally upbeat. Mr. Asenjo sings lyrics as chattery and percussive as some hip-hop, taking on the ups and downs of love and life, with his voice answered by chortling horns -- did he borrow the arranging idea from ska bands? -- and a tootling, circusy organ. Syncopation, momentum and a way of romping through pain -- a party band needs them all, and Chico Trujillo has them."

It is not clear whether Colonel Qaddafi agrees with the plan, and some observers wonder whether there is a power struggle going on inside the family.

2011-04-04T00:00:00Z,"5:50 P.M. (Showtime) THE GHOST WRITER (2010) In this moody tale from Roman Polanski, Ewan McGregor, above, is ''at his ingénue best,'' Manohla Dargis wrote in The New York Times, portraying a scribe for hire. His job is to clean up the unfinished memoir of Adam Lang, a former British prime minister played by ''a superb Pierce Brosnan,'' after the previous writer has washed up on an American beach. Olivia Williams is Lang's wife, a brainy beauty with secrets whose marital relationship is meant to invoke that of Cherie Booth and Tony Blair. ''The parallels with Mr. Blair and Lang spice up the story, especially as references to Iraq, torture and the Central Intelligence Agency are folded into the mix, and placard-waving protesters gather outside Lang's hideaway,'' Ms. Dargis wrote. ''Fingers are pointed, though sometimes it seems not only at Lang but also at Mr. Polanski,'' who at the time of the film's release was under house arrest in Switzerland waiting to see if he would be extradited to Los Angeles to face sentencing for his 1977 sex crime. Mr. Polanski delivers ''this pulpy fun at such a high level that 'The Ghost Writer' is irresistible, no matter how obvious the twists,'' Ms. Dargis added. ''The pleasures of a well-directed movie should never be underestimated.'' 8 P.M.

2011-04-05T13:57:06Z,"The shoegazer singer Tamaryn, who started a North American tour with the Raveonettes last week, has learned a thing or two about stage makeup. “I don’t always use primer on my eyes, and I never wear powder — I like everything to be a little dewy and sexual looking,” said the singer during a pretour shopping spree in SoHo. (Stops included M.A.C. and Sephora.) She recently discovered Super, Dr. Nicolas Perricone’s new collection, at its flagship in Berkeley, Calif. — the band is based in San Francisco — and swears by the First Blush Brightening Serum: “I’ve been using it over makeup to set it and have a bit of a glow.” Other must-haves include Osis Mattifying Powder (“I sprinkle it in my hair and it looks teased”), Stila Kajal Eye Pencil in black (“looks better the next day”), Frederic Malle Une Rose (“androgynous but romantic — plus the traditional Goth girl scent is rose water”) and Tom Ford Bruised Plum Lip Color (“it’s like neu-Goth, because it’s sheer”). But the singer is always looking to evolve with her look: “I really want to start wearing brown lipstick. I’ve been watching a lot of ‘My So-Called Life’ lately, and they all have that brown lipstick! I think the ’90s are what it’s all about right now.”"

Now Ms. Bush has received the long-awaited permission to use the text, and she has rerecorded the song, which she renamed “Flower of the Mountain,” according to BBC News. Ms. Bush said she was “delighted” to have the chance “to fulfill the original concept.” The new track will be released in May on “Director’s Cut,” her first new album in six years."

Ryan,  Republican from Wisconsin, released a dramatic new deficit-reduction proposal Tuesday, one that would slash $5.8 trillion from spending levels over the next decade. Among the more controversial highlights is a cap on Medicare and Medicaid spending, by giving individual Medicare recipients vouchers of a certain amount, and block grants to states for Medicaid. The pundit consensus seems to be that Mr. Ryan's plan will be the framework for thinking about how to resolve budget issues -- in David Brooks's words, ""the standard of seriousness for anybody who wants to play in this discussion."""

There's plenty in the plan for liberals to hate, moderates to doubt, and conservatives to question. But you do have to respect it. As my colleague David Brooks writes today, it is ""the most comprehensive and most courageous budget reform proposal any of us have seen in our lifetimes."" It puts flesh on the bones of the standard-issue conservative pledge to limit government's growth, and it does so not with evasive pledges on process (like the risible idea of a balanced budget amendment) or dishonest suggestions that the deficit can be erased by defunding N.P.R. and slashing foreign aid, but by attacking entitlement spending deeply and directly. George W. Bush touched the third rail of American politics with his Social Security gambit, and lived to regret it. With their proposal to transform Medicare from an open-ended entitlement to a system that provides support for seniors' premiums, Ryan and the Republicans are reaching out and grabbing it with both hands. In the process, they are being brutally honest with the American people, in ways that the Obama White House has repeatedly refused to be, about the scale of the deficit challenge and the scope of the reforms needed to address it."

Roosevelt Mid-Hudson Bridge near Poughkeepsie, N.Y., said he recently received approval from the Eiffel Tower Operating Company (the Société d’Exploitation de la Tour Eiffel) to record samples from the tower. The samples would then be assembled into a piece of music, with the ultimate goal of performing it live on the tower itself. Mr. Bertolozzi traveled to Paris in the fall to present his project, and he received a letter of approval last month. The tower operating company said it was open to the idea of a live concert but was making no promises. Now, Mr. Bertolozzi said, all he has to do is raise the money. He said his aim was to have performances in 2014, the tower’s 125th anniversary."

2011-04-05T10:00:17Z,"The current fads for artisanal liquor, louche bars and everything ‘‘Mad Men’’ must have inspired ‘‘Cocktail Culture: Ritual and Invention in American Fashion, 1920-1980,’’ an exhibition that opens Friday (and continues through July) at the Museum of Art at the Rhode Island School of Design. It features more than 220 artifacts, including a Dansk ice bucket, a Norman Bel Geddes soda siphon, Paco Rabanne purses and lots of little black dresses (as well as the red one shown below, by Norman Norell). The show begins in the 1920s, when American cocktail culture was mostly confined to the home, and the French, with their beaded cocktail dresses and René Lalique Art Deco glass, set the standard for a night on the town. But the most durable pieces, the ones that you’d still want to break out for guests today, date from the 1950s, when every hour was happy hour and cocktail design was strained through a Modernist sieve. Consider Donald Colflesh’s 1959 silver-plated pitcher for Gorham (below), whose sleek form seems to respond only to one request, essential and elegant: martini, straight up."

And we’ll have endless obfuscation, both-sides-have-a-point reporting that misses the key point, which is that the putative savings come entirely from benefit cuts somewhere in the distant future that would, in all likelihood, never actually materialize.

But it was a bright start for the cable network: AMC said on Monday that ''The Killing'' was watched by 2.7 million total viewers for its two-hour debut, making it the network's second-most-watched premiere for an original series, behind its horror drama ''The Walking Dead,'' which was consumed by 5.3 million viewers when it started in October. That's good news for ''The Killing,'' adapted from the Danish series ''Forbrydelsen,'' and for the network, given that AMC has some time to fill before rolling out its next batch of original programming: a fourth season of ''Breaking Bad'' isn't due until the summer, while a second season of ''The Walking Dead'' and a new series, ''Hell on Wheels,'' are likely to arrive in the fall. And a fifth cycle of ''Mad Men'' -- lest we remind you -- isn't coming until next year."

The owners have donated three roomfuls of the scenery, painted by the muralist Rufus Porter's nephew Jonathan Poor, along with underlying layers of plaster and lath, fireplace mantels and an entire staircase. The museum is raising $60,000 for the dismantling work, by the salvager David Ottinger, and is renovating an 1830s house that will accommodate the acquisition. Poor died in his early 40s, soon after completing the work for a local physician, perhaps because mural painting was a hazardous profession.

''Detachment,'' a new feature from Tony Kaye, the director of ''American History X,'' will make its debut as part of the festival's narrative program.

2011-04-05T00:00:00Z,"GRIEVE--Marvin M. Died on April 2 at his home in Calverton, NY at age 89. Born in New York City on July 22, 1921, Marvin spent his early years in Brooklyn and Manhattan. He joined the Army Air Corps in 1942, serving as a B-26 pilot in North Africa and Italy. He flew 60 bombing missions and was shot down twice, emerging without a scratch. After the war he lived in Paris for a year and then worked in his father's picture framing and antiques business, before starting his career in television program syndication in the early 1950's. In 1969 Marvin founded MG films, focusing on children's programming, and in 1980 he partnered with Richard Perin forming MG/Perin, producing and distributing syndicated TV programs. After his retirement he took great pride in helping build homes on the east end of Long Island with Habitat for Humanity. Marvin loved life and lived his to the fullest. Predeceased by his sister Marjorie, Marvin is survived by his beloved wife of 35 years, Holly. He will be fondly remembered by his sister-in-law Valorie Dawson, and by the many friends of all ages whose lives he touched. A private memorial service will take place in the near future."

2011-04-05T00:00:00Z,"TEPPER--Martin, died on March 31, 2011. Survived by his wife Cathe, brother Jerrold, daughters Arielle and Abby, son-in-law Ian, and grandchildren Izzy, Jonah and Sasha. First and foremost, he was a loving husband, father and grandfather--nothing brought a bigger smile to his face than the sight of one of his kids or grand kids. Martin spent the majority of his career in real estate turning nothing into something by renovating coops in the New York City area. With a law degree from Rutgers and an MBA from The Wharton School of Business, it was no doubt that Martin brought with him some serious bargaining skills when working out real estate deals. In 2001, after moving to Florida Martin continually looked for real estate opportunities, but what he loved most was spending time with Abby and doing the crossword puzzles with Cathe and trying to figure out how to skype with his grandkids in New York City. He will be sorely missed by us all. A private funeral service will be held in Florida."
2011-04-05T00:00:00Z,"COLLINS--J. Anthony, age 71, of Old Saybrook, CT died peacefully at home on April 2 attended by his adoring wife, Alva Greenberg, after a 17 month battle with brain cancer. An international business executive in the printing and publishing fields, he founded and led many successful companies, most recently Colortone and Brook and Whittle both of North Branford. Born in Preswich, England, Anthony graduated from the University of Manchester with a degree in Printing and Technology. He moved to Dublin in 1964 and to Connecticut in 1982. Anthony's many friends remember him as an incomparable host and raconteur. His lifelong passion for sailing included annual voyages on his Hinckley between Newport and Tortola as well as on a trans-Atlantic crossing in 1994. Though told that he would only survive a diagnosis of stage 4 Glioblastoma for six to welve months, at eight months Anthony was climbing a 3,200 foot mountain and at eleven months he had just returned from a trip to Turkey. He may not have won the war against this disease, but he came out on top of most of the skirmishes with his jacket and kerchief unsullied. In addition to his wife, Alva, he is survived by his four children, Jonathan, Andrew, Matthew and Sarah and their spouses; his nine grandchildren, his mother Anne Collins and sister Susan Absalom, both of Lithum St. Anne's, England, his former wife Fionuala Collins of Dublin and three step-children Ben, William and Gwyn Gahagan.

Sure enough, states where people have to guard against more infectious diseases (presumably because of climate) had lower average IQs. This is one of those studies where it is important to remember that correlation is not causation.

Many people knew him as the man at the end of the bar, drinking tequila and Heineken, occasionally playing video games. “We did parties last month for the First Precinct and the Hells Angels,” said Paul Sevigny, who, along with Nur Khan, began working with Hill about seven months ago to bring some new blood to the place. “That’s how universally loved he was.” Loved, yes, but also a mystery even to those who knew him — details about his family and childhood remain fuzzy. “You’d go in there with someone who’d never been and you’d be like, ‘Oh, there’s Don!’ And people would be like, ‘There’s actually a Don Hill?’” said the makeup artist Mike Potter. “People didn’t know he was a real person.” Like many, Potter, a club regular in the ’90s, has Don Hill’s to thank for his career: After John Cameron Mitchell recognized him from the SqueezeBox party, the two became friendly, which led to Potter doing the makeup for “Hedwig and the Angry Inch.” Brendan Manning, of the New York City chapter of the Hells Angels, points out that Hill, whose memorial service is tonight at St. Patrick’s Cathedral in NoLIta, had booked — for $200 a week — “a guy named Bruce Springsteen,” back in the Kenny’s Castaways days.

Several years ago, an amateur historian discovered a death certificate showing that Gherardini was buried at a convent in central Florence.

Sean Hayes, the ''Will and Grace'' star, Tony Awards show host and Tony-nominated performer for last year's revival of ''Promises, Promises,'' is set to play Larry, the frizzy-haired, fiddle-playing member of the Three Stooges in a new ''Three Stooges'' movie to be directed by Bobby and Peter Farrelly (''There's Something About Mary,'' ''Hall Pass''). The Hollywood Reporter said that Mr. Hayes will join Will Sasso, of ''MAD TV'' and ''$#*! My Dad Says,'' who is set to play the follicularly deficient Curly Howard. The movie is not a biographical film and will instead feature a slapstick trio in new comedy sketches based on the original Stooges. It has already taken a few eye gouges en route to the big screen: at one time, the planned cast included Sean Penn as Larry, Jim Carrey as Curly and Benicio Del Toro as Moe, but that fell apart like a high-society pie dinner after Mr. Penn withdrew from the project. A new actor to play Moe and a release date for ''The Three Stooges'' ain't yet soiten (and they haven't been determined either).

The Philharmonic was forced to cancel a trip last year after the United States Treasury Department declined to allow orchestra patrons to go along. It later granted a license when the Philharmonic designated the patrons as docents for the educational concert, putting them in the realm of what United States sanctions permit for visitors to Cuba."

The research, part of the landmark Women's Health Initiative study, is likely to surprise women and their doctors, who for years have heard frightening news about the risks of hormone therapy. But most of those fears are related to the use of a combination of two hormones, estrogen and progestin, which are prescribed to relieve hot flashes and other symptoms of menopause, and have been shown to increase a woman's risk of breast cancer."

2011-04-06T00:00:00Z,"Mort Sahl may not have wanted his comedy album ''At Sunset'' to be recorded, but it is now headed for a permanent place in the audio archives of the Library of Congress, along with works by Tammy Wynette, Captain Beefheart, Al Green, Steely Dan and De La Soul, as well as one of the earliest recordings of ''Take Me Out to the Ball Game.'' The library plans to announce on Wednesday that among 25 ''culturally, historically or aesthetically significant'' entries that have been added to the National Recording Registry are ''At Sunset,'' the album by Mr. Sahl, above, recorded in 1955 at the Sunset Auditorium in Carmel, Calif., and later withdrawn because it was not authorized. Also being added are recordings of ''Dark Was the Night, Cold Was the Ground'' by Blind Willie Johnson; ''Tipitina'' by Professor Longhair; Henry Mancini's ''Peter Gunn'' theme music; De La Soul's ''3 Feet High and Rising''; and ''Trout Mask Replica'' by Captain Beefheart and His Magic Band. Lest it be accused of skewing too hip, the library has also selected Edward Meeker's 1908 recording of ''Take Me Out to the Ball Game,'' performed with the Edison Orchestra and including the rarely heard second verse, which, says the library, reminds us ''that the song is about a baseball-loving woman.'' The entries were chosen by the librarian of Congress, James H. Billington, and the library's National Recording Preservation Board."

After leaving the stage, Eddie joined the NYCB administration, becoming an indispensable associate to both Balanchine and Kirstein. Throughout his life Eddie was a devoted and dedicated friend and supporter of both NYCB and SAB, and will be deeply missed by generations of artists who so greatly benefited from his unwavering compassion and commitment over the years.

The samples would then be assembled into a piece of music, with the ultimate goal of performing it live on the tower itself. Mr. Bertolozzi traveled to Paris in the fall to present his project, and he received a letter of approval last month. The tower operating company said it was open to the idea of a live concert but was making no promises. Now, Mr. Bertolozzi said, all he has to do is raise the money. He said his aim was to have performances in 2014, the tower's 125th anniversary. This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print."

Schwartz, MD, the Lamport Distinguished Professor and the first Dean of the Graduate School of Biological Sciences. He was Dean from 1965 to 1980, when he became Dean Emeritus. Under Dr. Schwartz's early leadership, Mount Sinai grew as a center of excellence in translational research. He believed in the ""vital interdisciplinary interactions among clinicians, basic scientists, medical students, and graduate students within one institution."" Dr. Schwartz was also the first Chair of what is now the Department of Structural and Chemical Biology at Mount Sinai School of Medicine and Director of the Mount Sinai Center for Polypeptide Research. His work evolved from whole animal and organ physiology to molecular science. His studies on peptides ranged from bedside observations, to biochemical mechanisms of action, to the definition of the three-dimensional structure of such molecules in solution and in the crystalline state. After retiring in 1989, Dr. Schwartz continued to actively support the intellectual vitality of the Graduate School. He drew upon his worldwide network of scientific colleagues, inviting them to Mount Sinai as distinguished speakers and guests.

2011-04-07T00:00:00Z,"MARK HOGANCAMP died 11 years ago tomorrow, when five men kicked his head in outside a Kingston, N.Y., bar in the early morning hours. He was reborn months later, after he awoke from a nine-day coma, his memory wiped nearly clean of the details of his life -- his early marriage, girlfriends, family, Navy service, thundering alcoholism, homelessness, jail time -- and he had to relearn how to eat, walk and think at age 38. Feeling shunned by the outside world, he created his own world, a tiny society called Marwencol. Made from scraps of plywood and peopled with a tribe of Barbies and World War II action figures, Marwencol grew along the side of his trailer home near Kingston. (Mr. Hogancamp named his new world after himself and Wendy and Colleen, two women he had crushes on.) Narratives surrounding a downed American fighter pilot rescued by Marwencol's all-female population began unfurling against a backdrop that was nominally a World War II setting, in Belgium. The themes, however, were Mr. Hogancamp's own: the brutality of men, the safe haven of a town of women, the twin demons of rage and fear. Mr. Hogancamp captured his stories with thousands of photographs, shooting on an old Pentax with a broken light meter. The noirish images, complete with blood flecks in the snow, are riveting and emotional."

The publisher Little, Brown said on Wednesday that it had acquired a book that Mr. Abrams, the director of ''Star Trek'' and a creator of the television series ''Lost,'' ''Alias'' and ''Felicity,'' had conceived and will be written by Doug Dorst, the author of the supernatural crime novel ''Alive in Necropolis.'' A release from the publisher happily cited Mr. Abrams's film and television credits and mentioned that Mr. Dorst is a graduate of the Iowa Writers' Workshop and a three-time ''Jeopardy!'' champion. And Mr. Abrams said in a statement that ''Doug is a genius,'' adding that he ''could not be more excited to collaborate with him on this completely original project.''

These types of lightweight scanners are typically long and flat, and they connect to a computer through the USB port. As you feed sheets of paper into a slot on the device's side, the scanner converts the document into a PDF file in the computer.

2011-04-07T00:00:00Z,"HAHN--Stephen. The art world has lost one of its great dealer-collectors with the passing of Stephen Hahn on April 2, 2011. Stephen was born February 1, 1921 in Hungary and spent his formative years in Paris. He came to New York from post-war Europe and was drawn to art dealing which he learned from his father, who was a well-known art dealer specializing in the works of the Old Masters. During the war, he was deported from Portugal, as a French refugee, to Santo Domingo where he remained for 6 years, finding work as a surveyor. When the war was over, he returned to his shattered family in Paris, eventually studying teaching at the Sorbonne. At age 30, he moved to Greenwich Village in New York City and started buying and selling paintings out of the trunk of his car. He met Jean Dubuffet and became a champion of the relatively unknown painter. Eventually, he established the Stephen Hahn gallery on 75th and Madison, which remained a famous fixture for over two decades. Many well-known people visited the gallery and became clients, including Charles Laughton, Edward G. Robinson, Woody Allen, Edward Albee, Mike Nichols and Greta Garbo. Stephen continued his rise to prominence by representing Norton Simon at Sotheby's and Christie's auctions and he counseled him in the acquisition of many important pieces of his collection. His friends and colleagues included prominent European and American dealers and collectors, including Richard Feigen, Gene Thaw, Bill Aquavella, Thomas Gibson, Daniel Malingue, Alexandre Rosenberg, Leo Castelli, Heinz Berggruen, Klaus Perls, and many others. His personal collection was notable for its extensive depth, breath and quality. It included major works by Cezanne, Picasso, Matisse among other great modern masters, with a particular appreciation for Jean Dubuffet. Many of the paintings which passed through Stephen's hands now hang in the important museums, institutions and private collections of the world. Stephen was one of the founding members and an early president of the Art Dealers Association. He donated works to major cultural institutions both in the US and abroad. Stephen was not just a dealer but also a scholar of impeccable honesty and taste, with an encyclopedic knowledge on the history of any given painting. As such, he was called on many times to validate a painting's authenticity. His eye for quality was universally respected and he was internationally acknowledged as the authority not only on Picasso, but also Degas and Douanier Rousseau, In Clifford Irving's book ""Fake"" Stephen is mentioned numerous times in relation to a large collection of Picassos. Stephen Daniel Saidenberg and Klaus Perls were all in agreement: 43 of the Picassos hanging on the walls were fake. Stephen had a great passion for the musical arts. He was an opera lover, Wagner in particular. One of his great enjoyments was attending Ring Cycle productions around the globe. His devotion to music was clearly exemplified by his generosity as a benefactor of The Music Academy of the West in Santa Barbara, CA. Many of the young musicians and singers he sponsored have gone onto become some of today's esteemed classical musical talents, including pianist Vassily Primakov and soprano Susanna Phillips, who would often come to stay, practice and perform in his Montecito home. Stephen's legacy at the Music Academy lives on in the beautiful conservatory space he endowed, Hahn Hall, completed in 2008. Stephen's achievements are a testament to his fascinating character and many qualities. His dignity and savor-faire made him preferred among dealers and clients, his intelligence, mischievous wit, and charm made him a favorite at the table. His drive and competitive spirit was manifest in his love of sports. He frequently traveled with a tennis racquet. Stephen approached life with keen observance and thoughtfulness. He was truly kind and generous and very devoted to his family. A man who once wielded substantial power in his sphere entered the twilight of his life with touching grace and a lively glint in his eye. He is predeceased by his sister Agnes Brodie, survived by his wife, Carla, his sister Suzanne, his children, Robert, Elizabeth, Thomas. Isabella and Lily, his stepchildren, Zachary, Brandon, and Katharine O'Brien, six grandchildren, a niece and a nephew. In lieu of flowers, contributions in his name may be made to; Music Academy of the West, Attention: Gift Processor, 1070 Fairway Rd, Santa Barbara, CA 93108."

2011-04-08T00:00:00Z,"AUGUSTA, Ga. - With high-definition television and super-slow-motion replays increasingly playing a role in how golf's rules are implemented, the sport's governing bodies took a step back Thursday, revising a rule so that some golfers in unique situations would be only penalized, not disqualified. At issue is the occasion when a player is not aware he has breached a rule and could not reasonably be expected to have known. Recently, with the use of advanced video technologies, minor breaches of the rules have been discovered on television. In the past, a player who signed a scorecard without applying the appropriate penalty was disqualified. Under the new interpretation, the player would still receive the penalty but not a disqualification. ''This is a solution to a modern phenomenon that the rules never contemplated,'' said Mike Davis, executive director of the United States Golf Association. ''These are things that could not happen in day-to-day competition and couldn't be discovered without specialized cameras that zoom in and make a golf ball look the size of a basketball.'' Earlier this year, Padraig Harrington was disqualified after he shot an opening-round 65 at the Abu Dhabi Championship when a slow-motion replay on high-definition television revealed that his ball moved ever so slightly as he was removing his ball mark on the green. Harrington was unaware the ball moved and none of his playing partners or anyone else on the green reported the ball moving. If they had, a two-stroke penalty should have been assessed. Because the rules violation was not assessed at the time, Harrington signed an incorrect scorecard, which led to a disqualification. With Thursday's change, which was announced just before the first round of the Masters and goes into effect immediately, Harrington would still have two shots added to his score but could have continued to play. Another celebrated case this year involved Camilo Villegas, who was disqualified for signing an incorrect card after a television viewer noticed he had tamped down a divot near where his ball was rolling down a slope. Villegas would still be disqualified under the new rule because the rules violation in this case was for not knowing a rule. ''Ignorance of the rules is not what this interpretation applies to,'' Peter Dawson, chief executive of the Scotland-based R&A, which along with the U.S.G.A. announced the new rule. ''It is for a limited number of circumstances. We don't think it will arise too often. But we were troubled by disproportionate disqualification penalties for small breaches of the rules.'' The change is not actually to the Rules of Golf, but to the large book of decisions on the rules that guides officials in specific cases. The new interpretation is of Decision 33-7/4.5 and in practice it gives officials far greater latitude when determining if a player should be disqualified. This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print."

2011-04-08T00:00:00Z,"Once the network of female protagonists in unexpected professions and/or life-or-death situations, Showtime continues its transition to the network of offbeat celebrity casting that we're willing to at least give a chance. (And also ''Gigolos.'') Adding to a roster of original programming that includes ''The Borgias,'' ''Shameless,'' ''Weeds'' and ''The Big C,'' Showtime said on Thursday it had picked up the first seasons of two new series: ''House of Lies,'' a comedy starring Don Cheadle and Kristen Bell, and ''Homeland,'' a drama starring Claire Danes, Damien Lewis and Mandy Patinkin. In ''House of Lies,'' Mr. Cheadle (of the ''Ocean's Eleven'' movies) plays a ruthless management consultant and Ms. Bell (''Veronica Mars'') plays a colleague at his firm. ''Homeland'' casts Ms. Danes (who is forsaking HBO, the network that put her in ''Temple Grandin'') as a C.I.A. officer with doubts about the recent rescue of a missing United States soldier (Mr. Lewis); Mr. Patinkin plays her C.I.A. boss and mentor.

2011-04-08T00:00:00Z,"Apparently, banks in the United States don't think their boardrooms were the problem. That's the obvious interpretation when so little has shifted at them since before the crisis. Many directors clearly lacked the educational or work backgrounds needed to understand the derivatives and other complex products whose risks eventually overtook their institutions. Worse, they forgot or never learned the many lessons of past bubbles and manias. And industry knowledge on bank boards is no more extensive today than it was four years ago. At nine big American banks, including Goldman Sachs and Wells Fargo, only about one of every seven nonexecutive directors has any financial expertise, roughly the same percentage as in 2007, according to research by Nestor Advisors. That compares to nearly one in three at a comparable sampling of large European banks, where there has been improvement since the crisis."

2011-04-09T00:00:00Z,"8 P.M. (TCM) THE ESSENTIALS: DIRECTED BY ELIA KAZAN As a theater and film director, Kazan helped bring into focus the method acting style of Marlon Brando, James Dean, Karl Malden and Eli Wallach. Widely honored, his movies earned 22 Academy Awards and 62 nominations. Yet he became a polarizing figure when, in 1952, he appeared as a witness for the House Un-American Activities Committee investigation into Communist influences in Hollywood. The reverberations of his testimony were felt even at the 1999 Oscar ceremony, during which the presentation of an honorary award to Kazan was greeted by both standing ovations and stony silence. This four-film tribute begins with ''Splendor in the Grass'' (1961), the William Inge drama, starring Natalie Wood and Warren Beatty (above with Ms. Wood), about sexual repression in small-town Kansas during the 1920s. ''The Sea of Grass'' (1947), with Katharine Hepburn and Spencer Tracy as a husband and wife on the American frontier, follows at 10:15; ''America, America'' (1963), a fictionalized account of Kazan's family's immigration to the United States, at 12:30; and ''A Face in the Crowd'' (1957), with Patricia Neal as a radio reporter who turns a folk-singing drifter (Andy Griffith) into a media star, at 3:30. The hosts Robert Osborne and Alec Baldwin explain why the films are required viewing. 10:30 A.M.

2011-04-09T00:00:00Z,"In the face of a lawsuit from the AARP Foundation, the Department of Housing and Urban Development has backed off an apparent policy change that was putting some widows and widowers on the brink of foreclosure. The dust-up involves reverse mortgages, financial products that allow older Americans with a decent amount of home equity to tap some of that equity if they are at least 62 years old. Unlike a home equity loan, where you have to pay the money back, with a reverse mortgage the bank pays you, say in a lump sum or in monthly payments. Once you no longer live in the home, you or your executor (if you're dead) sells it and pays the bank back."

The agreement, reached late Sunday night, ended a bitter six-month strike at the orchestra. It was approved in a vote by the players that ended on Friday afternoon, a union spokesman said. The orchestra has hastily organized free concerts on Saturday and Sunday, the first since last season, in the orchestra's home, the Max M. Fisher Music Center. Minimum salaries were $104,650, although principal players generally made more. Now, the minimum will be $79,000 next season and go up to $82,900 in the third and final year of the contract. However, each player can earn up to $6,900 more a year if they choose to take part in community outreach activities - something that many already do."

The defendants were apparently worried in 1999 that investigators might be on their trail. While the government would not arrest them until more than a decade later, it was no idle fear: The trader who federal prosecutors say turned the lawyer's tips into $32 million in illicit profits had been accused of insider trading by a brokerage firm that year."

2011-04-09T00:00:00Z,"The movie-palace splendor of Radio City Music Hall made an appropriately majestic backdrop for Explosions in the Sky, an instrumental rock band from Austin, Tex., whose music can swell to fill any grand space. The group was headlining a triple bill -- with the band Low and a solo-piano set by Eluvium, a k a Matthew Cooper -- that elevated modest brooding to monumental scale. The big-hall concert was in part a reward for indie-rock perseverance: Explosions in the Sky released its first recordings in 2000, Low in 1994. Explosions in the Sky played a continuous 74-minute set, segueing nine compositions with no encore: an unbroken reverie. The pieces began quietly, often with just a lone guitar outlining a basic chord or repeating a single note, as if meditating on the possibilities within consonance. Then other layers materialized from two more guitars, bass and drums: overlapping arpeggios, brief melodic lines, drumbeats that tapped lightly and grew increasingly martial and, sooner or later, the frenetic shimmer of tremolo-strummed chords. Loops and echoey recorded sounds, including garbled voices, could also join the mix, and eventually some pieces boiled over into crashing distortion."

The median salary for C.E.O.'s at about 200 big American companies rose 12 percent last year, while the average was up 20 percent, according to data compiled by Equilar. By comparison, average pay for American workers in the private sector rose 2.1 percent in 2010, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics. Many large corporations have not yet publicly disclosed compensation, so paydays for other executives could surpass those of the 30 C.E.O.'s listed below. For instance, Leslie Moonves of the CBS Corporation made $43 million in 2009, which would have easily earned him one of the top spots that year. But the company had not disclosed his pay in time for publication."

They ruled that this season, shootout wins would be thrown out if teams were tied in the standings, and it was under that proviso that the Rangers entered their last game behind Carolina in the race for the final Eastern playoff spot. They had the same number of points, but the Hurricanes were ahead because they had more nonshootout victories."

The reissue of the Lindbergh Hour Angle watch ($4,725) features the oversize textured crown. The 42 hours of power reserve, longer than the duration of Lindbergh's original flight, should outlast a plane trip these days, whether flying solo or crowded in coach. BRUCE PASK"

Visitors traipsed through a forest of Lebanese cedar trees and snapped photos of goat pens and stacked pyramids of vegetables, with the Arc de Triomphe looming above. It was all part of Nature Capitale, a large-scale installation created by the French street artist Gad Weil, who timed it to coincide with International Biodiversity Day, an annual event sponsored by the United Nations. The spectacle drew two million visitors, among them two surprise guests: the French president, Nicolas Sarkozy, and his wife, Carla Bruni, who wore jeans and an untucked oxford shirt with rolled-up sleeves, providing a bit of barnyard chic in the Eighth Arrondissement. The event -- the next Nature Capitale is scheduled for June in Lyon -- was equal parts ecological celebration and fund-raiser for two groups: Jeunes Agriculteurs, an organization of young French farmers, and France Bois Forêt, devoted to the French forest and timber industries. In typical French fashion, it also included a protest against a dip in agriculture prices. Despite its reputation for fur and foie gras, Paris had begun to embrace the ecological movement with the earnestness of leading eco-minded cities like Copenhagen and Vancouver."

He was born and raised in Philadelphia, PA, where he graduated from St. Joseph's University and subsequently Jefferson Medical College in 1956 with his Medical Degree. He completed his residency in Surgery at Graduate Hospital Philadelphia and completed a Cardiothoracic Surgery Fellowship at Parkland Hospital in Dallas, TX in 1963. During this time, he cared for Gov. Connally, shot during the assassination of John F. Kennedy and is listed in the Warren Report in this capacity. He served in the Navy on the US FDR from 1958-1960, worked at Bethesda Naval Hospital during Operation Desert Storm, and was in the Navy Reserves until 1996. His life and career have been defined by serving his country, the underserved, and he has dedicated his life to the care and training of others, travelling to many countries to establish local surgical training programs and teaching advanced surgical technique, including trips to Vietnam in 1972, Nigeria and Egypt in 1975, Guatemala in 1976, Taiwan in 1980, Haiti in 1985, and worked on a Sioux Reservation in South Dakota in 1979. Throughout this time, he was a Professor and Chairman of the Department of Surgery of West Virginia University, Charleston Division. He founded the department and surgical residency program in Charleston and served as Chief of Staff for several years. More notable than any specific accomplishment is the pattern of service and education throughout his life, focused not on the most glamorous aspects of medicine but instead targeted on serving underserved areas. He is survived by his wife of 48 years, Kathryn Watts Boland of Dallas, TX; his brother Rev. Msgr. John P. Boland of Philadelphia, PA; his six children; and nine grandchildren. He was a dedicated teacher, mentor, and advocate for his trainees and patients. It is unquestionable that his was a life of service to his family, his community, his state, and unwaveringly to his country. He was well loved by all and will be sorely missed.

Jean Marsh reprises her Emmy-winning role as the parlor maid Rose Buck, rehired as the housekeeper by the new residents, Sir Hallam Holland (Ed Stoppard) and his wife, Lady Agnes (Keeley Hawes). Eileen Atkins, who created the original show with Ms. Marsh, takes on the role of Lady Maud Holland, Hallam's imperious and eccentric mother, whose return from India with a Sikh secretary and a monkey in tow interferes with her daughter-in-law's management of the house. Writing in The New York Times, Alessandra Stanley said Ms. Marsh and Ms. Atkins are ''exactly what this delightful and absorbing drama requires.''

Formerly of Harrisburg, Pennsylvania, and Baltimore, she was the daughter of the late Alex Grass, the founder of the Rite Aid drugstore chain, and Lois Lehrman Grass. She is survived by her husband, Claude, a Professor of Psychiatry at New York University School of Medicine; her daughter Rachel Shapiro, and her husband Christopher Grymes; and her son Adam Shapiro.

She was founding Executive Director of Concertante, an internationally acclaimed chamber music ensemble that performs and expands the string sextet repertoire. She founded the Arts for Talented Youth (ATY) program at the Peabody Institute. ATY was one of the first secondary school music program to develop and use a structured curriculum integrating dancers, instrumentalists, and singers. Until her death, she was a Vice-President of the Elaine Kaufman Cultural Center, as well as serving as the Chairman of the Special Music School's Participating Board. The Special Music School is the only school in the United States that integrates a public school education with structured musical instrument training (the musical education is supported by the Kaufman Center-the private partner).

Consider the tulips, cherry trees and begonias along the median of Park Avenue. Mary Woodard Lasker, a philanthropist and a champion of medical research, was considered a pioneer in the 1950s when she urged her fellow citizens to make donations for the plantings on the avenue. That led to the creation of the Fund for Park Avenue, which, like the Central Park Conservancy and other groups that raise money for city parks, depends on annual donations from neighboring buildings and their residents."

The area is planted with what grows despite a scarcity of water: cereal grains like wheat, barley and corn. For several days in June 2010, the photographer Edward Burtynsky says he rented ''a pilot, a fuel truck and a helicopter'' and, from 2,000 feet up, documented the haphazardly patterned and colored crop fields roughly carved into the spaces between darker rock formations, after the crops were harvested. ''You can still see a little bit of the earth and the color of the dried crop,'' Burtynsky says. ''I think the combination of those two things really created the kind of color palate that I like.''"

2011-04-10T00:00:00Z,"ALONG the shores of the Indian Ocean, as the coastline east of Adelaide, Australia, wends its rocky way toward Melbourne, lies one of the world's classic drives: the Great Ocean Road. Here, brutal, slicing surf and weather pound malleable limestone and sandstone, eating away at the Australian continent, and leaving mile after mile of sweeping vistas of sculptured cliffs, towers and arches framed against the roiling turquoise sea. I first traveled the Great Ocean Road in 2002, and I still remember beams of sunlight cutting through the clouds to illuminate 150-foot stone pillars jutting out of the sea, the last stalwarts of land in its eternal losing battle with the ocean. As my wedding approached last fall, that indelible image was enough to convince me that the drive would be the perfect way to begin a two-month honeymoon through Australia and New Zealand; we'd camp on the beach, take surfing lessons, hike alongside kangaroos and koalas and luxuriate in a landscape so blissful and majestic that we'd be in full honeymoon mode by the time we reached Melbourne."

2011-04-10T00:00:00Z,"BAKER--Howard, passed away suddenly while vacationing in Jupiter, Florida, on February 28th, with his beloved Cynthia by his side. The cause of death was heart failure. Howard was known for his deep generosity, courage, humor, and intellect. During World War II, at a time when the Navy was suffering its most severe casualties from kamikaze attacks on Okinawa, Howard volunteered to join the Navy at the age of 17. He served for two years, with a commitment and humility which would characterize his many relationships and contributions during his 83 years. Howard was a New York State licensed professional Engineer. He was a proud graduate of Cornell University, where he received his Bachelor of Science in Engineering degree in 1951. Together with his brother, Norman, he began a successful construction business based in Long Island City. During his 50 years as a contractor in New York, Howard worked on many of the cities most prominent landmarks, including Morgan Post Office, Trump Tower, The Museum of Natural History, and the Brooklyn Bridge. Howard was also reknowned for taking on dangerous projects which other contractors declined, accomplishing the restoration of structures in danger of imminent collapse. In addition to his professional pursuits, Howard was an avid athlete, who for many years served as a volunteer on the National Ski Patrol. He was a director of the United States Amateur Ski Association, winning many races himself. He supported the U.S. Ski Team, and created standards for safer skiing. He was a dedicated member of the Miramar Ski Club in Waitsfield, Vermont, and also served as their president. Additionally, Howard was a board member of the Queens Businessman's Chapter of the American Red Cross and was honored for his many years of service to that organization. Howard suffered from Parkinson's Disease for 15 years. Despite the many physical trials from this disease, Howard maintained his signature humor, grace, and unflagging energy. When Howard could no longer pursue his many athletic interests, he and Cynthia became more active in the Conservative Synagogue of Fifth Avenue. Until his death Howard served as both a Board Member of the synagogue and recently as First Vice President. One business associate summed up his remembrance of Mr. Baker by saying that ""In the 25 years I knew him, I never heard him say anything bad about anyone, and never heard anyone say anything bad about him."" Howard's generosity to family, friends, business associates, and to the many charities he supported will long be remembered. In addition to Cynthia, Howard is survived by his brother Norman, who was his lifetime business partner, and by his nephews Daniel Baker (Emmy), and Mitchell Baker (Thom), and niece Elizabeth Atwood (Bill) and cherished grandnieces and nephews Olivia, Emeline, Jacob, and Emil. Donations can be made in Howard's memory to the National Parkinson's Foundation for Research and to the Conservative Synagogue of Fifth Avenue."

Born to Morris and Bertha Levin during the Russian Civil War, she was raised in the Bronx with her two brothers, Edward and Louis. In 1944, she married the late Ed Wiener, a prominent modernist jewelry designer. They began their careers in the art circles of Greenwich Village and Provincetown during the early days of abstract expressionism. A pioneer in her field, Mrs. Wiener first traveled to India and Southeast Asia in 1966, at a time when there were few professional opportunities for women. It was against this backdrop that, starting in the late 1960s, she organized ground-breaking sale exhibitions of Indian and Southeast Asian sculpture and painting. Among her many clients were John D. Rockefeller III, Igor Stravinksy and Jacqueline Kennedy. Iconic works of art from The Doris Wiener Gallery formed the basis of many major museum collections of Asian art world-wide. These include The Metropolitan Museum of Art, The Cleveland Museum of Art, The Norton Simon Museum of Art, Asia Society and The Brooklyn Museum, among others. Mrs. Wiener remained a leading dealer in her field until her death. She is survived by two daughters, Michele Caplan and Nancy Wiener, their husbands, Jonathan Caplan and Corwith Hamill, and three grandchildren: Daniel Caplan, Jeffery Caplan, and Jonathan Hamill.

Mrs. Bronfman, the daughter of John L. Loeb, Sr. and Frances Lehman Loeb, was born on September 19, 1932 in New York City. Her father was a leading member of the investment community who served as the head of the Wall Street firm of Loeb, Rhoades & Company, a predecessor of Shearson Lehman/American Express. Her mother, the daughter of Arthur Lehman of the Lehman Brothers banking firm, was New York City's Commissioner for the United Nations and the Consular Corps for 12 years in the 1960's and 1970's. Mrs. Bronfman devoted her life to numerous philanthropic efforts, including funding and directing programs through the Ann L. Bronfman Foundation, which she founded and ran. She supported a range of causes, from education to senior citizens to underserved youth to victims of domestic abuse to the arts, among others. Mrs. Bronfman served as a Trustee of Rosemary Hall and was presented with the school's Alumnae Award in 1999 for ""demonstrating outstanding achievement in her given field of endeavor."" She was the benefactor of the Ann Loeb Bronfman Gallery at the Washington, DC Jewish Community Center. The gallery offers exhibitions and programs that enhance Jewish identity, examine issues of social importance and develop community. In 2010, Mrs. Bronfman was honored by the Teamwork Foundation for her many years of support. The Bronx, NY based organization, which includes the world famous New York Gauchos basketball program, provides after-school and summer programs to inner city boys and girls. ""Ann Loeb Bronfman is living proof that greatness is not inherited; it is achieved,"" wrote ""JCA Today,"" a publication of the Jewish Council for the Aging, in 2006. ""By refusing to rest on others"" laurels, Ann has literally changed the world, adding compassion to an otherwise uncaring place. Her singleness of purpose and generosity of spirit teach us all that we, too, possess the power to change the world if we, like Ann, listen to our hearts."" Mrs. Bronfman graduated from the Rosemary Hall school, then of Greenwich, CT, in 1950 and attended Bennington College in Bennington, VT before marrying her husband, Edgar M. Bronfman, in 1953. Mr. and Mrs. Bronfman were divorced in 1973. Mrs. Bronfman divided her time between her homes in Washington, DC and Mackinac Island, MI. She was an avid sailor and spent many happy times on her boat.

2011-04-10T00:00:00Z,"REID--William Lewis Jr. 96, a New Canaan, CT resident since 1952, died Tuesday, March 29th, at Norwalk Hospital. Born December 5th, 1914 in Winston Salem, North Carolina, Bill, 96, was the middle child of three sons of William Lewis Reid, Sr. and Rillie Garrison Reid. Mr. Reid graduated from the University of North Carolina, Chapel Hill, North Carolina in 1936. He was a member of the Beta Theta Pi fraternity and received his Doctor of Jurisprudence in 1938. In October of 1941, he married Margaret Elizabeth Parry in Grace Church, New York. In 1942 he was commissioned in the US Navy and served as a Lt. Commander in the Pacific during World War II. He left the Navy as a commander and began his business career in New York's famed Flatiron building in the 1940s. Being a man of independent and entrepreneurial spirit, Reid founded his own business, The William Reid Company; he worked closely with his associates in the British Isles, where Driway Weather Coats began its long and prosperous life, spanning five decades. Reid was elected to membership in The British-AmericanChamber of Commerce in 1958. His loyal customers included such industry icons as J. Press, Paul Stuart, and Brooks Brothers. Active in the New Canaan community, Reid was a devoted member of St. Mark's Church where he served on the vestry and was one of the founding fathers behind the now famous St. Mark's Strawberry Festival & Fair. At that time, the church was located in the old building on God's Acre. He served on the board of the Visiting Nurse Association for several years and was an active member of The New Canaan Senior Men's Club and Woodway Country Club of Darien. He was renowned for his woodworking skills, creating unique pieces of furniture cherished by friends and family; his largest project was a traditional, two-story barn which graces his property on Jelliff Mill Road. Reid's mother's ancestors, the Garrisons, were knighted in France by Henry of Nevall. French Huguenots, they migrated in the 1680s, settling in what is now Garrison, NY across from West Point on the Hudson River Mr. Reid loved to entertain family and friends with stories of his family's involvement in the Civil War, or the War Between the States, as he insisted on calling it. His grandfather, Captain Richard Walker Reid, was a member of Jeb Stuart's famous Calvary, CSA (Confederate States of America). On the other side, his grandfather Garrison, of St. Louis, Missouri, donated land for a home at 912 North Garrison Street for William Tecumseh Sherman. Reid is survived by his wife, Barbara Smith Reid of Greenwich: two daughters and their husbands, Betsy Reid Creedon and Gaylord Creedon of Grosse Pointe, MI, and Margaret Reid Ogden and Dayton Ogden, Jr. of New Canaan; four grandchildren: Dayton Reid Ogden, and his wife Laura of New Canaan, Margaret Ogden Hughes and her husband, Iwan of New Canaan, Catherine Parry Creedon of Brooklyn and Reid Miller Creedon and his wife Sarah of Washington, D.C.; four great-grandchildren; Eirlys Margaret Hughes, Dayton Palmer Ogden, William Parry Hughes and Virginia Ann Ogden all of New Canaan; and many beloved nieces, nephews, grand nieces and grand nephews. Reid was predeceased by his first wife of 30 years, Margaret Parry Reid. He then married Betina Ferris of New Canaan who died shortly thereafter. Family members will remember Mr. Reid as a devoted father and grandfather who was a ""larger than life"" magnetic character, a man always grateful for the many blessings in his life. A memorial service was held on Sunday, April 3rd at St. Mark's Episcopal Church. Contributions in memory of Mr. Reid may be made to St. Mark's Episcopal Church or a charity of your choice.

2011-04-10T00:00:00Z,"HAHN--Stephen. The art world has lost one of its great dealer-collectors with the passing of Stephen Hahn on April 2, 2011. Stephen was born February 1, 1921 in Hungary and spent his formative years in Paris. He came to New York from post-war Europe and was drawn to art dealing which he learned from his father, who was a well-known art dealer specializing in the works of the Old Masters. During the war, he was deported from Portugal, as a French refugee, to Santo Domingo where he remained for 6 years, finding work as a surveyor. When the war was over, he returned to his shattered family in Paris, eventually studying teaching at the Sorbonne. At age 30, he moved to Greenwich Village in New York City and started buying and selling paintings out of the trunk of his car. He met Jean Dubuffet and became a champion of the relatively unknown painter. Eventually, he established the Stephen Hahn gallery on 75th and Madison, which remained a famous fixture for over two decades. Many well-known people visited the gallery and became clients, including Charles Laughton, Edward G. Robinson, Woody Allen, Edward Albee, Mike Nichols and Greta Garbo. Stephen continued his rise to prominence by representing Norton Simon at Sotheby's and Christie's auctions and he counseled him in the acquisition of many important pieces of his collection. His friends and colleagues included prominent European and American dealers and collectors, including Richard Feigen, Gene Thaw, Bill Aquavella, Thomas Gibson, Daniel Malingue, Alexandre Rosenberg, Leo Castelli, Heinz Berggruen, Klaus Perls, and many others. His personal collection was notable for its extensive depth, breath and quality. It included major works by Cezanne, Picasso, Matisse among other great modern masters, with a particular appreciation for Jean Dubuffet. Many of the paintings which passed through Stephen's hands now hang in the important museums, institutions and private collections of the world. Stephen was one of the founding members and an early president of the Art Dealers Association. He donated works to major cultural institutions both in the US and abroad. Stephen was not just a dealer but also a scholar of impeccable honesty and taste, with an encyclopedic knowledge on the history of any given painting. As such, he was called on many times to validate a painting's authenticity. His eye for quality was universally respected and he was internationally acknowledged as the authority not only on Picasso, but also Degas and Douanier Rousseau, In Clifford Irving's book ""Fake"" Stephen is mentioned numerous times in relation to a large collection of Picassos. Stephen Daniel Saidenberg and Klaus Perls were all in agreement: 43 of the Picassos hanging on the walls were fake. Stephen had a great passion for the musical arts. He was an opera lover, Wagner in particular. One of his great enjoyments was attending Ring Cycle productions around the globe. His devotion to music was clearly exemplified by his generosity as a benefactor of The Music Academy of the West in Santa Barbara, CA. Many of the young musicians and singers he sponsored have gone onto become some of today's esteemed classical musical talents, including pianist Vassily Primakov and soprano Susanna Phillips, who would often come to stay, practice and perform in his Montecito home. Stephen's legacy at the Music Academy lives on in the beautiful conservatory space he endowed, Hahn Hall, completed in 2008. Stephen's achievements are a testament to his fascinating character and many qualities. His dignity and savor-faire made him preferred among dealers and clients, his intelligence, mischievous wit, and charm made him a favorite at the table. His drive and competitive spirit was manifest in his love of sports. He frequently traveled with a tennis racquet. Stephen approached life with keen observance and thoughtfulness. He was truly kind and generous and very devoted to his family. A man who once wielded substantial power in his sphere entered the twilight of his life with touching grace and a lively glint in his eye. He is predeceased by his sister Agnes Brodie, survived by his wife, Carla, his sister Suzanne, his children, Robert, Elizabeth, Thomas. Isabella and Lily, his stepchildren, Zachary, Brandon, and Katharine O'Brien, six grandchildren, a niece and a nephew. In lieu of flowers, contributions in his name may be made to; Music Academy of the West, Attention: Gift Processor, 1070 Fairway Rd, Santa Barbara, CA 93108."

Creators of reality television also favor this formula. At least eight reality fashion shows and one scripted series are in development, following on the stilettos of ''Project Runway'' and the stylist Rachel Zoe. As if to underscore the dearth of originality in the fashion world, Bravo has picked up the tentatively titled ''It's a Brad Brad World,'' based on Ms. Zoe's former assistant Brad Goreski, and ''Mad Fashion'' with Chris March, the costume designer who appeared on ''Project Runway.'' Given his fondness for cartoonish creations, and his ability to execute them, Mr. March could prove to be the Buddy Valastro of TV fashion.

Scott looks back at the trial and execution of St. Joan as recounted in the silent classic by the Danish filmmaker Carl Theodor Dreyer in “The Passion of Joan of Arc” (1928). The film is based on the transcripts from the trial and explores it from a political and religious perspective. “There’s something powerful and mysterious about beholding the image of a human face,” Mr. Scott says about the film’s use of close-ups to build a kind of spiritual intensity. The entire first half is a succession of close-ups, which, Mr. Scott says, “create a feeling of intimacy and confinement. And the drama, even the narrative itself, are contained within these faces.” The film is ultimately more concerned with emotion than politics, making it that much more of a human story. “‘The Passion of Joan of Arc’ creates an uncanny, unforgettable, almost unique sense of connection to its main character,” Mr. Scott says. “We may not ultimately understand Joan, but we know her.” Have you seen the film?

For graphic design, it’s letterpress, a labor-intensive printing process that creative types are taking up as an antidote to days spent staring at their iMacs. Produced on antique presses and characterized by heavily impressed lettering on thick paper, letterpress cards and stationery — if you’ve received a wedding invitation from an even vaguely arty couple in the past few years, chances are it was letterpress printed — are the graphic design equivalent of slow food. For designers who want to unplug, literally, letterpress is a chance to spend time refining their craft using a method that was considered old-fashioned long before the days of Photoshop. “People miss the hands-on experience of printing,” says Daniel Gardiner Morris, a fourth-generation letterpress printer and the founder of the Arm, the Williamsburg studio where many local printers have learned the basics of handling Industrial Revolution-era machinery. “Even if you don’t know anything about the process, when you pick up something that was printed on a letterpress, you know there’s something different about it. It was touched by human hands.” Here, the lowdown on five printers who are getting their fingers inky."

2011-04-12T00:00:00Z,"SHAPIRO--Lilian, W.,74, formerly of Chestnut Hill, MA, died of cancer on April 10, 2011, in New York City. She was surrounded by her loving husband, Joseph and their two children, Kenneth Shapiro of Westport, CT and Kimberly Konigsberg of NYC and their spouses. She will be deeply missed by her adoring grandchildren Alex, Andre, James and Samantha. She was also survived by her sister-in-law, Lotti Rubin, her husband and family and her devoted cousins, Nancy and Arnold Smoller and their children. Lilian was born in London, England, September 4, 1936 to Gerard and Elfreda Wolfe who emigrated from Heilbronn-Sontheim, Germany. Ultimately they settled in the United States in 1940, via Cuba and the Dominican Republic. She was raised in Brookline, MA and graduated from Beaver Country Day School, Hood College and Simmons College School of Social Work. After receiving her MSW, she was a social worker at The Massachusetts General Hospital working with burn victims and terminal pediatric cancer patients. Despite her professional accomplishments, her proudest achievement was her devotion to her family. Lilian and Joseph were married 50 years and were the best of friends. They enjoyed doing the activities they loved together: visiting with their grandchildren; traveling; appreciating art, antiques and laundry ephemera. Their last passion culminated in an exhibit, ""Blue Monday: Doing Laundry in America,"" at the National Heritage Museum in Lexington, MA in 2005. Over a thirty year period Lilian and Joe scoured flea markets and antique shows throughout the country, where Lilian was affectionately known as the ""Laundry Lady."" She was readily recognized for her Tide detergent sneakers and her yellow and red bakelite, laundry pin depicting washing implements. She was truly unique: a compassionate, elegant lady with beauty, intelligence and refined taste! A Memorial Service will be held on Friday, April 15th at 9:30am at Frank E. Campbell, 1076 Madison Avenue at 81st Street. Donations may be made in honor of Jimmie Holland, MD for the Geriatric Psychiatric Fund at Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center, 1275 York Avenue, New York, NY 10021."

Mr. Bond, 38, was a teacher and an artist; Ms. Bond, 36, worked for a real estate broker; their daughter, Sadie, had turned 1 in the fall. The last thing on their minds was cancer. Indeed, when Nathan Bond started having gastrointestinal problems last summer, he figured it might be lactose intolerance.

There is no question about the cost of discrimination to the human body: increased stressors lead to increase in illness. The remedies are clear. To begin with, let's put an end to institutionalized discrimination. Repeal laws like the Defense of Marriage Act. Lift the bans on same-sex marriage. Make it illegal to discriminate based on sexual identity, sexual orientation or gender expression in employment, housing, accommodation and credit. Our health care system can't afford it."

It is a gap on his trophy shelf that the organizers of the festival said they intended to correct at this year's celebration. Mr. Bertolucci, whose films include ''The Last Emperor,'' ''The Sheltering Sky,'' ''Little Buddha'' and ''Last Tango in Paris,'' will be given an honorary Palme d'or at the opening ceremony of this year's festival, it was announced on Monday. The festival has previously presented honorary awards to filmmakers including Woody Allen (in 2002) and Clint Eastwood (in 2009), and starting this year plans to make the distinction an annual tradition. In a statement, the festival's president, Gilles Jacob, and its director, Thierry Fremaux, cited ''the quality of his work, which appears today in all its uniqueness and the extent of this work we perceive every day more vividly'' and ''the strength of his commitment to cinema and the ties that bind him to Cannes.'' Mr. Bertolucci will receive his award at the festival's opening ceremony on May 11 from Robert De Niro, who is serving as the president of this year's jury and starred in his film ''1900.''"

On Monday the network said it would extend the running time of the April 28 episode of ''The Office,'' on which Mr. Carell bids farewell to the series, to run about 50 minutes total, including commercials; it will be followed by an extended 40-minute episode of ''Parks and Recreation,'' a regular 30-minute episode of ''30 Rock'' and zero minutes of ''Outsourced.'' Mr. Carell's character proposed to his girlfriend, Holly Flax (played by Amy Ryan), in the March 24 episode of ''The Office,'' presumably setting the stage for Michael Scott's exit. On Thursday, Will Ferrell beginsa four-episode arc on the series that includes Mr. Carell's final show, building up to a May 19 season finale filled with guest stars like Ricky Gervais and Will Arnett.

After having served as Assistant General Counsel of New York Life Insurance Company and subsequently as head of the Bureau of Real Estate Financing of the New York State Attorney General's office, Harold became our partner (recently Of Counsel) in 1980. Harold was responsible for the unprecedented growth and development of our firm's cooperative and condominium practice during which we acquired national preeminence representing the most prominent and successful cooperative/condominium developers in New York. Harold loved being a scholar and practitioner and over the course of his career published dozens of articles and treatises, became an adjunct professor at Fordham University School of Law, and Chair of the Real Property Section of the New York State Bar Association (which awarded Harold its Lifetime Professionalism Award in 2005). He was an active member of the American College of Real Estate Attorneys and the American Land Title Association and served several terms on the NYC Rent Guidelines Board. He mentored many young lawyers and was a wonderful, decent, generous, witty and warm hearted person who shared these gifts every day. He exemplified the finest of our profession.

Warner Brothers Pictures said on Sunday that Mr. Shannon, an Academy Award nominee for ''Revolutionary Road,'' will play General Zod, an evildoer who comes from Superman's home planet of Krypton. The studio said the film, whose previously announced cast includes Henry Cavill (''The Tudors'') as Superman and Amy Adams (''The Fighter'') as Lois Lane, will be titled ''Man of Steel.'' Mr. Snyder, whose previous films include ''300'' and ''Sucker Punch,'' said in a statement, ''Zod is not only one of Superman's most formidable enemies, but one of the most significant because he has insights into Superman that others don't.

He opens a kitchen in the Westwood neighborhood, above, where he intends to provide educational tools to combat obesity; he also attends a school lunch convention and is horrified to discover a seminar advocating flavored milk.

(Sunday's show included spirited tunes like ''A Hard Rain's a-Gonna Fall'' and ''Highway 61 Revisited,'' but no obvious protest songs like ''Blowin' in the Wind.'') Appearing in a performance space that could hold about 8,000 people, Mr. Dylan played to a crowd only half that size, The Associated Press said, a low turnout that could be attributed to the fact that tickets cost more than many Vietnamese make in month, or the fact that half its population is younger than 30 and has no memory of the Vietnam War era or Mr. Dylan's stature during it."

The revival, directed and choreographed by Kathleen Marshall, is now planned to play at the Stephen Sondheim Theater through January 8; it was originally scheduled to close after July 31. (That’s roughly 184 more performances of cruise-ship based musical farce, so let’s hope everyone packed some additional swim trunks.)

After numerous Google searches (no luck), inquisitive e-mails (no luck) and one (lucky) Facebook search, we found the maker of the pin: 19-year-old Taj Melendez in Brooklyn, New York. “During art class in elementary school, we would do projects like these with perler beads,” says Melendez, who, like Space Invader, the street artist with a similar aesthetic, seems to shy away from attention rather than seek it out. He made his first pin, a replica of the men’s restroom icon, when he was 16. “I just wanted to start something, I wanted to stand out.” He sells his designs — bow ties, barrettes and an assortment of brooches like a thought bubble or a football — through his Web site ($55 to $75; go to bytaj.com). “I want to keep them special — that’s why I don’t create too many too fast.” When asked how Diaconu got her hands on that darling panda face, he shrugs with disbelief. “I have no idea,” he says. “But I sure was happy.”"

In the journal Sociological Spectrum, she reports that blacks have lower rates of drug use than whites during early adolescence, but this gap gets inverted as they age. That is to say, whites are more likely to age out of drug use—they stop as they get older. Blacks, perhaps because of work, economic and family conditions, age out less, so by middle age they are using drugs more than whites. This would seem to put a dent in the theory that blacks suffer higher rates of drug use because they are more likely to grow up in single parent homes. If that were true, you’d see the effects in early adolescence. The evidence would seem to point to broader social influences."

2011-04-13T12:34:06Z,"Are bullies amoral or are they simply cruel? That is to say, do they bully others because they don’t know the difference between right and wrong, or simply because they don’t care about other people’s feelings? Gianluca Gini, Tiziana Pozzoli and Marc Hauser studied this question for the Journal Personality and Individual Differences. They studied 719 children between the ages of 9 and 13 and found that those who engaged in bullying had advanced moral competence. They could make sophisticated distinctions between moral and immoral conduct. They scored low on measures of compassion, though. This reinforces a growing body of research that suggests knowing right from wrong is not necessarily connected to behaving rightly or wrongly. Moral lectures don’t work well, but telling people stories designed to arouse compassion might."

Durra, a 34-year-old Londoner who studied film at New York University, says her own cultural influences — she’s of mixed Middle Eastern and Bosnian descent — inspired the film’s protagonist, Asya. Asya (played by the French actress Élodie Bouchez) is a downtown artist who has lumped together her Palestinian, Bosnian, Jordanian, Lebanese and Parisian heritages into some familiar Manhattan mystique."

Political bravery, in this view, requires more than just proposing a more rigorous version of your own faction’s usual proposals.

2011-04-13T00:00:00Z,"8 P.M. (Sundance) THE GIRL ON THE TRAIN (2009) An unemployed, vacant-eyed young woman (Émilie Dequenne, above left, with Catherine Deneuve) who lives with her distant mother (Ms. Deneuve) near a train track in the Paris suburbs pretends to be the victim of an anti-Semitic attack after a relationship with a thuggish athlete (Nicolas Duvauchelle) sours. This seductive drama from André Téchiné was based on the real-life case involving Marie-Léonie Leblanc, a 23-year-old who claimed in 2004 that she had been the victim of an anti-Semitic attack by six men of North African and African origin on a train outside Paris. The French president at the time, Jacques Chirac, condemned the attack, and the Israeli prime minister, Ariel Sharon, urged French Jews to leave for Israel to ''escape the wildest anti-Semitism.'' Then the woman admitted that she had lied. ''I wanted my parents to take care of me,'' she explained, ''my boyfriend to take care of me.'' Manohla Dargis, reviewing the film in The New York Times, said: ''Mr. Téchiné isn't pretending that he understands what people do. But by showing us what they do, the flowers they pick and the people they love, he makes us notice them more intently.'' 9:30 A.M. (CUNY) CITY TALK In a two-part episode about baseball, repeated at 4:30 and 9:30 p.m., Doug Muzzio interviews the journalist Jimmy Breslin about his new book, ''Branch Rickey,'' about the manager and executive who helped break the sport's color barrier by signing Jackie Robinson (above with Rickey) to the Brooklyn Dodgers in 1947. Though the biography breaks no factual ground, ''what Breslin has done, with his usual gritty perception, is revive a story of enormous consequence,'' David Oshinsky wrote in The New York Times Book Review. Rickey, ''a white man, is rarely mentioned when the great civil rights leaders are discussed. His politics were small-town Republican, his judgments often puritanical. He had numerous reasons for integrating baseball, Breslin reminds us, not all of them noble. But without his vision and persistence, civil rights may have taken an even slower, rougher path.''"

""When one of my chickadees falls from the nest,"" she said cupping her hands, ""I gently bring them back."" Even in her later years, Rose provided a joyous welcome not only to family but friends of family, young and old. A high school drop out, Rose was an enthusiastic reader and a curious traveler, accompanying family to many foreign cities. After 30 years, as a corsetiere at small specialty shops, Rose became a popular docent at the Lower East Side Tenement Museum. There, until she was 94, Rose led awed visitors through the 6 story tenement building, recalling the lives of its immigrant residents. She also volunteered at The Family Center and Coney Island Hospital. Raised by poor immigrants in Brownsville, Brooklyn, Rose moved at the age of 84 to Manhattan to be nearer her son, Herbert and his family. Calling the Upper West Side a lebedik place, she reveled in long walks along Broadway. This year, Rose moved to St. Louis where her older son, Steven and his family reside.

''I thought, nobody can tell these stories as good as I can tell them,'' said Mr. Robertson, 67, who could recall at least four previous attempts at a personal history that he halted at various stages of development. ''And it doesn't make sense for me to be going through an interpreter on this. I need to, when I'm ready, do this myself.''"

2011-04-13T00:00:00Z,"SHAPIRO--Lilian, W.,74, formerly of Chestnut Hill, MA, died of cancer on April 10, 2011, in New York City. She was surrounded by her loving husband, Joseph and their two children, Kenneth Shapiro of Westport, CT and Kimberly Konigsberg of NYC and their spouses. She will be deeply missed by her adoring grandchildren Alex, Andre, James and Samantha. She was also survived by her sister-in-law, Lotti Rubin, her husband and family and her devoted cousins, Nancy and Arnold Smoller and their children. Lilian was born in London, England, September 4, 1936 to Gerard and Elfreda Wolfe who emigrated from Heilbronn-Sontheim, Germany. Ultimately they settled in the United States in 1940, via Cuba and the Dominican Republic. She was raised in Brookline, MA and graduated from Beaver Country Day School, Hood College and Simmons College School of Social Work. After receiving her MSW, she was a social worker at The Massachusetts General Hospital working with burn victims and terminal pediatric cancer patients. Despite her professional accomplishments, her proudest achievement was her devotion to her family. Lilian and Joseph were married 50 years and were the best of friends. They enjoyed doing the activities they loved together: visiting with their grandchildren; traveling; appreciating art, antiques and laundry ephemera. Their last passion culminated in an exhibit, ""Blue Monday: Doing Laundry in America,"" at the National Heritage Museum in Lexington, MA in 2005. Over a thirty year period Lilian and Joe scoured flea markets and antique shows throughout the country, where Lilian was affectionately known as the ""Laundry Lady."" She was readily recognized for her Tide detergent sneakers and her yellow and red bakelite, laundry pin depicting washing implements. She was truly unique: a compassionate, elegant lady with beauty, intelligence and refined taste! A Memorial Service will be held on Friday, April 15th at 9:30am at Frank E.

Donations may be made in honor of Jimmie Holland, MD for the Geriatric Psychiatric Fund at Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center, 1275 York Avenue, New York, NY 10021."
2011-04-13T00:00:00Z,"It's almost enough to make you dizzy: Francis Ford Coppola announced yesterday that his Rubicon Estate, formerly known as the Niebaum-Coppola Estate, will heretofore be known as Inglenook. Say what?--Well, it actually all makes perfect sense. Inglenook, before it went to corporate brand-name heaven (or is that hell?) was the historic name of one of Napa Valley's pioneering wineries. It was founded in 1879 by Gustave Niebaum, and produced some of the greatest cabernet sauvignons in Napa history, particularly in the mid-20th century under John Daniel Jr., a grand-nephew of Niebaum. Mr. Daniel died in 1971, and eventually the winery, vineyards and Inglenook brand were sold off.--Mr. Coppola, the movie director, purchased the old Niebaum home and part of the original Inglenook vineyard in 1975. Since then, he has been trying to reconstitute the original estate. In 1995, he bought the old Inglenook winery and the remaining Inglenook vineyard, but the brand name eluded him. --The Inglenook brand, like Paul Masson, Martin Ray and other once-great California names, had sadly declined as big corporations used it for cheap factory wines. Today, most people associate it with little airline bottles rather than historic Napa wines.--But with his acquisition of the Inglenook name from the Wine Group, Mr. Coppola has succeeded in restoring the original Inglenook estate. No financial terms were disclosed. --At the same time, in an effort to return Inglenook to the top echelon of Napa wines, Mr. Coppola announced that Philippe Bascaules, the estate director at Chateau Margaux, would this summer assume the position of estate manager and winemaker at Inglenook. Mr. Bascaules has spent 21 years at Margaux, one of the five Bordeaux first growths.--While Mr. Coppola's holdings now constitute the original Inglenook estate, one remaining piece of the historic Inglenook empire, the Napanook Vineyard, lies elsewhere. Napanook was planted in 1836 by George C. Yount, for whom Yountville, Calif., is named. In 1946, Mr. Daniel, then the owner of Inglenook, bought the Napanook estate. When he died, and the remainder of Inglenook was sold off, the Napanook Vineyard remained with his daughters, Robin Lail and Marcia Smith. --In 1982, Ms. Lail and Ms. Smith teamed with Christian Moueix of Chateau Petrus to form Dominus Estate, with the Napanook Vineyard as its basis. Mr. Moueix became the full owner in 1995. -As Mr. Moueix would be the first to say, the transition from Bordeaux to Napa Valley is not simple. --''I was charmed by the beauty of the estate and its unique environment,'' Mr. Bascaules said in a statement. ''I found the tasting of 1959 Inglenook astonishing with regard to its freshness and complexity, and when I tasted some samples of the 2009 vintage, I recognized the incredible potential of this property.''--Mr. Coppola's top wine will continue to be called Rubicon. This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print."

2011-04-13T00:00:00Z,"7:56 p.m. | Updated Securities America has reached a settlement with hundreds of former clients, a deal that will require it and its parent, Ameriprise Financial, to pay approximately $180 million to people who lost money when two private placements the firm sold turned out to be frauds, according to people briefed on the agreement. The financial advisory firm notified a number of plaintiff lawyers on Tuesday that enough clients had agreed to the settlement terms to make it work, said these people, who spoke on condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to speak on the record. In late March, Securities America and lawyers representing hundreds of its clients who lost money in the private placements of Medical Capital Holdings and Provident Royalties reached an agreement that would give investors roughly 45 cents on the dollar, or almost $180 million. This settlement was much improved from a previous one that was rejected by a Dallas judge that would have left investors with about 10 cents on the dollar. In order for the richer settlement to go through, however, the vast majority of the claimants had to sign on. Specifically, if clients in arbitration with claims totaling more than $5 million or clients in a class action with combined claims totally $10 million said no, there would be no settlement, according to the people familiar with the terms of settlement. The value of the claims outstanding is roughly $145 million, these people said. Securities America and Ameriprise did not immediately respond to requests for comment. The deadline for clients to sign on was Sunday -- and the vast majority of clients agreed to the settlement."

Jacobs Theater, with previews beginning Sept. 22 and opening Oct. 13; Kenny Leon, a Tony Award nominee for last year’s revival of “Fences,” will direct. Halle Berry, who was supposed to play Camae, a hotel maid at the Lorraine Motel in Memphis in Ms. Hall’s imagined account of the night before Dr. King’s assassination, will not be participating in the production as had been anticipated. In a statement, producers said “Ms. Berry would not be appearing in the role due to child custody issues,” and that an actor for the role “will be announced shortly.” “The Mountaintop,” which made its debut in London in 2009, won Ms. Hall the Olivier Award for best new play last year. The play is produced by Jean Doumanian Productions, Sonia Friedman Productions, Ambassador Theater Group, Jerry Frankel, Ted Snowdon, Bob Bartner and Tom Wirtshafter."

The Bulls captured championships in the five other seasons they captured at least 60 wins. Those teams were all led by Jordan. Derrick Rose, who will probably become the league’s youngest M.V.P. winner and would be a college senior at Memphis had he stayed, leads one of the N.B.A.’s most balanced rosters, anchored by the solid defenders Joakim Noah and Luol Deng under the first-year coach Tom Thibodeau. Indiana faces long odds in trying to become the fourth team to beat a top seeded team. The Pacers are in the playoffs for the first time in five years and are the only qualifiers with a losing record, but can still be considered a mild threat. They rallied after firing Jim O’Brien and attaching Frank Vogel as interim coach. Danny Granger is one of the league’s quality wing players, Darren Collison is one of the league’s quickest point guards and the center Roy Hibbert provides scoring and length."

Film purists are likely to howl, and the majority of movie theaters don't have compatible projection equipment. On Monday Mr. Jackson caused a stir in cinema geek circles by announcing (via Facebook) that he is shooting ''The Hobbit'' at 48 frames per second, or twice the normal rate. Mr. Cameron has also been promoting use of the faster speed for his next two ''Avatar'' movies. Both men say that shooting at 48 frames per second makes a movie look more lifelike and lessens the eye strain that can come from 3-D presentation."

2011-04-14T00:00:00Z,"When thinking about the candidates for the 2012 Republican nomination, we can divide them into basically three groups. First are candidates in a group I'd call the Fairfax Five, Fairfax being the name of a wealthy Washington suburb in Northern Virginia. These are the candidates who have the seal of approval of the Republican establishment thinkers in Washington. More specifically, they're the candidates endorsed by George F. Will in his March 5 column:There are at most five plausible Republican presidents on the horizon -- Indiana Gov. Mitch Daniels, Mississippi Gov. Haley Barbour, former Utah governor and departing ambassador to China Jon Huntsman, former Massachusetts governor Mitt Romney and former Minnesota governor Tim Pawlenty.These candidates are playing it by the book, hiring staff and developing campaign infrastructures. They get more attention in the mainstream media than in the blogosphere. They are perceived as being electable and holding some reasonable appeal to independent voters -- although I think Haley Barbour, with his track record as a lobbyist and a history of having made what are perceived to be racially insensitive remarks -- is a questionable case."

Sidney Harman endowed the Harman Writer-in-Residence Program in the Weissman School of Arts and Sciences, and through it exposed thousands of Baruch College students to the wisdom and creativity of world class authors such as Edward Albee and Francine Prose. He was a member of Baruch College's ""17 Lex Society"" and was awarded an honorary Doctor of Humane Letters degree by the College in 2009. Harman's career spanned the arts, business, and public affairs like no other alumnus since our namesake, Bernard M. Baruch. He was the founder and chairman emeritus of Harman International Industries; he purchased ""Newsweek"" last year and later merged it with ""The Daily Beast."" The former Assistant Secretary of Commerce for Technology was a generous philanthropist and a friend to the arts. He gave millions to education, the performing and fine arts and other philanthropies. His transformative gift allowed the Shakespeare Theatre Company in Washington, D.C. to construct the Harman Center for the Arts. Harman liked to quote Maxwell Anderson who wrote, ""It is for our arts that we will be remembered."" Sidney Harman will be remembered for this and much more. Mitchel B.

A committed philanthropist, he believed in bringing opportunity and enrichment, especially to young people. He played golf with only a three handicap, sang with passion (if not perfection), and never, ever stopped moving. At 92, he embarked on entirely new careers as publisher of Newsweek Magazine and founder of the University of Southern California's Academy for Polymathic Studies.

2011-04-15T16:50:33Z,"This was one of those magical weeks of bedtime reading, when the house got perfectly quiet and my books got very loud and I ended up staying up until 2 in the morning just about every night. I was reading: a big, heavy, three-volume hardcover edition of Samuel Johnson’s “Lives of the Poets”; a newfangled iPhone essay (with pictures, audio, etc.) about ants called “Before the Swarm”; “Father and Son,” Edmund Gosse’s 1907 memoir about growing up with evangelical Christian parents (this was also on my iPhone, via the less high-tech Project Gutenberg); and an advance copy of Nicholson Baker’s erotic fantasy novel “House of Holes: A Book of Raunch.” (This won’t be published until August, but — hoo-boy, people, get ready for this book. It is going to be Talked About. There will be fistfights in the hallways of your local public library. I keep describing it to people as “porny Alice in Wonderland” — an impossible combination of crazy, cheerful imagination and industrial-grade filth. It made me hoot out loud every other page or so, and on a few occasions my mouth actually, literally dropped open. Just get ready.)"

The O.E.D. tells me “hench” is derived from a word for “horse.”) More recently he was Qaddafi’s foreign minister and, toward the end, fear almost shaded into pity as an increasingly desperate looking Koussa tried to convey Libyan policy — that is, to explain the unexplainable."

Just 3.3 million viewers tuned in to the premiere of “The Paul Reiser Show” at 8:30 p.m., according to Nielsen’s estimates. The new series faces considerable odds, coming after NBC’s similarly ratings-starved sitcom “Community” (3.5 million), at 8 p.m., and occupying a time slot otherwise dominated by “American Idol” on Fox. For the night, NBC ranked a distant third, garnering its best ratings at 9 p.m. for “The Office” (7.7 million), which featured a guest appearance from Will Ferrell. Fox led the night with 21 million viewers tuning for an elimination episode of “Idol” and 11.9 million at 9 p.m. for “Bones.” CBS placed second, despite broadcasting a line-up of all repeats. ABC was fourth, finishing close behind NBC with reruns from 9 to 11 p.m. following a new episode of “Wipeout” at 8 (6.2 million)."

Everything else is murky and vaguely sinister: where they come from, who dug them up and under what conditions, and, more particularly, if they reek of evil. A diamond isn’t like fur, which can’t do much to hide its origins. But there is a lurking suspicion that, like the gold of the Nibelungs, no good can come from this bright rock. It doesn’t help that the one word that rushes unbidden to stand next to diamond is blood. Diamonds are guilty until proven innocent."

On May 2, when Daphne Guinness climbs into a window at Barneys New York to prepare for the Costume Institute gala that evening at the Metropolitan Museum of Art, I hope I have my own frock ready so I can go and watch. Do I think my friend is nutty? Yes, a little. Brave, definitely.

Christopher was born September 4, 1953 in Seattle, WA, son of Elsa (Colby) Morley and the late Ralph Morley. In addition to his wife, Christopher is survived by his son Christopher Morley, Jr., New Haven, CT; mother Elsa (Los Angeles), and brother Ralph (Los Angeles). He became a member of Leone's extended family, who he cherished and who greatly miss him as well. Christopher had been employed in the area of fixed income as a trader or salesperson by several Wall Street firms from 1984-2002. He retired in 2002 to pursue real estate and investment interests. During the past nine years he also became a self-taught architect, horticulturalist, artist, dog trainer, and wine connoisseur, among other hobbies. Christopher touched the lives of many through his community service and philanthropy. His work with the Falls Village Children's Theatre, animal rescue, and D.M. Hunt Library were especially important to him. For the many friends and family members who were blessed to have had Christopher as a part of their lives he will be remembered as an inspirational role model, avid conversationalist, and tireless communicator. (Just do not play poker with him!) His sense of humor, keen intellect, and kindness will be dearly missed. Above all else Christopher will be remembered for taking the time to use his many talents to help others. A Celebration of Christopher's life will be held in Falls Village at the convenience of the family. Memorial donations may be sent to the Falls Village Children's Theater (25 Deer Rd, Falls Village, CT 06031) or the Little Guild of St. Francis Animal Shelter (285 Sharon Goshen Tpke, Cornwall, CT 06796). Services under the care of the Newkirk-Palmer Funeral Home, 118 Main St., North Canaan, CT 06018."
2011-04-15T00:00:00Z,"Broadway's revival of ''Anything Goes'' won't be going anywhere any time soon. On Wednesday, Roundabout Theater Company announced that its production of that Cole Porter musical, starring Sutton Foster as the evangelizing nightclub singer Reno Sweeney and Joel Grey as the milquetoast gangster Moonface Martin, will extend its run by about six months. The revival, directed and choreographed by Kathleen Marshall, is now planned to play at the Stephen Sondheim Theater through January 8; it was originally scheduled to close after July 31. (That's roughly 184 more performances of cruise-ship based musical farce, so let's hope everyone packed some additional swim trunks.) Reviewing this production of ''Anything Goes'' for The New York Times, Ben Brantley wrote that it ''exudes the effervescence of a freshly poured gin fizz,'' adding that when Ms. Foster ''turns her toothy, triumphant smile on the audience there's no doubt that she's made many converts.'' This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print."

2011-04-15T00:00:00Z,"We're still not entirely sure what Terrence Malick's generational drama ''The Tree of Life'' will be, but we can safely say that it will be one of 19 new films contending for the Palme d'or at the Cannes Film Festival that were announced by the festival's organizers on Thursday. Also on the feature competition slate for this year's festival, which runs from May 11 to 22, are Pedro Almodovar's ''La Piel Que Habito'' (''The Skin I Live In''), starring Antonio Banderas as a plastic surgeon seeking his daughter's rapists; ''We Need to Talk About Kevin,'' a drama directed by Lynne Ramsay (''Morvern Callar'') and starring Tilda Swinton and John C. Reilly; ''Melancholia,'' from the Danish filmmaker Lars Von Trier (''Antichrist''); ''Sleeping Beauty,'' from the novelist turned first-time filmmaker Julia Leigh; and ''Ichimei'' (''Hara-Kiri: Death of a Samurai'') from the Japanese director Takashi Miike. The festival's opening night film, which is not shown in competition, is Woody Allen's ''Midnight in Paris.'' Other features that will be shown out of competition this year include ''Pirates of the Caribbean: On Stranger Tides,'' directed by Rob Marshall, and, just to make things interesting, Jodie Foster's latest film, ''The Beaver,'' starring Mel Gibson. This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print."
2011-04-15T00:00:00Z,"HARMAN--Sidney. The family of Sidney Harman sadly confirms his death on April 12th. Born August 5, 1918, he died after 92 and a half remarkable years. Loving husband to Jane. Father to Lynn, Barbara, Gina, Paul, Daniel, and Justine Harman. Step-father to Brian Frank and Hilary Peck. Father-in-law to Bill Cain, Nicole Harman, Philip Coltoff, Andrew Peck, and Lauren Frank. Grandfather to Megan Quitkin, Molly Small, Rachel Quitkin (Dan Smulian), Julia Cain, Isabel Cain, Grace Harman, Jake Harman, Lucy Peck, Will Frank and Henry Peck. The world was a richer place because of him. An audio pioneer, he brought music to the American home as no one had before. An avid believer in human rights, he marched with Rev. King, supported Eugene McCarthy in 1968, joined the Cabinet of President Jimmy Carter, and worked tirelessly to build a better, safer, more humane world for everyone. A committed philanthropist, he believed in bringing opportunity and enrichment, especially to young people. He played golf with only a three handicap, sang with passion (if not perfection), and never, ever stopped moving. At 92, he embarked on entirely new careers as publisher of Newsweek Magazine and founder of the University of Southern California's Academy for Polymathic Studies. A wonderfully unique individual whose passions were many, and whose love of life was ferocious in its intensity, he is, and will be, sorely missed."

Over the last 43 years, Mrs. Fierstein devoted her time, spirit and energy to AHRC New York City and NYSARC Inc. A past president of the New York City Chapter, Blanche held various Board Officer positions over the years, and served on and chaired several Board Committees. She was a member of the NYSARC Inc., Board of Governors and the President of NYSARC Inc., for thirteen years. Blanche was an eloquent, inspirational and outspoken advocate for individuals with developmental disabilities. She was a parent advocate who spoke from the heart as only a parent can. But she was also a consummate professional in the field, holding the position of Principal of the DOE's Queens OTC for many years. Her knowledge, her teaching skills and her ability to ""tell it like it is"" with candor and wit made her a figure that was well respected by Governors, legislators and government officials. Blanche was married to the late Eugene Fierstein and lived in Woodmere New York. She is survived by her daughter Andrea who resides in an AHRC Nassau group residence, her son Richard, daughter-in-law Penny and grandchildren Russell, Leigh and Jason, Lorie, David and Keith.

2011-04-15T00:00:00Z,"No. 1 Chicago Bulls (62-20) vs. No. 8 Indiana Pacers (37-45)The Bulls finished with 62 wins, the most since Michael Jordan left the organization. The Bulls captured championships in the five other seasons they captured at least 60 wins. Those teams were all led by Jordan. Derrick Rose, who will probably become the league's youngest M.V.P. winner and would be a college senior at Memphis had he stayed, leads one of the N.B.A.'s most balanced rosters, anchored by the solid defenders Joakim Noah and Luol Deng under the first-year coach Tom Thibodeau. Indiana faces long odds in trying to become the fourth team to beat a top seeded team. The Pacers are in the playoffs for the first time in five years and are the only qualifiers with a losing record, but can still be considered a mild threat. They rallied after firing Jim O'Brien and attaching Frank Vogel as interim coach. Danny Granger is one of the league's quality wing players, Darren Collison is one of the league's quickest point guards and the center Roy Hibbert provides scoring and length. No. 2 Miami Heat (58-24) vs. Philadelphia 76ers (41-41)Miami, the team that celebrated in the summer when it created a stir about free agency and power teams, enters its first playoff in the LeBron James-Dwyane Wade-Chris Bosh era as an unknown. Will Miami be the team that dominated in winning 21 of 22 games in one stretch or the one that went 3-8 against Boston, Orlando and Chicago and failed to close late games? Like the Knicks, they have enough stars to win a series when all else goes wrong. The Heat experienced its regular season under the microscope, a lens that will only increase as the playoffs advance. The workman-like 76ers are coached by Doug Collins, who revitalized the franchise in his first year. They spread the offense and the responsibilities. Elton Brand is the team's leading scorer with 15.1 points per game. Brand's average ranked 48th in the N.B.A. Philadelphia's bid at an upset will also be hurt if the valuable reserve Louis Williams (strained hamstring) is not healthy. No. 3 Boston Celtics (56-26) vs. No. 6 Knicks (42-40)The Celtics went a pedestrian 15-12 to end the season after trading their defensive anchor and eternal scowler Kendrick Perkins and showed signs of age, boredom and contentment. Sound familiar? With the same issues (minus Perkins's departure) facing Boston last season in a 27-27 finish to their season, Boston rallied and forced the Lakers to seven games in the finals. The Celtics are again tempting that fine line a team loaded with experience and one that can hold a joint retirement party after the playoffs. Even so, the Celtics handled the Knicks in all four of their meetings this year, including twice since the All-Star Game break. The Knicks hopes lie in Carmelo Anthony, Amar'e Stoudemire and Chauncey Billups all catching fire at least four times in seven games. The Celtics offer the Knicks mismatches. For example, if Mike D'Antoni chooses to guard Rajon Rondo with Landry Fields or Toney Douglas instead of Billups, will Billups be up to chasing the sharpshooter Ray Allen through the myriad of screens that Boston will set? Shaquille O'Neal, who will be available after missing chunks of the season with right leg injuries, also poses another challenge that the Knicks simply cannot match."

A late six-game losing streak is deceptive because Gregg Popovich began resting his players. There are two main differences in the Spurs' improvement: their health, an issue in the last two postseasons, held up through the regular season; and Tony Parker and Manu Ginobili can strike fear in any opposing coach. But Ginobili hyperextended his right elbow in the season finale Wednesday night and could be limited. The Spurs are less defensive-orientated and ran more on offense this season to a tune of 103.7 points a game. Tim Duncan is no longer the offensive focal point and averaged a career-low 13.4 points, but is still effective enough to lure double teams. Memphis scored a league-high 51.6 points in the post and its interior size of Zach Randolph and Marc Gasol should pose problems for San Antonio. Memphis will play without its injured star, Rudy Gay, who partially separated his left shoulder Feb. 15. On defense, Memphis is scrappy and averaged a league-high 9.4 steals."

''When the truth about Sunnyside is revealed, the movie has fun evoking prison escape pictures and horror films, darkening the Pixar palette to captivating (and, to some small children, possibly frightening) effect.'' Ultimately, this three-film, 15-year epic ''about the adventures of a bunch of silly plastic junk turns out also to be a long, melancholy meditation on loss, impermanence and that noble, stubborn, foolish thing called love,'' Mr. Scott added.

(Apologies to Mr. Sendak and ''In the Night Kitchen.'') Mr. Sendak, the children's author and opera designer, hasn't made a career of monumental wall works, but in 1961 he spent months painting a children's-bedroom mural for his friends Lionel and Roslyn Chertoff, a parade-like tableau with a lion and a top-hatted bear and a dog that looks exactly like the white terrier he would later subject to pursuit by a little boy with a fork in ''Where the Wild Things Are.''

Jack Richter, a Los Angeles Police Department spokesman, was quoted as having said, ''We respect the rights to have an art exhibition, but we demand the security of other people's property.''"

Deciding to throw that dirty makeup towel on the floor of the hotel bathroom, despite the card detailing the environmental consequences of your wanton gesture in three languages? An ethical conundrum that can sully a whole day (or at least a morning). But slathering your visage with the wholesome-est creams, bedecking yourself in the finest ancient gems and even brooking controversy by maybe daring to don a few vintage pelts, all in service of saving, celebrating - even worshiping - the earth? Simple. It's already the second decade of the new century, and we are dealing with style questions, ethical and otherwise, that would have bedeviled our chic ancestors. We may pay lip service to sustainability and strive for a toddler-size carbon footprint, but who among us is considering the environment when our cupboards are stuffed with nonbiodegradable synthetic Marc Jacobs fetish frocks, shiny plastic Balenciaga houndstooth-check spring coats and truckloads of industrial-strength Spanx made of who knows what mysterious chemical compound? Not to mention the sheer quantities of merchandise that languish in our armoires, living as we do in a time when 30 pairs of shoes don't raise an eyebrow, instead of the measly two (or maybe three or four, if they were really prosperous) that our forebears made do with."
2011-04-17T00:00:00Z,"First, some fashion news. Having just spent a month watching the runways, I am certain of one thing: if you are a female reader of this magazine, you will need, by fall, to be in possession of a dress, a frock, with proper sleeves and a hemline that hovers at the knees. It can be bohemian or ''Seven Sisters''; it can be cut from wool or silk or some indefinable double-faced, techno synthetic. But whatever the particulars, you will wear it everywhere and feel ageless and glamorous along the way. In this issue, Angelo Pennetta and Robbie Spencer offer four terrific options from the prefall collections on Page 78; why not be an early adapter? Spencer is also the fashion editor behind Richard Burbridge's extraordinary fantasia of ''green'' beauty and fine jewelry, ''A Diamond in the Roughage'' (Page 66). We started discussing this story last October, and the concept was straightforward: to look gorgeous you don't need science, you need Mother Nature. Lynn Yaeger penned a timely and hilarious piece; and Spencer, Burbridge, Chanel's Peter Philips, Martin Cullen and the set guru Gary Card went to work to turn the model Tati into a thoroughly modern vision worthy of Arcimboldo.

2011-04-17T00:00:00Z,"Cate Blanchett and I are trying to determine whether she's a fake - or whether she's merely as hidden from herself as she seems to be hidden from strangers who would like to capture her essence over breakfast at the Chateau Marmont, tape recorder and pen at the ready. It's the Sunday morning of the Oscars when Blanchett and I meet, and there's a slight fizz of anticipation in the Los Angeles air, a kind of hometown pride that one senses. There have been soirees and private parties going on since Friday night, but in the restaurant at the Marmont everything is calm, cool and collected. The Marmont, I decide, is too hip to be excited, which is probably why Blanchett has elected to stay here with her friend, the makeup artist Jeanine Lobell (creator of Stila), instead of at the Beverly Hills Hotel, where she was initially booked. When she walks in at 10:10, all in black, except for her bright blond crown of boyishly cut hair, no one so much as looks up from their conversation. Then again, despite her singular beauty, she's simply not the kind of actress who begs to be stared at, who enters places with that ''I am somebody'' awareness of herself that demands attention. She's a dignified, pre-red-carpet star caught in a celebrity-tweeting culture, with the result that she's learned how to promote her role of the moment - in this instance, that of a ruthless C.I.A. agent in the thriller ''Hanna,'' directed by Joe Wright - without seeming to be promoting anything, least of all herself. I dutifully bring up the subject of the film and mention that I found it beautiful looking but disappointing. Blanchett says she took ''Hanna'' on ''because it was the best first 20 pages of any script I'd read - brutal, terrifying and suspenseful.'' And then she's happy to move on to other matters. It's an art all its own, this straining toward the shadows of self-effacement when you've been shoved into the limelight, there's no doubt about that. Blanchett is whippet thin and wearing black jeans with a black Gaultier jacket (this much she will divulge) with what she describes as a ''wispy, lacy quelque chose'' underneath. Her face is bare of makeup except for perhaps a smidgen of mascara, and she wears no jewelry save for a striking onyx and gold ring. Her nails are unmanicured, which on her looks like the last word in efficient chic, and I suddenly find myself wondering why I bother with a weekly polish. Mostly, though, I find myself staring at her skin, which has been justifiably much-commented on by interviewers and is, perhaps, the most divalike thing about her: luminous and poreless and the color of a pale peach. Second only to her skin is her bone structure, which is a gift from the gods, and then come her eyes, which are a piercing blue-gray with tiny pupils. Not to mention her generous, mobile mouth. Together these visual assets can be played up or played down, depending on the maquillage - depending, indeed, on whether she wears so much as a dab of lipstick - which is why Blanchett can look alternately wanly attractive, as she does in the 2005 Australian indie film ''Little Fish,'' playing a troubled woman trying to rise above her past, or undeniably stunning, as she does later that night when presenting an Oscar for best costume and makeup, dressed in a haute couture Givenchy gown (one of two gowns that she chose between) that made everyone else look tacky."

Organized by Venus X Iceberg (nee Jazmin Venus Soto), it serves as home base to many recently emerged hybrid rave/hip-hop genres. Soto is also producing a documentary called ''Shakedown.'' Reminiscent of the '90s cult film ''Paris Is Burning,'' it traces the intricacies of black lesbian subculture in Los Angeles. Notably, Soto keeps her love of underground and subculture balanced. As a D.J., she has gained notoriety by mixing news clips from Al Jazeera in with her beats - during a New York Fashion Week gig, she interspersed coverage from the Egyptian revolution.

''Is that really double-knit?'' one observer whispered of a black wool suit consisting of skinny flared trousers, a hip-length narrow-lapeled jacket and a long fitted vest that could serve as a minidress to nouveau Twiggys. The 24-look collection includes a black wool sateen dress accented with a Peter Pan collar, a handmade lace widow skirt and a saffron printed pantsuit based on Sizzi's sketch of a Baroque cathedral ceiling. The shoes - velvet, satin and felt wedges and heels (all vegan, to match the 33-year-old's lifestyle) in salmon, saffron and cardinal red - attest to what Sizzi learned while working as an accessories designer at Gucci, Calvin Klein and Donna Karan. Clever '60s proportions and mod collaborations with the milliner Patricia Underwood and the jeweler Thomas Bliven add a bit of nonecclesiastical zing. From $435 at Barneys New York.

He set up Brian Gionta for the game's only two goals and made dangerous rushes and good defensive reads all night."

2011-04-17T00:00:00Z,"Nothing says summer like this vivid and versatile hue. Luckily, there's a shade for everyone. Evocative of beachy sunsets, warm-weather cocktails and juicy, just-picked strawberries, the color pink is a virtual harbinger of summer delights. As things heat up this season, a rich, rosy pout is practically mandatory. ''We saw a lot of pink, from deep to bright, on the runways, and it's definitely the statement to make on lips right now,'' says Francois Nars, the founder and creative director of Nars Cosmetics. He equates choosing the right shade with picking any accessory: ''Go with what you're attracted to. Blue-based pinks will brighten any complexion, but it's ultimately more important to select a shade that suits your style, one you feel comfortable with.''A bit of daring can pay off. ''With a shocking or bright hue, teeth appear brighter, as do the whites of eyes,'' Nars says."

In 1973, he was the Democratic candidate for Supreme Court in the 9th Judicial District. He also ran as the Democratic candidate for New York State Senate from Yonkers and for Westchester County District Attorney. Mickey was actively involved in community and civic affairs.

Everything else is murky and vaguely sinister: where they come from, who dug them up and under what conditions, and, more particularly, if they reek of evil. A diamond isn't like fur, which can't do much to hide its origins. But there is a lurking suspicion that, like the gold of the Nibelungs, no good can come from this bright rock. It doesn't help that the one word that rushes unbidden to stand next to diamond is blood. Diamonds are guilty until proven innocent. That is why Robert Keith and Kether Parker, the men behind Hoorsenbuhs, the Los Angeles-based jewelry line, and I are flying over the northern Kalahari Desert on our way to De Beers's huge Orapa diamond mine in Botswana along with several executives of the company. We are looking for the good diamond, which is to say a diamond unstained by the haunting images of civil wars in places like Angola, Liberia and Sierra Leone. Rival militias, their ranks filled with children, tore one another to pieces. The carnage was often paid for by diamonds dug from the local hills and rivers by so-called artisanal miners with hand tools. These ''blood diamonds'' amounted to a very small portion of the overall trade, but they seeped into the general pool and implicated all diamonds by association.

(Boston and Philadelphia, we're talking about you.) But the stores, stands and bars around the new Yankee Stadium, now in its third season, can still rely on plenty of household names to lure fans. There's Jeter, of course, and Rodriguez and Rivera. There are the long-gone greats as well -- Ruth, Mantle, DiMaggio, to name a few -- immortalized in the record books and at the stadium. The pinstripes for the current and former players are the same; only the numbers vary. But for Yankees fans, one number is in greater demand than all the rest: champion- ship No. 28. JOSEPH PLAMBECK"

(HBO) GAME OF THRONES A cast of seemingly hundreds -- kings and queens, knights and renegades, liars and noblemen -- vie for power in the Seven Kingdoms of Westeros in this adaptation of ''A Song of Ice and Fire,'' the fantasy book series by George R. R. Martin. Filmed in Northern Ireland and Malta, the story unfolds as King Robert Baratheon (Mark Addy) asks Lord Eddard Stark (Sean Bean, above) to help run his kingdom after the death of his right-hand man. Meanwhile, Princess Daenerys (Emilia Clarke) and her brother, Viserys (Harry Lloyd), whose family once ruled the kingdoms, are threatening the throne from the east. At the same time, in the north, Jon Snow (Kit Harington), Stark's illegitimate son, has joined the brotherhood of the Night's Watch, sworn protectors of the kingdoms. '' 'Game of Thrones' serves up a lot of confusion in the name of no larger or really relevant idea beyond sketchily fleshed-out notions that war is ugly, families are insidious and power is hot,'' Ginia Bellafante wrote in The New York Times, praising by comparison series like ''The Sopranos,'' ''The Wire'' and ''Deadwood.'' ''If you are not averse to the Dungeons & Dragons aesthetic, the series might be worth the effort. If you are nearly anyone else, you will hunger for HBO to get back to the business of languages for which we already have a dictionary.'' 10 A.M.

In this fame-crazed, multiplatform era, when a person can at any embarrassing moment find herself on YouTube or Flickr, you'd expect fashionable women to insist on patterns that scale well - from iPhone to Imax. But just look at Comme des Garcons' adorably demented half-gray jacket. The half that isn't gray shimmers with blue-and-white pajama stripes that will turn you into a walking moire effect on Facebook. Or imagine, for the moment, some celebrity braving the red carpet in one of Prada's graphic striped shifts, many framed with baroque flourishes of monkeys and bananas.

An impeccably researched history of the manner in which the dauphine-turned-queen used her clothing to manipulate her fate, daring the French population to simultaneously loathe and respect her, the book is a defiant rebuttal of plainness, of the drab and dreary. What would she wear today? A white Prada capelet detailed with blue monkeys? A neon poppy trench coat by Zac Posen? An operatically ruffled silk blouse by Oscar de la Renta? These are the designers you visit again and again when you need some ego-propping flash and dazzle. But what about the designers whose clothes don't shout? Rather, they murmur at the back of the closet, not begging to be worn - because they will be worn until threadbare."

And thanks to social networking components, users' shopping predilections will be broadcast to the world, allowing anyone to become a trendsetter. To kick-start the process, Motilo's chief executive, Sofia Barattieri di San Pietro, commissioned a bevy of pretty young ''It'' girls and stylists, including Valentine Fillol-Cordier, Anna Dello Russo and the D.J. Bip Ling, to share their picks with Motilo's users. ''Soon we want to involve different women, with different backgrounds, ages and charisma,'' Barattieri says. ''It is only the beginning.'' Above, Fillol-Cordier wears a Carven silk-bourette pantsuit and a Lanvin brushed-satin floral brooch, all available at Motilo.com. At age 27, Fillol-Cordier, a Paris-born beauty and stylist who contributes to hip magazines like Dazed and Confused, is already a major force in the fashion world. In addition to consulting and acting as contributing editor to the fashion and culture magazine Dossier, in her free time Fillol-Cordier models for some of the most respected photographers in the industry, having appeared in Purple, Elle and Teen Vogue. Recently she's started contributing to the new social shopping destination Motilo.com, where she shares her personal style and expertise with the site's users."

2011-04-18T12:28:09Z,"My column today includes an estimate, taken from this Congressional Budget Office report, of what a median-income family would pay in taxes over the next few decades under the “current law baseline” — a scenario in which tax rates rise fast enough to cover the budget deficit without any kind of entitlement reform. The median income figure the C.B.O. used (see Table 4-4 on p. 65 of the report) is $94,900 for a family of four, which (as a number of readers have noted) seems much higher than the usual estimates for median income in a four-person household. It turns out that I didn’t catch a crucial footnote in the C.B.O. document: “All income is assumed to be from compensation, which includes employment-based health insurance and the employer’s share of payroll taxes.” That is to say, the $94,900 in income includes the estimated value of the median family’s health care plan as well as their salary, which is not what most people think of when they hear the term “median income.” I apologize for the confusion."

At first read, what it says doesn’t seem too silly: it lays stress, rightly, on political gridlock. The point should be that the US is perfectly capable both of running large deficits now and getting its fiscal house in order over time; but not if the parties cannot agree on any kind of solution. What we do to spending this year or next is irrelevant."

Dreamed up by Mr. Whedon, his brothers Zack and Jed, and Maurissa Tancharoen during the 2007-8 writers’ strike and produced on his own dime, it is the pure expression of what they wanted to make at the time, without any outside interference."

This was not no one, but it wasn’t a tremendous number of people either.

One of the seven children of David and Sarah Isacowitz, she was born on March 17, 1912 and attended Erasmus Hall, the Palm Beach Academy, and Skidmore College. In 1932 she married Jack Blumberg, son of Max and Lena Blumberg. Their honeymoon of four months in Europe, North Africa and the Middle East, was the first of many travels. Residing in Hewlett Harbor, Long Island, and later in Manhattan and Palm Beach, she expressed her creative gifts as a sculptor, painter, gardener, and floral arranger, for which she won several tricolors. After the untimely loss of her husband in 1970, she married Joseph Rose and later Irving Holland, who predeceased her. She was truly a matriarch within her family, providing leadership, encouragement, sound values, a nobility of spirit, humor, the appreciation of music and art, and a love of family that was still evident in her last hours when she blessed her three sons. She is survived by sons Thomas A. Blumberg, Max Blumberg, and David Blumberg, daughter-in-law Lanie Leviton Blumberg, grandchildren Betsy Blumberg Watson (Doug), Karen Blumberg Shaevitz (Jonathon), Ben Blumberg (Sue), Kenneth Blumberg (Alissa) and Jennifer Gersten, great-grandchildren Emily, Rachel and Caroline Watson, Jack and Rebecca Shaevitz, Sam and Lena Blumberg, Jesse and Jordana Blumberg, her beloved sister Shirley Leviton, and many dear nieces and nephews.

Though we wouldn’t hold out much hope for the Dude’s Creedence cassettes, Mr. Bridges’s album is planned for a late summer release."

Around the same period, I also stopped watching “One Life to Live” regularly, following the heart transplant that Victoria Lord Riley Burke Riley Buchanan Buchanan Carpenter Davidson received thanks to the untimely death of the love of her life and sixth husband, Ben, who lay comatose in a hospital bed for months after being accidentally shot in the head during an attempt to save Viki from a kidnapper.

One of the seven children of David and Sarah Isacowitz, she was born on March 17, 1912 and attended Erasmus Hall, the Palm Beach Academy, and Skidmore College. In 1932 she married Jack Blumberg, son of Max and Lena Blumberg. Their honeymoon of four months in Europe, North Africa and the Middle East, was the first of many travels. Residing in Hewlett Harbor, Long Island, and later in Manhattan and Palm Beach, she expressed her creative gifts as a sculptor, painter, gardener, and floral arranger, for which she won several tricolors. After the untimely loss of her husband in 1970, she married Joseph Rose and later Irving Holland, who predeceased her. She was truly a matriarch within her family, providing leadership, encouragement, sound values, a nobility of spirit, humor, the appreciation of music and art, and a love of family that was still evident in her last hours when she blessed her three sons. She is survived by sons Thomas A. Blumberg, Max Blumberg, and David Blumberg, daughter-in-law Lanie Leviton Blumberg, grandchildren Betsy Blumberg Watson (Doug), Karen Blumberg Shaevitz (Jonathon), Ben Blumberg (Sue), Kenneth Blumberg (Alissa) and Jennifer Gersten, great-grandchildren Emily, Rachel and Caroline Watson, Jack and Rebecca Shaevitz, Sam and Lena Blumberg, Jesse and Jordana Blumberg, her beloved sister Shirley Leviton, and many dear nieces and nephews.

Burris, M.D., died peacefully in her sleep and surrounded by family on April 16 after a long and difficult illness. Formerly of White Plains, New York, she was, for the past ten years, a full-time resident and devoted community leader in her much beloved Town of Madison, Connecticut where she spent her happiest days with family and friends. Ruth received her Bachelor of Arts degree from Mount Holyoke College and her Master's Degree from Manhattanville College. She began her professional career as a teacher in the Newton, Massachusetts public school system. Later, after raising her children, she served as an addiction and alcoholism counselor for the State of New York and then went on to support her husband's medical practice as his office manager. She was best known, however, as a steadfast and spirited community leader. Initially supporting her children, she was actively involved in their school districts and served in such capacities as Girl Scout Leader and PTA President. Later, she dedicated herself to the White Plains Hospital Auxiliary in a variety of chairman and officer positions including the Presidency and, as such, held a seat on the Hospital's Board of Directors. She served for four years as Representative of the Northern Metropolitan Region for the Healthcare Association of New York State Committee on Healthcare Auxiliaries and also gave of her time to the YMCA of Central and Northern Westchester, where she was honored with the Community Service Award in 2001. She continued her community work in Madison, serving as President of the Board of Directors for the Madison Ambulance Association; a member of the Board of Directors, Long Range Planning Committee, and the Millennium Fund for the E.C. Scranton Memorial Library; the Board of Directors and Building Committee for the Senior Citizens Commission; Zoning Board of Appeals for the Town of Madison; Board of Corporators and Development Committee for Middlesex Hospital; Treasurer of the Madison Winter Club; as well as Tennis Chair, Follies Chair and Follies Business Manager for the Madison Beach Club, where she was honored to hold the position of Governor for many years.

Kisco, NY, James Burris, III (Erin) of Madison, Sara Libonati (Andrew) of Ridgefield, CT and Raymond Burris (Sonia) of New York City. She is also survived by nine grandchildren: Lauren and Katie Lombardi, Jack and Julia Desmarais, James and Jennie Burris, Elisabeth and Andrew Libonati and Raymond Burris II, all of whom brought her tremendous joy. In addition, she is survived by her sister Joan Twiss (Robert) of Craftsbury Common, VT, her brother-in-law John Jay Burris (Dorothy) of Jacksonville, FL, her sister-in-law Pauline Elkins of Wilmington, DE as well as her many adored nieces and nephews from the Burris, Elkins, and Mahon families. She was a treasured in-law and surrogate grandmother to numerous loved ones in the Lennon, Cavanna, Costabile, Blake, Libonati, and Massol families. She was predeceased by two of her life-long friends Myra Mahon, of New York City and Madison, CT who died a few months earlier and Jean Till of Kansas City, KS. An avid gardener, knitter, reader, bird watcher, beachcomber and shopper, she enjoyed all things beautiful, especially when it came to fashion and jewelry. Those who knew her best would describe her as a true force of nature - in complete command of the room, the situation, and her own destiny at all times. A memorial service will be held on Monday, April 25, 11:00am, at The First Congregational Church of Madison, 26 Meeting House Lane, Madison, CT 06443 with a reception to follow.

As he waited for the right moment, the playful calf swam right up to him, so close that he had to lower his camera. That's when he felt a gentle tap on his shoulder. Turning around, Mr. Austin found himself looking straight into the eye of the mother whale, her body bigger than a school bus. The tap had come from her pectoral fin, weighing more than a ton. To Mr. Austin, her gesture was an unmistakable warning that he had gotten too close to the calf. And yet, the mother whale had extended her fin with such precision and grace -- to touch the photographer without hurting him -- that Mr. Austin was in awe of her ''delicate restraint.''"

2011-04-20T00:00:00Z,"The cast of ''The Dark Knight Rises,'' Christopher Nolan's third and final entry in his series of Batman movies, is looking increasingly like the cast of his 2010 summer blockbuster ''Inception,'' with Joseph Gordon-Levitt and Marion Cotillard now officially on board for that superhero film. Warner Brothers Pictures said on Tuesday that Mr. Gordon-Levitt, who played one of Leonardo DiCaprio's dream-invading accomplices in ''Inception,'' will play John Blake, a Gotham City beat cop, in ''The Dark Knight Rises''; Ms. Cotillard, who played Mr. DiCaprio's enigmatic wife in ''Inception,'' has been cast as Miranda Tate, a board member at Wayne Enterprises who is allied with Bruce Wayne. Tom Hardy, another member of the ''Inception'' gang, was previously announced to play the villain Bane, and Michael Caine, who had a brief role in that film (or did he? No, wait, he did) has played the butler Alfred in all of Mr. Nolan's Bat-films. In a statement, Mr. Nolan said: ''When you collaborate with people as talented as Marion and Joe, it comes as no surprise that you would want to repeat the experience. I immediately thought of them for the roles of Miranda and Blake, and I am looking forward to working with both of them again.''"

2011-04-20T00:00:00Z,"4:07 p.m. | Updated It may take uninitiated viewers a few episodes of ''Game of Thrones'' to fully understand the intertwined family rivalries of the Starks, Lannisters and Targaryens, but HBO isn't waiting that long to commit to more episodes of that fantasy series. On Tuesday, the network said it had ordered a second season of ''Game of Thrones,'' which is adapted from George R. R. Martin's best-selling ''Song of Ice and Fire'' novels and produced by David Benioff and D. B. Weiss. HBO said that Sunday's debut episode of ''Game of Thrones'' was watched by 2.2 million viewers in its 9 p.m. broadcast and 4.2 million total viewers over multiple broadcasts that night. That's a respectable start for the 10-episode series, though considerably smaller than HBO's September premiere of the period drama ''Boardwalk Empire,'' which drew 4.8 million viewers for its debut and 7.1 million total viewers for multiple broadcasts."
2011-04-20T00:00:00Z,"In the pantheon of fantasy and science-fiction projects that Joss Whedon helped create, the Internet musical ''Dr. Horrible's Sing-Along Blog'' can be easy to overlook: it's not his beloved television series that ran a healthy seven seasons (''Buffy the Vampire Slayer''), or its beloved spinoff (''Angel''), or his misunderstood television show that was canceled before its time (''Dollhouse'') or his other misunderstood television show that was canceled before its time and spawned a misunderstood movie (''Firefly'' and ''Serenity''). ''Dr. Horrible'' is simply a three-act musical about an aspiring super-villain (played by Neil Patrick Harris), his smug do-gooding nemesis (Nathan Fillion) and the woman who comes between them (Felicia Day). Dreamed up by Mr. Whedon, his brothers Zack and Jed, and Maurissa Tancharoen during the 2007-8 writers' strike and produced on his own dime, it is the pure expression of what they wanted to make at the time, without any outside interference. For that reason alone, ''Dr. Horrible'' holds a special place in Mr. Whedon's heart. (Another sign of his affection: he made time to talk to about it when he really should have been preparing to direct his superhero mega-movie ''The Avengers.'') In these excerpts from a recent conversation, Mr. Whedon spoke to ArtsBeat about the making of the musical, its recently released companion volume ''Dr Horrible's Sing-Along Blog: The Book'' and his future online ambitions. (O.K., so we asked about ''Avengers,'' too.)Q.How are you?A.I am super-tired. I just have insomnia, so I'm like, [zombie voice] ''Uhhhh. Prepping.'' Q.It's been almost three years since ''Dr. Horrible'' was first released. What does it mean to you now?A.It means, what the hell have we been doing? Where's the damn sequel? The shame. Mostly that. And it remains one of the purest experiences of my life. It just makes me happy all the time. It wasn't like anything else.Q.As much as the project was initiated by the writers' strike, was it also in some way an acknowledgment that you couldn't produce something like ''Dr. Horrible'' anywhere but on the Web?A.My ideas are always slightly left-of-center. I like to think that I'm a populist entertainer, but I'm a little bit idiosyncratic and sometimes the networks wouldn't really roll with that. I was trying to - this was during the strike - make a deal with a big Internet company that had expressed interest in doing some low-budget production, and I laid out these ideas that I had, that I thought they might be interested in, the last of which was ''Dr. Horrible.'' I said, ''And here's the one you're definitely not going to want to do.'' And they said, ''Yes. We don't.'' It became clear that nothing was going to happen with this company before the strike was over. So I got more and more obsessed with ''Dr. Horrible'' and asked my wife, ''Honey, would it be O.K. if-'' And she said, ''Hells yeah.'' We just eliminated the middle man. Or actually, the top man.Q.This was totally financed out of your own pocket?A.Mm-hmm. I'm like, hey, you know what? Some mid-life crises are cars. They cost about this much. Mine has songs in it.Q.I was amazed to see, in the book, your original handwritten lyrics to ''My Freeze Ray,'' which contain no crossed-out words, changes or even misspellings. Did all the songs emerge from your head fully-formed like Athena?A.I'm shocked about the misspelling thing. And yes, it was fully-armored. But I usually write things in my head before I ever write them down. When I write it out, usually I've already figured out what it is I'm trying to do. Sometimes I'll forget to write them down, and then I'll be like, ''Here's how this song goes: Uh. I don't remember.'' I'm that organized. Also, it's a pretty simple lyric. There are other song sheets with many scribble-outs. But that one just sort of formed in my head pretty quickly. Not quickly enough. It was actually more painful than that page would express.Q.Were there other numbers that were written but didn't make it to the final cut?A.I don't think there were, because we didn't want to write anything extra. When I first thought of ''Dr. Horrible'' I had worked on a couple of other songs that didn't make it - I didn't even pitch them to the other writers because they didn't work in the structure we'd come up with. There wasn't a lot of ''Well, what if?'' We wrote exactly what we wanted to say and as many songs as we could, knowing exactly where, structurally, they had to go. We were going to cut up some of my endless monologue for Neil, or at least intercut it with things, but he just rocked that one take so well. And we liked the idea people would be settling into the idea of a guy doing a blog when the first musical number started that we ended up leaving it.Q.Was Wonderflonium, the mystery material that Dr. Horrible wants to steal, the most ridiculous name you had heard of before you saw ''Avatar''?A.[laughs] Ah. The thing in ''Avatar'' was also in ''The Core'' so let us give ''The Core'' its credit. ''Avatar'' was not the first to come up with Unobtanium. However, I believe Zack first referred to the mysterious substance as Bananatonium. So Wonderflonium was our nod to real science. It's more grounded.Q.When you look at the success of ''Glee,'' do you feel like that couldn't have happened without things like the ''Buffy'' musical episode ''Once More, With Feeling''?A.No, but boy am I going to tell people that now. I'm going to run that theory up a flagpole. There's other things like ''High School Musical'' that were more influential. However, let's just say I invented television and leave it at that.Q.You don't feel you've played any role in -A.Legitimizing musicals on TV? Maybe. Before ''Once More, With Feeling,'' you couldn't not say ''Cop Rock.'' Nobody was giving it cred, so there is an element of, Oh, it's cool now. That wasn't there. Was I a snowflake in the avalanche? Yes, I was. Am I going to take credit for the whole thing? Possibly not.Q.There have been performances of ''Dr. Horrible'' at conventions - has it been licensed for schools and other stage productions?A.We did a little agreement, and many schools and some professional troupes have done it around the country. We actually had to put a pause on it, because people were starting to sell DVDs and stuff, so we had to figure out more complex legal language, which hopefully we'll be done with soon. Obviously, we love the idea that people and schools are doing it, but if people are making money off it, then we go, ''Hmmm, wait a minute. Isn't there a rule about this?''Q.What about producing it Off Broadway? Or even on Broadway?A.We have spoken of that much. Especially every time Jed comes back from New York - ''We've just got to do it! Come on, we just write some more songs to make these longer!'' Because some of us have sat through ''Spider-Man.''Q.Does that include you?A.[after a pause] I neither confirm nor deny. And you kind of go, ''Hey, let's do something for no money.'' Which is the same feeling we had about TV and movies when we made ''Dr. Horrible.'' But I would say my heart is more in the idea of the sequel. We've done a lot of work on it.Q.Really?A.Oh, yeah. We've got several songs near completion and we've got a very specific structure. We've just all got jobs. And it's not like Neil, Nathan and Felicia ain't busy either. We get together at Christmas and family occasions, and then play each other our partial songs and go, ''Yup, that's still exactly as it was the last time we played it. We're great.'' It's bad.Q.Is there anything you can say yet about what the ''Dr. Horrible'' sequel will be?A.It's going to be ''Dr. Horrible and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull.'' And it's going to be just as good as the other one. I don't know why people are upset about that title. And by the way, by the time we finish it, Neil will be just as old. No, I'm not saying anything.Q.You've had otherprojects that ended, perhaps, in ways you didn't want them to, or before you wanted them to-A.I'm sure I don't know what you mean.Q.-so after something like ''Dr. Horrible,'' are you ever tempted to chuck it all and only produce things for the Internet?A.I'm more than tempted. I'm a little obsessed. And after ''Dr. Horrible,'' I thought, well, somebody will come around. I talked at great length and planned at great length the idea of a portal and putting shows together, having an Internet identity and starting my own little micro-studio. Nobody in town was interested, and then by the time they were, ''Avengers'' came around. I was and will continue to work on a very, very different Internet mini-thing that I was writing with Warren Ellis, and I have a lot of ideas for things I want to put up there. I still believe it's a viable financial model, and a creative playground and I miss it. But in the year that I was supposed to do that, I instead decided to make this little Sundance movie that I'm making.Q.I certainly hope you find distribution for it.A.You know, I'm looking at the Independent Film Channel very closely. Knock wood.Q.Did you happen to keep up with the March Madness tournament on io9.com, in which readers voted ''Serenity'' the top fantasy film of all time, over ''The Empire Strikes Back''?A.I have been alerted to this fact by certain of my friends. When I saw us going up against ''Empire Strikes Back,'' all I could think was, ''Oh, they're gonna hate it. They're gonna hate us. They're gonna call our fans names.'' But while ''Empire Strikes Back'' is for me the more seminal film, ''Serenity'' at least has an ending. I don't know when ''The Matrix'' got voted down - that's my favorite. It is starting to be a double-edged sword. There's no greater sadness than not still being on board that ship with that crew, in my career. All I can think is, maybe someday, someone at Universal will say, ''Hey, we made money. Let's do that again.'' So I'm glad that it lives. But I also know that every time it gets in one of those polls, against beloved movies, we just get flamed. I feel sad, too.Q.It's like being a parent, and letting your child find its way in the world.A.I can't control how beautiful and popular my child is. What can I do?Q.Since there's not much you can discuss about ''Avengers'' right now, what can you tell me about the status of your long-awaited horror film ''The Cabin in the Woods''?A.I know that MGM is talking to people about it. Because MGM is, Everything must go - they've lost their lease. And I believe that there is some interest from other companies in acquiring it and distributing it. More than that, I cannot say, but I have hope that ''Avengers'' may not be the only thing I get to put out next year.Q.Can you say when you start production on ''Avengers''?A.We're just a hardscrabble bunch. Guerilla filmmaking. I start production a week from Monday. I'm going to get started on the script now. Apparently that's a thing. I don't get it. Improv stunts are always way more exciting-looking."

He treated his staff with kindness and generosity. Many stayed at SDI for several years since it became a second home. Bill was very interested in antique cars and was a member of many cars clubs. His last car was a 1932 Packard Roadster Coupe which he sold only a few days prior to passing. He and his wife Susan also enjoyed boating and took several trips before his health deteriorated. He traveled with Susan to many countries, but after 9/11 decided to see more of America. They tried to visit as many states as possible and enjoyed meeting people along the way. He was the life of every party and loved to dance, tell jokes with various dialects making everyone laugh until their sides hurt. He was always the first to help his family and circle of friends - always lending a helping hand with no strings attached. If there was story on the news about someone having hard times, he was always the first to call the station with a donation. The lady who had no place to live, a veteran who tried to keep afloat, a clinic that needed donations to keep going, all the major charities were recipients of extremely large donations. If a church needed a chalice, he would always send them a check. He was larger than life and this gentle soul touched the lives of everyone privileged to know him. He will be greatly missed. Donations in his memory can be made to the American Heart Association and the American Lung Association. Services will be Thursday, April 21, 2011 at 11:00am at the Gardens Memorial Park, 4103 N.

2011-04-20T00:00:00Z,"For many, Grete Waitz, the nine-time New York City Marathon champion who became synonymous with the race, was much more than a world- class athlete. In the hours after her death Tuesday, they shared their recol- lections of chance meetings with Waitz, on and off the course, describing her humility, acts of generosity and mo- ments of inspiration. Here are some of them, edited and condensed. In the early 1980s, as a young high school girl in rural America, I ran because I was lonely. I ran because I didn't fit in. I ran be- cause I really didn't know what else to do. I used my newspaper route money and pur- chased a subscription to a running maga- zine to follow Grete. I didn't have the natu- ral talent and grace that she possessed, but I did well enough that I felt as though I had become a part of something good. I give thanks for her example during a time when it was really needed. Still Running, Michigan"

2011-04-20T00:00:00Z,"A year ago, the Deepwater Horizon drilling rig exploded, gushing nearly five million barrels of oil into the Gulf of Mexico before it was finally capped three months later. It was by most accounts a disaster. But when it comes to wrecking our oceans, the accidental BP spill was small compared with the damage we do with intent and ignorance. I recently talked about this with two men who specialize in ocean affairs: Carl Safina, the author of ''A Sea In Flames'' and the president of the Blue Ocean Institute; and Ted Danson, (yes, that Ted Danson), who recently published Oceana (the book) and is a board member of Oceana, the conservation organization he helped found. As Safina said, ''Many people believe the whole catastrophe is the oil we spill, but that gets diluted and eventually disarmed over time. In fact, the oil we don't spill, the oil we collect, refine and use, produces CO2 and other gases that don't get diluted.''"
2011-04-20T00:00:00Z,"An article last Wednesday about the San Pellegrino World's 50 Best Restaurants list quoted incorrectly from comments by Lars Peder Hedberg, the chairman of one of the regional juries that select the restaurants. He said he had told Swedish tourism officials that, to promote Swedish restaurants for inclusion on the list, they should invite regional chairmen and journalists on free trips to try the restaurants; he did not say that the journalists invited should be limited to those who are jurors for the list. The article also misstated the number of jurors whom the Swedish tourism bureau brought on an all-expenses-paid trip to eat at several of the country's leading restaurants in 2010. There were 8, not 11. (The 3 other guests were not jurors.) The article also omitted two countries included in the regional jury led by Mr. Hedberg. They are Denmark and Norway, in addition to Sweden. Because of an editing error, the article also misstated the surname of a regional chairman who said he had accepted a free trip from Swedish tourism officials. He is Steve Dolinsky, not Dolinksy."

Now the producers of ''End of the Rainbow,'' a popular London play with music about Garland's final months, are aiming to return her (as a character) and those numbers and more to Broadway in the spring of 2012."

The famous lines spoken by Gloria Swanson's decrepit silent-movie goddess Norma Desmond sprang to mind the other night at Avery Fisher Hall during the New York Philharmonic's concert version of ''Company.'' I imagined there might be a few old-time Broadway performers in the audience muttering similar sentiments to themselves as they watched Lonny Price's vocally vacuous presentation of the Stephen Sondheim-George Furth musical. ''Back in my day, we had voices!'' I could picture one seething through his or her teeth to a colleague at intermission. Patti LuPone's powerhouse, this-is-how-it's-done-kids performance of her big solo, the show's celebrated ''Ladies Who Lunch,'' seemed infused with determination to give the aficionados of full-throttle Broadway vocalizing something to cheer about. For much of the rest of the evening, accomplished singing was all but absent, a particular oddity in a production backed by the full forces of a world-class orchestra."

He is someone with a solid base of knowledge, a light hand with details and an ego that rarely intrudes. We first met in 2008, when he took over Halston. Hardly anyone knew him; he had been Donatella Versace’s assistant for many years. But Mr. Zanini brought a clean vitality to Halston, especially to the day clothes. That show remains a favorite of mine, and it was his only Halston collection because he and the owners parted ways within a few months. Then he got the gig at Rochas, and he’s taken a completely different approach with the sporty French label. Mr. Zanini was in New York recently and we chatted about the business, Dior’s next move — what everybody is talking about."

Dugan started the publishing arm of his business in 2009 as an additional platform for the artists whose Web sites, books and ephemera he was already designing. “Allan Kaprow, Ed Ruscha and a lot of the Fluxus artists were designing all these amazing objects to help support their projects,” he says. “I guess I think of us as trying to help continue that lineage.”"

Some of the work, like the circular swimming pool that Piero Golia built in the yard of an updated Spanish-style gem or Jennifer West’s experimental surf films, which will screen at sundown at a Carpinteria surf shack, makes direct references to life in Southern California. Other installations play with personal space: the sculptor Ry Rocklen’s tiled floor piece speaks to the work of the mosaic artist who is hosting him, and Bettina Hubby (above) has created curtains — depicting her “living” inside a Montecito Tudor — that will hang outside the windows, “providing privacy for the owners but exposing me,” she says.

Visitors enter the exhibition in a space surrounded by video images from Lindbergh’s recent cinematic series, “Invasion,” a film that depicts a crowd in slow motion moving into a cloud of smoke.

2011-04-21T00:00:00Z,"About two dozen prominent film directors and producers, including James Cameron, below, Michael Bay and Peter Jackson, joined in an open letter Wednesday challenging a plan by four studios to make some films available via video on demand shortly after their release in theaters. ''As leaders in the creative community, we ask for a seat at the table,'' said the letter, which called on others to join in opposition to any rush toward on-demand services that might undercut the viability of films in theaters. The letter campaign was organized by the National Association of Theater Owners, an industry trade group that has voiced strong opposition to a plan by Sony Pictures Entertainment, 20th Century Fox, Universal Studios and Warner Brothers to show a small number of their films on a premium on-demand service as soon as two months after their release. DirecTV has said it will start an on-demand service, called Home Premiere, with the four studios on Thursday. The first title to be shown on that service will be ''Just Go With It,'' which stars Adam Sandler and Jennifer Aniston. ''Careers that are built on the risks that can be taken with lower-budget films may never have the chance to blossom under this cutthroat new model,'' warned the opposing filmmakers in their open letter, which was to be posted on the theater owners Web site."

The vote was 8-0 in favor of the plan to reuse the space for a retail store, Joe Fresh. Three members of the commission were absent for the vote; at least one of them, Margery Perlmutter, had questioned the developer's proposal to change the escalators to an east-west direction from the current north-south configuration.

Dr. Gibbs was born the eldest child of three to George and Irma (nee Margot) Hartmaier in Long Island, New York, on June 15, 1941. She was followed by her sisters, Leslie and Abbie. Judith was an award-winning violinist as a child and later a published poet. Moving with her family to Oxford, PA in 1954, she attended public school and was a merit scholarship finalist. She received a B.A. degree in biochemistry from the University of Delaware in 1963 and did research at the Sloan Kettering Institute in Manhattan. She received an M.A. in Russian Studies from Johns Hopkins University in 1968, and was elected to Phi Beta Kappa. In 1968, Dr. Gibbs emigrated to Canada, where she graduated with honours from the McGill University medical school in Montreal. She received advanced training in paediatrics and neonatology at McGill and was awarded an MRC research fellowship to Oxford University, in England. In 1978, Dr. Gibbs was appointed Assistant Professor of Paediatrics and Obstetrics at McGill University. Dr. Gibbs returned to the United States in 1980 to establish a neonatal intensive care unit at the Allentown Pennsylvania Hospital. She later established a similar unit in Camden, New Jersey. Dr. Gibbs returned to university and received a J.D. in Law from Villanova University in Pennsylvania in 1987. She was elected to the Law Review and Moot Court, and called to the bar in 1987. Dr. Gibbs then decided to return to her greater love, paediatric medicine. She practised paediatrics for several years in the Poconos in Pennsylvania. In 1990, she returned to Canada and joined the Hospital for Sick Children in Toronto. Later she opened her private paediatric practice in Toronto. During this time she was also on call as a neonatologist at St. Michael's Hospital, saving many babies' lives. Until her death, she continued to do the work which was most meaningful to her, and to show her great and enduring love for infants, children and their families, and her dedication to their health and wellbeing. Her death from a stroke was unexpected. The family and friends of Dr. Gibbs express their deepest gratitude to the doctors, nurses and staff of St. Michael's Hospital, for the care and support they gave her during her final illness. She leaves behind her two sisters, Leslie Galambos (Pennsylvania), Abbie Hartmaier (Massachusetts), and Mary Barratt, her loving partner of many years.

2011-04-21T00:00:00Z,"8 P.M. (13) LA FANCIULLA DEL WEST One hundred years after its premiere at the Metropolitan Opera, Puccini's Wild West opera returns in this ''Great Performances at the Met'' program, taped in January and shown in theaters as part of ''The Met: Live in HD'' series. Set in a mining camp during the California Gold Rush, this 1991 production, above, by Giancarlo Del Monaco stars Deborah Voigt as Minnie, the saloon owner with the ravishing voice, who has her sights set on the mysterious Dick Johnson (Marcello Giordani). And nothing -- not horses, hangmen or a high-stakes poker game -- can stop her. ''On this night, thanks in large part to the stylish, nuanced and sensitive conducting of Nicola Luisotti, the score emerged as arguably Puccini's most subtly written and boldly modern music,'' Anthony Tommasini wrote in his December review in The New York Times. He added: ''As always, Ms. Voigt's singing will stir debate within the opera world. Given the competition around right now, I cannot think of a soprano who could sing any better this demanding role, which requires luscious legato phrasing, a powerful top range and stamina.'' The opera's debut on Dec. 10, 1910, was the first world premiere presented by the Met. Puccini, who was sitting alone in a box, joined the cast after Act I for 14 curtain calls. The stage director then was David Belasco, from whose play ''The Girl of the Golden West'' the opera was adapted; the leads were Emmy Destinn and Enrico Caruso; the conductor, Arturo Toscanini. Similar pandemonium broke out at the end of the other two acts, Mr. Tommasini noted. 8 P.M. (NBC) COMMUNITY As the school year ends, the study group reminisces about its favorite times together. In ''The Paul Reiser Show,'' at 8:30, Paul tries to smooth the feathers of a brute (Henry Rollins) who believes Paul has wronged him.

The production, directed by Rob Ruggiero, opened on Tuesday at the Booth Theater, and though the play received mixed notices, there was some praise for Ms. Turner's performance. In a review for The New York Times, Charles Isherwood wrote that, in her role as Sister Jamison Connelly, Ms. Turner was ''all but smacking her lips like a gourmet savoring al dente pasta'' as she made ''a feast of largely unexceptional dialogue.'' For the week ending April 17, ''High'' played to about 79 percent capacity but grossed just $91,000 in ticket sales, meaning that tickets were being heavily discounted.

2011-04-21T00:00:00Z,"For the most part declining album sales are bad news for the music industry. But there's one way in which they can benefit musicians: with everybody selling fewer records, it can be easier for an artist to climb higher on the charts. This week the Foo Fighters scored their first No. 1 album with ''Wasting Light'' (Roswell/RCA), which sold 235,000 copies, according to Nielsen SoundScan. That's a lower sales total than the band had for its last chart peak -- ''In Your Honor,'' which reached No. 2 with 311,000 sales in 2005 -- but this week it carried the band to the top spot. Other artists also hit personal highs on the charts this week. Alison Krauss and Union Station opened at No. 3 with 83,000 sales of ''Paper Airplane'' (Rounder). Ms. Krauss had reached No. 2 for her album with Robert Plant four years ago but never rose so high with Union Station, her longtime band. Paul Simon had his highest opening-week ranking ever -- as a solo artist, or with Simon & Garfunkel -- with ''So Beautiful or So What'' (Hear Music/Concord), which sold 68,000 copies to reach No. 4. On Billboard's singles chart Katy Perry's ''E.T.'' was bumped from No. 1 after a three-week run at the top by Rihanna's ''S&M,'' which more than doubled its download sales from last week, to 293,000. ''E.T.'' fell to No. 2 with 284,000 downloads, and the Black Eyed Peas' ''Just Can't Get Enough'' was No. 3 with 172,000."

In its complaint, the labor board said that Boeing's decision to transfer a second production line for its new 787 Dreamliner passenger plane to South Carolina was motivated by an unlawful desire to retaliate against union workers for their past strikes in Washington and to discourage future strikes.

In a statement released by the company on Friday, Mr. Stiefel, 38, said he had decided to withdraw so that he could focus on his duties as dean of dance at the University of North Carolina School of the Arts. This is Mr. Stiefel’s final year as dean. He is to take on the role of artistic director of the Royal New Zealand Ballet in September. “Leading the U.N.C.S.A. School of Dance through a critical period of transition has required the type of energy and attention that has kept me from properly focusing and physically preparing for my upcoming performances,” Mr. Stiefel said in the statement. “I am truly disappointed not to be performing with my colleagues at ABT and for the New York audiences.” This season he was scheduled to dance opposite Alina Cojocaru in “Giselle” in May and Natalia Osipova in “Coppelia” in June. Mr. Stiefel, who joined Ballet Theater in 1997, has also withdrawn from American Ballet Theater’s tour of Japan in July."

Twenty-one-year-old Stefano Langone, a soulful singer from Washington, was eliminated after he received the lowest share of 52 million votes cast by fans. According to Nielsen’s estimates, Fox easily won both the 8 p.m. time slot with “Idol” and the 9 p.m. hour with “Bones” (11.1 million). CBS ranked second for the night despite a lineup of repeats including “CSI” (8.4 million) and “The Mentalist” (11 million). NBC finished in third as its new sitcom “The Paul Reiser Show” struggled badly at 8:30 p.m., attracting just 2.5 million viewers and lagging behind even CW’s “Vampire Diaries” (2.7 million). NBC’s later comedies fared a bit better with “The Office” (6.8 million) leading the way for the network at 9 p.m. and “Parks and Recreation” earning 5.1 million viewers at 9:30. A special hourlong 100th episode of “30 Rock” averaged 4.6 million viewers at 10 p.m. ABC was fourth on the night with reruns."
2011-04-22T14:00:59Z,"David Lynch is best known as a director, but it was the paintings he made in Philadelphia as a young art student that gave him the idea to make his first film. The work he is showing nearly 50 years later at the William Griffin Gallery in Santa Monica, Calif., straddles both genres — illuminated light bulbs protrude from the canvases, and abstract figures dance across them. The installation includes eerie watercolors and a number of lamplike sculptures. Lynch’s proclivity for “shape and light” drew him to another project, Silencio, a nightclub set to open this summer at 142 rue Montmartre in Paris, for which he designed the interiors and the furniture. “I enjoy how architecture and design create mood,” he says. The club was named for the spooky theater in “Mulholland Drive,” so no telling what that mood will be."

Jon Gnarr, best known as an actor and comedian in that country, started a new political party, the Best Party, and ran for mayor on a humorous platform that promised to bring Disneyland to Iceland. To the surprise of nearly everyone (including Mr. Gnarr himself), he was elected. A documentary at the Tribeca Film Festival charts the rise of the party and Mr. Gnarr’s political aspirations.

At Ingo Maurer's stand at Euroluce, the furniture fair's biennial lighting show, J.B.

The duo behind the label United Bamboo recently set out to create an eco-friendly line that would give green technology a bit of boudoir appeal. “There are many companies putting out clothes labeled as organic, but the fabrics might have been dyed or finished with harsh chemicals,” Pham says. Bamboo By, a new collection of camisoles, dresses and smocks inspired by Victorian undergarments, definitely delivers on the sexy front. But as far as organic goes, there is still work to be done. “It’s a long process and will most likely never be 100 percent eco-friendly,” Pham adds, “but we encourage our vendors to offer more organic pieces to supplement the nonorganic collections they carry.” With current eco lines focusing on ethics as well as design, we look forward to Bamboo’s commitment to both moral and aesthetic standards."

2011-04-22T10:16:34Z,"If you are buying clothes for a newborn, what color do you buy? The general rule these days is that girls are more likely to wear pink and boys are more likely to wear blue. But that wasn’t always the case. In 1918, an article in Ladies Home Journal advised: “The generally accepted rule is pink for the boys, and blue for the girls. The reason is that pink, being a more decided and stronger color, is more suitable for the boy, while blue, which is more delicate and dainty, is prettier for the girl.”"
2011-04-22T10:05:25Z,"Michael Elmgreen and Ingar Dragset like to build things up just to knock them down, as in the last Venice Biennale, where they dolled up a pavilion as a house — and then put it up for sale. For “The One and the Many,” a new installation at the Museum Boijmans Van Beuningen’s Submarine Wharf in Rotterdam, the Netherlands, they created a boulevard of broken dreams, with an apartment block inspired by East German socialist housing. Visitors will peek into the building’s windows from a Ferris wheel and gawk at the humanity therein, including a middle-aged man watching soccer on TV in a room decorated with trophies, or a teenage boy logged onto a gay-chat Web site. “It’s like building a Disneyland with less of that feel-good effect and slightly more complex content,” they said."

2011-04-22T09:34:24Z,"It may not compensate for a total lack of dinosaurs, but the Museum of Modern Art is doing what it can to reach out to more youthful patrons: on Friday, the museum said that Kanye West will perform at its annual Party in the Garden benefit, which takes place this year on May 10 in its Abby Aldrich Rockefeller Sculpture Garden. Though Mr. West is perhaps better known for his mercurial temperament and widely hailed albums like “My Beautiful Dark Twisted Fantasy,” he gets modern art cred, too, for working with artists like George Condo (who painted the covers for “Dark Twisted Fantasy”) and Marco Brambilla (who directed the video for Mr. West’s “Power”). You’ll have to dig up some serious gold if you want to attend the MoMA performance: tickets are $150 in advance and $250 at the door, while V.I.P. tickets (which include special access to a terrace overlooking the garden) are $500.

In cheekily full frontal fashion, they opened their set wearing a bright pink, three-helmet contraption that connected the trio with rods into a triangle formation. When not attached at the head with her bandmates, Samson leaped around the stage, enthusiastically leading the frenzied audience through song after song of electronic, danceable fun, and interlacing the carefree tracks with messages of radical politics and feminism."

So I am very well attuned to rearranged aisles, new cashiers and the latest innovations. Recently, though, I’ve noticed a trend that has nothing to do with selling groceries.

(It’s also more than five times your daily cholesterol allowance, but you don’t have to eat it every day.) Or if you prefer, a classic jumbo brain sandwich, made with deep-fried pig brains, is $6.95 at the Hilltop Inn in Evansville, Ind. You could also stick a bendy straw in one ear and try to suck out part of your brain — perhaps the part that can’t unsee the fried jumbo brain sandwich."

The book was “Lipstick in Afghanistan” by Roberta Gately, a fictional account of an American nurse volunteering in Bamiyan Province after 9/11.

Several of these spaces, within blocks of one another on either side of Canal Street (those to the south are technically in TriBeCa), have impressive spring shows that keep a spirit of experimentation alive, and that are, by coincidence, thematically connected. Artists Space opened in 1972 and is still going strong. Under the directorship of Stefan Kalmar it has recently presented a string of solos by artists who, if not discoveries, are low on the New York radar.

In 2008, the Supreme Court declined to hear a case challenging that proof."

2011-04-22T00:00:00Z,"NEW YORK is a great art city and a great walking city. Put those pluses together with spring -- which is finally here, right? -- and the time has come to hit the streets of the major gallery neighborhoods, of which Manhattan has four. The most populous, Chelsea, is blue- chip country; at the moment Picasso is the star attraction there, and a variety of other shows are looking to the Modernist past. The Lower East Side may now be short on boho cred, but it still has room for starter galleries. Uptown is, as always, a meanderingly eclectic mix -- William Adolphe Bouguereau meets Sol Lewitt meets something called ''Massage'' -- sometimes found in august town-house settings. SoHo, the thinned-out Chelsea of yesteryear, demands little shoe leather but lots of thought and concentration; nearly all of Manhattan's still-experimental alternative spaces are there."

The arrangement calls for the president to hand over power immediately and step down in 30 days, and sets up new presidential elections 60 days later, a Yemeni official said, speaking on condition of anonymity.

2011-04-22T00:00:00Z,"As part of its budget bill, Congress approved a brief rider, 11 lines long, that removes gray wolves in Idaho and Montana from the protections of the Endangered Species Act. The rider overturns a recent court ruling, prohibits further judicial review and cannot be good for the wolf. But the worst part is that it sets a terrible precedent -- allowing Congress to decide the fate of animals on the list. The law's purpose is to base protections on science. Now that politics has been allowed to trump science when it comes to the gray wolf, which species will be next?"
2011-04-22T00:00:00Z,"With less than a year to go before the Iowa caucuses, Republican voters have yet to form strong opinions about most of their potential candidates for president in 2012, according to the latest New York Times/CBS News poll. Only those possible contenders who regularly appear on television -- or have run before -- are well known enough to elicit significant views from their fellow Republicans. And of that group, only former Gov. Mike Huckabee of Arkansas and former Gov. Sarah Palin of Alaska are viewed favorably by more than half of the Republican electorate."
2011-04-22T00:00:00Z,"What a difference two years make. When The New York Times last surveyed Lower East Side galleries, in 2009, my fellow critic Ken Johnson observed that ''the Lower East Side is not the new Chelsea and probably never will be.'' He pointed to the lack of ''big-box commercial vendors showing internationally acclaimed talents.'' Since then several of those vendors have set up shop in intimidating, architect-designed spaces along the neighborhood's north end, near the New Museum. These galleries may be below Houston but they run on Chelsea Standard Time, keeping Tuesday-through-Saturday hours and bucking the neighborhood trend of Wednesday-through-Sunday. And in them you'll often find seasoned artists like Richard Prince, who inaugurated Salon 94 Bowery in May; or Bruce Nauman, breaking in Sperone Westwater's new building last fall; or Kara Walker, who has split her current solo show between Lehmann Maupin's Lower East Side branch and Sikkema Jenkins in Chelsea."

The museum said on Thursday that the exhibition, ''Jim Henson's Fantastic World,'' will open on July 16 and run through Jan. 16, 2012; it will feature more than 120 works, including drawings, props and, of course, puppets from a career that spanned some 35 years."

Residents described a mobilization in the capital, Damascus, and, in more pronounced fashion, in the restive city of Homs, where a government crackdown this week dispersed one of the largest gatherings since demonstrations began last month. For days, organizers have looked to Friday as a potential show of strength for a movement that has yet to build the critical mass reached in Egypt and Tunisia."

2011-04-22T00:00:00Z,"AS a crazed working mom who needs regular exercise to stay sane, I find the treadmill a time-saving staple. It provides a cathartic, climate-controlled run supported by escapist Black Eyed Peas videos and E! reality television. Yet unsupervised treadmill running comes with a caveat: I am my own coach, so I run only hard enough to sweat and feel virtuous. But am I pushing myself? I decided to find out by trying treadmill classes offered in Manhattan at several Equinox locations and at Chelsea Piers. They range from 30 minutes to an hour and are interval-based, meaning that participants alternate between slow running and sprinting or running at a minimal incline and climbing the machine equivalent of a supersteep hill. There's no jogging along at a nice, easy clip -- except to warm up or recover."

2011-04-22T00:00:00Z,"At the southeast entrance to Central Park stands a colorful, tubular structure resembling a swing-set frame designed by spiders on LSD. Touching ground at 10 points on the cobbled plaza, its red, green and black striped posts rise at different angles into an airy web more than 18 feet high at its tallest. A playful riff on the ancient form of the triumphal arch, ''Empire,'' by the Irish sculptor Eva Rothschild, may be viewed for the purposes at hand as a metaphorical gateway to the entertainingly illogical array of new and old artworks awaiting Midtown and Upper East Side gallery hoppers. A suggested itinerary would have you begin at the Crown Building on Fifth Avenue just below 57th Street where two galleries have extremely different shows. Gering & López presents a 30-year survey of works on paper by the Postmodernist abstract painter Peter Halley. Neatly limned ink drawings from 1981 declare the concepts on which his retro-Modernist, grid-based paintings have been based: they are schematic renderings of prison cells that represent modern systems of dwelling, technology and communication as a vast, interconnected penitentiary of consciousness. On the other hand, more than three dozen small, Day-Glo-hued paintings on paper, from 1977 to 2010, attest to a nimble, geometric formalist sensibility reminiscent of the early Frank Stella."

But he still has to face the rite of passage that every New York governor since Hugh L. Carey has had to navigate: the singular force that is Fredric U. Dicker of The New York Post. The era when one reporter could dominate the news has given way to a modern media culture saturated with blogging, posting on Twitter and stories with millisecond shelf lives. But New York can be more old-fashioned. And here Mr. Dicker's radio show and weekly op-ed column in The Post remain a potent cocktail in state politics."
