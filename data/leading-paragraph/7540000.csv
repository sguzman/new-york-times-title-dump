But surely there is more to add here. If you and your spouse are still alive, one of the best things you can do is make sure that you both know exactly what you own and what you owe and how to find all the relevant account information.

Jordan was a lifelong New Yorker and he served the city in many ways, including as director of Neighborhood Action Program in the John Lindsay administration. He was a proud veteran of World War II and an equally proud graduate of Townsend Harris, City College, and Columbia University, where he wrote his master's thesis on the Socialist Workers Party. He was a man of prolific talents: union organizer, editor, publisher, author of many books, Hebrew scholar and math professor. He loved the Spanish Loyalists who fought Franco, and he was confident of the survival of the Jewish people. Most of all he loved his family: his wife of 63 years, Trudy; his daughters, Deborah, who predeceased him, and Susie; his granddaughter Sarah; and his sons-in-law Jay Bernstein and Eugene Scheiman. Jordan was an extraordinary man: kind, gentle, generous, and a true intellectual; we will remember him, love him, and miss him forever.

2011-09-10T00:00:00Z,"8 P.M. (HBO) 127 HOURS (2010) In April 2003, Aron Ralston, a 27-year-old hiker, fell in a narrow slot in Blue John Canyon, in Utah, and was trapped, his right arm pinned beneath a boulder. For five days he struggled to free himself, narrating his plight into a small video camera and reflecting on the mistakes that landed him in this mess -- not least, neglecting to tell anyone where he was going. Faced with the increasing prospect of death, Mr. Ralston decided to amputate his immobilized arm using the blade of a cheap multipurpose tool. James Franco, above, earned an Academy Award nomination for his turn as Mr. Ralston in this film by Danny Boyle, which A. O. Scott, writing in The New York Times, called ''nearly flawless.'' There are scenes, he added, ''that are hard to bear -- the cracking of a bone, the severing of a nerve, the desperate consumption of a water bag filled with urine -- but what these moments communicate is more than worth a jolt of discomfort or a spasm of revulsion. To say that this movie gets under your skin is only barely a figure of speech. It pins you down, shakes you up and leaves you glad to be alive.'' 10:30 A.M.

2011-09-10T00:00:00Z,"TAFFNER--Donald L. An iconic independent distributor and producer of television programming and live theater attractions, passed peacefully on Tuesday, September 6, 2011 after a brief stay in Lenox Hill Hospital, Manhattan. Among his many achievements, he and his wife-business partner, Eleanor Bolta, were responsible for bringing such television shows to the American public as, ""Three's Company"", ""Too Close For Comfort"" and ""The Benny Hill Show."" She passed away a year ago. The quintessential American success story, Taffner grew up above his family's candy store in Brooklyn where his education in business began. Preparing the day's newspapers with his father, running telephone messages to persons throughout the neighborhood and just being ""in the store"" taught Don about getting along with and being able to talk to people...it gave him a unique set of social skills and a pronounced business attitude which held fast throughout his life. A proud graduate of St. John's College (now known as University), Don took a job in the mailroom of the William Morris Agency in 1952 and by the time he left the well-known agency in 1959, he had been an agent there for four years. In 1959 he built his expertise in television distribution by helping to begin the Television Distribution Program Department at Paramount. The Taffners were married in 1961 and in 1963 they launched D.L. Taffner Ltd, their own business. The company started out as a worldwide distributor of TV programs and later, as DLT Entertainment Ltd., expanded to TV and stage production. In 1986, Don Taffner's considerable significant contributions to the development of the industry were recognized by the International Council of the National Academy of Television Arts and Sciences, which presented him with an Emmy for its prestigious Founders Award ""for setting new levels of creativity in the worldwide exchange of television programs"". As a result of his work in television, specifically British television, Don Taffner was awarded an OBE in 2002. As an offshoot of his television business, Don became involved with the prestigious Theatre of Comedy in the UK and the company continues to own and manage the Shaftesbury Theatre on the West End. Champions of St. John's University, in 2005, Donald and Eleanor Taffner were given Johnny's Angels Awards by St. John's Bread and Life, an organization that is devoted to getting food to those who need it in Brooklyn and in Queens. In 2007, the Taffners were presented with the Spirit of Service Award for their continuing contribution to the school. Having developed a great passion for Charles Rennie Mackintosh and the Glasgow School, Don and Eleanor Taffner were presented with a Wallace award at the 'Icons of Scotland Dinner' hosted by Scotland Magazine in 2005, and were the first individuals with no hereditary connection to Scotland to ever receive the award.

Mr. Barbour, who briefly considered his own run for the presidency earlier this year, is a former chairman of the Republican National Committee and the Republican Governors Association. Well-connected in party circles and known as a formidable fund-raiser, his addition to the American Crossroads team suggests that the group is preparing to play a leading role in the 2012 elections, with the capacity to raise and spend more money than the G.O.P.'s official national party committees combined.

2011-09-10T00:00:00Z,"WEISBERG--Robert, beloved husband, father, and grandfather, died suddenly on September 1, 2011. The cause of death is still unknown. Bob was a long-time scientist at the National Institutes of Health in Bethesda, MD, where he was the head of the section on microbial genetics, National Institute of Child Health and Development Program in Genomics of Development. He retired in 2008 after nearly 40 years of service to the NIH but continued his work as a scientist emeritus. He was author on numerous papers, as well as a teacher and mentor to many students. He was a vibrant and productive member of the NIH community. Bob was born on May 24th, 1937, in Bayonne, NJ, to Clarice and Jack. He was class valedictorian at Bayonne High School in 1954 and went on to get an A.B. at Harvard in 1958. A summer course with Nobel laureate Jim Watson inspired Bob to pursue a career in microbial genetics. In 1963, Bob received a Ph.D. in virology at the California Institute of Technology, where he was advised by another Nobel laureate, Renato Dulbecco. His postdoctoral training took him to Europe first to the Medical Research Council Microbial Genetics Research Unit in London and then to 'Institut de Biologie Physico-chimique in Paris. He established his own lab at the Oak Ridge National Laboratory in Tennessee before moving to the NIH in 1969. As molecular biology was first emerging as a field of its own, viruses such as bacteriophage lambda that infect the bacteria E. coli became the favorite research tools, enabling biologists to conduct experiments to understand basic processes even before the modern tools of genome sequencing and recombinant DNA were available. Bob was a master practitioner in the study of lambda, and his research led to several breakthroughs in molecular biology. He published elegant work dissecting the genetics and molecular basis of key biological processes in bacteriophage lambda. The lessons learned have proven to be central to our understanding of how similar processes proceed in humans how cancer viruses incorporate themselves into our genomes, how viruses such as HIV are packaged, and how viruses and cells express genes at some times but not at others. After retirement, Bob moved to the National Cancer Institute's Laboratory of Molecular Biology, where he was a valued source of ideas, advice, and enthusiasm. Bob loved fine food and fine wine, travel, and fishing at his summer home on Fire Island, NY. But most of all, he loved the company of family and close friends. He was also an avid mushroom hunter and a collector of all things pig-related. He was happily married for 52 years to his dear wife Judy. He is survived by his wife Judy, of Garrett Park, MD; by his daughter Eve, of Silver Spring, MD; his son Josh, of Houston, TX; and his grandkids Philip, Sofia, and Angelina. He is also survived by his sister Beth, of Seattle, WA. Bob lived a remarkably happy life and touched all of our lives. We miss him deeply. Bob's family will be welcoming friends, family, and acquaintances to the Weisberg home on September 11, 2011. The family asks that donations be made in Bob's name to Bob's favorite local NPR station, WAMU (202-885-1252)."
2011-09-10T00:00:00Z,"TELLIER--Janet Sullivan. Janet Sullivan Tellier, 72, of Vero Beach, Florida, died on September 5, 2011 surrounded by her husband and her daughters. She was born in Staten Island, NY to Patrick and Agatha Sullivan on August 27, 1939, and was raised in Scarsdale, New York with her sister, Ann Sullivan Kilfoil of Ft. Wayne, Indiana. The spirit in which Janet lived her life and the courage she showed while living with pancreatic cancer will continue as an inspiration to her family and her so many dear friends. In 1961, she married Francis Joseph Tellier of Rye, New York. One of Janet's happiest memories is when she and her beloved husband, Frank, celebrated their 50th wedding anniversary on August 5th, 2011. They settled in Mamaroneck, New York where they raised their three daughters, Susan Tellier Perticone of Darien, CT, Nancy Tellier Vandervelde of Wellesley, MA and Sheila Tellier Nottebohm of Darien, CT. Janet adored her ten grandchildren Lacey, Lexie, Hollis, and Isabelle Perticone; Murphy, Jack, and Sophie Vandervelde; Johann, Annabel, and Fritz Nottebohm. Janet was a graduate of the Ursuline School in New Rochelle, New York and Manhattanville College in Purchase, New York. She was a member of Winged Foot Golf Club in Mamaroneck, NY and The Manursing Island Club in Rye, NY. In 1980, she fulfilled her dream of owning her own business when Janet opened The Chocolate Lady, a gourmet chocolate store, in Greenwich, CT. In 2006, Janet moved to Vero Beach, Florida. Janet was an active golfer who enjoyed playing at the Johns Island Club and Quail Valley Golf Club. She was a parishioner of Holy Cross Church, and a volunteer at the Hospice House in Vero Beach. Her favorite past times were painting, playing bridge, gardening, sailing, and traveling. Above all, she enjoyed spending time with her family and many friends. The family asks that in lieu of flowers, friends may consider a memorial donation in Janet's memory to the VNA Foundation and Hospice, 1110 35th Lane, Vero Beach, FL 32960.

2011-09-11T00:00:00Z,"CARROLL--Sidney Burke, 87, passed away June 9 surrounded by her four sons. Born August 15, 1923 in Rutland, VT, she was the daughter of the late J. Frank and Mary Barnett Burke. Sidney and her three younger siblings spent their youth in Slingerlands, NY. She graduated cum laude from The Albany Academy for Girls in 1941 and graduated as a Wellesley College Scholar in 1945 with a B.A. in Political Science. From 1946-48 she served as special assistant to Senator Henry Cabot Lodge, in charge of speechwriting and press relations. Sidney and Thomas Sylvester Carroll were wed in 1947 and together raised five sons in New Canaan, CT. Sidney was known for her organic gardens, ardent support of Montessori education, and love of Vermont. Among other civic activities, she was a director of the League of Voters in New Canaan and Children's Services of Stamford, CT. In 1969, Sidney earned her Juris Doctorate from NYU School of Law and served as a staff attorney for the Juvenile Relations Division of The Legal Aid Society in New York from 1971-1981. Inspired by conversations with children from The Whitby School carpool, Sidney authored the children's book You Be The Judge. The book challenges the reader for decisions in legal cases and their precedents, and was intended to give children a better understanding of the law and its role in society. Residing in Manhattan for the past three decades, Sidney was a longstanding volunteer at the Guggenheim Museum, The Asia Society, and the English Speaking Union. Sidney's family is graced with her many original watercolor paintings and collections of ""Easy Thoughts."" She leaves behind her three siblings, James Burke, Daniel Burke, and Phyllis Burke Davis and their families; four of her sons, Jeffrey Burke Carroll, James Francis Carroll, Matthew Carroll, and Charles Laurence Carroll, her daughters in law, nine grandchildren, one great-grandchild, and her cherished caregivers. Her fifth son, Thomas Jeremiah Carroll, predeceased her; their remains rest together in Eden, VT. A celebration of Sidney's life will take place at The Whitby School, Greenwich, CT at 3pm on September 17th. In lieu of flowers, donations may be made to The Whitby School Annual Fund, 969 Lake Avenue, Greenwich, CT 06831."

But the 16 acres in Lower Manhattan are also home to a memorial to the victims of the 2001 and 1993 attacks and to a major transportation hub. Fitting these elements together has been a difficult task for architects, engineers and construction workers. Over the decade, artistic differences, political in-fighting and the desire to rein in soaring costs have brought delays and redesigns. The work is far from finished, but a centerpiece of the site, the two memorial fountains, will be open for the 10th anniversary observance. The fountains, among the largest artificial waterfalls in the world, sit where the twin towers stood. They are surrounded by a plaza that, when completed, will be an engineered forest, with hundreds of trees growing amid the glass, steel and concrete."

Lynch's sadistic cheerleading coach is not only the best character on the show, she's also the spoonful of rancor that makes the sugary earnestness go down. By keeping her churlishness at a slow boil -- half-whispered threats and singsong insults -- Lynch brings much-needed restraint to a show that features more weeping teenagers than a Justin Bieber concert.

Yet the speech is eloquent and rousing -- the warriors chant in his honor: ''Half-man! Half-man!''

Brilliantly educated at Philips Andover, Yale, and The University of Paris, he spent the first 22 years of his career from 1963 as an editor at the magazines ""This Week,"" ""Good Housekeeping,"" and ""Family Weekly."" In 1985 he began 10 years of memorable service as head of public affairs for the New York State Council on the Arts, supporting Kitty Carlisle Hart's vision and reflecting her ebullience in venues throughout the state. Since 1995 he has been the respected director of external affairs for the Bard Graduate Center: Decorative Arts, Design History, Material Culture, working to expand international coverage and initiating the Center's global travel program and its annual Iris Awards for outstanding contributions to decorative arts under founder Susan Weber. As a public affairs consultant, he advised The Metropolitan Museum of Art, The Mariners' Museum, and a host of corporate clients, while his amusing and insightful freelance pieces appeared in such national magazines as ""Omni,"" ""Conde Nast Traveler,"" and ""Travel & Leisure."" One of the most original, cultured, and highly praised travel writers of the 1980s and 90s, his books included ""The Traveler's Guide to the Hudson River Valley,"" in its fifth edition and still considered the best in its field, along with: ""The Traveler's Guide to Western New England and the Connecticut River Valley,"" and ""Virginia: A History and Guide."" He also co-edited the 2006 collection, ""The Battle of Hampton Roads: New Perspectives on the USS Monitor and CSS Virginia."" But even these accomplishments hardly begin to convey his infectious wit, his incomparable elegance, his peerless taste, and his innate modesty. He was a scholar, a gentleman, an arts champion, and a loving and endlessly delightful friend. He is survived by his partner of 46 years, and spouse of three heroic weeks, John O'Keefe."

Still, stunt-casting gets you only so far. What makes Jack's lapidary refinement and his encyclopedic savoir-faire so funny (and, let's face it, he makes Don Draper look like a used-car salesman) is that it blooms in such coarse soil -- a corporate culture more suited to crusty vulgarians like Jack's mentor hero, Don Geiss.

Born in Cincinnati, OH, Joe graduated from Yale in 1955. At Yale, he was a member of Scroll and Key, and his passion for singing led him to become both the president of the Glee Club as well as a Whiffenpoof. He went on to attend both Oxford and Yale Law School. Joe retired as a partner of Milbank, Tweed, Hadley and McCloy after 34 years with the firm. An avid amateur ornithologist, Joe traveled the world looking for exotic birds. He combined this enthusiasm with tireless fundraising for various nature organizations, and served on the boards of both the National Audubon Society and the Cornell Bird Lab. Joe was a member of the Union Club, the Quogue Beach Club, the Quogue Field Club and served on the vestry at St. James Church and on the executive committee at the Church of the Atonement in Quogue, NY. Loved and adored by his family, Joe will be remembered for his determination in all things, his deep sense of loyalty and commitment to family and friends, his quick wit, keen mind, and his enduring faith in God.

2011-09-11T00:00:00Z,"Deceptively diminutive, Archy Marshall fidgets onstage. He is 17, angsty and awkward. But he is no teeny-bopper. A pleasant dissonance arises when he opens his mouth, and from his slight body emerges a deep, rich sound. His barked out lyrics are first person and loop through cryptic, emotionally raw experiences. A dubstep influence is there, but mostly in his modern sensibility as his music is guitar-anchored. For the last year or two, Marshall has played around Britain under the name Zoo Kid, heading to gigs after school, on weekends and over holidays. This past July he played under his new moniker, King Krule, at a festival in Hyeres, France. With his second release due out in October, his seriousness is a welcome counterweight to the YouTube-driven fame of his contemporaries like Justin Bieber and Cody Simpson. ''Teenager'' need not be pejorative when it comes to lyricism. After all, Arthur Rimbaud was one. See the video for ''Out Getting Ribs,'' here:"

2011-09-11T00:00:00Z,"When Gaby Wood went to Scotland to interview David Lasnet, an osteopath and father of four, she was struck by his deep sense of gratitude and contentment. ''We're so lucky, aren't we?'' he asked her, after a day spent surfing the waves off Coldingham Sands. His words resonated with me as we finished this issue of T. I am very grateful to work with a team that brings such expertise and daring to the business of making magazines. There is, for example, our creative director, David Sebbah, who spent the summer traveling the globe in pursuit of cool portraits. He created -- with Sebastian Kim, Sara Moonves and Jacob Brown -- a ''studio'' in a tent at the Bonnaroo festival in remote Tennessee. He packed a bag with coats and headed, with the indefatigable Max Vadukul, to Manchester, Beverly Hills and Arles to spend mere minutes with the magical talents of Man United, past and present. It was his friendship with his fellow Frenchman Lasnet and Lasnet's wife, Stella Tennant, that allowed us a peek into their family life. For this issue he has been everything from a fashion assistant to a set builder; his humility and humor are astonishing. Bruce Pask, our men's fashion director, returns each season from the catwalks with a stunningly precise map of the trends and twists. He then scours New York for guys to test his expert theories on. It's a huge undertaking. This time around he roped in the cast of Lincoln Center's ''War Horse,'' among others, to wear the runway. And Jacob Brown, our features/entertainment director, is responsible for putting the people we love on the pages of T. From Richard Ashcroft to really big bands, from Cristiano Ronaldo to King Krule, we could not do it without Brown. (He picked Bonnaroo for its tripped-out Americana spirit: kids with flowers and glow ropes in their hair, and little to no commercial hoopla.)"

He was recognized as one of the world's authorities on Frederic Chopin, and he wrote three books covering the composer's compositions and life. Two works were published by Columbia University Press and the third by Yale University Press. Dr. Atwood was predeceased by his parents; his brother, Dr. Morris Atwood; and a nephew, Ronald Atwood.

2011-09-11T00:00:00Z,"Like Coco Chanel, Pierre-Henri Mattout was born in Saumur, the medieval French town in the Loire Valley famous among wine snobs for its superb cabernet franc appellation, Saumur-Champigny. The town also happens to be an equestrian center of France, home to the Cadre Noir, one of the world's most prestigious riding schools. ''It's very uptight, very bourgeois and very elegant,'' says Mattout, who, as a p'tit garcon, dreamed not of mounting a Lusitano but of being the academy's head tailor. Accordingly, Mattout's latest men's collection - all jodhpur-style chinos, leather elbow patches and whipcord wool blazers in dragoon red - is a paean to his horse-loving hometown. But rather than reboot some bygone vision of aristo chic, Mattout drew on his design experience at Dior Homme, Dunhill and Victorinox. The result is a modern sportswear collection of uncommon elegance, detail-obsessed yet refreshingly remote from the work-wear-inspired stuff that's glutting American runways. This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print."

For instance: my friends and I got shots when we went to the doctor and we hated them. But my parents stabbed themselves with needles almost every day, and seemed to enjoy it. Weird. Most of my friends' parents sounded like the adults in school or on TV when they talked. People understood them. My parents, on the other hand, had their own language, laced with a flowery slang that I picked up the same way the Puerto Rican kids could speak English at school and Spanish at home with their abuelas."

Gloria was a leader in the community development world and used her formidable life force to build organizations that made life better for thousands of New Yorkers-those who were homeless or lived in deplorable conditions or needed a hand up to get on their feet. Her activism began in 1964 when she started the Hundred Worst Buildings program in East Harlem. Over the next 40 years she helped to found many successful nonprofit groups, virtually all of which are still in operation today. They include: Adopt-a-Building; Housing Conservation Coordinators, formed to keep low-income families from being displaced during gentrification in Hell's Kitchen; the Winter Heat Fund, which lends money to low-income tenants to buy oil; the Association of Neighborhood Housing Developers, a citywide group comprising 40 neighborhood-based housing organizations; and Eviction Intervention Services, which teaches residents how to advocate on their own behalf to prevent homelessness. Add to that her involvement with senior citizen organizations, hands on training programs and umbrella coalitions, and Gloria was involved in more than 100 organizations in New York City. Her graciousness and generosity were legendary. She put both to use in the cause of community development and in the alleviation of individual misery. She loved the City and matched its energy with her own vitality. New York is a better place for her tireless efforts. We will miss her laughter and her energy and her leadership.

The leaves gave off the unmistakable scent of gasoline that is characteristic of epazote. I immediately considered the culinary possibilities: guacamole, quesadillas or black-bean dip? Epazote (Dysphania ambrosioides or Chenopodium ambrosioides), a k a pasote or pasotes, Mexican tea and wormseed, is native to Mexico and Central and South America. An annual that can grow to three or four feet, with toothed, lance-shaped leaves, epazote favors full sunlight and is an intrepid weed. I've seen it flourishing throughout the city from the summer through mid-autumn, growing in cracks of the pavement, around trees on the sidewalk and in front yards in Brooklyn."

2011-09-11T00:00:00Z,"TAFFNER--Donald L. An iconic independent distributor and producer of television programming and live theater attractions, passed peacefully on Tuesday, September 6, 2011 after a brief stay in Lenox Hill Hospital, Manhattan. Among his many achievements, he and his wife-business partner, Eleanor Bolta, were responsible for bringing such television shows to the American public as, ""Three's Company"", ""Too Close For Comfort"" and ""The Benny Hill Show."" She passed away a year ago. The quintessential American success story, Taffner grew up above his family's candy store in Brooklyn where his education in business began. Preparing the day's newspapers with his father, running telephone messages to persons throughout the neighborhood and just being ""in the store"" taught Don about getting along with and being able to talk to people...it gave him a unique set of social skills and a pronounced business attitude which held fast throughout his life. A proud graduate of St. John's College (now known as University), Don took a job in the mailroom of the William Morris Agency in 1952 and by the time he left the well-known agency in 1959, he had been an agent there for four years. In 1959 he built his expertise in television distribution by helping to begin the Television Distribution Program Department at Paramount. The Taffners were married in 1961 and in 1963 they launched D.L. Taffner Ltd, their own business. The company started out as a worldwide distributor of TV programs and later, as DLT Entertainment Ltd., expanded to TV and stage production. In 1986, Don Taffner's considerable significant contributions to the development of the industry were recognized by the International Council of the National Academy of Television Arts and Sciences, which presented him with an Emmy for its prestigious Founders Award ""for setting new levels of creativity in the worldwide exchange of television programs"". As a result of his work in television, specifically British television, Don Taffner was awarded an OBE in 2002. As an offshoot of his television business, Don became involved with the prestigious Theatre of Comedy in the UK and the company continues to own and manage the Shaftesbury Theatre on the West End. Champions of St. John's University, in 2005, Donald and Eleanor Taffner were given Johnny's Angels Awards by St. John's Bread and Life, an organization that is devoted to getting food to those who need it in Brooklyn and in Queens. In 2007, the Taffners were presented with the Spirit of Service Award for their continuing contribution to the school. Having developed a great passion for Charles Rennie Mackintosh and the Glasgow School, Don and Eleanor Taffner were presented with a Wallace award at the 'Icons of Scotland Dinner' hosted by Scotland Magazine in 2005, and were the first individuals with no hereditary connection to Scotland to ever receive the award. Donald is survived by his daughter, Karen Butler and her husband Ronald Butler, his son, Donald L. Taffner Jr. and Rhonda Cantor and three grandchildren, John, Henry and Tom Butler. A funeral service will be held on Saturday, September 10, 2011 at 10:30am at the Greenwich Village Funeral Home, 199 Bleecker Street followed by a luncheon at Villa Mosconi, 69 MacDougal Street. A Memorial Mass will be held on Saturday, September 17, 2011 at 10:30am on the St. Johns University Queens Campus conducted by Father Donald J Harrington at St. Thomas More Church. The Mass will be followed by a tribute at the Taffner Field House and luncheon.

2011-09-11T00:00:00Z,"Emilia Clarke is the nice English girl who plays Daenerys Targaryen in HBO's hugely successful pork-sword-and-sorcery drama series, ''Game of Thrones.'' In the show, which is adapted from George R. R. Martin's equally huge series of cod-medieval fantasy books, ''A Song of Ice and Fire,'' Daenerys is one of the two remaining children of the ousted Targaryen dynasty, forcibly married, aged 15, to Khal Drogo, another huge thing (played by the 6-foot-4 Hawaiian-born actor Jason Momoa), a warlord of the horse-mad Dothraki people who live beyond the Narrow Sea. When I say the Dothraki are horse-mad, I don't mean to suggest that they collect rosettes for their show ponies and enjoy nothing more than a spot of dressage, oh no. Daenerys's wedding involves a public orgy of explicit equine-style coupling, while to win a place in the dusky Dothraki's heart the platinum blonde must, gulp, eat a horse's heart, raw. Raped on her wedding night by Drogo - who resembles a mutant Klingon - Daenerys proves to be a tough-minded and shrewd operator, who quickly picks up the language of her adoptive people and learns how to please her testosterone-fueled consort from a helpful courtesan."

Scores of Americans hired tattoo artists as translators and had their bodies inscribed with the names of the lost, and with towers that never stop burning. Painted or constructed tributes, some ephemeral, flowered on walls and in fields. And around the world, tradition bearers who may have had limited access to television reports were moved to depict the events. ''Cultures that have suffered, not just terrorist attacks, but have suffered other kinds of tragedies, looked to America and Americans and New Yorkers with sympathy and empathy,'' said Felicia Katz-Harris, curator of Asian and Middle Eastern folk art at the Museum of International Folk Art.

In a survey of estimates by The New York Times, the answer is $3.3 trillion, or about $6.6 million for every dollar Al Qaeda spent planning and executing the attacks. While not all of the costs have been borne by the government -- and some are still to come -- this total equals one-fifth of the current national debt. Costs are broken down here under three main categories: direct damage, shown in blue; the two wars that followed (assuming both can be linked to the attacks), in yellow; and other types of response, in gray. Experts differ on some of these numbers, as well as what should be included in a tally. Here, no attempt has been made to account for some of the imponderables: For example, are oil prices higher because of the Iraq war?

He was predeceased by his beloved wife, Ruth, with whom he shared 62 years of marriage. He is survived by two sons, Dr. Allen M. Kaufman (wife Elizabeth), Kenneth C.

2011-09-11T00:00:00Z,"In his revelatory memoir, ''Drama'' (HarperCollins, $27), John Lithgow, the consummate character actor, talks about infidelity, Oedipal striving and the awfulness of acceptance speeches. There are many admissions in the book, most notably that in the 1970s you had eight affairs with different theater co-stars (including the ''incandescent'' Bergman muse Liv Ullmann) while married to your first wife. You likened yourself then to a ''rampaging elephant.'' How hard was it for you to reveal the affairs? Of course they were difficult to write about, and I was very ambivalent about whether to press ahead. But I made a decision: Either I'm going to write an honest book or a dishonest book. And I thought it was sort of dishonest to leave those moments out. I have good friends who read the book and said, ''My God, 90 percent of this I didn't know about.''"
2011-09-11T00:00:00Z,"An article on Aug. 21 about a visit to Russia by Kim Jong-il, the North Korea leader, misstated the history of the Kremlin's diplomatic recognition of South Korea and reduction of economic and military subsidies to North Korea. Official diplomatic ties with South Korea were established on Sept. 30, 1990, by President Mikhail S. Gorbachev of the Soviet Union -- not by Boris N. Yeltsin, who succeeded Mr. Gorbachev as president of Russia after the 1991 collapse of the Soviet Union."

''That's such a magazine question,'' he says with a groan. Like the cool subversions of men's and women's preppy classics his fast-growing label is known for (the first BOO store opens in Tokyo this winter), Sternberg's L.A. home is a playful amalgam of vintage references and bright color combinations with a winsome splash of naïveté."
2011-09-11T00:00:00Z,"Tim Coppens's first complete men's collection is a wonder not just of technical proficiency - Coppens was formerly the design director of Ralph Lauren's futuristic sportswear line, RLX - but also of economy. Coppens, a Belgian-born Royal Academy of Fine Arts grad, has no office, no employees and he's financing his 45-piece collection by himself. The design references are varied. They include a spit and polish riff on the leather jackets and baggy sweats of the Paris banlieues and also a curious repurposing of a Persian Farahan rug, which Coppens chopped up to form the back of a leather-sleeved varsity jacket. Characteristically, that jacket is assembled with almost clinical precision, but the carpet segment is left frayed on the bottom - an inspired touch. ''I don't want to be brand-marked as a technical designer,'' Coppens says. ''I want to make beautiful collections with classic fabrics. But the technical aspect gives me a good starting point.'' This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print."

Designed by Giorgetto Giugiaro, one of the auto industry's most famous stylists, the MyCar was originally intended for a manufacturer based in Hong Kong. But the diminutive E.V. is now scheduled to be produced by GreenTech Automotive, based in Mississippi, and shipped to Denmark for European distribution later this year. The MyCar project grew yet another wrinkle this month. Terry McAuliffe, GreenTech's chairman and the former chairman of the Democratic National Committee, said the car's hybrid and electric drivetrains would be built not at the brand's Chinese joint-venture plant - currently under construction in Inner Mongolia - but in Mississippi, a distinct reversal of the usual flow of manufactured goods."

Now one of the biggest names in car rentals is rolling out some new competition. Hertz's first attempt at car-sharing, Connect by Hertz, has been replaced by a new service called Hertz on Demand. The new brand introduces several appealing features aimed at both Zipsters and traditional rental car customers. First: no enrollment or membership fees. With Hertz, if you don't use a car, you don't pay - perfect for those new to car-sharing, and car owners who want the convenience of car-share type rentals away from home.

2011-09-11T00:00:00Z,"Almost 10 years ago, on New Year's Day 2002, Sir Alex Ferguson believed he had finally retired from the greatest job in English soccer: manager of the most legendary sporting club of all, Manchester United. Ferguson, who had already achieved everything he could in the game he lived for, had celebrated his 60th birthday the day before. Now he was at home, taking a nap after a long lunch, when his wife, Cathy, kicked his foot to wake him up. When he opened his eyes, Cathy was standing in front of him backed by his three adult sons. ''We've decided you're not retiring,'' she said. And that was that. This incident is remarkable for a couple of reasons. For one, it disproved the most indelible rule of sport - that there is no such thing as a second act, still less an encore. You have to know when to quit. In the decade since he withdrew his notice of retirement, Ferguson has renewed and enhanced his club's status as the most valuable sporting brand in the world, and eclipsed all younger pretenders. More important, the incident is perhaps the only recorded occasion in which Ferguson, the embodiment of both an irresistible force and an immovable object, has allowed himself to be told what to do. Cathy, his childhood sweetheart and wife of 45 years, had her reasons: ''When he's under your feet, it's a nuisance,'' she has said. ''If he's here too long, he gets in my road.''"

But most of the post-9/11 security measures have simply been embedded in the landscape and culture of the nation's capital. From the reflecting pool at the foot of the Capitol to the reflecting pool in front of the Lincoln Memorial, government cameras take pictures of citizens, who smile for Big Brother and snap their own pictures of the government cameras.

Richard Fine Art Gallery in Williamsburg, Brooklyn, in 2008, complete with a coop of live pigeons on a simulated rooftop. Growing up in Manhattan, Mr. Garn said, he was ''strongly ambivalent'' about pigeons. ''I always thought they were kind of gross and they poop everywhere,'' he said.

SVP Cantor Fitzgerald, Glenn was high above NYC in the north tower of the WTC. All he did wrong that day was to report to work; instead he became a victim of terrorism. He never had the opportunity to say goodbye. As the days, weeks, months and years have passed we have all learned to deal with our loss and grief and move slowly forward with our lives. Every 9/11 we gather to honor him and remember how caring an individual he was and how important a presence in our life he is. We miss him terribly and continue to mourn his loss everyday. We will never forget."

Was he moving logs? Mowing the lawn? No, he was efficiently transporting everything we'd need for a picnic across the lovely grounds. I had come with my children, because naturally, never having met any of us, Lasnet had invited them to stay, too. The Lasnet family already comprises four children, so - he seemed to suggest - what difference would two more make? When we arrived, there was also a family of five staying (old friends of theirs from Chile), so that was nine kids under the age of 13, and this appeared to bother the Lasnet-Tennants not at all. A small campfire had been set up by a pond, and next to it they'd erected a calico tent carpeted with random tartan blankets. Inside, the Lasnet children - Marcel, 13, Cecily, 11, Jasmine, 9, and Iris, 6 - were rolling around laughing, while the adults cooked risotto patties wrapped in bacon."

The golden ratio or phi (1.61803...) is a fascinating number that we have explored before in the puzzles, Moonlighting Triangles and The Golden Ratio Treasure. The ratio, which is approached to greater and greater precision by two adjacent numbers of the related Fibonacci sequence (1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13...), has become part of popular culture, attaining almost mystical status. Images and video clips like the one above abound on the Internet, connecting the golden ratio and the Fibonacci sequence with art, architecture, cosmology, biology, aesthetics, poetry, music and many other fields. But how much of all this is true and how much is myth? Professor Devlin, who recently published a scholarly book titled The Man of Numbers: Fibonacci's Arithmetic Revolution, examined the evidence with a scientific eye and separated the wheat from the chaff. I present some of his findings below - in the form of questions to you, of course."

Because Tommy does that healthy, American girl with bouncy hair, and I'm doing something very clean, very sharp, and very chic."" This shift from previous seasons (it was Souleiman who was behind those healthy, bouncy heads of hair at the fall 2011 show) was implemented through flat ironing strands with the help of Wella's Shine Finish, which he called ""liquid gold,"" then tucking hair back behind the ears before pulling it into a low ponytail tied with a thin black elastic. To achieve a graphic but not hard, product-y look, Souleiman squirted a bit of Wella Professionals Stay Essential Finishing Spray on a brush blush before running it over the surface of the hair to smooth down flyaways. As it turns out, it takes almost as much work to not reinvent the wheel as it does to invent it; as he noted, ""It's so easy to do something really wacky - I could do that with my eyes shut. But to think of something that has a subtlety and beauty to it, it's so much harder."""

Better yellow and geometry than another repeat reference, though the look wasn't totally different from last time around. ""This collection's an evolution from last season, not a complete change,"" Orlando Pita said. ""The hair has that feeling too."" This meant a low side-parted ponytail instead of hair pulled back at the crown without a visible barrette. ""Clean, simple lines,"" is how Pita described the look he created using Phyto Volume Active Mousse, blow drying with a T3 featherweight Luxe, then sealing the ends with Phyto 7 and a T3 Single Pass iron. The hair was then scraped back into a ponytail with a part over the right eye. Pita used Phyto Finishing Spray and a little Shine Defining Wax to ""make it perfectly done."" Nails were painted Estée Lauder's Nude Attitude, but it was the eyes that went a little wild. Tom Pecheux (Estée Lauder's creative makeup director) explained the Neutra connection by making references to large windows that ""let the outdoor weather into the house,"" which became a ray of yellow from Estée Lauder Rain Boots shadow on the lid highlighted with Cyber Copper brown shimmer all the way to the brow bone. Citron Kiss lip gloss was the final step. Canary colored in the vial, it's the perfect way to warm up another lip color or let the light in for spring."

2011-09-12T00:00:00Z,"In the early days of the Cuban missile crisis, before the world knew that the cold war seemed to be sliding toward nuclear conflict, President John F. Kennedy telephoned his wife, Jacqueline, at their weekend house in Virginia. From his voice, she would say later, she could tell that something was wrong. Why don't you come back to Washington? he asked, without explanation. ''From then on, it seemed there was no waking or sleeping,'' Mrs. Kennedy recalls in an oral history scheduled to be released Wednesday, 47 years after the interviews were conducted. When she learned that the Soviets were installing missiles in Cuba aimed at American cities, she begged her husband not to send her away. ''If anything happens, we're all going to stay right here with you,'' she says she told him in October 1962. ''I just want to be with you, and I want to die with you, and the children do, too -- than live without you.''"
2011-09-12T00:00:00Z,"North American moviegoers, jumping at the chance to see Gwyneth Paltrow and a host of other stars die of a horrible disease, drove ''Contagion'' to No. 1 at the weekend box office with an estimated $23 million in ticket sales. That Warner Brothers film, directed by Steven Soderbergh and made in conjunction with Participant Media, cost about $60 million to produce; an all-star cast (Kate Winslet, Matt Damon, Laurence Fishburne and Jude Law in addition to Ms. Paltrow) and strong reviews contributed to audience interest. ''The Help'' (DreamWorks Studios) was second, taking in about $8.7 million for a five-week total of $137 million, according to Hollywood.com, which compiles box-office statistics. ''Warrior,'' a mixed martial arts drama from Lionsgate, was a disappointing third with about $5.6 million in ticket sales. ''The Debt'' (Focus Features) took in roughly $5 million for fourth place, lifting its two-week total to $22 million. ''Colombiana'' (Sony Pictures Entertainment) was fifth with about $4 million in ticket sales and a new three-week total of $29.8 million. On the gloomy side, ''Bucky Larson: Born to be a Star,'' a Sony comedy produced by Adam Sandler's company, took in just $1.5 million and placed far outside the top 10.

Pouha, a nose tackle, put pressure on the Cowboys' inexperienced offensive line. And he recovered a crucial fumble, falling on Tony Romo's dropped ball by the goal line in the fourth quarter. Mike DeVito, caused the fumble, but Pouha wrested it away, stalling a potential scoring drive. NOTABLE NUMBER So much for ground-and-pound. The Jets ran the ball eight times in the first half, three times in the third quarter and 16 times over all, for 45 yards, as they instead entrusted Mark Sanchez and his right arm with moving the ball downfield. Only one of the Jets' first downs came on the ground. It was a poor omen for Shonn Greene, anointed the team's primary ball-carrier and lavished with praise by Rex Ryan and his staff."

Some feared that teaching pop would ""dumb down"" music education, others felt it was vital to make music education more relevant to children. I'd like to clarify some misconceptions and explain why I think the program is a valuable addition, rather than a threat to the classical tradition."

(Who wants to step over people sitting around on poufs just to get to the check-in desk?) And if the roof had a pool, even better. The latest refinement of the trend is La Piscine, the pool bar and restaurant on top of the new Hôtel Americano. Reached directly from the street by an external glass elevator (part of the building's striking design by Enrique Norten), the 10-stories-up space looks north and east over the glamorously gritty cityscape of industrial Chelsea and west toward a slice of the Hudson. In warm weather, the grill sends out Greek-style octopus, lamb chops and baba ghanouj, the bar slings mojitos and mezcalitos, and the stereo plays a set list devised by Bebel Gilberto. In winter, a big glass garage door will swing down to seal off the glass-roofed dining area, sheepskin will cover the butterfly chairs, and the menu will shift to fondue and hot sake. Even the pool will be winterized. Open only to guests during the day, the four-foot-deep oasis will become a hot tub, complete with ultrathick robes and slippers. Explaining the après-ski vibe, one of the hotel's owners, Carlos Couturier, says, ""It's the first time we're doing a wintertime hotel. All the rest are in Mexico."" The Americano, part of the Mexico City-based Habita group, expects to welcome a largely Latin American clientele (most of the staff are from South America) - who, it could be assumed, do a lot of outdoor living (but may not yet know from snow).

On Monday, production began on ''Quartet,'' Mr. Hoffman's feature-directing debut, its press representatives announced. The film, which is expected to shoot for nine weeks in Buckinghamshire, England, stars Tom Courtenay (whose previous films include ''Doctor Zhivago'' in 1965), Billy Connolly (''Mrs. Brown'') and Pauline Collins (''Shirley Valentine'') as residents of a home for retired opera singers. Their annual plans for a fund-raising concert, held on Verdi's birthday, are disrupted by the arrival of a down-on-her-luck grande dame (played by Maggie Smith, the ''Downton Abbey,'' ''Gosford Park'' and ''Harry Potter'' star). The screenplay for ''Quartet'' is by Ronald Harwood, the Academy Award-winning screenwriter of ''The Pianist'' and ''The Diving Bell and the Butterfly,'' and adapted from his play of the same title. Mr. Hoffman is also a producer on the film, which is financed by BBC Films, DCM Productions and Decca. An American distributor and release date for ''Quartet'' were not immediately announced.

2011-09-13T00:00:00Z,"As Gov. Rick Perry of Texas was assailed by some rivals for the Republican presidential nomination at Monday night's debate for his exaggerated claim that Social Security is a ''Ponzi scheme,'' he also seemed to be debating himself at times. Mr. Perry used the debate to talk about the need to shore up Social Security, which politicians of all stripes agree is needed if the program is to continue paying out full benefits a quarter century from now. In making his case, Mr. Perry adopted a very different tone from what he did in his book ''Fed Up'' just a year ago, when he described Social Security as a failure that ''we have been forced to accept for more than 70 years now.''"
2011-09-13T00:00:00Z,"Anthony Bourdain, the celebrity chef, author and reality TV star, will acquire books for Ecco, an imprint of HarperCollins, the publisher said on Monday. Mr. Bourdain has been given a line of books that is expected to release three to five titles each year, which Ecco said in a statement would ''reflect his remarkably eclectic tastes.'' Daniel Halpern, the president and publisher of Ecco, said that Mr. Bourdain has been an informal adviser to him for about 10 years, a period during which Mr. Bourdain's own books were published by Ecco. ''His intuition has been unerring - suggesting such authors as Ferran Adria and Fergus Henderson,'' Mr. Halpern said in an e-mail. ''Now he's becoming one of us, sort of.'' The deal is similar to Chelsea Handler's imprint at Grand Central Publishing, which was announced last year. While most publishing imprints are sparingly bestowed on influential editors who have worked in the industry for decades, handing an imprint to a celebrity author is something different: an opportunity for publishers to express their loyalty to their own authors, receive their editorial input and benefit, they hope, from the publicity and attention the celebrity authors can bring to the books they are acquiring."

A report had surfaced citing an internal I.M.F. document estimating that Europe's banks were woefully short of capital - by a whopping $273.2 billion. ''Misreporting,'' Ms. Lagarde insisted, before awkwardly describing the number as ''tentative.'' Then she went even further, saying that the number ''is not a stress test that the I.M.F. conducts nor is it the global capital need for European banking institutions.'' She added, ''We are currently in discussions with our European partners to assess the global methodology until we reach a tentative draft. It will be published before the end of September.''"

Then it turned even larger, with requests for a $1 million, air-conditioned glass building to house the expansive artworks."

2011-09-13T00:00:00Z,"9 P.M. (ABC) JACQUELINE KENNEDY: IN HER OWN WORDS Diane Sawyer reports on the release of eight hours of recordings made of Mrs. Kennedy by the historian Arthur M. Schlesinger Jr. in 1964, shortly after the assassination of President John F. Kennedy. The conversations, which were sealed until now, include Mrs. Kennedy's impressions of life with her husband (above, the couple in 1961) and events that shaped his administration, including their early years on the campaign trail, the Cuban missile crisis, the attempted invasion at the Bay of Pigs and the president's last days. The interviews reflect her evolving sense of self and her role as first lady, as she talks about her family, world leaders and life in the White House. Ms. Sawyer also speaks with Caroline Kennedy about her parents. The report coincides with the publication on Wednesday of the book ''Jacqueline Kennedy: Historic Conversations on Life with John F. Kennedy.'' 5:45 P.M. (MoreMax) (500) DAYS OF SUMMER (2009) Tom Hansen (Joseph Gordon-Levitt) is an ''unapologetic believer in true love, soul mates and other touchstones of greeting-card mythology (and romantic comedy ideology),'' A. O. Scott wrote in The New York Times. Summer Finn (Zooey Deschanel), he said, is ''skeptical of such notions and refuses to promise commitment or even consistency, but she does seem to want more and more of Tom's company, and this leads him to believe that her carefully maintained barriers to intimacy are beginning to fall.'' That pretty much sums up this Marc Webb movie."

""It's pretty,"" Hanne Gaby said of her tousled hair braided with black leather. ""I don't think I'd be able to do it, though."" Luckily, Orlando Pita was there to help create the look that came about based on one of Kors's fantasy stories.

""They groom themselves,"" said Pita. ""The front is all they can see."" This explains why the hair around the face was more tidy, parted in the middle, while the back was wild and messy. Orlando's own Dry Shampoo was used with Bumble and Bumble Surf Spray to coat the hair before braiding. The tail was then teased up between the lacing and Pita's Elevate Texture Spray added. The model Magdalena Frackowiak offered a way to translate the look to her own routine: ""braid it loosely and then pull bits out."""

Famous for his design of Marina City, the striking twin circular apartment towers that were completed in 1967 in downtown Chicago, Goldberg (1913-1997) - who took courses at the Bauhaus and briefly apprenticed to Mies van der Rohe in Berlin in the early 1930s - was also known for his innovative designs for low-cost housing, hospitals and prefabricated structures for everything from dwellings to mobile medical facilities during World War II. And his village-like spatial configurations for both education and medical facilities were well ahead of their time. The exhibition was curated by Zoe Ryan, the chair of the museum's architecture and design department, and Alison Fisher, an assistant curator of architecture in the department, with Elizabeth Smith, the executive director of curatorial affairs at the Art Gallery of Ontario. The installation was designed by John Ronan Architects - who recently completed the elegant new headquarters of the Poetry Foundation in Chicago - with a graphic design by Studio Blue. Accompanying the Goldberg show is a photography exhibition called ""Inside Marina City: A Project by Iker Gil and Andreas E.G. Larsson,"" which offers visitors a rare glimpse inside the iconic towers, with more than 30 images that explore the relationship between Goldberg's modular framework for the buildings and the way that residents live in the spaces he designed."

The question of how to increase federal disaster aid, and by how much, has raised some controversy on Capitol Hill in recent days because many Republicans would like to see any increase in aid offset by federal spending cuts. The House plans to include new disaster aid in a short-term spending plan that is expected to hit that chamber's floor next week, with far lower levels expected and a possible offset though cuts to an auto loan program."

That is, until she meets Ivan (Sergi López), a Spanish day laborer hired to help renovate a stone shed where her new office will be. Soon enough, Suzanne is abandoning almost everything for love, with Samuel threatening to take away the rest if she doesn't stop this foolishness.

(Even if he's ready to return late in the season, the Colts may be out of the playoff hunt by then, so why risk re-injury by rushing him back?

Johnson, Richard Nixon, Jimmy Carter and Ronald Reagan, so we'll assume that in a newly announced remake of this film, they'll disguise themselves as Bill Clinton, George W. Bush, Barack Obama and Hu Jintao of China. That's just a guess, but we can tell you for certain that the original ''Point Break'' was directed by Kathryn Bigelow, the future Academy Award-winning director of ''The Hurt Locker,'' and starred Keanu Reeves as a young F.B.I. agent on the trail of the ''Ex-Presidents'' gang, whose philosophical leader is played by Patrick Swayze. The new version was announced late Monday by Alcon Entertainment, a production and finance company based at Warner Brothers, which has been on a rebooting binge; last month the company announced that it was producing a new ''Blade Runner'' film that could serve as a sequel or prequel to Ridley Scott's original movie. Alcon said in a news release that ''Point Break'' 2.0 ''is set in the world of international extreme sports, and like the original involves an undercover F.B.I. agent infiltrating a criminal ring, but plot points beyond that have not been revealed by the filmmakers.'' The screenplay will be by Kurt Wimmer, whose credits include a coming remake of the science-fiction action movie ''Total Recall'' that stars Colin Farrell. No director has been chose and no laconic, muscle-bound young star has been announced to play the lead, but we'll surmise that Taylor Lautner's phone is ringing off the hook."

Janikowski routinely kicks 65-yarders in practice, and made one from 70 in pregame warm-ups Monday. But the best part of the kick might have come before Janikowski trotted out to take it. With 17 seconds left, the Raiders declined the chance to get him a little closer and instead ran Michael Bush right for no gain.

But Week 1 isn't meaningless, and no team knows that better than the Chiefs. Last season, Kansas City pulled off the biggest upset in Week 1 and rode a hot start directly into a division championship. This past weekend, no team exceeded expectations like the Buffalo Bills. The Bills were initially listed as 6.5-point underdogs to the Chiefs, although speculation about Matt Cassel's injury drove the point spread down to 3.5 points by kickoff. But by either measure, a 34-point victory was nothing short of shocking. The Bills covered the point spread by either 40.5 or 37.5 points, depending on your perspective. The largest opening day ''cover'' in modern history came in 1997, when the Jets shocked the Seattle Seahawks, 41-3. The Jets were coming off a 1-15 season and were 6.5-point underdogs in Bill Parcells' first game with the team. The season ultimately ended with a 9-7 mark."

2011-09-15T14:30:47Z,"On what's supposed to be the last day of summer weather, a cool breeze was appropriately the inspiration for Odile Gilbert's hair backstage at Phillip Lim. After coating strands with Kérastase Fibre Architecte, a yet to be released product that's both a texturizer and a treatment conditioner, she parted straightened hair on the side and separated it into two low ponytails. These were then knotted at the neck and four little strands were pinned to the head as if blown back by a gust of wind. Perhaps in an allusion to the raincoats in the collection, nails were painted a custom blend of CND Raspberry Parfait, Guava and Speedy top coat. Francelle Daly for Nars created what she described as ""dewy, fresh, skin"" with Radiant Tinted Moisturizer intended to contrast ""a edgy, heavy metallic eye."" Night Life shadow was applied in the crease to make a demi lune; underneath it, a hollow of bare skin. The silver Paris Duo was used along the eyebrow and Rue Bonaparte neutral liner in the duct. Not one but six coats of mascara were applied to lashes. ""Romantic and rebel,"" is how Daly explained this juxtaposition. Lips were covered in concealer and topped with Gaiete blush to create color in a fresh way. You know, these things change with the wind."

Sure, ghostwriters have something to do with this, but at least ""Outrageous!"" was about Charles Barkley - a controversial N.B.A. Hall of Famer who played with and against some of the league's all-time greats. What has always confounded me is the sheer number of ordinary, even journeyman athletes who cash in by documenting their rise to midlevel greatness between hard covers. But since so many of them do it, here are my favorites. (Intentionally missing is Jim Bouton's totally awesome, gossip-laden ""Ball Four."" Though Bouton was the definition of a mediocre player, he remains the Homer of the genre he created. Simply put, it's not fair to compare him to anyone.)"

Too often, Marc by Marc gets swept under the rug, lost in a sea of shows. But giving it prime time placement enabled more people to see it (except for those who did not get the word that the show would start precisely on time). And this happened to be a really good season, with clothes that reflected better workmanship and clearer designs than I've seen in the past. Often, the denim-and-chinos heavy secondary lines from designers, Mr. Jacobs included, can look a little mass."

And while Mr. Liebis and Mike Betit, the owner of the farm, in Burlington, Vt., did indeed travel between New York and Vermont on business, they said they did not do so five times a week, though they continue to disagree about how many trips they did make. They met as early as 2006, not in 2009. And at the time the two formed a partnership, Mr. Betit was selling at three greenmarkets, not one. These errors were raised with The Times in April. This correction was first delayed because e-mails went astray and later because of research. Because of an editing error, two picture captions on Wednesday with an article about a conflict over an affordable housing project in Woodstock, N.Y., were reversed in some copies. Iris York, an opponent of the project, was shown at the right, standing on the perimeter of the complex site. And Susan Goldman, a supporter, was at the left, in a cafe."
2011-09-15T00:00:00Z,"For nearly 40 years, several much-larger-than-life neighborhood advocates have been battling the establishment from a wall overlooking a West 46th Street playground. Turning against the ravages of drug abuse and the juggernaut of slum clearance, they carry blueprints, flowers and a manifesto - ''We the people demand control of our communities'' - into a rainbow-anointed future. The mural where they have done battle - ''Against Domestic Colonialism,'' by Arnold Belkin (1930-1992) - hasn't fared so well."

The packed house lacked the usual star wattage of New York Fashion Week (the celebrity contingent included Jennifer Love Hewitt, Andie MacDowell, Thomas Jane, the guest judge L'Wren Scott and two of the ''Mob Wives''), but the crowd seemed content to be in the presence of the real stars of the event: the judges. Before the show, more than a few fans crowded around the seats where Michael Kors, Heidi Klum and Nina Garcia would soon sit and pass judgment, some taking iPhone photos of the empty seats with the judges' names listed on placards."

2011-09-15T00:00:00Z,"9 P.M. (CW) THE SECRET CIRCLE After her mother dies in a fire, Cassie Blake (Britt Robertson, above with Louis Hunter), a seemingly normal teenager, is sent to live with her grandmother (Ashley Crow) in beautiful Chance Harbor, Wash., where everyone seems to know more about Cassie than she knows about herself. Including her hidden abilities. Thomas Dekker plays the warlock who helps her harness her magic. Mike Hale wrote in The New York Times, ''Pretty young characters in a picturesque location (British Columbia standing in for Washington State), coming of age to a pop soundtrack; dead or vanished parents; latent paranormal abilities; local hangout; small-town secrets -- it's the entire supernatural teenage soap opera template, but the execution is rushed and chintzy, without the languorous gloss that makes 'The Vampire Diaries' worthwhile.'' That show's Season 3 premiere leads in at 8. 1:40 P.M. (Sundance) THE MATADOR (2008) As a boy in Granada, Spain, David Fandila (right) would fight imaginary bulls with his mother's dish towels. He grew up to confront real bulls, some weighing 1,300 pounds or more, to his mother's dismay. This documentary from Stephen Higgins and Nina Gilden Seavey chronicles Mr. Fandila's quest to reach 100 fights in a single season, a goal only 12 matadors had achieved. ''Barbaric, elegant, primitive, erotic, revolting, thrilling: the movie, like bullfighting itself, is all of these,'' Jeannette Catsoulis wrote in The Times. ''Blessed with a charismatic leading man, an arcane setting (bullfighting has roots in Roman sacrificial religion) and a narrative steeped in blood and hand-to-hoof combat -- not to mention a triumphant six-bull climax -- the film is a Hemingway fantasy.''"

At Lincoln Center, in Chelsea and all around town, designers signaled their optimism in a joyfully gaudy palette of cobalt blue, caution yellow, violet and searing chartreuse. Some, like Peter Som, Jason Wu and Nicole Miller, offered cheery mash-ups of pink and teal, purple and scarlet and assorted tints of rain-forest green. Their collections teemed with cabbage roses, outsize peonies and, in the case of Rodarte, van Gogh-inspired sunflowers meant to put a smile on the dourest of Fashion Week veterans."

2011-09-16T14:00:49Z,"""The New Teen Titans"" omnibus, Vol. 1, sits atop the hardcover list this week. It reprints the first 16 issues of the 1980s series that brought together a few sidekick heroes (Robin, Kid Flash and Wonder Girl) and teamed them with some new ones (Cyborg, Raven and Starfire). These Titans, written by Marv Wolfman and illustrated by George Pérez, become one of DC's most popular books. The stories reprinted in this omnibus edition chronicle the formation of the team, faceoffs with the assassin Deathstroke and the Fearsome Five, a misguided confrontation with the Justice League and a battle royal against Trigon, a demon who is also Raven's father. About midway in there is a ""day in the life"" story that focused on the civilian lives of the heroes. That issue cemented this series as doing something different: the creative team was developing three-dimensional characters and exploring new directions."
2011-09-16T14:00:47Z,"It's fitting that an artist whose work hinged so scrupulously on process - elaborate, showy, delicate process - would be drawn to photography as a medium. Robert Rauschenberg's paintings often incorporated many elements: premade images, junk, animal matter, all smothered in paint. They weren't paintings so much as developments, events, narratives of the process that produced them. There were the ""Combines,"" which involved scraps of found items, clippings, stuffed creatures and silk-screens. Some works smashed the wall separating painting and sculpture. He once erased a drawing by his friend Willem de Kooning. Another time, he covered a painting acquired by John Cage in all black. In 1961, his submission to a show of portraits dedicated to the gallery owner and curator Iris Clert consisted of a telegram, stating, ""This is a portrait of Iris Clert if I say so."" The power of the work is diminished without taking note of the process. And photography, trapping light on a sensitive surface and using chemical wizardry to turn it into a printed image, is nothing if not about process."

Nails went the way of the lady, as well.

In attendance will be President Dmitri Medvedev and other heads of state, who will finally see what $760 million restores. It took more than 3,500 workers to restore the Apollo and the Muses ceiling piece, replicate the missing Villeroy & Boch tiles and hang 617 pounds of crystal from the main chandelier. Much of the work was supervised by the president's office itself, which stepped in when construction faltered in 2009, after a contractor was paid three times for the same work. Now the acoustics are fixed, subterranean hydraulic stages are built, and, for the finishing touch, the Romanov coat of arms has been reinstated above the lintels, in place of the hammer and sickle."
2011-09-16T09:00:31Z,"Eagles (1-0) at Falcons (0-1)Sunday, 8:20 p.m.Line: Eagles by 2 1/2In honor of Michael Vick's return to Atlanta, the Eagles have starting using their 1989 throwback offense. The scheme pays homage to Randall Cunningham's glory days. The Eagles do not really drive down the field; they just string together amazing highlights, interspersing the occasional punt or baffling mistake. A typical play begins with two defenders knifing untouched through Philadelphia's porous, inexperienced offensive line. Vick either gets flattened or performs some Matrix-style escape, scrambling for a big gain or tossing to a receiver who used the confusion to get wide open. Andy Reid calls for a timeout four or five times per half to impose order (teams only get three timeouts per half, but a 5-yard penalty is a small price to pay for the chance to install a precisely designed sequence of plays for Vick to scrap)."

To make the map function effectively, a few geographic liberties were taken, something that didn't sit well with New Yorkers."

Mr. Polanski, the director of films including ''Rosemary's Baby,'' ''Chinatown'' and ''The Pianist'' was arrested at the request of the United States when he arrived in 2009 at the Zurich airport en route to the festival. Prosecutors in Los Angeles and Washington were seeking to extradite the filmmaker, who fled the United States in 1978 to avoid facing punishment after he pleaded guilty one year earlier to having sex with a 13-year-old girl. Mr. Polanski spent several months under house arrest in Gstaad before Swiss prosecutors said they would not extradite him. The organizers of the Zurich festival, who plan to present Mr. Polanski with his award on Sept. 27, said in a statement, ''We have always been tremendous admirers of his work and we are delighted that we will soon be able to express this to him in person.'' Mr. Polanski's new film, ''Carnage,'' an adaptation of the stage play ''God of Carnage,'' will be the opening night film at the New York Film Festival on Sept. 30, and the director is the subject of a retrospective now running at the Museum of Modern Art."

On Friday, the King's Head Theater in London plans to open its production of ''Constance,'' a play that its Web site describes as ''Oscar Wilde's final play.'' The theater says the play, about an industrialist, his loyal wife and her extended family, was written by Wilde after his release from prison in 1897 and given to the actress Cora Brown Potter, who in turn gave it to the French writer Guillot de Saix.

After all his training, Dr. Charash opened up an office on Long Island limited to the practice of pediatric neurology.

2011-09-17T00:00:00Z,"8 P.M. (HBO) HEREAFTER (2010) Clint Eastwood imagines what happens after we're gone by braiding together three story lines, each involving a collision between the living and the dead. In San Francisco George Lonegan (Matt Damon, above), who receives messages from the deceased loved ones of anyone he touches, decides to live a life of obscurity instead of cashing in on his gift. In London Marcus, a solemn boy, feels the presence of his twin, Jason, whose violent death has left Marcus adrift. (The brothers are played by George and Frankie McLaren.) And in Paris Marie Lelay (Cécile de France), a television journalist who nearly died in the 2004 tsunami in South Asia, is convinced that she has seen a metaphysical reality the rest of the world is determined to ignore. ''Persuasion is not really the point, though if anyone could make me believe in ghosts, it would be Clint Eastwood,'' A. O. Scott said in The New York Times of this film, written by Peter Morgan (''Frost/Nixon,'' ''The Queen''). ''What does seem new -- newly strange, newly beautiful -- is what 'Hereafter' makes of the here and now,'' Mr. Scott added. ''It is a curious movie in both senses of the word: an unusual experience and an open-ended inquiry into something nobody can really claim to understand. It leaves you wondering, which may be the most fitting way of saying that it's wonderful.'' 9 P.M. (Animal Planet) TOO CUTE!

The passage should read: Leslie Feist, the songwriter who records as Feist, led a visitor up a winding trail to a hilltop with expansive views of treetops and a reservoir. Bounding ahead were her two mongrel dogs: the white Sasha, described by her owner as ''hyperemotional, sometimes gets depressed,'' and the black Bentley, who's ''just out for a good time.'' Feist added, ''They're both like me.'' Along the path Feist mentioned lyrics -- from her new album, ''Metals'' (Cherrytree/Interscope) -- inspired by the view. ''River dam, lake fills up the land,'' she recited. ''Climb up to the lookout.'' She laughed. ''I can't believe I'm doing the cheesy self-quoting thing.''

Ros graduated from Russell Sage College in 1941 and received her MLS in Library Science from C.W. Post.

She was a great clipper and sender of articles from the New York Times which she hoped would motivate her children and grandchildren. Ros loved New York City, books, theater, film, museums and traveling. She cherished friends and family who returned those feelings in kind. Donations may be made to The Five Towns Senior Center and Planned Parenthood of New York City. A private memorial service will be planned."

2011-09-18T00:00:00Z,"Naturalism is the philosophical theory that treats science as our most reliable source of knowledge, and scientific method as the most effective route to knowledge. It is now a dominant approach in several areas of philosophy: ethics, epistemology, philosophy of mind, philosophy of science and, most of all, metaphysics, the study of the basic constituents of reality. Metaphysics is important: if it turns out that reality contains only the kinds of things that hard science recognizes, the implications will be grave for what we value in human experience. Perhaps the most notable thing about naturalism is the way its philosophers have employed Darwin's theory of natural selection to tame purpose. In 1784 Kant wrote, ''There will never be a Newton for the blade of grass.'' What he meant was that physical science could never explain anything with a purpose, whether it be human thought or a flower's bending toward the sun. That would have made everything special about living things -- especially us -- safe from a purely scientific understanding. It would have kept questions about humanity the preserve of religion, mythmaking and the humanities."

2011-09-18T00:00:00Z,"Saturday Morning at the Museum When I was growing up, Saturday mornings meant one thing only to me: a trip to the Boston Museum of Science. I loved science -- still do -- and there was nowhere else I'd rather be. The museum's instructors would give these fascinating two-hour lectures and demonstrate the laws of physics using hands-on experiments. They would also quiz us on the museum's exhibits, and all the kids would try to show off by having every answer. Those visits to the museum stretched my mind in ways that my schoolwork didn't. They taught me to listen, question, test and analyze. Figuring out how things work -- and how they can work better -- is what led me to become an engineer, a technology entrepreneur, a philanthropist and a mayor. I guess I can count my lucky stars that there were no Saturday morning cartoons when I was kid. Mayor, New York City"

Bounding ahead were her two mongrel dogs: the white Sasha, described by her owner as ''hyperemotional, sometimes gets depressed,'' and the black Bentley, who's ''just out for a good time.'' Feist added, ''They're both like me.'' Along the path Feist mentioned lyrics -- from her new album, ''Metals'' (Cherrytree/Interscope) -- inspired by the view.

The five properties, with combined asking prices of $18.8 million, are going on the market this weekend.

2011-09-18T00:00:00Z,"I have never seen Bertrand Blier's raucous, lyrical road comedy ''Going Places'' without noticing at least one audience member stalking out in disgust. In a way that's an honest reaction. Mr. Blier means to rough you up, just as his two loutish heroes rough up the people they encounter. It's not bullying, more like someone telling you not to worry if you get grease on your pressed shirt or dirt under your nails. Mr. Blier means to make us feel more alive, more in touch with simple, sensual, irresponsible pleasure. Gérard Depardieu's Jean-Claude and Patrick Dewaere's Pierrot are dirty enough for Henry Miller, but they also could be offspring of D. H. Lawrence's happy idiot. In their dumb, brutish way they revere the familiar mystery of sex and are in awe of nature."

''I'm disappointed that Mr. Carter gave such short notice to Chelsea Handler in his article. While it's true that late-night talk shows continue to be dominated by men, Ms. Handler has emerged as a force to be reckoned with. In addition to her show, which Mr. Carter briefly acknowledged as occasionally beating Conan O'Brien's ratings during the summer, Ms. Handler has had four books in recent years on the New York Times best-seller list. No other late-night host can boast the same. And she's sold out theaters nationwide as a comic headliner.''"

Dr. Charash graduated from Cornell University, Phi Beta Kappa and from Cornell Medical School, Alpha Omega Alpha. After completing a residency program in pediatrics at the Massachusetts General Hospital, he served as a Captain in the United States Air Force from 1952 to 1954. After returning from service, he completed another year of training in pediatrics at the New York Hospital-Cornell Medical Center in New York. After this training, Cornell devised a fellowship for him in pediatric neurology. It was the first such fellowship in that specialty in New York State. After all his training, Dr. Charash opened up an office on Long Island limited to the practice of pediatric neurology. He served on the faculty of Cornell University Medical College as Associate ClinicalProfessor of Pediatrics and as a Consultant in Child Neurology at as many as 20 hospitals. He was the first physician to be sent to Brazil by the United States Government to start a Cerebral Palsy Center in Sao Paulo. He served as the National Chairman of the Medical Advisory Committee of the Muscular Dystrophy Association for decades, as well as being a member of their Board of Directors. He appeared on the Jerry Lewis Labor Day Telethon every year since its inception, until he retired four years ago, informing the public of the latest medical breakthroughs and treatment. He, also, chaired international meetings on neuromuscular disorders for the MDA. And, in addition to all the medical societies to which he belonged, Dr. Charash was a member of the Child Neurology Society and the American Academy of Cerebral Palsy and Developmental Medicine. He was much beloved by his patients, his office staff and all who knew him. He loved being a physician and has helped countless familes at their time of distress and need. He will be sorely missed by his very devoted and loving family, his nieces and nephews, cousins and his friends. The funeral will take place at Guttermans, 8000 Jericho Turnpike, Woodbury at Noon on Sunday, September l8th. In lieu of flowers, the family would appreciate contributions in his memory to the Gurwin Jewish Healthcare Foundation, UJA-Federation, The Muscular Dystrophy Association, North Shore Synagogue or the charity of one's choice."
2011-09-18T00:00:00Z,"Buster Keaton has the most noble, solemn and honest face of all 20th-century film comedians, a face that says, ''Nothing bad should ever happen to me.'' But, of course, faces like that are magnets for all manner of trials and troubles, and in the silent movie ''Seven Chances'' Keaton, who also directs, plays a lowly businessman whose firm will fall to ruin unless he can raise a lot of cash quickly. Happily, he learns he stands to inherit $7 million -- but only if he can find a bride by 7 o'clock that evening. Keaton does have a true love, played by Ruth Dwyer, but a misunderstanding has separated them, leaving him to conduct a series of rushed bridal auditions. This trim little movie's glorious extended finale consists of Keaton's outrunning first a stampede of eager brides-to-be (their makeshift veils constitute a kind of tribal uniform), and then, as he skedaddles down a steep hill on the way to his one true love, a mini-avalanche of boulders. The sequence is a marvel of physical comedy, rendered in wide shot with very judicious cutting. We get to see it all, Keaton's arms and legs a windmilling whirlwind of motion as he flees the throng of bloodthirsty womenfolk. Nothing bad should ever happen to a guy with a face like Keaton's, but in ''Seven Chances'' he triumphs by running like the dickens. They had faces then, but they also had legs.

2011-09-18T00:00:00Z,"In a recent article, The New York Times Magazine implied that Pastor John Hagee has a favorite candidate in the 2012 presidential election. Like most Americans,Hagee has not yet decided whom he will support. Contrary to what is written, Hagee has never referred to Catholicism as a''godless theology of hate.'' When he used those words, Hagee was referring to general Christian anti-Semitism, not to any particular denomination.Further, the coverage asserts that Hagee has a poor relationship with the Catholic community.This is also untrue. Bill Donohue,the president of the Catholic League, very recently put out a press release entitled ''Pastor John Hagee Deserves Better Than False Accusations,'' in which he directly refutes such assertions.The article also grossly over simplifies a sermon Hagee gave concerning the Holocaust and the rise of modern Israel. While some took offense to the sermon, the coverage fails to mention that in Hagee's subsequent reconciliation with the Anti-Defamation League, it's national director, Abe Foxman,thanked Hagee, the founder of the largest pro-Israel group in America, for having ''devoted [his]life to combating anti-Semitism and supporting the State of Israel.''

2011-09-18T00:00:00Z,"FRIEDENBERG--Daniel Meyer, a financier, collector, historian and philanthropist died on August 28 in Portland, Oregon. He was 88 and had recently moved to Portland from Greenwich, Connecticut to be closer to family. Daniel Meyer Friedenberg was born on February 24, 1923, in Mt. Vernon, New York and grew up on Manhattan's upper east side, where his father, Samuel Friedenberg, a Jewish immigrant from Poland, ran a commercial building enterprise. Daniel received his B.S. from the Wharton School of Finance and Commerce at the University of Pennsylvania in 1943 and enlisted in the Army where he served from 1943-1944. After the war Daniel traveled the world, an experience that changed him forever and rooted him as a world citizen. Called home to take over the family business, Dan earned his living in real estate development and management in New York City, where he headed John-Platt Enterprises. Dan believed in lifetime accomplishments and admired scholarship, intellectual curiosity and writing. Jewish themes and history remained close to his heart. An expert in Judaica, Daniel served as part-time Curator of Coins and Medals at the Jewish Museum in New York City from 1962-1982. ""The Jewish Museum family mourns the loss of our Esteemed Curator Emeritus, Dan Friedenberg. During his tenure, and throughout his life, Dan made major scholarly contributions to the fields of Jewish numismatics and medieval seals. He was an eclectic collector and a generous donor of important works to the museum,"" the museum wrote in the New York Times. Daniel published several poems, over one hundred magazine articles and seven books including, Great Jewish Portraits in Medal, Jewish Medals from the Renaissance to the Fall of Napoleon, Jewish Minters Masters & Medalists, Medieval Jewish Seals from Europe, for which he won the National Jewish book award, Life Liberty and the Pursuit of Land, about land development in Colonial America, Sold to the Highest Bidder, a chronicling of the role of money in presidential politics and Tiberius Julius Alexander, a historical novel which he published in his 87th year. He was formerly a contributing editor of Dissent and a correspondent and feature writer for the New York Herald Tribune. A life-long collector, Dan strongly believed in philanthropy and donated a number of collections to museums and colleges, including significant Judaica, Pre-Columbian art, first edition books and modern art. Beyond his many and great accomplishments, we believe the true legacy of Daniel M. Friedenberg was the love and generosity he shared for his family. He possessed a dignity and genuineness that was rare. We were blessed to have him as a father. Daniel is survived by Beba Joy, mother of Samuel Clark and Danielle Joy and also survived by June Daniels, mother of Jay and Russell, and four grandchildren; Andrew, Emily, Chloe and Johnny Sequoyah. Interment will be at Mt. Pleasant, Valhalla, NY following services."

Now, thanks in large part to Soledad Benvenuto, an antiques collector who fell in love with the neighborhood and began buying up houses (she owns four new venues and has plans for more), aesthetically minded visitors to Tigre have a block that reflects their interests: Boulevard Saenz Peña (boulevardsaenzpena.com.ar). Here businesses, often in newly renovated spaces, offer art in all its expressions. You'll find ceramics, antiques, food, decoration, design and curiosities -- sometimes all under one roof. Stunning street art is on display, too, with facades whimsically adorned by professional painters. RACHEL FRIEDMAN"

So are the photographs in Luis Gispert's ''Decepción,'' a show at the Mary Boone Gallery spotlighting a subculture devoted to making both cars and clothes into personal showrooms for designer-logo fabrics. It's not that members of this street-art underground are shilling for brands like Gucci, Fendi and Coach. The fabrics are counterfeit. But the designs are real bombs declaring a war on status. Mr. Gispert's photos, though life-size, are not strictly documentary. But by equating natural splendor with a more bombastic human kind, he mirrors a tension between beauty and taste that both art and fashion create. LINDA YABLONSKY"

2011-09-18T00:00:00Z,"The now-standard critical line on D. W. Griffith's silent landmark ''Birth of a Nation'' is that it's important but irredeemably racist. That's a coward's approach, a way of reducing the film to a technical achievement while avoiding the hard work of reacting to its emotional content. As an evaluation of the movie without which movies as we know them would not exist, it's sheer ingratitude. Griffith's tale of two families caught up in the Civil War is both a racist film and a great one. Griffith, on fire to prove this new medium the equal of his beloved Dickens, pushed it, with the help of his great cameraman, Billy Bitzer, to a narrative breadth and emotional depth no one had. And like all masterpieces ''The Birth of a Nation'' is impure and imperfect. The film's vision of Reconstruction is a farrago. Vile racist caricature exists alongside moments of aching tenderness. Mawkish odes to home and family alternate with sequences in which, as in Dickens, sentimentality achieves the transcendence and catharsis of tragedy."

2011-09-18T00:00:00Z,"New York Fashion Week ended last Thursday after more than 250 designers presented looks for spring 2012, each hoping to be the one to redefine the language of fashion. Watching the shows, I kept thinking of Melissa Kuba Lederer, left and right, a woman I often see on her way to work. To me, her daily interpretation of men's wear triumphed over all the designer dreams, poetic as many were. Ms. Lederer's sleek style has the look of the future. And I thought of men I see en route to the office who, through small details, subtlely inserted their own personalities into the conventional suit, like James Aguiar, bottom row, left, and Andrew Mukamal, bottom row, right. Certainly, as Chanel knew when she slipped into the clothes of her lovers, man-tailoring can be terrific on women. And Ralph Lauren knows it, too. At his show, top row, he harked back to the Garçonne look of the 1920s to dress today's women for serious careers. Of course, there is room for the glorious kaleidoscopic diversity of designer visions shown last week on the runways. But then again, I can't tell you how many women pulled me aside during Fashion Week and said, ''Beautiful clothes, Bill, but nothing to wear.''"

The scheme pays homage to Randall Cunningham's glory days. The Eagles do not really drive down the field; they just string together amazing highlights, interspersing the occasional punt or baffling mistake. A typical play begins with two defenders knifing untouched through Philadelphia's porous, inexperienced offensive line. Vick either gets flattened or performs some Matrix-style escape, scrambling for a big gain or tossing to a receiver who used the confusion to get wide open. Andy Reid calls for a timeout four or five times per half to impose order (teams only get three timeouts per half, but a 5-yard penalty is a small price to pay for the chance to install a precisely designed sequence of plays for Vick to scrap). The Falcons have built a solid foundation on the lip of the crater Vick left when his career in Atlanta ended, but you could not tell by watching Sunday's messy loss to the Chicago Bears. In addition to giving up too many sacks and turnovers, the Falcons lost several key starters to injury, most notably defensive tackle Jonathan Babineaux (knee). The Falcons have the talent to compete with the Eagles and the Packers in the N.F.C., but they must get back to fundamentals. Nobody is going to beat the Eagles in a battle of sloppy playground brilliance. Pick: Eagles"

2011-09-19T18:06:07Z,"Last week, in the wake of President Obama's jobs speech, I wrote that the president seemed poised to campaign for re-election on an essentially centrist policy agenda: A short-term payroll tax stimulus, a plan for tax reform that would close loopholes while lowering corporate rates, and a long-term plan for deficit reduction modeled on the grand bargain that the White House and John Boehner were supposedly close to striking during the debt ceiling negotiations. The president's goal in 2012, I suggested, would be to try to paint himself as the moderate bipartisan grownup, and dismiss the Republicans as extreme, intransigent, and hyper-ideological."

His idea this season was to give Burberry's trenches and bags an artisanal dimension, with crochet, beading and latticed leather on collars and sleeves.

In the case of our education issue, that idea - to ask all sorts of influential and creative and inspiring people about the formative educational moments of their lives - was very, very late-breaking, indeed. Too late, really, for us to have much faith that it was going to work out. People are busy, after all. They have metropolises to run and rock shows to rock in and explanations for the fabric of the universe to nail down. And yet . . . when they received a call or an e-mail from someone here (in most cases, that person was the great Tony Gervino), many of those we reached out to agreed to sit down more or less immediately and type something out. Fifteen of those submissions are in this week's issue.

But the show on Fox was down in total viewers, to 12.4 million from 13.5 million. Those are respectable numbers considering that last year's ceremony did not have to compete for viewers against the National Football League. This time, ""Sunday Night Football"" on NBC dominated the night in both ratings categories, according to preliminary overnight Nielsen estimates (the Atlanta Falcons defeated the Philadelphia Eagles, 35-31). Final audience figures were unavailable on Monday."

Currey got his tree-borer stuck in a remote Great Basin bristlecone pine (Pinus longaeva) about 10,750 feet up in the little-visited Humboldt National Forest of eastern Nevada. It would have been an unremarkable inconvenience had it not led to the death of what was shortly thereafter found to be the most ancient living thing known to exist on the planet."

2011-09-19T10:00:51Z,"The designer Blake Simpson started coming out from Los Angeles to Joshua Tree in the late 1990s, after buying a house in the desert that he's still tinkering with. At the time, he was making furniture for Marc Jacobs and for the renovation of the Sunset Tower Hotel. Then, in 2002, he spotted the 1950s motel that would become his new five-room hideaway, Mojave Sands (mojavesands.com; doubles from $200). ""It was just sitting there, more or less abandoned,"" he says. ""But I could see that it had really good bones."" True to the D.I.Y. culture of the high desert, Simpson did a lot of the nine-year renovation himself, stripping and sanding the concrete floors and putting up honey-colored cedar planks for walls. He made the beds from black walnut and paired them with new and vintage modern furniture. And he used perforated metal tread plates to create a private patio for each room."

2011-09-19T09:00:05Z,"Though we'd like to believe that there was a magic time between the youthful distress of pimples and the more mature worry of wrinkles, when skin simply behaved, the evidence points increasingly to the contrary. ""Just because you're 35 doesn't mean you're not going to have breakouts,"" says Antonia Burrell, a straight-talking facialist-turned skin-care guru, whose namesake, all-natural year-old line has a rabid following in her native Britain. The problem, according to Burrell, is our higher levels of exposure to a host of complexion-wrecking factors like stress, pollution and the chemicals and hormones in food. ""I've been doing this for 18 years and the phenomenon of older women breaking out is not something I would see 10 years ago,"" Burrell says. ""After having so many clients moan to me about their skin, I decided to do something about it - but I wanted products that were holistic and a pleasure to use, not harsh chemicals that would dry out your skin. And I wanted to make them anti-aging, too."" At Shen Beauty in Cobble Hill, Brooklyn, the only store in the United States that sells Burrell's products, her multitasking, plant-extract-packed Cream Supreme moisturizer and deep cleaning Natural Glow Cleansing Oil are perennial best sellers. The co-owner Jessica Richards first tried the line just before the store opened late last year. ""My skin was completely broken out from the stress of launching a business, and this cleared it up in, like, three days,"" she says. ""It's like a natural version of Proactiv. People cannot get enough of this line."" Burrell's products are so popular at Shen that hers is among the 12 lines that will be available to order online when the boutique's retail Web site goes live later this week. Also in the works are plans to get Burrell to Shen sometime this fall so she can work her facial magic on the Brooklyn faithful. For those unwilling to wait, Burrell has a standing gig as a guest facialist at Harrods and also sees clients at the Urban Bliss spa in Notting Hill; appointments can be made through her Web site. But be aware - she's usually booked three months in advance."

2011-09-19T08:24:27Z,"When I first read John Le Carré, there was still an Iron Curtain, and it seemed impossible that the world he described would ever change much, never mind as significantly as it has. He moved beyond that territory, of course, to tailors in Panama, Palestinian terrorists and, later, big pharma in Nairobi, but for me, Le Carré will always be synonymous with the Cold War. My three favorites are from that era:"

2011-09-19T08:00:13Z,"If there is an advantage to being an underappreciated novelist, it might be that when you get around to writing a memoir, the anecdotes of your life have not already been trotted out ad infinitum by book reviewers the world over. Such is the case with Bruce Jay Friedman, whose memoir, ""Lucky Bruce,"" will be published next month. On the strength of his early novels - ""Stern"" (1962), ""A Mother's Kisses"" (1964) and ""About Harry Towns"" (1974) - Friedman was a literary star, frequently mentioned alongside Bernard Malamud and Philip Roth. He hung out at Elaine's; edited for legendary Magazine Management pulp journals, where he hired Mario Puzo onto the staff of True Action; and, later, moonlighted as a screenwriter (""Stir Crazy,"" ""Splash""), rubbing shoulders with Warren Beatty and Richard Pryor. Yet Friedman has always remained somewhat under the radar. In ""Lucky Bruce,"" readers get fresh, amusing stories from Friedman's life in letters - the time he provoked Norman Mailer into a fistfight by mussing his hair at a party, say, or was hired to write a script and introduced to his new secretary, a between-marriages Natalie Wood. The Moment caught up with Friedman, now 81, at one of his favorite Chinese restaurants in Manhattan, Chin Chin, to talk about his latest book."

My Aunt Emma wanted tickets to ""Priscilla, Queen of the Desert,"" and I was getting them for her. An usher brushed against me, ordering people to stay back. Nearby, a young man in a pink boa, struggling to set up his souvenir program booth, was hemmed in by the crowd."
2011-09-19T07:00:23Z,"""Do you mean what was the hair meant to look like or what did it end up being?"" said Duffy, laughing backstage at Marios Schwab as a few models arrived within 10 minutes of starting time. Turns out the style was to be 40s waves à la Veronica Lake, Ingrid Bergman or Rita Hayworth. This was achieved using Clairol ColorSeal Gloss to prep the hair and then Frédéric Fekkai mousse before blow-drying and creating a low side part. A large-barrel curling iron set the front wave, clamped very tight until the end (""really cooking the hair""), when it was brushed out. For makeup, Val Garland created what she called a ""film noir Fellini-flick look"": liquid liner on the top of the lid, a sooty matte on the bottom and M.A.C.'s Carbon shadow in between. M.A.C. Creme Colour Base contoured the face at the corners of the cheeks, the temples, even the cupid's bow of the lips."

2011-09-19T06:21:03Z,"The multistripe Hudson's Bay point blanket (also referred to as the Glacier National Park Blanket and the Chief Blanket) follows a very simple aesthetic pattern: green stripe, red stripe, yellow stripe and indigo stripe on a white background, mirrored on the top and bottom of each blanket. Lately, that recognizable motif has adorned a number of items from travel mugs to boots to Swiss Army knives to snow boards. The versatility of the pattern is a testament to the endurance of that basic color combination. While the palette is mainly prized today for its aesthetic value, back in the early 1800s, those colored stripes bore special significance for aboriginal people of North America, who were Hudson's Bay's original customers."

''The North side's position that I've been given from the beginning and confirmed when I was there was that they would like very much for this to happen,'' Mr. Chung said in a telephone interview, basing his conclusions on conversations with cultural officials. In the south, he said, the government was ''positively inclined, and wary.'' The idea would be to have members of the Seoul Philharmonic Orchestra and musicians from North Korean symphonies play a concert in Pyongyang at the end of the year and another concert in Seoul. Barring political upheaval, he rated the chances of the exchange ''very possible.'' He said he also discussed the possibility of establishing a regular joint North-South orchestra of young musicians."

2011-09-19T00:00:00Z,"NOTABLE NUMBER It was not by design, but Rex Ryan was delighted nevertheless that Mark Sanchez was the Jets' second-leading rusher Sunday. That Sanchez ran for 29 yards, a career high, signified moderate progress. When Jacksonville's zone coverage was inviting, Sanchez tried to exploit it. But when the Jaguars' defensive backs dropped deep, Sanchez, as he put it, ''just took off and ran.'' His longest rush, 15 yards, was not his most important. That scramble came when he converted a third-and-4 in the third quarter, dashing for a 7-yard gain that was amplified by a late-hit penalty. Five plays later, Sanchez used his arm -- a more familiar weapon -- to connect on his second touchdown pass. KEY PERFORMANCE A tight end made life miserable over the middle for the opposition, and for a change the Jets were the beneficiaries. Dustin Keller accounted for 101 of Mark Sanchez's 182 passing yards, and he bookended a third-quarter drive with critical catches. The first, a 37-yarder down the right sideline, moved the Jets off their own 8. On the second, Keller shook off linebacker Paul Posluszny for an 11-yard touchdown that extended the Jets' lead to 22-3. With Jacksonville's imposing tight end, Marcedes Lewis, sidelined because of an injured calf, Keller grabbed the spotlight."

2011-09-20T09:19:55Z,"San Franciscans sometimes get a bad rep.

Surprisingly, the title of this record, which was released last Tuesday to rave reviews, does not directly refer to Owens's childhood in the infamous Children of God cult, he said. Instead, the moody album -- filled with heavy metal riffs that channel Fleetwood Mac, and light '60s strumming that brings you back to the Beach Boys, supported by hallowing gospels -- reaches down deeper than that: to Owens's relationship with women, primarily his mother. This record is no doubt less lo-fi than their first, but the straightforward and honest sentiment Owens and the bassist and producer J.R. White bring feels evermore present. Currently on a United States tour, Girls talked to The Moment about their new song ""Honey Bunny,"" which Owens initially wrote using his cellphone, and the video, imagined by White. Girls will play at New York's Bowery Ballroom on Thursday and Friday."

Mr. Colbert, who isn't afraid to flaunt his rock-music bona fides, has used his show to feature artists like the Decemberists, LCD Soundsystem and Jack White, who appeared in multiple''Colbert Report''segments over the summer.

2011-09-20T00:00:00Z,"BLOOM--Murray, 72, loving husband, wonderful friend, gentle and understanding father and grandfather, intuitive, innovative and inventive entrepreneur and avid jazz enthusiast, died peacefully Sunday, September 18, 2011. As the patriarch of cardiac electrophysiological instrumentation and himself a Horatio Alger type figure, Murray, under the banner of the company he founded, Bloom Associates Ltd., designed, manufactured and distributed cardiac stimulating, recording and monitoring devices used for the evaluation of arrhythmias of the heart. His designs helped usher in the modern era of cardiac electrophysiology. This niche business which distributed his products worldwide was sold to Fischer Imaging in 1992 and continues to this day as a part of the Fischer Medical Technologies product line. A jazz writer, arranger, player and producer, Murray's love of music took root at a very young age on the street corners of West Philadelphia and flourished throughout his life. His fondness for jazz added color, enjoyment and breath to his life, opening doors at Florida Atlantic University (the Jazz Department essentially adopted him) and within the Jazz community in Philadelphia which provided him a musical home. His arrangements has been played by many bands and immortalized on several albums. Born and raised in Philadelphia on July 24, 1939, Murray spent most of his later years in Villanova, PA annually migrating to Highland Beach, FL each winter. Besides his wife Susan, he is survived by his daughters Celia, Pamela and Amy and his grandchildren Alexandra, Daniel, Anya, Emily and Sophie. He is remembered fondly by the many friends, associates and clients he met along his journey and for the innovations and inventions by which so many lives were saved. Funeral Services will be held at 11:30am, Wednesday, September 21, 2011 at the Bringhurst Funeral Home, West Laurel Hill Cemetery, 225 Belmont Avenue, Bala Cynwyd, PA. In lieu of flowers, contributions may be made to the Bloom Fund for Cardiac Research and Education, University of Pennsylvania Development Office, 3535 Market Street, Suite 750, Philadelphia, PA 19104."

2011-09-21T18:30:30Z,"When John Peters, the guy who created the modern messenger bag, invites you up to his home in Saugerties, N.Y., to see his latest project, you go and look.

Peters, whose tall and skinny frame can be attributed to the years he spent climbing in New York, New Hampshire and beyond, touches on about 20 things at the same time - from A.T.V.'s to Levon Helm's Midnight Rambles. But it's talk about his latest collection of bags, called Peters Mountain Works, that overshadows all. The line is the culmination of many things: the sewing skills that Peters's mother taught him growing up in Poughkeepsie, N.Y.; the collection of packs he later started in New York with a fellow climber he met at the Shawangunks; the now ubiquitous line of cordura messenger bags that Peters created (that line, with the red and white skyscraper logo), which would begin its takeover of Manhattan in the early 1980s - ""a little hillbilly line from Upstate,"" he calls it, though it was anything but."

In 1980, Derek moved to Manhattan and in 1982 he founded ZZZ Carpentry, a high-end residential construction firm, collaborating closely with a number of notable architects on both traditional and modern renovations. Derek was an avid fresh and salt water fly fisherman, an enthusiastic tennis player, and an all-around athlete. He was a summer resident of Saltaire on Fire Island. Derek had many friends whom he loved and who loved him. He is survived by his wife and partner of 21 years, Caroline Northcote Sidnam, son Samuel Dworkin Huntington, stepdaughter Emma X Sidnam Pucci, stepson Samuel Northcote Pucci, former wife Elizabeth Dworkin, sister Sara Huntington Ohly of New Haven, CT and brother John Willard Huntington of Chicago IL.

The findings, based on a study of more than 1,000 men treated for prostate cancer at multiple medical centers, show that whether a man is able to achieve adequate erections after treatment for prostate cancer varies greatly depending on a number of individual variables, including his age, the extent of his cancer and the quality of his sex life before treatment."

2011-09-21T00:00:00Z,"The composer and writer Elizabeth Swados has created a musical work, ''The La MaMa Cantata,'' comprising decades of quotations by Ellen Stewart, the founder of La MaMa Experimental Theater Club, and is set to direct the piece at that downtown theater on Nov. 7 and 8. The piece is intended as a celebration of Ms. Stewart, who helped establish the Off Off Broadway scene with La MaMa and who died in January at 91. Ms. Swados is best known for her 1978 Broadway musical ''Runaways,'' for which she received Tony Award nominations for direction, music and lyrics, book and choreography. She and Ms. Stewart also collaborated for years on productions like ''Seven Against Thebes'' and ''Mythos Oedipus.'' In an e-mail Ms. Swados described the new work as a ''carnival of Ellen Stewart's own words from her 50-year career,'' as well as stories and anecdotes involving Ms. Stewart that others shared with Ms. Swados. The two performances, part of La MaMa's 50th-anniversary season, will include a company of 25 actors, soloists and chorus members. The season will begin with a two-day celebration, featuring a block party on Oct. 16 near the theater's East Village home and a gala on Oct. 17 at which Patti Smith and Bill Irwin will perform."

2011-09-21T00:00:00Z,"In August officials of the City and County of Denver announced that they had chosen Sotheby's to sell four canvases by the Abstract Expressionist painter Clyfford Still to raise money for the endowment of the new Clyfford Still Museum, which is scheduled to open there on Nov. 18. The agreement called for Sotheby's to try to sell the four as a group to a museum by Monday; if it were unable to do so, the works -- which together are estimated to be worth more than $50 million -- would then go to auction separately. Christie's, the rival auction house that had also competed for the sale, was so miffed by Denver's selection of Sotheby's that it hired lawyers and lobbyists in an unsuccessful effort to stop the arrangement. On Tuesday Sotheby's officials said that attempts to sell the paintings to a museum failed and that the works would be included in a contemporary-art auction on Nov. 9. The four canvases, bequeathed to Denver by the artist's widow, Patricia Still, include ''1949-A No. 1,'' a canvas of jagged and thick brush strokes in fiery reds and blacks, above, that is expected to bring $25 million to $35 million. ''Key works by Abstract Expressionists are hard to come by,'' said Tobias Meyer, the worldwide head of Sotheby's contemporary art department. ''But to have four paintings in one sale is a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity.''"

Milan, on the other hand, has been conspicuously lacking in luxury department stores. But that all changed earlier this month, with the opening earlier of Excelsior, a multilevel shopping destination with a fashion sense that runs the gamut from Dries Van Noten to Balmain (the renowned local boutique owner Antonia Giacinti is a consultant), a trio of restaurants from the local celebrity chef Davide Oldani and departments stocked with everything from retro-fabulous meat slicers to flower arrangements by the edgy florist Numero 9. The former cinema has been reimagined by the architect Jean Nouvel as an ode to the history of film: floors are laid out as parapet balconies, and wraparound L.E.D. screens show a continuous stream of film stills. Even the sales clerks dress the part. The women who work in the cosmetics and fragrance hall on the first floor wear stripy Breton tops, cropped black trousers and ankle-strap heels and the guys who sell men's clothes on the second floor sport tartan shirts, chinos and solid ties. Despite the inauspicious location, right next to a low-end mall, and the coy facade (Nouvel hid the entrance behind a giant louvered blind, and there are no window displays), we foresee a flurry of fashion-week pilgrimages."

She was sixty-eight years old. Born in New York City, a graduate of Queens College and Bank Street Graduate School of Education, Sandy served as Head of Lower School at the Tower Hill School in Wilmington, DE and, prior, was Director of Development for Moorestown Friends School in Moorestown, NJ. Sandy was known as a compassionate advocate for children, an inspirational mentor to faculty and a tireless supporter of school families, but her legacy also extends to the institutions she served. She directed fundraising and development campaigns, built lasting academic programs and successfully led multi-year school building projects, including the new Pre-School Wing and Playground at the Tower Hill School, which the Trustees and Donors named ""Sandy's Place"" in her honor in 2008. Treasured and admired by her family, and looked to for wisdom and guidance, Sandy was loved immeasurably. When she was diagnosed with cancer in 2010, she inspired all who knew her by living each day just as she had before her illness with strength, enthusiasm, grace and a beautiful smile. In the last year of her life she realized her dream of traveling internationally with her children and grandchildren, recommitted to the game of bridge, celebrating every Master Point, and continued to be an active participant in the Lifelong Learning Institute at UNCW. She enjoyed time with family and friends at her Cape Cod home over the past year and never missed one of her grandchildren's hockey games, school plays or dance recitals. Sandy cherished the loving relationships she shared with her friends, colleagues and family, and felt lucky for these gifts every day of her life. Daughter of the late George and Diana Glotzer, Sandy is survived by her husband, Michael Wang, children Andrew Wang and Kathy Seward, daughter-in-law and son-in-law Karen Wang and Duane Seward, brother Alan Glotzer, sister-in-law Susan Miller, grandchildren Lydia, Zachary, Sophie and Macy and her nieces, nephew and cousins. She will be missed. A memorial service will be held on Monday, September 26 at 1:0pm at The Frank H. Kenan Chapel located at 510 Arboretum Drive, Wilmington, NC 28405. In lieu of flowers, donations in Sandy's memory may be sent to Faculty Professional Development, Tower Hill School, 2813 W. 17th St., Wilmington, DE 19806 or Landfall Foundation, 1924 Pembroke Jones Drive, Wilmington, NC 28405."

Casey, Walter Mischel and 12 other collaborators in The Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences. Dr. Casey is director of the Sackler Institute for Developmental Psychobiology at Weill Cornell Medical College, and Dr. Mischel, a psychologist, is Niven professor of humane letters at Columbia University. THE EXPERIMENT For nearly four decades the marshmallow test has fascinated people. In this experiment Dr. Mischel probed 4-year-olds' self-control by offering them one marshmallow now or two 15 minutes later. When Dr. Mischel caught up with the preschoolers years later, those who exhibited more self-control in the experiment turned out to be less likely to abuse drugs and more successful in relationships, work and handling stress as adults than their eat-it-now counterparts. Dr. Mischel, Dr. Casey and their collaborators wanted a closer look at what was happening in these subjects' brains. They rounded up 59 of the more than 500 participants -- now in their mid-40s -- to retake the test, and then scanned the brains of 26 of them using functional M.R.I. Dr. Mischel had proposed that a ''cool'' system rooted in the conscious control circuitry in the brain and a ''hot'' system centered in the region devoted to desire and emotions were both involved in self-control. The question was whether people who quickly grabbed for the marshmallow -- the ''low delayers'' -- would have less activity in the right prefrontal cortex (cognitive control) and more in the ventral striatum (where positive rewards are processed), compared with the ''high delayers.'' Aware that sweets might not be as much of a lure to adults, Dr. Casey used happy, neutral and fearful faces to stand in for positive and negative social cues."

Lately, however, I feel like I've been seeing an increasing number of entries that have enough in common that one could consider them a minitheme of sorts. This does not bother me; it almost seems like value added to an already challenging puzzle. It's just interesting to note how puzzle styles evolve over the years."

He can attract scorn from hundreds of miles away. Everything about Cutler's career is polarizing: the gaudy statistics that contrast his 35-35 win-loss record; his penchant for turnovers; his snippy, irritable public demeanor; and his career-long association with mercurial offensive masterminds like Mike Shanahan, Josh McDaniels and Mike Martz, who only magnify his peculiar attraction-repulsion effect.Last season's N.F.C. championship game became Ferris Cutler's Day Off, with the (somewhat) injured quarterback looking less willing than able on the sideline as his backups got battered by the Packers. It was the type of nonperformance that defines a career, fairly or not, and a win Sunday could deflect a tiny bit of criticism. Unfortunately, Cutler's Bears are 1-4 against the Packers in the past two seasons, and their offensive line is still bad enough to make even the toughest quarterback consider using a sick day.

In 1982 he joined Kronish Lieb Weiner and Hellman as head of the litigation department. He remained of counsel to that firm now Cooley LLP - until his retirement from the bar at the age of 90. Justin was a leader in the movement to reform the Democratic Party in Manhattan. His article in the National Municipal Review in 1949 ""How Tammany Holds Power"" ignited the drive for direct election of Manhattan district leaders. He was the Fair Deal candidate for Manhattan Borough President, which forced the withdrawal of the Tammany candidate in favor of Robert Wagner. In 1960, Justin was a member of the special task-force on the reorganization of federal regulatory agencies for President John Kennedy, and was later instrumental in persuading Robert Kennedy to run for the Senate from New York. In 1970, Governor Rockefeller appointed Justin to the Board of the Metropolitan Transportation Authority, and by appointment of Mayor Koch in 1983 he was a member of the New York City Charter Revision Commission. He was Chair of the City Bar Association's Committee on the Judiciary, on which he served for ten years. In addition to his long record of public service and his distinguished career as a litigator and corporate lawyer, Justin had indomitable spirit and courage, great good humor, profound love of family, friends, the law, life and Martha's Vineyard. He had a great run, to the very last day. In lieu of flowers, gifts may be made in support of the Justin Feldman '42 Public Service Fellowship and sent to Columbia Law School, 435 W. 116th Street Box A2, New York, New York 10027. Funeral will be private and a memorial service to be announced at a later date."

Stephen Schwartz, the ''Pippin'' composer and lyricist, said in an interview that he had opted to pursue a revival first with the Chocolate Factory because the director there, Mitch Sebastian, had initially pitched his concept before Ms. Paulus (''The Gershwins' Porgy and Bess,'' ''Hair'') and her producer, Barry Weissler (''Chicago'')."

Since then, the proposed museum's director has departed, its board has stopped meeting and some people who gave artifacts to the museum have asked for their return. The museum's major remaining asset is its land and last summer Fredericksburg officials said they planned to sell the property. But the bankruptcy filing on Wednesday will have the effect of blocking any sale, at least temporarily, the Times-Dispatch reported."

It will then move to a Friday night time slot. Joel Stillerman, an AMC executive, said in a statement that ''Talking Dead'' will complement the online chatter about each episode of the series, which drew record numbers of viewers to the channel last fall. (Its average of 3.5 viewers each week is more than double the audience AMC attracts for its critical darling ''Mad Men.'') The show, he said, will be a ''kind of live water cooler.''

2011-09-24T00:00:00Z,"Matthew Lombardo's addiction-themed drama ''High'' was one of the fastest flops on Broadway in recent years, closing just five days after opening last April in spite of the star power of its leading lady, Kathleen Turner. Having lost its entire investment of $1.8 million in New York, why is ''High'' now poised to become the relatively rare Broadway play to go on national tour? A group of producers announced this week that Ms. Turner would reprise her role as a tough-talking nun and addiction counselor, Sister Jamison Connelly, in a tour that is to begin at the Cutler Majestic Theater in Boston, where tickets for the play are on sale for Dec. 6-11. Plans are in the works to go on to Fort Lauderdale, Fla., Philadelphia, Washington, Chicago, Dallas, San Francisco and perhaps elsewhere.

Mr. Villella, a former principal dancer with New York City Ballet, who founded the company with Toby Ansin in 1985, is leaving to continue other professional pursuits. In a statement Mr. Villella said: ''My ambition from the start was to give Miami and South Florida a major dance company; my strategy was to proceed carefully and steadily, evolving rather than over-extending. Today it's no longer a fledgling operation with a limited repertory (almost entirely Balanchine) and an even more limited budget. Instead, it's a 45-plus group of brilliant dancers and has a range of ballets that stretches from the classics - 'Giselle,' 'Coppelia,' 'Don Quixote,' 'Romeo and Juliet' - to the choicest works by Balanchine's greatest successors (Jerome Robbins, Paul Taylor, Twyla Tharp).''"

2011-09-24T00:00:00Z,"Red Bulls Coach Hans Backe on Friday suspended defender Rafael Marquez for Saturday's match against visiting Portland after the club's Mexican international was critical of his teammates after Wednesday's 3-1 loss to Real Salt Lake. The Major League Soccer club confirmed Backe's decision to banish Marquez, who has appeared in only 15 of the team's 29 league matches because of injuries and international duty. The decision will probably will spare Marquez another negative reaction from the club's fans. The match is expected to be sold out in the 25,000-seat Red Bull Arena. Marquez was booed by the fans in the Arena's South Ward, home to the team's most dedicated fans. Against R.S.L., the Red Bulls were coming off a 1-0 win at Dallas last Saturday (a game in which Marquez did not play) and hoping to build on a four-game streak without a loss (which came after eight games without a win) in a drive to make the 10-team playoffs in M.L.S. In that game, the Red Bulls allowed R.S.L., which has now won five straight games, to score three goals in the game's first 21 minutes. After the match, Marquez, 32, when confronted by reporters asking about the poor performance by one of the worst defenses in the league, said through a translator: ''I'm focusing on really performance at my highest level. That doesn't mean that the whole back line can perform at that same level, so that's a problem. I think this is a team game and unfortunately there isn't an equal level between my teammates and I.'' Marquez, with Thierry Henry and goalkeeper Frank Rost, is one of the team's three designated players. He is among the highest paid players in the league, earning a guaranteed $4.6 million this season, his first full year with the Red Bulls. He joined the club last summer after eight seasons with Barcelona of Spain and has several more years remaining on his contract. That, however, has been cast into doubt by the events of the past few days. Kristen Dyer, who covers the club for MLSsoccer.com, the league's official Web site, reported on his Twitter feed that Marquez declined to comment about the suspension after training on Friday at Montclair State University in Little Falls, N.J. Dyer added that the American defender Tim Ream had a face-to-face meeting with Marquez, but would not disclose the nature of the chat. In an email message Ream said, ''I'm definitely not going to comment and will be laying low.'' Marquez added on Wednesday, ''There have been some mistakes, but if you see the statistics I'm trying to steal balls, get them back for the team, make a couple of good passes.'' As Stefan Bondy pointed out in his blog on the Web site of the New York Daily News, Marquez has no goals, four assists and four yellow cards so far this season and is No. 138 in the latest Castrol Rankings that rates the performance of all league players. Those comments by Marquez may have been ill-timed, but it is clear that the defender who is a legend in his native land has grown accustomed to playing with high-level defenders surrounding him. It is a situation that has allowed him to largely eschew most of his defensive duties and float around the midfield and defense while spraying long diagonal balls to players on the wings. That situation, however, does not exist with the Red Bulls, whose central defense includes Ream, the second-year American pro, and other players who clearly are not at the same level of players at Barcelona and Mexico. And to state the obvious, Marquez has never been a favorite among American soccer fans for his play in international matches against the United States. He can be rough, chippy, even dirty on the field ... clutching, grabbing and fouling. Off the field, he can be another person. Against Dallas, Backe employed an all-American back line (Carlos Mendes, Stephen Keel, Ream and Chris Albright) that defended furiously and earned credit for helping goalkeeper Frank Rost earn his first win in M.L.S. But in audio provided by the Red Bulls on Friday to preview the match against the Timbers, Backe had a different take."

With 12.5 million viewers, the overall ratings matched the debut episode, while the 18-to-49-year-old audience dropped off by just 2 percent. It was enough to give Fox a victory in the advertiser-coveted 18-to-49 demographic for the night, representing Fox's first ratings win ever for a Thursday during premiere week. CBS once again finished first in total viewers, led by two episodes of ''Big Bang Theory'' (averaging 14.4 million viewers) and its new drama ''Person of Interest'' (13.2 million), according to Nielsen data. However, ''Person of Interest'' fell in its second half-hour and was fourth in the 18-to-49 category for its 9 p.m. time slot, behind ''X-Factor,'' ''Grey's Anatomy'' on ABC and ''Whitney'' on NBC.

2011-09-24T00:00:00Z,"FELDMAN--Justin N, 92 years of age, died peacefully at his home in New York on September 21, 2011, with his adoring wife of twenty-five years, Linda Fairstein, at his side. He is survived by three children, Jane Feldman of Denver, Colorado, Diane Feldman of Washington, DC, and Geoffrey Feldman of Lowell, Massachusetts, and by two grandsons, Matthew and Alexander Zavislan of Denver, Colorado. He is also survived by his brother and sister-in-law, Guy and Marisa Fairstein; Lisa, Marc, Suzy, Isla and Mila Fairstein, and by his devoted friend, Rabin Sooklall. Justin was born in Manhattan on May 25, 1919, graduated from Columbia College (1940) and Columbia Law School (1942), then served from 1943-1946 in the United States Army Air Force as a Trial Judge Advocate for Courts-Martial. In 1946, he was Director of Veterans Affairs for the American Veterans Committee, supervising the establishment of a national legal assistance clinic for returning WWII veterans. From 1952-1955, Justin was Administrative Assistant to Congressman Franklin D. Roosevelt, Jr., with whom he later practiced law. He was a founding member of the firm of Landis, Feldman, Reilly and Akins, which merged into Poletti, Freidin, Prashker, Feldman and Gartner. In 1982 he joined Kronish Lieb Weiner and Hellman as head of the litigation department. He remained of counsel to that firm now Cooley LLP - until his retirement from the bar at the age of 90. Justin was a leader in the movement to reform the Democratic Party in Manhattan. His article in the National Municipal Review in 1949 ""How Tammany Holds Power"" ignited the drive for direct election of Manhattan district leaders. He was the Fair Deal candidate for Manhattan Borough President, which forced the withdrawal of the Tammany candidate in favor of Robert Wagner. In 1960, Justin was a member of the special task-force on the reorganization of federal regulatory agencies for President John Kennedy, and was later instrumental in persuading Robert Kennedy to run for the Senate from New York. In 1970, Governor Rockefeller appointed Justin to the Board of the Metropolitan Transportation Authority, and by appointment of Mayor Koch in 1983 he was a member of the New York City Charter Revision Commission. He was Chair of the City Bar Association's Committee on the Judiciary, on which he served for ten years. In addition to his long record of public service and his distinguished career as a litigator and corporate lawyer, Justin had indomitable spirit and courage, great good humor, profound love of family, friends, the law, life and Martha's Vineyard. He had a great run, to the very last day. In lieu of flowers, gifts may be made in support of the Justin Feldman '42 Public Service Fellowship and sent to Columbia Law School, 435 W. 116th Street Box A2, New York, New York 10027.

2011-09-25T00:00:00Z,"In last week's Metropolitan cover article, John Leland interviewed couples with children adopted from China, where recent reports reveal that some adoptees had been seized from their parents or sold. Some of the more than 100 comments posted on NYTimes.com follow. Readers also weighed in on Ginia Bellafante's first Big City column, which contended that huge economic gaps among New Yorkers are often ignored or glossed over. I feel terrible for these parents, but their nonsense about ''doing what's right for the child'' by keeping them, not questioning their origins and pushing this under the rug is nauseating -- not to mention self-serving. Being involved in an international child-stealing ring, whether at first by sheer ignorance but then by willful ignorance, is not a morally defensible position. It also has a strong element of racial or cultural superiority to it."

2011-09-25T00:00:00Z,"FELDMAN--Justin N, 92 years of age, died peacefully at his home in New York on September 21, 2011, with his adoring wife of twenty-five years, Linda Fairstein, at his side. He is survived by three children, Jane Feldman of Denver, Colorado, Diane Feldman of Washington, DC, and Geoffrey Feldman of Lowell, Massachusetts, and by two grandsons, Matthew and Alexander Zavislan of Denver, Colorado. He is also survived by his brother and sister-in-law, Guy and Marisa Fairstein; Lisa, Marc, Suzy, Isla and Mila Fairstein, and by his devoted friend, Rabin Sooklall. Justin was born in Manhattan on May 25, 1919, graduated from Columbia College (1940) and Columbia Law School (1942), then served from 1943-1946 in the United States Army Air Force as a Trial Judge Advocate for Courts-Martial. In 1946, he was Director of Veterans Affairs for the American Veterans Committee, supervising the establishment of a national legal assistance clinic for returning WWII veterans. From 1952-1955, Justin was Administrative Assistant to Congressman Franklin D. Roosevelt, Jr., with whom he later practiced law. He was a founding member of the firm of Landis, Feldman, Reilly and Akins, which merged into Poletti, Freidin, Prashker, Feldman and Gartner. In 1982 he joined Kronish Lieb Weiner and Hellman as head of the litigation department. He remained of counsel to that firm now Cooley LLP - until his retirement from the bar at the age of 90. Justin was a leader in the movement to reform the Democratic Party in Manhattan. His article in the National Municipal Review in 1949 ""How Tammany Holds Power"" ignited the drive for direct election of Manhattan district leaders. He was the Fair Deal candidate for Manhattan Borough President, which forced the withdrawal of the Tammany candidate in favor of Robert Wagner. In 1960, Justin was a member of the special task-force on the reorganization of federal regulatory agencies for President John Kennedy, and was later instrumental in persuading Robert Kennedy to run for the Senate from New York. In 1970, Governor Rockefeller appointed Justin to the Board of the Metropolitan Transportation Authority, and by appointment of Mayor Koch in 1983 he was a member of the New York City Charter Revision Commission. He was Chair of the City Bar Association's Committee on the Judiciary, on which he served for ten years. In addition to his long record of public service and his distinguished career as a litigator and corporate lawyer, Justin had indomitable spirit and courage, great good humor, profound love of family, friends, the law, life and Martha's Vineyard. He had a great run, to the very last day. In lieu of flowers, gifts may be made in support of the Justin Feldman '42 Public Service Fellowship and sent to Columbia Law School, 435 W. 116th Street Box A2, New York, New York 10027.

Which may be why the windy capital city of Wellington is getting buzz as the Portland of the Pacific. Fueled by an abundance of fishing and agriculture, the restaurant scene is brimming with experimentation. The menu at Boulcott Street Bistro (99 Boulcott Street; 011-64-4-499-4199) includes dishes like Pukekohe chicken with fennel and cabanossi. Ambeli (18 Majoribanks Street; 011-64-4-385-7577) serves inventive takes on Mediterranean cooking. Martin Bosley's (103 Oriental Parade; 011-64-4-920-8302) has a mostly seafood menu and a wine list long on rare New Zealand whites. And La Boca Loca Taqueria (19 Park Road; 011-64-4-388-2451) brings Mexico to the growing suburb around Peter Jackson's ''Wellywood'' studios. Cocktails have gotten serious, too: Matterhorn (106 Cuba Street; 011-64-4-384-3359) makes its own tinctures and liquors infused with flavors of geranium and cigar."

Now a new collection of Steig's drawings, ''Cats, Dogs, Men, Women, Ninnies & Clowns'' (Abrams Image, $40), appears as a fresh and quirky way of discovering (or rediscovering) the celebrated illustrator's oeuvre. The images, all previously unpublished, are grouped thematically and tenderly introduced by Steig's widow, Jeanne. Jules Feiffer provides an afterword, and in the preface, Roz Chast explains that, while Steig's artistry may have lacked technical virtuosity, he made up for it with in ingenuous spirit, meeting a challenge issued by his favorite painter, Picasso, who once said: ''All children are artists. The problem is how to remain an artist once we grow up.'' MATT McCANN"

And in a sport in which sound is essential, she has done all of this without the ability to hear. ''I have been told that most people use sound to know when to shift,'' says Fiolek, who has been deaf since birth. ''I feel when my motorcycle needs to shift. The engine's vibrations change and I know it's time.'' At 5-foot-2 and 110 pounds, Fiolek might be Honda-Red Bull's most petite team member, but her next goal is decidedly large: to be the first woman to compete in a men's race.

Though the menu dabbles in molecular gastronomy, the overriding passion of its young executive chef, Szabina Szullo, is in re-envisioning the classics. Her seven-course tasting menu features lamb soup with tarragon foam, tenderloin with celeriac purée and a 21st-century makeover of the traditional dessert somloi galuska.

2011-09-25T00:00:00Z,"There are cities you love for what they offer in terms of superficial diversion - the joy of hunting down a perfect piece of passementerie in Paris or of locating a wonderfully sinuous leather journal in Milan - and there are cities you love for their significant history and scope, despite their lack of good shopping. Athens is one of those cities, offering up the Parthenon and not much else, as is (so I'm told) St. Petersburg. Jerusalem is one of my favorite cities on the planet; its yellow stone and golden light draw me back time and again, but when I was there this past July as a judge for the Jerusalem Film Festival I was reminded of the serious absence of retail therapy. I wasn't expecting to stumble upon a Barneys or Sephora, Lord knows; even a well-stocked stationery store would have done. But aside from numerous shops carrying Judaica, faux relics and silver kiddush cups - and breathless malls carrying T-shirts and running shoes - I couldn't find anything I could sink my acquisitive teeth into, until, gasping for breath, I stumbled upon a cutting-edge boutique hidden away on a little street.

An ostrich can stand as tall as nine feet and weigh as much as 350 pounds -- and run as fast as 40 miles per hour. ''Your only hope to control them is to use intimidation,'' says Douglas Osborne, the owner of O.K. Corral Ostrich Farms in Oro Grande, Calif., the nation's largest such farm, ''because if you turn your back, they're going to do a Navajo rain dance on you.'' They're worth the danger. Osborne sells newborn chicks for $300 each; a bird's price will rise by $100 per month thereafter. Mature females with exceptional bloodlines will occasionally sell for more than $10,000. As for the actual ostrich meat, the price is comparable with prime beef's. Says Osborne, whose herd numbers over 3,000, ''I sell out of everything I produce.''

The problem started two days earlier. In the midst of what seemed a perfectly ordinary day, he started to hiccup and wasn't able to stop. He tried all the usual treatments. He held his breath. He drank glass after glass of cold water. He thought scary thoughts. But no matter what he did, every 20 to 30 seconds, his chest would jump, and then his throat would close, cutting short the involuntary intake of air. After two days of nonstop hiccupping, he went to the hospital. 1. THE PHYSICIAN ASSISTANT It was evening by the time Steve Ferrante, a physician assistant, saw the patient. The patient told him he didn't have any medical problems; didn't smoke or drink and took no medications. He had had two hernia operations -- one three years ago and one earlier that week. And he'd been hiccupping constantly for the past two days. Ferrante asked whether there were there any other symptoms: chest pain, shortness of breath, fever, chills or cough? Nothing. Other than the hiccups, the patient felt fine. The physical exam was unremarkable."
2011-09-25T00:00:00Z,"Before Christina Vantzou, a Kansas City, Mo.-born art student, fell in love with an American expat during a layover in Brussels seven years ago, she had never given the city a second thought. She assumed it was as bland as everyone said, and when she packed her bags and moved there soon after, she found plenty of Europeans who agreed. ''The people I was hanging out with at the time referred to it as the Mexico of Europe,'' she says. ''Everyone wanted to go to Paris or London or Amsterdam, and Brussels was just this weird place in the middle.'' At first, Vantzou stayed mostly for her relationship and for the hefty artist's stipend she received from the Belgian government, having secured E.U. citizenship by way of her Greek father. But then a funny thing happened. Not only was she discovering that there was more to the cultural scene than she'd imagined, she was also watching as other artists - Parisians, even - began settling in the city. Long ignored or even mocked by its neighbors, Brussels seemed to be entering a kind of creative renaissance. ''Where it used to be like 'Brussels? Why the heck would you move there?' these days it's like, 'Oh, yeah, I've been hearing about all the stuff happening there,' '' Vantzou says. ''Brussels used to be this forgotten place, and suddenly people are talking about it like they were talking about Berlin 10 years ago.''"

2011-09-25T00:00:00Z,"FINK--Rebecca, passed away at age 95 on September 22, 2011 at her home in Boca Raton, Florida peacefully, surrounded by her family and dedicated nurses. The daughter of Pearl Margolis and Cantor Jacob Margolis, sister of the late Yona, Dora, Geula, Bela, and Jon. She proudly graduated from Freeport High School, Pratt College, and went to work in the fledgling Manhattan fashion industry as a dress designer. A beauty with unmatched intellect, with a strong religious background ventured out into the secular world. She married her polar opposite, Dr. Benjamin Fink, in 1939, and soon was left stateside to raise as a single Jewish woman in a backward South, two children, Gerald and Robert, while her husband served in the South Pacific, punctuated by conjugal visits to Rebecca from 1939-1946. Following WWII, they settled in Freeport, NY, where Ben was the ultra-dedicated GP whose office was adjacent to their home. Rebecca and Ben raised four children, of whom she was proud: Dr. Gerald Fink (Dr. Rosalie), Dr. Robert Fink (Geri), Dr. Alan Fink (Phyllis), Dr. Janet Kowal (Dr. Robert). She is also survived by her loving grandchildren: Julia Feldman (Uri), Dr. Jennifer Fink (Sarah Sohn), Peninah Salad (Rabbi Jay), Deena Taggert (Nissim), Anna Kaminetsky (Shimon), and Sara Wachtel (Jonathan), Dr. Gregg Fink (Jennifer), Matthew Fink, Dr. Rachel Kowal (Matt Feldman), Brian Kowal (Lorin), as well as 33 great-grandchildren. She raised her family and her husband with love, discipline and loyalty that never changed to the day she died. An extremely private woman, she mastered every challenge she came in contact with: fashion design, painting, cooking, fishing, and remaining a loyal sorority sister for over 50 years. Moving to Florida in the 1970s with Ben and many of their childhood and college friends, she enjoyed the sunshine, easy friendships, the sporadic visits of her working children, and the attention of many of her grandchildren. Her loyalty to her family, her intellectual rigor, her amazing fish dishes, and her proud independence will never be forgotten by those who knew her. A remarkable woman, she was helped immensely to reach 95 by the love of her grandson, Brian Kowal, granddaughter Peninah Salad, and aid/friend Rythnade Sylvain. Contributions can be made in her honor to Ruth Rales Jewish Family Service of South Palm Beach County, 7901 W. Atlantic Ave., Delray Beach, FL 33446."

2011-09-25T00:00:00Z,"The designer Blake Simpson started coming out from Los Angeles to Joshua Tree in the late 1990s, after buying a house in the desert that he's still tinkering with. At the time, he was making furniture for Marc Jacobs and for the renovation of the Sunset Tower Hotel. Then, in 2002, he spotted the 1950s motel that would become his new five-room hideaway, Mojave Sands (mojavesands.com; doubles from $200). ''It was just sitting there, more or less abandoned,'' he says. ''But I could see that it had really good bones.'' True to the D.I.Y. culture of the high desert, Simpson did a lot of the nine-year renovation himself, stripping and sanding the concrete floors and putting up honey-colored cedar planks for walls. He made the beds from black walnut and paired them with new and vintage modern furniture. And he used perforated metal tread plates to create a private patio for each room. Simpson did have a little help from his friends, like the ''California hippie in his mid-60s'' who Simpson says turned up at just the right time to lay the dry-stacked slate for the facade. His stylist pal Laurel Rose made the curtains from linen inset with scraps from vintage saris. And his neighbor, the actress Ann Magnuson, helped him trawl the local flea markets for decor - ''objets d'art that Blake finds like stray kittens,'' as she puts it - including midcentury Scandinavian pottery, manual typewriters and vintage record players. (Every room has one; there's wi-fi but no TV.)"

I think this picture was taken before the gig, and the reason I can tell the difference between pre- and postgig is that Kurt [Cobain] was seriously injured by jumping into my drum set. That bottle he's holding out toward the camera was some kind of incredibly potent cough syrup, and he was carrying that thing around like a flask. So this is preshow, and he was drinking that cough syrup, which led him to dive into my drum set, which put him in a sling for the rest of the night. That gig was definitely a triumph.

Playoff-bound contenders have teammates who could spoil their chances. A pitcher is a strong contender for the first time in 20 years. The tricky part for voters is defining the word value. ''I just think they should get rid of the name,'' said Davey Lopes, the first-base coach for the Los Angeles Dodgers. ''As players - and I know how it was - when we talk about most valuable player, we all didn't say, 'Who's the most valuable player to the team?'

2011-09-25T00:00:00Z,"Packers (2-0) at Bears (1-1) Sunday, 4:15 p.m. Line: Packers 3 . Jay Cutler is a 50-Tesla, super-cooled, solenoid-style electromagnet for criticism. He can attract scorn from hundreds of miles away. Everything about Cutler's career is polarizing: the gaudy statistics that contrast his 35-35 win-loss record; his penchant for turnovers; his snippy, irritable public demeanor; and his career-long association with mercurial offensive masterminds like Mike Shanahan, Josh McDaniels and Mike Martz, who only magnify his peculiar attraction-repulsion effect. Last season's N.F.C. championship game became Ferris Cutler's Day Off, with the (somewhat) injured quarterback looking less willing than able on the sideline as his backups got battered by the Packers. It was the type of nonperformance that defines a career, fairly or not, and a win Sunday could deflect a tiny bit of criticism. Unfortunately, Cutler's Bears are 1-4 against the Packers in the past two seasons, and their offensive line is still bad enough to make even the toughest quarterback consider using a sick day. Pick: Packers Texans (2-0) at Saints (1-1) Sunday, 1 p.m. Line: Saints by 4. Had the Texans faced the Saints last year, Drew Brees would have thrown for 600 yards. Houston's defense has improved drastically since then. The coordinator Wade Phillips has apparently grown smarter since leaving the Cowboys (it's a common phenomenon), and newcomers like cornerback Johnathan Joseph and the rookie defensive lineman J.J. Watt have helped the star pass rusher Mario Williams make an early impact. The Texans rank first in the N.F.L. in pass defense, though the Dolphins' defeatist attack and the Colts' ''Men of a Certain Age'' offense did not offer the kind of test the Texans face this week. The Saints offense is just like it was in previous years, only moreso: the arrivals of running backs Darren Sproles and Mark Ingram have more than offset the loss of the injured receiver Marques Colston. The offense no longer gets much attention because a) we are used to it and b) offensive production around the league is so high that Brees can complete 67.4 percent of his passes and throw for six touchdowns in two weeks without attracting notice. The first team to score 30 points will win this game, but at least the Texans defense is now good enough to keep that from happening before halftime. Pick: Saints"

Mr. Zeckendorf, who paid $29.1 million for the five-bedroom five-and-a-half-bathroom apartment, had sold his penthouse at 15 Central Park West in December, making a $30 million profit. He then bought the 927 Fifth Avenue property from the estate of Bruce Wasserstein, the chairman and chief executive of Lazard who died in 2009. A few months later he decided to sell, saying the space was too large, and listed it for $31.5 million."

It was opening night for this latest branch of the country's popular Crepaway restaurants, and because it sits right on the city's former Green Line - the no man's land that separated the Christian East from the Muslim West during Lebanon's 15-year civil war, which ended in 1990 - there were slickly designed posters depicting army tanks with the words the art of peace on every wall. Everyone ate sliders, drank vodka cocktails from an open bar and shifted fluidly between English, French and Arabic. The crowd looked more Marais than Middle East: boys wore mustaches and skinny jeans, the girls floaty minidresses and gladiator heels. If people weren't dancing to the pounding nu-disco, they were screaming over one another while they texted and tweeted."
2011-09-25T00:00:00Z,"AMATO--Robert A. Robert A. Amato, died on September 19, 2011. He was born on June 17, 1931 in Corona, New York and grew up in Bayside, New York. He lived for many of his years in Garden City, New York and New York City. He was a long term resident of East Hampton, New York and Palm Beach, Florida. He passed away as a result of an unknown ischemic event, and fell into a coma from which he never recovered. In many ways he lived the American dream. He graduated from Bayside High and worked in the family garage door business in Maspeth, New York. He served his countryduring the Korean War in the U.S. Air Force. Seeking greener pastures, the arc of his life changed dramatically when he chose a white-collar career. He began his transformation with General Binding Corp., the Yellow pages and eventually landed at Jobson Publishing Corporation. At the retirement of the founder Frank Jobson, with little capital, but much spirit and spunk, he spearheaded a leveraged buy-out of Jobson Publishing. Under his astute and streetwise leadership, he grew Jobson Publishing from a small 10-person liquor industry publisher, into a 400+ employee market leader in the international healthcare marketplace. He became a respected industry visionary in the worldwide eyecare and eyewear market. One of the founders of The Vision Industry Council of America, now The VisionCouncil, he was instrumental in developing the International Vision Expo shows, now among the most well attended and important in the industry. He was honored for his leadership with The Ben Robinson Award by the United Jewish Appeal (UJA). He retired in May 2005 and Jobson's continued market leadership is a symbol of his business legacy. He traveled the world, but found his greatest joy in the company of his family. His true love and constant companion was his wife of 23 years, Nancy Amato, who survives him. He is also survived by his children, Janet Moffitt (Rick Ringhausen), Robert S. Amato (Anne), Ronald J. Amato (Jeanne), Roger C. Amato (Debra) and Jill Wilkins (Chris). Additionally he leaves behind his 13 grandchildren and two great-grandchildren. He will be deeply missed by all who loved him. Apassionate believer in the transformative nature of education, Bob created the Robert & Nancy Amato Education Foundation, to support the college education of disadvantaged children. A memorial service will be held Friday September 30, 2011 at the Frank Campbell Funeral home, 1076 Madison Avenue (81st and Madison), NYC at 11:30 am.

Son of John Willard Huntington and Patricia Shaffer Huntington, Derek was born on 26 February 1947 and grew up in West Hartford, CT. He graduated from Phillips Academy Andover in 1965 and Yale College in 1969. At Yale he was a nationally ranked lacrosse player, and a member of Fence Club and Scroll & Key Senior Society. Music was always a vital part of Derek's life. Throughout the 1970's he was a professional singer, songwriter, music producer and sound engineer, living and performing in Los Angeles, Boston and across New England. In 1980, Derek moved to Manhattan and in 1982 he founded ZZZ Carpentry, a high-end residential construction firm, collaborating closely with a number of notable architects on both traditional and modern renovations. Derek was an avid fresh and salt water fly fisherman, an enthusiastic tennis player, and an all-around athlete. He was a summer resident of Saltaire on Fire Island. Derek had many friends whom he loved and who loved him. He is survived by his wife and partner of 21 years, Caroline Northcote Sidnam, son Samuel Dworkin Huntington, stepdaughter Emma X Sidnam Pucci, stepson Samuel Northcote Pucci, former wife Elizabeth Dworkin, sister Sara Huntington Ohly of New Haven, CT and brother John Willard Huntington of Chicago IL.

2011-09-25T00:00:00Z,"After closing its doors in 2005 for a rafters-to-orchestra-pit renovation, Moscow's Bolshoi Theater still kicked up controversy - embezzlement, corruption, sex scandal. Now, three years past due and way over budget, the hall, which dates to 1825, will reopen next month with a gala performance of the ballet and opera companies' greatest hits. In attendance will be President Dmitri Medvedev and other heads of state, who will finally see what $760 million restores. It took more than 3,500 workers to restore the Apollo and the Muses ceiling piece, replicate the missing Villeroy & Boch tiles and hang 617 pounds of crystal from the main chandelier. Much of the work was supervised by the president's office itself, which stepped in when construction faltered in 2009, after a contractor was paid three times for the same work. Now the acoustics are fixed, subterranean hydraulic stages are built, and, for the finishing touch, the Romanov coat of arms has been reinstated above the lintels, in place of the hammer and sickle. This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print."

Fall's novelty is a carwash-flap design from Alexander Wang (just don't ride a bicycle in it). Also seen is Dior's successful revival of 1950s luncheon dresses with draped necklines. It's too bad they were kept hidden in the showroom while exaggerated designs were sent down the runway to entertain the media; luckily, store buyers concentrate on the offstage collection of wearable clothes.

Bloomberg, was strolling through a slum. A city of about two million in the middle of the Amazon, Manaus is where the Boston-based microfinance group Accion International started an ambitious lending operation in February, and Taylor, who is chairwoman of the group's board, had flown down with a delegation of staff and investors to observe how the experiment was coming along on the ground. Nearly six feet tall, thin and wearing large, round sunglasses, khaki pants and leather driving moccasins that had the kind of distressed effect only years of wear can produce, Taylor did not blend in. But as pedestrians paused to stare, she neither reveled in the attention nor was fazed by it, instead noting details of the storefronts she passed: whether they had adequate signage, say, or were advantageously located in front of a bus stop. After two blocks, having passed four businesses bearing stickers with Accion's logo - indications that the owners had taken out loans - Taylor stopped in front of a cellphone supply kiosk. ''These are really smart,'' she said, pointing to a sticker in the shop's window. ''We should have them everywhere!''"

The stalks stand shoulder to shoulder like an army without rank, their sharp-edged, swordlike leaves forming a nearly impenetrable wall. A modern cornfield would have rebuffed Cary Grant in ''North by Northwest'' because there are no rows to speak of, only a dense lattice of intersecting spears. This corn - grown by the tens of millions of acres - has been genetically engineered, altered by having stacks of apparently desirable traits wedged into its genetic code. Saving the kernels of engineered corn in the fall to plant in the spring is both illegal, because of company patents, and largely irrelevant, since the plants they yield, which contain a packet of foreign genes, won't necessarily resemble the parent crop. Nearly all the corn you see anywhere in our nation of corn is this year's model, new and, so they say, improved. Genetically modified corn is the path industrial agriculture has chosen - a profoundly controversial one. But a growing movement of gardeners and small farmers is keeping alive the genetic diversity that modern agriculture has rejected."

Still to come are structures by Gehry, Oscar Niemeyer, Norman Foster and Renzo Piano.

2011-09-25T00:00:00Z,"FOUNDED 250 years ago, Pittsfield, Mass., is a model of old Americana: a mixture of handsome 19th-century buildings and stately early-20th-century homes, with the Berkshire Mountains just a stone's throw away. By the middle of the last century, it was a bustling urban town center with a steady stream of work provided by General Electric. But by the 1970s, the city had fallen on hard times, after G.E. moved operations south and left PCBs in the Housatonic River. It seemed that Pittsfield had been passed over by the golden touch that had brought wealth and tourists to surrounding Berkshire towns. But in the last few years Pittsfield has begun to reawaken. The bones of those old buildings are still as beautiful as they were midcentury. And there are now galleries, boutiques and restaurants opening up where ''For Rent'' signs long dominated.SARAH WILDMAN"

This was the so-called ''Mexican Suitcase,'' the lost cache of Spanish Civil War photos by Robert Capa, Gerda Taro and David Seymour.

""I try to morph the three,"" says Cain, whose site-specific work dips into a playfully vivid palette that defies her contemplative nature. Cain used abandoned buildings to develop her style, and some of her earliest efforts, along the dirt roads of her native upstate New York, went entirely unseen. A 2004 installation in a squat in San Francisco's North Beach, however, brought her the attention of the art world. She is now represented by Honor Fraser in L.A. and Anthony Meier Fine Arts in San Francisco and was recently commissioned by LAND (Los Angeles Nomadic Division) to do an installation in a former Masonic lodge in Marfa, Tex. On view through Dec. 4 as part of a suite of public projects, ""Forget Me Not"" takes its name from the flower pin once worn by the Masons and later adopted by the Nazis. ""Supreme Being"" (above), a three-dimensional canvas bordered in gold leaf, is the only component Cain created off-site for the piece; its diagonal stripes were traced from the floorboards in her studio."

2011-09-26T00:00:00Z,"FINK--Rebecca, passed away at age 95 on September 22, 2011 at her home in Boca Raton, Florida peacefully, surrounded by her family and dedicated nurses. The daughter of Pearl Margolis and Cantor Jacob Margolis, sister of the late Yona, Dora, Geula, Bela, and Jon. She proudly graduated from Freeport High School, Pratt College, and went to work in the fledgling Manhattan fashion industry as a dress designer. A beauty with unmatched intellect, with a strong religious background ventured out into the secular world. She married her polar opposite, Dr. Benjamin Fink, in 1939, and soon was left stateside to raise as a single Jewish woman in a backward South, two children, Gerald and Robert, while her husband served in the South Pacific, punctuated by conjugal visits to Rebecca from 1939-1946. Following WWII, they settled in Freeport, NY, where Ben was the ultra-dedicated GP whose office was adjacent to their home. Rebecca and Ben raised four children, of whom she was proud: Dr. Gerald Fink (Dr. Rosalie), Dr. Robert Fink (Geri), Dr. Alan Fink (Phyllis), Dr. Janet Kowal (Dr. Robert). She is also survived by her loving grandchildren: Julia Feldman (Uri), Dr. Jennifer Fink (Sarah Sohn), Peninah Salad (Rabbi Jay), Deena Taggert (Nissim), Anna Kaminetsky (Shimon), and Sara Wachtel (Jonathan), Dr. Gregg Fink (Jennifer), Matthew Fink, Dr. Rachel Kowal (Matt Feldman), Brian Kowal (Lorin), as well as 33 great-grandchildren. She raised her family and her husband with love, discipline and loyalty that never changed to the day she died. An extremely private woman, she mastered every challenge she came in contact with: fashion design, painting, cooking, fishing, and remaining a loyal sorority sister for over 50 years. Moving to Florida in the 1970s with Ben and many of their childhood and college friends, she enjoyed the sunshine, easy friendships, the sporadic visits of her working children, and the attention of many of her grandchildren. Her loyalty to her family, her intellectual rigor, her amazing fish dishes, and her proud independence will never be forgotten by those who knew her. A remarkable woman, she was helped immensely to reach 95 by the love of her grandson, Brian Kowal, granddaughter Peninah Salad, and aid/friend Rythnade Sylvain. Contributions can be made in her honor to Ruth Rales Jewish Family Service of South Palm Beach County, 7901 W. Atlantic Ave., Delray Beach, FL 33446."

He lived for many of his years in Garden City, New York and New York City. He was a long term resident of East Hampton, New York and Palm Beach, Florida. He passed away as a result of an unknown ischemic event, and fell into a coma from which he never recovered. In many ways he lived the American dream. He graduated from Bayside High and worked in the family garage door business in Maspeth, New York. He served his countryduring the Korean War in the U.S. Air Force. Seeking greener pastures, the arc of his life changed dramatically when he chose a white-collar career. He began his transformation with General Binding Corp., the Yellow pages and eventually landed at Jobson Publishing Corporation. At the retirement of the founder Frank Jobson, with little capital, but much spirit and spunk, he spearheaded a leveraged buy-out of Jobson Publishing. Under his astute and streetwise leadership, he grew Jobson Publishing from a small 10-person liquor industry publisher, into a 400+ employee market leader in the international healthcare marketplace. He became a respected industry visionary in the worldwide eyecare and eyewear market. One of the founders of The Vision Industry Council of America, now The VisionCouncil, he was instrumental in developing the International Vision Expo shows, now among the most well attended and important in the industry. He was honored for his leadership with The Ben Robinson Award by the United Jewish Appeal (UJA). He retired in May 2005 and Jobson's continued market leadership is a symbol of his business legacy. He traveled the world, but found his greatest joy in the company of his family. His true love and constant companion was his wife of 23 years, Nancy Amato, who survives him. He is also survived by his children, Janet Moffitt (Rick Ringhausen), Robert S. Amato (Anne), Ronald J. Amato (Jeanne), Roger C. Amato (Debra) and Jill Wilkins (Chris).

2011-09-26T00:00:00Z,"NOTABLE NUMBER The Jets seemed surprised that the Raiders shifted their coverage, favoring zone instead of man-to-man. Many of their receivers were shut down through three quarters. Plaxico Burress grabbed the first pass Mark Sanchez threw, then nothing again until midway through the fourth quarter, when he snared two, including a 16-yard touchdown that drew the Jets to 31-24. Santonio Holmes was targeted only twice. KEY PERFORMANCE The Jets at least had an encouraging day by Colin Baxter, who replaced the injured Nick Mangold at center. Baxter didn't make any glaring mistakes -- no fumbled exchanges with Mark Sanchez or penalties. The offensive line as a whole helped the Jets run the ball better than they have all season, at least at certain points. If Mangold cannot play next week, the Jets could do worse than having Baxter play again."

Kennedy Center for the Performing Arts in Washington said it would replace the long-maligned organ in its concert hall with a new 5,000-pipe instrument built by Casavant Frères of St-Hyacinthe, Quebec. The existing organ, which was built by Aeolian-Skinner and installed in 1972, has been criticized by performers and reviewers for its poor functioning and musical inadequacy. A 1997 renovation of the hall made the problems worse. ""It was getting to the point where it was ruining performances,"" said Jeff Weiler, an organ consultant hired by the Kennedy Center. The new organ will be installed starting next summer, with a 61-pipe stop incorporated from its predecessor.  The instrument will cost more than $2 million, the Kennedy Center said. David M. Rubenstein, the Kennedy Center's chairman and the managing director of the Carlyle Group, a private equity firm, is paying for the new organ and its installation."

The influential paper, published in Science, divided the challenge of keeping emissions of greenhouse gases through mid-century at levels prevailing in the 2000s into seven ""wedges"" of carbon dioxide reductions -- through switching to renewable and nuclear power, ramping up energy efficiency, ending deforestation and taking action in other areas.

2011-09-27T00:00:00Z,"An opera about Sun Yat-sen, China's first president and Nationalist leader, has been canceled shortly before its scheduled opening at the National Center for the Performing Arts in Beijing because of official objections to the music, according to the composer's representatives. The work, ''Dr. Sun Yat-sen'' by Huang Ruo and a production of Opera Hong Kong, was to have opened on Friday, roughly coinciding celebrations of the 100th anniversary of the Chinese revolution. Mr. Ruo's management, Karsten Witt Music Management in Berlin, said a government official had gone to rehearsals and decided that the music was inappropriate. ''I guess because maybe it's not romantic enough, something like that,'' said an agency representative, who spoke on condition of anonymity because she was not Mr. Ruo's individual agent. The representative said the objection was not over the content. The government long knew of the subject matter and had the libretto, she said.

2011-09-27T00:00:00Z,"Before he earned worldwide acclaim as the creator of Sherlock Holmes, a struggling physician named Arthur Conan Doyle tried his hand at a different kind of fiction writing: a novel from the perspective of a 50-year-old man who is confined to his room when he has an attack of gout. The original manuscript of that novel, titled ''The Narrative of John Smith,'' was lost in the mail en route to Conan Doyle's publishers, and though he later rewrote it from memory, the book was never published in his lifetime. Conan Doyle was later to remark: ''My shock at its disappearance would be as nothing to my horror if it were suddenly to appear again - in print.'' So Conan Doyle might want to brace himself, wherever he is. On Monday the British Library is releasing ''The Narrative of John Smith,'' representing the first time the novel will be available to a wide audience; the library will also display the manuscript at its Sir John Ritblat Treasures Gallery in London. A news release from the British Library said that the novel was written between 1883 and 1884 and described it as ''semi-autobiographical in nature,'' comprising the title character's ''reflections and conversations with his doctor, friends and other visitors concerning a range of contemporary debates on literature, science, religion, war and politics.'' When Conan Doyle wrote ''A Study in Scarlet'' a few years later, he retained some elements from ''John Smith,'' including the character's talkative landlady, Mrs. Rundle, who seems to be a precursor to Sherlock Holmes's Baker Street housekeeper, Mrs. Hudson."

(ESPN) CATCHING HELL (2011) On Oct. 14, 2003, elated Chicago Cubs fans believed they would host a World Series for the first time since 1945, as the team led the Florida Marlins, 3-0, in the eighth inning of Game 6 of the National League Championship Series at Wrigley Field. And then Steve Bartman, reaching for a foul pop fly from his seat in the stands, above, deflected the ball away from the Cubs' left fielder Moises Alou and set the stage for an eight-run rally by the Marlins -- and in the process became the focus of rage from fellow Cubs fans.

2011-09-28T20:15:21Z,"In response to the question posed in my previous essay in The Stone — “What is naturalism?”  — Alex Rosenberg defines it as “the philosophical theory that treats science as our most reliable source of knowledge and scientific method as the most effective route to knowledge.” His post, “Why I Am a Naturalist,” nicely exemplifies one of my main complaints, by leaving it unclear what he means by “science” or “scientific method,” even though it is crucial for what he is committing himself to as a “naturalist.” Still, there are clues. He describes “the test of knowledge that scientific findings attain” as “experimental/observational methods,” which suggests that theorems of mathematics would not count as scientific findings. The impression is confirmed by Professor Rosenberg’s phrase “mathematicians and scientists,” as though he doesn’t see mathematicians as scientists. That’s bad news for his naturalism, for mathematical proof is just as effective a route to knowledge as experimental/observational methods. Of course, since the natural sciences depend on mathematics, Rosenberg desires to find a place for it — but admits that he doesn’t know how."

2011-09-28T10:00:36Z,"Getting a read on the city of Los Angeles has never been easy. Twenty years ago, when my husband was offered a job in L.A., we left New York. I figured that as a writer, my work was portable, and as an urbanite, I would easily adjust. But Los Angeles, with its shifting perspectives and unwieldy size, was perplexing. When we first arrived, I spoke with an architectural historian on the verge of relocating. He offered me one salient tip before making his exit: ""The two most interesting things about Los Angeles,"" he said, ""are the domestic architecture and the ephemeral population."" He was right: the stream of characters is constant, and the number of exceptional houses is astonishing. And as the critic Reyner Banham had so famously done before me, I got my driver's license, began reading Esther McCoy and learned to love Los Angeles."

His teammate Greg Jennings thought it was ''the best play I've ever seen.'' With a little more than a minute left in the Packers' 27-17 victory over the Bears on Sunday, Green Bay punter Tim Masthay got off a towering kick meant to pin Chicago deep in its territory.

Kennedy Center for the Performing Arts in Washington said it would replace the long-maligned organ in its concert hall with a new 5,000-pipe instrument built by Casavant Freres of St-Hyacinthe, Quebec. The existing organ, which was built by Aeolian-Skinner and installed in 1972, has been criticized by performers and reviewers for its poor functioning and musical inadequacy. A 1997 renovation of the hall made the problems worse. ''It was getting to the point where it was ruining performances,'' said Jeff Weiler, an organ consultant hired by the Kennedy Center. The new organ will be installed starting next summer, with a 61-pipe stop incorporated from its predecessor. The instrument will cost more than $2 million, the Kennedy Center said. David M. Rubenstein, the Kennedy Center's chairman and the managing director of the Carlyle Group, a private equity firm, is paying for the new organ and its installation.

(BBC America) LUTHER Idris Elba (''The Wire'') returns as John Luther, a brilliant detective tormented by his own dark side, never mind those of the psychopaths he tracks down in the bowels of London. Last season he let a killer of children fall from a beam nearly to his death; became uncomfortably close to Alice Morgan (Ruth Wilson), a physicist who had killed her parents; and was framed for the murder of his wife by his colleague and best friend, Ian Reed (Steven Mackintosh). This four-part sequel finds a devastated Luther returning to work at the newly created Serious and Serial Unit, headed by the former complaints officer Martin Schenk (Dermot Crowley). Luther's first order of business is to keep his old partner Justin Ripley (Warren Brown) out of uniform. His second is to solve a series of ritualistic murders in historic locations while rescuing Jenny (Aimee Ffion Edwards, above with Mr. Elba), the daughter of an acquaintance, from the underbelly of prostitution. ''Law & Order: UK,'' in which a cop killer demands to be tried as a victim and not a murderer, leads in at 9. 8 P.M. (ABC) THE MIDDLE Axl (Charlie McDermott) gets Sue (Eden Sher) into trouble in high school. Mike (Neil Flynn) meets with the fourth grade teacher (Chord Overstreet), who is letting Brick (Atticus Shaffer) skip gym class. And Frankie (Patricia Heaton) tries to show everyone who's boss. In ''Modern Family,'' at 9, Phil (Ty Burrell) takes up tightrope walking; Claire (Julie Bowen) tries to teach the girls a life lesson; and Cameron (Eric Stonestreet) chooses the wrong time to go on a juice fast. In the Season 2 premiere of ''Happy Endings,'' at 9:30, Penny (Casey Wilson) buys a condo with a wine refrigerator and Italian marble countertops, and Jane (Eliza Coupe) persuades Alex (Elisha Cuthbert) and David (Zachary Knighton) to be honest with each other on the first anniversary of their almost marriage."

Both questions could be raised from the ratings for the second Monday night of the new television season as ABC's ''Dancing With the Stars'' posted its worst rating for a Monday performance show. And Fox's hugely promoted new time-travel prehistoric drama, ''Terra Nova,'' failed to stir overwhelming excitement for its two-hour premiere. For ''Dancing,'' ABC's most important show, the trend is looking serious, if not ominous: after being down 24 percent from last year in its premiere, it slid another 18 percent in Week 2, dropping to a 3.3 rating in the 18-to-49-year-old audience that is favored by many advertisers. That was down from a 4.0 last week and was the worst performance for the dance show's Monday edition. It also drew just over 16 million viewers, down from over 19 million last week. Fox is calling the performance of ''Terra Nova'' solid, and objectively it was, finishing with a 3 rating in that 18-to-49 audience, an improvement for Fox over its Monday average last season."

While 86 percent said they did not approve, that figure was based on about 1,000 readers who chose to answer the question when it was posted on the paper's Web site; the figure was not arrived at through a scientific ''poll'' in which The National Herald contacted readers. The article also misidentified the location of a nearby hardware store, whose owner said he resented such a public promotion of same-sex marriage.

2011-09-29T15:03:31Z,"I have written before about the folly of Major League Baseball's plans to expand its postseason by two teams, creating a sudden-death wild card playoff in both leagues.

Each designer was given a room in the hotel, with free rein to transform it into a kind of fashion installation and only one rule: Nothing was for sale. Clothes hung from the shower curtains above the Ace's claw-foot bathtubs; one designer carted in a half-dozen birch tree trunks to drive home a sylvan theme; another concocted a gruesome murder scene with three bloodied (yet impeccably dressed) victims strewn about the floor."

For several days now — pretty much since I wrote about how lucky I’ve been with the weather — the skies have been broodingly gray, the air has been heavy, the wind has been contrary and chill, and for a few hours each day I’ve been rained on. A couple of the days I could have stayed put, I guess, but at this point my legs start pedaling in the morning whether I’m on the bike or not, and rain is hardly catastrophic. Anyway, now that the Yankees are in the playoffs, I want to be home for the World Series. (Am I confident they’ll make it? Not really. As everyone knows, they don’t have the starting pitching.)"

Opacity still marks the popular conception of Africa, especially when it comes to its cities, which take a back seat to safari-ready grasslands and oceans of desert. To change this, the celebrated London architect David Adjaye began a decade-long quest to photograph Africa’s urban spaces — practically all of them, save the war-torn Somali capital, Mogadishu. “The project is really fueled by the widespread misconception of Africa as an impoverished or unpeopled expanse,” said Adjaye, who was born to Ghanaian parents in Dar es Salaam, Tanzania. “I was born in a metropolitan city; I was born in a cosmopolitan condition among different groups of Africans, Indians and Chinese.”"

Mr. Houghton said in an interview that Signature needed $20 million over the decade to cover the discounts and that it was seeking a new lead sponsor to make a multimillion-dollar commitment.

Fashion's rekindled infatuation with Modernism, expressed by talents like Jack McCollough and Lazaro Hernandez of Proenza Schouler and Consuelo Castiglioni of Marni, seems familiar in more ways than one. This is not, after all, the first time designers have revisited the prosperous postwar era to conjure a feeling of stability, one expected to resonate with anxious consumers. Reviving a period enriched by material comforts as substantial as a Steuben crystal bowl also represents a long-overdue return to old-fashioned concepts of quality."

But for many people in Myanmar, also known as Burma, the fears surrounding the Myitsone dam go much deeper. It will be the first dam across the Irrawaddy River, the iconic, even mythic waterway that has given life to centuries of Burmese civilization."

2011-09-29T00:00:00Z,"WALLACE--George A. P.,A professional engineer who dedicated much of his professional career to promoting the adoption of energy-saving technologies in home and industrial heating and cooling, died on September 25, 2011 in Lakeville, CT at age 85. He was a long-time resident of New York City and Northwest Corner, CT. Mr. Wallace came from a long line of Scottish explorers, soldiers, industrialists, and engineers. Born in Chester, PA in 1926, Mr. Wallace chose to pursue his education as a chemical engineer, graduating from Cornell University with a Bachelor's degree in Chemical Engineering and a Masters of Engineering certificate in 1947. With his strong engineering background, Mr. Wallace became a licensed Professional Engineer with the State of New York, a life member of the American Society of Heating, Refrigerating, and Air-conditioning Engineers and member of the New York Academy of Sciences. After a brief career in the chemical industry, Mr. Wallace, Samuel Eannace, and a group of associates formed Wallace Eannace Associates, Inc., a new type of sales engineering firm in the New York-New Jersey region. Specializing in pumping and heat transfer equipment, the company combines technical service and education with product distribution. His goals were to promote awareness of the need and feasibility of improving the efficiency of HVAC systems, a goal that was significantly stimulated during the 1970's when the US was suffering under the Arab oil embargo and was being forced to recognize the urgency of reducing its dependence on Mideast oil. Under this pressure and supported by government, HVAC engineers began to develop and install energy-conserving systems to replace older fuel-wasting types. One of Mr. Wallace's major disappointments was witnessing support for these innovations fade as cheap foreign oil once again became available. However, in Europe, a partnership of governments and industry was pushing greater efficiency in all energy use. Mr. Wallace studied these systems and helped to stimulate some adoption in the US. Coincidentally, nuclear energy was being promoted as the solution to fossil fuel dependency. Mr. Wallace was a member and backer of the Union of Concerned Scientists virtually from its inception and strongly supported their efforts to monitor the hazards of the expansion of the nuclear industry and its adaptation to military usage. Mr. Wallace long felt that commercial interests too often trump sound science in setting directions for bringing technological developments into use by society. He remained actively engaged in these issues and in his business interests virtually to the end of his life. In addition to his commitment to the Union of Concerned Scientists, Mr. Wallace was a dedicated supporter of many national and local environmental organizations, including Salisbury Land Trust, Sharon Audubon, Appalachian Mountain Club, American Bird Conservancy, and Sierra Club. Mr. Wallace served in the United States Navy as an Aviation Radio Technician during World War II and received an honorable discharge in 1946. He is fondly remembered by his family and friends as a sensitive man with a keen sense of the importance of personal relationships in private and professional life. Mr. Wallace was an extremely thoughtful and intellectual man who placed a high premium on dialogue, the objective exchange of ideas, and on scientific education and understanding in society. He was an avid reader and life-long student of world history. Mr. Wallace is survived by his wife of 54 years, Joan, a son, George E. Wallace of Warrenton, VA, two daughters, E. Ainslie Wallace of Salisbury, CT and Elaine Connolly of Scarborough, ME, and eight grandchildren. In lieu of flowers, please consider making a donation to the Union of Concerned Scientists either via their website at www.ucsusa.org or by mail to Union of Concerned Scientists, Attn: John Mace, 2 Brattle Square, Cambridge, MA 02138."

This essay is the third in a series of pamphlets published online by the Stanford Literary Lab. THE ARGUMENT The literary elite has traditionally served as judge and jury when it comes to measuring a contemporary writer's influence. Mr. Finn, who recently completed his doctorate in English at Stanford University, argues that there is a better way: ''We need to look beyond the symbolic markets of prestige to the real market, the site of mass literary consumption, where authors succeed or fail based on their ability to speak to that most diverse and complicated of readerships: the general public.''"

He was 92. His death was confirmed by his wife, Lyn. Mr. Rothman, an experienced distributor of American films to overseas audiences and an instinctive publicist, had become an independent operator in 1971 when he and the 82-year-old Chaplin met at the star's 38-acre Swiss estate and signed a $7 million deal for distribution rights to some of Chaplin's most famous work, including ''City Lights,''''Modern Times,''''The Gold Rush,''''Limelight,'' and ''The Great Dictator.''"

Everything from ""How can you tell if food is genetically engineered?"" to ""How many kinds of Pringles are there?"" (Anyone for Hong Kong Fish Balls? Yes, that's a flavor.) The longest answer is about 600 words, or less than one-tenth the size of a typical cover story, and there are more than 50 of them.

The timing was uncanny, as the provocateur was a large grasshopper that managed to make his rounds all the way over to where Orlando Pita was working on hair. Mosquitoes in Milan and grasshoppers, er sauterelles - not the garden variety - at the Musee de Rodin: oh my! The look, according to Pita was ""very fresh and modern, turning a page from the past,"" at least for this season. This meant a twist of a bun with a side part and slight wave in the front created by using Pita's Plump for volume, control hairspray and dry shampoo. The trick was that there was no ponytail beneath to hold the hair; it was deceptively simple. For makeup, McGrath went with a contoured eye and ""classic, beautiful red lip."" One of the 28 members of McGrath's team brought a face by for her approval. ""Don't forget, kids: not a hard lip with pencil, I prefer the finger, it's softer."" This is what made the lady modern. Three of Dior's reds were used, chosen based on the clothes: red orange, blue orange and pinky red. Nails were also a mix of five shades: Incognito, a nude; Riviera, an orange; Waterlily, a green; Forget me not, a lavender; and Lucky, a red."

2011-09-30T08:00:51Z,"Each April, during the Milan Furniture Fair, the German lighting designer Ingo Maurer presents an exhibition of new work. These shows, which highlight Maurer's innovative, provocative and poetic pieces (and those of designers whose ideas he finds interesting), never fail to impress. But this year, Maurer - who designs everything from table lights to subway stations, and who was recently awarded the prestigious Compasso d'Oro for career achievement - outdid himself with a design that was, in a word, enchanting. A 12-foot-high hanging mass of emerald-green sponges seemed to glow from within (thanks to hidden L.E.D.'s), and teemed with life in the form of about 100 exquisite, hand-painted models of butterflies, dragonflies, lizards and other creatures. This wasn't, strictly speaking, a light fixture - not that it mattered to besotted observers. But what exactly was it?"

Perhaps the most countercultural and sunshiny of the opening parties will be the Tresspass Parade barnstorming Downtown L.A.'s historic Broadway district on Sunday morning. The event - helmed by the genre-bending artists Arto Lindsay and Rirkrit Tiravanija, and organized by former the Milan gallerist Emi Fontana's Pasadena project space West of Rome - is a celebration of Southern California's time-honored tradition of festive dissidence. Floats, costumes and other parade paraphernalia should be done up in subversive style.

2011-09-30T06:00:00Z,"Jets (2-1) at Ravens (2-1)Sunday, 8:20 p.m.Line: Ravens by 3.5.Any team coached by a member of the Ryan family does not so much play a 16-game schedule as careen from bitter rivalry to bitter rivalry, each game becoming the kind of over-boiled grudge match usually settled with suplexes and folding chairs at ringside. It happened to Buddy Ryan's Eagles, and it has happened to Rex Ryan's Jets.Jets-Cowboys becomes Rex Ryan against Rob Ryan. Jets-Patriots becomes Rex Ryan against Bill Belichick. Jets-Ravens devolves into Rex Ryan against the team that declined to promote him to head coach when he was its defensive coordinator. Next time the Jets face the Raiders, it will be Rex Ryan against the team that broke his quarterback's nose. Even Rex Ryan could not muster a feud with the Jaguars, but Joe Namath got into the act this week, so if you play the current Jets against the 1968 version in a video game, that is now a grudge match, too.Granted, the presence of the ex-Ravens Bart Scott, Jim Leonhard and Derrick Mason on the Jets roster does give the game a familiarity-breeds-contempt angle. ""This is a family game, but it's also a heated rivalry,"" said Ravens defensive end Terrell Suggs, perhaps not realizing that Jets charity softball tournaments are also heated rivalries. ""You've got to go beat up on the ones you love."" In other words, this time it's personal. Just like all the other times. Pick: Jets."

He was 59. The cause of death was bacterial sepsis. His husband, Steven Natterstad, MD, and his sister, Linda Godfrey, were with Bob when he died. His dog, Presto, was also close by. Bob was a physician, an educator, a tireless advocate for the HIV/AIDS community, a trustee of Oberlin College and a concert pianist. His love of life, keen intellect, sense of humor and ever-present smile will be missed by all who knew him. His boundless generosity with his time, his energy and his advocacy encompassed his family, his friends and his community alike. Dr. Frascino crossed the line from physician to patient when an occupational exposure resulted in his testing HIV positive. In 1996, when his health began to fail, he gave up his HIV/AIDS medical practice and turned his efforts to HIV education and fundraising. In his words, ""I could now speak with the knowledge and authority of a physician, but with the eyes and heart and soul of a patient."" He and Steve, both concert pianists, founded the Concerted Effort benefit concert series, raising funds for crucial HIV/AIDS services worldwide. Concerted Effort 2011, the 17th in the series, was to take place on September 18, the day following Bob's death. Dr. Frascino served as a physician expert at The Body, an HIV/AIDS website. Known as ""Dr. Bob"" to his global online community, he touched the lives of millions of people through his forums and blog. In addition to his husband and sister, Bob is survived by his parents, Jennie and Angelo Frascino of Saratoga, CA, and by many friends, colleagues and ""eyeballs"" around the world. A ceremony will be held November 11 at Villa Montalvo, Saratoga, CA. A reception will follow.

He was Archbishop Marcel Lefebvre -- not Bishop Bernard Fellay, who was one of the four bishops ordained, and subsequently excommunicated. The report also misstated a detail behind the international anger over Pope Benedict XVI's lifting of the excommunications of the four bishops in 2009. The anger arose because one of the four bishops, Richard Williamson, was already known to have denied the scope of the Holocaust. That information had not just emerged."

The big picture, in fact, has gotten much worse. Greece's indebtedness is growing, European bank balance sheets are shakier and investors are increasingly skeptical that Europe has the will to stabilize shaky credit and stock markets. Also conspicuously lacking is any clear plan for generating the economic growth needed to begin paying down those growing debts."

He was graduated from The Choate School and from Harvard College, Magna cum Laude, Phi Beta Kappa. While at Harvard, he was published in ""The New Republic"" and had covered the coal mines of Pennsylvania and West Virginia, textile mill towns in the South and the drought in the dust bowls of the Midwest. He then became a junior foreign correspondent in London and the Balkans for Raymond Moley's Today magazine.

He volunteered for the infantry the day after the United States entered the war and served in Iceland, England, France, the Battle of the Bulge and Germany rising to the rank of captain. On his voyage home he wrote ""America's Germany"", which had been commissioned by Random House. Returning to Life Magazine for a few years, he left to become executive editor of True, then the world's largest men's magazine, and subsequently editor-in-chief of its sister magazine, Today's Woman. In the early sixties he formed The Julian Bach Literacy Agency with the help of Christopher Shaw, eventually representing some 500 primarily American and English authors. He loved music and was a devotee of concerts and the Metropolitan Opera. An enthusiastic traveler, he particularly liked hiking in the Swiss Alps. He attended virtually every Harvard varsity and freshman football game, both home and away until his mid eighties. His brief marriage to Kathryn Rains ended in divorce.

2011-10-01T00:00:00Z,"NO. 8 NEBRASKA AT NO. 7 WISCONSIN 8 p.m. Eastern, ABC Nebraska's first Big Ten game is one of the most anticipated matchups of the season. This is the first meeting of top-10 teams in Madison since 1962. So far, Wisconsin, behind quarterback Russell Wilson, has overwhelmed opponents. Nebraska has also scored a lot of points, but its defense has been suspect, giving up 29 points to Fresno State and 38 against Washington. The Cornhuskers will need to be better defensively, but much also hinges on the play of quarterback Taylor Martinez. While Wilson looks to throw before scrambling, Martinez is second in the Big Ten with 421 yards rushing and has run for seven touchdowns. Nebraska is 10-0 when he rushes for more than 50 yards."

2011-10-01T00:00:00Z,"10 P.M. (Cinemax) BLACK SWAN (2010) Natalie Portman, above, in the role that earned her an Academy Award, stars as Nina, a ballerina teetering on the brink of insanity as she tries to break out of the corps and into the dual lead of ''Swan Lake'': the Swan Queen and her villainous black swan twin. Mila Kunis is Lily, the sultry newcomer who is everything the increasingly tormented Nina is not, as their company's artistic director, Thomas (Vincent Cassel), insists on pointing out. And Barbara Hershey is Nina's mother, a former dancer who desperately wants her daughter to achieve everything she never could. The result is ''a witchy brew of madness and cunning,'' Manohla Dargis wrote in The New York Times about this film from Darren Aronofsky (''The Wrestler''), which also earned Oscar nominations for best director and picture. ''One of the pleasures of 'Black Swan' is its lack of reverence toward the rarefied world of ballet, which to outsiders can look as lively as a crypt,'' Ms. Dargis said. ''Mr. Aronofsky makes this world (or his version of it) exciting partly by pulling back the velvet curtains and showing you the sacrifices and crushingly hard work that go into creating beautiful dances.'' She added, ''Much like the new version of 'Swan Lake' that Thomas creates, 'Black Swan' is visceral and real even while it's one delirious, phantasmagoric freakout.''

His every action inspired generations of Fiduciary Trust employees to listen carefully, speak softly, and act honorably. George operated with an unfailing moral compass. He was a true gentleman of great character and wisdom, and a lover of birds and the environments that nurtured them.

A proud graduate of Harvard and Harvard Business School, George dedicated his life to his family and the service of his community. An avid birder, he served on the board of St. Philip's Academy, was the former president of the New Jersey Audubon, a long time advisor to the New York City Audubon, a founding member of the Bird-Safe Glass Foundation and a Life Trustee of the Manomet Center for Conservation.

Thus while a few people may agree with Perry because they really think that the scientific evidence supports creationism, I suspect that for most people, scientific evidence (or its lack) has nothing to do with it. Their belief in creationism is instead a reflection of a deeply held epistemic principle: that, at least on some topics, scripture is a more reliable source of information than science.  For others, including myself, this is never the case."

He can also fill in at second or third base, although not particularly well.

The new show begins with a husband and wife (Dylan McDermott of ""The Practice"" and Connie Britton of ""Friday Night Lights"") and their teenage daughter (Taissa Farmiga) moving to Los Angeles to start their lives fresh. But their new Gothic fixer-up was a steal for a reason: it's haunted by a history of murder and visited by creepy neighbors, housekeepers and unwelcome guests (including Jessica Lange, Frances Conroy and Denis O'Hare) as well as a mysterious figure in a full-body S&M costume, whom the ""American Horror Story"" producers have affectionately dubbed ""Rubber Man."""

A few thoughts:In the early 1970s, as pro football was becoming the nation's most popular spectator sport, a group of ex-players exposed, through both their words and their actions, the game's seamy underside. A novel by Pete Gent, ""North Dallas Forty,"" based on his five years with the Cowboys, graphically depicted the pain and anguish the public couldn't feel or see on their television screens. Yet, despite the broken bones and sleepless nights, most of the players wished it could go on forever.

2011-10-02T00:00:00Z,"''Quirky but serious'' is how the architect George L. Legendre describes ''Pasta by Design'' (Thames & Hudson, $30), his taxonomy of 92 noodles, from the itty-bitty acini de pepe to ziti. Legendre shares his South London office with a fellow architect and inveterate pasta preparer, Marco Guarnieri, who gave him the idea to catalog with mathematical exactitude the difference between, say, fusilli and fusilli Capri. (The latter is longer, but both go great with a ragu.) Home cooks might blanch at the CAD-style schematics and trigonometric equations, but they can nonetheless appreciate that each pasta profile comes with cooking times and serving suggestions. This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print."
2011-10-02T00:00:00Z,"MITROVICA, Kosovo -- After years of impasse between the national government of Kosovo and ethnic Serbs demanding autonomy within their northern enclave in the new country, international pressure has intensified on the Serbs. And while the immediate result has been minor clashes, there is new hope for some movement toward a resolution for the last geopolitically unsettled chunk of the former Yugoslavia. Frustrated by European-backed attempts to impose Kosovar police and customs officials in northern Kosovo last month, Serbian protesters set up road blocks -- a common tactic here over the years. When troops from KFOR, the NATO-led international force in Kosovo, moved on Tuesday to tear down the barricades, they said they were met by Serbian protesters who fired on them with small arms and threw rocks and pipe bombs. Sixteen protesters were reported injured, as were nine soldiers."

So Pillsbury technicians working on behalf of the space agency came up with the next best thing: a vitamin-rich, wand-shaped goo that could fit through the mouth hole in the astronauts' helmets. The Space Food Stick, a kind of proto-energy-bar, went up with a Skylab mission and became one of the culinary phenoms of the 1970s. But such innovations proved more popular with 6-year-olds than with astronauts. ''In the Mercury mission, NASA supplied the astronauts with the meal-in-a-cube,'' says Maya Cooper, a senior research scientist with Lockheed Martin and a contractor with NASA. The problem was that ''when the crews returned from space, so did the cubes. They refused to eat them. You can't ignore the psychological aspects of eating.''"
2011-10-02T00:00:00Z,"In the woods outside Livade (pronounced lee-VAH-deh), a village in the north-central hills of the Istrian Peninsula in Croatia, the fall means truffle hunting. Dogs charge through autumnal leaves and oak branches along barely perceptible paths blazed by generations that came before, leading their owners to prized white delicacies. Such trophies, which some consider better and stronger in both taste and aroma than their more famous cousins from the Piedmont region of Italy, often end up at the markets and restaurants in and around Livade, the country's truffle hub. If one were to compare white truffles, which can cost thousands of dollars per pound, to diamonds, one could call Livade Croatia's Antwerp. Even with a minuscule population of 190 set around a lone roundabout with three restaurants, it's the site of two truffle fairs during the fall. One, Zigante Tartufi Days (sajamtartufa.com), begins in October, during white truffle season. Over six weekends, the festival provides demonstrations on how to hunt for, purchase and cook with the area's fungal tubers."

2011-10-02T00:00:00Z,"IT'S a pleasure to see Alessandra Facchinetti back on the runway. You may remember her from her brief moment at Gucci, in 2004, when she succeeded Tom Ford. Then, following Valentino's retirement, she took over the creative direction at that house. It was, let us say, an impossible job, and her first ready-to-wear collections were tentative. At the time I thought: too many hands in this kitchen. But then she delivered a gorgeous haute couture collection for Valentino that I still vividly remember, the kind of witty femininity that could let in some much-needed air. Ms. Facchinetti is now designing for Uniqueness, an online project conceived by Pietro Negra, the chief executive of Pinko, a contemporary fashion label in Italy. Over a Diet Coke at the Bristol hotel in Paris the other day, she explained that Mr. Negra approached her about six months ago. ''I thought it was an interesting challenge to do something that was seasonless and on the Web,'' she said. ''Because it's how most of us live today.''"
2011-10-02T00:00:00Z,"When you make your own sandwich, you anticipate its taste as you're working on it. And when you think of a particular food for a while, you become less hungry for it later. Researchers at Carnegie Mellon University, for example, found that imagining eating M&Ms makes you eat fewer of them. It's a kind of specific satiation, just as most people find room for dessert when they couldn't have another bite of their steak. The sandwich that another person prepares is not ''preconsumed'' in the same way."

''Ukraine gave the world very many geniuses, but they're not listed as Ukrainian due to Ukraine's geopolitical situation. Not many people know that Kazimir Malevich was born in Kiev.'' The Mystetskyi Arsenal, housed in a former weapons arsenal built at Catherine the Great's orders, will go some way toward remedying that situation. When completed - by 2014, at a cost of $250 million - it will have nearly one million square feet of floor space. (A Malevich retrospective is in the works for the 2014 grand opening.) For now it's a work in progress, with temporary exhibitions. The ART-Kyiv contemporary art fair will run there Nov. 2 to 13., and the first international biennale of contemporary art in Ukraine, ARSENALE, is to open on May 17 and runs through July 30. As a tourist attraction the museum is meant to lure visitors to Kiev, Ukraine's capital, in tandem with the Kiev Monastery of the Caves next door, founded in the 11th century."

''It's like a big family dinner where everybody shows up,'' says Erwan (above, seated). The family, in this case, is the brothers' radically original work, from ''Lit Clos'' of 2000, a raised, semi-enclosed bed like a bird cage, to ''Ploum,'' a new sofa for Ligne Roset, which they compare to a very ripe fruit. This is the Bouroullecs' first major show in their native France, organized by ambience and demarcated by supersize versions of their room-divider designs, including the plastic seaweed-inspired ''Algues'' and their textile ''Clouds''; one long wall will hold nearly 300 drawings. To coincide with the show, Phaidon is releasing a new monograph of their work. ''We're still young, so a celebration of our career is nice but a little anxiety-inducing,'' said Ronan, the older of the two, who recently turned 40. ''Each time we do an exhibition it feels like: that's done, let's move on to something else.'' That something else will be a permanent lighting installation for the Gabriel staircase in the Chateau de Versailles.

2011-10-02T00:00:00Z,"Since Georges Méliès took audiences on a trip to the Moon in 1902, filmmakers have been putting their visions of the future on the big screen. While some have focused on extremely distant time frames, many have tackled eras not too far from their own. The latest to look at the near-future is ''Real Steel'' (opening Friday), which sets its sights on 2020. By then, according to the film, the new sport of robot boxing will have emerged, with machines replacing people in the ring. The director, Shawn Levy, said he was more interested in telling a humanistic story (featuring Hugh Jackman, right, and the young Dakota Goyo) than creating a heavily sci-fi feel. ''We adopted a mantra that Tom Meyer, my production designer, coined, called 'retro forward,' '' Mr. Levy said. ''The movie has a real pastiche of iconic Americana with futuristic technological touches.'' Scenes of rodeos, motels and the open road converge with high-tech machines that can be operated remotely via bodily movement, much like playing an Xbox with Kinect. It's a lighter, less cynical view of what's to come than has been typically portrayed. Here is a survey of some other films set in very different near-futures."
2011-10-02T00:00:00Z,"When Caroline Burnett decided to open Heroes, in Berlin's Neukölln district, her initial emphasis was not on food.

Today she and her partner, Damien Poinsard, a French-born cook who helps run a theater group on the side, are drawing regulars as much with their down-home fare as with their roster of up-and-coming artists. Crepes and quiches are standards; specials depend on who's cooking. If Poinsard is in the kitchen, the menu might include pot au feu or stewed chicken; when Burnett is in, she says, the special is likely to be meatloaf, reflecting her nostalgia for home."

2011-10-02T00:00:00Z,"In centuries past, Africa was known as the ''Dark Continent,'' which originated less as a slur than as a testament to the deficiency of mapmakers: clueless about the continent's interior, they would often just blot it out, as if the place didn't fully exist. Opacity still marks the popular conception of Africa, especially when it comes to its cities, which take a back seat to safari-ready grasslands and oceans of desert. To change this, the celebrated London architect David Adjaye began a decade-long quest to photograph Africa's urban spaces - practically all of them, save the war-torn Somali capital, Mogadishu. ''The project is really fueled by the widespread misconception of Africa as an impoverished or unpeopled expanse,'' said Adjaye, who was born to Ghanaian parents in Dar es Salaam, Tanzania. ''I was born in a metropolitan city; I was born in a cosmopolitan condition among different groups of Africans, Indians and Chinese.'' The seven slender volumes that make up ''African Metropolitan Architecture'' (Rizzoli, $100) were winnowed from about 35,000 photos, which are bluntly documentary in style. Adjaye calls them ''anti-iconic.'' ''I didn't want to fall into the trap of making beautiful urban pictures,'' said Adjaye, who is now at work on the Smithsonian's National Museum of African American History and Culture, scheduled to open in 2015. ''I wanted to say, 'You know what, if you stick your camera out the window, this is what you're going to get.' '' The buildings surprise in terms of their sophistication, their beauty and also their weirdness, as in the case of a spiny shelled dome in Khartoum, Sudan, that looks as if it's about to sprout legs."

At Ralph Lauren's show, right, a 15-foot-high arrangement of pastel flowers echoed the colors of the clothes. At Union Square there were lilies mixed on the same palette, while on Seventh Avenue deliverers carted the colors.

2011-10-02T00:00:00Z,"Ever since Paleolithic Picassos painted bison and aurochs on cave walls at Chauvet and Lascaux, artists have fetishized food. It is, in a sense, art's original obsession, ultimately inspiring Chardin's rabbits, Cotan's melons, Cézanne's apples -- a nearly endless menu of Western landmarks, all symbol-laden and sublime, food being a ready-made metaphor for life and death; for abundance, sexual and caloric; and for sheer, ecstatic virtuosity. Are there any more virtuosic pictures than Goya's fish or Manet's asparagus? The pleasure that Goya, Manet and their ilk clearly took in the ability to conjure a freshly killed hare or the insides of a bursting pomegranate or the oily flesh of dead sardines with a few delicious dollops of juicy pigment is as palpable and as sensual as a ripe peach. Wayne Thiebaud, a master technician and zenlike observer, exalts in the same seductive skill. His Boston cream pies, chocolate layer cakes, hot dogs and gum-ball machines are icons of midcentury Americana, dry-witted like Thiebaud but serious, too. They convey the melancholy joy of bygone loves. Rimmed in blue halos, their crisp shadows cast in the glow of an improbably sharp, California sort of light, they strike a disarming note. They're stolid, silent objects, more polished than edible, registering in our minds somewhere between the tart lemon meringues and the strawberry rhubarbs we dreamed about eating and those dried-out cakes and cloying pies we actually ate. After an initial surge of pleasure, this gap between desire and reality occasions the aforementioned sadness. But the pictures also produce other associations, the longer we stare at them. Those laconic pies are lined up like headstones in Death Valley or like gunslingers at the O.K. Corral, grave and expectant and almost mythic. And like the greatest movie westerns, they end up being more than just pleasurable or nostalgic -- or merely American."

2011-10-02T00:00:00Z,"There's not nearly as much reason to fear sugar substitutes as there is to fear actual sugar and high-fructose corn syrup. The assumption that these noncaloric or low-cal sweeteners are likely tobe cancer-causing agents, and that sugar and high- fructose corn syrup are not, is as much a sugar- industry invention as anything else.The two oldest and most undeservedly infamous sugar substitutes -- saccharin and cyclamate -- were first used widely in the United States in the early 1960s, when diet soft drinks came into vogue. The sugar industry responded by financing research into potential health risks of the two sweeteners -- spending half a million dollars on cyclamate alone, which was a lot of money at the time. ''If anyone can undersell you 9 cents out of 10,'' one sugar-industry executive explained to The Times in 1969, ''you'd better find some brickbat you can throw at him.'' The brickbat was the notion that cyclamate could cause bladder cancer in rats. Or at least it could when they were consuming the equivalent of several hundred soda cans each day. Regardless, the Food and Drug Administration promptly banned its use. In the early 1970s, when a few studies suggested that saccharin could do the same -- if consumed at the rate of 800 soda cans daily -- the F.D.A. moved to ban that as well before settling for a warning label that would stay on packets of Sweet'N Low for the next quarter century. (Congress passed a bill to remove it in 2000.) To further confuse matters, the Canadians banned saccharin but left cyclamate unregulated,so Sweet'N Low in the United States is made from saccharin and in Canada from cyclamate."

2011-10-02T00:00:00Z,"With its shimmering vision of a fairy-tale realm where grace and good manners prevail, Oliver Messel's production of ''The Sleeping Beauty'' for Sadler's Wells (later the Royal) Ballet, in 1946, raised the curtain on London's postwar recovery and held a mirror to England's sense of pride. When the ballet was performed at the Metropolitan Opera House in New York three years later, applause greeted the scenery - a magnificent palace extending into the wings and beyond, set in a stately park among ancient trees. ''The Sleeping Beauty'' was such a success that Messel never lived it down. For decades, it has been the basis of his reputation, and so irresistible and magical is its spell that, had he done nothing else, it would have been enough. But he did much more. ''Oliver Messel: In the Theatre of Design'' (Rizzoli, $75), edited by Thomas Messel, his nephew, rounds out his reputation with an accounting of his works for the stage (Mozart operas at Glyndebourne, ''House of Flowers'' on Broadway) and film (''The Thief of Baghdad,'' ''Suddenly, Last Summer''), his architecture (houses on Barbados and Mustique) and interiors (a suite and private dining rooms at the Dorchester Hotel)."

David Rothenberg argues in ''Survival of the Beautiful'' (Bloomsbury Press, $30) that art has its origins millions of years before the cave paintings at Lascaux. He opens with an anecdote about the male satin bowerbird, which builds unique stick artworks and decorates them in blue -- blue flowers, blue shells, sometimes blue pigment ground up from fruit pulp -- to attract females. ''Beauty Is in the Street'' (Four Corners Books, $40) is a visual history of the 1968 Paris uprisings, which yielded not just fundamental changes in French society but a surprisingly consistent protest iconography of stenciled placards and hand-painted affiches."

At her bedside were husband of 59 years, Sam, and her daughters Felice, Louise and Melissa. She was born in Brooklyn, NY to Irving and Anna Pearlstein. She spent her summers at Camp Boiberik where she excelled at sports and dance and made many lifelong friends. Justine received a BA from NYU. She was especially talented in modern dance and classical piano She performed with Benjamin Zemach and with the Martha Graham Dance Company but turned to the piano, studying with Angela Weschler in New York City and Edith Vogel in London. She taught piano in her Jericho studio in the '50s and '60s and some of her pupils made successful music careers. In September 1967, the family moved to London and in 1977 to Brussels, where she had her first bout with cancer (ovarian). Sam's three years became fourteen and the family returned to the U.S. in 1980. Justine opened her own shop - Justine Mehlman Antiques - in Georgetown, selling 18th to 20th century period jewelry and decorative art. The business flourished with the beauty, quality, condition, and genuineness of the items for sale. She was invited to speak at the Smithsonian, directed at the antique collector. Poor health lead to Justine's reluctant retirement in early 2009. She will be remembered, loved and missed. A later memorial will follow."

2011-10-02T00:00:00Z,"Each April, during the Milan Furniture Fair, the German lighting designer Ingo Maurer presents an exhibition of new work. These shows, which highlight Maurer's innovative, provocative and poetic pieces (and those of designers whose ideas he finds interesting), never fail to impress. But this year, Maurer - who designs everything from table lights to subway stations, and who was recently awarded the prestigious Compasso d'Oro for career achievement - outdid himself with a design that was, in a word, enchanting. A 12-foot-high hanging mass of emerald-green sponges seemed to glow from within (thanks to hidden L.E.D.'s), and teemed with life in the form of about 100 exquisite, hand-painted models of butterflies, dragonflies, lizards and other creatures. This wasn't, strictly speaking, a light fixture - not that it mattered to besotted observers. But what exactly was it? As Maurer explained, it's a hybrid lighting and acoustical device that was commissioned by a couple in Munich, where Maurer lives and works. Their apartment, in a 19th-century building, includes an octagonal room that was created as a private chapel and is now a dining room. (The French decorator Jacques Grange designed the interiors in collaboration with Maurer.) Maurer wanted something that would both illuminate and soften the sound in the small but tall domed space (16 feet wide, 25 feet high) - and the finished product, the Biotope, is shown here."

2011-10-02T00:00:00Z,"Addictive as a drug? We crave certain foods so much that they seem addictive. Just thinking about cinnamon buns or pizza stimulates the release of the neural chemical dopamine, which can cause the brain to override the biological brakes that try to prevent overeating. According to ''Why Humans Like Junk Food,'' by a former Nestlé scientist named Steven A. Witherly, the brain especially loves mixtures of salt, sugar and fat and the emulsive textures of butter, mayonnaise and chocolate. Witherly has developed what he calls the food-pleasure equation, in which Pleasure = Sensation + Calories. When we eat a combination of sugar, fat and salt, he says, we get a huge synergistic bang, first in the parts of the brain that register pleasure and then in the gut, which detects and responds more favorably to the high calories in sugar and fat. It's caveman stuff, going back to when we learned to eat big-calorie foods to survive."

2011-10-02T00:00:00Z,"WALLACE--George A. P.,A professional engineer who dedicated much of his professional career to promoting the adoption of energy-saving technologies in home and industrial heating and cooling, died on September 25, 2011 in Lakeville, CT at age 85. He was a long-time resident of New York City and Northwest Corner, CT. Mr. Wallace came from a long line of Scottish explorers, soldiers, industrialists, and engineers. Born in Chester, PA in 1926, Mr. Wallace chose to pursue his education as a chemical engineer, graduating from Cornell University with a Bachelor's degree in Chemical Engineering and a Masters of Engineering certificate in 1947. With his strong engineering background, Mr. Wallace became a licensed Professional Engineer with the State of New York, a life member of the American Society of Heating, Refrigerating, and Air-conditioning Engineers and member of the New York Academy of Sciences. After a brief career in the chemical industry, Mr. Wallace, Samuel Eannace, and a group of associates formed Wallace Eannace Associates, Inc., a new type of sales engineering firm in the New York-New Jersey region. Specializing in pumping and heat transfer equipment, the company combines technical service and education with product distribution. His goals were to promote awareness of the need and feasibility of improving the efficiency of HVAC systems, a goal that was significantly stimulated during the 1970's when the US was suffering under the Arab oil embargo and was being forced to recognize the urgency of reducing its dependence on Mideast oil. Under this pressure and supported by government, HVAC engineers began to develop and install energy-conserving systems to replace older fuel-wasting types. One of Mr. Wallace's major disappointments was witnessing support for these innovations fade as cheap foreign oil once again became available. However, in Europe, a partnership of governments and industry was pushing greater efficiency in all energy use. Mr. Wallace studied these systems and helped to stimulate some adoption in the US. Coincidentally, nuclear energy was being promoted as the solution to fossil fuel dependency. Mr. Wallace was a member and backer of the Union of Concerned Scientists virtually from its inception and strongly supported their efforts to monitor the hazards of the expansion of the nuclear industry and its adaptation to military usage. Mr. Wallace long felt that commercial interests too often trump sound science in setting directions for bringing technological developments into use by society. He remained actively engaged in these issues and in his business interests virtually to the end of his life. In addition to his commitment to the Union of Concerned Scientists, Mr. Wallace was a dedicated supporter of many national and local environmental organizations, including Salisbury Land Trust, Sharon Audubon, Appalachian Mountain Club, American Bird Conservancy, and Sierra Club. Mr. Wallace served in the United States Navy as an Aviation Radio Technician during World War II and received an honorable discharge in 1946. He is fondly remembered by his family and friends as a sensitive man with a keen sense of the importance of personal relationships in private and professional life. Mr. Wallace was an extremely thoughtful and intellectual man who placed a high premium on dialogue, the objective exchange of ideas, and on scientific education and understanding in society. He was an avid reader and life-long student of world history. Mr. Wallace is survived by his wife of 54 years, Joan, a son, George E. Wallace of Warrenton, VA, two daughters, E. Ainslie Wallace of Salisbury, CT and Elaine Connolly of Scarborough, ME, and eight grandchildren. In lieu of flowers, please consider making a donation to the Union of Concerned Scientists either via their website at www.ucsusa.org or by mail to Union of Concerned Scientists, Attn: John Mace, 2 Brattle Square, Cambridge, MA 02138."

2011-10-02T00:00:00Z,"Mealtimes matter, especially for weight control. In a recent study, researchers at Northwestern University allowed two groups of mice to eat as much high- fat food as they wanted. One group ate during its active hours, the other only during its normal sleeping period, but both groups consumed about the same number of calories. The study found that the mice who ate during their inactive time ballooned, adding 48 percent to their body weight. The animals that ate during active hours added only 20 percent, even on the high-fat diet. Eating breakfast is crucial: skipping the meal affects hormones related to appetite. Those who don't eat soon after rising typically consume more calories over the course of the day and run a higher risk of Type 2 diabetes and obesity. It's also important to stay on the three-meal- a-day schedule. Recent research conducted by Purdue University refutes well-publicized studies suggesting that eating numerous snacklike meals throughout the day might induce weight loss. In one Purdue study, overweight men ate either three meals of 750 calories or six meals of about 375 calories for 12 weeks. The latter group complained of feeling less satisfied after the smaller repasts. Purdue researchers concluded that eating ''beyond the typical three- meals-a-day pattern does not lead to better appetite control in overweightand obese individuals.''"

Ours doesn't, so there's no way to tell. This is despite the fact that 80 to 90 percent of Americans tell pollsters they want it labeled, and Barack Obama, as a candidate, once promised to make it happen. But the industry is afraid you won't buy genetically modified foods if they're labeled -- and they're probably right. Why would you? So far at least, genetically modified food offers the consumer no tangible benefit. In America, the only way to be certain you're not buying genetically engineered food is to buy organic; the U.S.D.A. rules for organic prohibit it."

The park pavilion should have been on the right, and the row of buildings should have been on the left. In the distance is the former Tammany Hall building, on East 17th Street near the northeast corner of Union Square Park. The photograph also appeared in mirror image in The Times on May 2, 1934. After a writer for The Times pointed out the recent error, editors retrieved the photograph, which was distributed by The A.P., from The Times's archives; it also was printed in mirror image. An editor at The A.P. checked its copy of the original photograph and found that it too was printed in mirror image. It is not known why the original prints were made in mirror image. But one possibility is that editors at The A.P. did so in order to make several signs, carried by members of the crowd in the foreground, legible to readers. (The letters evidently bled through the signs, which appear to have been made of cloth, and would have appeared backward if the image had been printed without alteration.) At the time, retouching and altering images for clarity's sake were not uncommon practices; The A.P. and The Times no longer permit such changes to photographic images."

Age 70, of Windermere, Florida, died on Thursday, September 29, 2011 at the Memorial Sloan Kettering Hospital in New York City after a brief and courageous battle with cancer. Dick had lived in Wayne, New Jersey most of his life before moving to Windermere five years ago. A graduate of Brooklyn College of Pharmacy, Dick began his career filling prescriptions at the Preakness Pharmacy in Wayne. He often said that the reason he became a pharmacist was because He could get a job filling prescriptions anywhere in the country and support his family. He grew to love the industry and made monumental contributions during his career. He helped design the very first prescription benefit plans in the 1970's, and was proud of having the longest continuous experience in that industry, in the nation. He went on to become a successful entrepreneur first founding National Prescription Administrators, Inc. which he built into the largest privately held prescription benefit manager in the nation with over 1,500 employees. He later founded Benecard Services, Inc., a prescription benefit facilitator, headquartered in Orlando, FL with offices in Clifton and Lawrenceville, NJ and Mechanicsburg, PA. He was very proud of his business accomplishments and particularly happy to have done this with his two sons, Kenneth and Richard, working by his side. Dick also believed strongly in 'giving back'. For many years he was co-chairman for the Smithsonian National Museum of the American Indian in New York City. He was also a member of the Board of Trustees of Long Island University, on the Advisory Board of the Valley National Bank, Wayne, NJ, as well as several other philanthropic endeavors. Dick, who was a devoted family man, had many passions including a love of cars. As a young man, he never drove the same car for very long and was always looking for another project car that he could repair or fix-up into something better. He simply loved his cars; fixing cars, driving cars, and he turned this passion into a lifelong hobby, building a wonderful collection over the years. He also loved golfing, which he played as a member of Isleworth CC in FL and Upper Montclair CC in NJ. Dick was a man of strong faith and a member of the Preakness Reformed Church in Wayne, NJ and the Presbyterian Church of the Lakes in Windermere, FL. Dick is survived by his loving wife Barbara Marcin Ullman of Windermere, FL, his three children; Kenneth and his wife Nadine of Naples, FL, Richard A. and his wife Lisa of Franklin Lakes, NJ, and Jennifer Royall and her husband Walker of Dallas, TX, seven grandchildren; Devin, Zachary, Jacob, Jordan, Davis, Walker, and Drake, one brother; Arthur Ullman Jr and his wife Judy of Irving, TX, and two sisters; Erika Leal and her husband Ron of Palm Coast, FL, and Gretchen Ullman of Pompton Lakes, NJ, as well as many nieces and nephews.

''I try to morph the three,'' says Cain, whose site-specific work dips into a playfully vivid palette that defies her contemplative nature. Cain used abandoned buildings to develop her style, and some of her earliest efforts, along the dirt roads of her native upstate New York, went entirely unseen. A 2004 installation in a squat in San Francisco's North Beach, however, brought her the attention of the art world. She is now represented by Honor Fraser in L.A. and Anthony Meier Fine Arts in San Francisco and was recently commissioned by LAND (Los Angeles Nomadic Division) to do an installation in a former Masonic lodge in Marfa, Tex. On view through Dec. 4 as part of a suite of public projects, ''Forget Me Not'' takes its name from the flower pin once worn by the Masons and later adopted by the Nazis. ''Supreme Being'' (above), a three-dimensional canvas bordered in gold leaf, is the only component Cain created off-site for the piece; its diagonal stripes were traced from the floorboards in her studio.

2011-10-02T00:00:00Z,"Grinding beans with a burr grinder just before you prepare your coffee is the single most important step to making a better cup. Because coffee degrades rapidly when exposed to oxygen, mediocre beans just out of the grinder have much more flavor than even fantastic beans thatwere ground up yesterday. (As for the beans you ground last week, it's time to add them to the compost heap.) A decent burr grinder doesn't come cheap, though. The entry point is about $100, and if you want a better engineor more settings, you can easily spend $300. But like investing in a chef 's knife, it's a one-time expense you won't regret. Its beautyis that it crushes the beans into particles of a consistent size, unlike a blade grinder, which whirs some of the coffee into powder and some into chunks. And consistency is incredibly important to coffee's taste: a blade grinder is very likely to produce grinds that lead to uneven extraction, which results in bitter flavors.The beans you grind are also important, of course. You should be drinking the ones that are in season and therefore the freshest -- right now, that means the beans from South America. It's important to remember that shopping for coffee beans is like buying fish: ask for what has just come in. It makes a big difference."

He was graduated from The Choate School and from Harvard College, Magna cum Laude, Phi Beta Kappa. While at Harvard, he was published in ""The New Republic"" and had covered the coal mines of Pennsylvania and West Virginia, textile mill towns in the South and the drought in the dust bowls of the Midwest. He then became a junior foreign correspondent in London and the Balkans for Raymond Moley's Today magazine. After a stint at the London School of Economics, he became an editor of Life Magazine, when it was just a year old. His eleven years at Life were interrupted by four years in the Army. He volunteered for the infantry the day after the United States entered the war and served in Iceland, England, France, the Battle of the Bulge and Germany rising to the rank of captain. On his voyage home he wrote ""America's Germany"", which had been commissioned by Random House. Returning to Life Magazine for a few years, he left to become executive editor of True, then the world's largest men's magazine, and subsequently editor-in-chief of its sister magazine, Today's Woman. In the early sixties he formed The Julian Bach Literacy Agency with the help of Christopher Shaw, eventually representing some 500 primarily American and English authors. He loved music and was a devotee of concerts and the Metropolitan Opera. An enthusiastic traveler, he particularly liked hiking in the Swiss Alps. He attended virtually every Harvard varsity and freshman football game, both home and away until his mid eighties. His brief marriage to Kathryn Rains ended in divorce. In 1947, he married Halle Cowen (Schlesinger) who died in 1972. He is survived by his wife of 34 years, Hope Liberman (Harris), his daughter, Prudence Mortimer (Jay), his sister Doris Gordon, his stepson, Arthur (Tony) Cowen III (Edna), his stepdaughters, Alice Eberhardt (Ron), Audrey Matson (Marcus). He was predeceased by another stepdaughter, Halle (Jill) Cowen. He is also survived by seven grandchildren: Harriman Bach Mortimer, Jeffrey Cowen, Jane Cowen Hamilton, Eliza Cowen, Katherine Nintzel, Abigail Nintzel, Claire Matson and two great-grandchildren.

2011-10-02T00:00:00Z,"Pascale Mussard lifts the top of the large packing crate, and I look inside. She has already shown me around her workroom at Hermes, a treat for anyone interested in how things are made, and now she is permitting me a peek at a project to which she is profoundly attached. I find it hard not to crack a smile at her kindergarten-teacher gravity, enhanced by the canvas apron that covers her long white Indian linen dress. Strands of blond hair escape from her bun. For three years, Mussard, a sixth-generation member of the Hermes family, has been leading the Petit h line, a unique salvage mission: to retrieve discarded materials from Hermes's workshops and turn them into new objects. The line isn't exactly a bid by the Mother of the Birkin to be perceived as sustainable, though a few blogs seemed to think so and mocked the effort as ''upcycling.'' That may be a fair assessment of a jigsaw puzzle made from leftover crocodile skin, an object nobody really needs. On the other hand, this view may be too literal minded. The objects of Petit h - which boasts a roster of designers like Gilles Jonemann, Christian Astuguevieille, Alice Cozon and Adrien Rovero in addition to the company's artisans - are not toys, but they do express childlike qualities: innocence, playfulness, creaturely allusions. ''Hermes is all about stories,'' as Mussard says. More important, these objects also extend a warrant upon which Hermes was built: the possibility to own something that can be repaired. Years ago, when Mussard was starting in the family ateliers, a great-uncle, Robert Dumas, explained that this was the fundamental difference between Hermes and other companies selling expensive goods. That ethical standard - repairing instead of replacing - infuses the Petit h line. But be prepared to be surprised and taunted."

2011-10-02T00:00:00Z,"Whenever a sketchy diner, a run-down truck stop or a dreary airport lounge is unavoidable, it helps to think like an economist. Since labor is a major cost for most service establishments, it's unlikely that they're spending a lot of money on skilled workers. So choose dishes that have a chance of succeeding under minimal attentiveness and with lesser ingredients. Moisture is a key element to consider. Eggs, traditionally deemed a safe choice in diners, are easy to overcook and thus are often served dry and tasteless. Chili and other slow-simmering dishes are a better option, because they can be left on the stove forever and still taste O.K. The initial recipe may not be optimal, but the restaurant's mistakes probably won't make them worse, and the spices in a good blend can overcome mediocre ingredients. Ribs, which are usually cooked mechanically with little threat of human error, can also sit for a long time at low heat and will almost certainly taste better than they look."

In ''Parasomnia'' (at right), a man who may or may not be asleep has tipped over in his chair, but Ms. Sassen has rotated the image so he almost appears to be in freefall.

2011-10-02T00:00:00Z,"Bartenders always keep an eye on the comings and goings of our customers. More often than not, we do know you're there, and we're aware of how you're occupying space in the room: are you blocking the path to the bar or the restrooms? Are you elbowing into other people's rib cages or screaming like a lout? These observations are good for business, sure, but they also make us feel in control of our surroundings. If you want a drink quickly -- and everyone does -- it's best to work within this system. Try to make eye contact as soon as you step into the room or as soon as you find a space at the bar. If that's not possible, a little raise of the hand or nod of the head is O.K., but please, please don't wildly flail your arms. A common misconception among customers is that brandishing cash or a credit card is a sign that you're ready to deal. To bartenders, this behavior is not only impolite, it's pointedly dehumanizing. The best way to get, and keep, your bartender's attention is to be respectful, which actually matters more than big spending and tipping. Overlooked more often than you might imagine is saying ''please'' and ''thank you.'' And if you have a chance to ask your bartender his or her name and introduce yourself, we'll be glad you asked and won't forget your cordiality."

2011-10-02T00:00:00Z,"The most famous dish in recent literary memory -- a saffron-sprinkled fish stew -- appeared in Ian McEwan's 2005 novel ''Saturday.'' Its slow composition by Henry Perowne, a neurosurgeon and father, lent the whole book a fragrant heat. McEwan fielded so many requests for the recipe that he put it on his Web site. ''Where quantities are not stated,'' he wrote, ''trust your instincts or desires.''While ''Saturday'' wasn't really a food novel, McEwan's artfulness and ease around the stove was a reminder that brilliant and sustained food writing in fiction remains rare. It was also an aching reminder that excellent food novels, in any language, have never been plentiful. Good recent ones include John Lanchester's ruminative ''Debt to Pleasure,''in which a murderous gourmand ruminates upon his appetites; and Nora Ephron's ''Heartburn,'' an eating- obsessed roman à clef about the author's divorce from Carl Bernstein, has not lost its peppery wit. ''The Flounder,'' by Günter Grass, is a weird and briny chowder of a novel. And there are spritzier things to pack in the beach bag: ''Like Water for Chocolate,'' ''Fried Green Tomatoes at the Whistle Stop Café,'' ''Chocolat.''"

2011-10-02T00:00:00Z,"IN a studio on the far West Side of Manhattan a gaggle of young women, numbering close to 40, almost all under 25, sat splayed in slumber party mode on a rehearsal room floor. Dressed mostly in leggings and the appropriate American Apparel accoutrements, hair coolly mussed, they kept their eyes focused on one woman in the room while they quietly sang. Their voices were soft until joined by the guttural force of Karen O and her undeniably female yelp. It's a sound that has filled arenas but will next be heard on a theatrical stage. The lead singer for the New York indie rock band the Yeah Yeah Yeahs, Karen O was at one of the first rehearsals for her latest work, ''Stop the Virgens,'' an opera of sorts, when she joined in on one of its decidedly rock-inflected songs. The work, a kind of psychedelic myth loosely about the evolution of a group of virgins, which opens at St. Ann's Warehouse on Oct. 12 and runs for eight performances through Oct. 22, has been almost seven years in the making. The director is the playwright Adam Rapp. For both of these artists, ''Stop the Virgens'' is a chance to create what they call a new kind of genre-blending performance."

2011-10-02T00:00:00Z,"Jets (2-1) at Ravens (2-1) Sunday, 8:20 p.m. Line: Ravens by 3.5. Any team coached by a member of the Ryan family does not so much play a 16-game schedule as careen from bitter rivalry to bitter rivalry, each game becoming the kind of over-boiled grudge match usually settled with suplexes and folding chairs at ringside. It happened to Buddy Ryan's Eagles, and it has happened to Rex Ryan's Jets. Jets-Cowboys becomes Rex Ryan against Rob Ryan. Jets-Patriots becomes Rex Ryan against Bill Belichick. Jets-Ravens devolves into Rex Ryan against the team that declined to promote him to head coach when he was its defensive coordinator. Next time the Jets face the Raiders, it will be Rex Ryan against the team that broke his quarterback's nose. Even Rex Ryan could not muster a feud with the Jaguars, but Joe Namath got into the act this week, so if you play the current Jets against the 1968 version in a video game, that is now a grudge match, too. Granted, the presence of the ex-Ravens Bart Scott, Jim Leonhard and Derrick Mason on the Jets roster does give the game a familiarity-breeds-contempt angle. ''This is a family game, but it's also a heated rivalry,'' said Ravens defensive end Terrell Suggs, perhaps not realizing that Jets charity softball tournaments are also heated rivalries. ''You've got to go beat up on the ones you love.'' In other words, this time it's personal. Just like all the other times. Pick: Jets. Steelers (2-1) at Texans (2-1) Sunday, 1 p.m. Line: Texans by 4. The season often starts this way for the Steelers. They grind out a couple of seemingly difficult wins against bad teams. They lose to the Ravens, or someone Ravens-like. We question their offensive line and remark that the team is not deploying the classic Steelers running game, because in Pittsburgh it is always 1978 and the only way to win is to hand off 40 times. The Steelers have had a suspect offensive line for the entire Ben Roethlisberger era, made worse by Roethlisberger's belief that getting rid of the ball on time causes back pimples. Bruce Arians has been the offensive coordinator for five years, and he has always been more pass-oriented than the guys with Franco Harris collector's edition beer steins would like. The Steelers have reached two Super Bowls in four years through a succession of ugly wins. It is time to stop being surprised. Pick: Steelers."

The new takeout box features those hues and a new, more refined logo, which includes the fleur- de-lis, which is ubiquitous in New Orleans. The company has said the changes were made to emphasize the brand's Louisiana heritage and to appeal to younger diners, but the makeover also had the effect of making the food somehow seem more healthful.

Matali Crasset's personal library, Maarten Baas's prototypes and even the crudely fashioned cardboard strip that keeps Confetti System's air-conditioner from jostling its hand-cut garlands reveal what it's really like inside a designer's world.

2011-10-02T00:00:00Z,"Jean and Steven Goldman have always done things their way - which has usually meant swimming against the current. In the mid-1960s, when the newly married couple lived in Cambridge, Mass., where Steven attended Harvard Law School and Jean worked as a curator at the Institute of Contemporary Art in Boston, they could have bought Warhols and Lichtensteins (which were going for a song then). Instead, they set their sights on what Jean has called ''postage-stamp Renaissance scribbles,'' gradually amassing a large and important collection of Italian drawings from the 15th to the 17th centuries. And in the mid-1990s, when the Goldmans - Jean by then an art historian, and Steven in transition from academia to real estate - decided to move back to their native Chicago and sell their David Adler-designed 1921 French country manor in suburban Glencoe, Ill., they could have installed themselves in the kind of sleek, plush aerie favored by many of their art-collector peers. But no. The couple bought a spacious apartment in an austerely elegant Art Deco building on Chicago's Gold Coast and proceeded to turn it into an 18th-century fantasy, a city cousin of their beloved Adler house, complete with two libraries (and no guest rooms), parquet de Versailles floors, carved French and Italian furniture and, of course, their collection of drawings - now at 180 and still counting - by Raphael, Andrea del Sarto, Guido Reni, Agnolo Bronzino and various Carraccis, among other masters."

2011-10-02T00:00:00Z,"Getting a read on the city of Los Angeles has never been easy. Twenty years ago, when my husband was offered a job in L.A., we left New York. I figured that as a writer, my work was portable, and as an urbanite, I would easily adjust. But Los Angeles, with its shifting perspectives and unwieldy size, was perplexing. When we first arrived, I spoke with an architectural historian on the verge of relocating. He offered me one salient tip before making his exit: ''The two most interesting things about Los Angeles,'' he said, ''are the domestic architecture and the ephemeral population.'' He was right: the stream of characters is constant, and the number of exceptional houses is astonishing. And as the critic Reyner Banham had so famously done before me, I got my driver's license, began reading Esther McCoy and learned to love Los Angeles. ''No one can write about architecture in California without acknowledging her as the mother of us all,'' Banham declared. McCoy documented the state's neglected architectural heritage and was a witness to midcentury Modernism, which she pithily described as ''a marriage between Walden Pond and Douglas Aircraft.'' ''Five California Architects,'' her 1960 classic, delivered an unprecedented look at Modernist architecture and its distinctly West Coast origins, through the early-20th-century work of Irving Gill, Bernard Maybeck, R. M. Schindler and the brothers Charles and Henry Greene. She spelled out the basic elements of modern residential design: open floor plans, ample natural light, simplified forms, an easy flow between indoors and out and an embrace of new building materials and engineering techniques. Her writing was lucid and sharply observed, its plain language shot through with wit and unexpected poetry. A daring hilltop house designed by Schindler was ''a veritable jack-in-the-beanstalk structure: it grew like a light vine from the bottom of a canyon up to the road, clinging to the narrow ledge of level land at the top by structural tendrils.''"

It's more sculpture than cabin, constructed from panes of glass, wood, plastic, bamboo blinds and green plexiglass, with tall, lush plants growing out of the floor. On a recent visit to the village, I knocked on its door to find Omar Santiago, a scruffy Uruguayan in his late 20s, arranging to rent the house to a Chilean couple. ''I'm not a hippie,'' he said, pointing to his ringing phone. ''Look here, a business call.'' When his place is rented, Santiago later explained, he sleeps in a tent he keeps pitched on the beach. I asked him if he owned his plot, and a playful smile crept across his face. ''Yes and no,'' he said."

2011-10-02T00:00:00Z,"In March 2008, a state-owned construction company in Ethiopia set a goal of persuading 70 percent of its employees to be tested for H.I.V. in 100 days. It was an astonishing thing to do in such a hurry; most of the workers were contract day laborers scattered across various construction sites who were understandably hesitant to be tested at work. But using a strategy called Rapid Results, in which a group of people chooses a project and carries it out in 100 days, the company exceeded its goal. The same method has been used in Rwanda, where two villages doubled the number of attended births in less than 100 days and in Madagascar, where four districts quintupled the use of family planning services in 50 days. Kenya is using Rapid Results in virtually all its ministries; one campaign in the province of Nyanza circumcised 40,000 men in two months -- a crucial achievement for AIDS prevention. Villages in Ghana, Sierra Leone, Sudan and Eritrea have used Rapid Results to improve local infrastructure -- digging wells and constructing bridges, roads and schools."

2011-10-02T00:00:00Z,"IN the increasingly bland, featureless landscape of TV crime drama it is somehow heartening to come upon a homicide detective who can be called, as the hero of ''Luther'' is, His Satanic Majesty -- by a co-worker, no less. That tantalizing sobriquet pops up early in the first episode of the series's second season, now on BBC America, and it should be music to the ears of genre fans who prefer their crime fighters tormented. Since the demise a few months ago of ''Law & Order: Criminal Intent'' and its troubled investigative genius, Bobby Goren (Vincent D'Onofrio), television's top sleuths seem, on the whole, a depressingly ordinary lot, with the notable exception of Raylan Givens, in ''Justified,'' whose distinction is that he is hilariously unconflicted about his own capacity for violence. Detective Chief Inspector John Luther (Idris Elba), of the London Metropolitan Police, made his debut last year in a six-part mini-series written by Neil Cross, and the audience's first sight of him was a bit alarming. In the opening sequence he is interrogating a serial killer who is hanging by his hands over a steep drop and ultimately loses his grip. Luther's reaction is a furtive little smile, followed immediately by shame. Interesting guy. Within five minutes you know that this is a cop you want to watch."

2011-10-02T00:00:00Z,"After living in Liguria for four years, I've eaten pesto, the culinary specialty that most defines the region, heaped on pizza, smeared on focaccia, drizzled on seafood and slathered on pasta. I've bought jars of it at local shops and markets, and, on occasion, even attempted a homemade version by grinding fresh basil, pine nuts, grated cheeses, salt and olive oil together by hand in my heavy marble mortar. But the freshest, creamiest pesto I've tasted came from an unlikely source: a pesto vending machine -- dubbed Pesto Mat -- in Porto Venere, a seaside hamlet on the Ligurian coast. Although the Pesto Mat was recently put out of commission, the shop that kept the machine stocked with jars of that divine pesto still thrives. Bajeicò (from ''basil'' in the Ligurian dialect; bajeico.it), is down a narrow pedestrian alley, behind the row of pastel houses that line Porto Venere's postcard waterfront. Inside the tiny stone-walled store, glass jars are arranged behind the counter like emeralds on display, each one filled with creamy pesto made daily from a traditional (and secret) family recipe -- ready to be slipped into your shopping bag or well-padded suitcase. (A seven-ounce jar is 7 euros.)"

The ideal perch, Sartre suggested, is not at the pedestrian's height, distance or speed, but in the sky. For much of the city's history, that purview was reserved mostly for birds and the romantic imagination of conceptual artists. By the end of the 18th century, hot-air balloons had opened the vantage point to a select few.

2011-10-02T00:00:00Z,"Gambling on contemporary art is a risky business. Yet for the collectors he advises, Allan Schwartzman's knack for choosing works that only gain value makes him seem psychic. On the home front, Schwartzman, 54, has been similarly clairvoyant, amassing exactly the right pieces he would need for his New York apartment years before it ever existed. ''I've always loved furniture,'' he says, ''and before I started buying art I thought I'd collect it. I knew someday I would move, and just hoped it fit whatever place I moved to.'' When Schwartzman moved into 100 11th Avenue Residences, the luxury Chelsea high-rise designed by Jean Nouvel, he left the contents of his former apartment behind. He started over with what he had in storage - a choice collection of modernist Brazilian furniture that he bought while working for a client there - and he made it fit. He converted what was designed as a three-bedroom residence into what he calls ''a deconstructed one-bedroom.'' The apartment looks more like a light-filled art gallery that allows for places to sleep, work and entertain."

But I was disabused of this notion by the Antiques Diva, a native Oklahoman who has an enviable life traipsing around European antiques fairs. When I sang the praises of Vanves, she shook her head. ''It's the Ham & Antiques you want!'' she said. ''It's on the Ile de Chatou, 800 dealers, and the best ham you ever tasted.'' Because there is a God, the H&A - the official name of which is the Foire Nationale a la Brocante et aux Jambons, but is known more familiarly as the Chatou (it is entirely possible that only I and the Diva call it the Ham & Antiques) - takes place over 10 days, twice a year, around the same time as the women's fashion shows in Paris.

2011-10-02T00:00:00Z,"In terms of aesthetics and performance, the toaster has been devolving for a generation. According to Eric A. Murrell ofthe Toaster Collectors Association, the Toastmaster 1B14, a handsome hunk of chrome and steel discontinued in 1960, remains ''absolutely the end-all-and-be-all toaster there ever was.'' Among its charms was a patented timing system that didn't tick off seconds butused its internal heating mechanism to gauge the bread and produce a consistent shade of brown. Collectors also dote on the Sunbeam T-20 Radiant Control model, which was introduced in 1949 with the slogan ''Automatic beyondbelief '' -- a reference to its ability to automatically lower and cook the bread. ''It's still one of the most elegant inventions inthe household,'' laments the technology-and- design historian Edward Tenner, of the machine that was discontinued in the mid-'90s.Asked to choose between the T-20 and 1B14, Michael Sheafe, a New York dealer of vintage appliances, said, ''It's like asking which child you love more.''What doomed these classic designs was cost. The original Sunbeam T-20 cost more than $22.50 when it was introduced in 1949, about a third of a week's wages for the average family. The dark age of the toaster began when consumers started choosing price over functionality, particularly during the 1980s. The market is now glutted with machines that toast unevenly and retail for less than $10. ''Mind you,'' Sheafe added, ''that's what they're worth.''"

I grew up during a time when the awareness of the quality of food was practically nil. It's true that in the '50s and even the '60s people still cooked, even if much of the food was ''convenient,'' like Jell-O mold or tuna tetrazzini. It's also true that pigs were still raised on farms, most vegetables were seasonal and hyperprocessed junk hadn't yet achieved hegemony.

2011-10-02T00:00:00Z,"A review on Sept. 11 about ''Holy War: How Vasco da Gama's Epic Voyages Turned the Tide in a Centuries-Old Clash of Civilizations,'' by Nigel Cliff, erroneously attributed a distinction to da Gama's first voyage into the Indian Ocean. While he rounded the Cape of Good Hope in 1497, he was not the first European to do so. Another Portuguese explorer, Bartholomeu Dias, was the first, in 1488. The review also included an erroneous description of part of the course of da Gama's voyage and referred imprecisely to one of its historical distinctions. Before nearing the Cape, his ships made a great loop into the South Atlantic to exploit advantageous winds and currents; they did not ''inch their way'' down the West African coast. And while da Gama did eventually voyage thousands of miles farther than previous explorers, he did so by virtue of his journey to India, not on his trip to the Cape."

2011-10-02T00:00:00Z,"It's like entering a cameo,'' my friend Vanessa said when we first visited Jean and Steven Goldman's Chicago home (Page 84). Their apartment, which Pilar Viladas wisely and beautifully documents in this issue, is one of the most beguiling spaces I have ever encountered -- exquisite, cultured, ridiculously pretty -- and a tribute to the dreamy preoccupations of two very grounded Midwesterners. The Goldmans made me think about what it takes to realize one's deepest imaginative yearnings -- in their case Renaissance drawings, French moldings and buckled bookshelves -- in everyday life. I think people often assume that creative, fanciful types live creative, fanciful lives and that serious, levelheaded types get on with the business of lifestyle in a serious, levelheaded way -- that there are artists and there are business-minded folks, that sort of thinking. For me, nothing could be further from the truth. Those whose feet are most firmly planted on the ground have the freedom to let their imaginations float with the clouds. Consider Ingo Maurer, the 79-year-old lighting visionary, whose Biotope of sponge and twinkling dioramas for a Munich dining room-chapel has got to be the coolest chandelier ever (Page 92). Maurer has for decades illuminated the design industry with his clever and romantic spins on the mundane and the utile. He's an interiors powerhouse, a trippy genius and a Burning Man alum."

2011-10-03T00:00:00Z,"''The Love Letter You've Been Meaning to Write New York'' is not a production that satisfies on certain conventional levels: the concept and plot are strained, many of the performers are awkward amateurs, much of the script is hackneyed. And yet there's something terribly winning about Jonathan Solari's 80-minute production, which is at the 3LD Art & Technology Center in Lower Manhattan. Well, more accurately, it is outside the theater. The audience sits inside, kept good company by the composer Brian Cherchiglia and his fellow musicians, watching (and listening to piped-in audio), through a facade of floor-to-ceiling windows, as the action unfolds on Greenwich Street."
2011-10-03T00:00:00Z,"KEY PERFORMANCE Committing turnovers week after week is bound to have repercussions. Mark Sanchez committed four more Sunday night, running his total to nine. The Ravens scored 24 points off turnovers. Sanchez has big hands, and the Jets have worked with him on ball security. But he struggled to handle two snaps, which did not appear to be the fault of the backup center, Colin Baxter, who again started in place of Nick Mangold. NOTABLE NUMBER It took one play for the Ravens to establish their superiority over the Jets' offensive line. When Ed Reed broke free and forced Sanchez to fumble, it set the tone for a night of dominance. Try as they might, the Jets could not find the suitable combinations to protect Sanchez and keep Baltimore's imposing front seven from breaching the line."

The project, begun in 2002, was budgeted at 12 billion (about $19 billion) and the government hailed it as ''the world's biggest civil information technology program.''"

Today Mr. Nystrom teaches A.P. statistics to eight times as many students as he used to, and this year 70 percent of them scored high enough to qualify for college credit, compared with 50 percent before.

He was graduated from The Choate School and from Harvard College, Magna cum Laude, Phi Beta Kappa. While at Harvard, he was published in ""The New Republic"" and had covered the coal mines of Pennsylvania and West Virginia, textile mill towns in the South and the drought in the dust bowls of the Midwest. He then became a junior foreign correspondent in London and the Balkans for Raymond Moley's Today magazine. After a stint at the London School of Economics, he became an editor of Life Magazine, when it was just a year old. His eleven years at Life were interrupted by four years in the Army. He volunteered for the infantry the day after the United States entered the war and served in Iceland, England, France, the Battle of the Bulge and Germany rising to the rank of captain. On his voyage home he wrote ""America's Germany"", which had been commissioned by Random House. Returning to Life Magazine for a few years, he left to become executive editor of True, then the world's largest men's magazine, and subsequently editor-in-chief of its sister magazine, Today's Woman. In the early sixties he formed The Julian Bach Literacy Agency with the help of Christopher Shaw, eventually representing some 500 primarily American and English authors. He loved music and was a devotee of concerts and the Metropolitan Opera. An enthusiastic traveler, he particularly liked hiking in the Swiss Alps. He attended virtually every Harvard varsity and freshman football game, both home and away until his mid eighties. His brief marriage to Kathryn Rains ended in divorce. In 1947, he married Halle Cowen (Schlesinger) who died in 1972. He is survived by his wife of 34 years, Hope Liberman (Harris), his daughter, Prudence Mortimer (Jay), his sister Doris Gordon, his stepson, Arthur (Tony) Cowen III (Edna), his stepdaughters, Alice Eberhardt (Ron), Audrey Matson (Marcus). He was predeceased by another stepdaughter, Halle (Jill) Cowen. He is also survived by seven grandchildren: Harriman Bach Mortimer, Jeffrey Cowen, Jane Cowen Hamilton, Eliza Cowen, Katherine Nintzel, Abigail Nintzel, Claire Matson and two great-grandchildren.

2011-10-04T00:00:00Z,"The Tony Award that can reliably boost ticket sales for Broadway shows is the award for best musical: An overwhelming number of theatergoers - about 90 percent - buy tickets to see musicals rather than plays, and a Tony helps folks differentiate among the productions in the running for their ticket money. The Tony for best play, by contrast, is a coveted artistic honor, though it rarely makes a big difference at the box office. Take ''Red,'' the John Logan drama about the painter Mark Rothko that won the award for best play and five other Tonys last year. The production closed on Broadway two weeks after the Tony Awards ceremony, when its stars departed and after its producers had recouped their $2.25 million investment."

In addition, a special showing of his art and music will be held later in the year. Jack is survived by his two brothers Scott (Susan) and Paul (Sharon), his father Roscoe, his beloved companion Bernice Holtzman, nieces Elizabeth (Matthew Mettler), Alison and nephews Brett (Maryam) and Benjamin and great niece Abigail. Preceding Jack in death were his mother Jeanne, Sister Sally and niece Maria. After graduating from Deerfield High in Deerfield, IL, Jack attended Milton College majoring in history and Columbia College in Chicago where he received a degree in drama. Jack enjoyed acting in prominent roles in numerous plays but chose his earlier interest, music as a professional career. He spent many years as the keyboardist of the Nitecaps and other bands performing in greater New York City. Highlights of Jack's career included the Nitecaps tour of Europe as the warm-up band for the well-known U2 group. His band also toured with the Ramones. As did many other musicians, Jack subsidized his career financially by working at other jobs. In recent years his artwork was an important outlet for his talent. Using simple pen and ink, his drawings infuse humor and tenderness into surrealistic images. He was at his best and happiest when performing and we will miss him and his performances greatly. Contributions in lieu of flowers should be sent to Covenant House of New York City, the American Liver Foundation, charities focused on children, Catholic Charities, or others as friends deem appropriate to honor Jack's life."

The Broadway musical ''Billy Elliot,'' the winner of 10 Tony Awards in 2009 and a hot ticket for much of its run, will close on Jan. 8, 2012, after 3 years and 3 months of performances, the producers announced on Monday. The decision to close ''Billy Elliot'' came after a somewhat precipitous decline in ticket sales that accelerated through the late spring and summer amid competition from new musicals like ''The Book of Mormon'' and ''Priscilla Queen of the Desert,'' hit revivals like ''Anything Goes'' and ''How to Succeed in Business Without Really Trying,'' and ''Memphis,'' the durable recipient of the 2010 Tony for best musical. ''Billy Elliot,'' based on the 2000 film about a British lad from a mining town who dreams of becoming a dancer, was one of the most successful musicals in New York in recent years, earning back its capitalization of $18 million - a high figure for Broadway - in just 14 months. The show opened to strong reviews on Nov. 13, 2008, featuring music by Elton John, a book and lyrics by Lee Hall, and a trio of young actors rotating in the title. Those original three Billys (as they were called in admiring press coverage) - David Alvarez, Trent Kowalik, and Kiril Kulish - went on to share the Tony Award for best actor in a musical; the production also won for best musical and best director for Stephen Daldry, among other awards."

""A Dangerous Method,"" starring Viggo Mortensen, Michael Fassbender and Keira Knightley, takes place on the eve of World War I and looks at the relationship between the psychiatrist Carl Jung and his mentor Sigmund Freud. That relationship shifts when Jung takes on and develops a close bond to a new patient, Sabina Spielrein, played by Ms. Knightley. The film's screenplay was adapted by Christopher Hampton from his stage play, ""The Talking Cure."" The Times's Stephen Holden writes about ""A Dangerous Method"" in his notebook about films in the festival.
