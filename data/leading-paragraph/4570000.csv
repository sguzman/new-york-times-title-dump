The point about Mr. Allers is that he was a classically-trained musician before associating himself with Broadway; and in recent years he has gone back to his first loves, symphony and opera. At the Metropolitan Opera he has conducted ''Die Fledermaus,'' ''Hansel and Gretel'' and ''Der Rosenkavalier.'' In Europe and America he has been active as an all-around conductor who also knows more than anybody about what goes on in the Broadway pit. Thus he is in a unique position to talk about the Broadway musical stage and where it stands in the entire complex of music."

The key move of this defense, 5 ... B-N5, invites White to seize terrain in the center with 6 P-K5 so that Black may bring about doubled pawns after 6 ... N-Q4; 7 B-Q2, NxN; 8 PxN.

Also badly bruised was the budgetmaking process itself. Following the example of the five Representatives who refused to go along with their fellow budget conferees two weeks ago - and egged on by President Carter and a pleased House Speaker Thomas P. O'Neill Jr., who has been uncomfortable with Mr. Carter's curtailment of traditional Democratic programs - enough House Democrats defected, to reject, 242 to 141, a precariously balanced $613.3 billion budget. Their stated reason: It increased social spending by less than the rate of inflation while giving the military 5.2 percent more than inflation would warrant."

Cooper, a Methodist, was the first such circuit rider to visit Bethel, Sodom, Pine Mill, Milburn Corner, Hicks Neck, Lotts Landing, Hempstead South and the Baldwins and Baldwinsville.

To the gardener who spends most of his time fending off attacks by aphids, mites and leaf blights, this may seem to be a strange statement. Yet, considering that the roots typically make up half the volume of a plant and that they are usually obscured from view by the soil, the statement takes on credibility. To some degree, most of us are aware of those soil-borne problems caused by insects, diseases, nutrient deficiencies and lack of water. Garden centers are piled high with bags of soil insecticides and fungicides, fertilizers and irrigation equipment. Much less understood is the problem of water and air relationships within the soil."

1980-06-01T00:00:00Z,"It is almost seven years since the United States Customs Service moved out of the Old Custom House at Bowling Green to new offices in the World Trade Center. Since then, a reuse for the old building has been sought. For those who are familiar with this distinguished New York landmark and have followed its fortunes, we offer a progress report. For those who do not know it, we recommend a trip to the Battery on one of these fine days to see this turn-of-the-century Beaux Arts monument in which everything that is not classical is nautical, and no expense or effort was spared for design, structure or embellishment. The good news is that the Federal Government, which owns the building, has decided to restore and remodel it for Federal offices. This sensible and desirable action is in line with a policy established in recent years by the General Services Administration, the agency in charge of all Federal construction and properties. This policy gives a higher priority to the reuse of the Government's older, and often superior structures for its own space needs than to renting commercially or building anew."

He is already pointing his campaign toward the fall and an all-out battle with former Gov. Ronald Reagan of California and Representative John B. Anderson, the Illinois Republican running as an independent. So where does that leave Senator Edward M. Kennedy? He has been chasing in vain after the President for seven wearying months. Hardly anyone gives him a chance of winning the nomination. A clamor is building for him to get out of the race before the Democratic Party becomes disastrously divided."

1980-06-01T00:00:00Z,"FOR its first exhibition in the converted school building that is the lustrous new Town Hall here, the Westport/Weston Arts Council is sponsoring a show of mildly avant-garde ''environmental'' work called ''Spatiality/Six Sculptors.'' With it comes a new policy, an attempt, in the words of a council press release, ''to establish an important art center'' by bringing in work by nonlocal artists that displays ''challenging new esthetic concepts.'' How the community takes to all this novelty will be interesting to know. The show was assembled by Carlus Dyer, an artist and former director of the Aldrich Museum in Ridgefield.

1980-06-01T00:00:00Z,"Every country with an operatic tradition has a few national favorites that haven't been accepted elsewhere. Among the Germans, about the best example of that phenomenon is Albert Lortzing. Lortzing's operas, or at least four of them, appear with considerable frequency to this day on German opera stages big and small. In provincial companies unknown singers take on these parts. But the operas crop up at the major houses, too, and nearly every singer with experience in Germany has these roles in his repertory. In this country, the occasional arcane stage revival does make it impossible to say that Lortzing is never performed here. But the major companies don't bother with him, and it has been left to the record companies and importers to provide the American public with some contact with his music. As far as domestic releases are concerned, this has meant ''Zar und Zimmermann'' plus an occasional highlights disk, and a new ''Zar'' has now appeared on CBS Masterworks. But the basic imported versions of ''Der Wildschutz,'' ''Undine,'' ''Der Waffenschmied'' and ''Die Opernprobe'' have remained available despite shifts in the firms doing the importing and in the label designations and catalogue numbers."
1980-06-01T00:00:00Z,"Dark Elegies,'' which American Ballet Theater has revived this season after several years, is very likely Antony Tudor's greatest work. This is not an opinion to which all will subscribe as the British-born choreographer's early reputation was more overtly linked to ballets such as ''Jardin aux Lilas'' (1936) and ''Pillar of Fire''(1942). It was Mr. Tudor's gift for making specific characters reveal their emotions on the ballet stage in these works that captured the attention. Inner feelings and psychological dance-drama were generally not considered classical ballet's preserve. Mr. Tudor was hailed rightly as an innovator. ''Dark Elegies'', unlike these ballets, has no narrative in the strict sense nor does it have characters with names attached. Its own innovative aspects have been subject to debate - it was created by Ballet Rambert in London in 1937 -chiefly because its admirers have sought to find its roots elsewhere. British critics have seen it in the direct line of Michel Fokine's ''Les Sylphides'' or Leonide Massine's ''Choreartium.'' This is a formal link. All these works are plotless and ''Dark Elegies'' may be said, in this line of reasoning, to be chiefly an evocation of the music - not along Balanchinian lines but as a so-called abstraction of a single emotion or a mood."

1980-06-01T00:00:00Z,"Something about Hal Linden seems to inspire confidence. Perhaps it is his direct and level gaze or his rich speaking voice that belongs as much to the singer as to the actor. Whatever it is, it is an integral part of the persona of an actor who is currently making a career out of being a television authority figure: the squad captain on the long-running situation-comedy ''Barney Miller,'' the narrator of ABC-TV's educational children's show ''Animals, Animals'' and the ''star'' of ''FYI,'' the quick-as-a-commercial self-help spots that ABC runs between its afternoon soap operas. This quality seems to work particularly well on television, and although Mr. Linden has spent most of his professional life on the musical stage, it is the small screen that has brought him fame. Now he is attempting to consolidate the singing and dancing that brought him to Broadway with the television career that has made him a star and the city where he was born and raised in ''Hal Linden's Big Apple,'' his second special, which ABC will present this evening at 8. In it the Bronx native is seen dancing and singing all around town, from the Fulton Fish Market to Kennedy Airport, from Madison Avenue to Times Square, and sharing comedy routines with Shecky Greene and Robert Guillaume and doing a production number backed up by the Radio City Music Hall Rockettes."

But now, seven years later, we need not refer to the Second World War.

1980-06-01T00:00:00Z,"Edward Auer, who will present his fourth New York recital in as many years Tuesday night at the 92d St. Y, is a pianist with impressive credentials. From the age of 10 he studied with the celebrated pedagogue Aube Tzerko in Los Angeles, where he grew up and has mainly lived. As an undergraduate at Juilliard, he was a scholarship student of Rosina Lhevinne. After earning a Bachelor's degree, he was awarded a Fulbright grant to work with Julius Katchen in Paris. He won a prize in every international competition he entered, including the Chopin (fifth prize, 1965), the Tchaikovsky (fifth prize, 1966), and the Marguerite Long (first prize, 1967). He has played three times with the Los Angeles Philharmonic, and made five recordings. And yet, at 38, Mr. Auer remains an artist far better known to connoisseurs than to the public at large. Why, one wonders, didn't the big prizes lead to a bigger career? The question was put to the pianist some months ago in New York. ''There are three basic ways you could look at it,'' Mr. Auer replied. ''One is that it's a combination of circumstances - in other words, bad luck, or not as good luck as you would want. Or it's the type of artist that you are, that you're slightly more subtle, or a less splashy stage personality. Or it's that you're no damned good.''"

The lanky 6-foot-6-inch-tall tap-dancing Texan choreographed and directed the revue, which combines a send-up of old Hollywood musicals with a slapstick Marx Brothers routine. The critics have hailed Mr. Tune for his remarkable achievement in evoking the lavish scale of Hollywood in its heyday with a cast of only six. Mel Gussow, for one, called him ''the toetapping Broadway heir to Busby Berkeley. What his predecessor did with 50 dancing girls and a sound stage, he can do, in cameo, with four feet.'' The first half of the show is set in the lobby of Grauman's Chinese Theater in Hollywood, with the cast dressed as ushers. Peggy Hewett sings to a Nelson Eddy made out of cardboard, Priscilla Lopez dances hysterically as a singer dreamily croons ''Sleepy Time Gal,'' and the cast plays ''Japanese Sandman'' on ukulele and chopsticks. But the piece de resistance takes place on a sliver of a stage overhead, where two dancers, Niki Harris and Albert Stephenson dance, with only their feet showing, like puppets dangling on strings. In ''Famous Feet'' the dancers impersonate Judy Garland, Charlie Chaplin, Fred Astaire and Ginger Rogers, Minnie and Mickey Mouse, in what Mr. Gussow termed ''a small miracle of theatrical inventiveness.''"

If we add to the list of Miss Graves's primary resources some carved objects from paleolithic times, the trajectory of a jumping frog as it was recorded by a camera in 1971, and a record of the signs that were exchanged between an American Indian and a white American Army officer during the ferrying of 16 camels across the Colorado River in 1858, it will be clear that Nancy Graves is an artist who looks far and wide for her raw material and regards no given image as essentially alien."

Then ''Who's Afraid of Virginia Woolf?'' didn't complete its run because Mike Nichols came down with pneumonia. But, as Shakespeare put it, ''All's well that ends well,'' and the final effort of the Long Wharf season is a gem. It is ''Cyrano de Bergerac'' by Edmond Rostand, and the production is a beauty. There is a tendency to think of ''Cyrano'' as much older than it actually is.

1980-06-01T00:00:00Z,"Mr. and Mrs. Duncan Hunter Mauran of Providence, R.I., have announced the engagement of their daughter, Hope Ives Mauran, to Frederick Rall Walsh Jr., son of Mr., and Mrs. Walsh of Troy, N.Y. Miss Mauran, an alumna of the Mary C. Wheeler School, expects to graduate next month from the University of New Hampshire. Her fiance is studying at the Harvard Graduate School of Business Administration. He is an alumnus of the Berkshire School and Brown University, and attended the London School of Economics."
1980-06-01T00:00:00Z,"MARY SMITH can recall the many times when, as a child, she was kept home from school to look after the younger children in her family. Later, as a mother of four, she agonized over what she believed to be the inadequacy of the care her children received while she was working to support them. Ten years ago, determined to do what she could to see to it that other city children did not suffer the same fate, Miss Smith became one of the founding mothers of Babyland, the first infant day-care center serving the Newark-Elizabeth area."
1980-06-01T00:00:00Z,"Ronald Reagan will meet with Gerald R. Ford at Mr. Ford's home in Rancho Mirage, Calif., on Thursday to discuss the former President's role in the general election campaign, officials of Mr. Reagan's campaign said today."
1980-06-01T00:00:00Z,"THE black bass, whether smallmouth or largemouth, is a neglected game fish throughout most of New Hampshire. The reason is imbedded in custom. Resident New Hampshire anglers have traditionally favored salmonoid fish (trout and salmon), and it was not until the last decade that significant numbers paid attention to bass. That attitude has created the splendid opportunity for bass fishermen in the state, and they pursue their quarry all year. There are restrictions in May and June (the spawning period for both species of black bass) when fishermen are limited to lures and to two fish of any size. During all other periods, bait may also be used and the limit is five fish of any size."
1980-06-01T00:00:00Z,"Among the most highly paid residents of Publishers Row are the art directors of the mass-market paperback houses -highly paid because their challenging job is to design covers that will impel browsers to pick copies of their latest publications out of the racks and carry them to the check-out counters. It's not hard to concoct a design that will captivate fans of genre books - an embracing couple for lovers of romance, a screaming child for addicts of the occult. But what of the book whose appeal is wide and diverse? Some art directors attempt to solve that quandary by crowding their 7-by-4 1/4 inch covers with type and pictures describing a book's varied attractions. Pocket Books' Milton Charles, a believer in the ''neat, clean look,'' took another approach in packaging Herman Wouk's best-selling (1,600,000 hard- cover copies) novel of World War II, ''War and Remembrance.'' He designed six different covers, each emphasizing one of the book's appeals. Four of these are shown above - as a story of Navy life, a love story, a story of mother-and-child, a story of the generations on the home front. Two others conjure up thoughts of military action and of family sagas. When the six covers are displayed side by side in the racks, even the hastiest browser is quick to get the point. Mr. Charles's formula seems to be paying off. This week, for the second in succession, ''War and Remembrance'' is No. 1 on our massmarket paperback best seller list. Formula? Mr. Charles would protest that word. Every week, he says, an art director faces a new batch of challenges and must find fresh ways to solve them."
1980-06-01T00:00:00Z,"WALK into Glen Kolotkin's home in Cold Spring Harbor and you'll see a wall decorated with gold records. ''One for Barbra Streisand, two from Dr. Hook, one from Jimi Hendrix, about six from Santana,'' he said. ''That's a dead giveaway.'' If this were ''What's My Line,'' no one would have difficulty divining that he is associated with the music business. Mr. Kolotkin, at the age of 37, is to records what a director is to a movie. Sophisticated moviegoers have long accepted the idea of director as auteur. Mr. Kolotkin, a producer-engineer who now heads his own company, is the recording industry's counterpart."

Yet there are scores more, perhaps hundreds of other ad hoc hacks, who earn a buck by taking a flier. The bulk of airport-transport business, understandably, is provided by the traveling businessman whose employers reimburse him anywhere from $25 to $45 for the limo trip. Rarely is price a roadblock for most companies. Whatever the cost, it's important to get their weary Willie Lomans back to Larchmont safely and comfortably."
1980-06-01T00:00:00Z,"BEGINNING shortly after daybreak next Saturday morning, a caravan of 200 station wagons, pickup trucks and vans will line up at the entrance to the Veterans Park playing field here. Their sleepy drivers will be antiques dealers representing shops not only from throughout Connecticut but also from most of the other Eastern states. They will have traveled to Ridgefield to participate in the annual Ridgefield Flea Market and will be at the park early to register, be assigned their individual exhibit space, unpack, set up their displays and prepare for the two phases of business that make up any antiques fair. Many will have made the trip - in some instances driving three to five hours - to get to the show on time not only to sell to collectors once the market officially opens at 10 A. M., but also for the opportunity to buy, sell and trade antiques with other dealers. This sort of wholesale business helps keep stock ''fresh'' and replenishes inventories in a business that cannot ever buy anything that someone else has not owned. It is also a time to greet friends from distant areas, and talk almost incessantly about what type of antique is selling best in which market, and for dealers to buy for their own private collections."
1980-06-01T00:00:00Z,"MOST home handymen are already familiar with silicone rubber, it is a versatile adhesive and a long-lasting caulking compound that is excellent for many sealing and repairing jobs around the house. However, many do not realize that in addition to being available in its usual paste-like or mastic consistency which comes packed in tubes and in disposable caulking cartridges, silicone rubber is also available as a coating or liquid that can be applied with an ordinary paint brush or roller. Called Silicone Rubber Coating, and made by the Dow Corning Corporation, it is sold in quart cans and is available through paint and hardware stores, as well as through some lumber yards and home centers. Like the regular silicone rubber caulking compounds, this exceptionally adhesive weatherproof coating acts as a sealant and protective film that will withstand severe temperature extremes (from 65 degrees below zero to 450 degrees above). It is completely waterproof and will far outlast most ordinary plastic or asphalt roof coatings, according to weathering tests conducted by the manufacturer, and, like regular silicone compounds, it also has exceptional resistance to attack by most chemicals and solvents found around the home, or in the workshop and garage. Silicone Rubber Coating comes in only one color - a kind of medium gray, similar to what many would call a ''battleship gray.'' Its most widespread use around the home is probably for coating, repairing and waterproofing of roofs and similar areas on the outside of the house, particularly in places where there are joints or seams where two different surfaces meet."
1980-06-01T00:00:00Z,"The only known material witness to the shooting of Vernon E. Jordan Jr., president of the National Urban League, remained in seclusion here today and had not talked with police investigators since the hours immediately after the assault early Thursday morning. Martha C. Anderson Coleman, a member of the board of directors of the Fort Wayne Urban League, reportedly told the police that she drove Mr. Jordan to the Marriott Motor Inn from her two-story frame home and that he was shot in the back as he got out of her red and white car."
1980-06-01T00:00:00Z,"ON-THE-LAKE, Ontario - Andrei Serban's controversial 1977 staging of ''The Cherry Orchard'' is now sifting down into the provinces. The Shaw Festival's production of Chekhov's masterpiece, featuring Carole Shelley as Mme. Ranevsky, looks like a bus-and-truck knock-off of the Lincoln Center version. Curiously enough, the director of the evening is Radu Penciulescu, who once taught Mr. Serban theater back in their native Rumania. The question is who taught Mr. Penciulescu? His ''Cherry Orchard'' is a lifeless affair that doesn't even have the courage of its own questionable convictions. Like Mr. Serban, Mr. Penciulescu has created a white-on-white ''Orchard,'' well designed by Astrid Janson, and tried for broad comic effects. But he hasn't had the guts to go all the way. Though the stage is a snowy expanse, the indoor scenes take place on conventional sets that are clumsily yanked into view by peasants."
1980-06-01T00:00:00Z,"In a 1962 article in Les Amis du Cinema in defense of Louis Aragon, the avant-garde poet and playwright whom he then admired, Jean Luc Godard wrote, ''But do not mistake the power of fashion. For its sake, ideas - like women - disfigure themselves. It can make youth ridiculous and beauty perilous.'' It is in the continuing manner of filmmaker/critic Godard that - although he subsequently turned against Aragon - his words, like his films, continue to assert a truth that appears to be independent of the man who put them together. Godard's critics express it in a different way. They say he contradicts himself. This, however, is completely to miss the point of this most questing, most innovative, most passionate of contemporary directors, who came to this Cannes Film Festival as an unrepentent revolutionary seeking publicity and a theatrical release for his newest film, ''Sauve Qui Peut La Vie,'' the English title of which is ''Slow Motion.''"

1980-06-01T00:00:00Z,"DEMOCRACY? By MALCOLM W. BROWNE Victory for a political candidate in a democratic society can depend as much on the voting system used as on voters' preferences. With another Presidential election year at an important stage, political scientists are again pondering ways of making America more ''democratic'' by tinkering with its electoral machinery. Some are lamenting what they consider a miscarriage of justice in the 1980 primaries, which end this week. Prof. Steven J. Brams of New York University contends that if Republican Party primaries this year had used a different voting system, one in which, for example, the electorate could cast ''approval'' votes for all acceptable candidates, not just one for a favorite, Gerald Ford might have perceived support for his candidacy, run and, says Professor Brams, been frontrunner instead of Ronald Reagan."

If President Carter should finish third in electoral votes (and this is not impossible), Vice President Mondale would be automatically eliminated from consideration by the Senate.

In the theater, the incomparable, innovative and idiosyncratic sounds of one of its all-time great composers have sporadically burst forth over the years, but somehow, all at once, during the 80th anniversary of his birth, and just 30 years after his death, the resurgence of Weill's music has reached a peak - in concert halls and opera houses, in cabarets and legitimate theaters. What has been correctly called the Kurt Weill renaissance should enlarge the composer's cult following. One cannot reasonably expect more, for Weill's music remains too special for mass appeal."
1980-06-01T00:00:00Z,"John Wydler has been a consistent advocate of nuclear power, so it is not surprising that in his May 11 article (Opinion Page) he calls it ''the best choice'' and disparages alternatives such as coal. Naturally he ignores the two chief dangers of nuclear power, the possibility of accident - not minor accidents such as at Three Mile Island and other plants, but catastrophic accidents of the ''China Syndrome'' variety - and that from nuclear wastes, which keep accumulating and accumulating with no good solution in sight. Mr. Wydler plays up the drawbacks of coal, a resource that we have in abundance and that is our ''ace in the hole'' for beating the OPEC price pirates who have jacked up the price 15-fold in the last decade. The health risks from burning coal can be minimized by new methods developed for ''cleaning'' it, now feasible with high energy prices. The suddenly discovered ''greenhouse effect'' and acid rain make me wonder who is behind the publicity given these ''effects.'' They are a result of hydrocarbon burning, not just of coal. The increase, or theorized increase, has taken place at a time when the use of coal was declining, not increasing."

Relying on the principle that modern medicine is divided into specialties, he argued that the job called mainly for an internist and he had not been trained as one. He had completed one of five years of surgical residency at the Spartanburg (S.C.) General Hospital and was assigned to the Marine Corps at Camp Lejeune, N.C. The Marines, standing on the time-honored principle of orders are orders, court-martialed the 26-year-old lieutenant late last year.

Planes - all two-handled versions - fill a segment of another, looking for all the world like a flock of birds in flight. And high above those compelling images, reamers are arranged to shape two awesome wheels - their handles serving as spokes, their boring-irons as sections of the rims. Hand-crafted tools used by wood and iron workers from the 16th through 19th centuries are frequently impressive to both the eye and the touch, as can be seen in an exhibition of Jan Firch's collection on view (through June 14) at the O.K. Harris Gallery, 383 West Broadway. The Czechoslovakian-born collector, who now lives in Paris, is an antiques dealer specializing in forged iron artifacts - ''but no tools'' he said the other day. The 600 tools he owns are part of his private collection which he assembled from European sources over the last 20 years and the bulk of which he hopes to sell as one unit. The price? $300,000.

But everywhere you go, people say roller skates aren't allowed. If I go to a parking lot that's not used during the weekend, they tell me I can't skate there. They say, 'Go to a rink.' But I'm not a rink person; I don't like to go around in circles.'' Now after years of rolling around the West Coast and New York City, the outdoor roller-skating craze has swept into Westchester. First came the rink boom. Murray Skate Center in Yonkers was the avant-garde with disco roller-skating seven years ago. Then came Easy Glider in Baldwin Place, Skate City in Yorktown, the Rink in New Rochelle and roller-skating at the County Center in White Plains. This month the Ebersole Rink in White Plains put away the ice making machine; now there's outdoor roller-skating there, with exhibitions of fancy footwork, splits, spread eagles, spins, jumps and spills."

Representative Edwin B. Forsythe, a conservative from Moorestown, was especially frank in a recent interview. Originally, Mr. Forsythe was ''very hopeful'' for George Bush's chances, but then, as he watched those chances fade, he also determined that, instead of being concerned about the Presidential race, ''it was more important for me to get re-elected.''"

Oil exports have fallen to 500,000 barrels a day, oil-industry sources say, in a steady decline from the roughly 4.6 million barrels produced daily for export during the rule of the Shah. Severe economic and political difficulties are foreshadowed for the new Government as a consequence of the sharp decline in oil revenues,which have been the basis of Iran's wealth, its foreignexchange power and much of its economy. Further pressure comes from an inflation rate estimated at 50 percent a year. Commenting on the situation, a young Iranian economist said: ''The signals we are seeing with the coming rate of inflation, particularly on foodstuffs, a fall of oil revenues, this year's budget in the coming emergency budget, the signals coming from industry, with the old problems of worker dissatisfaction, some raw materials and component problems in management ineptitudes - they all point to a fairly bleak picture of the economy.''"

President Carter said that the United States would not permit ''any action that would destroy the sanctity of and the present form of U.N. 242.'' (Page 1, Column 6.) Iran's oil revenues have declined. That and other ominous economic trends ''are heating up towards some sort of economic collapse or disaster,'' according to an Iranian economist.

Mr. Kennedy, campaigning in San Francisco, said Mr. Carter was a ''clone of Ronald Reagan.'' (1:2.) A lead in the Vernon Jordan shooting proved fruitless. The F.B.I. said that a rifle seized from a motorcyclist in Fort Wayne, Ind., where the president of the National Urban League was shot Thursday, was not the weapon used in the attack, although it was believed to be the same type of gun.

Established in Greek mythology in the account of Pygmalion - a king and sculptor whose statue of an idealized female figure was brought to life by Aphrodite - the subject has enlivened our own era in George Bernard Shaw's famous play about a Cockney transformed into a lady and, most spectacularly, in ''My Fair Lady,'' the Lerner and Loewe musical based on the Shaw play. But our century was not the first to have a Pymalion musical. An opera-ballet by Michel de la Rorre existed as early as 1700, and on Thursday night the Concert Royal and the New York Baroque Dance Company gave the first New York performance of Jean-Philippe Rameau's ''Pygmalion,'' an opera-ballet that dates from 1748."

The youngsters' youthful anticipations were not far off the mark, although their imaginings did not include the excitement at seeing and feeling the orange-hot heat of steel being rolled for hoods and doors, of trainloads of molten metal making their way between buildings or car bodies descending from the ceiling to meet awaiting axles.

Public hearings are to be held in New York City tomorrow; in White Plains at the County Center at 2 P.M. Tuesday, and in Connecticut on Wednesday. WHEN I first began to commute to New York from the Scarborough station in Briarcliff Manor, I was not vitally concerned with what it was costing me in rail fare. After all, $18.75 a month was a manageable sum in 1950. Nor was my standard of living affected a few years later when the fare increased to $24.70. I was still able to drop a coin in the collection box every Sunday at church. In 1960 the cost of a monthly ticket jumped to $33.50. In 1970 it hit $36.50 and in 1972 $47. It was as if Conrail were bent on staking out a course later taken by our astronauts."
1980-06-01T00:00:00Z,"Residents of the Pacific Northwest learned once again last week how thin and fragile is the layer of technological civilization that covers the face of the earth. For the first time, glowing lava pushed to the surface of the Mount St. Helens crater in what geologists say may be the first stage of a dome forming. For the second time in two weeks the peak erupted, not with a cataclysmic bang but with a column of ash 40,000 feet high and spread by southwesterly winds over the populous lower Columbia River region of coastal Oregon and Washington. There gentle rains turned the drifting ash cloud into a drizzle of mud, locally interrupting electricity and communications and creating an awful mess. Some 12,000 square miles received the ashfall, which a Washington official said brought visibility to zero in Olympia, the state capital. Interstate Highway 5 was closed between Longview and Olympia when up to an inch of mud coated the road. Portland International Airport was closed for a day and a 15-mile-an-hour speed limit imposed in the city. Four local radio stations were knocked off the air, some telephone circuits and electric transmission lines failed, and search-and-rescue efforts following the eruption of May 18 were halted."

1980-06-01T00:00:00Z,"prisoner By ROBERT PEAR WASHINGTON - Five years ago, the American Civil Liberties Union and other liberal groups attacked a proposal to revise Federal criminal laws as a potential tool of government repression. Under the guise of ''reform,'' these organizations contended, the 753-page plan would create an Official Secrets Act, punish the press for publishing classified information, expand the espionage laws, strengthen penalties for marijuana possession and increase the likelihood of capital punishment. They set out to ''stop S.1'' as the Senate bill was then known, and they succeeded. Much has changed. As the House Judiciary Committee considered yet another version of the criminal code last month, the chief critic was not the Civil Liberties Union. It was the Carter Administration's Justice Department, which surprised many committee members when it offered them a package of about 30 amendments."

Before another decision in 1975, the better-known Hellerstein case - in which the Court of Appeals ruled that the 200-year-old tradition of assessing property in the state at only a percentage of its true value was invalid - residential property was assessed at a lower rate than commercial property.

JAMAICA is the seductive setting of these two novels - a Jamaica stricken with change, with moral contamination; suffering from an eroded sense of identity, from a complicated modernity. There is something backward in the exertions of development; Kingston is Babylon, dangerous and desperate; even the tropical heat becomes a metaphor for menacing, conspiratorial forces. Though the books share a setting, their perceptions are quite different and there are no similarities of style or tone. Russell Banks's ''The Book of Jamaica'' spans only a brief time and is set mostly along the northern coast of the island; Michael Thelwell's ''The Harder They Come'' is a chronicle of generations and is set primarily in the Kingston ghetto."

Where, I wondered, could these dressed-for-the-night people be going in midafternoon? And why were they carrying what looked like the makings of a beach party?

The champion steeplechase jockey of the 1953-54 season, he is perhaps best remembered for riding the Queen Mother Elizabeth's horse, Devon Loch, in the 1956 Grand National at Aintree. Fifty yards from the finish line, way ahead of the field, the horse suddenly went down on his belly, all four legs out, with a startled Mr. Francis still aboard. Dramatic photographs of the fall were printed in newspapers throughout the world. Mr. Francis, then 36, continued racing for another nine months, then retired after he had a fall that badly bruised his spleen. He became a racing columnist for London's Sunday Express and, when he found he had a hard time supporting his wife and two sons on a journalist's salary, began writing mystery-thrillers with a racing background. Many of them were best sellers in England and several other countries, but it wasn't until his current and 20th book, ''Whip Hand,'' that a Dick Francis novel has shown up on The New York Times Best Seller List. ''I think the television series had a lot to do with it,'' Mr. Francis, now 59, said in an interview from his home near the Berkshire village of Blewbury, England.

It would certainly benefit a group that cannot agree on where to dine. At El Parral, some can try Spanish specialties while others remain in familiar northern Italian territory. Most of the time the two cuisines merely coexist without borrowing from each other, but there are a few dishes in which the Spanish influence flavors a more typically Italian preparation. A good example of this is the clams casino. Eight littlenecks on the halfshell are topped with seasoned crumbs and, instead of the usual dicings of bacon, pieces of Spanish sausage - chorizo - add an unusually bright, peppery flavor to the dish."

Domenici said two weeks ago. His doublewhammy allusion to the foes of Woodrow Wilson and Deng Xiaoping made instant celebrities of the Democratic Representatives. They took to wearing large red buttons with black Chinese calligraphy which proclaimed, they said, ''Join the Gang of Five.'' The five liberal-to-moderate Congressmen, second- and thirdtermers, mostly in their early forties, may not yet be national leaders. But they are interesting not only because of what they did, but because they represent the so-called new breed of Congressional Democrats, who depart from the party's tradition of unquestioned support of organized labor and unshaken faith in the efficacy of social programs. They are also serious-minded and respected by their colleagues, and their opposition to the House-Senate compromise budget of $613.3 billion on the ground that it gave too much to the military and took too much from social programs presaged the measure's overwhelming defeat on the House floor last week."

1980-06-01T00:00:00Z,"UMBERTO's, located in a charming, diminutive house that fronts directly on the sidewalk as though it were in an old seaport, is a restaurant that knows its mind. Inner directed, you might call it. It offers a very brief menu - four appetizers, four pastas, five main dishes, four desserts - and does well by every dish but two. Now, there is something engaging in the idea that by dining alla Italiana (appetizer, pasta, main course, sweet) a small band of determined customers can eat its way through the whole menu in a single evening, getting a comprehensive view of the state of the art in that particular kitchen at that particular moment. But there is also something downright impressive in the self-assurance of Umberto, the chef-owner, about his cooking: take it or leave it, his menu seems to say. Scanning the nearby tables as closely as we could, we saw no one leaving it. Umberto serves a lovely green salad just after the main course. If a diner asked to have it at some other place on the bill of fare, the restaurant would certainly oblige. But the waiter will emphatically fail to ask him whether he wants it with Italian, French, Russian or blue cheese dressing. At Umberto's the salad is offered only one way: Umberto's way, which is tangy and delicious - mixed lettuces with sprays of watercress, arugola and endive, dressed plainly and perfectly in oil and wine vinegar."

1980-06-01T00:00:00Z,"HUNTINGTON SOME contemporary artists are quite uncomfortable with the past. They either revere it to the point where they become completely absorbed in it, sometimes annihilating their own sensibilities, or they spurn it unabashedly, trying with near desperation to create something new. Usually they end up fostering another kickshaw for the already overly plentiful bric-a-brac of art. Four contemporary artists, who are incidentally Long Islanders, make the neat point in an exhibition at the Heckscher Museum that they are not disturbed by the past in the least; in fact, they are quite peacefully at home with it. Their work reflects an understanding of historic art, perhaps even an admiration of it. Yet they never fall prey to deference, for they use what they have learned from traditional conceits to inform their works, using them as points of departure for self-discovery."

The legendary force, momentum and multiplicity of Picasso's gifts have not been exaggerated, after all. They are truly prodigious, and the art that resulted from this extraordinary endowment is, as promised, presented to us in this exhibition on a scale and with a discrimination never before lavished on Picasso or any other modern artist. That his art proves to be fully equal to this outsize scale - that, indeed, it requires this scale to be fully seen and understood -is but one of the many revelations this exhibition discloses to us for the first time. Thus, though Picasso has long been the most famous of modern artists, and in New York one of the most frequently exhibited, this show nonetheless gives us a new measure of his achievement. Henceforth, Picasso will live for us as the artist we will have studied and lived with - and argued about, and at times even been a little sickened by - in this exhibition."

In Tuesday's California primary, there will be three such plans, including Proposition 9, intended to cut state personal income taxes by 50 percent. These propositions reflect a nationwide demand for tax reform, but they and their progeny in other states have confused reform with budget capping."

He points out, quite correctly, that the allies are not fully cooperating with President Carter's program of ''sanctions'' because they have no confidence either in the President or in his program. Then Mr. Reston adds that if the allies ''had backed President Carter in a common front, with effective sanctions against the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan and against Iran ... this whole tragedy might have been avoided.''"

Aside from that, however, ''The Wooing of Earth'' offers little of what we have come to expect nowadays from a book on the endangered environment. Instead of doom and denunciation, there is faith, hope, a charitable view of man and an unhackneyed way of looking at his uses of nature."
1980-06-01T00:00:00Z,"ALTHOUGH ''Man of La Mancha'' has only been around since 1965, it has taken on the reputation of a classic of musical theater. I suspect the reason is ''The Quest,'' the song that is better known as ''The Impossible Dream.'' At any dinner theater at which I've seen the show - and Nanuet makes the third - the beginning of the song is greeted with sighs as if the audience were collectively taking off a pair of tight shoes. The ending is cheered. No doubt this all has something to do with a longing for hope in an unhappy world. In any case, ''Man of La Mancha'' has been chosen as the show to celebrate Coachlight of Nanuet's first anniversary, a good choice obviously, since press releases from the theater claim the largest advance sales to date on any show that has played there. Those ticket buyers can sleep at ease. Assuming one adores ''Man of La Mancha,'' Coachlight has given them an excellent production."

So on the face of it, the registered voters in that family should go to the polls on June 3 and vote for Proposition 9, which would cut California income taxes by more than half - in the case of the family cited, by 69.5 percent to only $68.90, a fat savings of $156.90."

Some 12,000 square miles received the ashfall, which a Washington official said brought visibility to zero in Olympia, the state capital. Interstate Highway 5 was closed between Longview and Olympia when up to an inch of mud coated the road.

Color explodes. Magnolias unfold broad petals whose creaminess shades into rose-streaked lavender bases. Azaleas blaze in intensities of melon, pink, violet and red.

Again and again Miss Hellman tries to corner memory, forcing it to reveal the truth about the people and events she is trying to make sense of. Important epistemological questions are suggested: How valid is what we know - or think we know - about the people who dropped in and out of our lives in the past? How can we tell where memory blends into fantasy, producing a composite that takes on different shapes at different times, according to our needs? At the end of Miss Hellman's struggle with these questions, we have to settle for some very dusty answers; meanwhile we have been entertained, dismayed and, above all, tantalized."

Perhaps, as sometimes happens on crowded planes, the economy-class washrooms become unsanitary or run out of supplies. Perhaps you dislike a meal. Perhaps cigarette smoke is bothering you, but no effort is made to find you a different seat. Perhaps an attendant is rude."

1980-06-01T00:00:00Z,"Is there a future for a small, independent classical record company that makes its headquarters on an eight-acre ranch in the wilds of the Pacific Northwest? If the prospect appears dubious, consider the company's speciality - recording offbeat and contemporary chamber music that features the oboe. Given the economic uncertainties that beset the record industry today, such a minority-appeal undertaking sounds like a lunatic idea and doomed to failure. No such thing. Despite the odds, against him, Peter Christ, who founded Crystal Records in 1966, has turned this Walter Mitty dream into reality, and without the support of private grants or ''vanity'' subsidies from the artists he records. His label is just one among dozens of such hardy enterprises that, while not exaxtly earning a fortune, are making a solid go of it in many parts of the country."
1980-06-01T00:00:00Z,"Last week, the House resoundingly rejected the House-Senate compromise on the First Budget Resolution for fiscal 1981 on the grounds that it contained too much for the military, and sent it back to the conference committee. But, shortly after the vote, and the departure of many members, Republicans passed a measure directing the House conferees to insist on sticking with the military spending figures. Even if the resolution eventually passes, the budget process faces a difficult year. Indeed, it is easy to ridicule what has ocurred so far in the Congressional deliberations. Quite aside from the specifics of last week's contradictory voting, our legislators have been busily pretending that they are providing for a balanced budget in 1981 while ignoring the unpleasant fact that the economy is in a free fall that virtually guarantees a deficit exceeding $20 billion given the spending and tax policies now inherent in the first resolution. It is, in fact, not difficult to visualize a deficit far in excess of $50 billion as the bad news continues to roll in, and encourages Congress to undertake ''countercyclical'' spending increases and tax cuts."

1980-06-01T00:00:00Z,"classroom By FOX BUTTERFIELD PEKING - For the past year, Li Guanghua has been going to night school six evenings a week after finishing work in his factory. A quiet, intense 26-year-old who was assigned to the automotive parts plant after high school, he had hoped to take an exam this summer enabling him to register for China's new and highly popular television university. Its students are exempted from regular jobs to watch classes on the screen, and when they graduate in three years are likely to get a better job and a pay raise, both hard to come by in China. But the Communist Party committee that runs Mr. Li's factory refused to let him and several other ambitious workers put down their names. ''They told me they couldn't afford to let us study for so long and that anything I studied would be useless for the factory,'' Mr. Li recalled. Mr. Li thinks he understands why. The party secretary was originally a peasant, and the four other committee members were poor rickshaw pullers before the Communist victory in 1949. None had more than a year or two of schooling. Hence they are distrustful of Peking's new policy calling for greater technical competence among workers and managers to help achieve modernization."

1980-06-01T00:00:00Z,"HE first all-female class of candidates for the New Jersey State Police is nearing the end of an intense four-month training program that combines college-level academic courses with rigorous physical exercise and weapons instruction. Thirty-three of the 104 women who reported to the State Police Academy here on Feb. 13 are still in the program and expect to be graduated on June 27.

Just how difficult it is to become a trooper can be gleaned from the statistical history of the present class. At the outset, 1,631 women took the written examination - the first step - and 670 passed. Medical examinations reduced the number of candidates to 255, and oral interviews and background checks further reduced the list to 116, who were invited to report on Feb. 3. Of that number, 104 showed up."

1980-06-01T00:00:00Z,"By JAMES M. MARKHAM MADRID - Spain's politics of consensus died last week. ''Suarez has reached the highest level of democracy that he is capable of administering,'' complained Alfonso Guerra, numbertwo man in the Socialist Party, from the speaker's tribunal in the vaulting Cortes. ''Suarez cannot stand any more democracy, and democracy cannot stand any more of Suarez!'' The Socialist was intervening in a remarkable, three-day debate on a motion of censure - the first of its kind in post-Franco Spain - against the conservative Government of Prime Minister Adolfo Suarez. The Socialist censure motion failed, as expected, to gather the necessary majority in the 350-member lower house that would have installed Felipe Gonzalez, the Socialist leader, in Mr. Suarez's place. The vote was 152 in favor and 166 against - all from the Suarez party; the rest of the deputies abstained. But the debate itself was significant. A huge television and radio audience followed the sharp, funny, heated parliamentary give-and-take deep into the early hours of the morning, suggesting that Spaniards are not as bored with their young democracy as Madrid intellectuals and editorial writers maintain."
1980-06-01T00:00:00Z,"The defection of Bruce Clark, the defensive tackle from Penn State, to the Toronto Argonauts of the Canadian Football League last week caused more than a ripple in National Football League circles. Clark was the third player chosen, by the Green Bay Packers, in this year's draft and the first of the defensive linemen. The loss to the Packers seems devastating as Clark was to have anchored a new three-linemen, four-linebacker defense at nose tackle. Bart Starr, the Green Bay coach, blamed Clark's agent, and not the athlete, for the signing with a Canadian team. Players' agents are certain to be a subject among team owners when they meet in Atlanta this week. Last year, the first pick in the N.F.L. draft, Tom Cousineau, a linebacker from Ohio State who had been drafted by the Buffalo Bills, also chose the Canadian League."

By Sol Stern ou didn't see it on ''Wide World of Sports,'' but a national championship swimming meet, sponsored by the Amateur Athletic Union, was held recently in Fort Lauderdale, Fla. It was an event of recordshattering performances, and demonstrated, as well, that high-level competitive swimming - contrary to popular perception - is not the exclusive preserve of our nation's teen-agers. Entered in the threeday meet were about 1,000 of the best ''masters'' swimmers from around the country - men and women aged 25 to 87 who have proved themselves in scores of local contests during the past year. Races were conducted in all the standard swimming events - freestyle, backstroke, breast-stroke, butterfly and individual medley - and swimmers competed against others in the same age brackets. (For example, a 50-year-old woman would compete only against other women in the 50- to 54-year-old age group.) This annual event is as much a symptom of the physical-fitness craze of the last decade was the growth of long-distance running. The difference is that the development of swimming as a sport for adults has been almost entirely by word of mouth. There have been no bestselling books by swimming ''gurus''; no inspirational television movies about middle-aged housewives taking up the challenge of longdistance swimming; no corporate funding and support of swimming meets."

Our times may not have confirmed that judgment, but this posthumously published (1954) autobiography, now returned to print, remains a moving portrait of a gifted, sensitive woman in her 60's candidly looking at herself in the mirror. ULTRA GOES TO WAR, by Ronald Lewin. (Pocket, $2.95.) An account, based on official documents, of Ultra, the operation by which the Allies intercepted, rendered intelligible and circulated the coded messages that the Germans transmitted by radio during World War II. In reviewing it, Drew Middleton called it ''truth far more engrossing than fiction. No important future history of the war can conceivably be written without consulting it.'' TERMINATION ORDER, by Philip Friedman. (Dell, $2.25.) Gregory Moore, who has identified as a Russian mole a high official in the Central Intelligence Agency at Langley, Va., goes to Vienna to see that justice is done there, only to find himself on both the C.I.A. and K.G.B. hit lists. ''Philip Friedman goes Len Deighton one better. He paints a grim picture with literary finesse,'' Newgate Callendar declared. ''One of the best spy stories of the year.''"
1980-06-01T00:00:00Z,"More than a dozen years ago, when Mrs. B moved into her $112-amonth railroad flat in the low 100's off Central Park West, her building was freshly painted, the front door secure, heat and hot water were taken for granted, and her neighbors were working people. Today, that same building is scarred by graffiti, the front door hangs open and useless, and the top-floor apartments, long vacant, serve as gathering places for narcotics addicts. In one ground-floor apartment, drug dealers openly conduct business. Heat and hot water are only memories here. Last summer the landlord told his remaining tenants, mainly welfare clients, that he was giving up."

Edward Kalaydjian, the dealership's president, hopes that the huge stuffed animals will attract customers and boost sagging automobile sales. Mr. Kalaydjian's gimmick may be unusual, but his predicament is not. In Westchester, combined sales of foreign and domestic cars are down 20 percent from last year at this time, according to Peter Gordon, executive vice president of the Greater New York Automobile Dealers' Association. (Nationally, Mr. Gordon said, sales are down approximately 35 percent.) Since the first of the year, he said, five dealerships in the county have gone out of business, leaving a total of 80."

For Carl Anthony Vergari, the District Attorney since 1968, the timing was particularly depressing. The death of Mrs. Prouty, a retired senior editor at The Reader's Digest, came just as the end of the Bedford case was in sight, with two men to be sentenced Wednesday on four counts of second-degree murder."
1980-06-01T00:00:00Z,"SOME cellists spend half their lives complaining about the sparse repertory for their instrument, especially compared to that for violin or piano, while others prefer to seek out unusual pieces and fresh methods of presenting them. Heinrich Joachim, who teaches both at the Westchester Conservatory of Music in White Plains and the Armonk Village School of Music, seems clearly to be of the latter persuasion, his enthusiasm for the cello and its music matched only by his missionary zeal in bringing audiences around to his point of view. ''It's an interesting thing,'' Mr. Joachim told me, ''that the cello is much better liked in southern Westchester than in the northern communities. There are excellent cello faculties at the conservatories in White Plains and Scarsdale, to name just two, we have many interested students and a very large audience for the instrument. It's just not so in the upper parts of the county, though, and that's one of the reasons I try to put on concerts in Armonk that are novel and rather special in one way or another.''"
1980-06-01T00:00:00Z,"While everyone was preoccupied this spring with Afghanistan and Iran and how they overlapped into questions of trans-Atlantic solidarity, there was a strange flutter of nervousness in Bonn and Frankfurt that got barely any attention at all. Beneath the high, jarring frequencies of discussion of war and peace, there was an undertone of concern about the West German economy. Just as West Germany was starting to fully play the political role of Europe's leading power - with responsibility for the efforts of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization to shore up its Turkish and Greek flanks, more activity within the International Monetary Fund and an unprecedented visit by Defense Minister Hans Apel to Asia - the economic underpinnings of that role looked threatened."

And, from the ominous evidence along roadsides and stone walls, it is going to be a bumper year for poison ivy. The vines and their triple leaves are bigger than they have been for years and the stems are thick with deadly sap. Poison ivy, or Rhus radicans, is a peculiarly American problem. It does not grow naturally on any continent but ours. Early European naturalists who came collecting plants were fascinated by it and sent carefully-wrapped specimens of this new-world wonder back home to their patrons. (A Swede named Kalm, around 1750, told of his assistant who, like generations of fools after him, said he could handle the stuff, pulled up plants by the dozens and wound up bedecked with itching blisters.) A botanist visiting Russia not long ago was proudly shown a carefully tended century-old plant in a Leningrad arboretum. In England, however, the Royal Horticultural Society warns that Rhus radicans ''should not be planted as a climber on the house.''"

SLEEP HAS HIS HOUSE By Anna Kavan. 182 pp. New York: Michael Kesend Publishing. $11.95. THESE slender volumes by the much-admired English writer ''Anna Kavan'' (the pseudonym of Helen Woods Edmonds, who died in London in 1968 from a heroin overdose) are haunting and obsessive studies of what she calls the ''inexorable self, carried like the superfluous and tiresome piece of luggage which it is impossible to lose.'' Though they vary surprisingly in tone and language - ''Sleep Has His House'' is an assemblage of prose poems, ''Asylum Piece'' is a less unified collection of stories of a frequently abstract nature - they are both compulsive meditations upon the ostensible unfairness of life as it was experienced by a woman whose hatred of the ''real'' world is positively astounding. As Kavan's autobiographical heroine says in the story ''High in the Mountains'' (from Kavan's best-known book, ''Julia and the Bazooka,'' Knopf, 1975): ''I know I've got a death wish. I've never enjoyed my life, I've never liked people. I love the mountains because they are the negation of life. ... Human beings are hateful; I loathe their ugly faces and messy emotions. I'd like to destroy them all. People have always been horrible to me; they've always rejected and betrayed me. Not one of them has ever been kind. Not a single person has even attempted to understand me, to see things from my point of view. ... How can I help hating them all? Sometimes they disgust me so much that I feel I can't go on living among them -that I must escape from the loathsome creatures swarming like maggots all over the earth.''"

The report said there were probably fewer than 100,000 home sales in ''revitalization neighborhoods'' last year out of a total of nearly 4 million. Sales accelerated in 1979, it added, ''and it should be even stronger in the next decade as housing inflation continues and commuting costs and times keep expanding.''"

Since Senator Linda Winikow, the sponsor of ''equal distribution,'' and I both represent Westchester, the county has become the center of the battle between the forces of ''equal'' and ''equitable'' in the state. Several articles have appeared in this paper and in other media that have misrepresented many of the facts relating to my ''equitable distribution'' legislation. After a divorce, property would be divided equitably according to a list of criteria that includes the duration of the marriage, age and health of both parties and contributions and services as a spouse, parent, wage-earner and homemaker. The court is charged with setting forth the factors it considered and the reasons for its decision. The Burrows-Barclay bill has broad sponsorship in the Legislature and is supported by the Office of Court Administration as well as by all of the Bar Associations."

The $2.5 million, 50,000-square-foot building, at 107 West Fourth Street, three blocks away from the old center on South Seventh Avenue, will serve as the 7-year-old center's permanent headquarters. The threestory, red-brick facility is the largest of four such health centers in Westchester that receive funds from the county and get some of their staff from it but maintain their independence. The other three are in Greenburgh, Peekskill and Ossining."

This isn't many, considering the number of Italian-Americans in town and in the state; still, it is cause for some celebration to find a really good one. One of New Haven's better choices is Delmonaco's, which manages to please both the eye and the palate. This is certainly one of the prettiest restaurants we have visited lately. Its interior has a Mediterranean coolness, with Roman arches, alcoves, white stucco walls, low ceilings, a richness of tropical plants and fresh flowers on each table."

Men and women with advanced degrees in business, law and engineering are moving into the work force at salaries of $20,000 and often much more, while those with no more than a bachelor's degree usually start with half as much. For a couple of years, some employment experts have been predicting that the nation's business schools would soon saturate the market, putting a squeeze on salaries. So far, though, there are few signs of that, at least at the established schools. Demand for new masters of business administration is still outrunning supply, said William Lyhne, assistant director of Executive Compensation Services, a unit of the American Management Association. ''There'll never be a glut of M.B.A.'s,'' he said."

1980-06-01T00:00:00Z,"by John Wang The proposal made last month by the Chinese National People's Congress, the nominal national legislature, to delete the ''four big democratic rights'' from the nation's Constitution has suggested to some in the West that the Chinese Government, after a period of liberalization, is once again curtailing freedom of expression. However, I believe Americans have viewed this change only through eyes used to judging political events against their own history and, in this case, have gathered a mistaken impression. These rights - the right to speak out freely, to air views fully, to hold debates, and to write big-character posters - carry quite a different connotation for the Chinese than the free-speech, freepress and freedom-of-assembly clauses in the Bill of Rights do for us."

''He didn't make a sound as I went past him, and I was running fast because I was training for a marathon,'' she recalled the other day. ''But when I had gone about 30 feet,'' she continued, ''there it was - the moment of recognition that this was it. He came bounding after me, grabbed me by my shorts and tugged at my undergarments. I tried to hit him with my elbow, but he avoided that completely. Then I lifted my hand to hit him and screamed and he let me go and disappeared into the bushes.''"

Binaisa told him that at least $3 billion in foreign aid was needed to rebuild the economy, which had been ''totally devastated'' by civil war and the chaos of Idi Amin's dictatorship. Coffee production, the national mainstay, was a shambles, and sugar, another foreign exchange earner, lay rotting in warehouses because trucks and roads were not functioning. Between 1971 and 1979 -the Amin years - production of the key export crops, tea, coffee, sugar and cotton, fell 51 percent, the European Economic Commission reported. After President Amin expelled 75,000 Asians in the early 1970's, production of sugar, an Asian-controlled industry, dropped. Sugar refineries still are working at less than 30 percent of capacity. Mr. Binaisa tried to woo back Asian entrepreneurs such as the Madhvani family, but they have been been hesitant."

1980-06-01T00:00:00Z,"The most graceful exit from the stage of rock and roll is a quick one. Old age - even middle age - is often a source of embarrassment in a music that is primarily the province of the young. Buddy Holly, who recorded all his important music in a scant twoand-a-half years before dying in a 1959 plane crash at an even younger age than Keats, was recently celebrated in a hagiographical film. But there is little reverence in rock and roll for long-lived Wordsworths. Last year, Chuck Berry, one of rock's founding fathers and now nearing 50, recorded a superb album, ''Rockit,'' full of wistful and witty reflections on racism in America and his own decline in popularity. ''Rockit,'' however, received almost as little attention as Mr. Berry's subsequent imprisonment for incometax evasion."

Once the only choice for American autophiles, it was eclipsed in the 1950's and 1960's, the era of two-tone and even three-tone cars. But enough was enough, apparently, and black is back. ''We have seen a resurgence of black in both trucks and cars of all sizes,'' said George Moon, executive designer for the General Motors Corporation. ''I think it's somewhat an awareness of elegance and a feeling that a car looks more sophisticated - it's more of a machine.'' Black began to reappear around 1977, Mr. Moon said, when G.M. introduced its first group of ''more tailored, more pristine'' downsized cars."

1980-06-01T00:00:00Z,"TIME OF DESECRATION By Alberto Moravia. Translated by Angus Davidson. 376 pp. New York: Farrar, Straus & Giroux. $12.95. ''TIME OF DESECRATION,'' Alberto Moravia's 21st volume of fiction, is an odd and intriguing experiment in using the erotic novel as an instrument for the scrutiny of political behavior. Though occasional allusions are made to the ideal of revolution, though Marx is once actually discussed by two of the characters, scarcely anything happens in the novel that is not explicitly, claustrophobically, steamily sexual. The effect of the book, however, is quite the reverse of the conventional erotic novel. There is nothing rousing or arousing about the relentless sequence of sexual scenes: Sex for the female protagonist is alternately a sordid means to an end and a ghastly trap; and her flat-toned narration of her erotic experiences ''defamiliarizes'' them by allowing no other feelings toward them to emerge."

Of the other 15 pairs, 13 were using rigid one-club systems, in which, in varying degree, the bidding follows a predetermined track. The extreme wing, representing the ultimate in master-and-slave bidding, was the Central American team, in which two pairs used different ''relay'' methods. Jeff Hand and John Maduro used a homemade ''Panama Relay,'' while Alberto Calvo, another Panama expert, and Alberto Dhers of Venezuela used ''Precision Relay,'' the brainchild of Bob Danielson of Hackensack, N.J.

Your task is to name those cards and only those cards you would need to unmask in order to find whether the test sentence is true or false for the four cards.

One thing it seems to refer to is the widely felt need to untangle haphazard, inconsistent Government policies that impede productivity and reduce American competitiveness abroad.

The man is talented, and his talent is tailor-made for American pop radio. Although he comes from Austin, Tex., where he assembled his fine band, Mr. Cross doesn't play on his country-western roots. His songs suggest influences from artists who have grafted jazz and Broadway harmonies onto rock and funk rhythms - Steely Dan, for example, or Mr. Cross's fellow Texan, Boz Scaggs. One hopes he'll grow as a lyricist, but as a melodist he shines, and his arrangements betray a pop craftsmanship that's already mature. Mr. Cross's singing voice is high and a little plaintive - at times it sounds like a bluegrass voice. Best of all, he's an economical, incisive guitar soloist who gets a lovely fat tone from his Stratocaster, has plenty of good ideas and never overplays."

The new model is not an isolated phenomenon, like a corporate headquarters reaching conspicuously for the sky, or a World Trade Center, setting a record in the tallest-building derby. The new kind, bigger and bulkier than anything the city has seen before, arises because of skyrocketing building costs, and there is nothing to stop it, certainly not New York's permissive zoning practices. Massed together in midtown, the resulting superbuildings will make the city's familiar concrete canyons seem intimate. Sixteen of these huge buildings are already in construction or in advanced planning within a concentrated midtown area. They will all be highly profitable and generate business. But their collective scale raises serious concerns about density, pedestrian mobility and air, sun and shadow patterns, and eventual structural gridlock. Even their economic benefits will be overconcentrated, while other areas in need of development go begging."

The proposal, which could radically change the state's tax base, is fathered by Howard Jarvis, who co-authored Proposition 13. Adopted by the voters in 1978, that measure drastically cut property taxes and gave rise to similar laws in at least 10 other states. It was followed in 1979 by Proposition 4, limiting state and local spending. According to the best estimates, if Proposition 9 passes, localgovernment revenues will be cut by 7 to 10 percent at most. But far larger cuts - say, 15 to 25 percent - are well within the capacity of local governments, in California and in other states, to absorb. In fact, the quality of public services could actually increase if municipalities made intelligent changes in response to such tax cuts."

He had never been to Glasgow, but this was still a trip Davis would rather not make. If circumstances were different - if Davis held the World Boxing Council lightweight championship - he might not have to sit through a flight to London and another to Glasgow, where he will fight against Jim Watt of Scotland on Saturday. Davis might not have to bring over his own cook, as he planned for this trip, or deal with unfamiliar sparring partners. One day, he hopes, the limousine will take him to Nassau Coliseum, or maybe Madison Square Garden."

But it is changing. There are new doubts, mostly just below the surface. They stem from the visible facts of change in world power. It is common now for the French to speak of their country as a ''middle power,'' and even, when they are worried, as a ''small part of the European peninsula.'' While the European Community has developed a greater capacity than ever to work out joint political declarations, there is also greater awareness of how far it is from the consolidation that would bring weight in the world equal to the sum of its parts in population, economics, technology."

The report can only increase the confusion of health-conscious eaters bombarded with conflicting counsel. Some of the report's views are widely accepted: use salt in moderation to reduce the risk of hypertension; keep your weight under control by eating less and exercising more. But its conclusions on fat and cholesterol run counter to the advice of at least 18 major health organizations and the Federal Government. The academy found no reason for the average healthy American to eat less fat, saturated fat or cholesterol to reduce the risk of heart disease. It acknowledged that epidemiological, or population, studies show some correlation between their consumption and cardiovascular disease, but held that could be coincidental rather than cause and effect. The evidence that altering the diet can actually reduce heart disease is unimpressive, the academy said, and it may even be risky."

On Sunday morning, big advertisements in the Sunday supplements proclaimed the impending arrival of ''Camelot'' on Broadway, listing Kathleen McKearney as starring with Richard Burton, the only actor whose name was in larger type. By Sunday evening all that had changed. Miss McKearney had been told by the producers she was being let go from the lavish musical, which is to open here on July 2. For the little-known Miss McKearney, it would have been her Broadway debut. Instead, Christine Ebersole, who until Sunday's matinee was playing the part of Ado Annie in the Broadway revival of ''Oklahoma!,'' was chosen to take over the role of Guenevere, the part created on Broadway by Julie Andrews when ''Camelot'' first opened here in 1960."
1980-06-03T00:00:00Z,"Your article ''Lead Persists as Threat to Young'' (May 13) was a much needed reminder of the hazards of lead in children. Public consciousness of the ravages of this ubiquitous metal among urban youngsters seems to have slackened in the last decade, as the enthusiasm of governmental involvement in the 1960's waned. While resurgence of concern for the multiple sources of lead absorption in the young is important, the lack of attention to the dangers of lead poisoning in their parents remains sadly ironic. Lead poisoning in adults has received little notice in the press, including the Times's article. Yet, in this country, there are over a million workers exposed to lead in a variety of occupations, including soldering and paint removing. There are perhaps tens of thousands of cases of unrecognized kidney disease due to lead among these men. Ought not our concern for children extend to their families? Our government spends close to a billion dollars annually for artificial kidney treatments of end-stage kidney disease; virtually nothing is invested toward the prevention or treatment of lead damage to the kidneys of our adult population."

The contention Mr. Koch sought to make was that unless the city got the state aid by June 30, when the current fiscal year ends, it would not be able to afford a key part of its proposed contract with its workers. To a large degree, though, the medium was the message."

But there can be no argument about the binding effect of the judgment which the court rendered on May 24. n 1951, when Mossadegh - not the Shah - was the dominant political figure in Iran and brought about the nationalization of the oil industry, the International Court of Justice, on the application of Great Britain, issued an order for interim measures of protection. When Iran refused to comply, Great Britain appealed to the United Nations Security Council under Article 94 of the Charter. The Iranian representative, Allahyar Saleh, argued that an interim order was not binding but admitted that ''the final judgment'' of the Court is binding."

Only fanatics will claim ''credit'' for acts that create martyrs and cry out for vengeance. Too many on both sides are already scarred by hate, ready to murder and to maim, and to make sure that violence will never end the violence. But only the blind among the leaders of both peoples will deny that diplomacy is collapsing yet again into war. The swiftest prosecution of the bomb throwers on both sides will not validate Israel's endless occupation of Palestinians or the Palestinians' refusal to negotiate with Israel. The policies of both are untenable, and while they may not explicitly invite the terror, they make it impossible to contain."
1980-06-03T00:00:00Z,"ONE of the quirks shared by a good many scientists is a love for sage nonsense. Maybe a need for relief from intense cerebral labor breeds a taste for the outrageous non sequitur, the impossible perspective, the logical incongruity. Or maybe occasional eccentricities in the casual speech and writing of some scientists stem from their terrible difficulty in communicating hard ideas to others. Even answering questions like ''What do you do for a living?'' can challenge the wit. For whatever reason, scientists fall into the habit of speaking and writing in metaphor and allegory, often drawing from the art and literature of whimsy."

The business has been operated illegally since its beginning early in this century. Now, however, the state government has decided to compete with the illegal game by offering its own legal version of numbers betting in which players will pick a number from 000 to 999 in hopes of a 500-to-1 payoff on a minimum $1 bet, beginning Sept. 1. This legislation, approved in April, will not significantly benefit our state financially and will polarize further the economic and class divisions in our cities. Rather than establish a competing numbers game, New York State should issue franchises to operate the new legal game to those operating the illegal game. Amnesty would have to be granted for all past numbers violations. This franchise proposal has been wholly endorsed by a wide range of business, political, community and religious leaders throughout the state with whom I have discussed it."

1980-06-03T00:00:00Z,"IN ''Blood Wedding,'' that tragic tale of a peasant wedding, Federico Garcia Lorca created a darkly symbolic landscape dominated, as ever, by the twin obsessions of his imagination - passion and death. Employing verse and music and spectacle, it is more tableau than drama, more surrealistic parable than conventional narrative. As a result, it is a work that needs strong acting, and an even stronger directorial vision -qualities only partly realized in Maria Irene Fornes's new English adaptation now playing at Intar. The play is about fate, and the story, such as it is, seems simple enough: The bride (Brenda Feliciano), who is still in love with her old flame, Leonardo (Emil Herrera), dutifully goes off to wed her intended (Felipe Gorostiza), but after the ceremony meets her former lover and flees with him across the Spanish countryside. There the two men defend their honor in a knife duel. As the Mother - played with splendid and outsized emotion by Antonia Rey -predicts in the opening scene, there is but one outcome: the men must die and the women are all left to weep."

Members of Congress with weapons plants in their regions inevitably find procurement there inadequate. The military chiefs usually want more than the sitting Administration. And the public, even if it sees a need for more spending, is left confused about how to do it well. The confusion has been worse than usual this year. President Carter finally settled for an annual increase of between 4 and 5 percent for the next five years. The Joint Chiefs first supported him, then supported members of Congress who favor even more, then showed some doubt about the way the Congressmen wanted to spend the added funds. Meanwhile, the House, facing re-election, voted twice to raise defense spending and twice to lower it, thus recording itself in favor of both a stronger defense and a balanced budget."

But aside from an eye-catching memo pad whose printed salutation cannot be quoted here, such a plumber, upon reaching the inner sanctum, would find nothing of strategic value unless Tim Kraft happened to be at his desk and agreed to a quiet chat about his life, which is to say, about politics."
1980-06-03T00:00:00Z,"THE opening season of the Brooklyn Academy of Music Theater Company has come to a smashing finale with ''The Marriage Dance,'' a duet of one-act farces by Bertolt Brecht and Georges Feydeau. And when I say smashing, I'm speaking both figuratively and literally. Brecht's ''The Wedding'' and Feydeau's ''The Purging'' are not only screamingly funny, but they also unleash as much physical havoc as one might hope to find in a civilized theater. In ''The Wedding,'' the guests at a nuptial feast slowly but surely destroy a living room chair by chair, limb by limb. In ''The Purging,'' an elegant Parisian study gradually becomes a sea of smashed porcelain chamber pots. Faint-of-heart theatergoers would be advised not to sit too close to the stage. As always, the Brooklyn company is calling our attention to plays that are rarely seen in New York. On this occasion, David Jones, the group's adventurous artistic director, has come up with two small but perfect gems written more than half a century ago. Both farces are models of craftsmanship that echo the major works of their authors. Both are presented in contemporary, but not gratuitously trendy translations. Andre Ernotte, the director of the evening, has lovingly recreated the high style of classic farce, and he has gotten the most out of a generally fine, if uneven, acting troupe. He has also solved the tricky problems of the Brooklyn Academy of Music's ungainly Lepercq Space by setting a proscenium stage down in the middle of the theater and seating the audience on either side."

Nine months later, the future of the bill - called the Capital Cost Recovery Act - is uncertain. Passage of the measure, cosponsored by Representatives Barber B. Conable Jr., the upstate New York Republican who is the ranking minority member on the House Ways and Means Committee, and James R. Jones, Democrat of Oklahoma, depends on whether there is an election-year tax cut.

But the contraption was not of the flying variety. It was an air-powered automobile. Terry Miller of Crestline, Kan., the inventor of the vehicle, said it cost about 2 cents a mile to run, was powered by compressed air, and could cruise at 29 miles an hour, though not for very long. Mr. Miller is still awaiting a patent on the valve his car uses."

1980-06-03T00:00:00Z,"THE title character in ''The Outsider'' is an American veteran who goes to Belfast to fight for the Irish Republican Army, and in some ways his story is the weakest part of this otherwise compelling movie. The reasons that Michael (Craig Wasson) travels from Detroit to Ireland are trumped-up to a certain degree, and so is a love story that aims to make his sojourn more interesting. And Michael's feelings about his grandfather (Sterling Hayden), which are supposedly at the heart of the matter, also seem tangential to the film's larger concerns. But ''The Outsider'' is vivid even if it isn't much of a character study, and energetic even though it's often clumsy. War-torn Belfast makes for a tremendously effective dramatic backdrop. And Tony Luraschi, who directed the film and adapted its screenplay from Colin Leinster's novel, creates a sense of authenticity that outweighs the shortcomings of the story line."

Last Friday, the Treasury announced in the morning that it wanted to borrow $2 billion and get the cash that afternoon - the fastest financing that Treasury securities dealers could remember. The preceding speed record was set in April 1979, during another Congressional squabble over the national debt ceiling, when the Treasury announced three bill auctions early one evening and sold some the next morning."

1980-06-03T00:00:00Z,"Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher today accepted a plan for settlement of Britain's budget dispute with its Common Market partners, which had threatened ultimately to enfeeble and perhaps even destroy the West European economic alliance. In the view of many experts, it was the worst crisis in the 25-year history of the European Economic Community, as the Common Market is formally known. The argument revolved around seemingly arcane considerations such as net contributions to the costs of running the community, the free movement of lamb and mutton among countries, and the size of agricultural subsidies. But it went to the heart of the political relationships in Western Europe."

1980-06-03T00:00:00Z,"Q. Why do birds fly in V-shaped formations? A. ''V'' formations are generally observed during migration seasons, but scientists are not sure just why birds travel in that pattern. Some ornithologists suggest that a V-shaped flight is more efficient aerodynamically, minimizing the air friction for each bird as it flies in its neighbor's slipstream. However, studies of geese show that the angle variations in different flights are so frequent and great that any aerodynamic advantage is negated. Pelicans and ibises are also frequent V-formation fliers; however, very few other species actually fly in V formations. Q. What is ionizing radiation?"

Usually these affairs are just part of the racing routine, like a baseball manager's protest of an umpire's call. The hearing is conducted in an office, and the commissioners decide, with no great sweat, whether to uphold or reverse the judgment of their appointed judges. Much more often than not, the stewards are upheld."

But the effort apparently failed, and the Coast Guard said early today that the ship was expected to dock this morning, and that her master and crew would be arrested. Yesterday evening Atlee Wampler 3d, the United States Attorney here, said that the Federal authorities were using ''our best efforts'' to prevent the ship from landing in Key West. Mr. Wampler declined to describe the efforts, but said that if they were unsuccessful, the ship would be impounded and its owners and crew subject to arrest on felony charges of smuggling aliens."

Two thoughts come to mind: First, the campaigns are too long, and second they are too expensive.v.e are subjected to an overdose of electioneering which is unnecessary and at best of dubious value. Our Congress made it possible by legislating the Primary Matching Fund, Chapter 26 of Title 26. Matching funds come from taxes that hard-working Americans must pay."

The Phillies, who dropped three games behind the first-place Pirates in the National League's Eastern Division, held a 3-2 lead through four innings.

1980-06-03T00:00:00Z,"HEINRICH ISAAC (c. 1470-1517) is generally regarded as one of the giants of Renaissance music, a Flemish composer who wrote prolifically and masterly in virtually every musical form of his era. If he is performed at all today, it is usually his secular works that receive attention, while his massive body of sacred music goes unheard. The Cappella Nova took steps to rectify this situation at its concert in St. Joseph's Church on Sunday night, offering the complete ''Missa de Confessoribus'' as well as a number of motets. Many of the motets are still unpublished, and they were transcribed by the group's director, Richard Taruskin. It was a lovely evening of music and very likely a revelation even for specialists - one could easily hear why Isaac was considered a precious adornment at the Medici court in Florence and later at the court of Emperor Maximilian I. The program presented the Mass, a late work, in sectional blocks framed by a number of motets drawn from all phases of Isaac's career, giving a very full picture of his extraordinary technical and inventive powers."

1980-06-03T00:00:00Z,"International Attacks on three Palestinian mayors injured 10 persons, including two of the mayors and seven other Arabs. Israeli officials suspected Jewish extremists of responsibility for the carefully coordinated bombing attacks, focused on the leading nationalist mayors in the West Bank. (Page A1, Column 6.) Major firebombings in South Africa may lead to stiff Government retaliation against a banned black nationalist group that took responsibility for the attacks on one of the country's largest oil refineries and two synthetic petroleum plants. The attacks caused huge fires at two plants and estimated damage of nearly $8 million. (A1:4-5.) American ''intervention in Iran'' is the subject of a conference that opened in Teheran. The conferees include a 10-member United States group led by former Attorney General Ramsey Clark attending in defiance of President Carter's ban on travel to Iran. (A1:2.) A Common Market crisis was resolved as Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher accepted a compromise plan for settlement of Britain's funding dispute with its eight partners. Under the plan, Britain agreed to increased farm prices in return for a reduction in its contribution to the group's budget. (A1:3.) Italy's Prime Minister faced pressure to resign in an attempt to avert an impeachment-like procedure against him. The Communists vowed to collect the signatures needed to bring about a full-scale parliamentary inquiry into allegations that Prime Minister Francesco Cossiga revealed secret Government information to enable the son of a fellow Christian Democrat to escape arrest as a terrorist suspect. (A3:3-6.) Indira Gandhi's party easily won eight of the nine states that elected new governments last week, final results showed. Her party has won back the crucial Hindi-speaking heartland, but about half of India's 22 states are still controlled by the opposition. (A3:1-2.) National Rioting by Cuban refugees Sunday at Fort Chaffee, Ark., led the Government to send about 300 Army troops there and to tighten security after the revolt over long processing delays. The Governor of Arkansas said that up to 2,000 National Guardsmen would be available to maintain calm after the insurrection that left 40 persons, most of them Cubans, injured, four buildings burned to the ground and 35 persons under arrest. (A1:1.) A big freighter carrying 850 Cubans was reported heading for Florida and the Justice Department said it was trying to turn the ship back to Cuba. A Federal prosecutor said that if the efforts failed, the ship would be impounded and its owners and crew would face felony charges. (B11:5-6.) Edward M. Kennedy campaigned coast to coast on the day before final primary challenges against President Carter. With 580 delegates at stake in New Jersey, Ohio and California and 116 more in five other states, the President was secure in his expectation that no matter how many primaries Senator Kennedy would win today, Mr. Carter would still have substantially more delegates than he needs. (A1:4.) A church suffered a legal setback as the Supreme Court declined to bar a state investigation of its finances. California courts have ordered officials of the Worldwide Church of God to surrender thousands of documents that the state says it needs for its inquiry into allegations that leaders of the church were squandering its funds. (A16:1-4.) The Vernon E. Jordan shooting inquiry was pressed by Federal agents, who questioned the woman who was with the civil rights leader when he was severely wounded Thursday. Her attorney said that she had previously given ample details of the shooting to the police and that she had no involvement in the attack. (A14:1.) Concern over powerful drugs frequently used to treat anxiety and depression is intensifying. The drugs, called neuroleptics, have revolutionized the practice of psychiatry and facilitated the release of hundreds of thousands of patients from mental hospitals, but they are under growing attack as their alleged misapplications multiply and their disabling side effects persist. (C1:5-6.) Metropolitan City property-tax policies were upheld by a State Supreme Court justice in a ruling that New York City officials said could nullify nearly 125,000 similar challenges and save the city up to $1.3 billion. The justice affirmed the city's right to tax commercial and income-producing property at a rate different from other properties. (A1:1-3.) New York City is the biggest lobbyist in Albany, according to a state report. It said that the city and its semi-independent agencies spent $279,860 to lobby before the State Legislature and state commissions last year, more than any private or public organization. The city's chief lobbyist called the efforts ''very cost effective.'' (B1:6.) Plans for a higher transit fare were being expedited. The Metropolitan Transportation Authority, which began public hearings on a possible increase in fares on New York City subways and buses, disclosed it had already begun modifying subway turnstiles to accept new, more expensive tokens. (B3:2-4.) A halt in the Goldman Band concerts that have provided free, outdoor entertainment for New York audiences for 62 summers was disclosed. The foundation that has been the financial mainstay of the concerts has discontinued its support, citing sharply rising costs, and the ensemble has been unable to get alternative funding. (B1:1-2.)

For, you see, the concert was performed in the relative peace of Carnegie Hall, in celebration of the diamond anniversary of these free programs, rather than in the bandshell on Central Park Mall. Bargain-conscious New Yorkers have soaked up free music in the park, courtesy of the Naumburg family, without interruption since 1905. Oh, there was one reminder of the concerts' time-honored venue: someone apparently had brought an infant into the hall, and faint yelps and squeals could be heard intermittently during the first half of the program. However, the night went smoothly otherwise, to the obvious delight of a large audience that seemed about equally divided between the young and the elderly."

As the Mets begin the fifth month of their new regime and the third of their regular season, the recent improvement in their report card is being explained in many ways: the hot hitting of Frank Taveras, the relief pitching of Neil Allen and Jeff Reardon, the maturing of everybody else, the tenacity of Manager Joe Torre."

1980-06-03T00:00:00Z,"Last month, members of the venerable University Club in Albany rejected a proposal to extend full membership to women. Last week, four judges of the New York Court of Appeals resigned from the club in protest. They made their point in just the right way. In theory, private clubs may be extensions of a person's home, and therefore thoroughly private places. But in practice, as in the Albany case, they are often extensions of the marketplace and world of affairs. The current effort in many places to strike down barriers against blacks, Jews, women and others is not just an effort by once excluded groups to find new company where they aren't wanted. It is an effort to throw open the meeting grounds of business and politics, and to eliminate, once and for all, barriers that are unquestionably rooted in discrimination. Clubs that prefer one member to another are indeed selective. Clubs that bar all women or blacks are usually discriminatory."

There is a tendency, in thinking about a program that includes the familiar and the not so familiar, to dwell upon the latter, if only because of its relative novelty.

Mr. Slatkin counts as one of America's finest young conductors; he currently heads the St.Louis Symphony.

National President Carter won enough delegates in the final eight state primaries to secure the majority needed for renomination at the Democratic National Convention in August. Senator Edward M.

1980-06-04T00:00:00Z,"THE letter sounded plaintive: ''Why doesn't anyone write on how impossible it is for anthropology majors to find jobs?'' Like so many other liberal arts majors, the letter writer apparently has a problem. Unlike those in engineering, pure science, business and a few other specialties, liberal arts gradutes often have great difficulty finding jobs. Many have to compromise and work in different fields - retailing, banking, publishing, advertising, the brokerage business - where a broad major like anthropology, English, or languages might be useful. An alternative for the anthropology major is to obtain a graduate degree in public health, social work or a related field. Another approach is to have a medical subspecialty."

Should they continue their fight against Jimmy Carter and Ronald Reagan, the clear winners in the primaries, struggling on against almost hopeless odds into the summer nominating conventions and the final vote in November? A hard question; both are arguing for the unity of the nation, and running against Carter and Reagan because they don't believe either can unify his own party let alone the nation.

The theater was purchased in January 1979 for $225,000 by Original Ballets Foundation Inc., an affiliate of the Eliot Feld Ballet, with a view to creating a theater suited in size, facilities and rental costs to middle-size modern-dance and ballet companies, many of which are hard-pressed to support the costs of a season at established New York theaters. The Elgin Theater, built in the early 1930's as a movie house, would be remodeled into a 500-seat dance theater with an enlarged stage and facilities and new lighting and sound equipment, designed by the architectural firm of Hardy Holzman Pfeiffer Associates.

While the design of a mold should be appropriate to the food it contains, most molds are versatile and can be used interchangeably for ice cream, aspics or mousses. However, a tall, narrow bombe glacee would not be appropriate for aspic, which would collapse under its own weight. Metal molds are preferred by many cooks because they cool evenly and quickly and release their contents easily. Porcelain and ceramic molds are more difficult to handle.

A small band of wine makers in the rolling hills of northwestern Oregon are proving the bettors wrong. Some of the best pinot noirs in the nation are being made here in the Red Hills above the Willamette Valley, confirming that the Burgundy country of France is not the only place where this stubborn grape can be cultivated successfully."

AS always when it comes to discussing the late novelist, an air of cultism suffuses this ''Tribute'' to Vladimir Nabokov, edited by the English biographer Peter Quennell. The point is repeatedly made in its various essays that not every reader will measure up to the demands of Nabokov's texts. We are informed that only the unwitting will read ''Lolita'' as a morality play or as a satire on American vulgarity. We are told that only a superficial reader of ''The Defense'' will think that just because its hero, Luzhin, has leaped out the bathroom window at the end, he is actually falling to his death. Nabokov's oeuvre is an obstacle course of traps for the unwary reader, we are given to know. Those who can measure up are welcome to the club of his readers. The Philistine and sentimental - the readers who foolishly imagine that his characters have a life beyond the words on the page - simply need not apply."

However, as soon as the family leaves the stage, Miss King lifts her skirts almost to her knees and belts out a melodic gust of audacity suitably entitled ''I've Still Got My Bite.'' She has bite and bluster and the soul of a vaudevillian. Having banished any thought that she is aged or infirmed, Miss King gives us a knowing twinkle and retreats behind her Granny glasses. The singer and the song deserve the ovation."

But the shows, with the WRVR-FM disk jockey Roger Dawson playing host, are already attracting a large and loyal audience and threaten to become a Monday night institution. The most recent Monday evening found Billy Harper, a formidable tenor saxophonist, sitting in with the orchestras of Tito Puente and Bobby Rodriguez, and the music was consistently inspiring. Strong rhythm sections bring out the best in Mr. Harper, who has been heard with Max Roach and Gil Evans as well as with his own groups. During the portion of his first set with Mr. Puente that the reviewer heard, he played ingenious thematic variations, expertly weaving his hard sound into the Puente band's polished ensembles. But the real treat was the hotter, looser session with Bobby Rodriguez that followed. A long, steaming vamp brought some of the most impassioned playing this listener has ever heard from Mr. Harper, and on ''Tea for Two'' he played cleverly with the melody before he entered into a round of exchanges with Mr. Rodriguez, who also plays tenor saxophone."

The genteel ladies' luncheon room, with its cafeteria-style trays, institutional cooking and weak coffee, is becoming obsolete. Instead, gleaming espresso bars, ice-cream parlors, industrious health food counters, wine cellars and even an aspiring French restaurant are drawing not only shoppers, but tourists, local residents and business people."

Miss Nichols brings a sense of classical phrasing to her work that is rare in dancers of her generation, and ''Tchaikovsky Pas de Deux'' gives her a formal classical framework within which to expand. Dressed in a handsome new costume, Mr. Luders surged authoritatively through his solo, a model of lyricism, neat finishes and sympathetic partnering."

1980-06-04T00:00:00Z,"One of the accepted truths of the 1970's was that great stretches of the ''inner cities'' were doomed. The poor people still living in them were regarded as helpless or criminal and, in any case, imminent casualties of the abandonment plague. Terms like ''South Bronx'' became generic usages, as in ''It looks like the South Bronx.'' And yet, in one city after another, some inner-city neighborhoods are stubbornly staying alive. These are not polished-brass restoration areas, with snob appeal, though there are many of those. Neither are these rare showpiece projects like Bedford-Stuyvesant Restoration in Brooklyn. They are poor or working-class neighborhoods that have hung on, revived and even prospered to an extent that cannot be explained just by a flow of Federal urban aid dollars. The larger explanation is self-help."

While I suspect you will get a bevy of positive responses from bewildered, anxious, irritated stepparents, I forward a dissenting note about what is yet another in a glut of media attention to an overworked topic. If you must assault us again with the travails of dealing with the ex-wife, the rejection of our cooking, and the agony of establishing relationships with the children - I suggest some fresh approach, and a less ''cutesy'' tone."

Whether she was eating lunch at a Swiss ski resort with Cary Grant or driving along the French Riviera in a Mercedes 300 with Albert Finney or just taking breakfast at Tiffany's, she seemed to lead a perfect life of charm and grace. Last week, Audrey Hepburn was back in New York, completing another movie, a comedy written and directed by Peter Bogdanovich, and she was sitting in the Cafe Pierre, eating mint chocolates and macaroons. It was an appropriate setting - the dusky pink walls reflected the glow of candles and musicians played a sarabande.

I am not troubled that elected officials, community representatives, and union officials have disagreed with the decision. After all, as a member of Congress I opposed hospital closings in my district. What does trouble me is the intensity and divisiveness of the rhetoric. I have been accused of ''genocide,'' likened to Eugene ''Bull'' Connor, the late Police Commissioner of Birmingham, Ala., and charged with abandoning one of the most medically underserved areas in the country. I believe any fair review of my administration's decision would reach a very different conclusion, that it would show the closing of Sydenham to be in the best interests of changing the way the city delivers health care. New York City operates 17 of the country's 27 municipal hospitals, and it contributes over $400 million to cover the Health and Hospital Corporation's deficit, not including what it contributes in Medicaid payments. I am proud of this system. I also believe that it needs reform - that there are too few neighborhood clinics, that some of its hospitals do not provide the quality care New Yorkers deserve, that an excess of beds (there are nearly 2,000 empty beds in municipal hospitals every night) wastes resources that should be directed at real needs. The recommendation to close Sydenham had been made by past administrations but never carried out because of community opposition."

Both Miss Kristhea and Mr. Tucker dispatched everything with crisp, professional efficiency, and Marshall Williamson proved to be an alert, flexible accompanist at the piano. Still, it would take a pair of very sophisticated singers with an abundance of style and vocal technique to do justice to a program of such far-reaching scope, and in this respect the results turned out to be rather flat."

1980-06-04T00:00:00Z,"THE American Ballet Theater gave Antony Tudor's ''The Tiller in the Fields'' and Glen Tetley's ''Sphinx'' their first performances of the season Monday night at the Metropolitan Opera House. Both are recent works but, surprisingly, time has already affected them in contrasting ways. Mr. Tudor's ballet (1979) has lost something in edge and possibly conviction, while Mr. Tetley's view of the Oedipus and Sphinx legend (1978) has gained in the expressiveness it promised but did not totally deliver previously. The kind of performance each ballet received can help explain some of these effects, and ''Sphinx'' was superbly danced by Martine van Hamel, Kirk Peterson, and - returning as a guest in his original role - Clark Tippett.

It faces those who pay $3.76 per month for the New York Telephone Company's Call Waiting service, which enables more than 200,000 city subscribers to receive more than one call on the same line. How to cope with the ensuing complications? Say you're talking on the phone, and another call comes in. Which call do you take? And how do you ditch the caller you don't want? To resolve this contemporary crisis, Metropolitan Diary turned to Michael Korda for wise counsel. Mr. Korda is, of course, the author of ''Power,'' ''Success'' and, most recently, ''Charmed Lives.'' To Mr. Korda, the call-waiting problem is but a simpler subspecies of the great hold-button quandary:"

1980-06-04T00:00:00Z,"That small uprising by about 300 Cuban refugees at Fort Chaffee, Ark., elicited two public responses. Mostly there was outrage: Ship them back to Cuba! Occasionally, there was a sympathetic question: Why can't the Government process these people faster? These responses aren't necessarily at odds. More than 80 people, some of whom presumably started the disturbance, have been thrown into the stockade. For a while, at least, that is where they belong. The sort of ''impatience'' that makes people burn down rescue centers and stone their rescuers deserves no sympathy whatever."

The departure of thousands of Cubans to the United States is above all a reflection of this difficulty. While the United States news media have seized upon the refugees as proof of the ''failure'' of Cuban socialism, the recent pro-Castro demonstrations by millions in Havana indicate that the revolution is still very much alive and continues to evoke widespread enthusiasm and support."

1980-06-04T00:00:00Z,"SKETCHBOOK'' was the title of one of the works presented at the Dances by Albert Reid program Monday night at the Merce Cunningham Studio. But Mr. Reid could also have given the title to his concert as a whole because his dances were choreographic sketches composed of wisps and squiggles of movement that, at their best, had the directness and spontaneity of first impressions. Ellen van Schuylenburch and Mr. Reid raced and ran and breezed their way through ''Blue Room,'' to an arrangement of Richard Rodgers's song of the same name. ''Sketchbook,'' a solo for Mr. Reid, went from ambling steps to peculiar wiggles and quivers, and if the movements looked disconnected, that was not really bothersome, because jottings in a sketchbook can often be disconnected. A preoccupation with strange quivering and flickering gestures was also evident in ''Vignettes,'' a trio for Peggy Florin, Jeannette Leentvaar and Mr. Reid. Given its bitsiness, ''Vignettes'' seemed as appropriate a title as ''Sketchbook.''"

Diplomats generally share the frustration of most Americans; they know that governmental kidnapping can immobilize their important work. Most governments, however, have become indifferent, absorbing the Iranian propaganda that America - more precisely, a once haughty America - is the only intended victim.

That's ironic because the rationale for the shift was that free competition would force brokers to cut rates. Brokers do charge institutional clients considerably less than in years past.

1980-06-04T00:00:00Z,"THESE days there is something to be said for world problems that simply simmer. The task of devising common accounting rules for companies throughout the world would rank high on no one's agenda of urgent global issues. Accounting and financial reporting are among the least bellicose of relations across national boundaries. No time bomb is ticking, no sword hangs over the ledgers. No matter what the accountants do, they pose no threat to the planet. It is also true, however, that a fair amount is afoot in international accounting. More and more, governments are getting involved, both supranational, as well as national. The underdeveloped world, for instance, is turning to the United Nations, a friendly forum, to bring ''transnational'' companies under stricter scrutiny. The developing nations are pressing for more attention to matters like transfer pricing, an issue of great moment to them."

1980-06-04T00:00:00Z,"THERE are at least two legitimate ways to listen to a piece such as Martin Bresnick's ''We're Weaving, We're Weaving,'' which had its first performance on Monday night at Carnegie Recital Hall. If you happened to incline toward the old German school of abstract theorists who deplored the very idea of programs or scenarios, you could have heard the work as a fascinating mixture of late Romantic and modern minimalist styles. The opening and closing movements, cast in a densely chromatic idiom, were separated by a long section of humming and buzzing whose chief technical device was the overlaying of short motives on other short motives in such a way that phaseshifts created a disturbing instability and yet a kind of hypnotic tension. Mr. Bresnick, however, seemed to have more on his mind than abstractions, as a brief program note indicated. The piece, performed by the chamber group called Musical Elements, under Daniel Asia's direction, was based on a refrain from Heine's poem, ''Die Schlesichen Weber,'' or ''The Silesian Weavers,'' written out of sympathy for a workers's uprising in 1844. In the poem, according to the notes, ''the weavers ceaselessly weave the fate of their oppressors.''"

Then the other day as I prepared a beef Burgundy in an iron pot glazed with orange enamel, a pot I frequently use for the purpose without giving it much thought, I realized that I may have turned my back on enamelized iron unfairly. So I started to look at the these pots more systematically than I had before. There is no question but that enamelized iron is an important addition to cookware. It distributes heat beautifully, is only moderately expensive and often very good looking. But it also heats slowly, tends to chip and is heavy to work with."

But the President's economic strategy now is nothing more than the late Senator Aiken's for Vietnam: simply announce a victory and quit. No matter how described, the Administration's economic policy remains a failure. The recession now under way was a last-ditch attempt to curb inflation by a President (and Congress) who could think of no better way. It is a disruptive, costly policy that will mean high unemployment and large losses of national wealth."

In some respects, tonight's ''Great Performances'' presentation, beginning at 8 o'clock on WNET-TV, Channel 13, would justify such a reaction. The story of the brave minstrel Tannhauser, torn between his passion for the goddess Venus and his idealized love for the innocent Elisabeth, is almost embalmed in a 19th-century Germanic heaviness typical of legend celebrations. And this production is true to the Wagnerian tradition of being so minimally lighted as to be almost invisible for long stretches, once again buttressing the theory that Wagner is meant to be heard, not seen."

1980-06-05T00:00:00Z,"SUMMER is the slow season on network television, so perhaps that is why the relentless stream of bad news out of NBC these days suggests something more akin to hemorrhaging. Yesterday, the network's beleagured public-relations staff telephoned to say how happy NBC-TV was to announce that it had acquired a new affiliate station, WXIA-TV in Atlanta, previously affiliated with ABC. More affiliates mean more viewers, which means higher advertising rates and larger revenues. What NBC did not announce is that it also lost an affiliate yesterday in Atlanta, WSB-TV, owned by the Cox Broadcasting Corporation, which shifted to ABC. It also happens that WSB, which had been an NBC affiliate since 1948, led the prime-time audiencepopularity ratings last season among Atlanta stations. Indeed, it led in nearly all aspects of its programming, even though it was saddled with an NBC schedule that dragged most other affiliates into last place in their markets."

However, for some time now, about two feet of this sill is bubbly and the varnish is sticky. I don't understand why this is happening in just this one spot. How can I remove the varnish and seal the wood so this won't happen again? -Mrs. H.M., Philadelphia. A. You are not clear as to whether this bubbly or sticky condition was present from the beginning, or whether it developed later. If it never dried, then there was something on or in the wood in that area that prevented the stain from drying properly before the varnish was applied. If it originally dried, and some time passed before the one area bubbled and got sticky, then chances are that something was spilled on the surface to cause the problem."

Then he added: ''Are we dealing here with a racism of moral beauty?'' Although the dispute between Sartre and Camus had nothing to do, ostensibly, with the French resistance to Hitler and Petain during World War II -they were arguing about whether it was permissible to criticize Stalin's gulag - the words resonate. Yes, in fact, we are dealing with ''a racism of moral beauty,'' which is probably the single permissible racism.

1980-06-05T00:00:00Z,Results of a large-scale study show a new drug called nifedipine to be dramatically effective in treating a rare form of angina pectoris and suggest the drug may be valuable for a much broader range of heart patients. Angina is the chest pain that often arises in heart disease when flow of blood to the heart muscle is insufficient for the heart's work load. The patients in the new study all suffer from a rare condition in which spasms of the heart's coronary arteries impair blood circulation to the heart muscle. The drug appears to act directly to quell or prevent the spasms.

1980-06-05T00:00:00Z,"Why have interest rates dropped so far so fast? In March, money-market certificates fetched 15.7 percent, and now their yields have fallen to 8.2 percent. The prime rate, 20 percent as recently as mid-April, has dropped to 13 percent. The headlong plunge in rates, the steepest and most sudden since World War II, has bewildered savers and left analysts groping for an explanation."
1980-06-05T00:00:00Z,"Led by oil and precious-metals stocks, the New York Stock Exchange surged to its biggest gain in almost six weeks yesterday.

Volume was 44.2 million shares, up from 33.2 million on Tuesday. Analysts attributed the advances, in which winners outnumbered losers by 1,161 to 381, to Tuesday's primary election results, particularly in California, where voters rejected a proposed 10 percent surtax on oil company profits, and to the lowering of the prime lending rate to 13 percent from 14 percent by Chase Manhattan, Morgan Guaranty and Marine Midland, among other banks."

1980-06-05T00:00:00Z,"Insects Poor growth or stunted leaves may indicate increased insect pests. Check with a hand magnifier. Signs include gossamer webs of spider mites; large weaving of leaves by webworms; sticky, honeylike secretion of aphids or scale; lacy or jagged leaves left by beatles or slugs; irregular blotches traced by leaf borers. If you discover bugs, don't panic. They're part of every garden, even in the city, and you may have some useful predators. Basic safe prevention of pests includes vigilance and weekly hosing of undersides of leaves. Once knocked off, many won't return. Hose plants early so the leaves dry by dark. If infestation is out of control, use chemicals with caution, spraying only the afflicted plant. For aphids and mealy bugs, use Malathion 50 (safe for edibles). For scale or leaf miner, use Isotox or Orthene (not safe for edibles); for mites, Kelthane or Diazinon (safe for edibles). Read every word on the label. Keep such equipment and supplies out of the kitchen. Avoid spraying on windy days. Be considerate when using poisons on terraces over streets or other people's gardens. Spring Harmony Study spring bulb catalogues now to plot a longer sequence of bloom with improved coordination of shrubs. While the memory of their color still lingers, orchestrate a better array for next year. Note successful (or dreadful) color combinations, relocating tubs of clashing forsythia, azaleas, rhododendron or crabapples. Plants to be transplanted can be dug up in fall or early spring. Fertilizing Heavy rains increase the leaching of nutrients from tubs. Begin biweekly feeding of summer flowering plants like petunias or tomatoes, and shrubs and vines like roses, clematis or hydrangea. Use a water-soluble fertilizer high in phosphorus (the middle number on the label). Use this also for a final boost for spring flowering shrubs and trees to help them set buds for next year. If new leaves of flowery evergreens like azalea or andromeda are mottled yellowishgreen, there may be an iron deficiency. Lightly work moistened sphagnum peat moss into their soil and fertilize with a product containing chelated iron, such as Miracid. Pruning Now that they've finished blooming, prune spring flowering shrubs and trees to improve their shape and keep them under control. If terrace space is diminishing, train branches out over the street. Remove or tie back eye-level twigs on terrace side. Trim interior stems to open the plant to light and air and to reveal the sculptural form of the branching. Wild Birds Birds are a delight to see and hear and will visit lush city gardens, where they help control insects. Bird feeders may be purchased at garden centers and seed at supermarkets. Hang feeders among the branches of shrubs where the birds feel sheltered and where the seed can't fall on the floor and attract pigeons. Pigeons can also be avoided by selecting a feeder with a dowel stick style perch."

Overseeing the ceremonies at his Atlanta headquarters, was R.E. (Ted) Turner, the considerably less than humble president of the Turner Broadcasting System Inc., the parent company of CNN. Mr. Turner spoke of brotherhood, kindness and peace. One of his initial guests in a taped interview, President Carter, a fellow Georgian, referred to ''an exciting and historic thing,'' capable of delivering news in much more depth. In fact, the first few days of CNN's operation have revealed an instrument of considerable potential and nagging flaws. Some of the flaws are technical flaws. There is also a lopsided ''mix'' of news and features. There is a likelihood of personnel becoming exhausted and jaded. But CNN, with Reese Schonfeld as president, clearly represents a sign of the inevitable future."

1980-06-05T00:00:00Z,"SHEET vinyl floor covering - the type that comes in wide rolls, rather than in individual squares or tiles - has been popular for many years, and in recent years its popularity has increased as manufacturers have introduced highly flexible, easy-to-work-with versions that are designed for do-it-yourself installers. Before, this type of sheet flooring was almost always installed by professionals only. However, even though the new sheet vinyl materials are much easier to work with than the older forms, many homeowners still are reluctant to tackle the job because of the tricky cutting and fitting often involved when working with these rolls, which measure either 6 or 12 feet in width. If not cut to a precise fit around the edges the installation did not look neat, and a wrong cut could often ruin a large sheet of material."

And it is not, strictly speaking, an alteration to the park at all. It is simply the Sheep Meadow, the vast open area that has over the years been the site for rock concerts, symphonic performances, operas and political rallies, looking for the first time in many, many years as it was intended to look - like a great, rolling, soft and brilliant green lawn. The meadow, which sits in the mid-60's just a bit east of Tavern on the Green and west of the Mall, has been completely resodded. For years now it has been more brown than green, worn by literally thousands of pairs of feet; now it has been transformed, and the vision of green it offers in the middle of the park is truly startling. We are not used to seeing a real lawn in Central Park, which more often than not tends to look like a run-down vacant lot, despite the efforts of the current Parks Commissioner, Gordon J. Davis, and the Central Park administrator, Elizabeth B. Barlow, to maintain the park in the face of diminishing city resources."

Iraq takes the view that there is no longer any possibility at this stage of history for a negotiated settlement of the Arab-Israeli conflict. Negotiation, Iraq believes, cannot be effective so long as the Israelis enjoy military superiority and America's unquestioned backing and assistance. Iraq has therefore decided on a campaign designed to undermine Israel's economic links with Europe, and to put pressure on America to choose between its interests in the European alliance and its commitment to Israel."

1980-06-05T00:00:00Z,"SCHOOL is out, summer approaches, the travel season is starting - so maybe it's a good idea to talk some more about automobile stereo, even though I am about to honk a sour note in the audio motorcade. The big push in highway hi-fi, as noted last week, is for more power. Even in-dash radio/cassette combos nowadays run up to 20 watts a channel, and with trunk-mounted power amplifiers automotive wattage escalates into the hundreds. Dispassionate observers may conclude that car-stereo has gone power-mad; but, as in most forms of madness, there is a nub of rationality. The idea is to have enough wattage to override road and motor noises without forcing the system into distortion. The idea has basic merit. At their best, high-powered systems encapsulate the traveler in their sound, isolating him from audible intrusions of the environment. Whether the acoustic displacement of the real world is really what you want is another question. But many people like it and, as a psycho-sensual experience, it's definitely worth a try."

John Mead Howells and Raymond Hood won, and their Gothic tower on North Michigan Avenue, completed in 1924, remains one of this city's distinguished landmarks.

Remove faded flowers. Feed once again toward end of the month. Daffodils: Pull up ripened yellow foliage. This is a good time to dig and replant clumps of overgrown bulbs. Vegetables Cultivate lightly and apply mulch between rows to keep soil moisture in, and weeds out. Start indoors the seeds of broccoli, cabbage, Brussels sprouts and cauliflower for planting outdoors in late July. Sow another row of carrots and beets. Cut asparagus until end of the month, then stalks must be allowed to grow. Apply fertilizer. Fruit Trees Hand-thin apples, peaches and pears so young fruits are six inches apart. Continue disease/pest control multispray mixture at least every two weeks and after any heavy rainfall. Lawns Set mowers to cut high (two or two and one-half inches). Mow often; do not rake up clippings, which supply nitrogen to grass. Use herbicides with caution in warm weather. Be alert for chinch bugs that may appear toward end of month. Insect Pests Gypsy Moth: If rampant, sprays on particular trees may be necessary; however, trees refoliate later in the summer.

Aphids: Watch rose buds and nasturtiums particularly; use malathion or Orthene. Taxus Weevil: Watch leaves of rhododendrons and azaleas for scalloped leaf edges, a sign of their feeding; spray foliage with Orthene to control adults before egg laying. Lace Bug: Examine undersides of andromeda foliage; if present use Orthene or malathion. Shrubs Cut faded flowers from lilacs; scratch in around root area a half cupful or so of wood ashes to encourage better bloom. Prune spirea, mock orange, weigela, viburnums. Carefully dead head (pinch out faded flowers) from rhododendron. Good time to prune overgrown shrubs. Trees Check trunks of dogwood and mountain ash for oozing sap and frass, signs of borer entry; poke wire up into hole to kill borers or use commercial borer pastes. On dogwoods, cut out the upright growing branches called water sprouts. On magnolias, prune out suckers growing up from base of trunks. Spray birches again for control of leaf miner.

Clearly it is Mr. Jackson who is sitting at his desk desperately trying to overcome writer's block. ''What will I write about?'' he asks, and then answers, ''I'll write about my pencil.'' Most of the sketches are about people trying to combat ennui by immersing themselves in some questionable pursuit, as if in the misguided belief that the intensity of the activity would automatically make it interesting. The fact is that the scenes are largely a demonstration of boring from within."

Mr. Bemberg's addled domestic drama, which opened last night at the Theater de Lys, is the kind of evening for which the word excruciating was invented. A few unappetizing characters are set down in a quaint New Hampshire living room and proceed to claw at one another for two long acts. One scene would have been more than enough. This play announces all that it has on its mind - and it's not much -in the first five minutes. After that, rigor mortis sets in. The living room belongs to a quaint New England family named Carsters. They're not a fun crowd. The brother, Bayard, is a priggish, megalomaniacal, middle-aged history professor who wears suspenders, a vest and a cardigan all at the same time. He's so uptight he makes Richard M. Nixon look like Gene Kelly. The sister, Harriet, is a 35-year-old, mentallly unbalanced spinster who wants to escape Bayard and marry a dashing young carpenter next door. Another brother, Andrew, shows up after a two-decade absence to settle some old family scores. Andrew has lately been in Rio de Janeiro, where he has picked up a drinking problem, a beloved pet mongoose and an extensive wardrobe of loud Hawaiian shirts."

1980-06-05T00:00:00Z,"ALWAYS a master of the minimal, Samuel Beckett has continually worked at refining his vision, and his later plays are so short, so intense, that they seem to pivot on a single image. In the case of ''Footfalls'' and ''Not I,'' which Lawrence Sacharow has staged with appropriate austerity at La Mama, those images, a woman pacing a thin, white line on the floor and a spectral mouth floating in the dark, are stark indeed. But they are also powerful in their attenuation. They compress the author's lasting preoccupations with death and guilt into one dramatic gesture. A kind of fugue for two voices, ''Footfalls'' is the first and more substantial work. Suffering from a kind of metaphysical insomnia, a middle-aged woman named May, the name of Beckett's mother, walks back and forth endlessly, the clap of her heels on the floor marking the passage of time as insistently as any clock. It is a striking if somewhat self-contained tableau, and the vacant-eyed May, played with deliberation and restrained emotion by Margo Lee Sherman, looks hauntingly like the woman in Edvard Munch's painting ''The Scream.''"

''We are elated that the situation turned out as it did last night,'' she said, referring to Senator Edward M.

1980-06-05T00:00:00Z,"The first United States Government ship since 1949 docked here today. American officials said the arrival of the research ship Oceanographer opened a new era in expanded scientific relations between China and the United States and underlined the continued improvement in diplomatic ties. A small fleet of Government tugboats, barges and ferries accompanied the Oceanographer through the crowded harbor. As it nudged toward the quay and a welcoming party of Chinese and American officials, a coal barge crashed into the side of a police launch directing river traffic away from the American ship. The damaged police boat sped to shore."
1980-06-05T00:00:00Z,"City people are often enchanted by the sounds they hear on a summer night in the country. They lie abed imagining the shapes of the animals that call, peep or hoot, or speculate about the destination, origin and cargo of the trains whistling sadly in the distance. But the imagination can also be stimulated in the city when the airconditioning fails and windows are flung wide. Here follows a ''2d Avenue Nature Diary'': 1:15 A.M. A truck with square iron wheels turns corner and proceeds south. What kind of cargo requires such a vehicle and steel containers with loose lids? 2:07 A.M. Sixteen or more drunken persons argue over which saloon offers the best prospects after two o'clock in the morning. The naturalist aims to identify the sound of the winner and determine how many form a nasal sub-species from Philadelphia. Do they always travel in a pack? Are they old enough for antlers? 3:42 A.M. A fire engine from the little house around the corner leaves on a perilous assignment. What a lovely whistle! Will its mate soon follow? How it lingers at the corner, calling, calling. 4:26 A.M. A beaver resembling an air compressor sets to work on a sidestreet dam. Is it a green telephone beaver, a blue electric beaver or an orange consolidated telegraph variety? 5:45 A.M. The scavengers. They rattle their clever tails as they roll up the garbage bags from Sloan's birdfeeder. Do they attack people? 6:15 A.M. A crazy sound from the terrace. Is it Superman? Is it a plane? No. It's a bird!"
1980-06-05T00:00:00Z,"Californians rejected a proposal to slash income taxes by an overwhelming margin yesterday, but there were indications that the outcome was not a result of a change of heart by voters who avidly embraced a similar cut in property taxes in 1978. The new measure, known as Proposition 9, which would have cut state income tax rates in half, was defeated by 61 percent to 39 percent. In contrast, Proposition 13, which sharply reduced local property taxes, was adopted by a 2-to-1 margin two years ago."
1980-06-05T00:00:00Z,"Among the thousands of acres that Burlington Northern Inc. acquired over the years, and put out of mind, was the land on the top of Mount St. Helens, which blew apart in the volcanic eruption of mid-May. ''What we now own up there is mostly crater,'' said S.G. Merryman, vice president of timber and land for the diversified railroad company. About 640 acres of Burlington mountaintop disappeared into the still-smoldering crater just below the peak, or drifted across the country as fine ash after that first big eruption in May."
1980-06-05T00:00:00Z,"The Government today reported the first decline in two and a half years in the commitment rate on mortgages. The commitment rate is the interest rate a thrift institution agrees to charge on a mortgage to be closed at a future date. The Federal Home Loan Bank Board, which oversees the nation's savings and loan associations, said the average commitment rate fell to 15.72 percent in May from a record 16.59 percent in April. It was the first drop in this lending rate since October 1977 and the largest on record, the bank board added. The decline indicates that conventional mortgage interest rates are coming down."
1980-06-05T00:00:00Z,"THE past decade has been one during which the machine-tool industry has sought to make major jumps in technology, and the concept of numerical control - computerized systems of machining parts with minimal assistance from operators - has become widely accepted. One such system, direct numerical control, or D.N.C., seeks to tie machines together into a system controlled by a central computer. Introduced in the early 1970's, it was part of an effort to cut the enormous amount of wasted time in shops, where parts spent as much as 95 percent of the time waiting in bins as they moved from one machine to another."

1980-06-05T00:00:00Z,"Several major banks reduced their prime rate yesterday by a full percentage point, to 13 percent. Their action undercut banks that only last week lowered to 14 percent the interest they charge their most creditworthy corporate customers. The prime rate has now reached its lowest level since last September. The Chase Manhattan Bank, the nation's third-largest bank, was the first to announce yesterday's reduction, followed by the Morgan Guaranty Trust Company, the nation's fifth-largest bank, and the Marine Midland Bank, the 13th-largest. The Manufacturers Bank in Los Angeles also joined the downward move."

He is interested in joining the Rangers because he has an export-import business in New Jersey and because he would like to return to Sweden within the next two years."
1980-06-05T00:00:00Z,"A Federal appeals court ruled today that Governor Carey could not be forced to find money to pay for the panel that monitors conditions at the Staten Island Developmental Center for the retarded if the Legislature did not want him to. The center was formerly known as Willowbrook. The United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit in New York City reversed a lower-court order that Mr. Carey somehow find $342,000 in state funds to keep the panel operating. The action leaves in doubt the future of the panel, which oversees state compliance with an agreement to improve conditions at the center."
1980-06-05T00:00:00Z,"When legislators argued that New York couldn't afford to increase welfare benefits, Governor Carey was saying courageously that it could and should. But now Mr. Carey has shifted, to a plan that is a sorry, stingy gesture to 500,000 families in desperate need. The Governor proposes raising benefits by 10 percent for just six months, starting Oct. 1. By describing the supplement as an energy subsidy, he hopes Washington will not consider it an increase, which would trigger a reduction of Federal food stamps. This clever formula should satisfy legislators who feared a slight loss of Federal support for welfare. But if that obstacle has been overcome, there should be no excuse for letting welfare recipients stagger along without a serious adjustment for the inflation of the past six years."

In a Florida court, probably late this year, Steve Sion of Margate, Fla., and Allan Cokin of Pompano Beach, Fla., who were expelled for alleged cheating from the American Contract Bridge League last year after lengthy hearings, will sue for damages and reinstatement, using an antitrust argument. Soon afterward, a California court will hear the case of Dr. Richard Katz and Larry Cohen of Los Angeles, who resigned from the league, tendering an apology, in the course of the 1977 International Team Trials in Houston. Now they deny any guilt, and they, too, are suing for damages and reinstatement."

1980-06-05T00:00:00Z,"International A West Bank strike was curtailed as Israeli soldiers forced Arab merchants to open their shops. There was fear and deep resentment among the Arabs, who began the general strike Tuesday to protest bombing attacks against three Palestinian mayors, but the region was generally calm and under heavy guard. (Page A1, Column 4.) The militant Jewish settlers in the West Bank have become a powerful force that no Israeli Government can ignore. The idealistic and wellarmed activists are determined that the occupied areas should remain in Jewish hands, and some Israeli analysts believe that their strength in numbers and in organization is approaching a point that may bar a voluntary Israeli evacuation without bloodshed. (A1:5.) Sharply expanded U.S.-Chinese ties are expected to be announced soon. State Department officials said that the contemplated accords included the establishment of Chinese consulates in New York, Chicago and Honolulu, direct air service between the two countries perhaps by this fall and permission for Peking to begin receiving benefits from the Export-Import Bank. (A1:4.) Firm military control of South Korea has been imposed by Lieut. Gen. Chon Too Hwan, the army strongman, who has completed the formation of a new regime dominated by generals, according to Koreans and diplomats in Seoul. They said that the general had personally appointed more than 100 top officers, government officials and professors to 14 subcommittees covering all major affairs to report to his leadership council. (A1:1-3.) Wastes have forced the evacuation of 269 families in a Netherlands town near Rotterdam. They were ordered to leave their homes and live in mobile homes when it was found that their water supplies had been polluted by waste chemicals buried a decade ago. A resident likened the problem to the toxic-waste crisis in the Love Canal area of Niagara Falls, N.Y. (A2:3-6.) An inquiry into U.S. policies in Iran during the rule of the deposed Shah will be undertaken in the United States, according to former Attorney General Ramsey Clark. He said in Teheran that he had agreed to a request by the President of Iran that he form a commission to conduct the investigation and that he might ''sue the Government'' to obtain information. (A3:4-6.) Foreign aid plans faced new snags as Administration forces in the House sought to fight off crippling amendments to a $5 billion authorization for the coming fiscal year. (A3:1-3.) Energy The oil-import fee was rejected overwhelmingly by both the House and Senate in a stunning rebuke to both President Carter and the Congressional Democratic leadership. The votes exceeded by an extraordinary margin those necessary to override a promised Presidential veto. Mr. Carter imposed the fee on imported oil in March as a budget balancing and energy conservation measure. (A1:6.) National An effort to close Democratic ranks is to be made at a White House meeting today by President Carter and Senator Edward M. Kennedy, who were still at odds despite Mr. Carter's strong delegate majority for renomination. However, the Senator, who scored his best primary showing Tuesday with victories in five states, including California and New Jersey, still insisted that the President should debate him on ''the great issues.'' (A1:1-2.) The President's primary drive won the delegates needed for his renomination, but failed to broaden his national political base, several of Mr. Carter's aides said. They added that they were seriously concerned about the problems he faces in the general election and the complexities of the anticipated race against Ronald Reagan and Representative John B. Anderson. (B10:3-4.) Tornadoes ravaged Grand Island, Neb., injuring at least 134 persons and destroying nearly 600 buildings. City officials said they believed that four persons had been killed. Others were unaccounted for after seven twisters struck the city. (A16:1.) A stay of execution was won by a convicted murderer after he changed his position and agreed to join in efforts to fight his death sentence. The prisoner's dramatic reversal led to an indefinite postponement of the execution, which had been set for today. (A16:1.) Metropolitan A major increase in transit fares in New York City became virtually certain when Warren M. Anderson, the Republican majority leader of the State Senate, refused to accept any part of Governor Carey's plan to subsidize the deficit of the Metropolitan Transportation Authority. (A1:3.) Republican aid for Mayor Koch in his expected re-election bid next year has been pledged by William E. Simon, who has volunteered to organize a Republican citizens committee and to seek endorsement by the New York City Republican Party. Mr. Simon, a former Treasury Secretary, is now policy chairman of Ronald Reagan's Presidential campaign. The Democratic Mayor has expressed interest in running as a fusion candidate. (A1:1.) Legalizing marijuana for medical use is in prospect in New York State. The Senate and Assembly Health Committees have agreed to press for approval of such therapy, and leaders in both houses said that the legislation had an excellent chance of passage in this session. A spokesman for Governor Carey said he supported the measure. (B1:6.) Business Digest, Page D1"

The two musicians worked together for several years in Shakti, a pioneering acoustic ensemble that mixed Indian music with jazz, and in Mr. McLaughlin's most recent electric band, but at the Bottom Line they played separate sets. Mr. McLaughlin played a standard acoustic guitar rather than the instrument with scalloped frets that he had especially designed for his Indian-flavored work with Shakti. The first part of his set showed a definite Latin tinge, with several Brazilian- and Flamencoinfluenced pieces; the remainder consisted of jazz standards, new tunes and a number of Mr. McLaughlin's that was originally played with the Mahavishnu Orchestra. Throughout, the guitarist improvised superbly, tempering his multinoted flights with a firm sense of dynamics and pacing. He was ably seconded by the French guitarist Christian Escoude, who soloed in a contrasting, but no less captivating style."

No knowledge of metal, no pottery, no clothing, ''just hunters and gatherers,'' Miss Neuer said.

Richard Westenburg, the festival's artistic director, led the expedition in the manner that one has come to recognize as his, which is to say with sobriety, devoutness and a willingness to compromise in matters of style and performance practice. As in the past, he scaled down his choral forces to the approximate number that Bach could have had at his disposal, using 18 male and 18 female voices. And as usual, Mr. Westenburg's Musica Sacra Chorus was a model of precision and suavity such as even Bach might have approved. The orchestra was about equal in number to the chorus, as it should be. But beyond keeping the vocal and instrumental forces in proper perspective, the conductor made few concessions to currently accepted standards for Baroque performance. Mr. Westenburg did sit at a harpsichord occasionally and help tap out accompaniment harmonies, but the other keyboard instrument used in the continuo was a thick-voiced electronic organ that gave out little suggestion of a Baroque instrument's tone. It is doubtful that Bach ever used both harpsichord and organ in his church performances, since he would have wanted to play both. So far as one could determine by eye and ear, the orchestra contained no authentic instruments. David Jolley, for instance, played his part splendidly on the modern, valved French horn, but the tone was much too ripe and furry to sound right in this music."

The Mayor's efforts to save money should be applauded. However, any proposal to eliminate a department that is part of a vital economic sector generating thousands of jobs and millions of dollars in revenues by, among other things, leasing property to shippers and operating markets, would be counterproductive. Further, it would contradict Mr. Koch's efforts to encourage expansion of the privatebusiness sector.

1980-06-06T00:00:00Z,"''NIGHT of the Juggler,'' a thriller that starts out at an exhilaratingly brisk pace, winds up as breathless and overplotted as a thriller can be. A former policeman (James Brolin) has a daughter, and the daughter has blue overalls, and her overalls look disastrously like the outfit worn by another girl, a rich girl, whom a crackpot (Cliff Gorman) is planning to kidnap. He abducts the former policeman's daughter by mistake. The rest of the film is given over to the chase, which spans a lot of New York City locations and produces dozens of banged-up cars. Meanwhile, Mr. Brolin is hounded by a former police co-worker for whom he once caused marital trouble. Plots like this don't grow on trees, unless the trees have very strong branches."
1980-06-06T00:00:00Z,"ONCE again, in this period of reruns, documentaries monopolize the new programming picture. Tonight at 10, NBC News's ''Is There a Better Way?'' offers, in the words of its producer, Robert Rogers, ''an analysis of trends in the 1980 Presidential nominating process.'' Tomorrow at 9 P.M., WNET, Channel 13, is offering a twohour examination called ''Iran: Inside the Islamic Republic.'' And, Sunday at 8, WNEW, Channel 5, has ''Club Fighter,'' a portrait of a young New Jersey boxer reaching for national fame. NBC's ''Is There a Better Way?'' focuses on the ineffectiveness of recent reforms in the electoral process. Foremost among the targets is the limitation of campaign financing to $1,000 by an individual contributor. The motives, it seems, were admirable in attempting to cut off excessive control by fat cats. The consequences, however, have been ambiguous because fund raising has become the major emphasis of most campaigns, and politicians have been forced to devote most of their energy to money matters. In addition, the hourlong program questions the growing importance of primaries, as opposed to the ''wholesale politics'' and wheelingdealing practices of the old days, and the role of the press, the boys on the bus, in political campaigns. George Reedy, one of President Johnson's press secretaries, is on hand to criticize the ''snap judgments'' of news reporters. In the end, the program calls for ''not more reform but some refinements'' in the political arena."

The decision to attend the Moscow Olympics and President Valery Giscard d'Estaing's chat with Leonid Brezhnev are only one aspect of the French stance. Another is that Giscard's party has suddenly decided to proclaim a ''great festival of liberty'' this month as notice that ''freedom is under attack around the world.''

1980-06-06T00:00:00Z,"IT's difficult to keep up with one's favorite modern-dance ''gypsies,'' floating as they do from group to group. New York/ Dance Ensemble, which performed at Theater of the Riverside Church on Wednesday, is a handy collection of some of the best of those gypsies. With dancers like Lance Westergard and Dian Dong, the company has that look of care of a house full of cherished objects. The four new works on Wednesday's program were, however, a mixed bag. Oddly enough, the most successful piece was one by what is probably the nearest thing to a nonchoreographer. Amanda Smith, a writer on dance, seems to have studied Mr. Westergard's very individual performance style and come up with a solo that, while it is slight and doesn't much extend him, is rewardingly thoughtful.Set to three songs sung by Billie Holiday, ''Solitary Games'' plays jazz-dance bits against classical ballet steps and Mr. Westergard's customary look of a wild, rather impudent faun against his look here of a turn-of-the-century tennis player. That tension is to be found, as well, in the bitter honey of Holiday's voice and the songs she sings here."

1980-06-06T00:00:00Z,"ANY handsome young actor can swagger on to a stage, throw his weight around and create a disruption. But when Peter Weller - jittery as an alley cat but not quite as mean - crashes on stage in ''The Woolgatherer,'' he isn't merely strutting his stuff. Cast in the role of a horny truck driver named Cliff, Mr. Weller won't settle for sheer energy or roughneck force. He has instead staked out a very particular piece of territory - that slender psychological boundary between sex and violence - and he straddles it for two hours without ever losing his balance. The result is a relentlessly volatile, scary, magnetic performance - the best of its kind since John Savage's in ''American Buffalo.'' Mr. Weller makes it all look easy, but it's a sure thing that his tightly defined intensity is the product of lots of hard and intelligent work. If this actor is the main reason to check out ''The Woolgatherer,'' which opened at the Circle Repertory last night, he is not the only one. This play also introduces a writer of promise, William Mastrosimone. ''The Woolgatherer'' is a young, rough-hewn work with structural problems, dubious plot contrivances and patches of overliterary dialogue. But the energy, compassion and theatrical sense are there. Though Mr. Mastrosimone hasn't pulled off his own ''Glass Menagerie'' or a blue-collar ''Talley's Folly,'' he convinces us that such achievements may eventually be within his grasp."

1980-06-06T00:00:00Z,"IN the roll call of local bands that have made good, one doesn't often think of the Isley Brothers, mostly because their success has been national for so long. But this sextet of five brothers and one brother-in-law - five of whom live in New Jersey and one in Westchester County, with offices in Manhattan - is surely as successful a local band as there is. The group's latest album is at the top of the soul charts and in the top 10 in the general pop charts. And tonight at 8 the group will headline a bill at Madison Square Garden. The Isley Brothers started out in the mid-1950's as a typical black vocal group with erratic and ever-shifting instrumental accompaniment. The hits started in 1959 with ''Shout'' and kept coming, off and on, throughout the 60's. But it wasn't until the early 70's, with a new business situation and the advent of a younger generation of Isleys, that the group's real commercial ascendency began. The younger Isleys brought instrumental skills the older, singing brothers lacked; henceforth the group would be self-contained on its records (with minimal outside help for the concerts). And since the record company, T-Neck, was owned by the band, which also wrote its own songs, produced its own records and booked and promoted its own tours, the Isley Brothers stand as a leading example of black entrepreneurship in the record business."

Having snuffed out the Kwangju uprising, Korea's generals are now engaged in a frontal assault on what remains of the democratic opposition. With speed and stealth, a shadow military regime has taken power, and it will draft a new constitution presumably tailored to the wishes of Gen. Chon Too Hwan, the emerging claimant to the throne of brass filled by the late President Park. Handwringing aside, can Washington do anything to halt Korea's slide back to military dictatorship? The junta that governs in Seoul evidently calculates Americans are too preoccupied with their own elections to trouble at the extinction of Korea's democratic hopes. Their cold-eyed assumption appears to be that the United States is too anxious about regional security to risk a cutback in military aid, including some of the 39,000 American troops stationed there. And they no doubt think Americans are too protective of their investments in a booming Korean economy to apply economic sanctions, especially through the Export-Import Bank."

1980-06-06T00:00:00Z,"IT can safely be said these days that Louise Nevelson holds New York in the palm of her hand. A view of her work - or of the glamorous sculptor herself - can be had without much strain in almost any part of the city: for instance, two big Nevelson shows are running, at the Pace Gallery, 32 East 57th Street, and at Wildenstein, 19 East 64th Street, and a giant Nevelson sculpture in steel, ''Frozen Laces - One 1979-80,'' has just been installed at Fifth Avenue and 60th Street. And now, as a tribute for her 80th birthday (she was actually born in 1899, but some poetic license has been taken), as well as to its own 50th, the Whitney Museum has mounted a show (through Sept. 7) of the famous Nevelson environments, done mostly in the 1950's and 60's. They marked her first assembling of the sculptures she had made of carved, painted and ''found'' wood objects into massive walls, which established her firmly as one of the world's leading artists. So accustomed are we to the powerfully expressive presence of these works that it seems difficult in 1980 to remember a time when they were not a part of our image bank. As Edward Albee suggests in his essay for the show's catalogue, the world has looked different since we began to accept the Nevelson constructions, with their accretions of dream detritus that suggest the vast and secret baggage of a collective inner life. It isn't every artist who can ''mythicize'' in an unbelieving age, and the furious energy and conviction that saw the sculptor's vision through still excite our amazed admiration."

1980-06-06T00:00:00Z,"ROBERT MANN has been first violinist of the Juilliard String Quartet since its founding in 1946 and has been largely responsible for the ensemble's continuity of style and the maintenance of its stature in international chamber-music circles. Now and then over the years he has turned up in a solo role, but like most musicians who opt for quartet life, Mr. Mann has submerged himself so successfully into his group that it is not easy to think of him as a separate artistic entity. However, last night's concert at the 92d Street Y let one understand that there is a Robert Mann who retains his own performing personality and viewpoint. Thirty-four years of sitting in a quartet might be expected to dull certain sensibilities and produce artistic callouses, but that has not happened to the Juilliard's leader."

1980-06-06T00:00:00Z,"Stephane Grappelli seems much too young to be ''the grand old man of European jazz,'' as one critic has called him. It's true that the urbane, white-haired violinist was born in 1908, but when one goes to see him perform, the soul, elegance and vigor of his playing make the most lasting impression. He stands easily, swaying gently back and forth in front of the microphone, while his two acoustic guitarists, one of whom is some 50 years his junior, sit in chairs beside him. The 37-year-old American guitarist Larry Coryell, whom Mr. Grappelli says ''I like so much,'' has remarked that playing with the violinist had made him realize, ''when a cat is so good - he swings, he's creative, he's exciting - it doesn't matter how old you are.'' Tonight and tomorrow night at 9 and midnight, Mr. Grappelli will be performing at the Other End, 147 Bleeker Street, an intimate club that should be the perfect place to savor his supple lyricism. Admission is $7, with a $2.50 food or drink minimum; for more information or reservations, call 673-7030. Sunday, Mr. Grappelli will be at My Father's Place, 19 Bryant Avenue in Roslyn Village, L.I.; information, (516) 621-8700. The shows at My Father's Place should be particularly interesting because Mr. Grappelli will be sharing the bill with an exceptional young Indian violinist with experience in both Indian classical music and jazz, L. Shankar."

Newhouse Theater in Lincoln Center, is a story about a bush village by a Nigerian writer done as an American (Afro-American, if you prefer) musical by an American man of jazz. What's more, it has a message, a few messages, but they are so well phrased that you will have fun receiving them. ''The Lion and the Jewel'' was written a few decades ago by Wole Soyinka, the Nigerian dramatist. Three years ago, Billy Taylor, the jazz composer and pianist, was commissioned to do a score for it. The result is now a highlight of the International Performing Arts Festival at Lincoln Center, where it will play through Sunday and then, from next Wednesday through June 15, be seen at the Richard Allen Center for Culture and Art, 36 West 62d Street."

1980-06-06T00:00:00Z,"To the Editor: I couldn't agree more with Michel Jobert when he says that it is not easy for Europeans and Americans to understand each other (Op-Ed May 28). One reason for this may be the distortions that take place in former foreign ministers' minds when they write about events in which they participated. v.hen Jobert says that ''in 1973 and 1975, the United States put pressure on its European allies to accept the Helsinki conference on security and cooperation in Europe, an idea that the Russians had been urging and the Europeans had been rejecting since the 1950's,'' one can only conclude that six years out of office have had a powerful effect on his memory."

Tudor City, 12 apartment houses with 5,000 tenants, between 41st and 43d Streets and First and Second Avenues, has two private parks, north and south of 42d St. A simmering controversy over construction of apartment towers on the park sites erupted over the Memorial Day weekend when Tudor City's owners sent workmen who boarded up one of the parks and positioned bulldozers nearby. The Tudor City Tenants Association obtained a restraining order temporarily preventing further work. At a news conference, the owners, represented by Helmsley-Spear Inc., stood firm, allowing only that they would not destroy the parks if the city agreed to turn over, in a swap, a public playground across the street from the United Nations, at the southeast corner of First Avenue and 42d Street."
1980-06-06T00:00:00Z,"ADELE is a carniverous plant with a foamy tongue and maggotty tendrils, and ''Dinner for Adele'' is her story. This Czechoslovak comedy, which is largely a send-up of spy stories, takes an incessantly madcap tone, suggesting that the people who made the movie had a grander, giddier time than you will. Nevertheless, while its high spirits seem exhausting and not entirely warranted, the film has an affable spirit and a good share of ingenious comic touches. ''Dinner for Adele,'' which opens today at the D.W. Griffith and New Yorker theaters, was directed by Oldrich Lipsky, whose joke on the cowboy film was ''Lemonade Joe.'' This time, Mr. Lipsky takes for his main character Nick Carter, the famed detective, presented here as a kind of antiquated James Bond. Nick Carter, as played by Michal Docolomansky, is impeccably suave and a little bit confused. He is also equipped with fancy pre-Bondian gadgets, gifts from friends named Laser and Edison and so on, that do him absolutely no good in a pinch."

Late in the second act, things are rather catching up with him - especially since it's been discovered that he can't read a note a music - and there's a good bit of hot-footed pursuit going on in front of backdrops purporting to represent the Middle Western picnic grounds, ivied porches and moonlit hollows of 1912."

1980-06-06T00:00:00Z,"TWO Japanese films, as fascinating for their social and political implications as for their extraordinary cinematic values, open today at the Thalia Theater. They are Akira Kurosawa's ''No Regrets for Our Youth,'' made in 1946, only three years after his directorial debut and before he made such classics as ''Rashomon,'' ''The Seven Samurai,'' ''The Drunken Angel'' and ''Ikiru,'' and Mikio Naruse's ''Floating Clouds'' (1955), the work of one of Japan's finest directors who is still virtually unknown in this country. Because of the passage of time, the Kurosawa movie operates on several levels that didn't exist at the time it was produced. There's not a frame of this film that is not informed by our awareness of the body of work that the then comparatively young (36) director would go on to create. Then, too, one is acutely conscious of the conditions under which ''No Regrets for Our Youth'' was made."

1980-06-06T00:00:00Z,"BECAUSE so much close supervision is required to run even one restaurant kitchen successfully, it is somewhat strartling to learn that Queh-yuen Tang is supervising the cooking not only at her original and very good Hwa Yuan Szechuan Inn on East Broadway in Chinatown, but now also at four other outposts scattered around the city. Even if the word ''supervising'' is given the loosest interpretation, it is hard to believe that any one person can exercise meaningful control over so large and far-flung a culinary fiefdom. Her newest effort is the seven-month-old Tang Tang on First Avenue, between 76th and 77th Streets, and on the evidence of recent visits and the sampling of some 20 dishes, Mrs. Tang is spreading her talents much too thin, even though it is said that she does most of the dinner cooking at Tang Tang. Although there are several dishes good enough to rely on if one is in this neighborhood, the kitchen's performance is so uneven it hardly seems related to the superior parent restaurant downtown. The management seems to be caught off guard so frequently that it is unprepared for busy evenings. The result is a sense of emergency that is communicated to diners, spoiling the easy relaxation that the simple and handsome modern wood-structured interior might otherwise impart."

It gave her a two-shot lead in the first round of the 26th annual Ladies' Professional Golf Association Championship.

1980-06-06T00:00:00Z,"MORE than half a century has passed since Adelaide Hall sang ''Diga Diga Doo'' and ''I Must Have That Man'' in ''Blackbirds of 1928.'' She recorded ''I Must Have That Man'' with Duke Ellington's orchestra in 1933, and now, when she is in her 70's, hearing her sing this same song at Michael's Pub, where she is making her first nightclub appearance in New York since the early 30's, one marvels at how little her singing has changed over all these years. Even with a slight huskiness, caused, she says, by going out on Fifth Avenue without a scarf, Miss Hall's voice has a vital, vibrant quality that coils around a listener's ears. On both this number and another ''Blackbirds'' song, ''I Can't Give You Anything but Love,'' her beat and her emphasis are precisely right, easy but swinging, projected with a secure, confident presence. And on a very different song of the early 30's, Duke Ellington's ''Sophisticated Lady,'' her simple, direct approach, her voice sometimes floating over the melody with a semispoken delivery, caught the mood of the song without overdramatizing it."
1980-06-06T00:00:00Z,"Most bridge experts are active all the year round, attending every convenient tournament and perhaps some that are inconvenient. A few, however, hibernate for a season or even a year or two, emerging when warm sunshine gives promise of good things to come and prospective partners beckon. One of these is Merle Tom of Cos Cob, Conn., a former National Open Pairs champion who has played little in recent years. He emerged during the past season to compete in the Grand National Team Championship. Although his team was defeated in this knockout event, he is, paradoxically, still in contention."

Miss Liston will start picking up her jazz career again at 8 tomorrow night in a concert at Symphony Space, Broadway and 95th Street, that is part of the eight-day Salute to Women in Jazz.

1980-06-06T00:00:00Z,"The final primary round on Super Tuesday confirmed what has been apparent for weeks - that Democrats are profoundly unhappy about nominating Jimmy Carter or Edward Kennedy, so much so that many threaten to bolt either candidate in the fall. But if the nomination of either thus risks a divided party, so does the only alternative, the ''dumping'' of Mr. Carter for some as yet unidentified third contender. Any such effort would have to rely mostly on Mr. Kennedy's considerable delegate strength, continuing the Carter-Kennedy conflict; and whether it succeeded or not, the losers would be hard to enlist in support of the ultimate nominee."

''The Silken Ladder,'' written in 1812, is a one-act delight, with a libretto as charmingly ridiculous as a Feydeau farce and music in Rossini's most ebullient style.

In no other single element were those aims of practicality, beauty and healthful exercise so neatly realized as in the little bridges that dotted the park. Some were carved stone, establishing the park as a place for lofty thoughts. Others - romantic replications of nature - were built from tree branches or the stone rubble cleared by the men and boys who turned out to build the park in 1858."

Trumpets blared, the park's usually dormant fountain gushed, purple banners waved, colored balloons floated overhead and relieved and triumphant parents applauded. Ten thousand men women and children massed under the park's verdant trees and, 3,000 of the graduates were there in person. Police cars screamed past as the commencement address was being delivered by the university's acting president, Ivan L. Bennett Jr. He noted, somewhat apologetically that he was a medical doctor, not an academic one, and drew parallels between the problems of dealing with the body politic and with the human body."
1980-06-06T00:00:00Z,"JOHN SINGER SARGENT'' at the Coe Kerr Gallery, 49 East 82d Street, is based upon the idea that there were two Sargents: one who painted for the great world that loved and stifled him, and one who painted for himself. Warren Adelson, director of the gallery, has worked hard and long to prove the second half of this proposition, and the show offers 65 works, in oil or watercolor, many of them shown for the first time in this country. The notion in question has been mooted about many other successful late-19th-century painters. In England, Landseer's major paintings of stags and dogs have long been a joke, but his litle paintings of landscape are highly prized. In Germany, Menzel's reconstructions of life in 18th-century Potsdam have not aged well, but people will beat one another with their umbrellas to get at one of his drawings. In Russia, Repin's group portrait of parliamentarians looks stiff and unconfident, but the individual sketches for it get high marks for their brio. It is as if art at that time was in rebellion against the tasks that society set before it."

1980-06-06T00:00:00Z,"Historically, it has always been a delicate political moment when the victor met the vanquished after a strenuous struggle for a party's Presidential nomination, as President Carter, who has enough convention delegates for renomination, and Senator Edward M. Kennedy did today. And in the past, just as today, the stakes have always been high, especially for the winners, for failure to heal the breach in their own party has often been a factor in their loss of the general election. Today, Senator Kennedy's determination to carry on his fight had the ring of potential trouble for President Carter."

Consumers can expect the higher prices to show up at the retail level in about a month."
1980-06-06T00:00:00Z,"Remember when banks paid interest, and only interest, for your money? Today, many banks look more like catalogue showrooms, with deposit slips buried under toasters, espresso machines, video recorders and digital watches. Some banks are even offering the ultimate premium for new accounts: cash. ''Bring in a friend,'' the ads urge, and take home as much as $1,250. The bonus war means two things: First, the Federally prescribed limits on interest rates are obviously too low. If banks are willing to pay a finder's fee of up to 1 1/2 percent, then clearly they value your money by at least that much more than the interest they are allowed to pay for it. Second, the Government's techniques for controlling interest rates are plainly breaking down. The finder's fee is just one clever ruse around the limits. Paying the fee in television sets or refrigerators as well as cash creates the further problem of defining its true value. Not only the consumer but a bank's competitors will be hard put to know precisely where the market stands, and that opens the way to reckless competition."

The museum is a relatively new one, but it already has the third largest attendance of any in Spain.

1980-06-07T00:00:00Z,"The discipline of history in the United States made a crucial error about 40 years ago. It tragically narrowed its audience to students and other academics. Though the research that historians have been writing for each other since then has often been excellent and truly innovative, a larger public audience, which had been addressed by good historians in the 19th and early 20th centuries, has been neglected. As a result, the public's historical sense has dwindled. Thus, the reading public has dropped most history from its list, while special groups concerned with their own past have found relatively few historians addressing them directly. Other potential clients for history have been equally neglected. For example, a promising, earlier initiative toward developing historical research designed for policy use simply withered; further, news-media interest in historical subjects took shape without the benefit of professional guidance, the result often being pseudo-history in, say, television films that purport to deal with the past."

1980-06-07T00:00:00Z,"They surely love birthday parties in Brooklyn. On Thursday night, when Brooklyn was 355 years old, the Borough Hall Restoration Foundation threw a fund-raising party to restore its handsome 131-year-old Borough Hall. Brooklyn was a city when the building was constructed - it did not vote to join New York until 1898 - and the hall was meant to outdo Manhattan's City Hall. This was the foundation's third birthday party and tickets were $355 a couple; last year, they were $354. As Howard Golden, the Borough President, said, ''The foundation has found a way to beat spiraling prices - tickets go up only $1 a year.'' And so there were drinks in the main-floor rotunda, whose centerpiece is a huge bronze bell that once hung in the Victorian cupola; dinner and dancing in the third-floor courtroom, with its marvelous coffered rotunda, and impromptu political meetings in Mr. Golden's refurbished office dominated by a huge portrait of George Washington. No one seemed to know who did the portrait or the ones of former Brooklyn mayors and borough presidents on the courtroom walls. ''We found them all dirty in the attic,'' said David Lee, home fashion director of Abraham & Straus, who is in charge of the interior refurbishing."
1980-06-07T00:00:00Z,"A spirit of cooperation and a desire for consensus seemed to prevail in many of the workshops at the White House Conference on Families here today. A total of 671 delegates from 15 states, Puerto Rico and the Virgin Islands sifted rapidly through hundreds of proposals. But the introduction of some provocative topics, such as abortion and alternative family structures, brought on angry debate. At one point, a contingent of more than 30 conservative delegates walked out, claiming that their point of view had been denied a fair hearing. The action occurred after lunch during the second day of the three-day Government-sponsored conference that is intended to produce new approaches to family problems."

The answer depends on where one sits, and that accounts for the deadlock in trying to put together a package to subsidize the Metropolitan Transportation Authority's huge deficit. For Governor Carey, a fare increase is anathema. Mr. Carey ran for re-election in 1978 pledging to hold fares on all the state's transportation systems at current levels. He also traded a commitment to hold fares at 50 cents on New York City's subways and buses through 1981 for Mayor Koch's reluctant agreement to support the Westway as a replacement for the defunct West Side Highway in Manhattan."

The plays are generally of a comic nature, but the best also have an edge of omen and mystery. In each of the three programs, one play stands out: Robert Pine's ''Landscape with Waitress,'' about a lonely writer's selfdramatization of his solitary life; Jonathan Ringkamp's ''Bella Figura,'' the temptation of a Franciscan brother, and on the final bill of three one-acts, Katherine Long's ''Two Part Harmony.''"

1980-06-07T00:00:00Z,"As a matter of law, policy and probably style as well, the Carter Administration is unwise to threaten Ramsey Clark & Co. with prosecution for defying the ban on American travel to Iran. Nothing that Mr. Clark and his nine companions may say or do could possibly embarrass the United States as much as a petty legal assault on their attempt to liberate American hostages while attending a conference on ''America's crimes'' in Teheran. Moreover, a restrictive reading of travel laws might look a bit silly from a Government that itself ignored the letter of the law when it penetrated Iranian territory during the recent rescue attempt. That attempt was defended, rightly, on the ground that Iran's bizarre assault on the norms of diplomacy required a strong if unconventional response. The same reasoning should apply now to freelance American participation in a Teheran propaganda show. Former Attorney General Clark and his fellow envoys conveyed two messages: that America erred grievously in past sponsorship of the Shah's regime and that Iran's militants now err grievously by refusing to liberate their American captives. So unwelcome was the latter message that Mr. Clark was condemned, in an apparent sideswipe at President Bani-Sadr, as ''the vilest American agent'' by Teheran Radio."

1980-06-07T00:00:00Z,"Just last year, which is ancient history in the mercurial world of Manhattan underground rock, there was a band called the Model Citizens. True to its name, this consisted of four people up front (plus a two-man backup rhythm section) that looked positively superhuman. In contrast to the scruffy, bizarre imagery that predominates on the punk/new-wave scene, the Model Citizens were eerily perfect: physically beautiful, conservatively yet artfully dressed. Yet their perfection was really too perfect, a kind of fractured vision of the 1950's. And thus, of course, it was really even more bizarre than the competition. Last November the Model Citizens broke up, spawning three new bands. All three, encountered recently in Manhattan clubs, purvey a musical style at least partly reminiscent of the mother-band. The Model Citizens flouted the prevailing dance-rock styles by making a music that was deliberately disjunctive and eccentric. Captain Beefheart seemed an inspiration, along with some forms of new jazz and the kooky flamboyance of Lene Lovich."

The statement, issued after the close last night of a four-day conference that the Teheran radio said was attended by 350 nongovernmental delegates from 54 countries, pictured Mr. Clark as a possible secret agent of President Carter. Citing a theory that is doubted by most historians, the conference document said Hitler sent Rudolf Hess, his chief deputy, to Britain in 1941 on a psychological warfare mission against the British, and it suggested that Mr. Carter sent Mr. Clark on a similar mission to Iran."

1980-06-07T00:00:00Z,"The lesson of ''The Hearse,'' which may be something a lot of us already knew, is that it's a bad idea to live alone in a house filled with mean-spirited apparitions. It is doubly bad if the locale is a town where everyone thinks you are the wicked reincarnation of your late Aunt Rebecca. I think we knew that, too. Nevertheless, Trish Van Devere does all these foolhardy things in ''The Hearse,'' which opened yesterday at the Rivoli and other theaters. The house was her family's, and she has just gone through a divorce plus the death of a parent, and so perhaps this explains her curious daring. In any case, she busies herself with painting and spackling and tidying the old place up, in hopes of making it cheery. Nothing doing. Soon she is being seduced by some demons and chased by others, including the ghostly driver of the title vehicle and the town's crew of leering delivery boys. The reasons for all this remain obscure even after they have been explained."

He was was pictured as a possible secret agent of President Carter in a statement issued at the end of the four-day meeting. The statement also denounced the United States for what the conference leaders said was continued interference in Iran over 27 years. It did not mention the American hostages being held in Iran. (Page 1, Cols. 1-2.) Customs officials confiscated papers belonging to three Americans returning from the Iran conference on ''United States intervention in Iran,'' the three said after arriving at Kennedy International Airport. An official said documents had been copied and returned to the three. (5:5-6.) Rabbi Meir Kahane must stay in prison in Israel without being told why, the Supreme Court in Jerusalem ruled, saying that the evidence against him and an associate, indicating ''a plot to attack Arabs,'' was so serious that no moderation of the prison term could be considered. (3:5-6.) The P.L.O. reversed a policy statement calling on Palestinians to settle for nothing less than the destruction of Israel, issued by Al Fatah, the organization's most powerful faction, last Sunday at the end an 11-day meeting in Damascus. P.L.O. representatives said the statement was ''misunderstood'' and that Al Fatah would accept a political solution that would establish an independent Palestinian state on territories recovered from Israel. (3:1.) Submission of the arms pact to the Senate is still an objective of the Administration regardless of the Soviet intervention in Afghanistan, Secretary of State Edmund S. Muskie said. Responding to former Secretary of State Cyrus R. Vance's call on Thursday for action on the pact this year, he said that the Administration was ''committed to the SALT process and we have under consideration strategies for pursuing that objective.'' (4:3-4.) Moscow will have far fewer visitors attending the Olympic Games this summer than had been expected before President Carter pressed for an international boycott. Soviet officials had planned on 300,000 foreign tourists. Moscow's Mayor and others now say that 70,000 are expected. (16:5-6.) Energy The Senate killed the oil-import fee, voting 68 to 10 to override a Presidential veto and thus enacting legislation rejecting the fee. The House on Thursday voted by 335 to 34 to override the veto. The fee would have raised consumer gasoline prices by 10 cents a gallon. The Senate regarded the surcharge as a tax that would be politically difficult to back in an election year, and felt that its authorization by the President was an usurption of Congressional authority. (1:4.) National The jobless rate increased again in May. It rose by eight-tenths of a percentage point, the same as the April increase, to 7.8 percent of the nation's total work force, the Bureau of Labor Statistics reported. The increase over the two-month period was the biggest in the nation's history, the bureau said, and it indicated that the recession would be deeper and longer than had been expected. (1:6.) Producer prices rose by only three-tenths of 1 percent in May, the Government said. It was the smallest one-month rise in 32 months in the Producer Price Index for finished goods, a sign that there will be a further slowdown in retail price inflation. (1:5.) Bert Lance will not be retried, with two co-defendants, on banking charges, the Justice Department announced. The department said it would move in Federal District Court in Atlanta next week to dismiss three remaining counts against Mr. Lance, President Carter's former budget director, and counts against his co-defendants. The three had recently been cleared of a series of other charges. (1:6.) The filling-in of a California reservoir was ordered by Secretary of the Interior Cecil D. Andrus, who warned the state's Congressional delegation that unless it presses now to save a contested section of white water on the Stanislaus River behind the reservoir's dam in northern California, he will flood that area, too. (6:1-2.) Metropolitan An unmarried woman may sue for redress when she separates from a man she had been living with. To receive a share of his assets, she must show that they had an ''express'' agreement, the New York State Court of Appeals ruled. California is the only other state which has given women the right to sue for a share of the assets of a former partner. The New York court acted in the case of Frances Morone, who had sued for financial support from the man she said she lived with for 25 years. (1:3.) Hartford's City Manager was ousted in a continuing political dispute over the the city's form of government. High municipal officials had previously been forced to quit and others, including the police chief, are under similar pressure. (1:3-5.) New York City's jobless rate rose less than the nationwide rate in May, although it went up to 8.4 percent from 8 percent in May 1979. New York State's unemployment rate reached a 19-month high last month, and New Jersey's rate showed a marked increase, according to the regional office of the Bureau of Labor Statistics. (7:4-6.)

1980-06-08T00:00:00Z,"The hotel chef in ''The Shining'' is supposed to have remarkable psychic powers, but the movie never explains the strangest of this man's idiosyncrasies: he can smell trouble from Miami to Colorado, but he doesn't detect a killer standing 10 feet away from him, armed with an ax and wearing a horrible grin. The movie's ghostly butler starts out with the name of Charles Grady, but he somehow becomes Delbert Grady before the story is finished. The caption on a closing photograph of Jack Nicholson utterly defies explanation. And the director, Stanley Kubrick, once again leaves his audiences asking a familiar question: How can anyone make a film so fastidiously beautiful and still leave so many loose ends? ''The Shining'' may be a horror film, but it very much fits the Kubrick mold. First and foremost, it is mesmerizingly lovely, so handsome you may be halfway out of the theater before those nagging questions arise. Yet, like ''A Clockwork Orange'' or ''2001: A Space Odyssey,'' this is a movie that barely makes sense upon examination. Most of the small details seem meticulously chosen, but there's no evidence that corresponding care has been taken with the film's central concerns."

It also would allow people now barred by the three-year limitation one more year to begin court action. Assuming the bill becomes law, any questions of constitutionality in regard to extending retroactively the statute of limitations would remain for the courts to decide."

1980-06-08T00:00:00Z,"Every once in awhile we suddenly step back and notice that an oldfashioned theatrical form, one we'd thought drained of energy if not safely dead and buried, is in fact simply waiting patiently in the wings, scenery intact, ready to be trundled out again in all its familiar furbelows. Not so much passe, let's say, as eternally patient. And, in some peculiar way, still useful. Take courtroom melodrama, for instance - which you may very well do by dropping by the Biltmore where Tom Topor's ''Nuts'' is now holding forth. By all the rules, if there are any rules, courtroom melodrama should have exhausted its ploys and counterploys as far back as ''Witness for the Prosecution,'' if not ''The Trial of Mary Dugan.'' Surely every leading question, surely every evasive answer, surely every ''overruled'' that can be rapped out with a gavel by a wigged or unwigged member of the judiciary has done its dramatic duty long since. We can smell a trap being baited by a wily D.A., can't we? And hear, virtually by ESP, the innocently admitted shred of evidence that is going to turn as treacherous as an envenomed toad? We may never have passed a bar exam, but we've played this game before."

Former Secretary of State Cyrus Vance, a Yale man, saved the best speech of his long and illustrious career for the Harvard commencement last week. And it seems clear from this carefully and personally written address (the text of which was published by only one or two American newspapers) that Vance resigned, not primarily because he opposed the U.S. military rescue mission in Iran, but because he had deep doubts about the political and military domination of the nations's foreign policy."

Besides, Mr. Carter is beginning to look like a none-too-artful dodger, having already pulled out of a scheduled three-way debate with Mr. Kennedy and Jerry Brown in Iowa, then announcing in advance that he would not permit Representative John Anderson to take part in the Presidential debates next fall."

They did so with the help of a ''message of necessity'' from Governor Carey, a legal device that allows them to circumvent the constitution's requirement that bills wait three days before being considered. In normal times none of this would raise an eyebrow, but these are not normal times in Albany. Passage of those budget bills marked the first time since March 1979 that the Democrat in the Governor's office had come to terms with the Democrats in the Assembly on a matter of money. ''The point is, there is a Democratic position, finally,'' said Robert J. Morgado, the Governor's top aide. ''The focus will be on the Senate, where it properly belongs.''"

Billy could reach the Little League plate and could even make Cass stretch his catcher's mitt high in the air some of the time. But the only reason he was occasionally a pitcher was that someone had to pitch when our regular starter's strong arm died or when our backup faltered; Billy was better than any of the other outfielders or the kids on the bench."

1980-06-08T00:00:00Z,"The theater season has just drawn to a close, and it is a time for awards, some of which have been announced, some of which are to come. Among those just announced are those of the Outer Critics Circle, made up of New York theater writers for the out-of-town press, and the the Drama Desk, whose members cover New York theaters for New York (and elsewhere, too). The Outer Critics bestowed their Distinguished Achievement in Theater Awards on Mark Medoff's ''Children of a Lesser God'' as the most distinguished new production of a drama, and ''Barnum'' as ''the finest example of musical theater and professional skills.'' These critics also cited all the women in ''Mornings at Seven,'' -Nancy Marchand, Maureen O'Sullivan, Elizabeth Wilson, Teresa Wright and Lois deBanzie. Gerald Hiken was singled out for his characterization in ''Strider.''"
1980-06-08T00:00:00Z,"No name means more in the history of American glass than Louis Comfort Tiffany. And no designs from Tiffany's fertile mind and prolific 50-year-long production mean more than the ones he devised for his own country home - Laurelton Hall, in Oyster Bay, L.I. How fitting, therefore, that the first special exhibition at the new Corning Museum of Glass, in Corning N.Y., is ''Tiffany's Tiffany,'' the architectural elements which survived the fire that destroyed the designer's extraordinary residence in 1957. The show of 80 selections, on view through Nov. 2, also includes a score of examples of Tiffany's art glass, his pottery and his stained glasstopped, bronze-based lamps. Thomas S. Buechner, director of the museum which opened in a new home last Sunday, recalls in the foreword to the catalogue on this show that when the museum came into being in 1951, Tiffany Studios was viewed as ''one of several producers of overly ornate, rather theatrical objects.'' All that began to change in 1953 when a revival of interest commenced in the works of this innovator, who had figured prominently as a designer from 1880 to 1930. And judging by the response of the public to this show and the skyrocketing prices in the marketplace, the interest which reached boom proportions more than a decade ago shows no sign of diminishing. ''He imagined, invented and brought into existence a vast oriental bazaar of riches,'' Mr. Buechner continued. ''This exhibition is about the world he made - the best of it, the things he chose to live with himself.''"

1980-06-08T00:00:00Z,"In the aftermath of the Miami riot, black leaders and liberal politicians have advanced with renewed vigor the thesis that race riots result from racial discrimination. This is precisely the wrong lesson to draw from Miami. Clearly, racial discrimination played an important role in igniting the riot - especially the treatment blacks were receiving from the Miami police force - but the roots of racial violence in Miami go far deeper than discrimination. Unlike the race riots in the first half of this century (characterized by direct warfare between whites and blacks), the Miami riot (like New York City's during the 1977 blackout) was marked by the wholesale burning and looting of business establishments, both black- and white-owned. Like the riots of the 1960's, Miami's was primarily a result of class conflict. As Merrett Stierheim, county manager for metropolitan Dade County, said: ''There are probably thousands of jobs lost, of which the majority and probably 99 percent were held by black citizens. The violence was not just aimed at white entrepreneurs. There was no rhyme or reason. The whole community has paid a terrible price.''"

1980-06-08T00:00:00Z,"What Presidential election?'' Charlotte Weaver, a 32-year-old San Francisco graduate student, asked after she cast her ballot Tuesday in the California primary election. ''All I care about are 9, 10 and 11.'' The objects of Miss Weaver's concern - 9, 10 and 11 - were not running for anything; they were ballot propositions related to taxes and rent control. And Miss Weaver's lack of interest in the Presidential race was reflected across the nine states that expressed their Presidential preferences Tuesday in the form of very low voter turnouts."

The most ambitious herb project ever undertaken, the $418,000 garden occupies two acres of what was once a simple meadow. Veteran herbalists, window box gardeners and even the uninitiated will find there the old familiars - the rosemarys and thymes, the lavenders and mints and chives. But there are the more exotic herbs on display: the Chinese toothache tree, whose fruit is used to numb pain in the gums; the Japanese iris, whose roots are ground for face powder; the hops used in beer, the juniper berries used in gin; the paper plant, once used in printing paper money."

1980-06-08T00:00:00Z,"Charles Saxon, a cartoonist for The New Yorker for the last 25 years, has a problem: So many companies have been buying his drawings for their ads that last year he was able to do only 15 cartoons for the magazine, half his usual total. ''I was just swamped with ad assignments and my New Yorker work suffered,'' he said. ''This year, I'm setting aside more time for the magazine, which I consider my home and where I can really express myself.'' So it is with many New Yorker cartoonists. Madison Avenue has become a second home and generous paymaster for artists whose instantly recognizable, light-hearted styles provide an enticing lure for the messages of such big-time advertisers as Mobil Oil, Shell, Dow Chemical, the Bell System, Western Electric, General Electric, American Electric Power, Xerox, American Express, United Airlines, Burlington and Bankers Trust."
1980-06-08T00:00:00Z,"California, which has led the nation in many movements, provided momentum two years ago to the middle-class revolt against taxes when voters in one electrifying day at the polls slashed property taxes by $7 billion a year. Tuesday, the same voters decided almost as decisively - by a margin of about three to one - against cutting their state income taxes in half. Does this signal an end to the tax revolt? Careful analyses of the antitax movement suggest that just as Proposition 13 of 1978 did not start the movement - it had been quietly under way since 1975 - the vote against Proposition 9 and other ballot initiatives, last week, followed a national pattern that demonstrations there are limits to the tax revolt."
1980-06-08T00:00:00Z,"About three million Americans suffer from angina, the pain that arises when blood flow to the heart muscles is inadequate. In a minority of such patients, the angina arises from temporary spasms of the coronary arteries. A study published last week in The New England Journal of Medicine indicates that a drug called nifedipine can be dramatically effective in controlling the disease in those patients. The study included 127 patients over five years, and the researchers, headed by Dr. Eugene Braunwald of Harvard, found attacks had been totally eliminated in 63 percent and reduced by at least half in 87 percent. Only 5 percent had to stop the drug because they could not tolerate the side effects, which include dizziness, flushing and headache. The researchers caution that the study was neither blind nor randomized, but they believe the numbers are persuasive all the same. The study did not examine the majority form of angina, but researchers note that evidence is growing to show that arterial spasm may play a role in many heart diseases."

JOSEPH LASH's ''Helen and Teacher'' is part of the Radcliffe biography series about distinguished American women. It's a risky book in two respects. First of all, the lives of Helen Keller and her teacher Anne Sullivan Macy have already been told. Helen Keller wrote ''The Story of My Life'' and ''Teacher: Anne Sullivan Macy,'' and Nella Braddy did a good biography of Mrs. Macy in the 1930's. And William Gibson dramatized the story in his wonderful play ''The Miracle Worker.'' A second risk is that any book this long - 811 pages, to be exact - is bound to be put in the company of all those fat and mindless biographies we've been getting recently."

From the north it represents a logical side trip from the Great Smoky National Park area. For hikers Dahlonega is about 20 miles from Mount Springer, the southern terminus of the Appalachian Trail. Accommodations in Dahlonega itself are relatively limited. The Smith House, near the center of town, is a pleasant mountain hotel built in the 1890's directly over a gold vein of unknown value. The hotel has only 20 comfortable rooms, starting at $15, so reservations are definitely recom-mended; call 404-864-2348.

His son, Marco, is in hiding as a suspected member of Prima Linea (Front Line), the terrorist organization that calls itself Communist but regards the official Communist Party as its chief enemy. Before a parliamentary commission that probed the disappearance of his son, Mr. Donat-Cattin turned back an embarrassing question from a Communist legislator with the answer: ''Why don't you ask my daughter, she belongs to the same party as you.'' Mr. Donat-Cattin resigned in hopes of preventing an impeachmentlike proceeding against Prime Minister Francesco Cossiga, who has been charged with giving Mr. Donat-Cattin information that allegedly helped him save his son from arrest. In a pointed warning to politicians of all parties, Mr. Donat-Cattin told the parliamentary comission: ''I have a list of 41 (prominent) Italian personalities with sons in the same conditions as mine.''"

Trouble didn't cease, however, though through no fault of Mr. Mester's. The members of the Puerto Rico Symphony Orchestra got into a dispute with the festival management. It could not be resolved, and the festival was canceled. Now the festival is set to reopen this week, the inaugural concert to take place on Tuesday, with Mr. Mester conducting and Zara Nelsova as cello soloist. The revival is taking place under a setup different from that governing the festival in the past. Originally, it existed as part of a Puerto Rican economic-development program.

New York's concertgoers are currently getting a big dose of him at the Basically Bach Festival, now at the midway point in Avery Fisher Hall. While this series offers a generally solid, middle-of-the-road approach to Bach, many other musical paths are open to performers and most of them can be heard on a variety of recent recordings. Karl Richter, who conducts this Friday's concert at Fisher Hall, has recorded dozens of Bach works over the past 25 years with his Munich Bach Choir and Orchestra, the latest being the mighty ''St. Matthew Passion'' (Archiv 2712 005, four disks). Collectors familiar with Mr. Richter's 1959 version will find the new recording different in many details, although the overall view remains the same: large forces, modern instruments, adult as opposed to treble voices and an interpretation firmly grounded in the mainstream Germanic tradition of Bach performance."

While the general public may remain understandably puzzled by all the talk of cable, satellites, cassettes, disks, optical fibers and teletexts, signs of current and eventual dramatic changes in the distribution of information and entertainment have become unmistakable. A recent convention in Dallas of the National Cable Television Association attracted 9,000 enthusiasts of assorted vested interests, up 50 percent from the 6,000 who attended last year's gathering in Las Vegas. Cable is moving toward the 20 percent ''penetration'' level of television homes in this country. Giant corporations such as Time Inc., which owns both Manhattan Cable TV and pay-cable's Home Box Office, are getting heavily into the already profitable act. The commercial networks are banned from owning cable companies, but CBS has announced that it will begin producing programs, or ''software,'' for cable systems."

Since when? A few days ago. How? Several hundred warriors with bows and arrows, led by 50 men with shotguns, locked up the local constabulary. Who is the new president?

I think it is a great honor to be selected for a United States Olympic team, but it should end there. We should not have alternative games, tournaments, tours with the Olympic athletes or exhibitions such as the Gold Medal Games, which match the men's Olympic team against teams of National Basketball Association players."

1980-06-08T00:00:00Z,"Re the recent article ''Cross Sound-Bridge Gets a Boost in Albany'': While it is true that constructing the bridge will have its effects, calling it an ''environmental nightmare,'' in the words of a Bayville village trustee, seems an appeal to mass hysteria. Indeed, is it not environmentally unsound to waste billions of gallons of gasoline annually by forcing travelers to Westchester County, upstate New York or most of the New England states, for that matter, to drive an extra 45 minutes through the Bronx, with its already overly congested arteries? Similarly ironic was Mayor Stapleton's comment that the Legislature (by proposing the idea for the bridge) ''is listening to pressure groups and not the people.'' One must remember that a group of North Shore residents exerted so much pressure themselves in 1973 that they forced Nelson Rockefeller, the original advocate for the bridge, to completely reverse his position on this issue. Incidentally, that is why the Seaford-Oyster Bay Expressway ends abruptly a few hundred yards north of Jericho Turnpike."

The state signifies a host of different things to different people, but among the most celebrated facts about it is that it has one of the oldest and most traveled turnpikes in the country and that it and New York are landlords of the Lincoln and Holland Tunnels. Turnpikes and tunnels mean toll booths. George Segal, one of New Jersey's most celebrated artists, undoubtedly had this in mind when he was commissioned by the Newark Museum, one of state's most celebrated museums, to create a sculpture."

Singularly absent from Mr. Arlen's fine book is the self-righteous, preening tone that runs through Mr. De-Mott's review. Mr. DeMott admits that as a ''schoolteacher'' he doesn't have ''a wide acquaintance among advertising folk,'' but that his glancing impression convinces him that this ''breed'' cannot ''speak, write or reason'' at a complex level. And yet, he claims, ''these people'' consider themselves ''important thinkers.''"

Cocktails will precede a filet mignon dinner and dancing. The idea is to get away from it all, as is the idea behind the cure for the New York City youngsters aged 5 to 13 whose cure for their asthma is to get them to Ossining, N.Y., for 33 acres of fresh air in the foundation's 36-bed residential treatment center. Just getting the children away from their environment works better than the drugs they took before going for the country cure, from which they return home after several months. The return home after 11:30 from tonight's cruise is by chartered bus to points along the Upper East Side of Manhattan. Some passengers will bring back raffle prizes that include a pair of round-trip plane tickets to Paris, a week for two at Safety Harbor Spa in Florida, and an oil portrait to be done of the ticketholder or of the person he or she chooses.

This time, things are a little different. Oil consumption has slowed in the sluggish economies of Western nations. OPEC estimates that world oil inventories have reached 5.3 billion barrels and Saudi Arabia is warning that such a surplus could threaten prices. Some OPEC prices now range $10 a barrel over Saudi Arabia's $28, and the Saudis want OPEC to get back to a united front by reunifying prices. The Saudis may try to close the gap by raising their price moderately. In the past, however, this tactic has only caused other OPEC members to match the increase."

1980-06-08T00:00:00Z,"A great many pianists come to New York at this time of year to make their debuts. They are almost always well trained, and many of them are obviously talented. Some rise above their colleagues in how well and originally they communicate. One of the latter is Jeffrey Chappell, who appeared at Abraham Goodman House on Wednesday night. A native of St. Louis, a pupil of Leon Fleisher at the Peabody Conservatory and Eleanor Sokoloff at the Curtis Institute, he is now on the faculty of Peabody and Goucher College in Baltimore. Mr. Chappell ended his program with a reading of Ravel's ''Gaspard de la Nuit'' which was one of the finest this writer has heard. It was not the glittering kind of performance ordinarily expected and given. Instead, it was carefully observant of the composer's detailed markings. The result was, for one thing, more muted. Ravel calls for pianissimo playing a lot oftener than pianists are willing to give. Mr. Chappell did everything that was asked. ''Ondine,'' the first piece in ''Gaspard,'' was mistlike in its fine-grained soft pianism, making the big arpeggio eruptions more dramatic than ever. ''Scarbo,'' the final piece, had a genuine mysteriousness."
1980-06-08T00:00:00Z,"The opening of a major exhibition called ''Post-Impressionism'' at the National Gallery of Art (through Sept. 1) has inevitably focused attention on both the origin and the meaning of this term, which for 70 years has served as a staple in the critical and art historical discussion of modernist painting. Because the present exhibition - organized by a team of scholars led by Alan Bowness, the new director of the Tate Gallery in London - proposes such a sweeping revision of the very notion of what the term can be taken to signify, it is important that we understand what, until now, Post-Impressionism has been generally taken to be. It was in November 1910 that this term was first used in the title of an exhibition organized by Roger Fry at the Grafton Galleries in London. The exhibition was called ''Manet and the Post-Impressionists,'' and it gave the British public its first serious look at the decisive changes that had occurred in French avant-garde painting since Gauguin, Van Gogh, Cezanne and Seurat had initiated a revolt against the tenets of Impressionism in the 1880's. Manet had been included as a way of indicating that the revoltes of the 80's, although highly original in their own right, could be seen to be upholding a pictorial tradition that the more naturalistic, ''scientific'' aspects of Impressionism had departed from."

The plan - announced with much fanfare not long ago as a joint effort of Suffolk County Executive Peter F. Cohalan and Representative Thomas J. Downey - called for creation of an independent authority to buy the sewer project from the county. Through an intricate refinancing plan backed by a Federal loan guarantee, the authority, it was hoped, might be able to save the county as much as $303 million over the next 30 years and avoid the politically unpalatable step of using $197 million in county sales tax revenues, beginning in 1982, to help pay for the $932 million project."

Some, like Love Canal in Niagara Falls, N.Y., whose lineage happens to be well documented, are deteriorating. Their poisons are slowly seeping into the ecosystem, posing the same sort of serious but little-understood threat to life that Love Canal has already inflicted on the hapless residents nearby. Nationwide, these troublesome sites run at least into the hundreds. There may be thousands; new ones seem to crop up weekly. Last month, a school in Islip, L.I., built near a landfill site, was closed when authorities discovered traces of a cancer-causing gas in the basement cafeteria. A few days later, the residents of Aurora, Mo., learned that a herbicide waste had leaked from drums buried on a nearby farm and may have contaminated well water. Then a report from Youngstown, Pa., said industrial chemicals had leaked from barrels stored in a warehouse and were threatening the water supply. And late last week, the Environmental Protection Agency said conditions at more than 100 of the 645 sites it has surveyed so far pose a serious threat to some 600,000 people.

A NUMBER of recent magazine articles have called attention to the growing predominance of more conservative views among the leading economists of the younger generation. Lester Thurow, professor of economics and management at M.I.T., remains a notable exception to this trend. Widely re-garded as the most talented of the younger liberal economists, Mr. Thurow has also demonstrated considerable gifts at writing for a popular audience, as well as a willingness to address an impressive range of ethical, political and economic issues.

Anita Strauss, violinist and one of the orchestra's founders, discussed how things have changed in the year: ''For one thing, we've maintained most of the same players through this whole period, so we have been able to grow into a cohesive unit. In other words, even though we started out just looking for a fun way of meeting new friends through music - and it still is a more sociable experience for us than you'll find in most orchestras - we're a real ensemble now. It has been an exciting thing to watch the development as the musicians get more and more used to our conductor, Mati Lazar, and he gets to know exactly what he can expect from us. At this point, we all have high hopes of becoming a permanent fixture of the arts scene in the county.''"

Joseph Murray, you see, was a private in the First Regiment of the Monmouth Militia, and during the Revolutionary War he fell before the muskets of three Tories. There will be Colonial craft demonstrations, a display by the Brigade of the American Revolution (the volunteers who dress and drill in Continental Army fashion) and a tour of a farmhouse. The tour will be a fitting touch because, when Private Murray met his end, he was plowing a field behind his barn in what is now Poricy Park."

1980-06-08T00:00:00Z,"Following are excerpts from some commencement addresses this spring: The surface of the earth is ever increasingly becoming a fragile membrane, and the destruction of the James River is like an agonizing and perhaps irremediable rip which tears across the membrane, leaving its ugly infection to fester for untold decades. William Styron, author, at Hampden-Sydney College in Virginia. Good will and humility are two qualities that, as far as I know, have never really been seriously used in trying to make and keep the peace on this interdependent planet. Pauline Frederick, NBC correspondent, at Fairleigh Dickinson U. in Madison, N.J."
1980-06-08T00:00:00Z,"Officials of a sleepy South Pacific archipelago blamed outsiders last week for disturbances that threatened to spoil New Hebrides independence day on July 30. Backed by plantation workers armed with bows and arrows, 50 French-speaking islanders proclaimed a separatist provisional government on Espiritu Santo, largest of 74 islands in a chain with 100,000 people. Fearful that the English-speaking New Hebrides majority would break up their estates, they promised an international tax haven - protected, they hope, by the French Navy. Their chief minister, Jimmy Stevens, had lined up support in Paris, Los Angeles and Carson City, Nev."
1980-06-08T00:00:00Z,"THE bankers are restless. In the big, yellow ballroom with nine chandeliers and one potted plant, their morning has passed slowly, filled with ""pre cipitous declines"" and other ""harsh market realities."" They need a break."
1980-06-08T00:00:00Z,"The Appellate Division of the State Supreme Court, First Department, has halted the conversion of the Vermeer apartment house at 77 Seventh Avenue in Manhattan until the Appellate Division can hear arguments on the case Friday."
1980-06-08T00:00:00Z,"Like the Battle of Britain and other crises in the history of human civilization, the New York City transit strike brought to the surface a hidden reserve of human potential that usually ramains submerged."
1980-06-08T00:00:00Z,"The Federal Reserve is becoming everyone's whipping boy. If one listens to the Fed's critics, it seems that our central bank can never do anything right. There are those who claim that the Fed is largely responsible for our miserable inflation record--some extremists say the Fed is exclusively to ..."
1980-06-08T00:00:00Z,THE Nassau Republican County Committee not only is the most prosperous county political or ganization in the state--and maybe the country--but also is helping the nearly bankrupt Republican State Committee stay afloat.
1980-06-08T00:00:00Z,The Board of Estimate made an urban-renewal decision affecting the Lower East Side several weeks ago that would have been unthinkable at any time over the last 15 years. A majority rejected a plan to complete the Seward Park Extension project that had been approved by the local community board and by a prestigious Chinatown group.
1980-06-08T00:00:00Z,"In the modern world those who despair of reaching their goals by orthodox sensible means sometimes resort to a long shot: They do something absurd, or dramatic, or vio lent. This rerely serves to achieve the desired result, but rarely does not mean never."
1980-06-08T00:00:00Z,"VILA, New Hebrides, June 7 (Reuters) --The New Hebrides Government has formally asked Britain and France to send troops to put down a rebellion on the island of Espiritu Santo, Chief Minister Walter Lini said tonight."
1980-06-08T00:00:00Z,"WASHINGTON--""No man in this country is so high that he is above the law,"" the United States Supreme Court declared in 1882. For most of the century that followed, that noble pronouncement remained an empty promise for private citizens seeking legal redress from a government official who had violated their legal or constitutional rights."
1980-06-08T00:00:00Z,"THE Warnaco Outlet is a manufacturer's sale location with White Stag, Hathaway, Ro sanne, Puritan, Thane and Warner's own surplus merchandise along with that of some of Warner's signature licensees, among them Christian Dior and Ralph Lauren Chaps. Preinventory sales are held in spring and autumn."
1980-06-08T00:00:00Z,"LONDON, June 7 (Reuters)--Three exiled Palestinian leaders appealed to the European Economic Community today to press the United States and Israel to end the Israeli occupation of the West Bank."
1980-06-08T00:00:00Z,"EAGER to avoid the vacation ritual of putting her valuables in the safe deposit box, putting the dog in a kennel and notify ing the police and the mailman, Elizabeth Kimberly decided to seek a solution to the problem of leaving the house empty for a few weeks."
1980-06-08T00:00:00Z,"THERE will be diversions of every sort available within Westchester this summer, many of them offering amenities and activities special to the area."
1980-06-08T00:00:00Z,"REGARDLESS of the planning and tender loving care given a flower garden, midsummer often brings forth a failure or two. A winter-weakened perennial might fail to survive, or unfavorable ..."
1980-06-08T00:00:00Z,"REGARDLESS of the planning and tender loving care given a flower garden, midsummer often brings forth a failure or two. A winter-weakened perennial might fail to survive, or unfavorable weather may bring about the demise of a tender, newly planted annual."

1980-06-08T00:00:00Z,"BRIDGEPORT CLOWNS and calliopes and bare back riders hardly seem to suggest affinity with images of towering trees, green grass and cool water rippling against a sandy shore. The vivid imagination fired by daring aspiration that could create ..."
1980-06-08T00:00:00Z,"Top Democratic county leaders will very likely arrange the voting at Thursday's state committee meeting so that each of the three contenders for the Democratic nomination for United States Senate, Representative Eliza beth Holtzman, John V. Lindsay and Bess Myerson, gets at least 25 percent of the vote and thus automati cally qualifies for the Sept. 9 primary. Miss Myerson is favored to win a second ballot majority and thus become the official state committee designee. A week later, the Republicans will meet to designate their candidate, and aides of the incumbent, Jacob K. Javits, are tempted to try some arranging of their own. The Senator appears assured of a majority vote for himself while another Republican Senate hopeful, Alfonse M. D'Amato, the Presiding Supervisor of the Town of Hempstead, L.I., seems assured of at least a 25 percent vote, largely because of his solid support in Nassau and Suffolk Counties. The two counties account for just under 20 percent of the vote alone. That leaves Bruce Caputo, a former United States Representatives from Westchester, with almost no organization support, even in his home county. It is generally believed that if Mr. Caputo were on the ballot, he and Mr. D'Amato would very likely split any anti-Javits vote. That is why downstate Republican county chairmen and Conservative Party leaders who are supporting Mr. D'Amato are pressuring Mr. Caputo to stay out of the race, while aides of Javits are tempted to give him a helping hand at the state committee meeting. It would require careful maneuvering, by which Mr. Javits would stop short of a majority on the first ballot, divert Javits votes to Mr. Caputo so that each of the three candidates would receive at least 25 percent to qualify for the ballot and then move for the majority on a second ballot and the state committee's designation. There is another option for Mr. Caputo. He could get on the ballot by collecting designating petitions. But he conceded that his principal paid political advisers - Roger Stone and Charles Black, both of whom played key roles in Ronald Reagan's drive for the Presidential nomination - had told him he would need $75,000 for a petition drive and at least 10 times that much for a credible primary campaign. Mr. Caputo said he was still considering, but he sounded as if he were leaning out of the race unless lightning struck at the state committee meeting. Mr. D'Amato will spend $100,000 on television commercials in the next 10 days to demonstrate to Republican state committeemen that he is a viable challenger of the Senator. Three commercials produced by Werner Steibel, producer of William F. Buckley's ''Firing Line'' television program, try to cast Mr. D'Amato as a real Republican and the liberal Senator Javits an ersatz Republican."
1980-06-08T00:00:00Z,"JoAnn Marie Heffernan and Richard Frederick Heisen of Bronxville, N.Y., were married yesterday in the Community Church of Pound Ridge, N. Y. The Rev. Richard Monkman, a Methodist minister, performed the ceremony. The bride is the daughter of Jeanne Berger Heffernan of Silver Spring, Md., and the late Milton F. Heffernan. Mr. and Mrs. Carl Heisen of Pound Ridge are the parents of the bridegroom."
1980-06-08T00:00:00Z,"Gary Matthews belted a two-run homer, and Larvell Blanks hit a three-run double tonight to help the Atlanta Braves gain a 6-1 victory over the Los Angeles Dodgers. Matthews hit his fifth home run of the season in the third inning off the Dodger starter, Dave Goltz, following a single by Chris Chambliss."
1980-06-08T00:00:00Z,"IN this most confusing of all Olympic years, with the United States' boycott and talk of alternatives and with the mixing of politics and sports, the bottom line for many of us who have been involved is the concern for the athlete. When the decision became final in April that the United States would not send a team to Moscow, it was also evident that no viable alternative program was on the horizon."
1980-06-08T00:00:00Z,"ALEASE arrangement by which the county would pay $48 million to rent a bus garage for 20 years has come under sharp attack as the transaction nears conclusion. Critics of the plan, most of them financial and real-estate specialists, are charging that the administration of County Executive Alfred B. DelBello is being overly generous in its proposed terms, to the point of providing a ''windfall'' for the group of private investors, the AGR Realty Company, who would build the garage. AGR is a partnership whose principal members are also the owners of Liberty Lines, the largest bus operation in the county. The bus garage, which would be Westchester's largest single capital project to date in the field of transportation, would be built in Yonkers at the site of the former Phelps Dodge Cable and Wire Company at 475 Saw Mill River Road, in an old industrial neighborhood."
1980-06-08T00:00:00Z,"BORN the year President John F. Kennedy was assassinated, they entered the first grade at the height of the demonstrations against the Vietnam war; junior high school when the oil crisis broke and high school during the surge of patriotism that accompanied the Bicentennial. Today they don cap and gown to become the first high school graduating class of the 1980's. What are they planning for the future? What are their career preferences? How do they feel about their country? About politics? About the climate of changing moral values? And what do they see as the legacy of their school careers?"
1980-06-08T00:00:00Z,"Detroit's economic troubles may turn out to be a windfall for Atlanta's understaffed Police Department. Largely because of the worsening slump in the automobile industry, city officials here are predicting a budget deficit that could reach $140 million by next June. As a result, Detroit will lay off 700 of its 3,600 police officers by the year's end; 400 were let go last October. Many officers affected by last fall's layoff have taken temporary jobs outside police work in the hope that they will be called back. But as the economic picture grows worse, an increasing number feel that their best option is to leave town."
1980-06-08T00:00:00Z,"Two days after he had apparently sewn up the Democratic nomination for President last week, Jimmy Carter found himself in the position of a victor suing for peace with the vanquished. But after a 45-minute meeting at the White House, Senator Edward M. Kennedy remained unreconstructed, declaring his intent to carry his fight for the nomination to the Democratic national convention in August. The spectacle set party leaders to much wringing of hands. National Democratic chairman John C. White, referring to the party split that contributed to the defeat of the late Hubert H. Humphrey by Richard M. Nixon in 1968, warned: ''I think if we continue this division past the convention, we could do to Jimmy Carter what we did to Hubert Humphrey.''"
1980-06-08T00:00:00Z,"Many plans aimed at making Times Square something more than a breeding ground for prostitutes, pornographers and drug pushers have been announced with great fanfare over the years, only to fade without making a dent in the sleaze. Barring a sudden change of heart by the Koch Administration, yet another such plan, perhaps the grandest ever, is likely to meet a similar fate. ''Effectively, we're out of business for now, at least until the city makes some decisions,'' said Donald H. Elliott recently. Mr. Elliott, former head of the City Planning Commission and president of The City at 42d Street, acknowledged the setback after members of his group met with Mayor Koch and learned that the city was withholding support. Last week, the Mayor cast further doubt on the plan when he announced that he favored competitive bidding, a time-consuming process that Mr. Elliott said would kill his efforts."
1980-06-08T00:00:00Z,"At a time when the American tourist industry is in a state of turmoil, keeping its fingers crossed while waiting to see what effect the twin evils of inflation and unemployment will have this summer, one segment of that industry is more than holding its own: That which caters to overseas visitors. This is expected to be the first year in which the number of overseas visitors to the United States exceeds United States citizen departures to overseas destinations. Estimates by the Commerce Department's U.S. Travel Service are that visits by foreigners will be up by 8 percent this year, to 21.6 million - more than 13 million from Mexico and Canada, and 8 million-plus from Europe, South America and Asia. Last year about a million Britons and a million Japanese visited the United States, and more are expected this year from both countries."
1980-06-08T00:00:00Z,"To the Sports Editor: I am writing in regard to the May 27 article about Eric Heiden in the Memorial Day bicycle race in Somerville, N.J. Part of the headline read ''Heiden Fails Again.'' You were right about the flat tire he had, but that was not his fault; at least he changed it and got back in the race. That is anything but failure. As he was trying to catch up with the other racers after the tire incident, he was far behind, but the crowd was cheering him on; they really wanted him to pull ahead."
1980-06-08T00:00:00Z,"THE FIRST BOOK OF EPPE An American Romance. By Roderick MacLeish. 354 pp. New York: Random House. $9.95. THE LOVE RUN By Jay Parini. 220 pp. Boston: Atlantic-Little, Brown. $10.95. THE QUARTZSITE TRIP By William Hogan. 307 pp. New York: Atheneum. $10.95."
1980-06-08T00:00:00Z,"MIDDLETOWN BECAUSE of a continuing decline in mathematics skills among graduates of Connecticut high schools, businessmen say, many manufacturing jobs in the state are going unfilled, or are ultimately filled with workers who need extensive training. In what was billed as the first meeting of its kind, business leaders and mathematics teachers got together at Wesleyan University recently to address the problem of why Johnny and Jane can't add. Or subtract, or multiply, or divide."
1980-06-08T00:00:00Z,"ST. JAMES THE restoration and rehabilitation of the Mills Pond House for use as a community arts center is a striking example of the current efforts of preservationists to save old buildings by giving them new uses. An imposing Greek Revival structure on Route 25A in St. James, the house was built in 1838-40 for William Wickham Mills, a prominent Smithtown landowner and farmer. The house served as a Mills family residence until it was given to the Town of Smithtown in 1976 by three Mills descendants."
1980-06-08T00:00:00Z,"This letter is in regard to Vivien Raynor's review on Sunday, May 11, of the Connecticut and American Impressionism show (''A Full Portrait of American Impressionism''). As an art historian and author of several publications on American Impressionism, not the least of which centered upon the life and art of William Chadwick, I was amazed at Miss Raynor's estimation of the Chadwick painting, ''On the Porch,'' in the Lyme Historical Society collection."
1980-06-08T00:00:00Z,"On the cover of this month's Philadelphia Magazine, one of the most successfully irreverent of the country's city periodicals, there is a large color photograph of a smiling Mayor William J. Green, posed under studio lights in his dark gray mayoral suit, gold cuff links and boxing gloves, His left jab protrudes menacingly out from under a headline that says: ''Time to Get Tough - Bill Green Puts on the Gloves.'' But the Mayor's left eyelid is dropped in a ''don't-you-believeit'' Irish wink that says he is pulling his punch, at least this photographic one."
1980-06-08T00:00:00Z,"Judith Lynn Gilbert, daughter of Peter Gilbert of Buffalo and Shirley Gilbert of New York, was married yesterday to Neal Burton Rubin, son of Mr. and Mrs. Donald Rubin of Holyoke, Mass. The ceremony was performed at the Tavern on the Green by Rabbi Barry Friedman. He was assisted by Cantor Jerrold Held. The bride and her husband are graduates of Brandeis University. She will be attending Columbia University's Graduate School of Social Work in the fall and Mr. Rubin is a candidate for a master's degree at the Harvard Graduate School of Business Administration."
1980-06-08T00:00:00Z,"SINCE last summer, Sunday afternoons have become a popular time for celebration and merriment at the Long Wharf Restaurant in Sag Harbor. Highly animated dancing and a near-bacchanal atmosphere often prevail. The catalyst for such abandon is a seven-man group spearheaded by the melodious steel drums and raspy vocals of Vivian Walsh, a resident of the tiny Caribbean island Dominica until he moved to the Island 16 years ago. When the unit - called the Merrymakers Steel Band - is playing, the harbor breezes are so resplendent with Caribbean sounds that any arriving boat crew might well imagine it had dropped anchor in the wrong port."
1980-06-08T00:00:00Z,"A lie detector test has ''absolutely eliminated'' any possibility that Martha C. Coleman was involved with the shooting of Vernon E. Jordan Jr., the civil rights leader, her attorney said today. Charles F. Leonard told reporters that his client gave a satisfactory answer to every question asked of her in a two-hour polygraph test conducted yesterday morning by the Federal Bureau of Investigation."
1980-06-08T00:00:00Z,"To welcome summer we have stamps for the flowers in full bloom, stamps for the many birds in the sky, and for the fish that abound in our waters. A lush, color-rich grouping of a garden bed of numerous flowers in summer bloom has made a timely appearance on a new commemorative from Canada. It is a 17-cent rectangular that does more than recognize the popularity of gardening in Canada, both the hobby of growing flowers and, increasingly, food gardening. It calls attention to Les Floralies Internationales de Montreal, an ornamental horticulture show described as the ''greatest floral exhibition ever staged in North America.'' The exhibition runs to Sept.1."
1980-06-08T00:00:00Z,"Ideally, there ought to be no reason why Jews cannot go up to a state-owned hilltop of untilled, stony land two or three miles from an Arab village and live there in peace. But it has turned out to be impossible. The barriers of religion, language, ethnicity and national identity are too strong, the suspicions too deep, the political conflict too tangled and intense. The rifts that run through all the ancient, bloody history of the Holy Land are as enduring as the stone. Still, about 20,000 Israeli Jews have tried to put down roots in Arab territories captured in the 1967 war. Their settlements, scattered across the Gaza Strip, the Golan Heights, the Jordan Valley and the rolling hills of the West Bank have raised tensions and created points of friction to which the most extreme combatants on both sides have been drawn, like moths to a flame. Last week, the dispute took a grave turn when the three Palestinian mayors most vehemently opposed to settlements became the targets, and in two cases, the victims, of bombs that investigators believe were planted by Jews."
1980-06-08T00:00:00Z,"Jim Watt of Scotland retained his World Boxing Council lightweight title today by outpointing Howard Davis of Glen Cove, L.I., in 15 rounds. It was the third successful defense for the 31-year-old champion, who built a commanding lead over the American in the early rounds before winning a unanimous verdict from the three judges."
1980-06-08T00:00:00Z,"I thoroughly enjoyed William Wilson's article on the latest incarnation of the horror story a la Stanley Kubrick and Stephen King (''Riding the Crest of the Horror Craze,'' May 11). Mr. Kubrick's perception of the essential ''optimism'' of ghost stories (after all, he said, they show that we don't die) was disquieting. It reminded me of what the late Alfred Hitchcock once said: ''If you could bring back the dead, what would you do with them?'' Horror upon horror, Mr. Kubrick, I fear we shall all soon see. RICK SCHULTZ, New Haven"
1980-06-08T00:00:00Z,"While it may not exactly be the fastest-growing special-interest group around, the Long Island Dairy Goat Association is alive and well and planning a show today in Yaphank. Complete with milking demonstrations and goat-cart rides, the event will get under way at 10 A.M. at the Suffolk County Farm, Exit 66 on the Long Island Expressway, and it won't cost visitors a cent to see what's new in goatdom. STRAWBERRY FARE"
1980-06-08T00:00:00Z,"HARTFORD THIS city will shortly be the richer by an important new building on its west side - the Hartford Seminary Foundation, designed by Richard Meier. Pending its completion, Mr. Meier is on view as both architect and artist in the Matrix Gallery of the Wadsworth Atheneum. His show, which continues through next Sunday, was organized by Jane Dillenberger, a guest curator, and features a model and seven drawings for the seminary, all on view for the first time. It also includes the models and drawings for Mr. Meier's Bronx Developmental Center in New York (1976) and the Atheneum in New Harmony (1979), the Indiana town that became famous in the early 19th century as a Utopian community. Last but not least, there is a group of nine collages dating from 1960 to 1978."
1980-06-08T00:00:00Z,"Maj. Gen. Thomas Hearn, retired, the chief of staff to Gen. Joseph W. Stilwell in Asia in World War II, died Wednesday. He was 89 years old. General Hearn graduated from West Point in 1915 and was a member of the Army's Mexican Punitive Expedition in 1915-17. In World War I he served in France. From March 1942 to October 1944 he was General Stilwell's top aide in the China-Burma-India Theater of Operations."
1980-06-08T00:00:00Z,"Deborah Lynne Campbell, daughter of Mr. and Mrs. Frederick MacGregor Campbell Jr. of Old Greenwich, Conn., was married yesterday to William Lockhart Garwood Jr., son of Justice Garwood of the Texas Supreme Court and Mrs. Garwood of Austin. The Rev. Dr. Bradford Hastings of Christ Episcopal Church in Greenwich performed the ceremony at the Campbell home. Louise S. Sams was maid of honor. Lewis N. Little Jr. was best man. The bride was graduated form Princeton University, where she was a member of Cap and Gown. Her father is president of Campbell Associates, a New York sports marketing concern. The bride is a granddaughter of Mr. and Mrs. Frederick MacGregor Campbell of Lewes, Del., and Mr. and Mrs. Allen Sharpe Mullin of Palm Beach, Fla. Mr. Campbell is retired president of the Delaware River and Bay Pilots Association. Mr. Mullin, also retired, was head of production of the Link Belt Company in Philadelphia."
1980-06-08T00:00:00Z,"Many people think innocently of classical music as a realm of timeless masterpieces, immune to the ripples of fashion that make popular music so fickle. But fashions flourish in classical music, too - not so obviously but perhaps even more insidiously. Take the case of Karl Richter, who will be conducting a Bach and Handel program at Avery Fisher Hall this Friday, as part of the Basically Bach Festival. Mr. Richter has an honored name among Baroque enthusiasts for his many fine concert tours and recordings. His concert Friday is almost sure to be direct and honest in a manner that will give most members of the audience a taste of ''timelessness.'' But it is possible to see in Mr. Richter's career the rise and fall of a whole style of Baroque performance, one that seemed revolutionary 25 years ago and seems old-fashioned today. Mr. Richter is fully aware of that drama, and bitter about it."
1980-06-08T00:00:00Z,"Once again, that perennial budget battle - guns vs. butter - has broken out. But this year there's a difference. Not only is broad economic territory being fought over, the combatants are more than usually conscious of another campaign, the Presidential. Finally, there is a growing sense that the victor's spoils are diminishing. The conflict was dramatically highlighted a little more than a week ago when President Carter announced he would oppose Congress' first attempt at delineating Government spending for the 1981 fiscal year because it gave too much to the military at the expense of social programs. But fiscal priorities have overtly and covertly dominated the Congressional budget process for more than a year, as economic stringency and military needs clashed. The issue seems as unlikely to vanish. All three Presidential candidates are firmly committed to limiting Government spending."
1980-06-08T00:00:00Z,"THE United States Open, the nation's No. 1 golf tournament, returns this Thursday to the Baltusrol Golf Club, one of the oldest and most luxurious clubs in the world. Legend and tradition are revered there, and wealth is the passkey. Baltusrol's sprawling Tudor clubhouse sits, staid and stately, atop a commanding bluff. Its interior of chandeliers, dark beams and paneling, thick rugs and wide, creaking staircases evokes the milieu of an earlier, courtlier era."
1980-06-08T00:00:00Z,A 27-year-old woman was stabbed to death in her bed in a Queens hospital yesterday by an intruder who escaped through an emergency exit.
1980-06-08T00:00:00Z,"END OF THE ROAD--If you driveto Fairbanks, you will find the directions are easy: Get on the highway, head northwest and stop only when you come to the end of the road."
1980-06-08T00:00:00Z,"""It's--well--gorgeous,"" said Barry Ingham, a Salt Lake City insurance executive, searching for the right superlative to describe Lake Powell in southern Utah. He and his family were casting off their 43-foot houseboat to spend a week cruising the sandstone cliff-edged waterways that break off the vast lake."
1980-06-08T00:00:00Z,"I should like to offer some thoughts on problems that have been troubling me and discuss the way they appear to me here in Gorky, a city closed to foreigners, in the depths of the Soviet Union, where I now live under vigilant surveillance by the K.G.B."
1980-06-08T00:00:00Z,"The recycling of older sections of cities into quaint shopping centers is an idea that is spreading across Canada. Among the cities having one or more streets restored to former glory are Halifax, Nova Scotia; Victoria and Vancouver, British Columbia; Hamilton, Toronto and Ottawa, Ontario, and Montreal and Quebec City, Quebec."
1980-06-08T00:00:00Z,"SPRINGFIELD THE United States Open, the na tion's No. 1 golf tournament, returns this Thursday to the Baltusrol Golf Club, one of the oldest and most luxurious clubs in the world. Legend and tradition are revered there, and wealth is the passkey."
1980-06-08T00:00:00Z,A LEASE arrangement by which the county would pay $48 million to rent a bus garage for 20 years has come under sharp attack as the transaction nears conclusion.
1980-06-08T00:00:00Z,"WASHINGTON--Once again, that perennial budget battle--guns vs. butter--has broken out. But this year, there is a difference in how the lines have been drawn. New limits on economic resources and the strains of another campaign, the Presidential, have complicated and muddied the field."
1980-06-08T00:00:00Z,"A citizens' group that last year predicted worsening conditions on the Conrail commuter lines issued a follow-up report yesterday, saying quality of service had indeed been declining ""precipitously."" It concluded, as it had last year, that only a massive infusion of funds for maintenance could prevent further deterioration."
1980-06-08T00:00:00Z,"When Mary Anthony came to New York for the first time, a friend introduced her to an astrologer who prophesied that she would spend her life in theater and education. The prophecy came true."
1980-06-08T00:00:00Z,"A prominent architect who 50 years ago designed the huge Art Deco grillwork over the main entrance of the Bonwit Teller Building, now under demolition on Fifth Avenue, expressed astonishment yesterday that a real estate developer had lost track of the elaborate solid nickel ornament."
1980-06-08T00:00:00Z,"The Western Electric Company agreed today to pay $8.5 million to settle two class-action job discrimination cases covering all 4,150 female employees at its 11 offices and factories in New Jersey. In addition, the company consented to implement a four-year affirmative-action plan that will open to women higher-paying jobs in managerial, craft and a variety of other categories at two production plants that employ 2,200 women in a work force of 5,900. Those plants are in Kearny and Clark."
1980-06-08T00:00:00Z,"T20The big hit of the Spoleto Festival in Charleston has been the one-act ''Monsieur Choufleuri'' at the Dock Theater. One could see, during this jewel-like production, why Offenbach was called ''the Mozart of the Champs-Elysees.'' The score is witty, wonderfully melodious, and it also has a hilarious parody of Italian opera. If Offenbach was no Daumier, he was at least a Cruikshank, with an infallible but affectionate eye toward the absurdities of man and, even, music. Take that Italian parody. As Chrysodule Babylas explains to M. Choufleuri, who has to impersonate the great baritone Antonio Tamburini, it is not necessary to know the music. All that an Italian baritone has to do is sing ''bim-bum'' while pounding on his stomach. Baritones and basses do not have to do anything else. And so Choufleuri does, and carries it off brilliantly. If ''Monsieur Choufleuri'' has been universally loved, the Conrad Susa ''Transformations'' has given some listeners trouble, and at several performances a mini-exodus has been reported. But that is par for any intellectual stage piece. Yet ''Transformations'' has had musicians at Spoleto U.S.A. doing some serious thinking about the piece. Some like it, some have reservations, but all seem to agree that Mr. Susa has written a theater piece that cannot be easily dismissed."

1980-06-08T00:00:00Z,"The day may be drawing to a close when travel agents perform most of their services at no charge to their clients. A conviction appears to be growing among agencies that they can no longer survive on commissions alone. Many agents complain that the 8 to 11 percent commission that they receive for selling a plane ticket is not fair compensation for the amount of time they must spend on keeping up with constantly changing air fares, placing reservations and making sure that clients get the best deal possible. The question of charging the customer has been a long-simmering issue in the trade, but it comes to a boil again now mainly under the pressure created by today's confusing air-fare structure."

Those who started yesterday in the 3,000-mile Observer singlehanded trans-Atlantic race from Plymouth, England, to Newport, R.I., embarked on what is considered one of the more rugged sporting events. To sail alone on a small boat across the ocean is to face the constantly changing seas and winds, and to thrive on it requires a certain spirit."

He and his family were casting off their 43-foot houseboat to spend a week cruising the sandstone cliffedged waterways that break off the vast lake. For five years, the Inghams's weeklong cruises have been seamless experiences, unmarred by the usual maintenance headaches and timeconsuming preparations that preoccupy most boat owners. Unlike most vacationers, the Inghams are among 250,000 persons in this country who participate in an unusual real estate scheme that allows them to buy vacation property only for so long as they need it. When their vacation is over, they turn the management details over to someone else."

The state's 54-member delegation, which is split with 29 delegates for Mr. Kennedy and 25 for Mr. Carter, averted what had threatened to become a nasty fight last month by giving Governor Grasso, the President's staunchest supporter in the state, the title of chairman of the convention delegation but giving Representative Anthony Toby Moffett, a Kennedy delegate, control over the delegation's microphone and telephones on the convention floor."

Two weeks after their collision at the head of the homestretch in the Preakness, the two thoroughbreds confronted each other only twice during the return bout. They broke from the starting gate side by side from adjoining 27-inch stalls along the railing. And a mile down the track, they finally came head-to-head as all of 10 horses in the Belmont Stakes maneuvered for the stretch run toward first prize of $176,220."

Barbaro, Democrat of Brooklyn, said this week that the stock investments ''yielded a meager 2.2 percent return'' annually. Emphasizing that the investments could have earned more in a bank savings account, Mr. Barbero said that he would introduce four bills that would significiantly reduce the control that the Comptroller has over pension investments in the stock market."

Praline-sweet hostesses, adorned in the hoop skirts of the antebellum South, met the arrivals at the airport and brought them to a reception room heavily guarded by a corps of uniformed New Orleans policemen. Not only did the policemen protect the guests from around the world, but they also served as their porters and chauffeurs. The delegates were driven in unmarked police cars to their hotels.

The 39-year-old Texan, at 5 feet 1 1/2 inches one of the shortest women and shortest hitters on the tour, landed on all greens in regulation despite gusts up to 25 miles an hour.

At these levels, my gold should be worth who knows what. As reason returned, it became apparent that my rise in net worth could be measured in pennies. Nevertheless, I still felt exhilarated. Taking some more sand and gravel, I started another panning. I was acting out this lifetime fantasy in Dahlonega, Ga., a friendly mountain community 70 miles northeast of Atlanta. As a correspondent for the trade publication American Metals Market, I had a professional interest in precious metals and my visit to Dahlonega (pronounced dah-LON-ega) was long overdue because it was here, in the foothills of the Blue Ridge, that the first real gold rush in United States history took place - two decades earlier than the California Gold Rush. I was not alone. The gold fever that has infected the American public has brought many visitors to Dahlonega."
1980-06-08T00:00:00Z,"I am writing to correct errors in Fred Ferretti's article about me and my book (Author of 'Winners' Calls County a Loser, May 11). First, let me say that Mr. Ferretti's interview was on the telephone. It was too bad that he was too busy to come to my home in person, which might have given him a more accurate view of me. It would also have given him a chance to see my home, which seems to have been a source of great and envious concern to him, even though he never saw it. From the headline on, the inaccuracies of the article are damaging and in my opinion journalistically irresponsible. I never said or implied I found Westchester a loser. I merely stated that here, as in all suburban communities, there is a small reactionary pocket I loathe. In my book, I was dissecting a small group, as does John Updike when he characterizes his pocket of suburbia as ''one stop past Mount Kisco.''"

1980-06-08T00:00:00Z,"The World Coal Study offered some cheering news about energy last month: coal is now so much cheaper than oil that nations could easily spend large sums to clean it up and still come out ahead. If there is no catch in the calculation, most of the problems of coal - including air and water pollution, mine safety, black-lung disease and the scarring of the land - could be controlled. But there may be one problem that would not yield to money or technology. Burning coal generates large amounts of carbon dioxide and a commitment to coal could last far beyond the age of oil. In time, the release of too much carbon dioxide might cause a catastrophic change in the global climate. Is that the catch in coal? The carbon dioxide danger is not science fiction; it is a plausible possibility. Carbon dioxide levels in the atmosphere have been rising steadily, due primarily to increasing use of fossil fuels and secondarily to the destruction of forests whose dead trees also release carbons. If the use of fossil fuels grew by only 2 percent a year, the amount of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere might double in 70 years. That might raise global temperatures by an average of 3 degrees and even more at the poles. Weather patterns could be radically altered, causing agricultural belts to shift in unpredictable ways. A disintegrating polar ice cap could raise ocean levels by 20 feet and inundate many cities."

A 53-to-1 shot called Temperence Hill - a winner of the Arkansas Derby, no less, who was named for a Methodist church - had swept home in the 112th Belmont Stakes for a mutuel payoff of $108.80 for $2. John E. Anthony, an Arkansas lumberman, put up $20,000 to make Temperence Hill a supplementary starter and collected a purse of $176,220.

But for the moment, the experts are hopeful that the results will not be as devastating as they were in 1973-75.

Barnum, the entrepreneur of all time who fascinated the world with Jumbo and Jenny Lind and Tom Thumb, who captivated young and old with his colossal traveling tent circus (it used to require 500 men and horses to tour the country), who cheerfully peddled ballyhoo and humbug (Of critics of one of his famous buncombes, ''The Fejee Mermaid,'' he said: ''Some persons always will take things literally, and make no allowance for mermaids.''), was the force, perhaps greater than any other, that transformed the Bridgeport of more than a century ago into ''Park City.''"

But something didn't work. Although rental apartments just across the river were becoming exceptionally scarce and the market's taste for condominium ownership in North Jersey became a growing hunger, rentals at the then new luxury complex languished."

1980-06-08T00:00:00Z,"The Federal Reserve is becoming everyone's whipping boy. If one listens to the Fed's critics, it seems that our central bank can never do anything right. There are those who claim that the Fed is largely responsible for our miserable inflation record - some extremists say the Fed is exclusively to blame. Part of this group also criticizes the Fed for having waited too long to tighten credit and that its steps last October were ineffectual. And then there are those who contend that those measures were sufficient to dampen the inflationary pressures and that the stringent credit controls and other restrictions imposed in mid-March represented overkill and will contribute to an excessively deep recession. And now, there are some who maintain that the Fed is easing too quickly. This melange of views reflects the woeful lack of understanding of our monetary processes and the difficult choices facing our central bank. To hold the Fed largely responsible for the inflationary spiral is about as credible as the accusations made at the Salem witch trials. The Fed's critics oversimplify what is an exceedingly complex set of relationships. The Fed, it is true, can abet inflation through following misguided policies; but in no way can the brunt of the blame be laid at its doorstep. There are many nonmonetary factors influencing price movements that seem to be virtually immune to the pressures of monetary policy. Also, when expectations and commodity speculation, such as in silver, are seriously affecting the behavior of prices, only drastic action appears to be able to counter such forces."

1980-06-08T00:00:00Z,"FOR some reason, restaurants make peculiarly clear the tendency of things to fall. There is a powerful field of gravity in the economics of the enterprise, dragging restaurants down - toward inattention and making do, toward what one of our county restaurateurs calls ''abbreviations.'' Restaurants can be maintained aloft, but only in the same way tennis bubbles are, by incessant pumping - that is, by a strong-willed, hawk-eyed, perhaps slightly fanatic management. And it is remarkable that managements can hold restaurants to high standards year after year - sometimes. Usually they can't, which brings us to Emily Shaw's Inn. For 40 years a restaurant of good reputation with beautiful old dining rooms - broad-board and slate floors and somber pine walls - it is one of only a half-dozen local dining places likely to be known outside Westchester. It is like one of the county's great-aunts by now, and it seems almost disloyal to tell the truth about it out loud, which is that it is only a so-so restaurant where you have to eat warily to eat well."

The Peales, Morans and Mounts of an earlier era and the Wyeths and Soyers of today are a few of the celebrated clans that have produced several talents. These families are increasingly being examined as groups, often in an effort to identify common characteristics or sources in their art. In the current exhibition of work by the Porter family at the Parrish Art Museum, we find that each of the four artist members - the brothers Fairfield and Elliot, Elliot's wife, Aline, and their son, Stephen - works in a different medium and style. Each has pursued his or her own course independently, evolving individualistic modes of expression. In fact, few people realize that the late Fairfield Porter, the painter of gestural landscapes and family portraits, is related to Elliot, the nature photographer; Aline, the creator of delicate floral studies and assemblages, and Stephen, the sculptor of monumental, roughly hewn wooden carvings."

1980-06-08T00:00:00Z,"In the modern world those who despair of reaching their goals by orthodox sensible means sometimes resort to a long shot: They do something absurd, or dramatic, or violent. This rarely serves to achieve the desired result, but rarely does not mean never. Such behavior is possible in a technical way at the card table if the game is rubber bridge or team play, not duplicate. If you can see that your game or slam is doomed, it can occasionally be right to do something totally ridiculous. You are prepared to fail by an extra trick or two in the interests of confusing the opposition, although you know that the chance of confusing them to good effect is negligible."
1980-06-08T00:00:00Z,"The president of the Minnesota Twins says Mike Marshall's differences with the front office had nothing to do with the club's decision to give the relief pitcher his outright release. ''Marshall tried to make us look like fools,'' Calvin Griffith said after the right-hander was released yesterday, with more than 1 1/2 seasons remaining on a high-priced contract. ''But if he was producing, we would have put up with him."

1980-06-08T00:00:00Z,"WASHINGTON A PLAN by the Pinelands Planning Commission to preserve the million-acre Pine Barrens was made public last week, but was quickly criticized, even by some longtime supporters of preservation, as going too far. At a briefing by the panel, several New Jersey Congressmen warned Terrence Moore, executive director of the commission, and Franklin Parker, its chairman, that Congress might reject the plan and cut off needed Federal funds."
1980-06-08T00:00:00Z,"In the Basque region of northern Spain there are signs of a popular backlash against the violence of the separatist organization E.T.A., which has benefited from the acquiescence or tacit support of many Basques. At the same time the police have become more vigorous in their struggle against E.T.A., which has slain 38 people this year. The most dramatic rejection of E.T.A. came at the end of last month when Juan Alcorta, a San Sebastian industrialist, published an open letter to the terrorist organization refusing its demand for a ''revolutionary tax'' of $150,000. ''I am not a hero and I do not want to be one,'' he said in his letter, which was published in all Basque newspapers except the one that serves as an unofficial E.T.A. organ. ''E.T.A.: I will continue to live the way I live now. So you will not have to come looking for me, as you say in your letter. It will be easy to find me.''"

Representative Douglas Huff Jr. said he would not vote for it in protest against what he called ''somewhat racist'' stands of Gov. James R. Thompson, a supporter of the amendment. Representative William Henry also said he was considering withholding his vote but did not explain why. A vote may come Wednesday."
1980-06-08T00:00:00Z,"From the moment Vernon E. Jordan Jr. was shot in the back with a .30-06 hunting rifle there have been two theories - that the attack on the president of the National Urban League in Fort Wayne, Ind., was related to his civil rights activities, or that it had something to do with the personal life of Martha C. Coleman, a white board member of the League's local chapter who was Mr. Jordan's companion that night. Ten days after the shooting, law enforcement officials have apparently eliminated the first and made no connection to the second. Unless a weapon is found or someone comes forward, they say, there is little prospect of solving the case. Nevertheless, the possibility that the attack was racially motivated has not been ruled out. The simple fact of a black in the company of a white woman had provoked at least one incident. According to Mrs. Coleman, insults were shouted at the car in which she was driving Mr. Jordan from her home back to his hotel at 2:00 A.M."

1980-06-08T00:00:00Z,"A review of Governor Byrne's achievements awes me with its magnificent incompetency. He has managed to impose a state income tax and cut the general level of services. Despite the warnings of lawenforcement officials, he brought casino gambling to Atlantic City, and he is now astounded that crime and corruption have accompanied it. The range of malfeasance within Mr. Byrne's administration runs from the trivial: from state cars damaged in personal use by his family to allegations of involvement in Abscam."

They share intimate moments to which even the closest of kin - husband, parent or child - are not privy.

1980-06-08T00:00:00Z,"Extortion charges were dismissed this week against the former vice president of an international charity in a case that raised questions about how forcefully religious contributions can be sought. The former official, Daniel Wingerd, had been charged in April 1979 with trying to extort $34,000 from a businessman in Westport, Conn., where the charity, Save the Children, has its headquarters. Mr. Wingerd said in court papers that he told the businessman, Michael Waldman, that he should tithe $34,000 dollars. He said he never intended any personal gain or harm to Mr. Waldman. He did not make it clear where the money was to be donated, nor was there any documentation that Mr. Wingerd had inferred that the charity was to handle the money."
1980-06-08T00:00:00Z,"Uncle Sam, it is said, is the biggest coin dealer in the business - and the reason becomes apparent when one considers the latest numismatic news out of Washington. Within the next few weeks, U.S. Government agencies will launch two separate sales involving coins and medals struck by the Bureau of the Mint. One is the final phase of the ''Great Silver Sale'' of 19th century silver dollars; the other is the opening segment of the gold medallion sale authorized by Congress in 1978. Both loom as multimillion-dollar operations, which are likely to draw not only collectors, but also the public at large."

According to First Deputy Commissioner Mark D. Corrigan, the department has eliminated pension abuses, tightened payroll procedures and instituted a program of using more non-uniformed employees in place of correction officers, all of which were recommended by Comptroller Edward V. Regan. The report, which was released Thursday, suggested that more than $6 million could be saved by the changes."

Throughout the ordeal, members of the family have tempered their grief by reading letters written by Mrs. Prouty and by gardening, which one family member said was ''one of Ellie's favorite pastimes.'' The serenity that prevailed at the home of Norman Prouty Jr. last Monday as he and his brothers, John R. and James L., talked in an interview about their mother was a tribute to the woman they described as being like the fields of daffodils she planted each spring, ''blossoming with life.''"

Without them the 16thcentury church seems denuded. The monumental statues are in a wire-mesh cage in the courtyard. Their visages have been eaten away by acid so that they look more like masked robbers than saints. They will remain there until the authorities figure out what to do with them."

1980-06-08T00:00:00Z,"As a professional football quarterback in the 1960's, Jack Kemp had an affinity for throwing the ''long bomb'' - the dramatic game-breaking pass. As a professional politician, he has spent the last three years promoting its economic equivalent: a 30 percent reduction in personal income taxes over three years that he claims would solve virtually all the fundamental economic problems confronting the nation. The tax-cut bill, co-sponsored by Senator William V. Roth Jr., Republican of Delaware, was first scorned and has been repeatedly frustrated by Congressional and expert economic opposition. But at last, Jack Kemp, a California-born Republican Congressman from New York, may have found the ultimate teammate in fellow Californian Ronald Reagan. Mr. Reagan has adopted the so-called Kemp-Roth bill as a cornerstone of his economic policy and has made Mr. Kemp a key member of his Presidential campaign staff."

Even on the South Fork, where crops generally ripen a week or more later than in the Riverhead area, picking is expected to begin by the second week in June. It is already time to bake the shortcakes, whip the cream and set out the jelly jars. After the strawberries, there will be more opportunity than ever before for vegetable picking at local farms. The list has almost doubled. Peas, a labor-intensive crop like strawberries, are now being cultivated for pick-your-own by many farmers. One farm, Fritz Lewin in Calverton, is also offering corn on a pick-your-own basis."
1980-06-08T00:00:00Z,"WOMEN and Arts, a group of artists associated with the Westchester chapter of the National Organization for Women, is having a show in the lobby of the County Courthouse in White Plains, until June 27. It is not a very good show, but it raises interesting questions about the social uses of art these days. Women and Arts is described by its director, Barbara Arum, as a NOW ''task force'' formed six years ago ''to enhance opportunities for women in the art world.'' It has 35 members and has been highly successful in getting them shown, arranging about five group exhibitions a year. Twenty-four members are represented in the White Plains exhibition, which is sponsored by the office of County Executive Alfred B. DelBello."

1980-06-08T00:00:00Z,"A specter is haunting publishing. As the American Booksellers Association holds its annual meeting in Chicago this week, that specter is barely visible but it is there. The specter is technological: magic shadows on a screen, or words on a disk or a fiche instead of books in print. Looking ahead to the Orwellian year 1984 and beyond, some publishers envision electronic changes that will revolutionize the way books reach readers - and perhaps even the way they are written. (A few authors are typing novels on electronic screens; they then get paper printouts for revisions.) These new systems, using computer terminals for transmission and reception, or videocassettes, or microfiche readers, are loosely referred to as electronic publishing."
1980-06-08T00:00:00Z,"I WAS in Toronto, a city whose team used to win the Stanley Cup, when the Islanders finally won theirs. ''Where are they going to have the parade? In someone's backyard?'' a Torontonian asked. ''No, on the Long Island Rail Road,'' his friend replied. The ''where'' of the parade was a source of amusement to these two, who saw the Island as an inconvenient place to get to just to see a hockey game."
1980-06-08T00:00:00Z,"Not far from the three-and-a-half-acre tent housing the main exhibits of the Chelsea Flower Show late in May hung a simple hand-lettered sign. ''This,'' it said, referring to the spindly implement that stood beneath, ''is the best leaf rake in the world.'' Although few of the 250,000 people who jammed the famous show took much notice of this small triumph, it seemed to symbolize today's Britain: a beautiful and amenable country obsessed with analyzing its industrial decline while continuing to lavish its ingenuity and pride on things almost defiantly uneconomic."

1980-06-08T00:00:00Z,"Last March, when interest rates were soaring, investing in fixedincome securities was easy. Double-digit yields were abundant and millions of investors were able to earn as much as 17 1/2 percent. Fixed-income investing now is no longer so simple or so profitable, because, unfortunately for investors, last winter's bonanza didn't last long."
1980-06-08T00:00:00Z,"The public debate over the strained relationship between the police and Britain's growing black population has been rekindled in recent weeks. A riot in a western seaport city, the violent death of a civil rights demonstrator in London and growing parliamentary pressure for the repeal of a vagrancy law that blacks see as a threat have focused attention on the country's race problem."

1980-06-08T00:00:00Z,"WASHINGTON THE way Representative Richard L. Ottinger projects his plan, ''a minority of voters'' in small states such as New Hampshire and Iowa would no longer be able to set the trend of selecting Presidential nominees through early-bird primaries and caucuses. The Westchester Democrat, who is beginning to press anew for one of his most cherished ideas, would substitute five regional primaries, beginning in 1984, for what he calls the ''hodgepodge'' and ''mishmash'' of more than 30 primaries that run candidates ragged and empty their war chests in a matter of months."

Anderson, starting a potentially formidable independent campaign; the recession, more severe than Mr. Carter predicted, and the difficult task of patching together enough electoral votes to win in November."
1980-06-08T00:00:00Z,"You bet I voted for Tom Metzger,'' Bill Davis said angrily, almost shouting. Standing outside Mr. C.'s pool hall, where he's one of the regulars, Mr. Davis - a Vietnam veteran, commercial fisherman and native of this community that calls itself ''The Avocado Capital of the World'' - was giving his views on Tuesday's victory by the Grand Dragon of the California Ku Klux Klan, Mr. Metzger, who won the Democratic Party's nomination for Congress in the nation's most populous Congressional district. ''I think Metzger's got good ideas,'' Mr. Davis said. ''This country is all screwed up; Metzger's the only guy asking the right questions; inflation, taxes, unemployment - nobody can get a job and we're giving money to all those refugees who are taking jobs from Americans.''"

1980-06-08T00:00:00Z,"The precise future of Picasso's ''Guernica'' has been one of the hottest topics in town ever since Spain got itself a stable democratic government. It is a subject on which most of us have put in our 50 cents' worth at one time or another. But this particular observer, fired and fueled by a week in Madrid, inclines to see the matter as settled. Barring an unexpected development, that is to say, ''Guernica'' will be in Madrid by the end of this year, and it will be housed in what is popularly spoken of as ''the little Prado'' - a small and elegant building that stands just a short walk uphill from the Prado itself. (For the moment it harbors a collection of Spanish 19thcentury paintings, few of which can be said to perfume the memory.) Quite apart from that, and subject to the collective approval of Picasso's heirs, the assembled studies and postscripts to ''Guernica'' which are now in the Modern Museum retrospective will also be in the ''little Prado,'' which will therefore have the nucleus of an irreplaceable Picasso Museum."

The secret investigation started six months ago and focused on Bullets' marketing director, Chip Reed, and at least three employees of the National Basketball Association club, according to sources quoted by the newspaper. The unidentified sources reportedly said that Reed had used his office at Capital Centre in Landover, Md., and other locations to operate a betting operation.

''I shook the hand offered: snow-white cuffs, gold links, smooth pale skin, faintly moist; well-tended nails, onyx-and-gold signet ring on little finger.'' That should be enough to set off alarm bells in any Dick Francis reader. In Mr. Francis' world, gentlemen do not have moist skin, much less onyx-and-gold signet rings on their little finger. Mr. Trevor Deansgate is in all likelihood a bounder. And so (it is revealing no secrets) he does indeed turn out to be. Sid Halley is the ex-jockey who was the hero of ''Odds Against.'' He had lost a hand, can no longer race, and now is a private eye. He is the ideal British type, even though he comes from a low milieu. He is smart, stoical, always a gentleman who lives by The Code - and is recognized as such by his peers. He is closed-mouthed, never complains, is determined to see a matter through to its end. In ''Whip Hand'' he also finds himself faced with a moral crisis. All the world thinks he is self-reliant. But only he himself, like Horatio Hornblower, knows how weak he is down deep. Mr. Francis, like C.S. Forester and his Hornblower, is a master at playing this game. Their heroes are everything they are thought to be, even if the heroes reproach themselves for being human. We the readers know how near-perfect they are."

1980-06-08T00:00:00Z,"The tabletop proscenium, complete with curtain and follow-spots, looked real enough to house a troupe of Lilliputian actors and made the living room of David Mitchell's Upper West Side brownstone look a bit like Santa's workshop. Mr. Mitchell bent forward and carefully adjusted the wires on a tiny trapeze, threading his fingers through a maze of spider-size rigging suspended above a miniature stage. ''There it is,'' he said proudly, stepping back for a better look at his handiwork. ''That's pretty much the way 'Barnum' looks on Broadway.'' David Mitchell is the man whose artful imagination transformed the stage of the St. James Theater into the rainbow-hued circus world of Phineas T. Barnum, the fast-talking hero of the hit musical by Cy Coleman, Michael Stewart and Mark Bramble. Mr. Mitchell's exuberant scenic designs have won him high praise and may win him a Tony Award at tonight's presentation ceremonies at the Mark Hellinger. (''Barnum,'' in fact, has been nominated in 10 Tony categories, including one for its acrobatic star, Jim Dale, two for its director and choreographer, Joe Layton, and another for ''Best Musical.'')"
1980-06-08T00:00:00Z,"NOW that Gordie Howe has decided not to play hockey anymore at age 52, nearly a decade after he thought he had decided that the first time, his monuments tower above the sport - 1,071 goals, including a record 801 in the National Hockey League; 1,518 assists; 2,421 games; six N.H.L. scoring titles; six most valuable player awards (a record five in the N.H.L., and one in the World Hockey Association in the season he turned 46). But when asked about his accomplishments, Gordie Howe did not speak of goals or games or awards. ''The one record I'm very proud of,'' he said, ''is the longevity record.'' Over a span of five decades, Gordie Howe played 32 seasons in a bruising, often brutal sport. And he had no soft seasons. He played all 80 games for the New England Whalers last season. Throughout his career, he averaged 68 games a season, despite a severe concussion that hospitalized him during the 1950 Stanley Cup playoffs, dislocated shoulders, torn rib cartilege, more than 300 facial stitches and other assorted ailments. But to put those 32 seasons in perspective, consider other longevity records."

The officials said the possible incompetence was demonstrated in part by his repeated assertions that he was working for the Federal Bureau of Investigation and the Central Intelligence Agency. The man is Alexander Gorski, 43 years old, the proprietor of a travel agency in Newington. He was indicted by a Federal grand jury in New Haven last August on charges of conspiracy, making false statements to Federal agents, harboring and shielding illegal aliens, inducing the illegal entry of aliens, and mail fraud. Prosecutors said he had fraudulently obtained 90 Social Security cards and sold them to aliens."

The Treasury Department was asked to determine whether the 10 had violated the law in their defiance of President Carter's ban on travel to Iran. (Page 1, Column 5.) Britain will import more goods this year than it will export for the first time, an indication of the economic decline of the leader of the Industrial Revolution. Britain's Industry Secretary, Sir Keith Joseph, said the country has ''destroyed the natural habitat'' of its entrepreneurs. (1:3-4.) Israeli soldiers killed two Arabs said to have been members of ''a terrorist squad'' attempting to enter Israel from Jordanian territory. The Israelis crossed the border in pursuit of the suspected infiltrators. The suspected attempt by the Arabs to cross the Jordanian border was unusual because it has usually been tranquil since since King Hussein's expulsion of Palestinian guerrillas in 1970. (15:1-5.) National Moves to expel Cuban refugees who committed ''serious crimes'' in Cuba were ordered by President Carter, who also told the Justice Department to expel or prosecute those refugees responsible for the rioting last Sunday night at Fort Chaffee, Ark. Jody Powell, the White House spokesman, emphasized that the ''undesirable'' refugees were a small minority - less than 1 percent of the more than 110,000 who have arrived since April 21. (1:6.) President Carter faces new problems after six months of intensive campaigning that has all but captured the Democratic Presidential nomination. Mr. Carter and his backers still have Senator Kennedy refusing to withdraw and prominent Democrats to refusing to count him out; they also faced the problems of contending with Representative John B. Anderson, the recession and the difficult task of patching together enough electoral votes that will mean victory. (1:1.) Ronald Reagan is optimistic about winning the Presidency after the ease with which he rolled through the Republican primaries, but he is untested for what his aides expect to be a bitterly fought campaign. The big test, Republican and Democratic strategists say, is whether Mr. Reagan can make the election a referendum on President Carter's performance, or whether his own capacity for Presidency will become the main issue. (1:2.) The antitax movement's success around the country has checked the growth of state and local revenues and the trend is expected to continue despite California's rejection of a ballot initiative last Tuesday to cut state income taxes in half. A study by the National Governors Association found that state and local revenues, as a proportion of the gross national product, peaked in 1977 and began to decline in 1978 as the tax revolt took hold. (39:1.) Metropolitan Six South Bronx teen-age felons made a weeklong trip into the wilderness to learn how to survive by cooperating rather than by being hostile to the people around them. The trip, to the woodlands of Ulster County, was organized by the Community Service Society at a cost of $9,000. (1:1-3.) Management of the state pension fund has been ''disastrous,'' a New York State Assemblyman, said. Assemblyman Frank J. Barbaro, Brooklyn Democrat, who headed a legislative study of the state employees' pension fund, said that the management of common stock investments, which forms much of the fund's income, under Comptroller Edward V. Regan, and his predecessor, Arthur Levitt, had cost the fund about $1 billion in lost income in the last 20 years. (39:1.)"

The agreement, however, was reported to hinge on the Carey administration's willingness to share the financial responsibility with the Federal department in saving Sydenham Hospital in West Harlem, the city's oldest and smallest municipal hospital. Mr. Koch wants the hospital closed. The project calls for the state to help finance Sydenham's conversion into an alcohol and drug abuse treatment center, a cost that has yet to be determined."

Scientists are convinced there is; the only question is chemically, botanically, scientifically how. It is a research battle spurred by ever louder consumer complaints that today's mass-produced fruits and vegetables are often insipid, that the flavor of fattened beef sometimes resembles tallow, and that America's highly specialized agriculture industry is interested mainly in raising food for high yields, appearance and ease of transport and, according to Dr. James C. Boudreau, a sensory physiologist at Texas University in Houston, ''to hell with how it tastes.''"
1980-06-08T00:00:00Z,"LIVING in a small, cheerless flat and working at a dreary job, the eager young novelist harbors intimations of glamour and success: He will write his Bildungsroman, perfect his art and become a respected artist. Such is the portrait of the writer as a young man that emerges in the latest novels of William Styron and Philip Roth. In ''Sophie's Choice,'' Stingo, a callow Southerner not unlike the young Styron, comes to New York, where he reads manuscripts for a publisher by day and dreams by night of becoming ''a writer with the same ardor and the soaring wings'' of Melville or Flaubert. In ''The Ghost Writer,'' Nathan Zuckerman, an aspiring author who resembles the young Roth in his desire to escape the banality of his middle-class youth, quits his job selling magazine subscriptions and sets out to visit the secluded home of an older writer, hoping to find in the Master a spiritual father for his own Dedalean quest."

Chez Bach combines two worlds in its title and on its premises, with samplings of both Vietnamese and French cuisine. It isn't as unlikely a combination as it may seem at first, considering the long time the French spent in Indochina. Actually, there are other echoes here as well, for Chez Bach occupies the premises - and seems not to have much changed the decor - of a former Italian restaurant. The gold-flecked wallpaper and black plastic booths and chairs have a familiar look."

What had been envisaged by some was New Jersey as a capital of bigtime yachting - another Newport, perhaps, or a Fort Lauderdale North - with 60-foot luxury yachts steaming across the bays and rivers, deep-water docks leading to haute cuisine restaurants and high-rise condominiums on the water's edge."

With nearly a million barrels of excess oil searching for buyers, with recession dampening Western demand, with 5 billion barrels stored in Western reservoirs and tankers, it should follow that the price would stabilize or even drop below the record sums of $35 or $38 a barrel some producers are charging.

A sixth, a 16-year-old boy named David, remained in the van, clutching a large transistor radio and turning up the volume on the rock station. ''I ain't going nowhere without my music,'' David said. ''I'll sleep in the van.'' A counselor with the group suggested gently to David that if he stayed behind he would be all by himself. David looked out at the forest in front of the van and reconsidered.

1980-06-08T00:00:00Z,"The hotel chef in ''The Shining'' is supposed to have remarkable psychic powers, but the movie never explains the strangest of this man's idiosyncrasies: he can smell trouble from Miami to Colorado, but he doesn't detect a killer standing 10 feet away from him, armed with an ax and wearing a horrible grin. The movie's ghostly butler starts out with the name of Charles Grady, but he somehow becomes Delbert Grady before the story is finished. The caption on a closing photograph of Jack Nicholson utterly defies explanation. And the director, Stanley Kubrick, once again leaves his audiences asking a familiar question: How can anyone make a film so fastidiously beautiful and still leave so many loose ends? ''The Shining'' may be a horror film, but it very much fits the Kubrick mold. First and foremost, it is mesmerizingly lovely, so handsome you may be halfway out of the theater before those nagging questions arise. Yet, like ''A Clockwork Orange'' or ''2001: A Space Odyssey,'' this is a movie that barely makes sense upon examination. Most of the small details seem meticulously chosen, but there's no evidence that corresponding care has been taken with the film's central concerns."

1980-06-08T00:00:00Z,"When the Shah's rule in Iran collapsed before revolutionary mobs last year, it became fashionable among liberals on the cocktail party circuit in Johannesburg to ask: if in Iran, why not in South Africa? If an entrenched autocratic regime commanding a near monopoly of force could be toppled by strikes and demonstrations, why could not the same happen to the Afrikaner regime? Some day it may. But in the foreseeable future, the balance between authority and protest is likely to favor the Afrikaners, and not simply because they, unlike the Shah, possess an army and police force they can rely upon, whatever the bloodshed entailed. Difficult as it is for the proselytes of black revolution, hard evidence suggests that an essential ingredient - a black population ready by the hundreds of thousands to confront the whites - exists at the moment only in the columns of Pravda and The People's Daily."

Mrs. Van Slyke, who became a novelist after she was 50 years old, gave up a career as a successful fashion and cosmetics executive to write the so-called ''women's books'' that have sold more than 6 million copies. Many of her characters were affluent, middle-aged women much like herself.

1980-06-08T00:00:00Z,"The name given to a patient's mental or emotional problems didn't matter a few years ago, many psychiatrists say. With no tailor-made treatments available, accurate diagnoses benefited few. Today, 25 years into psychiatry's pharmacological revolution, diagnosis usually leads to a specific drug therapy. There are minor tranquilizers for anxiety, tricyclic antidepressants and monoamine oxidase inhibitors to help the depressed, lithium to still the emotional swings of manic depression, and antipsychotic, or neuroleptic, drugs to dispel the disordered thoughts and possibly violent behavior of schizophrenia. With these drugs and their promise of relief, however, has come a fearful question: What happens when the psychiatrist or other doctor makes the wrong diagnosis? What is the effect of taking the wrong medication? Or the right one in the wrong amount? The case of neuroleptics, dispensed to one to three million people in the general population yearly, offers a disturbing answer."

The ability of the non-Continental members of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization to move strong forces into Europe in a crisis is essential to NATO's deterrent strategy, according to military and political leaders."
1980-06-08T00:00:00Z,"The 1979-80 season comes to an official, gaudy, cathartic finale tonight when the Tony Awards are presented before a nationwide television audience at the Mark Hellinger Theater. Only a fool would predict how the Tony voters are going to swing -or at least make such speculations in print - and so there will be no predictions here. But this is the perfect time to take a long, backward look at the season, and ask just what kind of year for theatergoing it was. For my money, this was no season for the history books, but there have nonetheless been plenty of thrills. Most of the best plays and musicals have been revivals - not a good sign - and yet most of the revivals have been exquisite. Some of our name playwrights (from Albee and Williams to Babe and Innaurato) have taken their lumps, but some bright new stars have begun to shine. In any case, here is a highly opinionated, far from all-inclusive list of some of the people, plays and things that made this theatergoer's 1979-80 season worthwhile. The BAM Theater Company. This new repertory company, guided by David Jones, a Royal Shakespeare Company veteran, is the miracle of the season. Not all of the productions have been successful, but Mr. Jones and his literary manager, Richard Nelson, have never erred on the side of caution. They have chosen plays ranging from the difficult (''The Winter's Tale'') to the obscure (Gorky's ''Barbarians''), produced them to the nines and staffed them with energetic casts. BAM's excavation of Charles MacArthur's obscure ''Johnny on a Spot,'' a Broadway flop of 1942, had the season's funniest second act. Brian Murray's portrayal of a French chamber pot manufacturer in Feydeau's ''The Purging'' (now playing on a double bill with Brecht's ''The Wedding'') is the year's most uproarious farcical performance. All in all, BAM seems well on its way to providing New York with the great rep company it so sorely needs."

1980-06-08T00:00:00Z,"The fourth annual Plimpton Cup for the World Amateur Backgammon Championship will be held this week, Tuesday to Sunday, in Las Vegas, Nev. The popularity of this event is due in no small part to the $100,000 first prize. Prizes this substantial are rare in any sport or game, and are usually available only to the top professionals. The Plimpton Cup, however, is restricted to amateurs - professional players must compete in a separate ''open'' event. The caliber of play is not as high in the amateur event, but the competition is fierce. Under pressure, amateurs are more prone than professionals to commit errors. In particular, near the end of a long match, amateurs often meglect the subtleties of match play that never arise in nontournament play. The exact score of the match influences not only the doubling strategy but also the play of the checkers."

However, the Brooklyn Tech senior will be 3,000 miles away when that meet is contested.

1980-06-08T00:00:00Z,"There is a long walk before one reaches the room, past white shuttered doors facing a dense tropical garden. The deep quiet is interrupted only by the swift flight of birds. The room itself is simple; mahogany twin beds pushed together, white hobnail bedspreads and red pillows, white throw rugs on a terrazzo floor and hunting prints on the walls. The room is full of the sound of the sea. This wing of the Jamaica Inn sits on the sand and opens onto the beach not with screens or glass but with a second room that is something between a porch and an English parlor. Upholstered furniture in a floral print is enclosed by three baby blue walls and a porch railing just high enough to make it more comfortable to walk around to the front door than to climb in from the outside."
1980-06-08T00:00:00Z,"PASTED in a window of a recently vacated store on Main Street here is a photograph of an old woman crying, and underneath it, a brief article written in Spanish. Translated, the story begins, ''These tears are yours, Fidel Castro. She is 78 years old and has left her land behind. In that land, she also left behind her youth, relatives, her language and her illusions ....'' Not long ago, 20 Cubans arrived here to make new lives for themselves. They are three families who came in mid-May to live with relatives, a fourth family who knew no one in America and moved one week ago into a dormitory at Marymount College where they will stay for an indefinite period of time, and three individuals who had been at the troubled Fort Chaffee relocation center in Arkansas since May 17. Like the woman in the photograph, and like the thousands who have fled Cuba in the past month, they have had to put behind them much that was familiar -but they have also come to a community in which they can feel at least partially at home."

1980-06-08T00:00:00Z,"TO someone like Gary Morgenstein - born in the Bronx, raised in Jamaica and Selden, a player of street games, a Mets fan - opening day in major league baseball is always special. Last year was no exception. It wasn't simply that Mr. Morgenstein returned home from his job as an editor of the quarterly publication Baseball Stats Magazine to discover that the Mets had won.

Jordan Jr. begins the slow process of recovery from the gunshot wound he suffered eight days ago, the National Urban League and its affiliates in 117 cities are turning their attention to the impact of the shooting and Mr. Jordan's absence on the league and the civil rights movement. The consensus, based on telephone interviews with rights leaders around the country, both in and out of the Urban League, is that Mr. Jordan will be missed more by the civil rights community than by the league. The long-term effects, most said, will depend on the length of his recuperation and on whether the motive for the shooting is found to be related to his activism or to his companion at the time of the shooting."

A majority rejected a plan to complete the Seward Park Extension project that had been passed by the local community board and by a prestigious Chinatown group. The plan was presented as a compromise between those who advocate more low-rent public housing in the area and those who urge that the remaining urban renewal land be dedicated to commercial facilities. But the Board of Estimate made it clear that it wants no more public housing in the Seward Park Extension area, which is just north of Chinatown."

By next month, the governing board of the Thames River Development Corporation, representing area government, business and public interests, should be selected. The nonprofit organization will attempt for the first time to copy on a regional scale the success of municipal development corporations already at work in Meriden, Bridgeport and other cities. The corporation's large agenda - increasing use of New London Harbor and the State Pier, attracting industry, and promoting tourism - and the idea for setting up the corporation itself were proposed in a plan made public by the Office of Policy and Management in mid-May. This plan is the product of a $29,300 study, authorized in 1978 by the General Assembly, of ''the development of port and ancillary commercial and recreational facilities along the Thames River from the harbor in the city of New London to the city of Norwich.''"

The answer seems simple enough, but Federal bureaucrats have managed to make it complicated, and the disagreement is causing no end of confusion over one of the economy's key statistics: imports of foreign oil. The fracas is over whether the United States is (1) just the 50 states, (2) the 50 states plus Puerto Rico, which is the Customs area where tariffs are levied, or (3) the 50 states plus Puerto Rico plus Guam and other Pacific territories, which is the broader balance-ofpayments zone."

''We're not going out of our way to help small businesses in Brazil. We want those people to provide labor for big business. The growth of this country depends upon big business, and that's who we're going to be dealing with.''

1980-06-09T00:00:00Z,"BITS & PIECES,'' Corinne Jacker's 1974 Obie Award-winning comedy, could not be more perfectly named. Miss Jacker's title at once describes her play's plot, its theatrical technique and its failings. To put it another way, ''Bits & Pieces'' is an anecdotal, unfocused work about fragmented lives. But Miss Jacker does write with rueful, passionate humor, and in the spiffy revival at the Second Stage some of her fragments do shine. The playwright attempts the tough task of telling two stories simultaneously - one set in the present, the other in the past. The first is about death. Philip, an attractive young college professor played by Robert Fields, has died, and his wife, Iris (Robyn Goodman), is trying to cope with the pain of the loss. To do so, she decides to chase, quite literally, after the bits and pieces of her late husband's body: Philip had willed most of himself to a transplant bank, and now his organs and appendages belong to others."

As the classic historical metaphor for appeasement, the name of the city recurs uncomfortably in views of the West's response to Soviet aggression in Afghanistan, the cracks in the Atlantic alliance, the suspicions of broken ranks in Europe. The nagging worry seems to be, Will 1980 be another 1938? Historical precedents are dangerous ideas. The threats today are more diverse, less concentrated in one man or idea. But what mattered in 1938 and what matters now is knowing a threat for a threat, and then deciding to deal with it."

Although the ministers voiced sharply different views today, the door was left open for a compromise that could include a sharp price increase. Tayeh Abdul Kerim, Iraq's Oil Minister, proposed a compromise minimum price of $32 a barrel, $4 above the existing minimum. This would increase the cost to Western consumers for imported oil by $5 billion a year."
1980-06-09T00:00:00Z,"New York City produces more garbage than poetry. About 22,000 tons of it a day. The city has run out of holes in which to bury the solid waste, and no other locality has volunteered as the final resting place. Some European cities have proved that solid waste can be ignited under proper environmental controls to produce heat for steam and electricity. The obstacles to similarly productive re-use of waste in New York are more institutional than technical. The State Legislature can remove them by changing the rules under which municipalities may contract with private businesses for what is euphemistically called ''resource recovery''. Because large-scale recovery of the hidden resources in garbage requires capital that the city government cannot raise, a serious program will require private investment. New York hopes to sign with one or more bidders, each of whom would receive up to 2,400 tons of waste a day and share the profits with the city under a negotiated formula. But to attract such investors, the city finds it will have to commit its wastes for long enough -say, 30 years - to assure a reasonable return on the the cost of the plant. It will have to be free to choose the most reliable bidders, using criteria that are less easily quantifiable than the proceeds-sharing formula. It will have to let bidders build their plants by whatever contracting procedure seems most efficient. City Hall believes that the Wicks Law, requiring separate bids for construction, electrical work, plumbing and heating, should not be applicable in this case.

But never in Britain on the grand strategy of your policies. The vast majority of Europeans still look to America as the hope of the future. We in Britain have a tough time in the European Community and this happens precisely because we have a common tradition with the United States. That tradition is the rule of law. In Britain as in America no one, President or Queen, Senator or Cabinet Minister, is above the law. On the Continent of Europe too often the law is regarded as yet another arm of the state. In Europe, they have ministers of justice who appoint the judges; you have a Supreme Court and our law lords are chosen by the judiciary themselves. It makes a difference."

In Nicks's junior year of college, at Indiana State in 1978-79, his teammate, Larry Bird, was the player that everybody knew and came to watch, although Nicks averaged 19.6 points a game and helped his team become runner-up for the national championship. During his senior season, Nicks averaged 26.7 points, but Indiana State had a 16-11 won-lost record, failing to receive a postseason tournament bid. Going into tomorrow's National Basketball Association college draft, Nicks again finds himself overshadowed by at least half a dozen outstanding and more publicized guards, but he could still emerge as a late first-round or early second-round choice."

1980-06-09T00:00:00Z,"EVITA,'' the show about Argentina's Eva Peron, was named best musical of the 1979-80 theater season last night and ''Children of a Lesser God,'' about the relationship of a deaf woman and her therapist, was named best play as Broadway luminaries gathered at the Mark Hellinger Theater for the 34th annual Tony Awards presentation. ''Evita'' was the major winner, with seven awards in the category of musicals during the nearly two-hour ceremonies, televised nationally by CBS. It captured the Tony for best actress -Patti LuPone, in the title role, and best direction - by Harold Prince, who already had held the record for Tony's; this was his 14th. ''Evita'' also won awards for best book (by Tim Rice), best score (by Andrew Lloyd Webber) performance by a featured actor (Mandy Patinkin) and outstanding lighting (by David Hersey)."

''It smelled like horses, lots and lots of horses,'' said Joyce Cohen, a worker at the plant. ''The workers came to me and complained,'' said Candido Arce, a factory supervisor. ''That room had the smell of a dung heap.'' What the candy makers were smelling was the biggest compost heap in New York City, which the city had placed next door to the chocolate factory and across the Boardwalk from a big stretch of beach."

1980-06-09T00:00:00Z,"EXCEPT for her appearance at American Ballet Theater's 40th anniversary gala, Gelsey Kirkland has not danced with the company in a year. On Saturday night at the Metropolitan Opera House, she came back as a guest in a stunning performance, a local debut in Jerome Robbins's ''Other Dances.'' She is the perfect Robbins dancer -she knows how to play with the gesture implied in the choreography and in this instance, she made her role one beautiful sigh. Her line became highly elongated, the movement was often slowly stretched. And yet this extreme silhouette could meld into a series of detailed small shifts in speed - in her first solo, Miss Kirkland seemed to be playing with an imagined shadow. Along the way, she swept her partner, Anthony Dowell into this world of make-believe. A sublime partnership."
1980-06-09T00:00:00Z,"There are still awed murmurs from the audience when the curtain goes up on the gem-strewn sets for George Balanchine's ''Jewels,'' 13 years after its premiere. The ''Emeralds''section glowed, ''Rubies'' twinkled and ''Diamonds'' burned with cold fire, as usual, on Tuesday when the New York City Ballet performed the ballet at the New York State Theater. A season without ''Jewels'' would probably not be a season for many City Ballet fans, for Mr. Balanchine has fashioned a classic that remains a tremendous crowd-pleaser. This is a crowd-pleaser, however, whose elements are endlessly touching and surprising, given the kind of performance it received on Tuesday. The odd ordering of dances in ''Emeralds'' has the initial effect of isolating it and the viewer from remembered form, so that by the time Karin von Aroldingen and Joseph Duell pick their way through their grave and dreaming walk, so much an evocation of the gentle Faure score, we are prepared to experience it as a major, though quiet, moment of ballet. Kyra Nichols caught the music's veiled lyricism and Gerald Ebitz got full romantic measure from his role as cavalier. Squiring Bonita and Elyse Borne, Jean-Pierre Frohlich added a good note of incisive flash."

It was a fitting tribute, for Mr. Robbins danced with the company from 1940 to 1948 and it was for Ballet Theater that he created his first ballet, ''Fancy Free,'' in 1944. Although he has been one of Ballet Theater's most important choreographers, the company has staged only six ballets by him over the years, four of which were on Tuesday's program: ''Interplay,'' ''Les Noces,'' ''Other Dances'' and ''Fancy Free,'' the two works by Mr. Robbins that are no longer in the repertory being ''Facsimile'' and ''Summer Day.''"

The powerful United Steelworkers and the smaller Aluminum Workers International struck a bargain with the nation's aluminum producers that will bring employees an annual wage increase of about 11 percent in each of the next three years, plus improved pension benefits for those already retired. Sadly, there is no longer even surprise at such news. With an election looming, President Carter's alleged and voluntary wage restraints have been so modified that the major union leaders can make themselves out to be both defenders of their members against inflation and patriotic inflation-fighters. It has happened now in chemicals, autos, steel and aluminum; indeed, it could have been worse. The aluminum companies are doing well despite the recession and their workers might have held out for even more."

LITERARY talents as various and snide as Henry Adams, Gore Vidal and Allen Drury have written books about Washington, where the donkeys and the elephants consort. We should by now have some fix on the culture of our nation's capital. That we do not have such a fix - that Washington remains for most people as mysterious as the dismal science of economics and what went wrong at Machu Picchu - perhaps accounts for the increasing numbers of Americans who decline to vote.

A former first deputy police commissioner, Mr. Hoffman held the job for only 17 months. He's quitting, it is said, because Mayor Koch plans to name a new, full-time board chairman who would outrank him as chief policy maker. Whether Mr. Hoffman was being too sensitive and the Mayor not sensitive enough are minor questions now. The revolving door to the hospitals keeps spinning, depriving the city and its ailing citizens of reliable management in a critical area. Mr. Hoffman's record is hard to measure. Just five months ago the Mayor rated it as only 6 on a scale of 10. Now he praises the man's ''magnificant job'' in averting financial disaster. The first judgment was crude; the second, probably overstated."

That is just a sampling of what it can be like to be a learning-disabled person."

The Facet BioCam 50-speed bicycle has substituted the conventional chain and gears with a cam-operated power transmission system. The system, called the BioCam Drive, is said to use leg power more efficiently and thus prolong stamina, particularly for the long-distance cyclist. Other features of the machine include a gear range extending from 30 to 150, or 50 percent higher than conventional drives, 50 distinct gear ratios, easier shifting, and, because of the manner in which the BioCam drive functions, reduced pedal resistance. The Facet BioCam 2000 weighs about 30 pounds and costs $1,900; the BioCam 1000 weighs about 32 pounds and costs $1,500. Both have frame sizes ranging from 52 to 64 centimeters, but there are variations in some of the other features. For information as to where the BioCam may be purchased, write to Facet Cycle Inc., Post Office Box 50129, 2929 East Apache, Tulsa, Okla. 74150, (800) 331-3896. Taxidermy Kits"
1980-06-09T00:00:00Z,"I have observed over the years that there is more interest in members of the onion family than in any other form of vegetables or herbs. Perhaps it is because onion-related ingredients - garlic, chives, scallions and so on - are so indispensable in a vast majority of American kitchens. Years ago, someone philosophized that if onions were as scarce as truffles, they would be twice as sought after and more costly than the ''black diamonds.'' Magical and medical properties have also been ascribed to various members of the onion family, garlic in particular. One of the most curious interests that has crossed this desk in some time has to do with a wild herb known as a ramp, also called a wild leek."

Leon Trotsky said about Louis-Ferdinand Celine, who influenced Mr. Miller, that he walked into literature the way most men walked into their living rooms. The same is true of Mr. Miller, who was one of the earliest American authors to perfect a vernacular, conversational style and to use it to write an impressionistic, anecdotal novel about a comic, antiheroic character. In ''Tropic of Cancer,'' we can hear Celine's ''Journey to the End of the Night,'' Dostoyevsky's ''Notes From the Underground,'' Walt Whitman and a smattering of Joyce and Rabelais."

1980-06-09T00:00:00Z,"THE primary point of interest at the second Basically Bach concert, which took place in Avery Fisher Hall on Saturday night, was the performance of Vivaldi's Gloria for chorus and orchestra. Although Vivaldi's large body of sacred choral music has been widely circulated on recordings in recent years, it has not made much headway in the concert hall compared with the general currency given the composer's even more numerous concertos. Vivaldi's style is just as unmistakable in his vocal music as in his instrumental works. There is the same driving rhythmic energy, simple but immediately arresting thematic material and effectively planned dramatic contrasts - all handled in the most direct and exuberant fashion. Perhaps these scores lack the fascinating complexity and capacity for endless rediscovery that one finds in the choral music of Bach, Vivaldi's contemporary in Germany, but such infectious music hardly deserves the neglect it has suffered over the past couple of centuries."

1980-06-10T00:00:00Z,"Administration specialists were briefly elated last week when the House passed a foreign aid bill that would authorize only $86.5 million less than President Carter requested for fiscal 1981. It had been a hard fight, but the House leadership had been able to sidetrack most of the damaging amendments and produce a $5.2 billion package. But the euphoria evaporated as the Administration officials took stock of the struggle with Congress that lay ahead if the United States was to maintain even a minimal aid program during an election year when inflation, budget cutting and increasing unhappiness with the world situation all seemed to combine against it."

Thus, in New York, where a modern Mayor now persues the middle-class vote beyond the traditional bounds of one party, Paul O'Dwyer can think back half a century to a different time, to his first days off the boat from Ireland. Then he found a room in a New York tenement whose landlady routinely pointed out the location of the neighborhood Democratic club, a hotbed for the politics of the have-nots."

I see alarm on your faces: This crazed artist is proposing sheer madness. It can't be done; a President is not a dictator, this is a democracy. Congress would never permit it, the people would howl with wounded national pride, our allies would scream betrayal. It can't be done. But of course it can't be done if everybody starts by saying it can't be done. Let's push our imagination; remember, we're only fantasizing. Let's dare to be simplistic. All right, someone would stand up in the Congress and demand that the President be impeached, declared certifiable, and locked away in a loony bin. Others would agree."

United States officials disclosed that the negotiators had accepted an American proposal for new meetings in Washington as Secretary of State Muskie, in a speech, urged both sides to resist unilateral moves that prejudice ''the final status'' of the occupied territories. (Page A1, Col. 6.) Jordan will again be a guerrilla base, according to a leader of Al Fatah, who said that his organization, the largest group in the Palestine Liberation Organization, planned to reestablish that country as a major base for stepped up operations against Israel. (A1:5-6.) Robert S. McNamara plans to retire a year from now as president of the World Bank. A statement by Mr. McNamara, a former Secretary of Defense, issued on his 64th birthday, raised the possibility that his successor at the bank might not be an American, ending a tradition going back to its creation in 1946. (A1:3-4.) Bonn's coolness toward Washington was underscored in a major political speech by Foreign Minister Hans-Dietrich Genscher, the strongest advocate of American positions in the West German Cabinet for the last four years.

(A1:2.) National President Carter was booed by a crowd of several hundred demonstrators as he visited the slum in Miami that was ravaged last month by rioting, arson and looting. Several bottles were thrown, but Mr. Carter was not harmed. Earlier, he promised to meet private industry ''at least halfway'' to help rebuild the area. (A1:1.) Edward M.

Upholding petitioning on private land, the Supreme Court ruled unanimously that states can require shopping center owners to provide access to citizens to circulate petitions or otherwise peacefully exercise their rights of free speech.

No accidental firing of nuclear arms could be triggered by false alarms in the American air defense system, according to Defense Secretary Harold R. Brown.

Republican leaders of the State Senate announced that the Senate would pass a bill to restore $177 million of items vetoed by Governor Carey, but the bill faces virtually certain defeat in the Democratic-controlled Assembly. The Senate Republican leader has threatened to recess the chamber tomorrow. (A1:4.) Prohibition of new rent increases until landlords disclose profits was urged by Borough President Andrew J. Stein of Manhattan at a hearing before New York City's Rent Guidelines Board.

When these gases and steam are expelled from the hot jet engines and hit the cold upper air, they form cloudlike condensation and streams of water crystals. These crystals melt slowly in the cool air, leaving a faint trail."

1980-06-10T00:00:00Z,"To the Editor: As New York City and its employees once again wrangle at the negotiating table over wage rates and the spiraling cost of living, it is disturbing to see the city's hard-nosed attitude toward its workers striking so resonant a chord in the hearts of New Yorkers. The ''we versus them'' mentality prevalent during the recent transit strike threatens to emerge again. et the range and quality of services here, from mass transit to public health care, is truly outstanding.

More important than necessity is political muscle, including a little noise. If New Yorkers want to avoid a 75-cent fare this year and a $1 fare next year, they need to make the case for transit as strong as automobilists and other groups have made the case against."

ABC stands for Anybody But Carter, but it has come as a surprise to allies that the serious alternative to the incumbent is a former movie star whose probable policies are a mystery to them. The thought is chilling to people here, because however harshly and critically they may speak of an American President, they have a deep sense of his importance to their own lives and fate. Reagan was on French TV the other night, for the first time, in an interview beamed by satellite from his Los Angeles office. He got mixed reviews. Le Monde found him ''less apocalyptic,'' ''wiser'' than it had expected, but unclear and reserved. Serge Dassault, scion of the aeronautics fortune, found him ''evasive,'' ''uncertain,'' less decisive than he had expected, but intriguing."

1980-06-10T00:00:00Z,"DESPITE its rigorous structural underpinnings, Philip Glass's music has always provided a rich, sensual listening experience. This listener, at least, has grown accustomed to hearing it performed by the composer's ensemble of electric keyboards and woodwinds, and the bright, bold colors that ensemble produces have consistently breathed life into the music's strict developmental processes. Mr. Glass has given solo performances in the past, but they've always seemed weak compared to the work of his band. The small electric organs he used produced too narrow a range of colors, and without the steady timekeeping of his musicians, his tempos and articulation were occasionally erratic. So one went to his solo concert at Plymouth Church in Brooklyn Heights on Sunday, a benefit performance for Bargemusic Ltd., with mixed feelings. Happily, the large church organ Mr. Glass was playing on Sunday and the church's fine acoustics provided the body, warmth and textural variety the music needed, and the concert turned out to be both delightful and instructive. It was instructive above all because it placed Mr. Glass's music in a familiar context. The novel instrumentation of his ensemble and his additive rhythmic processes, which are derived in part from Indian music, have combined to make his work sound more exotic than it actually is. Hearing it in Plymouth Church, one realized how naturally much of it would fit into a traditional Christian worship service."

1980-06-10T00:00:00Z,"By James Atlas THE LIFE OF D.H. LAWRENCE. By Keith Sagar. Illustrated. 256 pages. Pantheon. $17.95. BIOGRAPHERS of literary figures face the challenge of how to write about a subject whose life consists largely of sitting alone in a room day after day. Not that writers' lives aren't interesting; the moment when Proust dipped a madeleine in his tea and experienced the involuntary memory that would inspire his great novel, or when Gibbon, loitering on the steps of the Colosseum, decided to write a history of ancient Rome, had the charged intensity of drama. They were the sort of epiphany that can transform a life; and it is these inward revelations that the literary biographer must illuminate."

1980-06-10T00:00:00Z,"DALE is an attractive young Chinese-American who has made it in golden Los Angeles. He's not rich, he explains, but he is definitely ''upper middle.'' He has mastered the art of ordering hors d'oeuvres at Scandia and knows just where to hang out in West Hollywood. Late at night, he takes his hot sports car out on the Ventura Freeway, downshifts and flies with the wind. Still, it hasn't been easy for Dale to escape the ''yellow ghosts'' of his childhood. ''My parents tried to cage me up in their Chineseness,'' Dale says. ''I had to work hard to be a human being just like everybody else.'' ''FOB,'' the new play at the Public Theater, tells what happens when Dale must confront the ethnic roots he thought he had severed. The subject of the evening is a very old one: the price that minorities pay to assimilate in mainstream America. But David Henry Hwang, the play's 22-year-old author, is too rambunctious to tell a familiar story in a tired way. In ''FOB,'' he deals with three distinct cultures, Chinese-American, American and Chinese, and writes in at least that many theatrical styles. Though the result is an unwieldy, at times spotty work, Mr. Hwang hits home far more often than he misses. Surely, ''FOB'' is the first show that has ever attempted to marry the conventional well-made play to Oriental theater and to mix the sensibilities of Maxine Hong Kingston and Norman Lear."

Their high point was in the early 60's, when they won two national knockout titles. Last week they were in action again, winning their Grand National team zonal playoffs, and qualifying for the national quarterfinals in Chicago next month. Rounding out their team were Bill Passell and Dave Strasberg, both of Fort Lauderdale, who were one of New York's strongest partnerships in the 60's and have recently joined forces again as Florida residents."

The St. Louis Bank, which on several occasions had been the first to post a new prime rate, said its move to 12 percent was intended to narrow the gap between the prime, which is the rate that banks charge their most creditworthy corporate customers, and other shortterm interest rates.

Mr. Guston, who would have celebrated his 67th birthday on June 27, had recently received a Creative Arts Award from Brandeis University, citing him for ''notable achievement in the arts.'' Mr. Guston's paintings of the 1950's, in which small, gestural patches of subtle color clustered on a larger field to create an illusion of light, space and air, were highly important to younger painters of the period. Although he worked in this mode for only a few years, his influence was second only to that of Willem de Kooning, and his art was in fact regarded as a kind of lyrical challenge to that of his more ''violent'' Abstract Expressionist colleagues. He was compared with the Impressionists, notably Monet, and labeled an ''abstract impressionist,'' a term he disavowed."

The programs attempt to demonstrate ''how the game of science is played.'' Concentrating on ''problem solving,'' they succeed in being merely puzzling. It is always difficult, of course, to illustrate a process. Consider all the dreadful movies that have been made about artists without being able to convey a smidgen of insight into their creativity.

But everything worked out in the end, at least as far as the chili was concerned; after the program, it was consumed ravenously by the small audience. Aside from the homey chili-cooking lesson, Mr. Grafe's program included an interesting piece of found art, namely an official United States Government code relating to the performance of our national anthem. Various versions of ''The Star-Spangled Banner'' played while Mr. Grafe read the code, which stipulated, among many other things, that even unaccompanied vocalists should be careful to render the anthem in the key of A flat."

This is Brooklyn's civic center. Borough Hall and the massive courthouse loom near by. Educational institutions, public and private, crowd the neighborhood. The Brooklyn Archdiocese and the Board of Education's headquarters are centered here, and so are the large public utilities. The office occupants are no longer the insurance and banking institutions that once were prominent in downtown Brooklyn. Instead one finds mainly professional offices or small service companies or civic groups and, above all, law offices, sharing the estimated 2 million square feet of space in the larger prewar buildings."

Miss Vanderbilt is suing. She says River House is discriminating against her because she is a woman and is a friend of Bobby Short, a pianist and singer who is black. River House says it is not discriminating against her because of her sex or her friends' race, but simply does not want the ''unwelcome publicity'' she would bring to River House."

1980-06-11T00:00:00Z,"How has the recession affected booksellers and publishers? Walking up and down the aisles of the American Booksellers Association trade exhibition here, where the publishers display their fall line, you can hear a dozen viewpoints, but there is agreement that the business has had a rough time in the first half of this year. The reasons are the same as those that affect other industries - the high cost of production, soaring interest rates, the effort to keep prices stable for fear of losing customers while profit percentages are reduced, and caution in overstocking inventories because of buyer resistance. Added to these is the peculiar nature of the business that allows returns of unsold books to publishers for as much as a half-year after they have sat on shelves."

That was demonstrated anew at the Eastern Gourmet Show, which opened at the New York Coliseum Sunday and continues through 1 P.M. today.

In addition, producers may cut output to keep supply in line with demand, sources at OPEC's Algiers meeting said. (Page A1.) Oil industry sources suggest the oil surplus is surprisingly small. (D4.)

Andorra's duty-free and virtually law-free status has been the reason for its prosperity. Cheap electronic gadgetry, video casettes, pocket computers, Chivas Regal, French cheeses, Pierre Cardin styles and other discounted luxury items each year draw more than seven million tourists, four million of them Spaniards, up its narrow valley between France and Spain."

1980-06-11T00:00:00Z,"Few things have changed more radically in the lifetime of Americans over 40 than the legal definition of obscenity. Until the 1950's, important works by reputable writers had to be smuggled into the United States - such items as Lawrence's ''Lady Chatterley's Lover'' and even Nabokov's ''Lolita.'' But the most widely smuggled books were the novels of Henry Miller, who was clearly, almost proudly, disreputable. For a generation of American students, buying paperback copies of Mr. Miller's works was as much a Parisian rite as having a cafe filtre at Les Deux Magots in the hope of glimpsing some famous existentialist. How carefully these volumes were wrapped in deceptive dustjackets so that U.S. Customs would not encounter ''Tropic of Cancer.'' All the fun went out of the game when the courts decided in 1964 that Mr. Miller had redeeming social value after all."
1980-06-11T00:00:00Z,"The 28th season of the Stratford Festival, Canada, the sixth under the artistic direction of Robin Phillips, opened last night with a resplendent production of ''Twelfth Night,'' one that articulates the work's melancholic humor as well as its beauty and sagacity. Primary among its numerous assets, Mr. Phillips's production features Brian Bedford as Malvolio, a performance of grand comic dimension. It is Malvolio, Olivia's misanthropic steward, who gives us an ironic perspective on this fanciful world of shifting guises, an Illyria in which mistaken identity is carried to extremes of dissimulation. Malvolio is both an insufferable moralist and a harbinger of a society that would subordinate sentiment to reason. Unlike Tartuffe, whom he somewhat superficially resembles, he has a certain unquenchable integrity."

1980-06-11T00:00:00Z,"IN a scene midway through ''Bronco Billy,'' the best and funniest Clint Eastwood movie in quite a while, the cowboy of the title strides into a bank. And he starts to cash a check for $3, because in this movie all of the nice people are poor. Suddenly, two bank robbers burst in, and they scare a little boy, one of many innocent customers in the place. The little boy drops his piggy bank and it shatters. This is too much for Bronco Billy. He give the bandits The Look, an indignant squint that means, roughly translated, ''Grrr,'' and then he hauls off and fires away. What makes all this unusual for Mr. Eastwood, who directed the disarmingly boyish ''Bronco Billy'' and stars in the title role, is that the cowboy is more interested in the child than he is in the holdup men, and that he shoots the villains fairly politely, as if he didn't mean to do them any harm. Indeed, Mr. Eastwood is almost playing a very large Peter Pan. The locale may be Idaho instead of never-never land, but the feeling is that of a fairy tale, as Bronco Billy wanders through the West with a troupe of lost boys and girls. This is an emphatically American fable, which is perhaps why it ends with a chorus of ''Stars and Stripes Forever.''"

In a wide-ranging interview about his health, he said he would have the White House physician test him periodically and would resign if serious evidence of senility or mental deterioration were detected. (A1:2-3.) Bill Brock may be replaced as chairman of the Republican National Committee despite consequent risks to Ronald Reagan's drive to promote party unity, according to Reagan campaign sources. They said that Mr. Brock, who is widely respected, would probably be offered a high post in the Reagan campaign if Mr. Reagan agrees with recommendations by his advisers to seek a new chairman. (A28:3-5.) A move to bolster the Carter campaign was reported by sources in the campaign and the White House. They said that Hamilton Jordan, who has been the main campaign strategist, was expected to leave his post as the White House chief of staff to devote full time to the Carter campaign. (A27:1-3.) Confusion about what is best to eat appears more widespread among Americans than ever before. The public has been buffeted by conflicting advice from scientists, food producers, nutritionists and the Government. If you follow everything they tell you, one shopper said, ''you might as well stop living or become a vegetarian.'' (A1:1-2.) The House censured a Representative for violating House rules by converting campaign funds to his own use. The Congressman, Charles H. Wilson of California, who was defeated in the Democratic primary on June 3, is the third House member to be censured in this century. (A16:1-2.) Conservation zoning was upheld by the Supreme Court, which ruled unaimously that an ordinance that limits development does not necessarily violate the constitutional rights of affected property owners.

Metropolitan Topless dancing in bars was upheld by the New York State Court of Appeals, which quashed a 1977 state law that prohibited such entertainment in premises licensed by the State Liquor Authority. Voting 4 to 3, the state's highest tribunal ruled that the prohibiton was unconstitutional because topless dancing ''is not inherently obscene'' and has been permitted elsewhere, including theaters.

1980-06-11T00:00:00Z,"UNTIL something better comes along, James Bridges's ''Urban Cowboy'' is the most entertaining, most perceptive commercial American movie of the year to date. Here is a tough-talking, softhearted romantic melodrama that sees a world that is far more bleak than the movie, or the characters in it, ever have time to acknowledge. The film, which stars John Travolta in a fine recovery from his disastrous liaison with Lily Tomlin in ''Moment by Moment,'' will inevitably be compared with ''Saturday Night Fever,'' which transformed Mr. Travolta into the pop icon of the dying 1970's and was also about the class Evelyn Waugh called the Lower Orders, and about what the Lower Orders do when they hang out."

Here is Mr. Greenburg's account: I hadn't specifically indicated that this was the night I intended to propose, but conceivably Suzanne knew that something was up. Before we went out, I bought her four dozen roses. It's not that I don't often buy her flowers, it's just that I don't often buy her four dozen at a crack."
1980-06-11T00:00:00Z,"One of the most complex factors contributing to the confusion at the two-day meeting of the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries was the knotty question of just how big the worldwide surplus of oil is these days. According to industry analysts in the United States, the surprising answer is no longer very big. OPEC leaders repeatedly suggested that the group was producing at least one million barrels a day more than the world needed, and the subject was apparently a touchy one in Algiers. At one point, Ali Akbar Moinfar, Iran's oil minister, reportedly got into a shouting match over the issue with Tayeh Abdul Karim, the minister from Iraq. Mr. Moinfar accused Iraq of selling out to the West by increasing its production, thereby preventing Iran from selling all but token quantities of its higher-priced oil."

1980-06-11T00:00:00Z,"Richard Bonelli, American operatic baritone, died at his home in Los Angeles on Saturday. He was 91 years old. Mr. Bonelli was one of the most popular artists of his generation. His career began late, but it lasted a long time and encompassed radio, concerts, films, both light and grand opera and even television. He was proud of the fact that he sang in one of the first sound films, a Fox Movietone short; in the first radio broadcast of a complete opera from Chicago, and in an early experimental opera telecast. When he made his American debut with the Chicago Civic Opera in 1925, his success was recorded in The New York Times. The opera was Verdi's ''La Traviata,'' and his co-stars were Claudia Muzio and Antonio Cortis. The newspaper quoted Chicago critics as saying that he ''has a fine vocal sense, a good style for one of the most elegant of baritone parts, and an amply imaginative sense of the stage.''"
1980-06-11T00:00:00Z,"The attention given to the setting of limits - whether limits on the growth of the average American's standard of living, or limits on the size and scope of programs designed to aid the poor and needy - has a strongly conservative cast to it. Arguments made about limits tend to be framed in terms of trimming the existing system of social and economic programs. For those whose current living standard and quality of life are insufficient, the discussion of limits appears to be a prelude to even grimmer times. As the argument is being cast by President Carter and some of his policy makers, by Mayor Koch and the Health and Hospitals Corporation, by Ronald Reagan and his advisers, the discussion of limits leads only to a sense of futility and powerlessness regarding our ability to shape and control the growing forces of economic contraction."

The contracting concern, Edward B. Fitzpatrick Inc., stopped work on the pipe on May 23 because of a disagreement over materials being used in the job. Its president, Edward B. Fitzpatrick Jr., said he ordered a halt because the county had refused to absolve the company of responsibility for possible future breaks or leaks in the pipe."

Mr. Sutton, a retired importer of French lace who developed an interest in Sephardic Jews and decided to return to school, was awarded a Master of Arts degree in sociology. The main address was given by Speaker Stanley Fink of the New York State Assembly, an alumnus of Brooklyn College. ''Around us has been a rubble of discontent and uncertainty highlighting a lack of faith in one another and in our institutions,'' he said.

What about junk food, and what about the automobile, which has cluttered the streets of Teheran? If Khomeini is against that, then I would say he is not so crazy after all.

Appropriately enough, one of these shows - bearing a delightful title, ''From Silver Spouts the Grateful Liquors Glide,'' drawn from Alexander Pope's ''Rape of the Lock'' - is devoted to fine silver. The others are a show of ''Master Drawings'' that includes examples of Durer, Domenico Tiepolo and Degas; and a miscellany of prints, books and drawings called ''Never Say Die,'' which is devoted to the theme of horses and horsemanship. This is a subject in which Robert Sterling Clark (1877-1955), well known in his day as an owner of race horses, had a passionate interest."

But responsible citizens' groups, like the Educational Priorities Panel and the United Parents Association, believe classroom teaching will suffer if the Mayor doesn't relent further. They are right. Mr. Koch's responsibility to balance the budget has been made even harder by the evaporation of once promised Federal and state aid. But whether that aid is restored or not, classroom services ought to be at the top of the list of restorations as the Board of Estimate reviews the Mayor's proposals. The next generation of New Yorkers ought not to be further burdened by today's austerity."

But he was neither heady with success nor even very impressed, and he considered the vital statistics behind that stoical state of mind, too: the oldest of eight children in a struggling family in Houston's Third Ward, part-time jobs before and after school, threeand-a-half lonely years in the minor leagues, then three years in last place in the major leagues."

1980-06-11T00:00:00Z,"The tragic Miami rioting and the ugly protests that greeted President Carter there on Monday have been jarring reminders of a nightmare America has been eager to forget. Urban unrest obviously can recur, especially where the conditions that provoked it in the 1960's persist. Twelve years ago, the National Advisory Commission on Civil Disorders found that police brutality was the chief grievance in riot-torn neighborhoods. Outrage over police violence ignited many of the earlier riots. The needless resort to deadly official force does more than nullify a criminal suspect's right to trial. It may ignite community anger, especially among the urban poor who feel put upon by society and its guardians of justice. Police forces need constant reminder that they can contribute to the violence they deplore. And some rules on their conduct need tightening."

1980-06-11T00:00:00Z,"There is a benignly brooding ''video portrait'' of John Cage greeting people in the lobby of the Walker Art Center here. That's only appropriate, because people are gathering for a nine-day festival called New Music America that began Saturday night. This is a follow-up to a similar festival held last June at the Kitchen in New York, and part of what is now hoped will be an annual event in different parts of the country, all devoted to the openly experimental spirit that Mr. Cage pioneered. There are good reasons for this second festival to be in Minneapolis-St. Paul, but the reasons are more institutional than creative. As Roy M. Close, music critic of The Minneapolis Star, points out in the festival catalogue, the Twin Cities have never been the home of a particularly strong school of experimental composers. But local institutions, above all the Walker Art Center and the St. Paul Chamber Orchestra, have more than made up the slack, and the result is an active audience and support system for such music. The festival is being presented by the center and The Star, and the first evening's performances were by the chamber orchestra."

1980-06-11T00:00:00Z,"IN a scene midway through ''Bronco Billy,'' the best and funniest Clint Eastwood movie in quite a while, the cowboy of the title strides into a bank. And he starts to cash a check for $3, because in this movie all of the nice people are poor. Suddenly, two bank robbers burst in, and they scare a little boy, one of many innocent customers in the place. The little boy drops his piggy bank and it shatters. This is too much for Bronco Billy. He give the bandits The Look, an indignant squint that means, roughly translated, ''Grrr,'' and then he hauls off and fires away. What makes all this unusual for Mr. Eastwood, who directed the disarmingly boyish ''Bronco Billy'' and stars in the title role, is that the cowboy is more interested in the child than he is in the holdup men, and that he shoots the villains fairly politely, as if he didn't mean to do them any harm. Indeed, Mr. Eastwood is almost playing a very large Peter Pan. The locale may be Idaho instead of never-never land, but the feeling is that of a fairy tale, as Bronco Billy wanders through the West with a troupe of lost boys and girls. This is an emphatically American fable, which is perhaps why it ends with a chorus of ''Stars and Stripes Forever.''"

1980-06-11T00:00:00Z,"AS far as I can tell, the only thing wrong with ''Album,'' David Rimmer's new play at the WPA Theater, is its length. At 90 minutes, this is one evening that seems about a half-hour too short. Mr. Rimmer has created four real and likable characters, all high school kids of the 60's, and allowed us to enter their lives and dreams. When we finally must bid them goodbye, the morning after their senior prom, it's a rough parting. Like the teen-agers on stage, we could stay up all night. ''Album'' is a perfect illustration of the fact that there are no stale subjects, only stale writers. Mr. Rimmer has made some very familiar material seem new. ''Album'' is about adolescents coming of age, about the joys and pitfalls of young love, about the birth of a cataclysmic decade. As the title indicates, the play is set to the rock music that defined its characters' world. But this is not a rehash of ''American Graffiti'' or ''Vanities.'' Mr. Rimmer has his own observations to make; he describes his people with dead-on wit, no-nonsense intelligence and the kind of generous affection that is contagious. His writing is so specific that we don't need an epilogue to tell us what happens to his foursome after 1967. The lives on stage play on in our imagination well after the final lights go down."

In practice, it turned out that Richard Westenburg had managed to blend the sombre with the spirited fairly well. Yet there was a nagging inconclusiveness to the evening, which was partly a fault of some of the pieces, partly of the performances and partly of the large, modern hall in which all this took place. Mr. Westenburg began with the sombre, in the form of Purcell's Funeral Music for Queen Mary. Here he chose to play the brass and drums music on the stage but to deploy his chorus in the rear of the orchestra seats. The division of forces was striking, but slightly eccentric, too. Still, the performance was a measured and noble one, befitting this measured and noble music."

1980-06-11T00:00:00Z,"UNTIL something better comes along, James Bridges's ''Urban Cowboy'' is the most entertaining, most perceptive commercial American movie of the year to date. Here is a tough-talking, softhearted romantic melodrama that sees a world that is far more bleak than the movie, or the characters in it, ever have time to acknowledge. The film, which stars John Travolta in a fine recovery from his disastrous liaison with Lily Tomlin in ''Moment by Moment,'' will inevitably be compared with ''Saturday Night Fever,'' which transformed Mr. Travolta into the pop icon of the dying 1970's and was also about the class Evelyn Waugh called the Lower Orders, and about what the Lower Orders do when they hang out."

Michener, the most consistent best-selling novelist of our time, has sold book-club rights to his next work, ''The Covenant,'' to the Book-of-the-Month Club's arch rival, the Literary Guild, for what is believed to be the highest amount ever paid by a book club for a novel: reportedly $1,750,000. The transaction, completed a week ago, after strong bidding between the two major book clubs, has been kept secret by the publisher, Random House, and club executives because of the general feeling that prices paid for a handful of leading books have gone through the roof, and that revealing an actual amount encourages other authors and their agents to seek similar deals."

The real third party in 1860 was the Constitutional Union Party, whose candidate, John Bell, won 39 of 303 electoral votes."

The textile mills spew smoke and noise that settle on yet another industrial byproduct, expanding slums of cardboard and tin huts. The assault on the senses is unrelieved and privacy here is even more of an elusive abstraction than in the rest of India. But along with the harsh tumult there is also a hopeful vitality. The slums are cleaner than in other places. The raucous activity is purposeful and in this place, which was the home of Gandhi, there are still strong and idealistic personalities seeking to change and improve the general quality of life. There is, for example, Ela Bhatt, a small 45-year-old woman who steered the growth of a remarkable labor union of women who worked at the threshhold of the economy and lived at the margin of existence. These were the ragpickers, cart-pullers, porters, vegetable vendors and others who raised families while hiring out their labor for the lowest imaginable wages."

One wonders again at his strange intervention in the Ramsey Clark affair: his comment that he would like to see Clark and other ''American dissidents,'' as he called them, prosecuted for going to Iran. In terms of our legal system, the remark was a damaging faux pas. It is not the business of Presidents to make suggestions about prosecuting particular individuals. Those decisions are for the Justice Department, and Presidential intervention can only make the process look political. After Richard Nixon it should not be necessary to say so."

I have yet to see a person in a wheelchair travel from street to sidewalk without aid by using one of these slopes in the concrete. But I have seen a number of older persons slip on these surfaces when they are covered with ice. Some of them - and it is cruel, not ironic - have consequently ended up in wheelchairs. The Government has made the winter existence of all of us in Northern states more unsafe with its alleged concern for the handicapped."

1980-06-12T00:00:00Z,"There is no time left for members of New York's City Council and Board of Estimate to inflate the hopes of constituents. An approved budget is due on the Mayor's desk today. Good arguments are easy to find for the familiar flow of promises: more policemen, more school spending, more aid for cultural institutions, and no new taxes. But the argument to make final and realistic choices makes more sense. The city will never have a better chance to balance income against outgo, without fictitious gimmicks. Mayor Koch urges a balance in the coming year (1981) but not because the law requires it. There is one more year to squeeze the last $150 million of borrowed money out of the cash income side of the ledger. But waiting until next year would make the task still harder. Perched precariously on a financial tightrope in fiscal 1982, the city would have to lop off at one stroke enough expenses to cover the as yet undetermined wage increases of its workers plus the improperly classified capital items. And it would probably not have the benefit of the hefty cash balance now in hand."

In a midnight conversion to the views of Jimmy Carter, Ayatollah Khomeini declares that ''the masses cannot any longer govern'' Iran, that the revolution has become its own worst enemy, that the nation needs a government to address its terrible problems and finally end the distraction of the hostage game. Simultaneously, in pious surrender to a poll of the crowd, President Carter announces that he favors a trial for the Americans who defied his travel ban to Iran. Did Mr. Carter conclude that he cannot campaign without flailing the Iranian issue just as the Ayatollah discovered he cannot govern by flailing the American issue? We know who is coaching the Ayatollah. For this week, anyway, President Bani-Sadr has had the ear of the old man, proving to him that the continuing execution of Iranians and imprisonment of Americans are acts of defiance by extremists who value power for themselves ahead of the welfare of the country. These factions were close to strangling Mr. Bani-Sadr, condemning him as ''pro-Western'' and ''non-Islamic'' and using the hostages to dramatize his impotence. They have used their power on the Revolutionary Council to block negotiation for the release of the Americans, to hold out for a Prime Minister and Cabinet of their choosing and, thus, to let the economy slide toward chaos."

To many dealers, the main reason for the rebound in the fixedincome markets was the absence of the Federal Reserve from the money market as the Federal funds rate dipped.

Central Park on a Sunday afternoon is an extremely unpleasant place to be. My Chelsea neighborhood is quieter, more relaxing and less intimidating. To see Park Service rangers juxtaposed with drug dealers and sausage vendors is a tragedy. Police cruise the roads looking for violent crime, not having the time, resources or inclination to harass citizens on petty matters such as drug use, noise pollution, littering and the like. It is a bigger zoo than the zoo itself. Road races, softball leagues, carnivals, concerts and so on are obviously worthwhile activities, but their overall impact on the quality of the park is decidedly negative.

Now she has hit pay dirt in ''Opal Loop/Cloud Installation No. 72503,'' which had its premiere Tuesday night at 55 Crosby Street and which will be performed through Saturday."
1980-06-12T00:00:00Z,"SEATTLE, June 11 The nation's mayors wrapped up their annual convention in time-honored fashion today by passing resolutions asking for more money from the Federal Government more money for jobs, more for housing, more for transportation, pollution control and countless other ambitions that, given these times and this Congress and this Administration, they have no chance of fulfilling."

1980-06-12T00:00:00Z,"BOSTON, June 11 What values are there inside Jimmy Carter, what real beliefs?

1980-06-12T00:00:00Z,"Clearly uneasy about changes in their lives and in the society around them, 13,000 messengers of the Southern Baptist Convention used their annual meeting here this week to reaffirm traditional Baptist ways. They did so by singing traditional hymns like ''Stand Up, Stand Up for Jesus'' and ''A Mighty Fortress Is Our God'' morning, noon and night, listening to dozens of sermons from the country's best Southern Baptist preachers and reaffirming confidence in the Second Coming of Christ. By the year 2000, through an operation called Bold Mission Thrust, they vowed that every living person on earth would have an opportunity to respond to the Gospel."
1980-06-12T00:00:00Z,"IT is odd that so few audio fans have tasted the rewards of making their own ''live'' recordings. One reason may be that microphones somehow seem more formidable than other audio components, though why this is so is quite puzzling. Possibly it's a matter of ''image'' - if that's a proper word for something so vague. We usually see pundits and politicians talking into microphones, so one might gain an impression that these devices are intended mainly for persons of prominence. But the fact is that a microphone (or two, if recording is to be done in stereo) will open whole new areas of audio activity for anyone with a good tape deck. After all, many families and almost every neighborhood has talents - amateur musicians, church choirs or perhaps theater groups - who would be pleased to have someone competently record their performances or rehearsals. Such recordings may stimulate selfcriticism, a trait sometimes underdeveloped in aspirants of the muses."
1980-06-12T00:00:00Z,"In the 1970's Americans discovered gourmet dining,'' said an executive of a major food corporation. ''In the 1980's people will be more interested in nutrition than anything else, and that concern will increase at every income level of our society.'' Evidence of that concern, said the executive, Juan E. Metzger, vice president of the Beatrice Foods Company and head of its Dannon Yogurt division, is leading to a growing emphasis in the industry on the marketing of nutrition as opposed to the mere selling of food."

1980-06-12T00:00:00Z,"The Carter Administration has clearly decided to play the ''China card'' vigorously. This has been signaled by the visit of Geng Biao, one of China's Deputy Prime Ministers, to the United States in May and the resulting agreement to provide military-support equipment to his country, and by Defense Secretary Harold Brown's trip to China in January. While playing the card makes sense from the perspective of preempting Presidential-campaign charges of the Administration's being ''soft'' on Moscow, and it makes Americans who feel impotent in the face of Soviet advances feel better, there are at least four reasons not to play the hand as it now is being played."
1980-06-12T00:00:00Z,"To the Editor: There has been entirely too much complaint about Messrs. Carter and Reagan and the political process, as though it were some vast, impersonal machine that had delivered up candidates nobody wants. I think The Times is falling irresponsibly short of its obligation to help people understand the actual political process better.ndeed we are going to have to choose between Carter and Reagan and possibly Anderson, but the reason for this is that these candidates have won the overwhelming number of primaries and thus the endorsement of American citizens who care enough to come out and vote."

1980-06-12T00:00:00Z,"The worldwide uranium industry, which is already experiencing severe oversupply and reduced demand, faces a substantial jump in productive capacity over the next decade, according to a recently published study of uranium mining operations. The increase in capacity is likely to accompany a marked shift to lower-cost mines, the study suggests, indicating that a number of present high-cost producers could be forced out of the market. The study was published late last month by the Commodities Research Unit, a London-based research consulting company that specializes in resource industries. The study is for sale at $30,000 a copy."
1980-06-12T00:00:00Z,"The winning of a major title by players who work together, as well as play bridge together, is a rare event.

1980-06-12T00:00:00Z,"JOSEPH E. STICKLAND and Fredric L. Berg are not the kind of guys who need a brick wall to fall on them to get them going on something. So when, as marketing consultants, they kept hearing clients asking them about the most efficient delivery system for cents-off coupons they set about developing one of their own. ''They were looking for the broadest reach with the lowest cost,'' said 40-year-old Joe Stickland, ''Suddenly, we said, 'God, we've got it and it's been there all along.' ''"

1980-06-12T00:00:00Z,"Two months ago, at the start of preparations for the Venice summit meeting that President Carter will attend later this month, the American Embassy in Rome got a message from the Secret Service in Washington asking what provisions were being made for the Presidential motorcade. When the embassy answered that there was not going to be a motorcade, a huffy message came back saying, in effect, ''What do you mean, we have always had a motorcade wherever the President went.''"
1980-06-12T00:00:00Z,"The International Labor Organization has become known in recent years for doing good economic and social work and adopting bad political resolutions. For 27 months, this combination deprived the agency of essential United States participation and budgetary support. Now, only months after America's return to the I.L.O., a new resolution concerning the West Bank threatens the understanding by which the return was arranged. The recurring problem comes not from the I.L.O.'s normal efforts to promote worker rights and employment but from the excesses and inconsistencies of its annual conferences. Member countries have been quick enough to condemn Israel over questions having little directly to do with labor practices but they have been inversely slow to investigate blatant violations of labor rights in the Soviet bloc. For a time, the American boycott seemed to induce restraint and more evenhandedness, as well as some important procedural reforms. But the American return has been greeted by a decision of the Resolutions Committee to give priority to a Jordanian motion condemning Israeli settlement policies on the West Bank. It is part of the Arab campaign to press the case against Israel in every international body."
1980-06-12T00:00:00Z,"Representative John B. Anderson appears to be making progress toward qualifying for the ballot in enough states to have a theoretical chance of being elected President. President Carter said yesterday that he would consider debating Mr. Anderson, or any other candidate, who could conceivably win in November. The statement reversed the President's earlier refusal to debate Mr. Anderson and reflected a growing sensitivity in the Carter camp to charges that they were harassing the independent candidate."

1980-06-12T00:00:00Z,"International West European leaders will meet today in Venice to search for ways to arrest what many of them view as a slide toward a world crisis. The chiefs of the Common Market countries are expected to call for the inclusion of the Palestine Liberation Organization in future Middle East peace negotiations. Another high-level Western meeting that will include the United States, Canada and Japan is also to convene in Venice, on June 22. (Page A1, Col.1.) Tight security safeguards in Venice have been prepared by a force of about 8,000 men, including hundreds of antiterrorist experts and a frogmen's unit in advance of the Western summit meetings. The city of canals poses special safety problems. (A1:2.) The Prime Minister of Japan died after a heart attack at the age of 70. The death of Masayoshi Ohira left his governing party leaderless 10 days before Parliamentary elections. (A1:4-5.) Britain is sending troops to New Hebrides and French riot police arrived in the South Pacific archipelago. London said its mission was designed ''to provide stability'' in the uneasy situation in the islands, which are to gain independence next month. (A5:1.) Energy Oil prices were raised by four members of OPEC. Kuwait, Venezuela, Iraq and Qatar increased prices as much as $2 a barrel. Saudi Arabia, the cartel's largest producer, and the United Arab Emirates left open the possibility of increases by next September, when OPEC is to meet in a new attempt to agree on a uniform price. (A1:3.) National A budget deadlock was broken as House and Senate conferees approved $613.6 billion in spending for the next fiscal year, with a slightly smaller allowance for the military than was provided in a previous agreement opposed by the Carter Administration and rejected by the House. The new plan won speedy voice-vote approval in the Senate, which sought to insure that the House would go along in a vote scheduled for today. (A1:6.) A new White House chief of staff was named. The appointee is Jack H. Watson Jr., who has been in charge of the Cuban refugee program and other domestic problems. He replaces Hamilton Jordan, who has been spending much of his time on Mr. Carter's re-election campaign and will now devote full time to accelerating it. (A1:4-5.) John B. Anderson seems to be gaining in his goal to qualify for the ballot in enough states to have a theoretical chance of being elected President. In response, President Carter's campaign is stepping up its efforts to challenge the independent candidate's legal position in several key states. (B12:2-5.) Government treatment of Haitians is the subject of a major legal controversy and a trial that could determine whether the thousands of refugees will remain in this country or are sent home. Lawyers for the Haitians contend there is a pattern of harassment and discrimination, but the Government says that this is not the case and that it has merely tried to carry out immigration laws. (A1:3-6.) Stress on the marketing of nutrition as opposed to the mere selling of food is rising in the industry in response to increasing consumer interest in proper eating habits. Food industry executives say that increasingly large sums of money are being invested in the research, development and advertising of nutritious products. (A1:1-3.) Registration for a draft advanced as Senator Mark O. Hatfield, Republican of Oregon, ended 31 hours of delaying tactics and cleared the way for a final Senate vote on the bill today. Passage is expected. The House has approved a similar bill and President Carter is considered certain to sign the final legislation. (A20:1-2.) The renomination of President Carter is considered certain by nearly all leading politicians in Washington. An exception is Robert C.Byrd, the Senate majority leader, who has declined to comment on speculation that he fears a Carter campaign might cost the Democrats their Senate majority. (B12:1-2.) Metropolitan Failures in basic skills tests among students now completing their sophomore year in the City University of New York were reported by university officials. They said that nearly a quarter of the students had not passed examinations in reading, writing and mathematics. Those who failed any of the tests must seek an extension to remain in college and to retake the tests. (A1:3-4.) A retreat in mandating sex education at all grade levels in New Jersey schools occurred as the State Board of Education bowed to strong opposition from legislators and community groups. The board sharply modified the proposed family-life program, eliminating specific course topics and permitting local school boards to develop the curriculum for the program, which is to begin in 1983. (B1:1.) A strike against the PATH railroad was called by the carmen's union. It voted 134 to 3 to reject a contract offer by the Port Authority of New York and New Jersy and to approve a walkout, beginning at 12:01 A.M. today. (B2:1-4.) Mayor Koch is courting minorities in what he terms a ''campaign'' to publicize his record. It is the second time in less than a year that he has begun a drive to enhance his image among blacks and other minorities, contending again that the strained relations are primarily due to his public image, a contention that some black elected officials dispute.

1980-06-12T00:00:00Z,"The credit markets recovered yesterday, climbing out of the slump they entered Tuesday. Bond prices advanced, new corporate bonds sold rapidly, and some were increased in size. Short-term interest rates dropped. To many dealers, the main reason for the rebound in the fixedincome markets was the absence of the Federal Reserve from the money market as the Federal funds rate dipped. On Tuesday, the central bank had twice drained reserves from the banking system in actions that were widely interpreted as a sign that the monetary authorities did not want short-term rates any lower. By remaining out of the market yesterday, the Federal Reserve raised many doubts about this view."

1980-06-12T00:00:00Z,"There is a man who likes to work barefoot in the Carter campaign's omniscient watch over its convention delegates. This man, Tony Corrado, reads Goethe to unwind at the end of a long day of talking to 20 or so Carter delegates and reassuring them on such verities as their convention hotel reservations -precise room and telephone numbers are already entered in the campaign's computer bank - and the invincibility of the Carter majority. At this point, with partisans of Senator Edward M. Kennedy vowing to undo somehow the results of the completed primary season, Camelot's Grail has never seemed more deeply buried. A new metaphor for political saga - the self-willed ''Force'' and gadgetry of Star Wars, perhaps -seems required to measure the dominant Carter campaign as exemplified by Mr. Corrado and other intense workers of the President's special delegate-watching corps."

Doug Wickenheiser of the Regina Pats, who was selected by the Montreal Canadiens to open the draft, is one of the few among the 210 players selected who are given much of a chance to play immediately. Because of the uncertainty involved in drafting such young players, general managers are beginning to borrow the tactics of horse trainers. They are drafting players with good ''bloodlines'' as Bill Torrey, general manager of the Islanders, put it."

1980-06-12T00:00:00Z,"IT sounded like the plot of an old Hollywood movie. A week before opening night, the producers of one of the most expensive and eagerly awaited musicals of the season decide they need a new leading lady. They quickly hold auditions, find a young actress, and they tell her she has five days to memorize the lines and master all the songs and dances before she goes on stage. As in most old movies, the ending is a happy one. The actress not only learns the part, but also dazzles the critics. After years of waitressing and comedic roles, she is suddenly a star. It was not an old movie, though. It was one of those wonderful and improbable stories that happen only in the theater. The play, in this case, is ''Camelot,'' the revival of the Lerner and Loewe musical starring Richard Burton, which will open on Broadway July 2, following its current tryout in Toronto. And the new star is 27-yearold Christine Ebersole, who opened there last Sunday to critical and popular acclaim as Queen Guenevere - a role she prepared, remarkably enough, in three days of rehearsal and two previews."

The case is being hailed by some First Amendment lawyers as a ''stunning reversal'' of a similar case in New Jersey two years ago, when M. A. Farber, a New York Times reporter, went to jail for 40 days and The Times was fined $286,000, because Mr. Farber refused to turn over unpublished material that had been subpoenaed by a defendant in a murder trial. At that time, the New Jersey Supreme Court held that the state shield law did not apply to Mr. Farber, because, in effect, the constitutional rights of the defendant seeking the information overrode the reporter's. It added, however, that in the future a hearing would be required before any reporter could be compelled to turn over unpublished material."

1980-06-12T00:00:00Z,"The most frightening thing about that hotly disputed study of chromosome damage at Love Canal was its finding of ''supernumerary acentric fragments'' in the cells of several residents. Just the sound of those ominous polysyllables was enough to convince many residents, who had heard much truly frightening information about the nearby chemical dump, that they faced new, grave dangers. The kind of chromosome damage at issue, the study said, normally occurs in only one of every 100 people. Finding it in eight of 36 Love Canalers was startling. Even after the study was criticized for failing to include a control group, its director, Dr. Dante Picciano, and its sponsor, the Federal Environmental Protection Agency, held to the belief that the ''supernumerary acentric chromosomes'' might warn of something terrible. True, there were skeptics. Some chromosome experts said they were unfamiliar with the term ''supernumerary acentric fragments'' and wondered what Dr. Picciano was seeing under his microscope. Their doubts were not eased when he refused to show his evidence to the first group of expert reviewers. So E.P.A. wisely created another review panel to look at photocopies of the damning research photographs. That panel is about to submit its final report. According to its organizer, Dr. Roy Albert of New York University, it found no evidence of ''supernumerary acentric fragments'' - that is, excess material - in the chromosomes of any of the eight purported victims. It did find technical and interpretive errors in the study. And it did detect some chromosomal abnormalities among Love Canalers, but within normal limits."

He may vow never to use that brand again - even if it was a top quality brand with a proven reputation for durability. But in most cases, the problem is not the paint, or even how it was applied. The fault more often lies in improper preparation of the old surface before the new coat of paint is applied. The directions printed on almost every can of exterior paint stipulate that to insure a long-lasting job the old surface must be clean (free of dirt, grease, dust and chalky powder) and in relatively sound condition (the old paint should not be cracked, peeling or flaking)."

The answer requires a bit of background first. On Tuesday night, the 42-year-old Mr. Wolf switched from WABC-TV to WCBS-TV, making his debut on WCBS's 11 P.M. news program. WABC had sued to prevent its popular sportscaster from jumping ship, but late Tuesday, the Appellate Division of the State Supreme Court lifted an injunction, and Mr. Wolf became free to join WCBS a day earlier than he had anticipated. To answer why the two stations have been competing so hard to pay Mr. Wolf so much - he had been earning $250,000 under his previous contract -let's go first to television's bottom line, the audiencepopularity ratings."

Today, our inner cities are worse off.In the South Bronx, additional unprofitable buildings have been abandoned by landlords and more families have left. Despite millions of dollars in aid, the district is still declining. The South Bronx, where more than 20 percent of the population, mostly skilled middle-income residents, has moved out in the last 10 years, is a dramatic example of how orthodox urban policies have failed. Government action has actually aggravated the situation. Rent control has destroyed the private rental market, urban renewal has replaced old brick slums with new concrete slums, and costly Government programs aimed at attracting business have proved ineffective. While most ''experts'' continue to believe that pouring tax money into cities is the way to stop decay, on both sides of the Atlantic some new ideas have been taking hold.In the 1960's, writers such as Jane Jacobs, author of ''The Death and Life of Great American Cities,'' began to question conventional dogma. Urban-renewal planners, she argued, had failed to understand the crucial features of a successful city environment: the importance of old buildings, small businesses, mixed uses, individualism."

As a first step, a squadron of 12 F-4 jets, along with 400 personnel, will be sent to Egypt for 90 days and train with Egyptian forces. (A1:1.) U.S. displeasure toward South Korea and its military-dominated leadership was reflected in steps reported by top Carter Administration officials. They said that Washington had postponed indefinitely a high-level economic mission to Seoul and was actively reviewing its ties with South Korea, except a basic security commitment. (A9:2-4.) A deep crisis in Poland's national life was cited in a secret report prepared by more than 100 leaders, many of them in the governing Communist establishment. The report said that unless the Government moved aggressively to reform major inequities and mismanagement, the shortcomings would worsen and might bring about ''open social conflict.'' (A2:3-6.) A new call for release of the hostages in Iran would be sought in the Security Council under a proposal by Donald F. McHenry, the chief American delegate to the United Nations, according to American sources. The proposal would cite last month's unanimous ruling by the World Court that the captives must be freed. (A11:1-2.) National Draft registration late next month is in prospect for four million young men. The Senate approved the registration by a vote of 58 to 34. The measure must be passed again by the House because of a minor difference in the two chambers' versions of the bill, but that action is expected soon and President Carter is expected to sign the legislation early next week. (A1:6.) A major civil rights victory was won by President Carter as the House passed a bill designed to strengthen Federal efforts to end housing discrimination. Approval came on a vote of 310 to 95, but only after the House rejected, by a vote of 209 to 196, an attempt to strip the Government of powers to fight discrimination. The bill now goes to the Senate. (A1:5.) The discount rate was lowered by the Federal Reserve for the second time in two weeks. The board's decision to cut the rate, which it charges banks for loans, to 11 percent from 12 percent, appeared to signal an accelerating attempt to lower interest rates. The move also apparently reflects a growing concern about the economy, which many economists say may show its sharpest slump since World War II in the second quarter of 1980. (A1:4.) A major corruption indictment that resulted from an undercover inquiry by the F.B.I. was issued by a Federal grand jury in Houston. The Speaker of the Texas House of Representatives, a labor union official and two lawyers were charged with fraud, conspiracy and racketeering. (A12:1.) Concern over two false nuclear alerts last week has led top United States officials to press efforts to find and correct the faults. The computer stystem of the North American Air Defense Command that is thought to be responsible has been disconnected, and a group of specialists has been sent to the site to study the system. (A16:1-2.) Doubts about an interest in nutrition among many Americans are expressed by scientists, who are questioning whether those who say they seek improved nutrition have altered their eating habits. Experts say that most Americans continue to consume to much fat and sugar. (A1:5-6.) A big urban renewal plan is opposed strongly by merchants in a court suit in Pittsburgh. The plan calls for replacing small stores with a $150 million office tower complex. In contrast, a pioneering renewal program transformed a slum into a stunning group of skyscrapers in the city's Golden Triangle 30 years ago after strong pressure was exerted by a powerful mayor and a leading philanthropist. (A12:2-5.) Metropolitan A transit fare rise of 10 cents in New York City and an average increase of 20 percent on commuter lines would result from a tentative accord reached by key legislators in Albany and Governor Carey. The accord would provide $235 million for mass transportation systems, with $200 million of it going to the Metropolitan Transportation Authority, through a new tax on oil companies. (A1:2-3.) A $13.6 billion budget was approved unanimously by the New York City Board of Estimate and was expected to win easy passage in the City Council. The budget contains $141 million in tax increases and provides for slightly higher new funding than Mayor Koch originally proposed for education, the police and posssible raises. (A1:1-2.) A PATH rail strike caused tie-ups and delays for hours during rush periods. Scores of additional buses and shuttle trains were pressed into service between New Jersey and Manhattan, but they were clearly not enough to carry the 80,000 daily commuters who normally use the railroad. No new negotiations were set on the first day of the walkout by carmen, and both sides said the strike might be long. (B1:5-6.) Business Digest, Page D1"

The $613.6-billion spending plan now moving through Congress for the fiscal year starting Oct. 1 is already a fantasy, the fourth version of a Federal budget that will be followed by a fifth, sixth and seventh before the actual outlays and receipts are determined. This is not a criticism, merely an observation. There would have been less confusion if President Carter had offered one budget instead of two during the first seven weeks of 1980 and if the Congressional budget committees had prevailed with their first compromise revision instead of the second. But the budget process is confusing by definition, for it must serve two distinct purposes. It is not only a framework for battling out spending priorities but also a fiscal weapon that the Government uses along with tax policy to stimulate or restrain private economic activity."

1980-06-13T00:00:00Z,"Those who prefer to see international politics as a morality play must be puzzled by the conflicting reports from the OPEC meeting in Algiers. Who won the latest power struggle inside the oil cartel - the ''good guys'' led by Saudi Arabia, allegedly arguing for price moderation, or the loose coalition of radical Arab ''bad guys'' who want to sock it to the West? The question may be unanswerable. Indeed, it may be irrelevant. For it is becoming increasingly clear that OPEC is not in the normal sense a cartel of sellers banding together to determine total output and price. The decisions of individual exporters may at times perceptibly influence the market. But in the end the price and availability of oil has far more to do with luck and the behavior of the importing nations. The primary responsibility for coping with oil scarcity rests inevitably with the consumers."

It will be the first Eagles concert in the metropolitan area in three years. The Eagles came together when Glenn Frey and Don Henley met in 1971 as members of Linda Ronstadt's backup band. The music on their first album, ''Eagles,'' in 1972 was classic Southern California country rock, with breezy harmonizing and a happily hedonistic projection of male heterosexuality. That combination of elements made the band an instant hit, but it was never content to rest easy with success. Instead, in conjunction with such other Los Angeles singersongwriters as Jackson Browne and John David Souther, the Eagles kept picking insistently at the assumptions behind the California life style."

My record in this area is clear and consistent.In my annual message to the Legislature in January, I pledged that the additional dollars generated by Federal welfare reform would be used to fund a much-needed increase in welfare grants. When it became clear that the current desire to balance the Federal budget meant an indefinite delay in Congressional action, I met with community leaders concerned with the adequacy of welfare benefits and reaffirmed my commitment to a 10 percent increase funded by the state.

As New York City Police Commissioner McGuire has repeatedly pointed out, shop owners and other citizens who attempt to defend themselves against criminals with handguns frequently injure or kill themselves or innocent bystanders in the process. That is why the Coalition of Merchants Against Crime, the Bronx Chamber of Commerce and 21 other merchant groups have unanimously endorsed stiffer handgun controls in New York. According to F.B.I. statistics, half of all murder weapons are handguns. A handgun can transform sharp words between drivers into a potentially deadly exchange (just ask Reggie Jackson). The easy accessibility and concealability of handguns make them the assassin's number one tool (just ask former President Ford). Because the 1968 Gun Control Act is so lenient in its restrictions on handgun purchases, no one in this country is safe from the homicidal rage of an irate friend, spouse or crazed acquaintance (just ask the family and friends of Allard Lowenstein)."

The tables are crowded, but there is no point in roaming the famous Left Bank boulevards or even the cobbled back streets in search of the intellectual table d'hote where Paris once philosophized for the world. Jean-Paul Sartre died in April, and no one is taking his place. There may no longer even be a place to take, for the long French tradition of congregating around a master thinker has fallen into disuse and, for some, disrepute."

He claimed he was lured into signing with a promise of a trophy, a shirt with his name emblazoned across it, and a dinner that would be held in his honor. White asked to be permitted to join another team, for which many of his friends played."

But, then, next spring my spade hits a two-pound chunk of quartzite just under the surface, heaved up from God-knows-where. The rock reassures me that it isn't quite the same soil I sift through every year; the ground is always in motion, sinking and rising and drifting sideways like the continents. I dig because I look for treasure. My immediate goal is to recover an onyx cuff link - a gift from a cousin in Mexico - that I lost five years ago. Then there is always a chance of finding something left behind by previous tenants and passersby, travelers and hunters."

It is as curious allies, therefore, and not for metaphorical debate, that we record Mrs. Thatcher's first economic triumph after a year of ever-worsening trouble. Her relief came not in economic policy as such, but in a diplomatic deal with her compliant Common Market partners to excuse Britain from two-thirds of its contributions to the customs union, a deal worth about $2 billion a year.

1980-06-14T00:00:00Z,"Titus Andronicus'' is Shakespeare's most savage pit - a caldron of rape, maiming, killings and cannibalism. It is tragedy without catharsis, Rome at the fall, ''a wilderness of tigers.'' In the pulsating Stratford Shakespeare Festival revival, directed by Brian Bedford, the point of the play is not the carnage but the relentlessness of the revenge and the remorselessness of the revengers. No one regrets a murderous act even as he condemns the homicide of others. Titus, like Lear, the Shakespearean character with whom he has most in common, is an unknowing instigator of his own and his nation's doom. Within minutes after Titus's triumphant return to the city - and after he declines the title of emperor - the entire monstrous plot is set in motion. Vengeance follows vengeance until the stage is blighted with corpses - a record 35 by the count of the Polish critic Jan Kott."

Passengers bound for JFK would pay the additional fare, which could be collected at Jay Street.Permitting short-run passengers to use the JFK trains would alleviate congestion on the regular trains. Initially, signs and conductor announcements could alert riders to the limited stops. SUSANNE BERARD New York, June 5, 1980"

1980-06-14T00:00:00Z,"In Connecticut this spring, the General Assembly's price for approving a 7 percent increase in welfare benefits was a tough ''workfare'' bill requiring cities to find jobs or useful training for ''employable'' recipients of state aid. Welfare officials are understandably worried that it will prove to be merely punitive for some poor people or cost them state subsidies. It is much easier to thrust rakes into people's hands than to steer them into lasting jobs. But the law's effect need not be hostile to welfare. So long as ''workfare'' is taken to be a serious employment program, it may help show how to turn a work requirement into a useful job assistance program."

1980-06-14T00:00:00Z,"THE burglary of a suburban Boston bank over the Memorial Day weekend, in which thieves escaped with $5 million in securities and other property, points up one of the common misconceptions about safedeposit boxes. People rent safe-deposit boxes thinking they are purchasing safety, but, sadly, their valuables are not automatically protected against loss if the boxes are burglarized or destroyed by fire or flood. The standard language on the safe-deposit agreement between banks and customers usually limits the bank's liability to the ''exercise of ordinary caring.''"

Every addict of superlatives is familiar with the Guinness Book of World Records that tells you things like the longest recorded distance for catching a thrown grape in the mouth (259 feet).

1980-06-14T00:00:00Z,"To the Editor: Much has been made of the attractive issue of being ''born again.'' Jimmy Carter has used this boon, however sincerely, for some time. More recently one finds reports from the Reagan camp that their candidate, although using the message in a more subdued fashion, is also a ''born again'' Christian, and why not? Anderson has, in effect, a different kind of symbolic version, a one-upmanship in becoming reborn in a new, independent candidacy and without his past strong conservatism.There are a lot of advantages beyond the religious support it may bring to be reborn. The attraction lies in the assumption that one is cleansed of past errors and now begins with a clean slate. One is given another chance of becoming perfect, shedding all the past mistakes, burdens and disappointments. Along the way, of course, one certainly disavows any connection with the Devil and other forms of corrupt association."

1980-06-14T00:00:00Z,"Just before the intermission - and well after the audience has abandoned all hope - there is a revivifying surprise in ''Chase a Rainbow,'' the new musical at the Theater Four. When the show's dutiful but dull cast slogs its way through an otherwise forgettable number about New York bag ladies, we suddenly realize that one person on stage is determined to have fun. Her name is Virginia Sandifur, and she is a tall woman with tousled brown curls, a modest grin and a voice tinged ever so slightly with whiskey. As she sails about the stage on very loose limbs -doing a precise turn here, selling a silly lyric there - Miss Sandifur doesn't look like any ragtag vagrant. She looks instead like the kind of open-hearted, self-assured musicalcomedy heroine that they don't write shows for anymore. The impression is confirmed in Act II, when Miss Sandifur, now playing a dreary suburban wife, gets to sing two ballads. The songs are nothing, but her delivery is so clear and honest that we tune them out and start to imagine her singing other numbers more to our liking. By the final curtain, I thought I had heard the actress do about half of the Sarah Brown songs from ''Guys and Dolls.'' For theatergoers who would like to see a good show on stage rather than conjure one up in their heads, not even Miss Sandifur will justify the time spent with ''Chase a Rainbow.'' This is a musical that seeks to celebrate mediocrity, and its style effortlessly echoes its content. The evening's hero, Richard, is a kind of poor man's Wallace Stevens. He's a ''weekend writer'' who can't decide whether to keep his cushy job at the Xerox Corporation or ''chase a rainbow'' and go after the Pulitzer Prize. By the end of the evening, he has sold an article to Field and Stream and decided, as Sammy Davis Jr. might put it, that he's gotta be me. Played by Ted Pugh with all the wan charm of a television game-show host, Richard is the dullest character to appear at the center of a musical since Liv Ullmann's Mama."

1980-06-14T00:00:00Z,"In a four-hour speech before the Egyptian People's Assembly on May 14, President Anwar el-Sadat outlined his new program for peace, democracy and prosperity. Egypt, he said, would devote 5 percent of its efforts to peace and 95 percent to prosperity. On May 23, Egyptians, in a referendum, endorsed a number of constitutional changes that would guarantee democracy. How genuine is Mr. Sadat's democracy? According to its Constitution, Egypt is a socialist democratic republic. It is a mixture of a parliamentary and a presidential system of government, with the scales tilting in favor of the latter. The People's Assembly is elected by popular secret ballot every five years. The Constitution confers on the president the power to appoint 10 additional members to the Assembly, a prerogative that gives Mr. Sadat certain political advantage. Moreover, one of the new constitutional changes provides for a consultative assembly of 210 members, one-third of whom will be appointed by the president. It is not yet clear what powers the new assembly will have, but it is not expected to replace the People's Assembly."

Federal funds for drug treatment programs have been cut lately, and the White House Strategy Council on Drug Abuse has not met for seven months. Plainly, the Administration needs to put its drug policy in order. The danger seems indisputable. Huge new supplies of heroin from Afghanistan, Iran and Pakistan are already recorded in Western Europe, where the number of addicts in several countries is rising sharply. From Euro, according to the Federal Drug Enforcement Administration, the stuff moves to the United States. More heroin on the streets would push prices down and potency up. Easier access will mean wider use. That's what happened in the late 1960's when 6 metric tons of heroin, most of it from Turkey, created a drug abuse crisis. This time, authorities say, more than 10 times the amount available in the late 60's may end up in the United States. Government is unprepared."

Several large rooms are often packed with diners, who seem willing to put up with slow service and generally pedestrian food served on plastic mats (which get rather gummy on occasion) at steep prices.

Robert Schwartz, a special assistant to State Senator Joseph Lieberman and a professor of gerontology, touched on a significant point - the value of using advisory councils to monitor nursing-home facilities. Indeed, in addition to the Jewish Home in New Haven that Mr. Schwartz mentions, all other nonprofit nursing homes in Connecticut have such advisory groups, which are their boards of directors. This voluntary presence, whose only concern is to insure the best possible care for the homes' residents, is one of the keys to the high quality for which nonprofit homes are known. The boards are legally responsible for the facility's operations."

1980-06-15T00:00:00Z,"Idreamed I went back to Kansas City and stood on 18th and Vine,'' sings Big Joe Turner near the beginning of Bruce Ricker's film about Kansas City jazz, ''The Last of the Blue Devils,'' which has its New York premiere Wednesday at the Art Theater, Eighth Street and University Place. ''I shook hands with Piney Brown, and I just couldn't keep from crying.'' Unless one is a jazz historian, one doesn't know at this point who Piney Brown was (he was a black bartender who lent money to many jazz musicians), but one doesn't have to know to feel the mixture of poignancy and pride Mr. Turner is expressing. The Kansas City the singer remembers was a thriving Depression era metropolis where an entrenched political machine allowed bars, gambling dens, and bordellos to operate around the clock, thus providing work for hundreds of jazz musicians. As the film soon makes clear, with shots of boarded-up storefronts, pawn shops, and vacant lots near today's 18th and Vine, that Kansas City no longer exists; thus the poignancy. But there's ample reason for Mr. Turner's pride. Together with musicians like Lester Young, Charlie Parker, Count Basie and Jay McShann, he helped create some of the finest and most innovative jazz and blues America has produced."

I did, however, have some clear-cut plans for my future - I knew that I wanted to major in biochemistry and that I was considering a career in medical science. Naturally I wanted to put these considerations to the test. I had heard a lot about the premed grind here, and it offered a rather bleak four-year outlook. I wanted more than that - a great deal more. I wanted to challenge myself, not merely by competing for those few spots in medical school, but by striving to do things I was not sure I could do. Many of my imagined adventures were intellectual, but I equally desired the physical challenges."
1980-06-15T00:00:00Z,"International The P.L.O. was dissatisified with the call Friday by the leaders of the European Common Market countries that it be ''associated'' with the Middle East peace talks. A Palestinian spokesman in Beirut said the declaration did not go far enough. ''The European communique has some positive points, but basic points are still missing,'' he said in a statement. ''They did not recognize officially and openly the P.L.O. and they also missed the recognitition of a Palestinian state.'' (Page 1, Column 3.) Millions of European visitors are expected this year in the United States -three million is the estimate - and most of them will have the advantage of currencies that will give them greater purchasing power over the dollar. The advantage over the comparatively weak dollar is possibly the major tourist attraction, but Europeans are also responding to American tourism campaigns undertaken by European tour operators and airlines and what seems to be an interest in American culture.

National Reversal of the largest penalty believed to have been awarded in an antitrust case will be sought by the American Telephone and Telegraph Company, which has been ordered to pay $1.8 billion to the MCI Communications Corporation. MCI, a Washington-based company that provides private telephone service to long-distance customers in 60 cities. (1:1-2.) President Carter's promise to provide more economic cushions, if needed, for people who have lost their jobs will be difficult to carry out, economists say. The specialists agree that a loss of a job no longer invariably means hardship because of the expansion of benefits in the last decade. They also believe that new benefit programs would be offered without any confidence that they would relieve the burden on people hardest hit by the recession because no mechanism has been set up to find out who needs additional assistance. (1:3-5.) Ronald Reagan won pledges of support from six of the men he beat in the Republican Presidential primaries as the first of a series of ''unity dinners'' was held in Los Angeles. The dinners will be held to help pay off the losers' campaign debts. (1:1.)

Longview, Wash., withdrew a $3.5 million bond issue that was to be offered May 28, 10 days after the mountain's first eruption because national investors would not participate. The blow to tourism has been severe. (18:1-3.) Metropolitan Aid for the M.T.A. was approved by the Legislature in Albany before adjourning until the fall. The bills will provide a new tax and other aid to subsidize the authority's deficit that officials tied to a 10-cent increase in New York City's subway and bus fares. (1:6.)

Mr. Carey had strongly backed legislation that would have raised the ceiling on interests rates and expanded the lending powers of savings banks. (1:4-5.) Speculation by public officials in casinos in Atlantic City is so pervasive, government officials say, that it hinders the independence of city efforts to regulate the gambling industry and to provide for the orderly growth of the casinos that are the basis of Atlantic City's economic redevelopment. More than 50 local officials and government employees have bought or sold property for use by casinos, have invested in casino stock or have formed other financial links with the gambling industry. The financial ties are not illegal so long as the officials do not participate in actions affecting companies in which they hold an interest. (1:5-6.)"

And just as regularly, the amendment has been defeated, mostly because of opponents' insistence that there is little real danger that a popular-vote loser will be an electoral-vote winner or that no one will win a majority of the electoral votes. Only three candidates have won the Presidency while losing the popular vote, they pointed out, and only once has the House had to choose a President from candidates none of whom had won a majority of the Electoral College.

1980-06-15T00:00:00Z,"GIGI'S in Pelham is one of those not-bad restaurants worth knowing because it makes some dishes very well. Rather dimly lighted, it is laid out in two small plain dining rooms with a separate barroom as though designed to have the intimacy of a pub - which in fact the premises once housed. It is a neighborhood place whose management greets many of the diners by name, and the regulars, familiar with the strengths and weaknesses of the kitchen, seem to order pretty much what they want and how they want it. We found some items on the regular menu (made up almost exclusively of Italian, and generally of southern Italian, dishes) that needed no alterations. They had the happy versatility of being able to function both as appetizers and, in larger portions, as entrees: the mussels (zuppa di mussels, the menu says), fat, fresh and luscious, heaped in a bowlful of sea-scented broth accented with basil; and the calamari, tender rings of squid bathed in a well-proportioned light marinara sauce."
1980-06-15T00:00:00Z,"THE Thorpe Intermedia Gallery at the Dominican Convent in Sparkill (Route 340), across the Hudson in Rockland County, is offering a large and provocative show. Called ''Religious Art: Contemporary Directions,'' it includes paintings and sculpture, stained glass, weavings and other artifacts, together with numerous photographs of recent architecture. The show was organized by the gallery's director, Sister Adele Myers, and David Weinrib, the sculptor, and, financed in part by the State Council on the Arts, it will be on view through June 29. This is not as lavish or as star-studded an event as the exhibition of liturgical art in Philadelphia five years ago, and in fact, includes relatively few liturgical objects. On the other hand, it is rather more sophisticated, including as it does work inspired by Judaism and Eastern faiths, as well as by Christianity. The idea was, in any case, to find out what simply reflected, to quote Sister Adele, ''a sincere interest in spiritual matters,'' and it has on the whole been realized."

Even before the amendments have cleared the Assembly in Cape Town, nonwhite groups crucial to the plan's success have repudiated it, leaving the Government heading up what threatens to be a constitutional blind alley. Prime Minister P.W.

You don't even have to have been there to know it: novels will make it quite clear, and so will published letters and diaries, and so did the English movie industry when Peter Sellers was the coming young man. If you have any last doubts on the subject, a good place to dispel them is the Museum of American Folk Art at 49 West 53d Street, where a selection of ''English Naive Paintings'' from the collection of Mr. and Mrs. Andras Kalman is on view through Aug. 17. This is a convert's collection. When Andras Kalman first came to England, it was as an amateur tennis player who was good enough to represent his native Hungary at Wimbledon. He liked England enough to stay on, and eventually he became an art dealer. Initially in the north of England - which is notably inhospitable terrain for activity of that sort - and later in London, he developed a line of his own among the artists of our own day. He also became interested in the untutored imagination as it manifested itself in English naive painting. In this he had a rival in the person of another foreignborn London dealer, Arthur Jeffress, but now that that gifted eccentric is dead Mr. Kalman has the field largely to himself. That is the origin of the collection which has been shown in Germany, Denmark, Sweden and Finland and is now on view in New York."

But father and son became estranged when William opposed the Revolution, and the Great Patriot carried the wound with him to the grave."

With the publication of the best-selling ''War Within and Without,'' the fifth and last volume of the series, the task is now complete."

When I moved to a condominium in the spring of last year they told me it was different here, but I never imagined it would be like this, the kind of place where tulips trespass. ''It's not that we don't like them,'' said my neighbor, a little sheepishly, explaining that the board of directors of the condominium association commended me for my efforts (futile) to make grass grow in front of my unit.

1980-06-15T00:00:00Z,"Charlotte Evans's story about Richard N. Lander, ''The Man Who Fills the Jury Boxes'' (May 26), was to my wife, Ruth, and to me a delightful coincidence. We had served the first of two weeks' jury assignment, and the characterization of the gracious, efficient man was letter-perfect. We had a first-hand opportunity to hear him and to see him at work. He does more than justice (sic!) to his job. Mr. Lander's philosophy about spreading the duty ''far and wide'' became apparent at once. Three-hundred-eleven prospective jurors assembled in the Central Jury Room at 9:30 A.M. on May 19. Following specific orientation, the ''lotto'' drum was turned and names selected. In groups of varying sizes, we were then conducted by sheriffs to one of many courtrooms, civil and criminal. The use of random selection of prospective jurors and assignments spoke well for the equity of the system."

1980-06-15T00:00:00Z,"OUR best efforts on the property tax often seem to turn against us, as homeowners in the state are discovering. Because of our success at ''reforming'' it, homeowners are threatened with a radical increase; in many cases, property taxes may double or even triple. Some homeowners in Hamden have already taken to the streets in protest - perhaps the first signs of an impending property-tax revolt. Homeowners have fallen victim to recent reforms in the administration of the property tax. Although most state laws have long required that property tax assessments be uniform, this requirement was, until recently, honored in the breach. Today, the message from the Connecticut Legislature, as well as from courts in several other states, is that inequalities in assessments will no longer be tolerated. All properties must be assessed at the same percentage of fair market value."

1980-06-15T00:00:00Z,"Having recently resisted political pressures to keep ''Death of a Princess,'' the controversial ''docu-drama'' about the execution of a Saudi Arabian princess, off the air, public television is now facing protests, primarily religious, about an hour-long documentary called ''Choosing Suicide.'' Scheduled to be carried nationally tomorrow at 8 P.M. on the Public Broadcasting Service, the program has already been rejected by a good many stations. As is customary when controversy ruffles its usually placid waters, the public-television system is offering a follow-up panel discussion. With Hugh Downs as moderator, ''Choosing Suicide: The Implications,'' will be broadcast live from a WNET/Channel 13 studio at 9 P.M. and will include among its guests Robert E. Neale, a professor in the program of psychiatry and religion at Union Theological Seminary and author of ''The Art of Dying,'' and Father Kevin O'Rourke, director of the Center for Health Care Ethics at the St. Louis University Medical Center. All well and good, but that still leaves the documentary itself. ''Choosing Suicide'' is certainly unusual. The program is also terribly unsettling, but in ways that probably were not anticipated by its participants or its critics. On the surface, the ''scenario'' is uncomplicated. Discovering in 1978 that she had cancer, 62-yearold Jo Roman decided to commit suicide. On June 10, 1979, a Sunday, she swallowed 35 Seconal capsules, each one containing 100 milligrams of the drug. Mrs. Roman was not an ''ordinary'' suicide. For years, she had been writing a book on ''rational suicide.'' She explains at the very beginning of the program: ''I don't think of myself now as 'killing myself.' I feel no desire to kill, or injure, or maim. To me, that's the difference between rational and irrational suicide. Irrational is neurotically involved with killing.''"

Illustrated. 982 pp. Berkeley, Calif.: University of California Press. $325. THE plan of the Abbey of St. Gall was drawn between the years 820 and 830, probably by the Benedictine Abbot Haito, bishop of Basel. It is an absolutely extraordinary document. The well-preserved parchment contains, in manuscript form, not only fragments of text in highmedieval Latin (which is not all that rare) but also a blueprint from which one could construct the entire monastery of St. Gall - the church, cloister and annexes, including the barns and stables. Haito's plan covers the most minute, intimate details. It foresaw, for example, that the young monks or novitiates who lived in the seminary and the infirmary would need at least one toilet - purified by running water - for every two persons. In fact, there were provisions for toilets everywhere - for the clergy and for guests. These hygienic accomplishments were strikingly modern. In fact, they really have not been improved upon by the Hilton hotels."

1980-06-15T00:00:00Z,"When it comes to sheer guts, no play this season can beat the new version of Bertolt Brecht's ''Mother Courage and Her Children'' at the Public. Director Wilford Leach has staged an elaborate and iconoclastic revival: The cast is black, and the script has been adapted from Brecht by the black American playwright Ntozake Shange. About the production, which ends its run today, there will be no quibbles here. Who wouldn't want to see Gloria Foster and Morgan Freeman play all the great roles in theatrical literature? This ''Mother Courage'' features some of the best actors, black or white, in New York; they give the play a passionate reading. But what play are they doing? The text of Miss Shange's ''Mother Courage'' amounts to a whole new show, and it raises some troubling questions. What are an adapter's responsibilities to the original work? What are a playwright's obligations to history? Is it right to call a play ''Mother Courage'' when it in many ways violates the spirit of the drama we associate with that title? The motivations behind Miss Shange's adaptation may well be pure, but the result is a case study of what can happen when an exercise in literary adaptation goes wildly astray."

''We set out in 1968 to contain organized crime activity and I think we have succeeded, or are close to succeeding, with that goal,'' said Edwin H.

The 13 cartel members agreed to an Iraqi formula: a new ceiling of $37 a barrel, which is about the price such ''hawks'' as Libya, Algeria and Nigeria are already charging for their oil, in return for an increase of the current benchmark floor price for Saudi light crude, from $28 to $32 a barrel."

''Video can mean much more than 'Charlie's Angels' and 'Starsky and Hutch' reruns,'' said Anna Marie Piersimoni, director of MonteVideo Inc. of Hartford. Just how much more will be illustrated this week when MonteVideo sponsors the second annual Daniel Wadsworth Memorial Video Festival, named for the art enthusiast who founded the Wadsworth Atheneum here. The festival, which is being held at several locations here, began Friday and runs through next Sunday."

Than came a series of individual albums that, while not groundbreaking in the sense of revealing material that was not already well known, established a pattern of firm foundations for a fundamental library of jazz recordings. This series included complete units of the work of major jazz artists -Duke Ellington in 1938 and 1939, Louis Armstrong with King Oliver in 1923 and with Earl Hines in 1928. There have been overviews of such influential musicians as Fletcher Henderson, from 1923 to 1937, Dizzie Gillespie from 1940 to 1946, and Teddy Wilson from 1934 to 1942.

The author of more than 20 books on early tools, barns, covered bridges and other aspects of Americana, Mr. Sloane is much admired for an art that appears to recapture a more natural, harmonious and selfsufficient way of life, filled with esthetically pleasing buildings and artifacts. The current exhibition of Mr. Sloane's paintings at the Verzyl Gallery concentrates on the late 1960's, when he was at work on his ''I Remember America'' series. Several of the works on view are studies from the series, supplemented by a selection of the cloudscapes for which he is also noted."

I was the only daughter and my tie to my mother was strong. I know I felt my father's presence but it was conveyed to me by my mother, largely in his absence. As father and daughter, we were alone together only once: We were in a restaurant during its off-hours waiting for my mother to finish shopping. I didn't know what to say to my father. After a few silent moments, he looked around the restaurant, empty except for the two of us, and said: ''Let's go. I don't like being the only ones here.''"
1980-06-15T00:00:00Z,"Hair - be it long, short, braided, curled, teased, powdered, oiled, bleached or dyed - has inspired painters, potters, sculptors, designers and craftsmen of every persuasion down through the ages. And in expressing themselves with symbolism, or with sexual images, or in high style designs, these observers have invariably also documented some fascinating aspects of the existing culture and the people who shaped it. Thankfully, some of these artists and artisans have also managed to accomplish this task with imagination and wit. That, in any case, is the provocative message of ''Hair,'' an exhibition that is a historical survey of styles, fashion and symbolism in hair design on view (through Aug. 17) at the Cooper-Hewitt Museum, the Smithsonian Institution's National Museum of Design, 2 East 91st Street. The show of 350 selections is believed to be the first exhibition in a major American museum devoted to the subject. The results are so absorbing that one suspects it will not be the last such presentation."

Indeed, ''the recycling problem is not one problem but many,'' and ''solutions must be tailored to meet the specific needs of specific countries.'' But while loans and financing are an important avenue for meeting the higher energy bills of oil-importing developing countries, it should not be the only one."

One of our wittiest novelists recalls the anguishes and the satisfactions of growing up Catholic in Bridgeport, Conn., of discovering sex and elitism at Smith, of living on faculty row, of finding pain and freedom in divorce. Reviewing this mosaic of impressions and vignettes, Diane Johnson found it ''all very interesting and enjoyable.'' SALLY HEMINGS, by Barbara Chase-Ribaud. (Avon, $2.75.) Using facts that were ingeniously assembled by Fawn Brodie in her psychobiography of Thomas Jefferson, this novel spells out the byzantine relationship between the third President and Sally Hemings, his beautiful, elegant, brainy, fiery and indestructible slave-companion. It is told through a series of impressions that - according to our reviewer Martin Levin - compose ''a vivid, appealing portrait because of the author's passion for her subject.''"

Others prefer to visit a company's store to reassure themselves about the merchandise. The first anniversary sale Saturday and Sunday of a $200,000 inventory at the Lillian Vernon Distribution Center may lure those armchair shoppers to Port Chester and divert those more familiar with the Mount Vernon retail store to the scene of a saving of one-third to two-thirds off catalogue prices on overstocks, discontinued merchandise, and manufacturers' errors, according to a company representative. The company has notified many of its customers to get there on Friday between 4:30 and 8 P.M. for a private preview sale. Lillian Vernon's store in Mount Vernon will be closed next Saturday during the clearance of gifts, cookware, housewares, desk needs, Christmas decorations and men's accessories. A 20-piece service for four of Ironstone dinnerware, originally $39.98 in the catalog, will be $18; black-handled cutlery by Supreme, a five-piece stainlesssteel flatware set once $24.98, will be $10. A lucite-and-stainless flatware five-piece setting, formerly $10.98, will be $5; assorted imported soaps are 25 cents a piece; imported stationery with 20 sheets and envelopes, $3; and Bert and Harry or Sesame Street hand towels will be $1.98."

This evening's ''Omnibus,'' on ABC from 8 to 9 P.M., will have Hal Holbrook as its host and will pair Metropolitan Opera tenor Luciano Pavarotti with country-and-Western star Loretta Lynn, singing together and separately (he will perform ''Torna a Sorrento,'' she will sing ''Pregnant Again''). Actress Meryl Streep will appear with members of the Theater of the Deaf in a hand-signing of ''America the Beautiful.'' There will be a sort of social history of Peter Pan, ranging from James Matthew Barrie's book to Sandy Duncan's flying on wires across the stage of the Lunt-Fontanne Theater in the current revival of the musical version."

The relocation eventually became an annual event, and tomorrow the ''Nuisance Canada Goose Roundup'' begins.

On a physically higher level was the school roof near London, England, where this columnist played during World War II on the assumption that moonlight would be present and German bombers absent.

Among the novelties were Fernando Bujones's debut as the spectre of the rose in question and a two-minute finale from ''Firebird,'' which was a thematically logical way to keep a program from being too long and yet ending it with an allusion to still another of Michel Fokine's major ballets.

For one thing, with the United States economy in serious trouble both at home and abroad, Mr. Carter is scarcely in a position to present himself as an exemplar of economic leadership. And his fumbling of foreign policy, on such major issues as Iran, Afghanistan, and relations with the Soviet Union have further undermined his ability to lead."
1980-06-15T00:00:00Z,"Property, law students are taught, is ''a bundle of sticks'' - each stick a right to do something, or prevent others from doing something, with the property in question. Citing that adage, Associate Justice William H. Rehnquist wrote the majority opinion in one of two cases last week in which the United States Supreme Court loosened the grip of property owners on two of their sticks - the right to exclude others and the right to be compensated for public action that threatens the value of their property. Both cases arose in California, where state courts have customarily been generous in their interpretation of public rights in private property. In the first case, PruneYard Shopping Center v. Robins, the Supreme Court upheld the state's right to require the owners of the shopping center to permit access by people who wish to distribute leaflets or otherwise peacefully exercise their First Amendment rights of free speech. ''It is true,'' wrote Justice Rehnquist, ''that one of the essential sticks in the bundle of property rights is the right to exclude others.'' But he went on to say that not every infringement on that right is a violation of the Constitution. The shopping center had not shown, he said, that the right to exclude others was so essential to business that the violation in question resulted in the ''taking'' of property without ''just compensation'' prohibited by the Fifth Amendment."

1980-06-15T00:00:00Z,"When President Carter flip-flopped last week and said he might debate John B. Anderson after all, it appeared to be a belated acknowledgment of a political reality - Mr. Carter and his advisers can't continue to shrug off Mr. Anderson's Presidential bid as ''fantasy.'' In fact, Mr. Anderson has attracted more than $2 million in contributions; his standing in the public opinion polls is inching upward. And, perhaps most important, he's meeting state deadlines and requirements for a line on the November ballot. Obviously, it's much too soon for Mr. Anderson to start measuring for drapes at 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue. Polls show that many voters still aren't quite sure who Mr. Anderson is. Others find the notion of voting for a independent candidate repugnant. In California, where he spent most of the week urging voters to ''put country ahead of party,'' he must collect more than 100,000 signatures by early August. Complying with complex state regulations won't be the end of it; many court fights are likely."

1980-06-15T00:00:00Z,"Maybe they'll call the next one Thug. This Father's Day, the fragrance industry is offering American men a wider range of choices than ever before. Twenty new men's fragrances, mostly colognes and after-shave lotions, have been introduced over the last year or so - an attempt to cash in on a market for men's scented toiletries that is expanding at a rate of 15 percent a year, outstripping the 10 percent growth in women's products. Men's products now account for $1.5 billion of the $4 billion a year in fragrance sales. ''There's been steady growth for the last decade,'' says Amelia Bassin, formerly in charge of product development for Faberge, where she introduced the male scent Brut. Now running her own consulting firm, Miss Bassin says: ''In a recession, people treat themselves to luxuries like fragrance. The industry could go through the roof if manufacturers stopped copying each other.''"

By MICHAEL MALONE THE business of America being business, movies have made a fortune creating films about the wickedness of making fortunes. Oddly enough, it is rarer that a novel wanders into an executive suite for longer than it takes to say ''No thanks.'' Racing there now with scalpels, old saws and blunderbuss, ''The Great Free Enterprise Gambit'' whacks open capitalist hearts and corporate souls right in their theater of operation. During this flurry of surgical slapstick, industrial waste flies like custard pies."

The Northeast is particularly rich in opportunities for bus touring and many choices are available in the New York area, particularly for people who can get themselves to starting points in Manhattan. Contrary to a popular impression, bus tours are not the preserve of solitary old people. Such tours do attract many widows and widowers, including some who are newly bereaved, because they provide an easy escape from depressing realities at home. But they also attract college students, young marrieds, couples seeking temporary relief from the cares of home and children and many foreign adults of all ages who want an easy way to see the United States."

1980-06-15T00:00:00Z,"One of the surest tonics for the securities markets is a severe sinking spell for interest rates. Last week, with a spectacular rate decline still in progress, the tonic worked its magic once again. Bond prices rallied and stock prices, as measured by the Dow Jones industrial average, hit new highs since February. The Dow finished at 876.37, sporting a gain of 14.85 points for the week. This advance partly reflected improving prices for such bellwether issues as General Motors, International Paper and the American Telephone and Telegraph Company."

IT'S time someone wrote a truly systematic and convincing book to explain the virtues of small-scale institutions. The recent popularity of ideas about decentralization, appropriate technology, steady-state economics, self-sufficient living and participatory democracy provides an opportunity for an imaginative person to weave together the various strands of theory, social experiment and practical accomplishment to show what such proposals mean as a whole. Kirkpatrick Sale's ''Human Scale'' tackles this worthy project, but with disappointing results."

On a recent Saturday afternoon, although the season was not yet officially over, the courts lay vacant as a light breeze lazily opened and shut the door to one of the deserted decks. The adjacent courts, used for conventional tennis, were alive with activity as players took advantage of the balmy weather to sharpen their games. The abrupt exodus from the platforms to the ground-level game is one of the problems that have plagued John Lenaerts of Melville in his efforts to promote public platform tennis on the Island."
1980-06-15T00:00:00Z,"Mount St. Helens, erupting into modern folklore, is also the heroine of an old Indian legend about the ''Bridge of the Gods.'' The tale exists in several forms. According to traditions of the Klickitat Indians eventually published in a folklore study, ''Indian Legends of the Pacific Northwest'' by Ella E. Clark, the Great Spirit who lived in the sun had two brave sons: Wyeast, ruler of the Multnomah people who lived south of the Columbia River in present-day Oregon, and Pahto, chief of the Klickitat, who lived to the north in Washington. When war broke out between the tribes after many years of peace, the Great Spirit stopped the sun from shining. The cold, hungry Indians pleaded for fire from the Great Spirit."

Robert, once the standard for parliamentary procedure throughout the English-speaking world, were replaced by Picker's Rules, the consuming passion of Chief Petty Officer G. Nat Picker. It was not so much that Robert's Rules were no longer valid as that people observing them began making perpetual motions long sought by physicists but unacceptable among parliamentarians. Also, some persons had difficulty understanding the rules, which was odd because they were couched in a clarity matched only by obscure sections of tax law. For instance:"

But undercurrents of opinion on what may be the key issue for Japan in this decade - the pace and extent of rearmament - may also be brought to the surface by the vote. Japan currently spends less than one percent of its trillion-dollar gross national product on the military, far below the average for Western industrial powers. Even if armed forces pensions and other items normally counted in North Atlantic Treaty Organization defense budgets are included, the total comes to less than 1.5 per cent of G.N.P., as compared to more than 5 percent for the United States."

The rest is well deserved. Last week he weathered a grueling tour of eight Midwestern cities - Chicago, Moline, East Moline and Rock Island in Illinois, Davenport and Des Moines in Iowa, Omaha in Nebraska, Kansas City in Missouri - talking with press and television interviewers, autographing copies of his books for admirers, accepting keys to the cities of Davenport, Des Moines, Omaha and Kansas City. In a few days he will be on the road once more, again traveling in a superluxury bus of the style favored by Dolly Parton and Loretta Lynn, as he visits Nashville and Knoxville in Tennessee, Little Rock in Arkansas, Tulsa and Oklahoma City in Oklahoma. In Knoxville he will be made an honorary citizen of the city, in Oklahoma City an honorary citizen of the state.

Hammond and the legislature have declared in the state's unique share-the-oil-wealth program. Mr. Hammond, a former bush pilot who sports a beard and who is something of a poet, is no socialist to be sure. He would rather be thought of as a Republican whose fiscal policies, while somewhat out of the ordinary, are fundamentally conservative. After winning his first term in 1974 (when he campaigned against ''malignant growth''), he quickly began pushing for creation of a special fund into which the state would place a significant part of the income it expected from the North Slope oil pumped from the ground at Prudhoe Bay. Voters approved the fund in 1978."

They're out to raise $30 million in so-called ''independent'' political contributions and they don't care if it shatters the law's restraints on private election money. The electorate can brace itself for the return of the big spenders whose money talks and whose gifts are not forgotten. We're in for a noisy campaign, just when it seemed that election reform laws might let us lower our voices. To give these highly organized individualists their due, they are probably within their constitutional rights. Congress tried to limit this kind of funding to $1,000 per person as part of a comprehensive Campaign Reform Act in 1974. It appropriated public funds for campaigning by the major party candidates provided they forgo private fund-raising and limit their spending to the ceilings set by Congress. The intention was to enforce the limit by charging candidates for every penny spent by anyone to advance their cause, except for $1,000 that individual citizens might choose to invest in electioneering by their own lights."

''The Book of Ephraim'' was composed of 26 separate but consecutive poems, corresponding to the board's alphabet from A to Z. ''Mirabell: Books of Number'' was divided into ten sections, corresponding to the board's numbers from zero to nine.

1980-06-15T00:00:00Z,"As political machines go, the Citizens Charter Association was nearly unbeatable. In eight elections, beginning in 1959, its candidates for the Dallas City Council won 82 percent of the time. Yet in that same period the city was free of the kind of major scandals that plagued other machine-run towns. The reason was to be found in the nature of the Dallas machine. The Charter Association was not an organization of ward politicians and pork-barrel policies. Rather it was an alliance of powerful business interests that came together at election time to endorse and run its own slate of candidates for municipal office. During the association's years of power, Dallas was a city ruled by the business establishment."

One such excursion into northern Bergen County leads over country roads with eye-catching vistas of wood, field and stream, glimpses of beautifully landscaped homes in rural settings and a variety of antiques shops. Among them is Old Maple Homestead Antiques in Ridgewood, where the old, the good and the less desirable are jumbled together in several rooms in a barn behind an old sandstone house."

But it did not happen last week when it very easily could have, largely because Republicans have been paying unaccustomed attentioned to unity lately, and not just in the last few weeks. Indeed, when Ronald Reagan and Bill Brock sat down Friday and worked out the terms under which Mr. Brock will stay on as Republican national chairman through the election, they were reaching an agreement that was possible only because of the success of the efforts both of them have made since 1976."

Of course, such a practice has been an artistic device used by the Chinese for many centuries. Chinese writing, or calligraphy, as it is known, is considered one of the highest forms of art in China, and the best of Chinese artists have used it as a means of expression."

1980-06-15T00:00:00Z,"The recession: It's a ''slide.'' It's an ''adjustment.'' It's a ''short,'' ''steep,'' ''sharp,'' ''wide,'' ''speedy,'' ''severe,'' ''intense,'' ''deep,'' ''worse-than-expected,'' ''cyclical,'' ''unsustainable,'' ''precarious,'' ''plummeting'' slowdown. The words have the ring of newspapers and political oratory, but lately they are also the observations of people who are less prone to hyperbolic excess - the nation's bankers and their economists. In the hundreds of newsletters and economic reports that they and the Wall Street brokerage firms publish for their clients, most of their latest comments are grim."
1980-06-15T00:00:00Z,"Under a green and white canopy on the patio of a Washington home the other evening, a few dozen Congressmen supporting the President's renomination cheered and clapped as he exhorted them on to victory. Then he asked for everybody's votes for his 10-cent-a-gallon oil import fee. The silence was so resounding the English boxwood could be heard growing. ''Sometimes you get applause, sometimes you don't,'' Mr. Carter said wistfully. With that sort of stiff upper lip, the White House has been seeking to put the best face on the worst rupture in a long time with its nominal Democratic allies. The dispute with Congress came to a head early this month, as the leadership fumed over the President's opposition to their initial budget compromise. A week later, the legislators rushed headlong to override the President's veto of their repeal of the oil fee. Last week, the disagreement on the budget was patched up with a compromise that the White House claimed was a victory. But the fundamental issues - how to conserve energy, how to order Federal spending priorities - have been joined. The battle over them, in fact, is almost guaranteed to get more contentious as the year goes on."

With 521 home runs in 22 summers, he ranks as the leading power hitter in the big leagues, tied with Ted Williams as the eighthranking home-run hitter in history. But like most senior citizens in the game, he resists the thought of letting go. And he is vexing his bosses on the San Francisco Giants by clamoring for more action. ''Willie thinks he can play forever,'' Manager Dave Bristol of the Giants said at Shea Stadium before the Giants played the Mets last night. ''It's an admirable quality, and he has won a few games for us this season with hits. But now he's ticked off at me for not playing him every day.''"

The world situation, the political campaign, the economy and even golf and tennis are forgotten. Instead, their conversations concern the size of lettuce heads, whether tomatoes have been staked and whether squirrels steal strawberries. More than ever, suburban men are expounding on the joys of tilling a vegetable garden. Car-poolers have been seen climbing into automobiles carrying flats of seedlings to share with a fellow rider or co-worker. Executives who once boarded the train clutching a bunch of just-plucked flowers intended for a city employee now carry shopping bags filled with lettuce. Wives complain about watery cocktails and cold dinners because husbands rush home, change their clothes and hurry to the garden to pick weeds."

Only instead of a sex goddess in a clinging gown rising breathlessly to accept a Chinese ''Oscar,'' the speechmaker is an earnest young soldier in the baggy green attire of the army. He has been selected as a representative of the military, ''to show the unity between the army and the movie industry,'' the program notes say, and he begins his talk with a crisp salute. ''We soldiers serving on the steppes of Inner Mongolia can go without vegetables for a month or two,'' the soldier intones solemnly. ''But we can't go without seeing a movie. Please produce more films.''"
1980-06-15T00:00:00Z,"The 1950's occupy a special place in the development of contemporary photography. When the decade began, still and motion picture photography provided most of the pictures most people saw. By the end of decade, both had been replaced by television as the dominant pictorial medium, and photography had begun the move into museums and galleries that is such a conspicuous feature of its recent history. To provide an overview of this crucial decade is the aim of the exhibition ''Photography of the Fifties: An American Perspective'' at the International Center of Photography, 1130 Fifth Avenue and 94th Street, through July 13. The exhibition is not about the 50's so much as about photography in the 50's, and it is more of a potpourri than a historical survey. There is no network of wall labels to guide the viewer through the decade's intricacies, and the novice may be pardoned some confusion when he looks up from William Garnett's semi-abstract aerial shots of sand dunes and eroded hills to see, in one direction, the elegant Vogue cover ladies of Irving Penn, and in the other, Richard Avedon's de-glamorized celebrities. Some of the photographers represented, though still active in the 50's, had already done their best and most characteristic work in previous decades -Imogen Cunningham and Ansel Adams, for example - and others, such as Philippe Halsman, are represented by uncharacteristic works."

This is a charming notion - a brave little bank of explorers sets off two by two for the mysterious and uncharted coasts of intimacy, while friends and relations cheer and toss in the air their copies of Psychology Today - but it's also a little sad. Are there really no new worlds to conquer except the ones in the bedroom and the kitchen? Must one's energies be focused relentlessly inward, as though society at large had no use for them?"

Dick Clark, the television host and producer, took over management of the Westchester Premier Theater - whose operation was marred by bankruptcy and criminal indictment - changed its name to the Dick Clark Westchester Theater and vowed to turn it into a financial success by bringing in show-business headliners who would appeal to the county's diversified population."

Forgotten reviews, vaguely remembered interviews and articles are brought together in a seemingly permanent form for a new public.

1980-06-15T00:00:00Z,"The small Fishermen's Museum on the waterfront in Gloucester, Mass., on Cape Ann, is a homemade museum in every respect. In fact, it has somewhat the aspect of a ''show'' small-town children might put on in a cellar - some old bones, some treasures dug up in the back yard, objects fished from the sea, a sheet for showing home movies. This museum, which is only three years old, is up the road less than 20 miles from the patrician, formal wealth of the East India Marine Hall of the Peabody Museum in Salem, Mass. The contrast with the glass-cased symmetry of East India Hall makes the gritty, salty reality of the Fishermen's Museum particularly welcome. It also gives adults a vivid memory of why children soon grow desperate in traditional do-not-touch museums: In the Fishermen's Museum, if it looks interesting to touch, it can be touched, handled or tried on. Bells are there to be sounded, whalebones to be stroked or grasped. The open seams of a wooden boat are yawning for cotton batting nearby, and the caulking tool is there if anyone wants to hammer it in. An oak plank is there to be drilled for a trunnel - a wooden peg, properly a treenail, that in the days of wooden boats was what kept the vessels tight. A foghorn can be pushed with noisy results; a line can be coiled."

This forward-looking management selection technique meant there was less uncertainty amoung shareholders and customers when Peter von Siemens, the 68-year-old chairman of the company's supervisory board, announced earlier this year that he would step down in the beginning of 1981 leaving the company without a Siemens family member at the top for the first time in its 133-year history."

1980-06-15T00:00:00Z,"Anne Mausolff calls the Vermont hike she leads an inn-to-inn ramble, but my wife and I, after embarking on the four-day venture, called it a hike for dilettantes. The idea seemed simple enough. Spend the night in a Vermont inn and set out next morning, after a country breakfast, on a hike that would end that afternoon at another inn. In a nutshell, it was outdoorsmanship without the lumps, hill and dale with showers, the call of the mild instead of the wild."
1980-06-15T00:00:00Z,"BUNCHES of fresh herbs are one of the joys of summer. Dry, graygreen flakes from a jar in the pantry serve their purpose at certain times of the year, but in many dishes there is no substitute for satin leaves of basil or sprigs of fragrant thyme plucked right from the garden. According to nurserymen on the Island, the interest in cultivating fresh herbs has steadily increased over the last three to four years. ''Our herb sales must be up 15 to 20 precent over last year,'' said Russ Ireland, owner of the Martin Viette Nurseries in East Norwich, where more than 80 varieties of herbs are cultivated. ''We have always specialized in herbs, but we see them becoming more and more popular.''"

The pair of tailored brown, beige and white dining rooms on the main floor of an unprepossessing white house just off Route 110 are furnished with attractively set tables and contemporary cane chairs. Flowers and a few framed prints soften the look. Another small room with a bar is up a narrow flight of stairs. Although the cuisine and its presentation are rather formal, and the restaurant has a smart look, the crowd tends to be somewhat casual. Jackets are not the unanimous style for men."

Or rather, Version No. 4 did (the first two were presented by the White House; the third, the product of the Congressional budget process, was voted down last month.) Impelled by the leadership's holding hostage sensitive 1980 spending measures, and with at least one eye on the voters back home, senators and representatives praised themselves for their discipline, and passed a $613.6 billion compromise budget for 1980 only slightly different from the version condemned by President Carter as too generous for defense and too harsh on social programs. (White House and Congress still at odds, page 4.) No one expects Versions No. 5 and 6 (under the Congressional budget process, two more votes are due before Sept. 30) to reflect the same discipline."

These financial ties are not illegal so long as the officials do not participate in actions affecting companies in which they hold an interest.

The Board of Estimate and the City Council approved a $13.6 billion budget for 1981, almost identical to the Mayor's proposal. The Mayor declared the new spending plan the city's ''first truly balanced budget in more than a decade,'' and it came, as he had hoped, a year ahead of schedule. Mr. Koch also said the budget was ''veto-proof,'' apparently because he anticipates no insurmountable problems with the contingencies that threaten the balance."

The odds favoring such a split increased last week when Jean-Marie Balestre, president of the Federation Internationale du Sport Auto, rejected a compromise agreement worked out by representatives of his organization and Bernie Ecclestone, head of the Formula One Constructors' Association. Under terms of the agreement, the constructors would have acknowledged the international governing authority of the federation in matters concerning Grand Prix racing. In return, the role of the constructors within that organization would have been formally acknowledged."

Professional heavy-gauge cookware, stainless-steel utensils and institutional china and glassware are practical and made to last. Although the character of the American kitchen ranges from comfortable country charm to the sleek styling of a European prototype, the modern American cook has always sought efficiency in food preparation and cleanup.

He carried a portfolio of his work - a collection of oil paintings and montages. He said he had taught art at a college in the Middle West before moving to Saratoga, N.Y., last year. On this particular day, he was knocking on the doors of galleries in SoHo, looking for one that would allow him to exhibit his work.

After granting applications for the change from American Airlines and Braniff Airways, it issued an order permitting all airlines to offer the free-transportation option. A C.A.B. spokesman said he expected most other airlines to adopt free-flight compensation. Under the new policy, airlines have the choice of offfering travelers bumped from overbooked flights a voucher for a free flight or a check for cash in addition to honoring the ticket the passenger bought but was unable to use. The C.A.B. stipulates that the passenger must have the option of a free flight or cash and that the the value of the free flight must be at least equal to the monetary compensation, which is based on the mileage of the overbooked flight."
1980-06-15T00:00:00Z,"By an odd coincidence, the recorded vocal recitals released over the past couple of months present an interesting dichotomy. On the one hand, there are half a dozen disks featuring some of the most glamorous voices of the day, singers whose principal attraction lies in the sheer beauty of the sound they make rather than in interpretive acuity, stylistic perception or musical intellect. On the other hand, there are also a number of recitals from singers less generously endowed by nature, yet who compensate by cultivating a specialized repertory with unusual refinement and sophistication. It hardly comes as a surprise that the first group is far and away more internationally acclaimed than the second. The world of opera in particular has always prized the pure sound of a voice above everything else, and while singers blessed with a throat of gold are not necessarily bereft of musical intelligence, they are principally admired for the innate quality of their voices. Only rarely does a Maria Callas appear, a singer with a flawed instrument who can still command world-wide attention through the indomitable force of a unique musical and dramatic personality. By the same token, a singer who combines vocal perfection with a riveting interpretive gift is an even rarer phenomenon."

1980-06-15T00:00:00Z,"With another recession under way, there is now an opportunity to invest in real estate and profit from the last downturn. This can be accomplished by buying so-called used units in real estate limited partnerships that were formed in the 1970's. Such partnerships pool investors' money and use it to form a limited partnership with a general partner, which is usually an experienced real estate firm. The general partner then buys properties, usually apartments, which provide tax-sheltered income to the limited partners of about 6 to 8 percent a year. The income, however, is almost immaterial compared with the capital gains investors can realize when the properties are sold, usually seven to 10 years after the partnership is formed."

In story after story Chinese-American people are claiming America, which goes all the way from one character saying that a Chinese explorer found this place before Leif Ericsson did to another one buying a house here. Buying that house is a way of saying that America - and not China - is his country.'' Long snakes of galley proofs line the walls of the living room and small dining room of the Honolulu home she and her husband Earll, an actor, bought in 1978. ''We never really made a decision to stay here,'' she notes, though they have lived on the island of Oahu with their son Joseph for the last 12 years. But the deal on the new house was clinched when they discovered an office upstairs, ''the very writer's garret of your imagination.'' Their New England-style house looks good-naturedly incongruous in its setting. Five kinds of ginger bloom in the yard, which ends at a precipitous mountain slope lush with vegetation. Directly inside the front door is a place for leaving snowboots."

Indeed, the Supreme Court so held in 1972, finding capital punishment, as administered then, both cruel and unusual. That won't be quite so true if Jack Potts, after twice changing his mind about whether to appeal a death sentence, is electrocuted at Reidsville State Prison in Georgia. Of the four Americans put to death since executions were resumed three years ago, he would be the third who simply gave up the fight for life. Like Gary Gilmore in Utah and Jesse Bishop in Nevada, he would have succeeded in preventing others from battling to save him, although strong legal points could be made on his behalf."

For me, the letters began coming from the State University at Albany. As a freshly minted graduate, I found it amusing to suddenly be elevated into the position of ''one of our honored alumni.''

The book is 18 inches high and 12 1/2 inches wide, printed on yellow paper. Except for the authentic illustrations that are worked into the text, the novel is in typescript form.'' Who was the author and what is his book about? Mrs. Wolff explained: Arno Schmidt (1914-1979) lived in a little village in Hanover and wrote 20 books. He had an abiding interest in American and English literature. He translated Edgar Allan Poe and William Faulkner into German. His books were published by S. Fischer in West Germany, where ''Evening Edged in Gold'' (''Abend Mit Goldrand'') appeared in 1975. But none of his works had ever been published in the United States."

Just a petulant cry that Europe wants to play big-league power, too, and a cramped call for a ''comprehensive'' solution, their code language for a denunciation of Camp David. The Europeans did not even have the decency to mention, let alone analyze, that one solid achievement in the region so far. As a declaration of strategic purpose, their doctrine was absurd. The essence of the conflict, the agonizing tension between Israeli security and Palestinian rights, was simply asserted to be reconcilable. The anti-Israeli majority of the United Nations was put forward as a reliable guarantor of the peace. And the Palestine Liberation Organization, which only last week recommitted itself to the destruction of all Israel (''complete liberation of Palestine, the liquidation of the Zionist entity''), was promised a central seat at the negotiations and an early interview by Europeans as they design their ''initiative.''"

The group contained the about-to-be-ex-wife and the about-tobe-second-wife of the same man, and my friend said the drama got to be too much. Sometimes, it's better to keep your consciousness low. But the 70's did teach us to seek our essences, souls, karmas. We learned not only to understand ourselves, but also to reveal them proudly, without shame. In the interest of a brave honesty, I have decided to describe the real me that emerged from my soul-searching. While going through a stack of junk mail the other day, I had a sudden insight.

1980-06-15T00:00:00Z,"Carter Administration officials, when pressing Congress for passage of $5.7 million in emergency military assistance for El Salvador on March 25, insisted that the request was for ''nonlethal'' equipment that ''will help strengthen the Army's key role in reforms.'' The package was approved a week later. According to Congressional testimony on March 25 by Franklin D. Kramer, Assistant Secretary of Defense for International Security Affairs, the aid would consist of $3.7 million for trucks and transport vehicles, $316,000 for riot-control gear, $1.2 million for communications equipment, and $400,000 for ''various other equipment to include trailers.'' The rest of the outlay was for transporting the materiel. What Mr. Kramer neglected to disclose in his public testimony was that the aid package in fact included combat-related equipment that stretches the definition of ''nonlethal'' beyond credibility. The Defense Security Assistance Agency had provided Congress with a list of the items in the military-aid proposal that was more detailed than the one made public by Mr. Kramer. The members of Congress who saw the list - it was given to the House and Senate Appropriations Committees, the House Foreign Affairs Committee and the Senate Foreign Relations Committee - accepted the ''nonlethal'' designation despite the nature of the equipment. When this gear reaches the field, however, any distinction between lethal and nonlethal will have been lost. As repression by Salvadoran security forces escalates daily in the countryside, this gear becomes vital to the junta's waging of counterinsurgency war. Under the Freedom of Information Act, the American Friends Service Committee has obtained copies of the ''Letters of Offer and Acceptance'' from the Department of the Army that detail the military aid approved by Congress. To be delivered (some equipment is en route, the Army says) are 7,500 CS tear-gas grenades, 250 ''Manpack'' field combat radios, thousands of batteries, and an unspecified number of tear-gas-grenade launchers. The sale of 50 portable PVS-2B night-vision devices blurs the supposed distinction between lethal and nonlethal weapons: These electro-optic devices are used for observation and nighttime weapons targeting. Night-vision-weapons technology and related equipment like the 12 ''Image Intensifiers,'' also included, were perfected for use in Vietnam. To help security forces preserve so-called law and order, the Administration is sending three communications-monitoring sets at more than $38,000 each. An Army aide says that security forces will use them to monitor the airwaves and track the exact locations of clandestine-radio transmitters: ''It's perfect for use against guerrillas and insurgents.''"

As the 1980 session drew toward a close, a weary and fractious Democratic-led Assembly voted the package, which will use a new tax on oil companies to help subsidize the Metropolitan Transportation Authority's deficit."
1980-06-15T00:00:00Z,"The essence of liberalism,'' mused Leon Shull, executive director of Americans for Democratic Action, ''is the use of government to intervene on behalf of people.'' ''I don't think government is where it's at,'' said Senator Paul E. Tsongas, Democrat of Massachusetts, who gave the keynote speech at the organization's annual convention today. ''The Johnson-Humphrey Great Society approach is that government does work, but I think government has a deadening impact.''"

1980-06-15T00:00:00Z,"To the Business Editor: The article, ''Who Pays? Cleaning Up the Love Canals'' (June 8), indicates a significant deficiency in industrial planning. This is the failure to plan for the long-term consequences of intense and broad industrial development and production. Waste in the production process and waste of outmoded products have become a potential social and economic cost of a magnitude that will require a whole industry itself to accommodate. Wise industrial planning would seem to include planning for waste as an integral part. It has been traditional to leave waste disposal to public authorities, or worse, to literally bury the waste and hope that a future public will bear the burden of disposal. This hidden cost of innovation and development is now becoming open. And the public cost will surely be returned to industry in the form of higher taxes or, more directly, through fines and assessments."
1980-06-15T00:00:00Z,"Two years ago, Guatemala had just held presidential elections which were won by a general who promised social reform and even a return to civilian rule. By last year, the country's two main opposition leaders had fallen victim to right-wing assassination squads and hopes for peaceful reform were fast fading. Today, a deeply divided Guatemala is caught up in a bloody underground civil war which could be the prologue to a leftist revolution. The speed of the political disintegration in Guatemala, the most populous of the Central American republics, has taken many outsiders, not least the United States, by surprise. While a battle to the end between left and right is perhaps not imminent, suddenly it seems unavoidable: no one is looking for a negotiated solution and everyone is preparing for war."
1980-06-15T00:00:00Z,"Among golf professionals, pressure is the same in any language. Isao Aoki, a 37-year-old Japanese who has won 32 tournaments abroad, felt none of it today as he birdied the last two holes in the third round of the United States Open to gain a tie with Jack Nicklaus. Aoki, recognized as one of the world's best players within 100 yards of the hole, helped make tomorrow's finale exactly the kind a United States Open should be - six players in contention, all within two strokes of one another."

The man, whom the police did not identify, had been shot in the right side. He was taken to St. Vincent's Hospital where he was pronounced dead on arrival at 2:20 A.M."
1980-06-15T00:00:00Z,"The question of whether any outstanding ballet of its time does in fact outlive its time is one that continually springs to mind in regard to two special works, both of which are on view this season. One is the 1938 ''Billy the Kid,'' choreographed by Eugene Loring to Aaron Copland's score and the other is the 1948 ''Orpheus,'' by George Balanchine and Igor Stravinsky. Both have been dubbed classics of the American ballet repertory although by common consent, ''Orpheus'' is considered the masterpiece that ''Billy the Kid'' generally is not. And yet ''Billy the Kid'' has been able to endure the weak performances that ''Orpheus'' cannot. At its least successful, ''Orpheus'' has appeared sadly dated while ''Billy the Kid'' has appeared happily dated. That is, in poor production and performance ''Orpheus'' may not work at all, trapped in a symbolism and style of movement its dancers can no longer convey. ''Billy the Kid,'' whatever its lowest ebb, appears dated in the sense of a period piece - it proclaims its own period of creation, an era of Americana ballets in tune with the nationalist emphasis of its own time in American art. It is the kind of ballet that can still irritate an impatient audience no longer keyed to its deliberately naive style. But this very style is so watertight that the work can be recognized for what it is, a product of the 1930's. One can like it or dislike it but one can recognize it."
1980-06-15T00:00:00Z,"Just when people were beginning to wonder if the revolution was turning soft, the New York Mets struck one of their most dramatic blows last night: a five-run ninth inning peaked by a three-run home run by Steve Henderson that buried the San Francisco Giants, 7-6. Not only that, but there were two strikes on Henderson and two outs against the Mets. And, for a team that has been creating havoc lately against power clubs like the Pittsburgh Pirates and the Los Angeles Dodgers, there were even more flourishes: the Mets trailed by 6-0 after four and a half innings, they were held hitless by John Montefusco until the sixth, they were one strike away from losing in the ninth and Henderson had not hit a home run all season."
1980-06-15T00:00:00Z,"Dale Lundquist carded a six-underpar 66 today to take a four-stroke lead after three rounds of a $150,000 Ladies' Professional Golf Association tournament. The 26-year-old Miss Lundquist, a nonwinner in four years on the tour, had an eagle and five birdies to offset one bogey. She totaled 204, 12 under par over the 6,029-yard Frencroft Country Club course."
1980-06-15T00:00:00Z,"THE current supply of gasoline on the Island is ''excellent,'' according to industry officials, but the relatively stable price picture of recent months is now in doubt because of last week's price increases by the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries. Gasoline prices on the Island in recent weeks have varied between $1.19 and $1.37 a gallon for leaded regular, a difference that has brought competition back to the industry. Service stations are again open longer hours, some on a 24-hour basis and others on Sundays, and there is better service at the pump, with attendants looking under hoods, checking the oil and cleaning windshields."
1980-06-15T00:00:00Z,"HARTFORD AFTER 12 years as producing director of the Hartford Stage Company, Paul Weidner leaves next month for the Ivory Coast to serve for two years as an English teacher with the Peace Corps. For his final production, he has chosen to direct a play by Edward Albee, the most frequently produced playwright at the theater. The play is ''The Lady From Dubuque,'' which opened on Broadway last January and closed after 12 performances. One can only guess at its failure. In part it may be that standards are changed for successful playwrights. Each time out, more, different and better is demanded of them. And certainly the topic is an important consideration. New Yorkers have too many theatrical choices each season to pay to attend a play on a subject that most people would rather not face."

1980-06-15T00:00:00Z,"ONE of the most frequent problems that develop with a typical toilet tank mechanism, particularly in an older unit, is water dripping or running continuously from the tank into the toilet bowl after the toilet is flushed. Sometimes the flow can be stopped by vigorous jiggling of the handle or by flushing again, but this doesn't always work. Sometimes the leak is so rapid and steady that the water runs out almost as fast as it runs in and the tank never does fill properly until you jiggle the handle repeatedly. In other cases the leak is so slow that it does not interfere with the tank's filling and flushing properly. It's just that the water keeps on running indefinitely after the tank and bowl have filled."

1980-06-15T00:00:00Z,"BY now the roses in your garden should be filled with buds, or already in flower. If, however, a damaged bush remains, there is no need to wait another season to replace it. Potted roses make possible replacements anytime during the season or, for that matter, planting an instant rose garden in midsummer. When planting at this time of year, it is especially important to retain the soil in the roots; a plant in full foliage is unlikely to survive if its soil is lost. The soil should be well prepared, with peat, compost or well-rotted manure added in the amount of one fourth the total volume. It is essential that newly planted roses be watered well."

Castillo, had announced almost two months earlier that he intended to leave office by the end of September."
1980-06-15T00:00:00Z,"Big-band fans have been talking wistfully about a hoped-for return of the big bands ever since they began fading away 30 years ago. But as such established big-band leaders as Duke Ellington, Guy Lombardo and Stan Kenton have died, a revival of the era has seemed more and more unlikely. And yet, now that almost all of the celebrated bands of the bigband days are gone - the bands of Count Basie and Woody Herman are almost the only ones continuing to perform regularly -there is a growing interest in the big-band sound, an interest that has impelled the Bottom Line, that bellwether of popular taste, to put on a fiveday festival of big bands, starting Tuesday."

It was only in March that the Administration disclosed its budget-balancing goal for the fiscal year that starts Oct. 1. Now, with a weakened economy, heavy unemployment and the defeat of the oil import fee, a substantial deficit may be looming, White House officials concede. The Administration is said to be considering tax cut proposals and additional spending later this year if the economy gets worse."
1980-06-15T00:00:00Z,President Carter traveled across the country this week emphasizing that cushions already in the economic system would help Americans who had lost their jobs avoid extreme financial hardship. He promised he would offer new measures if the cushions proved to be inadequate. Economists in and out of the Government agree that loss of a job no longer invariably means hardship because of the expansion of benefits in the last decade. But they say that it will be difficult for the Carter Administration to design new programs with any confidence that they will relieve the burden on Americans who are hardest hit by the recession.

1980-06-15T00:00:00Z,"The Force is with us but let's try to keep our heads. These things are certifiable: ''The Empire Strikes Back,'' George Lucas's sequel to his ''Star Wars,'' the biggest grossing motion picture of all time, has opened. On the basis of the early receipts, ''The Empire Strikes Back'' could make more money than any other movie in history, except, maybe, ''Star Wars.'' It is the second film in a projected series that may last longer than the civilization that produced it. Confession: When I went to see ''The Empire Strikes Back'' I found myself glancing at my watch almost as often as I did when I was sitting through a truly terrible movie called ''The Island.''"
1980-06-15T00:00:00Z,"In the corridors of Congress, Senator Jacob K. Javits is treated with the deference due an elder statesman who has served 30 years - 24 in the Senate and eight in the House. But 10 days ago in the Bronx, the Senator was just another candidate, listening to a Republican opponent castigate him as a liberal out of tune with the times and pleading himself for the support of 150 Republican county committeemen who had already been told by their leaders to reject him. For the first time in his political career, Senator Javits faces a challenge from within that will provide a clear test of how far the once liberal New York Republican Party has drifted to the right. There is no track record of Republican statewide primaries by which to forecast the likely outcome. The conventional wisdom is that Mr. Javits is well ahead of his G.O.P. challenger, the relatively unknown Alfonse M. D'Amato, as well as his four Democratic opponents. But he is running as if he were behind, making unaccustomed appearances before Republican audiences on long weekends away from Washington."

As of a few days ago (the season opened May 1) Maine anglers had caught more than 500 salmon in the Penobscot. Last year in the same period, the catch was about three dozen. At the same time, nearly 130 salmon have returned to the Connecticut, with more than 100 picked up in the fish lifts operated by Northeast Utilities Water Power Company in Holyoke, Mass. During all of last season the entire Connecticut system had only about 60 returning salmon."

1980-06-15T00:00:00Z,"IT has been a bad year for the ''Sons of the Bad News Bears,'' as one mother dubbed the Cubs, and today the score resembles football more than baseball. With carefully blank faces, they have been pounded on the backsides and cheered by the winning team. Now they slump, streaked with sweat and mud (and, I suspect, tears in a case or two), listening to the wrapup. The three adult coaches pace tensely behind the chain-link fence that separates the players' bench from the playing field. The children look like defeated, caged animals facing their keepers. ''Listen you guys, and listen good,'' says Josh. ''You're in the major leagues now and this is serious.'' He recaps the game, 3 zip for the Cubs at the top of third inning, error after error costing run after run by the other team. ''It was like you guys gave up, or something,'' he says. ''I mean, you just can't do that.''"

All this was joyfully apparent here this weekend when some 12,000 uniformed Salvationists gathered from all over America, brass bands blaring and tambourines jangling, to celebrate their National Centennial Congress. Looking back over a century of success, they mapped strategy for another century of open-air evangelism and openhanded service to all."

1980-06-15T00:00:00Z,"In backgammon, many games become violent confrontations in which the less fortunate player finds himself facing a closed board with several men on the bar. Because the outcome of such confrontations may be decided by a single roll, luck seems to predominate. Skillful play, however, is seldom more important than in these life-or-death situations. The successful player knows not only when to launch an all-out attack, but how to press it to final victory. In the diagrammed position, X has attacked O and has so far been successful. With five points closed in his home board, X needs only to make the 4-point in order to complete the close-out. Conversely, O, with two men on the bar, has only one hope for survival - to establish the 4-point himself. There is no question that, as X, you must ruthlessly attempt to squelch this hope -the only question is what is the most efficient and reliable way to do so."

In short, he has unwisely ignored Satchel Paige's edict of never looking back for fear something might be gaining on you."
1980-06-15T00:00:00Z,"DRAINING a container of well water from her basement storage tank recently, a New Canaan homeowner was dismayed by its sulfurous odor. The well had been tested when the house was built 14 years ago, and she had never thought to question the quality of the water since then - even though the family was totally dependent on the well for water. Now she was worried enough to call in a testing laboratory. In Brookfield last February, a homeowner was troubled when the water from the family well ''started tasting and smelling funny.'' She called the local health department and learned that a neighbor's well, just tested as a result of the same concern, was found to be contaminated with gasoline."

1980-06-16T00:00:00Z,"Instead of trying to find ways to end inflation and raise productivity, Congress seems content to sit in the grandstand tossing empty bottles down on a President as he struggles, however belatedly, to get a grip on the economy. Having rejected President Carter's fee on oil imports, retarded the Federal budget process for weeks and threatened to deprive the Council on Wage and Price Stability of money and staff to monitor inflation, Congress is shouting now for repeal of the Credit Control Act of 1969 - the one law that was available this spring to restrain borrowing without driving interest rates even higher. Some reform of the act is worth discussing, but that is hardly urgent. The law was never used by any President until last March and the credit restraints it made possible then are already being removed by the Federal Reserve. The recession has made them unnecessary. Some contend that the controls were not even necessary in March and have made the recession worse. Others say the controls served a vital function then, helping to end a speculative binge in the commodity markets and the accompanying fear of wild inflation."

But this time, apparently untroubled by the five-run rally generated by the Mets in the ninth inning on Saturday night, Knepper allowed just seven singles, gave up only one walk and retired the last seven batters to avert any last-minute theatrics."

1980-06-16T00:00:00Z,"Max Beerbohm was an English theater critic back in late Victorian days, but that is not what made him incomparable - after all, he followed G.B. Shaw in that job - but he was an urbane and witty essayist and short-story writer, which is what led to the writing of ''The Incomparable Max,'' a comedy by Jerome Lawrence and Robert E. Lee that is being revived by the Manhattan Punch Line. ''The Incomparable Max'' first apppeared on Broadway in 1971, and it was a pleasant enough affair then. In its current reincarnation, it is still amusing and stylish theater, not a belly-laugher, but a chuckler full of epigrams and wit in the British way, which is to say that their reciter delivers them with irrefutable but charming arrogance that brooks no cappers in reply. It is refreshing to listen to."

This week housing starts, capacity utilization, personal income and orders for durable goods are scheduled to be released, and money market economists predict they will all show declines."

No. An out-of-bounds fence is not an obstruction. Your opponent should have incurred a three-stroke penalty, one for lifting the ball and two for not replacing it."

There is good reason for this: the economics of urban construction today can barely justify the building of a single townhouse, let alone a unified block of them; when a site large enough for an entire row of houses becomes available for residential development, it inevitably is used for large, high-rise construction. All of this notwithstanding, the developer Sheldon Solow has planned for some time to erect a row of 11 houses on East 67th Street in New York City, just west of the sleek glass apartment tower he recently completed at the corner of Second Avenue. The land was purchased by Mr. Solow as part of the assemblage for the apartment house, and it now contains the apartment house's garage; the townhouses are to be built above the garage, so the economics become more feasible."

A dozen yards away, six other Indians stood sentry by a pickup truck on Racquette Point Road, blocking the only access by land to what, for some, had become their Dunkirk. In fact, they were guarding a two-square-mile parcel on the St. Lawrence River that is the stronghold of ''traditional'' Mohawks on this compound in a remote corner of northern New York State."

1980-06-16T00:00:00Z,"Cut off even from Republican legislative patronage, deep in debt and getting deeper, the Republican State Committee in New York is ''bankrupt,'' according to its chairman, Dr. Bernard Kilbourn. Dr. Kilbourn made the statement last week, as the party prepared for its annual fund-raiser next Thursday, which will feature two of the nation's most prominent Republicans, Ronald Reagan and Gerald R. Ford. But the proceeds will be only a temporary palliative for the fiscally stricken state committee, which -despite what Dr. Kilbourn called its bankruptcy - may not actually go out of business because it was established by the state's election law."

You add your water or milk or whatever to the cup, hold it up to the eye and thus determine the exact quantity in the cup. Metal cups, I have pointed out, are destined for measuring solids such as flour, sugar or salt. You add your solids to the cup, scrape off the top precisely and there you have an exact cup, half a cup, quarter cup and so on."

Blum, the scholarly Israeli delegate to the United Nations, trots over to the blue and cream Security Council chamber for another tongue-lashing over his nation's treatment of Palestinian Arabs. Mr. Blum usually manages a derisive smile as Israel is deplored, regretted or otherwise chastised. As a rule the best he can expect is an abstention by the United States while the 14 other Council members vote against him."
1980-06-16T00:00:00Z,"In some of his recent recordings, Karl Richter has shown signs of unsureness. It was as if the newer, more modish performance practices had shaken his convictions about his own straightforwardness just enough to undercut his effectiveness. Mr. Richter, honed in the Bach style of his native Saxony, was never one to capitulate cravenly to what he calls ''the purists.'' But he seemed to have lost his confidence, his sense of purpose in the projection of his kind of musicmaking. But Friday night at Avery Fisher Hall, as part of the Basically Bach Festival, Mr. Richter was in full command. This was neither the sometimes eccentric, authenticity-uber alles style of Bach-playing, nor the occasionally uneasy compromises that Richard Westenburg settles for. But Mr. Richter's Bach did not wallow in the Romantic bathos of an earlier generation, either. It filled the hall admirably with sound, it contrasted well with Mr. Westenburg's more timid approach, and it made for a highly effective concert."
1980-06-16T00:00:00Z,"Come the hot days of summer, what's the woman with yards of hair going to do with it? New Yorkers of all ages are going back to their schoolgirl days, wearing braids. It's a tidy way to get a lot of hair off the back of the neck and especially practical for bicycling, jogging or sunning at the beach. Braids can be twined right down to the ends of the hair or the bottom of the braid left loose in a brush effect. The braids themselves can be twisted into coronets or woven into circles."
1980-06-16T00:00:00Z,"The irony,'' Ron Silverman, producer of ''Brubaker,'' said in describing the decade he spent attempting to get some director, studio or star to make the film, ''is to try for 10 1/2 years to get a movie made and have it end up starring Robert Redford.'' Like ''The China Syndrome'' and ''Norma Rae,'' with which it has much in common, ''Brubaker'' is intended as a serious, socially significant film with a political point of view. Based on the experiences of Tom Murton, the warden who dug up three bodies on an Arkansas prison farm in 1968 and has not gotten a job in prison administration since, the $13 million movie details a pervasive corruption. There is not much to choose from among the prison-board member who sells the prison farm-insurance policies on nonexistent machinery, the doctor who treats only the prisoners who can pay for his services and the inmate kitchen helpers who steal the food meant for the prisoners and sell it back at 50 cents a bologna sandwich."

The race was the women's 800-meter run on the third and final day of the Athletics Congress national outdoor track and field championships. Mrs. Mims led from the start and won by 15 meters in 1 minute 58.75 seconds. The time was a meet record and the second fastest by an American to her 1:57.90 in 1976."

1980-06-16T00:00:00Z,"The World Bank is not really Robert McNamara's. It just looked that way during the extraordinary 12 years of his tenure as its president. It's not even the United States' or that of any of the 135 membernations. Mr. McNamara simply served longer than three of his four predecessors, also eminent Americans, and thus had the opportunity to leave a deep mark on the international aid agency. When he steps down next year, he will have carried through a fundamental shift in the global approach to poverty - a shift from power dams to pruning hooks, from a trickle-down strategy to aid programs that begin in the ground. That is not what might have been expected when Mr. McNamara took the job in 1968. He was a Detroit-trained hardware specialist who tragically misjudged the Vietnam War as Secretary of Defense, partly because he put too much faith in technology. Perhaps that experience caused him to rethink a World Bank development strategy that, in the spirit of its time, exalted growth and gave short shrift to fair distribution. The once invisible rural poor - there are about 800 million of them - found they had a friend at the World Bank (more augustly known as the International Bank for Reconstruction and Development) eager to underwrite dirt farming and family planning."

Politically, there is a major reason for doing so. By recessing, both houses gave their leaders the authority to call them back into special session rather than leave Governor Carey with the sole authority to do so, which would have been the case if they had adjourned sine die, or indefinitely. It also gave the leaders more potential political power in determining legislative priorities."

By a combined vote of 403 to 44 the House and Senate rejected President Carter's 10-cent-a-gallon fee on imported oil. So emphatic a denial of the President's bid to ease dependence on foreign oil by taxing auto fuel is all too easy to explain. With gasoline temporarily in abundant supply and the election just months away, Congress was no more likely to respond in the affirmative than 5-year-olds asked to finish their brussel sprouts. But the gasoline tax will be back - if only because virtually every expert (privately including most leaders of Congress) sees it as the least disruptive way to curb oil imports. For now, one can only hope that proponents will learn from the defeat. To wit:"

Pollution, industrial and domestic, ended all that, but in recent years Newport and Sunapee, communities on the river's upper reaches, have installed sewage treatment plants, and the Sugar's water quality has improved markedly. A few days ago, Victor Pomiecko of Claremont and I journeyed to the stretch of the Sugar that runs between the Claremont-Newport Highway and North Newport. Access to it is provided by the abandoned Claremont-Concord Railroad bed that runs along much of the river. The railroad's right of way in that area now belongs to the state, and because ties and tracks have been removed it is negotiable by automobile."

Paddy Flood's opinions should be listened to at least as respectfully as Merrill Lynch's, but it says here that this time he is mistaken. Duran will introduce young Leonard to the seamy side of life. ''It's Ray Robinson against Jake LaMotta,'' Paddy says, ''Ali against Frazier, classic boxer against street brawler.'' The analogies are flawed. First time Muhammad Ali boxed Joe Frazier, the brawler knocked the classic boxer on his bustle and gave him a whipping. Their second bout was ruined when Tony Perez, the referee, let Ali grab and hold like a lovelorn octopus, yet some of us thought Frazier still earned a shade. Only in their third match, the ordeal in Manila, was Ali a clear winner, and even then he was losing until he blinded Frazier and punched him into obsolescence. Ali himself said it was ''next to death.''"

Their salaries range from $45,000 a year to $45 a week for part-time work. There is nothing illegal about such hiring - it is a practice as old as the Legislature itself.

None of the Royal home runs came from renowned sluggers.

Seibert, a fifth grade teacher at Friends Academy in Locust Valley, L.I., met Aoki for the first time last March 26.

(A16:1-2.) A layoff of 2,300 auto workers at the General Motors plant in East Baltimore has followed the drop in car sales caused by high gasoline prices and the switch to imports from Japan.

Metropolitan The Republican State Committee in New York is financially ''bankrupt,'' its chairman, Dr. Bernard Kilbourn, said last week as the party prepared for its annual fund-raiser Thursday, which is to be attended by Ronald Reagan and Gerald R.

Casino developers in Atlantic City attempted, with the help of the director of the Planning Board, to bend the city's pending master plan to avoid its casino site requirements. The Zoning Board later gave its approval and the Planning Board's director went to work for the casino developers. However, the State Casino Control Commission ultimately stepped in and forced the developers to modify their plan. The case illustrates what some officials say is a pattern of close relations between casino developers and local government officials since gambling was approved in Atlantic City in 1976. (A1:1.) Illegal-gun dealers thrive in New York City and are largely responsible for the 2 million unlicensed handguns sold in the city in the last 10 years. One dealer gets his guns from Pennsylvania, Vermont and other nearby states. He says made nearly $100,000 last year in unreported income and, he says, New York State's new gun-control law, which Governor Carey believes is the nation's toughest, will have little effect on his business. (A1:1.) The Assembly passed 250 bills in Albany in a little more than 12 hours, then joined the Senate in recessing. One bill that gained approval would outlaw ''head shops,'' according to its sponsors. (B1:5-6.)

At a bad time in his life a few years ago - when his mother was dying of cancer, his wife had just been operated on for a brain tumor she turned out not to have, and all over his home county ''town houses and condominiums were devouring orchards and vineyards just as they'd devoured the potato farms on Long Island'' - he began ''to long for an escape into orderliness and decided, with the same hapless logic that governed all my actions then, to leave home and spend the rest of the spring at Golden Gate Fields, a thoroughbred track in Albany, near Oakland and San Francisco. There were other things I might have done, friends who would have taken me in, but I was convinced there was something special about racing and I wanted to get to the heart of the matter. The track seemed circumscribed and manageable, especially when compared to the complex filigree of nature, hydrogen intertwined with embryos and tumors. I kept thinking about the fat man'' he'd met in an Off Track Betting parlor back East ''and the pulse I'd first heard beating on Long Island. I thought if I could touch it, I might come away renewed.''"

1980-06-16T00:00:00Z,"FEARLESS FRANK'' is just about enough to break your heart. This British musical has a uniformly ingratiating cast and one of the wittiest librettos of the season. Its title character, the literary scoundrel Frank Harris, is a fount of devilish fun, and he is perfectly embodied by the sly Irish actor Niall Toibin. But if the show at the Princess Theater is always pleasant, literate and sweet, it never for a second catches fire. ''Fearless Frank'' lacks the one intangible ingredient that separates successful musical comedies from the also-rans - showbiz know-how. Such know-how consists mainly of hard, detailed work. In a musical, a lot of diverse components must somehow be assembled into a seamless theatrical organism. Unless each fine point of the production, from the first orchestral downbeat to the final blackout, is precisely tuned, the show remains earthbound. This precision is completely missing in ''Fearless Frank,'' as it is in many British musicals. For some inexplicable reason, English theater people, who are so smart about everything else, often come to grief when trying to assemble effective song-and-dance shows. Though British musicals can succeed here, it sometimes takes a Broadway hand to stir the raw materials into an incendiary mix. It's not happenstance that such current London-bred hits as ''A Day in Hollywood/A Night in the Ukraine'' and ''Evita'' have been staged, respectively, by Tommy Tune and Hal Prince."

The intelligence agency's research and development staff was also interested in the secret life of plants, peace pills and an array of other futuristic schemes that were discarded as impracticable or as quackery, according to about 3,000 heavily censored pages of study evaluations and other documents relating to C.I.A. activities from 1965 to 1975. The material has been made public at the agency's headquarters in Langley, Va., as a result of a request under the Freedom of Information Act initiated by The New York Times."
1980-06-16T00:00:00Z,"The season of communal al fresco activities is upon us. New Yorkers love parades, festivals, celebrations, demonstrations and entertainments, particularly when such occasions bring large numbers of them together outdoors. The finer the weather, the greater the urge to gather, the sweeter the siren call of causes. Over the years, these public events have moved around town. Union Square, long the scene of political oratory and promises of a better world, saw its last really good turnout for the first Earth Day, in 1970. The Battery and Lower Manhattan were the setting for an unforgettable Bicentennial celebration in 1976, and a few events since. But for some time now, the most popular place to gather has been the Sheep Meadow in Central Park, which was never meant to withstand the tramp of thousands of carefree or protesting feet."

Although ordinary window glass seems to pass sunlight unimpeded, iron oxide within it, which comes from the sand used in production, absorbs a considerable percentage of solar energy. The new types of glass, in which the iron oxide has been altered or removed, allow far more energy to pass. Specialists see such glass as ultimately applicable to windows in homes that exploit passive solar heating, allowing sunlight to fall on heat-absorbing floors and walls."

1980-06-17T00:00:00Z,"FROM the self revelations of children that made up ''The Me Nobody Knows,'' Gary William Friedman, Will Holt and Robert Livingston, who, respectively, wrote the music and the lyrics and staged that unusual Off Broadway musical 10 years ago, have turned to the other end of the spectrum of life, to people who look in the mirror and find ''not the me I know.'' Their new musical, ''Turns,'' which opened last Tuesday evening at the American Theater of Actors' Chernuchin Theater, 314 West 54th Street, is about the viewpoints and discoveries that come with aging, based on writings by the elderly, just as ''The Me Nobody Knows'' was based on the writings of children. If aging means a diminishing and narrowing of one's life, it is not evident in the contributions of the various anonymous writers whose work Mr. Livingston has adapted as a script for this show."
1980-06-17T00:00:00Z,"THE Murderer of Pedralbes'' is a lengthy interview with a convicted killer, and as he tells his story it becomes less and less clear. Jose Luis Cerveto, the subject of this 1978 Spanish documentary, is examined from every conceivable angle during the course of the film, as jurists, neighbors, family friends and doctors try to account for his behavior. Mr. Cerveto explains his actions, too, detailing the most vicious aspects of his crime in a perfectly matterof-fact manner. ''The Murderer of Pedralbes,'' which opens today at the Public Theater, was directed by Gonzalo Herralde, who uses the combination of Mr. Cerveto's polite articulateness and his violent nature as the film's most inescapable irony. Mr. Cerveto speaks in a calm, helpful way as the story of his life unfolds, even as he describes the murder victims as ''the couple that caused me the problem I had.'' He shows the camera a diary and scrapbook, largely devoted to pictures of children, and then describes his history of molesting little boys. He is seen chopping an onion as he speaks of a fondness for machetes. His bloodthirstiness is mentioned repeatedly by the film's other interviewees, but in conversation Mr. Cerveto is almost frighteningly placid."

But in general, it is best to keep the winning trump lurking in the wings as long as possible. The right technique in such cases is often to insure that the defender can ruff a loser but not a winner.

The matinee offered ''Serenade,'' ''Allegro Brillante,'' ''Meditation'' and ''Diamonds'' and the evening's bill, conducted by Hugo Fiorato, included Mr. Balanchine's curious but now rather tired-looking version of ''Swan Lake,'' the ''Tchaikovsky Pas de Deux,'' spectacularly danced by Suzanne Farrell and Peter Martins, and the season's first performances of ''Divertimento from 'Le Baiser de la Fee' '' and ''Tchaikovsky Suite No. 3.''

That fact gives his views a little extra weight, a little extra leeway. Mr. Genscher had no special grounding in international affairs, but he has been in office six years now, traveled the world, met all the major leaders, and learned prodigiously. Though he usually leaves most of the declaiming to Mr. Schmidt, he has developed firm positions which help to focus West German policy through the clouds of daily debate and diplomacy."

Mix them well in the steamy cauldron of New Orleans's French Quarter, then add the ominous touch of Southern Louisiana's bayou country and the threat of a rapidly approaching hurricane. What sort of fictional concoction are you likely to get? No more, one might justifiably expect, than a sensational, perhaps lurid suspense-thriller. But in the hands of playwright-novelist Peter Feibleman this disparate assemblage has been molded into an arresting tale that provides some striking portraits of both its exotic locale and its somewhat eccentric characters."

1980-06-17T00:00:00Z,"475,0The energetic Northeastern states that 150 years ago led our nation into the industrial age are now leading it into the postindustrial age. Despite a clouded recent economic past, and less-thancheerful short-term national and international projections, many factors that contributed to our temporary regional eclipse behind the Sun Belt are emerging as our greatest strengths. How have these onetime liabilities suddenly become assets? The Northeast (New York, New Jersey, Pennsylvania, the six New England states) was considered even recently too crowded to be of any further economic use - at best, a questionable judgment. We form the core of the largest, most-affluent consumer market in the hemisphere, if not the world.

These new efforts do not focus on educational programs specifically designed to supplement instruction in the same way as teaching materials such as textbooks. Instead, they focus on the regular programs - soap operas, situation comedies and dramas - that dominate daily schedules and the viewing time of many children. The most systematic new approach is a special ''curriculum'' just completed by Dorothy and Jerome Singer, co-directors of Yale University's Family Television Research and Consultation Center."

1980-06-17T00:00:00Z,"Senator Lawton Chiles and some fellow reformers in Congress simply will not let go of their misguided pursuit of the ''grassroots lobbyist.'' Having usefully made lobbyists accountable for their conduct on Capitol Hill, they insist on pursuing them out among the citizenry to require disclosure of their propaganda tactics, sources of money and hidden hand in organized letter-writing to Congress. We think we understand the problem. Lawmakers' lives have, in fact, been complicated by the growing skill of special interest groups at stirring up the folks back home. But one group's special interest is another's public interest. And while a lobbyist in Congress and his paymasters should be known, their political communication and activities among the public should normally be free and uncontrolled. If Congressmen cannot distinguish between private mail from constituents and an organized barrage of letters from the National Rifle Association or Common Cause, they're probably in the wrong line of work. And if on some new issue they're in doubt, what's wrong with a little concern about the true views of their constituents?"

The Governor held to a relatively austere budget as the legislators approach an election campaign. Mr. Anderson forced the Governor to break his promise to hold New York's transit fare at 50 cents. The transportation subsidy plan that was hitched to a tax on oil company profits may not survive the inevitable court tests. If the courts deny the stipulation that the tax not be passed to consumers, Mr. Carey would need a much larger fare increase than the indicated 10 cents or a new tax subsidy for which Mr. Anderson would exact a stiff price."

Mr. Cerveto explains his actions, too, detailing the most vicious aspects of his crime in a perfectly matterof-fact manner. ''The Murderer of Pedralbes,'' which opens today at the Public Theater, was directed by Gonzalo Herralde, who uses the combination of Mr. Cerveto's polite articulateness and his violent nature as the film's most inescapable irony. Mr. Cerveto speaks in a calm, helpful way as the story of his life unfolds, even as he describes the murder victims as ''the couple that caused me the problem I had.'' He shows the camera a diary and scrapbook, largely devoted to pictures of children, and then describes his history of molesting little boys. He is seen chopping an onion as he speaks of a fondness for machetes. His bloodthirstiness is mentioned repeatedly by the film's other interviewees, but in conversation Mr. Cerveto is almost frighteningly placid."

That is the growing suspicion based on considerable but inconclusive evidence of doctors who have long wondered why they have had to administer ever larger doses of antibiotics to combat bacterial infections in their patients. Part of the answer may be that the doctors themselves have so overused drugs like penicillin and tetracycline that the bacteria have learned to fight back, so to speak, by becoming resistant."

Two British scientists have reported in the journal Nature, however, that useful experiments can be carried out on living human brains without penetrating the skull. P.A. Merton and H.B.

1980-06-17T00:00:00Z,"IN 1,200 years, if the present trend continues, Earth's magnetic poles should do a flip-flop, and all those compass needles that normally point north will then be pointing south. For several years, scientists studying Earth through spacecraft observations have noted an apparently slight, steady decline in the intensity of the magnetic field. They postulate that this could be the early sign of an approaching magnetic reversal, which happens at intervals of 50,000 to 1 million years. The last well-documented reversal occurred 700,000 years ago. New data confirming this trend of declining magnetic intensity have now been gathered by the first American spacecraft expressly designed to study Earth's magnetic properties."

1980-06-17T00:00:00Z,"THE Eagles, who drew a capacity crowd of 70,000 fans to Giants Stadium in New Jersey's Meadowlands on Sunday, have changed. They were the most commercially successful American rock band of the 70's, and to many listeners they have always epitomized laid-back California country-rock. The last time they performed in this area, which was more than three years ago, they were laid-back. At the Madison Square Garden show this reviewer saw, they strung together ballads and medium-tempo harmony numbers for what seemed like an eternity; the proceedings grew spirited only when their newest member, Joe Walsh, was taking one of his barnstorming guitar solos. At the time, Mr. Walsh hadn't yet been effectively integrated into the lineup, and one wondered how the addition of this extroverted musician, who seemed so different from the other Eagles, would affect the band's approach. On records, the change has been one of degree rather than kind; the group rocks more, but the music is still carefully crafted and polished to a high gloss. On stage at Giants Stadium, the Eagles were a different band. They projected a steady, powerful intensity, and they projected it as a unit."

They fear that a diminishing gene pool would make it difficult to find an old genetic variety, or breed a new one, that could be used if the modern seed strains should prove vulnerable to sudden and unforeseen diseases or climatic changes. The slow erosion of the genetic diversity of food crops in recent years has been due mainly to the emphasis on planting only those seed varieties that will produce the most food for a growing world population."

With their No. 1 pick in the 10-round draft, the Diamonds selected Old Dominion's Nancy Lieberman, surely the most famous and perhaps the most talented player to be drafted since the struggling league's inception in 1978. The Stars, reluctant to trade up and pay the $100,000 a year that Miss Lieberman is seeking, took another Old Dominion player, 5-foot-10-inch Chris Critelli, with the last selection of the first round."

Texas, a coal-consuming state, has led the way to the conversion of industry and utilities from natural gas to coal as a boiler fuel to generate electricity. This conversion has since been mandated nationally by the Powerplant and Industrial Fuel Act of 1978. In the past, Texas utilities were induced to use Northwestern coal and to commit themselves to long-term contracts for buying that coal by low severance taxes and low freight rates for hauling the coal."

What New York has done is to increase the allowable penalties for handgun violations. That may have a deterrent value, especially if plea bargaining, as intended, becomes more difficult. But the law still gives judges wide discretion in deciding punishment and it remains to be seen whether it can be very effective at all. We hope it will be, and that the state's police, prosecutors and judges enforce it energetically. Too many New Yorkers are endangered by the still expanding arsenals of deadly weapons."

The measure had been intended to give Bronx and Manhattan politicians greater sway over State Supreme Court judgeships in their boroughs. Mr. Carey said that a new judicial district for the Bronx would ''unnecessarily fragment'' the court system and that, because of constitutional limitations, such a law would preclude other action to realign the state's judicial boundaries for a decade. He added that the Legislature should wait at least until the 1980 census was completed to redraw the lines."

1980-06-18T00:00:00Z,"OVER the years I have written at times about menu terminology when dishes are listed as fish or chicken in Champagne sauce, beef Chambertin or other dishes that bear the name of a specific kind of wine. I feel that chefs often take a permissible latitude in naming these dishes. My contention is that as long as the chef uses an excellent wine, even one that might be obscure to the average restaurant-going public, no great damage is done if he replaces one good Burgundy with another, or a first-rate Alsatian wine with another. But a case could be made for the fact that if a menu lists a Champagne sauce in the dining room, you should indeed use a Champagne in the kitchen."

Chicken soup, richly golden with little globules of fat floating on its surface, submerged vegetables visible just beneath. Primordial psychological medicine, Jewish soul food, a mother's legacy, and best of all, cheap grub. Seems just the sort of thing we should be pursuing these inflationary days. And to help us along comes a bright little book, at once a guide to the gastronomic oddments of the New Jersey Pine Barrens and a book of recipes to help us meet the rising costs of food."

Brody. That article showed drawings of the Strolee juvenile car seat together with the General Motors car seat, labeling both seats as unsafe and picturing the Bobby-Mac Company car seat as safe. Such conclusions are totally unwarranted. Strolee is the world's largest manufacturer of juvenile car seats, selling in excess of 500,000 seats per year. The company has never had a reported instance of an injury to a child through a car seat failure. In this era of consumer litigation, if our car seat was not safe, would our company not have been sued? Yet our record is unblemished, no claims have ever been made and no lawsuits have ever been brought against us for injury to a child through car seat failure."

He lives in Los Angeles, where he is the chairman of the Sugar Ray Youth Foundation, and as the Leonard-Duran welterweight title fight approaches, perhaps it's time to remember the original Sugar Ray, the one his manager, George Gainford, always called ''Robi'son.'' ''There are no small fights for Robi'son,'' George Gainford once proclaimed. ''Only big ones.'' As the world welterweight, middleweight and almost lightheavyweight champion, Sugar Ray Robinson inspired the phrase that is now as much a part of boxing as the ring. The phrase is ''pound for pound, the best ...'' In recent years that phrase has been used to describe Roberto Duran, and after Friday night's extravaganza in Montreal it will be used to describe the winner.

1980-06-18T00:00:00Z,"IF there is one nutrient that has the decks stacked against it, it's fat. The typical American diet has a higher fat content than nearly any other in the world. While agreement on this issue is not universal, many scientists blame this high-fat diet for a number of our chronic health problems and killing diseases, among them heart disease, obesity and possibly cancers of the colon and breast. Fat is a more concentrated source of calories than any other nutrient and thus is the most fattening foodstuff we regularly consume. A gram of dietary fat supplies your body with nine calories, compared to only four calories per gram of carbohydrates or protein. Even alcohol has fewer calories (seven per gram) than fat. Thus, cutting down on fats is one of the best ways to reduce caloric intake and achieve and maintain a normal body weight."

NBC-TV and CBS-TV will provide gavel-to-gavel evening coverage, and ABC-TV will cover it less continuously, breaking away from 8 o'clock to 9 the first two nights to offer special editions of ''20/20,'' its magazine program. In effect, ABC is opting for a middle ground: more coverage than they offered in 1976, but less than their rivals'. Roone Arledge, president of ABC News and Sports, has mixed feelings about saturation coverage. ''We don't want to do entertainment as usual, and the '20/ 20' specials will probably have a political slant,'' he said. ''But in our judgment, looking at what's going to be happening, we just don't think it's going to be worth straight news coverage all the way through. There is no contest, no major floor fights, no outstanding issues and not much scheduled but a parade of minor politicians who get to stand up on the platform and make speeches.''"

Then each state would be given a quota based in part on its past need for gasoline; the states, in turn, would make special provisions for government, business and hardship cases.

The film is a montage of footage shot by Mr. Ricker, a New Yorkborn lawyer turned film maker, at two reunions of surviving Kansas City musicians and at a concert performance by Count Basie and his band at the University of Kansas at Lawrence. Music is the subject of the movie, but the personalities who made it (some of whom are still making it) and their reminiscences are the movie's method."

When they ask for low-fat cheese, most dealers are likely to suggest Swiss Chris, a mild semisoft cheese made in Wisconsin. According to the label on the uncut cheese, it provides eight grams of fat per oneounce (or 28.35-gram) serving, for a total fat content of about 29 percent. Thus, the fat in Swiss Chris is about the same as in Muenster, Edam, Gouda, Gruyere, Swiss, Port-Salut and Jarlsberg as well as most processed cheeses. It is a low-cholesterol, not a low-fat cheese - made low in cholesterol by substituting cholesterol-free vegetable oil for some of the cholesterol-laden butterfat. (Neither, for that matter, is Swiss Lorraine a low-fat cheese; rather, it is another widely marketed low-cholesterol product also made by replacing some of the butterfat with vegetable fat.)"
