1989-03-12T00:00:00Z,"LEAD: The whole is not as good as parts of ''The Sunday Promenade'' by Lars Forssell, but the good parts make this strange play at the New Theater of Brooklyn an amusing evening. Mr. Forssell's imagination is more poetic than dramatic; he can make you find connections among wildly conflicting ideas and his dialogue often reminds you of the snipped and elliptical lines of song lyrics."

1989-03-12T00:00:00Z,"LEAD: THE BOOK OF RUTH. By Jane Hamilton. (Ticknor & Fields, $18.95.) On the surface, it's classic tabloid fodder.

1989-03-12T00:00:00Z,"LEAD: THE FRENCH REVOLUTION was neither the best of times nor the most frivolous, but there will be plenty of frivolity throughout Republican Paris this year. It seems every museum, every arrondissement's city hall, even every esoteric reading club, is vying to mark the events of 1789, although of course no one wants to re-create the parts that make everybody uneasy."
1989-03-12T00:00:00Z,"LEAD: In the first official look at who voted and who did not in the 1988 Presidential election, a Census Bureau study shows increasing disaffection among young people, minority people and the less educated."

(Feb. 19) confirms my most depressing fears about the Byzantine world of book publishing, and about any naive hopes I may have had of becoming a published author.

1989-03-12T00:00:00Z,"LEAD: Since its invention, photography has been associated with mirrors: it seems to reflect the world directly back at us. When we look at a print of turn-of-the-century Paris by Eugene Atget, we seldom ask if that's the way Paris really looked at the time.

1989-03-12T00:00:00Z,"LEAD: THE EXPERIMENTAL CHOREOGRAPHY of Trisha Brown tends to defy standard characterization, even by the choreographer herself. ''I struggle with it,'' she admits. ''It's important to try and demystify it, yet not take away the mystery. There's no narrative structure, but that's the excitement. It has impact and it has meaning, but it's not a story."
