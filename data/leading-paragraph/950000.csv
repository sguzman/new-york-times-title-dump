The writer shows great good sense, because it is also my opinion in saying that Goethe's prose is not equal to Lessing's. In fact, Lessing has done a great many things far better than any German before or after him."
1899-09-30T00:00:00Z,"I read with much interest the instructive review of Dorman B.

The events of this novel are of a bygone age, when prudery and delicacy of thought were little known, and humanity was gloriously vested in its aboriginal purity and strength of conduct."
1899-09-30T00:00:00Z,"I would suggest to your correspondent ""Malta,"" who inquires.

Taking the values of these mineral products for the past six mouths of the present year, the great total of 1898 will be very much exceeded."

1899-10-01T00:00:00Z,"In your paper of Sept. 28 your article headed ""Col. Shaw on Pensions"" seems to me a strange expression of opinion for a leading New York paper. I am not an old soldier.

1899-10-01T00:00:00Z,"It is not without significance, whether the coincidence were accidental or not, that the action of the President confirming the sentence of Capt. CARTER was announced on the day that the army was joining in the tribute of the Nation to Admiral DEWEY. Terrible as is the fate of the faithless officer, his punishment is an illustration of the standard which the United States sets for its soldiers and its sailors."

TRACY has frankly explained his connection with the Ramapo Company his best friends must admit that the Mazet committee did him a substantial service in giving him the opportunity to make a public explanation.

MAHAN and the statement of Mr. CLARKE as to the candidacy of Mr. MAZET and that of Mr. STEWART in the Nineteenth Assembly District put the case for the Republican candidate as strongly as it can be put.

1899-11-26T00:00:00Z,"Business of fair volume has continued throughout the week, but it has shown little change from the desultory character of the dealings of the last two months, and no features have been developed, either in the matter of individual transactions or in general market conditions. Better inquiry for investment properties, particularly in the lower part of the city, and slightly increased activity in low-priced flats and tenements are, however, encouraging phases of the present situation."
1899-11-26T00:00:00Z,"CAMBRIDGE, Mass., Nov. 25. -- Football enthusiasm received a partial revival here to-day when the Harvard freshmen defeated their youthful Yale rivals by the large score of 54 to 0.

It will not do to say that the speaking at its banquets is always good, but it never fails of being the best that at the given time it is practicable to secure."
1899-11-26T00:00:00Z,"In recent times much reliance has been placed upon dogs for arctic traveling. Yet nothing has been done with them to be compared with what men have achieved without dogs.

Let us hope that he is an American born, and not one who has broken his vows to his native land to act as a sycophant to the country of his adoption.

1899-11-26T00:00:00Z,IT SEEMS to me that the resolution passed Nov. 18 in San Francisco by the reorganized Church of Jesus Christ of the Latter Day Saints is the only position on the subject which should be taken and held by the opponents of Mormon or any other polygamy. It is as follows:

It probably will be rebuilt."
1899-11-26T00:00:00Z,"MANILA, Nov. 25. -- The news which the steamship Brutus brings from Dagupan dispels all doubts that the so-called Filipino Republic is crumbling like a house of cards.

1899-11-26T00:00:00Z,"It has always been a reproach to European countries that mendicancy was acknowledged tacitly to be one of the Old World institutions.

1899-11-26T00:00:00Z,"BERLIN, Nov. 25. -- Although expected, the burial of the Anti-Strike bill came more swiftly than anticipated by either the Government or the Reichstag. The collapse was due to the conviction of the Centrists that their amendments would not be accepted by the Government."

This fact makes the Lenox people doubly determined to use every effort possibl to prevent the electric road entering this town."
1899-11-26T00:00:00Z,"Though I am not by calling a foolkiller or a reformer, I take the liberty of answering a letter which appeared in yesterday's TIMES. The writer of this epistle has much to say about the ""cruel and causeless war"" which England is waging against the Transvaal. Let that pass. What astonishes me in Mr. Carlin's letter are these statements: ""As a Nation, we are under no obligation to England."

This is a truth which the managers of theatres have especial reason to ponder, and doubtless they do give it a good deal of attention."

1899-12-23T00:00:00Z,"To seek fame in one direction and find it unexpectedly, and very often accidentally, in quite another, has been the fate of many gifted men. The Rev. Charles Lutwidge Dodgson, grave, dignified, and scholarly Oxford don, devoted to mathematics and logic throughout his long life, could never reconcile himself to accept the renown which came to ""Lewis Carroll"" as the author of those ingenious and delightful whimsicalities in ""Alice in Wonderland."""

1899-12-23T00:00:00Z,"A few years later than the ""shrinking schoolgirl"" period I took up ""Les Miserables"" after a brief convalescence. No one had ""pushed me into the arms of that Moloch of dreariness,"" nor did the reading of it ""entail such a strain on my endurance as to leave me wan and enfeebled for six months afterward."" Had some kind fate suggested one-tenth of the grandeur contained therein I would have read it sooner."
1899-12-23T00:00:00Z,"W.J. BRYAN does not perceive the remarkable change that has come over the South. The men of the Southern States used to be absorbed in politics.

1899-12-23T00:00:00Z,"There are few things a man knows less about than his own self, and few things which, for ignorance of, there is less excuse made for him. But the knowing never so intimately and the expressing quite honestly are two different things. Here we have not a memoir, but an autobiography, what, par excellence, concerns the man; and there is no task so hard. Most men could as easily describe the seventh heaven."
1899-12-23T00:00:00Z,"When Bernard Quaritch died in London on Sunday, Dec. 17, there passed from the bibliographical world probably the most remarkable man that ever entered it.

1899-12-23T00:00:00Z,The discussion of the power of the Secretary of the Treasury to come to the relief of the money market in certain contingencies and of the effective way to do so if the contingency should require is not at the present moment a discussion of what can be called a burning question.

1899-12-24T00:00:00Z,"In your issue of Dec. 20 you publish Mr. Shearman's twenty-six articles against the Boers, but with all the legal ability of the writer he makes out a poor case.

1899-12-24T00:00:00Z,"That is a fearful arraignment of the Boers in Mr. Thomas G. Shearman's letter addressed to you, published in this morning's TIMES. Its bill of particulars is so lengthy and so specific that it impresses one with the conviction it must be correct. And yet, like many a similar effort, in its very force (apparent) lies its weakness."

Shearman, in twenty-three cantos, as it were, gives his opinion of the Republic of the Transvaal in such form that if the illiterate, ignorant rigmarole did not bespeak the writer's status, moral and mental, one would be led to think the Dutch race (our own respected founders) should never have supplanted the hottentot Kings of Southern Africa."

1899-12-24T00:00:00Z,I have read with the keenest pleasure the letters of Mr. Bleecker Miller and Mr. Shearman.

1899-12-24T00:00:00Z,"Wall Street approaches a forlorn Christmas. A year of buoyant activity, of confidence begotten of evidences indisputable that great good times have come to the country, is offset, unsettled, and made to look insignificant by disturbance extraordinary from whatsoever standpoint it may be viewed."
1899-12-24T00:00:00Z,"I have been a reader of your paper for about twenty years, and have read it with a good deal of satisfaction, and no doubt considerable profit, and still read it, and expect to do so, but there comes over me a sense of great weariness when I read your editorials of recent date regarding our relations with Great Britain in connection with the South African war."

1899-12-24T00:00:00Z,Permit me to thank you for your recent editorials on the British defeats and Transvaal question in general. They will indeed commend themselves to all lovers of justice. England's isolated position is due to the moral support she afforded this country during the Spanish war.

From the tone of the letters advocating the Boer side I judge that the writers are worked up to a much higher heat than are those on the other side.

1900-01-30T00:00:00Z,"To the Editor of The New York Times: From the comments of all the English newspapers without exception it would seem that the British are exceedingly prejudiced in favor of courage.
