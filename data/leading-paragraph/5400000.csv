1989-08-06T00:00:00Z,"LEAD: THERE is something a bit perverse about the idea of making wine in Rhode Island. France and California seem more suited to the wine image. Traditionally the work ethic has been reserved for woolen mills and whaling ships in New England. But the contradiction is part of the allure of Rhode Island wines, even if the history behind it is a little fanciful:"

It is time. It is long overdue."
1989-08-06T00:00:00Z,"LEAD: The current revival of the short- sleeved jacket makes so much sense one wonders what took it so long to come back. Sticky summer days take most of the fun out of dressing up; in fact, they make it a chore. Of course, there is always the option of dispensing with a jacket or blazer altogether, but that's not practical for women whose jobs, or personalities, require a touch of formality."

This upwardly mobile style started as a rugged coat for country wear and bad weather, made in sturdy fabrics like loden cloth. Leather toggles anchored it securely, a hood that buttoned under the chin kept out the wind, and the fabric was frequently water resistant so it would keep out the rain."
1989-08-06T00:00:00Z,"LEAD: Sesame noodles are the chop suey of the 80's. Just about every takeout Chinese restaurant offers the dish.

1989-08-13T00:00:00Z,"LEAD: David Horowitz and Peter Collier are opportunists of the very worst type, and the attempt to legitimize them as ''born again'' is ludicrous.

Even today, when restaurant prices are steadily rising, this continues to be true, as Uncle Dai's, a new Chinese restaurant in downtown Stamford, demonstrates.

Maud Frizon has always favored such styles, but for fall she has added some down-to-earth walking shoes. Walter Steiger's low, thick heels now have rounded edges and a thin coating of gold. Diego Della Valle sticks to the classics, and Giorgio Armani puts softening touches on tailored styles."
