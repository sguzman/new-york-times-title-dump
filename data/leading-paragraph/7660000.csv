In a statement, the secretary said, “We are taking the final step to recognize this pristine area as wilderness.” Not long after the park was created, Congress in 1976 mandated that part of it be designated wilderness; the section included Drake’s Estero, a rich marine estuary that is also home to scores of seals. That is the site of the oyster farm owned by Drake’s Bay Oyster Company, whose lease from the National Park Service was set to expire tomorrow. A bitter controversy has swirled around the issue for more than five years, dividing local environmental activists and leading to several federal investigations of the park service’s science. Some of these found troubling lapses of judgment, but none found outright scientific misconduct."
