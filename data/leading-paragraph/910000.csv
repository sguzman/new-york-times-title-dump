1898-02-20T00:00:00Z,"NEW BRUNSWICK, N.J., Feb. 19. -- Senor Quesada, a member of the Cuban Relief Committee, visited New Brunswick a few months ago and gave the local Board of Education a Cuban flag. The banner has hung unused upon the walls of tile Board of Education rooms until yesterday, when a number of the High School Cadets, a military organization in the Livingston Avenue High School, determined to float it."
1898-02-20T00:00:00Z,"PARIS, Feb. 8. -- We are now in the thick of the Zola trial; and though this letter will probably not have reached you before the result is known I may be permitted to express the belief, based on my two days' hearing of the case in court, that Zola will be acquitted. The Government has acted with great lack of discretion."
1898-02-20T00:00:00Z,"IT seems hardly possible that another year has rolled around since we attended the twenty-first annual Dog Show of the Westminster Kennel Club, and while we hold that one in pleasant memory, the coming one will no doubt eclipse anything ever seen in this country."
1898-02-20T00:00:00Z,"The earliest recorded hereditary lady Sheriffs of Westmoreland appear to have been Isabella de Clifford and Idonea de Leyburn, who held the office jointly; the latest to have been the famous Anne de Clifford, who became hereditary High Sheriff of Westmoreland in the year 1643, and appears to have fulfilled the duties of that office for more than twenty years."
1898-02-20T00:00:00Z,"It will soon be thirty-six years since the Monitor met the Merrimac in Hampton Roads, Sunday morning, March 9, 1862, and fought her to a standstill. Of the comparatively small crew of the Monitor, possibly only one man is left since Admiral Worden's death. Of the larger crew of the Merrimac, 350 men, there are remaining a mere handful, perhaps a dozen in all"
1898-02-20T00:00:00Z,"The stronghold in which Dellaripha Richardson had intrenched herself against the courts, bar, civil authorities, newspapers, and general population of New York has at last been entered and to some extent explored. A trapdoor, a secret subterranean vault, and a rusty iron strong box were appropriately among the discoveries."
1898-02-20T00:00:00Z,"It is significant to note that the effect of the purchasing movement which began among the farmers last year in the direction of replenishing stocks for field and road service has been followed by a gradual improvement in the East in almost every branch of mercantile business. The wagon-making industry is one of the lines of manufacturing which has experienced a period of activity, indicating good trade generally."
1898-02-20T00:00:00Z,"ALBANY, Feb. 19. -- Every recommendation made by Gov. Black in his message to the Legislature at the opening of the present session has materialized in the form of proposed legislation, with a single exception. That is his suggestion that a commission be created ""to examine into the commerce of New York City, the cause of its decline, the means of its revival and to report conclusions."""
1898-02-20T00:00:00Z,"I was so fortunate as to meet an Americanized Russian who has been instrumental in bringing more of his people to this country than any other person. He had been a medical student in Russia, became connected with a Nihilist plot, was suspected, arrested, and sentenced to Siberia, but made his escape, and came to this country five years ago."
1898-02-20T00:00:00Z,"BERLIN, Feb. 7. -- Notwithstanding the ultra-official nature of the various fetes, banquets, and patriotic meetings which took place on the occasion of the Emperor's birthday, it would be childish, even for the most Chauvinistic Germans to pretend that the imperial birthday is looked upon by the people at large as a day of national rejoicing, as was the case under the reign of Kaiser William I."
1898-02-20T00:00:00Z,"LEBANON, Ind., Feb. 19. -- Gen. Lew Wallace has been challenged to a duel by George E. Oakes of Indianapolis.

McClellan."
1898-02-20T00:00:00Z,"The Spanish armored cruiser Vizcaya remained all day yesterday anchored off Sandy Hook, enveloped in a thick fog, on account of which her commander did not dare to venture into the harbor. She will come in this morning if it is clear. The elaborate preparations made by the Government officials to do her honor, and of the Police Department to protect her from any harm, were held in abeyance."
1898-02-20T00:00:00Z,"Following so closely a week of dealings which might almost be called phenomenal, the sales and trades of the last few days may have seemed to be of trifling character. Such a conclusion, however, is not justified, and on a fair basis of comparison, there is everything to show that the course of the market is still upward."
1898-02-20T00:00:00Z,"THE origin of rug weaving is lost in remote antiquity. The Hindus, it is known, were versed in the art of weaving as early as 1,500 years before the Christian era. It is probable that Abraham, when resting in the cool Summer evenings at the door of his tent sat on an Oriental rug or carpet."

1898-02-20T00:00:00Z,"LONDON, Feb. 19. -- There has been a decided boom at most of the theatres. The chief successes continue to be at the Court, the Haymarket, and the Criterion, and, rather unexpectedly, at Her Majesty's and at the Duke of York's, where George Edwardes produced an adaptation of ""Jalouse"" on Saturday, with Ellis Jeffreys and Seymour Hicks in the leading parts."
1898-02-20T00:00:00Z,"Machinery has widened employment most effectively by stimulating the growth of new industries, and we ought not to underestimate its effect in this direction, since it has an important bearing on the general question. Improvements in printing presses had a direct effect in extending the use of books and newspapers, and, therefore, in expanding the paper and printing industries."
1898-02-20T00:00:00Z,"Not much can be reasonably expected from the bill to encourage the purchase of home art productions just introduced in the Assembly, even assuming that this scheme may become law. It is proposed that cities of the first class and second class may annually expend $50,000 and $25,000, respectively, in the purchase of productions of American artists, said productions to include paintings, statuary, mosaics, painted or stained glass, or mural paintings and decorations."
1898-02-20T00:00:00Z,"There is a general feeling of satisfaction among the Cornell and Yale graduates in this city, now that a boat race has been arranged between these two universities and Harvard. A few weeks ago a race seemed doubtful, but during this time work toward bringing about a final understanding was being carried on secretly, and when the various representatives met at the Reform Club on Thursday evening the matter was quickly consummated."
1898-02-20T00:00:00Z,"In a Western town the other day a man committed suicide on being apprehended in the act of stealing a dictionary from a street bookstall. He had just purchased bottle of laudanum, presumably for the toothache. He drained the bottle before a hand was raised to save him. What makes the tragedy the more pitiful is the fact that the dictionary was a Latin lexicon."
1898-02-20T00:00:00Z,"Mr. Henderson's article in last Sunday's TIMES regarding the production of new or unfamiliar works at the opera, and the ""cutting"" process to which so many others are subjected, was of great interest not only to professional and amateur musicians, but to all who are in the habit of attending operatic representations whether for amusement or instruction."
1898-02-20T00:00:00Z,"Tammany Hall, as usual, has all the best of it in the seemingly hopeless fight that is being waged against it by the Willoughby Street contingent, in Brooklyn, and which was brought to an acute crisis by the efforts of Deputy Commissioner of Water Supply Moffett of Brooklyn to force Peter Milne out of the office to which he had previously recommended him."

1898-02-20T00:00:00Z,"It is usual for those officiating at either a marriage or funeral here to put on the official cap, gown, and boots -- a sign of respect rather than of authority. Those of us who customarily wear the native costume are expected to appear in public ceremonies clad as above described."

Roy Stone of the Bureau of Road Inquiry. The States through which it would pass and the General Government are to bear the expense, which would ultimately be repaid from the benefits of such a concourse."

1898-02-20T00:00:00Z,"A ROOMY house overlooking Bryant Square has been the home of many pictures by the British portrait and landscape painters of the end of the last and beginning of the present centuries, as Well as those French landscapists of the Fontainebleau school who made their headquarters in the village of Barbizon, on the edge of the forest whence on clear days one can see the towers of Notre Dame of Paris."
1898-02-20T00:00:00Z,"The unity of the Slavs is hardly more than an ethnographical abstraction. For political purposes it is non-existent. Thus, the Poles are not Czechs, although both are Slavs; they speak different tongues, the former possessing a rich literature, the latter a very poor one; their political history has little in common, and as lately as four years ago the Poles were allied with the Germans against their brothers, the Czechs."
1898-02-20T00:00:00Z,"With few subjects except ""The Master"" and ""One Summer's Day"" to consider, a review of the week may be commendably brief. Neither of these plays can be called novel or ingenious. Both are decent and serviceable, while ""The Master,"" particularly, ""acts"" very well and is likely to help Hr. Henry Miller to a much firmer place in the esteem of his public."
1898-02-20T00:00:00Z,"Some one has well said that interest in ancestry is always the result of progress in civilization. In the pioneer days of the country the men who hew out and lay the sills have little time to think of anything but the present. To them the past is practically a sealed book, and they leave the future to take care of itself."
1898-02-20T00:00:00Z,"Some twenty years ago I entered a small alehouse, about two miles beyond Farleton Crag, in Westmoreland, to get refreshment after a walk from Lancaster. In the course of my short stay I asked the mistress of the place for some ""tobacco,"" pronouncing the word very distinctly. She stared, and said: ""We don't sell it."""

The last excavation was caused by a leak in steam pipes, but I do not know the reason for the present upheaval."
1898-02-20T00:00:00Z,"LONDON, Feb. 19. -- A case which has been heard by Justice Hawkins is of interest to football players all over the world. A man was killed at football, and the prisoner was charged with manslaughter and convicted."
1898-02-20T00:00:00Z,"Here in Muscat I saw the pure bred Arab man, sinewy, but not tall, a domineering, swaggering nobleness in his glance, and a brace of daggers in his waist. When I recognized a beautiful haft or noticed a slender inlaid native gun or singular shield I offered to buy. But nothing would induce them to sell."
1898-02-20T00:00:00Z,"Although ""forensic oratory"" is fast becoming a tradition, although college debating at its best calls out but perfunctory interest from the body of students, although what is left of Congressional eloquence is worth, speaking comparatively, but a passing mention in the press, although the address is supplanting the oration, and is itself tolerated as a perhaps necessary bore, yet there probably never was a time when the ""after-dinner orator"" flourished as he does to-day."
1898-02-20T00:00:00Z,"MADRID, Feb. 19. -- A dispatch received to-day from Rear Admiral Manterola, the naval commander at Havana, says proof exists that no dead fish came to the surface after the explosion that wrecked the Maine, and that when the disaster occurred there was not the slightest upheaval of the water, such as would inevitably follow a submarine explosion."
1898-02-21T00:00:00Z,"No one supposes that Mr. SHERMAN is the real head of the State Department. He does not even fill the sometimes useful but never very honorable post of a figurehead. He not only does not perform the functions, but it is not safe to permit him to go through the motions of performing them."

1898-02-21T00:00:00Z,Few matters of current business interest in Wall Street are more interesting than the development which has been steadily going on in what is known as the outside security market.

1898-02-21T00:00:00Z,"The quarrel between the Tammany head of the Department of Public Works and the Brooklyn deputy who represents the Willoughby Street machine is not, on its face, easy to understand.

1898-02-21T00:00:00Z,"The action of the ""Massachusetts Cotton Mills Company,"" which owns mills both at Lowell and in Georgia, is certainly significant. In the reports made at the annual meeting it was stated, in substance, that the mills operated in Georgia are making a ""fair profit"" on the same class of goods at the same selling prices, while at the mills at Lowell the goods cost more than the selling price."
1898-02-21T00:00:00Z,"SAN FRANCISCO, Feb. 20. -- Gen. Miles has directed the immediate distribution of ammunition for the modern high-power guns here.

1898-02-21T00:00:00Z,"-- Men with a scientific turn of mind have not been numerous as yet in the Klondike country, and therefore it is not strange that the meteorological information from that region is in most cases more exclamatory than exact. Still, thermometer readings that extended over considerable periods of time have been taken and recorded there, and they probably give a good idea of the climate's eccentricities in the land of ice and gold."
1898-02-21T00:00:00Z,"The article in to-day's TIMES on the late disaster to the Maine, signed ""Martin,"" is as sensible as it is timely, and represents doubtless the views of thinking, responsible Americans. If the explosion on the Maine did not result from an internal cause, but an external one, the most natural question to ask is, Who could possibly profit by such a crime? Only the insurgent Cubans or their abettors here, the jingoes and silverites."
1898-02-21T00:00:00Z,"WASHINGTON, Feb. 20. -- It appears that the comment of Capt. Sobral on the Maine disaster, supposed to be that of an official of the Spanish Legation, was simply the comment of an unofficial person. Capt. Sobral ceased to be the naval attache of the Spanish Legation about four weeks ago."
1898-02-21T00:00:00Z,"ALBANY, Feb. 20. -- The resentment harbored by certain Senators against Gov. Black for his interference in legislative matters, which was voiced by Mr. Brackett in his speech on the biennial sessions amendment last week, has served to direct attention to the fact that practically every measure of general importance that has any chance of getting through the present Legislature has been directly inspired, and is being actively supported by the Governor."
1898-02-21T00:00:00Z,In fulfillment of its promise to keep a close watch on the Legislature and to report periodically on the local measures introduced the committee appointed by the City Club gave out yesterday this statement:

1898-02-21T00:00:00Z,"Rain, dreary and wet, fell persistently and wettingly all day yesterday as on Saturday, and the east wind played a doleful accompaniment to its pattering on roofs and window panes, and to the eternal drip, drip, dripping. A rainy day in February, it was, too, of the kind that makes a warm hearth warmer and a cheerful blaze a thing to hug, their absence a chilling thing, to penetrate the marrow."
1898-02-21T00:00:00Z,"The eighth annual Sunday service of the New York Society of the Sons of the Revolution commemorative of the birth of George Washington was held yesterday afternoon at Calvary Protestant Episcopal Church, Twenty-first Street and Fourth Avenue.

But, strange as it may seem, many men and women, by adopting the right means, have been able to overcome dangerous ailments that would have killed the strongest man."

1898-02-22T00:00:00Z,New York farmers evidently stand much in need of elementary instruction on the subject of good roads.

1898-03-27T00:00:00Z,Undoubtedly the indictment of nine Brooklyn officials for conspiracy to defraud the city is not without some political motive.

1898-04-03T00:00:00Z,"One hundred years ago the United States was as near war with France as it is today with Spain.

Something of this temporary quiet is to be attributed to the resting of the two houses of Congress."
1898-04-09T00:00:00Z,"-- Many impulsive people, and some whose usual practice it is to think before they speak, have made frequent reference of late to a bombardment of Havana as a convenient and feasible expedient for emphasizing American views in regard to whatever fact or policy happened to be under discussion."

1898-04-09T00:00:00Z,"M. Andre Lebon is especially well equipped to undertake the preparation of a manual of modern French history. From his intimate relations to the Meline Cabinet as Minister for the Colonies he had access to many documents unavailable to most writer's, and his professorship at the Ecole des Sciences Politiques all worked together to assist him in gathering material and to render him rather more impartial than can be said of some others."

1898-04-09T00:00:00Z,"I have read with interest the several communications on ""Quo Vadis,"" ""Nero,"" , in THE TIMES'S SATURDAY REVIEW of March 26. They leave practically untouched the conclusion I reached in my article printed by you March 19, that Tacitus XV. 44 is the only contemporary, or approximately contemporary, authority for the atrocities now under consideration, so luridly used in ""Quo Vadis."" So far as I know no other first century historian has recorded them."

The very small number of paintings shown and their exceptional quality indicate a rigid exclusion of the second best, and the amount of variety achieved without departure from the characteristic spirit of the painter's work is quite remarkable."

It is intersected with canals and waterways called variously sangrias, acequias, requerias, with norias or water wheels for distributing that liquid gold which water is to a thirsty, sun-burned red earth. The careful agriculturists manure this ground with guano, and it gratefully gives them back five crops a year."

1898-05-21T00:00:00Z,"Look for a moment at the American side of the question. Our own empire may go to war at any moment upon a trade question. The exports of the United States to Cuba in 1892 were between $15,000,000 and $16,000,000, and in 1896 they had sunk to $7,500,000, while there is the additional fact that under a rational system of government the island would furnish an enormous market for American goods."

1898-05-21T00:00:00Z,"Hitherto it has been supposed that ours was the only Government owning a type of war vessel capable of diving. Though the records of foreign invention are silent, the late doings of the Spanish fleet apparently demonstrate that the ingenuity of that nation has anticipated our own. Furthermore, the submarine ability in question seems to be confined to no particular class of vessels, cruisers, battleships, torpedo boats, and destroyers, all alike sharing in it."

Havemeyer makes in regard to what our flag represents, it does stand ""for all that makes our country dear and honored."" That is, it stands for all that is true and just: and this only is the reason that it inspires American patriotism and the respect of foreign nations."
1898-05-21T00:00:00Z,"Although the harbor patrol fleet is composed of a limited number of vessels, these vessels, by reason of the presence of loaded guns mounted on their bows, and the fact that they are manned by regulars of the navy who are known to ""mean business,"" are making their presence felt, and are succeeding admirably in keeping the mine fields clear."
1898-05-21T00:00:00Z,"Mr. Harry Walters, President of the Atlantic Coast Line, was at his desk in his office in the Chamber of Commerce yesterday, having just returned from Europe.

1898-05-21T00:00:00Z,"-- There have been innumerable discussions among doctors, and not a few among laymen, as to whether the former have the right in any circumstances to bestow upon a patient the priceless boon of euthanasia. The decision, probably, has been adverse oftener than favorable to the granting of discretionary power so open to frightful abuse even to a class of men in whose high intentions and conscientiousness the public has almost perfect confidence."
1898-05-21T00:00:00Z,"It is now reasonably certain that the Spanish squadron is in the harbor of Santiago de Cuba. It is certain that Spain desires America to believe so.

1898-05-21T00:00:00Z,"There are two features of the revenue bill as reported by the Senate Finance Committee that arouse a great deal of determined opposition throughout the country. One is the tax of one-forty-eighth per cent. per month, equal to one-quarter per cent. per year on the deposits of banks, and the other is the general tax of the same amount on the gross receipts of corporations."

Owing to the great number of shells thrown, it was thought the supply of powder, shot, and shell might not prove equal to any pressing demand made upon it."

1898-06-12T00:00:00Z,"In any future conflict between Great Britain and Russia finance will be quite as important a factor as armaments. The issue will not be decided by the first shock of arms, but by the slow, wearing financial strain to follow.

This presents the question as to what will be done with them."
1898-06-12T00:00:00Z,"This war is a wonderful object lesson to European nations in many ways. But more than all it teaches them as nothing else can certain latent elements of American character.

Whether in Marseilles, in Nice, Monaco, Vintimille, or Genoa, you are no sooner down one hill than you begin to climb the next; and the outlying mountains are not beautifully green like ours, but bare, cream-colored rock."
1898-06-12T00:00:00Z,"It will be a singular coincidence if the United States shall accomplish in 1898 what the mother country did in 1762 -- capture both Manila and Havana, Spanish possessions at the antipodes of each other, within the same year.
