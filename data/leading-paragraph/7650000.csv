It is now one of 10 properties owned by the society. The ball is in honor of the coaching clubs. The festivities begin with an informal cocktail party at the Breakers stable given by Vanderbilt descendants.

Coaching was championed in America by Alfred Gwynne Vanderbilt, and the museum is dedicated to his successes in the sport. On Saturday, the public was invited to a show of coaches, bottom.

2012-08-26T00:00:00Z,"Parents who want to stimulate their children's brain development often focus on things like early reading, flashcards and language tapes. But a growing body of research suggests that playing certain kinds of childhood games may be the best way to increase a child's ability to do well in school. Variations on games like Freeze Tag and Simon Says require relatively high levels of executive function, testing a child's ability to pay attention, remember rules and exhibit self-control -- qualities that also predict academic success. ''Play is one of the most cognitively stimulating things a child can do,'' says Megan McClelland, an early-childhood-development researcher at Oregon State University who has led much of the research."

2012-08-26T00:00:00Z,"AN iconic penthouse with sophisticated steamed-beech-dominated interiors by Charles Gwathmey and sweeping views of Central Park from its perch at the Verona, a landmark Upper East Side co-op designed by William E. Mowbray in 1908, sold under the radar for $21 million, the biggest sale of the week according to city records. The seller, Jonathan S. Sobel, had not intended to leave the apartment, which he bought in 2002 expressly for the masterly Gwathmey Siegel renovation done for the previous owners, Charles and Brenda Koppelman. But after receiving a letter from Roger Erickson, a Sotheby's International Realty broker with clients at the Verona who wanted a larger apartment there, he and his wife, Marcia Dunn, decided to sell. They set the price at $21 million. After Mr. Erickson's intended clients elected not to buy, he contacted another longtime client, Stephen J. Meringoff, the commercial real estate investor , who bought the apartment."

2012-08-26T00:00:00Z,"WHETHER or not it's in fashion, the baseball cap has been a mainstay of American outfitting since its arrival in the 1940s. But lately, it seems to be spending less time on the diamond and more time on the street, the beach and the New York social scene (a reaction to the baseball uniform's influence on the spring 2013 men's collections, maybe). Note taken: Baseball caps are all that. And they look especially fresh on women wearing relaxed dresses, skirts and sweatshirts. At the Veuve Clicquot Polo Classic, the model Dree Hemingway tomboy-ed an all-white lace look with a Yankees hat. The singer Rihanna topped slouchy jeans with a brightly colored two-toned ball cap. And on vacation in Florida, the singer Gwen Stefani paired her printed skirt and bikini with a hat that could easily belong to her hubby, Gavin Rossdale. Inspired by the way these three women wore their caps, T picked a few that come from everywhere (the boyfriend's closet, Barneys) and look as ready for fashion's major league as any accessory out there.

She became the first black gymnast -- and only the fourth American -- to win a gold medal in that event. In ''OPRAH'S NEXT CHAPTER,'' Sunday at 8:30 p.m. on OWN, Oprah Winfrey interviews Ms. Douglas at her gym in West Des Moines, Iowa, where she moved from Virginia Beach at 14 to train with Liang Chow, who had coached Shawn Johnson to a gold.

Ms. Kourlas rather inexplicably concludes that ''there seems to be more attention focused on raising the profile of the Bessies than on artistic achievement.'' The committee was increased to 41 members from 15, so there are more eyes looking at more dance. The members work in subcommittees, so there can be more rigorous considerations of specific areas of dance. The result is that artistic achievement is more central. Clearly, raising the Bessies' profile ensures the artistic achievement recognized gets broader visibility."

Whether people praise or condemn or just keep writing about you . . . there's still an itch being scratched there. Marnell wrote, ''Why does a person have to have resolved their drug issues in order to be allowed to write about them?'' which is a totally fair question. She doesn't have to have resolved anything to write whatever she wants to. But it changes how we read her story, and how we feel about doing so. posted on The Atlantic Wire"

(Sundance) DOMINO (2005) The Sundance Channel pays tribute to the director Tony Scott, who died last Sunday, with his biopic about Domino Harvey (played by Keira Knightley, above), the privileged daughter of a jet-setting mother and the British actor Laurence Harvey who became a bounty hunter in South Central Los Angeles. Writing in The New York Times, Manohla Dargis called this action adventure, whose ensemble cast features Mickey Rourke, Christopher Walken, Delroy Lindo, Jacqueline Bisset, Dabney Coleman and Mo'Nique, ''a lollapalooza of delectable cheap thrills.'' What makes it ''the ultimate Tony Scott movie -- or as a friend put it, 'It's all the Tony Scott you could possibly want in a Tony Scott movie!' -- is its uncharacteristically sharp screenplay,'' she said of its script by Richard Kelly. ''Mr. Scott has worked with talented writers before, but this is the first time he has shot a film written by a screenwriter who both cops to the great enjoyment that can be had from the modern action movie -- perhaps best illustrated here by the sight of Ms. Knightley unloading two machine guns at once -- and blows the action-movie tropes to smithereens.'' 9 A.M.

Twenty years ago, the Democrat-turned-Republican Phil Gramm had that job. Warning to Governor Christie: no one remembers anything Mr. Gramm said. What we do remember from the 1992 convention in Houston is the jeremiad delivered by Patrick J. Buchanan, the former speechwriter for Richard M. Nixon who won nearly a quarter of Republican primary votes that year. With his invocation of a ""cultural war"" for the ""soul of America,"" Mr. Buchanan brought down the house. His fulminations against abortion, homosexuality and other hot-button ""cultural"" issues exceeded tolerable political rhetoric and likely hurt President George Bush in the general election. But Mr. Buchanan nonetheless set the tone for the Clinton years, and ""culture war"" became shorthand for the battle between Red and Blue in the 1990s."

2012-08-26T00:00:00Z,"THESE early mornings in late August already taste of the coming autumn, so perhaps it's only right to point out that this is the last chance to see some plants of summer that will vanish very soon. ''ELLSWORTH KELLY PLANT DRAWINGS,'' at the Metropolitan Museum of Art, closes Sept. 3, and it's an oasis of austere pleasures worth escaping to one more time. Mr. Kelly, who is 89, is revered for his abstract paintings and sculptures, but he has called his plant drawings ''a kind of bridge to a way of seeing that was the basis of the very first abstract paintings.'' The exhibition features 80 works, the earliest dating to 1948, and is the first major museum show dedicated exclusively to his drawings of plants, flowers and leaves. Whether using watercolor, graphite or ink, Mr. Kelly pares his plants to their elegant and essential lines -- sometimes straining toward a kind of plain abstraction -- but in the end they are all plant, all Kelly.

2012-08-26T00:00:00Z,"SICCARDI--Arthur P.,III (September 4, 1955 - August 9, 2012) was a devoted and loving son to Artie Siccardi, brother to Drew and Drew's wife Lori, proud uncle of Melanie and Cody, and nephew of Jean Mandel and Gail and Ray Buttenbaum. He was a loyal friend to Beverly Deutsch and many other lucky people in Tupper Lake, Basking Ridge, NJ, and New York City. A graduate of Paramus High and Wheeling College, in 1983 he received a Master's in Social Work from Columbia University after which he began work at the Somerset Hills Residential Treatment Center where for over 29 years he worked with boys 11 to 16 who faced severe emotional, behavioral and environmental challenges. Arthur was passionate about food, the Adirondacks, gardening, and theatre. He was a great cook and began his love affair with food by learning from his mother, Jane Siccardi, and his maternal grandparents, Rudy and Jeanette Waller. Rudy owned one of the last small butcher shops in Cliffside Park, New Jersey and his home was filled with good cooking for his family and friends. Arthur carried on the tradition and would even special order arugula at the supermarket in the Adirondacks for his dinners with friends this before it was commonly available. As for the Adirondacks, from the age of ten, he spent part of every summer up at Tupper Lake and was never happier than sitting on his deck reading a book, working on his tan, contemplating planting his flowers, and enjoying the magnificent sunsets. His other love, theatre, he was able to indulge by working for his father at the Eugene O'Neill Theatre on Broadway as a stagehand and visiting his brother who is a stagehand at the New Amsterdam Theatre. He was an avid theatre goer and also introduced many of the boys he worked with to Broadway. He was full of good cheer, loved the simple pleasures of life such as attending Yankees and Giants games, and cared deeply for the people around him. His care and love for his step-mother, Susan MacNair, throughout her illness was memorable. He would want everyone to ""Live For Today"" as he did. Donations in his memory can be made to Broadway Cares/Equity Fights Aids, The American Cancer Society, or The Wild Center at Tupper Lake in his beloved Adirondacks. A memorial service is being planned."

Alone, but with others, you may share the same sights and feelings, but you can't communicate well. There are few ways to convey joy, amazement or thrill. How many divers know American Sign Language?

2012-08-26T00:00:00Z,"THE violinist JENNY SCHEINMAN favors music of expressive clarity and emotional intelligence, and she keeps her balance as a melodist even on tricky or unstable ground. At the Newport Jazz Festival a few weeks ago she appeared twice with one of her closest allies, the guitarist Bill Frisell: first as a part of his songbook tribute to John Lennon and then in a sparsely beautiful duo set as rooted in folk and country-western as it was in chamberesque modern jazz. Those stylistic parameters apply to most of Ms. Scheinman's work, though she manages to keep them pliable. During an engagement early this year at the Village Vanguard she led the jazz-rockish band from her self-released album ''Mischief & Mayhem,'' shrewdly courting turbulence. On Tuesday she returns to the club with a fundamentally different group, featuring the pianist Jason Moran, the bassist Greg Cohen and the drummer Rudy Royston -- a slippery postbop quartet, but also a conduit for strong lyricism, rustic texture and a watchful sort of grace.

This Monday the lineup includes a meeting of the minds of two terrifically individual and improvisationally minded artists: the choreographer-dancer Sally Silvers, a frequent presence in the space, and the composer and trombonist Jim Staley, the producer behind Roulette, which has just about reached a year in its new digs.

2012-08-27T00:00:00Z,"WARNER--Robert M.,passed away on August 25 at age 91, leaving behind a large and loving family, many deep friendships, a distinguished and long career in retailing and a legacy rich in stories, passions and interests. Bob was born in Newark, New Jersey on December 23, 1920, the third of four boys, Oscar, Al and Lew, who were extremely close throughout their lives. He graduated from the University of Michigan in 1943 where he served as the student director of Hillel. The University of Michigan became a recurring theme in his life, eventually connecting him to friends, relatives, grandchildren, colleagues, and most of all, to his wife, Marcia. After serving in the Navy during World War II, he entered Harvard Business School where he thrived intellectually and found his calling in management. He graduated in 1948 as a Baker Scholar, the highest academic honor at the school. The school became an important bond; he participated in its executive seminars, encouraged his sons and others to study there and became an enthusiastic evangelist for the school. He joined Macy's training squad after graduation and that launched a distinguished career in retailing, which lasted until his death. At Macy's for 23 years, he rose to lead merchandising for home furnishings and then became the general manager of the Herald Square store, the world's largest store. Following Macy's he held senior positions at Korvette's, KG Retail and Steinbach's and then consulted for many retailers. He married Marcia Lipsett on March 12,1950 in her hometown of Jamestown, NY. Their loving and supportive relationship was his proudest accomplishment and he toasted that at all family events. He was extremely proud and close to his children, Jim, Betsy and Steve, his daughters-in law, Priscilla and Jennifer, and his grandchildren, Max, Jack, Caroline, Elliot and Mallory. Bob will be best remembered for his vigorous passions and friendships. He started jogging before the term was invented, skied into his mid-80's, led sailing expeditions in the Long Island Sound and Maine, played tennis and swam throughout the year into his 90's. He was able to complete a mile swim at age 90 at Beach Point Club, another one of his beloved institutions. He leaves behind lifelong friendships across generations including waiters at Camp Onibar, students at Michigan and HBS, business colleagues, high school students that he mentored, friends of his children and children of his friends, tennis partners and members of the Friday lunch group that he founded at Beach Point. His warmth, outgoing and engaging nature, curiosity, humility, generosity and devotion will always be remembered and will serve as a role model for generations. The funeral service will be held today at 12 Noon at Larchmont Temple, 75 Larchmont Avenue, Larchmont, NY. The family will sit Shiva at 1015 Nautilus Lane, Mamaroneck, NY, today through Thursday from 6pm-8pm with minyan services at 7:30pm.

2012-08-28T00:00:00Z,"JOHNSON--William Oscar, Jr.,81, journalist, author and artist, died in New York on June 21 of cardiac arrest. His lifelong career in journalism began in 1957 at the Danbury News-Times in Connecticut, a job chosen by a flip of a coin after resumes sent to a hundred papers around the country resulted in two offers, one from Danbury, the other from Monterey, CA. Later stints as a radio news broadcaster in Baltimore and as a reporter at the Minneapolis Tribune led, thanks to a strike at the Tribune, to TIME, where he wrote for the magazine's Nation section, including cover stories on the Kennedy assassination, the Warren Report, Lady Bird Johnson and Gov. Ronald Reagan. In 1967 Johnson joined Sports Illustrated as a senior writer and covered nine summer and winter Olympics, traveled to China in 1973 with the U.S. basketball team as one of the earliest foreign journalists allowed in that country, and to the USSR twice for profiles of the great Georgian weightlifter Vasily Alekseyev. In addition he covered the triumphs, and, more often, the tribulations of the U.S. ski team, and, thanks to his skills on deadline, occasional fast-breaking news stories when disaster struck in the world of sport, such as a ski lift collapse in Colorado or the disqualification for use of performing enhancing drugs of Canadian sprinter Ben Johnson at the Seoul Olympics in 1988. Johnson won the 100 on Sunday, was disqualified on Monday (SI's closing day) and when the issue appeared, Johnson was on the cover under one word--BUSTED! As an author Johnson (William Oscar, Jr.) wrote everything from thrillers (The Zero Factor, Hammered Gold) to history (All That Glitters Is Not Gold and The Olympics: A History of the Games) to biography (Whatta Gal: The Babe Didrickson Story, Thrown Free: Wolfgang Schmidt, Vail: Triumph of a Dream, about Vail's founder Pete Seibert). From childhood on Johnson liked to draw. A career that began with cartoons in his high school paper evolved into a college comic strip about a nerd named ""Arnold"" which was syndicated for a time in 225 newspapers. Later, inspired by many Cape Cod summers and a pamphlet on the history of the U.S. Lifesaving Service, a precursor of the Coast Guard, he began a series of paintings based loosely and sometimes whimsically on old black and white photographs in the pamphlet. His paintings were shown at several Cape galleries, including the Schoolhouse Gallery in Provincetown. He played a mean ukulele and accompanied many family sing-alongs on the piano. He loved politics, a strong drink and a good laugh--and was a proud and devoted father and grandfather. He is survived by his wife Ruth, daughter Kristina, sons William III and Thomas, and five grandchildren. A memorial is scheduled for October in New York."

Researchers writing online last week in The International Journal of Obesity studied 11,532 English children born at normal weight in 1991 and 1992. Controlling for birth weight, parental body mass index, breast-feeding and other factors, they found that infants given antibiotics within six months of birth were 22 percent more likely than those given none to be overweight at age 3 . Among those given antibiotics between 6 and 14 months, there was no link to body mass in childhood, but exposure from 15 to 23 months was linked to higher body mass index at age 7."

2012-08-28T00:00:00Z,"8:30 P.M. (TV5Monde) L'ANNÉE DERNIÈRE À MARIENBAD (1962) Reality and fiction blur in this psychological drama from the French director Alain Resnais, set in a Bohemian chateau where all noise beyond a few whispered words is forbidden, as a man (Giorgio Albertazzi, above with Delphine Seyrig) tries to persuade a woman (Ms. Seyrig) that they had an affair the previous year. She insists they have never met. Mr. Resnais, who was associated with the New Wave though he didn't fully embrace the movement, won the Golden Lion at the Venice Film Festival for the movie; the writer Alain Robbe-Grillet received an Academy Award nomination for best screenplay. Bosley Crowther called the film, whose title is translated as ''Last Year at Marienbad,'' ''truly extraordinary'' in his review in The New York Times. ''It may grip you with a strange enchantment, it may twist your wits into a snarl, it may leave your mind and senses toddling vaguely in the regions in between,'' he wrote. ''But this we can reasonably promise: when you stagger away from it, you will feel you have delighted in (or suffered) a unique and intense experience.'' 3:45 P.M. (HBO Signature) BEGINNERS (2011) Christopher Plummer, below, in an Oscar-winning role, plays Hal, the septuagenarian father of Oliver (Ewan McGregor), for whom he has two announcements: that he is gay and that he has terminal cancer. This film from the writer and director Mike Mills weaves together two love stories, one past and one present, that gradually fuse into a single life. Goran Visnjic plays Hal's much younger partner; Mélanie Laurent is the French actress who sweeps Oliver away from his misery; and a scene-stealing Cosmo is Arthur, Hal's Jack Russell terrier. ''So much of 'Beginners' seems, looks, sounds, feels so hermetically perfect you may long for some air to blow, stir and even mess up its bright Los Angeles homes, the swanky old hotel where Anna stays and all these precious moments,'' Manohla Dargis wrote in The Times. ''Even so, the movie's attractions are undeniable, including its narrative design, which seems more complex than it is, but is engaging to piece together. And the performers are charming, particularly Ms. Laurent and Mr. Plummer, with his killer eyes (still seducing after all these years) and a voice that echoes in your ears.''"

But on Tuesday morning out on Court 13, she may have played her final match at the Open. Date-Krumm, one of Japan's greatest players, lost to Sofia Arvidsson of Sweden, 6-4, 6-2. It was a disappointing outcome, to be sure, but considering Date-Krumm was exactly 41 years 11 months old Tuesday, it was good that the match lasted only 1 hour 6 minutes."

2012-08-29T00:00:00Z,"Like busmen, critics often have job-related holidays, leisure time activities that feed into, spill over from -- and, with luck, provide respite from -- more diligent pursuits in their supposed areas of expertise. One of mine comes remarkably close. In summer I like to browse yard sales, thrift shops and, lately, flea markets, looking for paintings that speak to me. If the price is right (it usually is), I buy them and take them home. This relatively relaxed form of art viewing often bears out something a friend told me Picasso once said: that any painting contains something worth looking at. From my experience, this may be a somewhat optimistic assessment, but ferreting out the worthy bits in anonymous paintings is great and often instructive fun. And the idea that every time someone applies malleable color to a small rectangular surface, there will be at least one revealing point of contact is cause for optimism. In the same way, I suppose, many poems written by amateurs have one memorable phrase or metaphor."

2012-08-29T00:00:00Z,"8:15 P.M. (Cinemax) UNSTOPPABLE (2010) Denzel Washington, in his fifth collaboration with the director Tony Scott, who died on Aug. 19, plays Frank Barnes, a veteran engineer trying to stop a runaway train speeding through Pennsylvania with a load of hazardous cargo. Chris Pine, above left with Mr. Washington, is Will Colson, the hotheaded new conductor Frank is charged with training. Writing in The New York Times, Manohla Dargis said that Mr. Scott, working with the cinematographer Ben Seresin and some ace sound technicians, ''creates an unexpectedly rich world of chugging, rushing trains slicing across equally beautiful industrial and natural landscapes,'' adding, ''There is something mesmerizing about these trains and the men who run them, something nostalgic too, because they seem like history machines, summoning up a past lived and also imagined, as in, for starters, 'The Great Train Robbery' (1903), 'North by Northwest' (1959) and 'Speed' (1994).' '' Alas, she said, '' 'Unstoppable' doesn't belong in that company: its story is largely forgettable, and its pleasures are transitory, limited to the actors (including Rosario Dawson and Kevin Corrigan, working up a sweat back in dispatch) and to its moments of beauty and strange comedy.'' 6:45 A.M. (HBO Signature) CRIMES AND MISDEMEANORS (1989) When the mistress (Anjelica Huston) of a Manhattan ophthalmologist, Judah Rosenthal (Martin Landau, in an Oscar-nominated performance), threatens to go public with their affair and his unethical financial dealings, he has his brother (Jerry Orbach), who has mob connections, set up her killing. Woody Allen received nominations for best director and best screenplay for this film, in which he plays Cliff Stern, a married documentarian infatuated with another woman (Mia Farrow). Sam Waterston is Judah's best friend, a rabbi; Alan Alda is a TV producer and Cliff's brother-in-law. ''The wonder of 'Crimes and Misdemeanors' is the facility with which Mr. Allen deals with so many interlocking stories of so many differing tones and voices,'' Vincent Canby wrote in The Times. ''The film cuts back and forth between parallel incidents and between present and past with the effortlessness of a hip, contemporary Aesop.''"

2012-08-30T00:00:00Z,"3:45 P.M. (Showtime) CHARLIE BARTLETT (2008) After being kicked out of private school for making fake IDs, Charlie (Anton Yelchin) goes the public route, arriving at a high school in a chauffeured limousine, wearing a navy blazer with Latin insignia and toting a fancy briefcase. An instant pariah, he discovers a road to popularity paved with drugs -- of the prescription variety. Soon he has become a sort of therapist, dispensing advice and medication to classmates. Hope Davis plays his flaky, depressed mother; Robert Downey Jr. is the high school's alcoholic principal, whose relationship with Charlie turns into warfare once he learns that Charlie is dating his rebellious daughter (Kat Dennings, above with Mr. Yelchin). ''In the movie's funniest scene Charlie and his business partner Murphy, the school bully who beat him up and dunked his head in the toilet when he first arrived, dispense Ritalin to the students and turn a dance into a frenzied free-for-all with bare-breasted girls running down the halls,'' Stephen Holden wrote in The New York Times. ''The movie, directed by Jon Poll from a screenplay by Gustin Nash, is never more amusingly subversive than in this scene, which suggests the hypocrisy of American attitudes toward drugs without putting it in words.'' Still, he said, ''as the movie dashes from one base to the next, it never coalesces into the character-driven, serious comedy with heart that you want it be.'' 12:45 P.M. (HBO) IN AMERICA (2003) Johnny (Paddy Considine), an Irish actor, and his wife, Sarah (Samantha Morton, who received an Oscar nomination for best actress), try to start over in New York after the death of their young son in this modest but sincere drama from Jim Sheridan. Djimon Hounsou (nominated for best supporting actor) is Mateo, a reclusive painter dying of what seems to be AIDS who is befriended by Johnny and Sarah's daughters (Emma and Sarah Bolger, above). Mr. Sheridan (''My Left Foot'') wrote the film with his own two daughters; the three were nominated for best original screenplay. ''This movie, from moment to moment, feels small, almost anecdotal,'' A. O. Scott wrote in The Times. ''It is only afterward that, like Mr. Sheridan's other films, it starts to grow into something at once unassuming and in its own way grand.''"

2012-08-30T00:00:00Z,"A year ago, we told you about a dilemma facing Red Iguana , a family-owned Mexican restaurant in Salt Lake City. Its owners, Lucy Cardenas and Bill Coker, were facing a two-pronged problem with their first location. First, a happy problem: their restaurant had gotten so popular after appearing on the Food Network's "" Diners, Drive-ins and Dives "" that customers regularly had to wait an hour to be seated. At the same time, the city was about to build a light rail line down the middle of the restaurant's street, a project that had the potential to force the business to close for several weeks. To ease the customer wait and protect themselves from downtime, there was little doubt that Red Iguana's owners needed a second location. But the way they decided to expand was somewhat surprising. Ms. Cardenas and Mr. Coker decided to open a second location with the same name and menu just two blocks from their first, a plan that went against conventional wisdom and was rejected by most of the experts we consulted at the time of our original article."

Sorry, fans of Brother Voodoo and Ego the Living Planet , but today is not your day. Instead, Mr. Whedon, the creator of ""Buffy the Vampire Slayer,"" is working on turf more familiar to ""Avengers"" viewers and preparing a series based on S.H.I.E.L.D., the Marvel Comics espionage agency run by Nick Fury. The Hollywood Reporter said that ABC has ordered a pilot of ""S.H.I.E.L.D.,"" which Mr. Whedon will write with his brother Jed Whedon, and Jed's wife, Maurissa Tancharoen, his collaborators on the online musical ""Dr. Horrible's Sing-Along Blog.""

The colors range from brilliant blues and reds to vibrant greens and yellows, not to mention royal purple. The sudden appearance of the pigeons of St. Mark's--considered so much a public nuisance that the local government made it illegal to feed them in 2008--in something other than the standard gray seems to have delighted the tourists.

2012-08-30T00:00:00Z,"In 1911, her marriage in tatters, Edith Wharton sailed to Europe, where she remained for the rest of her life. Ahead were many productive years of novel writing and a Pulitzer Prize. Behind was the Mount, her country estate in western Massachusetts, to which she applied her formidable design skills. Wharton was no dilettante. In 1897, she and the architect Ogden Codman, who had worked on her homes in New York and Newport, R.I., published ''The Decoration of Houses,'' a book that railed against the decorative excesses of the Gilded Age and called for a return to classical principles like symmetry. Wharton was championing nothing less than an American Renaissance, said Richard Guy Wilson, an architectural historian at the University of Virginia and the author of ''Edith Wharton at Home: Life at the Mount,'' out next week from Monacelli Press ($45). The book, which is illustrated with archival and recent photos of the estate (it currently serves as a cultural center, attracting 30,000 visitors a year), marks the 150th anniversary of Wharton's birth and the 100th anniversary of the year the Mount officially left her hands."

2012-08-30T00:00:00Z,"ASPES--Ted, 66, died at home in Atlanta, GA on Wednesday, August 29 after a valiant fight against brain cancer. He was surrounded by his adoring family; wife Judy, his love of 43 years, son Adam and wife Wendi of Atlanta, and son Jason of Singapore. Ted grew up in Brooklyn, New York, the son of the late Minnie and Abraham Aspes. He earned both his BA and DDS degrees at the State University of New York at Buffalo, and it was there that he met Judy. Following dental school, he served as a Captain in the Air Force at Moody Air Force Base in Valdosta, GA. He did a residency in Pediatric Dentistry at the Medical College of Georgia School of Dentistry in Augusta. In 1975 he moved to Atlanta, and established his practice in Smyrna, GA, where he worked for over 33 years. Though best known for Julia Roberts' smile, he treated many thousands of patients during his career and was honored to be treating the children of many of his former patients. His manner was calm, kind and assuring and he made sure that going to his office was always fun. He hand crafted one-of-a-kind wooden marble mazes that enthralled his patients, as well as their parents. Though Ted was a sports fan, he always preferred playing to watching. He played tennis, golf, softball, water volleyball and ran twenty plus consecutive Peachtree Road Races. Ted never forgot his working class Brooklyn roots and took pride in caring for his yard and tinkering until he found (sometimes unorthodox) ways to solve a problem. He believed in hard work and a positive attitude and that was never more apparent than throughout his illness. Through many complications and difficulties he persevered, maintained hope and always had a smile on his face. Of all his many accomplishments, he was most proud of his family. They watched in awe as his optimistic attitude prevailed for almost four years. In addition to Judy, Adam, Wendi and Jason, he is survived by his sister, Lila Holdridge of California, Jason's wife, Susie, and grandsons Asher, Levi and Shai of Singapore, grandson Hudson and granddaughter Maya of Atlanta. They were the sunshine in his life. The body was cremated and a memorial service will be held at Temple Sinai, 5645 Dupree Drive on Friday, August 31st at 2:30pm. The family requests that donations in Ted's memory be made to The Preston Robert Tisch Brain Tumor Center at Duke, c/o Ellen Stainback, DUMC Box 3624, Durham, NC 27710.

2012-08-31T00:00:00Z,"FONDARAS--Elizabeth, died peacefully at home in New York City on August 29, 2012. Elizabeth Fondaras, a widely beloved and admired personality both in France and in her native America, dedicated decades of her life to supporting and expanding the relations between France and the United States through her personal initiatives and by generously lending her support to organizations with the same goal. In light of this longstanding work, she was named Chevalier of the Legion d'Honneur in 1989 and Officier in 2002. In 2009, President Francois Sarkozy named her Commandeur of the Legion d'Honneur. She was born Elizabeth Temple Robertson in Boston, on March 19, 1916, a descendant of an old Virginia family. After the death of her first husband, Charles E. Miller, she moved to Paris and made that city her home for ten years. In France, she married Theodore Weicker, Jr. of the Squibb pharmaceutical family. The strong friendships she made in France and her love for that country were to shape one of her life's principal objectives --to bring about better understanding between France and the United States. In the early fifties, Mrs. Fondaras established the Elizabeth R. Miller Traveling Scholarship, a highly successful program that brought ten talented young French surgeons to work in outstanding American Hospitals. In 1956, she founded the Elizabeth R. Miller Scholarship for St. Paul's School in Concord, New Hampshire, a program that still endures as The Elizabeth R. Weicker Scholarship for St. Paul's School. Over the fifty-year course of this program, she has supported the education at St. Paul's School of close to 100 French boys and girls, many of whom have gone on to become prominent professionals in France. In 1971, Mrs. Fondaras married Anastassios Fondaras (deceased June 1999), a retired Commander in the Royal Greek Navy and former managing director for Stavros Niarchos. The couple settled in New York, keeping a pied a terre on the Ile St. Louis in Paris. In 1972, the State Department recognized her with a Tribute of Appreciation saying .... Her personal initiative is in keeping with the finest traditions of Franco-American friendship. At the time of her death, her ties to France were as strong as ever, as she continued to her work with and active support of, the Pasteur Foundation for which she had been the founding Chairman of its American Advisory Board since 1989. Her work also included service as the Vice-Chairman of the French American Foundation. In addition to the Legion d'Honneur, Mrs. Fondaras also received the Medal of the Center for French Civilization and Culture and served as Chairman of the Advisory Board of La Maison Francaise of New York University. She has served on many boards including those of St. Paul's School, the American Friends of Blerancourt, the Institute of International Education, the Children's Storefront School in Harlem and the Foreign Policy Association. Mrs. Fondaras' ever-present warmth, charm, strength of purpose and generosity of spirit will be sorely missed by her large circle of friends at home and abroad. She is survived by a loving family of stepchildren and step-grandchildren, including Theodore Weicker of Palo Alto, California, Tara Lamont of Rio de Janiero, Brazil and Antonia Fondaras of Washington, D.C. The funeral service will be held on Saturday September 1st at 11:00am at St. Luke's Church, 18 James Lane, East Hampton. A memorial service to be held in New York City will be announced at a later date. In lieu of flowers please send contributions either to the French American Foundation, 28 West 44th Street, Suite 1420, New York, NY 10036 or Pasteur Foundation, 420 Lexington Avenue, Suite 1654, New York, New York 10170."

2012-08-31T00:00:00Z,"The N.F.L. and the players union agreed Thursday to a change to the injured reserve rules and a move of the trade deadline that owners first approved in the spring. The new injured reserve rule will allow teams to bring back one player during the season if that player was put on injured reserve during the regular season. The player must have sustained a ""major"" injury - defined as missing at least six weeks. The player would have to be designated as eligible to return when he is placed on injured reserve. He can return to practice after six weeks and can be activated after eight weeks. That could be an important switch for players like Steelers guard David DeCastro, who injured his knee during the preseason. Under the old rules, any player put on injured reserve was out for the season, but DeCastro and others could return late in the season and for the playoffs. All other players put on injured reserve during the season are out for the year."

The Consumerist recently riffed on a column in The Star-Ledger , which reported on Chipotle's practice of rounding the change in receipt totals for cash transactions at some restaurants. These locations do this so that cashiers don't have to handle lots of coins, which tends to slow the lines down. If you've ever been to Chipotle, you know that the food is dished out in assembly-line style, where you place your order and then walk along the counter, telling the staff that, yes, you'd like some guacamole, please, but hold the rice. You pay at the end of the line."

2012-09-01T00:00:00Z,"FONDARAS--Elizabeth, died peacefully at home in New York City on August 29, 2012. Elizabeth Fondaras, a widely beloved and admired personality both in France and in her native America, dedicated decades of her life to supporting and expanding the relations between France and the United States through her personal initiatives and by generously lending her support to organizations with the same goal. In light of this longstanding work, she was named Chevalier of the Legion d'Honneur in 1989 and Officier in 2002. In 2009, President Francois Sarkozy named her Commandeur of the Legion d'Honneur. She was born Elizabeth Temple Robertson in Boston, on March 18, 1916, a descendant of an old Virginia family. After the death of her first husband, Charles E. Miller, she moved to Paris and made that city her home for ten years. In France, she married Theodore Weicker, Jr. of the Squibb pharmaceutical family. The strong friendships she made in France and her love for that country were to shape one of her life's principal objectives --to bring about better understanding between France and the United States. In the early fifties, Mrs. Fondaras established the Elizabeth R. Miller Traveling Scholarship, a highly successful program that brought ten talented young French surgeons to work in outstanding American Hospitals. In 1956, she founded the Elizabeth R. Miller Scholarship for St. Paul's School in Concord, New Hampshire, a program that still endures as The Elizabeth R. Weicker Scholarship for St. Paul's School. Over the fifty-year course of this program, she has supported the education at St. Paul's School of close to 100 French boys and girls, many of whom have gone on to become prominent professionals in France. In 1971, Mrs. Fondaras married Anastassios Fondaras (deceased June 1999), a retired Commander in the Royal Greek Navy and former managing director for Stavros Niarchos. The couple settled in New York, keeping a pied a terre on the Ile St. Louis in Paris. In 1972, the State Department recognized her with a Tribute of Appreciation saying .... Her personal initiative is in keeping with the finest traditions of Franco-American friendship. At the time of her death, her ties to France were as strong as ever, as she continued to her work with and active support of, the Pasteur Foundation for which she had been the founding Chairman of its American Advisory Board since 1989. Her work also included service as the Vice-Chairman of the French American Foundation. In addition to the Legion d'Honneur, Mrs. Fondaras also received the Medal of the Center for French Civilization and Culture and served as Chairman of the Advisory Board of La Maison Francaise of New York University. She has served on many boards including those of St. Paul's School, the American Friends of Blerancourt, the Institute of International Education, the Children's Storefront School in Harlem and the Foreign Policy Association. Mrs. Fondaras' ever-present warmth, charm, strength of purpose and generosity of spirit will be sorely missed by her large circle of friends at home and abroad. She is survived by a loving family of stepchildren and step-grandchildren, including Theodore Weicker of Palo Alto, California, Tara Lamont of Rio de Janiero, Brazil and Antonia Fondaras of Washington, D.C. The funeral service will be held on Saturday September 1st at 11:00am at St. Luke's Church, 18 James Lane, East Hampton. A memorial service to be held in New York City will be announced at a later date. In lieu of flowers please send contributions either to the French American Foundation, 28 West 44th Street, Suite 1420, New York, NY 10036 or Pasteur Foundation, 420 Lexington Avenue, Suite 1654, New York, New York 10170."

2012-09-01T00:00:00Z,"8 P.M. (Showtime) OUR IDIOT BROTHER (2011) Ned, a sweet, goofy man-child played by Paul Rudd, above, trustingly sells a bag of weed to a police officer in a bohemian stretch of upstate New York and lands in jail. After he's released on parole, he goes home to find that his lady friend (Kathryn Hahn) has taken up with another hippie type and refuses to give up custody of Willie Nelson, their dog. So Ned heads to Brooklyn, crashing with each of his three sisters (Emily Mortimer, Zooey Deschanel and Elizabeth Banks) and upending their cosmopolitan routines in this comedy, directed by Jesse Peretz from a screenplay by Evgenia Peretz (his sister) and David Schisgall. ''Far too much in 'Our Idiot Brother' is much too easy, including the soft, sentimental indulgence it lavishes on Ned and the satirical barbs it flings at his sisters,'' A. O. Scott wrote in The New York Times. Still, he added, ''This dude, who had seemed at first glance to be a lesser Lebowski, content to tend his garden and smoke a few nice buds, turns out to be a curiously retrograde paladin: the reluctant scourge and benevolent protector of bossy, wayward and otherwise messed-up women. And for all its sweetness, this movie leaves behind the sour taste of unexamined male entitlement. However clever those sisters may be, they cannot do it for themselves. Even if he's an idiot, brother knows best.''

That tent also seems closed to socially progressive opinions rapidly gaining acceptance in America at-large. Abortion-rights supporters and environmentalists fall into the first category. Formerly well-represented within the G.O.P., they're now fringe. Gay-rights advocates fall into the latter category.

In it 40 choreographers and companies will take over the postage-stamp-size stage, producing works that last no longer than five minutes. But the Dancenow incubator now has a reputation for turning these numbers into full-fledged dances, as with Doug Elkins's '' Fräulein Maria .'' Robin Staff, the organization's executive artistic director and producer, said, ''Our attention has gone to inspiring the artists to think out of the box and create for Joe's.'' Still, the dancers aren't the only ones who must stay on their toes. After each show audience members vote on their favorites. On Sept. 15 a selection will be featured in an encore performance. Think of the festival as a surprise end-of-summer cocktail: you don't know what the twist will be, but the next ''Fräulein Maria'' could be waiting in the wings.

The best-known name is probably ATOMS FOR PEACE, a side project of Radiohead's lead singer, Thom Yorke; it's a disc-jockey set. Maria Minerva and Holy Other are equally promising prospects. Maria Minerva is an Estonian musician based in London. She builds her pieces from fuzzy, blurry, low-fi sounds, layering them like watercolor washes and adding her dreamy singsong voice. Holy Other creates ultra-slow-motion tracks; songs coalesce ever so gradually out of sustained ambient sounds. For more propulsive dance music the lineup also includes Rustie, from Scotland, who uses brittle electronic sounds and chopped-up vocals to dizzying effect, and the longtime house music D.J. and remixer Justin Strauss. 2 p.m. Saturday, 22-25 Jackson Avenue, at 46th Street, Long Island City; momaps1.org , $15."

His five children, who arranged the service, ended it with a New Orleans-style brass band procession, followed by the traditional second line. An unusual sight in Manhattan, it trailed the hearse bearing the coffin as it drove slowly around the church, returning to the front door, where nearly 300 mourners re-entered for a reception. Women were given black parasols and white handkerchiefs to wave as they danced along after the hearse. Dr. Sherman's son Caleb waved his father's guitar in the parade.

My issue is not with editors at all. In documentaries, editors are the unsung heroes. They structure stories and testimony, focus themes and arrange images in visual schemes that carry the emotional and narrative momentum of the films. The credit of the editor in documentaries should be exalted. My issue is with the documentary writing credit which, in the documentary, is sometimes stretched too far. One directing team quoted in the piece claims that asking questions is ''writing.'' If so, I want a writing credit for every time I ask for directions in an unfamiliar city. I also think that the Writer's Guild, of which I am a proud and loyal member, should not attempt to reshape the meaning of the word ''writer'' until it is meaningless.

2012-09-02T00:00:00Z,"In 1944 the avant-garde composer John Cage wrote ''Four Walls,'' a 70-minute work using only the white keys of the piano. It was the music for a ''dance play'' in two acts by the dancer and choreographer Merce Cunningham, who would later become Cage's lifelong partner. I rediscovered ''Four Walls,'' virtually forgotten for four decades, in the 1980s. It has since become one of the most personal works in my repertoire. Its repetitive, insistent nature struck a deep chord within me. It was as if someone had entered the innermost rooms of my mind and translated their contents into sound. I asked Cage, whom I first met in 1981, about this compelling musical essay in inquietude. He told me that ''Four Walls'' was about the disturbed mind, a subject of fascination for Cunningham and himself during the mid-1940s. Two years after the completion of ''Four Walls,'' Cage seriously considered giving up composing to undergo psychoanalysis; he turned instead to Asian philosophy and Zen Buddhism."
2012-09-02T00:00:00Z,"IT becomes popular around this time of year to lament the fact that media coverage treats the presidential campaign as little more than a ''horse race.'' Journalists, this line of argument goes, choose to fixate on which candidate is a superior campaigner or savvier strategist, not on who has sounder ideas or is better prepared to govern. From time to time, the journalists themselves concede that to maintain daily or hourly tension in the contests they promote, they have little choice but to elevate minor poll shifts into major developments. But the reality about horse-race journalism is far more embarrassing to the press and ought to be just as disappointing to the readers who consume our reporting. The truth is that we aren't even that good at covering the horse race. If the 2012 campaign has been any indication, journalists remain unable to keep up with the machinations of modern campaigns, and things are likely only to get worse."

Born March 4, 1925 in Missoula, MO to Dr. P.T McCarthy and Hilda Pauline Vroom Gould, died peacefully in hospice in Nashville, TN on August 24, 2012 at the age of 87 of complications from Alzheimer's. A graduate of the University of Montana with a degree in Forestry, she was the first woman to be employed by the United States Forestry Service in Washington, DC. There she met and was married to her first husband Jack Chassan (deceased) with whom she had three children: Jordan, Joel, and Corinne. In 1960 the family moved to Montclair, NJ where she joined the Women's International League for Peace and Freedom and was a co-founder of the first interracial, intereconomic, interfaith nursery school in town: the Montclair Cooperative School (K-8) now in it's 47th year. In the first large scale anti-nuclear (i.e. the bomb) demonstration in New York City outside of the United Nations in the early 1960's, her sewing prowess and trusty Singer machine provided the banner waving proudly in a large photo on the front page of The New York Times in coverage of the event. After divorcing, she and her three children packed into a 1963 Volkswagen Beetle and drove to Tuskegee, AL, where they spent the summer of 1967 as part of a SNCC/CORE program to provide an integrated school experience to very poor rural African American children, who interacted in a profound and beautiful way with their new northern friends. After marrying her second husband Stan Leavitt (deceased) she moved to Santa Fe, NM where she was active with various community organizations including a rape crisis center. After divorcing, later years were spent in Cincinnati, OH and finally Nashville, TN.

He afterward joked of losing that sale, as it was unfair to have to compete against ""a Mom with all that charm."" Meantime, she completed her studies at UC, graduating BA as an UC Alumni Scholar in the same ceremony with Ron gaining his JD. Now all of the Larsons were Cal Bears. Ruth was active in the School of the Madeleine at their family parish: re-founding the Bridge Club, leading the Cub's Scouts, and singing in Father Larry's choir. The boys went on to the St. Mary's College High School where she helped the Brothers of the Christian Schools, Eunice Jackson and other mothers, found the Belles of St. Mary's as a scholarship organization for the school. She didn't know ""slow."" She spent her days and nights teaching, counseling, feeding and loving her family, gardening, playing the piano at midnite home sessions, dancing at the Parish parties, traveling with Ron, skiing with the boys, and as a member of the Art Deco Society of San Francisco. Always a lady: raised by her Convent trained mother, she was initiated in 1953, by her new friend on Milvia Street, Pat Sager, to wear gloves and scarf and hat and take lunch at the City of Paris. A propriety she must have been one of the last to relinquish. But she wore her scarves and gloves until the day she died. All Services will be at the St. Mary Magdalen Catholic Church 2005 Berryman St, Berkeley, California 94709 (510-526-4811) as follows: Thursday, September 6th at 7PM - The Holy Rosary of the Virgin Mary; Friday, September 7th at 10:30AM - Mass - followed immediately by reception and refreshments in Norton Hall (directly under the Church - entry from the parking lot).

2012-09-02T00:00:00Z,"''SHADOWS OF FORGOTTEN ANCESTORS,'' a mid-1960s landmark of Soviet-era cinema, is the linchpin of the Film Society of Lincoln Center series UKRAINIAN POETIC CINEMA: CAPTURING THE MARVELOUS, which starts on Friday and runs through Sept. 12, at the Walter Reade Theater. Charged with fantastical imagery photographed by a camera that never stops, the film, directed by Sergei Parajanov and set in a remote Carpathian village, tells a star-crossed love story infused with a delirious sense of the magical and supernatural. It epitomizes a folk modernist aesthetic developed in Ukraine in the late 19th century that nearly disappeared in the 1930s but seeped back into movies with the cultural thaw in the late 1960s and early '70s. Two of the selections -- ''Zvenigora'' (1927) and ''Earth'' (1930) -- are silent classics directed by Aleksandr Dovzhenko, who is considered the father of Ukrainian cinema. The screenings will have a live piano accompaniment. ''Earth'' transcends its origins as an assignment to exalt the collectivizing of Soviet agriculture to become a mystical rumination on nature's cycles of death and rebirth.

2012-09-02T00:00:00Z,"MORRIS--Walter Adams, Jr. Walter Adams Morris Jr.,of Williamsburg, VA, formerly of Plandome Manor and Water Mill, New York passed away peacefully at home surrounded by his loving family. A true Renaissance man, he lived a happy and rich 91 years, 66 of them with Suzy, the love of his life. Walter was the beloved son of the late Walter and Margaret Morris of New York City and brother of the late Dr. Robert D. Morris of New York City and Water Mill, NY. Born June 25, 1921 in New York City, Walter graduated from Regis High School in 1938 and the College of the Holy Cross in 1942, where the yearbook captured the essence of his spirit, ""Meet W.A. the debonair New Yorker, the good looking boy with the Pepsodent smile, man of good cheer, usually successful after apparently little effort, always looked as though he stepped directly from a page in Esquire. A care-free cosmopolite who was essentially a scholar and honors man."" Following his first year at Columbia Law School, he served as a Second Lieutenant in the US Army Air Corps during WWII. After the war he returned to Columbia where he was a Kent Scholar. Walter always joked he would have been first in his class had it not been for his many late nights courting Suzy. He happily settled for being number three in his class. They married September 10, 1949 in St. Patrick's Cathedral. They had more than a marriage, it was a great love story of 63 years. Walter began his law career at Shearman and Sterling (1947-57), served as Assistant General Counsel at W.R. Grace and Co., (1957-69) and retired as Vice President, Secretary and General Counsel at Consolidated Edison Co. of New York (1969-86). Walter and Sue raised six children in Manhasset where they lived for 40 years. They moved to Kingsmill in Williamsburg in 1997 where they were very happy and met wonderful friends and neighbors. Walter treasured his friendships with his fellow members of the Crown Colony Club. He found great pleasure writing essays for the Virginia Gazette, playing golf, and reading American history. The highlight of his day was reading The New York Times - which he read for 83 years. He proudly completed the daily crossword puzzle right up to the end of his life. Part of the greatest generation, Walter was a man of integrity and conducted his life to the highest standards. Walter was an extraordinary son, brother, husband, father, grandfather and friend. His handsome face, beautiful blue eyes, enthusiasm, energy, wisdom and wit will be greatly missed. His great loves were his family, books and country. Walter leaves his precious wife, Suzy and his adoring children: Susan of Alexandria, VA, Joan of Warrenton, VA, Walter III ""Skip"" (Penni) of Lighthouse Point, FL, Jonathan (Margaret) of Essex, CT and New York City, Nancy (Kevin D. Miller) of Manhasset and Water Mill, NY, and Ann (Jonathan Barrett) of Hyattsville, MD. He cherished his grandchildren, Kevin, Gordon, Catherine, Nancy and Betsy. The family thanks his friends, neighbors and caregivers that have been so wonderful during his battle with cancer. A funeral mass was held at St. Bede Roman Catholic Church in Williamsburg, VA. Burial took place at Southampton Cemetery Association in New York. Donations in Walter's memory may be made to Regis High School, 55 East 84th Street, New York, NY, 10028."

2012-09-02T00:00:00Z,"''I LOATHE nostalgia,'' Diana Vreeland declared at the beginning of her 1984 memoir ''D.V.'' She meant nothing of the sort, as Christopher Lehmann-Haupt noted in his review in The Times, calling the book a ''deceptively frothy meringue of a monologue.'' Vreeland was an unconventional editor and an unconventional mother (though something of a traditional mate), and her slant on life was from an angle informed by beauty. She had, quite simply, an amazing eye. When I saw a screening of ''Diana Vreeland: The Eye Has to Travel,'' an entertaining new documentary that will have its premiere next Saturday during Fashion Week (it opens in limited release on Sept. 21 in New York and Los Angeles, and soon after in other cities), I was struck by how much Vreeland's voice pervades the film. Of course you see her pages from Harper's Bazaar and Vogue, which she took in 1963 and transformed into a beacon of pop culture. The film's producer and co-director, Lisa Immordino Vreeland, who is married to Vreeland's grandson, Alexander, also creates a vibrant backdrop for her subject's early years in Paris, London and New York."

2012-09-02T00:00:00Z,"RIBALOW--Meir Zvi, Internationally renowned playwright, poet, novelist, critic, and activist, died on August 23rd after battling prostate cancer. He was 63. Mr. Ribalow had 24 of his plays receive some 180 productions worldwide, winning awards in London, New York, and regionally. He won national awards for fiction, his widely published poetry, and musical lyrics; co-wrote ten children's books; and published articles on sports, music, theatre, literature, film, travel and chess. He was co-author, with his father, Harold Ribalow, of three books on sports, and was Director of an award-winning sports website. Mr. Ribalow's poems have recently been collected in two volumes, ""Chasing Ghosts"" and ""The Time We Have Misspent"" and two novels, ""Peanuts and Crackerjacks"" and ""Redheaded Blues"" -- along with a new play, ""Masterpiece"" -- have all been published in the past eighteen months during a typically furious burst of creativity that his illness did little to slow. He wrote articles for publications as diverse as The New York Times, The Sciences, Hadassah, and the program for the 1990 Kasparov-Karpov World Chess Championship, commented on films for the Discovery Channel, and hosted the online radio program ""New River Radio"" on ARTonAIR.org. His scholarly film commentary appears on a number of special edition classic DVD's, including High Noon and Sergeant York. A popular and widely respected educator, he served for almost three decades as Artist-in-Residence in the Department of Communication and Media Studies at Fordham University. Mr. Ribalow was born into a family of writers and scholars -- his grandfather, Menachem Ribalow, edited the only weekly newspaper published in Hebrew in the United States, and his father, Harold, was an internationally renowned author and anthologist of Anglo-American Jewish literature--and was supported and encouraged by his passionately engaged music educator mother, Shoshana, and sister, Reena Ribalow Ben Ephraim (also an award-winning poet and fiction writer). Mr. Ribalow graduated from Phillips Exeter Academy in 1966 and was a University Scholar and Class Poet at Princeton, class of 1970. He was a co-founder and Vice President of the Creative Coalition, a group of entertainment professionals devoted to social and environmental advocacy, working alongside fellow board-members Alec Baldwin, Christopher Reeve, Ron Silver, and Stephen Collins. He was also International Arts Coordinator of The Global Forum, where he worked with the Dalai Lama, Robert Redford and Mikhail Gorbachev. Mr. Ribalow was the Founding Artistic Director of New River Dramatists, the dream child of indefatigable producer Mark Woods, which offers playwrights week-long residencies in the mountains of North Carolina and has developed some 400 new plays and screenplays, almost half of which have already been produced or optioned worldwide. Mr. Ribalow attracted and mixed established, high profile playwrights such as the late James McLure, Wendy Hammond, Richard Dresser and Lee Blessing, with lesser-known, often young, but always deserving writing talents such as inaugural McLure Fellowship and 2012 O'Neill Residency winner Hilary Bettis. Mr. Ribalow directed numerous plays in London and New York, was Joseph Papp's Production Associate at the New York Shakespeare Festival for several years, and founded the American Repertory Company of London. A Broadway Gala Theater Benefit reading of his play Nature of the Universe with Blythe Danner and Brian Dennehy raised funds for The ALS Association of New York. Mr. Ribalow is survived by his mother, sister, nephew Shaiel Ben Ephraim and niece Riora Kerr, and by a grateful and still-expanding community of artists, writers, actors, performers, and philanthropists who learned much of craft and even more of care through his vision and by his example."

2012-09-02T00:00:00Z,"WHEN the art world reconvenes in Chelsea this fall, it will find the usual bounty of big-name artists, and a leap into gigantism among some of their dealers. Sean Kelly, David Zwirner, Hauser & Wirth, Friedrich Petzel and Andrea Rosen are either multiplying their locations or tripling in size, or both. But one Chelsea stalwart is expanding his business by going small. And Taiwanese. He is Danny Emerman, the proprietor of Bottino. His Italian restaurant has been the art neighborhood's clubhouse since 1996. Now, a couple doors farther north on the same block of 10th Avenue, Mr. Emerman has opened Chop Shop, a 25-seat cafe serving pan-Asian cuisine out of a storefront formerly occupied by a Latin diner. It also has 10 bar stools and a 16-seat pocket garden that is an oasis of calm under a canopy of trees out back. Chances are, with millions walking the High Line, and with Avenues, the elite charter school opening across the street, Mr. Emerman will have to scramble to accommodate the crowds."
2012-09-02T00:00:00Z,"''Everyone thought it was complete insanity,'' admits Melanie Simon, the celebrity facialist, of her new Circ-Cell ABO Blood Serum, a somewhat eerily named eye gel said to mimic certain functions of human blood topically with the use of powerful perfluorocarbons. ''As we get older, our blood vessels break down, and become increasingly unable to deliver nutrients to our tissues and metabolize waste,'' she says. ABO Blood is targeted to the under-eye area, specifically dark circles and puffy or crepe-y skin, but Ms. Simon slathers it over her entire face. ''It's especially great for city dwellers,'' she says. ''If you press it in after your skin care regimen, it will lock in your products, protect your skin from the environment and feed it, all at the same time.'' $118. Go to circcell.com .

2012-09-02T00:00:00Z,"To the Editor: Regarding '' Can Travel Make the Child? '' (Aug. 12): Families participating in service-abroad programs should be cautious of one of travel's worst crimes: academic tourism. Sure, it's tempting to expose your (upper-middle class) children to the ''exotic,'' but can such short programs with such hefty price tags adequately address a country's pressing social issues? As a former participant on similar programs, I suspect not. Equipped with a tour guide and camera, travelers become poverty tourists, observing locals through an invisible but palpable barrier. Families who take such brief glimpses at ''the other'' are at risk of undermining these cultures or even perpetuating stereotypes against them, while giving themselves an ego or a college-application boost.

2012-09-03T00:00:00Z,"RIBALOW--Meir Zvi, Internationally renowned playwright, poet, novelist, critic, and activist, died on August 23rd after battling prostate cancer. He was 63. Mr. Ribalow had 24 of his plays receive some 180 productions worldwide, winning awards in London, New York, and regionally. He won national awards for fiction, his widely published poetry, and musical lyrics; co-wrote ten children's books; and published articles on sports, music, theatre, literature, film, travel and chess. He was co-author, with his father, Harold Ribalow, of three books on sports, and was Director of an award-winning sports website. Mr. Ribalow's poems have recently been collected in two volumes, ""Chasing Ghosts"" and ""The Time We Have Misspent"" and two novels, ""Peanuts and Crackerjacks"" and ""Redheaded Blues"" -- along with a new play, ""Masterpiece"" -- have all been published in the past eighteen months during a typically furious burst of creativity that his illness did little to slow. He wrote articles for publications as diverse as The New York Times, The Sciences, Hadassah, and the program for the 1990 Kasparov-Karpov World Chess Championship, commented on films for the Discovery Channel, and hosted the online radio program ""New River Radio"" on ARTonAIR.org. His scholarly film commentary appears on a number of special edition classic DVD's, including High Noon and Sergeant York. A popular and widely respected educator, he served for almost three decades as Artist-in-Residence in the Department of Communication and Media Studies at Fordham University. Mr. Ribalow was born into a family of writers and scholars -- his grandfather, Menachem Ribalow, edited the only weekly newspaper published in Hebrew in the United States, and his father, Harold, was an internationally renowned author and anthologist of Anglo-American Jewish literature--and was supported and encouraged by his passionately engaged music educator mother, Shoshana, and sister, Reena Ribalow Ben Ephraim (also an award-winning poet and fiction writer). Mr. Ribalow graduated from Phillips Exeter Academy in 1966 and was a University Scholar and Class Poet at Princeton, class of 1970. He was a co-founder and Vice President of the Creative Coalition, a group of entertainment professionals devoted to social and environmental advocacy, working alongside fellow board-members Alec Baldwin, Christopher Reeve, Ron Silver, and Stephen Collins. He was also International Arts Coordinator of The Global Forum, where he worked with the Dalai Lama, Robert Redford and Mikhail Gorbachev. Mr. Ribalow was the Founding Artistic Director of New River Dramatists, the dream child of indefatigable producer Mark Woods, which offers playwrights week-long residencies in the mountains of North Carolina and has developed some 400 new plays and screenplays, almost half of which have already been produced or optioned worldwide. Mr. Ribalow attracted and mixed established, high profile playwrights such as the late James McLure, Wendy Hammond, Richard Dresser and Lee Blessing, with lesser-known, often young, but always deserving writing talents such as inaugural McLure Fellowship and 2012 O'Neill Residency winner Hilary Bettis. Mr. Ribalow directed numerous plays in London and New York, was Joseph Papp's Production Associate at the New York Shakespeare Festival for several years, and founded the American Repertory Company of London. A Broadway Gala Theater Benefit reading of his play Nature of the Universe with Blythe Danner and Brian Dennehy raised funds for The ALS Association of New York. Mr. Ribalow is survived by his mother, sister, nephew Shaiel Ben Ephraim and niece Riora Kerr, and by a grateful and still-expanding community of artists, writers, actors, performers, and philanthropists who learned much of craft and even more of care through his vision and by his example."

This required a beer-making professional, so I called on Garrett Oliver, brewmaster at the Brooklyn Brewery and editor of the encyclopedic ""Oxford Companion to Beer. "" Like most professional brewers, Mr. Oliver began as a home brewer, and so is intimately aware of the challenges and limitations of making beer in bathrooms and kitchens, even one as exalted as the White House. ""Brewing at home is very much like cooking at home - it doesn't bear much resemblance to professional brewing, but it can be done simply or very rigorously, and the results can be excellent,'' he told me, adding that the Brewers Association , a craft-brewing trade group, estimates that a million Americans make beer at home. (After word of the White House's brewing experiment spread, many of them joined in urging President Obama's aides to divulge the recipe.) ""The version of brewing they're doing at the White House might be called 'second-level beginner.' """

He agrees, if they'll murder someone for him in exchange.

Still, ''like all filmmakers, Mr. Allen steals from himself like a magpie, which wouldn't be grounds for criticism if he were a more dedicated and careful thief,'' she said. ''Like many of his later films, though, 'Cassandra's Dream' feels too lightly polished and often rushed, as if he had directed it with a stopwatch.

He graduated from Oklaunion High School in 1941. Upon graduation he matriculated to Oklahoma A&M University. Col. Sturm was inducted into the U.S. Army as an enlisted man in 1942. He received his commission in 1944. During WWII he served as the commander of a rifle company and temporarily as the battalion commander of the 3rd Battalion, 253rd Infantry Regiment, 63rd Infantry Division. He commanded his units during the European Campaign and was in command of his units during the Battle of the Bulge and the penetration of the Siegfried Line. Upon the conclusion of WWII, Col.

They were married on February 2, 1947. Col. and Mrs. Sturm were married for 65 years. Upon the invasion of South Korea by North Korea, Col. Sturm was recalled to active duty, and once again commanded a unit in combat; Company E, 23rd Infantry Regiment, 2nd Infantry Division, designated as a Ranger unit. Col. Sturm's company led the initial assault and capture of Heart Break Ridge.

Mary Jane was a generous supporter of many charities, including Covenant House, where she volunteered for many years, and The Sharing Foundation, which cares for severely disadvantaged and orphaned children in Cambodia. The family is deeply indebted to her extraordinary caregivers, who kept her smiling and comfortable throughout her illness: Ann, Kathy, Marylynne, Maureen, and Kathleen.

Handsome, witty, charming and generous he lived his life like it was not a dress rehearsal and took great pleasure in his adventures. Getting into college at Cornell and deciding to leave the first week to transfer and graduate from Syracuse exemplified his spontaneity to a tee. After serving in the Korean War as a Second Lieutenant in the Air Force, the debonair young man started his long career on Wall Street working for Loeb Rhoades and ending at Smith Barney. Residing both in New York City and Palm Beach, Ben treasured his friends and family, traveling and his long standing relationship with all his favorite restaurants and bars. He lived by the motto, ""The best is yet to come."" He would want us to remember that and have no regrets. A man who danced to his own drum, his spirit and passion for life will continue to live through his friends and family. We love you Dad."

''I began to look at football as my basic training or my sacrifice that I had to make to do what I really wanted to do, which was reach people,'' Mr. Martin says, admitting that he ''didn't want to play football, didn't like playing football, had to train my mind to enjoy it while I was in the N.F.L.''

Jamie Bell is St. John Rivers, the young clergyman who helps to nurse Jane back to health; Judi Dench, the gossipy housekeeper; Sally Hawkins, the nasty aunt; and Imogen Poots, the pretty rich girl who almost derails Jane's chances in love. ''Reader, I liked it,'' A. O. Scott wrote in The New York Times. ''This 'Jane Eyre,' energetically directed by Cary Joji Fukunaga ('Sin Nombre') from a smart, trim script by Moira Buffini ('Tamara Drewe'), is a splendid example of how to tackle the daunting duty of turning a beloved work of classic literature into a movie.

2012-09-06T00:00:00Z,"How much more tension could ''Breaking Bad'' provide in its recent mini-season? In eight all-too-short episodes viewers of this AMC series bit their fingernails down to their nubs watching a high-tech, hands-free heist on a police evidence locker; a train robbery with unexpectedly lethal results; a very depressing birthday party for the meth-making protagonist, Walter White (Bryan Cranston); and a final showdown between Walter and his sometime ally Mike Ehrmantraut (Jonathan Banks). And just when the prison stabbings and retaliatory killings had come to an end; Jesse Pinkman (Aaron Paul) had been paid his share; the White family had assembled for a happy gathering; and we had prepared for Semisonic's ''Closing Time'' to start playing, Hank (Dean Norris) made a surprising discovery. Now comes the most suspenseful moment of all: waiting almost a year for the next eight episodes of ''Breaking Bad,'' which will close out the season, the series and the story of Walter White. To tide us over until then, Vince Gilligan, the creator and show runner of ''Breaking Bad,'' spoke to reporters in a telephone news conference this week. In these excerpts from that discussion Mr. Gilligan talks about Sunday's episode and what's to come in the show's final installments. DAVE ITZKOFF"

As the spring 2013 runway season begins today, there is a sense that everyone will be trying just a little harder, that the fashion flock came home from their vacations a little earlier, especially in Europe. The game is on, and the star players are taking their places. In New York, there are young designers on the rise, each vying to become the next big thing. In Paris, the first ready-towear shows of Raf Simons at Dior and Hedi Slimane at Yves Saint Laurent will take place, showcasing two of the most important designers in fashion today. Which will be the definitive look of the season? The lush coloring of Mr. Simons at Dior? Or the as-yet-undefined vision of Mr. Slimane for Saint Laurent. But the truth is, there is already a talented field of designers at work, most of whom have only recently risen to the level of establishment. There are, of course, perennials (Ralph, Giorgio, Karl, Donatella -- if they don't need a last name, they're here to stay), but you have the feeling that a leadership change had been in order for some time. Here are the designers who are ruling the game today. RAF SIMONS"
2012-09-06T00:00:00Z,"CLARK--A. Gordon, passed away on September 2, 2012 in Chagrin Falls, Ohio at age 90 years. He is lovingly remembered by his wife of 70 years Maureen Clark and his daughter Susan Clark. He had a great sense of humor and always had those around him laughing. He loved to travel and had a passion for animals and cars. Gordon's career in the transportation business spanned seven decades - a time in which he worked for major corporations in the United States and abroad. Gordon was born on September 5, 1921 in Toronto, Canada. After serving in the Canadian Navy during World War II, he started his business sales career disposing of war surplus materials. Soon after he discovered his love for trucks and joined White Motor Corporation in the early 1950s as branch manager of the company's Toronto operation. White Motors soon promoted Gordon to head their entire Canadian sales and marketing operations and consequently appointed him Vice President Sales and Marketing for the corporation headquartered in Cleveland, Ohio. In 1980, Gordon joined Daimler Benz AG as a consultant to help establish the company's North American truck business. He subsequently was appointed Senior Vice President of Sales and Marketing for Freightliner Corporation, Daimler Benz's newly acquired truck manufacturing subsidiary in Portland, Oregon. Gordon's work with Freightliner was instrumental in helping propel the company to the number one truck manufacturer in the United States. In 1989, Gordon joined Penske Corporation and worked closely with Roger S. Penske in their effort to re-establish Detroit Diesel Corporation's leadership in heavy-duty truck engines in North America. With Gordon sales expertise, together with the industry's first electronically controlled truck engine, the Detroit Diesel Series 60, became the dominant engine of choice among truck fleets. Gordon ended his long career in the transportation industry retiring from Penske Corporation in 2005 at age 83. All his life, Gordon was the consummate sales professional who valued his thousands of contacts and relationships that he established in the transportation business in this country and abroad. Fleets regularly sought his counsel in specifying equipment; fleet executives cherished their long time friendships with him as he did theirs. Memorial Services will be held 1:00pm Monday September 10, 2012 at Stroud-Lawrence Funeral Home 95 South Franklin Street Chagrin Falls, Ohio. Memorial donations may be made in Gordon's name to the Geauga County Rescue Village on 15463 Chillicothe Road, Novelty, Ohio 44072, (440) 338-4819."

It has reframed its education targets, sometimes opening its doors to high school dropouts, at other times pursuing college graduates and, more recently, finding a way to assess home-schooled students. And as the Army makes the transition to a smaller fighting force with a tighter budget, it is not surprising to find Pentagon officials expressing confidence that recruiters are nimble enough to adapt to a new organizational model."

Mary Jane taught English at Duquesne University until her marriage to William Gearns, with whom she had two children, Jack and Mary Gail. Mary Jane was a devoted mother, faithful friend, and amazing and loving grandmother with boundless energy and enthusiasm for life. She traveled with family and friends all over the world and delighted in taking each of her grandchildren on their own annual trips (no parents or siblings allowed!) to destinations of their choosing, including Kenya, Australia, New Zealand, the Galapagos Islands, and many other exciting destinations. Mary Jane served for more than 20 years as a Director of Wahl Clipper Corporation, the world's largest manufacturer of electric hair clippers, founded by her father in 1919. Mary Jane was a generous supporter of many charities, including Covenant House, where she volunteered for many years, and The Sharing Foundation, which cares for severely disadvantaged and orphaned children in Cambodia.

Google redirected Chinese-language search requests to its Hong Kong site after the 2010 hacking; it did not withdraw from China. (Engineering, advertising and other operations remain there.)

Dolce may have taken the prize for brocade, but giddy opulence was one of the season's most tempting trends. If you're smitten with the baroque look but are wary of going all the way, it can be pared down to work with classics. Think brocade boots or smoking slippers with jeans and a crisp button-down. (That shirt might have jeweled detail. J. Crew has a good option.) Add any pair from this selection to your street-cool basics, and you have the makings of a chicly decadent Fashion Week look.

2012-09-06T00:00:00Z,"LENA DUNHAM One feels a bit ambivalent placing Lena Dunham, the creator and star of the HBO hit ''Girls,'' on a list of fashion tastemakers. Indeed, as the industry extends its arms (and offers, no doubt, of co-branding), there's a strong impulse to yell, ''Run, Lena, run!'' In a fashion smackdown with ''Sex and the City,'' ''Girls'' would clearly lose. But the New York of ''Sex and the City'' scarcely exists today. It has vacated to Brooklyn, which is Ms. Dunham's turf. The values have changed. Ms. Dunham's liberal feminist voice is dry with humor and failure. And those are concepts that the resolutely perky, mendacious fashion world just can't cope with; in its view, women must still be talon-sharp. Ms. Dunham's character on ''Girls'' seems to ask the question, ''You don't think I'm pretty?'' Yet our faith in her lies in the fact that she will not give quarter to your stupid judgments. For fashion, that's an interesting dialogue to have."

(She also had a strange propensity for accepting rides from carriage drivers who are the physical embodiment of Death.) But what did that celebrated Massachusetts poet, who died in 1886 -- long before the ubiquity of Instagram -- actually look like? Until now only one authenticated portrait of Dickinson as an adult, a daguerreotype showing her sitting upright in a chair, was known to exist. But as The Guardian of London reports, a second image of Dickinson, with a smile on her face and a friend by her side, may have been confirmed. The Amherst College Archives and Special Collections are now displaying a second daguerreotype that the college says depicts Dickinson and her friend Kate Scott Turner, probably taken around 1859 on a visit to the college. The picture, purchased in 1995 by a collector who presented it to Amherst in 2007, was shown during an August conference of the Emily Dickinson International Society."
2012-09-06T00:00:00Z,"What's in your child's lunch box? If you're a good parent, that lunch meets all of the big three requirements: it's healthy, no-waste and allergen-free. The classic brown-paper-bag lunch of your childhood (P.B. & J. on white, chips, Twinkie, soda) is so last-century. It's not just the nutrition-free content, it's the packaging. (Although a few weeks of that lunch would surely get you a note from the school politely suggesting that less sugar might make for more learning.) While few schools make ""zero-waste"" packed lunches a requirement, many encourage them with zero-waste days, lunch-waste curriculums, competitions for the classroom that creates the least trash in a week, and even national-park-style ""pack in, pack out"" policies. But less in the landfill means more work in our kitchens. It means drawers full of reusable containers: breakable glass, dubious plastic, heavy stainless steel. It means the soft-sided lunch box comes back dripping with ranch dressing (the lid didn't go back on) and pudding (but Miss Danielle said I had to bring it home!). Come September, the top rack of the dishwasher is always full, and the nondishwasher-safe thermos is always drying by the sink."

How could a pair of self-professed mall kids from suburban Los Angeles have figured out the key to fashion for their generation? No matter where you shop today, you can detect their influence. The reverence for 1980s California streetwear brands, the discovery of indie labels from far-flung corners of the world, the fervor for unconventional collaborations, the unapologetic embrace of hipsters, even the success of the fast-fashion Topshop chain in the United States -- it can all be traced to the store Ms. Lim and Mr. Leon opened in 2002."

He had a creative mind that always strived for perfection. Whenever we look at anything, are posed with a problem or asked for a solution we quietly reflect ... what would Peter think? He was extremely private and chose to keep his courageous and dignified battle with cancer just that. Peter and partner, Lee Mindel received the Cooper Hewitt Smithsonian National Design award from the First Lady, Michelle Obama, at the White House. The night before the event, he expressed to Lee, that although he had a hard time believing in religion he would never lose his faith in the value of the creative.

We console and send our love to his devoted wife Laura Bennett Shelton and his beloved six children Cleo Bennett, Peik, Truman, Pierson, Larson and Finn Shelton.

2012-09-08T00:00:00Z,"7:30 P.M. (HBO) EXTREMELY LOUD & INCREDIBLY CLOSE (2011) Oskar Schell (Thomas Horn), an 11-year-old New Yorker whose father (Tom Hanks) died in the Sept. 11 attacks on the World Trade Center, traverses the five boroughs in search of the owner of a key in an envelope scrawled with a single word -- ''Black'' -- that he believes will unlock the answer to what happened on ''the worst day.'' Sandra Bullock, above with Mr. Horn, plays Oskar's grieving mother, who seems oblivious to his travels; Viola Davis and Jeffrey Wright are the first of the 472 Blacks whose names Oskar has culled from city phone books; and Max von Sydow is the mysterious man who becomes Oskar's sidekick. ''The performances, including from the reliably appealing Mr. Hanks and Ms. Bullock, are smoothed of any roughness, which can be chalked up to the fact that most of the story is seen through Oskar's eyes,'' Manohla Dargis wrote in The New York Times. ''Mr. Horn, who was 13 when the movie was made, is an attractively real-looking boy, with an impish smile and a natural-feeling directness, and he holds his own just fine, even against a scene-stealer like Mr. von Sydow.'' But, she added: ''It's an impossible role in an impossible movie that has no reason for being other than as another pop-culture palliative for a trauma it can't bear to face. In truth, 'Extremely Loud & Incredibly Close' isn't about Sept. 11. It's about the impulse to drain that day of its specificity and turn it into yet another wellspring of generic emotions: sadness, loneliness, happiness.'' 10:30 A.M. (13) RELIGION & ETHICS NEWSWEEKLY This newsmagazine kicks off its 16th season with a report by Kim Lawton from the Democratic National Convention about the issues liberal religious leaders face, and how President Obama's stance on gay marriage has affected his support among some religious groups.

Government prosecutors had argued that Mr. Fairey should serve time for his actions and he faced up to six months in prison.

He was extremely private and chose to keep his courageous and dignified battle with cancer just that. Peter and partner, Lee Mindel received the Cooper Hewitt Smithsonian National Design award from the First Lady, Michelle Obama, at the White House. The night before the event, he expressed to Lee, that although he had a hard time believing in religion he would never lose his faith in the value of the creative.

We console and send our love to his devoted wife Laura Bennett Shelton and his beloved six children Cleo Bennett, Peik, Truman, Pierson, Larson and Finn Shelton.

2012-09-09T00:00:00Z,"SALYER--Marjorie Carlin ""Jill"" June 5, 1918 to August 30, 2012. Marjorie ""Jill"" Salyer Smith, passed away peacefully in her home in Coronado, California on August 30, 2012 at the age of 94. Jill was blessed with a long and vibrant life. Her warm and sparkling smile won her many friends the world over. She was born in Brooklyn, New York on June 5, 1918 to her loving parents, Jeannette and Walter Carlin. They lived a joyous life dedicated to family, Church and community and they travelled widely. Marjorie attended Berkeley Prep in Brooklyn K-12. Marjorie made her debut in New York City in 1936 and then went on to Georgian Court College in Lakewood, New Jersey in the class of 1941 where she studied journalism. Marjorie gained the nickname ""Jill"" while dating a dashing young Princeton man named Jack who was starring in a Princeton Triangle production of ""Jack and Jill."" The name stuck and all but her oldest childhood friends and relatives in Brooklyn called her Jill from then on. Marjorie was elected Dartmouth Winter Carnival Queen in 1940. What a beauty, inside and out. Jill loved our great country, she was highly principeled and very patriotic. Throughout the war she volunteered as a driver with the Red Cross picking up service men and women from ships returning home and taking them to the hospital. Jill met her future husband in Spring Lake New Jersey the night that President Truman announced the bombing of Hiroshima. Robert F. Smith, a Pearl harbor survivor, was then a Commander in the Navy, in Command of the Lighter than Air Force at Lakehurst Naval Air Station. He was a dashingly handsome gentleman and it was love at first sight for both of them. They married in New York in 1948 and moved to Chicago where they began their family. Robert ""Bob"" was President of Indiana Steel Corporation and Jill was a very active corporate wife. She excelled at hosting guests from around the world and serving on community boards while working as a volunteer at the Art Institute. Marjorie ""Jill"" was elected to the Board of Directors of Lafayette National Bank in Brooklyn in 1957 and served faithfully and for many years. They moved the family to Long Beach, Indiana where they built an outstanding home on the beach largely designed by Jill. She served on the Parent Committee of Notre Dame School, her children's school. She was den mother to her daughter's and son's Scout troops. Jill loved flowers and Chaired the Annual Flower Show as well as the School's Annual Summer Fundraiser. Bob and Jill designed and built a second home at Eldorado Country Club in Indian Wells California where the family spent the winters. They were founding members of Sacred Heart Church in Palm Desert. Jill was active in the Auxiliary of the Eisenhower Medical Center and the Ladies Golf Committee at Eldorado. She remained a member of Eldorado until 2011. In 1965 Bob made a career change from manufacturing to banking. He became Senior Vice President of Wells Fargo Bank in charge of the International and the National Divisions. The family moved to San Francisco. Jill was called upon to organize many Bank events. She was honored to have served on the Board of the San Francisco Ballet and the DeYoung Museum and the Women's Auxiliary of Children's Hospital. She was a member of the Franciscan Club, Menlo Country Club and the San Francisco Golf Club, quite a feat for a woman then. In the early 70s they purchased a condominium in Honolulu, Hawaii where, together with family and friends they enjoyed many happy times. Later, as the children grew and airfares climbed they sold the Hawaii property and bought a beautiful Condominium in Coronado, California where they celebrated many of Jill's birthdays and many 4th of July celebrations. She was gracious, loving and generous to all who knew her. After her husband passed away in 1998 Jill married Dr. John Salyer of Palm Desert California in 2001. They split their time between Indian Wells and Coronado. Dr. Salyer passed away in 2008. Marjorie (Jill) is survived by her daughter, Roberta Smith, her grandson, Maximilian Riley, granddaughter, Joanna Riley Weidenmiller and her son, Jeffrey Smith, his son Alex and daughter Carlin. She was deeply loved and will be sorely missed. Funeral Mass in celebration of her life will be held at 2pm on Thursday, September 20 at the Naval Amphibious Base Chapel in Coronado. In lieu of flowers, a donation may be made to St. Jude Children's Research Hospital, www.stjude.org, or Vitas, Innovative Hospice Care of San Diego, www.vitas.com."

2012-09-09T00:00:00Z,"This week's Bonus Feature is just that: a bonus excerpt from Paul Elie's ''Reinventing Bach,'' in which he surveys the American cultural landscape around one night that Gould was recording the ''Goldberg'' Variations in New York City: That was Wednesday, June 8, 1955. The night before, Dwight Eisenhower appeared on color TV (the first U.S. president to do so). In a laboratory in Philadelphia, Dr. Thomas Stoltz Harvey was sectioning the brain of Albert Einstein, which he had removed while performing an autopsy on the scientist after his death in Princeton in April. Saul Bellow, on Riverside Drive in New York, was mourning his father: ''Not that I was ever prompt at anything,'' he told Leslie Fiedler, ''but life is particularly difficult in all departments just now.'' Flannery O'Connor had just returned to Georgia from New York, where she had seen ''Cat on a Hot Tin Roof'' on Broadway and appeared on television to watch a playhouse acting-out of ''The Life You Save May Be Your Own.'' After years of struggle, Alberto Giacometti saw his work presented in three retrospectives at once: in West Germany, in London and at the Guggenheim Museum on Fifth Avenue. And an editor at the Viking Press was considering a novel by Jack Kerouac: ''So here are these characters -- in search of their identity -- and the way they must do it -- is by driving all over the U.S. -- and the way they are really doing it is by 'feeling' life down to its very roots.''"
2012-09-09T00:00:00Z,"While the German director Max Ophuls's 1940s sojourn in Hollywood was not a happy one, it still produced some of his finest work. His two 1949 films, ''Caught,'' a portrait of a psychotic millionaire (based on Howard Hughes and chillingly incarnated by Robert Ryan) and ''The Reckless Moment,'' a tough noir examination of the emotional restrictions of the middle class, still await a DVD release in the United States. Fortunately, Ophuls's 1948 ''Letter From an Unknown Woman'' is receiving a DVD and Blu-ray release by Olive Films. This romantic melodrama points forward to the opulent and ironic period style Ophuls would perfect after his return to France in ''The Earrings of Madame de ....'' and his film maudit ''Lola Montès.'' ''Letter From an Unknown Woman'' feels less worldly than those pictures, and while the tragic twist of its source, a short story by the great Viennese writer Stefan Zweig, is still present, the obsessional quality has become somewhat masochistic."

In the last letter, dated 2007, he declines a speaking gig: ""I resemble nothing so much as an iguana, hate travel, and have nothing to say."" "" The John Lennon Letters "" (Little, Brown, $30). Much of Lennon's correspondence is published here for the first time.

2012-09-09T00:00:00Z,"''I think you're the cause of all this!'' That line, spoken right into the camera -- and so, to us -- in Alfred Hitchcock's film ''The Birds,'' is the most direct example of Hitchcock's penchant for making the audience share moral culpability for what's on screen. We cower in horror from the bird attacks (as do Tippi Hedren and younger victims, above) and yet, having signed on for the mayhem, we are the cause, just as the woman says. There are striking moments like that throughout the 14 films in Universal's Blu-ray set ''Alfred Hitchcock: The Masterpiece Collection,'' and in Hitchcock Blu-rays released by Warner Brothers: Janet Leigh's dead eye staring accusingly at us in ''Psycho''; Grace Kelly, being strangled in the ''Dial M for Murder'' and reaching behind her for a weapon and pointing her finger directly into the camera (seen in 3-D, as it is on the new Blu-ray, the accusing digit reaches out of the screen. Sometimes the immoral simply resemble us. There's Farley Granger blithely telling Robert Walker he'd like someone to murder his wife in ''Strangers on a Train,'' and James Stewart in ''Rear Window,'' so intent on solving a murder by peeping from his apartment window (as we are peeping at the screen) that he almost allows the deaths of two other innocents. It's the refusal of such passivity that makes Doris Day a heroine in the superb (and still relatively unsung) ''Man Who Knew Too Much.'' Unable to be just a spectator, she screams during a performance at the Royal Albert Hall, saving a man from an assassination. But no one is entirely innocent in Hitchcock's world, and those screams ensure the would-be assassin's own death. These Blu-ray debuts were unavailable for preview. The Universal set is a version of a 2005 DVD box that gave rise to some criticism of the transfers and color of a few titles, especially ''Vertigo'' (which was originally shot in the VistaVision process). Technical questions aside, these films remain among the movies' hardest-edged investigations of moral responsibility, and among the most entertaining. True guilty pleasures. (''Alfred Hitchcock: The Masterpiece Collection,'' Sept. 25, Blu-ray $299.98; ''Strangers on a Train,'' Oct. 9, Blu-ray $19.98; ''Dial M for Murder,'' Oct. 9, 3-D Blu-ray $35.99) CHARLES TAYLOR"

Just hope it's nothing like what transpires in ''Rosemary's Baby,'' Roman Polanski's 1968 adaptation of Ira Levin's horror novel, in which Mia Farrow plays a young wife who becomes impregnated by Satan. The Prince of Darkness has help in the form of the sinister but delightful John Cassavetes, as Ms. Farrow's crocodile-smile husband, an ambitious but flailing actor. He sells his wife's womb to the big red guy in exchange for a juicy part in a hit play. The picture is alternately chilling and bitterly funny, but Mr. Polanski's deft touch means you can't always distinguish which is which. Rosemary is presented as such a guileless naïf that you alternate between wanting to protect her and wishing she'd wise up, but in the end, as Ms. Farrow plays her, it's hard not to sympathize with her. With her pixie haircut, waifish body and enormous eyes, she's a Keane painting come to life."

He was born in Evanston, Illinois on May 24, 1933. His parents, Puzant and Nevare (nee Kalustian) Demirjian, were immigrants whose families had escaped the Armenian genocide during WWI. Mr. Demirjian graduated from Wheaton College in Wheaton, IL in 1955 with a B.S. in Zoology. That same year he was drafted into the Armed Services but received a 4-F exemption due to a head injury he had suffered playing high school football, which also accounted for the stunning white streak in his hair. In 1957, following a brief stint in the study of medicine, Mr. Demirjian shifted his professional focus to Wall Street. and joined the investment bank of L.F. Rothschild & Co, Inc. He loved the work and, rising rapidly through the ranks, was named manager of municipal bond trading in 1960. By 1972, he was a general partner, and in 1975 became the director of international operations, establishing important relationships with many European, Middle Eastern, and Japanese financial organizations and agencies, including the Vatican, the Saudi Arabian Monetary Authority, the Monarchy of Liechtenstein, and numerous central banks. He was named an administrative partner at Rothschild in 1985. In 1989 he joined Bishop Rosen & Co. where he served as a financial adviser until his retirement in 2005. Mr. Demirjian was an avid golfer and a member of The National Golf Links in Southampton and the Quogue Field Club. He was also a long-time member of the New York Athletic Club. An active member of Madison Avenue Presbyterian Church in Manhattan for many years, he served there as a trustee and elder. Upon the retirement of the Reverend David Read in 1991, Mr. Demirjian established a scholarship fund in Dr. Read's name, which awards $10,000 each year to an outstanding seminary student. In his retirement, he continued to analyze the financial markets in the context of world events, poring over six newspapers every day. He was always elegantly dressed, usually with a cigar in hand. A warm, gregarious bear of a man, he was much beloved by family and friends alike. He is survived by his second wife, Nancy Mullan-Demirjian; and three children, Andrea, Gregory, and Alexis.

As part of its first season in its new home on 42nd Street the company presented revivals of two Fugards -- ''Blood Knot'' and ''My Children! My Africa!'' -- and now it ends the Fugard season with the New York premiere of ''The Train Driver,'' which Mr. Fugard has said he thinks is his most important play. As with much of Mr. Fugard's recent writing the play depicts the troubled and despair-riddled landscape of post-apartheid South Africa. It's inspired by an actual event that took place more than a decade ago: A poor black woman from a squatter camp stepped, with her three children, into the path of a speeding commuter train. Mr. Fugard's play takes place after the event, as the driver of the train, played by Ritchie Coster, tries to come to terms with the horror of what took place and his inadvertent role in it.

She is the German artist KARIN KNEFFEL, and when an exhibition of her paintings opens at Gagosian's Madison Avenue space on Wednesday, it will be one of the first times that New Yorkers will have the chance to see her delicate, multilayered canvases. Reminiscent of Gerhard Richter, with whom Ms. Kneffel studied, the paintings imaginatively combine perception and reality, or as the artist once explained, they ''create something to hang onto, which disappears the moment you try to grasp it.'' The exhibition, on view through Oct. 20, will include one painting, from a series of works, based on Haus Esters in Krefeld, Germany, the Bauhaus-style red-brick villa designed by Mies van der Rohe that has become a contemporary art museum. In this painting Ms. Kneffel has incorporated the interior furnishings that the Esters family had in the house, overlaid with semitransparent reflected images of a furniture arrangement consisting of lamps and chairs by Mies and the designer Lily Reich. 980 Madison Avenue, near 77th Street, (212) 744-2313, gagosian.com ."

2012-09-09T00:00:00Z,"Among the houses that Philip Johnson designed in New Canaan, Conn., the suburban enclave that became a laboratory for postwar Modernist design, the Robert C. Wiley house , completed in 1953, remains one of his most elegant. It is a strikingly simple composition of two rectangular boxes: one, a glass and wood pavilion with a single, 15-foot-tall living, dining and kitchen space, is cantilevered over the other, a stone and concrete base that contains, among other things, four small bedrooms, bathrooms and a sitting room. The 3,000-square-foot house typifies Modernism's insistence on efficient use of space, but by the advent of the McMansion era, despite its architectural pedigree, it merely seemed quaintly, and unsalably, tiny. The house had been on the market for some time when an enlightened buyer - Frank Gallipoli, the president of Freepoint Commodities , an energy trading firm - bought it in 1994. ""I wasn't looking for a Philip Johnson house,"" he recalled, but given the price of land in New Canaan, the building, along with the six acres on which it sits, offered good value. ""It had the utility of a house,"" Gallipoli said, ""but I was getting an art object."" And art is a subject close to Gallipoli's heart: he owns an extensive collection that includes works by contemporary British artists like Damien Hirst, Tracey Emin, Gary Hume, Jenny Saville and Marc Quinn. Many of these pieces are too big to show in a domestic setting, so Gallipoli began to think about converting a barn on the property (it also served as a garage) into a private gallery. About 10 years ago, he asked Johnson himself to come up with a design, but the architect's idea for a series of domed structures was never built. Ultimately, Gallipoli commissioned Roger Ferris, of the Connecticut firm Roger Ferris + Partners , to design the barn, along with a pool house, a new garage and a substantial restoration of the existing house. (Ferris also did some work on Gallipoli's Manhattan house and designed a ""surf shack"" for him in the Hamptons, which includes a pink Corian aboveground lap pool.)"

2012-09-09T00:00:00Z,"PBS viewers can cavort with the gods and ponder the convergence of 19th-century opera with 21st-century technology when the network broadcasts WAGNER'S COMPLETE RING CYCLE -- ''Das Rheingold,'' ''Die Walküre,'' ''Siegfried'' and ''Götterdämmerung'' -- for the first time in more than two decades. This much-debated production, directed by Robert Lepage (rumored price: $16 million and not a few disgruntled critics) and starring Bryn Terfel, Deborah Voigt and Stephanie Blythe, was unveiled in increments at the Metropolitan Opera starting in the 2010-11 season. ''Wagner's Dream'' (Monday at 9 p.m.), in which Susan Froemke tells the back story of Mr. Lepage's staging of the epic, ushers in this four-night event (Tuesday through Friday at 9; check local listings). This documentary also marvels at the 45-ton set, nicknamed ''the machine,'' of 24 rotating planks that twisted into staircases and walls and threatened to grind everything to a halt. Ms. Voigt, who fell off the contraption early in her run as Brünnhilde, likened navigating the demanding role while the ground moved beneath her feet to climbing Mount Everest.

2012-09-09T00:00:00Z,"THE Zimbabwe-born NORA CHIPAUMIRE, now working out of New York, has spent most of her (still relatively short) choreographic career exploring ideas about African identity -- and even more specifically, ideas about female African identity. Until now her pieces have been largely abstract, even if they have dealt with Zimbabwean history and her experience of it. But in ''Miriam,'' which opens on Wednesday in the Fishman Space of the Brooklyn Academy of Music's new Fisher Building, Ms. Chipaumire turns to the life of the South African singer MIRIAM MAKEBA, taking inspiration from her dramatic narrative -- first as an exiled, worldwide symbol of protest against the apartheid government, later as the beloved artist known as Mama Africa. The idea of Ms. Chipaumire taking on Makeba's complicated life and art is compelling. Ms. Chipaumire too is an artistic protester against the politics of her country (South Africa's neighbor) and is effectively in exile; she too is a performer of intense vitality and charisma. But Ms. Chipaumire's work suggests that she is unlikely to do anything overly literal in ''Miriam,'' which has an original score by Omar Sosa. 7:30 p.m. Wednesday through Saturday, 321 Ashland Place, Fort Greene, (718) 636-4100, bam.org ."

2012-09-09T00:00:00Z,"ANDY WARHOL once proclaimed that ''an artist is somebody who produces things that people don't need to have,'' a statement exemplified by his namesake foundation. The Andy Warhol Foundation for the Visual Arts has, in recent years, allowed his work to be paired with retailers (Barneys) and limited-edition luxury goods, including accessories (Philip Treacy), wine (Dom Pérignon) and even skateboards (Alien Workshop). Noticeably missing from the portfolio, however, has been a beauty collaboration. Enter the Nars autumn/winter 2012 color collection. Combining Warhol's well-documented love of makeup with that of the brand's founder and creative director, François Nars, the 29-piece offering captures the spirit of Warhol -- and his muses, including Edie Sedgwick, Debbie Harry and Candy Darling -- through more than just the use of recognizable imagery. ''What I loved about (Warhol's) world was that he took elements from the past and made them his own,'' Mr. Nars said. This desire to project forward is evident in product development innovations, like printed eye-shadow palettes with every color filled through to the pan, as well as never-before-seen applications of Warhol's works (a ''Kiss''-wrapped soup can, for example) by the creative consultant Fabien Baron."
2012-09-09T00:00:00Z,"From good (''The Rainmaker'') to so-so (''The Firm,'' ''The Pelican Brief'') the film adaptations of John Grisham's legal thrillers have all been marked by good performances. The best, Joel Schumacher's terrific 1994 melodrama ''The Client,'' is bursting with them. The plot involves 11-year-old Mark Sway (Brad Renfro), who accidentally witnesses the suicide of a mob informant and in the process finds out, literally, where one of the bodies is buried. He becomes the target of hit men who want to silence him and career-climbing prosecutors who want to force him to spill his guts (even if it means the hoods will actually spill his guts). And he becomes the client of a struggling defense attorney, Reggie Love (Susan Sarandon, left with Mr. Renfro), who finds herself with the biggest case of her career. Everywhere you look in this picture someone is doing some snazzy bit of character acting: Tommy Lee Jones, as the Bible-thumping showboat of a prosecutor; Mary-Louise Parker, not allowing a sliver of condescension to creep into her portrayal of Mark's utterly defeated working-class mom; Ossie Davis as a judge, his voice thick and sweet and his gaze as inescapable as fate; J. T. Walsh as a disheveled prosecutor who senses this case could be his ticket into the big time. And that's not to mention John Diehl, Anthony LaPaglia, Anthony Edwards, Anthony Heald, William H.

2012-09-09T00:00:00Z,"The difference between the flamboyance of the designers' runways and what women really wear can be quite amazing. As the New York spring collections unfolded this week, simple styles by two European designers, Azzedine Alaïa and the label Alexander McQueen, designed by Sarah Burton, popped up consistently on the avenues. Alaïa's princess dress, left and right, was designed with sophisticated knitting technology. From a molded bodice, the skirt is released into a graceful circle that moves with the body. At far left are black and beige sheaths from McQueen. The prototype, far left, top, which was shown on the Paris runway in the spring, had a lace-like black cage of leather over a beige knit sheath with a flanged hem. The commercial version, not seen at the press shows, represents practical reality: it is completely of knit fabric and has lost the flanged hem. The popularity of the dresses may indicate that women are moving away from separates. What they appear to want is a flattering look that they can zip themselves into in 30 seconds."

Born in Philadelphia on August 12, 1928, to Anna and Robert Weissman, he grew up in his parents' family shoe store with his older brother Harold and went on to a career in the shoe industry. He rose from a Kitty Kelly Shoe store manager in Chicago, IL to Executive VP of Ideal Shoe, a division of J.M. Fields, a national chain. In 1970, he started his own company, Marketing Footwear Associates (M.F.A) in Cherry Hill, NJ with his nephew, Dick Weissman. He soon became known throughout the industry as ""Mr. Snoopy."" He was the originator of character licensing in footwear when he obtained the licensing rights for the Peanuts characters created by Charles Schulz. M.F.A. became an international business and also licensed ""E.T,"" National Football League (N.F.L) footwear, Pac-Man slippers and Budweiser athletic footwear. In 1974, he started Butterfly Originals, a licensed children's accessory company with international distribution of more than 40 licenses of Snoopy/Peanuts, The Muppets and Pac-Man. Weissman was also a principal in a licensed school supply company, Plymouth Inc. Eventually, he sold his original M.F.A. business to Mercury International and went on to create Marketing Licensing Associates (M.L.A) with a partner, Robert Rowan. M.L.A. is an agency for licensors and licensees. The highlight of his long, happy career was in 1999 when he was elected to the Licensing Hall of Fame, the highest honor of the licensing industry. Jack loved life! He was known for his wonderful, abundant sense of humor, his gravelly voice and his signature bow ties. He was passionate about old movies, international travel, convertibles, the Phillies, golf, and food ""I never met a food I didn't like."" He was voted one of the ""worst, most-avid golfers"" in Golf Digest. One of the highlights of his personal life was the delight he took as ""Santa Claus"" in the annual Philadelphia Thanksgiving Day Parade, a role he played for almost two decades, growing his own beard for the part! All year round he was known as ""Santa Jack."" A lover of all things theatrical, he belonged for 25 years to the Players Club in Gramercy Park, New York City. Weissman was a life-long active member of Sigma Alpha Rho, a national Jewish high school fraternity dedicated to community service. In SAR as a young man, he proudly served as Supreme Exalted Ruler. He was a career-long active member of Two Ten Footwear Foundation, the charitable arm of the shoe industry. In Palm Beach, he served as President and Board Member of his condominium association and was an active member of the Citizens Association of Palm Beach.

2012-09-09T00:00:00Z,"To Robert Sullivan, history is not so much a collection of dates and facts but actual places you can revisit - layers of geography that can be excavated one by one. Sullivan's seventh book, "" My American Revolution "" (Farrar, Straus & Giroux, $26), chronicles his quest through some of America's chaotic birthplaces, parts of New Jersey and New York where forgotten battles still haunt the landscape. His journey begins at the top of the Empire State Building, where Sullivan looks into the distance and sees greater New York as a ""palimpsest of the Revolution, a painted-over canvas of ancient routes walked smooth. . . . "" Much of Sullivan's historical sallying is done on foot, or, occasionally, by boat. He follows the routes marked on colonial maps, camps outside old taverns in freezing weather and often arouses the suspicion of local police by hiking along highways and through industrial wastes. There's something charmingly boyish about his adventures: ""I began to work like a scout,"" he writes, calling his trips ""reconnaissance missions."" He walks the Continental Army's path from Princeton into the Watchung Mountains of northern New Jersey, a natural fortress where Washington hid from the British, and where Sullivan severely injures his back."
2012-09-09T00:00:00Z,"It's hard to say if ''Sunday Bloody Sunday'' (1971) is a movie about the idea of wanting too much or of not wanting enough. It is, maybe, a movie about the in-between state, the place where loneliness and desire intertwine fingers without daring to commit to anything more fulfilling, or more dangerous. Glenda Jackson, a thirtyish divorcee, and Peter Finch, a fortyish physician, share the same telephone answering service and, more significant, the same lover (Murray Head, right with Ms. Jackson). He hops from one bed to another with a half-smile and a sympathetic shrug, and while his two lovers don't know each other, each is aware of the other's existence. Neither wants to lose the affection of this raffish swain, an artist who makes clever but meaningless constructions from glass pipes, colored liquids and various mechanical bits and bobs. But jealousy is never a reasonable emotion, and it circles both characters like a wraith. Ms. Jackson and Finch, as lovers who are not in love with each other, give performances of tensile delicacy. The picture -- directed by John Schlesinger and written by the onetime New Yorker film critic Penelope Gilliatt -- is lacerating, unsettling in the way it picks at subterranean emotional turmoil, until in its final moments it becomes something close to wonderful. At one point Ms. Jackson's mother (Peggy Ashcroft) tells her daughter, and not unkindly: ''You keep throwing your hand in because you haven't got the whole thing. There is no whole thing.'' By the end of ''Sunday Bloody Sunday'' Ms. Jackson and Finch's characters have finally made peace with the imperfection of whatever it is we call love. Between them they've had the whole thing, but only in bits and pieces, and never all at once. (Criterion, Oct. 23, Blu-ray, $39.95) STEPHANIE ZACHAREK"

Andrew was a leader in the international financial and banking systems. At the request of the finance ministers of the G-7 countries, he served as the first chairman of the Financial Stability Forum (now the Financial Stability Board). He also served as Chairman of Working Party 3 of the OECD, Alternate Governor of the IMF for the United Kingdom, member of the Monetary Committee of the European Union, Trustee of the International Accounting Standards Committee Foundation, member of the Group of 30, Chairman of the Per Jacobsson Foundation, member of the International Council of the China Banking Regulatory Commission, member of the International Council of the China Development Bank, Director of the International Centre for Leadership in Finance (Malaysia), and Trustee of the American University of Beirut.

(The risk of snagging? Who does that?) I'm precious about clothes and looking after them, but my husband, Alfie, who has a 40 percent share of my closet (awarded after a negotiation that rivaled the 1949 Israeli Armistice Agreements), is not. And so the co-habitation of our wardrobes - after I so meticulously designed the space with my carpenter Mario (glass drawers for easy viewing, pull-out shoe shelves, all lovingly wrapped in a very specific hue of blue leather edited down from thousands of swatches), while Alfie and our architect concerned themselves with the minor task of building the rest of the house - has been something of an education.

Ms. Gummer, the star of ''Emily Owens, M.D.,'' CW's new drama having its premiere Oct. 16, is spending most of her time on the Vancouver, British Columbia, set, while Mr. Walker, most recently in the film ''Abraham Lincoln, Vampire Hunter,'' is, as she put it, ''a little bit of all over the place,'' still riding the erratic professional waves she knows so well. But temporary separations are familiar to Ms. Gummer, who grew up coping with the demanding career of her mother, the three-time Oscar winner Meryl Streep. Having been raised largely outside Hollywood's glare in Connecticut, Ms. Gummer said she identified with her character, a smart but socially ill-at-ease neophyte surgeon. ''She's the kind of self to me that is bubbling right below, that I try to keep at bay, keep tempered all the time,'' Ms. Gummer said. ''So it's really fun to be able to take her out to play.'' Ms. Gummer, 29, doesn't worry about a career that will doubtless be compared with her mother's: ''I don't live and breathe and bleed and sweat for it. I really don't have to win an Academy Award.''"

2012-09-09T00:00:00Z,"It's a trenchant footnote that one of the great lost romantic comedies is a picture so disliked by its writer-director that she sought to have her name removed from it. In ''A New Leaf'' (1971), the directorial debut of Elaine May, Walter Matthau plays a spoiled heir who, after running through all his money, alights on the idea of finding, marrying and then offing a woman of means; his target is Ms. May (above, with Matthau), as a brainy but dippy botanist who also happens to be very rich. When Matthau, wooing her with great calculation, asks her to tell him about her life, her hopes and her dreams, Ms. May obliges haltingly, her eyes alight with eager optimism: ''My hope is to discover a new variety of fern that has never been described or classified.'' She waits a beat and continues: ''I don't know what my dream is. Do you think it could be the same as my hope?'' That's the kind of deadpan doozy Ms. May had been known for as one half, with Mike Nichols, of a late-'50s, early-'60s comedy team. ''A New Leaf'' is filled with gags that shimmer with the same kind of subtle brilliance, jokes that seem headed straight for the outer limits of the galaxy until they boomerang, with a resounding zing, back to earth. (When Matthau first learns he's become penniless, he wanders the streets of New York bidding goodbye to all his overgrown-rich-kid haunts, tracing the letters on the awning of Lutèce with the fingertips of a departing lover.) Ms. May's original cut was reportedly some three hours long and included two murders; its structure and tone must have been very different from the only version of the picture the world has ever seen, and the one that appears on this DVD. But the ''New Leaf'' we've got is so much better than none at all, with Ms. May's genius, gentle as a butterfly's wing and efficient as a nutcracker, on full display. It's a model of what latter-day romantic comedies could be, if only they'd harness brains to their hopes and dreams. (Olive Films, Sept. 4, Blu-ray $29.95, DVD $24.95) STEPHANIE ZACHAREK"

Would-be fleet buyers of the XTS have grander designs on the sedan, and judging by a photo posted recently to the Web site of G.M.'s fleet and commercial division, General Motors is happy to oblige them. There, the XTS is depicted in three distinct guises -- livery sedan, limousine and hearse -- suggesting that the XTS is primed to inherit the mantle vacated by the DTS full-size sedan, the brand's former fleet chameleon, that ended production this year."

''Thousands of people go to the amusement park and never walk the three blocks into the neighborhood,'' she said. ''There was just so much life there that I didn't know existed.''

At Vergennes Laundry, the bakery Jones opened in 2010 with her French husband, Didier Murat, in a former laundromat in Vergennes, Vt., all tarts are made to order with the freshest seasonal ingredients. Summer brings berries or tomatoes; the spring months asparagus with goat cheese and mint. In fall and winter it's Gilfeather turnips, potatoes, rosemary and crème fraîche. Jones won't use glaze, and she insists on an open kitchen. ''I prefer that somebody can see the tart as I'm making it,'' she says. ''They see the bag of potatoes or the crate of berries. They see the wheel of cheese.'' Though Jones and Murat are also renowned for their slow-rise bread and nougat, a few locals have yet to register the boulangerie. ''We still have people come in with their laundry bags from time to time,'' Murat says."

Ms. Adler and the show's co-creator, Ryan Murphy, saw a clip of a woman verbally decimating her foes. ''Her takedowns were so hypnotic,'' Ms. Adler said. The clip was not from a scripted drama but ''Celebrity Apprentice,'' and the contestant was NeNe Leakes, best known from Bravo's ''Real Housewives of Atlanta.'' Now Ms. Leakes, 44, has landed something most of her genre peers only dream of (or grasp at): a regular role on '' The New Normal ,'' a comedy created by Ms. Adler and Mr. Murphy and starting Tuesday on NBC. But ''Real Housewives'' was not Ms. Leakes's first foray in showbiz. An aspiring actress, she flew to Los Angeles for pilot season for years, chasing roles while her husband, Gregg (they have since separated but are close), stayed with their son. Then ''Glee'' came, and ''New Normal,'' about a gay pair trying to become parents. As an assistant, Rocky, Ms. Leakes plays opposite Ellen Barkin as a racist grandmother. Now, she shuttles between Hollywood and Atlanta. (''Housewives'' faces Season 5.) ''I feel odd coming back,'' she said. Referring to script pages like a pro, she added: ''I'm always looking for my sides and my trailer. But I'm going back into my house.'' MEGAN ANGELO"

She was prepping for a chemistry read with Gabriel Mann , who plays Nolan, the heroine Emily Thorne's henchman. With Jennifer Jason Leigh joining the cast as Emily's mother, Mike Kelley, the show's creator and executive producer, felt Nolan needed someone new to play with as well. Enter the Pakistani-American Ms. Vadsaria, who had appeared in the film '' 30 Minutes or Less '' and starred on the ABC Family series '' Greek .'' Now she knows the scope of the ''Revenge'' fan base: ''One person tweeted at me: 'Welcome to the Hamptons -- good luck getting out.' ''"

Artworks by friends and treasures culled from vintage stores and antique markets around the world stand in for formal décor. ''Everything in the house is connected to us personally,'' McGee says. As much can be said of his no-frills fashion sense. ''Some of my favorite pieces are from thrift shops. When I find something I really love, I live, work and sleep in it.'' Some things, however, he'd sooner let go of. Asked about his current midcareer retrospective at the Berkeley Art Museum, he says, ''It's very intense to go back to the past and revive work that I've already experienced and moved forward from. It's like seeing an old girlfriend -- awkward at times, nostalgic at times and downright maddening and embarrassing.''"

Mary Jane served for more than 20 years as a Director of Wahl Clipper Corporation, the world's largest manufacturer of electric hair clippers, founded by her father in 1919. Mary Jane was a generous supporter of many charities, including Covenant House, where she volunteered for many years, and The Sharing Foundation, which cares for severely disadvantaged and orphaned children in Cambodia. The family is deeply indebted to her extraordinary caregivers, who kept her smiling and comfortable throughout her illness: Ann, Kathy, Marylynne, Maureen, and Kathleen.

2012-09-09T00:00:00Z,"A COUPLE of years ago K. MICHELLE seemed like a possible heir to the throne of Mary J. Blige. A deeply able singer with a penchant for overemoting and high anxiety, she detailed the wages of torturous love as well as anyone around. But despite a handful of strong singles she never released an album and appeared to fade away. Her recent return has been improbable. She may have found her ideal creative role as the spitfire character on the uproarious, toxic and riveting VH1 reality show ''Love & Hip-Hop: Atlanta.'' She's been a reliable troublemaker, sparring with other cast members, and also the show's most bruised star, reliving what she describes as abuse at the hands of an ex. While many of her peers on the show are reality stars first, and maybe solely, K.

2012-09-09T00:00:00Z,"Is work good or bad? With unemployment such a pressing national concern, it may seem a fatuous question. Even apart from current worries, the goodness of work is deep in our culture. We applaud people for their work ethic, judge our economy by its productivity and even honor work with a national holiday. But there's an underlying ambivalence: we celebrate Labor Day by not working, the Book of Genesis says work is punishment for Adam's sin and many of us see a contented retirement as the only reason for working."

The investor was responsible for an investment pool of $4.5 million for the musical, more than one third of its $12 million capitalization costs for Broadway, according to the producers, who declined to divulge the investor's name. The investor, who lived in Europe, had been expected to provide $2 million for the show, and he had also secured pledges totaling $2.5 million from three other people. That money is still being sought as well. One of the ""Rebecca"" producers, Ben Sprecher, left for Britain on Sunday to continue the estate negotiations."
2012-09-10T00:00:00Z,"Fittingly for a festival where about half the titles in the official competition had religious themes, the 69th Venice Film Festival awarded its top prize, the Golden Lion, to ""Pieta,"" a mother-and-son drama with a sadistic streak from the prolific Korean director Kim Ki-duk. The film sharply divided critics - as do most of Mr. Kim's confrontational movies - but it was deemed the best of the 18 competitors by a jury led by the filmmaker Michael Mann. Other members of the jury included the actress Samantha Morton, the filmmakers Matteo Garrone and Pablo Trapero and the artist Marina Abramovic. There was some confusion at the awards ceremony Saturday evening, at which the special jury prize and the Silver Lion for best director were apparently presented in the wrong order - and to the wrong people. A festival press release confirmed that the best director prize went to Paul Thomas Anderson for his hotly anticipated new film, ""The Master."" The film's leads, Philip Seymour Hoffman and Joaquin Phoenix , shared the best actor prize. (Mr. Seymour Hoffman accepted both awards, his collaborators having already made their way to Toronto, the next stop on the festival circuit.)"

The No. 1 movie was a holdover: ""The Possession"" (Lionsgate) took in an estimated $9.5 million, for a two-week total of about $33.3 million, according to Hollywood.com , which compiles box-office data. The Weinstein Company's ""Lawless"" was second, selling about $6 million in tickets, for a two-week total of $23.5 million.

(13) DAS RHEINGOLD PBS is broadcasting Wagner's complete Ring cycle for the first time in more than two decades in a staging for the Metropolitan Opera by the Canadian director Robert Lepage that features a 45-ton set of 24 rotating planks nicknamed ''the machine.'' The story begins as the evil dwarf Alberich (Eric Owens) steals gold from the Rhine to forge a ring of unimaginable power. Bryn Terfel (above right, with Mr. Owens) sings the role of Wotan, the king of the gods, who uses magic to steal the ring, leading Alberich to put a curse on it, guaranteeing misery for its possessor. Wotan's refusal to part with the ring leads him to break a contract with the giants who have built the gods' new castle in the sky in exchange for Freia (Wendy Bryn Harmer), the goddess of love and the sister of Fricka, Wotan's wife (Stephanie Blythe). ''In many ways, even with all the high-tech elements, Mr. Lepage's production is fairly traditional,'' despite ''breathtaking stage tricks,'' Anthony Tommasini wrote in The New York Times, saying that he had ''mixed feelings'' about Mr. Lepage's work. Still, Mr. Tommasini added, he ''deserves credit for coaxing vivid portrayals from his cast.'' The three remaining operas in the cycle will be shown nightly through Friday. 6:35 A.M.

He was predeceased by Diana, his loving wife of 57 years. Eli was born in Zarki, Poland. At age 14, he joined the Jewish underground, serving in the dangerous role of courier to the ghettos in western Poland. Together with his mother and younger brother and sister, he survived the war with the help of two Christian families who hid them from the Nazis. His father was murdered during the war. Identifying opportunities and stepping in wherever he was needed became the foundation of his communal and business careers. Following liberation he rescued 100 Holocaust orphans, leading them to the DP camp in Feldafing, Germany, where he established a model youth center. Identifying such opportunities, in the face of seemingly insurmountable odds, he triumphed brilliantly. He came to the United States in 1952 and began by peddling camera parts and within a decade he became president of Sheaffer Pen Latin America. Eli was in the forefront of Holocaust Remembrance in the United States. His remarkable journey from survivor to entrepreneur to communal leader led him to: Open the door to resumption of diplomatic relations between Israel and Poland following the Six-Day War; Inaugurate the first synagogue-based Yom Hashoah (Holocaust Remembrance Day) in 1964; Organize the first umbrella organization of Holocaust survivors in 1970; Publish Martyrdom and Resistance, the first newspaper devoted to Holocaust issues; Establish the world's first academic chair in Holocaust studies at Yeshiva University; Found and chair the American & International Societies for Yad Vashem, an organization with 50,000 members that has raised over $100 million for Yad Vashem; Establish the Diana Zborowski Center for the Study of the Aftermath of the Shoah at Yad Vashem. To ensure the memory of the Holocaust in the future, Eli spearheaded the Young Leadership Associates of the American Society for Yad Vashem that will shepherd the cause of remembrance from generation to generation. He is survived by his wife, Dr. Elizabeth Mundlak Zborowski, his children, Dr. Lilly Zborowski Naveh and Murry Zborowski, his grandchildren, Ori, Tamar, Maya, Shira, Omer, Boaz, Ariel, Zohar, and Erez, his brother Marvin, and his sister Tzila.

Eagerly-awaited movies like Ben Affleck's ""Argo"" (which earned good word-of-mouth at a sneak preview at the Telluride Film Festival last month ) delivered, earning a standing ovation at its packed premiere on Friday. Reviews called the film, about the Iranian hostage crisis in the 1970s, Mr. Affleck's coming-of-age moment as an actor-director. At the after-party last week, Mr. Affleck was jovial, ordering pizza and chatting with friends like Matt Damon, John Krasinski and Emily Blunt late into the night. He talked eagerly about shooting at CIA headquarters in Langley, Va., but admitted to some worry that the geo-political theme would make the film ""challenging"" to market. ""I'm working harder to promote this movie,"" he said. ""I can furnish you with endless"" material. (We will expect it.) The two big-budget, big-expectation tentpoles, "" Cloud Atlas "" (from the Wachowski siblings and Tom Tykwer, distributed by Warner) and "" The Master "" (from Paul Thomas Anderson, and released by the Weinstein Company) had audiences waiting for hours and industry speculating.

Martha has been renamed Marcy May by Patrick (John Hawkes), the leader of the cult who initiates female acolytes into the group by drugging and raping them. (Marlene is the all-purpose pseudonym female cult members use when answering the phone.) But life with Lucy and Ted has its own difficulties, and Patrick's teachings aren't easily purged. ''Ms. Olsen's performance is both the key to the film and the source of its sometimes frustrating opacity,'' A. O. Scott wrote in The New York Times. But the cutting back and forth between Patrick's farm and Ted and Lucy's middle-class dream ''starts to seem like a trick, and the ingenuity of the movie's structure begins to feel evasive rather than probing,'' he said. ''The drama is all in the jumps and juxtapositions, rather than in any sustained consideration of Martha's experience. She remains a blank space in the middle of a film that is an impressive piece of work without achieving quite the emotional impact it intends.'' 10 A.M.

Writing in The New York Times, Anthony Tommasini called this five-hour production, presented here by ''Great Performances at the Met,'' ''the most theatrically effective staging of the four works in this epic series, and the clearest representation of the director Robert Lepage's vision.'' Still, he said of the 45-ton mechanical set at the center of the cycle, ''Part of me wanted to see the machine collapse into a heap of smoldering planks at the end of the Immolation Scene, which would have been appropriate.'' 9:15 A.M. (MoreMax) THE ADJUSTMENT BUREAU (2011) Matt Damon, his toothy grin hinting at a young Robert F. Kennedy, portrays David Norris, a Democratic son of Brooklyn and a favorite in the New York race for the United States Senate. That is, until a damaging photo from his past does in his campaign, and he meets Elise (Emily Blunt), a dancer who innocently causes him to veer off the path that a team of mystery men have secretly plotted for him. Their plan does not include Emily, or free will on David's part, for that matter. Now he must decide whether to give in to their machinations -- or reclaim his life. If George Nolfi, who directed this film and wrote the screenplay, based on a short story by Philip K.

2012-09-14T00:00:00Z,"The Metropolitan Opera is going downtown. The Met has arranged with Le Poisson Rouge , the high-art cabaret space in Greenwich Village, to present two concerts based on Met productions of two contemporary operas: ""The Tempest"" by Thomas Adès and Nico Muhly's ""Two Boys."" The collaboration gives the Met some visibility in the slightly hipper, younger and more contemporary music scene, and adds big-institution luster to Le Poisson Rouge, which has become firmly established as a New York concert site. The Met often collaborates with major institutions like Juilliard, the Metropolitan Museum of Art and the Museum of Modern Art but rarely with such a small fish. ""It seemed like a good idea, as a way of educating the audience and reaching out to a new audience, to have performances down there,"" Peter Gelb, the Met's general manager, said. Mr. Gelb said the first performance, on Oct. 26, would involve a few cast members of ""The Tempest"" and Mr. Adès as pianist performing scaled-down numbers from the opera. The concert will include works by Ives, Purcell, Stravinsky and Tippett, with other instrumentalists joining in, a spokesman later added. Mr. Muhly will play and program the second concert in May. Mr. Gelb said the Met was paying for the performances and would split the ticket take with Le Poisson Rouge."

2012-09-14T00:00:00Z,"COX--John P. John P. Cox, 65, died on September 12 from complications following a stroke. Until recently he was Vice-President and Chief Information Officer for the Hospital for Special Surgery. His gregariousness, warmth, generosity, and fun-loving sense of humor will be deeply missed by his family, friends, and colleagues who adored him greatly. His contributions to the Hospital for Special Surgery, built upon his being at the forefront of the transition to computer technology in hospitals, have greatly benefitted that institution and will be felt for years to come. The greatest day in John's productive and impactful life occurred in January 1969 when, as an adventurous student at Columbia he met a buoyant, vivacious student from Skidmore College, Diane Dow. In less than a year they were married and Diane has been his life-long mooring, beginning with moving to Charleston, South Carolina where John was a Lieutenant J.G. in the United States Navy, an experience which greatly added to his knowledge and skill with all things nautical that had been developed over his childhood years in the waters of the St. Lawrence River. John is survived by his beloved wife and soul-mate Diane, his devoted children, Sarah and Tyler, his son-in-law, Tom Francis, his cherished eight-month old granddaughter, Eliot Jane, and his fond brothers Holly and David. And his spirit will remain in the hearts of everyone who has been fortunate enough to know him. A funeral service will be held at the First Presbyterian Church in the City of New York located at 12 West 12th Street, where John was an elder, on Sunday, September 16th at 4pm. Contributions in his memory to the Information Technology Department for the Hospital for Special Surgery (535 East 70th Street, New York City) would be fitting."

A member of the MBA Class of 1980, Bob went on to have an extraordinary career as one of the original partners of Wasserstein Perella Management Partners before founding the private equity firm Veritas Capital. He once remarked to Dean Nitin Nohria that the daily discipline of analyzing three cases a day at HBS enabled him to tackle any problem under intense time constraints and sometimes with only limited information. As a result, he said he was forever grateful to the School and over the years was a great benefactor, establishing a fellowship fund in honor of his 25th Reunion that helped military personnel attend HBS. He also continued to take a leadership role in alumni events and initiatives. As co-chair of his 30th Reunion, for example, he led a fundraising effort that set a new 30th Reunion record, securing $17 million in support of the School and creating a legacy for his Class that will last for years to come. Bob became increasingly interested in the intersection of business and government and how private companies can do work in support of government-related services. To this end, he established a fund at HBS that will support research, curriculum development, and case writing , as well as publications and symposia on this important subject. We all are saddened by the loss of this accomplished and generous alumnus - an outstanding gentleman and businessperson who personified Harvard Business School's mission of educating leaders who make a difference in the world. Bob McKeon was a force for good in everything he did. We will miss him greatly."

Until recently he was Vice-President and Chief Information Officer for the Hospital for Special Surgery. His gregariousness, warmth, generosity, and fun-loving sense of humor will be deeply missed by his family, friends, and colleagues who adored him greatly. His contributions to the Hospital for Special Surgery, built upon his being at the forefront of the transition to computer technology in hospitals, have greatly benefitted that institution and will be felt for years to come. The greatest day in John's productive and impactful life occurred in January 1969 when, as an adventurous student at Columbia he met a buoyant, vivacious student from Skidmore College, Diane Dow. In less than a year they were married and Diane has been his life-long mooring, beginning with moving to Charleston, South Carolina where John was a Lieutenant J.G. in the United States Navy, an experience which greatly added to his knowledge and skill with all things nautical that had been developed over his childhood years in the waters of the St. Lawrence River. John is survived by his beloved wife and soul-mate Diane, his devoted children, Sarah and Tyler, his son-in-law, Tom Francis, his cherished eight-month old granddaughter, Eliot Jane, and his fond brothers Holly and David. And his spirit will remain in the hearts of everyone who has been fortunate enough to know him. A funeral service will be held at the First Presbyterian Church in the City of New York located at 12 West 12th Street, where John was an elder, on Sunday, September 16th at 4pm.

The President and Board of Trustees of Montefiore Medical Center and the entire Montefiore family are deeply saddened by the passing of our dear friend and cherished colleague, Leopold G. Koss, MD, Chairman Emeritus of the Department of Pathology of Montefiore Medical Center and Professor, Albert Einstein College of Medicine. Dr. Koss was a world-renowned physician and cytopathologist, researcher, author, teacher and mentor, whose association with Montefiore began in 1973. Always an advocate for innovation, Dr. Koss led the Department of Pathology for more than 20 years where he created an unforgettable academic legacy. He made indelible contributions to our understanding of human disease patterns, particularly in the area of gynecological pathology and trained hundreds of pathologists during his career. He was a true translational researcher before the term became popular. He would see the pathology clinically and then ask questions, design experiments and search for mechanisms. He passed this on to his trainees especially nurturing those that had, as he called it, a fire in the belly to understand human disease by doing research. Born in Poland in 1920, he earned a medical degree at the University of Bern in Switzerland after the war and shortly thereafter came to the United States where he served at numerous prestigious medical institutions before joining Montefiore and Einstein. Our heartfelt condolences are extended to his three sons, Andrew, Michael and Richard, and his four grandchildren. Steven M. Safyer, MD President and CEO, Montefiore Medical Center Allen M.

2012-09-15T00:00:00Z,"Did you forget to set the alarm on your iPhone to wake you up with a gentle marimba ringtone at 3 a.m. Eastern Daylight Time Friday? If so, your chances of getting the iPhone 5 early became a little dimmer. In the wee hours of Friday, Apple started letting people order the iPhone 5 from its online store. It took only an hour for Apple's site to change its shipping estimates for the product to two weeks. By Friday evening, the Apple store had changed the shipping estimate to two to three weeks. People who managed to submit their orders early were told they would receive their phones on Sept. 21, the day the iPhone 5 is officially available. The change in delivery times is a sign that Apple's online store burned through its initial inventory quickly, forcing customers who ordered later to wait. ''Pre-orders for iPhone 5 have been incredible,'' said Natalie Kerris, an Apple spokeswoman. ''We've been completely blown away by the customer response.'' Supplies at Apple's wireless carrier partners in the United States seemed to hold up a bit longer, but eventually they, too, began giving customers longer shipping estimates."

He was an extraordinarily compassionate and generous person, a loving husband and father, a devoted son and sibling, and a cherished friend. Mr. McKeon was born to Diana Brady McKeon and Donald Stillwell McKeon in Bronx, NY on August 6, 1954. From an early age, Robert displayed a deep love for learning and a hard working, industrious spirit. He graduated magna cum laude from Fordham University with a B.S. in Economics and received his MBA from Harvard Business School. His constant intellectual curiosity, his integrity, and his passion for the pursuit of knowledge underpinned a distinguished business career that began at First Boston Corporation in the Mergers and Acquisitions Group. He then went on to become a founding partner of Wasserstein Perella & Co., where he served as the Chairman of Wasserstein Perella Management Partners. In 1992, he founded Veritas Capital, a private equity firm based in New York. As Chairman and Managing Partner, he led the firm's exceptional growth and success and served on the boards of many of the firm's portfolio companies. Under his leadership, Veritas Capital achieved amongst the very highest and consistent returns for its investors in the industry. Mr. McKeon realized his good fortune in finding a career that he loved and always encouraged his children to pursue their own dreams, once referring to the ancient Greek ethos that happiness is the use of your talents along the lines of excellence. Mr. McKeon pursued a diverse range of interests that reflected his intellectual curiosity, love of life, and spirit of adventure. He was an avid art and book collector, loved music, was a voracious reader, and an enthusiastic painter. He loved walking, jogging, skiing, shooting, tennis, and horseback riding. He traveled extensively with his family and particularly loved the natural beauty of East Hampton, Telluride, and the English countryside. He was a generous supporter of his alma maters, including his high school Albertus Magnus, and served on the board of trustees at Fordham University. In 2005, he established The Robert B. McKeon Fellowship Fund for Military Personnel at Harvard University. He was a member of the Council on Foreign Relations, where he endowed The Robert B. McKeon Endowment Series on Military Strategy and Leadership. Mr. McKeon was appointed by the Governor of Connecticut to serve as Chairman of the state's Health and Educational Facilities Authority, a public authority that finances hospitals and universities in Connecticut. For those who were privileged to know Bob, he will be profoundly missed and will remain a source of inspiration and love forever.

2012-09-15T00:00:00Z,"9 P.M. (Starz) A DANGEROUS METHOD (2011) A disturbed young Russian, Sabina Spielrein (Keira Knightley), is delivered to a clinic in Zurich in the early 20th century, where a doctor named Carl Jung (Michael Fassbender) performs a new treatment called psychoanalysis to help her. Soon she becomes his lover and finally a colleague. But as emotionally connected as Sabina is to Jung, it is with his mentor, Sigmund Freud (Viggo Mortensen, above left, with Mr. Fassbender), that she finds a more cerebral affinity. Writing in The New York Times, A. O. Scott called this film from David Cronenberg, based on a play by its screenwriter, Christopher Hampton, and drawn from a book by John Kerr, a ''subtle and intellectually thrilling true story.'' The movie ''is full of ideas about sexuality -- some quite provocative, even a century after their first articulation -- but it also recognizes and communicates the erotic power of ideas,'' he said. ''There are scenes of kinky activity between Sabina and Jung that will no doubt enjoy long life in specialized corners of the Internet, but the most unsettling aspect of 'A Dangerous Method' may be the links it suggests between sex and thinking.

''Such an endowment,'' he says, ''would provide for annual tuition payments of $5,000 for each student for four years, growing annually at the rate of inflation for higher education.'' Forbes magazine estimates that 57 billionaires live in the city. Mayor Bloomberg himself has donated more than $2.4 billion to favorite causes, and in 2013 Columbia University will finish a $5 billion fund-raising campaign, bringing in $1 billion more than its initial goal. So the money for a New York Promise is probably out there, but it would require one of the world's biggest philanthropic efforts. -- t.c.f."

2012-09-16T00:00:00Z,"A FEW years ago, Dr. Marcus M. Reidenberg, head of the clinical pharmacology department at Weill Cornell Medical College in Manhattan, was walking past a construction site on East 69th Street, near the school, when he saw an ironworker in a yellow hard hat covered with a collage of patriotic stickers. ''It just hit me,'' Dr. Reidenberg, who is 78 and an amateur photographer, recalled. ''I was so intrigued by how these men used their hats as billboards to express their thoughts to the world.'' Thus was born a photographic project -- part portraiture, part blue-collar fashion shoot -- that has led to more than 100 images of workingmen in hard hats, including the excavator with the union sticker and the engineer whose hat bears the slogan ''Fix My Head.'' Inspired by the French photographer Eugène Atget, who photographed workers on the streets of Paris a century ago, Dr. Reidenberg has taken pictures of painters, welders, Teamsters, plumbers, carpenters, bricklayers, insulation workers and blasting-powder carriers -- all of them in uniquely decorated head wear."

2012-09-16T00:00:00Z,"I came out of the womb scratching. Mitts had to be put on my hands so I would stop clawing my skin. When I was seven and got mad I would bite myself, raising welts on my arms. This was already well into the time when I would have to touch certain spots on the cabinets, on the sidewalk, with my fingers and toes. At 12, after a seriously traumatic event, I began to pull out my hair. Every day since then, for the past 18 years, the hairs on my body have gone one by one, in the thousands, as I have tried to cope with overwhelming anxiety from a chaotic series of experiences that from birth have made me feel inside as if my very life is at stake if I do not pick and pull and bite and scratch. This is what anxiety does, the anxiety that comes from being a sensitive being in an insensitive world. We are taught when we are young that life will be fair, good guys will win, that if we are well behaved we won't suffer, that out there for each of us is some perfect stranger who will swoop in with armor and save us, some fictional man or woman who will make everything - all the assaults and sorrows, traumas and disappointments - O.K. But it is painful to be born, to literally be pushed out from a tiny canal, crushed so that we can live. When we arrive the world is bright and harsh and loud. Strangers fondle our bodies as though we asked them to and then we are given to one, maybe two, people, our parents, who are supposed to love one another and us. Often some part of that equation is lacking and that becomes confusing because when the blind trust between child and parent gains sight and we see things as they really are, when we see the disappointed tears of one parent, hear the screams of another, when the reality starts to come into focus and we realize that what we believed was real never was and that trust is a candy peddled by strangers, it becomes too much to bear."

But as exciting as his play was, there remains the question of how he would fit in the majors now that stolen bases are largely a thing of the past. Through Friday, the Angels' Mike Trout was leading the American League with 45 stolen bases. The National League leader, the Braves' Michael Bourn, had 39. If Trout's rate slows - he is currently on pace for 50 - baseball would probably have just its second season without a 50-steals player since 1963."

The movie drips with prewar romantic fatalism whose emblem could be Michèle Morgan's Nelly, hands stuffed into the pockets of her trench coat, its folds catching the light just so. The restoration gives renewed clarity and luster to the black-and-white mist-slicked night world of Le Havre, where Jean Gabin's runaway soldier holes up at Panama's, a waterfront dive housing a collection of misfits. Better a misfit, though, than a bourgeois creep, like Michel Simon's shopkeeper, or a bourgeois rebel like Pierre Brasseur's cowardly gangster."

And it would prohibit marketing ""such food, or other processed food, as 'natural.'

2012-09-16T00:00:00Z,"WITH ''DEATH AND THE CIVIL WAR,'' an installment of PBS's ''American Experience'' on Tuesday night (check local listings), what hits you early on is a breathtaking figure that is even more startling so close to the anniversary of the Sept. 11 attacks. To lose the same proportion of the population today as died in the Civil War, the historian Drew Gilpin Faust says, would mean seven million deaths. Everyone remembers how deeply those 2001 losses traumatized the nation; it is almost impossible to imagine the effects that the Civil War casualties must have had on Americans of the 1860s. The program is interested not in the troop movements and changes in commanders that preoccupy most Civil War documentaries, but in how the country reacted to the shocking death toll. When the war began, it notes, the infrastructure for dealing with mass death -- including the simple notion that the government has an obligation to notify families when a soldier is killed -- was not in place. Nor were psychological coping mechanisms. Society had an ideal of dignified death: peaceful, at home, surrounded by loved ones. The gruesome deaths on Civil War battlefields must have been quite a jolt to the collective American mind."

2012-09-16T00:00:00Z,"FOR worshipers of Mozart's Serenade No. 10 for 13 instruments, the ''Gran Partita,'' this concert sounds as if it falls somewhere between sacrilege and gimmick. But maybe we should give it a chance. The ST. LUKE'S CHAMBER ENSEMBLE'S superb wind players are performing the work's seven movements interspersed with Ligeti's Six Bagatelles for wind quintet. The ''Gran Partita'' is a glorious piece for pairs of oboes, clarinets, basset horns (lower members of the clarinet family) and bassoons, as well as four French horns and a double bass. The Ligeti work is charming, engaging and extremely well made, but from an entirely different universe. If anything, the rich sonorities of the dark, flute-less larger wind grouping may lay bare the sparse texture of the wind quintet combination. The organizers suggest that the millisecond of surprise at hearing an unexpected movement will help the audience hear ''just music and not something old, new, standard or nonstandard.'' Maybe. On the other hand, ''just Mozart'' is pretty good too. With set design by Anne Patterson, a visual artist, and lighting design by Matt Frey. 8 p.m. Thursday and Friday, Baryshnikov Arts Center, 450 West 37th Street, Manhattan; (866) 811-4111, bacnyc.org ; $25."

The invitation - to an intimate evening with the museum's president - was addressed to a good friend of mine. It certainly seemed like an extravagant perk, but his $100 membership renewal was coming due. Maybe times were tough, he reasoned, and the museum was rolling out the red carpet to keep even its smallest contributors. He replied that he would be delighted to attend. But there was another name on the invitation, one he didn't recognize. Could he bring someone else - his friend Jon Methven - instead? Of course he could; the Met sent a confirmation on official museum letterhead."

Images of sand dunes and ballerinas performing ''The Arabian Nights'' were on the designer's mood board. ''We've never built a piece with embroidery in mind before,'' said Mr. Altuzarra (pictured left), pointing to the series of dresses that were inspired, more specifically, by a scene from the film ''Orlando'' in which the protagonist wakes up as a woman in a Tuareg desert tribe. The dress he was fitting that day is one of these. ''It's incredibly complicated to hand-sew it all: no two will be alike,'' he said of the curious conglomeration of peplumed striped linens, blue silk covered in Swarovski crystals and sunburst embroideries, and gold-plated tassels glistening from every end. ''Usually you find these very elaborate and delicate embroideries on silks and very couture fabrics,'' Mr. Altuzarra said, ''but I wanted to try it on nubby and hand-woven cottons.''

2012-09-16T00:00:00Z,"Before it became the highest form of culinary praise to describe something as ''trés Brooklyn,'' before the resonance of a sentence like ''X is a writer living in Brooklyn'' could be lost on virtually no one, there was the work of Paula Fox. Beloved when she arrived on the scene, Ms. Fox was forgotten, and then her work was cultishly pored over at the dawn of the new millennium. It is high time that the Big City Book Club read her most-celebrated novel, ''Desperate Characters,'' published in 1970.

Will saving these trifles make anyone rich in the future? It doesn't seem likely. What might be considered a prime find now -- an 1864 campaign pin for Abraham Lincoln's re-election, as the Civil War raged -- is valued at less than $1,000 .

Born in Gdansk, Poland in 1920, Leo (as he was known to all who loved him) miraculously survived the Holocaust and became a refugee in Switzerland where he finished the medical studies he had started in Vienna before the War and continued in Brussels and Montpellier. When he arrived in New York in 1947 with his wife and baby son and $20 in his pocket, he spoke no English. Yet, with his prodigious intellect and devotion to science, he rose to the top of his field in his adopted country. He was a pioneer in the field of Cytopathology and was the author of the seminal book on the subject, ""Diagnostic Cytology and It's Histopathologic Bases,"" which appeared in five editions and was recently translated into Chinese. Over his long career, he also wrote numerous other medical books and hundreds of scientific papers. Dr. Koss was chairman emeritus of the Department of Pathology at Montefiore Hospital and the Albert Einstein College of Medicine, which was renamed in his honor. He will be remembered by all who knew him as a man of great intelligence, culture and wit. He was a gifted storyteller who could, depending on his audience, recite French love poetry, sing bawdy ditties or quote Caesar's Gallic Wars in the original Latin.

In less than a year they were married and Diane has been his life-long mooring, beginning with moving to Charleston, South Carolina where John was a Lieutenant J.G. in the United States Navy, an experience which greatly added to his knowledge and skill with all things nautical that had been developed over his childhood years in the waters of the St. Lawrence River.

The President and Board of Trustees of Montefiore Medical Center and the entire Montefiore family are deeply saddened by the passing of our dear friend and cherished colleague, Leopold G. Koss, MD, Chairman Emeritus of the Department of Pathology of Montefiore Medical Center and Professor, Albert Einstein College of Medicine. Dr. Koss was a world-renowned physician and cytopathologist, researcher, author, teacher and mentor, whose association with Montefiore began in 1973. Always an advocate for innovation, Dr. Koss led the Department of Pathology for more than 20 years where he created an unforgettable academic legacy. He made indelible contributions to our understanding of human disease patterns, particularly in the area of gynecological pathology and trained hundreds of pathologists during his career. He was a true translational researcher before the term became popular. He would see the pathology clinically and then ask questions, design experiments and search for mechanisms. He passed this on to his trainees especially nurturing those that had, as he called it, a fire in the belly to understand human disease by doing research. Born in Poland in 1920, he earned a medical degree at the University of Bern in Switzerland after the war and shortly thereafter came to the United States where he served at numerous prestigious medical institutions before joining Montefiore and Einstein. Our heartfelt condolences are extended to his three sons, Andrew, Michael and Richard, and his four grandchildren. Steven M. Safyer, MD President and CEO, Montefiore Medical Center Allen M.

2012-09-16T00:00:00Z,"NEVER daunted by curatorial challenges, the Institute of Contemporary Art on the campus of the University of Pennsylvania in Philadelphia is tackling the first midcareer museum survey of the British artist and relational aesthetician JEREMY DELLER, known largely for socially conscious, participatory efforts that frequently delve into subcultures (rock music, for example) and push vigorously at the boundaries between art and life. ''Jeremy Deller: Joy in People,'' which opens Wednesday, will feature nearly all of his significant works to date, starting with a larger-than-life reconstruction of ''Open Bedroom'' of 1993, an exhibition that he staged in his parents' house while they were away. It includes a two-part archival installation concerning his epic film, ''Battle of Orgreave (An Injury to One is an Injury to All)'' of 2004, a gripping restaging of a violent 1984 confrontation between thousands of picketing Yorkshire miners and armed police officers, albeit with a cast of around 800. The disparate works show Mr. Deller in the various roles of producer, publisher, curator, parade organizer and cultural archivist. He will represent Britain in the 2013 Venice Biennale. 118 South 36th Street, (215) 898-7108, icaphila.org ."
2012-09-16T00:00:00Z,"ONE way to think of dance is as a set of interlocking nomadic cultures whose riches accrue, collectively and individually, in the mind and spirit. These cultures leave plenty of enduring traces, often manifested in nonmaterial forms. There is, for example, the rich network of conversations that explode ahead of and around and behind performances. Monday brings two of these. At Danspace Project the choreographer LUCINDA CHILDS will lead a discussion around works she created in the 1960s as part of the groundbreaking Judson Dance Theater movement. (She will also screen archival films -- useful but, to my mind, less compelling artifacts than memories.) The evening is part of Danspace's celebration of the 50th anniversary of Judson. 7 p.m., 131 East 10th Street, East Village, (866) 811-4111, danspaceproject.org ; $18.

2012-09-16T00:00:00Z,"IN a review of the drama ''HARPER REGAN,'' The Guardian's chief critic, Michael Billington, said the British playwright Simon Stephens writes well about ''a national vice,'' described as ''the capacity for emotional evasion.'' Mr. Stephens's play, which begins previews at the Atlantic Theater on Thursday, is about a 41-year-old woman struggling during tough economic times. In response, she simply leaves. She flees home, not telling her family. Mr. Stephens is a dizzyingly prolific dramatist who remains far less known here than in England, but that may change with this play. Of course fantasizing about running away is not exclusive to any country. It was a potent theme of the great French film ''Time Out'' and even of the recent episode of ''Louie,'' in which the title character visits his father, only to decide at the last second to run away, far away. The Atlantic is positioning itself as the New York home of Mr. Stephens, having last year presented his ''Bluebird,'' starring Simon Russell Beale. This production will star Mary McCann, a founding member of the company. 336 West 20th Street, Chelsea; (212) 279-4200, atlantictheater.org ."

In 1950, the five-star general wrote to his friend Winston Churchill: ''I have had a lot of fun since I took up, in my somewhat miserable way, your hobby of painting. I have had no instruction, have no talent, and certainly no justification for covering nice white canvas with the kind of daubs that seem constantly to spring from my brushes.''

Readers also discussed Ginia Bellafante's Big City column, which questioned whether increased charitable giving could replace cuts to government social services, as some Republican have argued.

(13) PIONEERS OF THIRTEEN For its 50th anniversary, the channel kicks off a yearlong celebration with a four-part documentary chronicling a half-century of programming through archival film footage. The first installment, ''The '60s -- Experimental Days,'' features Edward R. Murrow, above, hosting the inaugural broadcast of Channel 13/WNDT -- ''New Dimensions in Television,'' which would later evolve into WNET. It also presents clips from ''Black Journal,'' created by the producer Al Perlmutter; of Andy Warhol introducing the band the Velvet Underground; of the filmmakers Albert and David Maysles following Truman Capote after the publication of his novel ''In Cold Blood''; of a young Dustin Hoffman, a year before his breakthrough role in ''The Graduate'' (1967), performing in ''The Journey of the Fifth Horse''; and from ''Sesame Street.'' Among those interviewed are Richard Heffner, the first general manager of WNDT; the journalist Bill Moyers; the actor James Earl Jones; and Joan Ganz Cooney, a founder of the Children's Television Workshop. The remaining three episodes will be shown later in the year. 3 P.M.

After a courageous battle with a brain tumor, he spent his last days surrounded by his loving family, friends, and his devoted wife Louise ""Lulu"" Billian. Doug was born on March 13, 1928, to Elsie Adelaide (nee Bowers) and Alfred Arthur Billian in Bound Brook, NJ. His lifelong passion for scouting began as a young boy when he followed his brothers into the Boy Scouts. He attained the level of Eagle Scout with bronze, silver, and gold palms and The Order of the Arrow. Through the years he has generously supported the Boy Scouts of America to encourage what he believed contributed to his own success. After graduating from the Kellogg School of Business at Northwestern University (which he attended under the U.S. Navy Holloway Midshipman Program), Billian received his Naval commission just prior to the Korean War outbreak, serving 1950 to 1953. After a twenty-year career with the McGraw Hill Publishing Company on publications such as Purchasing Week, Aviation Week and Business Week, Doug launched Billian Publishing, Inc., in 1978, with the acquisition of Golf World magazine (sold a decade later to the New York Times Group). Subsequent acquisitions include Textile World, Art & Antiques and Boating World. Today, Billian Publishing Inc. thrives primarily serving the healthcare industry with Billian's HealthDATA, Porter Research and Healthcare IT Research (HITR). The Textile Industries Media Group is the leading resource for textile news and information from around the globe. Its international titles include Textile World, Textiles Panamericanos and Textile World Asia. The Billians supported many art shows including The Winter Antiques Show in New York, Grosvenor House Antiques Fair in London, The San Francisco Antiques Show and numerous others. Doug Billian was a member of Cherokee Town & Country Club and The University Yacht Club, and a former member of Pinehurst Country Club and Magazine Publishers Association. He was a proud lifetime member of the National Association of Eagle Scouts sponsored by fellow Scout, Astronaut Jim Lovell. He served on the Board of Trustees of The United States Golf Association, Meals on Wheels Atlanta, and as Chairman of the IFC Senior Citizens Foundation. He is survived by his devoted wife of 26 years, Louise Lindsey Billian. He is also survived by his children, Tracey Billian Krause, Martha Billian Meyer with spouse Dan, Lindsey Perkins Mullen with spouse Tim, Charles Jackson ""Jay"" Perkins, Jr. with spouse Michelle, Douglas C. Billian Jr. with spouse Jennifer, eleven grandchildren, his brother Alfred Billian Jr. of Ft. Wayne, IN, and many nieces and nephews. Doug Billian will be remembered for his incredibly high moral standards, honorable character, utmost integrity and taking pride in all you do. His unrelenting work ethic, coupled with his love of publishing and investing, contributed to his success. However, his intense belief in providing for his family drove his ambition. He taught us all by the honorable life he led and those whose lives he touched have been inspired by his example. In lieu of flowers, contributions may be made to Boy Scouts of America, Meals on Wheels Atlanta, Hospice Atlanta or your favorite charity."

2012-09-17T00:00:00Z,"HEAD--Glenn Oakes, of Madison, NJ, the former chairman and major shareholder of First Investors Consolidated Corporation (FICC), a national financial services firm based in New York City, died on Friday, September 14, 2012. He was 87. Born in Peoria, IL, in 1925, Mr. Head grew up in Springfield and attended college at the University of Illinois, Urbana-Champaign. He left his home state in 1947 when an actuarial position opened up at the Farm Bureau Life Insurance Company of Iowa. Named a Fellow of the Society of Actuaries in 1952, Mr. Head served as Chief Actuary and Director of the U.S. Life Company from 1953 until 1962. The owners of First Investors hired him in 1962 to start a life insurance company, which became First Investors Life (FIL). Mr. Head and partner David Grayson acquired control of the holding company, FICC, through a leveraged buy-out in 1968. In addition to FIL, FICC owned a broker dealer, First Investors Corporation, and an investment advisor, First Investors Management Company. Later on, Mr. Head was responsible for FICC building a transfer agent and acquiring a savings bank. When Mr. Head and Mr. Grayson acquired First Investors, it was primarily a sales organization, with $55 million in assets. Upon Mr. Head's retirement at the end of 2004, the First Investors Funds had over $6.6 billion in assets. FICC continues to thrive after being sold in early 2011. Mr. Head was a member and president of the Madison, N.J. Board of Education and his success in those slots attracted the attention of local Republicans, who encouraged him to run for mayor. Mr. Head won a three-way contest in 1972, having been elected on the promise of providing administrative excellence. As mayor, he made good on that promise with electric utility improvements, reductions in town expenses, and lower taxes. Mr. Head's interest in business began when he was a boy, working on the floor of a Dr. Pepper bottling plant and setting up bowling pins at a local bowling alley. He welcomed risk, and as a teenager bet an acquaintance that he could take apart a car engine, put it back together, and drive the car again. He won. Mr. Head's pursuits extended beyond business. He took flying lessons and earned his commercial pilot's license, eventually owning and flying a twin-engine Cessna. He bought a series of contiguous farms in Bluffs, Illinois, and flew himself out monthly to examine the soybeans and corn. When the farm grew in size and complexity, he created his own computer software to manage the accounting. Mr. Head embodied the values of honesty, thrift, loyalty, and kindness. He was plain-spoken and friendly, and judged people by the quality of their character. Mr. Head seized his interests with gusto. Having taken up tennis in his 50s, he soon dominated the courts with drop shots and lobs. He discovered Nantucket with his family in the 1970s, and considered the island a rare jewel, even though he didn't care for sand. Years later, he designed and built a house there. Mr. Head and his wife, Carol Atwood, were married in Collins, IA, in 1954. After the birth of their first child in Manhattan, they moved to Madison, NJ, and had four more children. In 2004, Mr. and Mrs. Head celebrated their 50th wedding anniversary. He is survived by his wife; his children, Kathy Head of Summit, NJ, Glenn Head, Jr. of Brooklyn, NY, Marcia Head of Cambridge, MA, Leslie Head of Short Hills, NJ, Linda Flanagan and her husband Robert of Summit, NJ; his grandchildren, Brian Smith, Jenny Smith, Julie Flanagan, Jeff Flanagan, Paul Flanagan, Kate Head, Caroline Scheer, and Jessie Scheer; and his sister Annabelle Thompson. A funeral service will be held at 10:00am on Thursday, September 20, 2012 at the Presbyterian Church of Madison, 19 Green Ave., Madison. Friends may visit at Wm. A.

This feature could make paying for things with a phone less of a hassle. (You'd swipe the phone over a device at the checkout counter.) It turns out that getting N.F.C. to work right with the new design of the iPhone wasn't even possible. Why not? Nokia's new Lumia 920 smartphone supports N.F.C., and some Android smartphones do as well. The explanation is actually quite simple.
