1898-06-26T00:00:00Z,"The woman who has just come from Key West, the woman who knows Admirals, and, more than all, who knows Hobson, was talking. ""They tell me here that I am not patriotic,"" she was saying, ""but they do not understand what war means. They see the war only from a distance; sending men off to fight does not seem to mean much to them; it sounds well, they revel in patriotism, and enjoy it."

He does not smoke or gamble, or indulge in those many so-called recreations which ultimately disturb the balance between our physical and intellectual forces -- a balance necessary to the exercise of sound judgment.

1898-07-30T00:00:00Z,"The surrender of Ponce is one of the grotesque incidents of the war.

1898-07-30T00:00:00Z,"Several months ago it was stated in THE TIMES'S SATURDAY REVIEW that its editor's favorite female character in fiction was Elizabeth Bennett. In view of Mr. Alden's recent astonishing statement in regard to people not reading Jane Austen, may I ask if the editor has changed his allegiance? Apart from Mr. Alden, perhaps a further reading of fiction, old and new, may have led to some modification of that romantic regard."

1898-07-30T00:00:00Z,"The theory that Dr. E.D. Skinner of Mineola, L.I., was shot by a burglar has been pretty generally abandoned both by the people of the village and the two detectives who are working on the case, and the view now accepted by almost every one in the neighborhood is that the deed was committed by some person who had a cause of enmity against him, or thought he had."

There is, in truth, no real reason why this should not be so; no reason why poetry should not be a profitable literary ware in the market-place of letters.

Did it bear that name when Wordsworth lived in it, or when did it get it? For, though I have tumbled about a good deal with Wordsworth, I confess my ignorance of it. Will you kindly say what may be appropriate to lighten the darkness of UN SCIOCCO."
1898-07-30T00:00:00Z,"Let us take no more credit for noble unselfishness than is justly our due. Undoubtedly we went to war to free Cuba from the dreadful rule of the Spaniard. Our pity was awakened by the sufferings of the Cubans, our indignation was aroused by the barbarism of their rulers. It is a war of humanity."

1898-07-30T00:00:00Z,Could anything be more Algerine than that performance of the Secretary of War which we chronicled yesterday? It has that peculiar blend of the ridiculous and the exasperating which is so characteristic. The detail of regiments to go to the front was presumably made by the commander at Chickamauga solely with reference to the comparative readiness and fitness of the regiments to go.

In the olden time it was not uncommon for a pious Spaniard, on dying, to defraud his earthly creditors in order that he might pay masses for the welfare of his soul -- ""make his soul his heir,"" as the Spanish say."

1898-08-07T00:00:00Z,"LONDON, Aug. 6. -- That extreme diplomatic tension exists between St. Petersburg and London is generally admitted to-day, though the officials deprecate the alarmist reports which were current yesterday.

It deals with the adventures of a London drummer, and is not as pessimistic as the work of the author found in ""Eve's Ransom"" and ""In the Year Of the Jubilee."" A love story adds a sentimental strain to the adventures."

Since Mr. Phin seems to have been led astray by noting that ""rye"" in some editions of the song was capitalized, I shall confine my remarks to this phase of the dispute."

1898-09-16T00:00:00Z,"BALTIMORE, Sept. 15. -- The Baltimores won two games from the Cincinnatis to-day. The first resulted in an easy victory as Hill was an easy mark for the home team, while Maul could not be touched. The second contest was won after an uphill struggle by the Baltimores. It took Hughes four innings to pull himself together, and in them he was not supported any too well."

Both sides profess satisfaction, and by mutual agreement no details of the deliberations are made public. The report circulated here that the American Commissioners have agreed to pay $7,000,000 for the Spanish fortifications and other property is preposterous."

1898-09-16T00:00:00Z,"The President's investigating committee is a thing of shreds and patches. The men of real competence for the work, the men whose grading would have had weight with the country, have declined to serve. They would not be sent on such a fool's errand. The President deceived himself if he supposed that LAMONT, LINCOLN, or ENDICOTT would accept places on a commission having no standing in law and no power to get at the facts."

A Chinese word meaning ""dearest love"" is convertible into ""spoiled fish"" if by mistake you dwell too long on the final syllable. Even a Jap to the manner born may blunder at times."

1898-11-06T00:00:00Z,"Suggestions of reform in the State Division of the Century Road Club of America have been generally discussed by wheelmen with a great amount of interest, especially during last week, when it was expected the element desirous of a change would take its first step. At a meeting that was held, however, the holders of radical views took no action, apparently having determined to wait until the sentiment crystallized into definite propositions."
1898-11-06T00:00:00Z,"The battle of Atbara was a severe engagement. On that occasion the Anglo-Egyptian force was 15,000, and there were 545 casualties. It was, of course, to be expected that on these figures the sentimentalist would look in with his pious exclamation of a ""battue""! There was, however, no alternative but to kill just as many dervishes as chose to fight us, and -- there was never a race that so richly deserved killing."
1898-11-06T00:00:00Z,"CHICAGO, Nov. 5. -- Dr. John Henry Barrows has received from the Trustees of Oberlin University an offer of the Presidency of that institution. He has been in Oberlin for several days conferring with the college authorities, but as yet has not responded to their offer. He expects to be at his home, 5,519 Cornell Avenue, by next Monday."
1898-11-06T00:00:00Z,"POUGHKEEPSIE, Nov. 5. -- The senior parlor opening, one of the pleasantest social events of the Vassar year, took place this afternoon. It is a custom of the college that certain rooms should be granted annually to the senior class, which uses them as private class parlors. The furnishing and opening of these rooms is attended with some ceremony."
1898-11-06T00:00:00Z,"WASHINGTON, Nov. 5. -- The Nicaragua Canal Commission, appointed by the President under an act of Congress directing a complete inquiry into this project, with particular reference to its practicability and cost, has about completed its work, and the present prospect is that the report will be handed to Secretary Hay in about a month."
1898-11-06T00:00:00Z,"The Executive Committee of Tammany Hall met at the Wigwam at 4 o'clock yesterday afternoon, and, at the conclusion of two hours' session, issued an address to the voters of New York City, saying, among other things:"
1898-11-06T00:00:00Z,"Probably the most difficult and unpleasant of the duties which the Speaker of the House of Commons is called upon to discharge is that of deciding whether an offensive personal allusion to a member, in the course of debate, is or is not a breach of Parliamentary decorum. There is no definite rule or order to guide the Speaker in this delicate matter."
1898-11-06T00:00:00Z,""" I don't know whether it is complimentary or otherwise, but I do know that it is a fact that the head of the average Washington boy is larger than that of the average boy of many other cities,"" remarked a traveling salesman for a large hat and cap manufacturing firm to a Star reporter. ""All men engaged in the hat and cap trade know it and have learned it by their business experience."

1898-11-06T00:00:00Z,"There are many curiosities through the hills and mountains of Northeastern Kentucky, the Carter Caves, the mysteries of which the half has never been told; the river that has cut its way through and under a mountain, are wonders that may be explained by science; but why men and women live to such an old age in these mountains has never been known."
1898-11-06T00:00:00Z,"PHILADELPHIA, Nov. 5. -- Political situations such as the present in Pennsylvania have been rare. Starting off with a plurality up in the hundred thousands, the Republicans felt confident of a victory without more than the usual campaign exertions."
1898-11-06T00:00:00Z,"The body of Patrick Gilligan, a sub-contractor of Brooklyn, was found yesterday in Newtown Creek, near Burroughs' brick yard, at Johnson Avenue, Williamsburg. There were more than half a dozen wounds on the body, evidently having been inflicted with a bludgeon. The body had been in the water about two days, and the fact that the man had been missing for almost a week convinced the police and Coroner Delap that Gilligan had been murdered."
1898-11-06T00:00:00Z,"In Columbus County there are seventeen negro School Committeemen, five negro Magistrates, and two negro Postmasters."
1898-11-06T00:00:00Z,"WASHINGTON, Nov. 5. -- The government of Cuba has given the Administration much concern, and its form is not yet definitely determined upon. Since the promulgation of the order designating the troops to go to Cuba there has been considerable talk at the War Department about the probable commander of the troops in Cuba, and the organization of a Government, civil and military."
1898-11-06T00:00:00Z,"CHICAGO, Nov. 5. -- The university football team has had a setback, and the prospects for its Thanksgiving game are dimmed. Wisconsin, against whom the University of Chicago men are to play, have been searching the professional reputations of their opponents with a microscope in the hope that they could break the team, which in its entirety puts up a winning game."
1898-11-06T00:00:00Z,"PARIS, Nov. 5. -- Referring to the peace negotiations between Spain and the United States, The Matin this morning says:"
1898-11-06T00:00:00Z,"BURLINGTON, Vt., Nov. 5. -- The hearing before ex-Gov. Woodbury, the War Investigating Commissioner, was continued here to-day, the testimony of Major Jenne, Surgeon of the Vermont regiment, being taken. Major Jenne was in command of the Second Division Hospital of the Third Army Corps. He testified as follows:"
1898-11-06T00:00:00Z,"CAMBRIDGE, Mass., Nov. 5. -- Harvard by a score of 10 to 0, won the football match with the University of Pennsylvania on Soldiers' Field this afternoon by her superior kicking and her ability to check Pennsylvania's ""guards back"" formation and to turn to advantage the miserable fumbling of the Quaker backs. It was a hard, clean game, fiercely contested from start to finish, and abounding in exciting and brilliant plays."
1898-11-06T00:00:00Z,"In Ecuador they sweeten coffee with crushed beeties; in Japan they give you gooseberry pie with roast duck; in Ceylon the richest people beg, and in London a man who refuses to tip a waiter runs a fair chance of getting arrested."
1898-11-06T00:00:00Z,"Oh, such gowns! such gowns! They would make an angel weep. But it would have to be a feminine angel, for no man in either this world or another can extract as a woman can a pure and unalloyed pleasure from simply looking at a beautiful gown."
1898-11-06T00:00:00Z,"A new pastor who is thought by those who know to have one of the hardest tasks before him that the average New York pastor ever undertakes, who will surprise few who know the field if he fails, and who will be a great man if he succeeds, is the Rev. Frederick B. Richards of the Fourteenth Street Presbyterian Church."
1898-11-06T00:00:00Z,I have read with great interest your editorials on the different phases of international law presented by our war with Spain. You are perfectly correct in asserting that even if the Spanish Commissioners should break off negotiations and retire from Paris there need be no fear of a renewal of hostilities.
1898-11-06T00:00:00Z,"With the work of the campaign practically closed and only the voting and the shouting to come, the local managers of both parties manifest absolute confidence in the result of Tuesday's balloting in this city. On both sides, however, there is a marked disinclination to give figures in detail, and the claims are more modest as to majorities than is usual on the eve of the election."

1898-11-06T00:00:00Z,"WILMINGTON, Del., Nov. 5. -- Surface indications point to a Democratic victory in Delaware this year. The division in the Democratic Party over the money question, which assumed such serious proportions two years ago, has almost entirely disappeared. The sole issue in the State, so far as the Democrats are concerned, is to elect a Democratic Legislature, in order to return Senator Gray and to defeat once more the Senatorial aspirations of J. Edward Addicks."
1898-11-06T00:00:00Z,"I don't know why the simple fact of being in love should deprive people of the vestige of common sense with which nature, never over generous with that rarest of blessings, has endowed them, but all by observation tends to confirm me in the opinion that it does. For example, a man I know is engaged to a Georgetown girl."
1898-11-06T00:00:00Z,"GOLF has stamped itself with marked distinctness during the season now closing as the most popular American sport of the year. Strange, that within so short a time, for golf is yet in its infancy with us, this venerable Scotch game should become the most interesting amusement for the great army of young and old Americans who seek pleasure, health and exercise."
1898-11-06T00:00:00Z,""" Inventions are mighty tricky things,"" said a New Orleans man who has made some money on ingenious mechanical contrivances. ""Even if one does strike a good idea, it is apt to be superseded with something better. Do you remember Edison's old electric pen? It came into use nearly twenty years ago, and a great many were sold."
1898-11-06T00:00:00Z,"Lord Herschell, ex-Lord High Chancellor of the United Kingdom and President of the British Commission appointed to help settle differences between our country and Canada, was the guest of honor last night at a dinner given by the Lotus Club, which was remarkable for the warm Anglo-American feeling displayed and the list of eminent speakers who graced the occasion."
1898-11-06T00:00:00Z,"Staying on a visit with Herr and Frau von Bismarck, in 1852, at the time he had succeeded Gem won Roehow as Prussian Envoy in Frankfort, I was walking one morning with my host, who had kindly undertaken to show me the R5mer, as well as some of the other sights of the venerable free town, wnen suddenly we found ourselves in the precincts of the old Ghetto."
1898-11-06T00:00:00Z,"By the indefinite postponement of the Knollwood Country Club's open tournament this week there will be none of the customary thre-day events in progress, but golf will be kept active nevertheless on many links. Election day will be particularly lively in the local golf world, and more contests have been arranged for that day than often occur during a whole week."
1898-11-06T00:00:00Z,"THERE is a wonderfully peopled stretch of country lying between Canton and Mandalay; a country thickly populated with distinct, yet related, peoples, more or less aboriginal, but little known, and of supremely curious customs."
1898-11-06T00:00:00Z,"A hundred years ago there were no temperance societies or Bands of Hope, no Rechabites, and Blue Ribbon Army. To be as ""drunk as a lord"" was the height of human felicity. It was the age of ""three-bottle men,"" of convivial toasts, of drinking songs. Even the Church indirectly encouraged intemperance."
1898-11-06T00:00:00Z,"Longevity is not the only feature of Indiana rural life. Over near the village of Argos one man at least has the distinction of weighing nearly a quarter of a ton. George Washington Walker, a farmer's son, tips the scales at 540 pounds. He stands 5 feet 10 inches, measures 27 inches around the arm, 68 about the chest and 78 about the waist."
1898-11-06T00:00:00Z,""" A Colonial Girl,"" at the Lyceum, the one new play of last week excepting the burlesque of ""Cyrano,"" certainly represents an earnest attempt of Mrs. Richardson and Miss Furniss to put some of the romance, some of the quaintness, some of the humor of New York town when the red-coats were masters of it and George Washington was concentrating his forces up in Westchester, on the dramatic stage."
1898-11-06T00:00:00Z,"MILWAUKEE, Wis., Nov. 5. -- It would take a wise man to tell with any degree of accuracy how the election is going to result in Wisconsin, so far as the Governor and State officers are concerned. Not so much doubt exists regarding the Congressmen and the Legislature."
1898-11-06T00:00:00Z,"The inefficiency and waste of bad system are plainly exhibited in the unhappy experience of the War Department. The two services present a striking contrast, although the officers of both have been educated at Government schools. The army, unfortunately, is not looked upon as a profession, and any one who has sufficient political influence is regarded as competent for a commission."
1898-11-06T00:00:00Z,The contention of the Spanish Peace Commissioners in reply to our declared purpose to take the whole of the Philippines is not convincing because it is not honest. Even in diplomacy a proposition that is too baldly disingenuous has small chance.
1898-11-06T00:00:00Z,"COLUMBIA University's new gymnasium, now in running order, has been both a surprise and a revelation to the students and to the people of New York generally. There is no finer gymnasium in the country, and many people say there is nothing to excel it in the world."
1898-11-06T00:00:00Z,"British warships are scattered all over the world, and the Admiralty Department has announced that the navy is prepared for war. In view of the strained relations between Great Britain and France it is interesting to note where the British warships are and the strength of the different squadrons."
1898-11-06T00:00:00Z,"It seems to me that a collateral issue is developing in the present campaign which unfortunately has not been accentuated by either press or speakers. I refer to the shadow of militarism and its concomitant dictatorship. Our sister republic is to-day on the brink of a social upheaval through the menacing tyrrany, venality, and corruption of the military branch of the Government."
1898-11-06T00:00:00Z,"There is a story told of a traveler in the tropical forest who, thinking to drink water from some tree or vine, tapped instead, unwittingly, a rubber bearing plant.

1898-11-06T00:00:00Z,"CHICAGO, Nov. 5. -- It is generally conceded that the Republicans will elect their State ticket. The State Treasurer heads it and the interest in that part of the election is far from what it usually is."

1898-11-06T00:00:00Z,"Wall Street has had during the past week many temptations toward weakness, but net results at the end show encouraging advances. Developments in many quarters and of many kinds came along day by day calculated -- as in former days might ordinarily have counted -- to depress quotations, making holders of securities nervous and apprehensive."
1898-11-06T00:00:00Z,"TROY, N.Y., Nov. 5. -- Trojans gave Augustus Van Wyck, the Democratic candidate for Governor, a rousing reception at the mass meeting held in Bolton Hall to-night."
1898-11-06T00:00:00Z,"LONDON, Nov. 5. -- I have never known public opinion to be so perplexed as it has been during the past week. Everybody has been completely in the dark. Not a single newspaper has received official inspiration. Even Lord Rosebery, who broke a two years' political silence to support Salisbury, has been vouchsafed no information whatever, though it is his policy upon which the country is now united."
1898-11-06T00:00:00Z,"BERLIN, Nov. 5. -- The news that the United States now demands the whole of the Philippine Islands has created much interest here. The German newspapers comment unfavorably upon it."
1898-11-06T00:00:00Z,It seems that the question of Fashoda has definitely disappeared from international politics. The announcement of Lord SALISBURY on Friday was in fact the announcement of a foregone conclusion. But it is none the less comfortable and reassuring to have the announcement made.
1898-11-06T00:00:00Z,"Who Col. Woodruff -- ""A.C.G.S."" -- who writes a letter in your issue of the 4th inst., is, I don't know, but I do know it is a very remarkable statement, in view of the statements previously made by the soldiers to the contrary, unless this ""Colonel and A.C.G.S."" is merely stating what was charged to that voyage on the books for that purpose."
1898-11-06T00:00:00Z,"BUFFALO, Nov. 5. -- The Democratic campaign in Erie County was brought to a close to-night with three large meetings, at which ex-Senator David B. Hill was the chief speaker. Mr. Hill first addressed a meeting in the Polish section of East Buffalo, and then a gathering of German citizens. His principal speech of the evening was delivered at the Lyceum Theatre."
1898-11-06T00:00:00Z,"Not only are the traditions and customs of Catalonia (and what Is true of one provInce is true of the others) different from those of Castile, but the economic interests of each of these units which compose the Spanish State are occasionally oppcsed to each other. It is a mistake, therefore, to suppose that the abrogation of our special laws is a sentimental grievance."
1898-11-06T00:00:00Z,"WILKESBARRE, Penn., Nov. 5. -- Seven men were killed and three fatally injured at the Exeter Colliery of the Lehigh Valley Coal Company, at West Pittston, near here, this morning.

1898-11-06T00:00:00Z,"The grosbeak is a pugnacious fellow with birds of his own size, but he never troubles the smaller ones. A good many birds found the nest from time to time, and, bird-like, stopped to gratify their curiosity concerning it. A little song sparrow, who had lost his tailfeathers, and who led a sort of bachelor existence in the greasewood all the Springtime, used to sit and sing close beside the nest."
1898-11-06T00:00:00Z,"BERLIN, Nov. 5. -- The Frankfort Zeitung says it learns from a well-informed source that Emperor William's visit to Turkey led to an agreement by which Germany undertakes to support the integrity of the Sultan's Asiatic possessions, for which Germany will receive commercial and industrial privileges."
1898-11-06T00:00:00Z,"There is a fair prospect now that, after all the disappointments which the lovers of light-harness racing have met with in their endeavor to find a suitable track where the trotting and pacing races could be held, a track will soon be built. The Executive Committee of the Driving Club has had before it all sorts of plans and numerous sites were looked over, but the efforts of the committee came to naught."
1898-11-06T00:00:00Z,"SANTIAGO, Nov. 5. -- Capt. Chester of the United States cruiser Cincinnati and a board of officers yesterday visited the wreck of the Spanish cruiser Cristobal Colon, spending several hours at the scene, and finally decided that work on the sunken warship should be abandoned, as, in their opinion, there is no possible chance of raising her."
1898-11-06T00:00:00Z,"The Burmese pharmacopoeia as a whole is a subject for laughter and tears; but there is no gainsaying the fact that it includes a few medicines for such diseases as jungle fever and dysentery which, if used by the light of common sense, and not by that of astrological calculation, are productive, of excellent results."
1898-11-06T00:00:00Z,"When we shall come to build monuments to those who have been instrumental in preserving the game resources in this country, let us not forget the moonshiner of the West Virginia mountains and contiguous regions roundabout, who because of a well-known proclivity to bush unsuspecting invaders of his wilderness realm, has exerted a decidedly deterrent influence on hunting excursions."
1898-11-06T00:00:00Z,"As the campaign draws to its close it becomes more evident what the Republican candidate's efforts to be ""regular"" are likely to cost him. It is quite true that the Republicans were upon their defense in State issues. If Col. ROOSEVELT had simply allowed himself to be imposed upon the party, that would not have put him on his defense."
1898-11-06T00:00:00Z,"The demands of our five Commissioners in Paris seem to have rigidly followed the path prescribed in the Senate, and finally by Congress last April. The President had refused to recognize in Cuba a state belligerent or a state independent. Spain had refused to yield to his proposition to mediate between Cuban rebels and the Cuban Governor General."
1898-11-06T00:00:00Z,"Your journal is not much read by advocates of the Raines law, therefore it is of little use for me to reply even in few words to Willoughby, who makes a most pertinent inquiry concerning the Society for the Promotion of Social Purity. The society has been as persistent in its efforts since the Raines Liquor bill became the law of the State as before."
1898-11-06T00:00:00Z,"OMAHA, Neb., Nov. 5. -- To-day the Trans-Mississippi and International Exposition Association began paying back 75 cents on every dollar of stock that was subscribed for its construction.

1898-11-06T00:00:00Z,"LONDON, Nov. 5. -- The famous Langworthy case, which caused a sensation in England in 1887, has been revived by the death of Mrs. Langworthy and the suicide of her husband in the Grand Hotel, in Paris."
1898-11-06T00:00:00Z,"WASHINGTON, Nov. 5. -- Expansion promises to be a theme in both houses of Congress during the approaching short session, and there may be a temptation to devote so much time to discussion of it as to leave little time for anything else, including the very important questions of an increased army and navy, growing out of expansion."
