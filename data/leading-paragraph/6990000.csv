2007-10-14T00:00:00Z,"New York Senate Republicans have been busily fanning the last embers of the ''Troopergate'' investigation. Their hearings on this matter are designed to reflect poorly on their most aggressive Democratic opponent, Gov. Eliot Spitzer. But a recent story in the Albany Times Union raised an interesting question: why are the politicians aiming their peashooters only at Mr. Spitzer? It also raised the distinct possibility that Troopergate is designed mainly to distract the public from the seedy behavior of other politicians in Albany. Since early summer, the headline issue has been whether Mr. Spitzer's team forced state troopers to somehow manufacture or ''create'' documents for the media. Those documents, from 2007, involved the lavish use for political purposes of state helicopters and state drivers by Senate Leader Joseph Bruno, New York's top elected Republican."

This is truly over the top. When their children leave for college, will these parents be just an e-mail message away, planning their schedules and scanning their papers? And when they graduate, will they be there to help with the job applications, interviews and salary negotiations? Parents are supposed to be protectors, not promoters. Home should be a refuge, not a boot camp for college admissions."

2007-10-14T00:00:00Z,"Brennan Stays in the Race Hawaii's 42-35 overtime victory at San Jose State on Friday night has ramifications for both the Heisman Trophy and the Bowl Championship Series. It will be fascinating to see if the Warriors' comeback from a 14-point deficit in the final four minutes helps or hurts the Heisman chances of Hawaii quarterback Colt Brennan. He might have played his worst game of the season, but the conditions on the sloppy, wet field were not exactly ideal. Brennan completed 44 of 75 passes for 4 touchdowns and 545 yards, along with 4 interceptions. He also ran for a touchdown at the end of regulation to force overtime."

If true, this is certainly cause for concern. But Teach for America members are deeply committed to public education. Witness the recent appointment of an alumna, Michelle Rhee, as chancellor of the Washington, D.C., public schools. She has made no secret of her intent to remain in the city for years to come.

Olin College of Engineering that when I reached the last two paragraphs, I was dismayed. The concerns of Richard K. Miller, the school's president, about the employability of his students and about their prospects of clicking with the corporate culture of large firms resonated with me. The solution is for Olin to become not just a college but also a semi-independent engineering firm. Graduates could be guaranteed a two- or three-year position at the Olin firm, where they would execute real engineering work for paying clients in an environment that would serve as a bridge between college and their eventual independent careers. When they were ready to strike out on their own, graduates wouldn't be looking for entry-level positions; they'd be established professional engineers with completed commercial projects on their résumés."

It was warm out, and throngs filled the streets and the Tuileries Gardens, which were illuminated by thousands of fires in flowerpots. A huge candlelit chandelier hung at the Concorde gate, above. The museums were open and free; actors performed plays from the balcony of the Comédie-Française, bottom, second from far right. Outdoor restaurants, open until dawn, were packed. The festivities coincided with the annual invasion of fashion luminaries in the favorite color of Paris, black. Even Anna Piaggi of Italian Vogue (in the Nike T-shirt at far right), known for her audacious hues, wore it -- with a green fox scarf. Carine Roitfeld, the editor of French Vogue, top left, in front of the tricolor, was among the women in square shoulder pads.

In Denver, we took two classes a day, focusing on one concept per class, like the embrace or how to walk. Afterward, we went to two milongas, formal dances. So I'd just been dancing nonstop. My feet hurt so much. But it was a beautiful setting and I was really excited to apply everything I'd learned. As a compromise, we kicked off our shoes and danced in the pool. Without music, you focus more on the sound of your feet, you just engage more of your senses. The splashing of the water kept a certain rhythm that was easy to keep up with.'' As told to Seth Kugel"

I've learned that a new mixing valve, installed inside the wall, can take care of the problem. The building's managers first told me that since the apartment has its original plumbing, the co-op would be responsible. Then they came back and said it was my responsibility. Who should pay for this? A While most proprietary leases provide that the co-op corporation is responsible for plumbing within the walls of the apartment -- unless the plumbing was installed or modified by the tenant-shareholder -- some make the shareholder responsible for the shower assembly, including the mixing valve, said Alexander Suslensky, a Manhattan lawyer. So, he said, whether the co-op is responsible for installing a new mixing valve will depend on the specific terms of the proprietary lease."

Somehow I managed to make it through college and into late middle age without having read ""War and Peace."" Though Tolstoy wrote one of my favorite pieces of fiction (""Anna Karenina"") and one of my least favorite (that misogynous chastity pamphlet, ""The Kreutzer Sonata""), W&P was always too intimidating in scale, and too show-offy to bring to the beach. The Russian language I studied to work in Moscow was more functional than literary, and while my tutors dosed me with just enough Pushkin to nod appreciatively when Evgeny Onegin came up in conversation  more often than you'd think  the master of Yasnaya Polyana was scarcely mentioned. (Although I was duly warned that Tolstoy, pronounced as we pronounce him in the West, means ""thick"" or ""fat,"" and could be appropriately used to describe ""War and Peace,"" but in Russian the writer's name is pronounced with the emphasis at the back.) While I'm owning up to my lack of qualifications, I should add that I have not written a literature term paper in 40 years, and that I have never participated in a book club. So I came to this assignment with a mixture of guilt, dread and ignorance."

I wrote, ""Which literary characters do you most identify with, or which remind you most of certain Friends? For example, one of you strongly reminds me of Prince Andrei, from 'War and Peace,' can you guess who?""

It didn't occur to me until they responded how charged that comparison had been, and what a nuanced impression of Andrei any reader retained. I quickly deleted the mischievous question."

But still, you might wonder how Tolstoy knows exactly how a beautiful young woman feels when she is asked to dance at a formal ball. Or how she responds when she believes that her life is being squandered in waiting for her fiancé to reappear, and a handsome man - Tolstoy so obviously enjoys writing about cads, it makes you wonder! - begins to pursue her with his seductive, unrelenting attentions."

Until recently, the companies shipped most of their tuna to Spain for fancy canned tuna, or to Japan's sushi bars. Now, some of the catch is being canned for the American market. The tuna, sold under the name American Tuna, has been approved by the Marine Stewardship Council, an international nonprofit organization, for its fishing methods, and as a testament to its flavor, is used for sandwiches at 'wichcraft, above, Bouchon Bakery and the cafe at Blue Hill at Stone Barns."

So my thoughts on Sam's question - How does Tolstoy do it? - are at this point derived from the first volume: a mere 295 pages. But it strikes me that one way Tolstoy humanizes and universalizes his characters is by refusing to treat them with reverence. He allows his major figures to speak and act foolishly, to be caught in moments of pettiness, cowardice, naïveté, humiliation. Examples abound, but one of my favorites in the first volume is the way Tolstoy treats Nikolai Rostov's puppy-love adoration of the tsar. Tolstoy himself was not immune to emperor-rapture, and it may well have been true, as he writes, that ""nine tenths of the men in the Russian army were then in love"" with their tsar. But Count Nikolai's devotion is portrayed as a paralyzing schoolboy crush - his bashful ecstasy before the beautiful visage of the young emperor, his detailed daydreams of dying in the ruler's presence, and ultimately his juvenile terror and abject flight when the opportunity arises to approach his beloved. Tolstoy has made Rostov real by subjecting him to ridicule. I expect that in the pages to come Tolstoy, having whittled Rostov down to size in this way, will let him grow."

Known for her high style and indomitable will, Ms. Dandois, above, persuaded the auction house to hire Juan Pablo Molyneux, the New York decorator, to transform its 10th-floor exhibition galleries into a series of grand salons to display her wares. In one 18-foot-tall room, left, enlarged Piranesi drawings provide a backdrop to pieces that include a 19th-century Empire mahogany secretaire with matching chiffonier ($250,000 to $350,000); a Russian neoclassical table with gilt-winged legs ($20,000 to $30,000); and a pair of circa 1770 Italian gilt wood chairs ($70,000 to $10,000). Dramatic images of St. Petersburg palace interiors adorn the walls of a nearby salon, above. ''Juan Pablo Photo-shopped the grand staircase of the Hermitage,'' said Ms. Dandois's daughter, Ondine, who helped organize the auction. The room contains a Spanish neoclassical ormolu-mounted mahogany desk, above, that also functions as a dressing table ($200,000 to $300,000). The pre-auction exhibition is open to the public from Oct. 20 to 24 at Sotheby's, 1334 York Avenue (72nd Street). Information: (212) 606-7000 or www.sothebys.com.CHRISTOPHER MASON"

2007-10-19T00:00:00Z,"A long-running argument about which painting offers a true likeness of Shakespeare has taken a new turn. Experts have found that ink on a label identifying a portrait said to be of Shakespeare dates back to his time, The Globe and Mail of Toronto reported. The painting, right, was made by John Sanders, a Shakespearean-era actor born in 1576, and has been in the possession of Lloyd Sullivan, a retired Ottawa engineer, since his mother gave it to him in 1972. He has spent 15 years and an estimated $750,000 on tests to buttress his belief that the painting is the only true portrait of Shakespeare. On Wednesday Joseph Barabe, a forensic analyst for McCrone Associates of Chicago, said that “the formula of the ink” on a small handwritten label on the back of the Sanders painting “certainly fits” with manufacturing methods and materials from the first 50 or so years of 17th-century England. He said, “I see all of the evidence kind of falling in the realm of authenticity — and I don’t see any evidence coming forth that brings it into question.” When the painting, dated 1603, was shown last year with five other “Shakespeares” in London, it was said that the sitter appeared far younger than the 39-year-old Shakespeare would have been."

Stanley Hung, secretary general of the Motion Picture and Drama Association of Taiwan, has appealed the ruling on “Lust, Caution.” Mr. Lee won the Oscar for best director for “Brokeback Mountain.” ...

An engaging and enthusiastic speaker who provides his own piano accompaniment for his screenings, Mr. Bromberg comes up with unexpected marvels each time he visits Brooklyn, as he will again tonight. Though he keeps his selections secret until show time, there are always a few astonishments for the cognoscenti, as well as copious pleasures for newcomers. Mr. Bromberg is one of the stalwarts of the Pordenone Film Festival, a showcase for rediscovered and restored silent films held in a small town near Venice. The weekend tribute in Brooklyn continues through Sunday evening with several films recently restored by the Danish Film Institute that were originally presented in the 2006 Pordenone festival. The programs include a focus on the work of August Blom, who was making lengthy, psychologically complex features like the 1913 film ''Atlantis'' (tomorrow) at a time when American movies were struggling to escape the one-reel format, and a screening of Holger-Madsen's remarkable ''Sky Ship'' (Sunday), above, a 1918 science-fiction film about an expedition to Mars that anticipates many conventions of ''Star Trek.''"

The human version of the gene differs at two critical points from the chimpanzee version, suggesting that these two changes have something to do with the fact that people can speak and chimps cannot."

2007-10-19T00:00:00Z,"BENNY CARTER CENTENNIAL Benny Carter -- the alto saxophonist, trumpeter, clarinetist, composer, arranger and bandleader often hailed in jazz circles as the King -- died in 2003, a much beloved and amply decorated hero of American music. This year marks the centennial of his birth, and the occasion has been duly noted: Today is Benny Carter Day by proclamation of the City of New York, and tonight and tomorrow Jazz at Lincoln Center will kick off its 2007-8 season with Benny Carter-themed concerts. (Carter, above, has also just joined the ranks of the organization's Nesuhi Ertegun Jazz Hall of Fame.) The concerts should be a natural fit for the Jazz at Lincoln Center Orchestra and its artistic director, Wynton Marsalis, and not just for the usual reasons. As a repertory subject, Carter offers rich terrain: He had an unmistakable and hugely influential sound on alto; an innovative style as an arranger, both for bandstand purposes and behind the scenes in Hollywood, which he helped integrate; and a career that actively spanned almost every era of jazz. He was also a sophisticated artist with a cool but firm determination, precisely the sort of figure Mr. Marsalis is happiest to venerate."

2007-10-19T00:00:00Z,"'DISGUISED AS CLARK KENT: JEWS, COMICS AND THE CREATION OF THE SUPERHERO' Look! Up in the sky! It's a bird! It's a plane! Oy, it's Superman? In the seminar ''Disguised as Clark Kent'' on Sunday, the author Danny Fingeroth will examine the origins of the creators behind some of the most famous and enduring comic-book characters. Mr. Fingeroth, who has written a book of the same title and was an editor at Marvel for nearly 20 years, will discuss how the work of Jerry Siegel and Joe Shuster (the team behind Superman), Will Eisner (the Spirit) and Stan Lee and Jack Kirby (the Fantastic Four and the X-Men) and others were influenced by their Jewish heritage. ''I go through specific story lines, especially through the '50s and '60s that had Jewish content seeping through,'' Mr. Fingeroth said. Those themes include attempts by Superman to go back in time to save Krypton from exploding. He said, ''He had survivor's guilt, as did Captain America, who was frozen in that iceberg for all those years and survived his partner, Bucky.'' In another example Thor, a Marvel hero, was once forbidden by his father, the Norse god Odin, to marry a mortal woman. ''This clearly picks up the immigrant and specifically the Jewish concern of intermarriage,'' he said."

Given the attention this casting merry-go-round has won the Met, it's not surprising that now everyone's doing it. The Borodin String Quartet was to have performed on the Chamber Music Society of Lincoln Center's string quartet series, but that venerable ensemble, reportedly in the midst of a personnel change, canceled its American tour."

2007-10-19T00:00:00Z,"SAM KIM In describing her new work, ''dumb dumb bunny,'' now running at the Kitchen, the choreographer Sam Kim brought up the notion of agency and how people cope with obstacles. The piece, she said, is about the people ''negotiating, and finding their way in a particular environment, with their particular problems.'' The title, she added, conjures an image of a creature ''that is pretty soft and mute and pretty helpless'' -- a far cry from the wonderfully resourceful independent choreographers who routinely transform the Kitchen with their outlandishly fertile imaginations. Ms. Kim, for instance, has a 22-foot-high section of scaffolding as her major set piece, which she and the other performers will scale during the dance. She and her set designer, Mimi Lien, are also ''blinging out'' the walls, mounting strips of bare bulbs that she described as ''very functional but really flashy,'' while the choreography itself offers another contrast: formal components set next to jittery, sloppy movements."

2007-10-19T00:00:00Z,"WARHOL'S WORLD In 1963 Andy Warhol bought his first movie camera, a silent 16-millimeter Bolex, and became what he called ''a do-it-yourself-filmmaker.'' Over the next breathtakingly productive five years, with the help of assorted performers, assistants and beautiful and funky freaks (and a new camera), he did it himself brilliantly, shooting hundreds of silent and sound, color and black-and-white films. Among the titles are 472 portraits of about three minutes (Marcel Duchamp, Edie Sedgwick, Allen Ginsberg, Dennis Hopper, Andrew Sarris) that he called ''Screen Tests'' and that had been inspired by New York City Police Department mug shots, and about 160 additional films of variable running times and formalist concerns, including the eight-hour minimalist epic ''Empire'' (1964). Many of these were never released, but others were projected at Warhol's Factory, in movie theaters and even in a discothèque, as part of a multimedia blowout featuring the Velvet Underground. These films were not cult secrets of the avant-garde; they were a cultural phenomenon. Around 1970, two years after almost dying from gunshot wounds from a would-be assassin, however, Warhol withdrew his 1960s films from circulation, having turned his attention elsewhere."

That's one of the themes of ''Boo at the Zoo,'' tomorrow and Sunday at the Bronx Zoo and on Oct. 27 and 28 at the Central Park, Queens and Prospect Park Zoos, as well as again in the Bronx. The annual festivities include demonstrations with zookeepers, who usually bust a few myths about their charges, like bats.

So, if a bat is worth $500, can one swing ever be worth $14 million? Maybe. J.D.

The Red Sox must beat the Indians in Game 6 of the A.L.C.S. to stay alive and play a Game 7 on Sunday night. Because of Drew, the Red Sox are feeling good about being busy in 24 hours from now. If the Red Sox win on Saturday and Sunday and make it to the World Series, Drew's swing will be memorable, even priceless."

It is with unspeakable sorrow that we have lost our darling ''Jackie''. She exemplified the saying that ''You must live for others, if you want to live for yourself''. Her initial interest in public housing was broadened to many other fields, too numerous to state. They included her active participation in musical education for the under-priviledged, concerns of Barnard and Columbia students, the deanship of the Columbia School of Law and of Columbia College, rehabilitation medicine at Mount Sinai Hospital and neurology at Columbia Presbyterian Hospital, and the National Council of Jewish Women.

The Board of Directors of Henry and Lucy Moses Fund, Inc. mourn the loss of their dear colleague. Jackie Schneider had two great passions in her life. First was her family: her beloved deceased husband Henry Schneider, her son Michael and daughter-in-law Jean, her deceased daughter Barbara, her four grandchildren and the extended Barasch family. Following close behind were the New York City organizations which provided services to the needy and disadvantaged and to which she in turn made enormous contributions with her intelligence, her unfailing judgment and her inexhaustible good humor. Jackie's charitable interests were as broad and diverse as the City itself. Raised in Brooklyn across the street from Prospect Park, Jackie was a fervent supporter of the city's parks, especially Prospect Park and Central Park. She was active with the Citizens Advice Bureau, the largest settlement house in the Bronx; the National Council of Jewish Women, where she nurtured her HIPPY program; the Stanley Isaacs Neighborhood Center, where most recently she was instrumental in creating a program that helps prepare young people for college admission; the Elaine Kaufman Cultural Center, whose formation and development had been guided by Henry Schneider; the Kraft Jewish Center at Columbia University, and too many others to list. New York City and many of the organizations that attempt to make a difference in the lives of its citizens have suffered a grievous loss in the passing of Jackie Schneider.

Packed with fruit enzymes, beta carotene, antioxidants and minerals, it’s the kinder, gentler alternative to glycolic acid. The fruit sloughs off dead skin cells while treating the baby-fresh skin underneath to help prolong the glow. For a homemade treatment, Ciminelli suggests steaming the pumpkin, then peeling it and pulsing in a food processor. (Add yogurt and steamed prunes into the mix for a deeper exfoliation.)

2007-10-21T00:00:00Z,"I was born with poor judgement, the way others are born color-blind or without a sense of rhythm. I once fell in love with a man because he had no ambition, which I found refreshing. I am no better with things than with people. I’ve purchased worthless exercise equipment advertised on late-night infomercials that take up more closet space than my clothes. I once bought a pair of silver sneakers that would look good only in space. I purchased a Marc Jacobs shirt with no buttons just because I got it for a really good price. I have yet to replace the buttons. I own a pair of Kelly-green corduroys. Need I say more? Although I am aware of my disability, I can’t help but gravitate toward these Christian Dior shoes (above). They call to the Carmen Miranda in me. They are candy-apple red. They match nothing in my wardrobe. With that precarious heel, a tumble in these spine wranglers could lead to a life confined to a wheelchair. And what of the damage they can do to others? I will probably fall while walking down Fifth Avenue and, feet in the air, manage to gouge out the eye of a small child with the knifelike stiletto heel. It is one of Madonna’s kids. Great. Now we will never be best friends."
2007-10-21T00:00:00Z,"Not every Ph.D. student blows her fellowship money at Barneys New York. But for the urban planner Elizabeth Currid, her passion for style led to some interesting statistics, which she examines in “The Warhol Economy: How Fashion, Art & Music Drive New York City” (Princeton University Press). “The people who create the music you love, the art you like to look at, the fashion you wear — they aren’t just cool and sexy but innovative and important,” Currid says. The city’s real competitive edge lies not in the tech or finance sectors but in the frothier fields like fashion, design and night life: a drink at Bungalow 8 could be more influential than a Four Seasons power lunch. Testimony from the likes of Ryan McGinness and Clap Your Hands Say Yeah explains how art stars, indie bands and groovy young things keep this town fashionable and flush."

This season, the ubiquitous French manicure gets the bold treatment: on the runway, the designer Tracy Reese showed black on ivory to match her spectator pumps; the nails at Paul Smith were decorated with dark red-and-beige stripes; and the maroon at Dior (above) matched the shoes and bags. To create your own double-dip look, apply a white or ivory base color to tapered almond-shaped nails, then paint a vibrant-colored half-moon starting at the middle of the nail plate. Do not, however, expect longevity. As Ji Baek, the owner of Rescue Beauty Lounge, warns, “In the era of the BlackBerry and iPhone, this might not be easy to maintain.”."

2007-10-21T00:00:00Z,"Alber Elbaz once thought about becoming a doctor, and his approach to design is a combination of the analytical and the beautiful. He is fascinated by women -- by their desires, their responsibilities, their various guises -- and in each collection for Lanvin, he has sought to find a way to decode that tangle of moods. Like a physician, Elbaz looks for remedies, a solution to any dressing dilemma. ''In the end,'' he explained recently, as he was designing his spring collection, ''you don't need that much. When I left New York for France, I took only two suitcases. I always construct my collections with that thought in mind.'' When it came to envisioning a wardrobe for Jennifer Jason Leigh, who stars in ''Margot at the Wedding,'' which is to be released on Nov. 16, Elbaz saw infinite possibilities: ''She is so complex, like the women who buy my clothes. When I design, I don't think about a particular body part -- I think about what women want and what they dream.'' With that in mind, Elbaz offered some tenets of his fashion philosophy."

2007-10-21T00:00:00Z,"DOUBLE DUTY The ultimate goal for any designer who is committed to sustainability is not just to use less energy, less material and less packaging but also to do away with as many objects as possible. At least that's what Naoto Fukasawa is after. He is hardly a household name in the United States, but Fukasawa is the leading industrial designer in Japan, where his cellphones are coveted. Fukasawa's less-is-more approach involves combining different functions into single products. His Tile Light, for example, is both bathroom tile and light fixture. He is now conducting a research project with the Japanese industrial group Matsushita to develop ''intelligent walls'' -- modular panels, each with a functional purpose of providing, say, lighting, heating or sound. ''It's already happening,'' he says. ''I'm just creating the inevitable.'' BRIGHT IDEA They'll soon be illegal in Australia, and they may be banned in parts of Europe and possibly the United States too. The environmental argument to abolish something as wasteful as the old-fashioned incandescent light bulb is fairly incontestable. But perhaps the only thing keeping consumers from switching on their own accord is the fact that energyefficient bulbs are just not that great-looking. ''The light quality isn't that delicious; it's too cold,'' says the British designer Tom Dixon. ''But the energy savings from using, say, a compact fluorescent bulb is phenomenal. We decided to create a shade to house one in the shape of an enlarged bulb, which allows the cold light to warm up a bit.'' Dixon unveiled the Blow Light in a giant outdoor installation in Trafalgar Square during last month's London Design Festival, culminating in the Great Give Away, when more than 1,500 Londoners packed into the square, hoping to leave with one of the 1,000 free Blow Lights."

First was her family: her beloved deceased husband Henry Schneider, her son Michael and daughter-in-law Jean, her deceased daughter Barbara, her four grandchildren and the extended Barasch family. Following close behind were the New York City organizations which provided services to the needy and disadvantaged and to which she in turn made enormous contributions with her intelligence, her unfailing judgment and her inexhaustible good humor. Jackie's charitable interests were as broad and diverse as the City itself. Raised in Brooklyn across the street from Prospect Park, Jackie was a fervent supporter of the city's parks, especially Prospect Park and Central Park. She was active with the Citizens Advice Bureau, the largest settlement house in the Bronx; the National Council of Jewish Women, where she nurtured her HIPPY program; the Stanley Isaacs Neighborhood Center, where most recently she was instrumental in creating a program that helps prepare young people for college admission; the Elaine Kaufman Cultural Center, whose formation and development had been guided by Henry Schneider; the Kraft Jewish Center at Columbia University, and too many others to list. New York City and many of the organizations that attempt to make a difference in the lives of its citizens have suffered a grievous loss in the passing of Jackie Schneider. SCHNEIDER--Jacqueline Barasch, 89, died October 17th surrounded by her loved ones. Loving wife of the late Henry Schneider. Devoted mother to Michael Schneider and Jean Kelley and the late Barbara Schneider Bruckner. Beloved and cherished grandmother to Robert and Jamie Bruckner, and Max and Ethan Schneider. Adored aunt of Nancy and Murphy, Liz and Kirk, Lionel and Lili, Jonathan and Lisa, John and Laurie, Bob and Michael, Madeleine and Gil. Dearly loved great-aunt to her grandnieces and grandnephews. Loving sister to Clarence Barasch and the late Thelma Rudey and Gladys Blum. A magnificent woman with a big heart and a zest for life who touched all who knew her. She will be deeply missed. Funeral services 10:30am, Sunday, October 21, Park Avenue Synagogue, 87th Street and Madison Avenue. SCHNEIDER--Jacqueline. The Board and staff of the Stanley M. Isaacs Neighborhood Center extend our deepest sympathy to the family of Jacqueline Schneider. Her deep commitment and thoughtful leadership enriched us all. Stanley M. Issacs Neighborhood Center Doris C. Halaby, Chairman Lee Wareham, President Wanda Wooten, Exec. Dir. SCHNEIDER--Jacqueline I. (nee Barasch). It is with unspeakable sorrow that we have lost our darling ''Jackie''. She exemplified the saying that ''You must live for others, if you want to live for yourself''. Her initial interest in public housing was broadened to many other fields, too numerous to state. They included her active participation in musical education for the under-priviledged, concerns of Barnard and Columbia students, the deanship of the Columbia School of Law and of Columbia College, rehabilitation medicine at Mount Sinai Hospital and neurology at Columbia Presbyterian Hospital, and the National Council of Jewish Women. She was much beloved by her son, Michael, and daughter-in-law, Jean, and by her husband and daughter, both of whom predeceased her, and by her grandsons, by her brother and by his extended family. We feel so alone without her. May the earth lie light upon her. Clarence and Mimi Barasch Lionel and Lili Barasch Jonathan and Lisa Barasch SCHNEIDER--Jacqueline. We mourn the passing of our beloved Trustee, a woman of valor who shared with us her wisdom, energy, humor, love and amazing zest for life. May her memory be a blessing, a long with that of her late husband and daughter, Henry Schneider and Barbara Schneider Bruckner. Our hearts go out to her son Michael and the rest of her loving family at this sad time. Kaufman Center Phyllis Feder, Chairman Bethany Millard, President Lydia Kontos, Exec. Dir."

During the 1730s and '40s -- the so-called golden age of the Chesapeake gentry -- planters in Virginia and Maryland took to fox hunting. Hardly had the first huntsman's horn sounded, however, when they discovered a serious obstacle to this amusement. The gray fox, native to America, reclusive and skittish, refused to play along. The gentry, who already imported their hounds, thoroughbreds and riding clothes from England, added the red fox to the list. Clever and wildly audacious, it was the behavioral opposite of the dull and disinterested gray fox. But the same characteristics that made the red fox more sporting have made it a more effective competitor for habitat and resources in America. The red fox in America, like the gray squirrel in Britain, has gradually crowded out its trans-Atlantic cousin from its own territory."

He helped found Weill Cornell's William Randolph Hearst Burn Center, now one of largest centers of its kind in the world; his research into fluid management for trauma patients changed clinical practice; he played a key role in organizing Emergency Medical Services (EMS) in New York City and launching the state's first helicopter ambulance service; and he led influential professional organizations, including the International Surgical Society, American Board of Surgery, American College of Surgeons and the American Surgical Association. In 1963, he became a part of history, performing successful emergency surgery on Governor John Connally following the assassination of President John F. Kennedy.

Mr. Helfat was also a past President of the Bayside Democratic Club and ran for Congress on the Democratic and Liberal party lines in 1960.

2007-10-23T12:03:04Z,"Well, it's precisely that combination - the familiarity and the exoticism, the immersion in a particular historical period and the almost eerie ""modernity"" - that makes the novel so extraordinary and so engrossing. So many events and characters have contemporary, or near contemporary, counterparts. Pierre's attraction to Masonry evokes, for me, all the longing and discontent that drove so many people in the 1960s and 70s to follow some goofy guru or other; every era (including ours) has its spiritual charlatans. Tolstoy's characterization of Napoleon - the pettiness of his vanity, his shortsighted refusal to consider any views that don't mirror his own - is distressingly reminiscent of the absolute worst, and most dangerous, qualities of today's world leaders. The beautiful scene in which Andrei's interest in the war and (by extension) his career is dwarfed by the pressures and terrors of caring for a sick child - variant versions of that are playing themselves out, at this moment, in homes and families everywhere. And yet, as we read the novel, we are constantly being reminded of how much has changed: everyday manners and mores, notions of female virtue and dishonor, the givens of class, status, family obligation. The duel has been replaced by the drive-by, and happily, it's no longer taken for granted that sensible parents can, and actually should, auction off their marriageable daughter (or son, for that matter) to the wealthiest bidder."

""My life is not only for myself,"" he realizes. ""It is reflected in everyone, and they all live together with me!"""

2007-10-23T00:00:00Z,"LOMBARD--Richard S. , former general counsel of Exxon Corporation from 1973 to 1993, died at his home in Tucson, Arizona, on October 18, at age 79. A leader of the New York and national bars, he helped to shape the practice of law in the United States and abroad. Born in 1928 in the Canal Zone, Panama, he attended public schools in the Canal Zone, graduated from Harvard College in 1949 after one year's service in the Army Air Corps, and graduated from the Harvard Law School in 1952. He was an associate with the New York firm of Haight, Gardner, Poor, and Havens, from 1952 to 1955. He began work as a lawyer for Exxon's predecessor, the Standard Oil Company of New Jersey, in 1955, spending ten years in the law department of its Venezuelan subsidiary, Creole Petroleum, and eight years in the law departments of Exxon divisions in New York and Texas before becoming Exxon's general counsel in 1973 (vice president from 1980 to 1993). His career with Exxon, in 1973 the largest oil company and largest publicly traded corporation in the world, spanned a period of expansion in worldwide demand for oil and a major restructuring of the oil business. During the seventies, he coordinated Exxon's legal response to the Middle East oil crisis, including the nationalizations of the Iraqi, Libyan, Saudi Arabian, and Venezuelan oil industries between 1972 and 1976, an oil embargo by Arab members of OPEC, and the oil crisis following the Iranian revolution in 1979. Exxon's and other companies' success in using arbitration and negotiation to win compensation for their nationalized assets helped popularize the use of private international arbitration, now the standard mechanism for private international dispute resolution. During the eighties, he coordinated Exxon's response to increased litigation by expanding the size of Exxon's law department and handling much of the company's legal business inhouse, a model later followed by corporate law departments nationwide. From 1989 until 1993, he coordinated Exxon's legal response to the Exxon Valdez oil spill in Alaska. After his retirement from Exxon in 1993, he was of counsel to the Dallas firm of Baker and Botts until 1996, and served as an arbitrator in domestic and international business disputes until 2002. He influenced the profession as a leader of various organizations, as a former chairman of the boards of trustees of the American Arbitration Association and the Parker School of International and Comparative Law at Columbia University, and as a cofounder in the eighties, along with Cyrus Vance and others, of Volunteers of Legal Services (VOLS), to coordinate the provision of volunteer legal work during a time of cutbacks in federal funding for legal services for the poor. He was a former trustee of the Southwestern Legal Foundation (now the Center for International and American Law) at Southern Methodist University, former member of the advisory board at the Columbia University Center for Law and Economic Studies, and former trustee of the Practicing Law Institute, among other groups. He is the author of one book, ''American Venezuelan Private International Law: A Bilateral Study'' (New York, 1965) He is survived by his beloved wife of 55 years, Arlene Olson Lombard of Tucson, Arizona, his son James, also of Tucson, his daughter Anne, of Aliso Viejo, California, four grandchildren, and his sister, Elaine Newland of Bluffton, South Carolina. A memorial service will be held October 26, 1pm, at St. Philip's in the Hills Episcopal Church in Tucson, Arizona Donations in lieu of flowers may be sent to the Primavera Foundation, 702 S. 6th Ave., Tucson, Arizona 85701."

2007-10-23T00:00:00Z,"HELFAT--Bernard A. , died peacefully on October 20, 2007 at his home in Douglaston, NY at the age of 90. He practiced law for over 60 years, first with his father, J. Nathan Helfat, and later as a sole practitioner. Mr. Helfat was well known in the textile industry for helping to bring to an end the long-standing practice of design piracy (knock offs). He represented the plaintiff in the landmark case of Peter Pan Fabrics vs. Martin Weiner, Inc. This decision had a great impact, not only on design protection in the textile industry, but for other fashion industries as well. Mr. Helfat grew up in Lawrence, Long Island and was Valedictorian of Lawrence High School, Class of 1933. He also graduated from Phillips Exeter Academy, Class of 1934; Harvard College 1938 and Harvard Law School 1941. During World War II, he served on the War Department General Staff in Washington D.C. and obtained the rank of Captain. He was recalled during the Korean War, serving in the National Security Agency, and was a recipient of the Bronze Star. After returning to civilian life, Mr. Helfat and his family settled in Douglaston, Queens where he became active in civic affairs and politics. He was a founding member and a past President of Temple Emanuel of Great Neck, past President of the Douglaston Civic Association, and past Chairman of the New York City School Board for North East Queens. Mr. Helfat was also a past President of the Bayside Democratic Club and ran for Congress on the Democratic and Liberal party lines in 1960. Sailing with his family on the Long Island Sound and tending to his rose garden were favorite past times. He is survived by Lucile, his beloved wife of 64 years; two sons, Jonathan and Mark; his two loving daughters-in-law, Robin and Mendy; as well as his two grandsons, Benjamin and Joshua; and Joshua's wife Abigail.

Diane Johnstone. RORABACK--Catherine. The American Civil Liberties Union and its Board of Directors mourn the passing of legendary civil rights attorney Catherine G. ''Katie'' Roraback. Roraback was a board member emeritus of the ACLU of Connecticut, and a longtime member of the ACLU's national board, and its National Advisory Council. She was 87 years old. Roraback is remembered by many as a wonderful mentor and inspiration to other lawyers, especially younger women. She made protecting the legal rights of ''dissenters and the dispossessed'' a part of her practice long before the advent of public interest law, defending Black Panthers in New Haven, civil rights workers in Mississippi, and citizens in the denaturalization proceedings during the McCarthy era. But Roraback truly made her mark in a 50year career by fighting for women's reproductive rights. She litigated landmark cases, including the case that established reproductive health rights for women, secured the right to birth control, and established a constitutional right to privacy, Griswold vs. Connecticut. The United States Supreme Court held in that case that the Constitution guarantees a ''right to privacy'' when individuals make decisions about intimate, personal matters such as childbearing. That right to privacy would then be the underpinning of the Court's Roe v. Wade 1973 landmark ruling. Roraback tried Women vs. Connecticut, the state's counterpart to Roe v. Wade, which struck down Connecticut's anti-abortion statutes. Catherine Roraback will be deeply missed by those who value freedom and equal rights for all people."

The son of Dr. and Mrs. Arthur Foeste, Bill was born in Billings, Montana September 6th, 1948. He graduated from the University of Wisconsin in 1970, and in 1974 received his medical degree from the University of Colorado. He completed his medical residency at Downstate/Kings County Hospital Centers. Dr. Bill, as many of his patients affectionately called him, spent most of his professional life serving the medically underserved in the emergency room and drug treatment center at Kings County Hospital. At a time when HMOs put many doctors and patients in adversarial relationships, Bill became even closer to his patients helping them negotiate the complexities of the health care system. Many of his patients had his home and cell phone numbers. In his personal life, he also helped those less fortunate. Without fanfare, he worked to make the world a better place by his commitment to children. All those that he helped attained heights they never could have without his support. An environmentalist before it became fashionable, his carbon footprint was small, his personal footprint was huge. Bill's love of travel, which took him to five continents, as well as his passion for reading benefitted not only himself, but all of his friends for Bill was a witty and brilliant conversationalist. Left to mourn his exemplary life are his beloved wife Joan Spence Foeste; his brother Arthur E. Foeste (Joan) of Madison, WI; sister Jane F. Wittenwyler (Ronald) of Des Moines, IA, and Kay F. Goepfert (Walter) of Madison, WI; God-daughter, Hershley Philogene of Brooklyn; stepchildren Paul and Suzanne Fairweather; nieces and nephews around the world, and a host of close friends.

But health officials say customers rarely see this information before deciding what to order."

He served 15 years in prison. Now Mr. Chambers, 41, is in serious legal trouble again, along with his girlfriend, Shawn Kovell, 39.

So let's leave Andrei and Pierre and Natasha and the rest for a moment, and time-machine forward to the 20th century. Berlin's clever template for the discussion of great thinkers was, as the hyperliterates who have been participating in this discussion know better than I, ""The Hedgehog and the Fox."" The hedgehog, in Berlin's formulation, views the world through one great defining idea, a ""single central vision, one system less or more coherent or articulate."" To this category Berlin assigns Dante, Plato, Hegel, Nietzsche, Dostoevsky, Proust and others. The more intellectually promiscuous fox, in contrast, pursues ""many ends, often unrelated and even contradictory, connected, if at all, only in some de facto way,"" not joined by an overarching moral or aesthetic principle. Aristotle, Goethe, Pushkin, Balzac, Joyce and, of course, Shakespeare, are foxes."

2007-10-24T00:00:00Z,"LOMBARD--Richard S . Former general counsel of Exxon Corporation from 1973 to 1993, died at his home in Tucson, Arizona, on October 18, at age 79. A leader of the New York and national bars, he helped to shape the practice of law in the United States and abroad. Born in 1928 in the Canal Zone, Panama, he attended public schools in the Canal Zone, graduated from Harvard College in 1949 after one year's service in the Army Air Corps, and graduated from the Harvard Law School in 1952. He was an associate with the New York firm of Haight, Gardner, Poor, and Havens, from 1952 to 1955. He began work as a lawyer for Exxon's predecessor, the Standard Oil Company of New Jersey, in 1955, spending ten years in the law department of its Venezuelan subsidiary, Creole Petroleum, and eight years in the law departments of Exxon divisions in New York and Texas before becoming Exxon's general counsel in 1973 (vice president from 1980 to 1993). His career with Exxon, in 1973 the largest oil company and largest publicly traded corporation in the world, spanned a period of expansion in worldwide demand for oil and a major restructuring of the oil business. During the seventies, he coordinated Exxon's legal response to the Middle East oil crisis, including the nationalizations of the Iraqi, Libyan, Saudi Arabian, and Venezuelan oil industries between 1972 and 1976, an oil embargo by Arab members of OPEC, and the oil crisis following the Iranian revolution in 1979. Exxon's and other companies' success in using arbitration and negotiation to win compensation for their nationalized assets helped popularize the use of private international arbitration, now the standard mechanism for private international dispute resolution. During the eighties, he coordinated Exxon's response to increased litigation by expanding the size of Exxon's law department and handling much of the company's legal business inhouse, a model later followed by corporate law departments nationwide. From 1989 until 1993, he coordinated Exxon's legal response to the Exxon Valdez oil spill in Alaska. After his retirement from Exxon in 1993, he was of counsel to the Dallas firm of Baker and Botts until 1996, and served as an arbitrator in domestic and international business disputes until 2002. He influenced the profession as a leader of various organizations, as a former chairman of the boards of trustees of the American Arbitration Association and the Parker School of International and Comparative Law at Columbia University, and as a cofounder in the eighties, along with Cyrus Vance and others, of Volunteers of Legal Services (VOLS), to coordinate the provision of volunteer legal work during a time of cutbacks in federal funding for legal services for the poor. He was a former trustee of the Southwestern Legal Foundation (now the Center for International and American Law) at Southern Methodist University, former member of the advisory board at the Columbia University Center for Law and Economic Studies, and former trustee of the Practicing Law Institute, among other groups. He is the author of one book, ''American Venezuelan Private International Law: A Bilateral Study'' (New York, 1965) He is survived by his beloved wife of 55 years, Arlene Olson Lombard of Tucson, Arizona, his son James, also of Tucson, his daughter Anne, of Aliso Viejo, California, four grandchildren, and his sister, Elaine Newland of Bluffton, South Carolina.

He loved his family most, but was a serious musician who composed and performed on classical and electric guitar, as well as many other instruments. He graduated from Bernards High, where he was a Madrigal, and often accompanied that group as well as others. He also sang with various other groups and bands, including his own group, Incaged.

At The College of New Jersey, where he was an honors student, he joined the Communications Depart ment and became involved with sports media and writing. He spent this fall and last summer working for the New York Yankees in their public relations and media group, where he was recognized as a tremendously knowledgeable and devoted Yankee media associate, often working 16 hours a day during the playoffs. He was invited by Major League Baseball to continue as an assistant in the playoffs. He was to graduate from The College of New Jersey this fall and regularly appeared on the Dean's List.

At 18,870 feet, after walking “without any purpose but ascent,” Bissell fell to his knees and wondered “how I would find the strength to make the last push up to the summit.” And then once there, what would he make of the experience?."
2007-10-25T00:00:00Z,"Standing at the top of the Monashee mountain range in Canada, just dropped off by helicopter along with a group of snowboarder friends and a guide, and now peering down at a 3,000-foot decent, Josh Dean had some jitters. Go figure. But with nowhere to go but down, Dean and his friends followed the guide’s path, and it didn’t take them long to realize that it would be no ordinary trip down a slope. In this issue’s Master Class, “Chairlifts Are for Sissies,” Dean details the joys of his first heli-trip as a newbie to snowboarding. He writes, “It took just one run -- no, more like a few hundred yards -- of floating at ludicrous speed on snow the consistency of flour to realize that in all my years of sliding around on snow, I had experienced nothing remotely like this. How was I going to take a chairlift seriously again?”."
2007-10-25T00:00:00Z,"It’s no secret that playing sports can cause serious back pain. And no wonder, given that a single, proper golf swing can produce almost 1,700 pounds of pressure on the spine. In this issue’s Phys Ed column, “Twist and Ouch,” Gretchen Reynolds sought answers to the question, “So what, if anything, can you do to preserve and protect your spine?” It helps, most experts agree, to have a solid core, the muscles and tendons and ligaments in the middle of the body that provide rigging for the spine. Endurance is crucial, too, she writes, especially in those core muscles, “since it keeps the stabilizing muscles and connective tissues going through a long workout or game.” Yes, it sounds like a lot of work, but there may be a silver lining: “Having a strong back, you will be happy to hear, means not doing sit-ups. Ever.”."

I am laying face down in a shallow irrigation ditch on the side of a dirt road. There is a lot of noise. The kind that can only be known in war. It is multiple medium-weight machine guns raining the terror of lead. I am looking around and seeing my friends in the same predicament. I also see dirt popping up inches from my face and body. This does not come from just anywhere. The dirt is flying into the air because there are 7.62-millimeter bullets landing everywhere. Was I scared? You bet your sweet life I was. This is when I realized that I was going to die. Not when I was old or even back home in St. Petersburg. I was going to die on a dirt road in a place that if it is not hell they share the same zip code. There was nothing I could do but wait.

I think Tolstoy wrote like a hedgehog, but acted like a fox. My father, a Russian literature professor, has been corresponding with me during this panel (as have many of my friends, notably one who recently translated Zamyatin's ""We,"" a book that should be more often read - at least as often as ""1984,"" which seems to have won the totalitarian futuristic fable competition). My father reminded me that Tolstoy did not bring his Olympian understanding of human nature to his own family life - at least, according to his wife Sofia Andreevna. In her letters (now on display at American University, along with photos of Yasnaya Polyana, the Tolstoy estate), she complains about his need to be treated like a god, and not to be bothered by daily concerns. He died, essentially, running away from home. But why can't a man's reach exceed his grasp? That 's not my question of course; it's Browning's."

2007-10-26T07:00:23Z,"I agree that it might be a good idea to read the book every five years, to note the astonishing way it seems to change as the world around us changes. I mentioned in an earlier post that I read the novel right after 9/11, and I remember thinking that the scene in which Pierre sees the French cook being flogged as a spy reminded me of the ways in which innocent Muslims were being targeted. Once more, the book seems relevant to the current moment. I only wish that the battles Tolstoy describes sounded less like the war in Iraq. Obviously, the weaponry and technology are very different. Satellite communications have replaced those poor messengers galloping in with the bad news; missiles and tanks have taken the place of muskets and stallions. And the military strategists no longer (literally) stand on the hilltops watching all hell break loose on the plains below. But nearly everything else - the inequities, the dispositions of power, the costly mistakes and the inadequate responses to those mistakes, the bloodshed and chaos and misery - all that seems painfully familiar. Old Kotuzov dies in his bed, and Napoleon and the Tsar aren't the ones being blown to bits at Borodino; young men were, and are still, taking the hit - so to speak - for the leaders who send them off to battle. I've always thought that Tolstoy's mini-essay, in Volume IV, on the difficulty of waging war against small, mobile, highly motivated bands of guerilla fighters should have been, and should be, required reading for everyone in the military, from rank and file soldiers to Pentagon planners, all the way up to the Secretary of Defense. Quite honestly, this has been, for me, the least pleasant aspect of rereading the novel: the sobering realization of how modern those sections seem, and of how little we appear to have learned in almost two centuries."

2007-10-26T00:00:00Z,"In its winter fiction issue, in December, The New Yorker plans to publish, in unedited form, a Raymond Carver story that appeared in a highly edited version in “What We Talk About When We Talk About Love,” Carver’s breakout 1981 collection. Tess Gallagher, Carver’s widow, is spearheading an effort to have all 17 of the stories in that book published, unedited, in a new volume that she plans to call “Beginners.” The stories were radically edited and cut by Gordon Lish, then Carver’s editor at Alfred A. Knopf. At the time, Carver tried to halt publication of the book, which cemented his literary reputation. Gary Fisketjon, Carver’s editor at Knopf later in his career, is opposed to her plans, partly because Carver had the chance to restore some of the stories to their unedited form in later collections. Andrew Wylie, the agent representing Ms. Gallagher and Carver’s literary estate in the effort to publish “Beginners,” said he and William L. Stull, a professor of English at the University of Hartford, and Mr. Stull’s wife, Maureen P. Carroll, adjunct professor of English and humanities at Hartford, are assembling a manuscript to submit to Knopf and Carver’s original foreign publishers sometime next month."

In New York, land of a thousand festivals, how can yet another multiweek arts extravaganza make a name for itself? It turns out that their answer — films, theater productions and musical performances following one another on the same stage each evening — creates a second problem: Faced with a lineup of three, four, even five offerings a night for one ticket, how can a festivalgoer make sense of the choices? Kelly Markus, executive director of Crown Point, has some advice: “Look at a night’s schedule and see if it’s got one thing on it you’re interested in. Go. You’re going to get a lot more.”."

Ms. Ronconi plays all of the characters in this solo show, which, though not autobiographical, is inspired by her experiences during a decade as a temp, she said in a telephone interview.

But when it comes to teeth, those years are filled with losses. It's no wonder that we have a compensatory ritual for every baby tooth that falls. That ritual drives the plot in ''Arthur Live!,'' above, a musical whose title character is the endearing third-grade aardvark in the ''Arthur Adventure'' storybooks and the PBS animated show they inspired. In the ''Arthur Live!'' production ''Arthur Tricks the Tooth Fairy,'' in New York and New Jersey as part of a nationwide tour, Arthur's little sister, the feisty D. W., becomes envious of Arthur's loss of his first tooth and the predictable gain that results: a dollar under his pillow."

2007-10-26T00:00:00Z,"BALLET DU GRAND THÉÂTRE DE GENÈVE Perhaps it's the beer and the chocolate. Belgium has produced an astonishing number of important contemporary choreographers during the last two decades, and the latest in that line is Sidi Larbi Cherkaoui. Born in Antwerp to a Flemish mother and a Moroccan father, and trained at Anne Teresa de Keersmaeker's school, Mr. Cherkaoui has been winning plaudits ever since he created his first piece in 2000. But as is the case for many of his peers, critical attention in Europe has not brought recognition in the United States. This weekend, however, the Ballet du Grand Théâtre de Genève, above, is performing Mr. Cherkaoui's ''Loin,'' on a program with pieces by Saburo Teshigawara and Andonis Foniadakis. Like much of Mr. Cherkaoui's work, ''Loin'' is a strange and compelling mix of dance, speech and song with elements of different historical ages and cultures. ''Loin'' (which means ''far'' in French) is set to the glorious 17th-century ''Mystery Sonatas'' by Biber, and its set suggests Arab latticework and veils."

2007-10-26T00:00:00Z,"WILLEM DE KOONING AT L&M ARTS AND GAGOSIAN GALLERY The coincidence of these two shows is a reminder of the delights of a late flourishing in the career of this great artist. A protean abstract painter with a dire drinking habit, de Kooning put aside the bottle in 1980 and began a new phase, one that still divides experts. But as is evident from the more than 40 monumental paintings, most dating from about 1979 to 1986, between these shows, he painted some indisputably magnificent pictures in his final working decade. (He did his last work in 1990; he died in 1997.) Picture for picture, the L&M Arts exhibition is stronger: it is more tightly focused, with a handpicked selection of some of the best of late de Kooning. Gagosian Gallery has great pictures too, including a wonderful work on loan from the Museum of Modern Art, ''Pirate (Untitled II)'' (1981), but the show is padded out with some noticeably weaker pictures from the mid to late 1980s and, a little confusingly, even a few 1950s works. The artist was on fire in 1981, also producing ''Untitled VI,'' left, a painting, featured at L&M, that is in a private collection but really belongs in a museum. It has a free-flowing energy and animal dynamism reminiscent of his early portraits. As for the rest of the late paintings, they are a tremendously varied lot, each requiring prolonged consideration. But it's all worth it. (Through Nov. 17, ''Willem de Kooning 1981-1986,'' L&M Arts, 45 East 78th Street, Manhattan, 212-861-0020, lmgallery.com; through tomorrow, ''Willem de Kooning: The Last Beginning,'' Gagosian Gallery, 522 West 21st Street, Chelsea, 212-741-1717, gagosian.com.)

In New York, land of a thousand festivals, how can yet another multiweek arts extravaganza make a name for itself? It turns out that their answer -- films, theater productions and musical performances following one another on the same stage each evening -- creates a second problem: Faced with a lineup of three, four, even five offerings a night for one ticket, how can a festivalgoer make sense of the choices? Kelly Markus, executive director of Crown Point, has some advice: ''Look at a night's schedule and see if it's got one thing on it you're interested in. Go. You're going to get a lot more.'' The festival is concentrating on unfamiliar work, like the animated short ''Eel-Stripe,'' above, on Tuesday and Nov. 17, and the Waterwell troupe's ''Persians: A Comedy About War With Five Songs'', on Wednesday and Nov. 5. ''It's like watching the birth of the Wooster Group,'' Ms. Markus said. She pointed to the eclectic opening-night bill as typical of the carefully organized evenings: The musical ''Hostages'' leads into the short film ''Death to the Tinman''; another theater piece, ''At the Seashore''; the animated ''Ballad of Mary Slade''; and the Brooklyn band Hopewell."

2007-10-26T00:00:00Z,"'WAR AND PEACE' How do you film ''War and Peace''? As if to match the enormity of its source material, Sergei Bondarchuk's 1968 adaptation racked up some impressive numbers. It cost $100 million in 1960s currency (still the most expensive movie ever made), took five years to shoot and used more than 100,000 extras from the Soviet Army. The money, manpower and sheer chutzpah that went into filming this ''War and Peace'' are certainly impressive. But even more so is that Mr. Bondarchuk, who also plays Pierre, managed to make such a personal, even quirky movie. He uses a kind of toolbox approach to directing, trying anything he can think of to create visual analogues to Tolstoy's prose and philosophy: split screens; hand-held camera; soaring images taken from high above; grand, swooping shots of trees, clouds and sky. Brooding voice-overs (everybody muses about death) help get you inside the characters' heads and inside the novel. (One bonus: watching the film will almost certainly make you want to read or reread the book.)"

While I use interviews from The Times's business and science sections, I do not use Deborah Solomon's work. Her interviews routinely belabor her cleverness at the expense of her subjects.Her questionable methods come as no surprise. Such hostile questions and quips could hardly have elicited all the responses she claims. More disquieting to me as a Times reader, however, was the reaction of Gerald Marzorati, the editor of the magazine. I agree with your assessment that just because Ms. Solomon's interviews are ""an entertainment"" doesn't mean she can disregard The Times's standards. I'm left wondering if everything in the magazine is ""an entertainment.""Nicole ArchambeauSanta Barbara, Calif., Oct. 16, 2007●I had always believed that ""Questions For"" was a verbatim transcription of a brief interview. To find that it is Deborah Solomon's willy-nilly editing of an hour-long conversation is something different. In the future, I will skip reading it. I don't consider it New York Times-quality reporting.Chris AltweggSeattle, Oct. 14, 2007●What stuck me like a lightning bolt was your statement that the ""Questions For"" column is viewed by its writer and editors as entertainment.While I understand and appreciate the pressure that cable stations and Internet blogs impose on traditional news, the fact is that The New York Times has been the gold standard of newspapers because of the journalist standards that the paper has imposed on itself. If those standards are being abandoned, fine. But please, let us know that this is the case, that The Times is no better that the countless competitors online and in print.Richard DashefskyPhiladelphia, Pa., Oct. 15, 2007●Deborah Solomon's misquotation and self-promotion are exactly what reporters should never do.Her manipulations cast an extremely negative light on The Times, and make readers wonder: If the paper refuses to discipline a reporter who exaggerates and distorts trivial matters, how does it handle what is really important?Simon DeDeoChicago, Oct. 15, 2007●You paint a dismaying portrait of the care with which the Times Magazine's ""Questions For"" column is produced.Add to the criticisms the failure of the questioner Deborah Solomon or the Magazine's editors to disclose, in a June 26, 2005, interview with Bruce Ratner, the Atlantic Yards developer and New Jersey Nets principal owner, that Mr. Ratner's company was a development partner of The New York Times Company in building its new headquarters.Byron Calame, the public editor at the time, chastised The Times in his Web journal for the failure to disclose such ties, but no letter or disclosure was ever printed.Norman OderBrooklyn, Oct. 15, 2007The writer writes the Atlantic Yards Report, a blog devoted to the Atlantic Yards project.●Thanks for raising some of the troubling issues surrounding quotations in The Times Magazine. This deals with one of the most important - but rarely discussed - challenges facing reporters and interviewers: how to capture the spoken word and put it in type.As a former newspaper journalist and longtime teacher of news writing, I know that we even have a tough time quoting material that's easy to look up and verify. (Consider the alterations to the iconic Vietnam-era utterance: ""It became necessary to destroy the town to save it."")You covered the issue of whether or not there's a ""protocol"" or manual for the handling of quotations. You mentioned The Times's Manual of Style and Usage, which is very clear on the topic. The Associated Press's style book has gone through changes over the past few decades and reads similarly. Frank HerronWinchester, Mass., Oct. 16, 2007The writer is an adjunct instructor of political science at UMass Boston.●I have been appalled to see the inclusion of these bogus ""interviews."" Deborah Solomon's sole intent seems to be to skewer, disrespect, and hurt her subjects. Her columns are devoid of genuine content, at most reflecting the interviewee's ability to respond gracefully to hostile sniping.It is no surprise that Ms. Solomon has been playing fast and loose with her questions and editing. Here is one loud plea for the magazine to drop ""Questions For"" entirely, with an apology to readers for having published it for so long.Lyn OppenheimFelton, Calif., Oct. 17, 2007●For years, I have been uncomfortable reading the ""Questions For"" column. Now I know why.Usually the challenging questions read more like an attempt to trap the famous person. This may entertain some, but it doesn't work for me. In fact - even beyond not living up to The Times's standards - it is blatantly rude.Sharon AucoinNorth Andover, Mass., Oct. 15, 2007●I agree with your view that the Deborah Solomon ""Questions For"" columns need a disclaimer noting that they are the result, frequently, of several different interviews or contacts, and that the order has been altered or new questions inserted for ""readability.""I find many of her columns snarky and mean-spirited, and to realize that they are largely stitched together on her whim is even more disturbing. The magazine's editors really have given way too much free rein here.Many of us were taught that quotes were sacrosanct, and use ellipses or brackets when we truncate or otherwise edit quoted material. I think it's unfair to readers to pass off a crazy quilt of questions and answers as an ""interview,"" though what an accurate label should be isn't clear.

2007-10-27T15:56:01Z,"Re ""The Reality in Iraq? Depends on Who's Counting"" (Oct. 7):I worked out of The New York Times Baghdad bureau from November 2003 to May 2007. One of the main points you addressed, how the military defines sectarian killings, has long been a major point of contention in Iraq.Reporters there have never had a clear picture of the military definition of the term. A question at the heart of the debate is whether the military counts bombing victims, including ones from the ubiquitous car bombs, when tallying deaths from sectarian violence. You cite a military manual that says the victims of such bombings should be counted.But while in Iraq, I found that in practice, the top commanders generally did not count deaths from bombings as sectarian killings, even though it is clear to even the most casual observer of the war that the bombings are motivated by sectarian and ethnic hatreds. Rocket and mortar attacks also were not counted.Instead, at least during my time in Iraq, American commanders usually counted only people shot dead as victims of sectarian violence. The reasons are obscure. Some critics of the military say the commanders might have done this because it would be easier at some point to prove a downward trend in violence if one looked only at victims killed in shootings, rather than victims killed in shootings and bombings. The American military and Shiite-led Iraqi government have yet to find a way of ending the horrific bombings carried out by Sunni Arab insurgents.Only once did a military officer articulate the military's point of view on this issue to me. A top general in Baghdad told me the military had chosen to limit its definition of sectarian killings because it wanted to track specifically the type of violence that occurred by shooting, because some officers apparently believed that this type of killing, rather than bombings and projectile attacks, was a more accurate indicator of the level of Shiite-Sunni sectarian hatred out in the streets.Some critics have said that another reason for leaving bombings outside the definition of sectarian violence is directly related to the Bush administration's pronouncements on Al Qaeda in Mesopotamia. The military usually attributes large bombings to Al Qaeda in Mesopotamia, and its spokesmen still claim that Al Qaeda in Mesopotamia is trying to ""ignite"" or ""inflame"" sectarian civil war in Iraq rather than acknowledging that the largely Sunni Arab group is a crucial player in one side of an already raging Iraqi civil war.As you noted in an earlier column, American officials have long sought to depict Al Qaeda in Mesopotamia as an outside organization with close ties to Osama bin Laden that seeks to destroy the Sunni-Shiite ""relationship"" in Iraq. Actually, Al Qaeda in Mesopotamia is a component of the Sunni-Shiite civil war, not an outside element. As you know, the reality is that a vast majority of members of Al Qaeda in Mesopotamia are Iraqi Sunnis who are trying to overthrow the Shiite-run Iraqi government.So critics of the military have asserted that the military has in practice sought to remove bombing victims from the definition of ""sectarian killings"" so that bomb attacks, and their victims, would not be seen as part of an Iraqi civil war. Rather, they would be counted as part of the ""terrorist"" actions done by Al Qaeda in Mesopotamia, which military spokesmen and Bush administration officials have for years tried to portray as an outside force, not one that is part of the internal Iraqi dynamic.In other words, whether to count bombings when measuring sectarian violence has become embroiled in the politics of defining the main narrative of the Iraq war. Critics say the less the war looks like an internal civil war and the more it looks like a front in the global jihad movement or in the Western war against ""Islamo-fascism,"" the more the Bush administration can justify its policies and the continuing American military presence in Iraq.The bottom line is that car bombs and other types of bombings, as well as rocket and mortar attacks, are major tactics in the ethno-sectarian civil war that has been unfolding in Iraq for years, and should by anyone's definition be counted as sectarian violence.Edward WongTaipei, Taiwan, Oct. 7, 2007●Be it 1,654, 1,280 or 827, the number of Iraqi civilians being killed every month is a horrific tragedy. These ""numbers"" are actually human beings - mothers, fathers, sons and daughters - and this is not acceptable.Nor is the tragedy in this country acceptable - 30,000 civilian deaths every year from gunshot wounds. Why isn't this number reported on a regular basis, along with the 65,000 wounded?The cost in dollars for medical care is about $15 billion annually and, the cost in human suffering is incalculable. If these figures were coming out of Iraq - 2,500 Americans dead and more than 5,000 wounded a month - the war would be over. Why do we accept this casualty rate on our local streets with no discussion and little dismay while we (quite rightly) give at least some attention to civilian deaths in Iraq?Andrea CukorBerkeley, Calif., Oct. 8, 2007●"

Even though Matsuzaka was 0 for 4 with the Red Sox this season, I watched videotape of him in two games in Koshien, Japan's famous high school tournament, for an article last February and felt he had a sweet swing. He hit cleanup for his high school and I was guessing that he hadn't totally lost his stroke. So while I was at lunch with my Times colleagues Tyler Kepner and Ben Shpigel, and Mike Vaccaro and Joel Sherman of The New York Post, I predicted that Dice-K would get a hit. My prediction didn't cause a stir. No one stopped chewing. The waitress didn't write it down. But I wanted to have my thoughts on the record. Sure enough, when Matsuzaka batted in the third inning against Josh Fogg, he rapped a single into left field to drive in two runs. Matsuzaka gave Boston a 6-0 lead and made himself look great. He also made me look good. I can brag for about three seconds over lunch today."

2007-10-28T00:00:00Z,"DRUCKER--Byrd, 78, died peacefully on October 25 surrounded by his loving family in New York City. The beloved husband of Janet for 57 extraordinary and memorable years, he is also survived by his adoring children, Carol, William and his wife Rhonda, and his youngest daughter, Abby, as well as three amazing grandchildren, Elizabeth, Sarah Beth and Matthew. His older brothers, Joseph, Simon, and David Drucker predeceased him. He was especially devoted to his sister-inlaw, Anita Caminiti, who showered him with laughter, kindness and an abundance of Italian cuisine. He met Janet at 15 in Williamsburg, Brooklyn, where they were both raised, and their lives have been inextricably linked ever since. After enlisting in the U.S. Army at 17, he served as a paratrooper in World War II. A graduate of Boys High School in Brooklyn, with both a B.A. and an M.A. from Brooklyn College, he was a devoted teacher of economics and history for 35 years for the New York City Board of Education. An educational innovator, he developed an alternative school at Thomas Jefferson High School in Brooklyn, which prepared high-school graduates for immediate entry onto a career track. He was the Executive Director of Camp Louemma, part of the Federation of Jewish Philanthropies, in Glenwood, New Jersey, for 17 years. During this time, he mentored young people in the social work field and created a wonderful camping experience for thousands of New York City children, in the process forming life-long bonds with many of the campers. In 1976, Byrd, along with his wife, Janet, founded Drucker Antiques, which is now operated by their son, William. Their shared passion for art, antiques and design created a business that has cultivated a worldwide appreciation for Georg Jensen silver. His passion, knowledge and perseverance enabled his wife, Janet, to complete her labor of love, the authoritative monograph on Georg Jensen silver, ''Georg Jensen: A Traditional of Splendid Silver,'' now in its second edition. In their 60s, they embarked on a new adventure, and moved from their longtime home in Canarsie, Brooklyn, into Manhattan, where they truly felt like every day was a holiday. He enjoyed summering in the Adirondacks and East Hampton. A passionate New York Knicks fan, whether they won or lost, he was a gracious sportsman and an avid swimmer. Byrd will always be remembered for his humor, intelligence, curiosity, persistence, courage, kindness, wisdom, and his ability to savor every moment of joy. Family was most important to him, and in his mind, a man's wealth could be measured by his abundance of loving family and friends, and in this regard, he was the richest of men, and will be sorely missed. One of the greatest lessons he imparted to his children and grandchildren was that the only things that could limit them were their own dreams. A memorial service will be held, Sunday, October 28, at 11:45am at Riverside Memorial Chapel, 180 West 76th Street, at Amsterdam Avenue."
2007-10-28T00:00:00Z,"WILLIAMS--Anne Wright. Died peacefully at home in New York City on October 20, 2007. She was 85 years old.

Luckily for New Yorkers, our best hope of salvaging it may lie with our state senator, Charles Schumer. The farm bill should be the government's best effort to guide how American farmers grow food and how we all eat. Instead this anachronistic piece of legislation rewards a minority of Midwestern farmers and the commodity giants that buy from them. According to United States Department of Agriculture data, just 10 percent of all farmers, almost entirely in the center of the country, collect 62 percent of the taxpayer dollars. The majority of farmers, including those here in New York, don't receive any subsidies because they grow fruits and vegetables, not the corn, wheat, soy, rice and cotton supported by the bill."

He was the founder and former President of Sulzer Brothers USA, a subsidiary of the Swiss multinational engineering and manufacturing firm Sulzer Brothers Ltd. Richard was born in 1909 in St. Moritz, in the Swiss Alps. He grew up in Paris, where his father directed the French business of the JP Morgan Bank. He went to school in Paris and in Switzerland, and earned a Masters degree in Mechanical Engineering from the Swiss Federal Institute of Technology in Zurich. Richard began his career in the automobile industry in Michigan and Indiana, participating in the design of several new car engines. Hired by Sulzer Brothers, he established corporate headquarters in downtown New York, close to the shipping and textile industries, and to financial centers. The company prospered, having the right new products at the right moment. He remained President for 35 years. Richard was proud of many of the projects of Sulzer Brothers USA. Shortly after WWII began, Sulzer began large-scale production of marine diesel engines for anti-submarine destroyers escorting shipping convoys. Sulzer USA engineered the pumping plant in the Tehachapi Mountains of central California, bringing water from the Feather River to Los Angeles and San Bernadino. Sulzer developed the revolutionary projectile weaving machine, four times faster than any looms then in existence. In 1943 Richard married Johanne Randlov, from Denmark. Initially living in New York, they moved to Far Hills, New Jersey, where they lived for 40 years. After Richard's retirement, they moved to Lyme, New Hampshire, to an old farmhouse on 120 acres they discovered by chance. In 2000 they moved to an apartment at the Kendal Community in Hanover.

How can one man so dominate the game?

He's voracious: Boras is ruthless about going after players he wants. This might make him some enemies among other agents, but it certainly doesn't make him many enemies among players. He has A-Rod: The man on whom he built his empire has never been in a more powerful position.

Now that he has been exiled from San Francisco's AT&T Park -- which means the Giants' best hitter next year may be Barry Zito -- Bonds could rival A-Rod in the volume of chatter generated. It's impossible to tell which teams might have an interest in Bonds; presumably he's more attractive to American League clubs as a designated hitter, even though his defense isn't as bad as people think. Oakland is a possibility, as is San Diego, but it may just come down to how little money he's willing to sign for. If he drops his price a bit, the number of potential suitors will multiply, ranging from Toronto to the Cubs to even St. Louis. But before you ask: no, he won't land in the Bronx or Flushing."

2007-10-28T00:00:00Z,"My first exposure to the precarious social status of the professional field-goal kicker came unexpectedly, at a game between the Detroit Lions and the New Orleans Saints on Nov. 8, 1970. There were just two seconds left, and the Saints were losing, which wasn't unusual. The unusual thing was that the game was still close: 17-16. The Saints had the ball, and a field goal would win it -- except the ball was in the Saints' half of the field, on the 43-yard line. And the record distance the ball would have to travel -- 63 yards -- was only the first of the kicker's problems. He was kicking from a dirt surface churned up like a World War I battlefield. The ball would need to cut through the thick, humid New Orleans air and into the closed end of Tulane Stadium, where the wind swirled unpredictably. On top of all that, the kicker lacked the most basic requirement for his job: a foot. His name was Tom Dempsey, and he was born without fingers on his right hand or toes on his right foot. The gnarled stub of his arm jutted from his jersey with an effect, to my 9-year-old mind, so grotesque that even from a great distance my first instinct was to look away. The foot, however, wasn't repellent -- less a malformed appendage than the business end of a useful tool. Other professional football teams had kickers. We had a sledgehammer, or the head of a 1-wood, attached to the end of a 260-pound cripple."

2007-10-28T00:00:00Z,"Late in the workday, do you ever get the craving to watch a rugby match? Me neither, but thanks to the newly re-launched ESPN360, it's possible to plug into an IV drip of nonstop sporting events. ESPN360 is a broadband service that functions as a control room for the cable empire's many GameCasts. Once you sign up for 360 (which is free with certain broadband providers; go to espn360.com for details), you can configure your computer screen to show as many as 10 games at a time, either live ones or the recently aired. (Typically, a college football game will air live on 360 and then appear in the archives immediately afterward.) On a recent afternoon, I filled up my monitor with the following: a Brazil-versus-Denmark women's soccer game; a rugby match between clubs called Hindu and Sic; the X Games; a West Virginia University football press conference; and -- a profoundly interesting discovery -- Mexican college football. What's more, I could monitor all of them without the whiplash attendant to sitting in a sports bar. ESPN 360 is faintly reminiscent of the early days of the cable channel, when ESPN would fill airtime with the ''exotics.'' A familiar complaint about ESPN these days is that it doesn't show enough sports. Petrifying in my office chair in front of 360, I had the opposite thought: is it possible to show too much?"

Company grade officers and staff non-commissioned officers usually change jobs within the unit every 12 to 18 months, and some field grade officers may serve an entire three-year tour in the same job before transferring units. The intent is to create marines that are well-rounded, have experienced a variety of responsibilities, and are ready to tackle a myriad of tasks. Furthermore, if you don't like the way things are running, just wait a while - they'll change.

Anne had been born in New York City, and was a lifelong resident of East Hampton, Long Island, having spent part of every year of her life there. She grew up there with her parents, Anne and John Wright, and beginning in 1941 she lived in a house on Woods Lane. During her childhood in East Hampton, she was an avid tennis player and horsewoman. Anne was first married to Matthew A. Baxter of Cleveland, Ohio. His paternal grandparents, the George White Baxters, lived in East Hampton. The marriage ended in divorce in 1953.

Of those 11 times, only five of the candidates who were leading in national polls in January won the nomination: Adlai E. Stevenson in 1956, John F. Kennedy in 1960, Walter F. Mondale in 1984, Bill Clinton in 1992 and Al Gore in 2000. The so-called front-runners who did not win the nomination included Estes Kefauver in 1952 (Stevenson won), Lyndon B. Johnson, who shared the lead with Robert F. Kennedy in 1968 (Hubert H. Humphrey was nominated after Johnson dropped out and Kennedy was assassinated), Edmund S. Muskie, left, in 1972 (overtaken by George McGovern), Edward M. Kennedy in 1976 (Jimmy Carter pulled ahead), Jesse Jackson and Gary Hart in 1988 (Michael S.

2007-10-31T18:32:50Z,"The discussion this week of the translator's art has made for a fascinating round, and has brought out some perceptive comments from readers. For a former foreign correspondent - and an editor with reporters dispersed around the globe - this is a discussion with decidedly extra-literary implications. While we try to assign correspondents overseas who are fluent in the relevant language, there is no way that a paper as serious about international news as The Times can operate without interpreters. Many, many interpreters. As a reporter, I've worked with native interpreters of languages from Armenian to Zulu, and have come to believe that the craft of working with an interpreter is at least as important in our line of work as the mastery of languages. The obvious imperative in working with a translator is to get the facts right. (Witness the recent dispute over what Ahmadinejad actually said about gays during his speech at Columbia University.) But beyond that, it's about getting the voice right. The quality of a translation goes not just to accuracy of detail or intent, not just to felicity of language, but to clarity, nuance and credibility. An intellectual who makes a powerful point in Polish or Pashto can sound less convincing in a clumsy translation. A good translation can convey the charisma of a rabble-rouser, the egotism of a tyrant, the wit of a poet, the heartbreak of a victim; a bad translation can deny us the sense of character."

But, helpfully, there are many on the Web who can stomach more than I can. There is Clark Judge from cbssportsline.com, who says that winning this game is the only way the Colts are going to get to the Super Bowl. NFL.com's Gil Brandt goes way back to 1921 to put all this in perspective. MSNBC.com's Steve Silverman provides some perspective, too, but by looking back to the storied 49ers-Cowboys clashes of the 1990s. Yahoo.com's Michael Silver takes it all in and declares Randy Moss to be a rousing success. Really. And, finally, in case you don't want to bother with the real thing, ESPN.com used a computer to predict the winner, and it's the Patriots. Never mind that foxsports.com did the same thing, and it's the Colts."

After meeting at the University of Pennsylvania, Ken and Gail had a loving marriage for 34 years. He was a graduate of the University of Pennsylvania School of Dental Medicine and the Benjamin N. Cardozo School of Law. Ken practiced dentistry in Bergen County, finding joy in improving the smiles of his patients; he found such great satisfaction from his work that he hoped never to retire. Ken was an avid historian and classical music fan, who emphasized learning above all else. He inspired his sons to reach for their dreams and, in 2009, all four boys will complete their educations, having collectively earned four Ivy League undergraduate degrees and six graduate degrees in medicine, law, business, and public policy. Ken took incredible pride in these accomplishments and was a driving force behind them. He spent most of the last 14 years hopping between university campuses to share in the intellectual endeavors of his children, leading them to nickname him the ''Visiting Professor.''

The fright fest continues with ''The Old Dark House'' (1932), above, at 12:30 a.m.; ''Die, Monster, Die!'' (1965) at 2; ''The Walking Dead'' (1936) at 3:30; and the eerie ''Isle of the Dead'' (1945), with Karloff as a Greek military commander marooned on an island infected by a plague, at 4:45. 8 P.M. (NBC) PHENOMENON Criss Angel and Uri Geller watch over this live two-hour Halloween episode in which six competing mentalists demonstrate their talents and two others are sent home. Presumably they saw it coming."

2007-11-01T00:00:00Z,"TAYLOR--Ann Bonfoey, died peacefully at her Denver home on Sunday, October 28, 2007 surrounded by loving family members. Born December 3, 1910 in Ardmore, PA and raised in Quincy, IL. Ann exhibited an early passion when as a six year old her father introduced her to flying in open two-seater biplanes. At twelve years of age her father hired a pilot to teach Ann to fly and despite the then all-male atmosphere of the age and a resentful teacher, Ann learned to fly and loved it. Married to James Cooke in 1928. They had two children, Diane and Jay. Early in their marriage, Ann's expertise at tennis led her to competing at Wimbleton. Ann moved to Vermont after marrying. Ever the sportswoman, she started ski racing in Stowe, acquiring the nickname Nose-dive Annie. She became an alternate in 1939 on the Womens Olympic Ski Team, skiing until her late 80s. Ann's marriage to James ended. She then turned to civil engineering and the study of flying, leading to the pursuit of a pilot's license. When World War II broke out, she became a flight instructor for flight students, which included Navy and Army pilots. After the end of the war, Ann returned to Stowe where a great sense of style led her to design her own ski clothing which became very popular. Very shortly her clothing appeared on the covers of Harpers Bazaar and other magazines and in the Fifth Avenue windows of Lord and Taylor, as well as other prominent Fifth Avenue retailers. In l947, after a whirlwind courtship, Ann married Vernon ''Moose'' Taylor, Jr., of Indiana, PA and San Antonio, TX. Ann realized her new-found success would have practical limits and decided to give up her new career to become a full-time wife and mother. In l954 Ann and ''Moose'' moved to Denver where they raised their family. It was in Denver that Ann developed a passion for horses and become an expert in dressage, hunting and jumping which she and ''Moose'' engaged in not only in Denver, but also in Middleburg, Virginia and Leicestershire, England, riding into their late 80s. ''Moose'', even in their earliest courtship said he wanted to build a ski house with Ann. In l963, as one of the founders of Vail, they built one of the first ski chalets in the new town where they thrived skiing with family and friends over 40 years. In addition to Vail, Ann and ''Moose'' had a cattle ranch in Montana where they held their annual Fourth of July gettogether for family and friends from around the world for many years. Ann also served on the Advisory Board of the American Associates of the Royal Academy Trust and the World Wildlife Fund. Ann was predeceased by her daughter Diane Cooke and grandson Ryan Taylor. She is survived by her loving husband and children, Jay Cooke (Gail) of New York City; Vernon Taylor, III (Naomi Marks) of Long Island; Douglas Taylor (Monica) of New York City; Robert Taylor (Joni) of Vail; and Craig Taylor (Michelle) of Santa Barbara, California and eleven grandchildren. A private service is being held for family members.

This documentary by Hilla Medalia chronicles that heart-rending encounter four years after the bombing. ''The film doesn't suggest a solution to the conflict, but it unabashedly explores the difficulties, fears and gaps between opposing sides,'' Ms. Medalia has said.

""Be patient with him,"" Forster urged. ""He does not go with a swing, and only gradually draws you into his mesh. And be intelligent. It is so easy to read books stupidly, not with our full powers, and Proust makes no concessions to stupidity. Some writers - and they are great writers - do make concessions. Dickens does, for instance, and even Tolstoy does. Proust doesn't. He expects a constant awareness, both from the mind and from the senses."""

In between it shows you, well, everything: the sewers and sparkling office buildings; factories, printing presses and mechanized gewgaws in shop windows; postmen, milkmen, street cleaners; schoolchildren and bustling street life; dogs and cats (and an elephant and hippo); horse-drawn carts, cars and trains (lots and lots of trains). Before directing ''Symphony of a City'' -- showing tomorrow as part of Carnegie Hall's ''Berlin in Lights'' series, in partnership with the Museum of Modern Art -- Ruttmann made avant-garde films, evident here in his accent on form and the flow of images. Laurence Kardish, senior curator in MoMA's department of film, said that while ''Symphony'' was ''made with the idea that a score would be played with it,'' the visual aspect ''carries its own rhythm, its own velocity, its own speed.'' Because the original score, by Edmund Meisel (who also wrote music for ''Battleship Potemkin'') was lost, Mr. Kardish said that he, like many movie scholars, only knows ''the film as a silent work.''"

2007-11-02T00:00:00Z,"'THE USUAL FREAK SHOW' In the mid-1980s Jeffrey Essmann was writing and performing satirical character comedy, revuelike shows that were neither theater nor exactly cabaret. ''The whole East Village thing was kicking in,'' he said recently, describing a scene busy with performers trying new things in joints now long gone. ''It wasn't even worth remembering the names of the clubs because they only lasted a few weekends.'' His sidekick, who composed and played the piano in shows like ''Jeffrey Essmann's Artificial Reality,'' was Michael John LaChiusa, who yet to write the musicals ''The Wild Party'' and ''See What I Wanna See.'' Despite good reviews into the early 1990s, Mr. Essmann, above, eventually became frustrated that his career was not taking off. ''As far as I was concerned I was still working in a video store,'' he said. So he left for Chicago."

2007-11-02T00:00:00Z,"CABARET CONVENTION The durability of the New York Cabaret Convention is a reassuring sign of continuity in a show business climate where mass recognition nowadays can be as fleeting as a flash of YouTube notoriety. Celebrating its 18th year, this long-running fusion of national trade show and marathon concert series was founded by Donald Smith, the intrepidly dedicated executive director of the Mabel Mercer Foundation. The four concerts, Monday through Thursday, honor the great American songbook (with British side trips) and the performers who bring it to life. It's one of the few big-ticket musical events in which yesterday becomes today and tomorrow."

2007-11-02T00:00:00Z,"MAYHEM POETS When Scott Raven Tarazevits, above right, proclaims from the stage of the New Victory Theater -- an enterprise devoted to family audiences -- how much he loves breasts and thighs, you may be tempted to cover the ears of the child sitting next to you. But it soon becomes clear that this isn't necessary. The juicy breasts and thighs Mr. Tarazevits is drooling over are the kind found at a barbecue, not a brothel. And before long his onstage compatriots, Kyle Sutton, above left, and Mason Granger, have leapt into the audience, busily flapping and clucking their accompaniment. Mr. Tarazevits's ode to chicken is just one of the ways that he, Mr. Sutton and Mr. Granger, collectively known as Mayhem Poets, subvert expectations. Although their spoken-word performances derive from hip-hop, their material wouldn't make your grandmother blush, and there's nothing gangsta about their pose. (Their message is to write, not fight.) Having met several years ago as students at Rutgers University, the young men have said that their name is a play on the world-domination Mayhem Project mentioned in the film ''Fight Club.'' But their only weapon is words, specifically the snappy, streetwise art known as slam poetry."

2007-11-02T00:00:00Z,"MARIA HASSABI For many Americans the word ''dancer'' has implications that go beyond the artistic. As the choreographer Maria Hassabi pointed out recently, ''You meet some people and say, 'I'm a dancer,' and they say, 'Oh, you must be so flexible,' and there's always a sexual connotation there.'' In ''Gloria,'' which opens Wednesday at Performance Space 122, Ms. Hassabi, above, plays with and ultimately pushes beyond those sexual implications. A formal, strongly female duet for herself and the wondrous Hristoula Harakas, this evening-length piece, which Ms. Hassabi describes as ''live sculpture,'' often has the two women taking poses that some might find provocative, such as spreading their legs wide. But the dancers hold these positions for so long that the sexual layers peel away. Created separately, the solos inhabit the same space but are not linked other than through the connections viewers make, Ms. Hassabi said. When ''you're walking behind two people'' on the street, she explained, they might not be together ''but you see them in one frame in front of you; you make relationships.''"

Never mind that the museum's aged guards, played by Dick Van Dyke, Mickey Rooney and Bill Cobbs, seem to have something up their uniform sleeves.

At his fourth restaurant, Les Cocottes de Christian Constant (135, rue Saint-Dominique), the celebrated chef Constant says he evokes his “mother’s cuisine for a younger generation” with individual pots filled with seasonal ingredients like pigeon roasted with figs. (Staub casseroles are also for sale.) Coco & Co (11, rue Bernard Palissy; 011-33-1-45-44-02-52), a just-opened cafe devoted to the egg, offers 20 cocotted versions and also allows for custom creations. And a bit of wordplay — cocotte is also a term of endearment used between girlfriends — informed the name of the new food bookshop/patisserie La Cocotte (below; 5, rue Paul Bert; 011-33-1-43-73-04-02), which is run by four women. This month, the store invites the chef and cookbook author Sonia Ezgulian to host a night of TV dinners. On the menu? Cocottes, of course. For information, go to www.lacocotte.net."

This fall, Tsar Nicoulai, the San Francisco purveyor known for its domestic caviar, will introduce trout and whitefish roe infused with the likes of kaffir lime leaf, brandy and vanilla. The unusual collection, called Passot Roe, came about because Roland Passot, the chef who owns La Folie restaurant, began experimenting with adding flavors to trout roe, which has a firm, almost crunchy texture and is fairly inexpensive. “It’s like perfume: it’s subtle,” says Passot, who created the line “to have fun with.” His idea of fun might be monkfish foie gras served with potato salad sprinkled with truffle caviar. (For the rest of us, toast points and a dollop of crème franche with vanilla trout caviar will have to do.) A roster of international chefs is being tapped for future flavors. A gift set — with beet and saffron, truffled tiger-eye and wasabi whitefish roe, along with vanilla bean trout caviar — is being sold through the Williams-Sonoma catalog and Web site this holiday season. Passot Roe is also available at www.tsarnicoulai.com."

Designed by Alexandra Deschamps-Sonsino and Karola Torkos, using the undulating circles and lines used in topography maps, Topoware bowls are marked “full,” “hungry” and “very hungry”; plates read “modest,” “moderate” and “greedy.” The pine place mats point to where your table setting goes. “We borrowed the visual language of geography,” explains Deschamps-Sonsino, who is based in London. “I don’t think our collection is going to change the world, but we do want it to cause a moment of self-reflection.” Go to www.topoware.org."

Still, a Tahitian woman with her dress hiked up around her waist, squatting in the water, may not be the most appealing image, especially for the estimated price of $40 million to $60 million. Warhol's ''Liz,'' owned by the actor Hugh Grant, also carries a hefty estimate. But experts say the image is heavy-handed and not as sharp as the 12 other Elizabeth Taylor paintings in the series.

It's just as busy on Nov. 13: William Holden made his film debut alongside the woman he credited with saving his career, Barbara Stanwyck, in the movie version of Clifford Odets's great play ''Golden Boy''; Charlotte Rampling falls for a chimp in Nagisa Oshima's ''Max Mon Amour''; ''Live Free or Die Hard'' proves to be the most subversive entry in the action franchise, while action of another kind can be seen in Werner Herzog's Vietnam epic, ''Rescue Dawn''; cheer or be appalled at the B-movie smash ''Walking Tall,'' there's no denying the proficiency of Phil Karlson's direction; Eurosleaze fans can rejoice over the second volume of the luscious Laura Gemser in ''Black Emanuelle's Box,'' from the cheerfully perverse folks at Severin Films; and -- finally -- the home video release of Charles Burnett's revered ''Killer of Sheep.'' Charlize Theron fans retain fond memories of her in ''2 Days in the Valley''; see why on Nov. 20. The musical version of ''Hairspray'' comes to DVD the same day, as does a new edition of the famed art film ''I Am Cuba.''

Two different kinds of outsiders highlight releases that day: Catherine Deneuve, above, does very bad things in Roman Polanski's ''Repulsion,'' and Jonah Hill and Michael Cera do superbad -- and supersweet -- things in ''Superbad.'' ''Mr. Bean's Holiday'' (Dec. 11) leaves a sweet aftertaste. What is being called the final cut of ''Blade Runner'' comes out in several editions (Dec. 18).

2007-11-04T00:00:00Z,"GREBB--Jack A., M.D., a psychiatrist who worked for 15 years leading the development of various psychiatric, neurologic, and pain drugs at pharmaceutical companies, died on November 1. He was 54. The cause was esophageal cancer. Dr. Grebb graduated from Mount Hermon School, and obtained his B.A. and M.D. degree's from the University of Vermont. Dr. Grebb completed his psychiatric internship and residency at the University of California at San Francisco, after which he completed a research fellowship at the National Institute of Mental Health in Washington, DC. Following his training, Dr. Grebb held joint academic appointments at the Laboratory of Molecular and Cellular Neuroscience at The Rockefeller University, and in the Department of Psychiatry at New York University Medical Center. His major areas of research interest were schizophrenia, substance abuse, and the study of signal transduction in the nervous system. In 1992, Dr. Grebb started work at Abbott Laboratories, and subsequently moved to Johnson & Johnson, and then BristolMyers Squibb Company, at which companies he was in charge of the development of a number of major pharmaceuticals used in the treatment of psychiatric, neurological, and pain disorders. In addition to his research activities, Dr. Grebb was a contributing editor for the Kaplan & Sadocks Comprehensive Textbook of Psychiatry, a leading textbook in the field. His extensive contributions centered on the areas of basic neuroscience and clinical psychopharmacology. Dr. Grebb also maintained his lifelong interest as a performer of classical organ music. Dr. Grebb started playing the organ when he was five years old, and held numerous church positions throughout his early training. Following his medical training, Dr. Grebb continued his music career by presenting benefit concerts in the US and Europe for a wide range of social and medical causes, including groups focused on the support of individuals and families with major mental illnesses. Dr. Grebb was born on April 8, 1953 in Worcester, MA. Dr. Grebb is survived by his life partner, George Merema, of Stony Creek, CT; his mother, Jean Grebb, of Arlington, VA, and his brother, Michael Grebb, of Arlington, VA. Dr. Grebb lived his life with integrity and passion and his generosity and kind heart were an inspiration to all who knew him.

2007-11-04T00:00:00Z,"Somewhere between the inevitable ''It's a Wonderful Life'' and the creepily campy ''Ernest Saves Christmas'' there is a perfect holiday movie for the whole family -- one that will keep both the smirk on your teenager's face and the tears flowing from your in-laws' eyes. That movie is Billy Wilder's 1960 masterpiece, ''The Apartment.'' Not a classic Christmas movie, you say? Look again. The action takes place primarily from Christmas Eve to New Year's Eve, with moments that sum up to perfection the Christmas spirit according to Wilder: the despicable Sheldrake (played with greedy zest by Fred MacMurray), handing his downtrodden mistress, Fran Kubelik (Shirley MacLaine), her present, a crisp $100 bill; the prolonged Christmas Eve-to-Christmas Day sequence, in which Buddy Baxter (Jack Lemmon, above) finds her, overdosed on sleeping pills, at his apartment and, with the help of his next-door neighbor, force-feeds her coffee and slaps her repeatedly to keep her from collapse; and, most memorably, Sheldrake on the phone in his White Plains house, his children playing with their new toys around the Christmas tree in the background as he heartlessly hears the news of his mistress's suicide attempt. When Fran finally dumps Sheldrake and races back to Buddy's apartment on New Year's Eve, she hears, just as she reaches the door, the loud retort of a suicide shot -- only to discover that the sound was Buddy, alone, popping open a magnum of Champagne."

2007-11-04T00:00:00Z,"Richard Lester's 1964 ''Hard Day's Night'' showed the Beatles, right, working eight days a week. In Mr. Lester's ''Help!,'' released a year later, John, Paul, George and Ringo try to take a holiday -- an enforced one, as they flee various baddies who covet a ceremonial ring that has become stuck on Ringo's finger -- and find escape is impossible. Absurd, delightful and exuberantly messy, ''Help!'' is pure pleasure to watch (especially now that, for the first time, it's available in a letterbox version). But there is also a great deal of sweet sadness around its edges. The Beatles' casual charm was part of what made them lovable. Two tweedy old ladies on the street catch sight of the boys and beam at them with affection: ''So natural! And still the same as they was before they was.'' But they aren't the same. One of the most enduring images of ''A Hard Day's Night'' was that of the Beatles being pursued by armies of screaming girls. In ''Help!'' a power-mad potentate (played by the silly and wonderful Leo McKern) hurls darts at their images, projected onto a screen; later they perform ''I Need You'' in a field while protected by army tanks. They're a pop group under siege. Even their hair had talismanic value. In one of the documentaries included in the extras here, the movie's hairdresser, Betty Glasow, recalls fielding requests from fans worldwide for locks of Beatle hair. She confesses that she still has a bit of John's, tucked away in a copy of his book ''A Spaniard in the Works.'' She tells us what he wrote inside: ''To Betty, with hair.''

After years of quietly offering works to collectors without success, sellers turn to the auction houses in the hope that wider exposure and a heady mood will bring strong prices. While Christie's catalog says that ''Le Jas de Bouffan'' is ''property from a distinguished collection,'' it is actually being sold by Seibu, a Japanese corporation, which acquired it at Sotheby's in 1990 for $7.1 million. For years Seibu has sought unsuccessfully to sell it privately. Similarly, the dealers Walter Feilchenfeldt (Zurich) and William Acquavella of New York have been quietly trying to sell van Gogh's ''Fields'' for months."

2007-11-04T00:00:00Z,"With a year to go until Election Day, the Republican and Democratic Parties are going through internal battles over their very identity, even as the races for their presidential nominations intensify. In many ways, the battles over how the parties will define themselves in the post-Bush era are nearly as significant a political fight as the presidential contest itself. The continued strength of Rudolph W. Giuliani, the former New York mayor who supports abortion rights and gay rights, is testing the question of whether social issues still drive Republican primary voters. Mr. Giuliani is talking about terrorism, cutting taxes, his record in managing New York City government -- but he has made no serious effort to shade his positions to appeal to the social conservatives who helped reshape the party over the past three decades and helped President Bush win the White House twice."

2007-11-04T00:00:00Z,"After writing some of the best screenplays Hollywood had ever heard (like ''Chinatown'' and ''Shampoo''), Robert Towne let the images do the talking when he made his directing debut with this 1982 film about women's track and field. Only Kon Ichikawa's epic documentary ''Tokyo Olympiad'' (1965) surpasses it for the sheer ability to put audiences in the bodies of athletes. Reversing the solemn, phony ''Chariots of Fire'' approach, Mr. Towne and the cinematographer Michael Chapman shoot the beginnings of scenes in slow motion, emphasizing what goes into the moments before a shot put, a pole vault, a race. The movie drinks in the Southern California light and air; after a while the amplified breathing on the soundtrack might feel like your own. And because the emphasis, as the title suggests, is on ''personal best,'' the movie stands in opposition to the world-beater ethos that, in the Reagan years, boomed out of Hollywood and Washington. ''Personal Best'' caused controversy because the movie explores its subject through the story of Chris (Mariel Hemingway, below right, with Jodi Anderson at center), a talented teenage athlete lacking in confidence, and Tory (the athlete Patrice Donnelly, above left) proving herself an instinctual, immensely likable actor), an experienced track-and-fielder who becomes Chris's mentor and lover. The gay press accused Mr. Towne of portraying lesbianism as a phase, which proved the blindness of viewing art through the lens of ideology. The love story is the natural response of two people trained to think with their bodies. To believe that Chris is ''cured'' of her orientation when she and Tory break up, you'd have to be foolish enough to believe that first love lasts, and you'd have to ignore the movie's final line. ''Personal Best'' is agog with wonder at the women before its camera, at the awesome capabilities of the human body and at the staggering variety of human potential. That wonder can't be dwarfed by anyone's insistence on what the norm should be. (Warner Brothers, Jan. 8, $19.97) CHARLES TAYLOR"

2007-11-04T00:00:00Z,"It may seem like a small thing -- a new well to give decent drinking water to 71 families in Raquette Lake, a small town north of Utica in the Adirondacks. But the town's request for permission to build the well on state parkland is the only constitutional issue that voters across New York will be asked to approve next Tuesday. New Yorkers should vote yes. And lovers of the Adirondacks should be extremely relieved that even this modest request, for a structure 10 feet wide and 12 feet long, needs statewide approval before it can be built in one of the pristine areas of the park. The reason for all this effort is that since the six-million-acre park was created in 1892, nearly three million acres of forest has been preserved as ''forever wild'' by the state Constitution. There is plenty of private land in the park, with 130,000 permanent residents, and there are enough lakes and mountains and trails and cabins to lure about 10 million visitors a year. But when the founders of the park put some sections off limits -- deeming it to be of such importance that almost nothing new should be built on it -- they clearly meant business."

2007-11-04T00:00:00Z,"At the time of its release Martin Scorsese's ''New York, New York'' (1977) came off as a failed experiment: Mr. Scorsese had wanted to make a highly stylized movie musical, complete with exuberant, candy-toned production numbers, about a couple whose relationship is not just frayed at the edges but on the verge of rotting through. Robert De Niro, left, is an ambitious swing-era musician who somehow plays with feeling, even though his face has the blank coldness of an empty staff. Liza Minnelli, left, is the singer who falls for him against her better judgment. (Ms. Minnelli's eager warmth, and the way her character approaches this jagged, damaging romance with the optimism of the doomed, make the performance deeply touching.) ''New York, New York'' befuddled and angered audiences at the time -- Weren't movie musicals supposed to be cheerful? And why is Mr. De Niro playing such a creep? -- although over the years adventurous moviegoers have warmed to its admittedly chilly charms. This 30th-anniversary edition -- the uncut version, more fully rounded than the one originally released in theaters -- offers the chance for another look at this strange, ambitious almost-masterpiece. Mr. Scorsese, the cinematographer Laszlo Kovacs and the production designer Boris Leven gave the movie a striking, retro-inventive look: A tense romantic confrontation takes place among a stand of poetically fake-looking trees that appear to be something out of ''Camelot.'' And although the movie is awkwardly paced, it digs fearlessly into dangerous, subterranean emotions. Its troubled characters know the real meaning of singin' in the rain.

The movie, which won the Palme d'Or at Cannes this year, is set on a single day in 1987 in Romania, two years before the violent end of the Ceausescu regime, which had outlawed both abortion and contraception. Otilia's best friend, Gabita, is pregnant and barely capable of facing the brute reality of her circumstances. It falls to Otilia to wheedle, bribe and contend with the grotesque demands of the leather-jacketed abortionist who creepily calls himself Mr. Bébé, and to provide what comfort she can to her hapless friend."

And there was some young 16- or 18-year-old kid flying it, so it was like, 'Wow, I guess these guys are professionals.' As we were climbing, I was just looking down on Boulder with all the lakes that are around it, and I'm thinking, 'I don't even know where I'm going to be landing.' At about 10,000 feet, I think, they open the door and you just fall out of the airplane. It was pretty exhilarating. You look up and the airplane keeps getting smaller and smaller, and you look down and the ground is getting closer and closer. It's crazy. I was screaming with excitement, giving a good war cry.''"

Marc Forster's adaptation of the 2003 best-selling novel by Khalid Hosseini is about the search for redemption by the adult Amir, years after betraying his boyhood companion. But in the lengthy flashback to the boys' friendship, Ahmad, above, is so quietly powerful that his Hassan ranks among the great child performances on film. As has been widely reported, the event that sets Amir's betrayal in motion is the attack on Hassan by a posse of older boys whose leader rapes him; although the depiction of the rape on screen is discreet, it is expected to be so offensive to conservative Afghan sensibilities that both young actors and their families are leaving Afghanistan and moving to the United Arab Emirates at the expense of Paramount Vantage."

2007-11-04T00:00:00Z,"The terrible and wonderful thing about Alan Parker's 1982 ''Shoot the Moon,'' in which Albert Finney and Diane Keaton play the two halves of a disintegrating couple, is how well it understands that mutual bitterness is still a connection. Memories of happiness may be stronger than happiness itself. No wonder those memories sometimes calcify into a kind of superglue between two people who were once in love. ''Shoot the Moon'' is a relic from a time when you could make a Hollywood movie about two adults and their problems. All of the drama comes from the dialogue (the script is by Bo Goldman, who wrote ''Melvin and Howard'' and adapted ''One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest'') and from the actors' faces. Mr. Finney, above with Dana Hill, left, and Tracey Gold, plays George, a stubborn, volatile writer who has worked hard over the years to support his wife, Faith (Ms. Keaton), and the couple's four daughters; he has also been having an affair with a somewhat younger woman, Sandy (Karen Allen, whose performance is terrific because of its unnerving crispness). Faith has looked after the children all these years and kept her husband going too. When, after a cool but vicious fight, George concedes it's time to move out of the house, Faith announces she has already packed his bag. The suggestion is that she can't break old habits, that she still needs to ensure he will have enough underwear, shirts and socks for his new life, even if it doesn't include her. ''Shoot the Moon'' never allows our sympathies to rest comfortably with one party or the other. Ms. Keaton's performance is a marvelous rendering of resolve and vulnerability at war with each other. But even if her character is the more aggrieved party, there is no way to write off the anguish on Mr. Finney's face when, after George tries to pay Faith a compliment, she shoots an insult straight into his heart by recalling some ancient transgression. ''You always remember the wrong things,'' he tells her, his voice (and his heart) numbed and flattened -- though the movie knows, as we do, that once a couple has reached the point of no return, remembering the right things is far more painful.

Not only is the dining room of Adour (scheduled to open in January in New York's St. Regis Hotel) surrounded by an open wine cellar, but there's also a state-of-the-art interactive tasting room that enables diners to project the details of a vintage onto their table. ''New Yorkers have become much more interested in pairing food and wine, and this is a totally unique approach,'' the chef says. 2. Two of his pet picks are the 2004 Fombrauge, ''an elegant and powerful white from St. Ãmilion, a terroir known mainly for its reds,'' and the 2003 Pape Clément, ''an absolute coup de coeur of mine.'' He would pair them both with his shellfish velouté, a mixture of clams, cuttlefish, squid and bread. ''This is a dish that completely sums up Adour,'' he notes. ''It can go with both a white and unexpectedly a red.'"

He was 74 years old. A graduate of Chaminade High School, Fordham University and Harvard Law School, he was a private investor with interests in real estate and equipment leases. In 1966, after practicing law for seven years, he pioneered the leveraged lease financing of railroad equipment and aircraft, which structure he later applied to public utility generating equipment, off-shore drilling equipment, oil tankers and other marine equipment. He was involved in the syndication of subsidized housing projects in New York, Florida and Massachusetts, and the financing of the initial rehabilitation of a block on West 42nd Street known as Theatre Row Phase II, which was sold in 2004 for further redevelopment. He was a lifelong fan of horseracing and co-owned several successful horses, including two Kentucky Derby winners and a Preakness winner. He was a co-founder and director of the National Thoroughbred Association, a trustee for the Thoroughbred Owners and Breeders Association, and a director of the Grayson-Jockey Club Research Foundation.

The Picasso head, depicting his mistress as a Greco-Roman goddess of sorts, was conceived in 1941 and cast in the 1950s in an edition of two. Insiders say it is considered one of his greatest sculptures and may well go far higher than its estimate. Experts are also buzzing about Matisse's richly patterned ''Odalisque.'' Abandoning the carefully delineated odalisques of the 1920s, he made a breakthrough in this painting to a spontaneous, simplified style.

2007-11-05T00:00:00Z,"9 P.M. (22, 26) CAROL BURNETT: A WOMAN OF CHARACTER Whether descending the staircase at Tara dressed in a curtain, with rod, or emitting one of her Tarzan yells, Ms. Burnett, above, made America laugh while also smashing stereotypes and showing that women could be at once feminine, empowered and funny. This “American Masters” documentary pays tribute to her life and career, using one of her signature devices: the audience question-and-answer session that opened her weekly show, which won 25 Emmys during its run from 1967 to 1978. This program includes clips of Ms. Burnett’s appearances on other television shows, in films and on the stage. It also features interviews with performers she inspired, including Tracey Ullman, Ellen DeGeneres, Kristin Chenoweth and Jenna Elfman. Alas, Ms. Burnett’s childhood wasn’t a laughing matter. But as her grandmother once told her, “Comedy is tragedy plus time.”."

2007-11-05T00:00:00Z,"FIDLER--Jay W., 85, a longtime resident of Rye Brook, died October 31, 2007 in White Plains of complications from a fall. A scholar-athlete at Brown University from 193943, Fidler was a first-team AllNew England tackle and Honorable Mention All-American who started for the North in the Christmas 1942 BlueGray game. He also lettered in baseball and was inducted into the university's Hall of Fame in 1992. As a trustee of Brown from 1969 to 1974, Fidler championed a first-ofits-kind relationship between Brown and Tougaloo College in Jackson, Mississippi. That program, which continues today, exemplifies his lifelong commitment to social justice. Active in the civil rights struggles of the 1960s, Fidler launched a Social Action Committee at Community Synagogue in Rye, worked with the Carver Center in Port Chester to expand the horizons of young kids at risk and with the Democratic Party to encourage black candidates to run for office in local and Westchester County races. Mr. Fidler was President and Chief Executive Officer of Hercules Chemical Company, manufacturer of a broad line of products for the plumbing and heating trade, until his retirement in 2000. The company's products, with creative brand names like ''Clobber,'' ''Wham,'' and ''Iron Ike,'' earned Hercules industry-wide recognition and the ''Top Brass'' Award from the American Supply Association in 1995. A Brooklyn native, Mr. Fidler is survived by his wife of 63 years, Rhoda Wander Fidler, whom he met at age 14 at James Madison High School. She shared his lifelong passion for social justice, which earned her the Westchester Ethical Culture Society's inaugural Ethics in Action Award, and induction in 2006 to the Westchester County Senior Citizen Hall of Fame. He is also survived by his brother Roy of San Rafael, California, three children, Josh of Baltimore, Maryland, Meg of New York City, and Shelley of Washington, D.C.; and five grandchildren, Alexandra, Drew, Aaron, Mica, and Jake.

The Trustees and staff of The Metropolitan Museum of Art mourn the passing of Brad Kelleher, who for the past 58 years has been a stalwart, inventive, inspirational, and brilliant member of the Museum's staff, pioneering and then cultivating to its broad level of success the field of museum merchandising. At a pivotal moment in 1950, as a young sales manager, he opened the Met's first art and book shop -little more than a rack of postcards at first -at the main information desk. Under his leadership the popularity of the publishing and reproduction business grew, soon to include not only books and other printed materials but jewelry and decorative objects based on works in the collection. Always innovative and also determined to bring art reproduction at a high level of excellence to a broad audience, he created and expanded areas including a reproduction studio, the mail-order catalogue, the carefully designed shops within the building, and satellite sales shops that are now located both around the U.S. and abroad. First as Publisher (1972-78) and then as Vice President and Publisher (1978-86), he extended the Museum's program of producing scholarly as well as general-interest publications about art. His fine work in these areas became a model for museums worldwide. As a consultant since 1986, he has continued to innovate and inspire, always open to exploring new techniques and technologies that might bring about broader exposure and enjoyment of the Metropolitan's encyclopedic and world-renowned collections. His colleagues throughout the art world will remember him with great respect and affection, for his skills as a businessman, his eye as a lover of art, his generosity and expertise as a manager, and his gentle and caring friendship. We will miss him greatly, and extend condolences to his wife Mary and the entire family. James R. Houghton, Chrmn. Philippe de Montebello, Dir. Emily K. Rafferty, President"

A scholarathlete at Brown University from 1939-43, Fidler was a first-team All-New England tackle and Honorable Mention All-American who started for the North in the Christmas 1942 Blue-Gray game. He also lettered in baseball and was inducted into the university's Hall of Fame in 1992. As a trustee of Brown from 1969 to 1974, Fidler championed a first-of-its-kind relationship between Brown and Tougaloo College in Jackson, Mississippi. That program, which continues today, exemplifies his lifelong commitment to social justice. Active in the civil rights struggles of the 1960s, Fidler launched a Social Action Committee at Community Synagogue in Rye, worked with the Carver Center in Port Chester to expand the horizons of young kids at risk and with the Democratic Party to encourage black candidates to run for office in local and Westchester County races. Mr. Fidler was President and Chief Executive Officer of Hercules Chemical Company, manufacturer of a broad line of products for the plumbing and heating trade, until his retirement in 2000. The company's products, with creative brand names like ''Clobber,'' ''Wham,'' and ''Iron Ike,'' earned Hercules industry-wide recognition and the ''Top Brass'' Award from the American Supply Association in 1995. A Brooklyn native, Mr. Fidler is survived by his wife of 63 years, Rhoda Wander Fidler, whom he met at age 14 at James Madison High School. She shared his lifelong passion for social justice, which earned her the Westchester Ethical Culture Society's inaugural Ethics in Action Award, and induction in 2006 to the Westchester County Senior Citizen Hall of Fame. He is also survived by his brother Roy of San Rafael, California, three children, Josh of Baltimore, Maryland, Meg of New York City, and Shelley of Washington, D.C.; and five grandchildren, Alexandra, Drew, Aaron, Mica, and Jake.

2007-11-06T00:00:00Z,"KAPLAN--Madge. Commissioner of Community Services and Political Activist, 73. Madge Kaplan was a tireless advocate for social justice. Growing up in the Bay Ridge Section of Brooklyn during the 40's she became part of the charged political atmosphere of the times. She would often be found cutting high school classes to attend political speeches in Columbus Circle. Kaplan marched for civil rights along side Martin Luther King and spearheaded political campaigns for social justice and human rights. She was the backbone of many political campaigns for progressive causes and was a mentor for young people entering the political arena. ''If there was a progressive cause or battle, Madge was there to help lead the charge,'' said State Comptroller Thomas DiNapoli, a long time neighbor and colleague. She served as a committee person for the Democratic Party and Democratic Zone leader. After she was Democratic Zone Leader, she was First Vice Chair of the Nassau Democratic County Committee and President of the Nassau Library System board of Trustee. During 1979 and 1980 she was President of the Reform Democratic Association. She is a founding member of the Working Families Party. As Commissioner of Community Services for the town of North Hempstead, Kaplan served with dedication and distinction since 2004. She spearheaded an effort to revitalized the department and developed a number of new programs addressing a wide range of social issues from gang violence, to the environment and senior care. The most recognized of the programs is ''Project Independence'', a revolutionary empowerment program that allow seniors to remain in their homes. Madge Kaplan was a resident of Great Neck, NY for the last 50 years. Her home was always opened to people who had fallen on hard times. Kaplan believed that everyone had a story to tell and everyone was of equal value. Her daughter says that in her home growing up businessmen and the homeless sat side by side at the dinner table each sharing their stories. She had a truly unique ability to see needs and gaps in services and to mobilize others to help meet those needs. A brilliant student, she graduated high school and went to the University of Colorado at age 15, where she completed a graduate degree in psychology. After graduating she worked for Barton's Chocolate as a consultant and helped in the re-organization plan for the New York Central Railroad. She went on to work as a management consultant for the Joynt Group. She than worked for the Communication Workers of America as a political consultant. She worked as coordinator for the Nassau Employment Initiative and Housing Program for FEGS Health and Human Services System in Hempstead. Kaplan, a founder and member of the Working Families Party, left a lasting impression on Jon Kaiman, Supervisor of North Hempstead. ''She had an extraordinary way about her'' he said. ''She never sacrificed substance and she always stood for her principles.'' Kaplan was a member of the NY Civil Liberties Union, Amnesty International NARAL and other organizations fighting for the preservation of civil liberties. She was voted Women of the Year by the Eleanor Roosevelt Chapter of the American Jewish Congress. She is a recipient of the Martin Luther King Political Empowerment Award by the Economic Opportunity Council of Nassau County, The Allard Lowenstein award from the American Jewish Congress and the Community Service Award from the Community Organization for Parents and Youth. Madge Kaplan's life-long devotion to social justice and human rights ended on October 31, when she died in her home after a long illness. She was 73. A Celebration of her life will be held on November 17 from 10:00 a.m. to 3:00 p.m. at Clinton G. Martin Park, 1601 Marcus Ave, New Hyde Park. In lieu of flowers, her family requests that donations be made to the Great Neck Student Aid Fund, Inc, at P.O. Box 1067, Great Neck, NY 11023.

Mr. Chapman was arrested in 2003 after seizing Andrew Luster, heir to the Max Factor cosmetics fortune, on a street in Puerto Vallarta to take him back to the United States to serve a 124-year jail sentence for drugging and raping three women. Mr. Luster was flown to California shortly after the capture and is now in jail."

2007-11-07T00:00:00Z,"GUMBS--Robert Darvin, 57, departed this life on Wednesday, October 31, 2007, after a brief illness. Robert graduated from Columbia University with a master's degree in public health. He also attended St. Francis College, where he obtained a Bachelor of Arts degree in psychology. He was a fellow of the New York Academy of Medicine and executive director of the Community Health Alliance of Harlem and Northern Manhattan. He was on the board of directors of the following organizations: One Hundred Black Men, the National Black Leadership Commission on AIDS, the National Association of Child Advocates and the Ebony Ecumenical Ensemble, and served on several other organizations. Robert, an activist, advocate and health care industry strategist, worked tirelessly to improve access to quality health care for all Americans. He began his professional career in health care in 1974. As a systems analyst and strategic planner, he quickly made his mark on the industry serving as an influential resource shaping public policy decisions. Robert designed and implemented innovative and inclusive strategies and published numerous reports that helped remove systemic barriers to quality health care services for underserved populations. In a career that spanned over thirty years, he was executive director of the New York City Health Systems Agency, senior vice president for network development at St. Barnabas Hospital and, ultimately, founder and president of Strategic Resources, Inc., a consulting firm serving health and human services organizations. An active member and elected lay leader at the Riverside Church in New York City, and motivated by his passion for justice, Bob was active in the HIV AIDS Global Ministry, the Social Justice Commission and the Budget and Planning and Public Health Committee, to name a few. On August 21, 1982, Robert married the former Gerri (Sandy) Bryant. The union was blessed with twenty-five years of marriage. Robert also leaves to cherish his memory: his mother, Mildred Morrison Gumbs; a twin brother, Richard Allen Gumbs; a sister, Charlene Coleman; a brother-in-law, Charles Coleman; and his beloved nieces, nephews, godchildren and friends. Viewing will be held on Wednesday from 8am to 9:45am at the Christ Chapel of Riverside Church, 490 Riverside Drive, New York, NY. A service will follow, from 10am to 12 noon. Interment is at the Ewing Cemetery, Trenton, New Jersey, at 3 pm. The Family of Robert Darvin Gumbs"

2007-11-07T00:00:00Z,"There is much more to a steer than steaks, regardless of whether the animal was fed corn, or raised on grass, or like wagyu cattle in Japan, massaged and served beer. The wagyu cattle raised here are also pampered, and cuts from them other than steaks also have a particular succulence. There's the brisket, for example. This cut has no finer destiny than pastrami or corned beef. When made with lavishly marbled wagyu, these cured meats acquire a delectable lushness. The pastrami, held by Juan Garcia, below, delivers a nice peppery, smoky edge; the silky corned beef's salt is modest."

2007-11-08T00:00:00Z,"Standard 41, a new furniture showroom in Red Hook, Brooklyn, is run by Andrew Raible, a designer and woodworker, above left, and his father, John, an architect. The pair work out of a loft at the 1860s Red Hook Stores warehouse overlooking Pier 41 (the origin of the showroom's name), where they sell chairs, tables, desks and other furniture made to order in materials like walnut, maple and cherry. The younger Raible, who was a partner in 3 Square Design, a furniture manufacturing company, and the Brooklyn shop Refinery, said that his work, like the Lounge Chair ($3,000), top right, is ''more square'' than his father's but that it has subtle details like beveled armrests that reveal the end grain. Since they started working together, he said, his father's furniture is ''getting cleaner'' and his is ''getting funkier.'' John Raible's pieces include, from left, Stork Table 1 ($3,400), Slap Happy ($3,400) and Walking Small ($1,600). For information or an appointment: (917) 805-0835 or standard41.com. LIZ ARNOLD"

Jamie began working for Centerplate at Yankee Stadium at the age of 15, becoming General Manager in 1986, Vice President of Operations in 1988, Regional Vice President in 2002 and Senior Vice President in 2006. He was a true master of our business and held two Yankees World Series rings, a testament to his contributions to the Yankee organization. He won Centerplate's GM of the Year Award in 1996 and the John Dee Award in 2004. All of us who were present in 2004 cheered mightily when his name was announced, for Jamie truly deserved to be the first recipient of this prestigious award. We will surely miss his deep understanding of his job, the tremendous mentoring he provided to so many of us on a daily basis and his ability to anticipate exactly what would make a difference in our lives. To his wife Debra, his mother Jean, his sister Nanci, his niece Lauren, and the rest of their family, our whole company shares in your loss. We will always miss his tremendous generosity and spirit but we will definitely carry it forward, inspired by who he was and what he achieved. With fondness from all of us at Centerplate. HERSKOWITZ--Jamie Mark, beloved husband, son, brother, uncle, friend and mentor to so many people, passed away on Tuesday, November 6 at the New York Presbyterian Columbia University Medical Center. Jamie is survived by his wife Debra, his mother Jean, his sister Nanci and his niece Lauren, whom he doted on and adored. Jamie leaves all of us with wonderful memories of joy and laughter and extraordinary generosity. Jamie spent his entire 41-year career with Centerplate, the food and merchandise provider at Yankee Stadium. He was born in Brooklyn, New York in 1951 and grew up in Queens as a Yankee fan. At 15, he obtained a job at Yankee Stadium which was a dream come true. He continued to work at the Stadium as he earned an Associates Degree in Hotel and Restaurant Management at New York Community College in 1973 and a B.S. in Food Service and Management from the Pratt Institute in 1977. Over the years Jamie worked for Centerplate as General Manager, Vice President of Operations, Regional Vice President and Senior Vice President, all at Yankee Stadium. He liked to tell people that at one time or another he had held every job that Centerplate offered at the Stadium. Jamie truly understood the hospitality business. One of his proudest moments was receiving a 1996 World Series ring from George Steinbrenner. This was a testament not only to his contributions to Centerplate and New York Yankees fans but also to the entire Yankee organization. Jamie was a generous mentor and longtime friend to many people. His pride in what he did, good heart and straightforward approach inspired all of those who knew him. He touched and changed so many lives for the better. Jamie left a distinct impression on everyone he met. Until his last day Jamie maintained the love and loyalty he felt for his family, his co-workers and his friends. We will all cherish and miss him.
