Bernard, beloved husband of Joyce Loewenthal West, adoring father of Jane West and Stacy West Clark, grandfather to Sara Lindsay Clark, Molly Addison Clark and Benjamin Luka Schmitt-West, passed away suddenly on Tuesday, July 28. He was a man of immeasurable generosity who doted on his family and friends with joy, love, birthday cards, gifts, visits and his time. Born in New York City to Lillian West and Milton West, Bernard was a brilliant thinker who adored reading books, watching classic movies from the 1930s and 1940s, skiing, golf and most of all his treasured NYC where he resided for over 50 years. A lover of all things NYC and Colorado and his wonderful house in Westchester, he loved and was a regular at the Ballet, NYC Philharmonic, Metropolitan Opera, the NYC theatre scene and events in Beaver Creek CO. He was a member of Quaker Ridge Golf Club, The University Club, The Harmonie Club, The Cornell Club and The Beaver Creek Club. One of his greatest loves was Cornell University from which he obtained his undergraduate (1955) and law degrees (1955) and volunteered for numerous alumni activities over the years. A second love was American History. He was a brainiac about the Civil War and World War II and his second calling was to be a history teacher. He was a Second Lieutenant in the United States Air Force and was deliriously happy whenever he was in a plane or flying one. Another of his loves was driving and he was darn great at it at 83! He grew up in Rockville Centre, NY and graduated from Cheshire Academy in 1949. In his professional life, he practiced real estate law for a number of years before joining his brother William in running Charles H. Greenthal and Co. -- a leading NYC real estate management firm. Once retired, he volunteered at Lenox Hill Hospital, read to the blind and doted on his wife of 59 years who he adored beyond words and was his absolute soulmate. A life-long Mets fan, he was a wonderful husband, father, grandfather, brother, son and friend. He is also survived by his mother Lillian West and adored brother William West, and precious step- grandchildren Anna and JT Schmitt and many loved nieces and nephews. We love you dad and will treasure your memory forever. Family will receive friends at Frank Campbell Funeral Chapel, 1076 Madison Avenue (81st Street) on Thursday, July 30, 6-8pm.

She was happiest as loving wife to Charles, mother to Barbara and Jan, grandmother to Lee, Ashley, and Christopher, and great-grand- mother to Jack and Beatrice.

2015-08-02T00:00:00Z,"GOLDSTEIN--Charles A. Our partners, attorneys and staff mourn the loss of our dear friend, colleague and mentor, Charles A Goldstein, who with great distinction has served as a Senior Counsel to our firm for over 14 years. It is rare for any attorney to become a legend in his chosen field of practice, but during his long and exemplary career, Charles achieved this distinction in two entirely unrelated areas of the law. After graduating from Harvard Law School in 1961 with distinction, Charles clerked on the Second Circuit Court of Appeals and then entered private practice specializing in real estate law. Charles quickly established himself as a leader of the New York City real estate bar, guiding the development of the most significant real estate projects in New York City from the 60's through the 90's, and at the same time training and mentoring legions of attorneys in that specialty. Charles' intellectual acumen and business savvy were unmatched, and clients and colleagues alike marveled at his ability to grasp and resolve the most complex challenges. When he decided to change careers, he left the real estate practice at the top of his game. When others might have considered retiring after such a career, Charles instead embarked on a whole new career after being asked by Ronald Lauder to develop and lead the newly formed Commission for Art Recovery devoted to recovering Nazi-looted art for families victimized by the Holocaust. Being the intellectual powerhouse that he was, Charles quickly became an expert in this new area of art law and before long became one of its leading practitioners, lecturing and writing extensively on the subject. He was remarkably successful in recovering stolen artworks and other cultural property, despite many obstacles including strenuous opposition from formidable adversaries. An articulate spokesman for the right of Holocaust victims and their families to reclaim their property from governments, museums and others who had acquired it in the years following World War II, Charles literally rewrote history, and earned the great distinction of helping to right horrific wrongs visited upon Jewish families and others during the Holocaust. The attorneys and staff of our firm express their sincere gratitude for having had the opportunity to work closely with a man whose profound erudition, keen intellect, creativity, command of language and powers of persuasion inspired us all to greater achievements. We extend our condolences and heartfelt sympathy to his beloved daughter Deborah, son Graham, their spouses and his grandchildren. Charles will be sorely missed by us all. HERRICK, FEINSTEIN LLP 1/3"

'Ev or Evie' as her dear family and friends called her, celebrated her 95th birthday on June 7th of this year after celebrating the birth of her second great granddaughter on June 5th. Ev was born to George and Elizabeth Rapp in Elizabeth, New Jersey and grew up in Wayne along with her brothers, Chris and Bill, and sister Betty. Bill currently lives in Texas. She attended the Mountain View Grammar School and Pompton Lakes High School. After completing her training as registered nurse at Paterson General Hospital, she served during World War II, attending to returning troops. After the war she worked in the New Jersey offices of Dr. Forrest Chilton. She ultimately earned a BS in nursing. All three of her children, Andy, Doug and Laurie, were delivered by doctor Chilton at Paterson General. Ev married her high school sweetheart, Andrew Senchak on September 21st, 1941. After the war they lived in Wayne, New Jersey, Northridge, California, and Evanston, Illinois. They lived in Ocean Grove, New Jersey from 1980 until 2011. They were together for 69 years. Their marriage was marked by considerable overseas travel. Most notable was their stay in Paris where Ev studied at the Sorbonne and worked at the bookstore Shakespeare and Co. It was there that her lifelong passion for reading became partially satisfied. Evie was regarded as a gifted nurse with impressive intuition. This sensibility was also manifested in her deep, loving care for her family, friends and all members of the animal kingdom. It also found its way into her cooking, painting and writing. Her soups and salads nourished generations of neighborhood children in Wayne, Surf City, Northridge and Ocean Grove. She published a short story in the Saturday Evening Post and recently divulged her pen name after much pressure from her children. A Celebration of Life Gathering will be held from 2:30 to 3:30pm on August 25, 2015 at Attic Angel Place, 8301 Old Sauk Road, Middleton (second floor dining room).

2015-08-02T00:00:00Z,"STATON--Albert H.,Jr. Albert H. Staton, Jr. died peacefully Wednesday, July 29th at home in Coral Gables, FL, age 94. He had recently celebrated 72 years of marriage to his beloved wife and life partner, Mary Jane Staton (nee Wilson). Born April 1, 1921 in Atlanta, GA, Albert was a successful international businessman who spent much of his working life in Latin America. A brilliant student, he passed the admission exam at Georgia Tech at the age of 15 but was told to wait a year because of his youth. After earning a BS in Chemical Engineering from Georgia Tech in 1941, Albert served in the US Army for four years, first in chemical munitions and later as an intelligence officer with the 77th Infantry Division in the Pacific. He was promoted to the rank of captain on Okinawa, where he received the Bronze Star. In 1951, Albert moved with his family to Colombia to work for Panamerican Investment Company (Panamco) a pioneering softdrink company founded by his father. During his many years with Panamco in Colombia, Mexico and Brazil, Albert was instrumental in building it into one of the largest and best-run Coca-Cola bottling companies outside the US. One of his proudest achievements was the construction of an immense bottling plant in Jundiai, Brazil, that was at the time large enough to supply the entire city of Sao Paolo. Panamco became a public company in 1998 and was acquired by Coca-Cola FEMSA five years later. Albert will be remembered for his optimism, his wit, his multilingualism and his ability to think outside the box. He loved to tell tales of derring-do about his extraordinarily adventurous life. He was passionately interested in world affairs and up to the time of his death perused several newspapers every morning, including The New York Times and the Financial Times. He was also a devoted husband, father, grandfather, great-grandfather and friend. He is survived by his wife Mary Jane, also of Atlanta; his son Albert III and daughter Jane; seven grandchildren and three great- grandchildren. His beloved son Stuart died in 2013. 1/3"

2015-08-03T00:00:00Z,"KAELIN--Carolyn Mary. Carolyn Mary Kaelin, MD, MPH, FACS, of Boston, MA died surrounded by loved ones on July 28, 2015. Beloved wife of William G. Kaelin, Jr., MD, Howard Hughes Medical Institute Investigator at Dana-Farber Cancer Institute and Harvard Medical School Professor, and loving mother to Kathryn Grace and William (Tripp). She was 54 years old. A technically gifted and compassionate breast cancer surgeon at the Dana- Farber Cancer Institute and Brigham and Women's Hospital in Boston, Carolyn graduated from Smith College and Johns Hopkins School of Medicine. She earned her master's degree from Harvard School of Public Health. At 34, she became the Founding Director of the Comprehensive Breast Health Center at Brigham and Women's Hospital, then the youngest woman singled out for a job of this caliber at a major Harvard teaching hospital. She quickly established herself as one of the nation's premier breast cancer surgeons. Also active in research, Carolyn focused on how doctors and patients make medical decisions and on quality of life issues for breast cancer survivors, particularly the role of exercise. In 2001, Newsweek featured her as one of 15 Women of the New Century. An avid athlete, Carolyn rode repeatedly in the Pan-Mass Challenge, a 192-mile bicycle ride fundraiser for the Dana- Farber Cancer Institute. Shortly after a training ride in 2003, she noticed early signs of her own breast cancer. After several attempts at breast conservation surgery failed, she had a mastectomy. Nonetheless, while still recovering from surgery, Carolyn rode the PMC with team WOW (Women Oncologists on Wheels). Sadly, a rare complication of breast cancer therapy prevented Carolyn from returning to the clinical practice and patients she so loved. She instead redoubled her patient education and survivorship efforts, with a particular emphasis on the underserved, all while being a devoted mother to her two children. Through many actions, Carolyn vastly improved the lives of women facing breast cancer. A pathfinder with vision and the steel to see it through, she initiated research on the value of rowing in patients with postoperative lymphedema with an assist from Olympian Holly Metcalf, the founder of We Can Row, co-authored two award-winning books, Living Through Breast Cancer and The Breast Cancer Survivor's Fitness Plan, and helped create an innovative, exercise-centered breast cancer recovery program for the YMCA. Intent on using her experiences to help others, she established the Quality of Life Fund at Brigham and Women's Hospital to support breast cancer survivorship projects and launched the successful Knowledge, Strength, and Grace conference series for breast cancer patients and their families. In Aspen, Colorado, Carolyn's adopted second home where she loved to bicycle and hike, she cofounded the Quality of Life Cancer Fund with her dear friend Barbara Berger. Under the stewardship of the Berger family, this fund raises over $100,000 each year to support indigent cancer patients living in Colorado's Roaring Fork Valley. Both a beacon and a powerhouse, Carolyn was empathetic, upbeat, deeply kind, intelligent, and gracious. She received numerous honors, including an Exceptional Women Award from Candy O'Terry and WMJX as well as the Mary Horrigan Connors Award at Brigham and Women's Hospital recognizing her outstanding commitment to women's health. In 2010, Carolyn was diagnosed with brain cancer unrelated to her previous breast cancer. In the course of her treatments, she had two brain surgeries, each requiring extensive rehabilitation so that she could relearn to walk, and she was a trailblazer on several clinical trials testing new medical treatments for brain cancer. Always indomitable, she faced innumerable challenges, yet rose to each one, roaring back from setbacks to spend increasingly precious time with close friends and her family, who meant the world to her. Carolyn is survived by her husband and children, parents Mary and Richard Scerbo of Boston, brother Richard Scerbo of Boston and his wife Ellen Scerbo, and many loving aunts, uncles, nephews, nieces, cousins, and in-laws. A memorial service will be held at St. Ignatius Church in Chestnut Hill, MA on Friday, August 28th at 4pm. Guests are welcome to wear a touch of pink. In lieu of flowers, the family asks that gifts be made to Spaulding Rehabilitation Hospital in Boston or to Dana Farber Cancer Institute to support brain tumor research under the supervision of Dr. Patrick Wen.

2015-08-03T00:00:00Z,"STATON--Albert H.,Jr. Albert H. Staton, Jr. died peacefully Wednesday, July 29th at home in Coral Gables, FL, age 94. He had recently celebrated 72 years of marriage to his beloved wife and life partner, Mary Jane Staton (nee Wilson). Born April 1, 1921 in Atlanta, GA, Albert was a successful international businessman who spent much of his working life in Latin America. A brilliant student, he passed the admission exam at Georgia Tech at the age of 15 but was told to wait a year because of his youth. After earning a BS in Chemical Engineering from Georgia Tech in 1941, Albert served in the US Army for four years, first in chemical munitions and later as an intelligence officer with the 77th Infantry Division in the Pacific. He was promoted to the rank of captain on Okinawa, where he received the Bronze Star. In 1951, Albert moved with his family to Colombia to work for Panamerican Investment Company (Panamco) a pioneering softdrink company founded by his father. During his many years with Panamco in Colombia, Mexico and Brazil, Albert was instrumental in building it into one of the largest and best-run Coca-Cola bottling companies outside the US. One of his proudest achievements was the construction of an immense bottling plant in Jundiai, Brazil, that was at the time large enough to supply the entire city of Sao Paolo. Panamco became a public company in 1998 and was acquired by Coca-Cola FEMSA five years later. Albert will be remembered for his optimism, his wit, his multilingualism and his ability to think outside the box. He loved to tell tales of derring-do about his extraordinarily adventurous life. He was passionately interested in world affairs and up to the time of his death perused several newspapers every morning, including The New York Times and the Financial Times. He was also a devoted husband, father, grandfather, great-grandfather and friend.

2015-08-04T00:00:00Z,"JONES--Howard W.,Jr., MD. We honor the life of Howard W. Jones, Jr., MD, 104, a pioneering medical visionary, dedicated mentor, internationally renowned gynecological surgeon, and the father of in vitro fertilization in the United States. Dr. Jones, along with his wife Dr. Georgeanna Seegar Jones, helped create America's first ""test-tube"" baby in 1981, transforming reproductive medical science and propelling the field from a dream to reality. Their innovations have enabled nearly 6 million births worldwide through in vitro fertilization. Dr. Jones served on the Board and was Honorary Chairman of the Board of the Jones Foundation for Reproductive Medicine until the time of his death. The Foundation funds groundbreaking research and the fellows and doctors trained at the Foundation share their knowledge around the world to serve mankind. Dr. Jones's keen mind, up until the end of his life, astonished his colleagues, friends and family. He continued to stay abreast of reproductive endocrinology, attend lectures and conferences, and ask probing questions during medical meetings. ""One more question,"" he would proclaim in his deep voice. ""Ageless, he never aged,"" said Dr. Alan DeCherney, director of the Program in Reproductive and Adult Endocrinology at the National Institute of Child Health and Human Development. Dr. Jones was born on December 30, 1910 in Baltimore, Maryland. It was a remarkable coincidence that he was delivered, at home, by his future father-in-law, Dr. King Seegar. His father was a physician and they went on house calls together in a horse and buggy. When Dr. Jones was 13, his father died and his aunt helped raise him. Dr. Jones attended the Friends School in Baltimore and Amherst College, where his professor of English was Robert Frost. Dr. Jones graduated from Amherst cum laude in 1931. Dr. Jones loved to recount how he fell in love with Georgeanna Seegar on February 29th, 1932 at a medical lecture. She later said that the evening changed her life. He assumed it was because it was the night she fell in love with him, too; she insisted it was because he inspired her to apply to medical school and become an endocrinologist. They were rarely apart, sharing one desk and one car. Dr. Jones served in WWII as the chief of a mobile surgical team in the United States Corp Fifth Auxiliary Surgical Group with General George S. Patton. When Dr. Jones was 94, he published a collection of love letters he and his wife wrote each day during the war. Dr. Georgeanna Seegar Jones died in 2005. In the 1950s, Dr. Jones collaborated on landmark cervical cancer studies and became the recognized expert at Johns Hopkins for genital abnormalities and reconstructions. In 1965, he, and his wife, who was the director of the Division of Reproductive Endocrinology at Johns Hopkins, and Dr. Robert Edwards, collaborated in the lab and succeeded at the first steps of in vitro fertilization. After mandatory retirement from Johns Hopkins, a former classmate, Dr. Mason Andrews, recruited Drs. Howard and Georgeanna Jones to the Eastern Virginia Medical School. They continued working on in vitro fertilization and had 41 failures before their first success, when Judith Carr gave birth to Elizabeth Carr on December 28, 1981, two days before Dr. Jones's 71st birthday. Over the years, Dr. Jones welcomed former patients who came with their toddlers to celebrate Mother's Day and baby photos adorned his office. Dr. Jones served with great distinction as Professor Emeritus of Obstetrics and Gynecology at Eastern Virginia Medical School. He was also Professor Emeritus at Johns Hopkins where he served as Professor of Gynecology and Obstetrics, acting Chairman of the Department, and Secretary General of the University Program for International Education. Dr. Jones received honorary degrees from the University of Cordoba, Old Dominion University, Amherst College, the University of Madrid, and Eastern Virginia Medical School. He is the recipient of the Medal of the College of France and the Distinguished Service Award of the American College of Obstetrics and Gynecology. He launched the first ethics committee dealing with fertility as part of the American Society for Reproductive Medicine. At the age of 103, he wrote In Vitro Fertilization Comes to America: Memoir of a Medical Breakthrough, retelling his amazing career. A year earlier, he published Personhood Revisited: Reproductive Technology, Bioethics, Religion and the Law, an exploration into the legal and ethical implications of fertility treatments and a perspective on pending legislation seeking to define the union of a sperm and egg as a person. Dr. Jones published a dozen books and hundreds of scientific journal articles. Dr. Jones is survived by three children, seven grandchildren and fourteen great-grandchildren. His son, Howard W. Jones III, MD, is Chairman of the Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology at Vanderbilt University School of Medicine. A daughter, Georgeanna Jones Klingensmith, MD, is the Past Director of Pediatric Diabetes at the Barbara Davis Diabetes Center at the University of Colorado, and his son Lawrence Massey Jones is a Denver-based financial advisor. At a 100th birthday celebration Dr. Jones quoted his professor at Amherst in describing himself: ""Two Roads diverged in a wood, and I -- I took the one less traveled by, And that has made all the difference.""-- Robert Frost. The Board and staff of the Jones Foundation for Reproductive Medicine, millions of parents and children, and those who had the good fortune to be touched by his innovative genius and kind spirit honor the man who took the road less traveled.

He spent the day before his death with his beloved wife of 47 years, Laurie Burrows Grad, enjoying golf, dinner and a concert under the stars with longtime college friends. Grad, who lived in Los Angeles, served as President of the successful MTM Studios. He began his career at Paramount Television before moving to 20th Century Fox Television where he became a senior development executive. After retiring from the entertainment business, Grad found a new creative passion: raising awareness and support for the Alzheimer's Association. As a tribute to his late father-in-law, celebrated playwright-director Abe Burrows, Peter and Laurie co-founded and co-chaired the annual A Night at Sardi's fundraiser, which recognizes researchers, caregivers and families affected by the neurological disease. The event has generated $27 million in donations over 23 years. Peter Newfield Grad was born March 22, 1940 in Newark, NJ to parents Marian Newfield Grad and Bernard Grad. Raised on the Jersey shore, he attended the George School, a prestigious prep academy in Bucks County, Pa., where he emerged as an accomplished athlete, an exemplary prefect and a talented actor. During his college years at University of Pennsylvania, Peter made friends he would keep for the rest of his life. He tried his hand at many vocations including engineering, finance, acting and producing before he found his true calling as a television executive. In addition to his wife, Grad's survivors include his cherished son and daughter-in-law, Nicholas Grad and Carolyn Bernstein; and the source of his abundant joy, grandchildren Lucas and Georgia, who treasured the man they called ""Duke."" He is also survived by a loving sister, Susan Grad Baerwald, and her husband Paul, who was Peter's oldest friend, and their children, along with his brother-in-law, accomplished director James Burrows, and his family. Grad's humor, his abundant love of people and his essential goodness will endure as sweet memories for his family and the multitude of friends who always surrounded him. He will never be forgotten. A memorial celebration will take place in mid- August. Contributions in Peter's memory may be made to the Alzheimer's Association's annual A Night At Sardi's fundraiser. 1/3"

2015-08-04T00:00:00Z,"STERN--Milton, died tragically in an automobile accident near his weekend home in Bridgewater, CT on Sunday, August 2nd. His stopped car was struck broadside on the driver's side by an oncoming vehicle. He was 79. Milt was the cherished companion and beloved husband of 36 years to Rosalie J. Wolf, loving father to Carol Moriel, and David and Peggy Stern, beloved step-father to Dina Pruzansky and Mike Herman, and adored ""Popop"" to Michael Moriel, Daniella Herman, and Ellery Herman. Milton and his grandson Michael shared a particularly special relationship, and Popop was immeasurably proud and adoring of Michael. Born and raised in Brooklyn, the only child of immigrants Jack and Ethel Stern, Milton graduated from Stuyvesant High School, and City College, where he studied chemical engineering. He later earned an MS in chemical engineering and an MBA. After holding executive positions for many years at several oil companies and financial firms, Milton co-founded Bridgewater Advisors, an investment advisory firm based in New York City, with his dear friend, Leo Marzen, in 1992. Milton and Leo, together with their team of outstanding colleagues, have successfully grown the firm into an organization serving hundreds of clients. It is known to be a place of great integrity and client focus. For Milton, it was 'always about the client' in everything he did. He worked tirelessly, yet he loved his work in a way few ever do. He was also endlessly proud of the accomplishments of his partners and colleagues at his firm. Milton loved to travel the world with his wife, and the two travelled internationally for pleasure several times each year, sometimes comfortably and sometimes less so. He was a proud feminist, and an extraordinary supporter of his wife's career. He was also a great fan of classical music, ballet, and good red wine. The family is gathering privately this week. A memorial service will be held at a future date. Donations in his honor may be made to Urban Pathways. 1/3"

2015-08-05T00:00:00Z,"CURRAN--John P. Fordham University mourns the death of John P. Curran, PhD, School of Pharmacy 1966. Curran, the benefactor of the Francis and Ann Curran Center for American Catholic Studies, died on August 1 at the age of 72. ""John Curran was one of my heroes,"" said Joseph M. McShane, SJ, president of Fordham. ""He was one of the most exemplary of Fordham's graduates: brilliant, kind, witty, intellectually curious, generous and filled with faith. It is no wonder, therefore, that he touched and inspired all who met him. My heart goes out to his family today. I know the Fordham family joins me in keeping John and his loved ones in our prayers."" Curran and his wife, Constance, endowed the center in 2004, when it was just a ""phone and a desk on the third floor of Keating Hall,"" said the center's founder, Mark S. Massa, SJ, the former Karl Rahner Chair in Theology. Born and raised in the Bronx, John Curran graduated from Fordham's School of Pharmacy in 1966 and received a doctorate in pharmaceutical economics from the University of Pittsburgh in 1971. His longtime career in pharmaceuticals included work in public policy research with Pfizer, Inc. and in drug analysis with G.A. Saxton, Wood Gundy, Inc., Dean Witter Reynolds, and L.F. Rothschild. He began his own hedge fund, Curran Capital Management, in 1987, from which he retired in 2002. Father Massa had established a center for Catholic study at Fordham in 2001, which opened one week after the tragedies of September 11. It remained a small program until the Currans, inspired by their close friendship with Father Massa, became its benefactors and named it in honor of John Curran's parents. In May, the Currans were awarded with Fordham's highest honor, the Presidential Medal, which has only been given 30 times in the history of the University. Since then, the Currans have been much more than benefactors and patrons to the Curran Center, said current director Christine Firer Hinze, PhD. The center, which celebrated its 10th anniversary in May, has grown to become a premier hub of Catholic studies. It offers numerous lectures and public conferences that explore diverse topics in Catholicism, including Catholic education, Catholic literature, black Catholic culture, and Latino/a spirituality. In addition to his wife of 47 years, Curran leaves a daughter, Meredith Rauhut; son Sean Curran; grandchildren Gavin and Kaelyn Rauhut; sister, Ann Mullan; and ten nieces and nephews. 1/3"

2015-08-05T00:00:00Z,"SENCHAK--Evelyn. Evelyn Margaret Senchak, of Madison, passed away on Friday afternoon, July 17th, at Attic Angel Place in Middleton, Wisconsin. 'Ev or Evie' as her dear family and friends called her, celebrated her 95th birthday on June 7th of this year after celebrating the birth of her second great granddaughter on June 5th. Ev was born to George and Elizabeth Rapp in Elizabeth, New Jersey and grew up in Wayne along with her brothers, Chris and Bill, and sister Betty. Bill currently lives in Texas. She attended the Mountain View Grammar School and Pompton Lakes High School. After completing her training as registered nurse at Paterson General Hospital, she served during World War II, attending to returning troops. After the war she worked in the New Jersey offices of Dr. Forrest Chilton. She ultimately earned a BS in nursing. All three of her children, Andy, Doug and Laurie, were delivered by doctor Chilton at Paterson General. Ev married her high school sweetheart, Andrew Senchak on September 21st, 1941. After the war they lived in Wayne, New Jersey, Northridge, California, and Evanston, Illinois. They lived in Ocean Grove, New Jersey from 1980 until 2011. They were together for 69 years. Their marriage was marked by considerable overseas travel. Most notable was their stay in Paris where Ev studied at the Sorbonne and worked at the bookstore Shakespeare and Co. It was there that her lifelong passion for reading became partially satisfied. Evie was regarded as a gifted nurse with impressive intuition. This sensibility was also manifested in her deep, loving care for her family, friends and all members of the animal kingdom. It also found its way into her cooking, painting and writing. Her soups and salads nourished generations of neighborhood children in Wayne, Surf City, Northridge and Ocean Grove. She published a short story in the Saturday Evening Post and recently divulged her pen name after much pressure from her children. A Celebration of Life Gathering will be held from 2:30 to 3:30pm on August 25, 2015 at Attic Angel Place, 8301 Old Sauk Road, Middleton (second floor dining room). A service in Ocean Grove, New Jersey will be in September. A selection of Evie's paintings will be on display at these gatherings. Evie is survived by her brother Bill, her three children, six grandchildren, Phoebe and Christoper Banks, Alexander Case Senchak, Max Hunter Senchak, Simone Kaplan Senchak and Adrienne McKay Ranney and two great grandchildren, Ella and Nina Frankenburg. She was a cherished mother and will always be loved by Andy, Doug and Laurie.

Born to Charles and Jean DiMassino, in Harlem, NY on August 5, 1932. Beloved wife of William ""Red."" Devoted mother of William (and wife Laura) and the late John (and wife Jacqui). Loving sister of the late John DiMassino (and wife, the late Nancy). Cherished grandmother of Nicholas and Thomas, cherished aunt to John and Therese. She was tough but loving, hardworking and honest. Her journey saw her moving from Harlem, to Brooklyn, then Queens, and finally home ownership in Long Island, in a place called Malverne. Here is where she raised her boys, worked at the local school as a teacher's aide, and not long after moved into retail sales and design at a home furnishings store, The Maple Center. She was also very proud of the work she did in her younger years, as a trained dental assistant. Amy was also known as the other half of the partnership with husband Red in the well know record auction dealership ""The Jazz Hunter."" It was their love for Jazz and collecting records that really defined who Amy and Red were. They hosted jam sessions at the house, went to all the clubs, and knew many of the musicians. This passion turned into a business which included a record auction having customers throughout North America, as well as in the U.K., Europe, India and Japan. Amy also spent years rescuing homeless dogs and cats . . . lots of cats, all the while feeding every bird in the neighborhood, or so it seemed. Her days were cut short, but she is joining dad and John, so she is in good hands. That said, I already miss her dearly. Hold all those you care for close. Bill Carraro.

Founder and former President of Starline Optical Corporation, which introduced Safilo eyewear in the United States, died at his home in New York City on August 5 at the age of 83. The cause was complications from Parkinson's disease and Aphasia. His success in business was matched only by his love for, and devotion to his family. George was born in Budapest, Hungary in 1931. After his many years as President of Starline, he served on the Board and became Chairman of Eastern Europe for the Joint Distribution Committee (JDC), an organization that was particularly meaningful for him. In 1949, after surviving the Holocaust and World War II in Budapest, George escaped from communist Hungary to Austria, where he lived in a Displaced Persons Camp run by the JDC for three years. In 1954 he immigrated to the United States, where he served in the United States Army at Camp Kilmer as an interpreter for Hungarian refugees. George, and his wife Martha, who predeceased him, were active in many Jewish charities, including as founding members and benefactors of the Education Division of the Museum of Jewish Heritage - A Living Memorial to the Holocaust in New York City, Metro-West of New Jersey and Eternal Flame of New Jersey. George was instrumental in the erection of a Raoul Wallenberg statue in Parsippany, New Jersey. He credited Wallenberg with saving the lives of thousands of Hungarian Jews, including his own, in the last hours of the liquidation of the Budapest ghetto. Despite the fact that his formal education was interrupted by the war, he was a self-educated man who read widely on history, politics and current events and was always interested in engaging his friends in lively political debate. As a young man he studied classical piano, which left him with a life- long love of classical music and jazz. He was a fixture at Dizzy's Club Coca-Cola in Manhattan. He loved the United States and the freedom it gave him to be a loving father, a successful businessman, a valued member of the Jewish community and, as he would say, an all around ""mensch."" His values of integrity and hard work made him a mentor for his many colleagues. He is survived by his four children: Michael, Diane, Monica and Irina, their spouses Kathleen, Robert and Rod; his six grandchildren, Jason and his wife Rachel, Danielle and her husband Seth, Daniel, Laura, Marc and Julia, and his great grandson, Jake. Donations in George's memory may be made to Eternal Flame, www.eternalflame.org Services Friday 11:15am at ""The Riverside"" 76th Street and Amsterdam Avenue. 1/3"

2015-08-09T00:00:00Z,"JONES--Howard W.,Jr., MD. We honor the life of Howard W. Jones, Jr., MD, 104, a pioneering medical visionary, dedicated mentor, internationally renowned gynecological surgeon, and the father of in vitro fertilization in the United States. Dr. Jones, along with his wife Dr. Georgeanna Seegar Jones, helped create America's first ""test-tube"" baby in 1981, transforming reproductive medical science and propelling the field from a dream to reality. Their innovations have enabled nearly 6 million births worldwide through in vitro fertilization. Dr. Jones served on the Board and was Honorary Chairman of the Board of the Jones Foundation for Reproductive Medicine until the time of his death. The Foundation funds groundbreaking research and the fellows and doctors trained at the Foundation share their knowledge around the world to serve mankind. Dr. Jones's keen mind, up until the end of his life, astonished his colleagues, friends and family. He continued to stay abreast of reproductive endocrinology, attend lectures and conferences, and ask probing questions during medical meetings. ""One more question,"" he would proclaim in his deep voice. ""Ageless, he never aged,"" said Dr. Alan DeCherney, director of the Program in Reproductive and Adult Endocrinology at the National Institute of Child Health and Human Development. Dr. Jones was born on December 30, 1910 in Baltimore, Maryland. It was a remarkable coincidence that he was delivered, at home, by his future father-in-law, Dr. King Seegar. His father was a physician and they went on house calls together in a horse and buggy. When Dr. Jones was 13, his father died and his aunt helped raise him. Dr. Jones attended the Friends School in Baltimore and Amherst College, where his professor of English was Robert Frost. Dr. Jones graduated from Amherst cum laude in 1931. Dr. Jones loved to recount how he fell in love with Georgeanna Seegar on February 29th, 1932 at a medical lecture. She later said that the evening changed her life. He assumed it was because it was the night she fell in love with him, too; she insisted it was because he inspired her to apply to medical school and become an endocrinologist. They were rarely apart, sharing one desk and one car. Dr. Jones served in WWII as the chief of a mobile surgical team in the United States Corp Fifth Auxiliary Surgical Group with General George S. Patton. When Dr. Jones was 94, he published a collection of love letters he and his wife wrote each day during the war. Dr. Georgeanna Seegar Jones died in 2005. In the 1950s, Dr. Jones collaborated on landmark cervical cancer studies and became the recognized expert at Johns Hopkins for genital abnormalities and reconstructions. In 1965, he, and his wife, who was the director of the Division of Reproductive Endocrinology at Johns Hopkins, and Dr. Robert Edwards, collaborated in the lab and succeeded at the first steps of in vitro fertilization. After mandatory retirement from Johns Hopkins, a former classmate, Dr. Mason Andrews, recruited Drs. Howard and Georgeanna Jones to the Eastern Virginia Medical School. They continued working on in vitro fertilization and had 41 failures before their first success, when Judith Carr gave birth to Elizabeth Carr on December 28, 1981, two days before Dr. Jones's 71st birthday. Over the years, Dr. Jones welcomed former patients who came with their toddlers to celebrate Mother's Day and baby photos adorned his office. Dr. Jones served with great distinction as Professor Emeritus of Obstetrics and Gynecology at Eastern Virginia Medical School. He was also Professor Emeritus at Johns Hopkins where he served as Professor of Gynecology and Obstetrics, acting Chairman of the Department, and Secretary General of the University Program for International Education. Dr. Jones received honorary degrees from the University of Cordoba, Old Dominion University, Amherst College, the University of Madrid, and Eastern Virginia Medical School. He is the recipient of the Medal of the College of France and the Distinguished Service Award of the American College of Obstetrics and Gynecology. He launched the first ethics committee dealing with fertility as part of the American Society for Reproductive Medicine. At the age of 103, he wrote In Vitro Fertilization Comes to America: Memoir of a Medical Breakthrough, retelling his amazing career. A year earlier, he published Personhood Revisited: Reproductive Technology, Bioethics, Religion and the Law, an exploration into the legal and ethical implications of fertility treatments and a perspective on pending legislation seeking to define the union of a sperm and egg as a person. Dr. Jones published a dozen books and hundreds of scientific journal articles. Dr. Jones is survived by three children, seven grandchildren and fourteen great-grandchildren. His son, Howard W. Jones III, MD, is Chairman of the Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology at Vanderbilt University School of Medicine. A daughter, Georgeanna Jones Klingensmith, MD, is the Past Director of Pediatric Diabetes at the Barbara Davis Diabetes Center at the University of Colorado, and his son Lawrence Massey Jones is a Denver-based financial advisor. At a 100th birthday celebration Dr. Jones quoted his professor at Amherst in describing himself: ""Two Roads diverged in a wood, and I -- I took the one less traveled by, And that has made all the difference.""-- Robert Frost. The Board and staff of the Jones Foundation for Reproductive Medicine, millions of parents and children, and those who had the good fortune to be touched by his innovative genius and kind spirit honor the man who took the road less traveled.

A George Washington High school graduate, she received a BA in Economics from Hunter College and an MA in Economics and a PhD in Political Science from The Johns Hopkins University. An early rebel, Addie broke the mold for young Greek American woman and committed herself to doing what she could about the injustices she saw in the world. She was a fighter for gender equality decades before this novel idea had a name. A career in the academy was, for Addie, the ideal way to pursue knowledge and social change as a teacher, researcher and activist. Addie was an internationally recognized scholar of Human Rights and of Modern Greek Politics. Throughout a distinguished teaching career at Hunter and at the Graduate Faculty of the New School for Social Research, from which she retired as Professor Emerita, she mentored many students and engaged in significant collaborative research with several of them and other scholars. Her love of teaching was a dominant force in her life. A notable project was the weekly radio program on New York City's WEVD - Free Voice of Greece - a key component of the international movement that toppled the Greek military junta in 1974.

He was preceded in death by his beloved wife Judith Douglas Torrence in 2002. Jerry was born on February 10, 1935 in St. Charles, Madison County, Iowa, the only child of James and Laura Dawn Torrence. The family moved to Des Moines when Jerry was five, and his parents remained in that one house the rest of their lives. Jerry's entire education was through Iowa schools, from elementary school in Des Moines, to his years at North High, to his graduation with a BA in Business from the University of Iowa in 1957, where he pledged the Iowa Beta chapter of Sigma Alpha Epsilon in the spring of 1954. And for all his success and travel in later life, that Iowa foundation remained the single most important facet of his life, a memory that he supported emotionally and financially throughout his years. Jerry moved to Chicago after graduation to work at Marshall Field & Company, but an offer from Regal Rugs in New York in 1960 brought him to the city that that became his life. He drove through the Lincoln Tunnel that May in a convertible with Iowa plates, and a wooden ironing board lodged between luggage in the back seat and passenger's front seat. He stayed at Regal Rugs until his retirement in June of 2003. Jerry was fiercely loyal to his principles, the company and his customers, an invaluable asset to Regal. His social life paralleled his business career; Jerry's unique personality guaranteed that he did not go unnoticed in either a Board Room or a barroom. He became a fixture in some of the most popular retail stores, bars and restaurants in the booming Manhattan of the '60s through the '90s. Our collective recall of Jerry's antics at both work and play would fill a decent size coffee table book. The lasting legacy of the Torrence family, however, was their connection to St. Charles, and, in particular, the St. Charles Methodist Church. Jerry's parents, grandparents and Judith have been laid to rest at this beautiful ground, and Jerry contributed generously to the upkeep of the property for years. Jerry will be buried at St. Charles Cemetery next to his wife Judith on Saturday, August 29th, 2015.

After several years working in New York City for Bergdorf Goodman in Retail Finance, she earned an MBA at Dartmouth. Karen resumed her career in New York as a Corporate Banker and Security Analyst, specializing in media, cable and telecommunications at Citibank, Credit du Nord, The Royal Bank of Scotland and the NAIC as a Credit Analyst. For many years, Karen was Alumnae President of Society Zeta Alpha at Wellesley College and a volunteer at the Greenwich, CT Library. Karen will be sorely missed by her dear friends, to whom she was intensely loyal. She loved her cats Tucker and Shadow, the beach, old movies, Motown and classical music. Karen was known in post-college days for her glamorous style and active social life. She was an incurable romantic and whenever we hear a song by Earth, Wind & Fire, we will picture Karen dancing. 1/3"

Sonya Starr, a remarkable, beautiful and vivacious woman who loved and lived life to its fullest, died peacefully in her New York City apartment on Sunday, August 9, following a courageous battle with lymphoma. She was 68. Raised by a strong and loving grandmother and mother in a close-knit Russian family that had escaped Stalinist Russia, Sonya came with her family to New York City as a very young girl. When her father, a noted Dostoevsky scholar, joined the faculty at Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute, the family relocated to Troy, NY, where Sonya, recognized for her intellectual promise, entered Russell Sage College at age 15. Receiving a master's degree in Russian Literature from the State University of New York at Albany and fluent in Russian, French and Spanish, Sonya realized she had a unique talent for business. She also had an appreciation for historic buildings, and at a time when inner cities in New York, such as Albany and Troy, were focusing on revitalization, she built a successful real estate company by acquiring, renovating and managing older residential buildings. Wide-ranging and accomplished, Sonya was a true Renaissance woman. She had a deep love of literature, art and nature, and was devoted to her two Yorkies, Misha and Sasha. With her life partner, she amassed an important collection of vintage photographs and sculpture. Sonya was also an accomplished gardener and took great pride in the exquisite natural landscape and sculpture garden she created at her summer home in East Hampton, NY. Her exceptional taste extended beyond the garden to her personal style and elegant decor of her homes.

2015-08-11T00:00:00Z,"VAUGHN--Terry. Oxford University Press mourns the passing of Terry Vaughn, friend, colleague, and fellow traveler. Terry was a legendary editor whose influence in economics and finance publishing was powerfully in evidence for decades and whose contributions spanned the programs of MIT Press, Princeton University Press, and Oxford University Press. His most important legacy, however, is his family and the network of friends and admirers he leaves behind. As we all struggle to make sense of the enormity and suddenness of this loss, the same sentiments are voiced again and again: ""Terry was a great editor but an even better person."" ""Terry was one of the nicest people I met in publishing, such a lovely guy."" ""I remember him fondly and with admiration."" ""There was such an aura of vigor and eternal youth about him."" Renowned for his passions and varied interests, his self-critical introspection, and his warmth and good will (as well as for a marvelously astute and pithy definition of game theory during an editorial meeting several years ago), Terry was a serious person with an easy laugh and a perpetually bemused air. We were very fond of him and we will miss him greatly. 1/3"

2015-08-11T00:00:00Z,"JOHNSEN--Niels Winchester. Age 93, Rumson. After busy summer days with grandchildren and great-grandchildren, Niels Winchester Johnsen, 93, passed away at home in Rumson, New Jersey, on Friday, August 7, 2015. Niels was predeceased by his wife, Millicent Mercer Johnsen, on September 7, 2013, and their daughter, Gretchen Johnsen Bryant, on June 18, 2014. Niels was the son of Niels F. Johnsen and Anita Winchester Johnsen of New Orleans and was born in New Orleans. Niels retired in 2003 as Chairman of International Shipholding Corporation, the parent company of Central Gulf Lines, Inc. and Waterman Steamship Corporation. Niels was co-founder, with his father and brother, Erik F. Johnsen, of Central Gulf Steamship Corporation in New Orleans, April 1947. After attending Tulane University, Niels began his career in the maritime industry in 1942, serving over three and one- half years as an officer in the Merchant Marine at sea during World War II. During his sea duty, he survived two ship torpedo sinkings. After coming ashore in 1946, Niels joined States Marine Lines, a United States flag shipping company chaired by his father-in-law, Henry Dickson Mercer. Niels served as vice- president of chartering at States Marine in New York until February 1957 when he resigned to devote full time to Central Gulf. During the years 1957-1971, Central Gulf became the major United States flag shipping company operating between the United States and the Middle East- Southeast Asia. In 1971 Central Gulf merged with Trans Union Corporation. Niels became a director of Trans Union as a result of the merger. During the years 1971- 1979, Central Gulf continued its growth. In 1979 Trans Union spun off its shipping interests under the name of International Shipholding Corporation and Niels became Chairman. International Shipholding continued its dominant United States flag presence under Niels' and his brother Erik's leadership. In 1985 International Shipholding became the first United States flag carrier to enter the specialized pure car/truck carrier trade. At various times over his 60-year maritime career, Niels served on the board of managers of the American Bureau of Shipping and the board of trustees of the Seaman's Church Institute. For many years he was a trustee of the Atlantic Mutual Insurance Corporation and a director of the Centennial Insurance Company and served as a director and chairman of the National Cargo Bureau. Over his long and distinguished career in the maritime industry, Niels' many achievements were given special recognition including the Seamen's Church Institute Silver Bell Award in 1988 and the Admiral of the Ocean Seas (AOTOS) Award in 1993. Niels was a member of India House, Rumson Country Club, Seabright Beach Club and Lyford Cay Club. He was a member of the First Presbyterian Church at Red Bank-Tower Hill and the Church of the Holy Cross in Vail, Colorado. Niels loved golf and was a long-time member of the United States Seniors Golf Association. Niels is survived by his brother, Erik F. Johnsen and his wife Barbara V. Johnsen; his two children: son Niels M. and wife Marlene; daughter Ingrid J. and husband William B. Barrett; seven grandchildren: Lisa J. and husband Michael S. Kane, Christina B. and husband Todd R. Robida, Elizabeth B. and husband Jeffrey T. Gardner, Jonathan W. and wife Carissa S. Barrett, and W. Brooks Barrett; Stephanie A. and husband Ken Moyers, and Heather C.

He was highly regarded and admired for his work in the healthcare industry, and he was a frequent speaker at conferences and a regular contributor to professional journals.

2015-08-15T00:00:00Z,"SCOTT--John Gavin. John Scott, LVO, D.Mus honoris causa, June 18, 1956-- August 12, 2015. The Rector, Wardens, and Vestry of Saint Thomas Church Fifth Avenue, on behalf of the parish, announce the death of their beloved Organist and Director of Music (2004-- 2015). He is survived by his wife, Lily Ardalan Scott; his children, Emma and Alex, and their mother, Jane Lumsden; and his sisters Judith Schatunowski and Helen Church. Lily Scott is expecting their first child in September 2015. John was born in 1956 in Wakefield, Yorkshire, UK, where he became a Cathedral chorister. While still at school he gained the diplomas of the Royal College of Organists and won the major prizes. In 1974, he became Organ Scholar of St. John's College, Cambridge under Dr. George Guest. John made his debut in the 1977 Promenade Concerts in the Royal Albert Hall, playing Reubke's Sonata on the 94th Psalm. He was the youngest organist to appear as a soloist in the Proms. On leaving Cambridge, John was appointed Assistant Organist at London's two Anglican Cathedrals: St. Paul's and Southwark. During this time he won first prizes from Manchester and Leipzig J.S. Bach International Organ Competitions in 1978 and 1984 respectively. In 1985, John became Sub-Organist of St. Paul's Cathedral, and in 1990 he succeeded Dr. Christopher Dearnley as Organist and Director of Music. During his 26 years at St. Paul's, he was responsible for the nine weekly choral services, concerts, and for the music at a number of high profile events including the service to mark the Queen's Golden Jubilee in 2002 for which he wrote the anthem, Behold, O God Our Defender, based on Psalm 84. He also directed the music at the memorial service at St. Paul's after 9/11. John was made a Lieutenant of the Royal Victorian Order, a personal gift from the Queen, in recognition of his work at St. Paul's Cathedral. In the summer of 2004, John was appointed Organist and Director of Music at Saint Thomas Church Fifth Avenue, where he directed the Choir of Men and Boys until his death. John worked tirelessly with the boys of Saint Thomas Choir School, the only choral boarding school in North America. An exceptional choral trainer, John was monumental in shaping the lives of young choristers and generations of church musicians. His Missa Dies Resurrectionis has been performed each Easter at Saint Thomas since its premiere in 2011. John conducted the Choir of Men and Boys in numerous recordings including Mozart's arrangement of Handel's Messiah and Faure's Requiem. In 2015, John and the Choir of Men and Boys began a major collaboration with Resonus Classics which recently produced a new recording of Motets by J.S. Bach. At Saint Paul's John played a complete cycle of the organ works of J.S. Bach in 2000 and followed this in subsequent years with the organ symphonies of Vierne and Widor, as well as the complete works of Franck and Buxtehude. At Saint Thomas, he performed complete cycles of the organ works of Buxtehude in 2007, Messiaen in 2008, and the six organ symphonies of Louis Vierne in 2009. His most recent solo recital at Saint Thomas took place in June, 2015 with a program of works by J.S. Bach that was based on a recital by Mendelsohn at the Thomaskirche, Leipzig in 1840. John was equally renowned for inspiring church musicians to his impeccable standards. For the last several years, John has spearheaded Saint Thomas Church in one of its most ambitious projects to date: the building of a new pipe organ by Dobson Pipe Organ Builders of Lake City, IA. The new organ, which is expected to be completed in 2018, has already been named the Irene D. and William R. Miller Chancel Organ in honor of Dr. John Scott. He insisted that Bach's motto, Soli Deo Gloria (Glory to God alone) be carved in the new organ case of the Miller-Scott Organ as a reminder of the importance of liturgical music. As an organist, John performed on five continents, premiered many new works written for him, and worked with various specialist ensembles. In recent years he performed recitals at the Thomaskirche, Leipzig; Notre Dame, Paris; Disney Hall, Los Angeles; Merton College, Oxford; and Royal Albert Hall, London. He once said ""I envy other musicians who can take their instrument with them when they travel. For me, it's a new instrument each time"". In addition to his work as a conductor and organist, John has published many choral compositions and arrangements and has jointly edited two compilations of liturgical music for the Church's year published by Oxford University Press. His numerous organ recordings include the sonatas of Elgar, organ music by William Mathias, Durufle and Mendelssohn, as well as two discs of Dupre. He also recorded the solo organ part in Janacek's Glagolitic Mass with the London Symphony Orchestra, conducted by Michael Tilson Thomas. The funeral service will be at Saint Thomas Church Fifth Avenue; the date and time will be posted at saintthomaschurch.org. Donations may be made in John Scott's memory to the MillerScott Organ Fund. Please make checks payable to Saint Thomas Church Fifth Avenue; 1 West 53rd Street; New York, NY 10019-5496. The Reverend Canon Carl F. Turner, Rector Kenneth F.

2015-08-16T00:00:00Z,"NICHOLAS--Joyce A. Joyce A. Nicholas, a resident of Carmel, California, died at home on July 22, 2015 of complications stemming from a stroke and Alzheimer's disease. She was preceded in death by her husband of 42 years, John C. Nicholas, who passed away on October 18, 2014. Joyce spent her early years shuttling between relatives in Brooklyn, New York and Oakland, California, with one long-treasured visit to a family farm in upper Michigan. During her teen years, she lived in San Francisco with her mother. Curious and adventurous in spirit, a lifetime characteristic, led her to leave the west for New York City, where she worked as a fashion model for designer, Bill Blass. A voracious reader, Joyce had no need for writing classes to build a career as a writer and editor. She wrote fashion reviews for The New York Herald Tribune and articles for House & Garden and Vogue. She was the author of three books: ""The New York I Love,"" ""The San Francisco I Love,"" and ""Adultery for Adults"" (co-authored with Marilyn Mercer). Her writings were published under the name ""Joyce Peterson,"" the name of a divorced husband. Joyce was a seasoned traveler, having spent much of the late 1940's in Europe. She and John Nicholas married in 1972 and over the years the couple was to travel throughout the world, forging several lasting friendships. Passionate about food and cooking, they operated a combination restaurant and art gallery in West Cornwall, Connecticut. Next they moved back to San Francisco where they opened an antique store. Then, in the eighties, wanting to be closer to John's four children, they moved back to New York and opened another antique store in Southampton. Retiring in Carmel and Palm Desert, California, Joyce was active in local politics. She was an avid supporter of animal rights and believed in supporting local artists. Joyce is survived by four step-children, and five step-grandchildren, and a cousin, Gus Almquist. A memorial service is scheduled on August 19 at 3pm. The Brownsville Cemetery, Brownsville, Vermont. The family requests that, in lieu of flowers, donations be made in the name of Joyce Nicholas to the SPCA of Monterey County, California. 1/3"
2015-08-16T00:00:00Z,"SOMERFIELD--Barbara. June 14, 1948 - August 11, 2015. On Tuesday, August 11, Barbara Somerfield entered the next realm after a long series of illnesses. Dance was part of her life's passion starting at an early age, her father danced with her on his shoulders as a nightly ritual. At three and a half she started dance lessons with close family friend, Ruth Benov. In high school she traveled from Queens to Manhattan every day after school to train at the Martha Graham School. Martha's spiritual philosophy implanted in her many of the qualities that would guide her life: falling and getting up over and over again, discipline, and appreciation for beauty in all forms. Yuriko took her to Connecticut College, where she studied with some of the greats of modern dance: Jose Lemon, Alvin Ailey, Jean Erdman. In 1966 she entered the New York University Theater Program with the intention of becoming a professional dancer. A spinal injury ended this dream. She then joined Henry Weingarten at the New York Astrology Center, which became a leading bookstore for metaphysical and alternative health books and a center for classes in these fields. She and Henry founded the National Astrological Society in 1970, and through this organization sponsored conferences around the country presenting the giants in the field, Dane Rudhyar, Marc Edmund Jones, Ronald Davison, B. V. Ramen, and others, inspiring a new generation of astrologers. After a healing through acupuncture in England, she and Henry founded ASI Publishing to publish the first acupuncture text in America. ASI went on to publish other ground breaking books in metaphysics and alternative health. After leaving ASI Barbara founded Aurora Press, Inc. in 1981. Aurora continues to publish books in the fields of astrology and metaphysics. Over the years she has supported many charities working with children, trauma survivors, AIDS patients, women's health, and poverty alleviation. She is a member of Central Synagogue of New York. Barbara was born in June 1948 in Manhattan to Ralph and Elsie Somerfield, who predecease her.

2015-08-16T00:00:00Z,"SCOTT--John Gavin. John Scott, LVO, D.Mus honoris causa, June 18, 1956-- August 12, 2015. The Rector, Wardens, and Vestry of Saint Thomas Church Fifth Avenue, on behalf of the parish, announce the death of their beloved Organist and Director of Music (2004-- 2015). He is survived by his wife, Lily Ardalan Scott; his children, Emma and Alex, and their mother, Jane Lumsden; and his sisters Judith Schatunowski and Helen Church. Lily Scott is expecting their first child in September 2015. John was born in 1956 in Wakefield, Yorkshire, UK, where he became a Cathedral chorister. While still at school he gained the diplomas of the Royal College of Organists and won the major prizes. In 1974, he became Organ Scholar of St. John's College, Cambridge under Dr. George Guest. John made his debut in the 1977 Promenade Concerts in the Royal Albert Hall, playing Reubke's Sonata on the 94th Psalm. He was the youngest organist to appear as a soloist in the Proms. On leaving Cambridge, John was appointed Assistant Organist at London's two Anglican Cathedrals: St. Paul's and Southwark. During this time he won first prizes from Manchester and Leipzig J.S. Bach International Organ Competitions in 1978 and 1984 respectively. In 1985, John became Sub-Organist of St. Paul's Cathedral, and in 1990 he succeeded Dr. Christopher Dearnley as Organist and Director of Music. During his 26 years at St. Paul's, he was responsible for the nine weekly choral services, concerts, and for the music at a number of high profile events including the service to mark the Queen's Golden Jubilee in 2002 for which he wrote the anthem, Behold, O God Our Defender, based on Psalm 84. He also directed the music at the memorial service at St. Paul's after 9/11. John was made a Lieutenant of the Royal Victorian Order, a personal gift from the Queen, in recognition of his work at St. Paul's Cathedral. In the summer of 2004, John was appointed Organist and Director of Music at Saint Thomas Church Fifth Avenue, where he directed the Choir of Men and Boys until his death. John worked tirelessly with the boys of Saint Thomas Choir School, the only choral boarding school in North America. An exceptional choral trainer, John was monumental in shaping the lives of young choristers and generations of church musicians. His Missa Dies Resurrectionis has been performed each Easter at Saint Thomas since its premiere in 2011. John conducted the Choir of Men and Boys in numerous recordings including Mozart's arrangement of Handel's Messiah and Faure's Requiem. In 2015, John and the Choir of Men and Boys began a major collaboration with Resonus Classics which recently produced a new recording of Motets by J.S. Bach. At Saint Paul's John played a complete cycle of the organ works of J.S. Bach in 2000 and followed this in subsequent years with the organ symphonies of Vierne and Widor, as well as the complete works of Franck and Buxtehude. At Saint Thomas, he performed complete cycles of the organ works of Buxtehude in 2007, Messiaen in 2008, and the six organ symphonies of Louis Vierne in 2009. His most recent solo recital at Saint Thomas took place in June, 2015 with a program of works by J.S. Bach that was based on a recital by Mendelsohn at the Thomaskirche, Leipzig in 1840. John was equally renowned for inspiring church musicians to his impeccable standards. For the last several years, John has spearheaded Saint Thomas Church in one of its most ambitious projects to date: the building of a new pipe organ by Dobson Pipe Organ Builders of Lake City, IA. The new organ, which is expected to be completed in 2018, has already been named the Irene D. and William R. Miller Chancel Organ in honor of Dr. John Scott. He insisted that Bach's motto, Soli Deo Gloria (Glory to God alone) be carved in the new organ case of the Miller-Scott Organ as a reminder of the importance of liturgical music. As an organist, John performed on five continents, premiered many new works written for him, and worked with various specialist ensembles. In recent years he performed recitals at the Thomaskirche, Leipzig; Notre Dame, Paris; Disney Hall, Los Angeles; Merton College, Oxford; and Royal Albert Hall, London. He once said ""I envy other musicians who can take their instrument with them when they travel. For me, it's a new instrument each time"". In addition to his work as a conductor and organist, John has published many choral compositions and arrangements and has jointly edited two compilations of liturgical music for the Church's year published by Oxford University Press. His numerous organ recordings include the sonatas of Elgar, organ music by William Mathias, Durufle and Mendelssohn, as well as two discs of Dupre. He also recorded the solo organ part in Janacek's Glagolitic Mass with the London Symphony Orchestra, conducted by Michael Tilson Thomas. The funeral service will be at Saint Thomas Church Fifth Avenue; the date and time will be posted at saintthomaschurch.org. Donations may be made in John Scott's memory to the MillerScott Organ Fund.

Sonya Starr, a remarkable, beautiful and vivacious woman who loved and lived life to its fullest, died peacefully in her New York City apartment on Sunday, August 9, following a courageous battle with lymphoma. She was 68. Raised by a strong and loving grandmother and mother in a close-knit Russian family that had escaped Stalinist Russia, Sonya came with her family to New York City as a very young girl. When her father, a noted Dostoevsky scholar, joined the faculty at Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute, the family relocated to Troy, NY, where Sonya, recognized for her intellectual promise, entered Russell Sage College at age 15. Receiving a master's degree in Russian Literature from the State University of New York at Albany and fluent in Russian, French and Spanish, Sonya realized she had a unique talent for business. She also had an appreciation for historic buildings, and at a time when inner cities in New York, such as Albany and Troy, were focusing on revitalization, she built a successful real estate company by acquiring, renovating and managing older residential buildings. Wide-ranging and accomplished, Sonya was a true Renaissance woman. She had a deep love of literature, art and nature, and was devoted to her two Yorkies, Misha and Sasha. With her life partner, she amassed an important collection of vintage photographs and sculpture. Sonya was also an accomplished gardener and took great pride in the exquisite natural landscape and sculpture garden she created at her summer home in East Hampton, NY. Her exceptional taste extended beyond the garden to her personal style and elegant decor of her homes. Her enthusiasm for life, wonderful humor, sharp intelligence and peerless creativity will be deeply missed by friends and family, and her memory forever cherished by Lisa Rosenblum her spouse and partner of 36 years.

2015-08-16T00:00:00Z,"SCHWARCZ--June. (1918-2015). June Schwarcz, (97), who died at her home in Sausalito, California on Sunday, August 2nd, was among the most innovative and highly respected artists working in the late 20th-century enamels field. Best known for her electroformed metal sculpture, embellished with rich enamel color, she produced an extensive body of work which, while referring to time-honored vessel making traditions, defy convention. For more than sixty years she created inventive forms in glass and metal that set new standards for the field while she served as mentor to generations of young and emerging artists. Recognized early on for her innovative approach to the medium, she was included in 1956 in Craftsmanship in a Changing World, the inaugural exhibition at the Museum of Contemporary Crafts, New York; that museum's seminal 1959 exhibition Enamels; and the watershed traveling exhibition Objects: U.S.A. in 1969. She was designated a California Living Treasure in 1985. She was a founding member of the Northern California Enamels Guild, a member of the Enamelist Society where in 1991 she was given a Lifetime Achievement Award, and in 2009 she was given the Masters of the Medium Award by the James Renwick Alliance of the Smithsonian American Art Museum. Born in Denver in 1918, June Theresa Morris studied industrial design at the Pratt Institute in Brooklyn from 1939 to 1941. After working in the New York fashion and design industries for several years, she married Leroy Schwarcz, a mechanical engineer, in 1943. She moved several times with her husband and two children before settling in Sausalito, California in 1954. While visiting her family in Denver in 1953, Schwarcz was introduced to enameling and was immediately drawn to the medium's brilliant color and rich, expressive potential. In many of her earliest pieces, Schwarcz utilized the traditional basse-taille enameling technique, cutting and etching into the surface of copper vessels and plaques to create complex, abstract compositions that were visible through layers of transparent enamel. Around 1962, she began to experiment with an electroforming process she had learned through a colleague of her husband's at Stanford University. She used this process to produce unique forms in copper that she subsequently enameled. In this work, the rough quality of the electroformed metal offers a potent contrast to the brilliant color and smooth glassy surface of the enamel. This dialog between the raw and refined was fundamental to Schwarcz's work throughout her career. Her protean imagination, which found inspiration in all manner of artistic practice from contemporary abstraction to Asian textile design, was unbounded as she provided a model of enduring creativity to all those drawn to the contemporary enamels field. In more recent years Schwarcz was featured in a 1998 retrospective exhibition Forty Years/Forty Pieces at the San Francisco Craft and Folk Art Museum; in 2007 in Painting with Fire: Masters of Enameling in America, 1930 - 1980 at the Long Beach Museum of Art; and in 2009 Transformed by Fire: June Schwarcz Enameled Vessels at the Mingei Museum, San Diego. Examples of her work are in the collections of numerous institutions including the Metropolitan Museum of Art, New York; the Museum of Fine Arts, Boston; the Smithsonian American Art Museum; the Fine Arts Museums of San Francisco and many others. She is survived by her son Carl, daughter-in-law Molly Clark, her daughter Kim, and grandson Adam. The family requests that in lieu of flowers, donations in June's memory be made to the ACLU or to the Enamel Arts Foundation. As per her request, there will be no memorial service although condolences may be sent to Kim Schwarcz, 22 Seawolf Passage, Corte Madera, CA 94925. 1/3"
2015-08-16T00:00:00Z,"MACDONALD--Cynthia Lee, passed away at the age of 87 after a more than 10 year battle with Alzheimer's. Cynthia was by trade, a poet, a psychoanalyst and an opera singer, and by heart the mother of two children and one grandchild who survive her, Jennifer Tim Macdonald of New York, NY, and Scott Thurston Macdonald of Denver Colorado; and grandchild Liam Skyler Watts of New York, NY. Cynthia was born in New York City in 1928 to parents Dorothy Kiam and screenwriter Leonard Lee, and was raised in New York and Beverly Hills. She was educated at the Brearley School, the Mannes School of Music, Bennington and Sara Lawrence College. Her professional life began as a dramatic soprano, winning both the San Francisco Opera Auditions and singing on CBC Radio. After marrying Shell Oil executive ""Mac"" Macdonald, their geographic movements as related to his career, made the continued pursuit of a singing career difficult, and so with early support from poet Ann Sexton, she turned her fine intellect and talent instead to the pursuit of the voice of the pen, going on to publish six volumes of poetry. Cynthia taught in the early 70's at Sarah Lawrence where she served as the interim Dean of Studies, and then as tenured faculty at Johns Hopkins University. In 1979, she cofounded the University of Houston graduate creative writing program, which soon became one of the top graduate writing programs in the country. Motivated to help students solve writing blocks, she studied Freudian psychoanalysis, becoming the first non MD student ever to be accepted in to the Houston- Galveston Psychoanalytic Institute. She later joined the faculty of the Institute and maintained a psychoanalytic practice while continuing to teach at University of Houston. Cynthia's last book, ""I Can't Remember"", uncannily foreshadowed her illness. Cynthia would wish- and will be-largely remembered by her many achievements, but her family will also remember her for the grace and courage she showed as she navigated the collapsing empire of her mind. A Memorial Service, to be held this fall, will be announced. In lieu of Flowers please consider donations in Cynthia's name to INPRINT, Houston's premier literary arts nonprofit whom she participated in cofounding, or the Fisher Center for Alzheimer's Research. 1/3"

2015-08-17T00:00:00Z,"ROGERS--Hartley, Jr. Professor emeritus of mathematics at MIT, died in Waltham, MA, on Friday, July 17. He was 89. Rogers joined the MIT mathematics faculty in 1956 as an assistant professor and was promoted to full professor in 1964. He retired from MIT in 2009. Along with mathematics, Rogers maintained a love for English literature, the field of his undergraduate degree. In the 1960s, he took up rowing with a passion. He was a founding member of the Charles River All Star Has-Beens (CRASH-B) and served as its unofficial guru for three decades. He won numerous medals at the CRASH-B sprints as well as at World Rowing Masters competitions and the Head of the Charles Regatta. In addition, he was the president of Boston Rowing Center, which prepared many top athletes for the U.S. national team in the 1980s and early 1990s. A popular and respected teacher, Rogers received the Teaching Prize for Undergraduate Education from the School of Science in 1993. His graduate lectures in mathematical logic were known for their eloquence and clarity, and he was also known for assigning challenging problem sets. He produced 19 doctoral students at MIT, with 557 mathematical ""descendants"" in total. Rogers' research interests were in mathematical logic, and he is credited as one of the main developers of recursion theory and of the usefulness and validity of informal methods in this area. He was the author of the 1967 book, ""Theory of Recursive Functions and Effective Computability,"" which has become a central and standard reference in the field and remains in print. Among his distinctions, Rogers received the Lewis R. Ford Award from the Mathematical Association of America for his expository papers in 1965. Rogers' career at MIT included significant administrative service during the 1960s and 1970s. He also served as vice president of the Association for Symbolic Logic, senior editor of the Journal of Symbolic Logic, senior editor of Annals of Mathematical Logic, and associate editor of the Journal of Computer and Systems Sciences. Rogers served as chair of the MIT faculty from 1971 to 1973, and as associate provost from 1974 to 1980. He chaired the editorial board of the MIT Press from 1974 to 1981, as the press became an arm of the Institute's educational mission. A Focus on Mentorship. At Rogers' suggestion in 1996, the Department of Mathematics initiated its Summer Program in Undergraduate Research (SPUR), where teams pair a graduate student mentor with an MIT undergraduate; each team then works intensively on a research problem over a six-week summer period, culminating with the undergraduate giving a presentation and submitting written materials to a group of math faculty. Under Rogers' direction through 2006, SPUR became popular with students who saw its educational benefits. In 2001, the Rogers family established the Hartley Rogers, Jr. Prize for the top SPUR teams selected by the faculty. The prize has not only boosted the competitive spirit of its participants, but has attracted participation by graduate students from Harvard University and exchange students from Cambridge University. Hartley Rogers, Jr., was born in Buffalo, New York on July 6, 1926. He received his BA in English from Yale University in 1946. Following a year at Cambridge University as a Henry Fellow, he returned to Yale to complete his MS in physics in 1950. He continued his studies at Princeton University in mathematics, receiving his MA in 1951 and his PhD in 1952, with Alonzo Church as his thesis advisor. Rogers' first academic appointment was as Benjamin Peirce Lecturer at Harvard from 1952 to 1955. Rogers was a devoted father, fiercely proud of his children and their accomplishments. He is survived by his wife, Dr. Adrianne E. Rogers; by his three children, Hartley R. Rogers, Campbell D.K. Rogers, and Caroline R. Broderick; and by 10 grandchildren. The family will be holding a private service on Monday, August 17, at the Parish of the Epiphany in Winchester, MA.

2015-08-17T00:00:00Z,"SCOTT--John Gavin. John Scott, LVO, D.Mus honoris causa, June 18, 1956-- August 12, 2015. The Rector, Wardens, and Vestry of Saint Thomas Church Fifth Avenue, on behalf of the parish, announce the death of their beloved Organist and Director of Music (2004-- 2015). He is survived by his wife, Lily Ardalan Scott; his children, Emma and Alex, and their mother, Jane Lumsden; and his sisters Judith Schatunowski and Helen Church. Lily Scott is expecting their first child in September 2015. John was born in 1956 in Wakefield, Yorkshire, UK, where he became a Cathedral chorister. While still at school he gained the diplomas of the Royal College of Organists and won the major prizes. In 1974, he became Organ Scholar of St. John's College, Cambridge under Dr. George Guest. John made his debut in the 1977 Promenade Concerts in the Royal Albert Hall, playing Reubke's Sonata on the 94th Psalm. He was the youngest organist to appear as a soloist in the Proms. On leaving Cambridge, John was appointed Assistant Organist at London's two Anglican Cathedrals: St. Paul's and Southwark. During this time he won first prizes from Manchester and Leipzig J.S. Bach International Organ Competitions in 1978 and 1984 respectively. In 1985, John became Sub-Organist of St. Paul's Cathedral, and in 1990 he succeeded Dr. Christopher Dearnley as Organist and Director of Music. During his 26 years at St. Paul's, he was responsible for the nine weekly choral services, concerts, and for the music at a number of high profile events including the service to mark the Queen's Golden Jubilee in 2002 for which he wrote the anthem, Behold, O God Our Defender, based on Psalm 84. He also directed the music at the memorial service at St. Paul's after 9/11. John was made a Lieutenant of the Royal Victorian Order, a personal gift from the Queen, in recognition of his work at St. Paul's Cathedral. In the summer of 2004, John was appointed Organist and Director of Music at Saint Thomas Church Fifth Avenue, where he directed the Choir of Men and Boys until his death. John worked tirelessly with the boys of Saint Thomas Choir School, the only choral boarding school in North America. An exceptional choral trainer, John was monumental in shaping the lives of young choristers and generations of church musicians. His Missa Dies Resurrectionis has been performed each Easter at Saint Thomas since its premiere in 2011. John conducted the Choir of Men and Boys in numerous recordings including Mozart's arrangement of Handel's Messiah and Faure's Requiem. In 2015, John and the Choir of Men and Boys began a major collaboration with Resonus Classics which recently produced a new recording of Motets by J.S. Bach. At Saint Paul's John played a complete cycle of the organ works of J.S. Bach in 2000 and followed this in subsequent years with the organ symphonies of Vierne and Widor, as well as the complete works of Franck and Buxtehude. At Saint Thomas, he performed complete cycles of the organ works of Buxtehude in 2007, Messiaen in 2008, and the six organ symphonies of Louis Vierne in 2009. His most recent solo recital at Saint Thomas took place in June, 2015 with a program of works by J.S. Bach that was based on a recital by Mendelsohn at the Thomaskirche, Leipzig in 1840. John was equally renowned for inspiring church musicians to his impeccable standards. For the last several years, John has spearheaded Saint Thomas Church in one of its most ambitious projects to date: the building of a new pipe organ by Dobson Pipe Organ Builders of Lake City, IA. The new organ, which is expected to be completed in 2018, has already been named the Irene D. and William R. Miller Chancel Organ in honor of Dr. John Scott. He insisted that Bach's motto, Soli Deo Gloria (Glory to God alone) be carved in the new organ case of the Miller-Scott Organ as a reminder of the importance of liturgical music. As an organist, John performed on five continents, premiered many new works written for him, and worked with various specialist ensembles. In recent years he performed recitals at the Thomaskirche, Leipzig; Notre Dame, Paris; Disney Hall, Los Angeles; Merton College, Oxford; and Royal Albert Hall, London. He once said ""I envy other musicians who can take their instrument with them when they travel. For me, it's a new instrument each time"".

2015-08-17T00:00:00Z,"MACDONALD--Cynthia Lee, passed away at the age of 87 after a more than 10 year battle with Alzheimer's. Cynthia was by trade, a poet, a psychoanalyst and an opera singer, and by heart the mother of two children and one grandchild who survive her, Jennifer Tim Macdonald of New York, NY, and Scott Thurston Macdonald of Denver Colorado; and grandchild Liam Skyler Watts of New York, NY. Cynthia was born in New York City in 1928 to parents Dorothy Kiam and screenwriter Leonard Lee, and was raised in New York and Beverly Hills. She was educated at the Brearley School, the Mannes School of Music, Bennington and Sara Lawrence College. Her professional life began as a dramatic soprano, winning both the San Francisco Opera Auditions and singing on CBC Radio. After marrying Shell Oil executive ""Mac"" Macdonald, their geographic movements as related to his career, made the continued pursuit of a singing career difficult, and so with early support from poet Ann Sexton, she turned her fine intellect and talent instead to the pursuit of the voice of the pen, going on to publish six volumes of poetry. Cynthia taught in the early 70's at Sarah Lawrence where she served as the interim Dean of Studies, and then as tenured faculty at Johns Hopkins University. In 1979, she cofounded the University of Houston graduate creative writing program, which soon became one of the top graduate writing programs in the country. Motivated to help students solve writing blocks, she studied Freudian psychoanalysis, becoming the first non MD student ever to be accepted in to the Houston- Galveston Psychoanalytic Institute. She later joined the faculty of the Institute and maintained a psychoanalytic practice while continuing to teach at University of Houston. Cynthia's last book, ""I Can't Remember"", uncannily foreshadowed her illness. Cynthia would wish- and will be-largely remembered by her many achievements, but her family will also remember her for the grace and courage she showed as she navigated the collapsing empire of her mind. A Memorial Service, to be held this fall, will be announced. In lieu of Flowers please consider donations in Cynthia's name to INPRINT, Houston's premier literary arts nonprofit whom she participated in cofounding, or the Fisher Center for Alzheimer's Research. 1/3"

He was born in Newark, NJ and lived in New York City, Union, NJ as well as Canton, Ohio where he graduated from McKinley High School. A proud graduate of Michigan State University, Franklin also attended NYU Business School and was a graduate of the Advanced Management Program at Harvard University. He was a pioneer in the development of variable insurance products and served as President of Equitable Variable Life, Chief Executive Officer of Integrity Life and National Mutual Life in the USA.

Franklin who was stricken with polio at an early age, was disabled all of his adult life, however, after a series of amazing successes, he would often say his disability never defined him rather it made him stronger and more determined.

2015-08-17T00:00:00Z,"BOND--Julian. The board of directors and the staff of the American Civil Liberties Union mourn the passing of Julian Bond, a civil rights leader and true hero. As the chairperson of the NAACP, he was a monumental leader of the civil rights movement for decades. He was also an esteemed leader of the ACLU and served on the ACLU National Advisory Council where, in addition to racial justice, he also pushed the needle forward on many other significant civil rights issues, including free speech, voting rights, women's rights and more. The ACLU represented him in 1966 when he was elected to the Georgia state legislature, but was blocked from serving because he publicly supported Vietnam draft resisters. The court ruled in Bond v. Floyd that criticizing U.S. foreign policy does not violate a legislator's oath to uphold the Constitution. Our deepest sympathies go out to his family and to all who loved him. While we'll no longer be graced by the physical presence of Julian Bond, his legacy is marked in the history books and forever etched in our hearts. Anthony D.

Born February 20, 1926, daughter of Hortense and Dr. Abraham Isaac Rubenstone, Jeanne was loved and adored by her husband Zola, to whom she was married for 55 years until his death in 2000, and her surviving children and their spouses, Emily Aronson (Steven J. Ross), Theodore Aronson (Barbara Aronson) and Merry Aronson (Larry Payne). She was also cherished by her three grandchildren, Theo, Natalie, and Sam. Fiercely intelligent and witty, Jeanne was a political activist and served as Vice Chairman, Treasurer, and Executive Director of the Nassau County Democratic Committee for many years, long before women worked outside of the household. Jeanne was indefatigable in her efforts to elect public servants she believed in, and orchestrated many successful campaigns and fundraisers over the course of several decades. She served as a delegate in the 1980 democratic convention. Her love and compassion touched many lives, her humor was boundless and her radiant spirit brought joy to everyone who knew her.

Melva embodied the risk-taking and artist-centric vision of Gertrude Vanderbilt Whitney, establishing the Bucksbaum Award in 2000 and naming the Bucksbaum, Learsy, Scanlan Conservation Center in the Whitney's new building. Believing that art is our collective heritage to be shared by all, she donated dozens of artworks to the Whitney. We are immensely proud to continue Melva's legacy and to have her name linked in perpetuity to the Museum through the Melva Bucksbaum Associate Director for Conservation and Research--a position which her loving daughter Mary named in her honor. Melva made an enormous difference in a multitude of lives through her kindness, spirit and resources. She set a shining example that a good life is made by giving back.

As the chairperson of the NAACP, he was a monumental leader of the civil rights movement for decades. He was also an esteemed leader of the ACLU and served on the ACLU National Advisory Council where, in addition to racial justice, he also pushed the needle forward on many other significant civil rights issues, including free speech, voting rights, women's rights and more. The ACLU represented him in 1966 when he was elected to the Georgia state legislature, but was blocked from serving because he publicly supported Vietnam draft resisters. The court ruled in Bond v. Floyd that criticizing U.S. foreign policy does not violate a legislator's oath to uphold the Constitution. Our deepest sympathies go out to his family and to all who loved him.

2015-08-18T00:00:00Z,"ROGERS--Hartley, Jr. Professor emeritus of mathematics at MIT, died in Waltham, MA, on Friday, July 17. He was 89. Rogers joined the MIT mathematics faculty in 1956 as an assistant professor and was promoted to full professor in 1964. He retired from MIT in 2009. Along with mathematics, Rogers maintained a love for English literature, the field of his undergraduate degree. In the 1960s, he took up rowing with a passion. He was a founding member of the Charles River All Star Has-Beens (CRASH-B) and served as its unofficial guru for three decades. He won numerous medals at the CRASH-B sprints as well as at World Rowing Masters competitions and the Head of the Charles Regatta. In addition, he was the president of Boston Rowing Center, which prepared many top athletes for the U.S. national team in the 1980s and early 1990s. A popular and respected teacher, Rogers received the Teaching Prize for Undergraduate Education from the School of Science in 1993. His graduate lectures in mathematical logic were known for their eloquence and clarity, and he was also known for assigning challenging problem sets. He produced 19 doctoral students at MIT, with 557 mathematical ""descendants"" in total. Rogers' research interests were in mathematical logic, and he is credited as one of the main developers of recursion theory and of the usefulness and validity of informal methods in this area. He was the author of the 1967 book, ""Theory of Recursive Functions and Effective Computability,"" which has become a central and standard reference in the field and remains in print. Among his distinctions, Rogers received the Lewis R. Ford Award from the Mathematical Association of America for his expository papers in 1965. Rogers' career at MIT included significant administrative service during the 1960s and 1970s. He also served as vice president of the Association for Symbolic Logic, senior editor of the Journal of Symbolic Logic, senior editor of Annals of Mathematical Logic, and associate editor of the Journal of Computer and Systems Sciences. Rogers served as chair of the MIT faculty from 1971 to 1973, and as associate provost from 1974 to 1980. He chaired the editorial board of the MIT Press from 1974 to 1981, as the press became an arm of the Institute's educational mission. A Focus on Mentorship. At Rogers' suggestion in 1996, the Department of Mathematics initiated its Summer Program in Undergraduate Research (SPUR), where teams pair a graduate student mentor with an MIT undergraduate; each team then works intensively on a research problem over a six-week summer period, culminating with the undergraduate giving a presentation and submitting written materials to a group of math faculty. Under Rogers' direction through 2006, SPUR became popular with students who saw its educational benefits. In 2001, the Rogers family established the Hartley Rogers, Jr. Prize for the top SPUR teams selected by the faculty. The prize has not only boosted the competitive spirit of its participants, but has attracted participation by graduate students from Harvard University and exchange students from Cambridge University. Hartley Rogers, Jr., was born in Buffalo, New York on July 6, 1926. He received his BA in English from Yale University in 1946. Following a year at Cambridge University as a Henry Fellow, he returned to Yale to complete his MS in physics in 1950. He continued his studies at Princeton University in mathematics, receiving his MA in 1951 and his PhD in 1952, with Alonzo Church as his thesis advisor. Rogers' first academic appointment was as Benjamin Peirce Lecturer at Harvard from 1952 to 1955. Rogers was a devoted father, fiercely proud of his children and their accomplishments. He is survived by his wife, Dr. Adrianne E. Rogers; by his three children, Hartley R. Rogers, Campbell D.K. Rogers, and Caroline R. Broderick; and by 10 grandchildren. The family will be holding a private service on Monday, August 17, at the Parish of the Epiphany in Winchester, MA. Gifts in Rogers' memory may be made to the Hartley Rogers Jr. Fund in the Department of Mathematics at MIT. 1/3"

Melva embodied the risk-taking and artist-centric vision of Gertrude Vanderbilt Whitney, establishing the Bucksbaum Award in 2000 and naming the Bucksbaum, Learsy, Scanlan Conservation Center in the Whitney's new building.

We are immensely proud to continue Melva's legacy and to have her name linked in perpetuity to the Museum through the Melva Bucksbaum Associate Director for Conservation and Research--a position which her loving daughter Mary named in her honor. Melva made an enormous difference in a multitude of lives through her kindness, spirit and resources. She set a shining example that a good life is made by giving back. Melva was an extraordinarily courageous woman and her steadfast commitment to art and artists, her infectious optimism, elegance, and beautiful smile will be deeply missed. To know Melva was to love her, admire her and be embraced by her warmth. She was a gift to all of us who knew her. We extend our most heartfelt sympathy to Ray Learsy, Mary Bucksbaum Scanlan and Patrick Scanlan, Glenn and April Bucksbaum, Gene Bucksbaum, her grandchildren Martin, Stella, and Justin, her entire family and the many individuals whose lives she touched with her altruism and friendship.

2015-08-23T00:00:00Z,"HAYES--Dennis E.,marine geophysicist, plate tectonics pioneer, tenured Columbia University professor, who advanced mapping of the world's ocean floors, died at home in Manhattan on August 6, of Parkinson's Disease. He was 76. He produced an atlas of the Southern Ocean bottom, charted key geologic structures below the South China Sea, explored the margins of Western Africa and Southeast Asia, and advanced ideas on how the earth's interior influences ocean depths globally. He was an explorer and adventurer, and his interests lay beneath the ocean floor. ""The water just gets in my way,"" he liked to say. Hayes was Chief Scientist on the Vema in 1975 when it became the first research ship to sail more than one million miles. In 1979, soon after China reopened to the West, Hayes led the first United States - China joint exploration of geologic structures beneath the South China Sea. Data he collected is germane to today's conflicts among China and other nations over territorial sea rights, seafloor geology, and its relationship to land masses. Hayes wrote about the prospect of sealing nuclear waste into the seafloor, and about international management of mineral resources off Antarctica. In 2004, the international scientific community named a 400-kilometer- long feature in the Ross Sea off Antarctica in his honor, named the Hayes Bank. A microscopic protozoan, Prunopyle hayesi, extracted from a sea bottom drill core on one of his cruises, was also named in his honor. He was a Guggenheim Fellow and Fellow of the American Geophysical Union and the Geological Society of America. Son of William and Gertrude Hayes. He is survived by his wife, the former Leslie Eve Price; a sister, Pat Hart; three daughters, Jennifer Gregory, Elizabeth Elliott, Katherine Hayes; and step-daughter Elan Price Barish; and nine grandchildren. Dennis was a Renaissance man. He could build anything, fix anything, cook anything. Handsome, athletic, cool, modest, fair, kind, a good and understanding listener, a dry wit. A great role model loved and admired by friends and family. A framed 1756 quote hung in his office: ""To be sure, I lose the fruits of the earth, But then I am gathering the flowers of the sea."" 1/3"

2015-08-23T00:00:00Z,"BINGHAM--W. Richard ""Dick."" Died peacefully at his cherished home in Fishers Island, NY on August 18th surrounded by his loving family. The loss is felt for this family man who was a lifetime keen intellect, Navy Veteran, respected financier, philanthropist, civic affairs strategist, competitor and avid sportsman. He was foremost a loving husband and father dedicated to his extended family and friends and having as he called it ""the fortunate opportunity to experience a lifetime of participation in problem solving and creation of new entities."" Dick was born in New York City and grew up in Bucks County, PA and Hillsborough, CA. He attended Hillsborough School, Town School for Boys (Class of '49), Middlesex (Class of '53), Stanford University (Class of '57), and Harvard Business School (Class of '61). He attended the Universities of Geneva and Paris. Throughout every stage of his life he held a myriad of leadership positions beginning at Stanford where he was President of Phi Delta Theta Fraternity, and head of campus security. He served as Line Officer aboard the U.S. Navy destroyer, U.S.S. Davis, from 1957-1959. He remembered his naval service fondly which contributed to his unwavering love of the ocean. Dick was characterized by and often closed remarks on occasion with this line taken from his US Navy days, ""May fair winds and following seas accompany you."" Following his military service, Dick began his career on Wall Street at the investment banking firm of Kuhn, Loeb, and Co. in 1961. As a partner, Director of Investment Banking, a member of the Executive Committee and Board of Directors, he advised many companies and countries on capital raising activities. He continued his career as a partner of Lehman Brothers in 1977 where he was Director of Investment Banking, Corporate Finance, and Mergers and Acquisitions and a member of the Board. In 1988 he founded American Industrial Partners (AIP) which became a respected, ground-breaking private equity firm. As a savvy investor and President of AIP, Dick and his American Industrial Partners team raised four funds and led multiple investments in diverse industrial companies while he served on a number of corporate boards. In 1996, during Mayor Frank Jordan's administration in San Francisco, Dick was appointed Honorary Consul to the Republic of Lithuania. Also, during that time, he was appointed to the newly formed San Francisco's Committee on Jobs where the primary focus was to promote a business climate that allowed San Francisco to remain a desirable place to live, work, and operate a business. Throughout his life, Dick was dedicated to philanthropy and offered his services and support to many Bay Area institutions over the years. His philanthropic interests reflected his love of the wonders of the world, nature, the ocean, music, and the arts. His most memorable philanthropic lifetime achievement was the California Academy of Sciences located in Golden Gate Park, San Francisco. He served as Chairman of its Board from 1996 until it's reopening in 2007. He was extremely proud of what he and the board accomplished, especially literally knocking on doors to aid in the passing of Proposition B, which was pivotal in the process to completely rebuild the Academy into the world-class science and educational institution that it is today. As an adjunct to the Academy, he envisioned and worked tirelessly to raise private monies needed to fund the Music Concourse Garage which lies between the Academy and de Young Museums. He served as Chairman of that board. He passionately believed that education and educational pursuits were important for individuals and society. To him, saving and rebuilding the Academy was the tangible apex of that passion. His efforts helped ensure the Academy remained in Golden Gate Park as a state-of- the-art learning center and museum. Dick also is past trustee of The Town School for Boys, Marin Country Day School, The Urban School, The Bay School, Middlesex School, The World Affairs Council, St Johns Church on Fisher's Island, and CPMC Foundation. He was a member of the Pacific Union Club, the Burlingame Country Club, The San Francisco Golf Club, and the Fisher's Island Club. Dick is survived by his loving wife, Wendy Wasson Bingham, adoring children, Lock, Frances, and Grace Bingham, and devoted sister Betsy Bingham Davis. In lieu of flowers, the family requests that donations be made in Dick's memory to the California Academy of Sciences, which was an important cause for Dick. 1"

2015-08-23T00:00:00Z,"GOODMAN--Arthur Herbert, born in Brooklyn, March 27th, 1940, passed away quietly on Saturday, August 15th, after a sudden final illness. Following a decade of bravely-fought disease, including organ transplant and multiple cancers, his last minutes transpired peacefully with his family surrounding him in a circle of love. Arthur showed his rare gift with numbers and logical reasoning from his earliest years, as when preparing the family taxes from the age of seven. His lively irreverence, his charisma, and his masterful organizational skills revealed themselves en suite when he expressed his disdain for his teacher at Flatbush Yeshiva a bit too colorfully, earning in consequence from the head Rabbi the role of book monitor for the school year, only to receive a special prize at year's end for best monitor in the Yeshiva's history, complete with a medal in a velvet-lined box. After attending University of Pennsylvania, Wharton undergrad where he concentrated on insurance, and then Harvard Law School, he began his iconoclastic career by quitting his white-glove law firm after a) learning that an original and creative argument on a case was both acknowledged and rejected as such and b) balking at having to climb to the far reaches of the library ladder to pull a Vermont casebook. From then on, he thrived as a sole practitioner and business owner, developing a unique expertise in estate planning, writing the briefest yet most airtight wills imaginable. He built a successful property- casualty insurance agency named after his father - a life-long true believer in and seller of life insurance for New York Life - Charles Goodman and Company. He also served faithfully through the decades as President of the FMA Group. Awesomely productive, for most of his career Arthur typically worked at lightning speed from dawn until late morning, taking afternoons and evenings off to attend to his home and family. (Of course, he never situated himself far from a telephone, even knowing the location of every pay phone in the county, and then some.) In another example of his uncanny efficiency and mathematical instincts, not to mention his aversion to exercise, Arthur enjoyed a quiet renown for his unusual game of tennis: by way of keen anticipation and perfect reading of the angles, he seemingly could return virtually any shot on the court without moving more than a few inches. All his life, Arthur challenged all those around him to think for themselves, and to truly think. He was a problem- solver extraordinaire, and could readily minimize the most arcane, complex ideas to simple, accessible terms. Everyone enjoyed his charming eccentricities, such as his playing chess virtually, board and pieces all in his mind, calling out his moves (much to the bemusement of his young nephew Michael, who had eagerly accepted his uncle's invitation to play, upon hearing Uncle Arthur announce ""Pawn to Rook four"" with no chess set in sight). Practical, compassionate, and innovative, he would minimize fees for those in need: by bartering his legal services, by giving careful instructions as to time - consuming work clients could accomplish themselves, charging them only for a quick review, and by other inventive means. His generosity was immense, its recipients legion; with it, he literally saved lives. In his heyday, he possessed a supreme confidence and flatly refused to abide social norms for convention's sake. Ever a jokester, Arthur played marvelous pranks, and included humor in everything from his saucy email address to cheeky covert messages in commissioned artwork. He had a tremendous sense of fun, and spent his best years making a joyful game of life with his beloved wife Lois. He nearly always had a twinkle in his eye, and, although uber-responsible, he never let life's demands interfere with life's delights. He inspired countless family members and friends with his light-hearted love of living. He is survived by his soulmate, wife, and best friend of nearly four decades, Lois; deeply loved daughters Monica and Gabrielle; adored daughter Susanne Mordoh, and sole and steady son Steven Rubenstein; dear younger sister Denise Levine and brother-in-law David; treasured daughters and sons-in-law Amy Rubenstein, Michele Turchiano, Jonathan Mordoh and Scott Higson; and cherished grandchildren Jake, Stephanie, Perri, and Alex. In keeping with his wishes, there will be no funeral, service, or shiva. A spirited celebration of his life will take place in the autumn. In lieu of flowers or donations, to honor Arthur, love deeply, give generously, laugh heartily, and and carpe the best out of every last diem. Arthur was a giant of a man in every way - mind, body, heart, and soul. Our sadness too is vast. But he has left us with an equally colossal legacy of love and laughter to compass our grief, and guide us abidingly through the years to come. 1/3"
2015-08-23T00:00:00Z,"HOFFMAN--John Brooks, M.D.,passed away on Thursday, June 11, 2015 about 1:50pm from cardiac arrest. Born in Rahway, New Jersey in 1918, son of John and Eva Brooks Hoffman. He attended Blair Academy and graduated in 1936. He attended Williams College from which he received a BA degree. He attended Columbia University, College of Physicians and Surgeons and graduated in 1943 with a M.D. degree. Then he went on active duty in the U.S. Army Medical Corp and was discharged as a Captain. In December 1942, during a black out in New York City (it was wartime), he ran into Jane Helwig, a student nurse at Presbyterian Hospital and two and one-half years later, they were married on June 14th, Flag Day, in 1945. He is survived by five children: Nancy L. of Seattle, WA; Susan J. of Malvern, PA; Deborah A. of Villanova, PA; J. Brooks, Jr. of West Barnstable, MA; and Peter K. of Fairfield, CT, seven grandchildren, and eight great-grandchildren. He came to Greenwich in 1950, where he opened his office to practice his specialty. He was the first doctor in Greenwich with American boards in his specialty. He eventually became Chairman of the Department of OB/GYN in Greenwich Hospital. He retired in 1985. In 1991, he was awarded the Distinguished Citizen Award by the Greenwich Boy Scouts. He was Co-chairman of the ""Greenwich 350 Celebration"", a year-long party in 1990, to celebrate the Town's 350th year. His father had been a collector of autographs and old documents. From him, Brooks grew to be a collector of Early Americana of some note; his collection of presidential autographs (while they were in office). He gave over 300 articles of Early Americana to the Chapin Library at Williams, and helped with the purchase of the Declaration of Independence and also donated the first British answer to the Declaration. Blair Academy was also given many valuable pieces of Americana. His long period of 67 years to Blair Academy will be remembered by all who had any association with Blair. He was a Trustee for over 45 years, during which he served as Chairman of the Board for 16 years and 10 years as Chairman of the Executive Committee. In 1993, the school awarded him a Citation of Merit and an Emeritus position on Staff. In honor of his wife, he established a scholarship at the Columbia University School of Nursing. He used to say that he played a significant role in the delivery of over 3500 babies. (He did not deliver the babies, the mothers did that!) He also did over 2500 surgical procedures in his career, and finally he loved to say that he tried to play a supporting role in the raising of five children with Jane. Service will be held in the First Presbyterian Church of Greenwich, at 11:00am Saturday, September 12, 2015.

Son of Josephine R. and Elliott Debevoise, Debevoise was born on April 23, 1924, in Orange, New Jersey. He was predeceased by his wife of 64 years, Katrina Leeb Debevoise, and by two younger brothers, Elliott Debevoise, Jr., and Peter Huntington Debevoise. He attended the South Orange public schools and Deerfield Academy, and graduated from Williams College in 1948 and from Columbia Law School, where he served on the Law Review. Debevoise served in the 294th Combat Engineer Battalion in World War II. On June 7, 1944, during the Normandy landings, the Battalion's transport ship, the Susan B. Anthony, was sunk off Utah Beach. The soldiers climbed into other vessels and then into landing craft before proceeding to the beach. Debevoise served as squad leader with the rank of sergeant in the Battalion's campaigns in Normandy, central France, the Hurtgen Forest on the German frontier, and the Battle of the Bulge, returning to Germany for the War's concluding campaign and, after VE Day, joining the occupation forces in Berlin. He was awarded the Bronze Star Medal. In February of 1951, the most important event of Debevoise's life took place - his marriage to Katrina S. Leeb. In April of that year, he was recalled into the Army, and served during the Korean War as a first lieutenant in the Army Security Agency. He and his wife Trina spent the first year of their marriage living in Army posts in Camp Pickett, VA, and Fort Devens, MA. Between 1952 and 1953, Debevoise served as law clerk to Chief Judge Phillip Forman of New Jersey's United States District Court. In 1953, he became associated with the Newark law firm of Riker, Emery & Danzig (now Riker, Danzig, Scherer, Hyland, & Perretti), becoming a partner in 1957. For 26 years he engaged in a general practice that included commercial and corporate law and state and federal litigation. During this period, he was actively involved in the civil rights movement. In 1964, as Chairman of the Essex County, NJ Bar Association Civil Rights Committee and as part of the Lawyers Constitutional Defense Committee, Debevoise recruited other New Jersey lawyers to join him representing civil rights workers in Mississippi participating in the Mississippi Freedom Summer. Following this, he oversaw the formation of the Newark Legal Services Project, of which he served as President for the next five years. He continued his efforts to combat endemic urban poverty and racial injustice through his work with The Fund for New Jersey (as Trustee) and the New Jersey Institute for Social Justice (as Director and Vice President). Additional public service included chairing the New Jersey Clients' Security Fund and the Governor's Workmen's Compensation Study Committee, the New Jersey Supreme Court's Disciplinary Review Board, and the Lawyers Advisory Committee of the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit. He dedicated nearly 23 years to the Hospital Center of Orange, New Jersey, serving as General Counsel, Trustee and Vice President. On the education front, he served as Trustee of Williams College from 1969-1974, during a pivotal time in the College's history when it transformed itself from a fraternity-based institution to a non- fraternal residential college, and was a founding Trustee of Ramapo College of New Jersey and Chair of its Board of Trustees from 1971-1974. He served as Adjunct Professor of Constitutional Law at Seton Hall Law School between 1991 and 1994. In 1979, President Jimmy Carter appointed Debevoise a District Court Judge for the District of New Jersey, in which position he served until his death. There he handled a wide variety of civil and criminal cases, ranging from complex securities matters to civil rights matters. Among his notable cases were the 1996 arraignment of Unabomber Ted Kaczynski; the 1985 collapse of the financial firm Bevill, Bresler & Schulman, in which he authored a landmark decision addressing the rights of investors in securities repurchase agreements, or ""repos,"" and his 1983 ruling declaring New Jersey's ""moment of silence"" law an unconstitutional attempt to circumvent the U.S. Supreme Court's ban on state-sanctioned prayer in public schools. Extending his initial 15 years of judicial service with an extraordinary 21 years as a senior status judge, Debevoise earned a nationwide reputation as a consummate jurist, deeply respected by members of the bench and bar alike for his intellect, fairness, and passionate commitment to justice. ebevoise spent summers throughout his life on the shores of Casco Bay, at Mere Point, Maine, a summer haven for him and his wife Trina, their children and grandchildren. There, he pursued his lifelong passions of sailing and rowing. In 1980, he furthered his efforts to preserve unspoiled land on the Maine coast by donating a conservation easement of half of 90-acre Upper Goose Island in Casco Bay to the Nature Conservancy of Maine. Debevoise is survived by four daughters, Kate S. Debevoise of Yarmouth, Maine, Josephine (Josie) D. Davies of New Canaan, CT, Mary (Molly) D. Rennie of Short Hills, NJ, and Abigail (Abby) D. Boozan, of Short Hills, NJ. In addition, he is survived by Josie's husband, Ralph Davies and Abby's husband, Dr. John Boozan, and by seven grandchildren - Ralph N. Davies, Jr., Heidi L.

“Shake your eggs high! Shake your eggs low!” Sound familiar? You’ve been to those neighborhood classes that introduce many toddlers (and parents) to music — and organized learning.

As the others rock out with their bearded teacher, one little guy needs time. By the end of this friendly, stylishly illustrated rhyme-fest, he’s got the beat and hates to say goodbye."

2015-08-23T00:00:00Z,"ARONSON--Barbara Smith. September 8, 1925 - August 17, 2015. The family and friends of this extraordinary woman wish to acknowledge her relentless pursuit of life. Barbara's enduring interests in the Arts and her unceasing quest for knowledge were the lifelong hallmarks of her intellect and passion to learn ""why"". Born to Ruth and Casper Smith of Lynbrook, NY, Barbara and her brother Eugene were introduced to music, art, and the theater, as well as the wonders of an interdenominational spiritual world. Barbara was trained as a classical pianist, and played and sang on RKO Radio shows while still in high school. She attended Oberlin College, while matriculating at Barnard College. In 1946, she was one of very few women to receive a Master's Degree (in History) from Columbia University. After a brief marriage to Robin Mahaney, she married Howard Greenwald, a business man, with whom she had three sons, Alan, David, and Donald. Divorcing in 1965, she met and married the love of her life, Herbert Aronson, a prominent lawyer, CPA, and one time mayoral candidate from Mt. Vernon, NY. For the next 50 years, she resided in Chappaqua, NY where, after the death of her husband in 1982, dedicated herself to community service including local thrift and book stores and the Northern Westchester Hospital. She was also an active member of the Unitarian Universalist Fellowship of Northern Westchester. She loved the Fellowship, with its' interest in discussing the ""big questions"" of life. Always an apt student, rumor had it she did quite well in the weekly Humor class, too. In addition to her immediate family, which includes grandchildren Jesse, Alexandra, Cathryn, Olivia, James, Tess, and Grace, and daughters-in-law Susan (Adlin) Greenwald and Catherine Swift, Barbara attracted and maintained a diverse group of loyal friends throughout her remaining years. These friends, from all walks of life, and of all ages, were attracted to her innate kindness, thoughtfulness, and intellectual vigor and inquisitiveness. She was an exemplar of traditional values, and the ""eternal verities of life"". And she will be missed. A celebration of her life and times will be held at the Unitarian Universalist Fellowship of Northern Westchester, 236 S. Bedford Road, Mt Kisco, NY, on Sunday October 4th at 12:30pm. In lieu of flowers, please hug a loved one today. 1/3"

Essie was a radiant spirit; a bright flame whose agile mind and irrepressible wit enchanted all who knew her. Essie's encompassing interest in politics, literature, and world events was undiminished even in the last moments of her life. Her love for her children was more than love; it was a pure joy that bathed us in its special warmth. She was born on the Lower East Side of New York in 1925, where her father, the esteemed Rabbi Benjamin Fleischer, presided over congregation Beth Hamedrash Hagodol. After a brief stint studying at the Martha Graham School for dance, Essie attended Brooklyn College and then received her Master's degree in early childhood education. In 1950, she married Israel (Hal) Foster, a union that lasted 64 years. Essie and Hal were devoted to raising their five children. The untimely death in 2003 of their youngest son, Rafe, and in 2012 of their eldest born, Michael, changed their lives forever and weakened them both physically and emotionally. Essie spent the last five years lovingly tended in the home of her daughter Tamar and was predeceased in November by her husband. She is survived by her bereft daughters, Stacy, Tamar, and Jody, her sister, Judith Yockel, and her eight grandchildren.

2015-08-25T00:00:00Z,"EVERT--James. one of the greatest American tennis teaching professionals of all time--passed away peacefully in Fort Lauderdale, Friday, August 21, 2015. Evert, 91, was surrounded by his loving family. The son of Charles John and Christine Marie Grotz Evert, he was born September 9, 1923 in Chicago, Illinois. He was an All-American player for Notre Dame in the 1940s. In 1947, he won the Canadian Championships. He earned a No. 11 ranking in the U.S. But it was as a teaching professional of the highest order that he built his lofty reputation. In that arena, he was unsurpassed. Evert moved from Chicago to Florida with his wife, Colette, in 1948. For 49 years, he was the city of Fort Lauderdale's tennis director. He became a fixture at Holiday Park--fittingly renamed the Jimmy Evert Tennis Center in 1997--where he taught a wide range of top flight junior players. He was most proud of the fact that all five of his children reached at least the final of a national junior championship in the United States. His renowned daughter, Chris Evert, became one of the best women players in history, securing 18 Grand Slam singles titles, winning at least one major title for 13 consecutive years (1974-86), and finishing seven seasons as the No. 1 ranked woman in the world. The work he did at Holiday Park was extraordinary. Not only did he coach and groom all of his kids as players, but he worked with other standouts across the years including world No. 1 Jennifer Capriati and two highly ranked players who both resided in the world's top ten--Brian Gottfried and Harold Solomon. All of those players came under guidance, as did 1963 U.S. Championships finalist Frank Froehling. The way he raised his kids and shaped them as tennis players and people was exemplary. As Chris Evert once said, ""He would not criticize me ever for losing a match. I always tried to win for him. In a nutshell, my Dad created the ideal environment for me to compete. He gave me the space I needed and in his own quiet way brought out the best in me by not asking me to be more than myself. As great as he was as a coach he was even greater as a father. He worked hard as a father, too, and read to us and sang to us and took us swimming and took care of all five kids with my mother. He took us to church and was an unbelievably active parent, so active that he took all of his kids with him to work so the family could be together and he could keep an eye on us."" Evert was admired immensely for his understated manner and humility. As Bud Collins said, ""Jimmy Evert invented tennis in Florida. He loved tennis and you gave a gift to tennis in Fort Lauderdale. He showed all five of his children and his many students how to love tennis and how to live a life."" Chris Evert asked him once why he started all of his kids playing tennis. I thought he might give me a glamorous answer like 'My goal for you is to be No. 1 in the world' but he said, 'I started all of you playing so I could keep the family together.' As a man he was exposed to fame, wealth and success but he remained unaffected and untouched. Once a Japanese tennis promoter walked into our house with $25,000 in cash when I was a young player. He wanted me to play a one night exhibition in Japan. My Dad told him to close the briefcase and please leave our house. That was my Dad. He was the most moral, ethical, dignified person I ever knew. He is survived by his beloved wife of 62 years, Colette, son Drew (Penny) Evert, of Delray Beach, FL; daughter Chris Evert, of Boca Raton, FL; daughter Jeanne Dubin of Delray Beach, FL; son John (Mary) Evert of Boca Raton, FL; daughter Clare (Steven) Evert-Shane of Aspen, CO; and his 10 grandchildren: Anna Evert- DeHoag, Lauren Evert- Crawford, Eric Dubin, Catherine Aspenwall, Alex Mill, Nicky Mill, Colton Mill, Siena Evert, Tatum Shane and Remi Shane; and three great- grandchildren, Andrew, Lillian and Hailey; his brother, Gerald Evert and wife Audra, of Little Rock, Arkansas, sister-in-law Ruth Evert of Columbus, Georgia. He was predeceased by two brothers, John Evert and Charles Evert and a son-in-law, Brahm Dubin. In lieu of flowers, friends of the Evert family are asked to donate to the Jimmy Evert Scholarship Fund, which will honor Mr. Evert's legacy of enriching children's lives through the sport of tennis. Funds will go to provide private lessons and educational enhancement for underserved and at-risk children throughout the U.S. Checks can be made payable to the USTA Foundation - Jimmy Evert Fund and sent to 70 West Red Oak Lane, White Plains, NY 10604.

2015-08-26T00:00:00Z,"BINGHAM--W. Richard ""Dick."" Died peacefully at his cherished home in Fishers Island, NY on August 18th surrounded by his loving family. The loss is felt for this family man who was a lifetime keen intellect, Navy Veteran, respected financier, philanthropist, civic affairs strategist, competitor and avid sportsman. He was foremost a loving husband and father dedicated to his extended family and friends and having as he called it ""the fortunate opportunity to experience a lifetime of participation in problem solving and creation of new entities."" Dick was born in New York City and grew up in Bucks County, PA and Hillsborough, CA. He attended Hillsborough School, Town School for Boys (Class of '49), Middlesex (Class of '53), Stanford University (Class of '57), and Harvard Business School (Class of '61). He attended the Universities of Geneva and Paris. Throughout every stage of his life he held a myriad of leadership positions beginning at Stanford where he was President of Phi Delta Theta Fraternity, and head of campus security. He served as Line Officer aboard the U.S. Navy destroyer, U.S.S. Davis, from 1957-1959. He remembered his naval service fondly which contributed to his unwavering love of the ocean. Dick was characterized by and often closed remarks on occasion with this line taken from his US Navy days, ""May fair winds and following seas accompany you."" Following his military service, Dick began his career on Wall Street at the investment banking firm of Kuhn, Loeb, and Co. in 1961. As a partner, Director of Investment Banking, a member of the Executive Committee and Board of Directors, he advised many companies and countries on capital raising activities. He continued his career as a partner of Lehman Brothers in 1977 where he was Director of Investment Banking, Corporate Finance, and Mergers and Acquisitions and a member of the Board. In 1988 he founded American Industrial Partners (AIP) which became a respected, ground-breaking private equity firm. As a savvy investor and President of AIP, Dick and his American Industrial Partners team raised four funds and led multiple investments in diverse industrial companies while he served on a number of corporate boards. In 1996, during Mayor Frank Jordan's administration in San Francisco, Dick was appointed Honorary Consul to the Republic of Lithuania. Also, during that time, he was appointed to the newly formed San Francisco's Committee on Jobs where the primary focus was to promote a business climate that allowed San Francisco to remain a desirable place to live, work, and operate a business. Throughout his life, Dick was dedicated to philanthropy and offered his services and support to many Bay Area institutions over the years. His philanthropic interests reflected his love of the wonders of the world, nature, the ocean, music, and the arts. His most memorable philanthropic lifetime achievement was the California Academy of Sciences located in Golden Gate Park, San Francisco. He served as Chairman of its Board from 1996 until it's reopening in 2007. He was extremely proud of what he and the board accomplished, especially literally knocking on doors to aid in the passing of Proposition B, which was pivotal in the process to completely rebuild the Academy into the world-class science and educational institution that it is today. As an adjunct to the Academy, he envisioned and worked tirelessly to raise private monies needed to fund the Music Concourse Garage which lies between the Academy and de Young Museums. He served as Chairman of that board. He passionately believed that education and educational pursuits were important for individuals and society. To him, saving and rebuilding the Academy was the tangible apex of that passion. His efforts helped ensure the Academy remained in Golden Gate Park as a state-of- the-art learning center and museum. Dick also is past trustee of The Town School for Boys, Marin Country Day School, The Urban School, The Bay School, Middlesex School, The World Affairs Council, St Johns Church on Fisher's Island, and CPMC Foundation. He was a member of the Pacific Union Club, the Burlingame Country Club, The San Francisco Golf Club, and the Fisher's Island Club. Dick is survived by his loving wife, Wendy Wasson Bingham, adoring children, Lock, Frances, and Grace Bingham, and devoted sister Betsy Bingham Davis. In lieu of flowers, the family requests that donations be made in Dick's memory to the California Academy of Sciences, which was an important cause for Dick. 1"

2015-08-27T00:00:00Z,"TOWNSEND--Peter Wesley, 1948-2015, of Belgrade, Maine. Formerly of New York City. A woodsman in the city, Peter was a stay-at-home dad, Architect, builder, chef (he would say cook), traveler, hiker, and lover. He taught us how to love and be loved. While starting Una Architectural Studios, he resurrected homes including our little brick building (with rooftop jungle) at One White Street. He raised us as he learned to cook from our neighbors: Chanterelle, Duane Park Patisserie, and Franklin Station Cafe. He was always on the other side of the counter at 3pm when Lucca and Nina would come home from school with friends in tow. There were many half-days in Hoboken, birthdays in Coney Island, bike rides over bridges, trips to Di Palo's, and breakfasts at Socrates after judo with Sensei Oishi. Every summer we traveled from NYC to Maine, where he taught us to camp, kayak, build fires. While the family was decidedly urban, Messalonskee Lake also seemed like home. He was at home anywhere--small towns in Italy, the Adirondacks and the Pine Barrens, atop Tumbledown or Borestone. Countless people and places held his heart. In Italy, he instantly wove himself into the fabric of communities. Speaking Italian, he charmed locals with his adoration for their lands and foods. The woodsman trekked through the jungle, climbed the base of a glacier and prepared freshly caught trout with soon-to-be family in Ecuador. After 30 years in New York City, he created our true home on Messalonskee Lake. Every morning he would go for his swim, finding turtles, saying hello to neighbors. This week he went for a swim and didn't come back. He passed away quickly of a heart attack doing what he loved in a treasured place. He left behind a world of love, people, spaces, and lake creatures. Known far and wide for his pie, pesto, and potato salad, Peter will always feed our hearts. He's there for every bite. He is in every mountain, lake, turtle, loon call, every perfectly located iron hook and desk and light and window, every bike ride, every paddle, everywhere. We will miss him. A celebration will be held Saturday August 29th from 1-3pm at the Maine Lakes Resource Center in Belgrade Lakes. All are welcome. 1/3"

Stroud, she was raised in Philadelphia and graduated from the Chatham Hall School in Virginia and the University of Pennsylvania. Enormously energetic, creative, generous, and tirelessly hard-working and driven, Stroud was multi- facetted, as esteemed as a leading professional and patron in contemporary art as well as for owning National Open Championship Retrievers and several times her Labradors, which she greatly loved, were the high-winning competition dogs in the United States. In 1977, after serving as Artistic Director of the Philadelphia inner-city educational Prints in Progress program, she founded and remained artistic director of The Fabric Workshop and Museum (FWM) in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania until her death. The Fabric Workshop - and latter its Museum of its holdings and major exhibition spaces and program - began as an experimental cloth print shop hosting two-week artist residencies. It has evolved into an international, non-profit center for the commissioned production of major projects with artists including Marina Abramovic, Anne Hamilton, Joan Jonas, William Kentridge, Lorna Simpson, Sarah Sze, Richard Tuttle, and Bill Viola. Stroud curated numerous exhibitions there and wrote for and edited numerous FWM publications, including the award winning New Material as New Media: The Fabric Workshop and Museum, Doug Aiken A-Z Book (Fractals), Comfort Zone, Lee Bul: Live Forever II, Jorge Pardo, Material Pleasures/The Fabric Workshop at The Institute of Contemporary Art, Philadelphia, A Decade of Pattern, and An Industrious Art and Cai Guo- Qiang: Fallen Blossoms (2010), winner of the International Association of Art Critics award for Best Project in a Public.

It has hosted hundreds of guests and their families. Stroud served as a long-time trustee of the Philadelphia Museum of Art and was Chair of its Prints, Drawings, and Photographs Committee, and a member of its 20th Century Art and African American Art Committees. She was a member of the International Council of the Museum of Modern Art, Art Table, and the American Crafts Council and was a panelist and reviewer for the National Endowment of the Arts and for the Pennsylvania Council on the Arts. She was awarded Maine's Skowhegan Governor's Award for outstanding service to art and artists. Stroud lived in Philadelphia, Palm Beach, Florida, and on Mount Desert Island. She is survived by a large and devoted family of Rosengarten, Sims, and Stroud cousins and a multitude of friends across the US and around the world.

An unforgettable character, her joyful enthusiasm was contagious. Aurora loved to celebrate life's big occasions. A superb chef, she cooked gourmet meals for family and friends.

Respected by his colleagues and beloved by his patients, Dr. Burrows performed The Mount Sinai Hospital's first successful kidney transplant in 1967, and was a seminal figure in the creation of Mount Sinai's transplant service. Among Dr. Burrows' many contributions to the medical field was his work in creating a noninvasive technique known as functional imaging, using radioactive tracers to measure kidney blood flow and function. He also hypothesized that perioperative blood transfusions would reduce immunity and lead to an increased recurrence in colorectal cancer--a theory that was later confirmed in several studies and expanded to other malignancies.

The Board of Trustees, Artist Advisory Committee and Staff of the Fabric Workshop and Museum (FWM) deeply mourn the loss of our visionary founder, leader and long-time friend, Marion (Kippy) Boulton Stroud. A supporter of the arts and artists, curator, author and arts administrator, Kippy pioneered the practice of direct support to artists through her unique residency program at the Fabric Workshop and Museum, founded in Philadelphia in 1977. Her deep and abiding encouragement of artists to advance the boundaries of their practice by offering them opportunities to experiment in a vast range of media resulted in the FWM long record of groundbreaking residencies and exhibitions and the Museum's important collection of 20th and 21st century art. The unique works of art created at FWM are shown with regularity throughout the United States and the world in major museums and cultural venues. Kippy was deeply and passionately devoted to artists and the artistic community and provided her unstinting support. She believed in the power of experimentation and creativity and fostered access to arts for everyone. Kippy broke down barriers--within social structures and within the process of art making. We extend our deepest sympathy to Kippy's family of cousins-- Rosengartens, Sims and Strouds--and to her extended family of artists and arts professionals who have been so deeply inspired by her generous and giving spirit.

A graduate of Bay Ridge High School in Brooklyn and of Hunter College (New York City), for ten years she was Reserve Director of Bozell & Jacobs Inc. (now Bozell Worldwide). Throughout the 1940s and 1950s, she had numerous articles and poems published in American and Canadian magazines. In recent years she published ""Loving Language: A Child Embraces Her Life Through Words"" and ""Gestalt Graphology,"" a collection of papers by her late second husband, Felix Klein. In 1962 her marriage to Ralph Bottenus resulted in the birth of her daughter, Valerie H. Q. Bottenus, who was the light of her life. Four years after Ralph's death she married Felix Klein, a world renowned Austrian-born gestalt graphologist and founder of the National Society for Graphology. Janice studied and worked with him in his business, Manhattan Handwriting Consultant, which she carried on after his death in 1994. She was an encouraging and patient teacher who brought out the very best in her students. She later sold the business to a former student, Evy Tishelman Karambelas, who operates it under the name Felix Klein School of Graphology. Janice was herself the light of many people's lives. Her ebullient and generous spirit, her keen mind and razor-sharp intellect, and her love for and appreciation of beauty (and her desire to share it with others) made Janice an unforgettable presence. She cultivated and maintained legions of close friendships, many of which had begun in her youth and others in her senior years. A devoted correspondent, she was known for her newsy and beautifully handwritten letters and envelopes decorated with colorful stickers. She loved traveling and was particularly smitten with Venice; Janice was made an honorary member of one of her favorite organizations, Save Venice, when she was nearly 90. Her absence will leave an enormous hole in many hearts, but most of all, in the heart of her daughter Valerie, who adored her precious Buddha infinitely and will love her eternally. In addition to Valerie, she is survived by three stepsons (Thomas, of Portland, OR; Howard, of York, PA; and Peter, of Clifton, NJ) and three nieces (Dianne Ginsburg, of River Falls, WI; Jeannie Seitz, of Collins, IA; and Marjorie Vickery, of Sun City, AZ). A private wake will be held at 10am on Saturday, August 29th, at Coxe and Graziano Funeral Home in Mamaroneck, NY, followed by interment at Greenwood Union Cemetery in Rye, NY. A memorial service for Janice will be held in Manhattan on Saturday, September 12th. 1/3"

He was an exceptional athlete and was especially accomplished in tennis. He and his wife, during their long and loving marriage, together traveled to 60 countries.

The Board of Trustees, Artist Advisory Committee and Staff of the Fabric Workshop and Museum (FWM) deeply mourn the loss of our visionary founder, leader and long-time friend, Marion (Kippy) Boulton Stroud. A supporter of the arts and artists, curator, author and arts administrator, Kippy pioneered the practice of direct support to artists through her unique residency program at the Fabric Workshop and Museum, founded in Philadelphia in 1977. Her deep and abiding encouragement of artists to advance the boundaries of their practice by offering them opportunities to experiment in a vast range of media resulted in the FWM long record of groundbreaking residencies and exhibitions and the Museum's important collection of 20th and 21st century art. The unique works of art created at FWM are shown with regularity throughout the United States and the world in major museums and cultural venues. Kippy was deeply and passionately devoted to artists and the artistic community and provided her unstinting support. She believed in the power of experimentation and creativity and fostered access to arts for everyone. Kippy broke down barriers--within social structures and within the process of art making. We extend our deepest sympathy to Kippy's family of cousins-- Rosengartens, Sims and Strouds--and to her extended family of artists and arts professionals who have been so deeply inspired by her generous and giving spirit.

2015-08-30T00:00:00Z,"JENNINGS--Richard. Richard Townsley Jennings, a remarkable and beloved man, died unexpectedly from complications due to a medical procedure on August 13. Born in New York City in 1933, he grew up in a close-knit, hard-working family. His mother, Cora and father, Alfred, were intelligent people of character who raised two sons, Richard and his older brother, Donald, and their niece, Virginia, raised as Richard's sister. By the time he was 15-years-old, he lost both his brother and father, and went on two years later, to put himself through college at Columbia University where he majored in music and business. He was the first in his family to attend college. A fine and gifted pianist, upon graduating from Columbia, Richard was a soldier in the Korean War where he entertained the troops. This ability to reduce the suffering of others, and to offer the music he so loved, brought him much joy. When he returned, he tried with his characteristic steady determination to become a professional jazz pianist and composer, and made one record called, ""He Loves Me."" Shortly thereafter, he met Regina, a young Peruvian beauty and fellow lover of music and literature. A person of unshakeable character, Richard began writing jingles to provide for his bride and their beloved son, Christopher, born shortly after they married in New York City. He went on to have a 40- year distinguished career as an advertising executive, where he implemented the ""Bob, for Texaco, Hope"" commercials, wrapping up at Saatchi & Saatchi. He was a first class Ad man with the temperament of a gentle and gifted introvert. When it came to being a parent, Richard was ahead of his time. In addition to providing for his family's basic needs, he thoroughly enjoyed cooking for them, reading to his kids, singing with them and helping them get ready for school. He spent countless hours teaching his son what it meant to be an honorable man, how to work diligently to achieve goals, how to care for others even and especially when great sacrifice was required, and loved spending time with him going to see every New York sports team, then briskly walking to Grand Central Station, sometimes whistling to a favorite Frank Sinatra tune on the way home. His daughter Pilar, born four years after Christopher, quickly developed a boundless love for him. They were the shy, bookish ones in the family, with a shared and passionate love of learning. Throughout her childhood, she watched him with awe as he finished The New York Times crossword puzzle in the time it took her to tie her shoes. He often complained, with his marvelously dry sense of humor, that the puzzle was too easy that day, then affectionately tap her on the head with the rolled up paper. When she learned the word ""erudite,"" she realized that it was the perfect way to describe her father, a history buff, politico, and lover of the written word. It is with immense sadness, endless gratitude and love, that we say goodbye. Richard was a profoundly devoted father, grandfather to Carley, Samantha, and Mattie, a caring friend, a person of true character, intellect, culture, and consummate joyful foodie. A truly good and loving man. In lieu of flowers, please send donations to support students who are first in their family to attend college at Columbia University's School of General Studies.

We have lost not only a great neurologist and humanitarian, but also a consummate botanist and active Board Member. Oliver was mentored as a young man by Prof. Dr. Marie Stopes, the leading British botanist, and therein began his long interest in cycads and ferns. Oliver made regular Wednesday trips to the Garden.

Oliver was one of the most active members of the American Fern Society. His appreciation of the plant world is demonstrated in Awakenings, in which he describes bringing his patients to the Garden not just as a therapeutic exercise but also as an experience in serenity and awareness. In 2011 Oliver was awarded the Gold Medal, the Garden's highest honor, which is presented to individuals who have made significant contributions to the life of the Garden and the advancement of plant research and conservation.

His grandfather, Judge Leroy Denman, was an Associate Justice of the Supreme Court of Texas and founded the prestigious law firm of Denman, Franklin and Denman in 1899. Leroy Denman, Jr.'s respect for the Rule of Law came early. Educated at the University of Texas for both his undergraduate and law degrees, he was a member and President of the Sigma Chi Fraternity, the Chancellors Honorary and the Phi Delta Phi Law Fraternity. Last year, he celebrated as a member of the State Bar of Texas for 75 years. In 1985, the Leroy G.

While pursuing his education, Denman studied in Spain at the Complutense University of Madrid, the National Antonino's University of Mexico City, Mexico, and the Sorbonne in Paris, France. Following his graduation, he was recruited by the War Department to serve as an Assistant in Economic Matters at the American Embassy in Guatemala City, Guatemala and later in Buenos Aires, Argentina from March, 1942 to September, 1946. He then returned to the United States to serve in the Advocate General's office of the United States Army, Washington, D.C.

He loved with great passion all of God's blessings - the land for its ranching abundance, the sea for his beloved sailboat, Aquarius II and the skies above where he flew his Cessna planes for 600,000 miles over 67 years of flying. . Public service was an important part of his highly dynamic life. He was the attorney and advisor for the King Ranch for over 50 years and its first non-Member President. He is Trustee Emeritus of the Caesar Kleberg Foundation for Wildlife Conservation, the Tobin Foundation, the Nordan Trust, the George W. Brackenridge Foundation, the Ewing Halsell Foundation, and the Texas Bio Medical Research Institute.

He was 84 years old. He was born September 3, 1930 and was raised in Baltimore, Maryland. Heavily recruited to play football by several of the top college programs in the country, Tom chose The University of Virginia. Although football was where Tom found his true calling, he earned 10 varsity letters in the sports he participated in, including first team All American honors in Football and Lacrosse, a first for any student athlete at UVA. He played in the East West Shrine and College All- Star games. He was voted the best All-Around Athlete in the history of UVA. The University retired Tom's football jersey, number 65, in 2007 in honor of his achievements on and off the field. After graduating from college, Tom joined the National Football League. He played six seasons as linebacker for the Philadelphia Eagles, and was named the NFL Rookie of The Year in his first season. In 1959, he went on to the New York Giants and played during an era now described as the Giants' Golden Years. The team competed in NFL Championship games in 1959, 1961, 1962, and 1963. During these years, Tom was named All-Pro in seven of his 12 seasons with the NFL. At the close of the 1964 season Tom retired as a player, and became assistant defensive coach for the Giants. Tom is preceded in death by his first wife Joan Davis Scott, and son Thomas C. Scott III. He is survived by his wife of 45 years, Linda Scott; daughter- in-law Susan Scott of Cranford, NJ; son David Scott of Deep River, CT; daughter Sandra and husband Leslie Dale of New Canaan, CT; son Michael and wife Alison Scott of Charlotte, NC; and daughter Patricia Scott of Rowayton, CT.

2015-09-06T00:00:00Z,"ALLEY--James Burke Jr.,a Cowboy and a Gentleman, Dies at 79. A 50-year resident of Santa Fe, New Mexico, died peacefully Wednesday at Christus St. Vincent Hospital due to congestive heart failure. He was the son of James Burke Alley and Esther Hall Alley of Oyster Bay, New York. His father worked for President Franklin D. Roosevelt as the lead counsel for the Reconstruction Finance Corporation which played a major role in overcoming the Great Depression in the United States. Jim's mother insisted on a first rate education that began at Green Vale School and continued at Phillips Exeter Academy, Harvard College and the University of Virginia School of Law. Jim loved sports and seemed to be good at all of them: wrestling, playing football and captaining the lacrosse team at Exeter. In later years he enjoyed skiing at Taos, fishing at Crystal Brook and playing squash at the Kiva Club with friends like Bud Kelly and Walter Burke. He was a quick study at both polo and cowboy polo, the latter of which resulted in the 1975 national championship as a member of the Santa Fe Sheriff's Posse. Together with Abel Davis, Jim Ritchie and Phil Naumberg, Jim founded the original Santa Fe Polo Grounds where they played polo during the summers of the 1980s. In the winters, Jim enjoyed skiing in Taos and knew where to find the apres ski martinis Ernie Blake had hidden in the trees. He was the sort of athlete who played to win, celebrated the touchdowns of others, and kept quiet about his own. He had a curious nature: he worked as a roustabout in the Oklahoma oil fields while in school, completed basic training in the U.S. Army in Texas after college, and then worked as a corporate lawyer at Debevoise and Plimpton in New York City, but he found his true calling as a lawyer in Santa Fe serving the interests of every constituency that came to him for help. He had served as a member of the New Mexico State Bar since 1965 and valued his partners of more than 30 years, Jim Rubin and Lenny Katz. He was strongly opposed to undesirable development and served on the board of the New Mexico Environmental Law Center. In the late 1960s, as the attorney for the Upper Pecos Association, he fought an initiative to put a paved 26-mile highway across Elk Mountain in his beloved Pecos Wilderness, and the case went all the way to the U.S. Supreme Court before the highway proposal was finally defeated. He served on several corporate boards, but he also invested time in education, and was a member of the board of trustees that saved the Santa Fe Prep School during challenging years. From 1961 to 1969, Jim was married to Helen C. Lamberton (Gates) with whom he had two children, Anne L. Alley and James B. Alley III. He married Maria Elisabeth Werner in 1971 at Songa Church in Sweden and they had one daughter, Kristina E. Alley, and in marriage he gained another son, Carl M. Kawaja. Elisabeth and all of his children were by his side as he died. Elisabeth was the love of his life, and he learned to speak Swedish (very poorly), drink Aquavit (quite well) and dance around a midsummer pole (happily). Jim liked to say about special people that God broke the mold after he made them. There was no mold for someone like Jim, he had the feel of someone built by hand. He had a love of manly things - hunting, cigars, football on TV, his beautiful Swedish wife, but he also had a sophisticated palate for food, travel and artful things. He had a soft heart. He cried at his wedding to Elisabeth and when he took his younger daughter to college. He was childish in the best way, putting spit balls in a straw at The Shed restaurant, firing them at strangers and blaming his grandchildren when accused. In his later years, Jim enjoyed horseback riding in the Pecos Wilderness he had helped to save, but most of all he savored traveling the lengths of the Lower and Upper Ausable Lakes in an Adirondack guide boat with his best friend, Nicholas A. Farrell, aged 11, his grandson. He was predeceased by his brother, Dr. Harrison H. Alley, and his sister, Jane J. Edgerton, and is survived by his sister, Cynthia A. Andrews, his wife Elisabeth, his children Kristina, James, Carl, and Anne and her husband John S. Ferrara, and Jim's grandchildren, Nicholas and Linnea, children of Kristina and her husband Timothy G. Farrell, and Catherine, Marcus and Noelle, children of Carl and his wife Gwendolyn N. Holcombe. A celebration of Jim's life will be announced at a later date.

2015-09-06T00:00:00Z,"BLAIR--The Hon. William McCormick Jr.,98, was a long time public servant, and colleague of Adlai E. Stevenson and John F. Kennedy. In the 1960s, he served as Ambassador to Denmark, Ambassador to the Philippines, and the first General Director of the John F. Kennedy Center in Washington D.C. In the 1940s and 1950's, he was senior advisor and assistant to Adlai E. Stevenson when Stevenson was Governor of Illinois, and Democratic candidate for President in 1952 and 1956. Stevenson often said that Blair was indispensable. After his service as Ambassador, Blair was elected head of the Council of American Ambassadors in Washington D.C. Known for his impeccable style and passion for movies and politics, Blair was often consulted for his nuanced perceptions on coming elections. He followed all of the candidates' histories and progress with the same ardor he gave to every news station. He was a graduate of Stanford University and the University of Virginia Law School, and was an Air Corps officer in World War II in the China-Burma-India theater and awarded the Bronze Star. He became Stevenson's key assistant when Stevenson was elected Governor of Illinois in 1948. In Stevenson's two national campaigns and later, he traveled with Stevenson in 50 states and 64 countries. He played a top role in bringing Stevenson and John F. Kennedy together in Kennedy's 1960 campaign. Bill Blair joined the Kennedy administration in 1961. After Stevenson was defeated by President Eisenhower, he joined Stevenson in 1955 in a new law firm in Chicago including W. Willard Wirtz and Newton N. Minow, which later became part of the New York firm of Paul, Weiss, Rifkind, Wharton and Garrison. After Kennedy became President, the President appointed Stevenson Ambassador to the United Nations, Wirtz as Undersecretary and later Secretary of Labor, Blair as Ambassador to Denmark, and Minow as Chairman of the Federal Communications Commission. Stevenson said, ""I regret having only one law firm to give to my country."" In recognition for service in Denmark, Blair received the Commander's Cross of the Order of the Dannebrog, First Class, and from the Philippines the Order of Sikatuna, Rank of Commander. Growing up in Chicago, he was deeply influenced by his grandmother, Louise DeKoven Bowen, who worked very closely with Jane Addams to help the underprivileged. Known for his profound social conscience, Bill cared deeply about civil and human rights and was a man who treated everyone with dignity. He was also deeply concerned about animal welfare and insisted on only owning shelter dogs. Ambassador Blair was preceded in death by his son, William, and is survived by his wife of more than 53 years, Deeda, in New York. Died Saturday, August 29 and the service will be private. If desired, contributions in his memory may be made to William Blair III Fund, the Washington Humane Society, 4590 Mac Arthur Boulevard, N.W., Washington, D.C. 20007. 1/3"

2015-09-07T00:00:00Z,"QUINE--Stephen John. December 12, 1965 to August 23, 2015. Bank of America Managing Director Stephen John Quine, whose character was shaped by his scholarly intellect, legendary funny-bone, intense sentimentality and utter devotion to his family, died suddenly on Sunday, August 23rd at Northern Westchester Hospital, New York, his beloved wife and two sons at his side. He was only 49. Stephen was born on December 12, 1965 in Niskayuna, NY, the second of two children of Dr. John Peter Quine, a Principle Engineer at General Electric, and Jean Hotaling Quine. Due to his clarity of thought and compassion for others, his mother, who died when Stephen was 17, thought he would become a minister. Brought up with values he later instilled in his own sons, Stephen attended Niskayuna High School, where he played varsity baseball and basketball. He graduated Magna Cum Laude with a Bachelors of Science in Electrical Engineering from Union College and honors from IEEE Eta Kappa Nu and Tau Beta Pi. Although he had a solid scientific background, his love of literature coupled with an analytical mind led him to Albany Law School. He was a member of the Law Review, as well as the Justinian Society, a legal organization dedicated to maintaining the honor of the legal profession. Stephen met his wife of 23 years, Rebecca Ruoff, while in Law School. The attraction was instant between the strikingly beautiful blonde and 6-foot-4 law student with the movie star looks. They married in 1992 and soon moved from Manhattan to Chappaqua to raise their children. Although Stephen often worked 16 hours a day and some weekends, he was an extremely devoted husband and father. He was happiest either on the field pitching baseballs or teeing off at Whippoorwill with his two sons. After passing the New York and Connecticut bar exams, Stephen was hired at the New York Law Firm of Clifford Chance Rogers & Wells LLD. Whisked away by their top client, Merrill Lynch, in 2002, he held several executive positions, finding his true calling when Merrill Lynch and Bank of America merged in 2010. As the Senior Global Risk Executive for B of A's Leveraged Finance, Healthcare and Gaming and Leisure Businesses, Stephen managed a team of 45 Risk Executives, as well as a portfolio of companies with billions of dollars of exposure. He oversaw some of the highest volume, extremely competitive businesses within the bank--businesses that faced intense regulatory scrutiny and had visibility at the most senior levels. Said one admiring co-worker, ""He could untangle the most complex issues into basic and easy to understand building blocks... He was a perfectionist with an unyielding drive for excellence while having fun doing it."" Stephen is survived by his wife, Rebecca Ruoff Quine; sons Adam Stephen and Matthew Stephen of Chappaqua, NY; his sister Susan Quine Laurilliard of Niskayuna, NY; and three nephews and two nieces. Both parents are deceased. 1/3"

2015-09-07T00:00:00Z,"ALLEY--James Burke Jr.,a Cowboy and a Gentleman, Dies at 79. A 50-year resident of Santa Fe, New Mexico, died peacefully Wednesday at Christus St. Vincent Hospital due to congestive heart failure. He was the son of James Burke Alley and Esther Hall Alley of Oyster Bay, New York. His father worked for President Franklin D. Roosevelt as the lead counsel for the Reconstruction Finance Corporation which played a major role in overcoming the Great Depression in the United States. Jim's mother insisted on a first rate education that began at Green Vale School and continued at Phillips Exeter Academy, Harvard College and the University of Virginia School of Law. Jim loved sports and seemed to be good at all of them: wrestling, playing football and captaining the lacrosse team at Exeter. In later years he enjoyed skiing at Taos, fishing at Crystal Brook and playing squash at the Kiva Club with friends like Bud Kelly and Walter Burke. He was a quick study at both polo and cowboy polo, the latter of which resulted in the 1975 national championship as a member of the Santa Fe Sheriff's Posse. Together with Abel Davis, Jim Ritchie and Phil Naumberg, Jim founded the original Santa Fe Polo Grounds where they played polo during the summers of the 1980s. In the winters, Jim enjoyed skiing in Taos and knew where to find the apres ski martinis Ernie Blake had hidden in the trees. He was the sort of athlete who played to win, celebrated the touchdowns of others, and kept quiet about his own. He had a curious nature: he worked as a roustabout in the Oklahoma oil fields while in school, completed basic training in the U.S. Army in Texas after college, and then worked as a corporate lawyer at Debevoise and Plimpton in New York City, but he found his true calling as a lawyer in Santa Fe serving the interests of every constituency that came to him for help. He had served as a member of the New Mexico State Bar since 1965 and valued his partners of more than 30 years, Jim Rubin and Lenny Katz. He was strongly opposed to undesirable development and served on the board of the New Mexico Environmental Law Center. In the late 1960s, as the attorney for the Upper Pecos Association, he fought an initiative to put a paved 26-mile highway across Elk Mountain in his beloved Pecos Wilderness, and the case went all the way to the U.S. Supreme Court before the highway proposal was finally defeated. He served on several corporate boards, but he also invested time in education, and was a member of the board of trustees that saved the Santa Fe Prep School during challenging years. From 1961 to 1969, Jim was married to Helen C. Lamberton (Gates) with whom he had two children, Anne L. Alley and James B. Alley III. He married Maria Elisabeth Werner in 1971 at Songa Church in Sweden and they had one daughter, Kristina E. Alley, and in marriage he gained another son, Carl M. Kawaja. Elisabeth and all of his children were by his side as he died. Elisabeth was the love of his life, and he learned to speak Swedish (very poorly), drink Aquavit (quite well) and dance around a midsummer pole (happily). Jim liked to say about special people that God broke the mold after he made them. There was no mold for someone like Jim, he had the feel of someone built by hand. He had a love of manly things - hunting, cigars, football on TV, his beautiful Swedish wife, but he also had a sophisticated palate for food, travel and artful things. He had a soft heart. He cried at his wedding to Elisabeth and when he took his younger daughter to college. He was childish in the best way, putting spit balls in a straw at The Shed restaurant, firing them at strangers and blaming his grandchildren when accused. In his later years, Jim enjoyed horseback riding in the Pecos Wilderness he had helped to save, but most of all he savored traveling the lengths of the Lower and Upper Ausable Lakes in an Adirondack guide boat with his best friend, Nicholas A. Farrell, aged 11, his grandson. He was predeceased by his brother, Dr. Harrison H. Alley, and his sister, Jane J. Edgerton, and is survived by his sister, Cynthia A. Andrews, his wife Elisabeth, his children Kristina, James, Carl, and Anne and her husband John S. Ferrara, and Jim's grandchildren, Nicholas and Linnea, children of Kristina and her husband Timothy G. Farrell, and Catherine, Marcus and Noelle, children of Carl and his wife Gwendolyn N. Holcombe. A celebration of Jim's life will be announced at a later date.

Under his leadership, Westinghouse Broadcasting put the first commercial all-news radio station on the air (WINS in New York in 1963), then expanded the format to Philadelphia (KYW) and Los Angeles (KFWB). Throughout his career as a broadcast executive, he consistently supported, nurtured and defended good, independent journalism and quality programming, and made decisions about programming and advertising standards that put public welfare first. He was an early leader in bringing diverse talent into broadcast news, and one of the first to recognize the value of live sports on television, acquiring exclusive rights for major league baseball for an independent station group in the 1950s. Larry Israel was born in McKeesport, PA November 4, 1919. He served in the Army during World War II, and graduated from the University of Missouri School of Journalism in 1948. He began as a reporter, then moved to broadcast management beginning at WDTV, the Dumont station in Pittsburgh. He later worked for Westinghouse broadcasting, where he eventually served as President of the Station Group, Chairman of the subsidiary TVAR, and Executive Vice-President of Westinghouse Broadcasting Company. He joined Post-Newsweek Stations as Chairman and Chief Executive in 1968, leading the expansion and development of the Washington Post broadcast properties and changing the format of WTOP radio in Washington to all-news. He eventually became Executive Vice-President, then President (from 1973-1977) of the Washington Post Company. After leaving the Post Company, he invested in and led the North American Broadcasting Company. Larry Israel was honored in 1972 with the prestigious University of Missouri School of Journalism Honor Award for Distinguished Service in Journalism, based on his lifetime achievement.

Sonia was born in Luxembourg and survived the Holocaust, escaping from internment camps, hiding in Marseille, before eventually fleeing to Switzerland with her mother. Her father perished at Auschwitz; her brother disappeared. Sonia trained as an interpreter in Geneva, and worked for O.R.T. in Paris, before coming to New York in 1952. There she met and fell in love with Joseph Breindel, an OB-GYN, originally from Zablotow, a small town in what is now Ukraine. They married and had two children, Eric (born 1955), a journalist, who died in 1998, and Monique (born 1954), a doctor. In New York, Sonia worked as an interpreter (she spoke Italian, French, German and English), progressive educator (she received her BA from Goddard and her Masters from Bank Street), gallery assistant, and in recent years as a volunteer at the Metropolitan Museum of Art. More importantly, she was passionate about the arts and culture -- music (she had a beautiful voice); opera; paintings; sculpture; theater; and literature -- and a world traveler. Sonia was also an adoring and adored mother and grandmother, quintessential New Yorker (for all that she was also quite European), and perpetual intellectual sparring partner.

He is survived by his wife of 61 years, Elaine, by his children, Roshanna and Rei, and by his grandchildren, Samantha, Ian, Erica, Marina, and Daniel. He was deeply loved. Dr. Rothberg was born in Atlantic City, NJ, on May 14, 1931, the second son of Harry and Sarah. He developed a profound fascination with the mysteries of the universe as a child that would guide the rest of his life. Jerry was a star athlete and Westinghouse honoree at Atlantic City High School, and attended MIT on an academic scholarship, earning money over the summers selling ice cream on the beach. It was during this halcyon period that Jerry met and fell in love with Elaine Sophie Williams, a summa cum laude graduate of Philadelphia's Girls High and soon-to-be of Temple University. Jerry and Elaine married in 1954, shortly after he returned from a year spent in Paris as a Fulbright scholar and traveling poet with an Irish circus troupe. They both attended graduate school at Columbia University, where Gerald earned his Ph.D. in physics as a student of Dr. I.I. Rabi and a doctoral advisee of Dr. Polycarp Cush. Dr. Rothberg had a long and distinguished career teaching and conducting research at Stevens Institute of Technology, where he was George Meade Bond Professor of Materials Science and Engineering and head of the Materials Science and Engineering department, Director of the Cryogenics Center and Director of the Program on Science and Engineering Aspects of Materials Surfaces.

During his career, Dr. Rothberg accepted many opportunities to conduct research and train graduate students at universities and laboratories in the U.S., and throughout Europe and Asia, notably in Japan where he held the Nippon Steel Corporation Chair of Advanced Materials at the University of Tokyo. He was a thoughtful and inspiring teacher and many of his graduate students have gone on to important academic and industrial positions. Jerry and Elaine shared a deep love of travel, and a deeper love of family, and often found creative ways to combine the two. They travelled the world, delving into its remotest corners, frequently with children or grandchildren in tow, making up playful songs and games along the way. They visited every continent and travelled through almost a hundred countries, making friends everywhere. Dr. Rothberg will be remembered by all who knew him for his kindness, wisdom, humor, and his great love of life. 1/3"
2015-09-09T00:00:00Z,"BLAIR--The Hon. William McCormick Jr.,98, was a long time public servant, and colleague of Adlai E. Stevenson and John F. Kennedy. In the 1960s, he served as Ambassador to Denmark, Ambassador to the Philippines, and the first General Director of the John F. Kennedy Center in Washington D.C. In the 1940s and 1950's, he was senior advisor and assistant to Adlai E. Stevenson when Stevenson was Governor of Illinois, and Democratic candidate for President in 1952 and 1956. Stevenson often said that Blair was indispensable. After his service as Ambassador, Blair was elected head of the Council of American Ambassadors in Washington D.C. Known for his impeccable style and passion for movies and politics, Blair was often consulted for his nuanced perceptions on coming elections. He followed all of the candidates' histories and progress with the same ardor he gave to every news station. He was a graduate of Stanford University and the University of Virginia Law School, and was an Air Corps officer in World War II in the China-Burma-India theater and awarded the Bronze Star. He became Stevenson's key assistant when Stevenson was elected Governor of Illinois in 1948. In Stevenson's two national campaigns and later, he traveled with Stevenson in 50 states and 64 countries. He played a top role in bringing Stevenson and John F. Kennedy together in Kennedy's 1960 campaign. Bill Blair joined the Kennedy administration in 1961. After Stevenson was defeated by President Eisenhower, he joined Stevenson in 1955 in a new law firm in Chicago including W. Willard Wirtz and Newton N. Minow, which later became part of the New York firm of Paul, Weiss, Rifkind, Wharton and Garrison. After Kennedy became President, the President appointed Stevenson Ambassador to the United Nations, Wirtz as Undersecretary and later Secretary of Labor, Blair as Ambassador to Denmark, and Minow as Chairman of the Federal Communications Commission. Stevenson said, ""I regret having only one law firm to give to my country."" In recognition for service in Denmark, Blair received the Commander's Cross of the Order of the Dannebrog, First Class, and from the Philippines the Order of Sikatuna, Rank of Commander. Growing up in Chicago, he was deeply influenced by his grandmother, Louise DeKoven Bowen, who worked very closely with Jane Addams to help the underprivileged. Known for his profound social conscience, Bill cared deeply about civil and human rights and was a man who treated everyone with dignity. He was also deeply concerned about animal welfare and insisted on only owning shelter dogs. Ambassador Blair was preceded in death by his son, William, and is survived by his wife of more than 53 years, Deeda, in New York. Died Saturday, August 29 and the service will be private.

2015-09-09T00:00:00Z,"VAUPEN--Burton. Born in New York on the 28th of April, 1930 to Alex and Betty Vaupen, passed away on the 31st of August, 2015 in the company of his wife Frederika and daughter Jill. Burton was raised with his younger brother, Jack, in a one bedroom doorman apartment on the Grand Concourse. He attended P.S. 46, Dewitt Clinton High School and graduated from Columbia University with a degree in Fine Arts. Burt paid his way through college by working at a resort in the Catskills. He began his career as an NBC page, where he first became enamored with companies which combined creativity with corporate know- how. In the 1950s, Burt was hired by Young & Rubicam and began a thirty-year career in advertising, taking him from New York City to San Francisco and Sydney, Australia, where he rose from a corporate financial executive to Treasurer Worldwide and finally, Chief Financial Officer for the company. In 1983 when Dentsu merged with Young & Rubicam to form DYR in Los Angeles, Burt came aboard as Executive Vice President and Administrative Officer, and moved his family to the west coast. After DYR, Burton parlayed his expertise in cutting costs and raising profits by taking a job as a Corporate Finance Executive for the film and television company, Lorimar Telepictures. In addition to his very successful career, Burt also pursued many other passions. A truly talented chef, he loved bringing people together for home-cooked gourmet meals, whether in his kitchen in Saddle River, New Jersey or in his dream home on the Caribbean island of Anguilla, where, an ardent captain and fisherman, he often caught the main dish himself. After retiring from corporate life, Burton became bicoastal, splitting his time between Santa Fe, New Mexico and Anguilla. The Southwestern landscape and culture, local food and artistry were a much-welcomed change for the native New Yorker who was an avid fan and big supporter of the Santa Fe opera. One of Burts greatest pleasures was surprising Frederika, his wife of 44 years (married December 31, 1971), with exotic trips, including climbing Mt. Kilimanjaro, Patagonia, Machu Picchu, The Orient Express, Kuala Lumpur, Singapore, and Fiji to name a few. He loved to share the gift of travel, and when he lived in Australia it opened the doors for the whole family to visit parts of the world they might have never seen. Burton will always be remembered for his quiet disposition, wry sense of humor and impeccable sense of style. An avid photographer, he captured candid moments and created picture books for all to enjoy. Close family and friends remember Burton as a patient, diligent and introspective perfectionist as well as an epicurean with a passion for adventure. A man of few words, he had a kind heart and generous spirit. His philanthropy extended to making charitable donations to numerous homeless and orphanage groups. Burt is survived by his wife Frederika, a brother Jack, his children Robert, Susan, Pamela, Paul and Jill; and ten grandchildren. 1/3"

2015-09-10T00:00:00Z,"LEVINSON--Patricia S. Known for her summertime straw hat and roll-up-your-sleeves work attitude, Patricia Schulte Levinson died at Mount Sinai Hospital on September 8th after a brief but heroic fight with cancer. She had been active in board work and non-profit affiliations, especially as a Trustee of the Mount Sinai Healthcare System, and was a lifelong New Yorker, a lover of the arts and culture, and who enjoyed spending time with her family and in the summers at her Long Island home. Pat was the daughter of Arthur D. Schulte and Luise Meyer Schulte. She graduated from the Spence School and attended Connecticut College and Columbia University before marrying Robert A. Levinson in 1954. Pat joined the Boards of Trustees of Mount Sinai Hospital in 1981 when she was named President of the Mount Sinai Auxiliary Board, a group she first joined in 1961. Pat served on several of the hospital's board committees both as a member and chair; most recently on the Patient Care and Quality Assurance, Medical Education and Community Relations Committees. Board members grew to anticipate receiving articles and clippings from her, all on recycled paper and all pertinent to the issues of the day. For many years she also served as a Board liaison to the Nursing Department. Pat had been co-chair of the Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai's Center for Multicultural and Community Affairs (CMCA) Advisory Board since its inception. A champion of students, her personal commitment included the creation of the Robert and Patricia Levinson Student Center, and the endowment of scholarships and fellowships at the Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai. She was a founding member and vice president of New York City's New Alternatives for Children (NAC) where she helped children move from hospitals to loving homes, a director of Linkage House, and vice chair of the United Hospital Fund, as well as a member of Health First's Board of Managers of Senior Health Partners and a former trustee of the Blythedale Children's Hospital. Pat brought friends from all parts of her life to help grow these important causes - whether through raising awareness or opening her home for salon gatherings - always with her famous cheese crackers. She was the recipient of a United Hospital Fund Distinguished Trustee Award for her leadership, guidance, and extraordinary service to Mount Sinai as well as The Jacobi Medallion, awarded by The Mount Sinai Alumni, in recognition of her distinguished service to the Hospital and the School. An involved New Yorker, Pat enjoyed the city in particular ballet, music, theater and all the arts, and made certain that her multitude of friends shared her pleasures. Pat was a devoted wife, mother, aunt, grandmother and friend to many. She was respected for her energy, work ethic and her vast knowledge of the health care issues she worked so diligently to address in her Mount Sinai, NAC and UHF board work. Pat, born in 1933, is survived by her husband of 61 years, Robert A. Levinson, her daughter Margot and two sons, Andrew and John as well as their spouses: John Ganz, Jr, Karen Levinson, and Ronna Levinson. Pat and Bob have five grandsons: Craig, Jamie, Kyle, Jack and Dean. Pat was pre-deceased by her brother Anthony M. Schulte. In lieu of flowers please consider a donation to New Alternatives for Children and/or the Patricia Levinson Scholarship Fund, CMCA, at the Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai. A memorial service will be held on Thursday, September 24th at 5pm in the Leo C. Stern Auditorium, Annenberg Building, Mount Sinai. Reception to follow. Funeral services will be private. 1/3"

Cynthia, 75, was the daughter of the late Peggy and the late John Hammett. She had an incredible career in communications, journalism and art. Cynthia was born in New York City and raised in New Jersey, mostly in Summit and Bay Head. For the past 25 years, Cynthia lived with her husband, Richard A. Russack, in Fort Worth, Texas, New Harbor, Maine, and since 2008, they had an apartment in New York City. Cynthia graduated from the Kent Place School, and earned her B.A. and M.A. degrees in art history and urban planning at the University of Wisconsin, Madison. She was awarded a Fullbright Scholarship to study at the University of Florence, a Kresge Fellowship for study at the Courtauld Institute of Art in London and the London School of Economics. Ms. Hammett began her communications career with the Prudential Life Insurance Company, and also worked with Chase and was the director of communications for Philip Morris International for 10 years, producing brochures, films and managing the Company's Art Exhibition Program in various capitals of the world. She briefly worked for Planned Parenthood International in New York, before becoming managing editor of the Block Island Times, where she and Richard lived for nearly 20 years. It was in 2000, when she and her husband began building their New Harbor home that Cynthia started oil painting under the guidance of the late John Urbain, a friend and noted collage and oil painter. She took classes at Texas Christian University in Fort Worth under now retired professor of art Jim Woodson, who was the 2014 Texas Artist of the Year. She also has exhibited at numerous galleries and art centers in Fort Worth and mid-coast Maine. Her paintings are a part of collections throughout the United States and Europe. In addition to her husband and their pets, Paolo, Lucia, Raven and Boris, Cynthia's survivors include: sister Elizabeth Taggart and husband, Bill; brother Peter and wife, Prudence; nephews Chris Nolan and wife Carolyn, and children, Morgan and Ian, and Peter Hammett and wife Kristy, and daughter Lucille; nieces Hilary Cohen and son Patrick Penlington, and Priscilla Vincent and husband Rob, and children, Hadley and Cooper; and numerous cousins. Additionally, Cynthia had great influence on the lives of Richard's three children: son Eric and wife Amy; daughter Robin and husband Jim Brown; and son Evan and wife Kelly; and their children, Will, Chloe, Claire and Kate Russack; Samantha, Scott and Ted Brown; and Trevor and Lucas Russack. Cynthia's ashes will be buried in New Harbor. 1/3"

2015-09-13T00:00:00Z,"LEVINSON--Patricia S. Known for her summertime straw hat and roll-up-your-sleeves work attitude, Patricia Schulte Levinson died at Mount Sinai Hospital on September 8th after a brief but heroic fight with cancer. She had been active in board work and non-profit affiliations, especially as a Trustee of the Mount Sinai Healthcare System, and was a lifelong New Yorker, a lover of the arts and culture, and who enjoyed spending time with her family and in the summers at her Long Island home. Pat was the daughter of Arthur D. Schulte and Luise Meyer Schulte. She graduated from the Spence School and attended Connecticut College and Columbia University before marrying Robert A. Levinson in 1954. Pat joined the Boards of Trustees of Mount Sinai Hospital in 1981 when she was named President of the Mount Sinai Auxiliary Board, a group she first joined in 1961. Pat served on several of the hospital's board committees both as a member and chair; most recently on the Patient Care and Quality Assurance, Medical Education and Community Relations Committees. Board members grew to anticipate receiving articles and clippings from her, all on recycled paper and all pertinent to the issues of the day. For many years she also served as a Board liaison to the Nursing Department. Pat had been co-chair of the Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai's Center for Multicultural and Community Affairs (CMCA) Advisory Board since its inception. A champion of students, her personal commitment included the creation of the Robert and Patricia Levinson Student Center, and the endowment of scholarships and fellowships at the Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai. She was a founding member and vice president of New York City's New Alternatives for Children (NAC) where she helped children move from hospitals to loving homes, a director of Linkage House, and vice chair of the United Hospital Fund, as well as a member of Health First's Board of Managers of Senior Health Partners and a former trustee of the Blythedale Children's Hospital. Pat brought friends from all parts of her life to help grow these important causes - whether through raising awareness or opening her home for salon gatherings - always with her famous cheese crackers. She was the recipient of a United Hospital Fund Distinguished Trustee Award for her leadership, guidance, and extraordinary service to Mount Sinai as well as The Jacobi Medallion, awarded by The Mount Sinai Alumni, in recognition of her distinguished service to the Hospital and the School. An involved New Yorker, Pat enjoyed the city in particular ballet, music, theater and all the arts, and made certain that her multitude of friends shared her pleasures. Pat was a devoted wife, mother, aunt, grandmother and friend to many. She was respected for her energy, work ethic and her vast knowledge of the health care issues she worked so diligently to address in her Mount Sinai, NAC and UHF board work. Pat, born in 1933, is survived by her husband of 61 years, Robert A. Levinson, her daughter Margot and two sons, Andrew and John as well as their spouses: John Ganz, Jr, Karen Levinson, and Ronna Levinson. Pat and Bob have five grandsons: Craig, Jamie, Kyle, Jack and Dean. Pat was pre-deceased by her brother Anthony M. Schulte. In lieu of flowers please consider a donation to New Alternatives for Children and/or the Patricia Levinson Scholarship Fund, CMCA, at the Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai. A memorial service will be held on Thursday, September 24th at 5pm in the Leo C. Stern Auditorium, Annenberg Building, Mount Sinai. Reception to follow. Funeral services will be private. 1/3"
