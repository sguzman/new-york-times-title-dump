2009-02-19T00:00:00Z,"FREESKIING has been credited with making skiing cool again -- particularly among the junior set, which had been lured by the snowboard's renegade appeal. Thanks to twin-tip skis, which are rounded and upturned on both ends, freeskiers can land on the snow facing forward or backward, making it possible to do the flashy jumps and daring tricks of the snowboard on ungroomed backcountry snow, as well as on the pipes and jumps of terrain parks. Overall sales of skis are in decline but freeskis are ''a very hot category right now,'' said Kelly Davis, research director for the trade group SnowSports Industries America. Freeski sales as a percentage of Alpine ski sales have doubled in the last three years, to 28 percent. Like adult twin-tips, children's versions have wood or fiberglass cores and are wider than other Alpine skis to better handle abrupt landings and a range of snow conditions."

2009-02-20T16:13:16Z,"A California law that would have banned the sale or rental of violent video games to minors was struck down Friday by a federal appeals court, The Associated Press reported. The ruling, by a three-judge panel from the United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit, reaffirmed an earlier decision by a federal judge in San Jose that declared unconstitutional a 2005 law prohibiting the sale of “patently offensive” games to players under 18. State Senator Leland Yee, Democrat of San Francisco, had sought to reinstate the law, which would have imposed strict labeling requirements on video game publishers. But Judge Consuelo M. Callahan said in an opinion that there were less restrictive ways to protect children from “unquestionably violent” video games. Mr. Yee said he would ask the state’s attorney general, Jerry Brown, to appeal the decision to the United States Supreme Court."

The Alliance of Motion Picture and Television Producers, which represents the studios, rescinded some earlier proposals that the actors’ union had opposed, but the two sides failed to agree on start and stop dates for a new contract. The actors are seeking a three-year contract that would be retroactive to the June 2008 expiration of the earlier contract, which would then align it with the expiration dates of contracts between the studios and other unions, including the Writers Guild. The studios want the new deal to begin on ratification and last for three years, which the actors believe would give them less leverage in bargaining on future deals. The board of the actors union will consider the offer at a meeting on Saturday."

But, sighed Joanna Virello, a PR rep for IC LAB, the host of the evening, the idea of a kissing wall was nixed: ""They said it was unsanitary."" Instead there were pictures of puckering models on the walls. But there was a D.J. from France. His name was Edouard, and he had just flown in from Bordeaux, where he works as a banker. A lonely pucker mark - in New York Nude, a medium ""sand dune"" tone - on the wall proved the existence of at least one woman who wouldn't let hygiene ruin her night."

Crude-talking, hard-drinking, overweight, barely educated, in debt, the child of drug addicts, she appeared on the reality show ''Big Brother'' in 2002 as a kind of token lowlife. But something about Ms. Goody, then 21, struck a chord -- even if it was a patronizing one -- in a restless nation searching for ways to allay its millennial boredom. She became a bona fide media star, a working-class Paris Hilton. Britons eagerly devoured every detail of her life, no matter how banal. They worked out to her exercise videos, bought her perfume, read her autobiography and, when she made racist remarks about an Indian actress on ''Celebrity Big Brother'' in 2007, angrily turned against her."

Not just the cross-country and downhill skiers who zoom and whoosh over its snow at this time of year, but thinkers around the world for whom the name signifies not a resort, but a grand economic agreement -- the blueprint that gave a broken world a path to financial stability after World War II. For some, that Bretton Woods seems like the sort of thing it might be time to think about again. In 1944, less than a month after D-Day, delegates from 44 nations met at the Mount Washington Hotel, which still sits grandly against the forested flanks and majestic peaks of the Presidential Range, welcoming guests. Germany and Japan were not invited, and the subject was money. The Allies were winning the war, but everyone knew that most countries -- even the winners -- would emerge as economic wrecks.

Just stop. Period. Bad way to go. If it helps, consider your museum and its collection in purely materialistic terms, as a big chunk of capital, slowly and fortuitously accumulated. Once spent, it is irrecoverable. Your university can never be that rich in that way again. Or view the art in your care as something that doesn't belong to you.

That money will not be enough to pay for a single bullet train, transportation experts say. And by the time the $8 billion gets divided among the 11 regions across the country that the government has designated as high-speed rail corridors, they say, it is unlikely to do much beyond paying for long-delayed improvements to passenger lines, and making a modest investment in California's plan for a true bullet train."

A graduate of Indiana University, she received an MA in English from the University of South Florida. In 1983, Susan joined natural cosmetics manufacturer Aubrey Organics and worked her way to Vice President of Marketing and Advertising, as well as Editor-in-Chief of Organica magazine. A playwright and poet, Susan wrote and co-produced a number of award-winning plays, including Plutography in the Slave Trade, A Christmas Memory, The Toxic Wave, and The Dressing Room, which was singled out by the St. Petersburg Times as one of the best 10 shows of 1993, and was later produced off-Broadway in New York. In 1990, Susan and her husband Aubrey co-founded Gorilla Theatre, Tampa's only equity theater. In 1999, she received the Weekly Planet's Best of the Bay award for best playwright. Her two-play collection, The Toxic Wave & The Dressing Room, was published by the University of Tampa Press in 2002. The family requests that, in place of flowers, Susan's bright spirit be honored with donations to her favorite charity, Broadway Cares/Equity Fights AIDS, CareCard Donations, 165 West 46th Street, #"

A graduate of Westover School and Sarah Lawrence College, Lys served on the Board of Westover School, the New England Historic Genealogical Society, and The Sewickley Historical Society. She was a professional breeder of champion Pembroke Welsh Corgis under kennel name Hilden and was on the board of the American Kennel Club.

2009-02-22T11:53:50Z,"A day before the celebratory Academy Awards, the national board of directors of the Screen Actors Guild on Saturday rejected what studios termed a “last, best and final offer” in the negotiations between the actors’ union and the Alliance of Motion Picture and Television Producers, which represents the studios. Last week, the two sides seemed close to an agreement, but the latest offer from the producers included what SAG called a “surprise demand.” The actors are seeking a three-year contract retroactive to June 2008, when its previous agreement expired. That would mean the new contract would expire at the same time as the studios’ agreements with the American Federation of Television and Radio Artists and the writers’ and directors’ guilds. Concurrent expiration dates would, of course, allow the unions to join forces in 2011 negotiations. The studios’ latest offer, presented on Feb. 19, proposed that the new agreement begin upon ratification and last for three years. “The AMPTPs last-minute, surprise demand for a new term of agreement extending to 2012 is regressive and damaging,” the Guild said in a statement released on Saturday. “By attempting to extend our contract expiration one year beyond the other entertainment unions, the AMPTP intends to deleverage our bargaining position from this point forward.” The producers also released a statement defending their offer as “strong and fair,” and pointing out that they have consistently sought a three year agreement and “have offered SAG a way to achieve an earlier expiration date without contributing to further labor uncertainty.”"

2009-02-22T23:36:52Z,"It looks like they might bring this one in at under three hours, so I'll curb my complaining. And I'll close by noting that this seemed not only like a relatively brief Oscar ceremony, but a small one. Maybe this is a harbinger of things to come. Like it or not, the movies have lost their pop-cultural supremacy, and the fate of the Oscars may either be to go after a vanished mass appeal or to scale down, acknowledge the shrinking of the audience and turn into something like the Tonys. More of a coterie affair, appealing to the aficionados and the curious. It would be an honorable outcome."

This is a bit of a puzzler to me, but since this is one of those categories where a voter has to have seen every nominee, maybe ""Departures"" is a great picture. I have to say I'm a bit disappointed that neither the social curiosity or ""The Class"" nor the political seriousness of ""Bashir"" moved the Academy. And of course, like my pal the Bagger, I can't believe that ""Gomorrah"" didn't merit a nomination. Another one of many boats missed by the Academy this year."

2009-02-22T23:10:54Z,"The wins that ""Slumdog"" has racked up in some of the less glamorous categories--- editing, cinematography and score -- may be the most significant, since they recognize some of the film's novelty. Its look, its pacing and its sound are not like the competition, and indeed not like a lot of commercial American movies. And yet it is an entirely accessible movie, not so much self-consciously exotic as effortlessly, eagerly eclectic. So the fast editing, the eye-popping colors and textures, the songs and the music may be, to some audiences and Academy voters, a bit unfamiliar, but they obviously work, extending the vocabulary of what we sometimes parochially think of as mainstream moviemaking in some exciting new directions."

No big surprises, and also a weirdly desperate, jumpy, uncertain energy to the show. But I don't necessarily mind this. The problem with the Oscars, as I wrote not long ago, is that they've taken on an aura of cultural importance that they can't possibly live up to.

As Rivera interacted with his fellow reliever Edwar Ramirez in the clubhouse on Saturday, their behavior fit the mold of the older brother dominating the little brother because he can. After Rivera had an analgesic heating lotion applied to his right shoulder, he removed his shirt, rubbed it against the product and then pressed it against Ramirez's ear. Ramirez swiped in the air as if a dozen bees had floated into his ear. Ramirez complained, but it did not stop Rivera. In fact, Rivera was not finished with teasing his little buddy.

2009-02-22T00:00:00Z,"Since Adam and Eve first used fig leaves to make “aprons,” these garments have weathered mixed fashion fortunes. But at the spring collections, they leapt from the kitchen to the catwalk. At Miu Miu, they were slung over silky skirts; Junya Watanabe’s models swayed with tribal-motif aprons over patchwork denim skirts; and at Marc Jacobs, a 1940s-style apron was cinched with a Lurex-shot sash. Up to the early 20th century, aprons were predominantly worn by servants. But in 1917, according to Elda Danese’s book “The House Dress,” Herbert Hoover, then the director of the Food Administration, developed a plan for civilians to supply food to the military; housewives were issued a beret and coveralls that became known as the Hoover Apron. During World War II, Diana Vreeland, working at Harper’s Bazaar, challenged the designer Claire McCardell to create an attractive garment to meet the needs of women “who faced the facts of life.” McCardell’s “popover,” a tie-fastened denim shift with patch pockets and a quilted oven mitt, sold in the hundreds of thousands. Soon aprons became associated with apple-pie moms, but across the Atlantic stars like Sophia Loren were using them to emphasize their swaying hips. With the advent of women’s liberation, though, aprons became passé, and it wasn’t until the ’90s that designers like Helmut Lang and artists like Andrea Zittel began re-examining them. At Zittel’s Smockshop (smockshop.org), artists still produce one-off versions. Lately, the cult of the apron has been gaining ground — witness “Desperate Housewives” and the earthy mamacitas of Pedro Almodóvar’s films. Apronology, a magazine targeting haute-apron fanciers, was introduced this month. In Japan, “hadaka apron” fetishists enjoy imagery of women wearing nothing but an apron — an aesthetic that evokes some of Thakoon Panichgul&#"

As are Lindsay Lohan, who declared herself a role model to “younger generations as well as generations older than me”; Britney Spears, the teen-queen train wreck; Barry Bonds, the probably-not-all-natural home-run hero; and Bode Miller, the Olympic party boy. Sadly, Jelena Jankovic, the tennis star riveted by her own image during instant replays on the Jumbotron at last year’s U.S. Open, and Madonna, who has parlayed self-absorption and exhibitionism into a multimillion-dollar career, didn’t make the cut. But for Jean M. Twenge and W. Keith Campbell, psychologists and authors of “THE NARCISSISM EPIDEMIC: LIVING IN THE AGE OF ENTITLEMENT” (Free Press), the challenge must have been not finding examples but deciding which ones to leave out."
2009-02-22T00:00:00Z,"When Giambattista Valli was 8 years old, his family took him to see Visconti’s “The Leopard.” The youngster assumed he was about to enjoy a Disney-like production featuring cuddly felines, but what he got instead was a fashion revelation. To this day, Valli credits his aesthetic to the scene where Claudia Cardinale, who plays the unsophisticated but ravishing young upstart Angelica, laughs unabashedly at an off-color joke during a formal dinner. Needless to say, it is Angelica and not a prim principessa who winds up with the aristocrat Tancredi Falconeri, played by Alain Delon. “At that age, you notice things but you don’t know why,” Valli says. “Years later you realize their importance.”."

2009-02-22T00:00:00Z,"Christian Niessen and Nicole Lachelle, two German designers based in New York, are taking the concept of “one-of-a-kind dressing” to a new level with their No Editions label. Niessen trawls through online newspapers and magazines for striking images (music videos, daily headlines, NASA landscapes), manipulates them on his computer until they’re completely unrecognizable and then transfers them onto clothes. The prints are all unique, which means that no two No Editions garments are ever the same. “Complete individualization is the only weapon that small designers have in the fight against big retailers and chains,” says Niessen, who worked with Helmut Lang as his head designer. The couple makes sure that the prints are always the focus of attention by keeping their silhouettes clean and straightforward: there are shawl-collared felt wraps, ultrathin silk camisole dresses, hooded windbreakers and straight-leg jeans that gradate from dark navy to black. “We work with customized printers and a special blend of inks,” Niessen says. “They are low-cost, low-tech elements that have allowed us to obtain high-tech results that are very difficult to copy.” In other words, don’t try it at home.

2009-02-22T00:00:00Z,"The first thing you should know about olfactory works of art — scents made by artists who work not in paint or clay but in the medium of scent — is their rare, visceral beauty. Art scents are the Lucian Freuds, Mirós and, at times, Damien Hirsts of the trade. The raw materials used by the luxury fragrance brands to concoct perfumes are harnessed here by artists to construct serious aesthetic work, work that conveys vision and emotion on an invisible canvas. The inventiveness poured into these creations reverberates not against our retinas or eardrums but our nasal epithelia. Which is the second most astonishing thing about scent art — the degree to which museums essentially ignore it."

2009-02-22T00:00:00Z,"“Valentino: The Last Emperor” (in theaters this spring) seems at first like pure escapist fun — the cinematic version of a lipstick-red party dress that you wear once and remember a thousand times. Valentino, the spectacularly famous fashion designer, jets from fitting to lunch to party, from his Versailles chateau to his Gstaad chalet to his 152-foot yacht, his entourage and five pugs faithfully en suite. But the film’s potent, bittersweet undertow makes it one for the ages. It reveals one of the past century’s most elegantly lived lives — and a world that is slipping away even as the cameras roll. The director, Matt Tyrnauer, followed Valentino and his longtime partner, Giancarlo Giammetti, through tense dealings with Marzotto (which had bought Valentino’s fashion house in 2002; he remained the designer until last year), his penultimate couture show and finally a goodbye party in the Roman Forum, with the Colosseum as a backdrop. Paradoxically, while the film chronicles Valentino’s stepping down, it has enthroned him in a new, different role. Last year, at the Venice and Toronto film festivals, the screenings ended with standing ovations — and not just from fashion fans. Still, Valentino is playing it cool. “I cannot judge the movie,” he says. “But we are not worried that sometimes we look a bit ridiculous or a bit extravagant. We are what we are.” No doubt about that. [?][?][?] DAVID COLMAN."

2009-02-22T00:00:00Z,"Maybe it’s a reaction to the distressing economy, but I’ve been consumed with the urge to release my inner diva. And what better role model for fantasies of excess than the art collector and style eccentric Peggy Guggenheim? She had a nose job in 1920, when such procedures were decidedly dangerous; surrounded herself with divine artists, husbands and lovers and an even more divine gaggle of Lhasa apsos; presided over a gallery with curved walls and a turquoise floor; and wore custom earrings by Alexander Calder and Yves Tanguy. Did I mention that her Dunhill lighter had a phallic engraving, also by Tanguy? But Guggenheim’s most recognizable accessories were her batwing, butterfly-shaped, gilded and bejeweled eyeglass frames, courtesy of the artist Edward Melcarth, a friend and fellow Venice resident in the 1950s. It’s unclear whether I’ll be able to discover the next Jackson Pollock within my lifetime, but this season I can at least channel Peggy’s spirit with fabulously decadent shades by David Yurman, Lanvin and Pucci (left, from top). Who knows? If all else fails, I may pack them up, move to Miami, dye my hair blue and pursue a career as a fabulous old lady. Not a bad option, all things considered.[?][?][?] REBECCA VOIGHT."

But, she assures us, “I’m not afraid!” Also a fearless clotheshorse, Ditto will introduce a self-proclaimed “fat-lady clothing line” for the British plus-size label Evans this summer. She says her current style obsessions are “Sarah Jessica Parker from 1993, Madonna from her ‘Cherish’ music video and Missy Elliott’s trash-bag look” — not to mention Jeremy Scott, Vivienne Westwood and “those amazing designers who make clothes to fit me.” But whether it is music or fashion, Ditto has just one rule: “Absolutely no shame.” [?][?][?] ALEX HAWGOOD."

2009-02-22T00:00:00Z,"As Peggy Orenstein points out (The Way We Live Now, Feb. 8), there’s nothing like the suggestion of a cancer risk to freak out a parent. Can we really blame parents for overprotecting when those in charge are negligent? This negligence becomes even more obvious in cases where there isn’t just a suggestion of risk, but clear evidence. Take formaldehyde. Just this month the E.P.A. was reportedly “considering” regulating formaldehyde as a toxic substance, which would be momentous except that the World Health Organization declared it as “carcinogenic to humans” back in 2004, and the E.P.A. itself listed formaldehyde as a “probable human carcinogen” back in the 1980s. If being concerned about a more-than-20-year delay in regulating a carcinogenic substance that is ubiquitous in clothing, carpeting, furniture and paint marks me as a helicopter parent, then watch your head. We can’t raise kids in a bubble, but going out of our way to protect them is the only intelligent choice, because there’s no one else looking out for their well-being."

2009-02-22T00:00:00Z,"STOLBERG--Irving. A Friend Remembered. Describing another person through titles and labels can be an innocent form of short-hand, or a form of criticism and judgment. During his life, Irving Stolberg earned many titles and attracted many labels. Stolberg, who died on February 13, was most famously known as the two-term Speaker of the Connecticut House of Representatives and a 22-year member of that body. To some he was that ""liberal Democrat from New Haven."" To me he was a former neighbor and a dear friend of 40 years. Through that wonderful association, I was able to gather a deeper understanding of Irv Stolberg, one that transcended titles and labels. Irv Stolberg held, espoused, and vigorously defended some very strong views. He was for peace, opposed to the Vietnam War, for progressive taxation including the income tax, opposed to the death penalty, supportive of the United Nations, opposed to the war in Iraq, for the global spread of democratic institutions, opposed to racism, and respectful of foreign cultures. To some his views were controversial, disloyal, or wrong. To some they were principled, moral, and right. With the hindsight of passed years, it now seems that his views held much truth and will carry well into the future. Irv Stolberg did not simply pluck his views from the shelves of some ideologically driven bookstore, nor borrow them from some talking head. They came, instead, from study and deep contemplation. They came from constant observation and evaluation, applied with the discipline of a lifelong professional academic. Through his travels and work in almost 100 countries, he was informed by the common threads of humanity that he observed; of the common need for peace and the absence of violence, for adequate sustenance, for health care, for the education of children, and protection of the aged. It was with profound respect for all citizens of our globe, and with constant support for their fundamental needs and rights -- through endless public service -- that Irv Stolberg led his life; a good life of a good friend. Irv wished in lieu of flowers that donations in his memory be made to the United Nations Association CT or to the American Friends Service Committee. Edward J. Mazur Richmond, Virginia"

He was surrounded by family and friends. Under his leadership, the American Farm School grew from a small school devoted to improving the lives of rural youths from Greece and the Balkans to a major institution known throughout the region and the world as a leader in agricultural education and leadership training. Mr. Lansdale's books, Master Farmer and Cultivating Inspired Leaders, translated into several languages, are recognized tools for global work in sustainable development. Former U.S. Ambassador to Greece, Thomas M.T. Niles, said, ""Bruce Landale's work as President of the American Farm School did more for Greece, and Greek-American relations, than all the American ambassadors combined, myself included."" Born in 1925 in Worcester, Massachusetts, he was raised in Thessaloniki where his father was an early director of the YMCA. He earned degrees from Rochester University and Cornell. Mr. Lansdale's many honors included three successive Fulbright Scholar grants; Rockefeller and Ford Foundation Fellowships; and an honorary Ph.D. from Aristotle University of Thessaloniki. He was an honorary citizen of Greece and of the City of Thessaloniki. The Greek Government awarded him the Commander of the Order of Honor, and the Royal Order of King George. Besides his wife, Tad, Mr. Lansdale leaves four children: David, Jeffrey and Michael Lansdale, Christine Willis and eleven grandchildren.

Combined with a revised figure of minus 1.05 percent for the third quarter, the latest contraction plunged the country officially into recession. BEHIND THE NEWS The slump has now rippled far down a chain of causes and effects: The credit crisis dried up spending by American consumers, which undercut growth in China, whose manufacturers sell them goods; that, in turn, clobbered Taiwan, which depends heavily on trade with the once-booming mainland. Taiwanese exports fell about 43 percent in January compared with a year ago, the steepest plunge in Asia."

Gonzalez, an international tax partner with Coopers & Lybrand who had an instrumental role in expanding that company's international tax operations, died peacefully in his home in Hillsborough, California, on Saturday, February 7, 2009. Mr. Gonzalez was born in Laredo, Texas and graduated from Texas A & M University. He received an MBA from the University of North Texas. He served his country in Korea in the U.S. Army. Later in his career, Mr. Gonzalez completed Harvard University's Program for Management Development, an intensive course in business management geared for high-performing executives. In 1960 he started a career with Price Waterhouse in New York. In 1965 he joined International Basic Economy Corporation (IBEC) as Vice President of Tax. IBEC was created by Nelson A. Rockefeller with the aim of promoting economic development-such as supermarkets, housing, poultry and mutual funds--in Latin America. IBEC later expanded its activities into 33 other underdeveloped countries on 4 continents. He joined Coopers & Lybrand in 1974 and retired as an International Tax Partner from the San Francisco office in 1996. He excelled in mergers and acquisitions of multinational corporations. A close friend from Atlanta once said to him, ""Jay, you are the most brilliant financial architect we shall ever see."" Throughout his career Mr. Gonzalez was an active member of the International Fiscal Association (IFA). The membership of IFA includes over 12,000 professionals residing in 100 countries who specialize in international taxation. From 1994 to 1996, he was the President of the USA Branch of IFA which comprises over 1,100 members. He served as a member of the USA IFA Executive Committee for 10 years. After retiring, he spent much of his time working on Palemi Ranch, his ranch in Northern California, for which he oversaw operations and enjoyed spending time. He is survived by his wife, Lilia G. Gonzalez, of Hillsborough; two daughters, Patricia G. Lange of Culver City, and Leah Jarlsberg of San Mateo, one son Michael of Castro Valley, and two grandchildren, Catherine and Alexander Lange.

He was graduated from independent schools in New York City and in New England and entered Harvard College in September 1942. Four months later, he left Harvard to enlist in the U.S. Navy. At the end of World War II, Shepardson was honorably discharged as Quartermaster First Class. He had served in the Atlantic and Pacific theaters aboard LSTs and had participated in the liberation of the Philippines. He returned to Harvard College and took an AB cum laude degree in June 1949. Some years later he earned an M.A. degree from Univerisity of Colorado, Boulder. Shepardson began his business career in June 1949 in New York City. By September 1952 he had redirected his efforts into oil and gas exploration work and was employed successively by Gulf Oil Corporation, American Metal Climax, Inc., Jenney Oil Company, Kelly and Morey, Inc., Northwest Exploration Company; in 1986 he concluded his career as President, Corrida Oils Inc. From time to time, he was self-employed in various aspects of operations and finance of energy companies. Other business activities also included being a director of the Janus family of mutual funds for over twenty-five years. From 1964 to 1968, the entire Shepardson family began the Wellesley Junior Soccer program and so brought soccer to the Boston Suburbs around Rte. 128. He devoted his later years to research in American History, concentrating on the years 1890-1966 and to ranching on a property he owned jointly with his wife at Three Forks, Montana.

''I'm over asking people if I can take their picture,'' he said. ''Now I just wait for the right moment.'' Indeed, for fashion enthusiasts, the results are rather delicious: up-close shots of editors' shoes; models leaving shows in full hair and makeup; the French Vogue team, photographed walking away from the camera (top). And now Mr. Ton's site, which is regularly updated with photos culled from the hundreds he takes each fashion season, has caught the attention of executives at Lane Crawford, the Asian luxury retailer. Last month, he was tapped to shoot its ad campaign, one previously shot by Inez van Lamsweerde and Vinoodh Matadin. Undoubtedly it was his enthusiasm for fashion that got him the gig."

Financial stocks were especially battered; Bank of America and Citigroup shares plunged by a third as investors feared that growing losses could lead to government takeovers of troubled banks.

It now plans to close an additional seven, and will instead concentrate on its online shop and has recently redesigned its mail order catalog. Mr. Houghton also said that the museum had imposed a hiring freeze and is curtailing staff travel and entertainment as well as the use of temporary employees. It is also in the process of a museum-wide assessment of its expenses to see how it can further reduce costs. Emily Rafferty, the Met’s president, said Monday that “we cannot eliminate the possibility of a head-count reduction.” The museum’s endowment, which provides about 30 percent of its annual operating revenue, has decreased 25 percent since June 30, 2008 to $2.1 billion from $2.8 billion.

2009-02-23T00:00:00Z,"On Saturday, a day before the Academy Awards, the national board of directors of the Screen Actors Guild rejected what studios termed a “last, best and final offer” in the negotiations between the actors’ union and the Alliance of Motion Picture and Television Producers, which represents the studios. (Below, a SAG protester at the Kodak Theater, scene of the Oscars.) Last week the two sides seemed close to an agreement, but the latest offer from the producers included what SAG called a “surprise demand.” The rub lies not so much in the terms of the contract as in its timing. The actors’ union is seeking a three-year contract retroactive to June 2008, when its previous agreement expired. That would mean the new contract would expire at the same time as the studios’ agreements with the American Federation of Television and Radio Artists and the writers’ and directors’ guilds. Concurrent expiration dates would, of course, allow the unions to join forces in 2011 negotiations. The studios’ latest offer, presented on Feb. 19, proposed that the new agreement begin upon ratification and last for three years. The “demand for a new term of agreement extending to 2012 is regressive and damaging,” the guild said in a statement released on Saturday. The union accused the studios of trying “to deleverage our bargaining position from this point forward.” The producers also released a statement, defending their offer as “strong and fair.”."

2009-02-23T00:00:00Z,"LittleBigPlanet, below, the quirky and innovative jumping-and-climbing game published by Sony for the company’s PlayStation 3 console, was the top winner Thursday night at the 12th annual Interactive Achievement Awards in Las Vegas, where it took eight awards, including overall game of the year for 2008. The game beat a slate of heavyweight finalists including Fallout 3, Grand Theft Auto IV, Left 4 Dead and Metal Gear Solid 4: Guns of the Patriots. The acclaim for LittleBigPlanet, which was developed by Media Molecule, could provide a modest boost for the PlayStation 3, which has lagged behind its competitors from Microsoft (the Xbox 360) and Nintendo (the Wii). The Interactive Achievement awards are the video game industry’s equivalent to the Oscars. In addition to the overall game award, LittleBigPlanet took honors for console game of the year, game direction, family game of the year, art direction, visual engineering, character performance and outstanding innovation."

2009-02-24T00:00:00Z,"The very title of its newest show, ''It Started With a Dream: David Zippel -- Lyrics He Wrote, Lyrics He Wishes He Wrote,'' distills the quandary facing the 92nd Street Y's long-running Lyrics and Lyricists series. On and off Broadway, there may be enough talented younger songwriters to fill up a season of programs. But for the longtime subscribers making nostalgic pilgrimages to the shrines of the old masters, today's descendants of the great tradition, no matter how talented, tend to be viewed with a suspicion that borders on indifference. Thus the ''lyrics he wishes he wrote'' addendum to the title (Mr. Zippel, who hosted Saturday's opening-night show, apologized for the grammar) meant the inclusion of a long medley of song fragments, awkwardly stitched together, saluting Mr. Zippel's influences. They included Coleman and Leigh, Bock and Harnick, Rodgers and Hammerstein, Porter, Sondheim and Comden and Green, as well as Laura Nyro and Joni Mitchell. The audience sing-along, a popular fixture of the series, was Irving Berlin's ''I Got the Sun in the Morning.''"

I looked past our exuberant expressions, scrutinizing instead the people and things surrounding us -- a man smoking a water pipe, a waiter tallying a bill, and an umbrella over a table bearing the slogan ''Unlimited Refreshments, Zero Alcohol.''"

2009-02-27T00:00:00Z,"FRIOU Robert Edwin, died on Thursday, February 26, 2009 in Tarrytown, NY after a long and valiant battle with Parkinson's Disease. He was born in 1917 in Brooklyn, NY, the eldest son of the late George Dyson and Lillian Ackerman Friou. He lived in Brooklyn, exempt for summers in Friendship. ME, until he married Alice Regina Hoffman in 1940. He attended Columbia College (B.A. 1938) and Columbia Law School (L.L.B. And J.D. 1940). He served as an attorney for the United States Tax Court in Washington DC until war broke out in 1941, when he volunteered for the US Army. He graduated from the Command and General Staff School in Ft. Leavenworth, Kansas, and became a captain in the US Air Force. After the war, he and his wife moved to Brooklyn Heights, and later to Hackensack, NJ, while he worked for Chadbourne, Parke, Whiteside and Wolff in New York City as head of their Tax Department. In 1957, the family moved to Bethlehem, PA where he was Tax Attorney for Bethlehem Steel Co., and later to Canton, OH, where he was counsel to Herbert Hoover and the vacuum cleaner company named after him. In the early 60s the family moved to North Tarrytown, NY (now called Sleepy Hollow). Robert did litigation, mostly in the bankruptcy field, in New York City and Westchester County. He and his second wife, Elizabeth Bell Friou, moved to Tarrytown in 1995. Friou's proudest and finest achievement was, however, the pro bono work he did for about 15 years after his retirement, helping the poor tenants of the Tarrytowns to keep their homes, and to enlist the landlords' help in keeping them livable. As he used to say, truthfully, he ""never lost a case"", and he was much loved in the Tarrytowns and adjoining villages. For this work he was awarded the New York State Bar Association 1991 President's Pro Bono Service Award for the 9th and 10th Judicial Districts of the State of New York, and was Vice Chair of the American Bar Association Senior Lawyers Division Pro Bono Committee. The New York State Bar Association, in its newspaper to all attorneys in New York State, said: ""Friou's story provides a model for any attorney who might be finishing up one phase of his or her practice."" He himself was quoted as saying about pro bono work: ""What I do now gives me the most pleasure of all the work I have done since my admission (to the Bar) in 1940, and is the most immediately effective on people's lives."" Robert was a man of uncommon abilities, generosity, humor, integrity, loyalty and tenacity, and his life reflected all those qualities. He is survived by his wife; his daughters Jane Clemens and Elisabeth Mote and their husbands; his grandchildren Rebecca Gauthier, David Jr., and Amy Clemens; his three stepsons, Stephen, Richard and Paul, and their families; three siblings, Kenneth, Lillian and Charles (a fourth one, George, died earlier), and their extended families. They and all those who knew him will miss him sorely. Family will receive friends at Coffey Funeral Home, 91 N. Broadway, Tarrytown, NY 10591 Sunday from 3-5pm only. In lieu of flowers, donations to Parkinson's Disease Foundation, 1359 Broadway, Suite 1509, New York, NY 10018 would be appreciated."

Jim RygelskiSt. Louis, Feb. 9, 2009 ● Of course, opinion and false statements are getting more prevalent and will eventually become the norm because of the pressure of bloggers. It is a natural degradation of news journalism. It will get worse, and it is irreversible.Neither you nor anyone else can stop it, because those who will replace you and the other editors will be have been born and raised in the new medium of news where journalistic integrity in the form of accuracy and objectivity is just not that important.This is no different from the rest of human endeavors where such outdated concepts are ridiculed for the sake of expediency and personal gain.John EllzeyAlexandria, Va., Feb. 8, 2009 ● I read an anecdote in Reader's Digest years ago about a craftsman in New England who posted a sign in his shop. It read (and I'm paraphrasing here), ""You can have it good, you can have it cheap, or you can have it fast. You get your choice of two, not all three."" I was reminded of that when I read your column.You discuss the question of accuracy regarding Caroline Kennedy's bid for the Senate seat vacated by Hillary Rodham Clinton. And yet at the end of the column, when discussing Web competition, there's no inclusion of accuracy in the criteria, only speed. You write, ""The Web has no deadlines, just the anxiety that the guy down the street will beat you to the story, and you have to get yours published first.""Accuracy must become a criterion alongside speed, or credibility suffers. The two must be measured simultaneously and have equal status. It matters not one whit if an inaccurate story is later proved false and retracted.Getting a story to print (no matter whether on paper or on screen) solely to be the first to report it does no one any good if the story is later proved false. So please revise the standard to this: Get the accurate story to print first.Dennis M. SteeleMontvale, N.J., Feb. 8, 2009●●Re ""They Still Have the Nixon Tapes to Kick Around"" (Feb. 22): Thank you for addressing the unfortunate front-page article about Stanley I. Kutler and the Nixon tapes. As an Africanist historian, I could not enter the fray. But I have known Mr. Kutler for almost all of the years he has been a professional scholar, and I (along with countless others) can attest to his integrity as well as his competence.Of course we all make mistakes, although in some cases politics have played a role, as is all too obvious in the form of attacks on Mr. Kutler's ""Abuse of Power.""I'm glad you undertook to unravel the circumstances behind the attacks, but I do think that the reporter, Patricia Cohen, should be brought to task for practicing ""gotcha journalism."" The article probably should never have been published, but if making academic arguments more available to the general public is a goal of the weekend editor, then the article should have been refereed in the same way that submissions are reviewed by scholarly journals.Patricia W. RomeroTowson, Md., Feb. 22, 2009The writer, a professor of history at Towson University, is the editor of The Journal of Colonialism and Colonial History."

2009-02-28T00:00:00Z,"ARMITSTEAD--Reverend Austin Herrick, 84, passed away peacefully February 20, 2009 in his home. Reverend Armitstead was born on December 30, 1924 in Nashua, New Hampshire and spent his childhood and teenage years in New England and Pennsylvania before enlisting in the Army in early 1943. Armitstead fought for freedom as an infantryman in the 12th Armored Division seeing action along the Rhine River near Strausburg, France until taken as a prisoner of war in early 1945. After his liberation in April 1945 he returned to the United States and civilian life. He graduated Dickinson College in Carlisle, PA in 1948 and having decided to dedicate his life to the service of God, worked with migrant farm workers from northern Florida through northern New York before enrolling in Union Theological Seminary in New York City where he was awarded a Masters of Divinity in 1952. He married his wife, Bianca Audrey Potz-Nielsen in 1951 and the couple began a lifetime of ministry together. Reverend Armitstead was an elder in the New York Conference of the United Methodist Church and served pastorates in Hauppauge, Commack and Center Moriches on Long Island, Bay Ridge Methodist Church in Brooklyn, Faith United Methodist Church on Staten Island and Community United Methodist Church in Jackson Heights, Queens where he established a four language church bringing a diverse community together in service to God. Upon his retirement in 1994, he served as a Community Liaison for the Western Queens Gazette and offered his personal ministry through his photographic works. In addition to his pastoral responsibilities Armitstead was also a leader and advocate for social change and justice in each of his stops along life's path. He was an early and vocal advocate for racial integration and equality and also worked tirelessly in the cause of ecumenicalism and community responsibility upon the part of the churches he served. He held positions as President, Vice-President or Chairman on a number of boards in New York including the Salvation Army, American Red Cross, Police Community Relations, Staten Island Council of Churches, Brooklyn United Methodist Church Home, Jackson Heights Community Development, sheltered New York City homeless, served the New York City Police and Fire Departments in a number of ways, and served on numerous task forces of New York City Mayors, improving the lives of thousands. His passion for championing the underdog was also evident in his life-long love of baseball as he was an avid New York Mets fan and attended nearly a thousand ball games at Shea Stadium in Queens. Perhaps fitting, Armitstead died only a few days after the last remaining piece of that ballpark was leveled. He was an honorary lifetime member of the Baseball Hall of Fame. Due to declining health, Armitstead and his wife moved to Suffolk in the summer of 2007 where he lived out his life close to family. Reverend Armitstead is survived by his wife of over 57 years, Bianca Audrey Potz-Nielsen Armitstead; one daughter, Nancy Armitstead of New York City; two sons, Alan Jackson Armitstead (wife, Petra) of Suffolk and John Auman Armitstead (wife, Ima) of Lexington, Kentucky; two brothers, Donald M. Armitstead of Seattle, WA and Dr. Paul T. Armitstead of Waco, TX; and five grandchildren, Christian, Jaclyn, Michael, Steven and Jonathan. A memorial service will be held on Friday, February 27, at 11am in Sturtevant Funeral Home, Bennetts Creek Chapel, Suffolk celebrated by the Reverend Bob Weeks of Aldersgate United Methodist Church. Ground committal will be in the Albert G. Horton, Jr. Memorial Veterans Cemetery also in Suffolk.

2009-02-28T00:00:00Z,"Sumner M. Redstone, the media mogul who controls Viacom and CBS, reached a deal with banks that gives him two more years to pay down $1.46 billion in debt without having to sell more stock in either company, the family holding company, National Amusements, said. Mr. Redstone has been under financial strain since October, when he breached the terms of his loans and was forced to sell more than $200 million in stock. The covenants of the bank loans were tied to the value of CBS and Viacom shares, which fell sharply in the fall, causing Mr. Redstone's problems. The deal to restructure the debt is expected to close by the end of March, and at that time, National Amusements, which holds the debt, said it would make a payment of more than $100 million. That will leave National Amusements with about $1.46 billion in debt, which will come due in December 2010. The loans previously came due last December."

The priest, Emmanuel Rukundo, 50, left, a Hutu extremist, on at least four occasions betrayed Tutsi refugees hiding in a seminary to soldiers, who subsequently killed them, the court said. The tribunal had earlier handed life sentences for genocide to two other Hutu priests. Clergy members were both perpetrators and victims of the 1994 genocide. Ten priests, two bishops and the archbishop of Kigali were held captive and killed by Tutsi rebel soldiers, now part of the Rwandan Army.

2009-02-28T00:00:00Z,"Remember when the Washington Redskins gave fiscal and free-agent restraint a try? Apparently, that model for franchise building was so last year, and last year was not a particularly good one for the Redskins. So early Friday morning, the Redskins' owner, Daniel Snyder, reverted to form, doing a cannonball into the free-agency pool by signing defensive tackle Albert Haynesworth, the top prize of the free agents, to a seven-year contract worth a potential $100 million. The deal is expected to pay Haynesworth $32 million in the first 13 months. The Redskins scooped up the 27-year-old Haynesworth, who spent his first seven seasons with Tennessee, only hours after free agency opened Friday. His signing came not long after Washington signed cornerback DeAngelo Hall to another lavish deal, a six-year contract that includes $22.5 million guaranteed. Hall joined the Redskins in the middle of the 2008 season and boosted their struggling defense."

2009-02-28T00:00:00Z,"FRIOU Robert Edwin, died on Thursday, February 26, 2009 in Tarrytown, NY after a long and valiant battle with Parkinson's Disease. He was born in 1917 in Brooklyn, NY, the eldest son of the late George Dyson and Lillian Ackerman Friou. He lived in Brooklyn, exempt for summers in Friendship. ME, until he married Alice Regina Hoffman in 1940. He attended Columbia College (B.A. 1938) and Columbia Law School (L.L.B. And J.D. 1940). He served as an attorney for the United States Tax Court in Washington DC until war broke out in 1941, when he volunteered for the US Army. He graduated from the Command and General Staff School in Ft. Leavenworth, Kansas, and became a captain in the US Air Force. After the war, he and his wife moved to Brooklyn Heights, and later to Hackensack, NJ, while he worked for Chadbourne, Parke, Whiteside and Wolff in New York City as head of their Tax Department. In 1957, the family moved to Bethlehem, PA where he was Tax Attorney for Bethlehem Steel Co., and later to Canton, OH, where he was counsel to Herbert Hoover and the vacuum cleaner company named after him. In the early 60s the family moved to North Tarrytown, NY (now called Sleepy Hollow). Robert did litigation, mostly in the bankruptcy field, in New York City and Westchester County. He and his second wife, Elizabeth Bell Friou, moved to Tarrytown in 1995. Friou's proudest and finest achievement was, however, the pro bono work he did for about 15 years after his retirement, helping the poor tenants of the Tarrytowns to keep their homes, and to enlist the landlords' help in keeping them livable. As he used to say, truthfully, he ""never lost a case"", and he was much loved in the Tarrytowns and adjoining villages. For this work he was awarded the New York State Bar Association 1991 President's Pro Bono Service Award for the 9th and 10th Judicial Districts of the State of New York, and was Vice Chair of the American Bar Association Senior Lawyers Division Pro Bono Committee. The New York State Bar Association, in its newspaper to all attorneys in New York State, said: ""Friou's story provides a model for any attorney who might be finishing up one phase of his or her practice."" He himself was quoted as saying about pro bono work: ""What I do now gives me the most pleasure of all the work I have done since my admission (to the Bar) in 1940, and is the most immediately effective on people's lives."" Robert was a man of uncommon abilities, generosity, humor, integrity, loyalty and tenacity, and his life reflected all those qualities. He is survived by his wife; his daughters Jane Clemens and Elisabeth Mote and their husbands; his grandchildren Rebecca Gauthier, David Jr., and Amy Clemens; his three stepsons, Stephen, Richard and Paul, and their families; three siblings, Kenneth, Lillian and Charles (a fourth one, George, died earlier), and their extended families. They and all those who knew him will miss him sorely. Family will receive friends at Coffey Funeral Home, 91 N. Broadway, Tarrytown, NY 10591 Sunday from 3-5pm only. In lieu of flowers, donations to Parkinson's Disease Foundation, 1359 Broadway, Suite 1509, New York, NY 10018 would be appreciated."

In addition to his pastoral responsibilities Armitstead was also a leader and advocate for social change and justice in each of his stops along life's path. He was an early and vocal advocate for racial integration and equality and also worked tirelessly in the cause of ecumenicalism and community responsibility upon the part of the churches he served. He held positions as President, Vice-President or Chairman on a number of boards in New York including the Salvation Army, American Red Cross, Police Community Relations, Staten Island Council of Churches, Brooklyn United Methodist Church Home, Jackson Heights Community Development, sheltered New York City homeless, served the New York City Police and Fire Departments in a number of ways, and served on numerous task forces of New York City Mayors, improving the lives of thousands. His passion for championing the underdog was also evident in his life-long love of baseball as he was an avid New York Mets fan and attended nearly a thousand ball games at Shea Stadium in Queens. Perhaps fitting, Armitstead died only a few days after the last remaining piece of that ballpark was leveled. He was an honorary lifetime member of the Baseball Hall of Fame. Due to declining health, Armitstead and his wife moved to Suffolk in the summer of 2007 where he lived out his life close to family. Reverend Armitstead is survived by his wife of over 57 years, Bianca Audrey Potz-Nielsen Armitstead; one daughter, Nancy Armitstead of New York City; two sons, Alan Jackson Armitstead (wife, Petra) of Suffolk and John Auman Armitstead (wife, Ima) of Lexington, Kentucky; two brothers, Donald M. Armitstead of Seattle, WA and Dr. Paul T. Armitstead of Waco, TX; and five grandchildren, Christian, Jaclyn, Michael, Steven and Jonathan. A memorial service will be held on Friday, February 27, at 11am in Sturtevant Funeral Home, Bennetts Creek Chapel, Suffolk celebrated by the Reverend Bob Weeks of Aldersgate United Methodist Church. Ground committal will be in the Albert G. Horton, Jr. Memorial Veterans Cemetery also in Suffolk. Contributions in lieu of flowers should be made to your local church, hospice, food bank, the Salvation Army or Red Cross. www.SturtevantFuneralHome. com"

2009-02-28T00:00:00Z,"FRIOU Robert Edwin, died on Thursday, February 26, 2009 in Tarrytown, NY after a long and valiant battle with Parkinson's Disease. He was born in 1917 in Brooklyn, NY, the eldest son of the late George Dyson and Lillian Ackerman Friou. He lived in Brooklyn, exempt for summers in Friendship. ME, until he married Alice Regina Hoffman in 1940. He attended Columbia College (B.A. 1938) and Columbia Law School (L.L.B. And J.D. 1940). He served as an attorney for the United States Tax Court in Washington DC until war broke out in 1941, when he volunteered for the US Army. He graduated from the Command and General Staff School in Ft. Leavenworth, Kansas, and became a captain in the US Air Force. After the war, he and his wife moved to Brooklyn Heights, and later to Hackensack, NJ, while he worked for Chadbourne, Parke, Whiteside and Wolff in New York City as head of their Tax Department. In 1957, the family moved to Bethlehem, PA where he was Tax Attorney for Bethlehem Steel Co., and later to Canton, OH, where he was counsel to Herbert Hoover and the vacuum cleaner company named after him. In the early 60s the family moved to North Tarrytown, NY (now called Sleepy Hollow). Robert did litigation, mostly in the bankruptcy field, in New York City and Westchester County. He and his second wife, Elizabeth Bell Friou, moved to Tarrytown in 1995. Friou's proudest and finest achievement was, however, the pro bono work he did for about 15 years after his retirement, helping the poor tenants of the Tarrytowns to keep their homes, and to enlist the landlords' help in keeping them livable. As he used to say, truthfully, he ""never lost a case"", and he was much loved in the Tarrytowns and adjoining villages. For this work he was awarded the New York State Bar Association 1991 President's Pro Bono Service Award for the 9th and 10th Judicial Districts of the State of New York, and was Vice Chair of the American Bar Association Senior Lawyers Division Pro Bono Committee. The New York State Bar Association, in its newspaper to all attorneys in New York State, said: ""Friou's story provides a model for any attorney who might be finishing up one phase of his or her practice."" He himself was quoted as saying about pro bono work: ""What I do now gives me the most pleasure of all the work I have done since my admission (to the Bar) in 1940, and is the most immediately effective on people's lives."" Robert was a man of uncommon abilities, generosity, humor, integrity, loyalty and tenacity, and his life reflected all those qualities. He is survived by his wife; his daughters Jane Clemens and Elisabeth Mote and their husbands; his grandchildren Rebecca Gauthier, David Jr., and Amy Clemens; his three stepsons, Stephen, Richard and Paul, and their families; three siblings, Kenneth, Lillian and Charles (a fourth one, George, died earlier), and their extended families. They and all those who knew him will miss him sorely. Family will receive friends at Coffey Funeral Home, 91 N. Broadway, Tarrytown, NY 10591 Sunday from 3-5pm only. In lieu of flowers, donations to Parkinson's Disease Foundation, 1359 Broadway, Suite 1509, New York, NY 10018 would be appreciated."

It just makes good sense for a company known for coats to put its name and craft behind a limited-edition group that is impeccably done-and worth, I think, the price. There are 17 styles in the line, all with a strong sense of fashion (not your humble classic), in fabrics like wool, alpaca, camel's hair and a luscious black and white tweed that has been embroidered in black on the skirt of the coat. There are also evening styles, including one in deep red with three-quarter sleeves and rosettes on the collar. Laura Lusuardi, the company's chief designer, pointed out the hand finishing and silk linings-all done in Max Mara's factories. At a time when many fashion houses are under economic pressures, making something that really employs top skills must have been a source of pride. The coats are quite shapely-barrel-shaped, A-lined, others with a defined waist. Here and there is a whiff of early Balenciaga. Max Mara plans to have the coats, priced from about $1,500 to $3,000, in five of its U.S. stores, including the Madison Avenue shop, Chicago and Beverly Hills. And the company has produced opera-length gloves in different colors to go with the three-quarter sleeve models."

2009-03-01T06:54:56Z,"The fine points of a very good Marni show this morning included boxy jackets in black felt and rather cozy-droopy pants balanced somewhere between leggings and sweats. One pair combined a gray knit with a murky plaid fabric. Consuelo Castiglioni's collection had a strong practical streak, with slightly oversized jackets, tunic dresses in grid-like jacquard checks, a felted wool coat with a grid of pockets, and a dark, woodsy, masculine palette. Some of the wool skirts were great: straight, just above the knee, with a same-color panel in a different fabric at the back. She showed tights and knee socks in a muted checkered pattern, and cone-heel pumps or strappy platform sandals in a three-way color mix. The collection worked in part because of the large number of desirable separates and in part because of Castiglioni's sophisticated interpretation of tactile fabrics, shine, and adornment. Barnacles of black sequins and stones appeared on a purple felt coat. Neck pieces were a craft project of felt-encrusted stones and other materials. Where's my glue gun? Pale, round sunglasses had colored mirror lenses."

While Ms. Conlin accurately described some of the efforts visible to cruisers, she veered off course when it came to environmental initiatives below deck. Ms. Conlin failed to report, among other things, that air emissions are regulated and that our industry is exploring new technologies to further reduce emissions; that our ships treat all blackwater; and that advanced wastewater purification systems discharge water cleaner than most municipal water treatment plants.

2009-03-01T00:00:00Z,"100 DAYS In early March 1969, after aides complained they had not yet met the new president, the national security adviser, Henry Kissinger, arranged for Richard Nixon to talk to his National Security Council staff, of which I was a holdover from the Johnson administration. There were only 20 or so of us there, less than a quarter the size of the mini-foreign ministry the council would become under Kissinger and later administrations. We gathered expectantly in the Cabinet Room, hoping for some personal impression of the man now in the Oval Office. We were not disappointed. Nixon walked in, tanned and smiling after a weekend in Florida, though typically ill at ease as he moved through quick handshake introductions. He began brief remarks with self-conscious ingratiation, commiserating with the staff for having to deal with what he called ''all those impossible fags'' in the State Department, oblivious that most in the room were Foreign Service officers on temporary assignment. ''Ignore the bureaucrats,'' he told them after a swift, fluent rundown of international trouble spots. ''I want you to handle the rest of the world.'' Turning to Kissinger, he added softly, in what seemed as much an intimacy as a boast, ''And you and I will end the war.''"

''Obviously, the U.K. government has quite a few dealings with the U.S. government. I had a series of meetings, which were in back-to-back weeks. So I ended up staying for a weekend. Rather than sitting in a hotel room, giving the government another day of free overtime, I took an invitation to go skiing at Mammoth Mountain. It makes a big difference -- particularly in such a beautiful part of the United States -- to be able to take the opportunity to get out into the mountains. I really love skiing. My wife and I try to go twice during the winter, usually to the Alps, in France. Obviously it was November, early in the season. The snow wasn't the best -- to be honest, it was a bit icy and scraped in areas. But you can't complain in November if you can ski from the top to the bottom of a mountain.''

2009-03-01T00:00:00Z,"PRESS--Billie Kallick, died February 12, 2009, in Washington, DC, of heart failure after a long illness. An educator, Billie Press was an early post-Sputnik visitor to the USSR, accompanying her husband, geophysicist Frank Press (later science adviser to President Jimmy Carter and President of the National Academy of Sciences) during International Geophysical Year 1957-8 to Moscow when such visits were still quite rare. Returning home to Pasadena, CA, she argued successfully for one of the first ''Gifted Child'' programs that became a part of the public response to Sputnik. She founded and directed such a program in the Pasadena City Schools 1962-65, which involved training 250 teachers. At the same time that Sputnik was galvanizing a broad response in the US, universal education in the Soviet Union under Khrushchev had been cut from 10 years to 8, with only 10% going on to higher education. Billie appreciated the irony of this, publishing an article quoting her interview with a high Soviet official, ''It is bad policy to educate so many people beyond the stations they will occupy in life.'' Of course Billie didn't agree with this one bit! Obtaining her doctorate in 1968, she went on to found the HomeBased Early Childhood Education program in the Cambridge, MA, public schools, a kind of ''each one teach one'' in which economically disadvantaged mothers themselves became trained and employed as home visitors to other disadvantaged families, bringing books and educational materials into the homes of toddlers. She later taught at Salem State College and Lesley College, and was, in Washington, DC, a specialist in HEW's Bureau of Elementary and Secondary Education (1978-79). Born October 15, 1925, in St. Louis, MO, Billie grew up in Brooklyn, NY, the daughter of New York Times compositor and proofreader William Kallick and Mary Enders Kallick. Attending Samuel J. Tilden High School, she qualified for a full scholarship to NYU, where she graduated in 1946, marrying Frank Press (her highschool sweetheart) the same month. She is survived by her husband, her children William Press of Austin, TX, and Paula Press of Chapel Hill, NC, 2 grandchildren and 2 greatgrandchildren."

It echoed through the immense Chamber of the Great Council, where 2,000 Venetian noblemen once directed the course of their empire beneath Tintoretto's immense ''Vision of Paradise.'' It carried up the intricate, gilt-encrusted stucco carvings of the Golden Staircase to the doge's own apartments. It pealed out even into the Piazza San Marco, whose paving stones were slicked a shiny gray from persistent drizzle. The cry disturbed visitors and guards alike, perhaps reminding them of the days when prisoners, denounced in secret and tried without mercy, were dragged across the Bridge of Sighs to meet sour, inescapable fates.

2009-03-01T00:00:00Z,"FRIOU Robert Edwin, died on Thursday, February 26, 2009 in Tarrytown, NY after a long and valiant battle with Parkinson's Disease. He was born in 1917 in Brooklyn, NY, the eldest son of the late George Dyson and Lillian Ackerman Friou. He lived in Brooklyn, exempt for summers in Friendship. ME, until he married Alice Regina Hoffman in 1940. He attended Columbia College (B.A. 1938) and Columbia Law School (L.L.B. And J.D. 1940). He served as an attorney for the United States Tax Court in Washington DC until war broke out in 1941, when he volunteered for the US Army. He graduated from the Command and General Staff School in Ft. Leavenworth, Kansas, and became a captain in the US Air Force. After the war, he and his wife moved to Brooklyn Heights, and later to Hackensack, NJ, while he worked for Chadbourne, Parke, Whiteside and Wolff in New York City as head of their Tax Department. In 1957, the family moved to Bethlehem, PA where he was Tax Attorney for Bethlehem Steel Co., and later to Canton, OH, where he was counsel to Herbert Hoover and the vacuum cleaner company named after him. In the early 60s the family moved to North Tarrytown, NY (now called Sleepy Hollow). Robert did litigation, mostly in the bankruptcy field, in New York City and Westchester County. He and his second wife, Elizabeth Bell Friou, moved to Tarrytown in 1995. Friou's proudest and finest achievement was, however, the pro bono work he did for about 15 years after his retirement, helping the poor tenants of the Tarrytowns to keep their homes, and to enlist the landlords' help in keeping them livable. As he used to say, truthfully, he ""never lost a case"", and he was much loved in the Tarrytowns and adjoining villages. For this work he was awarded the New York State Bar Association 1991 President's Pro Bono Service Award for the 9th and 10th Judicial Districts of the State of New York, and was Vice Chair of the American Bar Association Senior Lawyers Division Pro Bono Committee. The New York State Bar Association, in its newspaper to all attorneys in New York State, said: ""Friou's story provides a model for any attorney who might be finishing up one phase of his or her practice."" He himself was quoted as saying about pro bono work: ""What I do now gives me the most pleasure of all the work I have done since my admission (to the Bar) in 1940, and is the most immediately effective on people's lives."" Robert was a man of uncommon abilities, generosity, humor, integrity, loyalty and tenacity, and his life reflected all those qualities. He is survived by his wife; his daughters Jane Clemens and Elisabeth Mote and their husbands; his grandchildren Rebecca Gauthier, David Jr., and Amy Clemens; his three stepsons, Stephen, Richard and Paul, and their families; three siblings, Kenneth, Lillian and Charles (a fourth one, George, died earlier), and their extended families. They and all those who knew him will miss him sorely. Family will receive friends at Coffey Funeral Home, 91 N. Broadway, Tarrytown, NY 10591 Sunday from 3-5pm only. In lieu of flowers, donations to Parkinson's Disease Foundation, 1359 Broadway, Suite 1509, New York, NY 10018 would be appreciated."

As a member of Einstein's founding faculty, Dr. Seifter helped to establish the College of Medicine as a leading institution for medical education and biomedical research both nationally and internationally. During 50 years of devoted service to the medical school he fulfilled a multitude of roles, including 11 years as chairman of biochemistry. He also was instrumental in establishing the College's scientific journal, Einstein Quarterly (now Einstein Journal of Biology and Medicine), for which he was faculty advisor and chairman of the editorial board. A world-renowned biochemist, best known for his studies of collagen and immunology, he set the standards for conscientious scientific exploration, collegial collaboration, and inspirational humanity. Since 1991, an annual lecture on minority issues, named in his honor, has recognized his ''unremitting efforts in the cause of social justice, particularly as it relates to medical education and scientific research.'' A teacher par excellence, he was a mentor to countless students and colleagues who remember him most fondly for his indefatigable curiosity and his great warmth and kindness in helping others in their quests for greater knowledge. His merit as a mentor was widely celebrated, including a Life Teaching Award from Einstein. His example as the finest of scientists, teachers, and human beings will be his legacy.

He often managed to teach something, even in casual conversations, and it was likely to be an obscure but surprisingly interesting lesson delivered with wry wit. Hating hypocrisy, he was a passionate scientist, firmly dedicated to that which could be proven. He was wary of religion and politics, and he delighted in extracting the weird from both real and pseudo news sources. He would send the ""news"" items around, and then thoroughly enjoy any debate he stirred up. He was a man of cultivated tastes, with a love of foreign cuisines, a keen ear for music and an equally keen eye for art. Briefly, he was not only a collector, but also a dealer in graphics, during which time he turned his wife Elizabeth's childhood nickname, Tizbo, into the lofty sounding ""Gallerie Tizbeau"" for business dealings. He abandoned the gallery idea, but remained a connoisseur, amassing over many years a stunning collection of 19th and 20th century European and American graphics. Born December 7, 1936 in New York City, he grew up in Washington, DC and Kent, Ohio, where his father was Head of the Chemistry Department at Kent State University. His mother, Myra Waterman Thompson, was once a reporter for The New York Times. Hugh graduated from Cornell University with Honors in 1958, and received his Ph.D. from M.I.T. in 1963. An N.I.H. postdoctoral fellowship at Columbia University followed, and in 1964 he married Elizabeth Anne Barnes on the terrace of her aunt's villa on the French Riviera. Hugh's entire professional career was in the Chemistry Department at Rutgers, Newark, where he was variously Chair of the department, Director of the graduate program, mentor to countless graduate and undergraduate Chemistry students, and author of over 130 research papers in the areas of synthetic, structural, and dynamic organic chemistry and on hydrogen-bonding in the crystalline state. He was a member of the American Chemical Society. He is survived by his wife, Elizabeth Barnes Thompson of Manhattan, his daughter, Victoria Thompson of Washington, D.C., and his brother, Geoffrey Thompson of Mountain View, CA. A Memorial Service will be held at a later date. Hugh's family requests that in lieu of flowers, donations be made to Rutgers University c/o Chemistry Dept., 73 Warren St., Newark, NJ 07102."

But a dispute over money has at least temporarily brought a halt to her Comedy Central series, “The Sarah Silverman Program,” The Hollywood Reporter said. Ms. Silverman and her fellow executive producers on the show, Dan Sterling and Rob Schrab, have threatened to quit the program over proposed budget cuts. Comedy Central, which has not yet given an official order for a third season of the show, wants to reduce its budget to $850,000 an episode, down from $1.1 million an episode, amid cost-cutting at the network and throughout the entertainment business; Ms. Silverman and her producers would obviously prefer the larger figure.

The play, a comedy called “England People Very Nice,” chronicles 300 years of immigration patterns in the London neighborhood of Bethnal Green, as the area is inhabited by French Huguenots, Irish, Jews and Bangladeshis. During a talk at the theater given by Mr. Bean, Hussain Ismail, a playwright, and Keith Kinsella, a teacher, took to the stage carrying placards, objecting to what they said were racist depictions of ethnic groups in the play. “Richard Bean is making it seem like all Bangladeshis are drug dealers or users, muggers and marry their cousins,” Mr. Ismail said, according to the BBC. Nicholas Hytner, the director of the National Theater, told the BBC that the play “clearly sets out to demonstrate that all forms of racism are equally ridiculous.”"

Bustiers, push-ups, underwires -- whatever it took to get that Italian showgirl silhouette. Lots of ruching, draping, beading and plenty of lip liner, tinted eyewear and python skin as second skin. Clothing coverage diminished as the night wore on and the unclad masses infiltrated the exclusive dinner.Drinks: The evening began with Mumm's champagne served on silver platters by white-gloved waiters. Later, Cavalli's own Tenuta dei Dei (2006) was served.Décor: Huge lanterns and massive banquettes blanketed with Cavalli's own floral printed silks and more roses than the gardens of Valentino's French chateau.Music: Opera during the cocktail hour; the British singer Malde May backed up by a live five-piece jazz band during dinner. The Italian journalist Jo Squillo was so taken that she parked her dinner chair in the middle of the dance floor and tapped the evening away alone. Cavalli acted as house paparazzo and snapped everyone in sight.Food: Bacon-wrapped shrimp, pici pasta with thyme, fennel-crusted branzino. Then they stopped serving because no one could take the fourth lamb course.Gift: Iridescent python credit card holder.Perks: White-coated waiters outnumbered guests. At 11 p.m. the dinner turned into a multilevel rager with hundreds of hotties dancing in the dark.Overheard:""The best thing about the credit card is that you get to be friends with me. Good clients will get access to me online where we can chat. I love Facebook!"" -- Roberto Cavalli"

(The government raised the tax in 1997 over the objection of many economists in an attempt to reduce growing budget deficits.)."

During a talk at the theater given by Mr. Bean, Hussain Ismail, a playwright, and Keith Kinsella, a teacher, took to the stage carrying placards, objecting to what they said were racist depictions of ethnic groups in the play. “Richard Bean is making it seem like all Bangladeshis are drug dealers or users, muggers and marry their cousins,” Mr. Ismail said, according to the BBC. Nicholas Hytner, the director of the National Theater, told the BBC that the play “clearly sets out to demonstrate that all forms of racism are equally ridiculous.”."

2009-03-03T00:00:00Z,"For decades, psychologists have warned against giving children prizes or money for their performance in school. ''Extrinsic'' rewards, they say -- a stuffed animal for a 4-year-old who learns her alphabet, cash for a good report card in middle or high school -- can undermine the joy of learning for its own sake and can even lead to cheating. But many economists and businesspeople disagree, and their views often prevail in the educational marketplace. Reward programs that pay students are under way in many cities. In some places, students can bring home hundreds of dollars for, say, taking an Advanced Placement course and scoring well on the exam."

Maddie was an outstanding woman whose kindness and generosity touched many, many people. Operation Mend is only the latest example of how she and Ron touched so many lives. On a recent visit to the program in Los Angeles, Intrepid leadership saw first-hand how the program, which provides advanced reconstructive surgery to military personnel with severe facial injuries, gives new hope to dozens of affected troops and their families where there was none and highlights how, when citizens care, nothing can stand in the way of how America shows its gratitude to our troops - something so important to the Katz Family. Maddie and Ron have worked miracles for them and so many others. Her loss is indeed a great loss for the charitable world, but she will remain a wonderful example of how one can answer the call to help others in need.

2009-03-04T08:41:15Z,What we’re reading (and watching) on Wednesday morning.
2009-03-04T09:31:41Z,"The antiques collector who says he placed the winning bid for two disputed bronze sculptures and refuses to pay for them acted without the support of the Chinese government, Bloomberg News reported. Cai Mingchao, a collector and auctioneer, said he had submitted the two winning $18 million bids for the bronze heads of a rat and a rabbit; the Qing dynasty sculptures were looted in the 1800s from an imperial palace outside Beijing, and were “bought” last week in Paris at a Christie’s auction of the Yves Saint Laurent collection. But Mr. Cai has said he will not pay for the works out of patriotic duty, prompting speculation that the Chinese government, which has demanded that France return the objects to China, had encouraged or pressured him to do so. In a report in China’s state-run Xinhua news service, an official from China’s State Administration of Cultural Heritage said that Mr. Cai had acted alone. At a press conference, Li Zhaoxing, the spokesman of China’s legislature, said, “The auction will not add anything positive to the good tradition of the country in which it was hosted. It will only have the opposite effect,” according to Bloomberg."
2009-03-04T11:07:52Z,"Three co-defendants of Anthony Pellicano, the former Los Angeles private investigator who was convicted of wiretapping and charges related to racketeering, were sentenced Tuesday for their roles in his operations, The Associated Press reported. Mr. Pellicano, who in May was found guilty of federal charges for conspiring to wiretap and intimidate celebrities and executives, and in August was convicted of wiretapping the ex-wife of the investor Kirk Kerkorian in a child-support case, was sentenced in December to 15 years in prison. Mark Arneson, a former sergeant in the Los Angeles Police Department, and Rayford Earl Turner, a former telephone technician were each sentenced to 10 years in federal prison, following their convictions for federal racketeering and racketeering conspiracy counts in May. Abner Nicherie, an entrepreneur who had hired Mr. Pellicano, was sentenced to 21 months in prison for aiding and abetting a wiretap."
2009-03-04T11:21:00Z,"Having solicited the votes of theatergoers, the creators and producers of the Broadway musical “Avenue Q” said that George W. Bush would stay on — as part of a lyric in the show. In December, the puppet musical announced a contest seeking a replacement lyric for the song “For Now,” in which its protagonists are told that many things in life (including then-President Bush) are “only for now.” After substituting phrases like “recession,” “your mother-in-law,” and “this show” during performances, the show’s writers Robert Lopez, Jeff Marx and Jeff Whitty have changed the lyric to, “George Bush was only for now.” (When the “Avenue Q” tour plays California, the lyric will be changed to “Prop 8 is only for now.”) In a statement, Mr. Whitty said that during the tryout period “we discovered there is nothing like the strong response the Bush line gets from the audience.”"

Also this week, the Virginia metal band Lamb of God‘s new release, “Wrath” (Epic), reached No. 2 with 68,000 sales, and the Jonas Brothers‘ “3D Concert Experience” (Hollywood), the soundtrack to their new concert film, opened at No. 3 with 50,000. As with the film, which opened last weekend, the album fell far short of industry sales expectations. With a boost from eight wins at the Academy Awards, the “Slumdog Millionaire” soundtrack (Interscope) moved 44,000 copies, reaching No. 4, and Nickelback’s “Dark Horse” (Roadrunner) is No. 5 with 41,000."

2009-03-04T00:00:00Z,"ARMITSTEAD--Reverend Austin Herrick, 84, passed away peacefully February 20, 2009 in his home. Reverend Armitstead was born on December 30, 1924 in Nashua, New Hampshire and spent his childhood and teenage years in New England and Pennsylvania before enlisting in the Army in early 1943. Armitstead fought for freedom as an infantryman in the 12th Armored Division seeing action along the Rhine River near Strausburg, France until taken as a prisoner of war in early 1945. After his liberation in April 1945 he returned to the United States and civilian life. He graduated Dickinson College in Carlisle, PA in 1948 and having decided to dedicate his life to the service of God, worked with migrant farm workers from northern Florida through northern New York before enrolling in Union Theological Seminary in New York City where he was awarded a Masters of Divinity in 1952. He married his wife, Bianca Audrey Potz-Nielsen in 1951 and the couple began a lifetime of ministry together. Reverend Armitstead was an elder in the New York Conference of the United Methodist Church and served pastorates in Hauppauge, Commack and Center Moriches on Long Island, Bay Ridge Methodist Church in Brooklyn, Faith United Methodist Church on Staten Island and Community United Methodist Church in Jackson Heights, Queens where he established a four language church bringing a diverse community together in service to God. Upon his retirement in 1994, he served as a Community Liaison for the Western Queens Gazette and offered his personal ministry through his photographic works. In addition to his pastoral responsibilities Armitstead was also a leader and advocate for social change and justice in each of his stops along life's path. He was an early and vocal advocate for racial integration and equality and also worked tirelessly in the cause of ecumenicalism and community responsibility upon the part of the churches he served. He held positions as President, Vice-President or Chairman on a number of boards in New York including the Salvation Army, American Red Cross, Police Community Relations, Staten Island Council of Churches, Brooklyn United Methodist Church Home, Jackson Heights Community Development, sheltered New York City homeless, served the New York City Police and Fire Departments in a number of ways, and served on numerous task forces of New York City Mayors, improving the lives of thousands. His passion for championing the underdog was also evident in his life-long love of baseball as he was an avid New York Mets fan and attended nearly a thousand ball games at Shea Stadium in Queens. Perhaps fitting, Armitstead died only a few days after the last remaining piece of that ballpark was leveled. He was an honorary lifetime member of the Baseball Hall of Fame. Due to declining health, Armitstead and his wife moved to Suffolk in the summer of 2007 where he lived out his life close to family. Reverend Armitstead is survived by his wife of over 57 years, Bianca Audrey Potz-Nielsen Armitstead; one daughter, Nancy Armitstead of New York City; two sons, Alan Jackson Armitstead (wife, Petra) of Suffolk and John Auman Armitstead (wife, Ima) of Lexington, Kentucky; two brothers, Donald M. Armitstead of Seattle, WA and Dr. Paul T. Armitstead of Waco, TX; and five grandchildren, Christian, Jaclyn, Michael, Steven and Jonathan. A memorial service will be held on Friday, February 27, at 11am in Sturtevant Funeral Home, Bennetts Creek Chapel, Suffolk celebrated by the Reverend Bob Weeks of Aldersgate United Methodist Church. Ground committal will be in the Albert G. Horton, Jr. Memorial Veterans Cemetery also in Suffolk.

Kristen Stewart, the star of the “Twilight” movies, has previously been announced to play the band mate Joan Jett (who went on to solo stardom with “I Love Rock N’ Roll”).

To the partners and staff of the firm he became a good friend. His warmth and good humor is remembered even by those who didn't know him that well.

John joined Citrin Cooperman & Company, LLP, after serving as the chief financial officer of The Coastal Group, a Manhattan-based advertising agency, for the previous six years. He began his career at a mid-sized regional accounting firm, and later co-founded Saltzer Lassar Piccinnini & Co., LLC, where he was a senior partner.

They are finding that even the shortest of skis and the smallest of boots can be very expensive. But now, there are devices to help teach children to ski as soon as they are able to walk -- without intimidating bank accounts. For a fraction of the cost of Alpine systems that anchor tiny heels to skis with rigid boots and bindings, a new generation of toddler skis slip right over regular boots so children can become familiar with the sliding sensation."

On Wednesday, one of those obstacles was overcome. Warner, who had made clear before free agency that he did not want to play elsewhere (a bit of candor that most likely did not help his bargaining position), agreed to a two-year, $23 million contract with the Cardinals. The deal, which will pay Warner $19 million in guaranteed money in 2009, including a $15 million signing bonus, assures that he will be the starting quarterback for at least 2009 and probably 2010 and that he will almost certainly finish his career with the Cardinals."

Hughley Breaks the News” was billed as a Saturday-night talk show tied to the week’s news. The show averaged 750,000 viewers and was taped in front of a studio audience in New York.

Bruce Joel Rubin, who won an Academy Award for the original screenplay, will write the book and lyrics, and Dave Stewart and Glen Ballard will write music and lyrics; Matthew Warchus (Broadway’s coming “God of Carnage”) will direct. No casting or theater was announced. A musical version of the romantic comedy “Sleepless in Seattle,” planned for Broadway in 2010, was announced earlier this week.BONUS: Janet Maslin’s Times review of “Ghost” (“Current Hollywood thinking extends into the next world, but not very far”) can be found here."

Surprisingly, the United Nations reacted with rather more vigor than the Obama administration, especially at first.

In contrast, the initial State Department comment was pathetic, although it was strengthened to a condemnation on Friday. Obama, Biden, Clinton were all tough on Darfur when they were in the Senate and when they were running for office, so let's hope they aren't backing down now that they are in office."

2009-03-07T20:44:50Z,"For any number of reasons, many things in fashion look dated. Magazines look dated. Stores look dated. Lots of clothes look dated, including many we saw only yesterday. We've seen talented designers put forward craft and savoir faire, like Alber Elbaz with a super Lanvin collection. And many others have surprised us by moving in a new or more accessible direction, like Nicolas Ghesquiere at Balenciaga with his satin drapery and John Galliano with his Persian motifs at Dior. But while these collections show a great deal of hard work and focus - as you'd expect, given the daunting economic picture - we feel somehow they are not very ambitious. They are almost too easy to understand. The mastery of a particular dressmaking technique, however pleasing the result, is not proof of an extraordinary sensibility. Indeed, after marveling at a technique we gradually come to realize that it's still the same old technique and that really nothing has changed or improved our understanding of fashion. We feel empty, in fact."

It is not known whether the value of the home, relative to its peak value, has dropped 40 percent. The caption also overstated the overall decline in value for homes in Pacific Heights.

2009-03-07T00:00:00Z,"Favorable rattlesnake weather calls for temperatures in the high 70s, with a gentle southerly breeze to float chaparral kisses deep into the tableland of the Balcones Escarpment. Blessed with such conditions on a weekday in late February, Eric Carl Timaeus loaded an assortment of wood crates, canvas sacks and hooked poles into his pickup truck, where a black rosary swung from the rearview mirror, and set off past miles of caliche pits and Border Patrol checkpoints into the short-grass country. ''I'm on the way that way, thought I'd make sure you didn't have a problem with me going out there today,'' Timaeus, 57, said to a rancher on his cellphone."

2009-03-07T00:00:00Z,"As a newly sobered art world sizes up this weekend's Armory Show, many are wondering about the fates of smaller fairs with catchier names. What prospects do they have in a crippled economy? A winnowing has already occurred: at least three of last year's Armory-week fairs have opted out of the festivities. Those that remain are trying out some new strategies. Volta, which shares a parent company with the Armory, strives to be seen as its younger, hipper sibling (something like the Art Statements section of solo-artist booths at Art Basel and Art Basel Miami Beach). Pulse, in its most diverse incarnation yet, is banking on globalization. And Scope supplements its accessible, pop-kitschy wares with a packed special-events calendar of music, screenings and parties."

Scaring, told a Queens jury on Friday, she would have talked to the hit man on a disposable cellphone, not on her own phone. She would not have waited, he said, until after a court order forced her to turn over her daughter to her husband -- the event that prosecutors say supplied the motive. She would have had him gunned down, Mr. Scaring said, on a dark night as he left his dental office, not in a park full of witnesses as he brought the 4-year-old girl to meet her mother."

The Mets have not said when Santana's first Grapefruit League start will be, but it could come earlier than March 18, the original target. ''It means he's getting ready for opening day, what you been talking about?'' Manager Jerry Manuel said, laughing. ''That's what that means.''"
2009-03-07T00:00:00Z,"Wall Street ended a week of battering sell-offs on an mildly positive note as stock markets closed mostly higher despite a report showing that unemployment had surged to its highest level in 25 years. Underscoring the sweep of economic declines, the government reported Friday morning that the unemployment rate rose to 8.1 percent in February after the economy lost 651,000 jobs. The job losses were not as stark as revised totals from December and January, and stocks initially surged before pulling back during the day and finally recovering at the close."
2009-03-07T00:00:00Z,"President Obama will announce Monday that he is reversing Bush administration limits on federal financing for embryonic stem cell research as part of a pledge to separate science and politics, White House officials said Friday. As a presidential candidate, Mr. Obama spoke out in favor of stem cell research, so his intention to undo the curbs put in place by President George W. Bush is not surprising. But the decision is nonetheless of great interest, involving a long-controversial intersection of science and personal moral beliefs."

2009-03-07T00:00:00Z,"Monica Bill Barnes's new ''Another Parade,'' the third offering by the 92nd Street Y Harkness Dance Festival, begins rather brilliantly. The tall, gangly Deborah Lohse, whose Carol Burnett-like face holds the constant promise of tragic comedy, strides onstage to the sounds of the Sarabande from Bach's glorious Cello Suite No. 4. She proceeds to ignore the music as she performs subtle little hip and shoulder shimmies, arm swings and strange truncated gestures, occasionally baring a shoulder or her abdomen, while smiling and grimacing with equally mysterious arbitrariness. The solo is a tour de force, mostly because of the way Ms. Lohse -- one of those performers who have only to raise an eyebrow to cause an audience to burst out laughing -- is able to infuse Ms. Barnes's material with an almost magical amount of meaning and power."

2009-03-07T00:00:00Z,"The numbers in the jobs report for February were bad, but the trends were worse. More than half of the 4.4 million jobs lost since December 2007, when the recession began, vanished in the last four months. The unemployment rate has also surged to 8.1 percent last month from 7.6 percent in January -- and from 5.0 percent when the recession began. The ranks of the unemployed now total 12.5 million people. It's fortunate, then, that the nation's first line of defense against rising joblessness -- unemployment insurance -- was reinforced in the stimulus law that passed last month. The law increases unemployment benefits by $25 a week and allows states to extend those benefits through the end of the year. It also provides $7 billion to the states to cover more than 500,000 workers -- often part-time, low-wage and female -- who are denied jobless benefits under outdated rules that apply in many states. Those states, of course, must reform their systems to specifically include those workers and to bring their programs more in line with federal guidelines."

2009-03-07T00:00:00Z,"KEENAN--Terrance. The Board, staff, grantees and friends of the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation mourn the passing and celebrate the life of legendary grantmaker and our revered colleague, Terrance Keenan. For 50 years, first with the Ford Foundation, the Commonwealth Fund and then with the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation, where in 1972 he was in the vanguard of a new venture and a new staff, Terry set the standard for creativity, caring and vision in philanthropy. What made Terry so special is that he never lost sight of the people we are trying to help. His modus operandi was to always remember that the Foundation represents a public trust; to recognize the primacy of new ideas and innovation; and to demand of himself and others the highest standards of ethics and excellence. Born in Philadelphia in 1923 to Peter and Marie Keenan, Terry Keenan was raised in Bucks County, Pennsylvania. He graduated from New Hope Solebury High School and summa cum laude from Yale University, where he was a member of Phi Beta Kappa, after service in the Pacific as a Navy flight navigator during World War II. Upon graduating from Yale, the brilliantly eclectic Terry taught English, Spanish, French, history and art appreciation at Jefferson prep school in St. Louis, Missouri. In 1955, he moved to New York City to work at Merrill Lynch on a biography of the firm's founder, Charles Merrill. His long and distinguished career in philanthropy began the next year, when he joined the Ford Foundation to direct its Office of Reports. In 1965, he became board secretary for the Commonwealth Fund in New York, where he served as the right hand man to Fund president Quigg Newton. In 1972, Terry became Vice-President of the newly established Robert Wood Johnson Foundation (RWJF), then the second largest philanthropy in the U.S. and the largest focusing on health issues. Terry Keenan created many of the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation's most enduring and exemplary programs during his 30-year career with us. Considered the Indiana Jones of health philanthropy, Terry ventured to remote rural outposts and blighted urban neighborhoods to bring health care to communities deeply in need. In his first portfolio of what eventually became 940-plus grants at RWJF was a program to train rural nurse practitioners, a network of rural clinics, and a summer study program to prepare minority students to enter the health professions. He always had an endless string of inventive ideas that he effectively championed and led by marvelous, inspiring exampleHis idea to develop a network of foundations to share information and build connections among health philanthropies became Grantmakers in Health, which now brings together more than 300 foundations focused on health. A Keenan-inspired program to improve health care in small communities became, in 1987, the Local Initiatives Funding Partners program to encourage local foundations to support health philanthropy in their communities. One of the U.S.' greatest champions of nursing and nurses, Terry initiated programs to create specialized clinical training for nurses; to restructure hospital-based nursing care; to create clinics led by nurse practitioners; to expand the role of nurses in emergency care in rural areas; to promote the use of school-based clinics, led by nurses, to improve care for students and their families; and to train and promote nurses for executive-level leadership roles in health organizations. A small project in Elmira, New York to see if nurse home visits to economically disadvantaged mothers of newborns could help improve the life outcomes of both children and mothers became the national, thriving Nurse-Family Partnership. A man of great but quiet faith, Terry Keenan pioneered the creation of partnerships between local health and faith-based organizations to improve and expand volunteer care-giving for chronically ill patients, an idea that became the Faith in Action program. Terry's philosophy of what makes a great philanthropy is found in his 1992 monograph, The Promise at Hand: ""A great foundation"" he wrote, ""is informed and animated by moral purpose,"" ""walks humbly,"" ""is deliberate,"" ""accountable,"" and ""self-renewing."" Such attributes aptly describe Terry Keenan, a great and humble man, as well. Terry is survived by his loving wife of 30 years, Joette Lehan Keenan, by his sister, Sheila Keeler and her husband, Philip, by his sister-in-law Barbara Rogers, and many nieces and nephews. Relatives and friends are invited to Terry's graveside service on Saturday, March 7, at 2pm at St. Martin of Tours Cemetery, New Hope, PA. In lieu of flowers, memorial contributions in Terrance Keenan's name may be made to the Make-A-Wish Foundation, One Valley Square, 512 Township Line Rd., Suite 133, Blue Bell, PA 19422. www.Lifecelebration.com, 1-800-GIVNISH."

Or, as she explained in a WNYC interview, ''Here's the same bottle, but the liquid's different.''

The other half consisted of works by Chopin, a peerless Romantic whose offerings could be taken for their surface flash, elusive intimations of incalculable depth, or both at once. Beyond its suggestive parallels to a preternaturally gifted, mysterious musician's career, the program featured works well suited to Mr. Kissin's exacting technique and expressive gifts.

2009-03-07T00:00:00Z,"WAGNER--Rubin, 89. It is with profound sorrow that we announce the passing of Rubin Wagner, for over 66 years the proud husband of the late Sima Wagner, patriarch of our family and mentor to so many. Ruby lived a life devoted to his wife, his children, Harry and Leon, his daughters in law, Myra and Marsha, and his grandchildren Elliot, Lauren, Gabriel and Daniel. For his dedication to his family, to his friends, to those in need; for his jokes, ""have you heard my latest?"", for his good humor and love of Judaism and Israel, and for the respect with which he treated his fellow man, rich or poor, Ruby was widely loved by the countless people whose lives he had touched. Born Ruvke Wajner (pronounced Viner) in Vilna, Lithuania, Ruby was the older son of Aron and Sore Chana, both of whom perished in the Holocaust, and brother of Mendel who disappeared into the Ponary forest. At the outbreak of World War II Soviet Russia invaded Vilna and ceded it to Lithuania. On February 20, 1940 at the age of 20, Ruby eloped with the love of his life, Sima Benosher. In June 1941, Soviet Russia annexed Lithuania and closed Jewish institutions. Sima, Ruby and baby daughter, Sheyna, lived together with his parents in a life of relative comfort where their baby's 'feet never touched the ground' from the constant love and attention she received from her grandparents. A year later the Germans entered Vilna. Ruby cared for his family in the ghetto. He survived the war in concentration camps often working as a barber, a skill he had learned in his mother's thriving beauty salon. Ruby was liberated in 1945 unaware that his daughter had perished or that his wife survived. Sima and Ruby were reunited to begin life again, lived in Heidenheim, Germany among many friends, had their first son, Aron (Harry) and in May 1949 set sail for America. Beginning in a railroad flat apartment at 1958 Coney Island Avenue in Brooklyn, Ruby did what he had to do to support his family eventually becoming a barber in a shop in the basement of the famous Hearst Building near Columbus Circle. A few years later he had the opportunity to go into partnership to build one single-family house in what was then the farmland of Huntington, New York. He asked the advice of one of his successful clients who told him, 'the barber chair will be here if it doesn't work out.' Founding Ripley Associates and Forest Green Ruby and his longtime business partner, Victor Cynamon, built many homes, developed much property, at one time becoming a large landowner in Huntington. Moving to Roslyn, New York then Aventura, Florida Ruby was always active in his community whether planning cantorial concerts, doing what was needed at his synagogues, or participating in Holocaust remembrance. Throughout his life Ruby was a proud 'Vilner', to him a very special identity. Vilna was an important center of Jewish life, a center of Jewish learning, a nexus of Yiddishkeit. Ruby was one of the publishers of 'Vilna in Pictures' a highly regarded pictorial history by Lazar Ran, the longtime editor of 'The Daily Forward', a project on which he and his colleagues worked for many years. From his youth an aficionado of soccer, Ruby came to love the Brooklyn Dodgers and New York Mets. He loved his weekly poker games, vacations in the Catskills; he loved happy occasions, Chivas, and any food that starts with the letter 'a' (as in 'a shtikkele cake, a drink', etc.). Finally, Ruby deeply loved the country that gave him and his extended family the opportunity to rebuild their lives and flourish from the horrors that they had survived.

2009-03-07T00:00:00Z,"NASA has set Wednesday at 9:20 p.m. Eastern time as the launching date for the space shuttle Discovery. Its mission to the International Space Station had been planned for mid-February, but was delayed because of concerns over a valve that broke during the shuttle Endeavour's mission in November. There were concerns that a piece of valve breaking off at a crucial point during liftoff could prove catastrophic. The valves are used to regulate the flow of hydrogen gas from the main engines to the external fuel tank. Using a new testing method, engineers were able to identify three valves that are free of cracks for the Discovery's flight. In addition, engineers performed calculations and experiments to be confident that even if a piece broke off, it would not cause significant damage."

2009-03-07T00:00:00Z,"A 77-year-old child prodigy with bushy eyebrows and the heart of an adolescent swooning at his first exposure to Rachmaninoff: that describes the sensibility of Michel Legrand, the French jazz pianist and composer and multiple Oscar winner who is playing a rare New York engagement at Birdland, accompanied by a string quartet, harp, bass and drums. This unwieldy mixture of classical, jazz and Hollywood is built around pianism that suggests a steep mountain brook spilling from level to level on an elaborate series of terraces, as Mr. Legrand tosses off stylistic quotes from masters like Oscar Peterson, Bill Evans and especially Erroll Garner. As both a composer and a pianist, Mr. Legrand favors repeated chromatic sequences, piled onto one another until one wonders if the structure can hold all that weight without collapsing."

As much as I love actors like Johnny Depp, George Clooney and Denzel Washington, these big-time moviestars have been big-time movie stars for at least a decade. They are undeniably great, but where is the next generation of homegrown talent? While there’s been a new wave of leading men from Australia (Russell Crowe, for one) and England has provided Hollywood with an endless stream of dashing aspirants (like Orlando Bloom, Ben Barnes and Robert Pattinson, the matinee idol/vampire of “Twilight”), America (and I’m even including Canada) has fallen short. Except in comedy, where Seth Rogen has emerged as a new kind of sex symbol, American cinema has been curiously lacking in native testosterone."
2009-03-08T00:00:00Z,"Exactly 70 years after it was introduced at the 1939 World’s Fair, nylon is making news again. Back then, women cheered the arrival of sheer hosiery. Now it’s the men’s runways that are filled with shiny nylon (and nylonesque) windbreakers. Prada’s hangs off the shoulders with a strap, Patrik Ervell showed a featherweight poncho in gold and cream, and Dior Homme paraded black and gold versions. Nylon has always been used for both fashion and function, with practicality usually gaining the upper hand. During World War II, nylon production shifted from stockings to parachutes and tents, but with the development of low-cost nylon fabrics, the stage was set for a postwar boom. In 1949, Haspel Clothing promoted nylon suits with the slogan “A crisp and new-as-tomorrow look.” Soon after, men were dressing in basics like the Ike jacket, nicknamed for General Eisenhower. When James Dean wore a red windbreaker in “Rebel Without a Cause” (1955), it became a classic. A decade later, the skiwear company Bogner was dressing James Bond for the slopes, but reality soon trumped make-believe with the nylon-coated aluminumized spacesuit worn by John Glenn and the other Mercury astronauts. The ’70s and ’80s were all about high-tech nylon variations like Cordura: these were embraced by sailors like Dennis Conner, whose team won the 1988 America’s Cup in nylon-bonded uniforms. Today nylon shows up in work wear from old pros like Carhartt and Dickies, mountain-climbing outerwear from Northface, Nike’s windbreakers and the unitard developed by Speedo for Michael Phelps. In fact, this garment, together with the gear worn by bike messengers, was the inspiration for Duckie Brown’s show, where nylon leggings were combined with synthetic shorts and crinkly jackets. Seven decades into nylon’s history, it seems that fashion may finally be trumping function."

2009-03-08T00:00:00Z,"William S.

London recently hosted “Burroughs Live” at the Royal Academy of Arts. This July, in Paris, nakedlunch.org will host events celebrating the 50th anniversary of “Naked Lunch”; come autumn, New York joins in as well. And then there’s Burroughs’s famously dapper macs, three-piece suits and rakish hats, which are back on the runway. The wide trousers at Dries Van Noten, fedoras at Junya Watanabe, suits at Hermès and heavy-framed glasses almost everywhere confirm that his debauched brand of intellectualism is eternally stylish — shotgun and methadone notwithstanding.

2009-03-08T00:00:00Z,"Shepard Fairey is our nation’s pre-eminent poster boy. He created that rousing image of Barack Obama in looming close-up, an American rebel who gives off the revolutionary ardor of Che Guevara while wearing, in place of a slanted beret, a crisp white shirt and tie. The Obama Hope poster, as it is known, says something about the high-art ambitions of its creator, a 39-year-old street artist who is currently having, at the Institute of Contemporary Art in Boston, his first-ever museum retrospective. Starting this Thursday, you can also find his work emerging from Saks Fifth Avenue stores. New shopping bags and advertisements designed by Fairey’s crew, Studio Number One, wittily riff on the geometric art of Rodchenko and the Russian Constructivists. With their austere ballet of circles and stripes and their striking red-meets-black palette, the new Saks graphics appropriate the visual language of the Bolsheviks to promote an ideology that was definitely not conceived by Karl Marx. As a new slogan exhorts: Dress Up the Sneaker! Some of Fairey’s critics, particularly of the blogging variety, are already crying sellout. Please, comrades, lighten up. As the Russian artists discovered, utopian movements are bound to end in disappointment — but the populist graphics they leave in their wake amount to their own mini-revolution.

2009-03-08T00:00:00Z,THE PARADOX OF PLENTY.
2009-03-08T00:00:00Z,"Depending on your point of view, Bernd Eichinger’s film “The Baader Meinhof Complex” is either a biopic about domestic terrorism in the early ’70s or a cautionary tale about sartorial decision making. In Germany, the movie has prompted a sober review of the Baader-Meinhof group, which is still cloaked in romantic notions of left-wing radicalism despite the narcissistic dedication to violence, hashish and LSD-laced hedonism displayed by its founder, Andreas Baader, and his girlfriend, Gudrun Ensslin. What began with plans to throw pudding at the American vice president Hubert Humphrey culminated in bombings and hijackings. Eichinger, who also produced the historical films “We Children From Bahnhof Zoo” and “Downfall,” summarizes the era thus: “It was fun. Then it turned into a nightmare.” Even Ulrike Meinhof, the newspaper columnist turned commando, found it increasingly difficult to present any political justification for the group’s slide into mayhem. Still, Baader-Meinhof and its successor, the Red Army Faction, had its fashionable devotees: the group was an unnamed inspiration for Marianne Faithfull’s 1979 hit “Broken English,” and Joe Strummer took to wearing R.A.F. T-shirts. Vanity — and the need for new disguises — contributed to the ringleaders’ undoing: Ensslin was arrested while shopping for clothes after a shop assistant felt a pistol in her blue-gray leather jacket. Baader, always in Ray-Bans, was an uncooperative student of the Palestinian fedayeen, once insisting that his velvet trousers, not green battle dress, were the correct choice for live-ammunition training. Finally, a tip-off about young people cruising in ostentatious cars led police to a garage near Frankfurt in 1972. And what do you know? Baader and two associates showed up driving a purple Porsche.

2009-03-08T00:00:00Z,"Olivier Borde recently introduced Garde Robe, a collection reminiscent of the preppy-but-tattered boys in “Lord of the Flies”: snug jackets are paired with voluminous shorts and polos with unruly stripes and large hand-embroidered roosters on the chest. Borde and his business partner, Heath Callender, an American stylist who used to work for J. Crew, set up their atelier in Carpentras, the small Provençal town where Borde grew up. The duo created Garde Robe soon after they were cited for “reinventing the classics of male fashion” at France’s annual young design and photography competition in Hyères. “We decided to take advantage of the buzz,” says Borde, who has always wanted to do men’s wear, despite a stint with the women’s designer Charles Anastase in London. During a visit to Los Angeles, he fell for skating gear and casual American basics, which he reworks with intricate detailing. “We like the clothes to look handmade,” Borde says, “so there’s lots of patchwork with vintage fabrics like old lining silk, and mother-of-pearl buttons that Heath found at an Amish store in Pennsylvania. Right now, Garde Robe is small enough for us to do that.” Don’t count on its staying that way for long. Available at Maria Luisa in Paris. [?][?][?] REBECCA VOIGHT."

We were standing in the Jean Marc Patras / Galerie in Paris; surrounding us were large black-and-white photographs of what appeared to be leaders in the American civil rights and African independence movements, heroic symbols of liberation: Martin Luther King Jr. preaching to the crowds at the March on Washington; Malcolm X in profile, his leather fedora tipped rakishly forward; Aimé Césaire, the great poet of negritude and politician from Martinique, wearing a lambskin hat against the winter chill of Paris; a young Nelson Mandela arrayed as a Zulu chieftain."

His recent film, “Hunger,” an unforgiving depiction of the hunger strike staged by the imprisoned Bobby Sands of the Irish Republican Army, won the Caméra d’Or for best first feature at Cannes last year. Despite — or because of — his penchant for provocation, he will represent Britain in June at the 2009 Venice Biennale. “I feel lucky to be asked,” he says. McQueen is particularly audacious when it comes to his personal style; here he’s wearing a spring kilt from his friend Yohji Yamamoto. The two have an artistic collaboration in the works, and McQueen says he appreciates his pal’s ability to deconstruct men’s-wear clichés. As for the skirt, he doesn’t bat an eyelash. “It’s just clothing, isn’t it?” [?][?][?] ALEX HAWGOOD."

2009-03-08T00:00:00Z,"As the recession increases the pace of industrial closings in the Rust Belt, one Midwestern manufacturer, Cleveland Art, is actually benefiting from the economic downturn. Its furniture is in numerous Ralph Lauren stores, Steven Spielberg has bought some pieces for his home, and the company recently opened a store in Los Angeles. Yet its design studio is in a dilapidated industrial building in Ohio, surrounded by an acre of land covered with rusting machine parts. That’s because the designer Jason Wein and his 10 or so employees make furniture out of scraps salvaged from shuttered factories, of which there is no shortage. The gears, turbines, pipes and panels — typically from the 1860s to the 1920s — are the objects from which they create dressers, seating, tables and lamps."

Infamous for their mix of gritty realness (think models glistening with sweat beads) and high eroticism (he had a fixation with popsicles), the images from both calendars are now together for the first time in “Harri Peccinotti: H. P.,” a new book from Damiani. “I look back on them with affection,” Peccinotti says of the larger-than-life calendars. “I think they were quite honest photographically.” Now in his 70s, Peccinotti is shooting for publications like French Vogue and 10 Magazine, and working on a book on birds. “The feathered kind,” he says.

His leather sandals and moccasins, inspired by peasant shoes and released under the fledgling Together brand, are a collaboration with the Spanish footwear company Camper. These gladiator sandals, available at Opening Ceremony, consist of ropelike laces tethered to tire-rubber soles; the side-buckle moccasins are hand-stitched from a single piece of leather, one of the oldest shoemaking techniques.

But so does building schools, training teachers and opening clinics, all of which are being done at the local level throughout Africa.

I can only imagine the frustration Stiers and others like her experience when it just doesn’t work out that way, and they suffer for years without knowing what they have.

In addition, Nancy was the Assistant Administrative Director of Diller-Quaile School of Music, NY, and was the Administrative Director and Headmaster's assistant at St. Bernard's School, NY. In 1980 she moved near Philadelphia where she became assistant to the director of Performing Arts program at Bryn Mawr College and later a legal secretary for Crawford and Diamond law offices. At the same time, she created ASH Handwovens, her own line of handwoven fabrics. Later in life, her love of animals led her to become a member of the Board of Directors at Women's SPCA of Pennsylvania. She compiled and edited a pioneering book on the human/companion animal bond, ""New Perspectives on out Lives with Companion Animals"" published by University of Pennsylvania press. She dedicated her last 15 professional years, into her late 70s, as an event planner for St. David's Church, in Wayne, PA, arranging and coordinating weddings. She spent every summer with her children, grandchildren and extended family at her summer home in the woods of Forestburgh, NY as her family has done since the 1880s. Nancy possessed a keen curiosity which led her to engage in many diverse intellectual endeavors. She was kind and generous not only to her family but also to her many friends. Nancy will be deeply missed. Mrs. Hahn is survived by her three children, Rob, Weston CT, Anne Elizabeth Block, Westlake Village, CA, Tom, Piedmont CA, brother Donald Shriver, Maplewood, NJ and eight grandchildren. She is further survived by nieces, nephews, other relatives and dear friends. In addition to her parents, she was preceded in death by her brother Denton Shriver.

Joy Gryson, a former design director for Marc Jacobs handbags and the woman behind the three-year-old accessories line Gryson, mined that decade's pop colors and punk attitude for her new less-expensive handbag line, called Olivia Harris. ''I wanted to do something young and fun and a little gritty,'' she explained of her spring collection, which just arrived in stores. ''It's very Debbie Harry, the Go-Gos, the girl hanging out on the Lower East Side.''

So she bought a Mamiya camera and became her own guinea pig, dressing up as different characters and posing for herself. Then she began gluing the photos into travel journals (or ''Reisebuchs,'' as she calls them) and creating intricate collages that elegantly combined gouache and newsprint, colored tape and metallic paper. ''They became like a language I had with myself,'' she said. Nowadays, Ms. Kruse has a studio in Brooklyn and a costume closet the size of a small bedroom. Her photos have been published in Vogue, Harper's Bazaar and Interview; and last week, her first solo show in the United States opened at Steven Kasher Gallery in Chelsea. On view is a range of evocative, often amusing self-portraits and collages, as well as ''Reisebuch 1-5,'' her limited-edition artist's book, painstakingly self-published in Germany. So much for free time. As she noted, ''It took forever to do them.''"

Summers, Tom attended Camp Wabun in Canada, where he discovered his lifelong love: the great outdoors. After Harvard ('51) he took a post at General Motors before moving to France to work for the Paris Review. From there, he hitchhiked around the world as a stringer for the Boston Globe. Tom then took a position at the Gillette Company in London, where he met his wife Caroline, and later with Morgan Guaranty Trust in New York City, which sent him to Madrid. After three years, he returned to New York with his wife, two daughters and 50 cases of wine. They moved to Manchester in 1968, so Tom could pursue his love of writing between posts in Africa and Central America with United Nations Development Programme. He then founded Gametrails Limited, where he was able to combine his love of writing with his love of adventure, exploring the world for the best wing shooting, fly fishing and local eateries. He spent summers at his camp in Quebec, where he and Caroline taught their three children how to do the J stroke, portage a canoe, and cast a fly.

2009-03-08T00:00:00Z,"DOMESTIC DISTURBANCES In the past I sensed a certain sadness, even feelings of betrayal, in the reactions from my husband, Max, to my proselytizing about my Pema Chödrön ''Getting Unstuck'' CD: ''I never thought that you, of all people, would get into that New Age stuff,'' he'd said wistfully. I hadn't realized that when a person gets unstuck the people around her can feel left behind. It has dawned on me lately, meditating on the Metro, thoughts silenced so completely that I can hear every page being turned by passengers up and down the car that being fully in the moment, all senses turned on, feeling your hands in your lap and the ground under your feet, is a very good way of not being there at all."

He created the ''T'' on Page 87 entirely out of chairs -- objects he views as ''a kind of point of orientation, like a Platonic reference.'' Robinson (far right) is an expert garbage picker and has made trolling for trash part of his daily routine. ''The rest are donated to me by friends who think I might be able to squeeze some life out of things that have otherwise sort of run their course.''

2009-03-08T00:00:00Z,"WAGNER--Rubin, 89. It is with profound sorrow that we announce the passing of Rubin Wagner, for over 66 years the proud husband of the late Sima Wagner, patriarch of our family and mentor to so many. Ruby lived a life devoted to his wife, his children, Harry and Leon, his daughters in law, Myra and Marsha, and his grandchildren Elliot, Lauren, Gabriel and Daniel. For his dedication to his family, to his friends, to those in need; for his jokes, ""have you heard my latest?"", for his good humor and love of Judaism and Israel, and for the respect with which he treated his fellow man, rich or poor, Ruby was widely loved by the countless people whose lives he had touched. Born Ruvke Wajner (pronounced Viner) in Vilna, Lithuania, Ruby was the older son of Aron and Sore Chana, both of whom perished in the Holocaust, and brother of Mendel who disappeared into the Ponary forest. At the outbreak of World War II Soviet Russia invaded Vilna and ceded it to Lithuania. On February 20, 1940 at the age of 20, Ruby eloped with the love of his life, Sima Benosher. In June 1941, Soviet Russia annexed Lithuania and closed Jewish institutions. Sima, Ruby and baby daughter, Sheyna, lived together with his parents in a life of relative comfort where their baby's 'feet never touched the ground' from the constant love and attention she received from her grandparents. A year later the Germans entered Vilna. Ruby cared for his family in the ghetto. He survived the war in concentration camps often working as a barber, a skill he had learned in his mother's thriving beauty salon. Ruby was liberated in 1945 unaware that his daughter had perished or that his wife survived. Sima and Ruby were reunited to begin life again, lived in Heidenheim, Germany among many friends, had their first son, Aron (Harry) and in May 1949 set sail for America. Beginning in a railroad flat apartment at 1958 Coney Island Avenue in Brooklyn, Ruby did what he had to do to support his family eventually becoming a barber in a shop in the basement of the famous Hearst Building near Columbus Circle. A few years later he had the opportunity to go into partnership to build one single-family house in what was then the farmland of Huntington, New York. He asked the advice of one of his successful clients who told him, 'the barber chair will be here if it doesn't work out.' Founding Ripley Associates and Forest Green Ruby and his longtime business partner, Victor Cynamon, built many homes, developed much property, at one time becoming a large landowner in Huntington. Moving to Roslyn, New York then Aventura, Florida Ruby was always active in his community whether planning cantorial concerts, doing what was needed at his synagogues, or participating in Holocaust remembrance. Throughout his life Ruby was a proud 'Vilner', to him a very special identity. Vilna was an important center of Jewish life, a center of Jewish learning, a nexus of Yiddishkeit. Ruby was one of the publishers of 'Vilna in Pictures' a highly regarded pictorial history by Lazar Ran, the longtime editor of 'The Daily Forward', a project on which he and his colleagues worked for many years. From his youth an aficionado of soccer, Ruby came to love the Brooklyn Dodgers and New York Mets. He loved his weekly poker games, vacations in the Catskills; he loved happy occasions, Chivas, and any food that starts with the letter 'a' (as in 'a shtikkele cake, a drink', etc.). Finally, Ruby deeply loved the country that gave him and his extended family the opportunity to rebuild their lives and flourish from the horrors that they had survived. Funeral service will be held on Sunday, March 8th at 12:00pm at Gutterman's, 8000 Jericho Turnpike, Woodbury, NY 11797 P: 516-921-5757.

Bradman's record at 4.4 standard deviations above the mean tops Pelé, whose record for goals per game is only 3.7 standard deviations above the mean, Ty Cobb's batting average at 3.6, Jack Nicklaus's major golf titles at 3.5 and Michael Jordan in points per game at 3.4.

After retiring from Commercial Union in 1974, he first became Director and Financial Officer of the United Mutual Savings Bank and then joined Brown Brothers Harriman & Co. where he served in various capacities until 1986, when he retired. In addition, for 57 years, through 2002, he managed investments for the F.A. Ayer Estate and 26 years for the Wilmar Corporation through 2000. He was a member and officer of the New York Society of Security Analysts, First Congregational Church of Chappaqua NY, and the New Castle Historical Society. He was a member of the Bond Club of New York, Mount Kisco Country Club and the Forest Heights Country Club of Statesboro, GA. He worked with little league basketball and baseball and the boy scouts. He and his wife lived in Chappaqua, NY from 1950 to 1998, when they moved to Statesboro GA, where Phoebe died in 2001.

BEHIND THE NEWS The plan works mainly by lowering interest costs, not forgiving principal, a feature that drew criticism as too generous to lenders and insufficient to solve the problem. People with big mortgages or big income shortfalls would not be helped. Conservatives questioned why taxpayers should help struggling borrowers at all."

2009-03-10T09:29:47Z,"Adding another chapter to the legal history of “Sahara,” the 2005 action movie adapted from Clive Cussler‘s novel, a judge ruled Monday that Mr. Cussler must pay $13.9 million in legal fees to the production company that made the film, The Associated Press reported. In 2004, Mr. Cussler sued Crusader Entertainment, the company owned by the billionaire entrepreneur Philip F. Anschutz, saying that he was not permitted final approval on the script as his contract mandated, which resulted in the box-office failure of the film. Crusader countersued, saying that it had overpaid for the rights to Mr. Cussler’s work because he had overstated the sales of his novels. In 2007, a jury delivered a split decision. On Monday, Judge John P. Shook of Los Angeles Superior Court ruled that Mr. Cussler had violated a contract that mandated the payment of legal fees if either side breached the agreement."

2009-03-11T09:34:58Z,"Updated | 9:56 a.m. An episode of “Big Love,” the HBO series about a polygamous Mormon family, has courted controversy with the Mormon church and prompted an apology from the network — but not edits — before the show has aired, The Associated Press reported. The episode of “Big Love” scheduled for Sunday will show a character portrayed by the actress Jeanne Tripplehorn undergoing an endowment ceremony, a religious rite in which members recite religious teachings and reenact scenes from the Bible in preparation for their places in heaven. The church considers the rite sacred, and only members in good standing may participate in or view it. In a statement, the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints said, “Certainly church members are offended when their most sacred practices are misrepresented or presented without context or understanding,” according to the A.P. HBO said that it did not intend to cause offense to the church and apologized, but that the ceremony was an important part of the episode. In a statement, the show’s creators, Mark V. Olsen and Will Scheffer, said they “took great pains to depict the ceremony with the dignity and reverence it is due,” according to The A.P."

2009-03-11T00:00:00Z,"Only about one-quarter of invasive ovarian cancers are detected in the early stages, when the disease is most treatable. Now, preliminary results from a large, continuing trial indicate that postmenopausal women who are screened for ovarian cancer either by transvaginal ultrasound scan or by a blood test followed by a scan are more likely to have their cancers detected at early stages, with almost half the cancers picked up before they had spread beyond the pelvis. While the results suggest that widespread screening for ovarian cancer may be feasible, long a point of scientific controversy, the researchers warned that the benefits were still far from clear. Many of the women in the trial had false positive results on screening tests that led to unnecessary surgeries and complications, especially among those who had ultrasound scans alone. And there is still no evidence that screening reduces the death rate from ovarian cancer, the researchers said."

The Chinese place enormous emphasis on anniversaries and dates, one more reason that 2009 is shaping up as a very stressful year for the nation's rulers. Besides navigating an economic crisis that has rendered millions jobless, the government must steer the country through a sheaf of symbolic dates, some auspicious, some portentous, all -- the leaders seem to think, anyway -- potential triggers for public unrest."

But cellphones have a much higher potential for personalized advertising, especially when they use applications like Yelp or Urbanspoon with GPS to identify a person's location, right down to the street corner where they are standing."

2009-03-11T00:00:00Z,"For all those who tried and failed to snare a ticket to the recent critically acclaimed production of ''Othello'' by Theater for a New Audience, there's hope yet: it's returning for an unusually limited engagement -- 12 performances in mid-April -- with an eye toward an eventual commercial run. Jeffrey Horowitz, the company's artistic director, said he had heard from ''a number of interested commercial parties'' about the show since it closed last week, including potential investors and producers who did not have a chance to see a performance during its three-week run at the Duke on 42nd Street Theater. The production, directed by Arin Arbus, will return to the Duke from April 15 to 24, with the entire cast intact, including John Douglas Thompson, below left, as Othello and Ned Eisenberg as Iago. ''What we want to do is get it back up on its feet, have more of the public see it, have commercial parties see it, and see where it goes from there,'' Mr. Horowitz said."

2009-03-11T00:00:00Z,"There is a perfect symmetry in what remains of William Shakespeare: the immensity of his plays and the lack of biographical information about the man. From a canon as rich as his, and a documentary record as meager as his, you can infer almost anything. When it comes to privacy, Shakespeare out-Salingers Salinger and out-Pynchons Pynchon. Go looking for the man, and you will find only the person doing the looking. The hunger for more is always there, which is why a portrait -- a painting of a very well-dressed Elizabethan man -- taken from the private collection of an aristocratic Anglo-Irish family, the Cobbes, has drawn so much attention. Physical evidence confirms the painting's antiquity, and its provenance links it to Shakespeare's only literary patron. But while provenance may be a good guide to ownership, it is a very weedy indicator of identity."

Just check out the bank's minority holdings in a handful of financial firms. Start with its stakes in a couple of banks in Latin America: it owns almost 25 percent of Santander's Mexico outfit and 8 percent of Brazil's Banco Itau, as well as a chunk of Itau's preferred stock.

Still, even though there are no cameras, the room feels staged. Down in front you see a dozen or so faithful fans -- young women, mostly college-age -- though what they're fans of is up for grabs. Tamarama is a pair of genetically blessed Australians, Nicolas Potts and Jay Lyon, models both.

2009-03-11T00:00:00Z,"Adding another chapter to the legal history of ''Sahara,'' the 2005 action movie adapted from Clive Cussler's novel, below, a judge has ruled that Mr. Cussler must pay $13.9 million in legal fees to the production company that made the film, The Associated Press reported. In 2004 Mr. Cussler sued Crusader Entertainment, the company owned by the billionaire entrepreneur Philip F. Anschutz, saying that he was not permitted final approval on the script as his contract mandated, which resulted in the box office failure of the film. Crusader countersued, saying that it had overpaid for the rights to Mr. Cussler's work because he had overstated the sales of his novels. In 2007 a jury delivered a split decision. On Monday Judge John P. Shook of Los Angeles County Superior Court ruled that Mr. Cussler had violated a contract that mandated the payment of legal fees if either side breached the agreement."

Bush pointed to the decision as a victory in Washington's so-called war on terror and as a potential model for pressing Iran and North Korea to give up their weapons programs, too. But now Libyan officials say they are dissatisfied with the way the deal worked out, insisting that the United States has done too little to reward Libya's concessions. Officials here say they believe that Libya's limited payoff undermines the credibility of the United States as it presses other nations to abandon weapons programs."

The national board, which recently ousted the union's executive director and chief negotiator, previously voted to reject that offer. The Hollywood board does not want to accept the offer; its majority, which supported the ousted negotiator, hopes a rejection by the full membership will lead to a strike-authorization vote, which is opposed by the national board majority. The actors' union has been working without a contract since the end of June.

2009-03-12T00:00:00Z,"DESPITE the 1980s pop hit, wearing sunglasses at night was never particularly practical -- nor socially acceptable. But wearing protective eyewear in low-light conditions, such as at dawn or dusk, under cloudy skies or through dappled shade, helps preserve healthy eyesight and youthful appearance. For the outdoor athlete especially, wearing sunglasses no matter the brightness of the sky improves visibility, protects the eyes from particles in the air and limits exposure to the rays of the sun, which can remain surprisingly strong on even the grayest of late-winter days. ''Oftentimes, ultraviolet exposure is more prevalent during low-light conditions and on cloudy, overcast days than it is at high noon or on sunny days,'' said Dr. Kevin Gee, an optometrist and the director of the Sports Vision Performance Center at the University of Houston. ''For this reason, it's important to wear lenses in all low-light situations, which helps athletes tell texture, brings out background objects more quickly and shields their eyes from wind, objects in the air and glare due to traffic or snow.''"

As T's travel editor, I'm not on the road quite as often as you'd think -- much of my time is actually spent dreaming up trips for others, namely the great writers we publish in our travel issues (the next one is out on March 22, by the way) -- but I do manage to get out and about pretty often. And today (hooray) I am off to Europe, on a whirlwind road trip through the former Yugoslav republics of Croatia and Slovenia.It's my first time to both places, both of which are not only rich in culture, food and wine, architecture and natural beauty but also interesting to me as post-Communist success stories. I'm traveling with some friends from New York - and meeting up with another who lives in Zagreb, Croatia's capital - which, for reasons I won't bore you with, means that my itinerary is a wee bit roundabout, but we're packing in a lot of compelling places: Istria, Croatia's Italian-inflected peninsula on the Adriatic (for some serious eating); the pretty and fascinating Haloze-Zagorje border region (serious drinking - lots of wine here); some of Slovenia's greatest hits, including Lake Bohinj and Lake Bled, the Soca River Valley and of course the capital, Ljubljana (all seriously beautiful). (You can get a snapshot of the two parts of my trip on the maps below.) As always, I'll be scouting for finds and story ideas for T, so the trip is a mixture of work and play. And for anyone who's interested, I'll be doing a first for me: sending impressions from the road to The Moment's Twitter feed, sharing our exploits and discoveries and photos, which, knowing this part of the world - and the madcap group I'm traveling with - should be entertaining.

In a recent Vuitton ad, she sprawls at the feet of her father in Napa, Calif., a book-filled tote nearby. Last week, the filmmaker's vision of a perfect day in Paris was unveiled on French TV in a commercial for the new Miss Dior Chérie L'Eau fragrance. (If it looks familiar, it's because it screened for a microsecond in the United States at the end of last year.) Dressed in a pale pink sleeveless dress, the 21-year-old model Maryna Linchuk rides a bike through the streets of the capital, strolls across the Seine, is fitted in a Dior couture dress, admires roses at a Left Bank florist, nibbles on pastries at a Right Bank patisserie, sprays Miss Dior Chérie on her neck, kisses her boyfriend and is swept into the sky while holding a bouquet of balloons. Coppola set the commercial -- her first -- to Brigitte Bardot singing ""Moi Je Joue"" (""Me, I Play""). The director has described it as ""a charming, catchy melody, a little 'bubble gum.'"" Which is probably the last thing you would have called it in the 1960s, had you heard Bardot's squeal. The model-actress-singer-sex kitten starts sweet, then turns edgy -- not unlike Coppola's last cinematic confection, ""Marie Antoinette."" ""I won, too bad / it's what you deserved / you are my toy,"" goes the second verse. ""I will promise you an inferno of claws and fangs,"" goes the third. The Coppola commercial ends with Bardot's ""Oh! oui, oui,"" omitting her orgasmic cry. Sofia, how could you?"
