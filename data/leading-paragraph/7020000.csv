That’s what the original L.T., Lawrence Taylor, did when he was terrorizing quarterbacks in the 1980’s. Tomlinson’s superb talent is unquestioned, and he seems sure to eventually join Taylor in the Hall of Fame. But he doesn’t have two Super Bowl rings, hasn’t willed his team to greatness, and most importantly hasn’t fundamentally altered strategy on the other side of the line of scrimmage.

2008-01-04T00:00:00Z,"'FOCUS: ELLSWORTH KELLY' Few artists of the so-called Minimalist persuasion have applied the less-is-more aesthetic with the encompassing grace of Ellsworth Kelly. The point is marvelously made by a large, all-Kelly gallery in the Museum of Modern Art's Focus series. The 27 paintings and drawings on view -- many acquired during the past decade -- include several major surprises. Most of the works date from the 1950s, when Mr. Kelly planted many of the seeds of ideas he has explored ever since. They show him devising his severe but evocative vocabulary by studying the world, borrowing from pure geometry and looking at other art. ''Relief With Blue,'' made in 1950, while Mr. Kelly was living in Paris (and on display only through Monday), suggests a glimpse of a white building and blue sky seen through a window partly covered by the curving drape of a white curtain. In a series of 15 drawings from 1951, he enlivens geometric form with an exquisite sense of proportion, dividing modest squares of white paper with lines, grids and areas of black, and then expands these motifs in vivid color."

The sketchbook, revealed this week by its current owner, Doreta Peppa, features intricate renderings of figures from the masterpieces ''The Potato Eaters'' and, above, ''Portrait of Père Tanguy.'' (The sketch is above a detail from the painting.) No claim of original ownership has surfaced since Mrs. Peppa, a writer and daughter of a Greek resistance fighter, discovered the sketchbook while cleaning out her basement two years ago. Since then she has been trying to authenticate the book, believed to have been plundered by the Nazis during their occupation of Greece in World War II. A letter left by her father with the drawings suggests that the notebook was seized from a train after resistance fighters ambushed Nazi forces leaving Athens in 1944. It remains unclear how it fell into Nazi hands. Lawyers and art experts have contended that Mrs. Peppa is now the book's rightful owner."

2008-01-04T00:00:00Z,"CEDAR LAKE CONTEMPORARY BALLET No one has had a greater influence on classical dance over the last two decades than the choreographer William Forsythe. Recently that influence has been greatly amplified by a generation of choreographers that has sprung from the ranks of his Frankfurt-based companies, nourished by his highly collaborative, improvisational strategies. Much of their work is produced in Europe, but this month two former Forsythe dancers, Crystal Pite and Jacopo Godani, are showing pieces as part of Cedar Lake Contemporary Ballet's winter season, which opens on Thursday. Ms. Pite, who is Canadian and danced with Ballet British Columbia for many years, had already created works for several companies when she joined Mr. Forsythe's Ballet Frankfurt in 1996. Since leaving and forming her own troupe, Kidd Pivot, in Vancouver in 2001, Ms. Pite has embellished her early reputation with quirky, angular dances that embrace the awkward and the beautiful in equal measure. A new work for Cedar Lake, ''Ten Duets on a Theme of Rescue,'' is set to music from the soundtrack of the 2002 feature film ''Solaris.'' In rehearsal some months ago, the series of duets was already invested with an arresting and poignant sense of fragility by the dancers."

2008-01-04T00:00:00Z,"O'NEILL FESTIVAL AT 10 When Eugene O'Neill was awarded the Nobel Prize in Literature in 1936 (he is the only American playwright who has been so honored), his speech, delivered in absentia because of health problems, acknowledged a debt to August Strindberg, whom O'Neill called ''that greatest genius of all modern dramatists.'' Many playwrights today would say the same about O'Neill, who wrote with grim candor about his own family and, somehow, a bit about everyone else's at the same time. The annual O'Neill Festival, presented by the Playwrights Theater of New York and the O'Neill at Yale project, celebrates its 10th anniversary, beginning on Friday at the Provincetown Playhouse. The location is certainly fitting: It was the Provincetown Players who produced O'Neill's first New York production, ''Bound East for Cardiff,'' in 1916."

2008-01-04T00:00:00Z,"'MAX & RUBY' Theatreworks/USA's latest production features an oversize lobster, a green alien gorilla, an electric eel and an enormous blue tarantula. But it isn't horror or science fiction. These creatures mostly inhabit the toy chest -- and the imagination -- of little Max, who happens to be an animal, too: a rabbit. He and his big sister, Ruby, star in this musical adaptation, based on Rosemary Wells's storybooks and the ''Max & Ruby'' television series they've inspired. Intended for ages 3 to 10, this show has replaced Ms. Wells's pudgy bunnies with lithe young actors in rabbit ears. (Lee Markham, above left, plays the mischievous Max, and Kelly Felthous, above right, is the motherly Ruby.) But while Glen Berger's script retains the essential sweetness of Ms. Wells's creations, it adds welcome spice. If the story threatens to become too cute, a huge lobster or a giant tarantula waits in the wings."

Only 18 months passed from the time she began writing songs to her release of a No. 1 album in Britain. In between, Lily Allen added her as a friend on MySpace, the music press went crazy, and the record was reportedly rushed to completion. Was the hype justified? That's the topic of the second wave of chatter about Ms. Nash, already starting to look like a backlash. On the pro side, she can be winningly casual, singing about crushes and bad dates with the candor of a diarist (or, perhaps more aptly, blogger). She takes musical cues from Ms. Allen and Regina Spektor, writing sprightly and idiosyncratic songs that barely contain all her words. On ''Foundations'' she trashes a soon-to-be ex in public, then confesses: ''Yes, it was childish, and you got aggressive/And I must admit that I was a bit scared/But it gives me thrills to wind you up.''"

That will force Pittsburgh's offense into the hands of quarterback Ben Roethlisberger. Considering that the Jaguars struggle against the pass, that may not be a bad thing."

Since both teams like to run the ball and both have physical defenses, you can expect a similar contest today. An edge for the Chargers: they are the higher-scoring team, and the Titans are decimated by injuries to their offensive line. A look at how the teams fared this season."
2008-01-06T00:00:00Z,"There is no question that volatility on Wall Street increased last year, and many analysts expect the rockiness to continue in 2008. But 2007 may have seemed especially tumultuous only because the years before it were remarkably calm. There was only one day from 2004 to 2006 when the Dow Jones industrial average moved up or down by more than 2 percent. Last year, amid concerns about the subprime mortgage sector and credit markets in general, swings that large occurred 14 times."

The tests, developed by the Department of Defense, determine qualification for the military (basic math, verbal) and aptitude for certain jobs (mechanical, electronic, automotive). High schools also administer the battery to provide students with guidance on potential careers. The newest section, ''Assembling Objects,'' is used by the Navy to identify recruits with a good sense of spatial relations who can work fast under pressure. Test takers get nine minutes to identify the 16 shapes created when the illustrated fragments are properly fitted together. By that math, you should be able to do the following assemblages -- from the Arco prep guide published by Peterson's (top) and from Barron's ''How to Prepare for the Asvab'' -- in under six.

2008-01-06T00:00:00Z,"As a resident fellow at the American Enterprise Institute and former speechwriter for President Bush, you're surprisingly critical of him in your new book, claiming he has appointed ''consistently mediocre people'' to important jobs and made ''a shambles'' of the Iraq war. Do you see the book as a mea culpa? No. Mea culpa is a kind of hand-wringing, breast-beating, woe-is-me attitude that I don't share. What I am saying is that there is exhaustion, intellectual exhaustion on the part of Republicans and conservatives. And that their long winning streak in Congress has ended? What I am terrified of is that the Republican Party is heading into a period of political defeat. We lost the election in 2006. I am terrified that we can lose the election in 2008. We can lose in 2012, and it will take us half a dozen years to do the rethinking we need to do."

Mukasey has directed prosecutors to examine whether C.I.A. officers obstructed justice or committed other criminal acts in destroying tapes of interrogations of two operatives from Al Qaeda. Top Bush administration lawyers debated whether to destroy the tapes but it is unclear if anyone outside the C.I.A. endorsed the idea.

Lidocaine is a local anesthetic and not a systemic pain reliever, like acetaminophen, with bodywide effects. If given as an injection in someone's rear end, for example, the likelihood of it having any effect on knee pain, as he contends, is practically zero."

Tonight Gus Haynes (Clark Johnson), a city editor struggling with a limited staff because of corporate cutbacks, uses three reporters -- Alma Gutierrez (Michelle Paress), Jeff Price (Todd Scofield) and Scott Templeton (Tom McCarthy) -- to break front-page news that links a politician to a drug dealer.

2008-01-06T00:00:00Z,"The Wild Side Some years ago, a friend suggested that I play a practical joke on the British public.

With such small sheep, you could keep many more on one field; and since European farm subsidies are calculated per sheep.... He and I amused ourselves with the thought of indignant readers spluttering into their coffee. But I'm no longer tempted to make up stories about biotechnology: reality is weirder than anything I'm likely to invent. For example, the other day I met a man -- his name is Goro Yoshizaki -- who wants to breed bluefin tuna from mackerel."

The office warned that the “the city’s fiscal picture could become even darker” if Wall Street’s economic woes worsen or if the housing market, which in Manhattan has remained strong, further declines. The conclusions in the five-page report suggest that whoever succeeds Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg will be saddled with fiscal problems as serious as the ones Mr. Bloomberg inherited when he took office in 2002 as the city was still reeling from 9/11."

Born, 1961 in Fort Worth, TX, he trained at the Chamberlain School of Ballet in Dallas before receiving scholarships to the Joffrey Ballet School and the School of American Ballet. In 1982, he joined ABT II and was later in the corps de ballet of the Metropolitan Opera Company, Zurich Ballet and Bejart Ballet. Over the course of his career, John danced with Rudolf Nureyev, Natalia Makarova, Mikhail Baryshnikov, Twyla Tharp, and was a soloist with Eglevsky Ballet, Colorado Ballet, Dinosaur Dance Company, Keith Young Dance and Garden State Ballet. In 1989, he and Michele Elliman founded Neo Labos Dancetheater, for whom John choreographed and performed in numerous works including ''Certain Measures'', ''Ten Ten Spin'' and ''Angel Ash.'' He choreographed several pieces for TWEED TheaterWorks, including ''Hotel Martinique'' and ''Atomic Opera'', and worked on many film and video projects, including the acclaimed short film ''Lillies''. He regularly returned to Dallas as a guest teacher and choreographer for the Chamberlain Ballet until health problems forced him to stop dancing in 1994. He became an ardent audiophile until he lost his hearing several years later, and was an enthusiastic reader and correspondent, writing dozens of letters weekly to his family and friends. He is survived by his partner and collaborator, Kevin Malony, his mother Jean O'Malley, his sisters Cass O'Malley, Elizabeth McCoy, and Patricia Delgado, many cousins, nieces and nephews, as well as a large, international circle of devoted friends. An incandescent presence and neighborhood fixture in the West Village, John's second home was the Cowgirl Hall of Fame Restaurant on Hudson Street. He will be remembered as a brother, son, friend and dancer, but most of all as someone who never considered surrendering to AIDS, turning every painful step he took into a tenacious and graceful dance.

2008-01-08T14:54:04Z,"(Daniel Barillot/Masterfile)When I learned that an outpost of Barbuto - a stylish restaurant around the corner from my West Village apartment - had opened on the French Caribbean island of Guadeloupe, I scratched my head. What was the chef Jonathan Waxman, known for his seasonal take on traditional Italian dishes, doing on an island that not only has no Italian connection but is also pretty well overlooked by Americans? Turns out the explanation is a fairly simple: when one of Barbuto's partners, Phil Scotti, was visiting Guadeloupe, he happened to meet Valerie Robein, a well respected local restaurateur who was looking to open a new place, and hatched the idea to back her in a Caribbean-inflected version of Barbuto, with Robein helming the stove and Waxman developing the menu. While Barbuto Guadeloupe's lasagna with conch or roast chicken with curry aren't reason enough to make a trip, the restaurant's opening got me thinking again about an island that is said to combine the typical Caribbean assets of sun and sand with what is, let's face it, a real rarity in the region: a vibrant food scene, and one that intriguingly blends both Creole and European influences. Guadeloupe is one of the few major islands I haven't been to, but friends who have tell me the food's unusually good, from excellent morning pastries in the cafés to fresh grilled fish on the beach to more ambitious fare in the restaurants of Deshaies, the cute town where Barbuto is based. What's more, although French tourists in high season do pack the coastal resorts of Grand-Terre, Guadeloupe's eastern half, over on Basse-Terre you can supposedly still get some peace and quiet on the beach in January and February. Even in deepest darkest winter I'm always discouraging my better half from planning Caribbean getaways, in large part because a week without great eating is not my idea of a vacation, but in 2008 I think I'm voting for Guadeloupe. (For an overview of the island, and some hotel and restaurant advice, go here. Been to Guadeloupe? Let me know how you liked it here"

Yesterday we blew our cover when we arrived in Las Vegas for the Consumer Electronics Show (C.E.S.), arguably the preeminent geek convention of the year. Our mission over the next few days will be to indulge our obsession with sexy electronics, browsing millions of doodads in search of good design. More on that later - you see, we aren't kidding about millions. The show sprawls for miles inside the mother of all convention centers. The crush of business men, cheesecake spokesmodels and high-tech signage has us thinking we're in Tokyo, not Nevada. It's an infamously brutal ordeal, and yesterday we saw people passed out on the floor by day's end. According to our buddies at Bits, the Times's technology blog, there's a big microbe scare at C.E.S. this year: Everybody's wiping down with Purell, and one company is even handing out sanitary gloves for germ-free handshakes. Lest we'd forget our surroundings, upon registration all journalists were issued blue and silver backpacks complete with external mesh pockets for water bottles, a waist belt, reflective coating (safety first) and a handy internal organizer that looks awfully pocket-protector like. Rather than wearing it, The Moment opted for the ghetto-chic boom-box shopping bag (above) we snagged at the Lasonic booth. But when the paper started to give, we saw the error of our ways, donned the backpack and accepted the inevitable. Today, we're jumping in again, but this time we're bring the new leopard-print Taser to clear the way."

The priest is said to have borne the bleeding wounds of the crucified Christ on his hands, feet and side for 50 years. Over the weekend, Archbishop Domenico Umberto D’Ambrosio announced his intention to lift the saint from his crypt in southern San Giovanni Rotondo and put the body on display for several months for pilgrims to venerate, starting in April. But other Roman Catholics, among them Francesco Traversi, who heads an association of Padre Pio devotees, are threatening to block the exhumation in court. The popularity of Padre Pio, who was also credited with thousands of miraculous cures during his life, is hard to overestimate. A Catholic magazine found that more Italian Catholics pray to him than any other icon of the faith, including the Virgin Mary or Jesus. Pope John Paul II made him a saint in 2002, four years after his death at 81, at a ceremony that drew one of the biggest Vatican crowds ever."

Relatives and friends of many of the victims were disappointed that Mr. Pickton, a pig farmer arrested in 2002, was found guilty by a jury last month only of second-degree murder, which does not require proof of premeditation. The prosecutors said the judge made errors, including his decision to split the case and put Mr. Pickton on trial on 6 counts of first-degree murder last year, with a trial on the remaining 20 counts to be held this year. Even if the government appeal is successful and Mr. Pickton is convicted on all 26 counts of first-degree murder, it will not change his sentence of life in prison without the chance of parole for 25 years. The remains of the victims, mostly prostitutes, were found buried on his farm in a Vancouver suburb."

2008-01-08T00:00:00Z,"Suzy Welch, a former editor of the Harvard Business Review and the wife of John F. Welch Jr., the former chief executive of General Electric, has agreed to sell the rights to her book “10-10-10” to Scribner, an imprint of Simon & Schuster. A person involved in the negotiations said that Scribner paid Ms. Welch a price in the seven figures for world and audio rights to the book. Based on an article Ms. Welch wrote for O, the Oprah Magazine, in 2006, the book offers strategies for making decisions in which people think about what the consequences of a decision will be in 10 minutes, 10 months and 10 years. Robert Barnett, a Washington lawyer, negotiated the deal on behalf of Ms. Welch. Nan Graham, editor in chief of Scribner, will edit the book with Samantha Martin. Ms. Welch, who wrote the best-selling “Winning” with Mr. Welch, said she originally thought there wasn’t a book beyond the article. But, she said, “I began to encounter this hunger for people who were using it to play out its nuances.” She said the book would include examples from her own life as well as others she has observed using the “10-10-10” process. Susan Moldow, publisher of Scribner, said that although Ms. Welch’s article might seem sufficient for those who wanted to know about the strategy, Ms. Moldow believed the book would sell well. “The Scarsdale Diet fit on a Xerox-ed sheet that you could fit on the front of a refrigerator,” Ms. Moldow said. “And it sold millions and millions of copies. It’s often true that when something strikes an immediate ‘Aha!,’ you really want to have time to meditate on it and try to get to know more about it.”."

2008-01-08T00:00:00Z,"NBC’s remake of “American Gladiators” muscled to a strong start on Sunday.

In total viewers, however, “American Gladiators” was less impressive, drawing an average of 12 million from 9 to 11 p.m. ABC’s “Cashmere Mafia,” by comparison, which made its debut on Sunday at 10 p.m., attracted 10.7 million viewers but markedly lower ratings in the 18-to-49 set. “Cashmere Mafia” also benefited from a plum time slot following ABC’s “Desperate Housewives” (19.8 million), the only show to outpace “American Gladiators” on the night among adults 18 to 49. ABC, NBC and CBS finished in a virtual tie for first in that demographic over all on Sunday. CBS, buoyed by an overrun of its afternoon football coverage during the 7 p.m. hour that was followed by one of the highest rated editions of “60 Minutes” in recent years (19 million), won the race in total viewers."

Eliot Spitzer is expected to strike a more conciliatory note with the Legislature in his annual address to lawmakers today — the first political step of the embattled governor’s second year in office.

Eliot Spitzer’s second State of the State address this afternoon will strike a conciliatory tone and focus heavily on meat-and-potato issues like schools, property taxes and health insurance as he seeks to regain his political footing, turn attention away from the multiple and potentially crippling ethics investigations he still faces, and build the foundation for his second year in office.Such a speech would not be so different from Mr. Spitzer’s first such address a year ago, despite the decline in the governor’s fortunes since then. Mr. Spitzer’s first state of the state address mixed broad reform proposals unpopular with Albany lawmakers (campaign finance reform and non-partisan redistricting) with a large platter of proposals that offered something for everyone, whether more education spending for Democrats or worker’s compensation reform for Republicans."

The prosecutor said Mr. Qureshi, originally from Pakistan, planned a “two- to three-week operation” either in Pakistan or Afghanistan, possibly against Western troops. He was carrying nearly $18,000, a telescopic night sight and a computer hard drive loaded with militant Islamic tracts, the court was told. Prosecutors said that he had trained with jihadist groups in Pakistan linked to Al Qaeda and that his skills included encrypting e-mail messages. The court was also told of e-mail exchanges he had with Samina Malik, known as the “lyrical terrorist,” who received a suspended sentence in November for keeping a library of terrorist material. Ms. Malik, a clerk at a Heathrow newsstand who wrote poetry limning her passion for Islamic militancy, received an e-mail message from Mr. Qureshi asking about security arrangements at Heathrow.

Returning to Britain from Pakistan two weeks after his mother’s death to resume his first-year studies at Oxford, he gave a battery of feisty answers to reporters who questioned the Pakistan Peoples Party’s decision to pick him as his mother’s successor as party chairman. To a reporter who suggested he had been appointed to the post “like a piece of family furniture,” he said he had not sought it, but added, “It was recognized at this moment in crisis the party needed a close association with my mother through the bloodline.” Asked if he feared for his life, he replied: “How many Bhuttos can you kill? From every house a Bhutto will come.” Noting that the party had selected his father, Asif Ali Zardari, as the party’s co-chairman until he finishes his university degree, he said he would step “gradually and carefully” into politics. He renewed the family’s demands for a United Nations inquiry into his mother’s death and spoke out against American support for the generals who have ruled Pakistan for more than half its 60-year existence. “The problem is that dictatorships breed extremism, and once the U.S. stops supporting dictators, we can successfully tackle extremists,” he said."

2008-01-09T00:00:00Z,"“Dance War,” a spinoff of ABC’s popular series “Dancing With the Stars,” attracted only modest interest in the ratings on Monday, drawing 11 million viewers from 8 to 10 p.m., Nielsen estimated. Among adults 18 to 49, the reality competition between the choreographers Bruno Tonioli and Carrie Ann Inaba earned about half the ratings of the most recent premiere of “Dancing With the Stars” in September. The dancers also fell well short of NBC’s “American Gladiators” during the 8 p.m. hour. That new reality show, despite drawing just 10.9 million total viewers, would have led the night among the 18-to-49 set but for Fox’s football coverage, the Bowl Championship Series, which averaged more than 20 million viewers total. NBC ranked second for the night behind Fox, earning solid numbers from “Deal or No Deal” at 9 (10.7 million) and the premiere of the fourth season of “Medium” at 10 (9.6 million). ABC’s “October Road” drew a disappointing five million viewers at 10."
2008-01-09T00:00:00Z,"For the first time since television’s late-night shows returned to the air last week, David Letterman was able to nose out Jay Leno in the ratings. It was just for one show, Monday night, and Mr. Letterman’s lead was not sizable, but Mr. Leno had won the first three nights. Their competition resumed last Wednesday, when most of the late-night hosts came back after supporting the writers’ strike for two months. Mr. Leno is working without his writing staff, which is still on strike against his “Tonight Show” on NBC, while Mr. Letterman, above, was able to return with writers to his CBS show because of a separate deal his production company made with the Writers Guild of America. Mr. Letterman has also been able to book the normal roster of movie-star guests; on Monday night he had Tom Hanks, while Mr. Leno had the upstart Republican presidential candidate Ron Paul. In the overnight ratings, measuring the country’s 65 largest cities, Mr. Letterman had a 4 rating on Monday to Mr. Leno’s 3.8. (Each point is worth 787,659 households.) But in their shows’ first half-hour, when Mr. Leno is performing a monologue over the opposition of the writers’ guild, he still beat Mr. Letterman, with a 4.5 rating to a 4.3. CBS’s thin victory margin continued on the 12:35 a.m. shows, where Craig Ferguson enjoyed a rare ratings victory over NBC’s Conan O’Brien, with a 1.9 rating to a 1.8 for Mr. O’Brien."

She had been off the air since the incident and had been scheduled to return on Monday. But in a statement that day, the station said she “has been released from her contract effective immediately.” Ms. Lane was previously the subject of reports that she had e-mailed images of herself in a bikini to a married ESPN sports anchor. Michael Colleran, the president and general manager of KYW-TV, said, “After assessing the overall impact of a series of incidents resulting from judgments she has made, we have concluded that it would be impossible for Alycia to continue to report the news as she herself has become the focus of so many news stories.” In a statement, Paul Rosen, Ms. Lane’s lawyer, declared the termination to be contrary to the terms of her contract."

Unlike a lot of picture-perfect fruit, including giant strawberries, these Amaou strawberries (pronounced ah-ma-oh), flown in from Japan, offer a heady perfume and an uncommon depth of rich flavor in each juicy mouthful. They are grown in greenhouses in Fukuoka Prefecture in southern Japan. Their name is a kind of acronym for red (akai), round (marui), big (ookii) and delicious (umai). The plants are pruned to encourage the largest berries, which are then tended so they do not touch the ground. But such care comes at a price.

His art reflected a distaste for the easy consumerism of the post-war boom, the advertising which prodded it, and its effect on American art and culture. His multiple exhibitions culminated in one at the inaugural of the Buchenwald Museum."

Outside, they rolled him over the uneven sidewalk, pulling the chair toward Pay-O-Matic, a check-cashing shop on Ninth Avenue, seeking to cash Mr. Cintron’s Social Security check. A crowd gathered, a police detective eating his lunch called the authorities and soon the men were arrested."

Second, the toilet is the product of an on-and-off decades efforts (detailed below) by city officials to, uh, serve the needs of New Yorkers.So it was understandable that the city officials reveled in the toilet paper roll-cutting ceremony (which, fittingly, they did with their hands) on Madison Avenue, between 23rd and 24th Streets.

2008-01-10T00:00:00Z,"AFTER seeing ''An Inconvenient Truth'' two years ago, Daniel Heuser, a second-grade teacher who is now 43, put compact fluorescent bulbs in nearly every light fixture in his two-story house in Chapel Hill, N.C., to the dismay of his wife, Jane. When the bulbs were installed, ''the color was a little bit off,'' said Ms. Heuser, 41, making things look dull, especially in the beige-wallpapered kitchen. Even worse, she said, was the upstairs bathroom, where the buzzing common to many compact fluorescents was particularly noticeable. ''You wake up and you're kind of groggy, and then you see these curly light bulbs, and it's buzzing, and you're like -- ugh.'' Mr. Heuser said he, too, is bothered by the way the bulbs he's installed in the upstairs hallway ''make everyone look greenish.'' Their children, Katie, 11, and Benji, 8, dislike the slight delay when they switch on a light. Nonetheless, he is happy with the decision to use compact fluorescents, and he believes it's a morally correct choice."

With these in mind (along with a desire to minimize his monthly Con Edison bill), Mr. Chipman used a living room renovation a year and a half ago as an opportunity to experiment with compact fluorescent lightbulbs in every room of his Greenwich Village town house. A result: nearly all incandescent bulbs have been replaced by compact fluorescents, and the family has happily adjusted to the change, he said. In the living room, for example, where there are four recessed lights along one wall, Mr. Chipman tested six dimmable bulbs and determined that one made by Greenlite with the same hue as incandescents worked best in certain spots, attractively lighting an exposed brick wall and maple bookshelves. A Satco brand bulb with a slightly whiter hue made a limestone-tiled fireplace in the middle of the wall look best, so he installed one above it."

This show's 26 semi-abstract paintings of houses and buildings, dating from 1993 to 2007, may resemble dutiful exercises made under the tutelage of an old-fashioned British formalist. (Mr. James, born in 1960, is British.) Look closer, however, and you'll be hooked. Mr. James is not a finicky representational painter. Following painters like Matisse and Klee, he simplifies his subjects into flat planes or matrices of gridded lines. Some pictures, like views of a Roman aqueduct or of a street corner that Edward Hopper might have painted, look as if they were copied from photographs."

That viewer was led down a labyrinth of corridors at the Frankfurt Opera House, where Mr. Siegal was part of William Forsythe's Frankfurt Ballet. Then, in a darkened room, the observer was offered a whispered narrative of espionage and intrigue, punctuated by the choreographer's slippery, disembodied movement. The American-born Mr. Siegal -- who danced with Doug Elkins, Zvi Gotheiner and Janis Brenner before joining the Frankfurt Ballet in 1997 -- has long been interested in the disjunctions between performance and reality. In ''Stranger'' his confessions about spying and lying took on an unsettling, all-too-plausible resonance that notably undermined the comfortable space between audience and artist. Mr. Siegal's work has been presented primarily in Europe, and his company, the Bakery, is based in Paris and Frankfurt. Last year the second installment of his ''Stranger'' series, ''Stranger/Stranger Report'' (with Mr. Siegal, above), had its premiere at the Théâtre National de Chaillot in Paris.

The son of a professor of Business Law at Oregon State University, Jay had an abiding love for the rule of law and put that love to work for the International Association of Laryngectomees. As a member of the Board of Directors, he was a longtime member and chairman of the Bylaws Committee. In addition to working on year-toyear changes, he was responsible for a comprehensive revision of the bylaws several years ago. It was a massive undertaking since, over the years, inconsistencies had developed and Jay worked hard to clean up this essential IAL document. Before becoming a laryngectomee in 1991 he was a self employed artist and illustrator, a graduate of both Oregon State University and the Arts Center College of Design in Pasenda, CA. Jay was a pillar of his local support club (Nu Voices of Mount Sinai Hospital) and was involved in all aspects of its work. Especially active in Tobacco Awareness, he spoke to thousands of students over the years, primarily at Washington Irving High School. The mounds of letters from students who wrote him saying they would never smoke and would encourage family members to stop smoking was a source of great pride and joy for him. Also active in working to make New York's public places smoke-free, he participated in the famous demonstration with activist Michael Moore at the corporate headquarters of the Philip Morris Tobacco Company to protest their advertising, particularly to young people. The demonstration later moved to the home of the CEO of Philip Morris where demonstrators decorated trees with empty cigarette packages. Jay and his wife Jane loved the theater. When they attended the IAL's Annual Meeting and danced at the banquet, people loved to refer to them as ''Fred and Ginger.'' Jay helped new laryngectomees and their families learn that there is a life, and a full one, after a laryngectomy. Memorial Sloan - Kettering awarded Jay a Certificate of Recognition in honor of his constant devotion for his many years of compassionate service and expertise as a patient-to-patient volunteer. We celebrate the entire life of Jay LeMaster, especially his unselfish attention to his fellow laryngectomees whenever he found one in need of help, answers or inspiration.

So as Mr. Richardson, New Mexico's governor, ended his presidential bid Thursday, before about 300 well-wishers at the Statehouse in Santa Fe, he had a nice word for the candidates in the Democratic field. Yes, even for former Senator Mike Gravel of Alaska, who is still in the race. Mr. Richardson paid tribute to two former candidates, saying of Senator Joseph R.

2008-01-11T00:00:00Z,"'SCREEN TEST' For six years in the 1990s Rob Roth, a downtown video director and designer, promoted a ''cyber-fetish-nightlife spectacle'' called Click + Drag at the Chelsea club Mother. The party was famous for its over-the-top costumed crowd and raunchy attitude. When the club closed, Mr. Roth didn't pack up his latex and strobe lights. He simply went legit. One result is ''Screen Test,'' a rock opera starring Theo Kogan, formerly of the all-female punk group Lunachicks. Ms. Kogan, above, and her new band, the Skyscrapers, composed the music for the show, which blends theater, performance art, dance and video installation as a meditation on artifice, old-school Hollywood glamour and new-school politics. ''It's a statement about facade, about what's real,'' Mr. Roth said. ''A lot of the dialogue is about submerging yourself in a fantasy world. Especially in a political climate like today, I just feel like we have to create our own fantasy world; it's a survival mechanism to guard against the ugliness that's outside.'' The hourlong show had its premiere last year as part of Performance Space 122's multimedia Coil Festival, and is featured this year as well."

2008-01-11T00:00:00Z,"NYC WINTER JAZZFEST For the next five days the Association of Performing Arts Presenters converges on New York for its annual conference, a gathering of industry types who share (among other things) a pressing need for new artists and ideas. And for the fourth consecutive year the producer Brice Rosenbloom is courting that constituency with the NYC Winter Jazzfest, spread throughout the three floors of the Knitting Factory. For conference attendees as well as the nearly two dozen participating groups, the aim of this marathon, or smorgasbord, is exposure. But since it's open to the public and a bargain ($25 for the night), it also translates into one of the more exciting jazz events of the season. As in previous years Mr. Rosenbloom's lineup favors slightly experimental artists, often in working bands. This includes ensembles led by the Iraqi-American trumpeter Amir ElSaffar, the Israeli bassist Omer Avital and the South African tenor saxophonist Zim Ngqawana. (Internationalism is another hallmark of the festival, which was partly supported this year by the French Embassy and the Mexican Institute of Culture.) Chamber music will be represented by Magic Circle, a trio organized by the trumpeter Dave Douglas; and another trio consisting of the Czech violinist Iva Bittova, the Australian pianist Lisa Moore and the Bronx-born clarinetist Don Byron. The bassist Ben Allison will lead Man Size Safe, a quintet with a new album releasing this month. Other groups will reflect the ambitions of the saxophonists Donny McCaslin, J. D. Allen, Matana Roberts and Jerome Sabbagh; the guitarists Brad Shepik and Doug Wamble; and the keyboardists Wayne Horvitz and Eldar, among others."

2008-01-12T00:00:00Z,"An obituary Friday about Sir Edmund Hillary, who with Tenzing Norgay became the first to scale Mount Everest, misidentified the route they took to the summit. It is the South Col, not the South Tor. In comparing the feat to one by Charles A. Lindbergh, the obituary misstated Lindbergh&#8217;s accomplishment. Though he was the first to make a solo nonstop trans-Atlantic flight, in 1927, he was not the first aviator to make the nonstop crossing; John W. Alcock and Arthur W. Brown did so together in 1919, from Newfoundland to Ireland. In addition, the precedents for Sir Edmund&#8217;s reaching the South Pole in 1957-58 were referred to incorrectly. Robert Falcon Scott reached the pole in 1912, and the United States built a base there in 1956; Sir Edmund was not the first to reach the pole since Roald Amundsen in 1911."

The paintings were stolen in August 2004 in a daylight raid on the Munch Museum in Oslo. They were recovered by police nearly two years later, and are undergoing repairs for scrapes, punctures, loose paint and moisture damage. Last month the three men appealed their 2006 sentences. In answer, Norway’s highest court unanimously ruled that the prison terms for two of the men, Petter Tharaldsen and Stian Skjold, were not long enough, considering the “irreplaceable national cultural value” of the paintings. The court increased Mr. Tharaldsen’s sentence by one year, to 10 ½ years, and Mr. Skjold’s sentence by six months, to six years. The court did reject the conviction of a third man, Bjoern Hoen, saying that testimony in his trial may have been tainted, and sent his case back for a new trial."

The Patriots last lost a home playoff game in December 1978. That marks nine straight playoff wins at home. They will also be playing their 22nd playoff game since 1994, the highest total in the N.F.L. in that period. The Patriots face a popular upset pick in Jacksonville.

''I was on a two-week trip with my eldest daughter, Shelby. I told my children that when each of them got to be 16, I'd go somewhere in the world with them. She's a pretty hard-core distance runner and would go run every day. That day, she chose to run way the heck up the road, probably 10 miles, while I chose to run around the ruins. I remember running through there and stopping to look at the workmanship. It was early morning, and there were plenty of places the light would be coming through doorways or striking at interesting angles that made some amazing patterns. As a parent, it's fun -- this kid is fully capable, more capable than me, to do physical stuff.

She had celebrated her 100th birthday on November 28th. Born in Butler, Pennsylvania, in 1907, she grew up in Erie. She attended Oberlin College and graduated from the University of Wisconsin with a B.A. in journalism. After working briefly in that field, she became a homemaker. In 1954, upon divorcing her first husband, she re-entered the workplace and -as a single mother -continued raising her two children. She worked for a year as a secretary and attended nightschool to acquire a degree in education, then became a teacher of history and English at secondary schools in suburban Cleveland. After obtaining a certificate in guidance counseling, she served for many years as college counselor and dean at Laurel School in Shaker Heights, Ohio. From 1973 to 1978, she sat on the board of trustees at Ohio University. In 1975, she attended her fiftieth highschool reunion in Erie and got reacquainted with William T. Harper of Rochester. Two months later, they married and Dorothy moved to Rochester. She joined the Century Club, renewed her interest in ballroom dancing, played bridge avidly, traveled abroad frequently and served as a volunteer at several charities. She embraced life, and endured its setbacks stoically and with a dry wit. She took a serious interest in civic affairs and occasionally sent her opinions to Rochester's Democrat and Chronicle; in 1991, that newspaper honored her with its Golden Pen Award. Dorothy Harper is survived by her daughter, Elizabeth Stillinger of Westport, Connecticut; her son, Richard Johns of Remsenburg, New York; her stepson, William Thayer Harper of Rochester; seven grandchildren and seven great-grandchildren. Her husband died in 1997. A memorial service was held Saturday, January 12th at The Highlands at Pittsford. Donations may be made to the Fisher Center for Alzheimer's Research Foundation, Planned Parenthood of America, or to a charity of the donor's choice."

One night in 1968, as the oft-told story goes, she arrived at La Côte Basque wearing Yves Saint Laurent's ''le smoking.'' When the maître d' forbade her to dine in pants, she promptly took them off, handed them to her husband and walked into the restaurant wearing nothing but the tuxedo jacket. Four decades later, the woman in a tuxedo jacket is still the most confident, subversive, soigné one in the room. ''It allows her to be very sexy, while leaving space for the imagination,'' said the London designer Jens Laugesen, who opened his spring show with an unforgettable metallic jacket."

A Technion Guardian who had reached the highest level of support, Mrs. Kellner was awarded the Albert Einstein award, the highest ATS honor, in 1988, and an Honorary Fellowship from the Technion in 1999. She was a member of the Technion International Board of Governors, the ATS national Board of Directors, and past president of the Southern California Chapter and the Western Region. Some of the many projects the Kellners supported include the Dorothy and Martin Kellner Amphitheater, the Dorothy and Martin Kellner Fund for Multidisciplinary Programs in Gerontology, and the Coler-California Visitors Center. Active in civic affairs, she was president of the California League of Women Voters and a member of the California Commission on Aging, and was appointed by California's governor to the chairmanship of the State Committee on Long-Term Care. Recently, Mrs. Kellner earned a Ph.D. from UCLA in gerontology. With her enthusiasm and intelligence she attracted many new supporters to the organization, including national officers.

2008-01-13T00:00:00Z,"LeMASTER--Jay, Jerome Lloyd, Jr., 80, beloved husband of Jane, December 27 at Mary Manning Walsh Nursing Home after a long illness. The son of a professor of Business Law at Oregon State University, Jay had an abiding love for the rule of law and put that love to work for the International Association of Laryngectomees. As a member of the Board of Directors, he was a longtime member and chairman of the Bylaws Committee. In addition to working on year-toyear changes, he was responsible for a comprehensive revision of the bylaws several years ago. It was a massive undertaking since, over the years, inconsistencies had developed and Jay worked hard to clean up this essential IAL document. Before becoming a laryngectomee in 1991 he was a self employed artist and illustrator, a graduate of both Oregon State University and the Arts Center College of Design in Pasenda, CA. Jay was a pillar of his local support club (Nu Voices of Mount Sinai Hospital) and was involved in all aspects of its work. Especially active in Tobacco Awareness, he spoke to thousands of students over the years, primarily at Washington Irving High School. The mounds of letters from students who wrote him saying they would never smoke and would encourage family members to stop smoking was a source of great pride and joy for him. Also active in working to make New York's public places smoke-free, he participated in the famous demonstration with activist Michael Moore at the corporate headquarters of the Philip Morris Tobacco Company to protest their advertising, particularly to young people. The demonstration later moved to the home of the CEO of Philip Morris where demonstrators decorated trees with empty cigarette packages. Jay and his wife Jane loved the theater. When they attended the IAL's Annual Meeting and danced at the banquet, people loved to refer to them as ''Fred and Ginger.'' Jay helped new laryngectomees and their families learn that there is a life, and a full one, after a laryngectomy. Memorial Sloan - Kettering awarded Jay a Certificate of Recognition in honor of his constant devotion for his many years of compassionate service and expertise as a patient-to-patient volunteer. We celebrate the entire life of Jay LeMaster, especially his unselfish attention to his fellow laryngectomees whenever he found one in need of help, answers or inspiration. Donations may be sent in his honor to Post Treatment Resource Program, Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center, 1275 York Ave., NY, NY 10021."

Fortunately, some of it is for their music. They recorded ''U R A Fever,'' the first single off their new album, in the late hours of the night. You can tell. It's a stark, sexy, slow-burner of a tune -- ''a perfect song,'' as Ms. Mosshart put it. But it is the video, shot by Sophie Muller, that's raising temperatures online. Inspired by Andy Warhol's ''Outer and Inner Space,'' a 16-millimeter split-screen film starring Edie Sedgwick talking to herself, the video, which was shot with the same type of Norelco camera that Warhol used, is the grittiest, grainiest, most glam-rock two minutes on YouTube. Shot in the old pub that the couple now call home, it is a stylized glimpse into their art-punk lives: the vintage jukeboxes; the tattered brocade couch; Ms. Mosshart, in a Sass & Bide sequin jacket, smearing lipstick across her mouth. You can't watch it just once."

If you're like us, there's probably only so much talk about ""cashmere 8-yarn tweed in ecru"" you can take. Thankfully, a lot of the action during fashion week happens off the catwalk. The big scandale of the week has been over Tommy Fazio, the men's fashion director of Bergdorf Goodman, being unceremoniously asked to vacate his front-row seat at Saturday night's Versace show. We spoke to Fazio afterwards who said that he was asked by a clipboard Nazi to make room for one of Beyonce's posse. Not surprisingly, Fazio put away the check book and instantly canceled his Versace showroom appointment. Oops....Speaking of Beyonce, the singer and her boo, Jay-Z, walked in and straight out of the GQ party on Saturday when they realized there was no VIP room for them...Lots of ""aw-shucks, he so deserves it"" talk about John Bartlett's being given a lifeline by Liz Claiborne, which has signed Bartlett to oversee its men's line...The buzz late Sunday night had the Spice Girls showing up en masse to today's Roberto Cavalli show. (It would make sense as their concert in London last week may as well have been a Cavalli advertorial, given the number of shout-outs Victoria Beckham gave the designer.) We'll let you know later if the rumor pans out to be true. Till then, baci.Read all of The Moment's coverage of the Milan men's fashion shows and after-hours shenanigans."

2008-01-14T00:00:00Z,"8 P.M. (TCM) MARTIN SCORSESE PRESENTS VAL LEWTON: THE MAN IN THE SHADOWS As a young Russian immigrant turned editorial assistant to the producer David O. Selznick, Val Lewton conceived the boom shot in ''Gone With the Wind'' in which Scarlett walks among dead and wounded Confederate soldiers. (Never mind that Lewton advised Selznick not to do the film in the first place because he thought ''Gone With the Wind'' was a lousy book.) But Lewton was also a prolific writer of everything from novels to pornography. This documentary says that when an RKO executive was told that he wrote ''horrible novels'' but heard ''horror novels,'' Lewton (above with a staff member) was put in charge of low-budget horror films. What could have been mere collages of shock and gore were, in Lewton's hands, transformed into psychological poetry built of shadow and sound. This 90-minute film, produced and narrated by Mr. Scorsese, is followed by a marathon of the films Lewton produced: ''Cat People'' (1942) at 9:30, ''I Walked With a Zombie'' (1943) at 10:45, ''The Leopard Man'' (1943) at 1:30 a.m., ''The Seventh Victim'' (1943) at 2:45, ''The Curse of the Cat People'' (1944) at 4, ''The Body Snatcher'' (1945) at 5:15, ''Isle of the Dead'' (1945) at 6:30 and ''Bedlam'' (1946) at 7:45. 7 P.M.

2008-01-15T00:00:00Z,"BIG FARE INCREASES After United Airlines raised domestic fares across the board by $50 a round trip on Friday, most major carriers quickly followed with similar increases on many routes, according to FareCompare.com. The reason was sharply higher fuel costs. Delta Air Lines raised its round-trip fares by $50 immediately after United’s move. American Airlines also posted $50 round-trip increases on 55 percent of its route system, though ""conspicuously absent"" are increases on its routes that overlap with many Southwest Airlines routes, said Rick Seaney, the chief executive of FareCompare.com. Then on Monday, Northwest Airlines also joined in the $50 increase on most of its routes. Continental Airlines, which initially raised fares by $50 on some routes on Friday, withdrew the increases Monday morning, but Mr. Seaney said it was unclear whether Continental might reverse course again soon. This was the second broad fare increase in 2008, and the 10th since last Labor Day, Mr. Seaney said, adding: ""It seems the legacy airlines, United in particular, are forgoing the nickel-and-dime strategy of increases every few weeks and are going for the whole enchilada at one time.""."

2008-01-15T00:00:00Z,"NBC&#8217;s bare-bones version of the &#8220;65th Annual Golden Globes&#8221; attracted just 5.8 million viewers on Sunday night, a small fraction of the 20 million who tuned in to the awards show a year ago, according to Nielsen&#8217;s estimates. A two-hour &#8220;Dateline&#8221; special, featuring interviews with the nominees and preceding the 9 p.m. announcement show fared no better, drawing only 4.4 million. Combined, the three-hour broadcast delivered a dismal 1.3 rating in the critical demographic of adults 18 to 49, a far cry from the 6.5 rating the show earned over prime time on a Monday last January. The big hit on Sunday was Fox&#8217;s premiere of &#8220;Terminator: The Sarah Connor Chronicles,&#8221; which attracted 18.3 million viewers at 8 p.m. and the highest ratings by far of any new series this season. Although &#8220;Terminator&#8221; benefited from following a football game on Fox that attracted more than 35 million viewers during the 7 p.m. hour, no other scripted series debut on any broadcast network has done better in the 18-to-49 set in three years. The last scripted series debut on a broadcast network to earn higher ratings among adults 18 to 49 was CBS&#8217;s &#8220;Numb3rs&#8221; on Jan. 23, 2005. Fox easily led the night&#8217;s ratings, followed by CBS and ABC. NBC ranked fourth. Part one of CBS&#8217;s &#8220;Comanche Moon&#8221; drew 15.8 million viewers."

The waterfalls (above, in a rendering) have been designed to be environmentally friendly and will be in New York Harbor at Pier 35 in Lower Manhattan, at the foot of the Brooklyn Bridge and between Piers 4 and 5 in Brooklyn and at Governors Island. Money for the project, estimated to cost about $15 million, comes entirely from private funds, and the Economic Development Corporation estimates that the waterfalls will bring more than $50 million to the city’s economy. “Throughout history we have always taken water for granted,” said Mr. Eliasson in a telephone interview from his Berlin studio. “Now people can engage in the physical nature of something as epic as a waterfall.”."

The book, a series of monologues and dialogues about characters in the Middle Ages, is illustrated by Robert Byrd and published by Candlewick Press. Its format is different from the more traditional novels that have characterized past Newbery winners. The winner of the Randolph Caldecott Medal for the most distinguished American picture book for children was &#8220;The Invention of Hugo Cabret,&#8221; by Brian Selznick. That book, published by Scholastic Press, is also different from the more traditional short picture books for young children that win the Caldecott medal. &#8220;Hugo Cabret&#8221; is a novel told in blocks of text interspersed with 284 pages of black-and-white drawings."

Judge Braslow called the new witnesses &#8220;a cavalcade of nefarious scoundrels&#8221; &#151; not &#8220;characters.&#8221; (The error also appeared in articles on Dec. 22 about the voiding of the conviction and on Dec. 28 about Mr. Tankleff&#8217;s release.)

Two Web sites owned by the commission, the Brussels-based executive for the 27 European Union nations, infringe copyright laws by linking to Belgian newspaper articles free, according to Copiepresse, a copyright group for French- and German-language newspapers. A Brussels court, asked by the group to look at its claim, appointed an expert to study how information is gathered for the E.U. sites. “Once the expert has submitted his report, we may decide to file a lawsuit,” said Margaret Boribon, the group’s secretary general. A Brussels court in February ruled Google had violated Belgian copyright laws by publishing links to the newspapers without permission and ordered the company to remove the links or pay a daily fine of 25,000 euros ($37,000)."

Early this month, the librarian of Congress, James H.

As of now the Library of Congress is still classifying the works of Irish and Welsh writers under subcategories of English literature, but a spokesman, Matt Raymond, said the library has yet to receive any complaints."

In a statement on Monday, the college said its library expert, Armin Schlechter, found the answer in a copy of the works of Cicero, where, in 1503, Agostino Vespucci, a Florentine official and friend of Leonardo&#8217;s, wrote in the margins that the artist was working on a portrait of Lisa del Giocondo. Surprise? For centuries the Mona Lisa has been known in Italian as La Gioconda.

2008-01-17T00:00:00Z,"RIKLIS--Judith Stern, a proud daughter of Israel, died January 15 in New York City where she lived. She was born 83 years ago to one of Tel Aviv's early families. Her grandfather was Aharon-Zelig Krinkin, an emigrant from Czarist Russia, who established one of Tel Avivs first pharmacies. (The phone number was ''23''.) Judith was raised in Tel Aviv and graduated from the Gymnasia Herzliya, the first school in what was then Palestine to teach exclusively in Hebrew. It was there that she met her future husband, Meshulam Riklis, the Israeli-American financier and philanthropist. With him and their first-born, the couple went to America to attend college. They settled for a time in Minneapolis where both Judith and Meshulam taught Hebrew school and Meshulam worked also as a stock broker. The couple eventually moved to the New York area where Judith raised her three children, Mona Ackerman, Marcia Riklis and Ira D. Riklis. After the Riklis marriage ended in divorce, Judith maintained homes in both New York and Jerusalem with Isaac Moyal, her companion until his death. Judith took a passionate interest in the Jewish state, contributing to many charities, including the Hadassah Hospital, the Bat Sheva dance troupe and the Soldiers Welfare Association. A building on the Mount Scopus campus of the Hebrew University is named for her. Judith was a warm woman, devoted to her family. She loved and supported the arts and had a keen eye for painting. In addition to her children and her daughter-inlaw, Diana Riklis, Judith is survived by six grandchildren, Ari Ackerman, Gila (and Roy) Steinbock, Jordana (and Ben) Cooperberg, Talia (and Andrew) Day, Daniella Hirschfeld and David Hirschfeld; four great - grandchildren, Layla, Ayelet, Leo and Leora. The funeral will be at Riverside Memorial Chapel, 333 Amsterdam Avenue, at 11:45am, Thursday January 17. The family will sit Shiva at the Riklis home, 936 Fifth Avenue. In lieu of flowers, donations will be greatly appreciated to American Friends of the Tel Aviv Foundation. RIKLIS--Judith Stern. A special woman who lived an interesting and full life. Always gracious and giving to her friends and generous to her charities. But at the end of the day, it was always about her family that she loved and adored. Our heartfelt condolences to Mona, Marcia, Ira and their families. Edi and Nancy Dunst RIKLIS--Judith. The officers, Board of Directors, and staff of UJA-Federation of New York mourn with profound sadness the loss of Judith Riklis, who was the wife of Meshulam Riklis, a UJA-Federation honorary officer and life trustee, and the beloved mother of Marcia Riklis, Dr. Mona Ackerman, and Ira D. Riklis, and motherin-law of Diana Riklis, treasured and inspiring leaders of the New York Jewish community. Through their generosity, leadership, and commitment, they have strengthened our ability to serve those in need, making a lasting impact on all New Yorkers and the Jewish community in Israel and throughout the world. We extend our deepest sympathies to the entire Riklis family, including her six grandchildren and four great-grandchildren. John M. Shapiro, President Jerry W. Levin, Chair of the Board John S.

2008-01-17T00:00:00Z,"In Manhattan, real estate is destiny. Consider Julia Trotta's new gallery: at about 100 square feet, Fake Estate, as Ms. Trotta calls it, began life as a utility closet for a photographer's studio in the Chelsea Arts Building. The photographer adopted three children from Ethiopa and eventually left the city, Ms. Trotta said, but kept his studio. The closet was advertised for rent on www.craigslist.org as a storage area, she said, for $650 (now $725). ''When I took it, the janitors were poking fun at me and that's how I found out,'' she said. Nonetheless, its proportions were good and it came with its own small foyer, a kind of anteroom of perhaps 20 square feet. So Ms. Trotta, who had been showing works of several artists at her apartment on Chambers Street, decided to turn it into a gallery. (Ms. Trotta, 25, is the granddaughter of Linda Nochlin, the feminist art historian, and shares her grandmother's general feistiness; she studied what she called ''naughty art history,'' or controversy in the arts, at New York University.)"

One proposal, to collect DNA samples from anyone arrested for a crime in the city, could be tough to sell, especially to state legislators, who took seven years to approve a similar provision for people who had been convicted of felonies and some misdemeanors."

He showed the shrunken blazer, a style he has done before (before Mr. Browne), as if to express the general distaste and contempt that young men have for this formal look. They scorn it, and so does Junya, now showing the coat with ties and shirts that are so glossy and colorful as to perhaps tempt the militant boys into an establishment uniform. A number of the jackets combined classic tweeds with bits of other fabrics, seemingly from a rag bin. OK, he made his point, and didn't sit on it proudly or for too long."

That probably explains why Bill Clinton, who was as publicly unflappable a candidate as you will ever find in American politics, lost his cool yet again Wednesday (it's been happening every six days or so) while lecturing a television reporter on the inherent unfairness of the Nevada caucus system. Of course, Clinton is a persuasive man, but his tirade would have been more convincing had anyone in the Clinton camp complained about Nevada's system before the powerful culinary unions endorsed Barack Obama. And that probably explains why a judge in Nevada ruled Thursday that the caucuses should go on as planned. (Clinton's opposition to the plan would also have been more credible, by the way, had Hillary Rodham Clinton herself not noted, after the Iowa caucuses, that a lot of Iowa's shift workers hadn't been able to take part. Fair enough, but can you really advocate helping workers caucus in Iowa, where you think they would have voted for you, and then argue against exactly that in Nevada, where you fear they might not?)"

Mr. Bronson is the surviving member of General Idea, a group of three artists and lovers who were together from 1969 to 1994. Since his partners, Jorge Zontal and Felix Partz, died of AIDS in the 1990s, Mr. Bronson has worked alone, but not really alone. As an artist, mentor of artists, healer and gay role model, he remains, in one way or another, a collaborator. That's what this rich show is about. Photographs in the front room form a recap of Mr. Bronson's creative life so far, from nude self-portraits made in 1969, to a General Idea poster, to a 2001 portrait of his current partner, the architect Mark Jan Krayenhoff de Leur.

2008-01-18T00:00:00Z,"A new element of instability shook Italy's government as the justice minister, Clemente Mastella, resigning over corruption allegations against him and his wife, withdrew his small party from the already fragile center-left governing coalition. He did not seem intent on immediately bringing down the government of Prime Minister Romano Prodi, who now holds just a one-seat majority in the Senate. Mr. Mastella, left, said he would use his crucial three Senate seats largely to support Mr. Prodi, even if outside the coalition. But amid much tension in a government nearly two years old, political experts said Mr. Mastella's withdrawal weakened a loyalty to Mr. Prodi that was never absolute anyway -- signaling that a full-bore crisis may not be far off. Underscoring the unsteady state of affairs, Mr. Mastella, who leads a small Christian Democratic party that has also supported the center-right, said he would pledge his votes only case by case. ''We will be demanding, not like before when we accepted compromises,'' he said. Mr. Prodi, who said he would temporarily serve as justice minister, had asked Mr. Mastella to reconsider his resignation when he originally tendered it on Wednesday after his wife was put under house arrest. Mr. Mastella said Thursday that he would step down so he could face any charges ''like a common citizen before the law.''"

Here are the intricately colored discs and paper strips of images that needed only devices like a zoetrope or phenakistiscope to become animated spectacles: a horse will jump through a hoop; a sailor will blow a bubble that becomes the moon. Magic-lantern slides are among the oldest of these technologies, and they form the basis of the exhibition's centerpiece, ''Panoramas of the Moving Image,'' a video installation by the experimental filmmaker Ernie Gehr. Made up of synchronized loops of animated slides (an example is above), lined up five across, like a panorama, the 15-minute piece is a hypnotic reminder of cinema's nonnarrative origins. The creation of ''Panoramas'' was an appropriately low-tech, one-man job, Mr. Gehr said on a recent morning at MoMA: He turned on a camera and, using only natural daylight, filmed the slides as he manipulated their brass mechanisms. The far left panel of ''Panoramas'' demonstrates how the mechanisms work, while the others cycle through slides with simple movement (a ghostly spirit comes out of a cauldron); dissolving views (a snowy night scene becomes day); eccentric motion (a ship and waves move at a rhythm different from the background's); and chromatropes (colors change kaleidoscopically)."

2008-01-18T00:00:00Z,"BOWERS--Malcolm Baker, Jr., M.D. beloved husband of Natalie (Natasha) deLeuchtenberg Bowers, M.D., died Sunday, January 13, 2008 at his residence, 17 Yowago Avenue, Branford, Connecticut. He was born September 1, 1933, in Dallas, Texas, son of Malcolm Baker Bowers, Sr. and Virginia Lovejoy Bowers. He grew up in Dallas, attending Highland Park High School where he was valedictorian. He graduated Summa Cum Laude in philosophy from Southern Methodist University in 1954 where he was a member of the varsity football team and Phi Beta Kappa. He received his M.D. degree from Washington University in St. Louis in 1958 and completed his internship at Fitzsimons General Hospital in Denver. He served in the Army, 1959-1962, at Edgewood Arsenal in Maryland where he was acting chief of the Clinical Investigative Branch of the Directorate of Medical Research. He completed his residency in psychiatry and postdoctoral fellowships in basic science and psychopharmacology at the Yale School of Medicine, joining the faculty as Assistant Professor of Psychiatry in 1965. He conducted groundbreaking studies on hallucinogenic exposure and the emergence of psychotic disorders and studied the effect of monoamine biology in psychosis and affective disorders. He was the founding Clinical Chief of the Research Unit at the Connecticut Mental Health Center, chief of psychiatry at Yale-New Haven Hospital (1973-1986), and director of the department's residency training program (1986-1990). He was promoted to Professor of Psychiatry in 1976. A creative and resourceful investigator, he became a master clinician and was recognized as one of the great experts in psychopharmacology within the department. He served on numerous editorial boards and was the recipient of many professional honors including the Stephen Fleck, M.D. Award (Yale University), and the Yale Psychiatric Alumni Association Distinguished Alumni Award. He was the author of several books on the impact of mental illness on the lives of patients. As a senior member of the department, he served as an exemplary role model for younger clinicians by demonstrating that it was possible to provide outstanding, individualized continuity of care, in spite of the administrative con straints imposed by evolving systems of care. He was an outstanding teacher, inspiring residents to establish a clinical teaching colloquium in his honor. He retired from the department in 2002 as an Emeritus Professor of Psychiatry. Until his medical leave of absence in the fall of 2007, he was a senior research scientist and continued to work tirelessly on behalf of his patients, trainees and mental health colleagues. During his 45-year career at Yale, he touched many lives and contributed greatly to the advancement of science, clinical practice and psychiatric training. He is survived by his wife Natasha, children Stephen Malcolm, Andrea Lee, Robert Sloan, Alexandra (Sasha) Anna, Nadia Lovejoy, grandchildren Rosalee Fae, Ian Malcolm, Rebecca Frances and Tea Lovejoy, brother William Bowers, M.D. and sisters Arden Showalter and Carol Menkiti.

2008-01-18T00:00:00Z,"RIKLIS--Judith Stern, a proud daughter of Israel, died January 15 in New York City where she lived. She was born 83 years ago to one of Tel Aviv's early families. Her grandfather was Aharon-Zelig Krinkin, an emigrant from Czarist Russia, who established one of Tel Avivs first pharmacies. (The phone number was ''23''.) Judith was raised in Tel Aviv and graduated from the Gymnasia Herzliya, the first school in what was then Palestine to teach exclusively in Hebrew. It was there that she met her future husband, Meshulam Riklis, the Israeli-American financier and philanthropist. With him and their first-born, the couple went to America to attend college. They settled for a time in Minneapolis where both Judith and Meshulam taught Hebrew school and Meshulam worked also as a stock broker. The couple eventually moved to the New York area where Judith raised her three children, Mona Ackerman, Marcia Riklis and Ira D. Riklis. After the Riklis marriage ended in divorce, Judith maintained homes in both New York and Jerusalem with Isaac Moyal, her companion until his death. Judith took a passionate interest in the Jewish state, contributing to many charities, including the Hadassah Hospital, the Bat Sheva dance troupe and the Soldiers Welfare Association. A building on the Mount Scopus campus of the Hebrew University is named for her. Judith was a warm woman, devoted to her family. She loved and supported the arts and had a keen eye for painting. In addition to her children and her daughter-inlaw, Diana Riklis, Judith is survived by six grandchildren, Ari Ackerman, Gila (and Roy) Steinbock, Jordana (and Ben) Cooperberg, Talia (and Andrew) Day, Daniella Hirschfeld and David Hirschfeld; four great - grandchildren, Layla, Ayelet, Leo and Leora. The funeral will be at Riverside Memorial Chapel, 333 Amsterdam Avenue, at 11:45am, Thursday January 17. The family will sit Shiva at the Riklis home, 936 Fifth Avenue.

2008-01-18T00:00:00Z,"MAVIS STAPLES The civil rights movement never ended for Mavis Staples, who has been politicizing gospel music since her days as the teenage lead singer of the Staple Singers. That group's best-remembered songs, including ''I'll Take You There,'' a No. 1 hit in 1972, preached hope and tolerance amid racism and injustice. The Staple Singers traveled and performed with the Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King Jr., and when Dr. King was assassinated in 1968, they released the song ''Long Walk to D.C.'' as a memorial. Now a husky-voiced 68, Ms. Staples, above, is as powerful a singer as ever, and she has never taken her eyes off the prize. Her latest album, ''We'll Never Turn Back'' (Anti-), is a gorgeous and determined collection of ''freedom songs'' -- classic protest and inspirational material -- like ''This Little Light of Mine'' and ''I'll Be Rested,'' reworked with gritty funk. Hope remains the central message, but her anger is palpable in ''99 and 1/2,'' which she updates with references to Hurricane Katrina: ''It's the 21st century/It feels like it's 1960/Broken levees, lying politicians.''"

The inmate, Timothy Krajcir, was sentenced to 40 years in prison in the death of the woman, Virginia Lee Witte, whom he admitted singling out after seeing her driving. Mr. Krajcir, 63, said in a videotaped confession that he had followed Ms. Witte home and sexually assaulted her. He said he choked her but was not sure she was dead, so he stabbed her as well. The authorities say Mr. Krajcir’s confessions to killing Ms. Witte and eight other women were given in exchange for assurances that he would not face the death penalty. Mr. Krajcir will next be prosecuted in Cape Girardeau County, Mo., where he was charged last month in the killings of five women."

2008-01-19T00:00:00Z,"José Valentín, a vital member of the Mets’ 2006 division champion team who missed the majority of last season because of leg injuries, agreed to a minor league deal. Valentín, 38, sustained a season-ending broken leg July 20 in Los Angeles, less than two weeks after he returned from a two-and-a-half-month absence because of a partial tear of the anterior cruciate ligament in his right knee.The Mets and Aaron Heilman avoided salary arbitration by agreeing on a one-year deal worth $1.2 million. The team exchanged contract figures with the five remaining arbitration-eligible players — Endy Chávez, Ryan Church, Pedro Feliciano, Oliver Pérez and Jorge Sosa — and are still negotiating. Sosa and Pérez have requested a 2008 salary that is more than $1 million higher than what the Mets offered. Sosa asked for $2.75 million, and the Mets submitted $1.7 million; Perez asked for $6.5 million, and the Mets offered $4.725 million."
2008-01-19T00:00:00Z,"The Yankees exchanged salary arbitration figures with three players on Friday and signed another, infielder Wilson Betemit, to a one-year, $1.165 million deal.The biggest difference in figures was with second baseman Robinson Canó, who asked for $4.55 million while the Yankees offered $3.2 million. Starter Chien-Ming Wang asked for $4.6 million, $600,000 more than the Yankees’ offer; and reliever Brian Bruney asked for $845,000 while the Yankees offered $640,000. The Yankees are likely to settle with Bruney before a hearing. They believe their offer to Wang is fair, but a settlement seems possible because the figures are not far apart. Canó’s case is trickier, since the salary he is seeking would be higher than the $4.5 million earned by Justin Morneau of the Twins last season, after Morneau had won the Most Valuable Player award. The Yankees are unlikely to sign any of the players to long-term contracts, because their general policy is to make one-year deals until players reach free agency."

2008-01-19T00:00:00Z,"TIGHTER CREDIT IN EUROPE The European Central Bank said that lenders had sharply tightened credit standards in response to turmoil in financial markets, meaning that less money was likely to be available to companies for investment and to consumers for purchases. The finding, from the bank's latest quarterly survey of lending conditions was the clearest sign yet that convulsing credit markets would take a bite out of growth in the euro zone, possibly leading the central bank to cut interest rates later in the year. The survey showed that 41 percent of the banks in the 15-country euro zone were imposing tougher conditions on corporate borrowers. ''The sharp tightening reflects the deterioration of financial market conditions since the start of the financial turmoil last summer and a worsening of banks' situation,'' the central bank wrote in the survey. Losses linked to subprime mortgages and volatility in financial markets have forced many banks in the United States to seek recapitalization from foreign investors. European banks, though faced with write-downs, have not been hit as hard as their American rivals. CARTER DOUGHERTY"

2008-01-19T00:00:00Z,"8 P.M. (Logo) BROTHER OUTSIDER: THE LIFE OF BAYARD RUSTIN (2003) Long before the Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. rose to national prominence, Bayard Rustin was putting his life on the line in pursuit of racial equality. His advocacy of pacifism and Gandhian nonviolence made him a pioneer in the 1940s and, a decade later, an inspiration to Dr. King (above left, with Mr. Rustin). But because he was gay, he was also a political liability and eventually shunned within the civil rights movement. In The New York Times Elvis Mitchell wrote that this film by Nancy D. Kates ''moves through the complications of Rustin's life -- a black man who stayed out of the spotlight because he knew his homosexuality would cost the movement mainstream credibility -- like a lunar cycle, tracking all of the turbulence around him and the power of his own gravitational pull.'' 8 P.M.

The attorneys, staff and alumni of Snow Becker Krauss P.C. are deeply grieved by the sudden and untimely loss of our beloved friend, co-worker and office manager, Helen O'Connell. Few people are truly indispensable; Helen was one of those people. Few people leave positive indelible imprints on those they touch; Helen had that gift. Helen served the firm devotedly from its inception in 1977. She exuded an array of unique talents. Her humanity and sunny optimism formed the glue which bound the firm together through the passage of decades. Possessed of a generosity of spirit, a pervasive warmth and innate decency and integrity, she treated all with respect, and was in turn respected by all those whom she met. Quick to laugh, yet slow to anger, these were among the attributes of her mature and complex mind. Her face was open and honest, but her spine was forged steel. In her personal life, Helen took great joy from her special relationship with her beloved family, and her close bond with her pets. Deeply religious, she never wore her faith on her sleeve. We can never replace her, for we shall not see her like again. Rather, we seek to honor her memory by striving to conduct ourselves in the gracious and dignified manner in which she lived life. On behalf of our colleagues, we extend heartfelt condolences to her husband Ed, their daughter Cathy, son-in-law Doug, granddaughters Courtney, Claire and Leah, her brother John McInerney and the entire O'Connell family."

2008-01-20T18:27:09Z,"We're in that season now when we hear the same things being said over and over again, and nothing is said more often by political pundits than this election (it doesn't matter which one) will be decided by independent voters. Accompanying this announcement is the judgment - sometimes implicit, sometimes explicit - that this state of affairs is to be welcomed, even encouraged: it's good that the independent voters are making themselves heard and forcing candidates to think outside their partisan boxes. And this judgment itself implies another: independent voters are better, in the sense of being more reflective and less ideological, than voters who identify themselves strongly with one or the other of the two major parties. The assumption is that if we were all independent voters, the political process would be in much better shape."

2008-01-20T05:40:37Z,"In a village full of fish-out-of-water fables, the 50 Cent gig at Tao in Park City last night stood out. During Sundance, the toughest ticket draws the most massive crowds, and the hopefuls spilled out onto Main St., blocking traffic while trying to BlackBerry their way past the door. Those who did make it inside underwent further taxonomy: A hierarchy of wrist bands told them where they could and could not go. For the wired but unwashed who made it in to the main mosh, 50's imperative that they put their hands in the air was met with compliance, in part because there was no where else to put them. Servers had to be flanked front and back by burly security guys with winking flashlights to make their way. Smoke from tobacco and other products filled the place while toes were crushed and egos were in conflict. ""I would not have given that wrist band to you if I had known you were going to be such a jerk about it,"" shouted one guy to another. Six cameras panned live shots, feeding back to the crowd what they already knew. They were there, they saw the thing, they had juice. ""What's up, Park City?"" 50 Cent shouted. Only you man, only you. (As it turns out, Fiddy might have some skin in the movie game after all.)"
2008-01-20T05:38:36Z,"50 Cent was not the only must-have ducat. There was a massive crush outside the Eccles Theater at Park High for ""U2 3D,"" a movie using the latest in 3D film technology to capture a concert in Buenos Aires. The guy next to the Bagger said that he had heard of offers of $1,000 for a $15 ticket. To a movie. The keening and posturing that went on as people tried to make their way inside brought to mind plenty of painful high school lessons about who the cool kids were. Robert Redford was there. Al Gore was there. U2? All four members were there. They entered to a huge, rock concert roar. There was a mad scramble for seats: ""Does any one have a single anywhere?"" The internationally recognized symbol of a saved seat at Sundance - a bulky parka left to warm the seat - lost salience as people fought to plop down somewhere and put on their specially issued 3D glasses."
2008-01-20T05:36:42Z,"The Bagger has been guided, manhandled, ushered and led the whole time he has been at Sundance. There is either something in the water spilling out of the Wasatch mountains or in the training of volunteers that leads them to feel the need to lay hands on whomever they are in proximity to. It is sort of creepy and endearing at the same time, but leaves the Bagger longing to get back to NYC, where grabbing a stranger is a social felony. But they are a relentlessly cheery lot, and according to Gregg Goldstein, their special tribal membership does have it privileges. Apparently, a few film executives tried to muscle their way into a volunteer-only screening of ""Adventures of Power,"" a comedy starring Ari Gold and Adrian Grenier on Friday night. Goldstein said they were left cooling their heels in Friday night's 1-degree temperature. No doubt, the natural order of things will be restored soon enough and the machers will get what they want when they want it."

HAVA offered no assistance to inadequately financed election administrators as to what kind of machine to buy. The way out of this impasse may well be the development of professional programs in elections administration at university graduate schools of public policy -- M.A. programs that would teach best-practice methods of the sort used by Sancho and Platten, as well as the history of voting technology and election administration, principles of good ballot design and the operation of open-source systems for code development."

Recognizing the importance of education for all children, he was a pioneer in starting and furthering the Inner-City Scholarship Fund in NYC, providing scholarships, classrooms, and computers for children and serving as patron when needed for rebuilding schools. In 1994 he received the Irish Man of the Year Award for his extraordinary generosity and unselfish commitment of personal and financial resources to St. Thomas Aquinas and other inner-city schools. Georgetown University was extremely close to Kevin's heart.

2008-01-21T18:55:48Z,"Remember September 2006? It was a little over a month before Election Day when Bill Clinton gave an interview to Fox News Channel's Chris Wallace. The peg for the interview was a summit held by the Clinton Global Initiative, one of the former president's many philanthropic activities. Wallace asked several questions about the initiative, but four minutes into the interview also brought up criticisms of the Clinton administration's counterterrorism policies that had been aired in Pulitzer-prize winning journalist Lawrence Wright's history of Al Qaeda, ""The Looming Tower."" Whereupon Clinton went ballistic. His face turned red. His voice rose. He tore into Wallace, accusing the veteran journalist, who over the decades has worked for several ""mainstream"" networks and whose credibility seldom has been questioned, of being a right-wing shill. He claimed the ""neocons"" who now say he did too little to capture or kill Osama bin Laden had in fact during the 1990s been highly critical of his administration's emphasis on counterterrorism, that they ""thought I was too obsessed with bin Laden"" and ""had no meetings on bin Laden for nine months after I left office."""

Mr. Giamatti formed a production company with his wife, Elizabeth and his pal Dan Carey to get the film made."
2008-01-21T09:47:10Z,"The big problem with attempts to provide temporary economic stimulus is how to ensure that the money gets spent. As Milton Friedman pointed out 50 years ago, consumers tend to base their spending on ""permanent income"" -- the income they expect to have over the long run -- rather than their income in any given year.

It was an unprecedented decision, which was appealed and later reversed, although Cheparinov was required to apologize and shake Short's hand before playing the game on Monday, which Short won."

The majority are the work of amateur artists. Though Dr. King is usually front and center, he is often accompanied by other inspirational figures: Nelson Mandela, John Paul II, Malcolm X, Rosa Parks, Mother Teresa, Pancho Villa. He is also often accompanied by his famous phrase, ''I have a dream'' -- a reminder that in many of the communities where these murals exist, the gulf between hope and reality remains far too wide.

And that pattern will continue if Senator Hillary Rodham Clinton of New York captures the Democratic nomination and goes on to win the presidency. How do voters feel about that? According to a recent New York Times/CBS News poll, most are indifferent, saying each election is about individuals and not families. But the national survey found that about a third of all voters -- and similarly, a third of all Republican primary voters -- consider the pattern bad for the country, because it concentrates too much power among a small group of people. Democratic primary voters were divided on whether it is bad or makes no difference. But Democrats who support Mrs. Clinton's nomination are more likely to say it makes no difference. The telephone poll was conducted Jan. 9-12 with 1,061 registered voters."

Vaughan, above, and Pia Guerra. The event, “Y: The Last Party,” will be held on Friday, Feb. 8, and will benefit the Comic Book Legal Defense Fund. The organization, founded in 1986, is dedicated to the preservation of First Amendment rights for members of the comic book business. Of late the defense fund has been involved in the case of Gordon Lee, a comic book retailer in Rome, Ga., who has found himself in court over the distribution of obscene material to a minor. The material in question depicted Picasso in the nude. Mr. Vaughan, who is also a writer on ABC’s “Lost,” is a firm believer in the defense fund. “It’s obviously a completely different situation from the writers’ strike, but, similarly, it’s creators taking care of their community, which I always support,” he said in a telephone interview. The $100 V.I.P. tickets have sold out, but a limited number of $25 tickets will be available the day of the event. More information:www.myspace.com/cbldf."

Tickets for the festival, from April 25 to 27, will cost $269 as well as fees for all three days; a single day’s ticket will cost $90, according to the details released by Coachella’s organizers, Goldenvoice and AEG. The organizers also said they were planning another three-day event, All Points West, at Liberty State Park in Jersey City, from Aug. 8 to 10. That lineup, not yet announced, is expected to include Radiohead and Mr. Johnson. Paul Tollett, promoter of Goldenvoice, said that unlike Coachella, which takes place on a polo field in the desert about two hours east of Los Angeles, the All Points West will “have its own personality,” incorporating the area’s urban setting and local art scene. Several of this year’s Coachella headliners will be touring in connection with new releases. Portishead, for example, is expected to release its first album in about a decade internationally in April. “They’ve been one of the most requested bands to play Coachella” among fans, Mr. Tollett said. “Talent is still king.”."
2008-01-22T00:00:00Z,"Hot and bothered by a steamy new soap opera about airborne love and lust, Thai Airways flight attendants urged Thailand’s culture ministry on Monday to nip the show in the bud, The Associated Press reported. After broadcasts of three episodes of the series, “The Air Hostess War,” the Thai Airways International union protested the story about an affair between a married pilot and a tall, slim flight attendant, featuring sex at stopover cities and love triangles that lead to fighting in the aisles. Viewers were captivated, but Noppadol Thaungthong, a Thai Airways flight attendant leading the union’s action, said: “This soap opera is insulting and damaging to the reputation of flight attendants. It’s all about sex and air hostesses beating each other up in the cabin because of love and jealousy. This kind of thing never happens. We are demanding that the station and the producers immediately stop airing this ugly soap opera.” A culture ministry spokesman withheld comment until officials saw the letter of complaint, and the broadcaster, Channel 5, said it had no plans to pull the soap opera but would consider asking the producer to edit scenes found to be offensive."
2008-01-22T00:00:00Z,"Oliver Stone isn’t a fan of the decision to invade Iraq, but in his next film he wants to render “a fair, true portrait” of President Bush, Variety reported. “How did Bush go from an alcoholic bum to the most powerful figure in the world?” Mr. Stone asked. “It’s like Frank Capra territory on one hand, but I’ll also cover the demons in his private life, his bouts with his dad and his conversion to Christianity, which explains a lot of where he is coming from. It includes his belief that God personally chose him to be president of the United States, and his coming into his own, with the stunning, pre-emptive attack on Iraq. It will contain surprises for Bush supporters and his detractors.” If financing materializes, “Bush,” starring Josh Brolin, above, as the president in a screenplay written by Stanley Weiser, who wrote “Wall Street” with Mr. Stone, will go before the cameras in April and could be in theaters by Election Day or by the inauguration of the next president. “I’m a dramatist who is interested in people,” Mr. Stone said, “and I have empathy for Bush as a human being, much as I did for Castro, Nixon, Jim Morrison, Jim Garrison and Alexander the Great.”."

Amid disappointing attendance at Hong Kong Disneyland, which opened in 2005, Ms. Tam was brought in to help attract more tourists from the mainland, which has become the park’s biggest market. Bill Ernest, the park’s managing director, said, “Our mission is to be very connected with the local culture — with mainland China, Hong Kong.”."

The National Yiddish Book Center mourns the passing our friend and benefactor Terrence Elkes. Z''L: May his memory be for a blessing. ELKES--Terrence (Terry). ''Now cracks a noble heart. Goodnight, sweet prince, and flights of angels sing thee to thy rest!'' Eugene and Emily Grant ELKES--Terrence. President Gregory H. Williams and the faculty, staff and students of The City College of New York wish to express their deep sadness at the sudden passing of Terrence Elkes, one of CCNY's most eminent and dedicated alumni. He received his bachelor's degree in Economics and Political Science from The City College of New York in 1955 and earned his Doctor of Laws degree from the University of Michigan in 1958. He went on to a distinguished career in law and business, but always kept a warm place in his heart for his alma mater. A leading member of the City College 21st Century Foundation Board, Terry also served on its Investment Committee. In addition, the commitment Terry and his dearly loved wife Ruth made to the College earned them honored places in its President's Circle. Through his visionary support of science, he has helped to advance the scientific leadership of the College. This past fall, he was elected to membership in the Townsend Harris Society, receiving the highest award the CCNY Alumni Association can bestow. Terry's own eloquent words tell it best: ''For me, what City College really represented was the only opportunity where someone with my background could obtain a first class education. It was a system that was based strictly on merit and tuition-free, and it was the gateway towards a career which I would not have been able to achieve. Today's students deserve nothing less than that opportunity as well''. Our heartfelt condolences to Steven, David, and Daniel, their wives and children on the loss of Terry, so soon after losing their beloved mother Ruth. They were a very important part of the CCNY family. We will miss them both very much. ELKES --Terrence. The University of Michigan, and President Mary Sue Coleman, express their deepest sympathy to the family of Terry Elkes. As a graduate of Michigan Law, he continued to provide generous time and support to both the Law School and the University, serving on the Law School's Campaign Steering Committee, and the University's President's Advisory Group, and the Investment Advisory Group. We will miss him greatly. President Mary Sue Coleman The University of Michigan"

2008-01-22T00:00:00Z,"BAKER--Charles Arthur, 73, Died Thursday, January 10, 2008, of complications from Alzheimer's Disease, in Columbia County, NY. Born in Warren, Arkansas, on July 27, 1934, Baker was the son of Arthur Lee Baker and Gladys Thompson Baker. Baker came to New York City in 1957, where he designed window displays at Bloomingdale's and Delman Shoes. One of his windows for Delman's was done in the style of Renee Magritte. Magritte's wife saw the display and congratulated Baker on his superb execution. In the early 1960s, Baker opened a store in the East Village called Paper Moon, selling only objects made from paper. Among them were paper chairs Baker constructed from large paper cylinders, which were the subject of an article in The New York Times. The business soon moved uptown to Madison Avenue, where it became a well-known gift shop, frequently visited by Salvador Dali and Jacqueline Kennedy Onassis. In the early 1970s, Baker left Paper Moon to devote himself to gardening and, in 1975, purchased, with Dr. Norman Ames Posner, Hudson Bush Farm in Greenport, NY. The house, which was built by Henry I. Van Rensselaer in 1785, is listed in the National Register of Historic Places and is frequently included on historic house tours in the Hudson Valley. At Hudson Bush Farm, Baker created a nationally recognized garden, which is part of the Garden Conservancy Open Day Program and has been the setting for numerous charitable events. Baker is survived by his partner, Dr. Norman Ames Posner; his Jack Russell terrier, Soames; his sister, Carolyn Baker Allen of Mt. Pleasant, SC; his brother, Thomas Oliver Baker of Tuscaloosa, AL; two nieces, a nephew, and several grandnieces and grandnephews. Memorial contributions may be made to the Alzheimer's Research Institute at Albany Medical Center. A memorial service is planned for the spring, to take place in his garden."

I turned away, toward the mob of photographers and models, all of them in identical red dresses, gathering with intensity around Valentino. Natalia V. had tears welling in her eyes. I saw Carlos Souza, who has done the press for Valentino for years, and I asked him if the girls were going to keep their red dresses. They'd all came out in red for the finale.

2008-01-23T12:24:02Z,"Even by election-year standards, the current field of Republican candidates has been doing some truly ambitious pandering. First, Mitt Romney told the autoworkers in Michigan that he could get all their jobs back-no problem, consider it done. Then, Mike Huckabee told South Carolinians that it was nobody's business but theirs if they wanted to wallpaper their public buildings with the Confederate flag. And now here comes Rudolph W. Giuliani to show these amateurs how it's done. Campaigning in his make-or-break state of Florida last week, Mr. Giuliani released a statement promising to ""make space a priority."" Apparently, America is facing a crisis far greater than health care or education reform: when the current fleet of space shuttles is retired in 2010, it's going to take as much as five years-five years, people!-before we can send another guy into orbit. ""This is not acceptable,"" Mr. Giuliani said. ""America should be number one in space. We have been. We shouldn't lose that position."" In other words, it would be as if a guy had the number one position in all the national polls and then suddenly well, you get the idea."

He was deeply committed to the education of students regardless of their income or background. CUNY Chancellor from 1963 to 1971, he built CUNY from four senior colleges and a few small community colleges to 18 campuses offering associate and baccalaureate degrees, a graduate school of social work and a graduate school and university center for doctoral studies. He put in place numerous academic programs and facilities that have benefited millions of New Yorkers. Before joining CUNY, he was Dean of Stanford University's graduate school. He served as the Chancellor of the University of California, Berkeley from 1971 to 1980 and was appointed Assistant Secretary of Postsecondary Education by President Jimmy Carter. A graduate of MIT, he was a distinguished mathematician, educator and beloved mentor to educational administrators, faculty and students throughout the nation. His legacy will long endure. We offer our deepest condolences to his children, Paul, Nancy and Caroline Bowker. Benno C. Schmidt, Jr., Chairman Board of Trustees Matthew Goldstein, Chancellor BOWKER--Albert H. The Board of Directors, officers and staff of the Research Foundation/CUNY mourn the loss of our former board member and vice president, Albert H. Bowker. As Chancellor of The City University of New York he demonstrated extraordinary vision and courage in promoting access and excellence in public higher education. He continued to exhibit that vision and courage during his years as Chancellor of UC Berkeley, as Assistant Secretary at the U.S. Department of Education, and as Executive Vice President at the University of Maryland. The Research Foundation was fortunate, indeed, to have had the benefit of his wisdom, intellect, compassion, and advice from 1986 to 1993 as Vice President for Planning and subsequently as a member of the board until 2002. He will be missed by those who knew and admired him and by the many more generations of students past, present, and future whose lives are better thanks to him. Our heartfelt condolences to his family and friends and to the entire higher education community. Matthew Goldstein, Chairman of the Board Richard F. Rothbard, President"

Speaking at the World Economic Forum, Prime Minister Ferenc Gyurcsany of Hungary, above, set the scene for a vigorous debate by linking rising long-term commodity prices and the need to scale back agricultural spending. The argument, later backed by Tony Blair, the former prime minister of Britain, opened a new front in the battle over the 56 billion euros ($82 billion) that is spent each year by the union to support its farmers. It comes before a review of the union's spending priorities that could pave the way for a shift away from agriculture."

2008-01-24T00:00:00Z,"LERMAN--Miles. The American Gathering of Jewish Holocaust Survivors and Their Descendants mourns the passing of our dear friend, Miles Lerman, Holocaust survivor and partisan, who spearheaded the creation of the United States Holocaust Memorial Museum. Through his efforts on behalf of the survivor community, he made the world a better place. LERMAN--Miles. To describe Miles Lerman as extraordinary is an understatement. No words can adequately capture this daring and caring human being who acted tirelessly on behalf of so many. Miles had the rich instincts to envision the United States Holocaust Museum in Washington DC, which will forever pay tribute to those who lived their lives with courage. All of us at The Jewish Theological Seminary mourn this loss deeply and extend our arms around Chris, Jeanette, Joe, and the entire Lerman family Arnold Eisen, Chancellor Gershon Kekst, Board Chairman LERMAN--Miles. The Jewish Museum notes with deep sorrow the passing of Miles Lerman, father of the Museum's vice chairman Jeanette Lerman Neubauer. Mr. Lerman transformed his experiences as a Holocaust survivor and a partisan fighter into an inspired lifelong mission. The US Holocaust Memorial Museum and Poland's Belzec Museum and study center are two enduring testaments to his efforts on behalf of Holocaust education and against human rights abuse worldwide. We send our sincere sympathy to his wife Rosalie, Jeanette and Joseph Neubauer, David Lerman and Shelley Wallock, his brother Jona, and his loving circle of grandchildren and great-grandchildren. Joshua Nash, Chairman Robert A. Pruzan, President Joan Rosenbaum, Director LERMAN--Miles. The United States Holocaust Memorial Museum mourns the death of its Chairman Emeritus Miles Lerman. A Holocaust survivor, partisan fighter in the forests of Poland, and international leader in the cause of remembrance, Miles was a founding father of the Museum and instrumental in its creation. He led the nationwide fundraising campaign to build the institution and negotiated historic international agreements that helped create the Museum's Permanent Exhibition and build its world renowned archives. Miles and his wife Chris, also a survivor, were actively involved in every aspect of the Museum and have been exceptionally generous supporters. Miles was a member of the Museum's governing Council for 23 years, having received appointments from Presidents Carter, Reagan, Bush, and Clinton, and served as the first chairman after the Museum opened in 1993. Through his initiative, the Museum established the Miles Lerman Center for the Study of Jewish Resistance to dispel the myth that Jews did not resist the Nazis and their collaborators. Under his leadership, the Museum began to serve as a voice of conscience by establishing the Committee on Conscience to speak out about contemporary genocide. Miles' relentless efforts and determination to have the world remember those who perished led to the creation of the memorial at Belzec, Poland, where at least half a million Jews were murdered, including members of his family. His singular dedication, sheer determination, and extraordinary vision helped create an institution that will profoundly impact future generations. As a global force for confronting hatred, antisemitism, and genocide, the Museum stands as one of Miles Lerman's most enduring legacies. We extend our heartfelt condolences to Chris, a cherished friend of the Museum, their children Jeanette and her husband Joe, David and his wife Shelley, grandchildren, and Miles' brother Jona and sister-in law Anny. Fred S. Zeidman, Chairman, Joel M. Geiderman, Vice-Chairman, Sara J. Bloomfield, Director LERMAN--Miles, The American Jewish Committee is profoundly saddened by the loss of Miles Lerman, a towering figure in the Jewish community, recognized for his world wide efforts to memorialize the Holocaust. As a founder of the United States Holocaust Memorial Museum, Miles drew from his experiences as a partisan fighter and survivor to create a partnership between AJC and the Polish government to build a memorial at the Belzec death camp, where his family was murdered by the Nazis. This memorial, an indelible example of Miles' esteemed legacy, is home to a museum that will forever recall this tragic era in Jewish history. In addition, Miles was dedicated to securing Jewish artifacts and property from governments in Europe long after the Second World War. Despite many tradegies in his life, Miles sought to bring a spirit of optimism and hope to the future. We are comforted by the lessons about memory, perseverance, and tenacity that Miles taught us through his countless deeds. We honored him for those efforts in 2005 with AJC's Kol Yisrael Areveem Zeh La'zeh Award. He will be deeply missed by those at AJC who will forever cherish his life's work, and legacy, as a blessing to the Jewish people, and the world. We extend our heartfelt condolences to Miles' beloved wife of over six decades, Chris Lerman; his daughter, Jeanette and her husband, Joseph Neubauer; his son, David and his wife, Shelley Wallock; his five grandchildren: Brooke, Ted, and Julia Lerman; Melissa Neubauer Anderson and her husband, Paul; Lawrence Neubauer, a member of AJC's Board of Governors, and his wife, Jillian; and six great-grandchildren: Hannah, Jonah, Leah, Ella, Riley and Scarlett; as well as his brother, Jona Lerman. Richard J. Sideman, President David A. Harris, Executive Director LERMAN--Miles. The AntiDefamation League mourns the passing of our dear friend and supporter Miles Lerman. A Holocaust survivor whose commitment to memory and ''Never Again'' was unwavering, he led the effort to establish the U.S. Holocaust Memorial Museum. He believed teaching the lessons of the Holocaust was the way to confront anti-Semitism and hatred today. We extend our sincerest condolences to his wife Chris and the entire family. Glen S. Lewy, National Chair Abraham H. Foxman, National Director LERMAN--Miles. The Officers and Staff of State of Israel Bonds mourn with profound sorrow the passing of its former National Vice Chairman and a great leader of Holocaust remembrance and education. Miles, who escaped a slave labor camp in Poland to fight as a partisan during World War II, helped found the U.S. Holocaust Museum in Washington and served as its Chairman. He was also a principal founder of Israel Bonds' Elie Wiesel Holocaust Remembrance Dinner. We extend our sincere condolences to his wife Rosalie Chris, daughter Jeanette Neubauer, son David and other members of the Lerman family. May they be comforted among the mourners of Zion and Jerusalem. Joshua Matza, President and CEO Michael Siegal, Chairman of the Board Burton P.

2008-01-24T00:00:00Z,"''Thread count is so last century,'' said Paul Hooker, the president of the luxury sheet company Sferra. ''It really means nothing.'' Those are confounding words from the guy who says he broke the 1,000-thread-count barrier seven years ago. Since then, even no-name brands have learned to cheat the system and create 900-thread-count products using inferior cotton and multiple-ply yarn. To gain an edge, Mr. Hooker is using an Egyptian cotton known as Giza 45, typically sold to high-end shirt manufacturers like Thomas Pink, he said. When asked if he had heard of Giza cotton, David Forster, the owner of Léron, a ''couture'' sheet store in Manhattan, said he hadn't. ''I guess it's a way for him to distinguish his Egyptian cotton from mine,'' he said, ''the way I would distinguish Rockland County from Westchester County.'' To evaluate the Giza sheet -- or any other in these post-thread-count days -- Mr. Forster suggests rubbing the corners against your cheek. The material felt silky and fine, much like an expensive shirt. But the Marie Antoinette doll Sferra sent as a promotion had a mixed message: press a button, and its head pops off. Sferra Giza 45 sheets will be in stores this March. Information: sferrralinens.com. PENELOPE GREEN"

Lueck finds. The netting proved a lifesaver last week, when a construction worker fell from the 42nd floor of the Trump SoHo, a condominium hotel being built at Varick and Spring Streets, and was snared by a net that protruded 10 feet from the side of the building about two floors below where he was working. He was then lowered to the ground safely. But for another worker, who also fell from the 42nd floor, a similar net proved useless. For reasons that remain under investigation, he fell to the ground and died. For developers, contractors and construction workers, the accident in SoHo on Jan. 15 has raised questions about whether the city’s requirement for safety netting, which has generally been applauded, goes far enough."

2008-01-25T13:05:43Z,"Way back in 1997, Rosewood Hotels & Resorts made a big splash in Mexico with Las Ventanas al Paraíso in Los Cabos, a stunning beachfront resort that in the decade since has become an icon in the world of luxury hotels. In December, following a long gestation and much anticipation, the company finally ""soft opened"" its second property in the country, Rosewood Mayakobá on the Riviera Maya; the resort's official, full-scale launch is next week. Rosewood is the second company to open in the big mixed-use residential-hotel-golf community north of Playa del Carmen called Mayakobá. (Fairmont was the first, and a Viceroy and Banyan Tree are slated to open later this year.) Though we haven't yet booked ourselves in, early reports suggest the new Rosewood is a winner. Of the 128 suites - all done in a stylish, pared-down style using local limestone and woods from renewable sources - the 16 on the beach are obviously prime real estate, though the remainder, arranged along a network of lagoons that wend their way through mangrove forest, provide a novel take on the typical Mexican resort experience: each has its own dock, and guests are transported around the property via silent boats (silent, to avoid disturbing the wildlife). All rooms have a private plunge pool, and there's a staff of 40 butlers to take care of your needs. The nice thing about the Riviera Maya in general, of course, is that there's more to do than just loll on the beach - you've got Mayan ruins at Tulum; some decent shopping, restaurants and bars in Playa del Carmen and coral reef for diving and snorkeling offshore - but looking at the images from Rosewood, we think it might be hard to tear yourself away."

2008-01-25T00:00:00Z,"'GLIMPSES OF THE MOON' Some say the Algonquin Hotel is haunted by the spirits of Jazz Age literati like Alexander Woollcott, Dorothy Parker and other members of the celebrated Round Table who met daily in the 1920s to trade bons mots. Perhaps. Certainly many distinguished guests have dined at, or performed in, the hotel's Oak Room, a busy cabaret supper club today. But Monday night's show, an adaptation of Edith Wharton's comic novel ''The Glimpses of the Moon,'' is a departure. The Oak Room does not generally offer musical comedy. Tajlei Levis, who wrote the book and lyrics, teamed up with the composer John Mercurio to adapt the story of two penniless friends (Stephen Plunkett and Patti Murin, above) on the fringe of high society who decide to marry for convenience -- to live off wedding gifts from their wealthy friends. ''We wrote it expressly for the room,'' Mr. Mercurio said. He and Ms. Levis tried to take advantage of the elegant surroundings in a variety of ways, he added. Ms. Levis even made some adjustments to highlight New York and the Algonquin. ''We have a scene that takes place in the Oak Room of 1922,'' she said. Each week a guest star will portray the hotel's star cabaret singer. Joyce DeWitt and Susan Lucci are on the schedule, along with the Oak Room regular K T Sullivan."

A chance to see what she has been up to is not to be missed; success or failure, it is likely to provoke thought and engage the eye. Ms. Stuart is quite the collaborator. In ''Forgeries, Love and Other Matters,'' her previous performance at Dance Theater Workshop in 2006, she joined the Montreal dancer Benoît Lachambre, as well as Hahn Rowe, a magician of a composer."

In 2003 Jason Newman, Josh Dick and Zach Quillen -- friends and rap fans who live blocks apart in Queens -- decided to expand the concept to hip-hop. ''We'd be going to hip-hop shows, and you'd see an M.C. drop a classic song, and you look around the crowd and everyone knows every word,'' said Mr. Newman, who goes by the name Jay-New when he's not working in finance. A few dozen enthusiasts came to their first show, in December 2004 on the Lower East Side. Since then regular monthly events, most recently at the Knitting Factory, have drawn hundreds. Rhymefest and Big Daddy Kane have dropped by, and the idea has spread to other cities including London and Toronto. The performers are not just faking it. ''You'll have costumes, you'll have props, you'll have choreography,'' Mr. Newman said of those in the diverse crowd. Mr. Dick -- a k a Diggedy -- is the host, and Mr. Quillen, as D.J.

Mr. Barr, a well known trial lawyer, died in Santa Barbara, California on January 24th. His 77th birthday was on January 23. Over the course of his career, Mr. Barr was recognized as one of the country's most skilled courtroom advocates.

In his name the Lawyers Committee established the Thomas D. Barr Mississippi Freedom Fund. Mr. Barr was a graduate of the University of Missouri at Kansas City and Yale Law School, which he attended after serving as an officer in the Marine Corps. He joined the Cravath firm in 1958, became a partner in 1965 and later served for many years as head of the firm's litigation department.

But now Snickettians are anticipating a fortunate event: the New York premiere of ''The Composer Is Dead,'' by Lemony Snicket and Nathaniel Stookey, which the Little Orchestra Society will perform on Saturday in ''Musical Mysteries.'' The narrator will be none other than that deliciously dour master of macabre plots, Lemony Snicket himself. ''I often find more inspiration in disheartening works than in heartening ones,'' Daniel Handler (a k a Lemony Snicket) said, acknowledging a tendency that won't surprise his readers. In this case the disheartening work was Prokofiev's ''Peter and the Wolf,'' which Mr. Handler had narrated in San Francisco, where he lives."

Jane and William Walsh recently created the Fordham Museum of Greek, Etruscan and Roman Art with the donation of 260-plus ancient artifacts to the William D. Walsh Family Library on the Rose Hill campus. In addition to this latest gift of rare antiquities, it was the Walsh Family's gift of $10 million more than a decade ago that helped build the library that bears the family name. Walsh was preceded in death by her father John Gordon; her mother Gertrude Gordon; and her sister Peggy Battenberg.

2008-01-25T00:00:00Z,"NICOLE ATKINS For almost two years now Ms. Atkins, above, has been on the brink of fame, which can sometimes seem a fate worse than failure. First there was a profile in Rolling Stone that tagged her as an ''artist to watch.'' Then came an American Express commercial -- Martin Scorsese treatment all the way -- which would have been perfect timing had her debut album come out on time. Instead fans waited. And waited. When ''Neptune City'' (Columbia) was finally released in late October, it received positive reviews but sold poorly, and all that buzz seemed to pack up and head somewhere else. That's a shame. Ms. Atkins, 29, is one of the most talented singer-songwriters to emerge in New York in years, with songs that have anxious undercurrents despite their romantic, cinematic sweep -- ''pop noir,'' she calls it. She named her album after her hometown on the Jersey Shore, and in the title song, over a slow, murky beat that seems to sway like the sea, she sings of being stuck in a surreal state somewhere between being unable to leave home and being unable to return. ''Maybe if I paid attention, I could learn to love the landscape I was born to,'' she sings."

The resignation is an embarrassment for Mr. Brown, who has tried to position himself as a squeaky-clean corrective to Tony Blair, whose government was blighted by accusations that party officials had promised seats in the House of Lords in exchange for donations."

2008-01-25T00:00:00Z,"LUIS GISPERT: 'EL MUNDO ES TUYO (THE WORLD IS YOURS)' A boy lies on a trampoline, clutching a boombox to his chest. Gradually the blue tarpaulin turns a sickly green as he empties his bladder. ''Smother,'' a riveting new 26-minute film at Mary Boone Gallery by the New York artist Luis Gispert, explores the relationship between this 11-year-old chronic bed-wetter, also depicted in the photograph at right, and his domineering mother. Like ''Stereomongrel,'' Mr. Gispert's 2005 film collaboration with Jeffrey Reed, it follows a precocious preadolescent's odyssey through a perilous adult landscape -- in this case 1980s Miami (where Mr. Gispert was raised). ''Smother,'' which has a script by Mr. Gispert and the artist Orly Genger and a soundtrack by the experimental duo Phoenicia, is the throbbing, flamingo-pink heart of Mr. Gispert's two-gallery show, at Mary Boone and Zach Feuer. With its tropical palette and episodic magical realism (which might be too real for some animal lovers), it can seem less like a film than a tenuously linked series of Mr. Gispert's stills. Dialogue is sparse, and as melodramatic as a telenovela's. The camera lingers over the spectacular stucco-mansion setting, which Mr. Gispert has aptly described as ''narco-nouveau-riche.''"

2008-01-26T00:00:00Z,"In a high-profile case that had become a test of the judiciary's independence, the Supreme Court convicted a former airline pilot for the 2004 arsenic poisoning of Munir Said Thalib, the country's leading human rights lawyer, aboard a commercial flight to the Netherlands and sentenced him to 20 years in prison. The ruling cannot be appealed, and the conviction of the pilot, Pollycarpus Budihari Priyanto, opened the way for a deeper look into official involvement in the killing. Maj. Gen. Sisno Adiwinoto, the country's chief police spokesman, said secret service agents would be investigated for the first time in connection with the murder. Mr. Munir had investigated abuses by the Indonesian military and the police, including kidnappings and killings of political dissidents."

Congrats boys and girls, or animal and vegetable, or whatever you are behind the commenting avatars. Nicely done. The Bagger got four out of six, because he picked stunt too, but take that away and he was three out of five, sort of miserable, actually. He went with the youth brigade -- Any Ryan and Ellen Page -- while it was experience and guile -- Ruby Dee and Julie Christie -- that took home The Actor statue. Nice tidy night, good balance of glam and gravitas. And how 'bout that Josh Brolin? We'll have what he's having, some kind of substance that makes you see the world as your own little plaything.

On screen, he frequently seems as if he might explode, sending human shrapnel in all direction. On stage? About the same.

She said that her win and the movie were ""a reminder of how important unions are.""

2008-01-27T22:08:57Z,"The red carpet at the SAG Awards tonight looked surprisingly scripted, even by red carpet standards. Did the stylists and publicists get together and decide that (nearly) every actress should go strapless? Maybe my tube was small, maybe there were too many people and pets crowding in my kitchen on this Sunday night, but the view was predominantly of bare shoulders and bobbing bouffant heads. Oh, and a little slash of fabric representing the bodice & cleavage of a dress. The camera angles could be lascivious. In the strapless contingent were Cate Blanchett, Kate Beckinsale, Vanessa Williams, Angelina Jolie, Michelle Pfeiffer, Sandra Oh, and Teri Hatcher. Though I couldn't see all of her dress, Ellen Paige looked smart, I thought, in a black Zac Posen dress with a v-neck and short kimono sleeves, especially with her smooth hair. Debra Messing's gold Oscar de la Renta dress at least had some kind of interesting neckline on an evening of what amounted to table-top dressing."

2008-01-27T21:40:33Z,"The SAG Awards, historically a B-List event populated by A-List actors, did a good job of filling in the glamour gap without being unseemly. The speeches have been short and tasteful, the strike and the effect it has had on working people in the industry was present, but did not overwhelm. Broadcast on TBS and TNT, the SAG awards will not provide the kind of marketing firepower that the Globes might have, had they not been downsized by the threat of pickets. The industry is in a middle place, with uncertainty abounding and no clear path to settlement at the negotiating table. So far, the SAG Awards have reflected the mood without seeming downright moody."

2008-01-27T21:03:29Z,"Would it be untoward for the Bagger to admit that he is happy to see famous people back at the microphone saying that ""it's about the work."" No surprise there, but there is something in the ritual of it, the kabuki of a rotating cast saying the same things over and over. One clanky note though: The SAG's self-congratulatory infomercials, about the unions fight for racial tolerance, safety and worker dignity. All nice stuff, but as long as they are doing a historical tick-tock, they might want to mention that when the pall of a black-list hug over America, the union capitulated, throwing may of their colleagues under a bus."
2008-01-27T21:01:34Z,"The SAG Awards has been known to host its share of rhetorical excess in the past, but the discourse from the podium was remarkably chaste, with both James Gandolfini and Edie Falco, best actor and actress in a dramatic series respectively, giving very short speeches long on thank you's.

2008-01-27T20:07:20Z,"In a year when all five Oscar nominees for best picture would seem to have a shot -- and the muted Golden Globes did little to clarify the picture -- the Screen Actors Guild awards would seem to have a huge role to play. But there's just one small unhelpful fact: Only one of this year's nominees for the best picture Oscars is in the running for the SAG ensemble award, which is how the actors settle on a best picture. ""3:10 to Yuma,"" ""Hairspray,"" ""American Gangster,"" and ""Into the Wild"" did not make it to the dance for the Big 5. Only ""No Country for Old Men"" garnered nominations from both the Screen Actors and the Academy."
2008-01-27T19:17:01Z,"What is the appropriate mien for a potential winner at the SAG awards? A Nikki Blonsky freak-out would not seem to be appropriate given the fact that so many people are out of work, but then to go completely bummer and serious would seem not in keeping with the frothy spirit of the occasion. This being Hollywood, trust that someone will get both the mood and the zeitgeist completely wrong and clank one off the rim. Probably a TV person - the movie folks are much more carefully managed."

2008-01-27T18:06:08Z,"The Gold Rush blog at the Hollywood Reporter has noted that demand for inane, stand-up Q&As is up. Because of the glitter outage at the Golden Globes, press officials at the Screen Actors Guild have lengthened the red carpet at the Shrine Auditorium by 20 feet to accommodate all of the banal questions that were left over from events that had to without, thanks to threats of picketing by the striking Writers Guild of America."
2008-01-27T18:00:51Z,"Tonight, you will likely hear some brave political speeches from the Screen Actors Guild membership, wagging a finger about the writers' right to participate in the fruits of their labors, but a little historical perspective might have you reaching for the shaker of salt. This is the bunch, after all, that chose Ronald Reagan as its president. And Patty Duke. And Ed Asner. Notice a trend here? The Bagger doesn't either. The only flag the Screen Actors Guild flies with any consistency is one with a finger to the wind on it. Harsh? Well, in 1953, the Screen Actors Guild decided to take a rigorous stand on blacklisting: Some 96 percent of their members voted in favor of making members sign a ""loyalty oath."" They said they were sorry, oh, 50 years later. This glittering assembly of human jewelry, a delight to behold on screen and on the carpet, has all of the subtlety and not much of the homework of Michael Moore, who is fond of dishing out the brussel sprouts when it comes to making acceptance speeches."

One question we won't get answered in tomorrow's State of the Union is why economic performance since 2001 has been a pale shadow of Clinton-era prosperity. In fact, it's a question nobody in political life wants to answer. The administration and its supporters won't admit that performance has been lousy; critics are happy simply to point out how bad things have been, and blame Bush."

2008-01-27T11:31:34Z,"Seeing as he will be covering the SAG awards from his New Jersey basement, the Bagger could act like the annual ego-fest is a sideshow, but this year, it is the show, at least so far. In Hollywood, you need pomp for a little circumstance and the SAG awards have plenty: Real actual stars in full plumage in their natural habitat, which on a red carpet hunted at every turn by cameras. The fluff, the froth, the whole ""actors choosing actors"" conceit? Mad, jolly fun in a town that could use a little. In each of the last two years, the Bagger has ended up at the People party afterwards and it is a doozey. Last year, he spent part of the evening with the ""Little Miss Sunshine"" contingent. The directors, Valerie Faris and Jonathan Dayton, were having the time of their lives, partly because they won ensemble and partly because they were as surprised and happy as anyone else. Who will be doing the hugging and thanking and crying tonight? Will it be ""Juno"" that will hop in the LMS van and ride to glory or will the Coen's continue their roll, which picked up a bit more heat last night from the DGA? Picks later. (Sasha Stone points out that a bit of a cloud hanging over the SAG Awards, but there still be plenty of wattage under the canopy.)"

''It was a five-week vacation: we spent two weeks in Montenegro -- where we explored the canyon and hiked the Durmitor mountains -- and the rest of the time we were in Latvia. It was my first time white-water rafting, and I loved it. It was scary at first, but it got easier later. What I'll remember most was the nature: the waterfalls, the snakes and the landscape of the mountains. I was impressed by the small insects with lights in the darkness, and the fog in the evenings on the river.

2008-01-27T00:00:00Z,"KLEIN--John A., President and Chief Executive Officer of People's United Bank and its parent, People's United Financial, Inc. passed away January 25 at Yale-New Haven Hospital. He was 58 years old. John leaves his wife and high school sweetheart, Carla, to whom he was married for 37 years, and his two children and their spouses: Kristen Chiodo and her husband Chuck and Eric and his wife Allison. He had been looking forward to the arrival of Kristen and Chuck's baby -his first grandchild -who is due to be born in February. He is also survived by his sister Patricia and her husband Daniel Snow, of Norwalk, his brother Peter, of Florida, and his mother-in-law Almira Salomonsen, of Orange. John was born in Bridgeport on March 19, 1949. He grew up in Milford and graduated from Jonathan Law High School in 1967. He attended Columbia University and graduated from the University of Connecticut in 1971. John joined what was then known as People's Savings Bank, Bridgeport in December, 1971 as a management trainee. Later, while working full time at the bank, he attended the University of Connecticut Law School at night. Following his graduation from law school in 1977, he became the bank's first in-house lawyer and was appointed its General Counsel in 1984. Over the next fifteen years, he served in a variety of positions of increasing responsibility at People's United, culminating in his appointment as Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer of the bank in 1999. During his eight year tenure as Chief Executive Officer, John focused his efforts on ensuring that the bank would be able to meet the challenges of banking in the twenty-first century, while maintaining its culture and community focus. He effectively steered the bank through the difficult economy of the early 2000s, and when the bank determined it was necessary to sell its credit card business, he successfully negotiated a sale that retained the jobs in Bridgeport. Last year, John led the bank's conversion to full public stockholder ownership. The bank's new holding company, People's United Financial, Inc., raised approximately $3.4 billion in the offering, making it one of the largest stock offerings in United States history. Most recently under John's leadership, the bank completed the acquisition of Chittenden Corporation, expanding People's United to approximately $22 billion in assets and more than 300 branches in six states. John was also Chairman of the Board of the People's United Community Foundation, which he believed reflected the bank's ongoing commitment to community betterment. In addition to his involvement with the bank's outreach, John held leadership roles with a broad array of community and business organizations. These included: the board of directors of Bridgeport Hospital and YaleNew Haven Health; the Bridgeport Regional Business Council; the Greater Bridgeport Area Foundation; and The Business Council of Fairfield County. John also was a board member of the Connecticut Bankers Association, the Connecticut Business and Industry Association, and a member of the Connecticut Bar Association. Inspired by the example of his wife Carla, a longtime teacher, John was an advocate of the importance of education and, particularly, public education. He believed that a strong public educational system is critical to Connecticuts long term success and prosperity, and, as a proud graduate of the University of Connecticut (and a devoted Huskies fan), he was an enthusiastic supporter of UCONN. John was dedicated to supporting research aimed at making a difference in the fight against esophageal cancer. Following his treatment at the University of Michigan, John and Carla worked with the university to establish the John A. and Carla S. Klein Family Research Professorship in Thoracic Surgery to support a faculty member whose research focuses on diseases of the esophagus. Calling hours will take place on Monday, January 28, 2008 from 4-8pm in the Abriola Parkview Funeral Home, 419 White Plains Rd., Trumbull, CT. A memorial service will take place on Tuesday, January 29, 2008 beginning at 11am at the Klein Memorial Auditorium, 910 Fairfield Ave., Bridgeport, CT.

In 1973 he joined the Northern Trust Bank in Chicago, and in 1987 he relocated to the newly opened branch in Santa Barbara as a Vice President and Senior Portfolio Manager. George received the Best Performance award for the NT's Western Region in 1993 and again in 1994, and when he retired in 1996, he received accolades for anticipating the stock market falls in 1973 and 1987. A co-worker remembered him as a truly good colleague, mentor, and friend, generous with his time and judicious in his influence. He since predicted the unprecedented rise in the price of gold. George served on numerous Boards of Directors including Planned Parenthood and the Santa Barbara Museum of Art, and he supported local and national charities. His retirement years were rich and filled with travel. He lived as a gentleman, without fear, and with a twinkle in his eye.

He is survived by his wife, the artist Leah Schwartz, sister Helen Fellenbaum, sons David and Peter, daughters-in-law Isis and Martha, his grandchildren, Angie, Anna, Jesse, Christopher, Leah, Anthony, and Julia; two nieces and five nephews, his life-long friend Herb Rosen, as well as many friends and colleagues from his long association with Kaiser Medical. He was born in New York City on May 25th, 1920. During his childhood he overcame great adversity. At 10, his mother died and he was sent to the Hebrew Orphan Asylum in New York City. Through it all he developed strength of character that would propel him on to a full and long life. While at the orphanage, he cultivated his interest in the natural sciences, which led to a scholarship at Cornell at 17. After completing his studies, he came west to teach Botany and Biology at UC Berkeley. After teaching for several years, he returned to school, earning his medical degree from Harvard. He completed his residency at Mount Sinai in New York City and joined Kaiser Medical in 1954, where he practiced medicine for over 30 years. While there, he developed one of the first home care programs. He also helped pioneer in the field of oncology and became Head of the Oncology Department at Kaiser. Throughout his career and especially in retirement, he pursued his lifelong interest in botany, traveling to many parts of the world collecting plants, particularly succulents. He became a publisher and founded Strawberry Press, eventually publishing 10 volumes of the Euphorbia Journal and six more books including works on the Caudiciform and Pachycaul Succulents. He founded the Marin Bolinas Botanical Gardens where he developed one of the largest collections of succulents in the world. One of his greatest joys was sharing what he called ''the innocent world of plants'' with young people who visited him at his Bolinas Botanical Garden. Herman was a remarkable man, truly one of a kind! How do we memorialize such a man? When asked to sum up his outlook on life, he once said: ''It is a wonderful world because I have done everything I have wanted to do.'' ''How did I become so positive?'' ''Everything I have thought of in my life to date has worked for me.'' He called the Strawberry neighborhood of Mill Valley, where he lived for over 50 years, ''A little slice of heaven.'' He will be missed by his family and friends. A memorial is being planned; please contact (415)381-1326 or isis@ schwartzandassociates.com"

A graduate in 1925 of Miss Spence's School, she became a travel agent with Charles Ashmun, Inc. and in 1931 entered real estate brokerage and management with Potter, Hamilton & Co. and Douglas L. Elliman & Co. In 1942, she was commissioned in the Women's Army Auxiliary Corps Officer Candidate Class at Fort Des Moines, Iowa, serving for three and one-half years and attaining the rank of Major. From 1951-1954, in association with the Women's Bureau of the U.S. Department of Labor and the New York State Department of Labor, Miss Warren developed a successful pioneer program at the New York House and School of Industry on West 16th Street in the retraining of older women/office workers with secretarial skills. From 1956 until her retirement in 1974, Miss Warren served on the Board of National Missions of the United Presbyterian Church as Director of the Division of Church Building Aid. For thirty years, Miss Warren was active on the Board of Trustees of the Turtle Bay Music School and, at various times, on the Board of Directors of The Spence Alumnae Society. She was active, also, in the preservation of the Decorative Arts Collections which form the Cooper-Hewitt Museum, The Smithsonian Institutions National Musem of Design.

Her work is in the permanent collections of The Metropolitan Museam of Art, The Museum of the City of New York and The New York Historical Society. Miss Warren's maternal greatgrandfather, William Moller, came to this country from Germany early in the 1800s and was a founder of Havemeyer & Moller, which became the American Sugar Refining Company. He was the inventor of early refining machinery. A great-greatgrandfather, Laurent Allien of Bordeaux, a French Naval Officer, settled on a sugar plantation in Santo Domingo, relocating to New York upon the uprising there in 1789. Her paternal forebears came to New England in the early 1600s, Thomas Leffingwell being a founder of Norwich, Connecticut. Miss Warren is survived by her cousins, the Comtesse Guy de Tilly-Blaru of Paris, Melfort Campbell of Chicago, Isabel Allien Dawson of Massachusetts. A memorial service will be held in the Chapel of St. James Episcopal Church, Madison Avenue at 71st Street on a future date.

2008-01-28T12:23:05Z,"It's hard to say how many literary disciples Walker Percy has today, but one is surely Richard Ford. Ford's novel ""The Sportswriter"" strikingly recalls ""The Moviegoer,"" starting with that compound noun in the title. In 2005, Ford was a guest on the National Public Radio program ""The Connection,"" for a series called ""The Book That Changed My Life."" The book Ford chose to talk about was indeed ""The Moviegoer."" It was a fine discussion. Ford views the book's dynamic as ""a renewing experience"" and Binx as a hero ""headed toward the light"" and ""trying to find a vocabulary for affirmation, trying to find the institutions in life that will let him like life better and be better at it."" It intrigues me that Ford never mentions religion as a force in the novel. This despite the fact that the exchange features a cameo call-in by ""Linda,"" evidently Linda Whitney Hobson, who wrote an accessible little book, ""Understanding Walker Percy,"" in which Percy's Christianity is the single most important critical thread.

2008-01-28T00:00:00Z,"KLEIN--John A., President and Chief Executive Officer of People's United Bank and its parent, People's United Financial, Inc. passed away January 25 at Yale-New Haven Hospital. He was 58 years old. John leaves his wife and high school sweetheart, Carla, to whom he was married for 37 years, and his two children and their spouses: Kristen Chiodo and her husband Chuck and Eric and his wife Allison. He had been looking forward to the arrival of Kristen and Chuck's baby -his first grandchild -who is due to be born in February. He is also survived by his sister Patricia and her husband Daniel Snow, of Norwalk, his brother Peter, of Florida, and his mother-in-law Almira Salomonsen, of Orange. John was born in Bridgeport on March 19, 1949. He grew up in Milford and graduated from Jonathan Law High School in 1967. He attended Columbia University and graduated from the University of Connecticut in 1971. John joined what was then known as People's Savings Bank, Bridgeport in December, 1971 as a management trainee. Later, while working full time at the bank, he attended the University of Connecticut Law School at night. Following his graduation from law school in 1977, he became the bank's first in-house lawyer and was appointed its General Counsel in 1984. Over the next fifteen years, he served in a variety of positions of increasing responsibility at People's United, culminating in his appointment as Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer of the bank in 1999. During his eight year tenure as Chief Executive Officer, John focused his efforts on ensuring that the bank would be able to meet the challenges of banking in the twenty-first century, while maintaining its culture and community focus. He effectively steered the bank through the difficult economy of the early 2000s, and when the bank determined it was necessary to sell its credit card business, he successfully negotiated a sale that retained the jobs in Bridgeport. Last year, John led the bank's conversion to full public stockholder ownership. The bank's new holding company, People's United Financial, Inc., raised approximately $3.4 billion in the offering, making it one of the largest stock offerings in United States history. Most recently under John's leadership, the bank completed the acquisition of Chittenden Corporation, expanding People's United to approximately $22 billion in assets and more than 300 branches in six states. John was also Chairman of the Board of the People's United Community Foundation, which he believed reflected the bank's ongoing commitment to community betterment. In addition to his involvement with the bank's outreach, John held leadership roles with a broad array of community and business organizations. These included: the board of directors of Bridgeport Hospital and YaleNew Haven Health; the Bridgeport Regional Business Council; the Greater Bridgeport Area Foundation; and The Business Council of Fairfield County. John also was a board member of the Connecticut Bankers Association, the Connecticut Business and Industry Association, and a member of the Connecticut Bar Association. Inspired by the example of his wife Carla, a longtime teacher, John was an advocate of the importance of education and, particularly, public education. He believed that a strong public educational system is critical to Connecticuts long term success and prosperity, and, as a proud graduate of the University of Connecticut (and a devoted Huskies fan), he was an enthusiastic supporter of UCONN. John was dedicated to supporting research aimed at making a difference in the fight against esophageal cancer. Following his treatment at the University of Michigan, John and Carla worked with the university to establish the John A. and Carla S. Klein Family Research Professorship in Thoracic Surgery to support a faculty member whose research focuses on diseases of the esophagus. Calling hours will take place on Monday, January 28, 2008 from 4-8pm in the Abriola Parkview Funeral Home, 419 White Plains Rd., Trumbull, CT. A memorial service will take place on Tuesday, January 29, 2008 beginning at 11am at the Klein Memorial Auditorium, 910 Fairfield Ave., Bridgeport, CT. In lieu of flowers, the family asks that donations be made to the University of Michigan in support of the John A. and Carla S. Klein Family Research Professorship in Thoracic Surgery. University of Michigan, Department of Surgery, 1500 E. Medical Center Dr., 2110 Taubman Center, Ann Arbor, MI 48109-5346. For travel directions and more information visit us at abriola.com."

Europe buys about 25 percent of its gas from Gazprom, and about 25 percent of it is shipped through Ukraine.

Production is expected to begin in the spring, with a premiere by the end of the year. “Crash” received the Oscar for best picture in 2006. Among the film’s producers, Paul Haggis, Bobby Moresco, Bob Yari, Don Cheadle, Mark R. Harris and Tom Nunan will take part in the television series. “This series will present an opportunity to delve into many subjects, not just race relations in L.A.,” Mr. Cheadle, right, who co-starred in the film, said in a news release. “I don’t think you can do 13 episodes on that subject and keep people interested.

The violinist, Peter Kaman, charged that the orchestra had discriminated against him because of his disability — a severe anxiety disorder — and systematically harassed him.

Mr. Kaman’s lawyer, Brenda Little, said on Monday that she would file a motion for the judge to reconsider last week’s ruling; an appeal of the earlier dismissals is already pending, she said. The lawsuit was the latest chapter of turmoil in the orchestra: Mr. Schwarz has faced persistent opposition from players, several of whom have said they were targets of vandalism."
