1989-04-16T00:00:00Z,"LEAD: Wang Meng, the novelist and short-story writer, who is now Minister of Culture of the People's Republic of China, underlined his familiarity with American popular music by singing ''The Way We Were'' when we met last September. When I couldn't reciprocate with a Chinese popular song, he gave me three cassettes of recent Chinese rock music, and"
1989-04-16T00:00:00Z,"LEAD: Intel's new microprocessor, the i486, was introduced here last week at the annual Comdex Spring computer trade show, and a remarkable piece of technology it is. Packing more than a million transistors on a fingernail-sized sliver of silicon, it incorporates such functions as floating-point mathematics (an advanced form of calculating that accelerates number-intensive applications) and high-speed memory that used to reside on separate chips."
1989-04-16T00:00:00Z,"LEAD: For the last week I've been on the road, showing off the new Canon Xapshot still-video camera from coast to coast. The latest technological advance was greeted with a mixture of curiosity and skepticism, both of which dissolved into gee-whiz amazement when I showed people their pictures on their own television screens."

1989-04-16T00:00:00Z,"LEAD: Yes. Olympic competition is supposed to represent the highest level of competition. This ideal is not realized when certain people are prohibited from competing because they are professionals. Many believe the N.B.A. stars, not the Olympic stars, are the best players in the world. They should be given the opportunity to prove it."
1989-04-16T00:00:00Z,"LEAD: Orel Hershiser captured everyone's attention with his streak of 59 scoreless innings late last season, but on the basis of what-have-you-done-lately, Dave Stieb has to command a major share of everyone's early-season attention."
1989-04-16T00:00:00Z,"LEAD: A WEEK of soaking rains did little to fill the New York City reservoirs on which 90 percent of Westchester depends, so beginning tomorrow most county residents will face dramatic new restrictions on their water use. Empty private swimming pools must remain empty, lawns and flower gardens must not be watered and commercial water use must be reduced by 20 percent or municipal penalties will be imposed."

1989-04-16T00:00:00Z,"LEAD: A QUESTION I am asked at least once a month is how I can tolerate my three-hour, round-trip commute each weekday. All that wasted time, they say, when I could be sleeping or spending time with my family or simply relaxing. I just smile and honestly reply that I thoroughly enjoy commuting. I take the Metro-North train from Greens Farms, a medium-sized station in Westport, to Grand Central Terminal."
1989-04-16T00:00:00Z,"LEAD: The New York University Chamber Music Society has been offering a series called ''The Year of Russian Music'' this season at Merkin Concert Hall. The latest installment, offered on Thursday evening, was almost two concerts in one, with the first half devoted to duo-piano music of Stravinsky and the second to colorfully scored chamber works by contemporary Soviet composers."
1989-04-16T00:00:00Z,"LEAD: Q. I have dark-brown Formica on the tops of my kitchen counters. These tops have become dull and there seems to be a residue of cleaning powder that I am unable to remove. Is there anything I can use that will not harm the plastic surface, and what can I use to restore the original shine?"
1989-04-16T00:00:00Z,"LEAD: CHRISTOPHER HEWAT'S view of the art world may be summed up as ''if you can't lick it, join it.'' And to judge from statements made by him for a 1983 show in Manhattan, he has done just that by establishing a museum in his cellar, naming it the Musee Ruse and - something that distinguishes it from most other institutions of this kind - showing only forgeries."
1989-04-16T00:00:00Z,LEAD: Officials here have decided that it is not enough for the United Nations to send peacekeepers to troubled areas; it must recognize conflicts before they erupt and try to defuse them.
1989-04-16T00:00:00Z,"LEAD: These moments when the thermometer creeps up close to 60 degrees and the wind can almost be described as balmy are not the only signs of early spring. Daffodils, azaleas and cherry blossoms are now visible to the naked eye, as are an abundance of small but very noticeable fashion touches in midtown"
1989-04-16T00:00:00Z,"LEAD: While psychotherapy has changed since Freud published ''The Interpretation of Dreams'' in 1900, its terminology has not improved. If anything, it has grown worse in going from ''castration complex'' and ''penis envy'' to ''object relations.'' All of these strike me as indecent ways to describe our struggle for happiness."
1989-04-16T00:00:00Z,"LEAD: As he announced his budget agreement with Congress in a Rose Garden ceremony Friday, President Bush said it constituted ''a first manageable step'' in resolving the deficit problem that has plagued the United States."
1989-04-16T00:00:00Z,"LEAD: As the skies darken, the sidewalks surrounding this city's central Public Square grow empty and the outbound cars that clogged the downtown streets during rush-hour gradually disappear. A scattering of lighted office windows is but a dim reminder of the work day."
1989-04-16T00:00:00Z,LEAD: The Minnesota Supreme Court has ruled that warning labels on cigarette packs do not give tobacco companies blanket immunity from lawsuits by victims of lung cancer and other illnesses related to smoking.

1989-04-16T00:00:00Z,"LEAD: Beneath the public furor over whether the Supreme Court is on the verge of withdrawing the constitutional right to obtain an abortion is a case that, in another context, might almost be called routine."
1989-04-16T00:00:00Z,"LEAD: THE guard at the gate didn't want to let me in. ''We open again at 2 o'clock,'' he said."
1989-04-16T00:00:00Z,"LEAD: AT a Radio Shack Computer Center in Manhattan, Lilliam McCann, a sales clerk, recently had the frustrating experience of trying to explain to a group of visitors from the Soviet Union why she couldn't sell them a personal computer."
1989-04-16T00:00:00Z,"LEAD: For This Week: Last call to lime lawns; use a calibrated spreader. Finish pruning hedges. Plant another row of lettuce. Plant spinach, peas, onion sets, radish. Spread a circle of general garden fertilizer around peonies and cultivate it in lightly. Do not cut foliage of crocus or daffodils, but allow it to yellow naturally."
1989-04-16T00:00:00Z,"LEAD: Watching Sugar Ray Robinson in his lithe prime, it was almost possible to forget that his sport was about knocking one's opponent senseless. But it was impossible to forget why Mr. Robinson was nicknamed Sugar and why, on his death last week, he was recalled as probably the best fighter of all time."
1989-04-16T00:00:00Z,"LEAD: FINLAND is a land of contradictions, curiosities and sly surprises. As the eastern limit of the Western world, it is a frontier country. It may live in the shadow of the Soviet Union geographically, sharing a 788-mile border with its giant eastern neighbor, but culturally, economically and politically Finland is entirely Western."
1989-04-16T00:00:00Z,"LEAD: THE fight at Concord's North Bridge between British troops and American colonists on April 19, 1775, began as a misunderstanding, as fights often do. Concord minutemen, who with militia from neighboring towns had spent the better part of the morning avoiding the advancing British soldiers, saw smoke rising from Concord's center."
1989-04-16T00:00:00Z,LEAD: A declarer at the bridge table is like a commuter with a train to catch: In an emergency he will run assuming that he will not trip but he would prefer to tread a careful path and avoid any perils.
1989-04-16T00:00:00Z,LEAD: There should take place - between the N.B.A. championships and the Summer Olympics of each Olympic quadrennial -a double-elimination round-robin national tournament to determine what sole N.B.A. team should represent the United States.

1989-04-16T00:00:00Z,"LEAD: To the Editor: On a recent trip to Morocco I noted that the children had nothing to play with and used pebbles in their alley games. Shortly afterward my son went to Africa, and I suggested taking along tennis balls. They were a big hit. Now another son is in Ecuador and took tennis balls with the result that a whole village is playing man-in-the-middle."
1989-04-16T00:00:00Z,"LEAD: To the Editor: Amsterdam, once a place of culture and beauty, is now covered by graffiti on its walls, dog excrement on its streets and garbage in its canals."
1989-04-16T00:00:00Z,"LEAD: ''Forbidden Broadway.'' The very title is clearly meant to suggest something clandestine and a bit wicked. And in its early years, in 1983 or 1984, Gerard Alessandrini's revue did indeed leave you feeling that you'd been sharing the evening murk with a cabal of performing witches and warlocks, assembled to stick verbal pins into effigies of their theatrical enemies - and inflict pain, if not on their bodies, at least on their egos."
1989-04-16T00:00:00Z,"LEAD: Once a year, on May 20, this city of one million comes to a halt and the mystical figures of Bolivia's rich folklore take over. Thousands of dancers, mostly of Aymara Indian origin, snake through the streets, wearing elaborate devil, China Supay, Moreno and Angel masks and costumes. Thousands of pacenos, as residents are called, line the streets to watch."
1989-04-16T00:00:00Z,"LEAD: WHEN Vincent Amato was 14 years old, he said he wanted to be a pilot. Since he was too young to actually fly a plane, he did the next best thing. He started building models. That same year, he started selling model planes from his father's appliance and plumbing store in Middletown. That was beginning of his nearly 50-year career in the hobby business."
1989-04-16T00:00:00Z,"LEAD: ''I'm in a state, I'm in a state,'' Charles (Black) Francis of the Pixies sighs in one of the 15 songs on ''Doolittle'' (Elektra 60856, LP, cassette and CD); then he howls it. He never gets around to explaining just what that state is, but he doesn't have to. The band's music defines it for him better than anything he says."
1989-04-16T00:00:00Z,"LEAD: THE wide board called the sill, which is visible beneath the narrower threshold in an exterior doorway, receives much wear and frequently develops rot. Mildly decayed sills can be repaired by using two-part wood hardener and filler. Worn and badly decayed sills must be replaced."
1989-04-16T00:00:00Z,"LEAD: Restaurant closings aren't normally reported in the entertainment section of newspapers. However, last December, ''Tattinger's'' - a West Side eatery at the intersection of Wednesdays and 10 P.M. - was shut down when NBC inspectors found it had ratings in the basement."
1989-04-16T00:00:00Z,"LEAD: THE desire of a Conservative synagogue to expand its catering facilities in a residential section of Woodmere is being opposed by neighbors, who say it is a commercial venture rather than a religious one. The dispute points up the changing demographics of the largely Jewish Five Towns."
1989-04-16T00:00:00Z,LEAD: Ian Millar is fond of saying that anything can happen in equine jumping because the horse's frame of mind is unpredictable.
1989-04-16T00:00:00Z,LEAD: Imposing music is often forgotten because we do not know how to make it fit into modern concerts. Christa Ludwig and James Levine solved just such a tailoring problem at Avery Fisher Hall on Friday night. They took the solo recital format and let it out a little at the waist. Thus room was made for something new and fulfilling to come in.
1989-04-16T00:00:00Z,LEAD: Consider the designer shopping bag. Consider Alex Lindsay. To all intents they're synonymous.
1989-04-16T00:00:00Z,"LEAD: PUBLIC SCHOOL 157, at the northwest corner of 126th Street and St. Nicholas Avenue, went up between 1896 and 1899, a time when a new generation of school buildings was created to bring not simply instruction but also an uplifting, cultural influence to New York City's poor and working-class sections."
1989-04-16T00:00:00Z,"LEAD: ''The Phantom Lady,'' which is now being offered by the SoHo Rep as an American debut, has a certain documented durability about it. The comedy was written by the great Spanish playwright Pedro Calderon de la Barca in 1629, when New York was still New Amsterdam and a Broadway house was a tepee. In an eloquent and often poetic English translation by Edwin"
1989-04-16T00:00:00Z,"LEAD: The first time the bullpen gate opened in the ninth inning the other night, Lee Guetterman walked across the outfield grass and heard the thumping of his heart. He had been pitching professionally since 1981, had been working in the big leagues since 1984, and yet this was something brand new."
1989-04-16T00:00:00Z,"LEAD: For those alarmed about America's supposed loss of competitiveness, digital audio tape - a technology that makes nearly distortion-free home recording possible - is the latest example of how the United States has lost its lead. But history shows that new technology often displaces existing technology slowly and with difficulty."
1989-04-16T00:00:00Z,"LEAD: Collectors simply accept national symbols on stamps, and seldom worry about their origins."
1989-04-16T00:00:00Z,"LEAD: Western Playboy won the $286,000 Blue Grass Stakes after bumping and battling with previously unbeaten Dispersal today at Keeneland."

1989-04-16T00:00:00Z,"LEAD: This week's subscription program at the New York Philharmonic combines the tried and true with more of the same: a brightly played early Haydn symphony (the one called No. 5, though it is not really quite that early); Alicia de Larrocha in Mozart's Ninth Concerto, and Tchaikovsky's ''Pathetique'' symphony, under the experienced stewardship of Gunther"
1989-04-16T00:00:00Z,"LEAD: ''Walkers,'' an enraged but exasperatingly sketchy new drama by Marion Isaac McClinton, a Minnesota-based playwright, tackles so many serious themes that only a four-hour epic tragedy could begin to develop them into a cohesive dramatic tapestry. Racism, black self-hatred and inherited patterns of family violence are only the three most obvious issues among those raised by the play, at the Hudson Guild Theater, 441 West 26th"
1989-04-16T00:00:00Z,"LEAD: AFTER recovering from the shock last week of learning that industry had put 58 million pounds of toxic substances into the air, land and water in Connecticut in a year, environmental and citizen groups began to plan how to use the information against polluters."

1989-04-16T00:00:00Z,"LEAD: New rules proposed for New York City parks, many of them aimed at homeless people, have come under sharp criticism from some civic and religious leaders on moral and constitutional grounds."
1989-04-16T00:00:00Z,"LEAD: To the Editor: The article on Waddesdon, England (Travel, March 5) brought fond memories. I am one of the German Jewish boys who were taken in by James and Dorothy de Rothschild in 1939. Although I arrived from Germany by myself, I joined my brother Bernd, who had arrived a few months earlier. After about a year in Waddesdon, my brother and I came to the United"

1989-04-16T00:00:00Z,"LEAD: MORE cars are being stolen each year in Connecticut, and the figures for this year indicate that 1989 may produce a record for car thefts. Hoping to reduce such thefts, the state police and local police departments have begun programs to teach people how to keep their cars more secure."
1989-04-16T00:00:00Z,"LEAD: Tony Bennett, Barbara Cook, Phyllis Newman and Margaret Whiting are among the performers who will join in a musical salute to the composer and producer Jule Styne tomorrow night at 9 P.M. at the New York Marriott Marquis Hotel, 45th Street and Broadway. A dinner preceding the show, at 7:30, will benefit the Postgraduate Center for Mental Health."
1989-04-16T00:00:00Z,"LEAD: THE unrest that killed at least 19 people in the Soviet republic of Georgia last week is the latest crisis in what is usually called Moscow's ''nationalities problem.'' But as events there showed, the problem is not so much nationalities - a term that suggests loose ethnic groupings -as old and rooted nations, with identities that predate both Russian and Soviet power."
1989-04-16T00:00:00Z,LEAD: THE DIAGNOSIS: cancer.
1989-04-16T00:00:00Z,LEAD: Jeff Ralston was not being entirely altruistic when he offered his services as a human guinea pig.
1989-04-16T00:00:00Z,"LEAD: In ''Enigma,'' presented by Jennifer Muller's company, the Works, on Thursday night at the Joyce Theater, Miss Muller tackles the age-old theme of civilization versus nature or the spirit, and comes out squarely on the side of nature."

1989-04-16T00:00:00Z,"LEAD: ONE of the few good things about the good old days was the New Deal, and one of the many good things about that was the construction, from 1935 to 1938, of the Jersey Homesteads. A Work Projects Administration community, it housed 200 families of mainly Jewish immigrant garment workers relocated from New York City."

Last week, during a two-hour stay at Walter Reed Army Medical Center, Mrs. Bush sipped a solution of a radioactive form of iodine to stop the production of thyroid hormones, which regulate the body's metabolism and other functions."

1989-04-16T00:00:00Z,"LEAD: Absolutely not! It would deprive our student-athletes the opportunity of the dream of a lifetime. Although we've fallen short of the gold, the American public should not panic. Attention should be given to the team-selection process, emphasizing players who can score from the perimeter and play good team defense."
1989-04-16T00:00:00Z,"LEAD: IN LESS THAN TWO DECADES, DERMATOLOGY has undergone a striking metamorphosis from what was once regarded as the lowly field of cosmetic medicine into one of the frontiers of medical science. Seemingly intractable mysteries of skin physiology are unraveling; once-untreatable conditions are succumbing to potent new medications, and preventive medicine is assuming great prominence in battling skin diseases."
1989-04-16T00:00:00Z,"LEAD: IT was a bitingly cold night, but John T. King was standing outside the front entrance to United Methodist Church in shirt sleeves and jeans, watching the parking lot fill up. One by one, and then in small groups, his talented charges alighted from cars and came toward him."
1989-04-16T00:00:00Z,"LEAD: In 1945, Hobie Billingsley won the national collegiate one-meter and three-meter diving titles for Ohio State. In 1953, after getting a master's degree, he became a high school coach. He earned $500 a year for coaching and $3,900 for teaching physical education classes. He made ends meet by doing comedy diving and trampoline routines with Bruce Harlan, a college teammate."
1989-04-16T00:00:00Z,"LEAD: To the Editor: ''Seeing Ground Zero in Nevada'' (Travel, March 12) brought back vivid memories. I was one of ''the national press invited in and allowed to cover'' the first open-to-the-media atmospheric test at Nevada's Yucca Flat on April 22, 1952. Among the reporters who gathered 10 miles from Ground Zero to see (and feel the hot blast of) the explosion were The New York Times's veteran atomic expert, Bill Lawrence, the broadcaster Lowell Thomas and the Hearst columnist Bob"

The couple plan to marry in June."
1989-04-16T00:00:00Z,"LEAD: The mature work of the late Morton Feldman (1926-87) is poorly represented on records. That makes the appearance of ''Three Voices'' on the New Albion label especially welcome (NA 018; CD only). But there are peculiarities about this recording, and they pose questions about Feldman's genuinely original esthetic that his performers haven't yet satisfactorily resolved."
1989-04-16T00:00:00Z,"LEAD: To the Editor: I enjoyed William B. Whitman's article on Pitigliano (Travel, March 12). However, the author is unjust to Pope Sixtus V. The pope responsible for the influx of Jewish refugees in 1569 was Pius V (1565-72), who in 1569 expelled the Jews from the papal states. Sixtus V (1585-90) allowed the return of the Jews, including Jewish bankers and moneylenders."
1989-04-16T00:00:00Z,"LEAD: A report last Sunday in the ''Week in Connecticut'' column about an art show in Westport misidentified the artist and the setting. He is Richard Heim, not Richard Helm, and the show is at the Town Hall, not at the Arts Center."

1989-04-16T00:00:00Z,"LEAD: ALVAR AALTO is considered one of the foremost architects of our century, along with Mies van der Rohe, Le Corbusier and Frank Lloyd Wright. Architects from all over the world regularly make pilgrimages to see his work. But his buildings, and most of his designs except for his widely distributed chairs and stools, are far less familiar than the work of other modern masters since most of the best examples are in Finland."

Levine's essay ''When the Ballpark Cost Just a Nickel'' [ Westchester Opinion, March 26 ] , he states, in an otherwise well-written piece, that he thinks sound at sea level travels 550 feet a second.
