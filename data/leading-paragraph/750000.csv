DWYER GRAY from the cause of PARNELL is even more important than that of the brothers HARRINGTON, already noticed, seeing that Mr. GRAY is half owner of the Freeman's Journal, which was a trustworthy Parnellite organ throughout the contest in Kilkenny.

1891-05-17T00:00:00Z,"LONDON, May 16. -- Henry Irving's revival of ""The Corsican Brothers"" at the Lyceum Theatre has been made memorable and attractive by the almost unprecedented scenic splendor of the play.

Young, to say nothing of the score of older astronomies meant for students more or less advanced."
1891-05-17T00:00:00Z,"CHICAGO, May 16. -- Business at the theatres continues to be good, although the end of the regular season is at hand. The presence in the city of first-class attractions at-nearly all the theatres accounts for this. This is the time of year when the New-York stock companies play engagements here, and it is also the time of year when there are many strangers in the city who visit the places of amusement."

1891-05-17T00:00:00Z,Why are the public schools of the greatest city on the continent among the worst in the world?

1891-05-23T00:00:00Z,"CINCINNATI, May 22. -- Welch, the diminutive pitcher of the New-Yorks, faced the Cincinnati Club here to-day.

1891-05-23T00:00:00Z,"The American Newspaper Publishers' Association adopted, at its last annual meeting in this city, a resolution appointing a committee to arrange for a contest, to be entered by all manufacturers of typesetting machines, in order to determine which is adapted for the production of the best practical results ""under ordinary newspaper conditions in well-managed offices."""
1891-05-23T00:00:00Z,"The slowness with which great bodies move is especially illustrated by the slowness of great theological bodies. It was generally assumed, when the Presbyterian creed, as contained in the Westminster Confession, was put into the hands of its friends to be revised, that the General Assembly to which the report of the revisers was submitted would act upon the report."
1891-05-23T00:00:00Z,"TORONTO, Ontario, May 22. -- The Dominion Government has no systematized method of collecting statistics relative to the supply of flour and wheat and crop returns in Canada, and in consequence dealers are generally in the dark as to the stock on hand, and are left to depend largely on the old-fashioned methods of comparing notes."

1891-05-23T00:00:00Z,"Why Gov. HILL should have waited nearly a year and a half before filling the vacancy on the Board of Electrical Control caused by the resignation of Mr. GIBBENS in January, 1890, it is difficult to surmise. The board has been embarrassed by his failure to perform this duty and has frequently had to postpone its meetings for lack of a quorum."

Just now there is a general wide-spread want of confidence on the part of investors, and consequently all the financial centres of Europe are peculiarly sensitive. The financial collapse of Nov. 15 last, when the great house of the Barings fell, has had more far-reaching effects than is generally known."
1891-05-24T00:00:00Z,Some ten or twelve years ago -- the date is of no importance or the exact place -- an Englishman wandered down to the north of Scotland and invested some of his superfluous capital in a salmon river. Such an adventurer is often but poorly repaid for his enterprise.

1891-05-24T00:00:00Z,"There never was a time in the history of Mayor Grant's administration when his movements were watched so closely as they are watched now. His continued delay in making appointments has created excitement not only among the politicians themselves, but among a large class of people who do not usually disturb themselves about the movements of Mayor Grant or the syndicate which controls the Municipal Government."
1891-05-24T00:00:00Z,"The Butte City (Mon.) Inter Mountain, Republican, is for Blaine for President in 1892. ""With protection, reciprocity, honest money, clean elections, and equal rights inscribed on the Republican banner, James G.

The demand of Mayor Shakespeare that the Consul be not allowed to return to this city is sufficient justification for its use."
1891-05-24T00:00:00Z,"LONG BRANCH, N.J., May 23. -- Long Branch just now is one of the busiest places along the New-Jersey coast. Painters, carpenters, decorators, and gardeners are actively preparing for the exodus that will soon begin in the near-by cities.

1891-05-24T00:00:00Z,"OTTAWA, Ontario, May 23. -- There is a movement on foot to establish a Federal divorce court in Canada. At present all decrees are granted by the Senate.

1891-05-24T00:00:00Z,"Chicago, May 23. -- Chairman Finlay of the Western Passenger Association has no reason to be in doubt as to the Chicago and Alton's position.

1891-05-24T00:00:00Z,"CINCINNATI, May 23. -- Our fellow-townsman, Mr. John Ewing, is responsible for the defeat administered to the Reds to-day by the Giants.

1891-05-24T00:00:00Z,The assurance given by Messrs. BAKER and BUTTERWORTH that the recent rumor of a postponement of the Chicago Fair until 1894 is unfounded will be welcome everywhere. To celebrate in 1893 an event whose commemoration should properly come in 1892 is quite anachronism enough for a community that prides itself on being wide-awake and on time.
1891-05-24T00:00:00Z,"MOUNT VERNON BARRACK, Ala., May 23. -- Thirty Indians belonging to the Chiricahua band of Apaches, who were mustered into the United States Army, arrived at this post at noon Thursday and, with fifty-five of the captive Apaches at Mount Vernon, who had also enlisted, were formed into Company L of the Twelfth Infantry.

1891-05-24T00:00:00Z,"After long deliberation and much patient preparation the Encyclical of the Pope on the social questions of the day has made its appearance. It is marked by the characteristics that have made the present Pope heartily respected, even by those who cannot consider well-grounded his claims to supreme authority in matters of belief."
1891-05-24T00:00:00Z,"The presence of an unusually large number of our war ships in home waters, with a prospect of their remaining here for several months to come, has brought up the project of having all the available vessels on the Atlantic coast take part in a series of fleet manoeuvres and exercises a little later in the season."

1891-05-24T00:00:00Z,"Third-track construction by the elevated railroad company in Ninth Avenue came to an unceremonious end yesterday morning, when the police stepped in under orders from headquarters. Inspector Byrnes in turn received his orders from the Mayor. There was no dallying over the matter when once the ball started to roll."
1891-05-24T00:00:00Z,"Visitors to the Central Park yesterday were surprised, and those with any sense of what is fitting in the Park must have been annoyed, to see at various points on the walks a lot of weighing machines, on which, by the magic ""nickel in the slot,"" the passer by could ascertain with more or less accuracy the number of pounds in his body and its belongings."
1891-05-24T00:00:00Z,"The recent visit of ex-Senator Ingalls to this city, while the newspapers are discussing the successorship to Mr. Edmunds in the Senate, has struck some of the politicians who make the Fifth Avenue Hotel their Summer headquarters as in the nature of a striking coincidence. It is not the first time that Ingalls has appeared as a sort of Nemesis to Edmunds."
1891-05-24T00:00:00Z,"HANOVER, N.H., May 23. -- The Dartmouth athletic team which will represent the college next week in the intercollegiate meet at Springfield, although not the equal of last year's team, will make a hard fight for the championship and the association cup. It is considerably weakened by the loss of so many of last year's athletes, and very little interest is taken by the college at large as to what men are sent."
1891-05-24T00:00:00Z,"The little park at the lower end of Manhattan Island is unique among the breathing places and pleasure grounds of this metropolis.

1891-05-24T00:00:00Z,"The Cleveland papers say that Sharrott gave a great display of pitching skill in Cleveland. One needed to sit behind the catcher to see now elegantly he would work the corners. Every time that a Cleveland batter ""got in the hole"" Sharrot would either strike him out or the umpire would call him out. He seems to have better command of the ball than any of the New-York pitchers."
1891-05-24T00:00:00Z,"The popular interest that is taken in transatlantic racing nowadays is not in any degree less than it was thirty years ago, when the paddlewheel gave way to the screw, and when several new lines became competitors for ocean laurels. Nearly everybody has forgotten those days, but not so Thomas Schavering, who was an engineer on several of the transatlantic liners before the war, and who recalls the ships of that period with great distinctness."
1891-05-24T00:00:00Z,"CLEVELAND, May 23. -- The game today was one-sided. Cleveland's players batted Clarkson at will, and played a remarkably strong game in the field. Score:"

1891-05-24T00:00:00Z,"The recent decision of Judge THAYER of the United States District Court in a case relating to a Trust combination agreement deserves attention mainly for the reason that it was based upon the new Anti-Trust statute of Missouri. Three years ago a combination called the American Preservers' Company was formed by the loading manufacturers of preserves, jellies, and the like, and the Taylor Manufacturing Company of St. Louis became a part of it."
1891-05-24T00:00:00Z,The officers of the Cypress Hills Cemetery have decided on a plan for the improvement of the grounds of this burial place and have begun work which they believe will make the cemetery one of the most attractive in this vicinity.

1891-05-24T00:00:00Z,"ALBANY, May 23. -- Another instance of Gov. Hill's belief that the average taxpayer possesses a short memory is afforded by his treatment of the bill extending the term of office of Subway Commissioner Hess another year. The measure was introduced in the Assembly by John E. Brodsky of the Eighth New-York District. It came to the Senate during the dead-lock."

1891-05-24T00:00:00Z,"NEWPORT, R.I., May 23. -- The Newport season is undoubtedly further advanced than usual at this time.

1891-05-24T00:00:00Z,"Poolroom men continued betting in their rooms yesterday as usual in defiance of the law, believing themselves safe under the ""commission agent"" subterfuge, and with a further belief that the police authorities are in sympathy with them rather than against them in their violation of law, just as the same authorities are with the violators of the excise laws who pay tribute to Tammany Hall, and somebody else, possibly."
1891-05-24T00:00:00Z,"Nearly sixty years ago, in the days when gentlewomen in reduced circumstances found the path to remunerative industry strewn with most forbidden obstacles, ""The Ladies' Depository"" was organized in this city.

1891-05-24T00:00:00Z,"Whole volumes might be filled with a mere noting of gown ideas, any one of which it would be possible to elaborate in many different ways without transgressing the limits of good taste. The canons of fashion admit of such liberal interpretation that there is little danger of incurring the charge of heresy. There are no censors, self-constituted or appointed, and advanced thought is rather at a premium than otherwise."

Aikens, Treasurer of Blaine County, and one of the most respected men in Nebraska, while acting as custodian of a stock thief whom he had assisted in capturing, was shot through the body at a late hour last night by citizens who, in the darkness, mistook him for a desperado.

A great variety of opinion, founded partly on honest impressions of its first performance and partly on prejudice, has been expressed concerning it. It has excited hot discussion, and book publishers and play producers believe that is a good thing for a book or a play."
1891-05-24T00:00:00Z,"The New-York Riding Club could not have chanced upon a better day for its fifteenth annual ride to Jerome Park than yesterday.

1891-06-03T00:00:00Z,"At this distance there is no reason why it should not be said that Sir WILLIAM GORDON CUMMING seems to have been ill advised in bringing a suit for slander against certain persons who had promulgated the report that he had been detected in cheating at cards.

The Brooklyns look the lead in the second inning and held it throughout the contest."

1891-06-06T00:00:00Z,"A dispatch to the St. Louis Globe-Democrat from Mexico says that ""the Chihuahua smelter has been bought in the interest of English capitalists who have contracts for a supply of lead ores from Sierra Mojada."" They will begin to ship the ores as soon as a railroad now in process of construction shall have been finished."
1891-06-06T00:00:00Z,"To-day at 3:30 o'clock Civil Engineer R.E. Peary of the navy will leave this city for a journey toward the north pole by way of Greenland. He will take his departure on the dirty and greasy little whaling steamer Kite, which arrived here three days ago, and which now lies at the foot of Baltic Street, Brooklyn. Mrs. Peary, who is a young and very attractive woman, will accompany her husband on this perilous voyage."

1891-06-06T00:00:00Z,"As we have before remarked, the question whether Sir WILLIAM GORDON CUMMING has been cheating at cards furnishes a very small part of the interest with which his suit for slander against certain persons for saying that he had done so as followed in England and in this country."

This transfer, the dispatch says, took place off San Clemente Island, a few miles from the coast, instead of off San Diego Harbor."
1891-06-07T00:00:00Z,"PARIS, May 26. -- It cannot reasonably be expected that every one of the eight representations of M. Antoine at the Theatre Libre will bring forth a chef d'oeuvre. I think his best friends would scarcely recognize in ""Nell Horn,"" the five-act drama of M. Rosny, any interest further than the much-used Salvation Army incident, and this has long grown familiar to Parisians."
1891-06-07T00:00:00Z,"The ""Act to provide for ocean mail service between the United States and foreign ports and to promote commerce"" was approved March 3, 1891. Thus far the Postmaster General, so far as known, has entered into no contracts with American vessels for the transporting of the United States mails to foreign ports. The reasons are obvious after even a cursory consideration of the requirements contained in the act mentioned."
1891-06-07T00:00:00Z,"BOSTON, June 6. -- A largely attended meeting of the Alumni of Phillips Academy, Andover, was held at the Tremont to-day. Judge Robert R. Bishop was called to the chair. It appears that the Academy is in need of funds for the prosecution of certain improvements in several of the departments and for the enlargement of others. In fact, it needs to be re-endowed with about half a million dollars."
1891-06-07T00:00:00Z,"The unveiling of the statue to Mr. J.S.T. STRANAHAN in Prospect Park, which took place yesterday, called out sincere and well-deserved tributes to that gentleman. It is not usual to pay honor to a living man in this way, but there is ample reason for the exception in this case. In a very important sense Prospect Park is the work of Mr. STRANAHAN."
1891-06-07T00:00:00Z,"LOUISVILLE, Ky., June 6. -- Filed away in the office of the United States District Attorney for Kentucky, awaiting the decision of the United States Supreme Court, are five indictments against Banker Edward H. Horner of 88 Wall Street, New-York. Horner was the agent of several foreign lotteries. He sent circulars through the mails advertising his lotteries, and was caught up with."
1891-06-07T00:00:00Z,"It is seldom that a woman loses anything in the pocket of her own dress, but such a thing actually happened to a very clear-headed and methodical young woman whose residence is in Baltimore, but whose comings and goings encompass nearly every civilized quarter of the globe. Some time ago Mrs. C. missed her pocketbook, containing a considerable sum of money."
1891-06-07T00:00:00Z,"WEST POINT, June 6. -- Among the recommendations the Board of Visitors is likely to make in its report, which will be prepared next week, is one to double the number of cadets. Ever since the first meeting of the board this question has been discussed. Officers of the post agree that with their present facilities, 500 cadets could be cared for as comfortably as the present number -- 265."
1891-06-07T00:00:00Z,"DES MOINES, Iowa, June 6. -- The Attorney General has given an important opinion in regard to the anti-trust law of the last General Assembly.

1891-06-07T00:00:00Z,"The Corporation Counsel's office in Brooklyn so dislikes William J. Gaynor, merely because he won the Ziegler water case, that it was used on Friday to promulgate false statements about a decision of the Court of Appeals which, if they had been true, would have absolutely destroyed the value of $1,000,000 worth of bonds now held by individuals, estates, and trust companies."
1891-06-07T00:00:00Z,"Beginning with this sixth month of the year, upward of 500 meetings have already been arranged for the light-harness performers, a programme unparalleled in the history of the sport. The scores of nurseries in every State yield youthful aspirants for honors at the trotting or pacing gait in such profusion that tracks and trainers have multiplied proportionately to meet the demand and furnish engagements for the equine horde."
1891-06-07T00:00:00Z,"Capt. John Faunce, for fifty years connected with the Revenue Marine Service of the United States Government, died a his home, 67 Atlantic Street, Jersey City, Friday, in the eighty-fifth year of his age.

The assessment was sought to be vacated on the ground that Mr. Luckemeyer was indebted to the firm in the sum of $374,500."
1891-06-07T00:00:00Z,The determination of President LOW and the Trustees of Columbia College to place the Law School of that institution upon the basis of a university department has been the occasion for an unseemly amount of personal feeling and bitter discussion. It was a part of the general plan of broad development for the chief institution of higher education in this city and in the line of progress in its work.
1891-06-07T00:00:00Z,"The sixth annual Spring games of the cadets of St. Paul's Cathedral School, Garden City, L.I., were held yesterday afternoon. The attendance was larger than usual. The weather was beautiful for outdoor sports, and the events on the programme were interesting and well contested. Several school records were broken."
1891-06-07T00:00:00Z,"There are few places in Europe about which the world at large knows so little as the eastern portion of the Austro-Hungarian Empire, with its startling contrasts between the abject poverty of the peasantry on the one hand and on the other a wealth in which barbaric and medieval magnificence are often strangely blended with the quintessence of nineteenth-century civilization and refinement."
1891-06-07T00:00:00Z,"The market was well supplied during the earlier days of last week with strawberries of good variety and of good quality, but toward the close of the week they became scarcer, with the result of increasing prices, and large shipments of Western Maryland berries for the Saturday's market. Consequently, to-day the people of this city may eat at moderate cost some of the finest strawberries grown in America."
1891-06-07T00:00:00Z,"LONDON, June 6. -- Brandon Thomas and Weedon Grossmith, two extremely clever young actors, who will be remembered with Rosina Vokes in America six years ago, began to-night the novel experiment at Terry's Theatre of an entertainment comprising three distinct little comedies, timed for 8, 9, and 10 o'clock respectively, each written by one or the other, and presenting both in most characteristic roles."
1891-06-07T00:00:00Z,"With the opening of the outing season the attention of the philanthropic is once more called to the ""Little Mothers' Aid Society."" It is hardly more than a year old, but presents a record of wise and beneficent charity of the kind that pays, which any older society might well be proud to acknowledge. But its work is peculiar, reaching a class that is helped by no other charitable organization."
1891-06-07T00:00:00Z,"OTTAWA, June 6. -- Sir John Macdonald, Premier of the Dominion, died to-night at 10:15 o'clock. He never rallied from unconsciousness and passed quietly away. The bulletin sent out by the attendant physician, Dr. Powell, early this morning announced that there was no change worthy of comment to be discerned in his patient's condition, and that he had passed a night of heavy sleep."
1891-06-07T00:00:00Z,"In his annual report to the members of the Consolidated Stock and Petroleum Exchanged President Charles G. Wilson says that for the year ending May 30 the Exchange has prospered. In the department devoted to trading in railroad stocks the clearances of the transactions of the year aggregated 75,806,990 shares. The system of clearing is declared to be an unqualified success. In a prophetic vein Mr. Wilson says:"

Bradley, the New-York manufacturer, the founder and original owner of this famous prohibition resort, stirred up a hornets' nest at the last meeting of the Board of Borough Commissioners, of which he is the President, by announcing to his colleagues that he would not permit the electric lights to burn all night on his board walk and beach pavilions."

1891-06-07T00:00:00Z,"LONDON, June 6. -- These dispatches, having for years reflected a derisive attitude toward the British tendency to sit down and rest every few days, I hasten to say that for once the accustomed Saturday holiday comes as a genuine boon to mankind. Although we must take up our cross again next week, it is a great blessing to have even a single day's respite from the scandal of the baccarat trial."
1891-06-07T00:00:00Z,"KINGSTON, N.Y., June 6. -- The Rev. Octavius Applegate, Jr., of Newburg, who was recently ordained, has accepted the rectorship of St. John's Episcopal Church at Ellenville, Ulster County."

Some idea of the enormous tide of travel awaiting the new system may be deduced from the statistics of travel in the past."
1891-06-07T00:00:00Z,"NEW-ORLEANS, June 6. -- A curious case, involving a rich man's anxiety to arrange a marriage for his daughter and a lawyer's rascality, is on trial in the civil court here. It is the suit of A.L. Robelot against Anatole Brieugne and Aristide Gelpi."
1891-06-07T00:00:00Z,"BALTIMORE, June 6. -- Jacob Bonnett committed suicide in Druid Hill Park last Wednesday. He was the trusted financial agent of a great many confiding Germans, and was the controlling factor in various building associations. His character as a devoted church member and conservative citizen was well-established, and the fact of his self-destruction created general astonishment."
1891-06-07T00:00:00Z,"BUFFALO, N.Y., June 6. -- When Daniel N. Lockwood was elected to Congress last Fall, he announced himself a candidate for Speaker. Now Daniel N. Lockwood takes part in the Courier-Sheehan-Seheu row by announcing himself a conditional candidate for Governor."
1891-06-07T00:00:00Z,"BERLIN, June 6. -- If popular discontent were allowed to manifest itself on free lines against the Government's decision to maintain the corn duties, Germany would be ablaze with demonstrations. Since Chancellor von Caprivi surprised the country, including the agrarian party, with his declaration that the existing tariff must remain until, at least, new treaty negotiations with other nations were arranged, the dissatisfaction among workingmen has become exasperation."
1891-06-07T00:00:00Z,"Mayor Grant had his day's outing at Morris Park yesterday afternoon. ""Dick"" Croker, his political creator, was on hand to see that he enjoyed the sport. ""Ed"" Stokes was there to lend assistance in case any was needed in looking after the Mayor, and ex-Register John Reilly was there to take a hand in affairs if there should be any trouble among the politicians."

1891-06-07T00:00:00Z,"Concerning the purchase with the Chantrey bequest of Calderon's ""Saint Elizabeth of Hungary"" the severest things are said to the Royal Academicians. The Saturday Review likens the introduction of a naked Saint Elizabeth to the French pictures in which nudity is out of place because under the circumstances depicted it would be indecent for a woman to appear without her clothes."
1891-06-07T00:00:00Z,"ST. LOUIS, June 6. -- The cornerstone of the new City Hall, a structure that will cost a million and a half of dollars, was laid at 3 o'clock this afternoon under the auspices of the Masons.

1891-06-07T00:00:00Z,"The Mayor of Philadelphia has written to the President of the United States a personal and official letter which, we should say, must give to Mr. HARRISON food for much reflection. The author of the letter is a Republican, and, being a Philadelphia Republican at that, it is needless to say that he is incapable of writing anything that can disturb Mr. HARRISON'S peace of mind unless he be compelled."
1891-06-07T00:00:00Z,The Pastime Athletic Club held its fifteenth annual picnic and games at the Empire City Colosseum yesterday.

1891-06-07T00:00:00Z,"BALTIMORE, June 6. -- After the delay in the racing at Pimlico yesterday it cleared sufficiently to go on this afternoon, and all the classes but one were taken up and finished.

1891-06-07T00:00:00Z,"Just one game divides the New-York and Chicago Club for first place in the League race. This state of affairs was brought about yesterday, when the New-Yorks won their eighth successive game and Chicago was beaten by Brooklyn. The Giants have gained steadily on the Western aspirants for championship honors since their return home and the probabilities are that they will be in first place before long."
1891-06-07T00:00:00Z,"WASHINGTON, June 6. -- Mr. Cleveland's opponents are still trying to make capital out of the failure of the Kentucky Democratic Convention to pass a resolution indorsing the ex-President, and, if their organs are to be believed. Kentucky wants anybody but Cleveland for the Presidential candidate next year."
1891-06-07T00:00:00Z,"The Republican managers have been watching the progress of affairs in the Seventh Senatorial District during the past week with far more than ordinary interest. They see in the present condition of the Democratic forces in that district every indication that they can gain a State Senator there this year, and there is certainly a fair foundation for their hopes."
1891-06-07T00:00:00Z,"ALBANY, June 6. -- The Forest Commission has not yet begun suit against the Adirondack and St. Lawrence Railroad Company for trespass, although it is well known that the company's surveyors have cut down many trees on the State hatchery lands in Township 20, Franklin County. Under the law there would seem to be no reason to doubt that the company could be made to pay dearly for the damage it has already caused."
1891-06-07T00:00:00Z,"As June 20, the date of the New-London races, draws near, interest in the prowess of the six competing college crews increases day by day. Each boat has its admirers, and each man is making the most of the short time that remains to win for himself and his crew the merit of that admiration. Columbia is the first crew to reach New-London for preliminary practice."
1891-06-07T00:00:00Z,"The departure of Mr. PEARY'S party marks the practical beginning of a series of expeditions which during the present year and the next should greatly extend our knowledge of the arctic regions.

1891-06-07T00:00:00Z,"BOSTON, June 6. -- Hitherto the Methodist Episcopal Church has escaped from the turmoil which now so generally characterizes the ecclesiastical world. To be sure, it has had its controversy over the participation of women in its government, but that has simply caused division of sentiment on questions of polity and has not affected vital doctrines."
1891-06-07T00:00:00Z,"It will be safer and better for the Attorney General of the State to waste no time in getting promises from Dr. SEWARD WEBB or his representatives. The builders of railroads are notoriously among the most aggressive and enterprising of created beings. With them possession is nine points of the law, and they trust to the delays and uncertainties of the law itself for the other point."
1891-06-07T00:00:00Z,"PRINCETON, N.J., June 6. -- The largest crowd that has ever visited this classic town came to-day to witness one of the finest games of baseball ever played on the Princeton diamond.

1891-06-07T00:00:00Z,"CAMBRIDGE, Mass., June 6. -- Harvard rowing is in a very unsatisfactory condition just now, and things have begun again to look pretty gloomy for the crimson's crews.

Perkins that will prevent his rowing before the crew leaves for New-London to begin work on the Thames."
1891-06-07T00:00:00Z,"THOUSAND ISLAND PARK, N.Y., June 6. -- The season at the Thousand Islands may be said to have fairly begun. Already much activity is noticed along the river in preparation for what is expected to be one of the most successful seasons ever enjoyed. Much is expected from the more efficient train service of the Rome, Watertown and Ogdensburg Railroad under the management of the New-York Central."
1891-06-07T00:00:00Z,"WASHINGTON, June 6. -- The marriage of Miss Sophie Wilkins De Suzzara Verdi, daughter of Dr. Tullio Verdi, to Mr. Alfred Jerome Weston of New-York, took place this evening in St. Paul's Church. The Rev. Alfred Harding, rector, officiated."

1891-06-07T00:00:00Z,"Laurence Oliphant's name was not extensively known on this side the Atlantic. A book which perhaps might have made it so, ""The Tender Recollections of Irene Macgillicuddy,"" though written by him, was not issued at first under his name, and his books of travel had enjoyed much greater popularity in his own land than here."
1891-06-07T00:00:00Z,"When a yachting outfit first came to be a necessity in the Summer wardrobe, it was the correct thing to copy the rig of the jolly tar. Now seafaring young women look higher for a model, and turn themselves out as faultlessly gotten-up naval officers."
1891-06-07T00:00:00Z,"CHICAGO, June 6. -- The Summer season is close at hand, but the Summer season in Chicago is not the dull and unprofitable one that it is in many other cities. The best attractions are put on here during that period. A.M. Palmer's, Augustin Daly's, Daniel and Charles Frohman's companies play profitable engagements, and the annual spectacular extravaganza at the Chicago Opera House coins money for four months."

1891-06-07T00:00:00Z,"PHILADELPHIA, June 6. -- The consideration of the recommendations in connection with the constitution of the Federal Synod of the Reformed Church (Dutch) in America and the Reformed Church (German) in the United States which were adopted yesterday at the Synod of the latter body, now in progress at the First Reformed Church, was the special business for to-day's session."
1891-06-07T00:00:00Z,"A suit of more than usual interest was decided in the Supreme Court for Westchester County, at White Plains, last week, by Mr. Justice Barnard.

1891-06-07T00:00:00Z,"The mounted searchers went up the road along which Bell and I had come, and the sound of their excited voices could be heard long after the tramping of the horses' hoofs died out. After a short consultation we decided to stick to the road for the present. It certainly led northward, and the walking along it was preferable to blundering blindly through the woods and across half-cleared fields."
1891-06-07T00:00:00Z,"Among those who are to be guests of the Hotel Earlington at Richfield Springs the coming season are Commodore John S. Dickerson and family, Judge Rufus B. Cowing and family, Col. John R. Fellows, Mr. M.P. Breslin and family, Mr. W.H. Gelshenen and family, C.D. Pearce and family, and a long list of other New-York people who know the Earlington to be a good place to go to."
1891-06-07T00:00:00Z,"LENOX, Mass., June 6. -- New-York people have been coming up to Lenox in large numbers this week.

1891-06-08T00:00:00Z,This is the question all Canada is asking to-day. The death of the old chieftain removes the one barrier to the beginning of political changes of so far-reaching a character as to be of supreme importance to the Dominion and to interest in no slight degree both the United States and Great Britain.

1891-06-12T00:00:00Z,"ALBANY, June 11. -- The Court of Appeals, in denying the application for a reargument of the appeal in the murder case of the people against Jugiro, appellant, takes occasion to rebuke the overzealous counselors who have conducted it, and to read a warning to the legal fraternity in general. The opinion of the court is per curlam, and is in the form of a memorandum. It reads as follows:"
1891-06-12T00:00:00Z,"Four months ago the New-York Life Insurance Company issued a printed statement to its Spanish-American policy holders, signed by the Director General of that department, Joaquin Sanchez, stating that Julio Merzbacher, the company's Spanish-American agent, had retired from business because of ill health. Simultaneously with that announcement Merzbacher disappeared from the company's offices and from his apartments at 34 Wes Twenty-fifth Street, and his whereabouts since that time have been unknown."

Perkins of the New-York Tennis Club defeated the players from Princeton College, W.V. Johnson and W.H. Condict, in three straight sets. Johnson did the best work for Princeton, while Hobart played in fairly good form."
1891-06-12T00:00:00Z,"ALBANY, June 11. -- To-night the Governor, through his newspaper organ, indulges in what he terms ""pro-convention talk."" He starts off with the declaration that ""there is a strong probability, amounting almost to a certainty"" that the Democratic ticket will be successful, and then remarks that it is not to be wondered at that much speculation should have been indulged in as to who the Democratic candidate for that great office will be."
1891-06-12T00:00:00Z,"BALTIMORE, June 11. -- The exercises connected with the conferring of degrees at the close of the fifteenth academic year of the Johns Hopkins University were held this afternoon in Mount Vernon Place Methodist Episcopal Church. The candidates admitted to the degree of Bachelor of Arts were:"
1891-06-12T00:00:00Z,"Very few people either in or out of England can have anticipated the judgment of England upon the connection of the Prince of WALES with the Cumming case. Of all highly-civilized nations England is the one in which snobbery has struck the deepest roots. The feeling about titled persons among English snobs is by no means ""that generous loyalty to rank and sex"" which BURKE described as a chivalrous sentiment."
1891-06-12T00:00:00Z,"Gov. HILL'S organ at Albany appears to be trying to prepare the way for the acceptance of the third-term idea. At all events, it discusses the present Governor as among the possibilities as a candidate at the next election, and argues that the precedents are in favor of rather than against such a nomination."
1891-06-12T00:00:00Z,"WEST POINT, June 11. -- The line at dress parade was thin to-night. The cadets stood in single line formation. Behind the companies stood the members of the first class with side arms only. It was their last dress parade at West Point. To some it was the last parade to be seen here in many years. The ceremonies were different from those of other nights and were simple and impressive."
1891-06-12T00:00:00Z,"I read with much interest the communication from ""D"" in regard to the snakes seen in delirium tremens. ""D"" settles the matter for himself, and it is at least gratifying and comforting to see that he has analyzed his own sensations so well and that he states malaria to be the cause."
1891-06-13T00:00:00Z,"KINGSTON, N.Y., June 12. -- The Fourth Avenue Presbyterian Church of New-York City, since the death of Dr. Howard Crosby, has been without a pastor. The salary paid to the pastor has been $8,000. It has been rumored that the Rev. Dr. J.G. Van Slyke of this city has received an intimation that he might expect a call to fill the vacancy."
1891-06-13T00:00:00Z,"After a night's reflection the Vice Presidents of the New-York Life Insurance Company, who, in the absence of President Beers, are in charge of the company's affairs, decided that it would be best to make public a statement of the amount of Julio Merzbacher's defalcation, the story of which was told exclusively in THE TIMES yesterday."
1891-06-13T00:00:00Z,"The Alumni Association of the University of New-York held an important meeting last evening at the University Building, Washington Square. The business of greatest interest transacted was the nomination of an alumnus to be a member of the University Council. This was the first time that this privilege had been accorded the Alumni Association."
1891-06-13T00:00:00Z,"A fish story that is a fish story was told yesterday by Pilot Keely, who brought in the steamship Caledonia, and the tale is corroborated by officers of that vessel. Many instances are recorded where ships have come to grief by collision with the monarchs of the deep, but it remained for the little pilot boat Actaea to reverse the ordinary current of events and kill a whale by a blow from her knife-like prow."
1891-06-13T00:00:00Z,"NEW-HAVEN, June 12. -- The Yale crew went to New-London this afternoon for the final practice on the Thames before the race with Harvard. The new launch went in the morning and the shells were sent on the steamer Ivernia."
1891-06-13T00:00:00Z,""" Bouncer"" Greenhlage of Massachusetts has been telling people down his way that the ""stimulus of defeat is a grand good thing for a party."" It is difficult to see in what way his party has profited by the defeat administered to it last Fall, but the next dose may produce the remedial effect which Mr. Greenhalge admits the Republican organization stands in need of."
1891-06-13T00:00:00Z,"CHARLESTON, S.C., June 12. -- A strange and interesting story comes from Lancaster County, S.C., and is well vouched for. When Sherman's army was passing through central South Carolina on his memorable march to the sea, the officers of the Bank of Camden collected all the cash and jewelry deposits in its vaults and carried them to a place near Hanging Rock, in Lancaster, to bury them, for fear they would be confiscated."
1891-06-13T00:00:00Z,"The proposal largely to increase the number of cadets at West Point, while it has been under consideration for some time, undoubtedly derives a special stimulus just now from the fact that many young men from civil life are to be appointed to vacancies in the army this year. Still, as we have already pointed out, this is too exceptional an occurrence to base an annual increase in the membership of the Military Academy upon."
1891-06-13T00:00:00Z,"The attractiveness of the Central Park ""Zoo"" was unexpectedly increased yesterday afternoon by the arrival of twenty-three full-grown sea lions and an infant sea lion from the southern coast of California. They are the property of Capt. I.R. Mullett, who for years past has furnished zoological gardens and menageries with live animals, but they are held by the New-York Central and Hudson River Railroad Company."

1891-06-13T00:00:00Z,"At its meeting on Tuesday the Board of Aldermen made a considerable show of public spirit and instructed its Railroad Committee to report on Tuesday next the resolution denouncing the occupation of Battery Park by the elevated railroad. Yesterday the committee met and retired into an ""executive session,"" and when it emerged to the light it appeared that a public hearing upon the resolution had been decided upon for Tuesday afternoon at 3 o'clock."
1891-06-13T00:00:00Z,"It is not surprising that an attempt to prosecute DE LESSEPS should now be made in France by some of the Panama shareholders and bondholders who were induced by him to throw away their money, but it is scarcely probable that he will be brought to account. Many persons living beyond the sphere of his influence, in America or elsewhere, do not understand how he was able to avoid prosecution some years ago."
1891-06-13T00:00:00Z,"The First Battalion of State Naval Militia held its final drill for the season on board the United States frigate Minnesota, at the foot of West Fiftieth Street, last night.

1891-06-13T00:00:00Z,"LONDON, June 12. -- Dispatches from Shanghai announce fresh excesses upon the part of the anti-European element in the population of China.

1891-06-13T00:00:00Z,"Potomac, having pulled up lame in his work, will not go to Chicago to run for the American Derby, Strathmeath and Pessara will be sent on, however, to try conclusions with Kingman. Mr. Dwyer will send Kingston on if the proposed race at a mile and an eighth, with $5,000 added, is made up."
1891-06-13T00:00:00Z,"PHILADELPHIA, June 12. -- The deeper the expert accountants probe into the affairs of ex-City Treasurer Bardsley the more apparent the rascalities of the man become, and the enormous sums which he made away with are daily added to. Yesterday the accountants reported to Mayor Stuart that they had discovered a grave discrepancy in Bardsley's accounts with the State. To-day they presented Mayor Stuart with the following statement:"
1891-06-13T00:00:00Z,The suppression of competition in an industry tends to retard or check the development of it by the use of improvements. When the history of the Harrow Trust was disclosed in court a few weeks ago it was shown that the twenty manufacturers had bound themselves not to make use of new inventions for a long term of years.
1891-06-13T00:00:00Z,"LONDON, June 12. -- The official London Gazette this evening announces, under date of June 10, that the name of Sir William Gordon Cumming has been removed from the list of officers in the army, as her Majesty has no further occasion for his services."

Wilson, a Republican politician of Indiana, declared that Judge Gresham would be a candidate for the Presidential nomination in 1892. ""The Judge is not doing any brass band work,"" said Mr. Wilson, ""but he is quietly feeling his ground. We have it from pretty good sources that he could have the Illinois delegation."
1891-06-13T00:00:00Z,"SAUGERTIES, N.Y., June 12. -- Again the protectionists have defaulted when challenged to debate the tariff question publicly, this time in Ulster County at the meetings arranged by the Reform Club of New-York City. They responded to the challenges of the club last week for six meetings in Southern Ulster by sending Gen. George A. Sheridan to meet Congressman John De Witt Warner."
1891-06-13T00:00:00Z,"The coming test of ship armor, which is to take place on the new naval ordnance proving grounds at Indian Head, will be of great interest and importance in several ways. In the first place, it will be a trial of American-made guns, plates, and projectiles, thereby differing from the famous competition of last September, where all the armor and all the shells were foreign."
1891-06-13T00:00:00Z,It was a serious set-back for the public credit of the city of Brooklyn to receive no bids for the proposed issue of 3 per cent. bonds for the extension of the bridge terminus and for the development of Ridgewood Park. Bonds of this city bearing only 2 1/2 per cent. have been sold at par. and Brooklyn 3 per cents have heretofore been taken at 6 to 8.64 per cent. premium.
1891-06-13T00:00:00Z,"OTTAWA, June 12. -- Everything indicates that Sir John Thompson, Minister of Justice in the late Ministry, will succeed Sir John Macdonald as Premier of Canada. Although the Conservative members are divided in their allegiance, Lord Stanley's choice will not result in any split in the party. A feeling now prevails that the future will be imperiled if all personal ambitions and local demands are to be satisfied."
1891-06-13T00:00:00Z,"As the fishing season advances two reports come in. From the fresh-water resorts good luck is mostly the word. From the salt-water headquarters of information the word is not so encouraging as to game fish. The more common varieties, such as the flounder, blackfish, and sea bass, are apparently as plenty as in former seasons."
1891-06-13T00:00:00Z,"One result of the fraudulent methods displayed in attempting to foist the property of the Long Island Water Supply Company upon the taxpayers of the city of Brooklyn was seen yesterday when Mayor Chapin and Controller Jackson failed to obtain a single bid in answer to advertisements offering $800,000 worth of gilt-edged 3 per cent. bonds for sale."

The piece made a decided hit. One of the most remarkable scenes ever shown on any stage is the shipwreck, where a full-sized ship is made to disappear beneath the waves. Fred Dangerfield designed the scenery."
1891-06-13T00:00:00Z,"St. John's Guild is about to begin its beneficent midsummer hospital work and makes its annual appeal for funds to maintain and increase that work. Its general character is well known to the charitable people of this city. A thousand or more of sick children with their mothers are taken down the bay on the floating hospital to get the benefit of sea air, good food, and medical attendance for one day."
1891-06-13T00:00:00Z,"JOHN WANAMAKER'S written history of his relations with the Keystone Bank is a good thing to keep on file. The looting of the bank is still under investigation. There will be, quite likely, further exposures and further arrests. BARDSLEY, the Treasurer of Philadelphia, is too insignificant a scapegoat for all the sins that are to be expiated in his person."
1891-06-13T00:00:00Z,"Advices from Albany are conclusively to the effect that the recent query in the Eagle, Will Albany County become a Hill asset? will have to be answered in the negative. The answer grows out of the past facts in politics there and of the unchanged honesty and firmness of character of the Democratic leaders of that Democratic community."
1891-06-13T00:00:00Z,"Some of those who have for months suffered from the wretched service of the Brooklyn Bridge hope that the new management will give them some relief. Those who are obliged to cross the bridge during the early hours of the morning, after 1 o'clock, are pretty certain that benefit of some sort must accrue not only to New-Yorkers but to Brooklynites as well, as a result of Mayor Grant's capture of the bridge."
1891-06-13T00:00:00Z,"PITTSBURG, Penn., June 12. -- The patients of Father Mollinger, the priest-physician, are now counted by thousands. The priest made a statement from the steps of the Troy Hill schoolhouse to-day. He said no preference would be shown any one. Rich and poor were equal in his eye, as they were in the sight of the Creator."
1891-06-13T00:00:00Z,"PITTSBURG, Penn., June 12. -- James B. Scott Co. import more tinned plate than any other firm in Pittsburg. The members of the firm are ""McKinley Republicans to the backbone."" It is a little surprising, therefore, to hear a wail from them about the outlook for that industry in this country. B.F. Jennings of the West Penn Steel Works is a tin-plate enthusiast. In an interview yesterday he said:"
1891-06-13T00:00:00Z,"An apparently innocent little motion, made before Judge Lacombe, in the United States Circuit Court yesterday, caused the scandal that has arisen from the Stewart millions, ever since the distribution of them came before the courts, to burst forth with renewed vigor. The action was taken by ex-Judge Horace Russell, counsel for Henry Hilton and Charles J. Clinch, as executors of the will of Cornelia M. Stewart."

1891-06-14T00:00:00Z,"The Massachusetts Legislature, which has just adjourned after being in session nearly half the year, prepared the way for an interesting experiment in the direction of what in Boston they call ""nationalism,"" or, at least, a local application of the same principle. A law was passed authorizing cities and towns to supply gas or electric light for public and private use, if their people desire to adopt that policy."
1891-06-14T00:00:00Z,"OTTAWA, Ontario, June 13. -- All speculation as to Sir John Macdonald's successor has been disposed of. The Hon. J.J.C. Abbott, a member the late Ministry without portfolio and Goverment leader, is now engaged in the task of forming a Ministry.

1891-06-14T00:00:00Z,"Chicago is going to have the World's Fair, but the New-York Giants are using all their endeavors to prevent Cook County from securing the baseball championship. With that purpose in view they whipped Anson's Colts yesterday, and are now two games ahead of the Western cracks. By long odds the largest crowd that ever witnessed a contest on the diamond field saw the game."
1891-06-14T00:00:00Z,"NEW BRUNSWICK, June 13. -- It is singular that all the prizes open to Rutgers Senior and Junior Classes were captured by '92. It has just been announced that the prize in Roman Law has been awarded to Harry K. Davis of Hagaman's Mills, N.Y."
1891-06-14T00:00:00Z,"The story of Julio Merzbacher and of his enormous thefts from the New-York Life Insurance Company grows more interesting as new facts and fresh irregularities are brought to light. The statement made in yesterday's TIMES that the amount of Merzbacher's defalcation would exceed half a million dollars and approach a million is a statement of fact, susceptible of proof."
1891-06-14T00:00:00Z,"ST. LOUIS, June 13. -- Senator George G. Vest this evening talked most interestingly with THE TIME'S correspondent on national politics. He was asked what he thought of Cleveland, and replied:"
1891-06-14T00:00:00Z,"By far the most successful real-estate season for years in the New-York market is about to close for the Summer vacation. There was never a time when so many persons were interested in real estate as buyers in the market as there have been in the last three months, nor was there ever a time when so many dealers devoted their attention to suburban property."
1891-06-14T00:00:00Z,"SARATOGA, June 13. -- The weather here has been on its good behavior since the opening of the spring buds. Although the days are warm the air is clear and dry. The altitude of this village, the bracing atmosphere, sand plains, and mineral springs lengthen life. Statistics show that there are nearly 500 persons in Saratoga Country over eighty years of age."
1891-06-14T00:00:00Z,"PHILADELPHIA, Penn., June 13. -- H.H. Yard, the friend of Gideon Marsh, the fugitive President of the Keystone Bank, is still in Trenton awaiting requisition from the Governor. District Attorney Graham is actively engaged, however, in preparing the necessary formalities, and Yard will soon be a prisoner in this city."
1891-06-14T00:00:00Z,"June has come in the country, and even to the inhabitants of the city wilderness of brick and mortar she contrives to tell something of her story. The vines on churches and houses are in tender, luxuriant leaf, and in many of the tiny courts which metropolitans call yards clambering rose vines, thick with blossoms, relieve the glaring fences and impart a refreshing floral touch to the limited landscape."
1891-06-14T00:00:00Z,"The five Judges whom President Harrison has just appointed to constitute the Court of Private Land Claims will find a large budget of business on their desks as soon as they have qualified, officials from Washington recently in this city say."
1891-06-14T00:00:00Z,"The imported French stallion Aerolithe was skipped to Col. Scott's Erie stock farm yesterday, where he will take the place of Rayon d'Or in the stan. He was secured by Tattersail's of New-York for Col. Scott. The same gentleman's French filly Rostmond is to be bred to the Duchess of Montford's famous stallion Barcaldine, sire of the famous English horses Mimi and Morton, winners of the recent classical races Epsom and Ascot."
1891-06-14T00:00:00Z,"In the course of the coming week the relative merits of the much-discussed forty-six-foot yachts ought to be pretty well settled. Tuesday the Atlantic Yacht Club will start the Summer's fun between the new candidates for honors. The Nautilus, Mineola, Uvira, Sayonara, Gloriana, and Jessica have been entered, and others will doubtless be on hand when the preparatory gun is fired at 10:30 A.M."
1891-06-14T00:00:00Z,"In April, 1492, while Columbus was making arrangements for his first voyage, a patent was prepared and signed by Ferdinand and Isabella granting to Columbus powers extraordinary and supreme over all lands met with in his travels. The terms of this patent were as follows:"
1891-06-14T00:00:00Z,"I never met Gen. Taylor until after his inauguration as President. The following Winter I received a letter from Major W.W.S.

He entered West Point and was graduated with the highest honors."
1891-06-14T00:00:00Z,"Now that President WAGSTAFF of the bridge promises to study the problem of better accommodation for late travel, there is another point of interest to those who use the bridge cars at night that we should like to see him take up. It is the special kindness that seems reserved by the train hands and guards for drunken loafers, and those not always men at that."
1891-06-14T00:00:00Z,"MONTPELIER, Vt., June 13. -- The farmers of Vermont are not so eager to get the bounty on maple sugar as it was represented they would be. There was a good deal of eloquence expended in telling what a big thing the bounty would be for them, but it looks now as if all this eloquence was wasted. As far as appearances go the farmers are indifferent about the bounty."
1891-06-14T00:00:00Z,"There has been a strange disposition shown by the officers of the New-York Life Insurance Company to treat the Merzbacher defalcation as a mere business incident, and not a very serious one at that, inasmuch as they think it will involve no permanent loss to the company, instead of regarding it as a crime in which the public has a higher concern than any one who may have suffered a mere pecuniary damage."
1891-06-14T00:00:00Z,"WASHINGTON, June 13. -- President Harrison's adherents here have read, with more interest than they will confess, the story about the anti-Harrison Republican Conference, held Thursday night in Indianapolis. They profess to be not at all disturbed about it, but those who know something about the political situation in Indiana do not really regard the meeting as the unimportant thing they call it."
1891-06-14T00:00:00Z,"NORWICH, June 13. -- The following programme of exercises has been arranged by the Connecticut Society of Sons of the American Revolution for ""Brother Jonathan Day"" at Lebanon Green next Monday, when the restored War Office of Jonathan Trumbull, Connecticut's Revolutionary War Governor, is to be formally presented to that society:"
1891-06-14T00:00:00Z,"BETHLEHEM, Penn., June 13. -- About June 1 the '92 Epitome, Lehigh's annual, made its appearance. It is the finest number that has yet been published. Some of the more notable features of the book are fine views of the campus and buildings, a photograph of Dr. Chandler, with short sketch of his career, and the several fraternity cuts."

1891-06-14T00:00:00Z,"Mrs. Orr begins this memoir of Robert Browning with a refutation of a story, current in his lifetime and revived after his death, that Jewish blood coursed in his veins, active support of which was obtained from his known interest in the Hebrew language and literature and his friendship for many members of the London Jewish community. Browning's paternal stock was all Anglo-Saxon."
1891-06-14T00:00:00Z,"HARTFORD, June 13. -- A session of the Senate will be held here on Monday, when the report of the Committee on Appropriations and Expenditures will be made. Senator Seymour of Norwalk is at the head of the committee. From present appearances the report will not open the way for removal of the financial difficulties in the State departments that will arise on the 1st of July."
1891-06-14T00:00:00Z,"BOSTON, June 13. -- The eyes of the thoughtful have been turned toward Andover Seminary this week, for it was natural to expect that the Commencement exercises of an institution which some now believe, and many in the past have believed, to be heretical would furnish material for comparison with the deliverances of the recent Presbyterian General Assembly at Detroit and of the professors and Directors of Union Seminary in New-York."
1891-06-14T00:00:00Z,It is a wonder that anglers of modest means have not been made insane by the bewildering display of pretty things that are now sold in the tackle stores. It requires a will strong and immovable to abstain from absolute bankruptcy upon visiting such stores. The object of the tackle man seems to be to dazzle and bewilder by an artistic arrangement of the various bits of tackle necessary and ornamental.
1891-06-14T00:00:00Z,"BALTIMORE, June 13. -- The new Revenue Marine steamer Galveston will be ready for an official trial, it is expected, in the course of the coming month. The Galveston is the handsomest revenue cutter yet designed for the Government. In general appearance she resembles a fast torpedo gunboat cruiser. She is 195 feet in length, with lines as clean as a racehorse, high freeboard, without a break from the bow to the stern."
1891-06-14T00:00:00Z,"KINGSTON, N.Y., June 13. -- The hot weather of the first part of the week caused many people to leave the hot cities and flee to the cooling breezes of the Catskills.

1891-06-14T00:00:00Z,"What this baseball year has still in store nobody ventures to predict, but it can hardly furnish another such scene as yesterday's, when enormous shouting throngs gathered on the two grounds side by side at One Hundred and Fifty-fifth Street, and for more than three hours paid tribute with flags, horns, whistles, and human throat power to the fascination of the sport."

1891-06-14T00:00:00Z,"SEATTLE, Washington, June 13. -- There is much exploring going on in Alaska and the Northwest, and the Government of British Columbia is doing its full share. A.L.

The organization which first occupied the camp -- which, under the able administration of Adjt. Gen. Josiah Porter, has become the military post of the State of New-York -- was the Twenty-third Regiment."
1891-06-14T00:00:00Z,"The only feature which at the present time appears at all likely to elevate proceedings at the State Camp of Instruction the current season, which begun yesterday, out of the ordinary prosaic rut, is the attention to be given to instructing in signaling the rank and file of the organizations of the National Guard ordered to Peekskill."

1891-06-14T00:00:00Z,"LONDON, June 13. -- The Sullivan interest, not to say clique, offended because Augustus Harris did not choose Sir Arthur to compose the music for ""Kenilworth,"" has been mollified by the fact that the Queen has ""commanded"" that the ""Golden Legend"" be performed at the Royal Albert Hall on July 9 at a concert to be given in honor of the visit of Emperor William of Germany to England."
1891-06-14T00:00:00Z,"A new club must be added to the already long and constantly-growing list of New-York clubs, the new-comer being known as the Patria Club.

The last month has been given over to examinations, and during that period the sound of the ""grinding"" has been low within fair Harvard's walls. Ninety-one's class day bids fair to be a most successful one, and its coming gives interest to a brief description of the development at Harvard of this important event in college life."

One week sees two large exhibitions and a host of smaller shows open; the next has hardly a roomful of pictures at an art dealer's. The sudden heats of June discourage even the latter, and he retires into the country for rest and recreation or takes steamer for the other side."
1891-06-14T00:00:00Z,"Street costumes in which gay colors predominate never can be in the best taste, but they have become so common as no longer to attract special attention. Promenade toilets which once would have subjected their wearers to unpleasant comment are worn without criticism, their conspicuous character only serving to invite attention to their beauty of coloring, perfection of fit, general air of elegance, or whatever may be the peculiar characteristic."
1891-06-14T00:00:00Z,"LONDON, June 13. -- Nothing has happened during the week to depose baccarat from its proud place as the leading issue in the minds of the British public. Although these dispatches from the beginning have laid stress upon the inevitable political and social consequences to the Prince of Wales as the most important thing about the whole case, these consequences are already far graver and wider in scope than could have been anticipated."
1891-06-14T00:00:00Z,"Sir JOHN'S personal popularity and his adroitness enabled him to retain his hold of power in the face of charges of corruption that would have been fatal to a weaker man, and the factions that he bound together in not always very harmonious co-operation for the support of his Government, under a leader less feared if not less respected, will be likely to develop an awkward and disruptive habit of quarreling."
1891-06-14T00:00:00Z,"The one particular reason why so many politicians believe that Mayor Chapin knew all about the impending revolution in bridge affairs and yet staid away from that important meeting is that the youthful Mayor has never been very deeply in love with Howell and his method of conducting business.

1891-06-15T00:00:00Z,"Mr. Saintsbury has taken the lesser lights in English literature between the two dates mentioned in his title, though the term ""lesser"" ought not to be used without a due consideration of its value.

There is no special organization yet, but everybody is waiting for it eagerly, and, without a set programme or any out-and-dried action laid out, it may be fairly expected that the people will be heard from.

1891-07-04T00:00:00Z,"The evidence seems to be conclusive that the appalling collision at Ravenna yesterday morning was due to the gross carelessness of those whose duty it was to guard and protect the passengers on the vestibule train. Two trains on the same road were on their way to this city from the West. The leading train was a vestibule express of eight cars, and a fast-freight train of twenty-four loaded cars was following it."

Although it may be best described as dashing, it is worn by young and old, well-preserved and faded, with equal assurance.

1891-07-05T00:00:00Z,"The proposal to increase the authorized limit of the enlisted force of the navy from 8,250 to 10,000 men is certainly not extravagant or uncalled for.

LOUIS, July 4. -- The Chronicle of this city has felt the Missouri editors on their preference for Presidential candidates, and the responses show that Grover Cleveland and James G.

The elevated railway people, balked in their endeavor to annex the best part of Broadway and the whole of the Boulevard, throw cold water on the electric underground scheme whenever it is discussed, and curiously they are backed up by one or two of the daily papers."

SCHROEDER, ex-Mayor of Brooklyn, that gentleman defines his position with regard to the State policy of his party and the next nomination for Governor. He plainly says that if he is to be a candidate there must be a great change in the conduct of the party on the liquor question, and as he expects no such change he is not bothering his mind with the nomination."

1891-07-07T00:00:00Z,"Kaiser WILHELM saw the lads of Eton yesterday parading not as students but as soldiers, and was well pleased with their drill and martial bearing.

1891-07-08T00:00:00Z,"The request for Bank Examiner DREW'S resignation on account of alleged infirmity of memory seems to be causing a good deal of surmise in Washington. In reporting on the condition of the Keystone National Bank in January, Mr. DREW made its assets and liabilities exactly balance and showed it to be in an apparently solvent condition, when he had, in fact, omitted the tidy sum of $544,851.46 from the list of its liabilities."

1891-07-11T00:00:00Z,"Yesterday came and went with no more denials from President Beers of the New-York Life Insurance Company, and those of his friends who so earnestly scouted the story of his having speculated in Wall Street are beginning to think that there was some truth in the statement after all. If there was no truth in it, would not President Beers have hastened to deny it long ago?"
1891-07-11T00:00:00Z,"CLEVELAND, July 10. -- Brooklyn lost a game here by 1 run to-day. Lovett was unsteady and was hit hard at times, while Gruber pitched first-class ball. The visitors indulged in some poor base running in the eighth inning, when they had a chance to win."
1891-07-11T00:00:00Z,"The closing of nearly threescore lobster canning establishments on the French shore of Newfoundland by the British naval commander will naturally be a trying experience for that region, especially as about a thousand fishermen and other persons are thrown out of employment. But this result has, of course, all along been expected, since it was only necessary to await the formal issue of authority for the purpose under the recent colonial legislation."
1891-07-11T00:00:00Z,"SHANGHAI, China, June 11. -- The organized Chinese mob which, June 8, destroyed the Roman Catholic mission establishment and killed two foreigners at Wusieh, a large city on the Grand Canal, 100 miles from this place, is rapidly growing in numbers and is slowly making its way toward this city, taking in, on its line of march, all the foreign settlements along the Yang-tse-Kiang River."
1891-07-11T00:00:00Z,The chief source of popular discontent in this country for years has been the growth of corporate power and its defiance of public authority and popular rights. It is this more than anything else that has produced the various movements intended to effect radical changes in legislation and disturb the existing order of things.
1891-07-11T00:00:00Z,"CHICAGO, July 10. -- Workmen are engaged putting in the foundations for several World's Fair buildings at Jackson Park, and the work of construction will be pushed energetically from now on. The Illinois Central Railroad and the Directors have come to terms on the switching charges. The Central folks consented to reduce their charges 25 per cent. on what is designated by them as local business, as distinguished from switching business."
1891-07-11T00:00:00Z,"OTTAWA, July 10. -- The Parliamentary inquiry into the charges of corruption made against Sir Hector Langevin, Minister of Public Works, is the sensation here. Thus far several public officials have been implicated, but no further proof has been brought against Sir Hector except the testimony of Owen E. Murphy, the self-confessed briber, who admitted that he absconded from New-York."
1891-07-11T00:00:00Z,"The spirit and devotion cannot be too highly praised of those Hebrews of New-York who, ever since the movement for the expulsion of Jews from Russia began, have endeavored to take care of their exiled coreligionists who arrived at this port. Their efforts have been wonderfully successful."
1891-07-12T00:00:00Z,"Two weeks ago we published a dispatch concerning the pitiable condition of the Rev. FREDERICK L. STEVENS, who had suddenly become demented. Mr. STEVENS is a graduate of the Yale Theological Seminary. After completing his course in that institution he prolonged his studies in Europe. Upon his return from Germany, one year ago, he decided to pursue his work for a time in the graduate department of the university."
1891-07-12T00:00:00Z,"I believe that it is nonsense to talk or suggest the name of any man except Grover Cleveland for the Democratic candidate in 1892. His defeat in 1888 was the result of treachery and rum. I deem him more available than ever. He will carry this State and be chosen without question. He is a statesman and an independent, liberal gentleman."
1891-07-12T00:00:00Z,"When Col. Daniel S. Lamont lifted the function of private secretary almost to the dignity and importance of a Cabinet officer during President Cleveland's Administration, he disclosed new possibilities to humbler private secretaries, and awakened in the public mind a more exalted conception of the character and scope of a private secretary."
1891-07-12T00:00:00Z,"ELIZABETH, N.J., July 11. -- Herman Bohme was arrested here Thursday night, and Friday was arraigned in the police court for trying to kidnap his own child.

1891-07-12T00:00:00Z,"ALEXANDRIA BAY, N.Y., July 11. -- With an atmosphere suggesting arctic rigor and a humidity desolate and drear, the early part of the past week did not offer conditions favorable to the full enjoyment of island attractions. But this inclemency has given way to sunny skies and welcome weather, and the change has brought about a vast increase in the population of the Thousand Isles."
1891-07-12T00:00:00Z,"NEWARK, N.J., July 11. -- Frederick Hawkins, the muscular sculler of the Manhattan Athletic Club, is still the champion amateur oarsman of the country. For a week past there has been a difference of opinion on that subject. Last Saturday Hawkins was beaten at the People's Regatta on the Schuylkill, and for a week the Philadelphians boasted of having the premier sculler in the person of Edwin Hedley, a new member of the Vesper Club."
1891-07-12T00:00:00Z,"A handsome new astronomical clock has just been constructed by Tiffany Co. of this city for the Union League Club of Philadelphia. Every year the Art Association of the club is accustomed to make a gift to the club, either of a work of art or some decorative work for the clubhouse. This year it was decided to present a cloak and one that would be a credit to the club."
1891-07-12T00:00:00Z,"BALTIMORE, July 11. -- If the Democratic State Convention were held next week Frank Brown would get at least three-fourths of its votes for the Gubernatorial nomination. Many of the county delegations have not yet been elected, but so strong is the apparent sentiment in his favor that nothing could defeat him."
1891-07-12T00:00:00Z,"DELAWARE WATER GAP, Penn., July 11. -- Merry parties, riding, driving, or bicycling, have been passing all the week. Members of a dozen bicycle clubs have made headquarters of the Kittatinny House. The members of the Brooklyn Canoe Club were registered over Sunday. Their canoes were launched at Milford, bound for the Lower Delaware. Outing is in full play."
1891-07-12T00:00:00Z,"The poetical proclamation of Lamartine affirmed that the French Republic was for peace and not to make war against other forms of government elsewhere; but it was not its armed interference that the courts of Europe had to fear. Its army was in Algiers, its improvised Government had no experience of public affairs. It was its example that was dangerous."
1891-07-12T00:00:00Z,"New-York as a Summer resort has won another champion in Lloyd I. Seaman. All through the Spring he and his family were planning to have a restful Summer in the country. They wanted a place not too far distant to keep Mr. Seaman from business and yet removed from city sights and sounds. A house at Greenwich, Conn., hit their fancy as about the thing needed, after looking about somewhat."

He stopped often, looked up and down in a bewildered way, and talked and gesticulated, ending each tirade with a burst of tears."
1891-07-12T00:00:00Z,"SCRANTON, Penn., July 11. -- The political event of the year in Pennsylvania will be the fight for a Constitutional Convention in behalf of ballot reform. The Legislature, at its recent session, passed an act-giving the people of the State the right to vote for or against a Constitutional Convention at the next election, and at the same time to elect delegates who will serve in case the convention should be held."

1891-07-12T00:00:00Z,"Since the days of the Puritans church music in this country has undergone a radical change. For the first two centuries in New-England psalmody was the only form in which music existed. Metrical psalmody originated with the Reformation. It was first used by Luther in the year 1517. Knowing the power of music over the feelings, he used it to band together his followers and inspire them with his own zeal."
1891-07-12T00:00:00Z,"It was at the time when Mexico, in its impatience of rulers under ordinary designations, was consenting to be more or less controlled by a military official whom the public knew as the Governor, and by a subordinate, a privileged jidus Achates known to the people as the Lieutenant. It was also the year in Mexico when the fashion in sombreros was in the direction of the lowest crowns."

1891-07-12T00:00:00Z,"It was said when there were Kings that women, Kings, and thieves are at home everywhere, and now Academicians may take the place of Kings in the adage, for only an Academician would have had the faith in himself or the fatuity to write of Mme. de la Fayette after Sainte-Beuve and Taine and not failed."
1891-07-12T00:00:00Z,"Before the racing at Morris Park yesterday, Col. S.D. Bruce sold the Woodburn thoroughbred yearlings at auction, securing for the thirty-five animals sold a total of $39,275, an average of $1,122. They were as fine a lot as has been seen in the East this year, and the competition for their possession was lively. The breeding of the youngsters and their purchasers are as follows:"
1891-07-12T00:00:00Z,"BAR HARBOR, July 11 -- There has been large increase of Summer population hero since last week. All the regular cottagers that are coming have come, save two or three prominent ones still lingering in Europe. Whose who are not coming have rented their places, and few desirable homes remain untenanted. The shopkeepers continue jubilant over the good business that continues, and the cooks are kept busy catering."

1891-07-12T00:00:00Z,"HARTFORD, July 11. -- Editor Porter's answer to Judge Harrison's charges against him of political dishonesty is still under advisement. The Judge's charges were so clear and explicit and so capable of refutation, if false, that Republicans here not blinded by partisanship are astounded that two days have been allowed to pass without a reply from the man who is accused of the most disreputable of political offenses."
1891-07-12T00:00:00Z,"BERLIN, July 11. -- The papers of this city overflow with accounts of the popular triumph of Emperor William in London. The semi-official papers, in commenting on the reception, adopt a remarkably guarded tone, and avoid all reference to an alliance with England as an accomplished fact. These papers simply re-echo the Emperor's speech at Guildhall."
1891-07-12T00:00:00Z,"Horace Greeley, who used to make stump speeches in this region, always said Pike County was ""noted for its Democrats, rattlesnakes, and bad whisky."" Things have changed since Horace's day, and while some Democrats and ""rattlers"" still remain, plenty of Republicans can be found here, and the whisky one gets in this well-provisioned clubhouse is as good as one could wish for."

1891-07-12T00:00:00Z,"Science has dealt a good many blows to art and literature, but during recent years science has made the life of painters miserable by casting doubts on the immortality of pictures. It has become a nightmare to artists, this fear lest the pigments with which they prepare their paintings shall suffer some internal change and alter their colors to the point of a complete ruin of the picture."
1891-07-12T00:00:00Z,"PROVIDENCE, R.I., July 11. -- The commission to revise the judiciary system and the public laws will be ready to report, in regard to the former only, at the coming session this month of the General Assembly.

1891-07-12T00:00:00Z,"The third annual regatta of the Riverside Yacht Club, off the clubhouse at Cos Cob Harbor, Conn., was a marked success yesterday. There were twenty-seven starters in the race, twenty-five of which, at least, stuck it out to the end and came across the finish line in good shape. Had the day opened with a little more wind there would have been still more contestants."
1891-07-12T00:00:00Z,"PEEKSKILL, N.Y., July 11. -- The camp of the Seventy-first is over and the regiment has made a record for itself.

1891-07-12T00:00:00Z,"Kindly permit me to say a few words through your columns relative to the recent disturbances connected with the Moqui Indian village of Oreibi, apropos of the excellent editorial on the subject in to-day's TIMES."
1891-07-12T00:00:00Z,"The orders directing Lieut. GODFREY H. MACDONALD to organize at Fort Bennett a troop of Indian cavalry, made up with the band of Chief HUMP as a nucleus, give a suggestive idea of some of the objects and advantages of the new policy on this subject, HUMP was one of the leading disaffected Sioux last Winter and was believed to have had a great influence in keeping up the troubles."

1891-07-12T00:00:00Z,"The recently published Canadian documents touching reciprocity leave the case almost exactly where it was before. It is evident that Mr. BLAINE did not commit himself or our Government to anything whatever, and he seems to have been in the right in his complaint that it should have been alleged or believed in Canada that our Government was responsible for the failure to carry on negotiations looking to reciprocity with Canada."
1891-07-12T00:00:00Z,"PARIS, June 30. -- The fashion news being very slight in spite of the elaborate descriptions of the special publications, one has leisure to gossip about other things, and Paris, usually given over at this season of the year to the cirque d'ete and to the Neuilly foire -- of which I shall have more to say presently -- is most interesting to the lounger."
1891-07-12T00:00:00Z,"CLEVELAND, July 11. -- Brooklyn lost again here to-day. The visitors played in poor luck throughout, while fortune seemed to favor Cleveland. The game was witnessed by a very large crowd and on account of the closeness of the scores was of a very interesting character."

William Pinkney Whyte and Bishop Paret of the Protestant Episcopal Diocese of Maryland for their remarks at the unveiling of the monument to Cecil Calvert, the Founder of Maryland. It is all about the old question of religious toleration in Maryland."
1891-07-12T00:00:00Z,"My acquaintance with Mr. Thackeray was not intimate. I had met him but once previous to his coming to America to deliver for the first time his lectures on the ""Four Georges."" In fact, I should hardly consider it worth while to make any reminiscence of him the subject of an article but for a droll occurrence which happened in my presence in which he was the conspicuous figure. But of this presently."
1891-07-12T00:00:00Z,"A writer in an American magazine claims that his countrymen speak better English than the English themselves. Controversies of this kind can seldom be decided, because it is next to impossible to secure an impartial judge. The improvements that have been made across the Atlantic in the tongue of Raleigh and Shakespeare would not constitute an important list."
1891-07-12T00:00:00Z,"RICHFIELD SPRINGS, July 11. -- Bright, breezy weather, just the sort to make outdoor life enjoyable, prevails here. The crowd of visitors is growing larger every day.

1891-07-12T00:00:00Z,"There can scarcely be any dissatisfaction in the Protestant Episcopal Church with the confermation, which is now assured, of Dr. PHILLIPS BROOKS as Bishop of Massachusetts. The opposition to his confirmation came from sticklers for the enforcement of the rules of the church, for some of which Dr. BROOKS as a Presbyter has shown little regards."

1891-07-12T00:00:00Z,""" Once upon a time"" it was an accepted decree of fashion, then more autocratic than now, that every woman who wished to ""be anybody"" must own at least one good silk dress. Since there never lived a woman with vanity so dead that she did not propose to be somebody if she could, there were few even of the most limited wardrobes which did not include the ""one good silk."""
1891-07-12T00:00:00Z,"CINCINNATI, Ohio, July 11. -- The Commercial Gazette Springfield special says the Neal and Campbell factions in that city this afternoon both claim to have elected delegates.

Thomas Miller, Jr."
1891-07-12T00:00:00Z,"FLORENCE, S.C., July 11. -- The fact that South Carolina sent no representative to the greatly mixed up convention at Cincinnati was a plain evidence that the Alliance and the third party were dead issues in this State. The Alliance as a factor in politics has been practically extinguished. It has died of inherent weakness in every organ of vitality."
1891-07-12T00:00:00Z,"LENOX, Mass., July 11. -- The weather has been delightful the last week for boating, driving, tennis, and other outdoor sports.

MARIE, Mich, July 11. -- Nearly a week ago a small brush fire started in the western part of Detour Township, Chippewa County, and to-day there is a raging forest fire, embracing all the country from Lake Turon to Lake Superior.

1891-07-12T00:00:00Z,"NYACK, July 11. -- There have been many arrivals at the Summer hotels in this place this week, the most of the guests being well-known persons from New-York and Brooklyn.

1891-07-12T00:00:00Z,"CHICAGO, July 11. -- The Chicagos held the lead in the championship race for just twenty-four hours. It made them so nervous that this afternoon they surprised 9,331 spectators by putting up the worst game they have played this season. In consequence Chicago's baseball cranks are in mourning to-night, for they realize that if Chicago is to win the pennant Anson must have the lead when the next Eastern trip begins."
1891-07-12T00:00:00Z,"The most exciting days of Summer yacht racing in these waters have come and gone. There will be nothing more of an enlivening nature until the New-York Yacht Club's annual cruise, which begins Aug. 3, save the race of the Cherry Diamond Yacht Club, July 25.

1891-07-12T00:00:00Z,The annual praises in all the newspapers of the advantages of New-York as a watering place have become objects of derision even to their authors.

1891-07-12T00:00:00Z,"Among the republics of South America Chile for more than half a century has been practically free from revolution. Her people, compared with other peoples of the Southern continent, are unusually independent and stable of character, and they possess a strong national spirit.

1891-07-17T00:00:00Z,"In THE TIMES Wednesday morning it was said that the New-York Life Insurance Company had adopted a new system of computing its assets. Besides being new, the system referred to is easily seen to be dishonest. In the case of that $110,000 worth of Third National Bank stock, which appears under two quite different cost values, an instance of this form of pliant bookkeeping was shown."

1891-07-18T00:00:00Z,"The outrageousness of Mr. ROBERT P. PORTER, Superintendent of the Census, must have become rather wearisome even to those who profit by it, either personally or politically.

1891-07-18T00:00:00Z,"The bright, clear evening, thoughts of fresh breezes from over the bay, and of promenades along the sea wall, and the prospect of hearing good music brought one of the largest crowds to Battery Park last night that has gathered in that historic spot in the course of the Summer."

Bliss, who has been so generally talked of recently as the probable Republican candidate for Governor, absolutely refuses to have his name considered in that connection.

1891-07-18T00:00:00Z,"Anything at all that tends to bring our navigation laws into ridicule and contempt ought to be welcomed by intelligent patriots.

1891-07-18T00:00:00Z,There was a very large audience at the Madison Square Garden last evening.

1891-07-19T00:00:00Z,"The good shooting of Miss LEALE at the Bisley Range suggests the possibility of a rush of her sex into this form of competitive sports.

1891-07-19T00:00:00Z,"In the Summer of 1861 there began in the upper counties of East Tennessee a reign of terror. In many respects there is no fairer region on earth than is found in the beautiful valleys of the Holston River. The country is peculiarly picturesque end enchanting.

1891-07-19T00:00:00Z,"The customary relief of the British fleet in North American waters by new assignments of vessels and crews for a tour of duty there has apparently been made the occasion for slightly strengthening it. The total number of vessels may remain the same, but the new armor-clad to serve as flagship will be larger and more effective than the present one, and so it is with substitutes among the unarmored cruisers."
1891-07-19T00:00:00Z,"COOPERSTOWN, N.Y., July l8. -- It has been a delightful though uneventful week at Cooperstown.

1891-07-19T00:00:00Z,"CHICAGO, July 18. -- Provisions made a sharp advance to-day though it was all lost before the close. Quite a professional short interest had been developed during yesterday's decline, and this was forced to cover because of the very light receipts of hogs at the yards. Pork was relatively stronger than lard at all times."
1891-07-19T00:00:00Z,The experiences of yesterday and a week ago would seem to indicate pretty plainly that the Monmouth Park Association is sadly in need of new blood or new life in the management of its affairs. A week ago there was a muddle over the Rey del Rey-San Juan race that will not soon be forgotten. Yesterday there was another muddle over the fifth race for which there seemed to be no good excuse.
1891-07-19T00:00:00Z,"CHICAGO, July 18. -- There is absolutely nothing new to record in the theatrical annals of the present week. All the down-town playhouses have settled into the easy jog of Summer runs, and while all have done an excellent business, nothing worthy of note has occurred."

1891-07-19T00:00:00Z,AMERICAN WORKMEN. -- Every one agreed that the American skilled artisan puts forth more physical effort and produces more work in a given time than the English workman or the workman of any other manufacturing community. This fact struck me and many experienced directors of works most forcibly.
1891-07-19T00:00:00Z,"A writer in the Christian Union, commenting on the sad drowning of brave young BROKAW, is undecided as to whether the athlete's parents are to be commiserated or congratulated on his loss. This writer is of the opinion that a stigma would have rested on the name of BROKAW if the young man had not plunged into the surf to save the drowning servant."
1891-07-19T00:00:00Z,"MANCHESTER, July 18. -- The team representing the Manhattan Athletic Club of New-York made its farewell appearance in this city to-day previous to its departure for home. The Americans secured three of the events and a second place."
1891-07-19T00:00:00Z,"Near the head of a long canon in Southern Oregon there is a great cave. Two openings give access to it. These openings look like small fissures in a big limestone bluff. This limestone extends for miles. It looks as massive and solid outside as any mountain in the world, but it is honeycombed like a pile that has been exposed to the teredo for years."
1891-07-19T00:00:00Z,"MONTREAL, Quebec, July 18. -- The Canadian cattle trade is perhaps on the whole the most important interest in the country. Last year it amounted to $8,000,000, the number of head carried being 130,000, giving an average of $60 each. This trade had its origin fifteen years ago, when 200 head were shipped on the European."

1891-07-19T00:00:00Z,"New-Yorkers who are fond of comparing their city with London will find an unusually fertile field of analogies and differences in what is called the ""day"" census of London. Both the American and British national censuses are residential. That is, they are supposed to show where people have their homes."
1891-07-19T00:00:00Z,"ASBURY PARK, July 18. -- The hot wave that swept over the big cities this week sent thousands or persons shoreward, and Asbury Park received its share of the pleasure seekers. Everything has been lively about town and the prospects for a profitable season are much brighter than they were last week."
1891-07-19T00:00:00Z,"ALBANY, July 18. -- Controller Wemple continues to show his contempt for the civil service law and to violate its provisions."
1891-07-19T00:00:00Z,"Year after year athletes break records, and naturally the question suggests itself, When is this record making going to stop? In all classes of athletics -- running, walking, jumping, vaulting, putting the shot, throwing the hammer and weights, and rowing -- the young men of to-day as a rule are far superior to the muscular chaps of half a dozen years ago."
1891-07-19T00:00:00Z,"MOLD ON JAM. -- One of the forms most familiar to us ill home life is the Mucor mucedo which attacks our jam. I saw pretty specimen of this a couple of years ago, when visiting a country house in Shropshire. I was called into the storeroom of my hostess to condole with her on the moldiness of her jam."
1891-07-19T00:00:00Z,"PRINCETON, N.J., July 18. -- There is a prospect that the campus of Princeton College, which now embraces over two hundred acres, with great natural advantages in elevation, woodland, and streams, will soon be properly mapped and developed.

1891-07-19T00:00:00Z,"SARATOGA SPRINGS, July 18. -- The ball last night at the Grand Union Hotel, given by Col. Woolworth to the ladies and gentlemen of the Lawn Tennis Association at present in this city, was thus far the event of this season. Col. Woolworth's young wife received those who came. The costumes of the ladies were beautiful and the display of diamonds dazzling."
1891-07-19T00:00:00Z,"CHILDREN'S BOOKS IN ALFRED'S TIME. -- As might be supposed, the earliest book that is assigned to the child is the Latin grammar. Boys' Latin grammars for several centuries were mere text books compiled from the larger works of Donatus and Priscian, and they were commonly known by the name of ""Donates"" or ""Donets,"" a term which occurs in ""Piers Plowman."""
1891-07-19T00:00:00Z,"MIDDLETOWN, N.Y., July 18. -- The Baptist Church at Hamilton, N.Y., has invited the Rev. Cornelius S. Savage of Ogdensburg to fill its vacant pastorate.

1891-07-19T00:00:00Z,"THE ENGLISH THEATRE, AS A CHINESE SEES IT. -- ""When an actor first appears upon the stage he must remove his cap and incline himself toward the seated audience as a mark of courtesy. The audience then dram upon their hands to signify their approval An actor who has gone off the stage must appear again, and by bowing toward the audience express his thanks."
1891-07-19T00:00:00Z,"RED BANK, N.J., July 18. -- The farmers of Monmouth County will make big profits this year. Last year was a fair one, but it was as nothing compared with the present season. The prices generally are high, and the crops in most cases are large. The cherry crop was immense, and despite the abundance of this fruit the prices ruled high."
1891-07-19T00:00:00Z,"LEXINGTON, Ky., July 18. -- The trotting season is now on in Kentucky and the trainers in and around Lexington are making use of every moment in the preparation of their horses. While very little extra fast work has been done this week, all the candidates for race and 2:30 honors have been worked out with more than usual care."
1891-07-19T00:00:00Z,"The annual club book of the American Yacht Club made its appearance last Thursday. Between its cream-colored covers there is a world of information for yachtsmen, and in point of quality -- that is to say, arrangement -- as well as quantity the little volume has no superior in its line. By way of a frontispiece there is a first-class view of the clubhouse and club grounds at Milton Point."
1891-07-19T00:00:00Z,"WATCH HILL, July 18. -- This pretty peninsula had an unusual attack of fog the earlier part of the week, it coming and going two or three times a day, and the unusual phenomenon was not regarded with the warmest admiration by the hotel guests who wanted to go yachting, or by the weather-seamed tars who run pleasure boats. The hotels are filling up, however."
1891-07-19T00:00:00Z,"Some very ugly and wry-faced rumors concerning the management of the New-York Life have been filling our ears of late. Moreover, they have great persistency, are not light and feathery, but heavy and leaden."
1891-07-19T00:00:00Z,"OTTAWA, Ontario, July 18. -- Official advices from England confirm a recent intimation by cable that the Imperial Government will indemnity the Canadian sealing schooners for losses sustained by the adoption of a close season in Bering Sea. This decision on the part of the home authority is regarded as a good one, as it will tend to allay the popular outburst of British Columbia occasioned by the unexpectedness of the recent international agreement."
1891-07-19T00:00:00Z,"BERLIN, July 18. -- Mr. Edwards, the American Consul General here, has invited all the American Consuls in Germany to a conference in this city with Herr Wermuth, the Imperial Commissioner, to the World's Fair to be held in Chicago.

1891-07-19T00:00:00Z,"George F. Parker, who is reported to have committed suicide in his London lodgings Thursday night, was well known to the police in this city. His photograph in the Rogues' Gallery, No. 1,729, shows a face strongly in contrast with the average run of low-browed, heavy-jawed faces that abound in this collection of criminals."

West-Erskine of Adelaide, South Australia, who is in this city on his way to Europe, thinks the labor question is bound to cause great trouble in Australia.

1891-07-19T00:00:00Z,"The movement in favor of Pattison is a movement in favor of an impossible candidate. The Democracy of the Union would not consent to the Governor's nomination at this time, no matter how much success the men who are engineering the scheme might have in securing delegates in this State. The fact must not be overlooked that, when the next President shall be inaugurated, Gov. Pattison will have served out but half of his term."

Stevens, the first Commodore of the New-York Yacht Club, and fifty years ago the most active and able promoter of yachting in this country, nor yet of George Steers, the first distinctive yacht designer this country produced, has ever so thoroughly arrested the attention of the yachting world or caused such widespread and genuine regret among American yachtsmen as the death of Edward Burgess."

It was lucky for the steamboats and mountain resorts that the severe rainstorm which has been raging all the afternoon did not begin till late in the morning, for if it had travel would have had a black eye."
1891-07-19T00:00:00Z,"With Jay Gould sick with the neuralgia, C.P. Huntington out of sorts with malaria and rheumatism, and John D. Rockefeller under treatment for nervous prostration, it is not to be marveled at that Wall Street men ask, ""Are our great financiers breaking down?""

1891-07-19T00:00:00Z,"DOGS ON MONEY. -- There is an important group of about forty coins containing outlines of dogs, which deserve careful study. The interest of some of them is mainly mythical, as with Laelaps, the hound of Actaeon, presented to Cephalos by Procris; or with the dog of Segeste, which symbolized the river Crimisus. But there are enough to show how extensive were the operations of the dog fancier in early times."
1891-07-19T00:00:00Z,"Grammar School No. 20, in Chrystie Street, near Delancey, must have been built over an old churchyard, judging from the great quantity of human bones unearthed in the cellar of the building in the last week. The boiler room and furnaces are in the cellar of the school. Extensive repairs were ordered to the apparatus there during the Summer vacation and work was begun last Monday."

1891-07-19T00:00:00Z,"The cool, dim shadows of early dawn still clung to the leeward side of things as old Cap'n Joel made sail on the little sloop. A mild breeze came up from the southward and stirred into lazy life the vagrant patches of mist that hung here and there on the surface of Great South Bay. Away out in the solitude of water the lighthouse on Fire Island loomed faintly against the rosy sky."
1891-07-19T00:00:00Z,"Moliere had the hatred of men of the the-tre for book men, an explicable hatred: the more learned readers the less pleased theatregoers. The book men have given their wittiest, profoundest, and handsomest works in praise of Moliere; Was there over nobler revenefulness!"

1891-07-19T00:00:00Z,"BOSTON, July 18. -- The fight within the ranks of the Republican Party on the question of the Gubernatorial nomination is still far from settlement. There is no decided preference on the part of the leaders or even of the voters. Crapo has made some gain, but he is handicapped by the too frequent use of his name. He has been a candidate constantly since 1883. His name has become tiresome and almost offensive."
1891-07-19T00:00:00Z,"PHILADELPHIA, July 18. -- The case of Henry H. Yard, charged with contempt of court, in not appearing before the City Council's committee of investigation, was up again before Common Pleas Court to-day, but was not finally disposed of. The decision of the case hinged on whether or not the writ of certiorari taken out by Yard's attorney was a supersedeas and stayed further proceedings in the lower court."
1891-07-19T00:00:00Z,"Fresh-water fishing resorts near the city are much fewer than those on the coast or the saltwater tideways and rivers, and the angling is just about as uncertain for the most part. There are, however, many who love to go out on the fresh-water lakes and rivers, and for their information a few places where there are known to be some fish will be given in this article, as well as directions for reaching them."
1891-07-19T00:00:00Z,"The trouble experienced in getting good firemen for the navy was never so great as it is at present. Firemen are not only reluctant to enlist, but the great majority of those who do apply are of an inferior grade. The trouble in this respect is not confined to the United States Navy. Last week's dispatches announced that the British Admiralty, in sheer despair, had had to call on the marines to do firemen's duty."
1891-07-19T00:00:00Z,"Mr. Neilson does not pretend to trace back to the beginning trial by combat. Its origin was, ""Might is right."" The strongest savage exercised his brute strength in the dawn of the world, and, when he killed his weaker adversary, established the justice of his cause. In a modified form, when two Englishmen come to fisticuffs to settle a difficulty or popinjay German students swing and slash schlaegers, primeval ferocity once more establishes its sway."

1891-07-19T00:00:00Z,"The dinner to CLARKSON at Coney Island on Friday night does not seem likely to have any tremendous political effect. If it does, it will be of the boomerang kind. ""Boss"" PLATT'S jubilant introduction of the guest as a man who has ""cut off many heads"" was one of those maladroit performances that men are liable to who lack moral sensibility and assume that others are as callous as themselves."
1891-07-19T00:00:00Z,"As a constant reader of your manly, straight- forward, and ever able paper, I wish to send a word from the West on the subject of the Treasury and its statements.

There are absolutely no obstructive wires in Paris."
1891-07-19T00:00:00Z,"We had heard a great deal in general about the ""other concerns"" that, like the Tribune's mythical tin-plate establishments, ""had glutted,"" or were about to glut, the markets of this country with their great output of tin plate.

1891-07-19T00:00:00Z,"THOUSAND ISLAND PARK, N.Y., July 18. -- Increased passenger traffic to the Thousand Islands has arrested the attention of another steamboat line.

1891-07-19T00:00:00Z,"Very remarkable is the news that comes from China. Within a short space of time, less than a month, the foreign missions at Nanking, Wuhu, Tang Yang, Kin Kiang, and Wusueh have been raided by mobs and burned. Ching Kiang, Hart Kow, Soochow, and even Shanghai have been threatened with attack."
1891-07-19T00:00:00Z,"PARIS, July 18. -- The Chamber of Deputies today approved the remaining clauses of the tariff relating to the temporary free admission of certain imports. The entire new tariff measure was then passed by a vote of 387 to 110."
1891-07-19T00:00:00Z,A little further investigation of the operation of the McKinley tariff on importations of tissue paper demonstrates that the increased duty was only another legalized job at the expense of the poor consumer. The former tariff was 25 per cent. ad valorem; the McKinley act increased it to 15 per cent. ad valorem and 8 cents per pound. On the lower-priced papers the increase amounted to over 130 per cent.

1891-07-19T00:00:00Z,"LAKE HOPATCONG, N.J., July 18. -- There is not an empty cottage at Hopatcong. Each of the pretty villas about Mount Arlington Park and the surrounding hills is as gay as a city house in midwinter season. The cottagers and guests alike are very fond of the water, and spend much of their time afloat. Mrs. Crooks of San Francisco gave a launch party early in the week for her daughters."
1891-07-20T00:00:00Z,"The seizure by the Dominion cruiser Dream of several American fishing boats belonging to Eastport is a reminder of the almost total eclipse thus far during the present season of what used to be a fiery and menacing dispute in that region. Instead of the many arrests of American fishing schooners which created so much excitement a few years ago, the season has passed until now in profound quiet all along the Dominion coast."
1891-07-20T00:00:00Z,"Earl De La Warr, in the House of Lords, wanted to know whether her Majesty's Government could not make some regulations to prevent inflammable substances being carried on board passenger ships. Lord Ravensworth interposed a protest against stringent rules being enforce which might increase rather than diminish the causes of accidents at sea, inasmuch as such restrictions did not exist in the case of foreign vessels."
1891-07-20T00:00:00Z,"Writing of the death of Mr. W.H. Gladstone, the London correspondent of the Manchester Guardian says: ""His nature was essentially modest and retiring. He almost studiously concealed what was in him, and habitually did himself much less than justice. His mind moved slowly; he had no rhetorical gifts, and his utterance was naturally guarded and deliberate."

1891-07-20T00:00:00Z,"The Farmers' Alliance in Maryland seems to be working very much as it worked in South Carolina before the election of TILLMAN. It is not working as a third party or for an independent ticket, but is seeking to control the action of the Democratic Party. It has a favored candidate for Governor, but he is a Democrat, and the Alliance intends to secure his nomination by the Democratic Convention."
1891-07-20T00:00:00Z,"The North River, from Twenty-third to Forty-second Street, presented a stirring sight yesterday. At an early hour an admiring throng began to line the water front, and it gazed with curious eyes at the stately ships of the squadron of evolution, whose milk-white sides showed in sharp contrast to the dark waters of the river."
1891-07-20T00:00:00Z,"The testimony given at the inquest and the report of the State Inspector of Railroads tend to change some of the opinions that were expressed immediately after the collision on the Erie Road at Ravenna, and that seemed then to be well founded. It is clear that the rear brakeman of the passenger train should not alone be held responsible for the killing of nineteen persons, although he did not do his whole duty."
1891-07-20T00:00:00Z,"Mr. ROBERT P. PORTER'S census appears to be marked by bad work in almost every department of the investigation. The New-York Tribune has recently pointed out some inexcusable blunders in the work relating to the products of California. The Engineering and Mining Journal, an accepted authority in its field, now asserts that the bulletin relating to the production of lead and zinc is not what it should be."

1891-07-20T00:00:00Z,"The architectural aspect of New-York City is in a state of perpetual evolution. In its history yesterday is hardly remembered, and of the day before we have only the faintest recollection. It is always essentially of to-day.

1891-07-25T00:00:00Z,"It is never safe for foreign observers to estimate the significance of English ""bye-elections."" They are in almost equal danger of attaching to these casual and sporadic manifestations of local opinion too little importance and too much. The value of the personal or the local equation is really not to be ascertained, and it is this fact that makes the English discussion over them alike unprofitable and unending."

An official statement, made in reply to inquiries, is that Mr. Van Horne is only here on private business, but the statement meets with little acceptance."
1891-07-26T00:00:00Z,"The Mail and Express cannot be said to be good to its friends. In a conspicuous place in its columns it displayed yesterday the following head lines: ""FOSTER Talks: Major MCKINLEY, He Thinks, Will Have 75,000 Majority in Ohio.""

1891-07-26T00:00:00Z,"The general public has heretofore known Prof. Ordronaux chiefly as an expounder of medical jurisprudence and as all authority in questions of insanity.

1891-07-26T00:00:00Z,"Wherever there has bean activity in the market the past week, it has been at the expense of prices; but there has not been much, and it was mainly confined to two or three stocks. The absolute lack of speculative vitality is producing its natural effect in developing a general sagging tendency.

Prof. Fortier's commentary is accurate, brief, and exhaustive.

1891-07-31T00:00:00Z,"CHICAGO, July 30. -- Advices from Omaha are to the effect that President Cable of the Rock Island celebrated his victory over Jay Gould to-day by crossing the Union Pacific Bridge in his special car, and that the trains of that company will begin running regularly into Omaha to-morrow. The Chicago, Milwaukee and St. Paul commenced using the bridge to-day."
1891-07-31T00:00:00Z,"The Republican State Committee met yesterday under somewhat depressing circumstances and decided to call the State Convention to meet at Rochester on the 9th of September. No particular reason could be given for holding the convention at Rochester, except that Assemblyman PARSONS pleaded that it would help him in his Senatorial fight against MCNAUGHTON."
1891-07-31T00:00:00Z,"The appointment of Mr. FASSETT to the place made vacant by the resignation of Mr. ERHARDT only confirms what was very well known before, that the resignation of Mr. ERHARDT was practically compulsory, and that it was forced to make room for the appointee of Mr. PLATT. When Mr. ERHARDT declares that ""the office is no longer independent, and I am, and so we separated,"" he put the same fact in a vivid form."
1891-07-31T00:00:00Z,"The ruling of the Treasury Department by which a drawback of 99 per cent. of the tariff duty on imported tin plate used in the manufacture of ""kitchen or house-furnishing goods"" is allowed when these goods are exported, is announced just in time to relieve the minds of Mr. NIEDRINGHAUS and other makers of kitchenware."
1891-07-31T00:00:00Z,"BOSTON, July 30. -- Russian Jews who arrived on the steamer Norseman yesterday, many of whom are detained by the Immigrant Commissioners, have pitiful stories to relate of the cruelties perpetrated upon them by the Russians. One lad, who refused to give his name for fear of being apprehended and returned, said he came from Slabotky."
1891-07-31T00:00:00Z,"CORTLAND, N.Y., July 30. -- The convention of the Knights of Pythias resumed its session here this morning. The convention decided to hold the next meeting at Troy on the fourth Tuesday of July, 1892. Officers were elected as follows:"

He left for Philadelphia by the Baltimore and Ohio Railroad at 8:10 o'clock this evening, and will be at Cape May Point early to-morrow morning."
1891-07-31T00:00:00Z,"The indictment of an evening newspaper for violating the law against the publication of the details of executions was an injudicious and unfortunate procedure. Now an important and responsible newspaper has been indicted for the same offense, and it is to be expected that the law will undergo a searching judicial examination."
1891-07-31T00:00:00Z,"In the campaign of last Fall the McKinley papers ""pointed with pride"" to Mr. SHERMAN'S so-called Anti-Trust law. They asserted that the Republican Party had ""redeemed its pledges for the suppression of Trusts,"" and declared that the law had already become ""effective."" Some of them coolly told their readers that the great Trusts were already going down before this statute."
1891-07-31T00:00:00Z,Much unfavorable comment has recently been aroused among the owners and manufacturers of patent medicines and other proprietary articles by a swindle which is being practiced more and more upon them and the public by some retail druggists.
1891-07-31T00:00:00Z,It is now generally believed in Connecticut that the chief object of the cabal exposed by Mr. LYNDE HARRISON was to secure the defeat of Senator HAWLEY for re-election in the hope of being able to replace him by MORGAN G. BULKELEY. This is in the line of the attempt to defeat Mr. SHERMAN in the interest of FORAKER.
1891-07-31T00:00:00Z,"ST. LOUIS, July 30. -- The controversy growing out of the decision of Judge Claiborne that the law closing the poolrooms is unconstitutional has assumed a decidedly sensational phase. Charges and countercharges are made that would lead an unenlightened person to think there was not an honest or decent man in public office or in the legal profession in the city."
1891-07-31T00:00:00Z,"RED BANK, N.J., July 30. -- An exciting race for the Neptune Club challenge cup was sailed this afternoon. The cup, which is an elegant silver trophy, was presented to the North Shrewsbury Yacht-Club two years ago by the Neptune Club of the Highlands. It can only be sailed for on the North Shrewsbury River."
1891-07-31T00:00:00Z,"Apparently Mr. HARRISON'S Administration prefers that whatever is scandalous in its experience shall be investigated by the Democratic House. It has been accumulating a number of tasks for that body that will be taken up, we may be sure, with entire alacrity, with as much impartiality as such work usually commands, and with opportunities for making party capital for which the gentlemen in power are to be thanked."
1891-07-31T00:00:00Z,"PHILADELPHIA, July 30. -- United States Senator Quay arrived in the city from Washington at 7 o'clock to-night. He was accompanied by his son Dick, Frank Willing Leach, and Parker L. Walter, editor of the Pittsburg Chronicle Telegraph. The party was driven at once to the Continental Hotel."
1891-07-31T00:00:00Z,"WASHINGTON, July 30. -- Senator Fassett's nomination to be Collector of the Port of New-York came so soon after the resignation of Quay and Dudley from the National Committee that it was almost inevitable that the two circumstances should be spoken of together to-day. If the appointment had been made conditional upon the reorganization of the committee with Quay and Dudley excluded the bargain could hardly have been carried out more promptly."
1891-07-31T00:00:00Z,The gathering of Republicans at the Fifth Avenue Hotel yesterday resembled a political funeral. A pall seemed to hang over the rotunda of the hotel when the State Committee was assembling. Everybody was disposed to discuss the change made at the Custom House by the substitution of Senator J. Sloat Fassett for Col. Joel B. Erhardt for Collector of the Port rather than the coming State campaign.
1891-07-31T00:00:00Z,"JAMAICA, L.I., July 30. -- The inquest on the death of Frederick A. Obey, who was murdered in front of Wick's Half-way House, near Hyde Park, L.I., Sunday night, was begun in Miller's Hall, Hyde Park, to-night by Coroner Everett of Jamaica. The accused men, William Covert and George Becker, were present in charge of Constables Ashmead and Murphy."
1891-07-31T00:00:00Z,"BALTIMORE, July 30. -- The Democrats of Maryland held a thoroughly harmonious convention in Ford's Opera House to-day, and all the nominations were made without opposition. While the convention leaves a number of disappointed would be candidates in its wake, yet all their fights were made before the body was called to order, and all the nominations were made by acclamation."
1891-07-31T00:00:00Z,"ROME, July 30. -- The Holy See has just appointed an extraordinary commission of Cardinals to reorganize the Catholic missions."
1891-07-31T00:00:00Z,"There is something comic in the announcement that two Italians and a German have been arrested for sketching the forts at Como, in Lombardy, presumably for the use and behoof of France and Germany. There is an ancient and obsolete superstition about the sketching of military works for which many a picturesque tourist has suffered."
1891-07-31T00:00:00Z,"SIOUX FALLS, S.D., July 30. -- A dynamite bomb is about to be exploded under the divorce law of South Dakota by the position taken by Judge Aikens, that the spirit of the law must be complied with, which will result in Mrs. J.G. Blaine, Jr.'s, failure to get a divorce. The general public seems to be unaware of the facts pertaining to the ease with which divorces are granted in this new State."
1891-07-31T00:00:00Z,"INDIANAPOLIS, Ind., July 30. -- Three hundred representatives of the People's Party assembled in State Convention in this city to-day and took important action in the matter of organizing for the coming campaign. T.W. Ferre, President of the State Alliance, was made Chairman, and a half dozen editors of country papers in sympathy with the party were made executives. Plans of organization were then discussed and adopted."
1891-08-01T00:00:00Z,"The few seizures of schooners that have been made in Bering Sea this Summer add interest to the sealing controversy, particularly in regard to the proceedings that may be taken against these vessels. The San Francisco schooner said to have been brought to by the Thetis in prohibited waters would, of course, be subject to our own statutes, now for many years in operation."
1891-08-01T00:00:00Z,"WASHINGTON, D.C., July 31. -- If the predictions of the Hydrographic Office are verified, the month of August will be very favorable for transatlantic ocean travel, and some unusually quick passages may be expected. The monthly pilot chart for August will be issued to-morrow, and it will show that the steamship routes are almost entirely free from ice, whereas usually the 1st of August finds the ocean off the Grand Banks thickly studded with bergs."
1891-08-01T00:00:00Z,"PHILADELPHIA, July 31. -- In a long letter to Auditor General McCamant, ostensibly asking for information and instructions before bringing suits for delinquent mercantile taxes, City Treasurer Wright shows up in a startling manner the iniquitous mercantile tax system. In the course of his letter he says:"
1891-08-01T00:00:00Z,"The statement that the Eastport boats are taking advantage of the presence of the revenue cutter Woodbury openly to fish in British waters must be taken with allowance. The whole point at issue is as to where the boundary runs, or rather as to whether a certain ground occupied by the half dozen boats seized recently by the Dominion cruiser Dream is within British limits."
1891-08-01T00:00:00Z,"Even the St. Louis Globe-Democrat, a Republican paper which has been a mouthpiece for Mr. NIEDRINGHAUS in the discussion concerning tin plate, deserts him when it comes to the question of importing workmen under contract to take the place of strikers in his rolling mill and kitchenware factory."
1891-08-01T00:00:00Z,"A pleasanter day for racing than the Monmouth Park Association had yesterday could not be asked for. The weather was perfect, the track in good condition, and the races were well fought out as a rule. As favorites won five of the seven races, there was general satisfaction among those present, a number that did not in any way tax the capacities of the track."
1891-08-01T00:00:00Z,"In attempting to excite popular sympathy in his behalf, President Beers of the New-York Life Insurance Company has drawn a parallel between the life insurance corporation and the savings bank corporation in respect to the alarm that is felt alike by the policy holders of the one and the depositors of the other when the integrity of the institutions which they are interested in is assailed."
1891-08-01T00:00:00Z,"PEEKSKILL, July 31. -- Gilmore's classical concert last night proved to be considerably more than a rare musical treat. It worked wonders. Everybody plodded to the mess hall through the most violent thunderstorm of the season, whose lightning accompaniments paled and put to blush the electric lamps, with which the camp grounds is studded in plentiful profusion."
1891-08-01T00:00:00Z,"PHILADELPHIA, July 31. -- All day long the corridors of the Continental were crowded with politicians of high and low degree, all anxious to get a word with Senator Quay, and all anxious to discover if possible what the silent statesman's next move would be. The first arrival at the hotel this morning was State Chairman W.H. Andrews."
1891-08-01T00:00:00Z,"OTTAWA, July 31. -- There were more sensational developments before the ""boodle"" investigating committee to-day. A chain of evidence has been woven around Sir Hector Langevin, Minister of Public Works, and his resignation will be sure to follow. A report submitted by the expert accountants appointed to examine the books of Larkin, Connolly Co., with whom the Minister had confidential relations, shows a serious state of affairs."
1891-08-01T00:00:00Z,"HORNELLSVILLE, July 31. -- There is fun ahead in the Twenty-ninth Congressional District Democratic Convention. Charles F. Peck, who nominated David B. Hill in the convention which selected him as the Lieutenant Governor with ex-President Cleveland as the head, some time ago began laying pipes for the nomination by the State Democratic Convention for Lieutenant Governor."
1891-08-01T00:00:00Z,"Big fish have been the feature of the angling this Summer. When the trout began to bite freely in the Spring, anglers not only noticed that the average was excellent, but also that the occasional large one was a ""whopper."" Several trout weighing over two pounds apiece were taken in the Beaverkill region. A two-pound trout is a large one for this State."

Smith, assignee of the Bank of America, (which closed its doors in April, 1890,) this afternoon filed his first account in the Prothonotary's office. The account shows receipts amounting to $118,047.78, and expenditures $73,431.20, leaving a balance of $44,616.58 for distribution among an army of about 4,000 depositors, whose claims stand undisputed."

Dwyer were interested in the purchase of a tract of land near New-Brunswick, N.J., where they proposed to establish a track for Winter racing, has no foundation in fact. It was stated that the equipments of the Elizabeth track would be transferred to the new plot of ground, and that there would be no more racing over the New-Jersey Jockey Club's track."
1891-08-01T00:00:00Z,"In the Jefferson Market Police Court yesterday, Capt. R.H. Bowman of Los Angeles, Cal., appeared against R.D. Mountdore, a banker and broker, of 510 Fifth Avenue.

1891-08-01T00:00:00Z,"DES MOINES, Iowa, July 31. -- J.R. Sovereign, Labor Commissioner of Iowa, has filed his biennial report with the Governor. The statistical portion of the report embodies in tabulated forms the experiences of more than 3,000 farmers as submitted by themselves. The portion of the report which deals with production is interesting. Mr. Sovereign says:"

1891-08-01T00:00:00Z,"CHICAGO, July 31. -- The trial of John Stakely and Dennis McCurdy, indicted for conspiracy, resulted to-day in a verdict of guilty. Instead of a penitentiary sentence, which was possible, the men were fined $100. The defendants are railroad conductors, who were instrumental in causing a four days' strike in the Chicago and Eastern Illinois Railroad in November last."
1891-08-01T00:00:00Z,"Most railroad men have an impression that the boycott against the Chicago and Alton Road is practically at an end in consequence of the refusal of the Grand Trunk Railway system to persist further in the warfare. It is true that the Alton has not suffered much from this ineffective boycott, but other Western railroad interests have been put to much inconvenience and extra expense because of its operation."
1891-08-01T00:00:00Z,"It is not in the least surprising that a rumor should get abroad that Mr. WANAMAKER is to ""retire"" from the Cabinet. Mr. WANAMAKER has of late been making an exhibition of himself as a witness which is naturally adapted to convert him into a dead weight upon any social, industrial, or political enterprise in which he may be conspicuously engaged."
1891-08-01T00:00:00Z,The committee of the Grand Jury to which the duty of inquiring into the unclean condition of the streets of this city was assigned showed a great deal of tenderness for Commissioner BEATTIE and reserved its reproaches for the Board of Estimate and Apportionment for not allowing him sufficient funds with which to do his work properly.
1891-08-01T00:00:00Z,"COLUMBUS, Ohio, July 31. -- The Senatorial lines in Ohio are being tightly drawn between Senator Sherman and ex-Gov. Foraker, with Secretary Foster in the background as the beneficiary of the Sherman contingent in the event that the latter fails to secure a majority of the Republican members of the Legislature. The result of the Hamilton County Convention yesterday has alarmed the Sherman managers and discouraged their plans for the immediate future."
1891-08-01T00:00:00Z,"Nothing is more curious in the whole business of the official persecution of the Jews in Russia than the difficulty of getting accurate information about it. The ""rumor"" that the Russian Government had suspended the execution of the edict of expulsion could not have gained currency if the question were of any civilized nation."
1891-08-01T00:00:00Z,"LONDON, July 31. -- Messrs. Dillon and O'Brien's repudiation of Parnell, though a foregone conclusion, has profoundly depressed the Parnellites, who relied upon a belief that both would suspend a public announcement.

1891-08-01T00:00:00Z,"The Guaranty Loan and Trust Company of San Francisco has, to say the least, a peculiar method of transacting its business. Its agents in this city are a firm known as ""Sharon Co.,"" who have an office at 712 Broadway, and it is through this concern that any one who desires to ""make a loan"" is obliged to apply."
1891-08-01T00:00:00Z,"Mr. Erhardt, who has resigned his place as the Collector of the Port of New-York for the excellent and uncompromising reason that there was nothing else for him to do, is endeavoring to put himself in the light of a hero and a martyr. This is highly absurd on Mr. Erhardt's part, though in that respect it is characteristic. The Republican Party honored him with an office of great trust and responsibility."
1891-08-01T00:00:00Z,"About a week ago Rusie, the big pitcher of the New-York Club, injured his hand and it was feared that he would not be able to play for some time to come. He urged Capt. Ewing to allow him to play yesterday, and he went in to face the Brooklyns."

1891-08-01T00:00:00Z,"BOSTON, July 31. -- Three Republican Congressmen have resigned their membership on the Committee of Resolutions, in letters of formal withdrawal now before the State Committee. They are F.W. Rockwell of Pittsfield and Gen. Cogswell and Joseph Walker of Worcester. Mr. Rockwell has recently been chosen Chairman of the Committee on Resolutions for the next Republican Convention, and his withdrawal in particular was unlooked for."

1891-08-01T00:00:00Z,"ST. LOUIS, July 31. -- Thomas Hackett, Deputy Building Commissioner, was to-day summarily dismissed from his position. This dismissal reveals a queer chapter of municipal government. The dead-lock between the Council and the Mayor over the latter's appointments has resulted in a committee being set to work investigating the departments."
1891-08-01T00:00:00Z,"The city will have to pay for some rather peculiar work done several years ago in the reguulating of Clifton Street, between St. Ann's and Union Avenues, unless the decision handed down by Judge Barrett, in the Supreme Court, Chambers, yesterday is reversed. Proceedings to have the assessment for the improvement reduced were brought by H.P. De Graft, a property owner, through Truman H. Baldwin, on the ground of fraud."

If one-quarter of her railroad interests had been left to young Hopkins, then the Stanford and Crocker faction could easily have purchased the balance and thus secured control."
1891-08-01T00:00:00Z,"By far the larger part of the revenues of the United States Treasury are collected from duties on imported merchandise. The greater part of these duties are collected at the port of New-York. The Custom House in this city is the most important business agency of the Government, requiring for its proper management a high degree of business experience and skill, sound judgment, absolute integrity, and a good deal of firmness."
1891-08-01T00:00:00Z,"CLEVELAND, July 31. -- There was a brilliant close of the Grand Circuit meeting here this afternoon the four contests being decided in thirteen heats, and only one favorite winning."
1891-08-02T00:00:00Z,"We suppose that the obligation of honesty, the duty of carrying out pledges that are made deliberately and voluntarily, will hardly be repudiated by any considerable number of intelligent Americans of this generation. It may be, and often is, disregarded by a certain number, but even then it receives the recognition that vice pays to virtue, in hypocritical pretense."

1891-08-02T00:00:00Z,"As the days go by even the memory of noted events grows dim, and in the flight of years less than a half century is time sufficient to render extremely uncertain a knowledge of things that were deemed of minor importance. That this is true is demonstrated by the inability of many men, even Confederate soldiers, to describe accurately the flag under which they fought."
1891-08-02T00:00:00Z,"There are charming things told about the Americans in this book, and they are not less true than the vexing ones."

1891-08-02T00:00:00Z,"WASHINGTON, Aug. 1. -- Seven times a year, and always in the Winter, Spring, and Fall, a queer flag is flung to the breeze in Washington. To him who sees it for the first time it may suggest piracy, but to those who know it the black gridiron on a white field is suggestive only of good cheer and innocent merriment. This cross-barred and severe-looking flag is that of the Gridiron Club."
1891-08-02T00:00:00Z,"DETROIT, Mich., Aug. 1. -- To-day Detroit is already in full bloom for the twenty-fifth reunion of the Grand Army of the Republic, the triumphal arches and the decoration of public buildings and business houses excelling in artistic beauty, variety, and extent any similar preparations in honor of the veterans. This is the verdict of all the past commanders who have attended all the reunions of the army."

1891-08-02T00:00:00Z,"The Summer boarder is abroad in all her glory. One uses ""her"" advisedly, for somehow the male adult rarely poses as the Summer boarder. He stands it over Sunday, perhaps, but a consecutive fortnight of undiluted Summer boarding-house life would, as he tells his neighbor in the smoking car as they are being whirled from the city on Saturday, put him in Bloomingdale at the end of it -- and his neighbor agrees with him."

1891-08-02T00:00:00Z,"It was to be expected that Parnellism would die hard in Ireland, but it will scarcely be pretended by anybody but PARNELL himself that it is not at last dead. The defection of DILLON and O'BRIEN and of the owner of the Freeman's Journal may be said to leave him without an organ or a friend, that is a friend whose support will do him any good with the Irish people."

The greater part of the officers of the white posts are ensconced in comfortable berths in the Custom House, and there the indignation over the action of the national body was greatest."
1891-08-09T00:00:00Z,It is proverbially easy for men to be liberal with other people's money. No taxes or debts are paid so promptly and cheerfully as those which come out of estates in charge of others than the owners. No claims are so easily allowed as those that are made upon property in the hands of trustees or administrators who suffer no loss by their payment.
1891-08-09T00:00:00Z,"PITTSBURG, Penn., Aug. 8. -- Gov. Pattison was in the city a few hours to-day.

There are no statistics made public by the present Administration that enable us to get at the facts sought by our correspondent. Under the system prevailing before Mr. FOSTER took office such facts were readily known with substantial accuracy."
1891-08-09T00:00:00Z,"NASHVILLE, Aug. 8. -- The questions which will come before the Legislature at the extra session to begin the last day of this month are already engrossing the attention of laboring people and politicians all over the State. By the careless enrolling of a bill at the regular session the election laws were rendered inoperative. This error must be corrected, and under the Constitution the State must be redistricted and the Senators and Representatives reapportioned."

1891-08-09T00:00:00Z,"There is nothing about the Union Pacific Company to-day which has not been known for months to the few. There is a great deal more known about it to the many. Therein consists largely the difference in the speculative position of the stock; and it may be added, of the bonds also. The market the past week has hinged considerably on the movements of Union Pacific."

1891-08-09T00:00:00Z,"COOPERSTOWN, N.Y., Aug. 8. -- This popular Summer resort was thrown into a fever this morning by a fire alarm. The Cooper House, the leading hotel, was found in flames, and long before any of the lazy Summer guests had thought of rising from bed -- 8:30 A.M. Like all villages of its size, Cooperstown has primitive fire-subduing facilities. By the rarest good fortune no lives were lost."

1891-08-09T00:00:00Z,"It is announced that Ja Ja, once Chief of Opobo, is dead. It will be remembered that Ja Ja was deposed by the English Government some years ago, and that his case attracted a good deal of attention in the House of Commons and in the English press.

1891-08-10T00:00:00Z,"APOCRYPHAL TRAVELS. -- The ""Voyages and Travels of Sir John Maundeville"" appeared in the latter part of the fourteenth century. Its quaint and quasi-ingenuous narrative of an adventurous English knight's wanderings in the East quickly won it a popularity which was not a whit diminished by the monstrous extravagance of its fictions."
1891-08-10T00:00:00Z,"DU MAURIER. -- On page 140 of Punch, Vol. II. for the year 1860, is to be seen Du Maurier's first drawing, unsigned, which represents a number of humble artists (including Mr. Whistler) entering a photographer's studio.

1891-08-10T00:00:00Z,"That veteran advocate of free-silver, Gen. A.J. WARNER, has issued a manifesto to the voters of Ohio on the free-coinage question.

Dr. Lardner, after all, only gave utterance to what was a prevailing impression."
1891-08-10T00:00:00Z,"LENOX, Mass., Aug. 8. -- The cottagers who remain here have been having a pleasant, though quiet week. The young people have had much pleasure in private theatricals, boating, tennis, and driving. Many of the older visitors are at the seashore."

1891-08-10T00:00:00Z,"The rain-compelling emissaries of the Agricultural Department, headed by Gen. DYRENFORTH, have now reached that remote region in Texas which they have deemed desirable for their experiments. Accordingly, we may possibly look for the mystification of the nearest local weather sharp by the reversal of his predictions, the production of deluges out of dry skies, and the forcible overthrow of all the accumulated lore and stock signs of the Signal Bureau and its observers."
1891-08-10T00:00:00Z,"TELEPATHY. -- A young married lady related to me the following remarkable experience of this kind: Shortly after her marriage she had accompanied her husband to India.

1891-08-10T00:00:00Z,"THE SLIPSHOD MUSE. -- Slipshod versification is now hardly possible. Rhymes are criticised with a severe care which has something ludicrous in it, and furnish, in the absence of the critical power now so unhappily rare, materials for many lines of useful copy. Such lines as ""You trample our beds of ranunculus, While you 'Tommy-make-room-for-your-uncle' us,"" seem to excite connoisseurs to a kind of delirium of praise."
1891-08-10T00:00:00Z,"DAYTON, Ohio, Aug. 9. -- State Deputy Game Warden L.K. Buntain of this city fatally shot David McIlvain, whom he caught, with four others, seining in Mad River, near Harshmanville, about midnight.

1891-08-10T00:00:00Z,"BAR HARBOR, Mo., Aug. 8. -- Whatever the state of the Blaine boom elsewhere, it certainly can get little stimulus from the Secretary of State himself. He is living a passive life under the shadow of Mount Desert and preserving an almost perfect isolation. So many stories, exaggerated one way or the other, have been printed about the Secretary of State's physical condition as to make him an object of curiosity to every visitor here."

They say in a published statement that $10,000 of this mortgage has been paid off, leaving only $60,000 still unsatisfied. Probably this statement is true, although there is nothing on the county records to show it."
1891-08-10T00:00:00Z,"PARIS, July 23. -- The leave-taking of the Chamber of Deputies was disturbed, and the serenity of Minister de Freycinet ruthlessly perplexed by the sudden appearance of a small bombshell. It was thrown, too, from the groundwork most sacred to M. de Freycinet. Whatever opinion his friends and enemies may have of the President du Consell, they all agree as to his unexpected efficiency and popularity as the Minister of War."
1891-08-10T00:00:00Z,"A most peculiar and fatal accident occurred in Brooklyn yesterday forenoon, by which John Uniack and his little four-year-old child were almost instantly killed.

1891-08-10T00:00:00Z,"ALBANY, Aug. 9. -- Deputy Superintendent of Banking Cyrus Stewart has taken occasion to criticise the deductions made from the savings bank reports for July 1 and printed in THE TIMES last Sunday, and to assert that the statement that some of the money savings of people are being diverted to building and loan associations is not the fact. Mr. Stewart says:"
1891-08-10T00:00:00Z,"LONDON, Aug. 9. -- There was a plethora of money during the past week. Discount was quoted at 1 1/2 for three months and 1/2 for short, with no demand. A small drain of gold continues toward Germany. There is nothing to indicate large immediate withdrawals from the Bank of England from any quarter. Though discount houses are obliged to work at absurdly low rates for short bills, six-months' drafts are not regarded with favor."
1891-08-10T00:00:00Z,"The figures of attendance at the State Camp this year present some suggestive features. The highest honors in this particular among the regimental organizations go to the Twelfth, which had about 86 per cent. of its members present. The Twenty-second follows, with over 85 per cent., and then the Thirty-second and the Eighth."
1891-08-10T00:00:00Z,"One of the worst sections of the tariff law is that relating to hosiery. For over seven years the consumers in the United States had paid a protective duty of 40 per cent. upon all their imported hosiery, although the United States had no infant hosiery industry that needed protection. The average importations in that time grew from about $8,000,000 annually to about $12,000,000, foreign value."
1891-08-10T00:00:00Z,"The Constitution of the United States frowns upon titles and orders of nobility, yet there are many native-born Americans whose dignities range from the humbler orders of knighthood to the exalted rank of Princes. I am not now alluding to heiresses who have been raised to the peerage by marriage. These instances are already familiar to the public."

Upon her head is a band of feathers with red ribbons, and in her ears are rings of gold. The color gleams brown through her dusky cheeks, and she beckons as if she would talk with some one. I see her lips move. She speaks."

1891-08-10T00:00:00Z,"The recent splendid performance of the White Star liner Majestic, which unexpectedly and considerably lowered the record between Queenstown and New-York, has given a new impetus to transatlantic steamship races. The City of Paris is now speeding on her way to this port, and it is reasonably certain that the displaced champion of the Inman fleet will do her level best to regain her lost prestige."
1891-08-10T00:00:00Z,"A pathetic tale is that of Mary Ellen Johnson, the Liverpool ""bigamist,"" whose technical offense against the law has been purged by a sentence of one day's imprisonment -- or practically no imprisonment at all. In 1872, according to the uncontradicted statements of counsel, this ""middle-aged, respectably dressed person"" had the misfortune to marry a foreign sailor, who lodged with her for two years."
1891-08-10T00:00:00Z,"She was a Delsartean poem -- the lines all curves, the movement all rhythm. Her light-brown hair was wound high in a Greek coil and bound with silver chains -- a double fillet of tiny links through which a stray curl or two escaped. Her gown, a modified Empire, was of pale-blue silk shot with silver and draped with silver fringe."
1891-08-10T00:00:00Z,"WASHINGTON, Aug. 9. -- Immediately after the Fall elections, and probably by the second week in November, the Speakership contest will have begun in this city. Mr. Mills has already given notice of his intention to open headquarters about that time, and it is to be assumed that the other aspirants for the honor of presiding over the Fifty-second Congress will be here as early as the member from Texas."
1891-08-10T00:00:00Z,"The tenth volume of Mr. Ford's edition of the writings of Washington brings the dates down to 1785 and sees the great man released from the responsibilities of office.

The aged somnambulist on returning to the house found that he had crawled out of his chamber window and dropped to the ground without sustaining a scratch. He is as lively as a cricket and assists actively in farm work."

""Billy"" Tracy, the Hill loader and a member of the State Committee, will have to do some hard work to retain his own scalp, according to present indications, for the anti-Tracy Democrats are hot after him under the lead of Valentine Fleckenstein, who served President Cleveland's Administration in the capacity of Postmaster, and was afterward City Treasurer."
1891-08-10T00:00:00Z,"RICHFIELD SPRINGS, N.Y., Aug. 8. -- The rainstorm last Tuesday put a quietus on all the sports of the day, which included a bicycle tournament and a church fair. The ladies of St. John's Episcopal Church had their ice cream and sandwiches, pin-cushions and table-scarfs, all ready to look appetizing and ornamental, but they had to save their treasures until to-day for public inspection."
1891-08-10T00:00:00Z,"Attempts have been made recently to show by the hat-making industry that a high tariff has been beneficial to American workingmen, and it has been asserted that protection has maintained the wages of hatters in particular at a standard which nothing else could possibly have accomplished. As a matter of fact, no business is better calculated to demonstrate that tariffs are powerless to keep the compensation of labor up to a high point."
1891-08-10T00:00:00Z,"The chief characteristics of a midsummer ""first night"" are heat and noise. The heat cannot be helped; patent cooling machinery does very little to ameliorate its effect when there is a great crowd. The noise is made by the actors, who are sure to form a large proportion of the audience and to have friends on the stage."

Drew to-night forwarded to Secretary of the Treasury Foster a detailed statement of his work in connection with the Keystone National Bank.

1891-08-14T00:00:00Z,"One of the most remarkable features of Gov.

1891-08-16T00:00:00Z,"At a little shop in Broadway, where a popular actress leaves five-hundred-dollar orders, there is displayed such a fascinating assortment of the Summer girls gloves that even the prosaic, matter-of-fact young woman who couldn't be a Summer girl if she tried is tempted by them. It is an injustice to sneer at the Summer girl as a pictorial creation existing chiefly for the benefit of newspaper paragraphers."

1891-08-16T00:00:00Z,"Jean Marie Guyan, who died in 1887, aged barely thirty-three, was possessed of remarkable powers. While almost a lad, a work of his on the utilitarian moralists showed the peculiar bent of his mind, which was toward solving the leading problems of sociology. In the volume under notice, which treats of education, he, like Plato, tried to draw ""a distinct line of demarcation between the morality of impulse and the morality of thought."""

1891-08-16T00:00:00Z,"A significant feature of the real estate market for more than two months past is that nearly all the foreclosure sales have resulted in the property being bought in by the mortgagee, where the sale was not postponed for want of a purchaser or because the mortgagee did not feel like taking his chances in such a desperate market."
1891-08-16T00:00:00Z,"NEW-ORLEANS, Aug. 15. -- The New-York customs authorities, in recent interviews, charge the Custom House here with negligence, particularly in the matter of the admission of Chinamen not entitled to enter the country. It is possible that the same strict scrutiny exercised at Northern ports is not in vogue, not because the local officials are less vigilant, but because of their insufficiency of number and resources."

While they admit that the treaty is most favorable to the sugar-making interest, it leaves the important article of Cuba's product, tobacco, under the same onerous duties existing in the United States for so many years, and still further augmented by the McKinley bill."

1891-08-16T00:00:00Z,"Sensational reports have been circulated of late about cruel practices in the State prison at Clinton. Such reports affecting prison discipline get abroad every now and then, and are almost sure to become greatly exaggerated and to create false impressions.

1891-08-16T00:00:00Z,"The disappearance of the buffalo has been the fruitful occasion of much unreasonable sentiment. Men who never saw a buffalo except in a menagerie are especially given to lamentation. An Eastern paper recently gave up a column or more to one of the mourners, probably a woman, who srrowed with much satisfaction, because of the disappearance of large game from the face of the earth."
1891-08-16T00:00:00Z,"Mr. Beers still preserves his silence, apparently unable to utter a word in defense of the charges against him. His agents, who purchase the columns of newspapers, have temporarily ceased their labors in the face of Gov.

1891-08-16T00:00:00Z,"Ceramics is the name given to those productions of the potter's art that assist in forming the famous collections which now and then startle the world as objects of beauty and price.

Kimball's interesting account of Bulwer, I was reminded of an incident that happened in Parliament in July, 1855, which illustrates the great novelist's good humor and quickness of repartee. A kinsman, Mc-Hillingtleetcazley, member of Parliament for the North Riding of York from 1832 to 1862, had taken me into the House -- strangers' gallery -- and was showing me the celebrities."
1891-08-16T00:00:00Z,"A bull combination has done much more in the way of lifting the market the past week than seemed possible ten days ago. It is all professional, of course, but that goes for little, since all movements of the market are professional in their initiation.

1891-08-16T00:00:00Z,""" Perhaps it would be as well, Alonzo, not to dwell so constantly upon these personal matters. To be sure, there is an interest -- occasionally even a thrill -- connected with them which one does not feel in more intellectual subjects. Yet, notwithstanding this fact -- perhaps on account of it -- I'm convinced that the exercise of the reflective, rather than the emotional, faculties tends to develop mind."""

1891-08-16T00:00:00Z,"The statistics of the Census Bureau winch relate to the larger cities of this country are open to great suspicion on the score of accuracy in the individual cases, but in the comparisons between different cities they are most misleading, and from them scarcely any fair inference can be drawn."

LOUIS, Aug. 15. -- To-day came nearer to being a ""black Friday"" for the speculative wheat trader on this market than probably upon any other occasion in the history of the grain business of this city.

1891-08-16T00:00:00Z,"CHICAGO, Aug. 15. -- The session on the Board of Trade to-day was one of the wildest ever known on the floor. Greatly to the consternation of the bears, December wheat touched $1.08. They had been partly prepared for the boom Friday, but when the bulls took hold again and sent prices up once more they were dumfounded. Such jumps in the figures had not been seen since the days when Hutchinson was operating."

1891-08-19T00:00:00Z,"After two days of costly experience, the guileless Plattdeutschers, who are having their annual open-air carnival at Schuetzen Park, Union Hill, decided that there was actually a good deal of gambling going on, and that unless something was done the girls would have no jewelry left to set off their charms, and that Mynheer would have no money left to spend legitimately."

Barksdale, the Sub-Treasury candidate, has only 30 votes. This leaves 55 votes unaccounted for. It is hardly possible now for Barksdale to have more than 55 votes on joint ballot, while it looks as if George and Walthall will have over 120."

1891-08-20T00:00:00Z,"The situation in Germany seems to threaten a much more vigorous and sustained attack upon the corn duties than that which the Chancellor has thus far resisted with success.

1891-08-20T00:00:00Z,"Welch pitched for the New-Yorks yesterday, and they lost another game to Boston. The latter is in excellent form and playing remarkably fine ball. In the opening inning the visitors measured up the curving of the New-York pitcher, and they batted out 3 runs."

1891-08-21T00:00:00Z,"Recruiting ought not to be difficult nowadays for the French Navy. When Jack has such junketings as those at Cherbourg, Cronstadt, and Portsmouth this Summer he may well appear fond of his day and his calling. It is an inspiring reflection, also, that the French bluejackets are ready to fraternize alike with Russian and with British tars."
1891-08-21T00:00:00Z,"The country owes a debt of gratitude to President HARRISON for his statement at Albany regarding the currency, in response to the welcome of Gov. HILL.

Burnertt, granted an injunction to restrain Commissioner Heintz from carrying on improvements in One Hundred and Thirty-eighth Street, which, if finished as planned, would place a stone culvert over the Mott Haven Canal.

A building of good material solidly put together does not crumble and collapse utterly, even under the shock of a severe explosion, as this Park Place edifice plainly did."
1891-08-23T00:00:00Z,"The regret that we should say that the Democrats would feel in giving Major MCKINLEY a chance to make the silver issue prominent must be all the keener as they perceive-how weak he is on the issue of the tariff to which they ought to have shut him up. The moment he touches that he has to take the defensive, and his defense is feeble."
1891-08-23T00:00:00Z,"KINGSTON, N.Y., Aug. 22. -- Railroad men unite in saying that the present season has been the most successful in the history of the Catskill Summer boarding region. Last Saturday 1,100 persons were taken into the mountains by the Ulster and Delaware Railroad, and on the Saturday two weeks previous the number was 1,720."
1891-08-23T00:00:00Z,"The first championship games of the Long Island Amateur League were not very successful. Only a few hundred spectators were present, and the events, as a rule, were poorly contested."

1891-08-24T00:00:00Z,"PADUCAH, Ky., Aug. 23 -- Post Office Inspector Brown has been in this city for several days, and the outcome of his investigations will probably result in the dismissal, if not the arrest, of Postmaster Hugh Mulholland. Serious charges have been made against the Postmaster, and the indications are that these charges are far from groundless."
1891-08-24T00:00:00Z,"BAR HARBOR, Me., Aug. 23. -- The doubt that arose a day or two ago about President Harrison's coming is not yet settled. Evidently Secretary Tracy and those who wanted the President to come find him less easy to move than they had counted on. The Secretary early in the week told his friends that the President was coming."
1891-08-24T00:00:00Z,"WASHINGTON, Aug. 23. -- It is not expected in navy circles here that Rear Admiral Gherardi will be ousted from command of the North Atlantic station as long as he insists upon his right to serve out his three years."
1891-08-24T00:00:00Z,"A pamphlet bearing the title ""The American Question in Haiti"" has made its appearance in this city. It is by John D. Metzger -- at least his name is on the title page. He speaks highly of himself in his book, but declares that the articles on the Haitian question published in the New-York papers ""deserve very little attention."""
1891-08-24T00:00:00Z,"PLAINFIELD, N.J., Aug. 23. -- The extraordinary eagerness with which the ""Big Six"" of the Plainfield Common Council has pushed through the project to give a water works franchise to J.M. Low Co. of Kingston N.Y., has all along been viewed with great suspicion by the public, and it is expected that the litigation that is soon to be begun in the matter will bring to light some highly interesting developments."
1891-08-24T00:00:00Z,"SARATOGA, Aug. 23. -- President Harrison has spent another delightfully quiet day at the Grand Union Hotel. He remained in his room all day and received very few visitors. Several persons asked for him, but of the may that called few were invited in. The President read most of the time, and he was charmed to be allowed to enjoy the seclusion of his own room."
1891-08-24T00:00:00Z,"The friends of the present management of the New-York Life Insurance Company must feel, after reading Mr. Hornblower's statement, which was referred to in yesterday's TIMES, that it has done the company more harm than good. It has certainly placed Mr. Beers, who is Mr. Hornblower's commander in chief, in a more unenviable attitude than that which he formerly occupied."
1891-08-24T00:00:00Z,"Representatives from all the German Schuetzen Bunds of New-York and Brooklyn met yesterday afternoon in the New-York Saengerbunde Hall, 12 St. Mark's Place, to consider the arrangements for the great international shooting festival which it has been decided by the German societies to hold in this vicinity in 1892.

The news of this suit has been received in America with considerable merriment."

The performers struck about 8 o'clock for back wages. It was announced that there would be no performance and money would be refunded. The crowd became excited, cut the guy ropes, set the tent on fire, smashed seats and wagons, and cut up harness."
1891-08-24T00:00:00Z,"TRENTON, Aug. 23. -- The revolt against the bosses and their figurehead -- Mayor Haynes -- in Newark must make Gov. Abbett and his clique feel very uncomfortable. This revolt has three distinct and marked phases. People will not have Haynes because, in the first place, he is Haynes. They have had enough of Haynes as a personality all by himself."
1891-08-24T00:00:00Z,"POTTSVILLE, Penn., Aug. 23. -- A fearful cloudburst broke over Pottsville this afternoon, and the water poured down in torrents for an hour. The thunder and lightning were awful, the latter doing considerable damage."

Gaston explained that he only asked for the sum of $15,000 to carry over the first load of negroes."
1891-08-24T00:00:00Z,"We suppose that there is still surviving in the minds of some Republicans the impression implanted by the Tribune that Mr. LOWELL as a diplomatist was deficient in the ""American"" spirit. If any there be who retain this view, we commend them to the comments of the London Spectator of Aug. 15, on the occasion of Mr. LOWELL'S death. It says:"
1891-08-24T00:00:00Z,"The competitive trial of six-pounder rapid-fire guns, arranged by the Navy Department and soon to take place, is made doubly interesting since all three of the inventions invited to contest are American, while a substantial reward is offered for success in a Government contract for fifty of the pattern that furnishes the most desirable results."
1891-08-24T00:00:00Z,"The more the Rapid-Transit Commission's change of purpose in regard to the underground railroad in Broadway is considered, the more unaccountable it seems. When that route was decided upon it was declared that the ""general plan of construction"" below Forty-second Street was for a tunnel at such a depth that the surface would not be disturbed nor the foundations of buildings endangered."
1891-08-24T00:00:00Z,"ST. LOUIS, Aug. 23. -- St. Louis cotton factors do not fear the formation of a cotton trust by the Alliance. That organization's scheme is said to have been originated by Mr. E.M.

For on the first day of that month here will be unveiled a monument to the valor of the volunteers who went from this region to fight for the Union, a memorial of such of them -- and they were many -- who were destined to return never again."
1891-08-24T00:00:00Z,"PHILADELPHIA, Aug. 23. -- A thousand things are said and thousands more will be in explanation of the action of the Republican Convention at Harrisburg. But the main sense of it lies on the surface, and he who runs may read. The disasters of last year have weakened Senator Quay to such a degree that he is now struggling to keep his hold on the party."

1891-08-24T00:00:00Z,"The latest semi-official report from Bar Harbor is made by Senator HOAR, who says: ""Mr. BLAINE seems about as he has for some years past, in all respects."" Like the Delphic oracle and Bunsby's aphorism, the value of this report depends much on the interpretation and application of it. There are ""respects"" in which Mr. BLAINE ""for some years past"" has ""seemed"" to Senator HOAR an active but very disagreeable person."
1891-08-24T00:00:00Z,"Dreadful as were the first details of the destruction of the Taylor Building in Park Place, the lapse of nearly forty-eight hours has not served to modify or make them one whit the less shocking. That 100 people met a horrible death when the structure, numbered from 68 to 74, fell to the street and caught fire is almost beyond the possibility of a doubt."
1891-08-24T00:00:00Z,"The tired firemen had not had a chance to recover from the exertions they had been obliged to make at the Park Place disaster when another lively fire called them to prompt action early yesterday morning. This fire also had its fatal results, as it caused the death of the Assistant Foreman of Engine Company No. 27, James H. Shute, one of the oldest and best firemen in the department."
1891-08-24T00:00:00Z,"The appearance of the second of these two volumes gives occasion for a renewal of one's regrets at the poor health of Mr. Leslie Stephen.

The big crowd already on the ground was augmented by thousands of visiting farmers and residents of near-by coast resorts and towns."
1891-08-24T00:00:00Z,"Probity, astuteness, and courage were the distinctive qualities of the late Mr. George Jones of THE NEW-YORK TIMES. Those whose memories go back forty years can recall the news-vender of Albany on the old ""Museum"" corner. In two years from that time Mr. Jones established THE NEW-YORK TIMES and put into it his best life and work."
1891-08-24T00:00:00Z,"MOBILE, Ala., Aug. 23. -- The affairs in Choctaw County, where in the fanatical family of Robert Sims has come in conflict with the United States, promises to become of unusual prominence, by reason of the belief on the part of Sims's followers that Sims is the temporal manifestation of their God."
1891-08-24T00:00:00Z,"BINGHAMTON, N.Y., Aug. 23. -- The political cauldron in this county is boiling, and from present indications there will be a sharp fight between the two great political parties. As far as the Prohibition Party in this county is concerned, it does not amount to much. For several weeks an organizer has been at work endeavoring to proselyte the farmers, but the work has been fruitless."

MAYES, the present incumbent, over D.W. BUSHYHEAD and G.W. BENGE. As usual, fraud is charged; but should Chief MAYES make-good his claim, as he is likely to do, being elected on the face of the returns, he will serve a third successive term as Chief."
1891-08-25T00:00:00Z,"NEWPORT, Aug. 24. -- Mrs. William Astor gave a grand ball to-night in honor of Mr. and Mrs. John Jacob Astor, Jr. It was a very elaborate affair, fully equaling, if not eclipsing, any other event of this most brilliant social season. The cottagers, of course, all responded to their invitations and enjoyed the Astor hospitality, dispensed with that lavishness which is characteristic of the family."
1891-08-25T00:00:00Z,"Almost in the same locality that the Cunard steamship Servia broke down on her recent voyage from this port, the Hamburg-American liner Suevia was passed Saturday, with two blades of her propeller gone. It is a singular coincidence that the first news of the Suevia's mishap should be brought to this city by the vessel whose serious accident in the same locality caused so much excitement."
1891-08-25T00:00:00Z,"CINCINNATI, Aug. 24. -- By just 1 run the Giants won the game here to-day. Cincinnati hit Ewing hard enough to win any ordinary contest, but New-York came in with three hits in the seventh that scored 2 runs and won the game."

1891-08-25T00:00:00Z,"But little testimony of value concerning the cause of the disaster in Park Place has been added to that which was available yesterday morning. The evidence still tends to show that the building, already dangerously weak and greatly overweighted, yielded readily to the slight shock of what appears to have been an explosion of gases in or near the front part of the basement."
1891-08-25T00:00:00Z,"THE NEW-YORK TIMES continues the daily exposures of crookedness in the management of the New-York Life Insurance Company as if no libel suit for $1,000,000 damages had ever been brought by the company, and one is led to believe that THE TIMES has pretty good proof for what it publishes. According to its reports, statements to which President Beers swore are false in nearly all details, and have been so for many years."
1891-08-25T00:00:00Z,The latest official analysis of the water brought to New-York by the Croton Aqueduct has revealed so much contamination that it has determined the Board of Health to make a further examination of the Croton Basin. Of course it is essential to the health of the city that this examination should result in removing the causes of the contamination.

For several years past, he said, American cattle had been shipped in bond in considerable numbers through Canadian territory between one point and another within the United States, as between Detroit and Niagara."
1891-08-25T00:00:00Z,So much has been said in the New-York papers of late with regard to impurities in the city's water supply and the non-observance of the laws made for its protection that it seems only just that some plea be made in behalf of those who are so unfortunate as to possess homes along the streams and water courses chosen by the great metropolis for her water supply.
1891-08-25T00:00:00Z,"PLAINFIELD, N.J., Aug. 24. -- Search is being made by detectives for Ellen Brunn and her little daughter, who disappeared from their home in this city June 17.

Its fame in the remotest ages agrees with its gruesome shape, and as it comes into history in later centuries the supernatural clings to it, while its record of human action has many a chapter that is sinister."
1891-08-30T00:00:00Z,"UTICA, Aug. 29. -- A person earning to Oneida County to look over the political situation ought to provide himself with a quantity of disinfectants, for nowhere in the State, or, perhaps, in the country, is a city so thoroughly abandoned to and controlled by the very worst elements of society as is Utica.

Had the great success of Mr. De Mille's play been foreseen several months ago, it might have been possible to have secured longer time in this city. The piece might probably be kept on the boards from now until after the holidays."
1891-08-30T00:00:00Z,"If money be the root of evil, envy is the root of industrial discontent. The laborer is at war with his employer chiefly because he envies the apparently excessive rewards of his employer's investment and labor. The rewards are apparently excessive because hitherto there has been a plentiful lack of all exact information as to what employers' profits are."

1891-08-30T00:00:00Z,"When the best performers from the East and West come together in the Summer tournament known as the Grand Circuit it requires more than one test to show the relative merits of the horses. In the slower classes especially there are always new developments, and the first two or three encounters are pretty sure to keep all the speculators guessing."
1891-08-30T00:00:00Z,"SYRACUSE, Aug. 29. -- The proudest man in Central New-York to-day is John S. Kenyon, Clerk of the State Senate.

1891-08-30T00:00:00Z,It is hardly probable that the leaders of the dress reform crusade themselves expect the radical measures which they suggest to be adopted in their entirety.

Look!"" he exclaimed as he unstrapped and opened the creel. It was packed full of dressed fish."

1891-08-30T00:00:00Z,"The disposition to do business over the curbstone is apparently not confined to the New Street brokers. Reputable down-town merchants, contractors, and mendicants seem to be laboring under the impression that the city should grant them full scope in the public thoroughfares rent free. Most of the down-town streets are now so hampered with obstructions that pedestrians are obliged to exercise both ingenuity and dexterity in order to make their way from place to place."
1891-08-30T00:00:00Z,"The political outbreak in Nicaragua described in the papers of this city last Wednesday does not come as a surprise to any one acquainted with the state of political feeling in that country.

1891-08-30T00:00:00Z,"GIBRALTAR, Aug. 15. -- To have loitered two months in England may atone, in some degree, for the popular offense of having gone around the world, for of all the forms of infatuation affecting this generation, the most unreasonable is the mad desire to get from place to place in a given time. For purposes of intelligence, a bale of goods would do equally well and perhaps make the journey a little quicker."
1891-08-30T00:00:00Z,"THE TIMES deserves the sincere thanks of every honest man in the United States for its outspoken exposure of the deplorable state into which the American Navy has fallen.

A great fire had been lighted near the spring, but it would be fatal to remain about the light with the enemy in the outer circle of darkness."
1891-08-30T00:00:00Z,"AUBURN, N.Y., Aug. 29. -- In the two Democratic District Conventions held in this county to-day the anti-Hill faction had the best of it.

1891-08-30T00:00:00Z,"NEWBURG, N.Y., Aug. 29. -- Again the city is in peace and quietness. Once more have the ""Bill"" Brown heelers slunk away to their home on the river's bank at Sing Sing. Now that they are gone and that the battle is ended, perhaps it may prove an interesting question for Warden Brown to consider what he and his friends have gained by the political fight that was unnecessarily brought about."

If this is done Acting Admiral Walker cannot escape a court-martial. It is not seen how Secretary Tracy can ignore the matter now anyhow."

1891-08-30T00:00:00Z,"The call for next Thursday's meeting of the Citizens' anti-park-grab Committee of One Hundred at the Hotel Brunswick will probably reach the members of the committee to-morrow, and this will end the preliminary arrangements for the meeting. From the number of responses at hand from members of the committee it is confidently expected that the meeting will be well attended, and there is no doubt that it will be an earnest and business like gathering."

1891-08-31T00:00:00Z,"SHANGHAI, China, July 31. -- The recent additions made by the Chinese Government to its already large navy have caused much uneasiness among Japanese statesmen, and have brought forward prominently the suspicions which Japan always feels for China as its ever-threatening enemy.

1891-09-01T00:00:00Z,"It was a very agreeable surprise to the managers of the Coney Island Jockey Club to see so large a number of people at the track as were there yesterday.

1891-09-01T00:00:00Z,"Everybody must admit that trades unions have, upon the whole, conferred benefits upon the general mass of workmen in the trades in which they have been organized. The extent of these benefits depends upon the honesty and judgment with which the unions have been managed, and where these qualities have been wanting to their management, there are cases in which the union has inflicted injuries instead of conferring benefits."

1891-09-01T00:00:00Z,"It is a curious case that is presented by the claim of the owner of the racehorse Huron for ""second money"" in the Futurity Stakes, for it is a claim on behalf of an animal that was admitted to the race only in obedience to the order of a court, and that was not officially recognized as being in the race, and was not officially placed, though it is not disputed that he finished second."

1891-09-01T00:00:00Z,"The National Rifle Association begins today its annual prize meeting, which will last through the week.

1891-09-03T00:00:00Z,"Postmaster General WANAMAKER'S circular request to Postmasters at county seats to visit and inspect at their own expense and report on all the Post Offices in their respective counties is drawing down upon him a good deal of sharp criticism, especially in his own State, and from the papers and the Postmasters of his own party."
1891-09-03T00:00:00Z,"CLEVELAND, Sept. 2. -- Cleveland gained another easy victory to-day. The Brooklyns couldn't bat Viau, while the curves of Inks were not of a deceptive character. He was not hit hard, however, but the support given him was responsible for 5 of the 8 runs scored by Cleveland. The local players handled the ball in faultless style. Score:"
1891-09-03T00:00:00Z,"CHICAGO, Sept. 2. -- Anson won to-day, and he performed the act in the most approved style. In the opening inning the Colts touched up the curves of big Amos Rusie in a manner calculated to make him believe that his arm had lost its cunning. They continued the onslaught for three innings, when Rusie thought that he had enough and the heavy-weight battery retired."
1891-09-04T00:00:00Z,"The naval administration of Mr. HASON, which at one time gave such promise of good works, will pass into history under the shadow of a scandal of its own creation."

Nicholson, together with 500 or 600 residences, are but a mass of ruins."
1891-09-04T00:00:00Z,"KINGSTON, N.Y., Sept 3. -- More harmony prevails among the Republicans of Ulster County this Fall thus far than has been known before in many years, but it is expected that when the County Convention is held the Cornell-Coykendall-Sharpe feud will again manifest itself. This, which appears to politicians outside of Ulster County as a political feud, is, in reality, a family quarrel, and had its origin over a quarter of a century ago."
1891-09-04T00:00:00Z,"RED BANK, N.J., Sept. 3. -- Two of the representative yachts of the North Shrewsbury and the champion of the South Shrewsbury raced at Fair Haven this afternoon.

1891-09-04T00:00:00Z,"BERLIN, Sept. 3. -- A rather remarkable discovery has just been made by Dr. C.L. Sleich of this city. He was conducting experiments with a view to determining how weak a solution of cocaine would prove efficacious as a local anaesthetic in minor surgical operations, when he stumbled upon the fact that simple water injected under the skin with a syringe rendered the flesh at that point insensible to pain."
1891-09-04T00:00:00Z,"CLEVELAND, Sept. 3. -- The Giants finally won a game. By superior batting they defeated the local club here to-day. The New-Yorks used three pitchers in the game. Big John Ewing played for one inning and retired in favor of Clarkson. The latter pitched until the sixth inning, when Capt. Ewing thought it advisable to call on Rusie, who finished the contest."
1891-09-04T00:00:00Z,"VIENNA, Sept. 3. -- Emperor William of Germany, accompanied by Chancellor von Caprivi, at Horn this morning met Emperor Francis Joseph of Austria, who was accompanied by the King of Saxony, and the entire party, surrounded by brilliant military suites and escorts of cavalry, proceeded on horseback to the headquarters at Gopfritz of the Austrian Army engaged in the manoeuvres."
1891-09-04T00:00:00Z,"The investigation yesterday of the Park Place disaster was very interesting, although the conclusion to which the evidence pointed had been reached before. The testimony of the representative of the architects showed that the building was at the time of its fall, and had been for long time before its fall, very seriously overloaded."
1891-09-04T00:00:00Z,"SAN ANTONIO, Texas, Sept. 3. -- A Christenson, State Manager of the Wells, Fargo Co.

This afternoon the races were once more the chief attraction."

1891-09-04T00:00:00Z,"The convention acted wisely in confining its declarations in the main to State issues. The delegates showed their appreciation of Mr. CLEVELAND'S services and national leadership by their hearty cheers when his name was mentioned, but the platform did not refer to him, and there was no reason why it should refer to him. The demand for tariff reform and tax reduction is in line with the position of the party throughout the Union."
1891-09-04T00:00:00Z,"LOCKPORT, N.Y., Sept. 3. -- There was a lively time in the Republican First Assembly District Convention held here to-day. The delegates were overwhelmingly Platt-Hiscock, and the machine ran everything for the Administration. The Crowley-Journal faction was nowhere, and the few delegates who represented that side might just as well have staid at home."
1891-09-04T00:00:00Z,"WASHINGTON, Sept. 3. -- There is no doubt whatever that ""Dick"" Kerens and ""Jeff"" Chandler hope to see ""Steve"" Elkins made Secretary of the Interior, if they can induce President Harrison to transfer Secretary Noble to the War Office. At all events, Elkins feels sure of a Cabinet place, extraordinary as that assertion may appeal."
1891-09-04T00:00:00Z,"The Young Men's Benevolent Association and the railroad employes of this city found that both had obtained Sulzer's Harlem River Park for their picnics Sept. 5.

1891-09-04T00:00:00Z,"CHICAGO, Sept 3. -- A dispatch from Omaha, Neb., says that in railroad circles yesterday it was rumored that receivership papers for the Union Pacific Railroad would be filed before night. John M. Thurston, General Attorney for the line, when questioned merely said that nothing would occur that day. Further he wound say nothing. All other officers declare their ignorance of the whole matter."

Three stakes were competed for, the largest, worth $5,000, going to Bermuda Boy rom Illinois. He won easily, as did Position in the three-year-old event. The race for foals of 1887 was better contested, the favorite, Greenlander Boy, failing to get a heat."
1891-09-04T00:00:00Z,"ALBANY, Sept. 3. -- Two Republican District Conventions were held here to-day, and only served to complicate matters relative to the choice of State Committeeman. Both delegations to the State Convention are for Thomas C. Platt."

They captured by a substantial majority the city caucuses which elected delegates to the Senatorial convention to be held next Saturday."
1891-09-04T00:00:00Z,"While the advance of about 50 per cent. in the price of fruit jars is due in part to an increased demand for them and to the fact that the output of the factories in the last manufacturing season was below the average, the following paragraph which was published a few weeks ago in the Iron Age should not be overlooked:"
1891-09-04T00:00:00Z,"The Republican primary elections, at which delegates were chosen to the Republican State Convention, were held in all the Assembly districts of this city yesterday, with the exception of the Twenty-fourth.

1891-09-04T00:00:00Z,"HARRISBURG, Penn., Sept. 3. -- A glance over the four hundred and fifty-odd delegates to the Democratic State Convention who slowly gathered in the Opera House this morning showed that the body was mostly composed of men new to State Conventions.

The special pleasure of evicting Banta was delegated to the President."

1891-09-04T00:00:00Z,"It does not require much stimulation to set people in Europe to thinking upon the chances of war. The anniversary of Sedan and the coincidence of it with the Austrian manoeuvres, in which the Emperor of Germany will take part, have set people all over Europe to talking and writing upon the prospect. The contrast of tone between the German and the French press is very marked."
1891-09-04T00:00:00Z,"ALBANY, Sept. 3. -- The Committee on Platform of the Prohibition Convention reported at the beginning of the session to-day, and the platform was adopted without amendment.

1891-09-05T00:00:00Z,"The firm and vigorous manner in which the Philadelphia Ledger takes its stand on the side of good government and the Democratic ticket this year in Pennsylvania is extremely creditable to that journal, and is full of meaning as to the situation. It requires a great deal of provocation to make the Ledger veer from its course of faithful support for the party with which it has been so long and so honorably connected."
1891-09-05T00:00:00Z,"BALTIMORE, Sept. 4. -- The strongest kind of language has been used by Republicans here to-day and the Federal office holders have been excoriated unmercifully. It is the general opinion that, in their efforts to fix things for Harrison in 1892, they have disgraced the party and completely demoralized its organization. Col. William J. Van Nort persists in his determination to withdraw if Mr. Wescott accepts the Chairmanship of the State Central Committee."
1891-09-05T00:00:00Z,"TOPEKA, Kan., Sept. 4. -- The wholesale grocers of Hutchinson, Wichita, and Salina are having a hearing before the Board of Railroad Commissioners upon their complaints of excessive freight charges on carload lots of sugar.

1891-09-05T00:00:00Z,"It was a tame day's sport at the Coney Island track yesterday, without any particular sensation other than the constantly-recurring defeats of the favorites, but this has become common that it passes without much notice.

1891-09-05T00:00:00Z,"Whatever may be the result of the New-York department's investigation, the Board of Trustees of the New-York Life Insurance Company has already been brought before the bar of public opinion and condemned. The evidence so far adduced proves conclusively that the members of the board are unfit guardians of policy holders' interests."
1891-09-05T00:00:00Z,"A gentleman long familiar with Mr. A.D. White said to me recently: ""Mr. White is a man whom politicians regard as a scholar and whom scholars regard as a politician."" The remark was not original, though its application may have been. A review of Mr. White's public career will show that his appearance in politics has often been as disastrous to his party as unfortunate to himself."

1891-09-05T00:00:00Z,"ALBANY, N.Y., Sept. 4. -- The suggestion of the name of Gen. Benjamin F. Tracy for the nomination for Governor by the Republicans is not looked upon with favor by the leaders here. That there is some reason for the announcement from Rochester that Gen.

1891-09-05T00:00:00Z,"ELMIRA, N.Y., Sept. 4. -- The liveliest disturbance in the Republican Convention will proceed from the Chemung delegation. The spouting geyser of the Yellowstone will be as nothing to it. Chemung is the home of Collector Fassett. Emulating the example of his worthy preceptor, Mr. Platt, Fassett has been battering the party in this Senatorial district out of shape with a club. He has made himself obnoxious to many of the best Republicans."

1891-09-05T00:00:00Z,"How very loose is the tie that binds the so-called ""People's Party"" together is shown by the extremely varied treatment accorded in different parts of the Union to the Sub-Treasury idea. This was put forward in the Ocala platform not merely as a cardinal principle of the Farmers' Alliance, but as the one to which all others were to be subordinated."
1891-09-05T00:00:00Z,"The quarrel between authors and publishers is as old as Grubb Street, and it is not probable that the article of a New-York publisher in the September Forum will convince any author with a grievance that the relations between the two are equitable. There are, however, some minor infelicities in the relations of writers for the periodical press and their editors which it may do more good to discuss."

SMITH TURNER, or, as he would be called in this country, Dr. TURNER, starts out with the assertion that there can be no doubt of the serious deterioration of modern teeth.

1891-09-06T00:00:00Z,"RONDOUT, Sept. 5. -- Fruitmen in the Hudson River Valley are almost discouraged. The peach crop, which was expected to return a remunerative reward, has not thus far paid the expense of shipment. The fruit has been large and of characteristic flavor, yet the markets have been so glutted that the price per basket returned by the sales agent has put the producer in debt."
1891-09-06T00:00:00Z,"Even the long-suffering taxpayers of Long Island City are confounded at the audacity of Mayor Gleason's Board of Assessors, which has completed the labor of designating how much each citizen shall be mulcted for the support of the gang for the next twelve months.

1891-09-06T00:00:00Z,"Spanking the hydrophobia out of a boy with a wooden splint is not exactly in accord with established usage and traditions, but the experiment is, nevertheless, meeting with gratifying success at the Presbyterian Hospital.

The tone of the official press here indicates distinctly that the Government is averse to joining England in any hasty remonstrance against the Porte's agreement with Russia."

1891-09-06T00:00:00Z,In the Austrian manoeuvres now going on bicycles are said to be playing a conspicuous part by the carrying of dispatches.

They also ask to have some places suggested where such pleasure can be indulged in. They also wish to know what rifles it would be best to take along. This sounds a little formidable, and the query about the rifles savors of expectation of big game if not of an Indian expedition."
1891-09-06T00:00:00Z,The Park Place disaster has certainly opened the eyes of the people of this city to a realizing sense of the necessity of doing something to prevent a repetition of such a horror.

Fow was somewhat disgruntled to-day when he read in THE TIMES an article from Harrisburg in which allusion was made to the perfunctory examination to which State Treasurer Boyer was subjected by the Legislative investigating committee appointed to examine into the workings of the State Treasury and devise a plan for improving the method of auditing the accounts of the Commonwealth."

1891-09-07T00:00:00Z,"Mr. Harrison is like that vase which the poet declared would throw off the scent of the rose though smashed into innumerable pieces; the odor of sanctity hangs round him wherever he may be; he is always and everywhere a Presbyterian and he doesn't care who knows it. We have his word for this, or, which is the same thing, the word of the Indianapolis Journal, his organ."
1891-09-07T00:00:00Z,"After having plays d fast and loose for three months with the Gubernatorial boom of Mayor Alfred C.

The London stock market was open, and traders in American stocks there -- on their own account or under cable orders -- were making quotations. And what London was to do, it was pretty generally felt, would give the direction to stocks here for the rest of the week at least."
1891-09-08T00:00:00Z,"The machine-made ""harmony"" of the Republican Convention is naturally the subject of a good deal of comment by the Democratic papers, but it would do their party no harm in this State if they would apply the same standard of criticism to its condition. It is not true, as asserted by the Republican journals, that HILL'S control of his party is more absolute than PLATT'S control of his."
1891-09-08T00:00:00Z,"In the easiest possible manner the Brooklyns defeated the Chicagos in the opening game yesterday.

1891-09-08T00:00:00Z,"A radical change in the character of the operas to be produced at the Casino is announced by Mr. Rudolph Aronson. Hitherto burlesque operettas have been the feature of that house. For some time the question of giving more ambitious works at the Casino has occupied Mr. Aronson's attention. The successes in Germany and Austria have recently been confined to works which contained good music, with just enough comedy and no more."

1891-09-08T00:00:00Z,"Despite the proof afforded by the Fassett appointment that a close alliance has been formed between Mr. HARRISON and PLATT, the latter is still strongly suspected of being a firmer friend of Mr. BLAINE than of the President, and ready to serve the old love before he is off with the new.

Before the beginning of the campaign it was their habit to tell the people that the effect of a high duty was to reduce the price of the protected goods in the home market and that the duties were paid by the foreign manufacturers."
1891-09-08T00:00:00Z,Importers of dry goods in this city discuss the delays and annoyances attendant upon the passage of their goods through the Custom House from different standpoints.

1891-09-08T00:00:00Z,"The popular and a large part also of the professional interest in the current European military manoeuvres once more centres, as last year, on the employment of smokeless powders. The old experiences of Champigny, Hanover, and Ammerstein have been renewed at Gopfritz, and while the absence of much of the noise and more of the dense smoke customary on battlefields strikes all spectators, the effect on tactical movements is a special study for soldiers."
1891-09-08T00:00:00Z,"Locking the stable door after the horse has been stolen is proverbially held not to indicate a high degree of efficiency, but it is at least less inefficient than a failure to dock the stable door after a robbery when there are more horses left in the stable.

1891-09-08T00:00:00Z,"Labor's official holiday found general observance yesterday with a general suspension of business and a wholesale exodus of the population to the Summer amusement resorts.

1891-09-09T00:00:00Z,"Mr. FASSETT'S candidacy was put before the people twenty-four hours too soon. That was one of Mr. PLATT'S mistakes.

There is no place on earth which has not a ""devil's cave,"" and in the way of ""punch bowls"" he is well supplied, but some eminent and accurate geographer has discovered in the Red Sea the ""devil's mouth."""
1891-09-20T00:00:00Z,"To the minds of some people the fact that the late Ambrose H. Monell was heavily in debt to ex-Sheriff James A. Flack, furnishes a partial explanation of how he became involved in the notorious Flack case. All through the case, Monell, then a Justice of a civil court, was the legal adviser of Sheriff Flack."
1891-09-20T00:00:00Z,"SYRACUSE, N.Y., Sept. 19. -- There has been a great deal of life and excitement at Syracuse University since it opened last Thursday. The freshman class is larger than that of last year, and represents almost every State in the Union. Dr. Charles J. Little has gone to Evanston, Ind. Three new professors have been appointed -- Mace history and political science; Hargitt, biology, and Emmons, Greek."
1891-09-20T00:00:00Z,The notion that Mr. BELDEN may be pacified in his known disgruntlement at the results of the Republican State Convention by the offer of a place in Mr. HARRISON'S Cabinet ought to be a preposterous one. It is not inconceivable that Mr. HARRISON should use a Cabinet office to purchase political support for a renomination.
1891-09-20T00:00:00Z,"The utterances of the London Standard upon questions of foreign policy may fairly be taken as representing the opinions of Lord SALISBURY'S Government. From the remarks of the Standard it is quite clear that the ""picnic"" upon the Island of Mitylene, though really a picnic and not an armed occupation, was, so to speak, an inspired picnic, and was intended as a political demonstration."
1891-09-20T00:00:00Z,"There is little likelihood of any large war ships being authorized to be built for the navy in the next two years. This fact is known not only to the Secretary of the Navy, but to shipbuilders in general. The coming House is a Democratic one. It has staring it squarely in the face the reckless expenditures of the Fifty-first Congress."
1891-09-20T00:00:00Z,"When one can be a mouse in the corner at a gathering of young women a vast amount of valuable information is gleaned. The dear girls do not mind in the least telling a joke on themselves, and have no hesitancy whatever in avowing all sorts of little feminine artifices, on the principle, probably, that there are no secrets among ""professionals."" And this is what floated through an open door the other day:"
1891-09-20T00:00:00Z,"The opinion is expressed by an observer, whose knowledge of the public taste is not to be questioned, that ""Niobe,"" the farce now current at the Bijou Theatre, is ""over the heads of the people."" It does not draw as many spectators in the upper galleries as an ordinary farce. This is valuable information. From it people of moderate intelligence may learn why the American theatre is what it is."
1891-09-20T00:00:00Z,"HAMILTON, Ohio, Sept. 19. -- Hamilton's grand centennial ended this evening with the finest display of fireworks ever seen in Ohio.

Thousands upon thousands of persons are here, every State in the Union and countries abroad being represented by large delegations of ex-Hamiltonians."
1891-09-20T00:00:00Z,"In many respects the most noteworthy amateur athletic event that has ever been witnessed in this country was the first annual carnival of sports held all day yesterday on the new Manhattan Field, under the auspices of the Manhattan Athletic Club. Fifteen thousand people, at a conservative estimate, spent an entire day and evening applauding the contests of strong and agile young men."
1891-09-20T00:00:00Z,"Not the least of the results growing out of the recent inter-State rifle matches at Creedmoor and at Washington, in the District of Columbia, is the influence which the enterprise and undertaking of the Twenty-third Regiment is likely to exert in the matter of the selection of teams to hereafter represent the State of New-York in the Hilton Trophy and matches of a kindred nature."
1891-09-20T00:00:00Z,"BOSTON, Sept. 19. -- Ceres and Pomona have held high court in Horticultural Hall this week, and their triumphal display, continuing through Tuesday, Wednesday, and Thursday, drew out that portion of the community that is especially interested in the fine art of horticulture. The vegetables and fruits made an uncommonly fine appearance, too."
1891-09-20T00:00:00Z,"LENOX, Mass., Sept. 19. -- The boat parade had to be abandoned because there were so many arrangements to be made beforehand. There are many things to do and the ladies have thought they would not be able to get things together. The last week has been extremely lively with luncheons, teas, dinners, dancing parties, and the coach parade in Pittsfield."

1891-09-21T00:00:00Z,"With the sealing season practically over, attention will now be directed to the reports of the experts sent to Bering Sea by the British Government and our own to investigate the fisheries. The main conclusion reached by the two American Commissioners, Profs. MENDENHALL and MERRIAM, seems to be that the current agreement prohibiting the wasteful and indiscriminate open sea hunting must be continued for several years more to preserve the seals from extermination."
1891-09-21T00:00:00Z,"PRINCETON, N. J., Sept. 20. -- Dr. W. H.

1891-09-21T00:00:00Z,"TRENTON, N.J., Sept. 20. -- The spirit of the citizens of Newark is beginning to assert itself all over the State. The local struggle against the oppression of the bosses brings into bolder relief the iron-bound autocracy Gov. Abbett has established all over his empire. What Boss James Smith, Jr., is to Newark the Governor is to the Commonwealth. The imperialism which one applies to local affairs the other applies to State affairs."
1891-09-21T00:00:00Z,"Policeman Charles Schneider of the Union Market squad is in a fair way to be stripped of his badge and buttons, unless they are fastened by a thread of political influence too strong to be broken. Schneider used to be attached to the Mercer Street squad. He was there for three years, and in that time complaints for drunkenness, being off post, , were lodged against him fifteen occasions."

Great uneasiness is felt in Camargo. Camargo and Mier are patrolled by citizens. The soldiers are absent and the revolutionists take arms, horses, and provisions promiscuously."
1891-09-21T00:00:00Z,"The light of theosophy is waning in England, partly, it must be supposed, because that cult never really met any long-felt want, and partly because Mrs. ANNIE BESANT and Mr. BURROWS, who, since the death of Mme. BLAVATSKY, have been the most prominent of all theosophic adepts, have refused to submit their occult powers to rational investigation and such tests as non-believers wished to apply to them."
1891-09-21T00:00:00Z,"Newspapers, letters, and reports from all parts of the world indicate the profound impression produced by THE TIMES'S exposures of the management of the New-York Life Insurance Company. The excitement is not confined to any special locality. From the Atlantic to the Pacific in this country, in Mexico, Central and South America, the West Indies, Canada, and Europe, the press literally teems with the New-York Life scandals."
1891-09-21T00:00:00Z,"BUFFALO, Sept. 20. -- An astonishing revelation of German solidarity and strength of numbers was furnished here to-day. Apparently it was arranged as a fitting forerunner of the great congress of German-American Catholics which begins proceedings to-morrow. The announcement had been made that a new Catholic church was to be dedicated, but little or nothing appeared beforehand to indicate an affair of magnitude or novel significance."

1891-09-21T00:00:00Z,"LONDON, Sept. 14. -- Properly to follow what has happened and is happening in Russia, not to speak of the still more impressive events to come, one must first of all realize that all over the empire the administrative power is above the law. It is by the failure to comprehend this that men even of Mr. Goldwin Smith's intellectual rank are led to write and print misleading and mischievous nonsense about Russo-Jewish matters."
1891-09-21T00:00:00Z,"The anxiety expressed in some quarters lest the well-known pro-British sympathies of the new Queen of Hawaii should lead to an attempt at the seizure of the archipelago by England seems to be rather needless. Although the death of her husband, Gov. DOMINIS, a native of Massachusetts, has perhaps left her still more susceptible to British influence, it is not to be supposed that she wishes to exchange her sovereignty for foreign vassalage."
1891-09-21T00:00:00Z,"Special dispatches from Valparaiso, Chile, to the New-York Herald, published yesterday, state that ex-President Balmaceda, of the Chilean Republic, committed suicide at Santiago Saturday by shooting himself through the temple."
1891-09-21T00:00:00Z,"If Senator SHERMAN was at his home in Mansfield on Saturday and heard the address of ex-Speaker MILLS, he must have felt that an opponent of no mean rank was contesting his State with him. Mr. MILLS with admirable candor and effectiveness approached the silver question straight in front."
1891-09-21T00:00:00Z,"The details of Brooklyn politics in both parties are pretty well known to those of our readers who have followed the subject in our news columns. Since the County of Kings presented a candidate to each party, who was with unflattering promptness rejected by the convention, the politicians in each party seem to be bound to show that their zeal is not chilled."

The first suit was for $1,000,000. Together they make $1,750,000. This is plain enough, though it might not jibe with some of President Beers's arithmetic.

Boody is already a member of Congress from the Second Congressional District, but will undoubtedly obey his party's call to assume the Mayoralty, should he be elected to that office, of which we take it there is no doubt.

1891-10-11T00:00:00Z,""" Thermidor"" has been the one new play of the week. As good a play would be welcome every week. Perhaps, however, ""Thermidor"" is not quite as brisk and effective in action as it might have been if Sardou had finished it when he began it twenty years ago.

1891-10-12T00:00:00Z,"Dr. Schliemann's rule was to acquaint the world with his discoveries as soon as they were made. This was in certain respects an excellent plan, for it served to keep alive the public interest in his labors. It had the drawback, however, that he was continually compelled in his later publications to modify or contradict opinions set forth in his earlier ones."

The management of the theatre attached all the box-office receipts and the scenery, which belonged to Miss Eastlake."
1891-10-12T00:00:00Z,"Boston, blissful in the possession of her bifold championship in baseball, might excusably leave to Philadelphia the task of showing what America can do at cricket. However, she is to try her fortune to-day against Lord HAWKE'S team, and perhaps will improve on New-York and Baltimore. The matches of English visitors in Boston hitherto have been rather notable for low scoring on both sides."
1891-10-12T00:00:00Z,"LONDON, Oct. 11. -- Discount was not in demand the past week. Quotations were: Three months, 3 short, 1 34. The abundance of money, increased by the release of quarterly dividends, delays an advance of the Bank of England rate, but the ebbing away of gold to America and the Continent may necessitate a rise any day, and, under the best circumstances, it cannot be long delayed."

1891-10-12T00:00:00Z,"The Rev. R. Heber Newton returned to his pulpit at All Souls' Church yesterday. The congregation that greeted him filled the church. His sermon hinged on the consecration of Phillips Brooks as a Bishop. He said that the consecration of the foremost man in the American Church to the highest office in the Church, after an opposition unparalleled in tone and temper, naturally focalized thought upon the subject of that office."

There are but three weeks more of work on the stump, and it seems quite likely that fully one-half of the voters of the State have decided what party they will cast their lot with."
1891-10-12T00:00:00Z,The Board of Health in Philadelphia has begun an inquiry concerning the sale of the milk of consumptive cows in that city.

1891-10-12T00:00:00Z,"When Congress meets in December one of its first duties should be to investigate the colossal mismanagement of the census by Robert P. Porter. The Civil Service Reform League has shown how partisan considerations determined the selection of many of the enumerators and subordinates, and the flagrant injustice done New-York in the count has been proved; but these are really minor matters compared with the disappearance of $8,000,000, with very little to show for it."
1891-10-13T00:00:00Z,"ROCHESTER, N.Y., Oct. 12. -- Jacob H. Myers was nominated to-day by the Democratic Senatorial Committee of the Twenty-ninth District for Senator to succeed Donald McNaughton.

The ex-Congressman says:"
1891-10-18T00:00:00Z,"The attitude of the Evening Post in regard to the campaign in this State is certainly anything but consistent.

1891-10-25T00:00:00Z,"WASHINGTON, Oct. 24. -- Capt. F.A.

1891-10-25T00:00:00Z,"THE TIMES has several times called to the attention of President Beers of the New-York Life the fact that the best is always the cheapest in the end. Of life insurance and life insurance contracts this is especially true. Policies sold at enormous rebates are always devised with actuarial cunning, to draw from the insured far more than the rebate offered in selling him."

Platt imegines that he has lulled the Kings County Democracy to sleep by his little trick of putting up a weak city and county ticket he will find that he has been very much mistaken or has taken some very bad counsel.

To quote one of the Faculty:"

1891-10-25T00:00:00Z,"It is not necessary to repeat the arguments, now so familiar, that the absolute protection of the secrecy of the ballot is distinctly in the interest of the Democratic Party. The reason is obvious. That party includes a large proportion of the voters who are liable to intimidation by those upon whom they depend for employment, and subject to temptation, on account of their poverty, to sell their votes."

1891-10-26T00:00:00Z,"Mr. ANDREW D. WHITE evidently does not share the view of some of his friends that national issues have nothing to do with this year's election in New-York.

1891-10-27T00:00:00Z,"An event has just happened in St. Louis which shows both how easy and how dangerous it is for an ecclesiastic to be wholly out of touch with public opinion. Archbishop KENRICK, a good prelate, who has never aroused any unnecessary antagonisms, is about to celebrate his ""golden jubilee,"" and his Vicar General has taken this occasion to excite an antagonism that is perfectly unnecessary and very threatening."
1891-10-27T00:00:00Z,"The Board of General Appraisers decided the great worsted case yesterday, and decided it in accordance with the prediction of THE TIMES, in favor of the importers. The invoices were sustained in every instance, except in the few in which 5 per cent. commissions were deducted from the cost of the goods, and in those cases the only change was to allow the deduction of 2 1/2 per tout. instead of 5."

1891-10-27T00:00:00Z,"HARRISBURG, Penn., Oct. 26. -- The Senate retraced its steps to-night, and in spite of the fact that it had agreed to the introduction of testimony in the McCamant case and spent three long sessions last week in listening to the evidence taken before the majority committee, it decided by a strict partisan vote to take up the Boyer case to-morrow and hear counsel for the defense."

RIBOT, the Minister of Foreign Affairs, to the French Chamber of Deputies yesterday, touching affairs in Egypt, Morocco, and Italy, are reported to have been received with applause, particularly by members of the Left. But they were certainly vague."

1891-10-27T00:00:00Z,When Secretary Foster issued his recent order which allows Mr. Thomas C. Platt's rag disinfecting machine to levy tribute from rag importers he interfered with the perfect working of so many State laws that his action has caused a great deal of surprise on the part of those who are at all familiar with the quarantine law.
1891-10-27T00:00:00Z,"The indications are that party lines will be rather closely drawn in the Massachusetts election this year, and the question is whether that line will run in a new place. The Democrats are undoubtedly united and enthusiastic in support of their candidates, but they need the help of a good many who have not heretofore been Democrats."
1891-10-27T00:00:00Z,"BUFFALO, N.Y., Oct. 26. -- The beginning of the new fast-train service of the New-York Central and Hudson River Railroad this morning, from New-York to Buffalo, was a success in every way. The train, which is to be called Empire State Express, left New-York with almost every seat taken, and among the most interested passengers was a Chinaman, who seemed to enjoy every minute that the train was wheeling up the Hudson River route."
1891-10-27T00:00:00Z,"The Board of Estimate and Apportionment considered the estimates of the Park Department yesterday. Last year's appropriation was $907,863.32.

Nearly everything that takes rank as a connecting link between past and present is, however, locked up safely from prying eyes and itching fingers. The corps of cadets possesses a single relic, which it holds in fee simple and looks upon with undimmed pride."
1891-10-27T00:00:00Z,"OTTAWA, Ontario, Oct. 26. -- If the average Canadian were asked what he knows about Leadville he would be able at least to say that it is a well-known mining camp in the United States; but ask him where and what is kootenay, and there is act one chance in ten that he will know that it is a new mining field in British Columbia, often now referred to by Americans as a second Leadville."
1891-10-27T00:00:00Z,For every promise made there must come a time for its fulfillment.

WHITE is published expressing the writer's ""hearty good wishes for the success of Mr. FASSETT and the Republican ticket,"" and giving some reasons for entertaining such wishes.

1891-10-27T00:00:00Z,"WASHINGTON, Oct. 26. -- Without having received any additional information from Chile, and in the absence of any news justifying a prolongation of the ""war feeling"" that was rather prematurely encouraged for a day or two by the Administration, it was decided to-day that it would be becoming and dignified to await the action of Chile, upon the requests of our Minister to that republic, before proceeding to hostilities to compel reparation and indemnity."
1891-10-27T00:00:00Z,"FOO-CHOO, China, Sept. 28. -- The Chinese Government has decided to begin an establishment for the instruction of Chinese naval officers in the handling of modern torpedoes and for the manufacture of these weapons for the supply of the war ships and defense of the coast cities.

The demand is no informal suggestion that the Government at Washington expects some kind of satisfaction for the killing and wounding of the Baltimore's sailors."
1891-10-27T00:00:00Z,"I had a letter in preparation in regard to what, to me, seems practical as to the duty of those who, with myself, so ardently desire real ballot reform, when my attention was called to the able letter of Gov. Chamberlain in this morning's TIMES. He expresses my own ideas so much more forcibly than I possibly could that it seems superfluous for me to furnish it."
1891-10-27T00:00:00Z,"PARIS, Oct. 26. -- In the Chamber of Deputies to-day M. Deloncle interpellated the Ministers, asking them to explain their policy toward Egypt, the position they had taken on the questions at issue with Morocco in the matter of the Touat cases and the alleged British intrigues on the Tonqnin frontier.

1891-10-27T00:00:00Z,"INDEPENDENCE, Iowa, Oct. 26. -- This week closes the meeting at the kite-shaped track here, and two of the three events set for to-day were decided. It was bright and clear, but the wind increased to a gale and greatly handicapped the horses coming down the last half."
1891-10-27T00:00:00Z,"The ballot-reform issue figured very little in the speeches, and that altogether with reference to the past. Gov. HILL was condemned for the paster-ballot device, and the credit of favoring the genuine form of Australian ballot was claimed for the Republicans. But this question has assumed a new phase with reference to the future, and is worthy of a little discussion."
1891-10-27T00:00:00Z,"The last week of the campaign in Brooklyn promise to be a very lively one in the matter of meetings. Over seventy will be held before the week close on Saturday night, and of these forty will be under Democratic auspices.

1891-10-27T00:00:00Z,"A clever swindler who has been passing himself off largely in Brooklyn, and to some extent in this city, as Count Roderick von Graff of Russia has taken a hasty departure for parts unknown. The immediate cause of his departure was the detection of a well-planned scheme of his to negotiate about $50,000 worth of forged notes."
1891-10-27T00:00:00Z,"Last week seemed to carry as far as could be expected the breaking of records on what must be called the ""trotting"" turf, though two of the most remarkable records were those made by the pacer Direct, one of the fastest miles ever paced in a race, and the other of the three fastest consecutive heats ever made in harness."

1891-10-27T00:00:00Z,"Of course, the Republican meeting in the attractive Madison Square Garden, which is well worth seeing when there is no charge for admission, was a large one, and there was considerable display of party enthusiasm, but the speaking was of a singularly ineffective order. Mr. WARNER MILLER did not seem to feel at home, and his address was a painfully labored effort."
1891-10-27T00:00:00Z,"NOHWICH, Conn., Oct. 6. -- A good idea of the extraordinary lateness of the Fall in Connecticut is furnished by the fact that there has been no frost as yet severe enough to kill flowers and garden plants. The grass is still green in Connecticut pastures and mowing lots, and the foliage of forest trees is almost as heavy it was in August."
1891-10-27T00:00:00Z,"Wall Street had a blue Monday yesterday. There was little activity and not much strength shown in anything. Two or three specialties rose and one or two went off easily, but as a whole the market showed only sluggishness."

1891-10-28T00:00:00Z,The great Democratic meeting of the business men of New York in Madison Square Garden last night was mainly an exhibition of interest in the political campaign and a display of enthusiasm for the party cause.

Hill will make the principal speech."

After a second hearing, it is possible to arrive at something like a definite conclusion in regard to the merits of those two musicians.

This was the rumor that flashed from one end of the city to the other to-day, following upon the statement made editorially in the Government organ, the Empire, last evening, that he need look for no promotion in the Cabinet, but would have to remain Secretary of State and clear up the irregularities of his department."

The trouble is vexatious enough as it stands, and a proper and creditable disposition of it will not be promoted by treating it in a partisan spirit."

Much has already been accomplished toward the erection of the mammoth exhibition palaces."

1891-10-31T00:00:00Z,"WASHINGTON, Oct. 30. -- A dead silence has settled down over the State Department as to the Chilean affair. It extends beyond and rests upon the Junta Legation.

1891-10-31T00:00:00Z,To-day's test of ship armor on the new Naval Ordnance Proving Grounds at Indian Head will be one of the most important ever held.

1891-10-31T00:00:00Z,"Mr. DEPEW has repeated his attack upon one of the pet doctrines of his party's chief organ in this city -- the doctrine that after the cost of goods has been increased to the manufacturer and the wholesale merchant by an increase of tariff duties, ""the individual consumer"" is not required to pay a higher price, because the manufacturer and the wholesale merchant cheerfully pay the increase out of their own pockets."
1891-10-31T00:00:00Z,"The recommendation of Col. WILSON, the Superintendent of the Military Academy, that an increase should be made in the number of cadets takes the form of proposing a restoration of the President's privilege of appointing ten cadets at large each year.

1891-11-01T00:00:00Z,"Interest in the real estate market is now con fined almost entirely to city property. So little is heard about suburban sales that the market for this class of property may be said to have disappeared. There is nothing unexpected in this condition because the suburbs always cease to be of interest to real estate buyers at this time of year, and they do not excite attention again until the Spring season is well underway."

1891-11-01T00:00:00Z,"THE ARMADA. -- The squadron first seen consisted of the Queen's ships under Lord Howard; the others were Drake and the privateers. The breeze rose rapidly.

It now admits that the Democratic platform does not declare ""in terms"" against a blanket-ballot amendment, but insists that it does so ""by implication."" Now, as we have several times pointed out, what it declares against ""in terms"" is ""any effort to hamper or restrict the constitutional privilege of manhood suffrage."""

The Democratic leaders concede a Republican majority on the State ticket of 3,000, while the Republican managers estimate it as high as 5,000 and 6,000.

Figures are meeting an astonishing cut at the hands of the Democratic estimate experts. This would appear to be the result of information received to-day from the outposts, and indicates in a measure the position from a Democratic standpoint."

The Republican candidates for Auditor and Treasurer are elected by majorities of from 20,000 to 40,000, which is the normal strength of the party in the State.

Later returns will probably increase this proportion."

1891-11-04T00:00:00Z,"NASHVILLE, Tenn., Nov. 3. -- The release of the convicts at the Coal Creek, Briceville, and Oliver Spring mines continues to be the leading topic throughout the State. The offering of rewards by the Governor and the announcement that the Governor, upon his return to this city from Knoxville, would state what he intended to do, have added much to the interest felt in the situation."

These forty-seven counties are scattered all over the State and represent every political phase."
1891-11-04T00:00:00Z,"Two notable results of the election in this city are the self-destruction of the County Democrats and Mr. RICHARD CROSER'S conversion to the blanket ballot.

1891-11-04T00:00:00Z,The result of yesterday's election in this State is an unmistakable verdict against the Republican Party under the leadership of THOMAS C. PLATT.

1891-11-04T00:00:00Z,"THE TIMES heartily and most sincerely congratulates Harper's Weekly and the Evening Post upon the failure of their efforts to elect Mr. FASSETT. The Evening Post, to be sure, has exercised the Mugwump privilege of ""climbing a tree.""

1891-11-04T00:00:00Z,"RICHMOND, Nov. 3. -- The Democrats have had a walk-over in Virginia at to-day's election. The Independents cut no figure and the Republicans did little better. The Democrats will have 38 members of the Senate, Republicans only 2, and the Independents none. In the House of Delegates the Democrats will have far more than two-thirds and may have seven-eighths of 100 members elected to that body."
1891-11-04T00:00:00Z,"OMAHA, Neb., Nov. 3. -- In spite of the fact that a very light vote has been polled the election to-day has been the most hotly-contested of any struggle ever witnessed in Nebraska. The light vote is due partly to the weather, and partly to the Australian ballot system of voting which has proved cumbersome, especially in Omaha, where there are 119 candidates to be voted for on the State, county, and city ticket."

1891-11-04T00:00:00Z,"The election in all parts of New-Jersey yesterday was an unusually quiet and unexciting one. The Democrats felt so assured that the leaders had fixed things beyond redemption that they deemed hustle and hard work unnecessary. For the same reason the Republicans deemed hustle and hard work profitless, and matters were generally allowed to drift along in foreordained channels."
1891-11-04T00:00:00Z,"Yesterday's election in this city witnessed the casting of 240,234 votes. Of these, 234,134 were divided between the Democratic and Republican candidates for Governor. The number of voters registered was 261,523."

1891-11-04T00:00:00Z,"On a very full vote, Kings County has given the Democratic ticket the very heavy majority of 15,000. This is nearly twice as great as the majority of 1889, and is one-fourth larger than Mr. CLEVELAND'S majority in the county in 1888.

There are 620 convicts at these prisons, and extra guards have been placed on duty at each of them."
1891-11-05T00:00:00Z,"WORCESTER, Mass., Nov. 4. -- Tony Hart died at 2:20 o'clock this morning at the Worcester Lunatic Hospital, where he had been confined for many months.

The Republicans only carried two counties in the State, Alleghany and Garrett. Several counties that have been regarded as Republican strongholds give Democratic majorities."
1891-11-05T00:00:00Z,The results of the elections were widely discussed yesterday and some interesting opinions were expressed. There was surprise and gratification on one side and surprise and chagrin on the other. The peculiar features of the vote in New-York State furnished an abundance of food for thought to the leaders of each political party.
1891-11-05T00:00:00Z,"The plurality by which Roswell P. Flowe has been elected Governor of the State of New-York is increased by later and more complete returns to 45,648. For Lieutenant Governor, Mr. Sheehan is elected by a vote somewhat smaller than that given for the head of the ticket.

1891-11-05T00:00:00Z,"The result of the elections of Tuesday, taken as a whole, is distinctly favorable to the cause of good government in the Nation and, with one marked exception, in the several States. Whatever may be said to the contrary, national issues were necessarily involved. In Massachusetts, as expressly declared by Gov. RUSSELL, and as maintained in the discussions of the canvass, there was little else."
1891-11-05T00:00:00Z,"The revision of the returns of the vote in this State somewhat increases FLOWER'S plurality, but shows no significant variation in the figures for the several counties. Comparison is made with the returns of 1888 for the vote for Governor, when, on account of the Presidential election, the vote was somewhat heavier."
1891-11-05T00:00:00Z,"WASHINGTON, Nov. 4. -- While the Navy Department officials regard the possibility of hostilities with Chile on account of the killing of two American seamen in Valparaiso in a sailors' row as being very remote, they evidently do not propose to be taken at much of a disadvantage if some rash or ill-advised action on one side or the other should bring on trouble."
1891-11-05T00:00:00Z,"WATERTOWN, Nov. 4. -- The people of Watertown did not vote unanimously to make Roswell P.

1891-11-05T00:00:00Z,"PHILADELPHIA, Nov. 4. -- The overwhelming victory of the Republicans in this State yesterday is scarcely more surprising to the Democrats than to the Republicans. Nobody expected it, and both sides seem to be about equally dazed by the result."

Davenport made his attack on Judge McAdam of the Superior Court, declaring that if the Republicans gained control of the State Legislature he should move for Judge McAdam's impeachment for malfeasance in office for the manner in which he had conducted the naturalization business preceding the election, it was rumored that Judge McAdam meant to take some action in the matter."

1891-11-05T00:00:00Z,"ELMIRA, N.Y., Nov. 4. -- Mr. Fassett was busy in his library to-day, poring over telegrams from various parts of the country and answering them.

1891-11-05T00:00:00Z,"It is very seldom, indeed, that an argument has such an effect upon a deliberative body as was made upon the New-York Presbytery by the answer of Dr. BRIGGS to the charges against him. His trial had been ordered, by a small majority, indeed, upon charges upon which the evidence was precisely the same after he had finished his argument yesterday that it was when the charges were formulated."
1891-11-05T00:00:00Z,"ST. LOUIS, Nov. 4. -- The statement made last night that the Messrs.

1891-11-05T00:00:00Z,"CLEVELAND, Ohio, Nov. 4. -- The Republican victory in this State Tuesday is the result of an unusually heavy vote.

1891-11-05T00:00:00Z,"The Philadelphia Press appears to have one set of political morals for Pennsylvania and another for New-York.

1891-11-05T00:00:00Z,"RICHMOND, Va., Nov. 4. -- All of the later returns received fully confirm the dispatches of last night, indicating a perfect Democratic victory in Virginia. The Democrats will have 38, and possibly 39, out of the 40 members of the Senate.

1891-11-05T00:00:00Z,"WASHINGTON, Nov. 4. -- The reported revolutionary movement in Brazil, accompanied by a declaration of martial law and establishment of a dictatorship, is likely to cause another demand upon the already strained resources of the navy, for it is regarded as necessary for the protection of American interests that a United States naval force be at hand there in case of a formidable outbreak."
1891-11-05T00:00:00Z,"Another great throng of women and children, with a man or two sprinkled in here and there, filled the big Madison Square Garden yesterday afternoon and evening, admiring the most successful flower show ever held in this country.

At the Manhattan Athletic Club it was estimated last night that the receipts from all sources would not fall far short of $75,000. These figures were based upon the outcome of the auction sale, which there took place, of boxes, reserved sittings in the grand stand, and of places for carriages and drags and tally-ho coaches."
1891-11-08T00:00:00Z,"SOCIAL LIFE IN LONDON IN ELIZABETH'S TIME. -- The ordering of the household was strict. Servants and prentices were up at 6 in the Summer and at 7 in the Winter. No one on any pretense, except that of illness, was to absent himself from morning and evening prayers; there was to be no striking, no profane language. Sunday was clean-shirt day."
1891-11-08T00:00:00Z,"CAIRO, Sept. 8. -- A fair-minded stranger if at all observant and intelligent, who would make a journey from New-York to San Francisco with adequate stoppages and opportunities of talking with representative men, could gain some accurate notion of American questions and institutions. But in Oriental countries there are no representative men, and there is nothing that corresponds with what in the West is called public opinion."
1891-11-08T00:00:00Z,"This would seem to be a good time for a bargain at auction in real estate. The market has dropped to that point of dullness in which buyers are not at all eager unless they can secure property at prices which owners would have positively refused to accept a few months ago, and with which the majority even at this time refuse to be satisfied."
1891-11-08T00:00:00Z,"CHICAGO, Nov. 7. -- With several new theatrical productions during the week, there has been nothing worthy of high commendation. The novelties were ""Mr. Potter of Texas,"" at the Columbia, and the Royal Midgets in ""Gulliver among the Liliputians,"" at the Chicago Opera House. ""Mr. Potter of Texas"" drew good houses, and the Royal Midgets drew poor houses, which they certainly deserved."
1891-11-08T00:00:00Z,The Rev. H. Pereira Mendes devoted himself at yesterday's services in the Synagogue Shearith Israel to a discussion of the proposed Jewish exhibit at the World's Fair Exposition at Chicago next year. He approves the suggestion of a monument.

LOUIS, Nov. 7. -- There is serious trouble among the members of the Pastimes Club, the aristocratic athletic association of the city, which has just completed a magnificent new clubhouse on Vandeventer Avenue.

1891-11-08T00:00:00Z,"KINGSTON, N.Y., Nov. 7. -- The coldest night of the season is reported by Delaware County people to-day. The thermometer this morning at Stamford and Hobart, they say, was about zero, and the ponds and small streams were covered with ice. There was excellent skating at Hobart."
1891-11-08T00:00:00Z,"CINCINNATI, Nov. 7. -- A special from Akron, Ohio, says: Two Howard Street business blocks collapsed at 1:10 o'clock this afternoon. Fortunately nobody was killed. One of the blocks was a stone-front, four stories high, occupied by Herrick Son, crockery jobbers and retailers. The other was of brick, three stories high, occupied by the bakery and confectionery establishment of S.B. Lafferty."
1891-11-08T00:00:00Z,"ST. LOUIS, Nov. 7. -- Mr. Alphonso de Figueredo, Brazilian Consul at St. Louis, said this evening, concerning recent events in Brazil:"
1891-11-08T00:00:00Z,A photographer visited Broad Street last week for the purpose of obtaining some views of that kaleidoscopic block between Wall Street and Exchange Place. Had he been a free dispenser of grit-edged securities he could not have attracted a crowd about him in any less time than he actually did. The substrata of Wall Street humanity ranged up before the camera in full force.
1891-11-08T00:00:00Z,"A rumor was current last night that the United States man-of-war Baltimore had been sunk off the coast of Chile. Few particulars went with the rumor, and statements varied as to the cause. One version of the affair was to the effect that a torpedo had been exploded under the man-of-war."
1891-11-08T00:00:00Z,"PROVERBS. -- The Turks have proverbs without number; and very polished and cynical Turkish proverbs are. The taciturn Arabs prefer proverbs to every other form of speech, and use them with singular dignity and aptness. The Koran seems to have been enriched with them for the express purpose of quotation."
1891-11-08T00:00:00Z,""" Let me tell you, they use the black bottle at Old Bellevue more than you have any idea of. When they think you give them too much trouble or believe you are not worth saving, they give you a drink, and that's the end of you."""
1891-11-08T00:00:00Z,"The appearance of strength which the market took on in the face of the Boston bank troubles, proved to be deceptive. Such an event as the failure of a bank having $10,000,000 of deposits might well have been expected to cause a serious decline in prices, but the measure of its depressing influence seemed to be about one per cent. only. But it was seeming only."
1891-11-08T00:00:00Z,"SOUTH BETHLEHEM, Penn., Nov. 7. -- At a meeting of the undergraduates held last week, an Advisory Committee on Athletics was decided upon, to act as a board for the selection of members of the various athletic teams and to aid the several Captains.

1891-11-08T00:00:00Z,"NORTH ADAMS, Mass., Nov. 7. -- It has long been a recognized custom at Williams College to have a yearly rush on the soldiers' monument between freshmen and sophomores. This year a Trustee of the College requested that the rush be discontinued, and the sophomores accordingly voted to abolish it. Many made bold to say at the time, however, that the rush would come off anyhow."
1891-11-08T00:00:00Z,"Great is the princess among gowns! In this season of rich gowning, the princess is to be princess indeed. Its reign is to be undisputed. Other gowns there are, but none as yet to equal it in rank. Women who are cast in classic mold will affect the princess in its severest outlines and give thanks for a gown so simple and so charming."

1891-11-08T00:00:00Z,"WASHINGTON, Nov. 7. -- Good weather and the best card of the week resulted in drawing a good crowd to the track at Bennings this afternoon. The sport was excellent, the finishes being sharp and exciting as a rule. Betting was brisk throughout the afternoon, but the plungers fared badly, for Dr. Hasbrouck was the only favorite that succeeded in first catching the judges' eye during the afternoon."
1891-11-08T00:00:00Z,"PHILADELPHIA, Nov. 7. -- The greatest football game that Philadelphia has ever seen was fought to a finish to-day at the Germantown Cricket Grounds, Manheim, when the University of Pennsylvania was defeated at the hands of Princeton by a score of 24 to 0. At least fifteen thousand people witnessed the game. Never before has there been such a representative social gathering on the ball field."
1891-11-08T00:00:00Z,"RUSSIA THE AGGRESSIVE POWER. -- Many things have combined to make Russia essentially an aggressive power. The geographical position of the country, cooped in between two inland seas, and buried for more than half the year under the snows of an arctic Winter, makes expansion a necessity of her existence; and it scarcely needs the testament of Peter the Great to remind us of the direction which that expansion is likely to take."
1891-11-08T00:00:00Z,"This reprint, in book form, of articles contributed by Mr. Dobson to the periodical press carries out the author's original intention, he says, and is made after revision, but the contents of the book, especially the first three of the sketches, bear strong marks of the form of publication which they first received."
1891-11-08T00:00:00Z,"BOSTON, Nov. 7. -- Boston has been shaken from centre to circumference this week -- that is, from Hub to tire -- and in the romance of the six days past there has been literally not a dull page."
1891-11-08T00:00:00Z,"LONDON, Nov. 7. -- There is a touch of pathos in the fact that the correspondence now proceeding between Jules Claretie and Mme. Bernhardt, relative to the latter's return to the Comedie Francaise, contemplates her coming back to play motherly parts. She has arrived at a point where she is willing to settle down to assume roles like Andromaque, Athalie, and Agrappine, which, if not precisely venerable, mark a definite breaking with youth."

1891-11-08T00:00:00Z,One of the worst effects of extreme party spirit in our politics is the development of a disposition to cheat and to seize an unfair advantage even on the part of men who would scorn such practices in private relations. Party zeal may be excused when it is confined to efforts to induce men by legitimate means to vote and to vote for particular candidates.
1891-11-08T00:00:00Z,"AMERICAN WILD FLOWERS. -- What most impresses the nature-loving Englishman while traveling in America is the newness and rawness of the country, and the almost universal absence of that harmonious interblending of wild nature with human cultivation which is so charming over a large part of England."

The nearest town to the pond is Eustis, which is itself twenty-eight miles from the railroad. Then it is twelve miles further by buckboard from Eustis to Tim Pond, which is named for a former guide once famous in that locality."
1891-11-08T00:00:00Z,"ITHACA, N.Y., Nov. 7. -- The best game of football ever seen in Ithaca was played to-day between Cornell and Lehigh, who have been bitter rivals for several years.

1891-11-08T00:00:00Z,"TOPEKA, Kan., Nov. 7. -- The campaign just closed has been the cause of righting a wrong committed four years ago, that was, to some extent, the cause of the overwhelming defeat of Judge Nicholson, an Alliance candidate for District Judge."
1891-11-08T00:00:00Z,"A woman, driven by the vicissitudes of life to throw her home open to boarders, finds the experience, as most other women who try it do, difficult, to say the least. But she says, philosophically: ""I am learning human nature.

1891-11-08T00:00:00Z,"THE MODERN CHILEAN POLITICIAN. -- The modern politician is the outcome of the higher education and the war with Peru. The first has endowed a number of young men with an acquaintance, more or less superficial, with sundry things unknown to the bulk of their fellows. They can read French novels in the original, and recognize a right-angled triangle when they see one."
1891-11-08T00:00:00Z,""" When I read in THE TIMES this morning,"" said a well-known resident of this city yesterday -- a gentleman who for a number of years has been spending the Winters in St. Augustine, ""of the arrest of T.

1891-11-08T00:00:00Z,"PARIS, Oct. 22. -- No one outside of France can form any idea of the value of the patriotic protestation of kindly friendship shown in the subscription to the Russian loan. Seven times! That does not mean much in itself, for even the peasants know that only one-quarter of the subscription is really legitimate; but what is true and real and sincere is that everybody brought their mite."
1891-11-08T00:00:00Z,"CAMBRIDGE, Mass., Nov. 7. -- Stagg's plucky football eleven scored a touch-down against Harvard on Jarvis Field this afternoon, and although Harvard ran up 44 points in the two halves, the game was by all odds the most disappointing of the season to Harvard supporters."
1891-11-08T00:00:00Z,"It would seem that the amateur photographers would never tire of hunting with their cameras for street scenes in the city. Every object of any interest in New-York has been taken a hundred times, yet the picture takers any pleasant day may be seen on the streets, taking snap shots, or in the Park, reproducing the old scenes again. Election day was utilized by many for suburban trips."
1891-11-08T00:00:00Z,"If the claims made by Queens County Democrats last night turn out to be well founded, the next Assembly will be more strongly Democratic than was supposed on Friday. Tuesday night it was believed that James A. McKenna, Democrat, had been re-elected in the Second District of Queens County. Wednesday the election of George L. Weeks, his Republican opponent, seemed to be so sure that the Democrats conceded their defeat."
1891-11-08T00:00:00Z,"WEALTH AND FREEDOM. -- Given wider and wider freedom, the opportunities of growing rich will broaden and develop until they reach the whole people. Wealth, unless artificially arrested, has the true democratic tendency. In a free industrial state of society, by a law that seems almost universal, those things that are acquired by the small section of the rich tend to pass to the large section of the not rich."
1891-11-08T00:00:00Z,"There were reported in the week ending at noon yesterday 733 deaths, 1,009 births, and 320 marriages.

1891-11-08T00:00:00Z,"ST. LOUIS, Mo., Nov. 7. -- Gov. David R. Francis was interviewed to-night on Tuesday's elections. He unhesitatingly said he was convinced the result meant that Cleveland would be nominated and elected President."
1891-11-08T00:00:00Z,"OTTAWA, Nov. 7. -- There is trouble between the copyright branch of the Department of Agriculture and the authorities at Washington over the registration by American citizens of copyrights in Canada. United States authors and publishers are very dissatisfied, in fact, indignant over the fact that they are refused the privilege of copyrighting in Canada, notwithstanding the treaty between England and the United States, which sanctions such registration in all the British possessions."
1891-11-08T00:00:00Z,"Congressman Benton McMillin of Tennessee said yesterday, at the Hoffman House, that his observations of the campaign in New-York and its results had led him to think that national issues had played a considerable part in the fight."

Of course, there are points of difference between the two cases."
1891-11-08T00:00:00Z,"In his introductiory chapter the author brings out clearly the paradoxes of the Spaniard, and how for well-understood reasons, with all the prestige and power of old Spain, that country has been forced to yield her territory in the New World, foot by foot; how she lost ""her proud position in the front rank of nations,"" until to-day, of the continent Columbus discovered, Cuba alone is hers."
1891-11-08T00:00:00Z,"HARRISBURG, Penn., Nov. 7. -- A good deal of noise has been made by the Republican organs over the cost of the extra session of the Senate.

1891-11-08T00:00:00Z,"SAN FRANCISCO, Nov. 7. -- Special Police Officer John Gillen was shot and killed this afternoon by a Chinaman named Chew Su Chan, who also shot and probably fatally wounded Joseph Cowell, a milkman, besides wounding G. Barbaris, a restaurant keeper."

1891-11-08T00:00:00Z,"BENNINGTON, Vt., Nov. 7. -- Genuine spruce gum has almost disappeared, as a regular article of merchandise, from the Bennington market.

1891-11-09T00:00:00Z,"WASHINGTON, Nov. 8. -- The Secretary of Agriculture's report for the year bears date Oct. 27. If the elections had turned out better it is probable that it would have had a later date, and that it would have made much more of the returns to point the significance of tariff sentiment in Massachusetts and Iowa. But it is boastful enough, and it is not uninteresting."

His integrity was unquestioned until three days ago."

1891-11-14T00:00:00Z,"A good deal of party infatuation has been exhibited in the Republican interpretation of the significance of the recent elections.

1891-11-15T00:00:00Z,"WASHINGTON, Nov. 14. -- The second trial of armor plates manufactured by American establishments took place to-day at the grounds at Indian Head. That the test was interesting was evident from the large attendance of critical observers, more than 200 of whom were at Indian Head at the cost of some personal discomfort at 9 o'clock this morning, when the firing began."
1891-11-15T00:00:00Z,"THE GRINGO. -- There is a popular delusion to the effect that the Chileans call themselves ""the English of South America."" No one within the memory of man ever heard them do so, and the statement seems to have had its birth in the self-flattering imagination of some Anglo-Saxon writer."
1891-11-15T00:00:00Z,"THE PARISIAN HOUSE OWNER. -- The owner some dozen years ago of a rather dilapidated dwelling in the Rue Neuve des Mathurins -- a fussy little man -- being informed that an applicant for his vacant third floor had presented himself, desired him to be shown up, in order that he might treat with him in person."
1891-11-15T00:00:00Z,"The Professor of Mathematics at Columbia College, in the volume under notice, presents a fairly ample sketch of geodesy, and promises at some future time to give a critical history of this most interesting study. There must have been implanted in early man at least that curiosity which prompted him to find out where he was, or the relationship between his own field or range of mountains or country with other sections of the land."
1891-11-15T00:00:00Z,"The Crescent football team of Brooklyn defeated the New-York Athletic Club's team yesterday on the Polo Grounds and thereby won the championship of the Amateur Football Union. The playing of the Crescents was not marked with that amount of brutal slugging which characterized their work when they met the Manhattan Athletic Club team at Eastern Park two weeks ago; still, the disgrace of marring of a fair game fell against the Brooklyn team."
1891-11-15T00:00:00Z,"PHILADELPHIA, Nov. 14. -- The receipts from the big University-Princeton football game at Manheim on Saturday last amounted to $8,800. Of this 10 per cent. went to the proprietors of the ground, and the remainder was divided equally between the two contesting teams."

Russell's suit against James A. Bradley, the founder of Asbury Park, N.J., to recover $16,000 for malicious prosecution. The first thing for the jury to consider, Judge Shipman said, was whether Bradley caused the action against Mrs. Russell to be begun."

By a republication in an extended form, under the title ""Illustrations of Tennyson,"" Mr. Collins does not profess to accuse the poet of plagiarism, but he brings up parallel passages showing that Tennyson borrowed ideas and phrases by the wholesale from previous authors, always, however, improving them."
1891-11-15T00:00:00Z,"The first Winter entertainment of the Young Men's Hebrew Association took place last night at the Hebrew Institute at East Broadway and Jefferson Street. The large auditorium was filled, and many who came to attend the entertainment were unable to get in. There was some delay in opening the doors caused by the temporary disability of a dynamo which furnishes light to the establishment, but, once started, the affair was an entire success."
1891-11-15T00:00:00Z,"It would seem that the Barthman ""pull"" in Brooklyn is at once potent, extensive, and complex. Having been used to induce Mayor CHAPIN to reappoint to the Board of Education a member who, he declared, ought to resign as unfit to associate with honest men, it has now proved equal to inducing at least one member to withdraw his protest against the reappointment."
1891-11-15T00:00:00Z,"BOSTON, Nov. 14. -- S.C. De Soissons passed last night in a cell of Police Station No. 4, on Lagrange Street. This man is well known about town, and there is probably not an artist about Boston whose acquaintance he has not tried to cultivate."

The experiment which establishes this fact is due to the late Sir Charles Wheatstone. A disk, divided into alternate sectors of black and white, is caused to rotate very rapidly on its axis, and by daylight it appears of a uniform gray."
1891-11-15T00:00:00Z,"The National Convention, is six months or more off, and there is ample time for new circumstances to occur and new problems to develop. At present, however, everything points to Grover Cleveland as the Democratic candidate for President. In such States as the party succeeded in at the late elections the platforms conformed to his principles."

1891-11-15T00:00:00Z,""" Fuss and feathers"" seems a peculiarly appropriate characterisation of the work of the artist in millinery materials this Fall. Certainly there never were quite so many feathers, and of fuss the like never has been seen. Gowns maintain an appearance of simplicity, though it is an appearance merely, but bonnets and hats make no such pretense."
1891-11-15T00:00:00Z,"QUEBEC, Nov. 14. -- The country was startled the other day by the publication in a Toronto paper of a charge made against the Provincial Government to the effect that they had blackmailed John P. Whelan, contractor, to the extent of $115,000. Phelan was contractor for the construction of the Quebec Court House.

Foraker's Senatorial campaign gave out last night some information calculated to produce a sensation and put the friends of Senator Sherman in a new, if not pleasant, position. It is charged that for some time past it has been known that influences have been brought into the contest suggestive of boodle, but that heretofore nothing could be learned calculated to justify the making of the charge."

It was a game too one-sided to be particularly interesting, and the only features were that no one was hurt and that the referee, Aldrich, gave perfect satisfaction to both sides."
1891-11-15T00:00:00Z,"BOSTON, Nov. 14. -- An event of no little international interest will occur next Tuesday, in the reception to be given by the leading French Canadian Societies of this city to the Hon.

That train might have carried me to Buffalo in eight hours and forty minutes, but the train I went in took eight hours and forty-four minutes, and every New-Yorker knows what, in these hustling times of haste, four minutes may possibly be worth."

He begins from small things. He progresses from small to large, and at last attains perfection.

1891-11-15T00:00:00Z,"A curious case of plagiarism, which in all likelihood was unconscious, has happened to a sculptor, Mr. H.H. Kitson of Boston. His design for a fountain at Providence, R.I., in honor of Elisha Dyer had already been accepted, with one slight modification, when it was stated that a nearly identical fountain had been designed by Herbert Adams in Paris, and placed in the year 1889 on a public square of Fitchburg, Mass."

LOUIS, Nov. 19. -- In a fit of murderous insanity Charles Durgin this morning attacked his two sisters, Gertrude and Adelaide, with a poker and then rushed to a police station and gave himself up.

1891-11-21T00:00:00Z,"The criticism that has been bestowed so lavishly on the Director of the Mint for the designs for the new coins has been based, so far as we have seen, on photographs of the coins. The actual coin is not good, but it is by no means bad relatively to the coins of other nations, and its real badness is not, as has been too generally assumed, the fault of the Director of the Mint."

1891-11-22T00:00:00Z,The show which has prevailed among us during the past week seems to have been about equally one of feminine as of equine beauties.

There was not much doing the early part of the week, and a further dip in Delaware and Hudson with a drop in the Richmond Terminal securities contributed to make the general list flat.

1891-11-22T00:00:00Z,"It seems pretty severe to charge our fathers and mothers, the latter in particular, with having looked like guys only as long ago as the war of the rebellion. To see them now, dressed becomingly and fully conversant with the canons of good taste, it does not seem possible that they once went about arrayed in garments the style of which would subject the wearer to ridicule nowadays."

There is no doubt that the attractiveness of the opera has been enhanced by the excellent rendering of Mascagni's music by the Shaftesbury orchestra, which is under the direction of Signor Arditi."

1891-11-22T00:00:00Z,"WATERTOWN, N.Y., Nov. 21. -- Following close on the annual round-up of voters in this part of the State comes the annual round-up of the turkeys, geese, and ducks that the farmers' wives and daughters were busy fattening while their husbands and fathers talked politics."

1891-11-22T00:00:00Z,"The last election, so far as this city is concerned, showed two things that will occupy the attention of the politicians for some time. The first is that the Republican machine in this city is badly in need of an overhauling, and the second is that there are more weak spots in Tammany Hall than any one who does not follow politics closely had supposed."
1891-11-22T00:00:00Z,"PHILADELPHIA, Nov. 21. -- Philadelphia has been well represented among the prize winners at the New-York Horse Show the past week. A.J. Cassatt of the Pennsylvania Railroad sent superb stock to the metropolis, and the Wideners of the Traction Company were well represented. Mr. P.A.B. Widener, by the bye, has a stable at Ogontz, near the city, that in fittings and furnishings is said to outrank anything of the kind in the country."
1891-11-22T00:00:00Z,"SYRACUSE, N.Y., Nov. 21. -- The big and historic Bastable Block, one of the oldest in Syracuse, was burned early this morning, together with the Dime Museum and the Standard Theatre, at which the Fay-Foster Burlesque Company were filling an engagement."
1891-11-22T00:00:00Z,"TOPEKA, Kan., Nov. 21. -- Grouse Creek Road, in Cowley County, has attained a somewhat unenviable reputation in the last few years. To the ghost hunter it should form a rich field."
1891-11-22T00:00:00Z,"Three thousand gallons of water were wasted and nearly $6,000 damage was done yesterday by the blowing out of a plug in the automatic sprinkler system on the sixth floor of the building facing Harry Howard Square, and fronting on both Walker and Canal Streets.

1891-11-22T00:00:00Z,"Amateur photographers of this country are fast approaching a high standard in picture taking and picture making. Every Winter better work is turned out than in the previous season. The road for improvement seems broad and extensive, and suggestions of improvement in little things are constantly presenting themselves to the picture men."
1891-11-22T00:00:00Z,"The society record of the past week may be best summed up by saying that it comprised the horse show and nothing besides. Not alone did the gay world of the metropolis pour itself into the Madison Square Garden every day and evening of the week, but its ranks were augmented by detachments from the society worlds of Boston, Philadelphia, Baltimore, and Chicago, and by equally large contingents from the suburbs."
1891-11-22T00:00:00Z,"In New-York's shopping quarter there is nothing quite so characteristic of the city as the jewelry windows. Their glitter and show, the money represented, and perhaps also the hard, cold, unsympathetic nature of the gems which orm so conspicuous a part of their contents, are fit exponents of the city's life."
1891-11-22T00:00:00Z,"The final boxing and wrestling contests in the tournament of the Long Island Amateur Athletic League were held last evening in the Clermont Avenue Rink, Brooklyn. As on the first occasion, the attendance was large and the sport good."

1891-11-22T00:00:00Z,"PATERSON, N.J., Nov. 21. -- This city was stirred last week as it never has been before in the same way by an extraordinary entertainment given at the new Hospital Building, at Market Street and Madison Avenue. The building is not quite completed, and to take advantage of the opportunity it presented for giving an entertainment, and at the same time get the public to become better acquainted with the building, this project was planned."
1891-11-22T00:00:00Z,"LAKEWOOD, N.J. Nov. 21. -- Great preparations have been made by Mr. Fred Sterry, manager of the Lakewood Hotel, for the first grand hop, which will be given there on the evening of the 28th inst. More than one thousand in vitations have been sent out, and the affair promises to equal, if not excel, the magnificent entertainments of that kind given by Lakewood Hotel Company last season."
1891-11-22T00:00:00Z,"LENOX, Mass., Nov. 21. -- A great many cottages may be opened here within a few weeks if the water famine in New-York should assume alarming proportions.

1891-11-22T00:00:00Z,"-- Any carefulstudy of the way in which Von Moltke, during a long and anxious period, maintained a firm grip upon the French capital and manoeuvred subordinate armies over a great part of France, serves to reveal his sterling qualities as a director of war. Throughout this period he retained a complete hold of the entire situation."
1891-11-22T00:00:00Z,"WILLIAMSTOWN, Mass., Nov. 21. -- The Lyceum of Natural History held its first regular meeting Thursday evening in the biological laboratory. Papers were read by McKean, '92, and Redfield, '93."

Marble, Superintendent of the public schools of Worcester, Mass., and during the last year President of the National Education Association of the United States. Dr. Marble has made a study of the problems of ventilation, heating, lighting, draining, and schoolhouse construction."
1891-11-22T00:00:00Z,"The horse show that closed last night has undoubtedly been the most successful popular amusement that has ever been offered in this city. The attendance has been at least 80,000, which is probably a considerable understatement. Even so, it is quite unprecedented. When the baseball craze was at its height, there was never anything approaching an average attendance at the games of 13,000 people every day for a week."
1891-11-23T00:00:00Z,"LONDON, Nov. 11. -- To comprehend Russia one must have seen Moscow. Viewed solely as a spectacle, I should think there is nothing else in the world more remarkable. Considered as the key to the strange, baffling enigma of the retrogressive Tartar Empire in Europe, it furnishes the most fascinating and enthralling of studies. Frankly, Moscow ought to have a book by itself."
1891-11-23T00:00:00Z,"There is no name, except Washington's, that is more familiar to Americans in connection with the Revolution than Patrick Henry's. He is known to us all as the orator of that great struggle -- great in its consequences, if not in its actual proportions -and no other has given to the memory of his countrymen phrases so intimately associated with independence."
1891-11-23T00:00:00Z,"In a communication from the administration of the New-York Life Insurance Company in this place to the Sonn- und Montags-Zeitung it is claimed that the alleged uneasiness among the insured of the New-York has not found the least expression, although the opponents of the company are sparing no efforts to engender this uneasiness."
1891-11-23T00:00:00Z,"CLEVELAND, Ohio, Nov. 22. -- The administration of the Northern Ohio Asylum for the Insane, under Superintendent Eyeman, promises to be noteworthy for the valuable reforms begun. The civil service system adopted is already showing good results."
1891-11-23T00:00:00Z,"NEW-ORLEANS, La., Nov. 22. -- Since the publication in THE TIMES of Nov. 16 of the NewYork Life Insurance Company's transactions in this city under President Beers and the Dinkelspiels, almost every policy holder in town has evidenced an extreme desire to have his contract examined by an expert in order to ascertain the extent to which he has been swindled."

1891-11-23T00:00:00Z,"BOSTON, Nov. 22. -- There has been more commotion in the Republican Party of this State since the election of Gov. Russell in 1890 than in the twenty years of its history previous to that time. Having failed so disastrously at the last election with a new and young candidate, the party is rather inclined to turn its attention again to the veterans of official and party service than to undertake any experiments, however promising."
1891-11-23T00:00:00Z,"DUBUQUE, Iowa, Nov. 22. -- One of Dubuque's fairest young women is missing. She is Mrs. Cora Duncan, wife of Melvin G.

Bush, the wealthy son of Dubuque's dead millionaire Mayor, are also missing."
1891-11-23T00:00:00Z,"PHILADELPHIA, Nov. 22. -- Last Wednesday morning Cheney Kilburn, President of the Hale Kilburn Manufacturing Company, the largest makers of fine furniture in this city, sitting in his office in consultation with a business man, was startled by a resounding thump on his desk, and turned to see reposing there a fist in which was an enormous card."
1891-11-23T00:00:00Z,"LONDON, Nov. 22. -- Discount was in fair demand during the past week at 3 for three months and 2 1/2 for short. The gold movements during the week were unimportant. The rate of American exchange remains rather above a point warranting gold remittances from here. The prospect of a demand for the Continent also lessens as the depression on the foreign Bourses abates."
1891-11-23T00:00:00Z,"We see no good reason why New-York should join in the competition of the cities that seek the glory of having the Republican National Convention of 1892 held within their gates. It is difficult to see what would be gained by the city, the party, or any aspirant for the Presidential nomination from having that assembly here."
1891-11-23T00:00:00Z,"Mr. TRACY, the Secretary of the Navy, is doing a great deal for the cause of honest and decent politics and for the firm establishment of republican institutions in the United States. His steady and practical application of business principles to public business in the navy yards accords with his quiet obstinacy in disregarding the spoilsmen of his party."
1891-11-23T00:00:00Z,"Although the Shanghai correspondent of a London newspaper recently made the startling discovery that the ordering of the Charleston from China to Honolulu was only a preliminary to the seizure of the Sandwich Islands by the United States, it is doubtful whether that vessel will do much more than make the customary pause there for coaling and a general observation of affairs."
1891-11-23T00:00:00Z,"At 2:40 yesterday afternoon, when the Brooklyn Bridge was crowded with its usual throng of Sunday pedestrians, a man climbed to the top of the rail skirting the very highest point of the south roadway and stood there in a dramatic attitude, as though to command attention."

1891-11-23T00:00:00Z,"The Church congress held last week at Washington was the most successful that has been held in several years. The great distances which separate men of the same faith from one another prevent the massing of great numbers at places where the congress is held, and this makes an American quite different from an English congress."
1891-11-23T00:00:00Z,"Yesterday, from early morning till late at night, there were many visitors to the bier of the actor, William J. Florence, in Parlor 15, at the Fifth Avenue Hotel.

Prof. Briggs was listened to with the closest attention throughout the discourse."
1891-11-23T00:00:00Z,"Since the disaster Saturday at the trench dug by the Brooklyn Water Works Company for its new main, at Liberty Avenue and Hill Street, Brooklyn, the scene has been one of the busiest. Not for an hour has the work of digging been suspended. That four lives have been sacrificed is beyond doubt; that there have not been more than four lost is still a matter of uncertainty."
1891-11-23T00:00:00Z,"Our Washington dispatches this morning give an account of one of the devices resorted to by Mr. GORMAN to bring about the defeat of Mr. MILLS as a candidate for the Speakership nomination. It amounts to a mere ""deal"" in the patronage of the House of a kind for which Mr. MILLS has expressed his practical and determined aversion."
1891-11-23T00:00:00Z,"SAN FRANCISCO, Nov. 22. -- The now famous San Francisco Grand Jury which has driven Boss Buckley and other boodlers to Canada, and which has already indicted three State legislators, will meet again Tuesday."

The report of the bureau, in order to be useful, should be a clear and concise statement of facts and a dispassionate elucidation of their significance."
1891-11-23T00:00:00Z,"WASHINGTON, Nov. 22. -- Happily for the Democratic Party, and unfortunately for Mr. Crisp as the candidate for Speaker of a faction of that party, the ulterior purpose of the advocacy of Mr. Crisp's election has been made known early enough to make it impossible for any Democrat to plead ignorance if he should ever be taxed with having made a serious blunder in voting for him."

Herman celebrated the fiftieth anniversary of their marriage last evening at their residence, 246 East Sixty-eighth Street, with a dinner to their nine children, thirteen grandchildren, and two representatives of the fourth generation.

1891-11-24T00:00:00Z,"Comments on Mr. FOSTER'S Chamber of Commerce speech continue to come from all parts of the country. It probably surprises Mr. FOSTER himself to find that the least favorable are still from the West. Apart from the journals of his own loyal State, where nothing that an Ohio man in office can say will excite criticism, the Western papers are almost uniformly very hard on the Secretary."
1891-11-24T00:00:00Z,"The failure of the Mayor to reappoint Mr. W.N. WILMER, as an Inspector of Schools in the Fifth District is likely to direct more attention to the crusade which that gentleman had been making against saloons and houses of ill repute in close proximity to schoolhouses than it would have received if he had been continued in office."
1891-11-24T00:00:00Z,"CLEVELAND, Nov. 23. -- The State of Ohio has been foremost in many reforms in the management of State charities and benevolences and in the care of dependent and depraved classes, but the founding of a State asylum for epileptics and the epileptic insane, the cornerstone of which was laid at Gallipolis a week ago, is doubtless the most notable departure from precedents Ohio has ever made."

1891-11-24T00:00:00Z,"It seems that Signor CRISPI'S declaration in favor of the neutralization of Alsace and Lorraine is esteemed in Europe to have brought that suggestion within the sphere of practical politics. It will be remembered that in adopting it, he coupled it with a condition that, upon the neutralization of those provinces, France should join the Triple Alliance."

1891-11-24T00:00:00Z,"That the Democratic members of the House of Representatives from New-England should be strongly attracted by the great services of Mr. MILLS in the cause of tariff reform is natural, and it is natural that this confidence in and admiration for him on that account should make him their choice as Speaker of the House, where he could do so much for the cause that is so dear to them."
1891-11-24T00:00:00Z,"Henry Cranston, the popular landlord of the New-York Hotel, is apparently in a financial condition not the most pleasing to him and his numerous friends.

1891-11-30T00:00:00Z,"The conception we have of the French Revolution is accurate, for no social cataclysm has been more thoroughly discussed, and yet there are always novel incidents of the movement, perhaps more personal than general, that help to precise the outlines. M. Imbert de Saint-Amand does not enter into the lists with Taine or Thiers, Quinet or Lamartine, but, taking special men or women, he particularizes certain lines and brings out personal details."
1891-11-30T00:00:00Z,"It is a significant evidence of the change that has taken place in the temper and purpose of the Democratic Party that the leaders who are to-day insisting with most force and reasonableness that the tariff shall be the one objective of the party policy are from the South, where, beyond doubt, the silver question has attracted more attention than in any other part of the country."

1891-11-30T00:00:00Z,"If long and conspicuous party service counts for anything, Mr. Mills should certainly wield the gavel. As Chairman of the Ways and Means Committee he has been the leader of the House, and, next to Mr. Cleveland, he is the leading exponent of tariff reform. As the recent elections have made that the question for 1892, the country will naturally expect the election of Mr. Mills."

You are conscious that the author wanted you to feel blue and chilly, and you are aware that he has succeeded."
1891-11-30T00:00:00Z,One thing made clear by the last series of trials at Indian Head is that the resources of this country for turning out ship armor are equal to all demands likely to be made upon them.

1891-11-30T00:00:00Z,"A prominent feature of the current reports of the military establishment, from that of Secretary PROCTOR down, is their testimony to the improvement in the condition of the enlisted men.
