Dr. Wargo graduated from M.I.T., with an SB degree in Earth and Planetary Science and received a Doctorate in Materials Science in 1982. At MIT, he was recognized with the John Wulff Award for Excellence in Teaching and the Hugh Hampton Young Memorial Fund Prize for exhibiting leadership and creativity while maintaining exceptionally broad and interdisciplinary interests. He began his career at NASA by turning a fledgling microgravity research division into a worldclass program. NASA drew on Dr. Wargo's ability to explain complex scientific findings in straightforward terms as a spokesman at agency press conferences. NASA is asking the International Astronomical Union to name a crater on the moon in his honor ""so his name will be forever enshrined in the heavens."" His colleagues and his friends remember him as inspirational, full of passion and energy, with a booming voice and a great heart.

2013-08-10T00:00:00Z,"WARGO--Michael J.,Chief Exploration Scientist for NASA's Human Exploration and Operations Mission, died unexpectedly on August 4 at his home in Alexandria, VA. He was 61 years old. Dr. Wargo was the son of Margaret and John J. Wargo of Clairton, PA, both deceased, who themselves were the children of Slovak immigrants. Michael was a leading contributor to NASA's human lunar and planetary exploration program. As a scientific member of many lunar missions, including the Lunar Reconnaissance Orbiter and the LCROSS satellite, Dr. Wargo helped map resources for human missions to the moon and participated in the discovery of ice in the shadows of lunar craters. In a nearly two-decade career at NASA, he received numerous awards including NASA's Exceptional Service Medal and seven group achievement awards. He was a member of the team planning the next robotic mission to Mars in 2020 and worked gathering crucial scientific information needed to allow humans to be sent safely to the moon, Mars and near-Earth asteroids. Much of his work has helped develop a ""roadmap"" for human and robotic space exploration for the next two decades. Dr. Wargo graduated from M.I.T., with an SB degree in Earth and Planetary Science and received a Doctorate in Materials Science in 1982. At MIT, he was recognized with the John Wulff Award for Excellence in Teaching and the Hugh Hampton Young Memorial Fund Prize for exhibiting leadership and creativity while maintaining exceptionally broad and interdisciplinary interests. He began his career at NASA by turning a fledgling microgravity research division into a worldclass program. NASA drew on Dr. Wargo's ability to explain complex scientific findings in straightforward terms as a spokesman at agency press conferences. NASA is asking the International Astronomical Union to name a crater on the moon in his honor ""so his name will be forever enshrined in the heavens."" His colleagues and his friends remember him as inspirational, full of passion and energy, with a booming voice and a great heart. He is survived by his wife, Adele Morrissette of New York, NY, and brothers John, David and Robert, all of whom graduated from M.I.T. Visitation will be held on Sunday afternoon August 11, at Everly-Wheatley Funeral Home and funeral services will be held on Monday August 12 at 12:30pm at Blessed Sacrament Catholic Church, both in Alexandria VA.

He was 61 years old. Dr. Wargo was the son of Margaret and John J. Wargo of Clairton, PA, both deceased, who themselves were the children of Slovak immigrants. Michael was a leading contributor to NASA's human lunar and planetary exploration program. As a scientific member of many lunar missions, including the Lunar Reconnaissance Orbiter and the LCROSS satellite, Dr. Wargo helped map resources for human missions to the moon and participated in the discovery of ice in the shadows of lunar craters. In a nearly two-decade career at NASA, he received numerous awards including NASA's Exceptional Service Medal and seven group achievement awards. He was a member of the team planning the next robotic mission to Mars in 2020 and worked gathering crucial scientific information needed to allow humans to be sent safely to the moon, Mars and near-Earth asteroids. Much of his work has helped develop a ""roadmap"" for human and robotic space exploration for the next two decades. Dr. Wargo graduated from M.I.T., with an SB degree in Earth and Planetary Science and received a Doctorate in Materials Science in 1982. At MIT, he was recognized with the John Wulff Award for Excellence in Teaching and the Hugh Hampton Young Memorial Fund Prize for exhibiting leadership and creativity while maintaining exceptionally broad and interdisciplinary interests. He began his career at NASA by turning a fledgling microgravity research division into a worldclass program. NASA drew on Dr. Wargo's ability to explain complex scientific findings in straightforward terms as a spokesman at agency press conferences. NASA is asking the International Astronomical Union to name a crater on the moon in his honor ""so his name will be forever enshrined in the heavens."" His colleagues and his friends remember him as inspirational, full of passion and energy, with a booming voice and a great heart. He is survived by his wife, Adele Morrissette of New York, NY, and brothers John, David and Robert, all of whom graduated from M.I.T. Visitation will be held on Sunday afternoon August 11, at Everly-Wheatley Funeral Home and funeral services will be held on Monday August 12 at 12:30pm at Blessed Sacrament Catholic Church, both in Alexandria VA. Gifts may be made to MIT in memory of Michael Wargo for the Department of Materials Science Endowed Fellowship Fund by contacting Bonny Kellerman, bonnyk@mit.edu or at 617-253-9722."
2013-08-11T00:00:00Z,"TRENTHAM--Barbara. August 27, 1944 August 2, 2013. Artist, Barbara Trentham, 68, died August 2, 2013, at Northwestern Memorial Hospital in Chicago. The cause was complications of leukemia. Barbara was born August 27, 1944, in Brooklyn, NY. She moved to Weston, CT, as a child and graduated from Staples High School in Westport, CT, in 1962. She graduated from Mount Holyoke College in 1966 and moved to England that year to study art at the Ruskin School of Drawing and Fine Art at the University of Oxford. She married Giles Trentham in 1967. The marriage ended in divorce in 1970. Barbara worked as a model in London during the early 1970s. Her photograph appeared on the cover of the English edition of Vogue Magazine and other magazines numerous times. She also had supporting roles in several movies, including The Possession of Joel Delaney (1972) with Shirley MacLaine, Rollerball (1975), with James Caan, Sky Riders (1976) with James Coburn and Robert Culp, and a made for TV movie, Death Moon (1978). In the mid 1970s she moved to Los Angeles to pursue an acting career. Deciding that she wasn't an actress, Barbara worked in television in Los Angeles as a reporter and a producer of Those Amazing Animals until 1980, when she met and married British comedian and writer John Cleese and moved back to London. That marriage produced a daughter, Camilla Cleese, and ended in divorce in 1990. Shortly before, she had begun to focus again on her lifelong interest, oil painting. In 1993, she moved to Chicago, where she met George Covington, a lawyer. The two were married in 1998 and lived in Lake Bluff, IL. Barbara built an art studio at their home which became a gathering place and a source of inspiration for local artists. She co-founded a local artist organization, Artists on the Bluff.

2013-08-11T00:00:00Z,"LICHTER--George. December 14, 1921-August 2, 2013. Aviator, businessman and philanthropist, died in Boulder, Colorado, August 2, two weeks after being diagnosed with leukemia (AML). Born and raised in Brooklyn, New York, George grew up in a Jewish family with very strong extended family ties. In his childhood, airplanes were the new technology and George, from his earliest years, developed a fascination with flying. After Pearl Harbor, he volunteered for service and qualified for the U.S. Army Air Force pilot training course. He finished his training with distinction and became a fighter pilot of Mustangs and Thunderbolts, as well as of other aircraft. He was initially based in Washington, D.C. as part of the air defense of the capital and then in England, from where he flew 88 combat missions over occupied Europe including air support during the Normandy invasion. After World War II, George worked as a civilian flight instructor and private pilot. Outraged by the holocaust, he was deeply moved by the struggle to create an independent Jewish State. Although he was dubious about the survival of tiny Israel against the superiority of the Arabs, he threw in his lot with the nascent Israeli air arm by becoming one of its first and most important flight instructors. From 1948-1950, he lived in Israel and gave ""wings"" to the first Israeli pilots, who included the commander of the Israel Air Force during the Six Day War and the chief test pilot in the early decades of the state. Other air force friends went on to high positions in government and industry and included Ezer Weizmann, the late Israeli president. From the early '50s through 1990, George was active in the textile field, where he became a success with the development of Berkeley Mills, a wholesaler of drapery fabrics. He and his life-long friend and colleague, Eugene Towbin, of Boca Raton, Florida, built the business in a very focused manner and through strong customer relationships throughout the United States. After selling the business, George retired in 1995 to Boulder, where he enjoyed the company of eleven family members in three generations. He enjoyed listening to music, especially jazz, and could be moved to tears by a beautiful performance. His charities were diverse and included Jewish and Israeli causes, especially those organizations that advocated for peace and compromise. In the week before he died, George said, ""I've had a good long run"". His biography is entitled ""Ups & Downs With No Regrets"" and his story will be part of a film documentary, now in development, on Jewish-American air force volunteers in the 1948 War of Independence. His parents, Ben and Bessie Lichter and his youngest brother, Irwin, pre-deceased him. Survivors include his brother, Jules of Orlando, Florida, and his children John, Peggy and Michael, of Boulder. His former wife, Ishka Lichter, and his dear friend, Bonnie Kaye of New York City, also mourn him deeply. George Lichter died quickly, without suffering, at home, surrounded by loving family members. He had a long, wonderful life and a peaceful death."

He was 93 when he retired from his position as an adjunct full professor at Teacher's College at Columbia University after a total of 64 years teaching there. He was a lifelong and generous supporter of young professionals entering the field. He was an innovator in the field of group psychotherapy, particularly by integrating object relations theory into the practice of leading groups. In 1971, he organized a trip to London for an exchange of ideas between British and American psychoanalysts and afterwards began teaching courses in object relation theory. In 1973, he took 16 American therapists to Israel to help with bereavement following the Yom Kippur War; he traveled twice more to Israel to teach.

The cause of death was complications following pneumonia. Clay himself was an accomplished professional musician. Over the years he played guitar and sang at clubs from Greenwich Village to the Upper East Side, and his band played at functions and venues across the city and New Jersey. Clay was a graduate of Montclair High School in Montclair, NJ, Hobart College, Geneva, NY, and New York Law School. He served as a Second Lieutenant in the Army's 1st Air Calvary Division during the Vietnam War, from 1965 to 1966. He was awarded the Bronze Star and Air Medal. Clay always said that his guitar saved his life in Vietnam. While playing for a group of officers when he first arrived there, he caught the attention of an Army colonel who six months later recruited Clay as a liaison officer. Two weeks after Clay started his new job, 16 members of his platoon were killed in an enemy ambush including the lieutenant who replaced him. The tragedy marked Clay for life. Clay was the son of the late Clayton P. Knowles, a reporter for The New York Times, and the late Ruth Knowles, a civic activist. He is survived by his wife, Renata Renner Knowles, an industrial minerals consultant, his brother, Jeffrey Knowles, a lawyer in Washington, D.C., and his sister, Laurie Knowles, a lawyer in Santa Fe, NM.

2013-08-11T00:00:00Z,"DOUGLAS--Albert R.,served in the US Navy (LtJG) and Harvard class of '42, died on July 27, 2013. He served in World War II, which included piloting torpedo bombers from the escort carrier USS Savo Island. While flying reconnaissance at US landings at Leyte Gulf in the Philippines, he discovered a major Japanese fleet trying to sneak up on the landings. The major U.S. fleet had been lured well to the north to attack the major Japanese ships not realizing that the Japanese carrier planes had all been destroyed. That left the US escort carriers at Leyte to fight off the unexpected Japanese fleet by themselves. It is a dramatic and successful episode in U.S. Naval history. After having discovered the Japanese fleet, Douglas made it back to his carrier with all of his crew. Later at Leyte he was on a mission over Cebu Island when his plane was severely shot up, including its steering control. He was able to nurse the fifty foot plane back to the carrier safely with all three crew members. Douglas said he was most concerned the plane would catch fire. The plane was so badly riddled with bullet holes that it was promptly thrown overboard. For his service he was awarded the Distinguished Flying Cross and the Air Medal. Douglas was born on September 23, 1920 to Major Richard and Madeleine Dabo Douglas. He graduated from the Kent School in Connecticut in 1938 and from Harvard with a BA degree in 1942. He then enlisted in the Navy and underwent flight training as carrier pilot in Florida, and then on a training deck built for the Navy into Lake Michigan near Chicago. After the war he remained in the Navy for a time, flying virtually every kind of propeller plane in the Navy while ferrying VIP's. After leaving the Navy he worked as a stock broker and investment advisor with E.F. Hutton, among others. He continued this work until his death. Most recently he has been affiliated with A.J. Weed & Co. and R.M Stark & Co. He and his wife Celeste Murray Bartlett Douglas, known to family and friends as Murray, lived in Manhattan with a second home in Old Chatham, New York. They have been married since June 14, 1963. Mrs. Douglas was the chief designer and part owner of the famous fabric and wallpaper house of Brunschwig et Fils. Mr. and Mrs. Douglas were active in The Shaker Museum & Library, where Mrs. Douglas was a long time board member, and the Old Chatham Hunt Club. Mr. Douglas was a sixty-eight year member of the Harvard Club of New York. Albert Douglas is survived by his wife, Murray Douglas, and his step-son Francis Russel Lyons of Seattle, WA. He is also survived by his brother-in-law, Keith Lockhart of San Rafael, California and Mr. Douglas's nephews, Frank Lockhart of Olympia, WA and Douglas Lockhart of Napa, CA. His sister Jean Lockhart, MD died in 2011. A time for family and friends to share together memories of Albert's life will be held August 10, 2013, at 1pm at the Douglas's house, the School House, at the corner of County Route 13 and Ford Rd in Old Chatham, NY.

2013-08-11T00:00:00Z,"BERGER--Elizabeth, Elizabeth Berger was a great civic leader and champion of Lower Manhattan. As the President of the Alliance for Downtown New York and President of the Downtown-Lower Manhattan Association she helped shape the reimagining and rebuilding of Lower Manhattan after the 9/11 attacks and recently led an effort to assist Lower Manhattan businesses and residents recover from the effects of Superstorm Sandy. She died on August 5th at Bellevue Hospital Center. She turned 53 this past Saturday. Under Ms. Berger's leadership, the Alliance and the Downtown-Lower Manhattan Association successfully advocated for full funding and timely completion of the Fulton Street Transit Center, the reconstruction of Fiterman Hall and the enactment of post-9/11 commercial leasing incentives. Rather than focus on the district as the location of a terrible tragedy, Ms. Berger, renowned for her indefatigable energy and exacting intellect, was driven by a vision of Lower Manhattan as a place teeming with vitality and potential and a proving ground for municipal innovation. ""Liz Berger's passion, sophistication and drive shaped Lower Manhattan as surely as any skyscraper or bulldozer,"" said Robert R. Douglass the Chairman of the Alliance for Downtown New York and the Downtown-Lower Manhattan Association. ""Her strength as an advocate and strategist was only exceeded by her loyalty as a friend and her dedication as a mother and wife. She will be sorely missed."" Elizabeth Harrie Berger was born on August 3, 1960 in New York City. Ms. Berger had decades of experience in government, community affairs and strategic planning. Prior to her time with the Alliance she established and built government relations practices at the law firms Lord Day & Lord Barrett Smith and LeBoeuf, Lamb Greene & MacRae and the Law Offices of Claudia Wagner. Ms. Berger is also credited with creating the Department of Government and External Affairs at Lincoln Center. She served as an Assistant Mayoral Representative to the New York City Council during the Koch administration. A graduate of Yale College where she created her own major, The Study of the City, Ms. Berger was also involved with a variety of civic organizations in New York City beyond her professional obligations. She was at various times a board director of The Municipal Art Society, Film Forum, Second Stage Theatre, American Museum of Natural History Planetarium Authority and the New York Building Congress. She was also a mayoral appointee to the board of the Trust for Governors Island. In a statement Mayor Michael Bloomberg said of Ms. Berger ""Liz Berger loved our City with passion and gave her great intelligence and inventiveness to New York without reserve. She was more than an advocate for Lower Manhattan, she was a partner in building its future. As new transit hubs, skyscrapers, full access to our waterfront and a fresh vitality emerge downtown, Liz's influences are everywhere to be seen. We shared a vision of Lower Manhattan as a model 21st century business and residential district, and thanks to her tireless work, it's being realized before our eyes. The City mourns the loss of a great civic leader."" She is survived by her husband Frederick Kaufman, daughter Phoebe, son Julian, her mother Anita, and brother Gideon. The family will hold a private gathering for immediate family and close friends and a public memorial will be planned for the early fall.

After his service, Mr. Russell returned to New York to attend Columbia University Law School. He had a long, varied and distinguished legal career, practicing Family and Trust and Estates law, working as an accomplished litigator, and spending his final decades as a highly distinguished Banking and Securities attorney. A world traveler, Mr. Russell also claimed to have visited every state in the United States.

Mr. Russell's membership at the Sands Point Golf Club was the longest in that club's history.

2013-08-15T00:00:00Z,"SPECTER--David Kenneth. David Kenneth Specter, AIA, Architect, 82, of New York City and Sherman, CT, died on August 13, 2013 of congestive heart failure after a short illness, surrounded by his family and according to his specific instructions. He is survived by his beloved wife of 46 years, Patricia Brown, his adored sons, Prof. Matthew Goodrich Specter of New Haven (Marjan Mashhadi), and Evan Ross Specter of Berkeley (Amy) and his grandchildren, Leila Beatrix, Luka Kenneth, and Katherine Patrice. He leaves also his sister, Elinore Tilles (Bud Tilles dec), his nephews Peter Tilles (Leslie) of Princeton, NJ and Daniel Tilles (Ellen) of London, and their children, Amanda, Olivia, and Ella, and a niece, Wendy Tilles (deceased). Brooklyn-born, David attended Brooklyn Tech., Harvard College '52 (Phi Beta Kappa) and The Harvard Graduate School of Design '56. He was awarded Harvard's coveted Sheldon Traveling Fellowship in 1952-3 which formed the basis for his subsequent noted book, ""Urban Spaces"", a photographically illustrated exploration of spatial phenomena as they relate to urban design. He won the Arnold Brunner Scholarship from the Architectural League of New York. He served two years in the U.S. Army in Munich and worked in Europe. He founded the firm of David Kenneth Specter, AIA, Architects in 1963, presently Specter DeSouza Architects, PC. A classic modernist architect, he was most influenced by the work of Alvar Aalto and was concerned with the issues of urban context and appropriateness. He was best known for the Galleria (1974), one of the first mixed-use buildings in NY (its iconic penthouse was designed for Stewart Mott) and the first USTA National Tennis Center at Flushing Meadows (1978), but his favorite projects were private homes. His clients became close friends. He was a gentle gentleman. Adventurous, creative, curious, calm. He was an avid skier, a passionate photographer, a lover of all music (clarinetist in the Harvard Band), and a crack tennis player though he admitted that designing the National Tennis Center did not improve his game. At the time of his passing, he was a member of the Century Association and on the Board of Directors of The New York Landmarks Conservancy and the Neustadt Collection of Tiffany Glass. He served for 21 years on the Board of the 92nd Street Y. His father was Louis S. Specter, a Brooklyn cardiologist, who worked his way through Columbia playing the piano at the Lower East Side Settlement House, later the Sarnoff Building, for which David later redesigned the facade. His mother, Ina Rous Specter, was an illustrator for Claire McCardell and a prolific painter. His maternal grandfather, Bernard H. Rous, an engineer, held patents in 1915 for machinery to manufacture corrugated boxes and founded the Grand City Box Company in the 1920's, a leader in the industry. Contributions may be sent in his name to The Harvard Graduate School of Design or The New York Landmarks Conservancy. Funeral services private. A memorial will be announced in the Fall."

David Kenneth Specter, AIA, Architect, 82, of New York City and Sherman, CT, died on August 13, 2013 of congestive heart failure after a short illness, surrounded by his family and according to his specific instructions. He is survived by his beloved wife of 46 years, Patricia Brown, his adored sons, Prof. Matthew Goodrich Specter of New Haven (Marjan Mashhadi), and Evan Ross Specter of Berkeley (Amy) and his grandchildren, Leila Beatrix, Luka Kenneth, and Katherine Patrice. He leaves also his sister, Elinore Tilles (Bud Tilles dec), his nephews Peter Tilles (Leslie) of Princeton, NJ and Daniel Tilles (Ellen) of London, and their children, Amanda, Olivia, and Ella, and a niece, Wendy Tilles (deceased). Brooklyn-born, David attended Brooklyn Tech., Harvard College '52 (Phi Beta Kappa) and The Harvard Graduate School of Design '56. He was awarded Harvard's coveted Sheldon Traveling Fellowship in 1952-3 which formed the basis for his subsequent noted book, ""Urban Spaces"", a photographically illustrated exploration of spatial phenomena as they relate to urban design. He won the Arnold Brunner Scholarship from the Architectural League of New York. He served two years in the U.S. Army in Munich and worked in Europe. He founded the firm of David Kenneth Specter, AIA, Architects in 1963, presently Specter DeSouza Architects, PC. A classic modernist architect, he was most influenced by the work of Alvar Aalto and was concerned with the issues of urban context and appropriateness. He was best known for the Galleria (1974), one of the first mixed-use buildings in NY (its iconic penthouse was designed for Stewart Mott) and the first USTA National Tennis Center at Flushing Meadows (1978), but his favorite projects were private homes. His clients became close friends. He was a gentle gentleman. Adventurous, creative, curious, calm. He was an avid skier, a passionate photographer, a lover of all music (clarinetist in the Harvard Band), and a crack tennis player though he admitted that designing the National Tennis Center did not improve his game. At the time of his passing, he was a member of the Century Association and on the Board of Directors of The New York Landmarks Conservancy and the Neustadt Collection of Tiffany Glass. He served for 21 years on the Board of the 92nd Street Y. His father was Louis S. Specter, a Brooklyn cardiologist, who worked his way through Columbia playing the piano at the Lower East Side Settlement House, later the Sarnoff Building, for which David later redesigned the facade. His mother, Ina Rous Specter, was an illustrator for Claire McCardell and a prolific painter. His maternal grandfather, Bernard H. Rous, an engineer, held patents in 1915 for machinery to manufacture corrugated boxes and founded the Grand City Box Company in the 1920's, a leader in the industry. Contributions may be sent in his name to The Harvard Graduate School of Design or The New York Landmarks Conservancy. Funeral services private. A memorial will be announced in the Fall."

He found solace in a neighborhood filled with zany and irreverent characters. It was there in the verbally aggressive language of the street that he honed his timing and emerged with a sharp wit and fall-down funny sense of humor. Possessing a high IQ and a reputation as a wordsmith, he established himself in the ad business, as an award winning writer, a creative director, a partner in his own agency and having his exploits chronicled by his friend, advertising guru, Jerry Della Femina. He loved jazz and had an extensive record collection. He was the personification of ""the man about town"" for his time. Attractive, charming, well read, impeccably dressed, with a groovy pad on the Upper East Side of Manhattan and the best stereo system that anyone had ever heard. He was married briefly and had no children. Despite his troubles, he always managed to live life on his terms. He leaves a brother, a sister-in-law and a whole lot of family and friends who loved him. He will forever be too hip for the room. He was the best Ned we knew."

2013-08-18T00:00:00Z,"SPECTER--David Kenneth. David Kenneth Specter, AIA, Architect, 82, of New York City and Sherman, CT, died on August 13, 2013 of congestive heart failure after a short illness, surrounded by his family and according to his specific instructions. He is survived by his beloved wife of 46 years, Patricia Brown, his adored sons, Prof. Matthew Goodrich Specter of New Haven (Marjan Mashhadi), and Evan Ross Specter of Berkeley (Amy) and his grandchildren, Leila Beatrix, Luka Kenneth, and Katherine Patrice. He leaves also his sister, Elinore Tilles (Bud Tilles dec), his nephews Peter Tilles (Leslie) of Princeton, NJ and Daniel Tilles (Ellen) of London, and their children, Amanda, Olivia, and Ella, and a niece, Wendy Tilles (deceased). Brooklyn-born, David attended Brooklyn Tech., Harvard College '52 (Phi Beta Kappa) and The Harvard Graduate School of Design '56. He was awarded Harvard's coveted Sheldon Traveling Fellowship in 1952-3 which formed the basis for his subsequent noted book, ""Urban Spaces"", a photographically illustrated exploration of spatial phenomena as they relate to urban design. He won the Arnold Brunner Scholarship from the Architectural League of New York. He served two years in the U.S. Army in Munich and worked in Europe. He founded the firm of David Kenneth Specter, AIA, Architects in 1963, presently Specter DeSouza Architects, PC. A classic modernist architect, he was most influenced by the work of Alvar Aalto and was concerned with the issues of urban context and appropriateness. He was best known for the Galleria (1974), one of the first mixed-use buildings in NY (its iconic penthouse was designed for Stewart Mott) and the first USTA National Tennis Center at Flushing Meadows (1978), but his favorite projects were private homes. His clients became close friends. He was a gentle gentleman. Adventurous, creative, curious, calm. He was an avid skier, a passionate photographer, a lover of all music (clarinetist in the Harvard Band), and a crack tennis player though he admitted that designing the National Tennis Center did not improve his game. At the time of his passing, he was a member of the Century Association and on the Board of Directors of The New York Landmarks Conservancy and the Neustadt Collection of Tiffany Glass. He served for 21 years on the Board of the 92nd Street Y. His father was Louis S. Specter, a Brooklyn cardiologist, who worked his way through Columbia playing the piano at the Lower East Side Settlement House, later the Sarnoff Building, for which David later redesigned the facade. His mother, Ina Rous Specter, was an illustrator for Claire McCardell and a prolific painter. His maternal grandfather, Bernard H. Rous, an engineer, held patents in 1915 for machinery to manufacture corrugated boxes and founded the Grand City Box Company in the 1920's, a leader in the industry. Contributions may be sent in his name to The Harvard Graduate School of Design or The New York Landmarks Conservancy. Funeral services private. A memorial will be announced in the Fall."

2013-08-23T00:00:00Z,"BOISI--James O.,Passed away August 21, 2013 at his home surrounded by three generations of his family. This quintessential New Yorker was born in 1919 on the Lower East Side, and educated in the New York public school system attending Stuyvesant High School, Brooklyn College and Fordham Law School. His first position was at the law firm of Amend & Amend where he gravitated to the practice of real estate law, ultimately representing clients such as the legendary William Zeckendorf, Sr. in many real estate dealings. In 1956 he was then offered a position as real estate attorney for the New York Central Railroad eventually becoming Vice President of Real Estate. During his tenure he made a profound impact on the New York City skyline by transforming the residential corridor of Park Avenue above Grand Central Station into high-rise office towers by arranging ground leases with developers on property owned by the railroad. He was visionary in his use of utilizing the concept of ""air rights"" to increase the buildable area of buildings in NYC. In 1964, Thomas Gates recruited Mr. Boisi to Morgan Guaranty Trust Company to head a newly formed Real Estate ultimately being promoted to Executive Vice President of Corporate Finance in 1970 and then to Executive Vice President of the parent company J.P. Morgan & Co. in 1972. He headed Strategic Planning for the Bank creating an Investment Banking Group and Merger department. In 1978 Mr. Boisi was then elected Vice Chairman of the Board and Director and a member of the Corporate Office where he served until his retirement in 1984. Boisi was a staunch advocate for New York working closely with then Governor Hugh Carey establishing International Banking Facilities to lure offshore banking business back to the United States. He also helped secure financing for the transit system of NYC and was a lead banker in providing support for the Municipal Assistance Corporation (MAC) which brought NYC out of bankruptcy in 1975. Upon his mandatory retirement from the bank, Harry Helmsley persuaded him to join Helmsley Enterprises as Executive Vice President where he served from 1984 through 1987. Mr. Boisi was then asked by The British Coal Board to become Chairman of its US property subsidiary, Pan American Properties, serving from 1987 through 1990. In 1991 he set about establishing the Mentoring Partnership of Long Island. Mr. Boisi chaired the Leadership Council until 1996 and served as Co-Chair from 1996 - 2000. He has served on several Boards of Directors over his career including Cities Service Co., Denny's, J.P. Morgan & Co., Boy Scouts of America, the Real Estate Board of New York, and Mentoring Partnership of Long Island. For 51 Years of his impressive business career Mr. Boisi also taught real estate at Pace University in the evenings becoming Co-Chairman of the Department and finally a Trustee Emeritus of the University. Mr. Boisi was a devout Catholic serving as an active parishioner of St. Mary's Church and lector for Sunday Mass. He was also a Knight of Malta. Mr. Boisi is survived by his loving wife of 68 years Edith Mae Mullen, six children James, Geoffrey (Rene Isacco), Jeanne (Robert) Sheehy, Mark (Barbara Gallagher), Patricia (John) Sheehy, Eileen (William) Dobbs, 19 grandchildren and six great-grandchildren. A wake will be held at Beney Funeral Home, Syosset, NY on August 23rd from 2-5pm and 7-9pm and a Funeral Mass will be held on August 24th, 10am at St. Mary's Church, Roslyn, NY.

Born in Boston, Massachusetts to the late Robert and Doris Lynch, Bob remained a passionate Red Sox fan all of his life. He will be missed dearly by his beautiful and loving wife of 37 years, Maureen, their son Bob, who lives in Spain with his fiance, Tory, their daughter Kelly Houff, who lives in Virginia with her husband, Jeff, and their three year-old-son, Liam, to whom he was affectionately known as ""Papi"".

Bob worked in Finance for over 35 years, notably at Citibank, US Trust, and Barclays, finally retiring, for the third time, just four months before he was diagnosed with cancer. He was the mentor and friend to countless colleagues throughout the years and always set an example of hard work, fairness, and integrity.

2013-08-25T00:00:00Z,"BOURONCLE--Dr. Bertha (Pereny). Passed away surrounded by friends and family last Friday August 16th after receiving the last rites. Bertha was born in Peru in 1919. Her parents were the Harvard-educated Dr. Luis H. Bouroncle and Carmela Bouroncle Gonzalez-Quint. She was the fourth of five children, Luis, Consuelo, Maruja and Antonio. She is survived by Consuelo. Bertha spent most of her life and career as a Professor of Medicine at The Ohio State University (OSU). Before moving to Columbus, she graduated at the top of her class from the San Marcos Medical School in Peru. Bertha became a world-renowned medical researcher, a beloved teacher to thousands of medical students, having been named Professor of the Year multiple times and the first woman chief resident and the first female full professor of Medicine in Ohio. Her biggest accomplishment as a researcher was the identification of a formerly fatal type of leukemia, now mostly treatable thanks to her lifetime efforts and the efforts of her disciples that are continuing her dream of finding a cure to all cancers. Dr. Bouroncle was instrumental in the creation of The Ohio State University, Arthur G. James Cancer Hospital and Richard J. Solove Research Institute, affectionately known as ""The James."" Today thousands and possibly tens of thousands of cancer survivors are able to share their lives with their beloved ones thanks to the discoveries from the research led by Dr. Bouroncle. In addition to her research, she also was the ultimate patient advocate and a consummate teacher. Upon her retirement in 1989, OSU created the so-called ""Bertha Bouroncle Day"" to honor bright students and young researchers in medicine. Dr. Bouroncle has given back to the community in her lifetime by creating the Bertha Bouroncle and Andrew Pereny Chair of Medicine to fund in perpetuity an endowed professorship in Medicine at the Ohio State University College of Medicine. Bertha was a supporter of the Columbus Symphony, the Columbus Zoo and Aquarium, and also loved the ballet and the arts. Bertha was preceded in death by her husband, the industrialist Andrew Pereny. Andrew passed away in 1983. Bertha is the most beloved icon of the entire Bouroncle family and an icon at OSU, as her entire family as well as countless colleagues and patients at the Ohio State University can attest. Bertha is survived by 11 nieces and nephews, 27 grand-nieces and nephews and 16 great grand-nieces and nephews, and by Burke Showe and his children and grandchildren, her ""Columbus family."" Those wishing to honor Bertha's memory can send funds to the Bertha Bouroncle Fund at The Ohio State University, 660 Ackerman Road Room 651, PO Box 183112, Columbus, Ohio 43218 to the attention: Steve Chaykowski, Stephen.Chaykowski@osumc.edu or call 614-293-3745.

2013-08-25T00:00:00Z,"BOURONCLE--Dr. Bertha (Pereny). Passed away surrounded by friends and family last Friday August 16th after receiving the last rites. Bertha was born in Peru in 1919. Her parents were the Harvard-educated Dr. Luis H. Bouroncle and Carmela Bouroncle Gonzalez-Quint. She was the fourth of five children, Luis, Consuelo, Maruja and Antonio. She is survived by Consuelo. Bertha spent most of her life and career as a Professor of Medicine at The Ohio State University (OSU). Before moving to Columbus, she graduated at the top of her class from the San Marcos Medical School in Peru. Bertha became a world-renowned medical researcher, a beloved teacher to thousands of medical students, having been named Professor of the Year multiple times and the first woman chief resident and the first female full professor of Medicine in Ohio. Her biggest accomplishment as a researcher was the identification of a formerly fatal type of leukemia, now mostly treatable thanks to her lifetime efforts and the efforts of her disciples that are continuing her dream of finding a cure to all cancers. Dr. Bouroncle was instrumental in the creation of The Ohio State University, Arthur G. James Cancer Hospital and Richard J. Solove Research Institute, affectionately known as ""The James.""

2013-08-25T00:00:00Z,"BOISI--James O.,Passed away August 21, 2013 at his home surrounded by three generations of his family. This quintessential New Yorker was born in 1919 on the Lower East Side, and educated in the New York public school system attending Stuyvesant High School, Brooklyn College and Fordham Law School. His first position was at the law firm of Amend & Amend where he gravitated to the practice of real estate law, ultimately representing clients such as the legendary William Zeckendorf, Sr. in many real estate dealings. In 1956 he was then offered a position as real estate attorney for the New York Central Railroad eventually becoming Vice President of Real Estate. During his tenure he made a profound impact on the New York City skyline by transforming the residential corridor of Park Avenue above Grand Central Station into high-rise office towers by arranging ground leases with developers on property owned by the railroad. He was visionary in his use of utilizing the concept of ""air rights"" to increase the buildable area of buildings in NYC. In 1964, Thomas Gates recruited Mr. Boisi to Morgan Guaranty Trust Company to head a newly formed Real Estate ultimately being promoted to Executive Vice President of Corporate Finance in 1970 and then to Executive Vice President of the parent company J.P. Morgan & Co. in 1972. He headed Strategic Planning for the Bank creating an Investment Banking Group and Merger department. In 1978 Mr. Boisi was then elected Vice Chairman of the Board and Director and a member of the Corporate Office where he served until his retirement in 1984. Boisi was a staunch advocate for New York working closely with then Governor Hugh Carey establishing International Banking Facilities to lure offshore banking business back to the United States. He also helped secure financing for the transit system of NYC and was a lead banker in providing support for the Municipal Assistance Corporation (MAC) which brought NYC out of bankruptcy in 1975. Upon his mandatory retirement from the bank, Harry Helmsley persuaded him to join Helmsley Enterprises as Executive Vice President where he served from 1984 through 1987. Mr. Boisi was then asked by The British Coal Board to become Chairman of its US property subsidiary, Pan American Properties, serving from 1987 through 1990. In 1991 he set about establishing the Mentoring Partnership of Long Island. Mr. Boisi chaired the Leadership Council until 1996 and served as Co-Chair from 1996 - 2000. He has served on several Boards of Directors over his career including Cities Service Co., Denny's, J.P. Morgan & Co., Boy Scouts of America, the Real Estate Board of New York, and Mentoring Partnership of Long Island. For 51 Years of his impressive business career Mr. Boisi also taught real estate at Pace University in the evenings becoming Co-Chairman of the Department and finally a Trustee Emeritus of the University. Mr. Boisi was a devout Catholic serving as an active parishioner of St. Mary's Church and lector for Sunday Mass. He was also a Knight of Malta. Mr. Boisi is survived by his loving wife of 68 years Edith Mae Mullen, six children James, Geoffrey (Rene Isacco), Jeanne (Robert) Sheehy, Mark (Barbara Gallagher), Patricia (John) Sheehy, Eileen (William) Dobbs, 19 grandchildren and six great-grandchildren. In lieu of flowers, donations may be made to Mentoring Partnership of Long Island."

2013-08-25T00:00:00Z,"ANTONAKOS--Stephen, 86, died suddenly August 17th, interrupting a life in art active since the 1950s. Known for his abstract, spatial work with neon from 1960 to the present, Antonakos defined his work as ""real things in real spaces"" -- avoiding representation, illusion, symbolism. The activation of the space occupied by both the art and the viewer, and the crucial architectural placement of forms, were defining characteristics of decades of work that redefined neon as capable of great formal subtlety and, often, spiritual power. His complete and incomplete neon circles and squares and their spatial relationships to their sites connect his work with Minimalism, but Antonakos's distinctive lightness allows a certain openness in interpretation. Even with the large Public Works he said he hoped to reach the inner person. In addition to the neon work, there are Artist's Books, reliefs, collages, prints, and an enormous history of drawings on paper and vellum -- often folded, cut, layered, or crumpled. Recent series of cut or crumpled gold leaf sheets continued his investigation into questions of light. Since the 1960s he has exhibited in New York and across the US and in Europe in hundreds of shows. Among the outstanding exhibitions were ""Ten Outdoor Neons, Fort Worth,"" 1974; Documenta 6, 1977; ""Chapel of the Saints,"" 1993, Rhodes; Venice Biennale, 1997; Marzona Collection, Hamburger Bahnhof; 2001-2002; A Retrospective, 2007-8, Athens, org. by the J.F. Costopoulos Foundation; and ""The Search,"" 2011, Elefsina. Shows in 2013 include paper work at The Drawing Room, East Hampton; the early ""Pillows"" at Lori Bookstein Fine Art, Chelsea; the 1965 ""Hanging Neon"" in ""Dynamo"" at the Grand Palais; and ""4 Directions"" at the Konrad Fischer Galerie, Berlin. Over 50 Public Works have been installed in such cities as Athens, Bari, Dijon, Frankfurt, Los Angeles, New York, Odessa, Tel Aviv, Tokyo, and Seattle. Antonakos's work is represented in numerous private and public collections, including The Metropolitan Museum of Art, The Museum of Modern Art, the Whitney Museum of American Art, the Solomon R. Guggenheim Museum, the National Gallery in D.C., and the National Museums of Contemporary Art in Athens and Salonica. Major publications include Irving Sandler's 1997 monograph and the catalog for the Athens Retrospective, with essays by Martin Filler, Eleftherios Ikonomou, Katerina Koskina, Daniel Marzona, and Brian O'Doherty. In 2011 he received Lifetime Achievement Awards from the National Academy of Art and Museum, and from the Greek American Foundation. A modest man of great gentleness and sensitivity, he made bold, original investigations into the open experience of form, color, and light in space. Antonakos was born November 1, 1926 in the small Greek village of Agios Nikolaos, Laconia. He often mentioned remembering the sunrises there. He came to New York at the age of 4 with his parents Thomas and Evangelia (Gregory), his brothers Bill, Peter, and Tony, and his sister Kanella. He grew up in Bay Ridge and served in the Philippines in WWII. He is survived by his wife Naomi Spector, his children Stephen B Antonakos, a musician, and Evangelia Mary Spector Antonakos, a mathematician, and many loving relatives and friends. We will miss his energy and his warmth. Viewings at Frank E. Campbell, 1076 Madison Ave., Thursday August 29 from 5 to 9pm and Friday August 30 from 2 to 5pm. Funeral at St. John the Baptist Greek Orthodox Church, 143 East 17th St., Saturday August 31 at 10am."

After a long and successful career in finance, he relocated to Berkshire County, Massachusetts, where he gave freely of his boundless energy, serving as chairman of the local school district, treasurer of the historical society and village association in New Marlborough, and board member of the Mahaiwe Theater. He also served on the boards of the Rumsey Hall School, the Lenox Library and the Edith Wharton Restoration. He was a supporter of the Muscular Dystrophy Association and the National Association for Learning Disabilities, and a long-time member of the Wyantenuck Golf Club. Together with beloved wife and girlfriend Betsy, he raised llamas, pygmy goats, and other exotic animals at the aptly-named Random Farm. He delighted in welcoming people with disabilities, schoolchildren, and other visitors to the farm. He drove for Meals-On-Wheels and was never happier than when launching fleets of model rockets or giving tractor rides to delight younger guests. His kindnesses to others were legion, and often performed in secret. Few who met him were not richer for the experience. He attended Stuyvesant High School and graduated Wharton School. A career on Wall Street led to senior positions at Morgan Stanley and First Boston before co-founding Abelow-Ihasz. He is survived by his beloved and loving wife Betsy Ross Colhoun; his four children: Bradley, Lisa Hedley, Justin and Hawley; eleven grandchildren: Sarah, Hannah, and Daniel Abelow; Powell, Nicholas, LilyClaire, and Iris Hedley; Campbell and Libby Abelow; Kasper Schmiedl; and, Everett Dalrymple; daughters-in-law Carolyn Murray and Sallie Judd Abelow; sons-in-law Tom Hedley and Phil Schmiedl; brother Richard and sister-in-law Betty Abelow; and step-daughter Kyle Utter."

2013-08-26T00:00:00Z,"ANTONAKOS--Stephen, 86, died suddenly August 17th, interrupting a life in art active since the 1950s. Known for his abstract, spatial work with neon from 1960 to the present, Antonakos defined his work as ""real things in real spaces"" -- avoiding representation, illusion, symbolism. The activation of the space occupied by both the art and the viewer, and the crucial architectural placement of forms, were defining characteristics of decades of work that redefined neon as capable of great formal subtlety and, often, spiritual power. His complete and incomplete neon circles and squares and their spatial relationships to their sites connect his work with Minimalism, but Antonakos's distinctive lightness allows a certain openness in interpretation. Even with the large Public Works he said he hoped to reach the inner person. In addition to the neon work, there are Artist's Books, reliefs, collages, prints, and an enormous history of drawings on paper and vellum -- often folded, cut, layered, or crumpled. Recent series of cut or crumpled gold leaf sheets continued his investigation into questions of light. Since the 1960s he has exhibited in New York and across the US and in Europe in hundreds of shows. Among the outstanding exhibitions were ""Ten Outdoor Neons, Fort Worth,"" 1974; Documenta 6, 1977; ""Chapel of the Saints,"" 1993, Rhodes; Venice Biennale, 1997; Marzona Collection, Hamburger Bahnhof; 2001-2002; A Retrospective, 2007-8, Athens, org. by the J.F. Costopoulos Foundation; and ""The Search,"" 2011, Elefsina. Shows in 2013 include paper work at The Drawing Room, East Hampton; the early ""Pillows"" at Lori Bookstein Fine Art, Chelsea; the 1965 ""Hanging Neon"" in ""Dynamo"" at the Grand Palais; and ""4 Directions"" at the Konrad Fischer Galerie, Berlin. Over 50 Public Works have been installed in such cities as Athens, Bari, Dijon, Frankfurt, Los Angeles, New York, Odessa, Tel Aviv, Tokyo, and Seattle. Antonakos's work is represented in numerous private and public collections, including The Metropolitan Museum of Art, The Museum of Modern Art, the Whitney Museum of American Art, the Solomon R. Guggenheim Museum, the National Gallery in D.C., and the National Museums of Contemporary Art in Athens and Salonica. Major publications include Irving Sandler's 1997 monograph and the catalog for the Athens Retrospective, with essays by Martin Filler, Eleftherios Ikonomou, Katerina Koskina, Daniel Marzona, and Brian O'Doherty. In 2011 he received Lifetime Achievement Awards from the National Academy of Art and Museum, and from the Greek American Foundation. A modest man of great gentleness and sensitivity, he made bold, original investigations into the open experience of form, color, and light in space. Antonakos was born November 1, 1926 in the small Greek village of Agios Nikolaos, Laconia. He often mentioned remembering the sunrises there. He came to New York at the age of 4 with his parents Thomas and Evangelia (Gregory), his brothers Bill, Peter, and Tony, and his sister Kanella. He grew up in Bay Ridge and served in the Philippines in WWII. He is survived by his wife Naomi Spector, his children Stephen B Antonakos, a musician, and Evangelia Mary Spector Antonakos, a mathematician, and many loving relatives and friends. We will miss his energy and his warmth. Viewings at Frank E. Campbell, 1076 Madison Ave., Thursday August 29 from 5 to 9pm and Friday August 30 from 2 to 5pm.

2013-08-27T00:00:00Z,"NUNEZ--Eladio Alvarez. His passing on August 19, 2013, at age 85 is deeply mourned by his colleagues in the Department of Pathology and Cell Biology at Columbia's College of Physicians and Surgeons. Ed made a deep impression, both on fellow faculty members and on the many students of medicine and dentistry that were fortunate to have had Ed as a teacher. He was renowned for the booming optimism that allowed him to overcome the adversity that filled his early life. Ed was born in Spain in 1928 to parents on the losing side of the Spanish Civil War. That drove him first to a refugee camp in France and then, at the age of eight, to foster parents in New York. His education in NYC public schools had to be managed in English, which he rapidly acquired. After serving in the US Army during the Korean War, Ed earned a bachelor's degree from St. Johns University and a PhD from NYU. He began his career at Cornell Medical School but soon moved to Columbia University, where he served as a professor from 1975 to 2009. Ed made major contributions to knowledge of the cellular biology of thyroid parafollicular cells with the support of a Career Development Award and subsequent research grants from the National Institutes of Health. Ed will be remembered fondly as an indefatigable and enthusiastic director of courses in both medical and dental curricula. We extend our sympathy to Ed's wife, Selina; his two sons, Robert and Richard (a P&S graduate); his daughter, Terra; and his three grandchildren.

Born at home on Berkeley Road, Merion, PA, in 1916, Jean Todd Beggs was daughter to Hilda Farr and Robert A. Beggs Jr., he being a businessman and alumnus of University of Pennsylvania's Wharton School and Penn Law. The youngest of three sisters, Jean and her siblings shared a joyful childhood together, made memorable by time spent with adoring grandparents on both sides, including the Hon. John R. Farr, Speaker of the Pennsylvania House of Representatives and later a United States Congressman from the Pennsylvania's 10th District. Jean recalled, as an independent young woman, driving her Model ""A"" Ford down Montgomery Avenue to Miss Wright's School in Bryn Mawr, and then navigating further the long route to brand new Bennington College, where she was in the pioneering Class of 1937. In 1939, she was married to Herbert P. Colfelt Jr., of New York and Haverford, an aeronautical engineer with Piasecki/BoeingVertol. The couple had met at a dance, when Mr. Colfelt was a student at The Haverford School. They would settle in central Philadelphia's English Village near Rittenhouse Square, where for over 65 years, Mrs. Colfelt lived, and thrived on life in the City. From Philadelphia Orchestra matinees and New Year's concerts, to marriage and raising a son within steps of science and art museums, to purposeful errands at Wanamaker's or Stawbridge's, she gave up the car and took pride in walking everywhere she went. A devoted mother herself, Jean cared for her mother through multiple sclerosis and then for husband Herbert during cancer, until his death in 1987. Mrs. Colfelt spent her later years in happy enjoyment at Waverly Heights, in Gladwyne. Predeceased by sisters Louise Beggs Stern, an actress, and Bette Beggs Ashford, a painter.

Born in 1917 to Winifred and Charles Touhey, he was a graduate of the Albany Academy and Princeton University (1939). He ran a stunning race for Mayor of Albany in 1973 almost defeating the notorious Albany democratic machine. He was the President of Orange Motor Company, which was founded by his father, Charles, on Friday the 13th 1916. Carl always chuckled at that date, adding, ""And we're still standing, still strong!"" For over 75 years his various businesses provided employment for hundreds of Albany area families. A passionate philanthropist, he felt the responsibility to give back to his community. When asking others to do the same, he had an interesting strategy. He would say ""How can I get big bucks from this guy? First I need to set the tone by stepping up myself."" And he did. Some of his favorite organizations were more traditional ones such as Albany Medical Center, The College of Saint Rose, and Saratoga Performing Arts Center. But he also cared about smaller organizations like Capital Region Sponsor a Scholar and the 15 Love Youth Program both of which directly serve families in the community. He will be greatly missed by his wife, Nancy, and his children, Charles, John, Lila Marie, Virginia, their spouses, as well as the mother of his children, Lila L. Touhey, and seven grandchildren and great grandchildren. Predeceased by his sister, Alice, and his brother, Frank, Carl was a surrogate father to their children as well as Nancy's many children and grandchildren.

2013-09-01T00:00:00Z,"ROZYCKI--Danuta Lola, M.D.,a pioneer as one of the first female Ear, Nose and Throat Surgeons in the United States, and a Holocaust survivor, died on August 7, 2013 at Montefiore Medical Center. The cause of death was stroke. Dr. Rozycki was born May 30, 1932 in Maniewicz, Poland. Her family survived the Holocaust by fleeing to the forests of Southeast Poland with the help of a Righteous Gentile and later joining the Partisans. As an eight year old, Dr. Rozycki became a Partisan scout because she quickly learned to read the forest. Small and swift, she was able to quietly look for enemies and find her way back to the camp to report. Family members have been decorated by the Russian government for taking part in acts of sabotage against the Nazis in Poland. After the war, Dr. Rozycki remained in Poland, and obtained her medical degree. While in medical school, she met and married her husband of 57 years, Dr. Ludwik Rozycki. In 1957, the Rozyckis emigrated to Israel where their two daughters were born. Dr. Rozycki completed a second medical residency at Beilinson Hospital in Petach Tikva. Her patients at Beilinson included Golda Meir and David Ben Gurion. In 1966, the Rozycki family emigrated to the New York area where Dr. Rozycki completed her third medical residency at NYU Medical Center. In 1968, she affiliated with Albert Einstein College of Medicine, where she taught Ear, Nose and Throat Surgery. In addition to ENT, Dr. Rozycki specialized in Head and Neck Surgery. She later rose to the position of Director of the Department of ENT Surgery at Montefiore Hospital, at the West Campus of Albert Einstein. There she became Professor of ENT and Associate Professor of Pediatrics. Dr. Rozycki pioneered a number of surgical techniques, including treatment for sleep apnea, and collaborative work with the Department of Neurosurgery in surgical treatment of Pituitary Gland Disease. She retired in 1993. Two things meant more to Dr. Rozycki than anything else -- the welfare of her patients and the welfare of her family. Dr. Rozycki is survived by her husband, Dr. Ludwik Rozycki of Hartsdale and Rancho Mirage, California, her daughters, Sarit Rozycki (Robert Cromwell) and Avital Soldatenko (Gregory), both of Scarsdale, her sister, Helen Eichenwald, of Basel, Switzerland, her brother, Moshe Brat, of Tel Aviv, Israel, and three grandchildren. Her body was interred in Israel, where the family sat Shiva. A public memorial service will be held at Westchester Reform Temple in Scarsdale on September 10, 2013 at 10am. Memorial contributions may be sent to American Friends of Magen David Adom."

Bob was born February 24, 1946, to Frederick E. Rose and Leah Hoggan Rose in Salt Lake City, Utah. He obtained a Bachelors of Science from the University of Utah in 1971. He was an active member and alumnus of Kappa Sigma, Delta-Sigma Chapter. After graduating college, Bob entered the financial services industry, where he worked for 45 years, spending the last 39 years at Morgan Stanley and its predecessor firms, including Dean Witter Reynolds. He was a member of the Chairman's Club for 23 consecutive years and cultivated deep and long-lasting relationships throughout every level of the firm. He was the consummate professional and a willing mentor to so many throughout his career. As Bob's long-time friend and colleague, Phillip J. Purcell, former Chairman and CEO of Morgan Stanley stated, ""Bob was one of the most talented and admired financial advisors in the industry. He was respected and beloved by his clients and colleagues."" Bob took great pleasure in his work and happily spent his last day alive at his office.

Another close and long-time friend, Dr. Chris Hill, Athletic Director of the University of Utah said of Bob, ""His passion for the University was made clear by his genuine and energetic involvement in so many aspects of the institution he loved. The University is a better place because of Bob."" Bob was a loyal friend, sage counselor, and gracious gentleman. He was an engaging, witty, and well-dressed socialite with an uncanny ability to recall names and facts, recount entertaining anecdotes, and offer insightful analyses on a wide range of subjects. As such, he was often the life of any event he attended. He loved good dinners with good friends. Bob was a passionate skier and, on winter weekends, could almost always be found catching the first chairlift at Deer Valley (where he maintained a perfect season-pass record) and, apres ski, holding court at Stein Eriksen Lodge. He also enjoyed golfing with his friends and picked the perfect moment for his first (and only) hole-in-one The Bear's Club in Jupiter, Florida. His early and continuing love of cars (Porsches, in particular) is legendary. He lived life with no regrets. Bob was preceded in death by his parents and his sister, Julianne, who died at birth. He is survived by his brother, Rick (Linda) Rose; his nieces, Allyson (Daron) Cameron and Meredith (Scott) Palfreyman; his grandnieces and grandnephews, Ben, Nick, and Hannah Cameron and Sam and Jack Palfreyman, whom Bob treated as his own children; his ""stepson,"" Christopher M.

Malcolm owned the largest complex of automobile dealerships in the Town of Greenwich, which he built from 1955 until 1999. He was devoted to his employees and customers, and his concentration on customer service earned the Pray Automobile Corporation organization a national reputation for excellence of which he was very proud. In 1999, he sold his business so he could create the Pray Achievement Center where he has inspired many young people to make goals and reach for them. He used his extensive collection of exotic vintage cars to incentivize young people with a desire to be successful. Since it opened in 2001, over eight thousand visitors have heard Mr. Pray's message of encouragement and learned the steps necessary to be successful in the world of business today. Malcolm has received many youth organization, civic and charitable awards for his continued efforts with local charities throughout his lifetime. The Greenwich Boy Scouts, Boys and Girls Club, Historical Society of the Town of Greenwich, Greenwich Red Cross, USO of Metropolitan New York, and the Greenwich Chamber of Commerce are among the recipients of his energy and contributions. For over forty years he worked enthusiastically with local and national Republican Party candidates and was awarded the Prescott Bush Award from the Connecticut Republicans in 1998. He was a proud American and a true patriot. He chaired two National Dealer Councils (Volkswagen and Porsche-Audi) in addition to an automobile trade association of imported car dealers in the United States, the Connecticut Volkswagen Dealers and Connecticut Automotive Trades Association. He is survived by his wife, Natalie, daughters Sabrina Forsythe and her daughters, Courtney and Nicole Fischer, Melanie (Lilly) Pray and her daughter Portia Pray of Boulder, Colorado, Justina Pray and her daughter Natasha and son Parker Grayson, and Malcolm's sister Sandra Pray Culbert. Malcolm was pre-deceased by his son, Malcolm Sheldon Pray, III who died in 1986. Malcolm's wish was that his greatest legacy would be the Pray Achievement Center, in Banksville, New York, and he made plans to endow the Center for the future. In lieu of flowers, we ask that contributions be made to the Pray Family Foundation, which will operate the Achievement Center, so that we may continue the Malcolm Pray mission of inspiring young minds.

2013-09-01T00:00:00Z,"LAWSON--Trina Richner. In loving memory of Trina who passed away on August 27, 2013 after a three year battle with cancer. She was born in 1944 to George and Bee (Young) Richner in Baltimore, Maryland. During her childhood she moved 17 times with her parents settling in Richmond, VA for her longest stay and attended Thomas Jefferson High School. She went to Vassar College and graduated cum laude majoring in History. Upon graduation Trina moved to New York City and started the first of her three careers at Young & Rubicam Advertising firm. She changed to BBD&O where she was Director of Corporate Communications. She moved to Ready Communications and ended her advertising career at Ebasco Services. She then switched to executive recruiting and worked at Search Associates with her father, the owner. For twelve years they worked together finding recruits for executive positions until George's retirement when they closed the firm. Trina was not happy in retirement so, on a lark, she responded to an advertisement for holiday sales help at Tiffany & Company where she spent two exciting months. Management asked her to stay on with the Schlumberger Collection, a position she gladly accepted, soon becoming the manager. Eight years later Trina was offered a buy-out package and started her second retirement. Ninety days later, Tiffany asked her to come back part time to work as a Client Development Professional where she worked until very recently. Trina leaves her husband, Ted, whom she married in 1974 after a whirlwind five week courtship. Trina and Ted were always inseparable and a perfect match for each other. Trina was a member of the Fifth Avenue Presbyterian Church for over 40 years where she was married to Ted Lawson and was active and an officer. In recent years she and Ted changed to the Marble Collegiate Church. Trina always was a snappy dresser and her interests were people, politics, the arts and traveling.

2013-09-01T00:00:00Z,"FLAKS--Stephen R. During the 1970s, on the nightly news in New York City, an elderly African-American grandmother spoke through tears about her lack of money to pay her bills, such as rent, heating and other apartment fees. If she could not pay her bills, then she would probably die on the streets with her personal effects because her distant family did not have enough money to help her. A couple of hours later a mysterious venture capitalist drove up to the grandmother's small apartment in Harlem and handed her a check. He did this anonymously. This anonymous charitable donor had the name of Steve Flaks. He was a venture capitalist, family man, arts patron, world traveler, philanthropist, and cinema producer. He carved out his own American Dream, while always holding on to his integrity. Stephen Robert Flaks, Venture Capitalist and Renaissance man, age 72, resident of Scottsdale, AZ, died peacefully on August 30th at the Mayo Clinic in Phoenix. Steve, one of three children, was born in New York City, on January 1, 1941. He grew up in the shadows of Yankee Stadium in the Bronx. But like his dad Jack before him, he was a New York Giants baseball team supporter when they still played at the Polo Grounds. Steve Flaks was an outstanding student, graduating with a B.A. from CCNY Baruch College in 1961. Harvard offered him a scholarship to its Business School, but Steve decided to work for Dreyfus Investments. He then began his ascent on Wall Street, even setting up his own successful brokerage firm. He later managed a successful private biotech hedge fund and fulfilled his film production aspirations, producing two films. While earning profits on his stock holdings, his favorite beneficiaries represented educational access, women's rights, animal rights and the environment. He especially supported arts organizations and fine arts in the Scottsdale region. His activities did not however end with philanthropy. Always fascinated by history and culture, Steve and his wife Beverly visited many of the world's continents. They toured on African safaris, trekked through China and India, and travelled by boat through the Amazon in Brazil. He was also a passionate New York Giants football fan, attending two of their recent Super Bowls. Most importantly, Steve Flaks was a dedicated family man. He was very happily married to his wife Beverly for 46 years. They birthed two sons, James and David, and they have two beloved dogs, Luni and Luna. Two sisters, Betty and Vicki, and daughter-in-law Jen, married to David, survive him. His family plans to continue his philanthropic work, carrying on his vision to help the less fortunate."

2013-09-01T00:00:00Z,"FINKELSTEIN--Nina, died peacefully in her sleep on August 26th at the age of 86 in New York, her beloved city. Nina was the dearly beloved wife of the late Bill Finkelstein. She was the beloved mother of Jane Finkelstein of Rhode island and Emily Kravinsky of Philadelphia, the dearly loved grandmother of Josh, Sarah, Lev and Eli, the beloved sister of Michael Sachs and the late David Sachs. Nina was deeply loved by numerous friends, cousins, nieces and nephews to whom she was endlessly loyal and supportive. Nina was born in Cleveland, Ohio in 1927 as Nina Rose Sachs, daughter of Alfred Henry (Alter Chaim) and Estelle Dolcort Sachs. Nina moved with her family to New York at age 20 after attending college at Case Western Reserve. She completed her bachelor's degree in New York. In college, she was the National Secretary of the Intercollegiate Zionist Federation of America. In 1953, Nina married the great love and best friend of her life, Bill Finkelstein. Bill died tragically in 1991 of ALS. No relationship could have combined enduring love and friendship more powerfully than Nina and Bill's marriage. Nina worked in several publishing houses as an editor including Dell, Fawcett and Bantam. She was the executive director of World Monuments Fund. She became one of the founding editors of Ms. Magazine in 1971 and was deeply invested in the feminist movement. Following her retirement in 1988, Nina became involved in a myriad of volunteer activities including reading to the blind, teaching English as a second language, GED mentorship for disadvantaged young women and tutoring special needs children in inner city schools. In all of her volunteer jobs, Nina formed deep and personal connections with the people she worked with that always had a quality of deep respect and reciprocity. Nina was deeply committed to a sense of justice and was always there to advocate for people. As an example, she arranged a rent strike in our building in the early 70's and was the first parent to stand up to her children's school in a successful effort to sanction an abusive teacher and to have her removed. She took action. She was fiercely protective. Always attuned to the needs of others, she brought home books for years for her husband and children that perfectly matched their interests of the time. Wonderful books seemed to emerge magically and ceaselessly from her black work bag. Nina was deeply committed to her family and friends. She had a passion for travel. She and her beloved husband Bill spent 25 consecutive summers in Venice at the Pensione Seguso and later traveled to India and many other European and Asian countries. Nina had boundless intellectual curiosity and adored reading. She was always immersed in a book and frequently consulted with her friend Chris Lenahan, the manager of the Corner Bookstore, about contemporary literature. Nina was passionate about New York and also deeply loved the small seaside town of PointLookout where she and our family spent many blissfully happy summers. In latter years, she became increasingly disabled by arthritis and poor mobility following a stroke. In spite of her pain and ongoing, profound grief for her late husband, Bill, she persevered with remarkably heroic courage, taking classes at Hunter College and traveling until she was no longer able to continue due to poor mobility. She read endlessly and saw numerous movies, plays, opera and ballet. She was an avid and highly skilled bridge player, winning a number of tournaments which she was always quite modest about. During her last hospitalization following a fall, her friends organized a bridge game in a hall at Mt. Sinai. In her last weeks, she had a characteristically warm and enlivening dinner party at her home with several beloved friends. Nina deeply loved and always felt a great interest in her four grandchildren. When she was unable to continue to travel to Philadelphia to visit them, she maintained contact by telephone. When the children were young, she arranged memorable vacations for them and also always strove to find them toys and books that she knew they loved just as she had done for her children. Nina was overcome with happiness to be able to participate in the Bar Mitzvah of her youngest grandchild, Eli, this past December. Nina will always be remembered by those who knew her best for a spirit of commitment to the people she loved and to the causes she felt deeply about. She had more earnestness and courage than anyone I have ever known. She was always there to provide support and was very quiet about her own struggles and pain. We will love her and yearn for her forever and feel endlessly grateful for her unfailing, quiet generosity, loyalty and presence. If only there were more time to give back more in return."

2013-09-04T00:00:00Z,"BRENNEMAN--David Cameron, resident of Chappaqua, NY, died on August 31, 2013, after a fierce 16-month-long battle with a rare and aggressive form of sarcoma. He was born April 10, 1976, in Natick, Massachusetts to Ruth and Tom Brenneman. In his short life, David worked hard to realize many dreams. Throughout his academic career, he prided himself on being a true scholar-athlete. In addition to track and soccer, he captained his Natick High School basketball team and continued to run track in college. David earned his BA, summa cum laude, in International Relations and Russian from Colby College and went on to Yale for his Master's in Slavic Studies and to Harvard Law School for his JD. Upon graduation, he started working as an attorney for Davis, Polk & Wardwell in Manhattan. Subsequently, he became Vice President at Banc of America. In 2007, David moved to Morgan Stanley, where he loved working for the past six years, most recently as an Executive Director within MS Equity Risk Management. Throughout his battle with cancer, he felt that Morgan Stanley was a true second home to him. David met his wife, Mina Brenneman, at Yale in 1998, and they marked their 11th wedding anniversary on August 24, 2013, the day David was hospitalized at Memorial Sloan-Kettering. Even in the final days of his life, David continued to be a doting, gentle and incredibly involved father to his three young children: Will, 8, AJ, 6, and Maggie, 3. He was known to family, friends, colleagues and, lately, doctors and nurses at MSKCC, as a true gentleman, one with a dry sense of humor, sharp wit, a passion for fine wines and good thrillers, and a lucid grasp of abstract concepts, be they literary, legal or financial. Born to a family of educators, teaching was in his blood, and he was also highly respected for his negotiation and people skills. In April 2013, David was presented with a Courage Award by the Sarcoma Foundation of America, an organization for which David helped raise hundreds of thousands of dollars for sarcoma research. He lived up to the honor and responsibility of this award to his final breath and never gave up in spirit. Besides his parents, wife, and children, David is survived by his two brothers, two grandparents, two nieces, a nephew, in-laws, numerous aunts, uncles, and cousins. Visitation will be Wednesday, September 4, 4-8pm at Cassidy-Flynn Funeral Home, 288 East Main St., Mt. Kisco, NY. A private cremation will be held on September 5. There will be a memorial celebration of David's life at a later date, details to be announced.

2013-09-05T00:00:00Z,"GOTTHELF--Philosopher Allan Stanley, died of cancer at age 70 on Friday, August 30th, at his home in Philadelphia, in the company of his dear friend Cassandra Love. A memorial service will be held Saturday, September 7, at 10am at the St. Regis Hotel in Manhattan; burial will be at Kensico Cemetery in Valhalla, N.Y., at 3pm. Gotthelf is best known for his scholarship on Aristotle and on Ayn Rand, with whom Gotthelf was friends. At the time of his death he was Anthem Foundation Distinguished Fellow in the Rutgers University philosophy department. He is also an emeritus professor of philosophy at The College of New Jersey and a Life Member of Clare Hall, Cambridge University, and between 2003 and 2012 was a visiting professor of the history and philosophy of science at the University of Pittsburgh, where he held an Anthem Fellowship for the Study of Objectivism. David Charles (Oxford University) speaks of Gotthelf's ""decisive role in the renaissance of scholarly and philosophical interest in Aristotle's biological writings,"" and Alan Code (Stanford University) comments that ""no scholar has had a deeper and more lasting impact on the scholarly understanding of Aristotle's biological corpus than Allan Gotthelf."" Gotthelf made this impact through a series of path-breaking essays now collected in Teleology, First Principles, and Scientific Method in Aristotle's Biology (Oxford University Press, 2012) and through the conferences and workshops he organized. These events formed the basis for two books: Philosophical Issues In Aristotle's Biology (Cambridge University Press, 1987), which Gotthelf co-edited with James G. Lennox (The University of Pittsburgh), and Aristotle on Nature and Living Things (Mathesis, 1985). The latter book, which Gotthelf edited, was in honor of his friend and mentor David Balme (University of London), and after Balme's death in 1989, Gotthelf shepherded several of his projects to publication. In 2004, Gotthelf's ""contributions to the study of classical philosophy and science"" were celebrated at a conference at the University of Pittsburgh, which led to the volume: Being, Nature, and Life in Aristotle: Essays in Honor of Allan Gotthelf (Cambridge University Press, 2010), edited by Lennox and Robert Bolton (Rutgers University). Gotthelf met Ayn Rand in 1962, in connection with lectures on her philosophy that he attended. Rand took an active interest in philosophy students, and over the next 15 years, he had the opportunity for long philosophical discussions with her. Gotthelf is one of two friends whose expressions of interest Rand said prompted her to write Introduction to Objectivist Epistemology, which has become one of history's best-selling works on epistemology. Gotthelf was an active participant in Rand's famous 1969-71 Workshops on that book, an edited transcript of which now appears as an appendix to the book's second edition (Plume, 1990). Gotthelf was a founding member of the Ayn Rand Society, a group affiliated with the American Philosophical Association, and he held the Society's highest office from 1990 until his death. Since April of 2013, he has shared that office with Gregory Salmieri (Boston University), his former student and frequent collaborator. Gotthelf co-edited (with Lennox), and contributed essays to, the first two volumes of the Society's ongoing Philosophical Studies series, published by the University of Pittsburgh Press. He is the author of On Ayn Rand (Wadsworth, 2000), and is co-editor (with Salmieri) of Ayn Rand: A Companion to Her Works and Thought (Wiley-Blackwell, forthcoming). He is survived by Ronald and Cassandra Love and their sons Zach and Ian Barber--whom Allan regarded as his family--by his many friends and students, and by his sister, Joan Gotthelf Price."

2013-09-08T00:00:00Z,"MAYER--Lloyd F.,MD -- It is with profound sadness that we at The Mount Sinai Medical Center mark the passing of our cherished friend and outstanding colleague, Lloyd F. Mayer, MD. Dr. Mayer graduated from the Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai in 1976 and received the Mosby Award for Clinical Excellence at that time. It was one of many awards he would receive for a lifetime of outstanding work, including the Saul Horowitz Award and the Irma T. Hirschl Trust Career Development Award, the Jeffrey Modell Foundation Lifetime Achievement Award, the Jaffe Food Allergy Institute Award for Scientific Excellence, and the Crohn's and Colitis Foundation of America (CCFA) Scientific Achievement Award. Dr. Mayer's interdisciplinary and internationally renowned laboratory focused on mucosal immunoregulation, inflammatory bowel diseases, and cytokine regulation of human B-cell differentiation. He and his team were the first to show that the epithelial lining cells of the intestine are active regulators of mucosal immune responses that are distinct from those that regulate systemic immunity. These findings had a profound significance in the development of highly effective anti-inflammatory drugs for IBD. Dr. Mayer, with support from The Leona M. and Harry B. Helmsley Charitable Trust, launched the IBD Center at Mount Sinai as well as established a national network of academic medical institutions for collaborative basic research in IBD. From 1980 through 1984, Dr. Mayer held joint appointments at Rockefeller University and Mount Sinai. In 1986, he was named the Chief of the Division of Clinical Immunology at Mount Sinai, and in 1990 he became Vice Chair of Medicine. Dr. Mayer was named the David and Dorothy Merksamer Professor of Medicine in 1994, and three years later, he became Professor of Immunobiology and Chair of the Immunobiology Center. He served as Chief of the Division of Gastroenterology from 2003 to 2010, and in 2007 he became Professor and Co-Director of the Immunology Institute. From 2008-2012, Dr. Mayer was also Chairman of the National Scientific Advisory Committee of the CCFA. Dr. Mayer spoke and published widely, and his research was consistently funded by the National Institutes of Health. He also leaves behind multiple generations of physicians who trained with and were mentored by him. We at Mount Sinai, and the scientific community at large, feel a tremendous loss at his death. We extend our deepest condolences to his wife, Dr. Jill Fishbane-Mayer, their three children, Sara, Marisa and Josh, as well as Dr. Mayer's extended family and friends. Peter W. May, Chairman, Boards of Trustees, The Mount Sinai Medical Center; Kenneth L. Davis, MD, President and CEO, The Mount Sinai Medical Center; and Dennis S.

He was working on his third book and practicing law as the founding partner of Lifflander & Reich and Counsel to Dentons, up until his last days. The patriarch of the Lifflander family, Matt was preparing to marry for the third time. His main passions in life beyond his family were cigars, coffee, military and police hats, memorabilia from the 1939 World's Fair, pens, and politics. Born in New York City to Ben and May Lifflander in 1932, he grew up in Jackson Heights, Queens. He received an undergraduate degree from NYU and a law degree from Cornell University. Matt's first job was on the staff of Governor Averell Harriman, and included the task of manning the phone on the night of prisoner executions. He later became a vice president and chief international counsel at Hertz. After he struck out on his own, the car rental giant remained a client. Matt gained many other long term clients, including Liberty Lines bus company, Zurich American Group insurance and Ralph Lauren Footwear. Matthew served as CEO of Uniworld, an international master franchisor of Orange Julius hamburger shops. He worked tirelessly for the Democratic Party for his entire life. Matt was chairman of the unsuccessful New York State gubernatorial bids of Howard Samuels in the early 1970s.

The Impeachment of Governor Sulzer, A Story of American Politics, tells the story of New York Governor William Sulzer, a popular congressman, who took office in January 1913 and was the only governor of the state ever impeached. He was removed from office in October of that year because he defied the all-powerful Tammany Hall machine. Matt's Op Ed pieces and articles have appeared in the New York Times, The Wall Street Journal, The Albany Times-Union, the New York Daily News, the New York Law Journal, the New York Sun, New York Archives Magazine, and The Journal of Privatization.

As a young man he experienced acutely the economic privation of the Great Depression and emerged from that experience with a strong commitment to community and to social and economic justice. Deeply engaged in civic life, he served as Chair of the Mt. Vernon Zoning Board of Appeals, and was Associate Judge and then City Court Judge for the City of Mt. Vernon from 1978 through 1985. He served as President of the Emanuel Jewish Center, President of the Mt. Vernon Jewish Community Council, President of the Westchester Day School, President of the Westchester Jewish Conference, President of the Mt.

He served his clients with wisdom, gentleness and affability. And he extended similar respect to all who came before him on the bench as he presided with the gravity appropriate to the circumstances leavened, at lighter moments, by a twinkle of humor. Predeceased by his wife Anne, he leaves his children Arthur, Carol and Deborah; their spouses Susan, Richard and Joel; grandchildren Adam, Evan, Ethan, Dani and Ari; great-grand children, Harry and Annabel; and many happy memories of family dinners, holidays and trips.

2013-09-10T00:00:00Z,"ANGEL--Rita (nee Altchek), September 18, 1938, passed away September 9, 2013. My wife Rita was the youngest child of Solomon and Blanche Altchek. Thus the origin of the sobriquets ""Baby Rita"" and ""Rita Babe"" to which she answered throughout her life. She was the much loved sister of her physician brothers Albert Altchek, and Martin Altchek. The adored, beloved, beatified mother and mother-in-law of Nicole Wachter, and her husband David; Spencer Angel and his wife Alexis. The doting grandmother of Michael and Matthew Wachter, and Sophia and Joshua Angel. For 52 years, no matter how gloomy the immediate circumstances she brought a smile to my heart, and taught me to appreciate life. She was my most trusted, and wisest business partner, my best friend, and the constant and eternal love of my life. Our families had similar European origination backgrounds, and were friends. We however, were not, and our initial meeting was by chance, and totally serendipitous. That meeting resulting in my immediate falling madly in love with Hunter College's most beautiful and luminous graduate of any year. Rita was not similarly smitten, and over the next two years she skillfully evaded my successive proposals of marriage. Her hesitation in the marriage department probably emanated from my combined lack of dance skills, mediocre career prospects, and general boorishness. I suspect that her reluctance to say yes was overcome only after her father, clearly tired of my mooning around, ordained that she had wasted enough time on me, and should either move on, or marry the dope. In those years women listened to their fathers, and thus we married on July 4, 1963. Over the next 50 years we were extremely fortunate in raising two exceptional and wonderful children as we prospered, and enjoyed a storybook family life and marriage. My only regret in that regard being the present certainty of no more storybook years to come. She was the kindest and most caring person I have ever known. Totally devoid of any kind of malice or guile Rita throughout her life was uniquely possessed of an infectious schoolgirl naivety, and charm. Blessed with an artless, ingenuous, and eternally youthful persona she was amazingly intelligent, caring, selfless, and the most beautiful person imaginable. Rita's single most endearing quality was her ability to transmit her unique flair for life to all who knew her. Destined to expire on the floor of a Manhattan disco, or the slopes of Saint Moritz, Rita was instead fickle fated by a return visit from cancer two years ago. The disease, which she had vanquished over thirty years ago, returned this time in diabolic form, and was ultimately lethal. Despite heroic effort of dedicated teams of Mount Sinai Hospital associates, Zoya her home care provider, the overall extraordinary loving supervision of our daughter Nicole, and Rita's natural combativeness, it was the disease, rather than the defenders who dictated the story's end. For Rita and Josh all that now remains is in the words of a World War II song - ""I'll never smile again until I smile at you."" Our Jewish mythology has man and woman as a single soul, separated at birth, rejoined in marriage and ultimately re-united in death. Who knows, and if perchance there is a remelding of souls to be had in a life after life, so to speak, then I'm all for it. Goodbye my love, and thank you for having given my life its substance and meaning.

Born in small-town Wisconsin, higher educated at the UW-Madison and UC-Davis, she arrived in New York City in 1972 and never left.

For 60 years she compiled records on top producers and show dogs among Cocker Spaniels, her favorite breed. The American Spaniel Club inducted her into its Hall of Fame in 2011.

2013-09-11T00:00:00Z,"ANGEL--Rita (nee Altchek), September 18, 1938, passed away September 9, 2013. My wife Rita was the youngest child of Solomon and Blanche Altchek. Thus the origin of the sobriquets ""Baby Rita"" and ""Rita Babe"" to which she answered throughout her life. She was the much loved sister of her physician brothers Albert Altchek, and Martin Altchek. The adored, beloved, beatified mother and mother-in-law of Nicole Wachter, and her husband David; Spencer Angel and his wife Alexis. The doting grandmother of Michael and Matthew Wachter, and Sophia and Joshua Angel. For 52 years, no matter how gloomy the immediate circumstances she brought a smile to my heart, and taught me to appreciate life. She was my most trusted, and wisest business partner, my best friend, and the constant and eternal love of my life. Our families had similar European origination backgrounds, and were friends. We however, were not, and our initial meeting was by chance, and totally serendipitous. That meeting resulting in my immediate falling madly in love with Hunter College's most beautiful and luminous graduate of any year. Rita was not similarly smitten, and over the next two years she skillfully evaded my successive proposals of marriage. Her hesitation in the marriage department probably emanated from my combined lack of dance skills, mediocre career prospects, and general boorishness. I suspect that her reluctance to say yes was overcome only after her father, clearly tired of my mooning around, ordained that she had wasted enough time on me, and should either move on, or marry the dope. In those years women listened to their fathers, and thus we married on July 4, 1963. Over the next 50 years we were extremely fortunate in raising two exceptional and wonderful children as we prospered, and enjoyed a storybook family life and marriage. My only regret in that regard being the present certainty of no more storybook years to come. She was the kindest and most caring person I have ever known. Totally devoid of any kind of malice or guile Rita throughout her life was uniquely possessed of an infectious schoolgirl naivety, and charm. Blessed with an artless, ingenuous, and eternally youthful persona she was amazingly intelligent, caring, selfless, and the most beautiful person imaginable. Rita's single most endearing quality was her ability to transmit her unique flair for life to all who knew her. Destined to expire on the floor of a Manhattan disco, or the slopes of Saint Moritz, Rita was instead fickle fated by a return visit from cancer two years ago. The disease, which she had vanquished over thirty years ago, returned this time in diabolic form, and was ultimately lethal. Despite heroic effort of dedicated teams of Mount Sinai Hospital associates, Zoya her home care provider, the overall extraordinary loving supervision of our daughter Nicole, and Rita's natural combativeness, it was the disease, rather than the defenders who dictated the story's end. For Rita and Josh all that now remains is in the words of a World War II song - ""I'll never smile again until I smile at you."" Our Jewish mythology has man and woman as a single soul, separated at birth, rejoined in marriage and ultimately re-united in death. Who knows, and if perchance there is a remelding of souls to be had in a life after life, so to speak, then I'm all for it. Goodbye my love, and thank you for having given my life its substance and meaning.

2013-09-15T00:00:00Z,"WHALEN--Joseph P.,M.D., 80, of New York City, died in Syracuse, New York on September 3rd after a brief illness. A native of Troy, New York, Dr. Whalen was born on June 18, 1933 to the late Philip J. Whalen and Mary Doyle Whalen. A graduate of Catholic schools in Troy, he received his A.B. degree from Fordham University in 1955 and his M.D. degree from the State University of New York at Syracuse in 1959. After a year of internship in internal medicine followed by three years of residency in radiology at the State University of New York at Syracuse, Dr. Whalen began a career as a radiologist that would last for decades and eventually carry him to the heights of his profession. Passionately committed to education as well as to medicine, Dr. Whalen combined an academic life with that of a practicing physician, accepting a position as instructor in Radiology at Albany Medical College and then at the State University of New York at Syracuse in the mid-1960s. In 1968 he was invited to become Associate Attending Radiologist at the New York Hospital (presently the New York Presbyterian Hospital-Weill Cornell Medical Center) in New York City. Within three years he was named Attending Radiologist, and in 1976 he became Radiologist-in-Chief, a position he held until 1992. From 1989 until 1992 he was the Medical Director of the same institution. For sixteen years he served as Professor and Chairman of the Department of Radiology at the Weill-Cornell Medical College, educating many of the most prominent radiologists in practice today. During his time at the New York Hospital, Dr. Whalen was responsible for bringing the first CT scanner to New York City. Always in the vanguard of his profession, he pioneered the use of the first MRI in a New York Hospital, as well as the first Electron Beam CT Scanner. In 1992 Dr. Whalen left the New York Hospital to accept the position of Dean of the College of Medicine and Vice President of Biomedical and Medical Education at the State University of New York Health Science Center in Syracuse, New York, remaining there until 1995. A sought-after educator, Dr. Whalen held numerous visiting professorships, including: the Medical School of the University of Dublin, Ireland; the Postgraduate School of Medicine, Hammersmith Hospital, London; The Pathology Department of the School of Medicine at Cornell University, Ithaca, New York; and the School of Veterinary Medicine at Cornell University, Ithaca, New York. At the time of his death he was a fellow of the Royal College of Surgeons, Ireland; the New York Academy of Medicine; the American College of Radiology; and the Royal Society of Medicine. Dr. Whalen, who was awarded a D. Sc. degree by the State University of New York at Syracuse in 1989, was an active member of numerous professional societies, including the Radiological Society of North America, the American College of Radiology, the New York Roentgen Ray Society, and the Harvey Society. A founding member of the International Skeletal Society and the Society of Gastrointestinal Radiologists, he was an honorary member of radiologic societies throughout the United States and Canada. He was also a board examiner for the American College of Radiology. Although ardently committed to the field of radiology, Dr. Whalen was a man whose interests were too broad to be confined to one area of specialty. His research into the role of calcium in health and disease has had an impact on the treatment of medical conditions as diverse as osteoporosis and periodontal disease. A prolific writer as well as a meticulous researcher, Dr. Whalen was the author or co-author of over two hundred peer-reviewed scientific articles as well as four medical textbooks. Until his death, he was the editor-in-chief of Clinical Imaging, a journal of radiology. In his retirement Dr. Whalen devoted much of his time to his family and to charitable endeavors, especially serving as President of the John, Marie, and Joseph Whalen Foundation and the Mons Concepit Foundation. In recent years he divided his time between his homes in New York City, Shelter Island, and Mannin Beg, County Galway, Ireland -- a place he deeply loved. Intensely proud of his Irish heritage, Dr. Whalen was always eager to do whatever he could to help the land from which his forebears had emigrated. At the time of his death he was in the process of establishing a scholarship program for underprivileged and deserving Irish students, which he had intended to name in honor of his beloved sister Marie. Dr. Whalen is survived by his wife Elizabeth Varga Whalen, as well as three children, Philip J. Whalen (Frances) of Briarcliff Manor, New York, Joseph P. Whalen, Jr. (Mary) of Oceanport, New Jersey, and Mary P. Whalen of New York City, as well as six grandchildren: Casey (fiance, Cyril Galvin), Ryan (Amy), Timmy, Devin, Lindsey Marie, and Jenna Frances Whalen. He is survived, as well, by a stepson, Charles Bouchard (Teresa), of Schenectady, New York, three step-grandchildren: Charlie, Julianne, and Caroline Bouchard, also of Schenectady, and his ""grand-dog"" Eddie Doyle of New York City. Dr. Whalen was preceded in death by two older siblings, the Reverend John P. Whalen and Marie T. Whalen. A Mass of Christian Burial was celebrated in the chapel of the Provincial House of the Sisters of Saint Joseph of Carondelet in Latham, New York on Saturday, September 7, 2013. Interment was at Oakwood Cemetery in Troy, New York. Donations in Dr. Whalen's memory may be made to the John, Marie, and Joseph Whalen Foundation in care of Sister Serena Thompson, CSJ, 385 Watervliet-Shaker Road, Latham, New York 12110-4799. Details of a memorial service in New York City are pending."

2013-09-15T00:00:00Z,"MARCUS--Dr. Philip I.,of Storrs, CT, passed away on Sunday, September 1, 2013 at the age of eighty-six. He spent the past forty-four years on the faculty at UConn, known to many as a compassionate professor who donated his time unselfishly to colleagues and students. He was born June 3, 1927 in Springfield, MA; the son of Julius Marcus and Marley Spier (Sheffield, England), and the brother of Maxine Altshuler, and Emil Marcus, who all predeceased him. In 1945 he graduated Springfield Technical High School, the STEM system of its time. During WWII, while in high school, he worked at the great forges in the Springfield Armory immortalized by Longfellow's poem ""The Arsenal at Springfield."" He enlisted in the Army Specialized Training Reserve Program and was assigned in 1945 to attend UConn in Storrs, CT. After six months each at UConn and UMaine (in Orono) he had earned two years of college credit. Assigned to active duty in the US Air Force and stationed in Istres, France, he rose to the level of staff sergeant within a year. The GI Bill enabled him to attend college, the first in his family to do so. He received degrees from the: University of Southern California (B.S. in Bacteriology, 1950); University of Chicago (M.S. in Microbiology, 1953); and University of Colorado Medical Center (Ph.D. in Microbiology/ Biophysics, 1957). While at the University of Chicago, he worked with Aaron Novick and Leo Szilard and later with Paul Talalay. In Colorado, he became codiscoverer of the clonogenic assay and the feeder cell system, making it possible to grow clones from single mammalian cells as in stem cells. He was the first to clone the immortalized HeLa cells. That procedure led to the first determination of human cell sensitivity to X-rays. Over fifty years later he documented at a luncheon conversation with Leo Szilard, the nuclear physicist, led to the concept and physical setup for the first clonogenic assay. Dr. Marcus then spent nine years on the faculty of the Albert Einstein College of Medicine in New York supported by a ten-year U.S. Public Health Service Research Career Development Award. While there he showed the dynamic movement of virus molecules on the surface of infected cells, and with a pediatrician colleague, Dr. David Carver, developed a new test to detect rubella virus. During this time in New York, he was Director for nine years of the post-doctoral Course on Quantitative Animal Virology and Cell Culture that was taught in the summer at Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory (New York). In 1969 Dr. Marcus returned to UConn where he was appointed Head of the then Microbiology Section. He spent the remainder of his career at UConn where he administered the first Program Project on campus supported by the National Institute of Health, chaired the first Biosafety Committee, created a Virus and Interferon Research Laboratory recognized internationally for its innovative studies, published over 130 scientific papers, and was awarded five U.S. patents. As an early director of the Biotechnology Center, he helped attract companies with a focus on biotechnology to Connecticut. Then, for twelve years as director of the Biotechnology/ Services Center, he expanded the acquisition of state-of-the art instruments, which drew scientists to the facility. He continued to advance biotechnology in Connecticut as a charter member of the Connecticut Academy of Science and Engineering and was pleased to know that the Research Park planned for Storrs, CT, will be realized. In 1987 he received the UConn Alumni Association Award for Excellence in Research, and in 2003 was recognized as a Board of Trustees Distinguished Professor. His annual course in Virology, taught for thirty-six years, was both sought after, and evaded, the former by students looking to be challenged. These students were a source of great pride. Decades later he continued to receive accolades from students expressing appreciation for the opportunity. Dr. Marcus was a member and active participant in a number of professional scientific societies including the American Society for Virology and the International Society for Interferon and Cytokine Research, which in 2005 named him as an Honorary Member. Serving eighteen years as Editor-in-Chief of the Journal of Interferon Research (later renamed the Journal of Interferon and Cytokine Research (JICR)), he went on to serve as Senior Consulting Editor of the JICR for ten years until the present day. For twenty-five years he was an Editor for the Journal of Cellular Physiology. He typically mentored two Ph.D. candidates and two undergraduate honors students doing research in the lab. The bulk of his research at UConn was in collaboration with long-time associate and faculty member, Dr. Margaret J. Sekellick. Three highlights included: the discovery of the world's most efficient inducer of interferon a single molecule of double-stranded RNA; the molecular cloning of the first non-human interferon (avian); and the discovery that influenza virus populations contained previously unknown large subpopulations of noninfectious viruses that were nonetheless biologically active. He was an avid reader who, while developing ways to win the war between viruses and cells, imagined how humankind would lose if we destroyed ourselves first. He showed palatable disdain for politicians who did not appreciate the role of basic science in understanding and caring for the world and its many inhabitants. He is survived by Angela, his wife of 60 years; his son Craig F. Marcus (Coventry, CT); daughter Wendy Marcus Gogel and her husband Gary Gogel (Brighton, MA); daughter Valerie Marcus Nassiff and her daughters Madison and Sydney (Bolton, CT); cousin Bernard A. Marcus and family (Webster, NY); niece Bari Edlin and family (Sherman Oaks, CA); niece Susan Avisar and her husband Eytan and family (Sherman Oaks, CA); and niece Jacqueline Marcus (Los Osos, CA).

Please make checks payable to: The UConn Foundation, Inc. at the following address: 2390 Alumni Drive Unit 3206, Storrs, CT 06269.

We mourn the tragic loss of Leon, who over the last 30 years, quickly grew from being ""our Professor of French"" into an adored and cherished member of our family. Soon, his beloved wife and soulmate, Sheila, and the daughters on whom he doted; Deborah and Anne; her husband David, and their children, Lindsey Rachel, and Max all became family. They were the planets that revolved around this delightful man's special world. Leon was a wealth of information, a brilliant scholar whose depth of knowledge spanned the world of languages, music of every kind, opera, haute cuisine --the best of everything, including, where to get the best cappuccino in town. Who will I call from Tel Aviv to find out where to get the best falafel? Who will I phone from Paris to make sure that my wording is the ""most chic""? And who will call me to say where our next lesson will be, (they were frequently conducted in 3-star restaurants, naturellment!) Who else could I be with, conjugating verbs and munching on amuse bouches, at Le Cirque or Daniel, only to have our lesson interrupted by Sirio or Daniel themselves, the celebrated restaurateurs, who always stopped by to exchange pleasantries with The Professor?? I will never forget our hilarious and heartwarming taxi rides around NYC. Leon, leaning forward to determine the driver's native tongue, and a split second later, regaling the driver with wondrous words that not only amazed him but convinced him that he was in the company of a fellow countryman! Leon wove his special magic both in song and in fluent French, Arabic, Yiddish, Italian.and conversed in Ordu, Indian dialects, Pakistani, Greek and Creole masterfully enough to send listeners into gales of laughter, the most universal language of all. Leon, you will be missed by so many. There will never be anyone as charming and playful as you. Only a truly gifted teacher such as you could share his wisdom and knowledge with so many spanning all ages, in a breadth of settings with so much success and joy. From Brearley to the Boardroom, you enchanted and left your unforgettable imprint. We will all miss you so very much. Our hearts and thoughts are with Sheila, Deborah, Anne, David and their children. Love, Catherine, Fred, Christopher, Freddie P.S. I hope that in heaven you will have an unending supply of Le Petit Ecolier, in dark chocolate of course!"

2013-09-22T00:00:00Z,"TELEKI--Arved, passed away on September 18, 2013, in Houston, Texas. Son of the late Count Arved Teleki and Countess Suzanne Kovacs Teleki, Arved was born in Cluj, Romania (formerly Kolozsvar, Hungary) on June 6, 1929. His was a true American immigrant story. At the age of fifteen, he escaped certain oppression under communism, leaving on foot, in the midst of war, with only a suitcase. He emigrated to Switzerland and then the United States, where he built a new life in New York and then Houston. He was always grateful for the opportunity he found in his adopted homeland, and his larger-than-life personality made him a natural Texan. Arved married Ruth Shipley MacMahon in 1966, and together they raised four daughters. The family's best memories are of the adventures he led in the tradition of his Transylvanian upbringing, especially hikes in the mountains of Big Bend and long sunrise walks on the beach. A noted economist and advisor in the oil and gas industry, Arved began his career at Union Carbide. In 1967, he founded Hydrocarbon Consultants, Inc., which he led for 35 years. He was then Chief Economist at Chemical Market Associates, Inc., until, at the age of 82, he ""took early retirement."" He was educated at the Rosenberg Academy in Switzerland, Heidelberg College in Ohio, and Harvard College, from which he graduated in 1953. Arved was dedicated to his family and was a mentor to many. He is remembered for his contagious passion for and encyclopedic knowledge of history, politics, and world affairs; his eloquence, integrity, and work ethic; his spiritual connection to the outdoors, his lifelong support of Hungarian causes; and above all, his love for life. He is survived by Ruth, his wife of 47 years; his four daughters: Adrienne of Brooklyn, NY; Stephanie of Piedmont, CA; Alix and Katharine of Austin, TX; their families, including five grandchildren; and his brother Deneb of Rio Rancho, NM. In lieu of flowers, the family encourages support of Hungarian education in Transylvania, a cause that was dear to him. Donations can be made in his name to the Calvin Synod School Fund, P.O.

2013-09-22T00:00:00Z,"SACHS--Leon September 17, 2013. Professor Sachs De La Sorbonne! I can see you now, emphasizing in your inimitable way, the correct way to pronounce ""La Sorbonne""! We mourn the tragic loss of Leon, who over the last 30 years, quickly grew from being ""our Professor of French"" into an adored and cherished member of our family. Soon, his beloved wife and soulmate, Sheila, and the daughters on whom he doted; Deborah and Anne; her husband David, and their children, Lindsey Rachel, and Max all became family. They were the planets that revolved around this delightful man's special world. Leon was a wealth of information, a brilliant scholar whose depth of knowledge spanned the world of languages, music of every kind, opera, haute cuisine --the best of everything, including, where to get the best cappuccino in town. Who will I call from Tel Aviv to find out where to get the best falafel? Who will I phone from Paris to make sure that my wording is the ""most chic""? And who will call me to say where our next lesson will be, (they were frequently conducted in 3-star restaurants, naturellment!) Who else could I be with, conjugating verbs and munching on amuse bouches, at Le Cirque or Daniel, only to have our lesson interrupted by Sirio or Daniel themselves, the celebrated restaurateurs, who always stopped by to exchange pleasantries with The Professor?? I will never forget our hilarious and heartwarming taxi rides around NYC. Leon, leaning forward to determine the driver's native tongue, and a split second later, regaling the driver with wondrous words that not only amazed him but convinced him that he was in the company of a fellow countryman! Leon wove his special magic both in song and in fluent French, Arabic, Yiddish, Italian.and conversed in Ordu, Indian dialects, Pakistani, Greek and Creole masterfully enough to send listeners into gales of laughter, the most universal language of all. Leon, you will be missed by so many. There will never be anyone as charming and playful as you. Only a truly gifted teacher such as you could share his wisdom and knowledge with so many spanning all ages, in a breadth of settings with so much success and joy. From Brearley to the Boardroom, you enchanted and left your unforgettable imprint. We will all miss you so very much. Our hearts and thoughts are with Sheila, Deborah, Anne, David and their children. Love, Catherine, Fred, Christopher, Freddie P.S. I hope that in heaven you will have an unending supply of Le Petit Ecolier, in dark chocolate of course!"

2013-09-22T00:00:00Z,"MARCUS--Dr. Philip I.,of Storrs, CT, passed away on Sunday, September 1, 2013 at the age of 86. He spent the past 44 years on the faculty at UConn, known to many as a compassionate professor who donated his time unselfishly to colleagues and students. He was born June 3, 1927 in Springfield, MA; the son of Julius Marcus and Marley Spier (Sheffield, England), and the brother of Maxine Altshuler, and Emil Marcus, who all predeceased him. In 1945 he graduated Springfield Technical High School, the STEM system of its time. During WWII, while in high school, he worked at the great forges in the Springfield Armory immortalized by Longfellow's poem ""The Arsenal at Springfield."" He enlisted in the Army Specialized Training Reserve Program and was assigned in 1945 to attend UConn in Storrs, CT. After six months each at UConn and UMaine (in Orono) he had earned two years of college credit. Assigned to active duty in the US Air Force and stationed in Istres, France, he rose to the level of staff sergeant within a year. The GI Bill enabled him to attend college, the first in his family to do so. He received degrees from the: Univ. of Southern California (B.S. in Bacteriology, 1950); Univ. of Chicago (M.S. in Microbiology, 1953); and Univ. of Colorado Medical Center (Ph.D. in Microbiology/ Biophysics, 1957). While at the Univ. of Chicago, he worked with Aaron Novick and Leo Szilard and later with Paul Talalay. In Colorado, he became codiscoverer of the clonogenic assay and the feeder cell system, making it possible to grow clones from single mammalian cells as in stem cells. He was the first to clone the immortalized HeLa cells. That procedure led to the first determination of human cell sensitivity to X-rays. Over 50 years later he documented at a luncheon conversation with Leo Szilard, the nuclear physicist, led to the concept and physical setup for the first clonogenic assay. Dr. Marcus then spent nine years on the faculty of the Albert Einstein College of Medicine in NY supported by a ten-year U.S. Public Health Service Research Career Development Award. While there he showed the dynamic movement of virus molecules on the surface of infected cells, and with a pediatrician colleague, Dr. David Carver, developed a new test to detect rubella virus. During this time in New York, he was Director for nine years of the post-doctoral Course on Quantitative Animal Virology and Cell Culture that was taught in the summer at Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory (NY). In 1969 Dr. Marcus returned to UConn where he was appointed Head of the then Microbiology Section. He spent the remainder of his career at UConn where he administered the first Program Project on campus supported by the National Institute of Health, chaired the first Biosafety Committee, created a Virus and Interferon Research Laboratory recognized internationally for its innovative studies, published over 130 scientific papers, and was awarded 5 U.S. patents. As an early director of the Biotechnology Center, he helped attract companies with a focus on biotechnology to Connecticut. Then, for 12 years as director of the Biotechnology/ Services Center, he expanded the acquisition of state-of-the art instruments, which drew scientists to the facility. He continued to advance biotechnology in Connecticut as a charter member of the Connecticut Academy of Science and Engineering and was pleased to know that the Research Park planned for Storrs, CT, will be realized. In 1987 he received the UConn Alumni Association Award for Excellence in Research, and in 2003 was recognized as a Board of Trustees Distinguished Professor. His annual course in Virology, taught for 36 years, was both sought after, and evaded, the former by students looking to be challenged. These students were a source of great pride. Decades later he continued to receive accolades from students expressing appreciation for the opportunity. Dr. Marcus was a member and active participant in a number of professional scientific societies including the American Society for Virology and the International Society for Interferon and Cytokine Research, which in 2005 named him as an Honorary Member. Serving eighteen years as Editor-in-Chief of the Journal of Interferon Research (later renamed the Journal of Interferon and Cytokine Research (JICR)), he went on to serve as Senior Consulting Editor of the JICR for ten years until the present day. For twenty-five years he was an Editor for the Journal of Cellular Physiology. He typically mentored two Ph.D. candidates and two undergraduate honors students doing research in the lab. The bulk of his research at UConn was in collaboration with long-time associate and faculty member, Dr. Margaret J. Sekellick. Three highlights included: the discovery of the world's most efficient inducer of interferon a single molecule of double-stranded RNA; the molecular cloning of the first non-human interferon (avian); and the discovery that influenza virus populations contained previously unknown large subpopulations of noninfectious viruses that were nonetheless biologically active. He was an avid reader who, while developing ways to win the war between viruses and cells, imagined how humankind would lose if we destroyed ourselves first. He showed palatable disdain for politicians who did not appreciate the role of basic science in understanding and caring for the world and its many inhabitants. He is survived by Angela, his wife of 60 years; his son Craig F. Marcus (Coventry, CT); daughter Wendy Marcus Gogel and her husband Gary Gogel (Brighton, MA); daughter Valerie Marcus Nassiff and her daughters Madison and Sydney (Bolton, CT); cousin Bernard A. Marcus and family (Webster, NY); niece Bari Edlin and family (Sherman Oaks, CA); niece Susan Avisar and her husband Eytan and family (Sherman Oaks, CA); and niece Jacqueline Marcus (Los Osos, CA). Donations in memory of Dr. Philip I. Marcus may be made to The Philip I. Marcus Graduate Student Virology Support Fund. Please make checks payable to: The UConn Foundation, Inc., 2390 Alumni Drive Unit 3206, Storrs, CT 06269. A memorial service to be held at the University of Connecticut is being planned to honor his passion for education, scholarship, research and creativity."

2013-09-22T00:00:00Z,"DaCOSTA--Jacqueline, 86, former advertising executive Jacqueline DaCosta passed away on Monday, April 29th at her home in New York City. The cause of death was not given though she had been in failing health for the past two years. Ms. DaCosta had served as vice president of media from 1967 to 1986 at Ted Bates Advertising which was sold in 1986 to the London based marketing firm of Saatchi & Saatchi. She had spent most of her 40 year career in advertising at the Bates company after graduating from Hunter College where she majored in business administration and languages. Jackie, as her wide circle of friends called her, was deeply involved in civic, cultural, and humanitarian affairs. These endeavors included being president of Hamilton Madison House, a social services agency on the lower east side of New York, and vice president of the Puerto Rican Family Institute. Jacqueline DaCosta was born in Manhattan on January 21, 1927, the daughter of Joaquin and Tirsa DaCosta. As a child she attended Catholic school in addition to New York's well known Music and Art High School. During her tenure at Bates, Jackie pioneered and orchestrated a new system for fairer TV buying rates during the month-long sweeps of each quarter during the year. With her newfound influence, Jackie often appeared on TV talk shows and took part in countless seminars, many of which she chaired. The awards came as well. She was named New York's Advertising Woman of the Year in 1974, and the City's Puerto Rican Woman of the Year in 1982. Jackie was also an avid theater, concert, and opera-goer, with her own seat at the Shed at Tanglewood besides being a supporting member of the Opera de Puerto Rico. Yet, throughout it all, her greatest satisfaction came from friend and family get-togethers. It was Jackie's deep rooted commitment to her faith, family, and friends that prompted countless celebratory gatherings at her homes in New York and Puerto Rico. ""She had this never ending sense of generosity and desire to help others,"" a family member noted."

Born in Brooklyn, NY on June 14, 1913 and schooled in Brooklyn at the Adelphi Academy, she graduated from Smith College in 1933 and earned her Master's in Social Work in 1935 from the Smith College School for Social Work. She worked at the Jewish Board of Guardians (JBG) where, in 1942, she job-shared her work on delinquency and family problems, and also represented the New York Jewish agencies in the court system. After leaving the JBG, she worked for the Child Adoption Committee. Later, she focused on career counseling, psychotherapy, and then geriatric services. She was appointed to boards that looked at the needs of elders throughout Massachusetts, including one at the University of Massachusetts Medical School. She served on the first board of the Franklin County Home Care for 25 years and represented her community during this time. In addition, she was appointed by the Governor of Massachusetts to be one of six national Ombudsman on the Board of Registration of Nursing Home Administrators, a position she held for a number of years. She married Solomon Barkin in 1940, a prominent labor economist, and enjoyed his companionship for almost 60 years. The family lived in Manhattan, Great Neck, NY, and Paris, France, where her husband was in the diplomatic corps assigned to the Organization of Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD). The family returned to live in Leverett, MA where her husband had a tenured professorship in the Economics Department at the University of Massachusetts, Amherst. Survivors include her three children, David, Roger, and Amy and three grandsons, Adam, Michael and Benjamin, two great-grandsons, Jacob and Eli, and a large circle of friends. Elaine was a feisty, dedicated, socially active and colorful woman who remained mentally alert until her death. She had a life-long love of learning and appetite for life. Up until her last days she took courses in the local Five College 'Learning in Retirement' program. She was a lover of opera, music, theatre, bridge, gourmet cooking, reading and travel. She will be remembered as a deeply loving mother, a generous and devoted friend and confidant, a 'bon vivant', an extraordinary listener and advisor to the young (and not so young), a hostess, an eternal optimist, a 'raconteuse extraordinaire', and a role model for graceful aging! She was a kind and selfless person, beloved by all she met. She brightened the lives of those she touched and left footprints on our hearts, and we will never be the same. In lieu of flowers, memorial contributions may be made to: The Franklin County Home Care Corporation, Roseann Martoccia, Executive Director, 330 Montague City Road, Suite 1, Turners Falls, MA 01376. www.fchcc.org, 413-773-5555.

2013-09-24T00:00:00Z,"TENNEY--Charles. Charles Thomas (Tom) Tenney born October 4, 1920 died September 20, 2013 from complications of cancer at The Mayo Clinic, Ponte Vedra, Florida. Surrounded by his loving family, he passed with the strength and dignity that befit him in life. Tom was the son of Harral Straat and Helen Thomas Tenney of Greenwich, CT. He was predeceased by them along with his sisters Rebecca Agnew, Suzanne Sutter and brother, Harral Straat Tenney, Jr. Tom is survived by his wife, Eunice Edwards, also of Greenwich, CT, whom he married on November 6, 1942. They proceeded to have five children: Susan Noble (Howard), Vicki Graboys (Tom), Scott (Patricia), Tim (Carolyn) and Duncan (Virginia). He also leaves nine grandchildren; Topher Black, Jennifer Hinton, Carson Baker, Olivia Baker, Straat Tenney, Kathryn Eunice Tenney, Grace Tenney, Thomas Tenney and Elizabeth Tenney and six great grandchildren; Charlie, Scarlett, Lucia, Huckleberry, Boone and Benjamin. Tom was a long time resident of Newburgh, NY, Ponte Vedra, FL, Woodstock, VT and Fenwick, Old Saybrook, CT. Tom graduated from Greenwich Country Day, Governor Dummer Academy and while in his junior year at the University of Virginia he was called into the arena of WWII. He was a B17 pilot in the German theater during WWII and after victory in Europe he began training in the Far East before victory was declared in Asia as well. After returning from the war he went to work for the Pepsi Cola Company. Early in Pepsi's history the parent company sold franchise rights to qualified individuals throughout the United States to establish a nationwide distribution system. When the Pepsi-Cola Newburgh Bottling Company became available in 1946, he purchased it. Through hard work and perseverance he grew the Pepsi brands and re-invested in the business to make it successful. His never ending effort is what the next generation of Tenney's have as the driving force behind the thriving franchise. Most live by the adage of ""...an apple a day..."" but Tom's secret was to ""drink a Pepsi a day"". And his motto was ""when it's time to work, you work hard and when it's time to play you play hard""! His abiding passion and guiding force in his life was always his wife of almost 71 years, ""Euny"". Tom and Euny grew up together in Greenwich enjoying the thrills of athletics including many a feverish tennis match and very competitive golf games. Their union was the model that kept and grew the combined Tenney and Edwards Family. He became the patriarch of the extended tribe that celebrated every Thanksgiving together, sometimes totaling almost 100. He was passionate about the success from hard work not only in business but all endeavors. He was an avid hunter and fisherman whether it was fly fishing in the Catskill Mountains of New York or the Triton Club in Canada. And, of course, he was always devoted to his friendly German Shepherds especially his latest, Benji. Included in his many Board memberships were: Pepcom Industries, the Newburgh YMCA, Highland National Bank, Mount St. Mary's College, in Newburgh, NY, founding member and Board member of Clinton's Ditch Cooperative and Pepsi Cola Bottlers Association. As an inspiration and a role mode, his example of hard work and great love for his family will be felt for generations to come as he will be sorely missed by all. A memorial service will take place at a later date. In lieu of flowers, contributions may be made in Tom's memory, honoring his great-grandson, Charles Tenney Baker, who participates in the Pegasus Therapeutic Riding Program in Brewster, NY. Gifts can be sent to Syreeta Jones c/o Pegasus Farms, 310 Peach Lake Road, Brewster, NY 10509."

2013-09-24T00:00:00Z,"CLARK--Christine Ann, 54, died of heart failure in the early-morning hours of September 22, 2013, in Manhattan. Born in Toledo, Ohio, and raised in south Florida, Chris moved to Manhattan from Houston in the late 1980s to pursue her advertising career and be closer to her future husband, Gary Vineberg. A University of Florida Gator and Zeta Tau Alpha alumnus, she served as an account executive at several prestigious agencies, retiring from Ogilvy Health World in 2008. For more than three decades, Chris worked tirelessly on campaigns for a variety of clients, including airlines and pharmaceutical companies, becoming an expert in women's healthcare along the way. Never one to be idle, she later joined Corcoran Group, launching a second career as a real-estate salesperson. Chris was passionate about her city and Greenwich Village home, working on her building's roof garden. She could often be spotted in the Village shopping, picking up a Patsy's pizza, or sipping a frozen margarita with her husband during Sunday brunch. She and Gary traveled the globe together, counting Cambodia, Ecuador, Palau and South Africa among their many destinations. She always looked forward to her annual ""3B"" reunion trip with college roommates Jan Healy and Joanne Gelfand, a tradition that lasted 30 years. A few weeks ago, the couple, joined by Chris's mother, explored northwestern England and north Wales with local friends they had met in Fiji. Her creative side was generous, as she would shower family and friends with photo montages and videos on special occasions. She enjoyed socializing -- ""Build Me Up Buttercup"" never failed to get her up to dance -- as well as skiing and working out at the gym. Overflowing with love and good cheer, Chris was loved by so many and will be sorely missed. She is survived by her husband Gary, her mother, Catherine Clark of Dallas, her aunt Janet Mather of Denver, and her aunt Joyce Clark of San Francisco, as well as other relatives and countless friends. A service will be held in her memory at the East End Temple, 245 East 17th Street, at noon on Tuesday, September 24. In lieu of flowers, please remember Chris with donations to research and treatment of heart disease or other worthy causes."

2013-09-25T00:00:00Z,"BERMAN--James K.,of Greenwich, CT, passed away on September 22nd at the age of 89, losing a valiant two week bout with pneumonia. He was a man of many passions, not the least of which was skiing, which he did until he was 80. His greatest passion was always his wife, Peggy (Tenenbaum), to whom he was married for 62 years. He was born in New York City on May 10, 1924 to Louis and Marie Berman. He graduated from Fieldston School and earned an engineering degree from MIT in 1949. His college tenure was interrupted by World War II, when he served in the US Army Air Corps as part of the Europe weather forecasting team stationed in Greenland. He married Peggy in 1951, and they had two sons: Chris, born on his father's birthday in 1955, and Andy, born in 1957. Jim worked for four decades for Raisler Corporation, a mechanical contracting firm prominent in commercial real estate building in metropolitan New York for close to a century. He retired as Executive Vice President. He lent his expertise freely... to the Town of Rye, NY, where the family lived for a quarter century, to Fairview Country Club in Greenwich, to Congregation Emanu-El of Westchester, or later as a volunteer for IESC by advising burgeoning ventures. He loved the outdoors, most notably in Sun Valley, Idaho, where he maintained a residence in Andy's home town for the past 25 years. An avid skier, hiker, and bicyclist, Jim enjoyed both winters and summers in the Sawtooth Mountains. Earlier he and the family enjoyed similar activities around Weston, Vermont. He was an avid pilot, which he took up on a whim at age 40 and continued into his 70's. He played tennis and golf, and in his younger days was part of a sailing crew that raced regularly on the Long Island Sound. Jim especially enjoyed having season tickets for the NY Jets at Shea Stadium, where he and his young sons were ardent supporters of the football team and the AFL. Undoubtedly those days spurred Chris on to a long career at ESPN. Jim is survived by his wife Peggy, his sister Virginia Slaughter, his two sons Chris and Andy, and their wives, both named Katherine Berman. He will be greatly missed by his grandchildren Meredith, Doug, Sara, and Riley. A remembrance will be held Friday September 27th at 11am at Congregation Emanuel of Westchester in Rye, NY. In lieu of flowers, expressions of sympathy may be made to Greenwich Hospital, MIT, or the Sun Valley Ski Education Foundation.
