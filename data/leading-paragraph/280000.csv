1875-10-29T00:03:58Z,"Mr. Henry L. Clinton has served so many political factions that his power to benefit or to injure any cause has been pretty thoroughly used up. Mr. Clinton is one of the disappointed aspirants for the Kelly nomination for District Attorney, and probably feels the disappointment as keenly as he does the poor success of his efforts at defending Richard Croker, to which that disappointment is mainly due."
1875-10-29T00:03:58Z,"The yachting of the season may be fairly presumed to have been brought to a termination with the Cape May race between the Dauntless and Resolute. As a race in the proper acceptation of that term, involving doubtful issues and alternating chances, it cannot be esteemed as of much account, but as an instance of splendid sailing on the part of the winning yacht, the Dauntless, it must come within the description of phenomeual."
1875-10-29T00:03:58Z,"The interest in favor of Morrissey against John Fox for the Senatorship of the Fourth District is growing stronger. Tammany Hall is much alarmed at Morrissey's efforts, and the large number of resignations from the General committees since Morrissey opened the fight has caused great distrust of the district committees."

1875-10-30T00:03:58Z,"It was one of Corwin's campaign years, way back in the fifties, or may be in the forties, and he had been making the circuit of the State in behalf of the Whig ticket.

1875-10-30T00:03:58Z,"It remains to be seen in the campaign in this State how far the people are capable of judging as between well-grounded and ill-founded claims upon their confidence. This, after all, is the essential issue. The Democratic Party, under the lead of Gov. TILDEN, asserts that it is the reform party, and that it is only through its agency that good administration can be secured."
