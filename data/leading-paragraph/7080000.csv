You might think of them as animation, structuralist film or a variant of cameraless photography. A new exhibition at the Drawing Center, a gallery normally given over to works on paper, suggests that direct films are really drawings that speed by at 24 frames a second. In the oldest film in the exhibition, ''A Colour Box'' (1935) by Len Lye, wavy lines sway to a percussive Cuban soundtrack. Grids and checkerboards expand and contract in ''Early Abstractions No. 3: Interwoven'' (1947-49), by the midcentury mystic and folk archivist Harry Smith."

The score will be played, as originally intended, during a showing of the Dadaist film of the same name. Antheil was living in Paris (where his friends and supporters included Stravinsky, James Joyce, Satie, Dalí and Picasso) when he wrote the score to accompany the film, made by the Cubist painter Fernand Léger. It was written for 16 player pianos, xylophones, percussion and airplane propellers; the composer wrote that it was ''the first piece of music that has been composed out of and for machines, on earth.''"

Or is that just a stereotype? It's hard to know, since only the best-known companies from each country bridge the divide, so three cheers for this cutely titled minifestival, which opens Tuesday. Three companies will each spend a week at the Joyce Theater, beginning with Compagnie Heddy Maalem (above), well known in France and never seen here. Mr. Maalem is French-Algerian, and he has long been interested in Africa as a source of personal identity and creative inspiration. He brings his version of ''The Rite of Spring'' (apparently every choreographer has to have one), inspired by time spent in Lagos, Nigeria, and his dancers come from all over Africa -- all of which speaks to the diverse influences that have percolated into French dance over the last decade."

Her claim to fame was that there was never a crossword puzzle she could not complete, miss a Jeopardy or other Quiz Program, where she was quicker and more proficient with responses than the contestants. She lived to her fullest and enjoyed the closeness of her family and all her dearest friends. We will all miss her sharp mind and humor, her smile and gentle being. God rest her soul. The funeral will be at Gutterman's Funeral Home, 8000 Jericho Turnpike, Woodbury, NY 11979 at noon on Friday, June 6, 2008. (516)921-5757."

Of course, the Yankees do not operate like most of their peers, generally ignoring the bonus recommendations of the commissioner's office. So when a highly regarded high school right-hander, Gerrit Cole, fell to them with the 28th overall pick Thursday, the Yankees pounced. Their vision of Cole's 98-mile-an-hour fastball outweighed any dread of negotiating with the agent Scott Boras."

The question, provoked by the fact that according to a survey only 2 or 3 percent of the C.U. faculty identifies as Republican, is, what is the relationship between the political affiliations of a faculty member and his or her classroom performance? And the answer I gave, and would still give, is none, necessarily.I would never deny that there are some college and university teachers who mistake the classroom lectern for a political platform and thereby substitute indoctrination for instruction. But, I argue, this need not happen -- it is not an inevitable consequence either of our fallible natures or of certain subject matters -- and when it does happen, it should be labeled as wrong and regarded as a reason for discipline by the school's administration."

2008-06-08T00:00:00Z,"In the movie ''An American Crime,'' presented on Showtime, terrible things are done to the young actress Ellen Page, and as unlikely as it seems, Catherine Keener plays her tormentor. Ms. Keener portrays Gertrude Baniszewski, the laundress at the center of a true-crime story of child abuse and murder in 1960s Indiana, and she presents Gertrude as someone who sees her sadism as a right, a sword against her litany of misfortunes. The complexity of Ms. Keener's performance is in a fragility that avoids any invitation to sympathy. She plays to the power of her character's self-delusion, making it, in the end, as perverse as anything Gertrude has done."

2008-06-08T00:00:00Z,"It is a blasphemous game to home in on any single performance on ''The Wire'' and herald it as superior to some other, but Isiah Whitlock Jr.'s portrayal of Clay Davis during the show's final season got to the core of some of the series's most trenchant observations: specifically the near impossibility of battling urban corruption in the face of the flash and showmanship that keep its engines going. Testifying to a jury on charges of financial impropriety, Davis, a Maryland state senator, offers a mock-Capraesque speech about his politics of the soul, one that, heck, can't always easily accommodate traditional ideas about ethics. As he explains it, he's not pocketing anything, he's just taking from the haves so that he can give to the have-nots. Mr. Whitlock makes the speech swell with a mesmerizing, vaudevillian phoniness. Had he done nothing else of any merit in the show's previous seasons, he would have earned his Emmy then."

The film, directed by Bob Balaban, imagines the specifics of the relationship between the tobacco heiress (portrayed by Susan Sarandon) and a man named Bernard Lafferty, the Irish alcoholic she hired to oversee the polishing of the silver and serve as a paid friend after the previous gentleman who had held the position made the career-ending mistake of serving her cantaloupe too cold. Mr. Fiennes plays a repressed gay man, as awed by his good fortune as he is a slave to his debilitating habit, someone inclined to recede but desperate to assume his place. And Mr. Fiennes makes the suffering and shame apparent in every tilt of his character's head."

Mia Wasikowska, an unknown 18-year-old actress playing a gymnast sabotaging her efforts to reach the Olympics, brought to her character an exquisite balance of rage and reason. She delivered the consummate woman-child: vulnerable, primal, audacious. And she made Sophie's growth as real as her compelling sense of denial. Her chemistry with Mr. Byrne wavered not a nanosecond in its intensity, and her scenes with Peter Horton (playing her slacker father in an episode) were sublime."

Nearly every time she has appeared on television in the past few years, you have wanted her to sit tight and stay. As Martha Logan, wife of the weasely, Nixonian commander in chief during the fifth season of ''24'' (and his ex, briefly and brilliantly this past season), she gave us torment and grievance and righteous fury. As Regina Newly, mother to Christina Applegate's recovering amnesiac on the ABC comedy, ''Samantha Who?,'' she makes narcissism seem like parental entitlement and disdain a joy for whoever is looking. Regina has little use for her daughter's search for selfhood -- she regarded the coma that had caused her forgetfulness as an opportunity to pitch the family's woeful fortunes to a home-makeover show -- and Ms. Smart brings a restrained relish to every second of the insanity."

Bookstore clerks are the quiet gatekeepers of literature -- they know what you like, and they hear how you ask for it.

Do you correct customers' pronunciation? What's the strangest thing anyone has left behind? ''I hear people talking on their cellphones. They call and say, 'Hey, I'm in Housing Works Bookstore. You free for a drink?' It seems to be a place people want to call from to show that they're cool.''"

''We like to stay as focused as we can,'' he said. ''We all have personal lives that we like.'' Not that there has been much time for goofing off. Mr. Thomas likens the post-writers'-strike intensity required to crank out 9 episodes in 10 weeks to the Discovery Channel crab-fishing series ''Deadliest Catch'': ''It feels like a writers' room.

Regan and the former White House spokesman Larry Speakes) as well as a forward-looking volume by Richard Nixon. The book at No. 3 on the nonfiction list, Michael Jackson's ''Moonwalk,'' was written about here by Ken Tucker, whose review began this way: '''What can one say about Michael Jackson,' asks his editor, Jacqueline Kennedy Onassis, in her introduction to this autobiography by the world's most famous living pop star. Since Mrs. Onassis' introduction takes up all of one short paragraph, the implied answer would seem to be 'Not much,' and indeed the same question seems to have stumped the book's author, who fills pages with drab show-biz clichés and aimless anecdotes.''

2008-06-08T00:00:00Z,"''Dexter,'' the Showtime series based on the novels of Jeff Lindsay, rose to the ranks of greatness during its second season, largely by deploying the flexible muscles of Michael C. Hall. Playing the show's title hero -- a serial killer who only gets rid of the whack jobs who are more depraved than he is -- Mr. Hall took us down every byway of Dexter's accidental leap into self-actualization, embracing the character as though he loved him like some crazy, ingenious, fanatical blood relative. Confronted with the possibility of getting caught, Dexter reckons with his avocation, deciding in the end that civic serial killing really is for him. Mr. Hall made Dexter believable both as a moralist and a newfound hedonist, bringing to his attendant sexual awakening the sudden virility of a libidinous teenager. Yet still he never let us forget what a repressed guy Dexter was, while keeping his character's arsonist girlfriend always wanting more."

As Arthur Frobisher, a venal executive on the FX legal thriller, he hung up Sam Malone's jacket along with the sense that the worst characteristic we might attribute to him would be rampant womanizing. In ''Damages'' Mr. Danson summoned a whole universe of inequity, showing us that he could disregard the little people just as callously as those evildoers at Enron. He has always been a master of the smug smile and entitled gesture, but here he made his every movement predatory. In Frobisher's encounters with working people he bilked, Mr. Danson perfected a cruel style of patronizing that passes itself off as earnest ingratiation.

2008-06-08T00:00:00Z,"MEYERSON--Monroe R., born August 23, 1930, to Harry and Beatrice Meyerson in Brooklyn, NY, died June 6, 2008, in Boca Raton, FL. He leaves behind his beloved wife of 53 Years, Leila Mann Meyerson, his children, Cindie (Dr. Donald) Kastenbaum, David Meyerson, and Stuart (Lisa) Meyerson, and five wonderful grandchildren: Julie, Harry, Jessica, Samuel and Benjamin. He attended Poly Prep Day School where he achieved a football scholarship to the University of NC/Chapel Hill. He graduated from New York University with a degree in engineering and economics and later obtained an MBA from the Trinity School at NYU. As a graduate of ROTC, he became a pilot in the Air Force and was honorably discharged in 1955. He began his career as project manager at Centrig Industries, a small familyoperated construction company in NYC in 1956, and during his 35 year tenure as its Chairman and CEO, grew the company into an internationally recognized leader in heavy industrial construction and a world leader in the installation of newspaper presses, including The New York Times, Chicago Tribune, Miami Herald, San Fransisco Chronicle, Charlotte Observer, and the Washingon Post. As a result of having been a dialysis patient in 1992, Mr. Meyerson founded the Dialysis Centers of America (DCA) in 1995 with a strong commitment to improving the quality of care, treatment and outcomes for dialysis patients. Within three years, DCA grew from a single location to the largest kidney dialysis treatment in the Midwest. DCA'a greatest accomplishment was in the development of renal care informatics which became the ''golden rule'' adopted by the dialysis industry. In 1998, Mr. Meyerson founded the Radiology Corporation of America (RCOA), an innovator and early adopter of Positron Emission Tomography (PET), a new molecular imaging technology that improved the diagnosis and treatment of many diseases, including the early detection of cancer and Alzheimer's Disease. Mr. Meyerson was also instrumental in founding the Institute of Molecular Technology, a trade association which educated the medical community about the benefits of PET technology which led to the acceptance of reimbursement protocols under Medicare. As a result of his daughter's juvenile diabetes in 1967, Mr. Meyerson was a co-founder and the inspiration for the Juvenile Diabetes Foundation (JDF), both the New York chapter and the national organization, where he served as a Board member for many years. In addition, Mr. Meyerson was aformer Director of Gatekeeper Solutions, the Whitney Art Museum, Dance Theater of Harlem, Boca Rio Country Club, and a member of Chief Executives Organization, World Presidents' Organization and Young Presidents' Organization. He was a renaissance man involved in Arts and Theatre and his philanthropic endeavors included support of Technion University, Kravis Center for the Performing Arts, Broward Center for the Performing Arts, University of Minnesota, American Parkinson's Disease Foundation, among many others. Mr. Meyerson was an avid art collector of photorealism and supported many young artists. He generously donated art to both the St. Louis Art Museum and the Whitney Museum Of Art. Services will be held Tuesday, June 10th, 2008, 11:45am at ''The Riverside'', 76th St. and Amsterdam Ave. In lieu of flowers, the family requests contributions be made to M.D. Anderson Cancer Research Center, Houston, TX, and the Juvenile Diabetes Foundation."
2008-06-08T00:00:00Z,"IN contrast to the writers' rooms of other series, the one for Showtime's ''Weeds'' is almost Spartan. ''We have eliminated most of the distractions from the room,'' said Craig Zisk, an executive producer. All the better, in a strike-shortened season, to focus on the work of reinventing this series, about a widowed suburban mother (Mary-Louise Parker) who sells marijuana. (She has just burned down her neighborhood.) Computers, P.D.A.'s and cellphones had to go. ''We were spending too much time text-messaging each other in the room about what everyone else was saying,'' he said. And at the beginning of the season, after Mr. Zisk and one of the writers lost weight by cutting out sugar, the staff of nine voted to institute a no-sugar policy in the writers' room. The sweets were replaced with fruit plates, dried fruit, nuts and energy drinks. ''We're a very focused group,'' Mr. Zisk said."

Serving children of NYC's Public Schools for over three decades, she was chosen by her peers ''Guidance Counselor of the Year'' three times. Paraphrasing Ted Kennedy, to Ellen love meant having a social conscience and battling the wrongs which needed our attention. Each time we act to improve the life of others, or strike out against injustice, we send forth a tiny ripple of hope. Ellen sent out lots of ripples. She was a good and decent woman, who saw wrong and tried to right it, saw suffering and tried to heal it. She will be remembered by her husband, Erwin Rafel-Frankel; sons, Gideon and Saul; sister, Judy Englander; nieces, Freya and Emily; grandnephew and niece, Nathan and Ruby and dear family and friends. Funeral services will take place Sunday, June 8, 10am at Temple Anshe Chesed, West End Avenue and 100th Street. May her memory, like her life be for a blessing. RAFEL--Ellen.

2008-06-08T00:00:00Z,"As Peggy Olson, the secretary turned junior copywriter at Sterling Cooper, the fictional 1960s Madison Avenue ad agency at the heart of ''Mad Men'' on AMC, Elisabeth Moss brings a full steno pad of subtleties to a young woman whose ambitions seem essentially futuristic. With her tentative movements, scrappy bangs and hard expressions, she gives us both striver and naïf, a woman blind to how much she yearns for until she lands in a Manhattan of fur-trimmed coats. Peggy embodies the show's mood of gritty postwar aspiration even more than her boss, Don Draper (Jon Hamm), who has climbed so high and so fast that he is suffering from his own kind of altitude sickness. What he ends up wanting, no Diners Club card can purchase. Watching Ms. Moss, feeling her fastidiously counting the miles between the Brooklyn of Peggy's upbringing and the Manhattan of Bonwit Teller, liberal sex and reinvention, you almost hurt. She does something close to somatizing Peggy's class anxieties, and the viewer can't help reaching for the aspirin."

2008-06-08T00:00:00Z,"My husband's mother and stepfather live in Hawaii, and while this arrangement is the envy of many of our friends who dream of tropical vacations, it is, in my opinion, an inconvenient one. When they visit, we seem to fall into rituals, keeping to certain haunts, as if to suggest that not much time has passed since we saw them last. One such place was a Greek restaurant in the West Village that served revani, an ambrosial dessert traditional to Macedonia, Greece's largest region. The moment my in-laws would bite into this tender semolina cake, the stress of their long flight east would fall away, and calm would settle over the table. When the restaurant sadly closed, I decided to try to recreate it for them at home. An ancient crossroads between Europe and the East, Macedonia developed a vibrant cuisine. The Egnatian Way, stretching from the Adriatic to Constantinople, helped pave the way for a gastronomic exchange that still influences Mediterranean food today. Over the years, Macedonia's port-side capital, Thessaloniki, became a safe haven for everyone from Christian pilgrims to Jews fleeing the Spanish Inquisition to refugees from Asia Minor. Given its traumatized citizenry, it's no wonder that the Thessalonikans took so passionately to the comfort of sweets, going so far as to nickname their city Glykomana, ''sweet mother.''"

When the semester ended at Christmastime, I went to New York to see a few friends and then, together with my girlfriend and another couple, flew to Las Vegas for New Year's. After that the four of us got a big rental car and drove from Las Vegas to San Francisco by way of Death Valley -- a proper road trip. But we dropped the car off when we arrived in San Francisco. There were three things we definitely wanted to see there: the Golden Gate Bridge, Alcatraz and cable cars. I knew the cable cars from TV shows and movies and definitely wanted to ride on them.

2008-06-08T00:00:00Z,"ONE freakishly stormy night several years ago in San Diego, my car stalled at a flooded intersection. As I pushed the car out of the intersection, lightning was going off all around like flash bulbs. Recently, the State of California sent me my tax refund, and curiously, $328 had been deducted from it. After quite a bit of research, I found the missing amount was courtesy of a traffic court in San Diego, which asserted that I had an unpaid ticket from years earlier. I said I was never notified of it and unaware of committing a violation. But it apparently stemmed from that freak thunderstorm. To condense a longer story: one of those flashes apparently was the flash from a red-light camera."

Born in the Bronx in 1927, he graduated from Townsend Harris High School, and, at just 18 years of age, from City College of New York. After serving in the Navy he completed graduate work in chemical engineering at Polytechnic University. For most of his career he was employed by Scientific Design/Halcon International, where he developed new chemical technology and worked on process design. He held numerous patents. More than a scientist, he was a great lover of the arts, particularly opera, and New York's Metropolitan Opera was his home away from home. A man of profound intellect whose storehouse of knowledge --and recall of baseball statistics --never ceased to amaze, Harold was perhaps most loved by those who knew him for his utter lack of pretention and his liberal broad-mindedness. He was his family's Answer Man and without him the world will be a far more confusing place.

2008-06-08T00:00:00Z,"YARD--Mary Howell, died at home in Manchester, Connecticut on the second of June. She was ninety-two years old. Born in Bucks County, Pennsylvania, she resided in New Jersey for most of her life. She was the daughter of Mary Abigail Johnson and Gershom Mott Howell, the granddaughter of William Gillingham Howell, a prominent New Jersey financier, and a descendant of Edward Howell, the leader of the colonists who founded Southampton, Long Island in 1640. A graduate of Miss Fine's School in Princeton, New Jersey, and of Smith College in Northampton, Massachusetts, class of 1937, she was a proponent of the importance of knowledge and a liberal arts education. Mary Emma married Edward Madison Yard on July 27, 1940. They met as children while horseback riding at Ely's in New Hope, PA. She taught English literature at Miss Fine's School prior to the birth of her three children. Mary Emma was a member of the Colonial Dames of New Jersey, the Junior League of Greater Princeton, the General Mercer Chapter DAR and the Princeton Present Day Club. She was also a deacon of the First Presbyterian Church. For thirty-five years she was on the Board of Trustees of the Old Barracks Museum in Trenton, New Jersey, serving as its president several times. She led the second restoration in 1979 and was the recipient of the first Beulah Oliphant award in 1991 for her contribution to the preservation of historic buildings. In her association with the Old Barracks she was carrying on a tradition of the Yard family. Several of her husband's ancestors played important roles in its history, including Joseph Yard who served as the first Barracks Master and Josephine Yard Breese, Edward's grandmother, who was one of the women who raised the money to save the Old Barracks and served as its first president. A supporter of civil rights, for many years in the 1940s she was the director of the Committee for Unity, whose purpose was to further the rights of black individuals. She continued this work in other ways during the 1950s, and was a recipient of an award in the 1960s for her efforts to advance the rights of blacks. Her life long love of travel, ocean liners and art were instilled by her mother with whom she traveled extensively in Europe, attending a school in Paris on one occasion. Following Mrs. Howell's death in 1932, Mary Emma's beloved Aunt, Thirza A. Howell, assumed the role of a mother. Mary Emma and her family summered in Ogunquit, Maine with Aunt Thirza for many years. She was predeceased by her husband and is survived by three daughters, Barbara Anne Yard of Manchester, CT, Marcia Louise Yard and her husband Dean R. DePietro of Manchester, CT, Sally Elizabeth Yard of La Jolla, California, and one granddaughter, Alexandra Yard Davies, also of La Jolla. Funeral services were by M.

Born in the Bronx in 1927, he graduated from Townsend Harris High School, and, at just 18 years of age, from City College of New York. After serving in the Navy he completed graduate work in chemical engineering at Polytechnic University. For most of his career he was employed by Scientific Design/Halcon International, where he developed new chemical technology and worked on process design. He held numerous patents. More than a scientist, he was a great lover of the arts, particularly opera, and New York's Metropolitan Opera was his home away from home. A man of profound intellect whose storehouse of knowledge --and recall of baseball statistics --never ceased to amaze, Harold was perhaps most loved by those who knew him for his utter lack of pretention and his liberal broad-mindedness. He was his family's Answer Man and without him the world will be a far more confusing place. Survivors include his wife of 54 years, Mildred, daughters Margot Gilman and Nora Blum, sons-in-law Stephen Tympanick and Jeffrey Blum, grandchildren Thea, Lily, Heather, Amanda and Jacob, brother Sheldon and cousin Herbert.

A graduate of Miss Fine's School in Princeton, New Jersey, and of Smith College in Northampton, Massachusetts, class of 1937, she was a proponent of the importance of knowledge and a liberal arts education.

(HBO) ROMAN POLANSKI: WANTED AND DESIRED (2008) In 1977 Mr. Polanski, above, the director of ''Rosemary's Baby'' and ''Chinatown,'' pleaded guilty to unlawful sexual intercourse with a 13-year-old girl and then, faced with a possible 50-year prison sentence, fled to Paris. He continues to live in France and remains a fugitive from justice in this country. This documentary, directed by Marina Zenovich, explores the myths that surround the case and the circumstances that led to the conviction and flight of Mr. Polanski, now 74, who in 2003 won the best-director Oscar for ''The Pianist.''

There was an innovation-versus-tradition argument in progress. Ms. Wilson was then an impossibly hip young singer making her name with a radical fringe that merged jazz improvisation with complicated funk (imagine that!). For her to record songs like ''I'm Old Fashioned'' and ''Polka Dots and Moonbeams'' -- with a straight-ahead rhythm section, treating the songs with due respect and scat singing -- amounted to decent frisson. It was a lovely record, too."

He leaves behind his beloved wife of 53 Years, Leila Mann Meyerson, his children, Cindie (Dr. Donald) Kastenbaum, David Meyerson, and Stuart (Lisa) Meyerson, and five wonderful grandchildren: Julie, Harry, Jessica, Samuel and Benjamin. He attended Poly Prep Day School where he achieved a football scholarship to the University of NC/Chapel Hill. He graduated from New York University with a degree in engineering and economics and later obtained an MBA from the Trinity School at NYU.

He began his career as project manager at Centrig Industries, a small familyoperated construction company in NYC in 1956, and during his 35 year tenure as its Chairman and CEO, grew the company into an internationally recognized leader in heavy industrial construction and a world leader in the installation of newspaper presses, including The New York Times, Chicago Tribune, Miami Herald, San Fransisco Chronicle, Charlotte Observer, and the Washingon Post. As a result of having been a dialysis patient in 1992, Mr. Meyerson founded the Dialysis Centers of America (DCA) in 1995 with a strong commitment to improving the quality of care, treatment and outcomes for dialysis patients. Within three years, DCA grew from a single location to the largest kidney dialysis treatment in the Midwest. DCA'a greatest accomplishment was in the development of renal care informatics which became the ''golden rule'' adopted by the dialysis industry. In 1998, Mr. Meyerson founded the Radiology Corporation of America (RCOA), an innovator and early adopter of Positron Emission Tomography (PET), a new molecular imaging technology that improved the diagnosis and treatment of many diseases, including the early detection of cancer and Alzheimer's Disease.

In addition, Mr. Meyerson was aformer Director of Gatekeeper Solutions, the Whitney Art Museum, Dance Theater of Harlem, Boca Rio Country Club, and a member of Chief Executives Organization, World Presidents' Organization and Young Presidents' Organization. He was a renaissance man involved in Arts and Theatre and his philanthropic endeavors included support of Technion University, Kravis Center for the Performing Arts, Broward Center for the Performing Arts, University of Minnesota, American Parkinson's Disease Foundation, among many others. Mr. Meyerson was an avid art collector of photorealism and supported many young artists. He generously donated art to both the St. Louis Art Museum and the Whitney Museum Of Art. Services will be held Tuesday, June 10th, 2008, 11:45am at ''The Riverside'', 76th St. and Amsterdam Ave. In lieu of flowers, the family requests contributions be made to M.D. Anderson Cancer Research Center, Houston, TX, and the Juvenile Diabetes Foundation."

He said it was ''an official'' -- not a referee -- who had called him to say that Yao was being singled out in games against the Dallas Mavericks. Van Gundy was fined $100,000 by the league for his comments. The error was repeated in a follow-up article in 2005 and again on Wednesday in an article about Tim Donaghy, a former referee who has pleaded guilty after being charged last year with conspiring with gamblers. In a court filing to seek leniency at sentencing, Donaghy and his lawyer cited the Van Gundy controversy among accusations of misconduct and manipulation of game results by N.B.A. executives and referees.

2008-06-13T00:00:00Z,"RENEGADE CRAFT FAIR Let's face it, hierarchy is passé. Want to watch TV? No need to wait for the networks; just shoot something with your friends and edit the video. How about some music? Go to iTunes and create your own mix. Or a scarf? Pick up some knitting needles, and, well, you get the idea. So it's no surprise that at a time when D.I.Y. is flourishing, people would embrace creating their own accessories, books, prints, home furnishings, you name it. Sue Daly, a jewelry designer, and a friend, Kathleen Habbley, went one step further: They created their own craft fair. ''When I started selling my jewelry, I thought it would be cool to participate in an art fair but didn't find an event that catered to the huge D.I.Y. scene so prevalent online,'' Ms. Daly explained in an e-mail message. So she started the Renegade Craft Fair in Chicago for people who specialize in handmade products and who somehow found the motivation to sell them. The fair's Brooklyn outpost gets under way at McCarren Park Pool, above, this weekend, for the fourth year. And, as the craft movement catches on, so has the fair. More than 200 vendors will set up shop, selling things from clothing to art to food to ceramics. This is more than just an average street fair. As its popularity has grown, it has become more selective, accepting ''less than half the artists who apply,'' Ms. Daly said."
2008-06-13T00:00:00Z,"MARK DI SUVERO In this age of sculptures of mindlessly enlarged recognizable objects that are all size but no scale, it is great to be reminded that big can also be abstract, and that abstract at its best requires scale. Case in point is ''Lowell's Ocean'' (2006), right, Mark di Suvero's latest exercise in well-tempered largeness at the Paula Cooper Gallery. Ms. Cooper may not have built her elegantly cavernous ground floor to accommodate Mr. di Suvero -- an artist with whom she has worked on and off for most of her long career -- but sometimes it sure looks that way. His works fare so well in this setting that it has occasionally been hard to tell if the art or the space is doing the heavy lifting. With his latest effort there is no question: ''Lowell's Ocean'' is among the great works of his career. It's an outstanding example of his ability to assemble huge steel elements in ways that are both playful and majestic, intimate and immense. The work consists of an enormous tripodlike structure (though with four legs) made of leaning and crisscrossing steel I-beams (a di Suvero signature). Resting high within its angles is a double spiral that has been cut from one immense sheet of steel and then popped into three dimensions to form two open, scrolling domes that operate in the gap between drawing-in-space and architecture."

2008-06-13T00:00:00Z,"'CÉLINE AND JULIE GO BOATING' For a movie so dense with literary and cinematic allusions and perceptual puzzles, Jacques Rivette's 1974 ''Céline and Julie Go Boating'' remains improbably lighthearted. Freewheeling and improvisatory -- the leads, Juliet Berto, above, and Dominque Labourier, share screenwriting credit with Mr. Rivette and three others -- it transports you back to a time when filmmaking seemed full of possibility and Paris was still an enchanted playground for the Nouvelle Vague. A down-the-rabbit-hole tale (''Alice's Adventures in Wonderland'' is one of the its touchstones) about Julie (Ms. Labourier), a librarian, who meets, trails and takes in Céline (Ms. Berto), a free-spirited magician, the film riffs on actors and acting, stories and storytelling, and, of course, movies and moviemaking. Céline and Julie are, as the subtitle calls them, two ''Phantom Ladies Over Paris'' (''Les Vampires,'' Louis Feuillade's silent-film serial, is another touchstone), intrepid explorers who, with the help of magic bonbons, slip into another world, a strange mansion in which a melodramatic story unfolds in jumbled bits and pieces. That story-within-a-story may be darkly foreboding, but Céline and Julie approach it playfully -- those magic bonbons can give a girl a case of the giggles -- and also with purpose. Through trial and error, they learn its rules and, by mastering, alter them, much like, you could say, a director making a movie."

2008-06-13T00:00:00Z,"ZINSSER--John Sharman, Jr., May 27, 2008. Witty, dear, deep and kind beyond kind, Johnny was a person of indelible charm, subtlety of mind, and effortless elegance, wisdom and generosity. Beloved husband of Anne, father of David and Nina Zinsser, Stephen Wadsworth Zinsser, and Amanda Moffat, and much much more than a stepfather to Peter and Olga von Ziegesar, Lisa Whip, Sondra, Anne and Ward Appleby, and Kate Lamdin. John's delicious humor and inexhaustible welcome brought their families, including 13 grandchildren, and hundreds of friends into his circle of adoring fans. He was a parent of epic patience and compassion. As an editor of Condensed Books at Reader's Digest, and ultimately Editor-in-Chief, he was for many years one of the best loved men (and best luncheon dates) in publishing. A keen editor, he was first liaison between the home office and offices worldwide, then between the Digest and the New York publishing world as Vice President in charge of rights. Before and after retiring he brought all his tact, taste and clarity of mind to many organizations as a volunteer, including the Metropolitan Opera National Council Auditions, the Connecticut Humanities Council, the Cornwall Library, the Cornwall Energy Task Force, and the Century Club. He was a voracious reader, a writer of warm, vivid letters, a lover of opera, a busy green thumb, and an expert tennis player, but mostly it was people he loved -their stories, their interests, their travails, their triumphs. Johnny, Daddy, you leave us no choice but to delight in what you gave us. Contributions: The Southern Poverty Law Center, www.splcenter.org"

But breaking long ago developed distinct regional and local flavors, and more recently, an international explosion of interest in this competitive, virtuosic form of street dancing started something of a renaissance back where it all started in New York. On Saturday you can see how they do it Windy City style, when the Chicago crew FootworKINGz comes to Coffey Park in Red Hook as part of Hip Hop Generation Next, a free block party run by the excellent public-performance organization Dancing in the Streets.

Today, with gasoline prices at record levels, the fragility of a lifestyle, economy and culture dependent on fossil fuel is sensed by everyone, even the most comfortable among us. I have often been amazed by the ways harsh and aggressive forms are taken over by the natural world. The gas stations and pumps that make modern life possible are among our most rationally planned buildings. Their function: get the customers to stop and fill their tanks, fast. And yet, how quickly filling stations disintegrate without constant maintenance. They lose their characteristic smell of oil and exhaust. Scavengers strip the pumps, revealing their hoses, belts, gears and electric motors. In some cases, trees grow out of the concrete; nature sings its song as the loud greens of the ailanthus trees, bushes and white flowers mix with the fading reds of the station walls."

The works were estimated to be worth a combined $612,000. The robbers paid the museum’s entrance fee of $2.45 and then overpowered guards to take the framed works.

Pillsbury III, L. Harrison Pillsbury, and Katherine Jose. PILLSBURY--Donaldson C. The Board and Staff of Lincoln Center for the Performing Arts, Inc. mourn the passing of Donaldson C. Pillsbury, an indispensable member of the Lincoln Center community. Chairman of the Board of The Chamber Music Society since 1993, his trusteeship and steadfast leadership were exemplary.

Bennack, Jr., Chairman Reynold Levy, President Lincoln Center for the Performing Arts, Inc. PILLSBURY--Donaldson C. The family and friends of Don Pillsbury mourn the loss of a beloved husband, father, grandfather, brother, and friend. Don died suddenly after a terrific bike ride with good friends along the Connecticut shore in Old Lyme, Connecticut on Thursday, June 12th. He was 67. The cause of death was heart failure. Don was a chairman of Sotheby's North and South America and former worldwide general counsel and executive vice president of Sotheby's. Before that he was a senior partner (1967-1993) at the law firm of Davis Polk & Wardwell. In addition to his work at Davis Polk and Sotheby's, Don pursued a wide variety of personal business and non - profit interests. He served as chairman of The Chamber Music Society of Lincoln Center in New York-a particular passion--and as a director of the Lincoln Center for the Performing Arts. For 17 years, he was a trustee of the Nightingale Bamford School, also in New York City. More recently, he served as a trustee of Robert College in Istanbul, Turkey, the New York Community Trust, and the Stuart Family Foundation, a private foundation based outside of Chicago. We will remember everything about him. But especially for his utter integrity, his lovely humor, his passion for music, good wine, Cheetos. He loved the outdoors, biking, skiing, hiking, and sailing. We lovingly remember his incredible generosity and joy in simple things, the family, the garden, the silly cards, obscure gifts and collectibles--often acquired on E-Bay. His grandchildren were the light of his life. We will miss him dearly. He is survived by his wife Marnie, his children Donaldson Clark Pillsbury, Jr. and his wife Skye of San Francisco, CA, Blair Pillsbury Enders and her husband Jack of New York, NY, Wendy Pillsbury Eichmann, and her husband Chris of Greenwich, CT and his five grandchildren Tyler and Sam Eichmann, Nicholas and Marian Enders, and Clark Pillsbury.

Don served as Chairman of the Board of Directors from 1993 to 2004 and remained on the Board as Vice Chairman until his sudden death on Thursday. Inspired by a deep love of music, Don was steadfastly devoted to carrying forth and enhancing the mission of the Chamber Music Society. Under his guidance the Society initiated a significant expansion of its Alice Tully Hall season, created new musical programs, and developed a national radio series that successfully drew new and appreciative audiences. He also encouraged the development of the Society's wide-ranging education programs and residency opportunities for young artists. A man of impeccable taste and great integrity, Don was the model of a good and decent man and inspired others through his personal generosity and wise leadership. His immense capacity for friendship was deeply felt and especially appreciated by his colleagues on the Board and by the artists and staff of the Society. We will miss his enthusiasm, commitment, and his reliable presence among us. We extend our deepest sympathy to his wife Marnie and to his family. Peter Frelinghuysen Chairman Charles Hamilton Vice Chairman David Finckel and Wu Han Artistic Directors Norma Hurlburt Executive Director PILLSBURY--Don.

The trustees, faculty, students, and staff of The Rockefeller University community mourn the sudden and untimely passing of our cherished friend, Don Pillsbury, an esteemed member of The Rockefeller University Council and husband of Marnie Pillsbury, our beloved Vice Chairman. Like all who knew him, we loved Don dearly, and we are heartbroken for Marnie and her children. We send them every wish for comfort and strength as they face this devastating loss. Don's friendship with Rockefeller University began as a result of Marnie's involvement; we were the beneficiary of the wonderful partnership that they shared in all aspects of their lives. Along with Marnie, he became a passionate ambassador and advocate for the advancement of biomedical research and for the University. Don was a man of deep integrity, keen intellect, discerning judgment, and immense personal warmth. He gave back to the world through his many pro bono involvements. As Chair of the Chamber Music Society of Lincoln Center, he combined a love of music with strong leadership abilities to enrich the culture of our great City. The joy he felt in life, and in his love for Marnie and his children, was palpable. A remarkable couple, Marnie and Don's enduring love and devotion to each other had a way of embracing everyone around them. Gifted at love, their love was a gift to us all. We are so fortunate to have known Don, and we will miss him tremendously. With deepest sorrow, we extend our condolences to Marnie; to their children, Don, Blair, and Wendy; and to the entire Pillsbury family.

2008-06-15T00:00:00Z,"Nowadays, when a politician wants to make a point to the ''folks,'' he goes to the diner to meet and greet and empathize while scarfing a grilled cheese.

So I had to laugh -- and feel a little sad too -- when I came across an article in The Times from 1935 in which Huey Long, the colorful Louisiana senator known as the Kingfish, chose not a diner in Peoria but the Hotel New Yorker in New York City as his venue for attacking President Roosevelt's New Deal.

The money -- last year's bonus added up to nearly two months' pay -- helps feed their families and secure education for their children.

Beloved mother of Rebecca Folkman, Benjamin Folkman and Jonathan Folkman, grandmother of David Folkman Mazieres and Christopher Folkman. After graduating from Barnard College at age 19, she earned a Master's Degree in music. A social worker during the 1930s, she was also active in Junior Federation, undertaking administrative duties and composing a full-length musical comedy for a Brooklyn Academy of Music benefit performance. In 1940 she married Dr. Nathan Folkman. She later joined the Board of Hamilton-Madison Settlement House. Widowed in 1956, she entered the business world and proved a pioneer. Erecting a new commercial building on Northern Boulevard for her linen supply company, she changed the nature of the supply industry by extending services beyond residences to include smaller hospitals. She soon became a member of the Board of Maimonides Medical Center. In 1974 she married Clarence D. Bell (deceased 2001). Subsequently, she began a five-year tenure as the first woman president of Maimonides. In this post, she devised an ingenious plan to provide an existing building with a major extension. In retirement, she served as a Founding Director of the Palm Beach Festival and gave significant support to the Palm Beach Opera and the Society of the Four Arts. Elected President of the Palm Beach Towers Condominium, she oversaw a major renovation of the building. She also maintained ties to New York, serving as a Trustee of Barnard College, where she recently attended the 75th reunion of the Class of 1932. At Atria Senior Residence in New York, where she relocated in 2006, she founded and became the first President of the Residents' Council. No funeral services will be held.

And Assembly New York, a new clothing and curio shop on Ludlow Street, is one of the more inspired stores catering to it. The owner, Greg Armas (right), has stocked the shop with a tight selection of well-made ''antitrend'' pieces that are drawing male and female shoppers: shrunken jackets and drainpipe trousers from Endovanera, broken-in T-shirts and summer scarves from the Los Angeles newcomer Raquel Allegra and vintage henleys and cardigans from the '40s. Mr. Armas also has antique decorations, Victorian-inspired jewelry and his own collaborative projects including beach towels, audio equipment and Native American quilts. ''I look at every piece in the store as an authentic article,'' said Mr. Armas, who used wood that he pulled from the East River to build the interior. ''It's a different kind of curation.

Michael Sovern, Chairman of The Board of Directors of Sotheby's, Chief Executive Officer Bill Ruprecht and Sotheby's worldwide staff mourn the untimely passing of their colleague and friend, Don Pillsbury, on June 12th. Distinguished by his integrity, grace, wisdom and honor, Don was the epitome of a fine and decent man. He leaves an enormous void at Sotheby's and we will miss him. Our condolences go to his wife, Marnie, and their children Donaldson C. Pillsbury, Jr., Barbara Blair Enders and Wendy Pillsbury Eichmann; to his five grandchildren and to his siblings John S. Pillsbury III, L. Harrison Pillsbury, and Katherine Jose. PILLSBURY--Donaldson C. The trustees, faculty, students, and staff of The Rockefeller University community mourn the sudden and untimely passing of our cherished friend, Don Pillsbury, an esteemed member of The Rockefeller University Council and husband of Marnie Pillsbury, our beloved Vice Chairman. Like all who knew him, we loved Don dearly, and we are heartbroken for Marnie and her children. We send them every wish for comfort and strength as they face this devastating loss. Don's friendship with Rockefeller University began as a result of Marnie's involvement; we were the beneficiary of the wonderful partnership that they shared in all aspects of their lives. Along with Marnie, he became a passionate ambassador and advocate for the advancement of biomedical research and for the University. Don was a man of deep integrity, keen intellect, discerning judgment, and immense personal warmth. He gave back to the world through his many pro bono involvements. As Chair of the Chamber Music Society of Lincoln Center, he combined a love of music with strong leadership abilities to enrich the culture of our great City. The joy he felt in life, and in his love for Marnie and his children, was palpable. A remarkable couple, Marnie and Don's enduring love and devotion to each other had a way of embracing everyone around them. Gifted at love, their love was a gift to us all. We are so fortunate to have known Don, and we will miss him tremendously. With deepest sorrow, we extend our condolences to Marnie; to their children, Don, Blair, and Wendy; and to the entire Pillsbury family.

The family and friends of Don Pillsbury mourn the loss of a beloved husband, father, grandfather, brother, and friend. Don died suddenly after a terrific bike ride with good friends along the Connecticut shore in Old Lyme, Connecticut on Thursday, June 12th. He was 67. The cause of death was heart failure. Don was a chairman of Sotheby's North and South America and former worldwide general counsel and executive vice president of Sotheby's. Before that he was a senior partner (1967-1993) at the law firm of Davis Polk & Wardwell. In addition to his work at Davis Polk and Sotheby's, Don pursued a wide variety of personal business and non - profit interests. He served as chairman of The Chamber Music Society of Lincoln Center in New York-a particular passion--and as a director of the Lincoln Center for the Performing Arts. For 17 years, he was a trustee of the Nightingale Bamford School, also in New York City. More recently, he served as a trustee of Robert College in Istanbul, Turkey, the New York Community Trust, and the Stuart Family Foundation, a private foundation based outside of Chicago. We will remember everything about him. But especially for his utter integrity, his lovely humor, his passion for music, good wine, Cheetos. He loved the outdoors, biking, skiing, hiking, and sailing. We lovingly remember his incredible generosity and joy in simple things, the family, the garden, the silly cards, obscure gifts and collectibles--often acquired on E-Bay. His grandchildren were the light of his life. We will miss him dearly. He is survived by his wife Marnie, his children Donaldson Clark Pillsbury, Jr. and his wife Skye of San Francisco, CA, Blair Pillsbury Enders and her husband Jack of New York, NY, Wendy Pillsbury Eichmann, and her husband Chris of Greenwich, CT and his five grandchildren Tyler and Sam Eichmann, Nicholas and Marian Enders, and Clark Pillsbury. His siblings John S. Pillsbury III, L. Harrison Pillsbury, and Katharine Jose also survive him.

In lieu of flowers, contributions may be sent to The Chamber Music Society of Lincoln Center, Robert College in Istanbul, and the New York Community Trust. PILLSBURY--Donaldson C.

We offer our heartfelt sympathy to his wife Marnie and their family. PILLSBURY--Donaldson C. The Board, artists and staff of The Chamber Music Society of Lincoln Center note with great sadness the loss of our longstanding Board member and cherished friend Don Pillsbury. Don served as Chairman of the Board of Directors from 1993 to 2004 and remained on the Board as Vice Chairman until his sudden death on Thursday. Inspired by a deep love of music, Don was steadfastly devoted to carrying forth and enhancing the mission of the Chamber Music Society. Under his guidance the Society initiated a significant expansion of its Alice Tully Hall season, created new musical programs, and developed a national radio series that successfully drew new and appreciative audiences. He also encouraged the development of the Society's wide-ranging education programs and residency opportunities for young artists. A man of impeccable taste and great integrity, Don was the model of a good and decent man and inspired others through his personal generosity and wise leadership. His immense capacity for friendship was deeply felt and especially appreciated by his colleagues on the Board and by the artists and staff of the Society. We will miss his enthusiasm, commitment, and his reliable presence among us. We extend our deepest sympathy to his wife Marnie and to his family. Peter Frelinghuysen Chairman Charles Hamilton Vice Chairman David Finckel and Wu Han Artistic Directors Norma Hurlburt Executive Director PILLSBURY--Don. It is with profound sadness that my colleagues and I mourn the untimely passing of Don Pillsbury, devoted husband of our beloved associate, Marnie.

BEHIND THE NEWS Though he remains deeply unpopular in Europe, it was clear that he had repaired at least some of the strain over the war in Iraq. European leaders greeted him with evident warmth, and Pope Benedict XVI led a tour of the gardens where he prays each evening -- the first time the pontiff has greeted a world leader there, the White House said -- and offered a gift of four volumes about St. Peter's Basilica. ''Perhaps you'll have some time to read it,'' the pope told him."

Commercial fishermen are suffering because of much-higher diesel costs. For salmon fishermen, the fuel burden is adding insult to the injury of a season that was curtailed because of sharply declining stocks. And recreational boaters are finding that their love of the water is having a much more substantial impact on their wallets. When a boater finished filling up his boat's tank earlier this month in Patchogue, N.Y., before a day of fishing off Fire Island, the price tag was an eyepopping $250 for 50 gallons of gas."

She was the daughter of William Morris Houghton and Mary Motte (Hess) Pringle. The family lived in Plainfield, NJ where Hess attended The Hartridge School. She graduated from Radcliffe College and pursued graduate studies there in Anthropology. In the midst of the Depression, she moved to New York City where she worked at the New York Herald Tribune. There she met the soon-to-be legendary newspaperman, L. L. Engelking and they were married in 1939. The Engelkings, with three children, lived in Forest Hills, Queens and then Plainfield, NJ. In the 1950s, Hess returned to graduate school, earning a Masters in Library Science from Rutgers University. She was a Librarian at the Plainfield and Madison, NJ Libraries for many years. In 1977, the Engelkings retired to Cooperstown where L. L. Engelking died in 1980. Hess worked at the Cooperstown Library, and later volunteered there and at the Bassett Hospital and the New York Historical Association. She was a redoubtable Hiker on the back roads and trails of Cooperstown and all over Europe. In her 80s, she learned how to cross country ski and climbed Mt. Algonquin in the Adirondacks. She was always the consummate reference Librarian, never giving up on an explanation until she had the appropriate source material, and she possessed of an Anthropologists immense insight into human behavior. She was known for her grit and tenacity and realistic approach to life. An admirer said, ''If Hess dies, that means we all have to die.'' She is saluted, loved and missed by her children Elizabeth Mueller, Mary Motte Hall and Peter Engelking; their spouses David Barnes and Connie Engelking; her brother William Houghton and her niece Charlotte Houghton Friedman; her eight grandchildren William Teitler, Joseph Teitler, Sarah Teitler, John Teitler, Timothy Hall, Andrew Hall, Emily Engelking and Joshua Engelking; and by her eight greatgrandchildren.

''I actually hadn't been to White Sands since I was a child. I can remember digging my feet down in the sand when I was a kid and feeling that cool sand. It's warm on top, then cool underneath. I was there this time to fly kites under the full moon; because of the white sand, everything just shows up and sort of glows. This kite -- called the Spirit Flier -- was white along with the sand, and there was an eerie glow that happened. The winds were calm, just enough to keep my kites aloft. There's a special feeling about that. You feel the tug on the string, you give it just enough pull to keep it up in the air. I've been a university art professor for 30 years. I love sculpture, I love painting, and I really feel that kites are a flying art form. They're very sculptural, very visual. And when you're flying a kite, you can't help but be connected to that.

Like all who knew him, we loved Don dearly, and we are heartbroken for Marnie and her children. We send them every wish for comfort and strength as they face this devastating loss. Don's friendship with Rockefeller University began as a result of Marnie's involvement; we were the beneficiary of the wonderful partnership that they shared in all aspects of their lives. Along with Marnie, he became a passionate ambassador and advocate for the advancement of biomedical research and for the University. Don was a man of deep integrity, keen intellect, discerning judgment, and immense personal warmth. He gave back to the world through his many pro bono involvements. As Chair of the Chamber Music Society of Lincoln Center, he combined a love of music with strong leadership abilities to enrich the culture of our great City. The joy he felt in life, and in his love for Marnie and his children, was palpable. A remarkable couple, Marnie and Don's enduring love and devotion to each other had a way of embracing everyone around them. Gifted at love, their love was a gift to us all. We are so fortunate to have known Don, and we will miss him tremendously. With deepest sorrow, we extend our condolences to Marnie; to their children, Don, Blair, and Wendy; and to the entire Pillsbury family.

Don died suddenly after a terrific bike ride with good friends along the Connecticut shore in Old Lyme, Connecticut on Thursday, June 12th. He was 67. The cause of death was heart failure. Don was a chairman of Sotheby's North and South America and former worldwide general counsel and executive vice president of Sotheby's. Before that he was a senior partner (1967-1993) at the law firm of Davis Polk & Wardwell. In addition to his work at Davis Polk and Sotheby's, Don pursued a wide variety of personal business and non - profit interests. He served as chairman of The Chamber Music Society of Lincoln Center in New York-a particular passion--and as a director of the Lincoln Center for the Performing Arts. For 17 years, he was a trustee of the Nightingale Bamford School, also in New York City. More recently, he served as a trustee of Robert College in Istanbul, Turkey, the New York Community Trust, and the Stuart Family Foundation, a private foundation based outside of Chicago. We will remember everything about him. But especially for his utter integrity, his lovely humor, his passion for music, good wine, Cheetos. He loved the outdoors, biking, skiing, hiking, and sailing. We lovingly remember his incredible generosity and joy in simple things, the family, the garden, the silly cards, obscure gifts and collectibles--often acquired on E-Bay. His grandchildren were the light of his life. We will miss him dearly. He is survived by his wife Marnie, his children Donaldson Clark Pillsbury, Jr. and his wife Skye of San Francisco, CA, Blair Pillsbury Enders and her husband Jack of New York, NY, Wendy Pillsbury Eichmann, and her husband Chris of Greenwich, CT and his five grandchildren Tyler and Sam Eichmann, Nicholas and Marian Enders, and Clark Pillsbury.

2008-06-16T00:00:00Z,"9 P.M. (HBO) RESOLVED (2008) Until the 1960s high school debate was an art form, a combination of ideas and eloquence. Today debate has evolved into a sport in which students memorize their arguments, employ a specialized jargon and use ''the spread,'' a style of machine-gun delivery at up to 400 words a minute. This documentary from Greg Whiteley follows two socio-economically and stylistically contrasting teams in their quest for the championship at the University of California-Berkeley Invitational Tournament and as their members seek admission to elite universities. The documentary also seeks to illuminate the racial and class divide in American education. Past debaters, including Justice Samuel A. Alito Jr. of the Supreme Court, the actor Josh Lucas, the journalists Jane Pauley and Juan Williams, and the political adviser Karl Rove, discuss the value of their oratory skills. 11 A.M.

2008-06-17T00:00:00Z,"In the continuing battle between Dan Brown and the Roman Catholic Church, this round goes to the church. Two years after Vatican officials urged a boycott of the film “The Da Vinci Code,” based on Mr. Brown’s blockbuster novel, the Rome diocese said Monday that two churches had been declared off limits to film crews for “Angels & Demons,” the “Da Vinci Code” prequel, The Associated Press reported. Msgr. Marco Fibbi, a spokesman for the diocese, said that the film “does not conform to our views” and “treats religious issues in a way that contrasts with common religious sentiment.” Permission to film inside Santa Maria del Popolo, above, and Santa Maria della Vittoria, both in central Rome, was denied in 2007, but the situation did not become crucial until now because production of the movie was delayed by the writers’ strike. “Angels & Demons” reunites the director of “The Da Vinci Code,” Ron Howard, and its star, Tom Hanks, with Mr. Hanks reprising his role as the Harvard symbologist Robert Langdon in a story that involves a papal conclave, the cult of the Illuminati and a high-tech threat to the Vatican. Mr. Brown, an executive producer of both films, published “Angels & Demons” three years before “The Da Vinci Code.” “This is a prequel to ‘The Da Vinci Code,’ and it’s clear that the theme is similar,” Monsignor Fibbi said. The ban will not stop crews from filming the exteriors of the churches."

Judge Ott’s 2004 ruling permitted the foundation, which has struggled financially, to bypass the charter and bylaws of its founder, Albert C. Barnes, who stipulated that no picture in his collection could be lent, sold or moved from the walls of the galleries that he built for it in Merion. The judge said at the time that he considered the move to a downtown location “the only viable alternative” to save the Barnes from bankruptcy. But opponents contend that the collection’s financial troubles have been overstated and that new ways to raise money to prevent a move have emerged. James R. Matthews, chairman of the Montgomery County Commissioners, said in a statement that he believed the county had “exhausted any real chance of overturning Judge Ott’s decision.”."
2008-06-17T00:00:00Z,"Vin Cipolla will succeed Kent L. Barwick as president of the Municipal Art Society of New York, Philip K. Howard, the society’s chairman, announced on Monday. Mr. Cipolla is currently the president and chief executive of the National Park Foundation and a former executive vice president of the National Trust for Historic Preservation. Mr. Cipolla will assume his position with the society in early 2009, society officials said. He previously served for nine years as chairman of the Institute of Contemporary Art in Boston, overseeing the development of the organization’s new waterfront museum. The nonprofit Municipal Art Society strives to promote excellence in urban design and planning, contemporary architecture, historic preservation and public art in New York City. Mr. Barwick, who last year announced his intention to step down, will take a one-year sabbatical before returning to the society as president emeritus. He served as executive director from 1969 to 1975 and president from 1983 to 1995, and returned as president in 1999. He has also served as president of the New York State Historical Association, chairman of New York City’s Landmarks Preservation Commission and director of the New York State Council on the Arts."
2008-06-17T00:00:00Z,"One year after earning its smallest television audience on record, the broadcast of the Tony Awards appeared to fare no better in the ratings on Sunday. According to Nielsen’s overnight estimates, CBS’s presentation of the awards show from 8 to 11 p.m. attracted 6.2 million viewers, even with Nielsen’s preliminary estimates a year ago but just slightly more than last year’s final tally, issued a day later, of 5.7 million. CBS ended the night mired in third place. ABC easily finished first as its live coverage of Game 5 of the National Basketball Association championship series averaged well over 13.5 million viewers in preliminary estimates of the 9-to-11 time slots. NBC ranked second, leading early in the night with the conclusion of its all-day coverage of the final round of the U.S. Open golf championship, which averaged just under 14 million viewers from 7 to 9. A “Saturday Night Live” special honoring the work of Mike Myers drew 4.6 million viewers to NBC from 9 to 11.

In order to say someday that you knew the early work of Sally Oswald or Sigrid Gilmer, get to the 13th annual Clubbed Thumb Summerworks festival, continuing through June 28. This weekend will feature the final performances of ''Vendetta Chrome,'' by Ms. Oswald (with Jenny Seastone Stern, above left, and Lisa Rafaela Clair), and the opening of the last show in the series, Ms. Gilmer's ''Slavey.'' (The first production in the short three-show season, ''Gentleman Caller,'' by Ann Marie Healy, closed on June 14.)"

2008-06-20T00:00:00Z,"Like many people outside the United States, Canadians have taken an unusually keen interest in this year's presidential election. A memorandum was leaked suggesting that Senator Barack Obama's campaign had privately assured Canadian diplomats not to regard his call to renegotiate the North American Free Trade Agreement too seriously, for example, and became the subject of intense political debate in Parliament in March. So there is considerable anticipation in Canada's capital as the presidential campaign prepares to move briefly onto foreign soil on Friday. A speech by Senator John McCain at a faux-chateau-style hotel that is an Ottawa landmark is believed to be the first appearance of an American presidential candidate in Canada in an election year."

The son of George W. Perkins, the first U.S. Ambassador to N.A.T.O, and Linn Merck Perkins, George grew up in New York City. He graduated from The Hill School early in 1942 so that he could join in the war effort. Because of an eye injury at age 11 he could not enter military service, but instead joined the American Field Service and drove ambulances in Burma throughout the war. He returned afterwards to graduate from the University of Maine in 1949 with a B.S. in Agriculture. In 1950 he married Nancy Foster, whom he met during college, and moved to Millbrook, New York where he raised a grand champion herd of Black Angus cattle until 1979. He was an avid traveler, exploring every continent, and was especially interested in Africa. His travel was curtailed during the last 20 years of his life as his health began to fail, but he never lost his good humor, optimism and love of life. In addition to his wife of 58 years, he is survived by his daughter Jennifer Perkins Speers (and husband Randy), his sisters Penelope P. Wilson and Anne P. Cabot, seven nieces and one nephew. He was predeceased by his son George III. The burial will be held on June 28th at 12:00 noon at Nine Partners Cemetery, Millbrook, New York. In lieu of flowers, contributions can be made to the Millbrook Fire Department and/or Rescue Squad. Services by Allen Funeral Home, Millbrook, NY."

A crusading journalist, Ms. Politkovskaya (above) was a dogged critic of Mr. Putin and a tireless reporter of Russian human rights abuses in the Chechen war, which she considered a genocide. ''I understand your question: How come I am still alive?'' she says early in Eric Bergkraut's ''Letter to Anna,'' one of the closing-night movies of the Human Rights Watch International Film Festival at the Walter Reade Theater. ''When I really think about it, it's a miracle.'' Mr. Bergkraut had several hours of footage of Ms. Politkovskaya, filmed in 2003 and 2004 for a documentary about Chechnya, and when she died, he made ''Letter to Anna'': partly a tribute, partly an investigation of her death and partly a consideration and continuation of her work. Her presence gives the film its eerie intensity. Here is the soft-spoken, almost recessive Ms. Politkovskaya talking, wandering, laughing. Here are her eyes, watching, recording, calmly peering through glasses at the world's horrors."

Experts say Mr. Obama likely experienced a surge in donations after he took the nomination earlier this month."

2008-06-21T00:00:00Z,"Now it is clear why the farmer wants a wife: to help fill sandbags. Matt Neustadt, above, the Missouri farmer who is nearing the end of his televised search for a potential mate on the CW reality show “Farmer Wants a Wife,” found himself with bigger priorities this week when a levee near his family’s farm gave way, opening up some 700 of its 2,000 acres to flooding. Mr. Neustadt, of Portage Des Sioux, about 25 miles north of St. Louis, is just one of thousands along the Mississippi and other rivers who are suffering from flooding. The Neustadt family land, near Alton, has flooded at least a half-dozen times in the last 35 years, Mr. Neustadt said in a telephone interview. Even before the levee broke on Thursday, the land had been soaked by seeping groundwater. “We were able to plant about 500 acres of corn,” Mr. Neustadt said. “We might have 300 left.” The flooding, which had Mr. Neustadt shoveling sand into bags for much of Wednesday and Thursday, has left him little time to think about television. The series, which was taped last summer, is scheduled to conclude on Wednesday, when Mr. Neustadt, 30, chooses between Christa, 22, and Brooke, 23. The women have feuded since the opening episode, when Brooke interrupted Christa’s date with Matt by wrapping his truck in toilet paper.

The move is partly a response to an audit released five months ago that found that the Smithsonian’s revenue-generating arm, established in 1999, was poorly managed and lacked oversight. “What they are trying to do here is make sure the business operations are more closely aligned with the Smithsonian’s mission,” a Smithsonian spokeswoman said.

2008-06-22T00:00:00Z,"LEE--Sidney, four term Virgin Island Senator, philanthropist, businessman, and scientist --died last Friday at the age of 89. He was living at his home in St. Croix until three weeks ago when he became ill. His death at New York Presbyterian Hospital was caused by acute leukemia, said his children Candy and Phillip. Senator Lee served four terms in the Virgin Islands Legislature, becoming Vice President of the Thirteenth Legislature and chairman of the Finance Committee. He subsequently served as chairman of finance on the Virgin Islands Port Authority. His passion was public service, serving many terms on the Board of Education. He was a beloved philanthropist, donating to a variety of causes. He gave a portion of the beach at Sandy Point as a public park for the people of St. Croix, and the rest became a national park. He donated the Sidney Lee Theater at Island Center, and donated to Island Center summer camps for youth. He funded a multitude of charitable, educational and philanthropic activities including a playground at St. Croix Country Day School and a sports facility at In Balance Ranch Academy. His Dream Foundation helped a class of Virgin Islanders attend college. Sidney Lee attended Winona Military Academy where he graduated first in his high school class. Subsequently he also graduated first in his class from the University of Pennsylvania where he majored in chemical engineering. Pursuing his doctorate at Cornell, he was commandeered to leave school to help with the war effort by doing research on jet fuel, which ultimately contributed to American air superiority. After the war he became involved in business in Texas and in the Virgin Islands. He was president of a consulting laboratory which served as the crime lab for the City of Dallas and testified in hundreds of cases. His laboratory also expanded into manufacturing, testing, and certification. He served on the board of directors of American Shipbuilding. He was president of the Junior Chamber of Commerce, and voted one of the five most outstanding young men of Texas. First coming to the Virgin Islands in the 1940s, he served as President of the West Indies Investment Company, involved in land development on all three islands and construction. He helped found and served on the board of the Virgin Islands Bank and Trust whose five branches later became the Chase Manhattan Bank in the Virgin Islands. He also served as president of the Rotary Club of St. Croix, president of Pelican Cove Condominiums, president of the Jewish Community Center, Grand Marshall of the St. Patricks Day Parade, president of the theater group at Island Center, and served on the boards of numerous civic and philanthropic organizations. He served as Democratic National Committeeman, and was a frequent delegate to the Democratic National Convention, and was a delegate to the Virgin Island Constitutional Conventions. He was voted most admired man in the Virgin Islands in the Daily News poll. In later years he published an admired column, Lee Lets Loose, in the St. Croix Avis. He received the Humanist Award from the Virgin Islands Humanities Council, an award which recognizes Virgin Islanders who make an exemplary contribution to the cultural life of the V.I. community through the humanities. Senator Lee is survived by his children Candy Lee and her husband Joseph Ward, Phillip Lee and his wife Diane Rudolph, and his grandchildren Jason, David, and Jennifer. A memorial service which will be held in St. Croix is planned for later in the year. In lieu of flowers, donations should be sent to The Sidney Lee Theatre c/o The Island Center for the Performing Arts, Box 5976, Sunny Isle, Virgin Islands 00823."

2008-06-22T00:00:00Z,"JORGENSEN--Marion Newbert Marion Newbert Jorgensen, a civic leader and prominent philanthropist in Los Angeles for five decades, died Wednesday at Saint John's Health Center in Santa Monica, CA. She was 96. Marion Newbert was born on March 18, 1912 to Mr. and Mrs. Leroy Newbert of Chicago, Illinois. In 1913 she moved West with her family by private railroad car and later attended Marlborough School, one of the foremost college-preparatory schools in Los Angeles. A licensed aircraft pilot at the age of 17, she attended the noted liberal arts college Finch College in New York City and returned to Los Angeles. In 1930, she married movie producer Milton Harold Bren, who was the Executive Vice President and Producer at MGM Studios and experienced Hollywood during a time of tremendous growth in the entertainment industry. He served in the United States Naval Services during World War II as a Lieutenant Commander. They had two sons, Donald Bren, chairman of The Irvine Company in Newport Beach, CA and Peter Bren, a senior partner with KBS Investors of New York City, NY. While Great Britain was at war in Europe in 1940, Mrs. Jorgensen founded Bundles For Britain, an organization that provided non-military aid to the British people. Women crocheted sweaters and made clothing as Bundles For Britain sent food and clothes overseas from the then-neutral United States. When the United States entered World War II in 1941, Bundles For Britain evolved into the United States Naval Aide Auxiliary. Mrs. Jorgensen was the president of this organization that provided aid to service personnel and United States Navy and Marine dependents. After the conclusion of her first marriage in 1947, she met steel entrepreneur Earle M. Jorgensen while doing volunteer work for the Red Cross. They were married in 1953 and their 47-year wonderful union continued until Mr. Jorgensen's passing in 1999. The Jorgensens were among the social elite of Los Angeles. The couple remained close friends with Ronald and Nancy Reagan for more than 40 years, as Mr. Jorgensen served on Mr. Reagan's ''Kitchen Cabinet'', an informal network of businessmen who advised Mr. Reagan and urged him to run for governor of California in 1966 and later for President. Mr. and Mrs. Reagan celebrated his election to the governorship of California and his election to the presidency of the United States at the Jorgensen's house. ''I was privileged, and blessed, to know Marion Jorgensen as a dear friend for almost fifty years. She was one of the most generous women I have ever known. There isn't a worthwhile cause in this country that hasn't benefited from Marion's generosity. She loved politics, music, education, the arts, and gave liberally to medical research and children's charities in Los Angeles and across the nation,'' said Mrs. Ronald Reagan. ''My love and sympathy goes out to her two children, Don and Peter, and her entire family.'' Mrs. Jorgensen was credited with sparking her husband Earle's interest in philanthropy and they were active in many civic, cultural and charitable causes including the Boy Scouts, the YMCA, several hospitals and the Los Angeles Music Center. ''My mother enjoyed a wonderfully fulfilling life and was a strong inspiration to me,'' said Donald Bren. ''Her commitment to philanthropy and to the communities in which she lived impacted me deeply and formed my passion to give back to the community.'' Mrs. Jorgensen began working with Saint John's in the 1950s and led committees, engaged volunteers and spearheaded legendary evenings such as the Dinner for Prince Charles, the Black and White Ball with Bob Hope, and a series of star-studded evenings, the Bal Rouge and the Crystal Balls, with Frank Sinatra, Dean Martin, Sammy Davis, Jr., and Joey Bishop. After the 1994 Northridge earthquake threatened to close the hospital forever, she agreed to serve on the First Step Committee and co-chaired the Campaign Cabinet to lead the Campaign for Saint John's. She served as a leader on many important Foundation committees including Board Affairs and the Executive Committee and allowed the small community hospital to rebuild from the devastation and attain the flagship status Saint John's enjoys today. Last October, Mrs. Jorgensen was presented with the Spirit of Saint John's Award by the Saint John's Health Center Foundation Board of Trustees in recognition of her many contributions. The award honors an individual whose vision, determination and generosity of spirit have advanced the mission of the Health Center. After serving with distinction on the Los Angeles World Affairs Council, Mrs. Jorgensen was honored by her peers with election to Life Director. She was the first woman to serve as chairman of the board of overseers of the Huntington Library Art Gallery and Botanical Gardens, and for her service in developing the world famous botanical gardens, she was elected Trustee Emeritus. Mrs. Jorgensen was an Honorary Trustee of Childrens Hospital Los Angeles and served on the board of The Colleagues. Included among the other philanthropic endeavors that benefited from Mrs. Jorgensen's support over the years were the Los Angeles Orphanage Guild, the ARCS Foundation, the American Red Cross, Loyola Marymount University and the Prince of Wales Foundation. Additionally, Mrs. Jorgensen served on the President's Blue Ribbon 400 for the Los Angeles Music Center and as director of the Los Angeles Symphony Association, was a Member of the Board of Trustees of the John F. Kennedy Center for the Performing Arts and was a Founding Member of the James Madison Council of the Library of Congress, the first-ever national advisory and support group in its 205year history. She also served as a member of the board of Continental Airlines and Frontier Airlines. Mrs. Jorgensen is survived by her sons, Donald and Peter Bren, four Jorgensen children and many grandchildren and great-grandchildren."

Lately, there's the addition of a glittering belt or belts. Some belts have a sparkly skull motif. And when the temperature hit 90, T-shirts and tank tops came off to display sculptured torsos, a contrast with the oversize pants. The look is a good example of fashion born on the street: it has nothing to do with designer influences. If anything, it defies the runway, especially in a season when some designers showed shrunken, tight suits. But just as graffiti made its way from the streets to the galleries, it may one day appear there."

The son of George W. Perkins, the first U.S. Ambassador to N.A.T.O, and Linn Merck Perkins, George grew up in New York City. He graduated from The Hill School early in 1942 so that he could join in the war effort. Because of an eye injury at age 11 he could not enter military service, but instead joined the American Field Service and drove ambulances in Burma throughout the war. He returned afterwards to graduate from the University of Maine in 1949 with a B.S. in Agriculture. In 1950 he married Nancy Foster, whom he met during college, and moved to Millbrook, New York where he raised a grand champion herd of Black Angus cattle until 1979. He was an avid traveler, exploring every continent, and was especially interested in Africa. His travel was curtailed during the last 20 years of his life as his health began to fail, but he never lost his good humor, optimism and love of life. In addition to his wife of 58 years, he is survived by his daughter Jennifer Perkins Speers (and husband Randy), his sisters Penelope P. Wilson and Anne P. Cabot, seven nieces and one nephew.

''I went because a friend of mine had sent this big e-mail around to all his friends last year, saying he wanted to spend New Year's in Timbuktu and then go to a music festival in the desert. And I was the only person that replied 'yes.' So the main aim was to get to the festival in Essakane, about 40 kilometers north of Timbuktu, and travel through Mali for a few weeks to get there. It was amazing. We were there for just under three weeks, and those three days on the boat were the holiday of the trip. It's quite hard work traveling across Africa -- it's pretty basic country. It's all very exciting and you're completely overstimulated everywhere you look, but to sit on a boat for three days and not really have to think about anything or worry about getting on a bus -- it was lovely.''"

Hal graduated from Kent School in 1939 and Harvard College in 1943. After Pearl Harbor, Hal enlisted in the Navy. In the summer of 1941, Hal went to Chappaquiddick Island to visit his Kent and Harvard classmate, Bill Pinney. Bill introduced him to his sister Olive, who for 65 years was the love of Hal's life. They were married on December 2, 1942, the same day he received his naval commission. He served as a Lieutenant on the USS Chauncey from 1942 until 1946 and remained in the Naval Reserves until 1963, retiring as a Commander. After the war, Hal had several careers: shell fisherman, law student, lawyer, divinity student, Episcopal priest and headmaster. Hal and Olive spent every summer on Chappy. They built a summer house, which became their retirement home in 1989. Hal and Olive enjoyed life on Chappy until declining health required them to move to an assisted living facility in Vermont where Olive died from complications of Alzheimer's in 2007. Hal is survived by five children, Ruth, Thomas, Peter, Frank and Lois; 12 grandchildren, five great-grandchildren; two brothers, George and Richard Tilghman, and two sisters, Sally Wardwell and Anne Lyman. A memorial service will be held at St. Andrew's Church in Edgartown, MA on July 25th."
2008-06-22T00:00:00Z,"IN our house, the tenuous relationship between word and deed begins at the top of the cellar stairs. That's because there's a list there, tacked to the wall years ago when we took up residence. Replace basement windows. Pour concrete floor. Repair rotten step. Install shelving. Though nothing but a few words on a scrap of paper, that inventory is a place where an idea became an intention and the intention, a word. And when the word was written down, I was sure it would be the first step toward materiality. But this is the way it tends to go at our house, a place where compulsive list making is given due respect. Whether the issue is how to overhaul the basement or what to buy for dinner, there is a general understanding that enterprise begins on paper, something scribbled on a napkin or the back of an envelope. A grocery list, a to-do list -- any household list is the first thing that gives expression to what you need, and maybe more important, what you want. And while a quick glance into our basement makes it clear that a list is often nothing more than a vague statement of purpose, those assorted scraps of paper still remain a place where it is possible for intent to be introduced to action."
2008-06-22T00:00:00Z,"GREENSPAN--Leon. The man many called ''Dr. Bubala'' passed away at his California home June 15th, at 96. Leon Greenspan, M.D. headed the Children's Division of the Institute of Rehabilitation Medicine at NYU Medical Center after having a pediatric practice in the Bronx. As a professor at the Medical School until his retirement in 1987, Dad was a teacher of science and the qualities that make a doctor a person, a friend, a bubala. Our Dad was one of the first to be board certified in pediatrics and pediatric physical medicine. He set a loving example of hard work, dedication and decency for us as we grew up in New Rochelle. He was the Medical Director at the Human Resources School for Handicapped Children in Albertson, Long Island. He was a national vice president of the Muscular Dystrophy Association of America from 1978-1988, treasurer, then president of the American Academy for Cerebral Palsy and Developmental Medicine 1973-1976 and 1977-1978, respectively, and was appointed to several NYC and State committees where he strove to improve the understanding of the needs of disabled children. He worked with the disabled in India and Venezuela. He has a long list of awards, but the satisfaction he got from helping people was his greatest reward. He graduated from the University of Michigan Medical School in 1937. Dad's beloved wife, Jeanette, our mother, predeceased him in 1984 as have his younger sister and brother, Ruth Hacker and Morton Greenspan. His daughters, Leslie Korngold (Aaron Korngold) of Larchmont, NY, Alison Greenspan (Stanley Mainzer) of Burlingame, CA, and son Avram Greenspan (Sheryl) of San Carlos, CA, and his six grandchildren and grandsonin-law will miss the benefit of his thinking and his love.

But that was not enough to pull NBC ahead among total viewers. According to Nielsen&#8217;s estimates, the women&#8217;s gymnastics contenders put NBC in the lead in the 18-to-49 demographic during the 7 and 8 p.m. hours despite averaging only a modest total audience of 6.2 million. That tally fell short of CBS&#8217;s programming in those time slots: &#8220;60 Minutes&#8221; (8.9 million) followed by &#8220;Million Dollar Password&#8221; (8.3 million), helped CBS edge past NBC for the night in total viewers.

Mr. McEwan, right, known for his many novels including &#8220;Enduring Love&#8221; and &#8220;Atonement,&#8221; made the comments to the Italian newspaper Corriere Della Sera while defending his friend the writer Martin Amis from charges of racism. Mr. Amis has written that people who look as though they are from the Middle East should be strip-searched and possibly deported. Mr. McEwan said, &#8220;As soon as a writer expresses an opinion against Islamism, immediately someone on the left leaps to his feet and claims that because the majority of Muslims are dark skinned, he who criticizes it is racist.&#8221; He added: &#8220;This is logically absurd and morally unacceptable. Martin is not a racist. And I myself despise Islamism, because it wants to create a society that I detest, based on religious belief, on a text, on lack of freedom for women, intolerance towards homosexuality and so on &#151; we know it well.&#8221; He called fundamentalist Christians with similar views &#8220;equally absurd,&#8221; though at least they are not trying to kill people.

2008-06-25T00:00:00Z,"Five sex offenders filed a lawsuit claiming that a tough new state law that bans them from volunteering at churches also robs them of their right to participate in religious worship. The lawsuit, filed in Federal District Court in Rome, says the law effectively “criminalizes fundamental religious activities” for sex offenders and bars them from serving as a choir member, a secretary, an accountant or in any other role with a religious organization. It is the latest of a growing list of legal challenges to Georgia’s sex offender statute, which was hailed by supporters in 2006 as one of the toughest in the nation but has since been the focus of lawsuits contending that it is far too restrictive. The main part of the measure bans sex offenders from living, working or loitering within 1,000 feet of just about anywhere children gather. The original version of the law banned sex offenders from working at churches, but when it was retooled this year supporters added a provision also banning them from volunteering at houses of worship. Doing so could risk a penalty of 10 to 30 years in prison."

InBev will now have to decide whether it will launch a consent solicitation to remove all of the Anheuser directors. This can be done at any time. Alternatively, at the request of 25% of Anheuser's shareholders a special meeting of Anheuser shareholders can be held. So, InBev can also go this route and remove the Anheuser directors at the special meeting if they can get enough shareholder support for it to be called. I suspect that if InBev does attempt to remove and replace the Anheuser directors, InBev will arrange a consent solicitation rather than attempting to call a special meeting: it is quicker."

Basketball executives can only hope that their draft pick manages the transition as well as Amare Stoudemire, whose background didn’t exactly portend smooth sailing. Stoudemire entered the 2002 draft straight out of a high school (he attended six of them) and with a single mom who had been in and out of jail. Even after the Suns drafted him, the team “behaved as if Stoudemire might surface on the police blotter without full-time baby-sitting and remedial input,” Peter de Jonge wrote in “The Leap of His Life” for The Times Magazine. “Seemingly oblivious to all this attention, Stoudemire came in and took care of business, dunking as mercilessly on the heads of N.B.A. All-Stars as he had on overmatched schoolboys...

Just as the victorious politician was a shoo-in in the general election, the winning athlete had already proved herself among the best in the world. Now that the trials have returned to Eugene, by contrast, America has long since ceded domination of distance running to the Africans.

Four telephone bidders vied for the painting, and it ended up selling to one for $29.6 million, far above the high estimate of $19.8 million and a record at auction for the artist. The previous record for a Severini, $3.6 million, was set in 1990 at Sotheby&#8217;s in New York for &#8220;Sea=Dancer.&#8221; The painting sold Wednesday dates from the end of Mr. Severini&#8217;s Futurist period and was later acquired by the Solomon R.

The research, now being examined by the Grabar Art Restoration Institute in Moscow, showed that every 10 concerts above 82 decibels added an extra year to the age of a work because of vibrations.

So he turned to Mary Mashburn, a designer with an office filled with old type just a few blocks away. Ms. Mashburn set the restaurant's name, Woodberry Kitchen, with scratched and nicked wooden type from her collection of antique block types and then printed a copy on her old letterpress. She then scanned the result into her computer, where she tweaked a few letters and adjusted some spacing. A new version of an old font was born."

And there are lots of women in mini skirts; this afternoon I saw a woman in a flaring navy cotton skirt with a red and white striped polo shirt. The best-looking dress at the moment seems to be a dark tunic. I've noticed a lot of the guys in the front row also wearing shorts, especially as a kind of nerd school-boy uniform with knee socks and maybe a pastel vest and a tie.

Pierre was always a gentleman without ceasing to be a gentle man, one whose kindness will be fondly remembered. His many friends will forever miss his presence. We will not cite all of Pierre's international renown and universal respect in the fields of art, fashion and design or list the array of prominent leaders in the political, business and social spheres who availed themselves of Pierre's many talents. Namedropping would have been abhorrent to a man who valued his friendship with everyone. We do not know what epitaphs will mark Pierre's interment in the family plot outside of Paris where he will be laid to rest. The true testament to Pierre is the warmth and love which he inspired in the hearts of the many fortunate enough to have known him throughout his rich and rewarding life.

Among the recent success stories in this vein is World Culture Music, founded by the drummer Kendrick Scott about a year and a half ago.

Steve was a true New Yorker who gave so much to the city and family he loved so well. Born in New York on January 26, 1917 the only child of Selma and Isaac Wolf, he graduated Phi Beta Kappa from New York University in 1937. During World War II, Steve enrolled in the signal intelligence corps, for which he was honored in 1946 with a Legion of Merit for his cryptoanalytic work. Following the war, he turned down a job in Washington with the State Department in order to enter the family firm, S. Wolf's Sons, that had been founded by his grandfather, Simon, in 1869. The business was the oldest paint and wallcovering store in the city, and Steve was named its president in 1953, remaining so until 1987, when he sold the firm. Steve made a passion out of his vocation, amassing one of the leading collections of books on paint and color theory in the country, with volumes dating to the 1600s. Always involved in the world at large, Steve was at various times president of the Ninth Avenue Association, president of the board of directors of the Metropolitan Historic Structures Association, chairman of the West Side Highway committee, twice chairman of Community Planning Board number 4 on Manhattan's West Side, vice-chairman of the board of managers of the McBurney School, and a board member of the Hartley House community center, from whom he received a founder's award in 2004.

Louise, born August 2, 1944, in Columbia, SC, was the beloved wife of Fred, and the mother of Jacob Halper of New York City and Reuben Halper of San Francisco. Louise was a Professor of Law, and Director of the Frances Lewis Law Center at Washington and Lee University in Lexington, VA. Louise'slong career as an activist for social justice began when she was a teenager in Tulsa, Oklahoma, where she participated in sit-ins protesting segregation. She continued her activism while pursuing her B.A. at Brandeis University. From there, she went on to earn her M.A. from RutgersNew Brunswick, and in 1973, her J.D. from Rutgers-Newark Law School. What followed was a distinguished 15year career in public interest law, during which she argued in state and federal courts, and in the United States Supreme Court. Louise worked closely with Morton Stavis, a founder of the Center for Constitutional Rights, and as Assistant Attorney General of New York, focused her energies on environmental justice. Following her years of legal practice, and while earning her L.L.M. from New York University, Louise began teaching, a field in which she earned the respect and admiration of colleagues and students alike. She began her teaching career at NYU Law School, moving from there to Washington & Lee University, where she taught property, jurisprudence, critical legal theory, and environmental law. During her 17-year academic career, she published and traveled widely and held many distinguished visiting positions at institutions in the U.S. and worldwide. She was a visiting Professor at Seton Hall University. As a Fulbright Fellow, she taught at Marmara University in Istanbul. Years later, she was a visiting scholar at Koc University, also in Istanbul. She taught at The American University in Cairo, and spent a year as a visiting Professor at Harvard Law School. In 2005, she spent part of her sabbatical in Iran, speaking on law and gender in Islamic societies. As a deeply loved wife, mother, sister, friend and mentor, Louise touched the lives of so many. She was an insightful observer of people who displayed an extraordinary curiosity and interest in the world. Her expansive intellect was matched only by her unbounded consideration and love for her family and friends. They, her colleagues and students, will remember her not just for her considerable academic and professional triumphs, but also for her warmth, kindness, wit, and humor. A memorial service will be held on Sunday, June 29 (1-5pm) at NYU School Of Law, Vanderbilt Hall, Greenberg Lounge, 40 Washington Square South, NYC.

Since then, Giambi is hitting .322 and seems look a good bet to be picked for the All-Star team and perhaps compete in the Home Run Derby. I asked Giambi about those possibilities for Sunday's Times and he used words like ""cool"" and ""awesome"" to describe how he would feel if he was selected. As Giambi's average deteriorated, he said that Long had told him to stop worrying about statistics. Instead, Long told Giambi to analyze each individual at-bat. ""At the end of the game, we'd go in there and we'd line them up,"" Giambi said. ""He would be like, 'Awesome, three out of four at-bats, a line drive or a hard-hit ball.' That's how we were breaking it down. He was like: 'Look at it, you're doing great. I know the numbers don't show it, but you are.' He told me to just keep doing the same things and I'd start to get out of this."" Long was right. Giambi, who seemed lost in May, is a productive hitter again."

My seat on a September trip to Tampa costs $94; to take my 12-pound miniature schnauzer in a carry-on bag, crammed under the seat in front of me, I must forgo the legroom, forgo carrying another carry-on bag, and pay $100.

''This was a Christian mission trip, sponsored by the Christian Medical and Dental Association. We traveled to several poor villages, and we saw so much hopelessness because there are no jobs and the fathers or mothers have to go to another country to work for a few months at a time. We listened to them and prayed with each one, and they seemed to be comforted that someone cared. When the picture was taken, we were on a tour of Chisinau, and we were in a very old Russian Orthodox church. I remember thinking that all the beautiful icons, paintings and other antique things in the church were beautiful and old, but also that it all seemed a waste of money. I thought of all the 'stuff' we were looking at and thought that really, God is simple and seen in creation, not in what our hands can make. We plan to go back, hopefully next year, because we love the people of Moldova and realize that we can offer them hope.''"

First, the companies filed a letter with the F.C.C. outlining voluntary commitments the operators would agree to should the merger be approved. Then the F.C.C. chairman, Kevin J. Martin, issued a statement that the conditions outlined by the companies would, in his opinion, satisfy the requirement of being in the public interest.

''They're rare and timeless,'' he said. Now the eyewear connoisseur has introduced a line inspired by such classics but redesigned to look bolder and fit better. Best sellers include Kayne, a take on a vintage Persol pair, punched up with clear frames and gradient lenses; and Nicole, based on a preppy '80s version of those worn in ''Breakfast at Tiffany's.''

2008-06-29T00:00:00Z,"I fell for choux paste, a k a cream-puff dough, early in my cooking career. At one of my first restaurant jobs, creating pretty slices for our cheese-plate service left the kitchen with countless dismal little ends of cheese. (We cooks called them cheese butts.) Choux (pronounced SHOO) paste proved the perfect home for the orphaned bits of Boucheron, Roquefort and cheddar. The cheeses would be stirred into the paste, which then was shaped into neat quenelles and fried into beignets; crisp on the exterior, oozy and fragrant on the interior. From near garbage came near perfection, all thanks to a strange, decidedly old-fashioned dough. There's something about choux paste that is both gleefully absurd and a little bit miraculous. First, there's its preparation, which seems to defy pastry logic. You cook a paste of water, butter and flour over the stove and then furiously beat eggs into the still-steaming ball of dough. At various moments, the choux looks like an unredeemable mess, but with continued stirring, it comes together into a glossy, golden paste. When baked, it inflates into gloriously hollow little balls, perfect for filling. It's no wonder choux paste inspires goofy desserts like the towering, pyramidal croquembouche, the bicycle-tire-shaped Paris-Brest and that banquet standby, choux-paste swans."

''Show me the person that wouldn't look like a giant toddler in them.'' Even Harper's Bazaar is having trouble swallowing the saggy-pants pill. In this month's issue it reported that pants for fall were an odd-looking lot but that the ''clear-cut winner for weirdness was the drop-crotch trouser.'' So why are chic women like Diane Kruger, Naomi Campbell and Emmanuelle Alt of French Vogue wearing them? And why are they all over the fall runways, not to mention the winter resort collections? ''Because it's fresh,'' said Nevena Borissova, the owner of the SoHo boutique Curve, where a healthy stock of Isabel Marant dropped-crotch pants (the originator of the trend, some say) have nearly sold out. ''In Paris last fashion season, all the French women were wearing them, while all the Americans were in tight jeans.''"

In Mexico City, it furnished an abandoned house, dangling clothes from the door frames. In Werkleitz, Germany, it planted its wares in specialty shops: bedsheets printed with a sleeping couple were put in a linen store; a hairbrush that sprouted blond tresses was displayed at a cosmetics shop. ''It made everything look especially cuckoo,'' recalled Desiree Heiss, who, along with Ines Kaag, are the Bless masterminds. Now, for the first time in eight years, the two have returned to New York to present an exhibition and pop-up shop at the new art space Ludlow 38. Inspired by its architecture, they created 10 steplike boxes, each packed according to a different theme. One is filled with their favorite designs, another with found items. Each box will be sold as a whole. ''The point is not to create a sale situation,'' Ms. Heiss said, ''but to show our whole universe and the things we believe in.''"

''I thought I'd be able to learn it, but I've given up,'' Ms. Harris, 61, said. No matter. On ''All I Intended to Be'' (Nonesuch) she sings the type of dazzling harmonies and arrangements that won her all those awards, accompanied by a new quintet that includes someone who plays the instrument that has so far eluded her grasp. Apparently the sound has taken root. Released on June 10, ''Intended'' is her highest ranking album, reaching No. 4 on Billboard's country charts and No. 22 on the main chart. As she took in the hackberry, maple, magnolia and oak trees near her Nashville home during a break from her tour, Ms. Harris spoke with Winter Miller about what she's listening to now.

But how to freshly document the life of a man who was his own Boswell, whose books and articles slavishly documented his own every tic, whoop and hallucination?

2008-06-29T00:00:00Z,"Because the archetypal women in Daphne Guinness's short film, ''The Phenomenology of Body,'' revolve on turntables, it is somehow easier to think of her as a D.J. than as a director. Because the chic images she assembled appear in some sense random, it seems appropriate to think of her as more a sampler than any kind of auteur. And because the story depicting women through the ages is, as its creator points out, not exactly linear and only accidentally feminist, it is easy to see in it hints of autobiography, the personal history of a slightly anachronistic sort of being, less actor than spectator, a woman upon whom the events of life impress themselves. While few outside the style world are likely to have heard of Guinness, she exercises considerable fascination in fashionable circles and the tabloid press. The daughter of the Guinness brewery heir Jonathan Guinness, formally known as Lord Moyne, Guinness is also the step-granddaughter of Sir Oswald Mosley, the British fascist; the ex-wife of Spyros Niarchos, of Greek shipping fame (she married him at 19; he settled a reputed $40 million dollars on her when they divorced in 1999); and lately the subject of tabloid rumors related to her friendship with Bernard-Henri Lévy, the wealthy, and married, French writer whose intellect is almost as celebrated as his luxuriant head of hair."

2008-06-30T00:00:00Z,"O'CONNELL--Francis (Frank) A., died in Grass Valley, CA on June 29, 2008, at age 94. Born on the Upper East Side of Manhattan and raised in the Bronx, he remained a New Yorker at heart despite spending his final thirty-five years in northern California. He graduated from St. Nicholas of Tolentine in the Bronx and Fordham Law before WWII and practiced labor law at Cravath, Swain and Moore. He enlisted during WWII and served in Australia as a cryptographer. After the war he returned to Cravath, and then worked as a labor relations attorney in private industry. He went back in the Army for the Korean war, as a Captain in Anna Rosenbergs labor office in the Department of Defense. Afterwards, he returned to corporate labor law, retiring from Olin in 1977 as V.P. of Industrial Relations. He was widely recognized as a proponent of employer prerogatives in labor relations, building on the thinking of Boulware and other corporate employee relations leaders before him. Before retiring, he worked with John M. Olin to transform the Olin Foundation into a powerful and well-endowed underwriter of ideas. O'Connell then ran the Foundation before again retiring in 1982. He was an ardent free market conservative who served on the board of National Review with his friend William F. Buckley. His first wife, Alice (Costuma), daughter of a New York City Deputy Police Chief, died a few years after their marriage. He was then married to Mary (Reinhart) who lives in California. His third wife, Marjorie (Furry), with whom he had a daughter, Anne, is deceased. His fourth wife, Kathryn (Beitsch Grant), who he married in 1964, passed away in 1969. He has been a loving parent to her sons Arthur Grant, William Grant and Anthony Grant for 44 years. He married Eleanor (Tremoreux) in 1971 and she survives him, as does Anne, Arthur, William and Anthony and their families."

A muscular, middle-aged man huffed away at the pedals and a thin woman with a floral headscarf sat in the back like some visiting dignitary, but with what looked like a sack of groceries beside her. It looked nothing at all like an official pedicab you’d see in Manhattan, and the woman was no tourist.I cranked the wheel around like the star of some cop movie and gave chase, losing him on a one-way street, finding him later parked outside a building. Maybe it was too much like a movie. I hopped out of the company Grand Am, and you could tell the pedicab driver was thinking: cop."

Doubling the holdings of 78s at the university’s Belfer Audio Laboratory and Archive, the collection of more than 200,000 records was donated by the family of Morton J. Savada, who ran the Records Revisited store on West 33rd Street in Manhattan for 29 years and died in February. Particularly strong in jazz and big bands, the Savada collection contains a wide swath of popular music from the first half of the 20th century, with country, blues, gospel, polka, folk, Broadway and Hawaiian music. It also has a strong selection of V-Disc records, which were produced for American military personnel overseas in the 1940s. Now in transit in 1,300 boxes, the collection will be cataloged once it reaches Syracuse, said Suzanne Thorin, the dean of libraries."
2008-07-02T00:00:00Z,"With its presentation of “Die Meistersinger von Nürnberg” this month, the annual Bayreuth festival in Germany, which celebrates the music of its founder, Richard Wagner, will offer streaming video and audio live on the Internet for $77, The Associated Press reported. Organizers said they hoped the online broadcast would draw new audiences to the festival, where tickets are so scarce that fans can wait seven years or more for the chance to buy them. “Those are complicated hoops,” said Katharina Wagner, a great-granddaughter of the composer, whose new staging of “Die Meistersinger,” above, had its premiere last summer. “But for those who only know Bayreuth by name, maybe they will say, ‘O.K., I’ll check it out if I can watch it at home on my laptop.’ ” The Metropolitan Opera in New York and La Scala in Milan have offered high-definition video at movie theaters, but at prices closer to $24. Alexander Busche, Bayreuth’s spokesman, said the price would offset the cost of filming and purchasing media rights. The premiere is on July 27; the video will be available for paid download at bayreuther-festspiele.de through Aug. 2."

According to Nielsen’s estimates, 7.3 million viewers tuned in to “The Bachelorette,” putting ABC in the lead at 8 p.m. ahead of Fox’s “Bones” (6.7 million). At 9 p.m., a special “Men Tell All” episode of the dating show also fared well, winning its time slot among adults 18 to 49 despite trailing in total viewers (7.5 million) behind Fox’s “House” (8.1 million) and CBS’s sitcom reruns, including “Two and a Half Men” from 9 to 9:30 (8.4 million). Fox won the night in total viewers, and ABC and CBS tied for the lead among the 18-to-49 set. ABC might have won the night outright had it not lagged far behind with “The Mole” (3.9 million) at 10 p.m., a time slot CBS dominated with a repeat of “CSI: Miami” (8.1 million)."

In the interview the two Beatles discuss their success, how they write songs and how they met as teenagers. “I was playing at a garden fete in the village where I lived just outside Liverpool playing with a skiffle group,” Lennon says. “And he came along, and that’s how we met.”."

Terry Lang joined The Rockefeller University Council in 1984 and was elected to the Board in 1986. She was named an honorary member of the staff of The Rockefeller University Hospital, in recognition of her leadership as chairman of the Board's Hospital Committee. The Theresa and Eugene M. Lang Professorship, which Terry's beloved husband established in her honor, reflects their shared passion for scientific inquiry and belief that basic research can provide answers to the unsolved questions of human health and disease. Terry will be remembered for her numerous philanthropic and pro bono activities, including her service to hospital patients and their families as a volunteer in several New York medical institutions. She put into action her conviction that there is a natural kinship between biomedical science and medical care, and that each has much to learn from the other. As a philanthropist, as a knowledgeable advocate for physicians and their patients, as a dedicated trustee, and as an exemplary wife and mother, Terry made the world a better place. She will be greatly missed. Our deepest condolences are sent to Gene; their children, Jane, David, and Stephen; and her entire family.

She joined the hospital's Women's Auxiliary, became its president and since 1975, a hospital Trustee. This lifetime relationship is memorialized by the NYH-Q's Theresa Lang Emergency Pediatric Clinic, Ambulatory Pediatric Clinic, Auditorium and Center for Research and Education. In 1975, Terry joined the New York City Visiting Committee of the United Hospital fund, became its chair and, in 2008, was named Hospital Trustee of the Year.
