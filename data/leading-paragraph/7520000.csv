They won’t benefit from the smokiness of charcoal, but will still have plenty of tangy, complex, fruity flavor from the glaze. It’s a dish worth making. To do so, preheat your oven to 450 degrees and spread the chicken thighs on a baking pan. Roast, turning once, until brown, crisp-skinned and cooked through, 25 to 35 minutes. Then follow the rest of the recipe from that point and dig in."

For Berlin, Simons selected a group of artists who are inspired by the city but who are not necessarily based here, including the graphic designer Peter Saville, the industrial designer Konstantin Grcic, the Scottish dancer and choreographer Michael Clark, the British writer Jo-Ann Furniss, These New Puritans (a band from Southend-on-Sea), the Belgian artist Peter de Potter and New York’s very own Fischerspooner. “Transmission” also features a sampling of Simons’s favorite horror films. The show is physically situated in the Berlin Congress Center, with events running from noon to midnight. Theavantgardediaries.com, a digital magazine, will broadcast the key events for non-Berliners and introduce readers to the artists involved. Simons sat down with The Moment just hours before the opening to discuss Berlin’s significance as a contemporary creative hub.Q.How many cities will be involved in this project?"

2011-07-15T10:00:11Z,"All too often, the jewelry that we see at fashion shows makes it only to the end of the runway and back. Thankfully, the owl pin designed by Alexis Bittar for Jason Wu — the one that adorned Wu’s fall peacoats and blazers — is very much real and ours for the buying, arriving in stores on Friday. Fans will recognize the owl, a k a Miss Wu, the designer’s muse and logo (“perhaps because of too many late nights sketching,” Wu says), and also appreciate Bittar’s gutsy take on it. Inspired by the photographer Robert Polidori’s book on the restoration of Versailles, “Parcours Museologique Reviste” (Steidl), the two fell hard for the contrast between grand décor and raw metals. “I love the juxtaposition,” says Wu, who calls his fall collection Baroque Sportswear. “The piece combines opulence with early ’90s grunge,” Bittar says. “And a sense of raw romanticism,” Wu adds. “A perfect complement to the clothes.”"

2011-07-15T08:00:17Z,"The Travel Almanac, the newest of a growing crop of compact niche magazines (see: Apartamento, Boat and Afterzine), looks at the art of travel through the perspectives of artists, musicians, writers and filmmakers who are well, well-traveled. The journal was founded two years ago by Paul Kominek, a musician and sometime D.J. from Germany, with the help of his friend John Roberts, an American musician who, like Kominek, lives in Berlin. “By using the topic of traveling as an overarching theme, it gave us an amazing excuse to ask high-profile artists or cultural icons questions that avoid the obligatory ‘What do you do?’ and ‘How did you get started?’ and instead ask about different aspects of their lives that we personally find more interesting,” says Kominek. The first volume, on Japan, debuted this spring. The cover is printed on textured German cardstock, the interior pages on creamy Swedish drawing paper. It features tips from the likes of David Lynch, James Murphy and Javier Peres, as well as some handsome photographs of traditional Japanese inns, called “ryokans.” T turned the tables on Kominek and asked for his own travel preferences, and his Berlin mainstays."

And it certainly applies to the theater production ''Play Dead,'' which posts a warning in the lobby that ''children should not attend without the knowledge and permission of their parents.'' Nevertheless, ''Play Dead'' has recently devised a familyfriendly matinee. So how friendly is it? If your child is under 12, afraid of the dark or prone to nightmares, don't even think about it. But if you have a jaded middle school or high school student who sneers at the very idea of a magic show, then get thee to the phone, Web or box office immediately: ''Play Dead'' closes on July 24. The show comes across like a séance conducted by a charming and mellifluously voiced psychopath. He is Todd Robbins, who wrote the piece with its director, Teller (of Penn & Teller). Mr. Robbins, above, who warms up his audience by noisily eating a light bulb, performs on a stage holding many cardboard file boxes and one large, coffin-shaped vat, which will at one point contain a theatergoer. He promises ''an afternoon of spooky amusement,'' and boy, does he deliver. Each box, he notes, is a kind of coffin, containing not mortal remains but memorabilia related to real dead people. With the exception of an unfortunate friend of Mr. Robbins's, they make up a most unpleasant lot, including unscrupulous psychics and a murderer of children. (As I said, don't take little ones.)"

2011-07-15T00:00:00Z,"For the last three seasons, the Red Sox, the Yankees and the Rays have jockeyed among themselves for the American League East title and the A.L.'s wild-card berth, with each team missing the playoffs once. In 2011, these three teams are again atop the East, with the Red Sox leading at the All-Star Game break and the Rays having the most ground to make up. With the trading deadline just a little over two weeks away, playoff contenders will most likely start making moves to upgrade their rosters. To better understand what moves they need to make, I look to how teams have performed batting, pitching and on defense. A variety of techniques are used to quantify these performances, but all are denoted in runs and all are compared with the major league average."

2011-07-15T00:00:00Z,"SANDWICH, England - In his 34th British Open, Tom Watson finally got to play with a namesake, and the namesake beat him - at least on Thursday - by seven strokes. ''Tom Lewis, how about that?'' Watson said. ''He could be my grandson.'' Lewis, the 20-year-old British amateur who has a share of the lead with Thomas Bjorn, is 41 years younger than Watson. He showed him plenty of deference before, during and after the first round. ''To play with Tom, no matter what I shot, was going to be excellent,'' Lewis said. ''I was more not wanting to embarrass myself in front of him.'' Lewis accomplished that and much more with his stunning 65. ''He's quite a refined player at age 20,'' Watson said. ''We certainly have a new young breed out here, don't we? We've got the McIlroys and the Ishikawas and the Lewises. We have a lot of young players playing very good golf.'' Unlike Rory McIlroy, the 22-year-old from Northern Ireland, and Ryo Ishikawa, the 19-year-old Japanese star, Lewis is not yet a professional, although he has been a full-time golfer since age 16."

2011-07-15T00:00:00Z,"The American culture war, that combustible, stupefying cocktail of religion, sex, politics and everything else that gets people hot and bothered, represents a rich vein of satiric and dramatic potential. George Ratliff's ''Salvation Boulevard,'' adapted from a novel by Larry Beinhart (''Wag the Dog''), suggests that it may sometimes be too rich. The movie, set in and around a Sun Belt megachurch with a charismatic pastor, is a console full of jammed and disconnected hot buttons. The exceptional cast does what it can to keep things jumping and grounded, as the tone wobbles from intrigue to farce and back. Pierce Brosnan, as Pastor Dan, who is trying to leverage his spiritual juice into lucrative real estate, has a hearty, sly allure that steers almost entirely clear of caricature. And the best thing about ''Salvation Boulevard'' is its avoidance of condescending stereotypes. Mr. Ratliff, whose earlier films include the documentary ''Hell House,'' is happy to let his fish swim free of their barrel."

The Staedel Museum, where the painting has been displayed since 2003 on long-term loan, said in a statement that it had tried to buy the work itself, but that its offer of 40 million euros ($57 million) was rejected. Christoph Graf Douglas, the art dealer who handled the sale, would not give the final purchase price but said it was more than 50 million euros. The painting, ''The Madonna With the Family of Mayor Meyer,'' from 1525-28, depicts the mayor of Basel's family--to whom it belonged for nearly 100 years--at the feet of the Madonna.

2011-07-16T00:00:00Z,"The economy is still suffering from the worst financial crisis since the Depression, and widespread anger persists that financial institutions that caused it received bailouts of billions of taxpayer dollars and haven't been held accountable for any wrongdoing. Yet the House Appropriations Committee has responded by starving the agency responsible for bringing financial wrongdoers to justice -- while putting over $200 million that could otherwise have been spent on investigations and enforcement actions back into the pockets of Wall Street. A few weeks ago, the Republican-controlled appropriations committee cut the Securities and Exchange Commission's fiscal 2012 budget request by $222.5 million, to $1.19 billion (the same as this year's), even though the S.E.C.'s responsibilities were vastly expanded under the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act. Charged with protecting investors and policing markets, the S.E.C. is the nation's front-line defense against financial fraud. The committee's accompanying report referred to the agency's ''troubled past'' and ''lack of ability to manage funds,'' and said the committee ''remains concerned with the S.E.C.'s track record in dealing with Ponzi schemes.'' The report stressed, ''With the federal debt exceeding $14 trillion, the committee is committed to reducing the cost and size of government.''"
2011-07-16T00:00:00Z,"Commercial theater producers seeking to make money off Shakespeare usually stick to tried-and-true audience draws like ''Hamlet'' or ''Macbeth,'' but even those can be financially risky without a celebrity in the title role. (Last season's critically acclaimed ''Merchant of Venice,'' starring Al Pacino, narrowly turned a profit.) Next month, however, a group of commercial producers will try to make a go of ''Cymbeline,'' one of Shakespeare's trickier tragic romances - though with a staging that received strong notices from critics this winter. Fiasco Theater's highly inventive production, featuring six actors in 14 roles and an imaginative set that relied on just two crates, a sheet and a trunk serving many purposes, will begin an 18-week run on Aug. 27 at the Barrow Street Theater. The nonprofit Theater for a New Audience, which presented the earlier, noncommercial production of ''Cymbeline,'' is now undertaking the first commercial run of a Shakespeare play in an Off Broadway house in its 32-year history."

2011-07-16T00:00:00Z,"I am pressing against a secure wall, not daring to step away. The wind is whipping against me -- or is it howling? My feet feel rubbery on the narrow walkway. I think of those balconies on the upper floors of colonial homes in old ports, where pacing wives would gaze out to sea, seeking the long-overdue ships of sailor husbands: widows' walks. If this particular walk were open to an anxiously pacing public, I can only imagine how many new widows and widowers would be left behind. But I look out, and the vision is literally breathtaking, the Hudson shimmering in the west, and a patch of green off to the north -- Central Park -- lying just beyond some half-hearted high-rises. I am standing a floor above the highest observation deck of the Empire State Building just outside a room with cables and communications equipment. The walkway circles around the building's narrow spire, which, in 1930, was envisioned as a mooring mast for dirigibles; as it turned out, only King Kong ever reliably used it for support."

2011-07-16T00:00:00Z,"Two more members of the board of New York City Opera have resigned in the wake of the company's departure from Lincoln Center and artistic changes. Jonathan Sheffer, a conductor and composer who had been a trustee for two years, said on Friday he stepped down 10 days ago, but not because of the move. ''I really felt at odds with the company's artistic direction,'' he said, adding that it had ''broken faith with the audience.'' The general and artistic director, George Steel, has been criticized by some for neglecting more traditional productions in favor of the offbeat. Mr. Sheffer, the former music director of the Eos Orchestra in New York and a group in Cleveland known as Red 3/5an orchestra 4/5, said he still had ''enormous respect and admiration for Mr. Steel.'' Roy L. Furman, an investment banker and theater producer, has also resigned, Mr. Sheffer said. Mr. Furman did not immediately return messages; nor did a City Opera spokeswoman. The soprano Joyce Castle stepped down last month, citing opposition to the move."

2011-07-16T00:00:00Z,"8 P.M. (TCM) THE ESSENTIALS: CLARK GABLE IN COLOR Robert Osborne and Alec Baldwin explain why this lineup is required viewing, beginning with ''The Misfits'' (1961), which stars Marilyn Monroe (below, with Clark Gable) as Roslyn Taber, a freshly divorced showgirl, and Gable as Gay Langland, a ruggedly independent cowboy intent on joining an auto mechanic (Eli Wallach) and a rodeo performer (Montgomery Clift) in a plan to rope mustangs -- known as misfits, because they're too small for riding -- in the Nevada desert and sell them for dog food. Directed by John Huston and written by Arthur Miller, the film is considered a pioneer in the evolution of the American western, with its more contemporary, bleaker outlook. ''Westerns and the West have always been built on a morally balanced world where evil has a recognizable tab -- the black hats -- and evil always loses out in the end,'' Miller wrote. ''This is that same world, but it's been dragged out of the 19th century into today, when the good guy is also part of the problem.'' Among the movie's memorable lines: Gay's declaration that ''the man who's too afraid to die is too afraid to live.'' (Gable died just weeks after completing the film.) The evening continues into the wee hours with Gable as a big-game hunter in Kenya in ''Mogambo'' (1953), at 10:15; a slave owner in ''Band of Angels'' (1957), at 12:15 a.m.; a Dutch intelligence officer in ''Betrayed'' (1954), at 2:30; and a con man who seduces widows in ''The King and Four Queens'' (1956), at 4:30.

While Mr. Manso wrote that the district attorney came to be perceived as a ''wacko'' and ''the DA who couldn't keep his zipper shut,'' he did not call him those things himself. And a correction in this space on Friday referred incorrectly to the district attorney's role in the trial. While his office handled the case, the trial prosecutor was an assistant district attorney, not the district attorney."

Models with feather headdresses and backless dresses reclined face down on settees in the Jacob Astor library. Their backs served as canvases for a Dalí look-alike with a protrusion of wiry chest hair, who painted phrases like ''There is no frigate like a book to take us lands away'' (Emily Dickinson) on their bare skin. Apparently Dalí had pulled a similar party trick when he lived here with his wife and pet ocelot."

2011-07-17T00:00:00Z,"DELACORTE--Valerie Pascal, (1919 2011) passed away on July 14th at her home in Palm Beach Gardens, FL. Valerie was the devoted wife of the late George T. Delacorte, founder of Dell Publishing Company and a well known New York and Florida philanthropist. Valerie was born in Budapest, Hungary and educated at the Ursuline Convent. Graced with stunning beauty, intellect and elegant style, Valerie became a stage and film actress in Hungary under the name Hidveghy Valeria. Valerie's earlier marriage was to Gabriel Pascal, Hollywood's renowned film producer of George Bernard Shaw's plays, including ""Major Barbara"", ""Caesar"" and ""Cleopatra"" and it was Pascal's idea to turn ""Pygmalion"" into a musical which became a reality as ""My Fair Lady"" after Pascal's death in 1954. Valerie authored a memoir entitled, ""The Disciple and His Devil,"" to reveal an extraordinarily close view of Shaw and Pascal, and their charged, creative success. Valerie's glamorous, high-profile love and heartache with Pascal, included socializing with the legendary figures Vivien Leigh and Rex Harrison. McGraw Hill published Valerie's memoir in 1970; Michael Joseph re-published the book in England in 1972; IUniverse re-issued it in 2004; and, in 2008 the book was translated and published in Hungary. Valerie donated the voluminous Shaw-Pascal correspondence to Boston University. Valerie and George greatly enjoyed their life together in New York, Florida and Connecticut, traveling, collecting art, and taking pride in the many gifts George gave to New York City, in particular, the Delacorte Musical Clock, Alice in Wonderland Statue and the Delacorte Shakespeare Amphitheatre, all in Central Park. George was a major benefactor of Columbia University, and established the Delacorte Center for Magazine Journalism. Following George's death in 1991, Valerie served as a Trustee of the Center until 2001. In honor of her beloved husband, George, Valerie contributed their vast art collection of Old Masters to the Norton Museum of Art in Florida. Valerie was a devout Catholic, and her faith defined her journey through life, and inspired her friendships and charitable commitments to the poor and homeless and to other philanthropies. The Funeral Service and Christian Mass will be offered at 10am on Monday, August 8th at St. Ignatius Loyola, 980 Park Avenue at 84th Street, followed by her burial to rest in eternal peace in the Delacorte Mausoleum at Woodlawn Cemetery, Webster Avenue & East 233rd Street, Bronx, NY.

2011-07-17T00:00:00Z,"9 P.M. (13, 49) ZEN Rufus Sewell, above, stars as Detective Aurelio Zen, an honest cop in modern-day Italy whose superiors are on the side of the lawbreakers in this ''Masterpiece Mystery!'' adaptation of the novels by Michael Dibdin. In ''Vendetta,'' the first of three installments, a frazzled Zen, 40 years old, separated from his wife and living with his mother, finds himself ducking a killer on a rampage against those he believed wrongly imprisoned him, while grappling with a politically charged murder -- never mind the affections of his office mate Tania Moretti (Caterina Murino). ''There is nothing of the morose in this trilogy, which makes it a welcome antidote to the craze for the grimness and melancholy of the unstoppably popular Scandinavian crime genre,'' Ginia Bellafante wrote of the series in The New York Times. ''The films deploy a light comic sensibility and graphics that suggest a '60s caper. They situate us in a Rome where the weather always seems heavenly, blouses are always unbuttoned suggestively, and no lunch transpires without multiple courses and repeated instances of sexual innuendo. Risotto is eaten; cigarettes are smoked; espresso is consumed; public displays of lust are evident. There is little resistance to cliché in all this, but the cliché is so visually appealing that you'll feel like a spoiled child if you complain. And you're given such a treat that you'll also feel like one, begging for more.'' 10 A.M.

2011-07-17T00:00:00Z,"TWENTY years after the breakup of the Soviet Union, the wave of nostalgia for the good old days of Communism peaks with the opening of ''Ostalgia,'' an exhibition at the New Museum curated by Massimilliano Gioni. Among the artists represented in the show is Nikolay Bakharev, who was born in Siberia in 1946 and worked as a photographer for the Communal Services Factory in Novokuznetsk. On the side, he took photographs of ordinary folks on the beach (one of the few places they could bare their bodies beyond the watchful gaze of Big Brother) and offered the pictures for sale to the subjects. For Mr. Bakharev, it was an exercise that tested the limits of private, and creative, enterprise under a regime that frowned upon both. In his intimate and casually charming portraits, photographer and subject are complicit in this small taste of freedom -- and clearly relishing it. ALIX BROWNE"
2011-07-17T00:00:00Z,"SANDWICH, ENGLAND - An amateur who shoots a 65 in his first British Open round, makes the cut with ease and draws praise from none other than Tom Watson should be a lock for the silver medal awarded to the tournament's leading amateur. Not so fast. Tom Lewis, the 20-year-old Englishman in question, followed up that 65 with a 74 and a 76, and he is now just two shots in front of the American Peter Uihlein, the only other amateur still in the tournament. Lewis is at five-over par with one round to play; Uihlein, the reigning United States amateur champion, is at seven over after following two 71s with a third-round 75 to sit tied for 41st. Uihlein, like Lewis, has strong family connections to golf. Lewis's father is a golf professional. Uihlein's father, Wally, is the chairman and chief executive of the Acushnet Company, which includes the golf brands Titleist and FootJoy. ''Well, Peter is a great player, so no matter what happens tomorrow, hopefully I can play well, and if I don't win, then I don't win,'' Lewis said. ''He deserves whatever he gets. Hopefully I can win some bigger trophies in my career.'' Uihlein, a 21-year-old all-American golfer from Oklahoma State, missed the cut at the Masters and the United States Open this year, but he is playing on the weekend at this major. The conversation has shifted quickly here at Royal St. George's. On Thursday, it seemed like the early results were confirmation of Europe's increased domination of the game and Lewis's glittering 65 a big hint that the good times would keep right on rolling. But the Americans have struck back and now have 10 players in the top 16 heading into Sunday, and Uihlein now has a chance to snatch the silver medal for the United States, too."

2011-07-17T00:00:00Z,"THE work of Carl Andre, one of the only Minimalists to accept the term, is often as barely there as sculpture can get. In the first book to survey his ascetic half-century career, a maximalist doorstop published this month by Phaidon, the art historian Alistair Rider relates the story of a German artist who enthusiastically sought out Mr. Andre's work at a gallery in 1967, only to become confused when he couldn't find it. This was because the work, 100 square plates of hot-rolled steel arranged in a rectangle almost completely covering the gallery entryway, was directly beneath his feet. He had mistaken it for the flooring, a mistake that comes with the territory in Andre country, where art -- as Mr. Andre has said -- gets perilously ''close to zero,'' meant to be experienced as much with the body as with the eyes and mind. For more than two decades Mr. Andre, who turns 76 this year, has been almost as spectral a presence in the art world as his most inconspicuous floor pieces. He has shown regularly, at the Paula Cooper Gallery in New York and around the world, but he rarely appears in public and speaks for the record even less than he did when he was young, which was not a lot. So it was disconcerting to meet him one recent afternoon in the hallway outside his Greenwich Village apartment, where he was waiting on the other side of the elevator door; he smiled, stuck out his hand and said, ''Hi, I'm Carl Andre,'' pronouncing his last name with a flat ''a,'' in contrast to the broad ''a'' (''bahthtub,'' ''auhnt'') he carries conspicuously from his youth in Quincy, Mass."

2011-07-17T00:00:00Z,"Shortly after Candace Keshwar immigrated from Trinidad to Boston in 2002, her life took a difficult turn. Her dream had been to go to college and have a career where she could help others. But her first daughter was born with cerebral palsy and Keshwar spent the next seven years caring for her at home. She grew isolated. Her husband worked in construction, but jobs were sporadic, and the family relied on government assistance. ''It was a real dark space for me,'' Keshwar said. ''I kept thinking, 'This cannot be my life. I know I have the potential to do so much more.''' A turning point came when Keshwar was asked to join a group of families who had self-organized as part of an initiative that helps people in low-income communities achieve their goals. Called the Family Independence Initiative (FII), its approach is radically different from the American social service model. Although it is still quite small - working with a few hundred families - its results are so striking that the White House has taken notice. What FII does is create a structure for families that encourages the sense of control, desire for self-determination, and mutual support that have characterized the collective rise out of poverty for countless communities in American history.FII is not a ''program'' in a traditional sense. It doesn't seek to implement changes, but to elicit them from others. It was launched as a research project by Maurice Lim Miller in Oakland in 2001. Lim Miller, whose mother was an immigrant from Mexico who worked multiple jobs to support her children, had previously spent 22 years building Asian Neighborhood Design, a youth development and job training program, for which he was honored by President Clinton during the 1999 State of the Union address."

2011-07-17T00:00:00Z,"CIESINSKI--Roman Anthony. 1921-2011. Delaware Sports Hall of Famer, Roman Anthony Ciesinski of Hockessin, Delaware, the only Track and Field Coach so honored, died Friday, June 10, 2011 at home, of heart failure following a long illness. Five days before his passing, the United States Veterans Administration awarded him the Order of the Purple Heart with Oak Clusters, the Prisoner of War Medal, and the Bronze Star for services rendered in World War II, 67 years earlier. He was 89. A Detroit native who worked in the Timken Axel Defense Plant before joining the Army, he was captured in France on Thanksgiving Day 1944 after his company engaged in a brief gun battle, during which he sustained wounds he would later have to treat himself. His internment at Mulhberg lasted until June of 1945. Forced labor and lack of food pulled 100 pounds off his 6'3"" athletic frame, the physical hardship tempered by the kindness of a German sergeant who recognized a Polish last name and saw to it that regular food rations, as well as shoes, did not disappear. Transferred to Rehabilitation Camp Lucky Strike in France following liberation, he returned to the US, wounds not properly documented, and thus, placing him at a loss for points for discharge. Fortunately, his post rehab Camp Upton (Yaphank, NY) assignment to life guard a swimming pool still under construction left time for USO dances, at one of which he met Katherine Elizabeth Hansen of Long Island, the woman who would become his wife for 48 years. Later, as a defensive tackle for the University of Delaware's national champion team he was on the squad that won the 1947 Cigar Bowl and after graduation in 1948, his 32 year career as track and field coach at Newark High School followed. From 1949 to 1981 he assembled a 401-139 record, took three state championship and 16 Blue Hen Conference titles; a sports conference of which he was one of the founding fathers. Ciesinski was inducted into the Delaware Track and Field Hall of Fame in 2002 and the Delaware Sports Hall of Fame in 2003. His direct approach, integrity, unaffected communication, innate leadership and uncanny ability to assemble effective training regimes benefitted his program's alumni long after their schooling, among them Olympic high jumper Chris Dunn, Houston Oiler Conway Hayman, his brother Buffalo Bills and Seattle Seahawk running back Gary Hayman, Delaware football wide receiver and career coach for Newark High School Pat Walker, and Olympic hurdler Carol Thompson. He is preceded in death by his ten sisters and brothers, all children of August and Frances Bydlowski Ciesinski of Detroit, his wife Katherine and survived by three children; Katherine Ciesinski, professor of voice at the Eastman School of Music, Kristine Ciesinski, assistant professor of voice at Florida State University, Raymond Ciesinski, a senior software sales executive at Symantec Corporation; two grandchildren; and by his companion of 13 years, Nellie Ray Mackie of Hockessin."

2011-07-17T00:00:00Z,"Most mornings when he is in Washington, the House majority whip, Kevin McCarthy, wakes up at 6 a.m. on his office sofa -- which is a slight improvement over the air mattress he once slept on, and probably better than the houseboat that a fellow Republican congressman, Lynn Westmoreland, has half-jokingly tried to convince him to share. McCarthy pulls on some ratty gym clothes, descends three flights of stairs and exits the building, where, when the weather is agreeable, he meets up with about a half-dozen other G.O.P. members on their mountain bikes. Together they cruise along the Mall, past the Lincoln Memorial, across a bridge and along the Potomac River. An hour later, McCarthy will shower in the House gym, head off to breakfast with some other gaggle of Republicans, attend the morning management meeting with Speaker John Boehner and Eric Cantor, the majority leader, huddle throughout the day with his whip staff and committee chairmen and conservative advocacy groups and random needy or disgruntled members until it's finally evening and time to round up a bunch of other Republican colleagues for a dinner that can go on for several hours because McCarthy takes it upon himself to draw the others out from their professional shells with questions like, ''What's the most embarrassing thing that happened to you at college?'' or ''What was the first concert you went to?'' By 11 at night, he is back on his office couch with his BlackBerry and the next day's briefings, some 2,300 miles from his wife and son and daughter in Bakersfield, Calif. -- and then asleep, in a federal building, by 1 a.m. One of McCarthy's morning cycling mates is Sean Duffy, a 39-year-old freshman and Tea Party sensation from Wisconsin who was once a county prosecutor and, before that, a professional lumberjack and star in MTV's reality series ''The Real World.'' Several of the freshmen live in their House offices so as to pronounce themselves detached from the culture of Washington. Duffy also does so because he has six young children and thousands of dollars of debt accumulated during the seven months he spent without a salary before being elected to Congress."

She was the widow of Hubert M. Tibbetts, former President and CEO of Thomas J. Lipton, Inc. Gunhild was born Kerstin Gunhild Margareta on October 12, 1929, in Malmo, Sweden, to Harry and Margareta Wetterhorn. She moved to the United States in 1951, first living in Florida where she attended junior college and was crowned in the Miss St. Petersburg beauty pageant. A lovely Swedish blonde with piercing blue eyes and flawless skin, her looks could have taken her to Hollywood. Always stunningly put together, she had an impeccable eye for fashion and design. After moving to New York City in the mid 1950s, she worked as a buyer for the Cotton Shop on Madison Avenue. It was love at first sight when she met Hubert Tibbetts in New York in 1954. Although multi-talented and creatively gifted, her main goals in life were to have a successful marriage and to provide a loving home for her children. She was happily married to Hubert for 46 years, before he passed away in 2002. Over the years, she played many roles in addition to wife, mother and homemaker: chicken farmer, taxi dispatcher, gardener, chef, and real estate agent. In her spare time, she enjoyed knitting and needlework, and vacationing on the beach in the Cayman Islands. Although beautiful beyond compare, it was her inner beauty that shone brightest. Always there with a friendly smile, she was exceptionally kind-hearted and extremely generous. Your happiness was always the greatest gift to her. A proud U.S. citizen and staunch Republican, she lived her life with no regrets. Family came first for her, and she focused much of the last 15 years spending time with her grandchildren, Serena and Marisa, whom she adored. She is survived by her sister Inger Wetterhorn; brother Richard Wetterhorn; son Lance Tibbetts; daughter and son-in-law Kerstin and Ron Kripalani; and granddaughters Serena and Marisa Kripalani.

But for now, for as many as 500 free agents, there is no blueprint, no courting or being courted, only anticipation for what comes next and more labor pains induced in the form of unemployment. Whenever this period of free agency begins, it will be condensed and frenzied. But the fine print, the rules governing the period, are still to be determined. Players drafted in 2006 or later will pay particular attention to whether four years of service (as expected) or six result in unrestricted free-agent status. Additionally, teams could receive some sort of right-of-first-refusal tag, allowing them to match offers for even unrestricted free agents, if only for this season."

Vinoteca itself is a perfectly fine wine bar, if a bit hushed and dimly lit, but the real action is happening around back: a clustered courtside next to a mock-rustic bocce ball lane made of tile and crushed oyster shells. Bocce — a game that can be described as shuffleboard with balls, or curling sans ice — is enjoying something of a youthful renaissance these days in Washington, spearheaded by the DC Bocce League, an organization with teams across the D.C. area and a membership roll that includes staffers, interns, pollsters, wonks and all manner of Washingtonian young professionals. They play mostly in outdoor parks and on lawns, but these sites have nothing on the backyard at Vinoteca, which could be a miniaturized village square in Torre del Greco, were it not for the condo developments towering above or the Rite Aid across the street. Such open-air surroundings are best accompanied by offerings from the outdoor grill: fresh barbecued monkfish in romesco, warmed olives and almonds, a bluefish tuna sandwich on rustic bread and assorted Mediterranean sausages. Perhaps best of all is the playful by-the-glass wine list, including a dry assyrtiko from Santorini, Greece, and a viognier from nearby Rappahannock Cellars, in Virginia."

They droned and scrabbled, pinged and screeched, buzzed and pealed through Saturday afternoon at the Village Voice/4Knots Music Festival, a free indie-rock concert at Pier 17 at South Street Seaport on Saturday afternoon. With just one stage and six bands, it was the pared-down successor to 10 years of the Siren Music Festival that The Voice used to present at Coney Island. The lineup -- The Black Angels, Titus Andronicus, Davila 666, Oberhofer, Eleanor Friedberger and Mr. Dream -- was purist in a way, clinging to hand-played instruments while steering clear of the electronic dance beats and hip-hop elements that other indie rock has embraced. (Those sorts of music were played in DJ sets -- by Dan Deacon, Yeasayer and others -- two blocks from the pier at the festival's Indoor Lounge, overrun with sponsors.) The bands performing Saturday chose an era, or scrambled together a few of them, and personalized their favorite parts of the rock timeline.

2011-07-20T17:24:32Z,"Like Jon Chait and Matt Yglesias, I’m a little puzzled by the sudden wave of optimism about a potential deal based on the Gang of Six’s just-released bipartisan deficit reduction plan. So far as I can tell, the Gang of Six proposal bears a broad resemblance to the “grand bargain” that President Obama supposedly offered to John Boehner, except that the Gang’s tax reform proposals are more detailed (and raise more revenue) and its proposals for Social Security and Medicare cuts are less specific (there’s a lot of “requiring” Senate committees to come up with budget-cutting reforms). Depending on what came out of the entitlement reform process, I suppose that the Gang’s proposal could be a better deal for conservatives than what Obama offered Boehner. But more likely it would turn out to be a somewhat worse deal, with higher taxes and fewer real entitlement cuts, than the bargain House Republicans already inclined against when their own leader seemed to be considering it. (I recommend reading James Capretta for the sharpest conservative case against the Gang’s proposals, and Reihan Salam for some important qualifiers.)"

But just how well became clearer with a look at the Top 10 list among basic cable shows for the week ending Sunday, according to Nielsen: the three shows all finished in the Top 10, with “Pawn Stars” second only to the Japan/U.S.A. final in the Women’s World Cup. “Pawn Stars,” in which viewers are privy to the haggling prowess of a family of pawnshop owners, has proved to be a major hit for History, as its ratings keep growing; the most recent episode, on Monday night, garnered 6.67 million viewers."

We save hard drive space for what matters, while at the same time improving the accuracy of recall.” So forget all those warnings about how the Web just makes us dumber.

''We're just so proud of the success of Kevin and the fact that he adds a new dynamic to Riverdale.'' The series, titled Kevin Keller, will follow a four-issue mini-series starring Kevin that began in July and has started filling out his background, including his relationship with his father, who serves in the military and is supportive of his son's desire to follow in his footsteps. Like those for the other Archie characters, Kevin's series will deal with his life in high school. ''He's going to be the class president,'' said Dan Parent, the writer-artist who created Kevin. But it won't all be a good time. ''Even the most popular kids are not popular with everybody,'' Mr. Parent said. ''There's some adversity he'll have to deal with.''"

(TCM) LITERARY ROMANCE Turner Classic Movies presents five films adapted from beloved novels, starting with ''Pride and Prejudice'' (1940), the Jane Austen classic about five sisters out to nab husbands in 19th-century England, the better to produce an heir to save the family farm. Greer Garson plays Elizabeth Bennet, the eldest, most independent daughter; Maureen O'Sullivan, Ann Rutherford, Heather Angel and Marsha Hunt portray the others; and Mary Boland is their frantic mother. Laurence Olivier, above with Ms. Garson, is the dashing Mr. Darcy, Elizabeth's ardent suitor -- if only she could stand him. The lineup continues at 10:15 with ''Madame Bovary'' (1949), starring Jennifer Jones as Gustave Flaubert's country girl who sacrifices her marriage for what she thinks is true love; then with ''Anna Karenina'' (1935), the Tolstoy tale of a statesman's wife (Greta Garbo) who deserts her family for the affections of a young officer (Fredric March), at 12:15 a.m.; ''Little Women'' (1949), featuring June Allyson, Margaret O'Brien, Elizabeth Taylor and Janet Leigh in Louisa May Alcott's semi-autobiographical story about New England life during the Civil War, at 2; and ''Far From the Madding Crowd'' (1967), with Julie Christie as Thomas Hardy's romantic English lass who can't choose among three suitors (Terence Stamp, Peter Finch and Alan Bates), at 4:15. 9 P.M.

2011-07-21T16:45:28Z,"Egypt’s antiquities department has been downgraded from a ministry to a cabinet-affiliated office, according to the Los Angeles Times, which cited an Egyptian cabinet spokesman Thursday. The announcement came after a new Cabinet was sworn in that did not include an antiquities minister. Egypt’s antiquities agency had been elevated to a ministry by the former president, Hosni Mubarak, in the last days of his rule; previously it had been under the Ministry of Culture. It still remained unclear, however, who the government intends to appoint to run the office. Last Sunday, officials said the prime minister, Essam Sharaf, planned to replace Zahi Hawass, the longtime antiquities chief, as part of a cabinet reshuffling aimed at appeasing protesters. Since the revolution, Mr. Hawass has come under fire for his ties to the Mubaraks and his financial relationships with American organizations like National Geographic. Mr. Sharaf at first said that he would appoint Abdel Fattah el Banna, a professor at the University of Cairo, as the new minister of antiquities, but he reversed himself after the choice drew protests from archeologists. In the meantime, Mr. Hawass said that Mr. Sharaf had asked him to continue to go to work, according to the Art Newspaper."

Following an announcement by HBO that it had acquired a documentary about George Harrison, Showtime said on Tuesday that it would broadcast a nonfiction feature about Paul McCartney and his experiences in New York after the 9/11 terrorist attacks. The film, ''The Love We Make,'' will chronicle Mr. McCartney's journey from Sept. 11, 2001, when his plane was grounded on a New York tarmac, through his planning for and performance at the ''Concert for New York City'' at Madison Square Garden the next month. ''The Love We Make'' will feature footage from that concert as well as appearances by Mr. McCartney's friends and colleagues, including David Bowie, Eric Clapton, Mick Jagger, Keith Richards and Pete Townshend, as well as his daughter Stella. It is directed by Bradley Kaplan and Albert Maysles, the venerated co-director of ''Grey Gardens'' and ''Gimme Shelter,'' as well as the 1964 documentary ''What's Happening! The Beatles in the U.S.A.'' Mr. McCartney said in a statement: ''''It was an honor to be able to help New York and America at that time in its history. There was a feeling of shock and fear in the air that I thought we could help alleviate with music. And the fact that so many people stepped up to join us made for a very uplifting evening for us all.''"

2011-07-21T00:00:00Z,"That's one notion that seems to be circulating among small-business owners and their advisers lately. Consultants at McKinsey & Company floated the suggestion as part of their controversial report on employer views of health insurance. And in The Times's coverage of that report, Milt Freudenheim interviewed a small-business owner who said he was hoping to ''game the system.'' The owner, Gerry Harkins, who is also chairman of the National Federation of Independent Business's Georgia State Leadership Council, said he might split his Atlanta-based construction company into two smaller companies to evade the overhaul's employer mandate, specifically the penalties on companies that fail to offer affordable health insurance to employees. Unfortunately for Mr. Harkins (who did not return a call from The Agenda seeking an elaboration of his comments), the authors of the Affordable Care Act are one step ahead of him, according to several tax and benefit lawyers contacted by The Agenda. The authors included a provision that basically adopts parts of the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 that say any group of companies under common control are to be treated as a single company. Common control is defined as the same five or fewer people owning at least 80 percent of the companies, according to Al Martin, a tax lawyer at the Kansas City law firm Lathrop & Gage. Spouses and children are generally considered one owner, according to Mr. Martin."

2011-07-21T00:00:00Z,"AT the Harry Potter premiere in London earlier this month, Emma Watson wore her growing-out pixie soft and wispy. For the New York premiere last week (above), she went super slick, a look that was all over the fall runways. If it looks as easy as dipping a comb in Dep, it turns out there are tricks to getting it right. ''The technique requires methodical product application,'' said Ms. Watson's hairstylist, Rodney Cutler. Who knew? He recommends combing a mix of Redken Sheer Straight and a smoothing serum through your hair, section by section, then applying a spray that adds shine (Mr. Cutler uses Cutler Shine Tattoo) and hairspray to seal in the works. ''This way, it repels the humidity and stops the underneath from bubbling out,'' he said. With longer hair, take your cues from the runway. At Saint Laurent, hair was side-parted with a low chignon pinned up in the back; at Gucci and Akris, it was pulled into ponytails."

2011-07-21T00:00:00Z,"Having returned from a humid if lucrative trip to Bangkok (to shoot the smash summer comedy ''The Hangover Part II'') with all of his digits intact, Bradley Cooper is headed to another sweltering location for his next movie - and we don't mean Australia. Mr. Cooper will portray Lucifer, the fallen angel turned ruler of Hell, in a film version of Milton's ''Paradise Lost,'' The Associated Press reported. The original epic, you surely recall, told the story ''of man's first disobedience, and the fruit of that forbidden tree'' that was used by Satan to tempt Adam and Eve away from God, and famously sought to ''justify the ways of God to men.'' While the blind Milton had to dictate his poem to secretaries, the ways of the film industry are a little different: Australian government officials announced on Wednesday that the special-effects-heavy ''Paradise Lost'' movie would be directed by Alex Proyas, the director of big-budget action features including ''I, Robot'' and ''Knowing,'' and would be filmed largely at the Fox Studios in Sydney, with some financial incentives from the government of New South Wales."
2011-07-21T00:00:00Z,"There are few series I can think of whose conclusions occasion feelings of sorrow. ''The Sopranos'' ended amid confusion and awe. We may miss the narrative and the ingeniously black comedy of it all, if not the actual characters, none of whom you really want tucking you into bed at night. The same can be said of ''Big Love,'' another of the greatest family dramas ever on television. Though we may miss its intelligent social commentary, we do not necessarily pine for the people in it to re-enter our lives. HBO renders characters ambiguously; we are not supposed to fall in love with each and every one of them. As a network series, ''Friday Night Lights'' operated under certain constraints and the result was not only an exquisite bit of anthropology -- life in a small, working-class Texas town - but a show in which beloved characters became intimates in our own lives. The series is over now, and I can genuinely say, I'm sorry that I won't be able to see how these lives further unfold -- how Tami and Eric make out in the Northeast, how Tim and Tyra do as a married couple, how Becky and Luke manage his time in the military, how Billy and Mindy will manage with twins."

2011-07-21T00:00:00Z,"''The Right to Fashion in the Age of Terrorism'' by Minh-Ha T. Pham in Signs: Journal of Women in Culture and Society. The Argument: Consumerism has long been considered a cornerstone of democracy and a civic obligation in American society. Ms. Pham examines why the fashion industry, in particular, became the emblem of freedom and economic revitalization following the Sept. 11, 2001, terrorist attacks. ''Freedom to shop is one of the fundamental liberties terrorists want to deprive us of,'' Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani declared in October 2001 at the start of Fashion Week in New York. Ms. Pham, an assistant professor of art history and Asian-American studies at Cornell University, argues that the ability to express oneself through dress could be starkly represented as a symbol of democracy in comparison with the burqa, which was denounced as an example of Taliban repression and invoked when government officials listed the humanitarian justifications for the war in Afghanistan. Ms. Pham complains that this assumption about the burqa, however, ignores the desires of Muslim women who may choose to be covered and discounts the hostility that the Muslim veil has sometimes incited in Western societies."

It was a letter opener, but this was not your typical letter opener. In the clear acrylic handle floated a mini uterus with two pills strategically placed where ovaries normally reside, alongside the drug's name, Hormonin. This promotional product was a gift from a drug company representative to my granddad, a doctor in Laredo, Tex. I tried to imagine how this token must have been received by the taciturn Dr. Puig. ''Thanks Hal, I'll put this next to my collection of kidney stones.'' Or, ''Do you have that on a T-shirt in an extra large?'' Highly doubtful.

Not an easy time. And I don't see much evidence of a bounce back coming soon. I have come to the conclusion that it is time to reassess. First of all, Einstein had it wrong. Not his theory of relativity. That seems to be holding up quite well (not that I would know). But he's also the guy who said that the definition of insanity was doing the same thing over and over again and expecting different results.

The faculty and staff of New York State Psychiatric Institute, the Department of Psychiatry, Columbia University Medical Center, and the NewYork-Presbyterian Hospital deeply mourn the passing of our beloved friend, admired teacher and distinguished colleague Alexander H. Glassman, M.D. Dr. Glassman was an internationally recognized clinical researcher whose innovative and scientifically rigorous contributions to our knowledge of serious mental illness changed the way we treat patients. Dr. Glassman was born in Chicago and received his M.D. degree from the University of Illinois. He joined the faculty of Albert Einstein College of Medicine in New York, and, after service in the United States Army, returned to New York and joined the faculty at Columbia in 1969, rising to the rank of Professor. Dr. Glassman was a prolific researcher with broad vision. His work was among the first to document that monitoring the blood concentration of antidepressant medication was an effective method of improving treatment success. He was a pioneer and recognized expert on the impact of psychiatric medication on the heart and the impact of depression on the development of heart disease. His studies were among the first to document that mood disturbance following myocardial infarction was associated with a substantial increase in later mortality, and in a seminal study he showed that treatment of depression in this vulnerable population may well increase survival. In recent years, Dr. Glassman established the links between smoking and psychiatric illness, and formulated a neurobiological model that led to new treatments for nicotine addiction. His work was at the core of a sophisticated revision of our understanding of the relationship between mind, brain and the body. He authored over 350 publications in every major journal in medicine. He received numerous awards and honors including the American Psychiatric Association's Prize for Research, New York State Research Award, the NARSAD Distinguished Investigators Award, and the Anna-Monika Foundation Prize. He lectured around the world and was an important contributor to scientific meetings for over four decades. As a member of the Columbia faculty for over 40 years, Dr. Glassman trained generations of psychiatrists and mentored young researchers, many of whom have gone on to leadership roles themselves. Dr. Glassman was also an extraordinary clinician. His extensive knowledge of psychiatric illness, professional integrity and exceptional devotion made him the most sought after consultant. His exacting attention to detail, his love of his work, along with his marvelous creativity endeared him to all of us. He cared for his patients with warmth, wisdom and humanity. With profound sadness for this irreparable loss, we extend our deepest sympathies to Dr. Glassman's family.Jeffrey A.

2011-07-21T00:00:00Z,"HANNELI MUSTAPARTA, model, fashion blogger and street-style photographer at hanneli.com. WHAT I'M WEARING NOW The shirt is Topshop. I was over everything being sequins, but this is not over-the-top shiny, and I love baby yellow. The shorts I just found in Paris. They were made from vintage white leather. The shoes are Acne. The blazer is Rag & Bone from this season. The sunglasses, my favorite in the world, I had specially made at Selima. I had the frames for reading and asked to have them made with black gradient lenses. I wore them nonstop, so I gave them a break all last year. Then I saw Anja Rubik in Paris wearing what looked like the same glasses, so I dug mine up because they are perfect for the season. It's fun to be reminded of things you already have in your closet."
2011-07-21T00:00:00Z,"Getting excited about a Bluetooth car speakerphone is a tough business. First, it's a Bluetooth device, so if you've seen one, you've seen them all. Second, it's a device made for the car so it's kind of useless for folks who spend time on the subway. That said, I'm actually impressed by (and willing to discuss) Jabra's Freeway speakerphone, a small, compact, battery-powered device that connects to almost any cellphone and offers surround-sound audio, hands-free calling, and FM transmission so you can listen to music and take calls on your stereo."

All I know is that if I brought an Xbox into my apartment, I’m scared I might never do anything else."

2011-07-22T17:55:55Z,"SAN DIEGO— Patience is often in short supply on Comic-Con’s trade show floor, where lines of fans waiting to get an autograph or check out a particular booth snake through the already gridlocked aisles. Lionsgate, the studio that “Saw” built, is normally one of the biggest line generators, because it loads its exhibit area with technology. Last year, for instance, the studio invited attendees to make videos of themselves trapped inside a coffin; Lionsgate then emailed them the result to share with their friends online. The stunt promoted “Buried,” a thriller starring Ryan Reynolds, and it was a huge Comic-Con hit (although it didn’t pay off in box office success)."

2011-07-22T17:26:18Z,"Organizers of the annual Prospect Park Summer Soirée could not have picked a better night to throw a retro space-themed party. The landing of the Atlantis early Thursday morning, which marked the end of NASA’s shuttle program, and by extension, the end of an era in space exploration, had everyone thinking about starships and galaxies. If entering the event’s space, a charming 1905 Beaux Arts-style boathouse, to music from “2001: A Space Odyssey” felt a bit kitschy, well, so was the ’70s space-age-inspired look that prompted the party. Call it cosmic, but it worked."

The winners were determined by online vote at univision.com. CBS had the most total viewers on the night thanks to a live eviction episode of “Big Brother” (6.7 million viewers). “Love Bites,” the sole NBC series not in repeats, fell to just under 1.8 million viewers for its (unplanned) final episode.

It is still not clear who will run the office, which will again be known as the Supreme Council of Antiquities. Mr. Hawass was pushed out, along with several other cabinet members, as part of an effort by Prime Minister Essam Sharaf to appease protesters who had returned to Tahrir Square to demand further changes in the government."

Another variation of these vampire chronicles comes in “Blood Work,” which enters our hardcover list at No. 1 this week.

2011-07-22T13:41:15Z,In which we bring you motoring news from around the Web:
2011-07-22T13:38:22Z,"Back in 2008, when Helmut Lang installed a busted up disco ball on the floor of the Journal Gallery in Brooklyn, he explained that, in his mind anyway, the piece related to the Janus mythology — looking back and moving forward. “It’s also about transitions and new beginnings, representing time as one half respects the past and the other one looks into the future,” he said. But with his new installation at the Fireplace Project in East Hampton, N.Y., it appears that the past is no longer an issue for the designer who took what turned out to be a permanent hiatus from fashion in 2005 and has been working full time as an artist pretty much ever since. “Make It Hard,” as the show is called, comprises about 20 pillar-like sculptures, which Lang created after he shredded the thousands of pieces that remained in his archive. Sad as it may be to think about all of those wasted moleskin coats, lace and rubber dresses and motocross pants, “Make It Hard” is a poignant realization of Lang’s long-held conviction that fashion and art have become one. On the eve of the opening, Lang talked to The Moment about art, the passage of time and why there will never be another Helmut Lang sample sale ever again."

2011-07-22T13:13:42Z,"While we wait (and wait, and wait …) to find out if John Boehner and Barack Obama are about to snatch a significant deal from the jaws of a parliamentary maneuver, I recommend reading Yuval Levin’s powerful case against the sort of larger bargain that I’ve been suggesting conservatives should consider in these negotiations. The problem with the “big” deals that have been floated to date, Levin points out, is that none of them seriously address the long-term growth of Medicare spending: The entitlement reforms being considered, from retirement-age increases to modest means-testing, will generate only extremely modest savings when set against the projected cost explosion in the coming decades. And so it would be a mistake, he argues, for Republicans to make a significant concession on taxes without getting genuine structural reform to Medicare (along the lines of the Ryan plan, or the more centrist Rivlin-Domenici alternative) in return — a policy mistake, because it would concede too much for too little, and a political mistake, because calling something a “grand bargain” would leave the impression that our deficit problem has somehow been dealt with, when in fact this round of negotiations is just the opening act for a much larger and necessarily more controversial process of reform."

2011-07-22T00:00:00Z,"Teen drama, both real and fictional, continues to be a winning formula for MTV. The network's new scripted comedy series ''Awkward'' made its debut to strong ratings Tuesday night, following the hit show ''Teen Mom,'' a reality series whose title needs no explanation. Currently on its third season, ''Teen Mom'' drew 3.2 million viewers and was the most-watched cable show in the 18- to 49-year-old demographic for the night, a prize it has claimed each week since its season premiere on July 7, according to an analysis of Nielsen ratings data by TV by the Numbers. ''Awkward,'' which focuses on the teenage life of one Jenna Hamilton (Ashley Rickards), who wants nothing more than to fit in at her high school, picked up slightly more than 1.7 million viewers. Meanwhile, Wednesday night's battle for ratings supremacy on the broadcast networks did not have a clear victor. CBS led with total viewers for the night as a new episode of ''Big Brother'' won the 8 p.m. hour with just over 7 million viewers. However, Fox claimed the top spot overall among the 18- to 49-year-old set, thanks to a two-hour edition of ''So You Think You Can Dance.'' Finally, NBC once again boasted the highest-rated program of the night, with a results show edition of ''America's Got Talent'' at slightly less than 9.9 million viewers."

2011-07-22T00:00:00Z,"8 P.M. (TCM) STAR OF THE MONTH: SINGING COWBOYS Turner Classic Movies celebrates the tuneful heroes of the Wild West, like Gene Autry and Roy Rogers, who could ride, shoot and slug it out with the best of them before sliding out of the saddle, grabbing a guitar and serenading listeners with ballads like ''Tumbling Tumbleweeds'' and ''Happy Trails.'' This 26-movie tribute, shown on Fridays in July, continues with four films starring Dick Foran, a New Jersey-born, Princeton-educated band singer and radio performer signed by Warner Brothers in 1934 as its answer to Autry. The lineup begins with ''Moonlight on the Prairie'' (1935), in which an unemployed rodeo star takes on cattle rustlers. ''Song of the Saddle'' (1936), about a cowboy who goes on a quest to avenge his father's murder, follows at 9:15; ''Treachery Rides the Range'' (1936), in which a cowboy takes on buffalo hunters out to stir up trouble with Indians, at 10:30; and ''Land Beyond the Law'' (1937), about an innocent rancher who gets mixed up with rustlers, at 11:30. Two films with Monte Hale, above, a rodeo performer who took over for Autry at Republic Studios and was considered the last of the great singing cowboys, wrap up the evening: ''Home on the Range'' (1946), in which a cowboy tries to protect bears from ranchers who think they are killing cattle, at 12:30 a.m., and ''Under Colorado Skies'' (1947), about a bank teller who recognizes a robber as his brother, at 1:30. 7 P.M. (Oxygen) LITTLE MISS SUNSHINE (2006) Abigail Breslin (above far left with, from left, Toni Collette, Steve Carell and Greg Kinnear) received an Academy Award nomination for her portrayal of the unlikely preteen princess Olive Hoover in this comedy about a family of everyday misfits determined to get a 7-year-old to a beauty pageant. Alan Arkin won an Oscar for best supporting actor as the heroin-snorting grandfather who helps put Olive's talent routine over the top; Mr. Kinnear and Ms. Collette play the parents driving the ravaged family and its equally dilapidated Volkswagen bus; Mr. Carell is Frank, Olive's suicidal gay uncle; and Paul Dano is Dwayne, the Hoovers' teenage son, who has decided to keep his mouth shut about the situation. Writing in The New York Times, Manohla Dargis called the film ''a tale about genuine faith and manufactured glory that unwinds in the American Southwest, but more rightly takes place at the terminus of the American dream, where families are one bad break away from bankruptcy.''"

Then the Eastern State staff noticed his talent and invited him to line the Catholic chaplain's office suite with biblical murals. Under skylights in the chaplain's vaulted rooms, Mr. Smith depicted souls in purgatory and saints aloft. In one scene he also seems to have portrayed himself, in a uniform with the number 01010 printed across the shoulder blades, covering his face and kneeling before Jesus. (That was not his real number, scholars at Eastern State have determined.)"

2011-07-23T00:00:00Z,"LONDON -- Trying, perhaps, to live up to its name, the new ''Ghost: The Musical'' vanishes before your eyes. That it does so is a logic- and senses-defying mystery that I kept trying to figure out during a rainy-day matinee at the Piccadilly Theater, as if I were at a magic show where people keep asking, ''Now how do they do that?'' Because ''Ghost,'' adapted from the love-beyond-the-grave make-out movie of 1990, is full of flash and noise and blinding lights. (Advisory: bring sunglasses.) And yet somehow it simply isn't there. It all feels about as substantial as the swirling smoke it uses so abundantly. I diverted myself by trying to track said smoke's points of emanation from the floor of the stage. That's how engaged I was."

2011-07-23T00:00:00Z,"Zahi Hawass, whose departure as Egypt's minister of antiquities was announced in a cabinet reshuffle this week, said in an e-mail Friday that, while he continues to supervise the agency while his replacement is found, he will not be staying on for more than a few days ''to help with the transition.'' Mr. Hawass said, ''I am retiring to focus on my own work, as a scholar and a writer,'' adding he is looking forward to ''living quietly as a private person, away from politics.'' On Thursday, the Egyptian government said it is downgrading the antiquities department from a ministry to an office reporting to the prime minister, reversing a decision by former president Hosni Mubarak in the last days of his rule to elevate its status. It is still not clear who will run the office, which will again be known as the Supreme Council of Antiquities. Mr. Hawass was pushed out, along with several other cabinet members, as part of an effort by Prime Minister Essam Sharaf to appease protesters who had returned to Tahrir Square to demand further changes in the government. Mr. Hawass has been credited with boosting Egyptian tourism and promoting the return of cultural artifacts to their home country. But since the revolution, he drew criticism for his ties to the Mubaraks, his role in sending artifacts abroad on traveling exhibitions and his relationship with National Geographic, which paid him up to $200,000 a year as an explorer-in-residence. Last week, before he was removed, Mr. Hawass said that he had temporarily resigned from his post with National Geographic. At the time, he was listed among the current explorers-in-residence on the organization's Web site. His status has now changed to explorer-in-residence emeritus."

The cardinal is 76, not 75. At age 75, bishops are required to offer their resignation and the pope can either accept it or allow them to continue to serve; 75 is not the ''customary retirement age'' for bishops. The article also misstated, in some editions, the name of the group to which Cardinal Rigali was elevated to in 2003. It is the College of Cardinals, not the House of Cardinals."

2011-07-23T00:00:00Z,"12:30 P.M. (Family) OVERBOARD (1987) In this comedy directed by Garry Marshall, the rich and spoiled Joanna Stayton (Goldie Hawn, right), is given a chance to experience life from a completely different (read: poor) perspective. A fall from her yacht gives Joanna amnesia; a vengeful handyman (Kurt Russell), whom she had refused to pay for work he'd done on her boat, claims her as his wife from the hospital where she is recovering. The handyman, Dean Proffitt, is initially interested only in getting what he is owed by putting her to work cleaning his house and, since he's a widower, taking care of his four boys. Dean calls her Annie, gives her some ill-fitting clothes and convinces her that the children are hers. Unsurprisingly, a love story unfolds, and the characters are given an opportunity to understand what truly makes them happy.

That stake would be obtained by issuing new shares in Chrysler; it would not come from the United Automobile Workers union's health care trust fund. (Since Fiat and the union trust fund are the only remaining shareholders in the automaker, the issuance of the new shares would, in effect, reduce the size of the trust fund's stake in Chrysler)."

We should reject moral absolutes, even as we keep our moral convictions, allowing that there can be right and wrong relative to this or that moral code, but no right and wrong per se.  (See, for example, Stanley Fish’s 2001 op-ed, “Condemnation Without Absolutes.”)[1]"

2011-07-24T00:00:00Z,"With the Diavel, Ducati styling adds an alternative theme, moving away from the racetrack-replica sportbikes that have earned it an image as the Ferrari of two-wheelers. Ducati's ambition to establish its new model as a landmark product is evident in the name: Diavel is a reference in the Bolognese dialect for devil.Often characterized as a member of the muscle cruiser category, the bike hews more closely to the Monster model line -- naked bikes to enthusiasts -- than to the full-fairing design of the maker's super bikes. The Diavel's designer, Bart Janssen-Groesbeek, who came to the company in 2002 from Yamaha's design studio, took inspiration from the Yamaha-built Star VMax as well as the Harley-Davidson V-Rod and the Confederate Wraith. Mr. Janssen-Groesbeek, who was born in the Netherlands, said he was also influenced by the California customizer look.But above all, he has said, he wanted the Diavel to evoke the spirit of the American hot-rod and drag racing scene -- a flavor of Von Dutch in Italian performance. That theme is visible in the stance, a diagonal profile meant to evoke a sprinter poised in the starting blocks. At a low 30.3 inches, the seat height allows a relaxed riding position. The horizontal placement of the rear shock absorber helps make the low seat possible."

The city uses recycled sewage for irrigation, construction and manufacturing and releases a small percentage of the sewage into a local aquifer, where it eventually mixes with groundwater and, after several years, is pumped and treated for use as drinking water. It is not the case that ''40 percent of the tap water is recycled sewage.'' The article also incorrectly described earthquakes and tsunamis. They are geological phenomena, not forms of extreme weather. And the article misspelled the surname of a scientist at the Lamont-Doherty Earth Observatory at Columbia University who studies climate model projections. He is Richard Seager, not Seagar."

After the trade, White had free rein in the center of the board, but after 11 Bd2, chances were about equal. That did not stop Hou from mustering an at- tack.Sebag did not take a pawn with 15 ... Ng4 because she did not want to open the file in front of her king, though after 16 Qg3 Nf6 17 Rhg1 Ne8, it would not have been easy for White to make much progress.Sebag should have played 18 Qd4, when after 19 Qg4 ef5 20 Qf4, chances would have remained equal.Hou erred with 19 Nf3. Sebag could have played 19 ... Nd3, when 20 cd3Qa2 would have giv- en Black a dangerous attack and an advantage. Another option was 20 Kb1 Nb2 21 Kb2 Qb4 22 Ka1 Rc3, when again Black would have been in a better position.But then Sebag tripped up again with 20 ... Bf8. She should have moved 20 ... Ng6, when after 21fe7 b4 Black would have been fine. Hou pounced with 21 g6; Black would be losing after 21 ... Ng6 22 Ng5 h6 23fg7 Bg7 24 Nf7.Hou's 26 Qg4 was also a mis- take; 26 Rg1 would have given her an overwhelming attack. But Sebag missed her chance. She should have played 26 ... Kg7. Af- ter 27 Rg3 g5 28 h4 Be7 29 Rd7 Qf1 30 Nd1 Qf4, White's advantage would have been minimal.Sebag was forced to play 27 ... Kg7 because 27 ... Bg7 would have lost to 28 Rf6, and Black would soon have been checkmated.The game's denouement was particularly nice: Hou sacrificed her queen to break down Black's defense. Sebag resigned rather than play 32 ... Kf8, when she would have been checkmated by 33 Rh8."

2011-07-24T00:00:00Z,"NOON (Fox Movie) NIAGARA (1953) Marilyn Monroe and Niagara Falls are both shining stars of this dramatic thriller. Honeymooners Polly (Jean Peters) and Ray Cutler (Casey Adams) arrive at their cottage by the falls to find that Rose (Monroe) and George Loomis (Joseph Cotten, above with Monroe) have not yet checked out. The Cutlers take temporary accommodations, and the two couples' lives quickly become intertwined, making secrets harder to keep. Polly soon discovers that Rose is cheating on her husband and that his jealous rage is likely justified, although he does seem a bit unstable. And George's uneven personality is caused by Rose's openly lascivious behavior around other men, which is part of her plan. You see, Rose's lover, Patrick (Richard Allan), is to murder George, and it will appear to be the unsurprising suicide or disappearance of a temperamental man. Murder plots rarely go according to plan, however. At 1:30 is the whodunit film noir ''I Wake Up Screaming,'' (1941) starring Betty Grable, Victor Mature and Carole Landis. Frankie (Mature), a promoter, has been accused of murdering Vicky (Landis), a model and aspiring actress. Frankie and Vicky's sister, Jill (Grable), are interrogated for hours and their answers turned into flashbacks reveal the plot. A very eager cop played by Laird Cregar torments and pressures Frankie, and circumstantial evidence against the suspect starts to pile up. 7 A.M.

''I was thinking afternoon cocktails,'' said Mr. Luftig, who had legally married Mr. Adelson in October.

2011-07-24T00:00:00Z,"On May 29, a young woman named Bushra al- Maqtari joined a group of several thousand protesters marching down a trash-strewn boulevard in the Yemeni city of Taiz. The Arab world's democratic uprising was five months old, and patience among the protesters in Taiz -- Yemen's second largest city -- was wearing thin. Maqtari had been one of the first and most fearless leaders of the movement. She is a remarkable figure: a 31-year-old university administrator and fiction writer, she is also a childless divorcee who refused, until recently, to wear the abaya, the all-covering gown that is practically mandatory for women in Yemen. Tiny and frail, she has a round, lovely face, with level brows and tranquil brown eyes. On that afternoon, Maqtari was standing in a crowd gathered around the city's General Security building -- an imposing six-story edifice flanked by guards -- when she heard cracking sounds. She looked up and saw that the officers on the building's roof were not just throwing rocks, as they had in the past. They were firing straight down into the crowd below. Within minutes, at least four people were dead and about 60 were wounded. Maqtari began running back toward ''Freedom Square,'' the intersection where thousands of protesters had been camped out for months demanding the resignation of Ali Abdullah Saleh, Yemen's strongman president. Then the real assault began. Armored vehicles, tanks and bulldozers began converging on the protesters' tent city from all sides. They fired tear gas and water cannons into the square and began shooting protesters at point-blank range. They doused the tents, which extended for hundreds of yards in every direction, with gasoline and lighted them on fire. None of the protesters had weapons. ''People were dying all around us, and there was nothing we could do,'' Maqtari told me. Some were burned alive. At around 11 p.m., Maqtari fled to her sister's house, about 200 yards uphill from the square. There, she and other protesters watched as flames engulfed the entire square, raging for several hours. Officers stormed through the local hospital and several field clinics where protesters were being treated, firing tear gas down the corridors, shooting up the ceilings and arresting doctors and nurses. Some thrust their gun butts into patients' wounds. Others were laughing hysterically, as if they were on drugs, Maqtari and others told me, and shouting into the darkness, ''Ali is your god!'' The next morning, amid the charred remains of the tents, someone had scrawled a sardonic reversal of the protesters' chants on a wall. ''The regime wants the fall of the people,'' it said."

2011-07-24T00:00:00Z,"The best story about Myra Kraft to emerge among the touching remembrances following her death this week after a long battle with cancer came from her son Jonathan. He recalled how his mom, during a family trip to South Africa in the era of apartheid, demanded that a white police officer who was taking black men into custody arrest her, too. Jonathan remembered his dad, the Patriots owner Robert K. Kraft, telling him not to let his mother get in trouble. So he threw his mom, a petite woman, over his shoulder and hauled her away. Robert Kraft's office in Gillette Stadium is decorated with pictures of him with celebrities (there is a dazzling photograph near the door of him dancing with Jacqueline Kennedy), but the ones behind his desk, closest to him, are huge portraits of his family. Robert and Myra met as college students and Myra knew nothing of football until her husband bought the Patriots. Myra was raised in privilege herself, and then used the team's fame and success to enhance her own vast philanthropic efforts. She became a fixture around the Patriots, sitting next to her husband and children at games, and the outpouring of grief from former and current Patriots players speaks to how much of a presence she became in their lives. Curtis Martin, the former Patriots and Jets running back, told a story about how when he was sick of eating out, Myra gave him homemade soup. She was at the center of the pregame parties her husband threw, and was waiting outside the locker room for him when the games were over. She was far more than a cheerleader, though, so central to her husband's decision-making that when she famously objected in 1996 after the Patriots drafted Christian Peter, who had a history of violence against women, he was quickly cut. Last week, Dan Shaughnessy of The Boston Globe called her the conscience and soul of the Patriots."

On the contrary, the band of five boys is refreshingly nerdy in appearance. The endearingly scrawny lead singer could easily be mistaken an I.T. tech who broke free of his keyboard and grabbed a microphone, were it not for his surprisingly deep baritone wailing over heavy, rolling drums. The curator and photographer Tim Barber, who hosted the party, looked pleased with the chaotic state of affairs in the mosh pit, as he ambled about, pressing extra rolls of film into my hand to be sure the moment was documented."

O.K., what I really heard was just people talking – and occasionally yelling, barking or squealing. As usual. But because I had just left a show in which the line between song and speech had been thoroughly dissolved, my ears were suddenly tuned into previously unheard melodies lurking in human conversation. I felt kind of like Gene Kelly being an American in Paris, but in a grimmer, more reflective mood."

2011-07-26T09:26:52Z,"Last night’s prime-time back-and-forth between President Obama and John Boehner was interesting political theater, and a useful digest of the arguments (“shared sacrifice” versus “no new taxes”) that we’re going to hear a lot over the next year or so — both in the presidential election and, if we only get a short-term increase in the debt ceiling, in the run-up to the next round of deficit brinksmanship. But it felt irrelevant to the endgame that’s currently taking shape in Congress. The president will almost certainly sign any bill that can pass both houses of Congress, and we’re down to three scenarios for how that happens. Assuming that Boehner can muster enough Republican votes to pass the plan he announced yesterday — which would cut a trillion dollars in discretionary spending, raise the debt ceiling for six months, and then empower yet another bipartisan commission try to negotiate a longer-term deal — and assuming that Harry Reid can find the votes to push his plan, with similar spending cuts but a longer debt-ceiling extension, through the Democratic-controlled Senate, then some compromise between the Boehner plan and the Reid plan seems like a natural solution to the impasse. (Ezra Klein has one plausible example of what such a compromise might look like.) However, enough Republicans regard Boehner’s plan as a sellout to begin with that the speaker of the House might not be able to make that compromise, in which case it becomes a question of who cracks first: Enough moderate Senate Democrats to push the Boehner plan through that body, or enough moderate House Republicans to push a version of the Reid plan through the House. (Note that Nancy Pelosi has endorsed Reid’s plan, suggesting that most House Democrats would vote for it if necessary.)"

In an age of trillion-dollar debt and billion-dollar bank bailouts, America’s lowest common denomination seems to bear little value as an individual monetary unit. Yet the copper-toned coin bearing Lincoln’s profile still holds a unique place in our national identity. Phrases like Benjamin Franklin’s “A penny saved is a penny earned” and the actual artifact itself (shown above is a photographic penny spectrum by the designer Bob Dinetz,) are as American is it gets. The same cannot be said of the origins of its designer."

That’s because most of the prospective buyers are teams in hitters’ parks. None of the teams with the most extreme pitchers’ parks — the Mariners, the Rays, the Athletics, the Padres, the Mets, the Dodgers or the Marlins — are buying right now, and that means your pitcher is likely to wind up in Yankee Stadium, Arlington, the Great American Ballpark, Miller Field, U.S. Cellular Field or some other place where baseballs tend to fly into the seats. The presumably better run support will help, as will not having to face that team’s offense anymore, but if you’re a Shields owner, you would probably rather the deadline come and go uneventfully."

On Monday, Animal Planet announced that it had started filming on a program tentatively titled ''The Faroe Islands Project,'' which it said will chronicle Sea Shepherd's campaign to stop an annual whale hunt known as ''The Grind'' in the Faroes, an island group and Danish protectorate between the Norwegian Sea and the Atlantic Ocean. Animal Planet said in a news release that the new series will feature many of the Sea Shepherd crew members from ''Whale Wars,'' including Capt. Paul Watson, Peter Hammarstedt, Chris Aultman and Chad Halstead, as well as their ships the Steve Irwin and the Brigitte Bardot. The Steve Irwin, the group's 194-foot flagship vessel, was recently impounded by a Scottish court following a claim filed by a Maltese company, which seeks damages from a 2010 incident in which Sea Shepherd released bluefin tuna from the company's nets near Libya. A statement from Animal Planet described the ship's seizure as ''an unforeseen hurdle,'' and Sea Shepherd says it must post a bond of about $1.4 million or it will lose the ship."

This is possibly not a good sign, and yet the reaction isn't hard to explain. Even as the climactic moments of this revival of Henrik Ibsen's epoch-making play approach, it can be difficult to remember that we are meant to be in contemporary America, not 19th-century Norway, and that Ms. Rabe's soon-to-be-liberated Nora could be charting her journey toward self-realization with the assistance of an iPhone."

The alarm bells - or, at least, the graduation chimes - were sounded earlier this month when Mr. Murphy gave an interview to The Hollywood Reporter in which he said that the characters played by Ms. Michele, Mr. Colfer and Mr. Monteith would leave their fictional high school after the coming season of ''Glee.''"

2011-07-26T00:00:00Z,"AHERN--Margaret Rose ""Peggy"", 80. Prominent New York City educator Margaret Rose ""Peggy"" Ahern of Ridge, New York, died peacefully in her sleep July 23 of natural causes. Born in Jamaica, Queens, Peggy received her Masters in Education from St. John's University. She was a lifelong educator, who began her career as a teacher at the School for the Deaf in New York City. She taught for many years in the New York Public School system before becoming a principal in Rockaway, Queens. Peggy moved to Jamestown, Rhode Island in the late 1970s, where she continued her work as an educator teaching ESL at the Naval War College in Newport. For several years, Peggy spent the school year on Cuttyhunk Island teaching in a one-room schoolhouse, flying home to Jamestown for many weekends and the summers. Always at her side were her two beloved Irish Setters, Rhody and York. While in Jamestown Peggy pursued many passions including painting, golf and bridge. She was a member of the Jamestown Historical Society, a Docent at The Breakers in Newport and volunteered for 15 years with In-Sight, reading magazines, brochures and books onto audiotapes for the blind and visually impaired. The youngest of six, Peggy is survived by her sisters Eileen A. Sullivan of Albany, New York, and Mary Phelan of Melville, New York; her brother-in-law Frank Phelan; and the many, many children who loved her, including her 16 nieces and nephews. Peggy was predeceased by her brother Cornelius Ahern and sisters Veronica DeGloria and Ann Farrell. Peggy was passionate about the arts, attending theater both on and off Broadway. While her family most fondly recalls frequent trips with her to the Bronx Zoo, she most loved introducing them to culture, which included field trips to her most beloved museums: The Metropolitan Museum of Art, The Museum of Natural History and The Whitney. She was an avid golfer, bridge player and traveler, as equally comfortable on the Green Course at Bethpage State Park as she was in the streets of Haifa. A avid environmentalist who began recycling gift cards, wrapping paper and plastic bags in the 1960s, Peggy loved the ocean. She was never without her 'summer bag', which was always chock full with just-in-case extras and was never without a dog-eared deck of Royal Playing Cards. Visiting hours be held at Vernon Wagner Funeral Home, 655 Old Country Road, Plainview, NY, Wednesday July 27 from 4:00-8:00pm.

2011-07-27T00:00:00Z,"John Lithgow will return to Broadway next spring to star in ''The Columnist,'' playing the famous midcentury newspaperman Joseph Alsop in a new drama by David Auburn, who won both the Pulitzer Prize for drama and the Tony Award for best play in 2001 for ''Proof.'' Mr. Lithgow, a two-time Tony winner for ''Sweet Smell of Success'' (in which he also played a columnist) and ''The Changing Room'' (his Broadway debut in 1973), was last on Broadway in the 2008-9 season in the revival of ''All My Sons.'' He has also won five Emmy Awards for various television roles, most notably for his starring role on ''Third Rock From the Sun.'' Alsop was an influential columnist on politics and foreign affairs from the 1940s through the 1970s; his reputation was muddied in the 1960s, however, because of his support for the Vietnam War and ongoing whispers that he was a closeted homosexual who had been caught on camera by the K.G.B. while having sex with another man. Mr. Auburn's play is a work of fiction but nevertheless deals with this history as Mr. Lithgow's character navigates political turmoil, social change and personal troubles in the early 1960s. The play will be directed by Daniel Sullivan, who won a Tony for staging ''Proof,'' and produced by Manhattan Theater Club, where that earlier Auburn work also ran. ''The Columnist'' is scheduled to begin previews at the Samuel J. Friedman Theater on April 3, 2012, and open on April 25."

The first is called ''Lady, Go Die!'' and is planned for publication in May 2012. It comes from a substantial fragment of a book that Spillane wrote between ''I, the Jury,'' the 1947 novel that introduced the Mike Hammer character, and its 1950 follow-up, ''My Gun Is Quick.'' A second unreleased novel, ''Complex 90,'' is described as a cold-war thriller and scheduled for release in May 2013; the third unreleased novel, ''King of the Weeds,'' is slated for May 2014."

2011-07-27T00:00:00Z,"8 P.M. (HBO) THE KIDS ARE ALL RIGHT (2010) Directed by Lisa Cholodenko, this dramatic comedy, above, tells the story of Jules (Julianne Moore) and Nic (Annette Bening), a gay couple whose teenage children were brought into the world with the help of an anonymous sperm donor. Their daughter, Joni (Mia Wasikowska), at the insistence of her brother, Laser (Josh Hutcherson), does some digging and finds the donor, Paul (Mark Ruffalo). After a bit of awkwardness at their initial meeting, Paul is surprisingly eager to be around for the kids and assumes a familial role that is perhaps overstepping his bounds and disrupting the clan. He and one of the mothers also find themselves sharing an attraction. Writing in The New York Times, A. O. Scott called Ms. Cholodenko's film, which she wrote with Stuart Blumberg, ''canny in its insights'' and ''agile in its negotiation of complex emotions,'' adding, ''It is outrageously funny without ever exaggerating for comic effect, and heartbreaking with only minimal melodramatic embellishment.'' 8 P.M. (TCM) SITTING PRETTY (1948) In this comedy directed by Walter Lang, Clifton Webb stars as an arrogant genius and a stern but lovable baby sitter for unruly children. The character comes from a novel by Gwen Davenport and was also the basis for a sitcom in 1985.

Freddi was born on July 27th, 1950 and raised in Los Angeles under the Hollywood sign; she graduated from Hollywood High School and UCLA. After an early career as a fundraiser in the Jewish community and then with the family furniture business, she relocated to NYC where she used her extensive knowledge of fine art to start a business as an art consultant. She later co-launched a juvenile bedding company called BananaFish and also served on the board of the Juvenile Products Manufacturing Association. Freddi was a steadfast patron of the arts. She loved contemporary and fine art, theater and jazz in particular. She was a true product of her family's extraordinary and generous philanthropic leadership. She was active in the Los Angeles Federation and served on the board of the Furniture Division of the LA Jewish Federation. Ultimately she joined the national Young Womens Leadership Cabinet of the UJA. When she came to New York, her philanthropy continued on the Federation Distribution Committee, and then the board of Dorot. She became President of Dorot three years ago, actively steering Dorot while battling her illness; she was recently reelected to another term as President.

2011-07-28T21:40:03Z,"In 1965, in an impoverished rural county in the Mississippi Delta, the pioneering physician Jack Geiger helped found one of the nation’s first community health centers. Many of the children Geiger treated were seriously malnourished, so he began writing “prescriptions” for food — stipulating quantities of milk, vegetables, meat, and fruit that could be “filled” at grocery stores, which were instructed to send the bills to the health center, where they were paid out of the pharmacy budget. When word of this reached the Office of Economic Opportunity in Washington, which financed the center, an official was dispatched to Mississippi to reprimand Geiger and make sure he understood that the center’s money could be used only for medical purposes. Geiger replied: “The last time I looked in my textbooks, the specific therapy for malnutrition was food.” The official had nothing to say and returned to Washington.In some ways, the United States has come a long way since Lyndon Johnson declared the “war on poverty.” But in others, we’re still at square one. We now have a variety of federally-supported nutrition programs, but the health care system remains senselessly disconnected from the “social determinants of health.” In this regard, the United States has fallen behind the rest of the world. If a politician in India announced a public health plan that neglected malnutrition, he would be ridiculed. Here, leaders make this kind of omission all the time. Almost all of the debate about the 2010 Affordable Care Act was consumed with questions about health care access and quality. But if we really want to improve the health of millions of people, we have to address the conditions that make them sick."

The photographer Juergen Teller visited Kiev three times in five months for the project, and the photos he took on these trips speak to the extraordinary wealth he saw there. Teller’s view of Kiev is steeped in the language of fashion and excess — models, hair, makeup, styling — and interspersed with more candid snaps of everyday scenes."

2011-07-28T16:37:55Z,"Hideki Irabu, the former Yankees pitcher who struggled to live up to grand expectations after coming over from Japan, was found dead in Los Angeles on Thursday. He was 42. Police are investigating Irabu’s death as a possible suicide, according to various reports. Irabu came to the United States in 1997 billed as one of Japan’s premier right-handed pitchers. The Padres owned his rights, but Irabu refused to play for any team but the Yankees. San Diego traded him to the Yankees, who signed him to a four-year, $12.8 million contract. His career began with such promise, when he struck out nine and allowed two runs as the Yankees defeated Detroit in his major league debut, on July 10, 1997. That start proved the highlight of the season. He was banished to the bullpen and the minor leagues, and he finished the year 5-4 with a 7.09 earned run average. In 1999, Steinbrenner erupted after Irabu failed to cover first base during an exhibition game, calling him a fat toad.   In three seasons with the Yankees, Irabu was 29-20 and pitched in only one postseason game, when he came out of the bullpen to allow eight runs to the Red Sox in Game 3 of the 1999 American League Championship Series. Two months later, Irabu was traded to Montreal, where he started 14 games over 2000 and 2001, before finishing his career with Texas in 2002. He retired in 2004 after pitching two seasons for the Hanshin Tigers in Japan."

Klosterman notes that “all of these series grapple with morality — more than anything else, it’s the reason they’re better than the shows around them.” But he argues that “the first three examples all create realities where individual agency is detached” and questions of personal moral choice aren’t foregrounded: “Mad Men” because it’s set in the 1960s, making its characters’ actions more a “commentary on the era” than a window into their souls, “The Wire” because it’s “more political than philosophical,” bent on constantly emphasizing the way “everyone is simultaneously good and bad” in order to offer a critique of American society as a whole, and “The Sopranos” because the fact all its major characters were involved with organized crime and its protagonist murdered people for money meant that there were never any unresolved questions over Tony Soprano’s ‘goodness.'” (We knew he was “fundamentally bad,” Klosterman argues, because “otherwise he couldn’t exist as the person he was.”)"

(HBO Signature) WALL STREET: MONEY NEVER SLEEPS (2010) Michael Douglas returns as the reptilian financier Gordon Gekko, who, after serving an eight-year prison sentence, has landed in the public spotlight once again for writing a critical and prescient book about the state of the markets. Shia LaBeouf (above right, with Mr. Douglas) is the investment banker Jake Moore, one of Gekko's fans -- and the live-in love of Gekko's estranged daughter (Carey Mulligan). Frank Langella is the old-school broker who has been like a father to Jake. And Josh Brolin is the newest snake in town. Let the games resume.

To the question 'What went wrong?' the film offers an answer that is both irrefutable and unsatisfying: human nature.'' And yet, Mr. Scott added, something vital here works. Oliver Stone, the film's director, ''is not the man to explain Wall Street, or to stoke public indignation at its crimes,'' he said. ''But no one else could turn it into a show like 'Wall Street.'

He is lifting a heavy red drape and gesturing as if inviting us to visit the marvels within. Beyond the curtain we glimpse walls lined with hundreds of glass cases, each containing stuffed birds. We see visitors strolling past, engaged in contemplation or struck with amazement. We also spot part of a mastodon skeleton, discovered in 1801 by the same man who lifts the curtain. He is the image's painter, Charles Willson Peale. And he is welcoming us into the museum he created in early-19th-century Philadelphia."

But because the vestiges of the community were buried beneath the park, the leaders of the Institute for the Exploration of Seneca Village History -- a consortium of three professors from City College, Barnard College and New York University -- were kept from doing the one thing that would open a window onto the daily existence of the some 260 residents: digging."

Having combed through the museum's records, officials there said they believed that this would be the first time the Met has stayed open so late. The exhibition, which chronicles the work of the British fashion designer who committed suicide last year at age 40, opened on May 4, and its galleries have been mobbed ever since, with people sometimes waiting in lines for two hours. The museum has already extended the duration of the show twice, given access to members earlier in the day and offered $50 tickets to visitors who want to come on Mondays, when the museum is normally closed. But it is not able to keep the show up past Aug. 7 because taking it down will be a complicated and lengthy process and it needs to clear the galleries to begin installing ''Wonder of the Age: Master Painters of India, 1100-1900,'' which opens on Sept. 28."

2011-07-28T00:00:00Z,"FINEGOOD--Freddi Sue, who called both Los Angeles and New York home, died peacefully at her home in New York late Monday night after a long illness. Freddi was an amazing human being who had an enormous impact on the lives of many. Beloved wife of Ethan Horwitz, devoted daughter of Rae Finegood and the late Dave Finegood, loving and proud mother of Emily, Matt, Jessica and Jason and grandmother of Liba Shifra, much loved sister of the late Danny Finegood and sister-in-law of Bonnie Finegood, Brenda and Abbey Horwitz and adoring aunt of Matthew, Natalie, Michael, Shayna, and Jonathan. With her warmth and generosity of spirit, Freddi had a very large number of devoted friends, all of whom join her family in the terrible sense of loss. Freddi was born on July 27th, 1950 and raised in Los Angeles under the Hollywood sign; she graduated from Hollywood High School and UCLA. After an early career as a fundraiser in the Jewish community and then with the family furniture business, she relocated to NYC where she used her extensive knowledge of fine art to start a business as an art consultant. She later co-launched a juvenile bedding company called BananaFish and also served on the board of the Juvenile Products Manufacturing Association. Freddi was a steadfast patron of the arts. She loved contemporary and fine art, theater and jazz in particular. She was a true product of her family's extraordinary and generous philanthropic leadership. She was active in the Los Angeles Federation and served on the board of the Furniture Division of the LA Jewish Federation. Ultimately she joined the national Young Womens Leadership Cabinet of the UJA. When she came to New York, her philanthropy continued on the Federation Distribution Committee, and then the board of Dorot. She became President of Dorot three years ago, actively steering Dorot while battling her illness; she was recently reelected to another term as President. No one loved life and her family and friends more than Freddi. She will be truly missed. The Funeral will be at 11am on Thursday, July 28th at Plaza Jewish Community Chapel, 630 Amsterdam Avenue, between 90th and 91st Street. In lieu of flowers, donations in Freddi's memory can be made to Dorot at 171 West 85th Street, NY, NY 10024 or at www.dorotusa.org or to the Institute for Myeloma and Bone Cancer Research at 9201 Sunset Blvd, Suite 300, West Hollywood, CA 90069."

He once created a half-eaten carcass of a killer whale and laid it across a monstrous crumpled-up ice floe — a piece so well done, critics said, it could be a natural history museum display. So how does Swenson fit in here with our downtown playlist, brought to you by Sean Hanratty? Hanratty chose Swenson for The Jam’s fifth installment not only because of their shared Texan roots but also because, he says, “I’ve always been so intrigued with the sort of fantastical nature of his work and materials. I knew his playlist would contain a lot of classic songs with a very strong backbone.”"

The blog contains plenty of great (sometimes Bittman-esque) recipes — for grilled pizza, say, or minty peas (and also Manhattans) — and if you have any interest in the cooking or eating of food, it won’t disappoint. But it also occasionally contains book recommendations for kids. Usually, the suggestions come from Jenny’s daughters or from her husband, Andy. But in the past few weeks, something amazing has been going on over at DALS. The recommendations are coming from authors, and not just any authors, but some of the greatest children’s lit (or any lit) writers alive. Here is Pseudonymous Bosch’s summer reading list, for instance. And here are the recommendations made by Lemony Snicket (a k a Daniel Handler, who was the subject of this profile in our magazine back in 2001). And here is the summer reading list provided by George Saunders, whose genius is impossible to overstate and whose name popped up on our own great-fiction list just a couple weeks ago. Maybe once we finish contemplating our favorite sentences (and by the way, speaking of George Saunders, there are many amazing sentences in his most recent short story in the New Yorker), we’ll move on to our own subjective rankings of children’s books.

In Whistler, if a bear doesn’t get into something humans are guarding, it’s usually because too many other bears got there first.”"

2011-07-29T00:00:00Z,"STEVENS--Tony. 63, director, choreographer, teacher, and dancer of extraordinary talent passed away July 12 of Hodgkins Lymphoma. Beloved by his peers and students, Stevens danced in over ten Broadway shows in the 1960's and 70's and was seen on every major television variety show filmed in New York. He then began choreographing, working with Peter Gennaro, Gower Champion, Michael Bennett, as well as Bob Fosse on the original landmark musical '' Chicago''. When Fosse became ill and ''Chicago'' rehearsals were postponed, Fred Ebb conceived the club act ''Chita Plus Two'' for Chita Rivera, including Tony and Christopher Chadman. What started out as a modest venture, overnight became the hottest act to hit New York. They played Las Vegas, Miami, and Los Angeles and it became the standard for all other acts that followed. In 1974, frustrated with how dancers were treated, Tony and Michon Peacock organized a couple of all-night taped talk sessions in which dancers shared their experiences about their lives and professions. With Michael Bennett's involvement, that material eventually became ''A Chorus Line''. Tony choreographed television specials for Mary Tyler Moore, Disney, and The Peoples Choice Awards. Movies he choreographed include ''The Great Gatsby'' and ''The Best Little Whorehouse In Texas''. He directed and/or choreographed for Bernadette Peters, Dolly Parton, Betty Buckley, Liza Minnelli, Joel Grey, Gene Kelly, and Debbie Reynolds, and was a highly respected teacher in New York. His love and support for show business and everyone in it was legendary. He is survived by his sister and brother-in-law Sharon and Fred Gray, niece and husband Lisa and Phil Rothweiler, great niece and nephew Stacy and Nick Rothweiler, his companion Nathan Samson, and hundreds of friends on Broadway, where his light will shine forever. Donations in his memory may be made to The Dancers Resource at the Actors Fund, 729 Seventh Avenue, New York, NY. 10036."

2011-07-29T00:00:00Z,"ALTMAN--R. Peter, MD. We are deeply saddened by the loss of our dear friend and colleague Dr. R. Peter Altman, the Rudolph N. Schullinger Professor Emeritus of Pediatric Surgery (in Surgery and Pediatrics) at Columbia University College of Physicians and Surgeons. A beloved member of the New York-Presbyterian/ Columbia community for more than thirty years, Dr. Altman made many important contributions to the care of infants and children. During his extraordinary career, he held several leadership positions, including Physician-in-Chief for the New York-Presbyterian Children's Health System and Surgeon-in-Chief at Morgan Stanley Children's Hospital. He played a major role in the development of Morgan Stanley Children's Hospital, from conceptualization to completion and beyond. A distinguished clinician and researcher, he introduced a surgical technique to correct the fatal congenital liver condition biliary atresia, helping numerous children live into adulthood. A leader in pediatric surgical education, he mentored scores of fellows who went on to have distinguished careers. We remember Dr. Altman for his wry wit and his serious commitment to helping children and their families. Our heartfelt condolences are extended to his wife, Hanna; sons Robert and James; four grandchildren; sister, Linda; and the entire Altman family.

But then I saw that John Stott had died, and I didn’t want to miss the chance to write about him and evangelicals more broadly — hence my Sunday column on the subject. We in the op-ed world don’t write about religion perhaps as much as we should: it’s a huge force shaping society and policy, and yet rarely makes the op-ed pages. And evangelicals in particular, especially serious ones, tend to be neglected since there are so few evangelicals in major news organizations. About one-third of America is evangelical, yet you’d be hard pressed to find many (with the exception of black evangelicals, whose politics are very different from white evangelicals) in leading news organizations."

She was born in Stary Sacz, Poland to Antoni and Kunegunda (Pasiut) Uczkiewicz. After surviving World War II, she enrolled at the Wroclaw Medical University in Wroclaw, Poland, where she met her future husband, Marian Orlowski, a Holocaust survivor, during a class on anatomy. They shared a love of hiking in the Tatra Mountains with their friends, and defied convention by marrying despite being of different faiths. When they completed their degrees they both started on careers in medical research, but Jadwiga put hers on hold to raise their son, Robert. The family immigrated to America, where Jadwiga cried at her first sight of a supermarket after having endured years of hardship under Communist rule. Later, she returned to a medical career by finishing her training in physical medicine and rehabilitation at Mount Sinai in New York. She expressed her passion for humanity by caring for patients with spinal cord injuries before retiring. This devotion was also evident in her care for Marian after he fell ill from a form of Alzheimer dementia, which allowed him to die with dignity at home on July 16, 2009. Jadwiga loved and tended all manner of living things, including her orchids, all animals, and especially her family and the people around her, whom she would feed with old-world dishes and baked goods that were unrivaled by any. Many of her last months were spent doing the same for Robert and his wife Carol, and their four-legged child Lucy. She is survived by her son Robert and daughter-in-law Carol of Bellaire, Texas, and her sister-in-law Sabina Sass of New York, New York. A viewing will be held at Walkers Funeral Home (120 West Franklin Street, Chapel Hill, NC 27516, 919-942-3861) on Sunday, July 31st, from 3:00-5:00pm.

Peter Altman, who in 1980 assumed the position as Professor of Surgery of the College of Physicians and Surgeons of Columbia University, and as the Surgeon-in-Chief of the Babies & Children's Hospital of New York (now Morgan Stanley Children's Hospital of NewYork-Presbyterian/ Columbia). Throughout his career, Dr. Altman was committed to improving and advancing the surgical care of infants and children. He wrote extensively for journals and textbooks, and was a visiting professor of pediatric surgery world-wide. His scientific interests centered on hepatobiliary diseases, pediatric surgical oncology, and surgical education. He served as President of the American Pediatric Surgical Association, was a member of the Grant Review Committee of the National Institutes of Health, and consultant to the American Board of Surgery. He was a member of the Graduate Education Committee of the American College of Surgeons and served on the Residency Review Committee for Surgery. Under his guidance more than 40 pediatric surgeons were trained, of whom many are now division chiefs and chairmen. He will be best remembered for the children and families who benefited from his advocacy and care. His successor, Dr. Charles Stolar, described Dr. Altman as one of the most influential pediatric surgeons in modern times. Dr. Stolar states, ""He was the consummate mentor, teacher, and friend."" Our condolences to his loving wife, Hanna, and extended family. Craig R. Smith, MD, Chairman Columbia University Department of Surgery NewYork-Presbyterian/ Columbia University MedicalCenter"
2011-07-30T00:00:00Z,"Here are the kinds of questions that keep ''Game of Thrones'' fans up at night. (You might want to have a pencil and paper handy for this one.) The first season of that Emmy-nominated HBO drama was, more or less, a straight adaptation of the George R. R. Martin fantasy novel ''A Game of Thrones,'' the first book in his ''Song of Ice and Fire'' series. To date, Mr. Martin has published four more books in his planned seven-book series: ''A Clash of Kings,'' ''A Storm of Swords,'' ''A Feast for Crows'' and, most recently, ''A Dance with Dragons.'' The elapsed time between ''Crows'' (released in 2005) and ''Dragons'' (released earlier this month) was nearly six years. Even if we allow that the television adaptations of some of these novels could require more than one season, is it possible that the ''Game of Thrones'' HBO series could run out of material before Mr. Martin has finished writing the books?"

Mr. Rylance, who last month won a Tony Award for his portrayal of a hard-living quasi-mystical itinerant man in the Jez Butterworth play ''Jerusalem,'' has given away that trophy to a British man who helped inspire his performance. The Independent of London reported that the new owner of Mr. Rylance's Tony Award is Mickey Lay, a 71-year-old builder and resident of Pewsey, a village west of London which inspired the setting for ''Jerusalem,'' and with whom Mr. Rylance consulted in creating the character of Johnny ''Rooster'' Byron, the caravan-dwelling ex-daredevil at the heart of the play."

The cache of original treatments, annotated scripts, photographs, journals, notes, video recordings and film includes 64 storyboards from ''Rebel Without a Cause,'' which starred James Dean, Sal Mineo and Natalie Wood.

2011-07-30T00:00:00Z,"8 P.M. (HBO) THE TOWN (2010) Ben Affleck, above with Blake Lively, crops his hair and drops his R's in this crime drama, which he directed, wrote (with Peter Craig and Aaron Stockard) and stars in. He plays Doug MacRay, a bank robber from the Charlestown section of Boston who wants nothing more than to get out of the game -- if only his best friend, Jim (Jeremy Renner), who is also his surrogate brother and stickup partner, would let him. With a father (Chris Cooper) serving a life sentence in the penitentiary, Doug has added incentive. But then a heist goes wrong, and a young bank teller (Rebecca Hall) is taken hostage. Jim wants to deal with her before she talks to the law. Instead, after she is freed, Doug starts dating her. The sequence in which the crew knocks over the bank, ''like most of the other action set pieces in the film, is lean, brutal and efficient, and evidence of Mr. Affleck's skill and self-confidence as a director,'' A. O. Scott wrote in The New York Times. The romantic development, on the other hand, ''is perhaps meant to heighten the emotional intensity of his predicament but instead disrupts the film's tough mood with sentimental preposterousness.'' Still, ''the performances in 'The Town' are strong enough to make it watchable, and the sense of place -- of topography and architecture, if not of actual social life -- is vivid and enjoyable. A climactic caper at Fenway Park blows holes in the film's narrative and emotional credibility, but it is fast and exciting all the same, perhaps especially for Yankees fans. Otherwise, the main attraction is the blaring music of those accents. It's a lark, a spark, a walk in the park.'' 10 A.M.

2011-07-31T00:00:00Z,"FULLER--Blair Fairchild, passed away in Petaluma, California, on July 23rd at the age of 84. A Paris Review editor since shortly after the publication's founding, and co-founder of the Squaw Valley Community of Writers, Blair made his home in San Francisco in the early 1960s when he took up a teaching position in Stanford's Creative Writing Department. Still, his family and literary roots remained in New York. He was born to sculptor Jane Sage White Fuller and architect Charles Fairchild Fuller in Bedford, NY on January 18, 1927, and his stepfather was Harper and Row publisher Cass Canfield. His novels and short stories were shaped by his experiences working for Texaco in West Africa in the 1950s, his World War II service in the U.S. Navy, his year in Algeria as a Fulbright Professor. His recent work consisted in short personal memoirs, the last of which - ""An Evening with J.D. Salinger"" appeared on the Paris Review blog in February. Blair is survived by his wife, Arlene Hogan Fuller; his sisters, Sage Fuller Cowles and Jill Fuller Fox; his stepbrother, Cass Canfield Jr.; and his children from earlier marriages: Maria Gubiena Fuller, Anthony Blair Fuller, and Diana Whitney Fuller."

Poland, which holds the rotating presidency of the European Union, said on Friday that sports ministers from 27 nations who are due to meet in October will debate the issue of ''good governance,'' a theme provoked by ongoing corruption allegations involving FIFA."
2011-07-31T00:00:00Z,"Orlowska--Jadwiga Stanislawa M.D.,died on July 26, 2011, at the age of 84 in Chapel Hill, North Carolina. She was born in Stary Sacz, Poland to Antoni and Kunegunda (Pasiut) Uczkiewicz. After surviving World War II, she enrolled at the Wroclaw Medical University in Wroclaw, Poland, where she met her future husband, Marian Orlowski, a Holocaust survivor, during a class on anatomy. They shared a love of hiking in the Tatra Mountains with their friends, and defied convention by marrying despite being of different faiths. When they completed their degrees they both started on careers in medical research, but Jadwiga put hers on hold to raise their son, Robert. The family immigrated to America, where Jadwiga cried at her first sight of a supermarket after having endured years of hardship under Communist rule. Later, she returned to a medical career by finishing her training in physical medicine and rehabilitation at Mount Sinai in New York. She expressed her passion for humanity by caring for patients with spinal cord injuries before retiring. This devotion was also evident in her care for Marian after he fell ill from a form of Alzheimer dementia, which allowed him to die with dignity at home on July 16, 2009. Jadwiga loved and tended all manner of living things, including her orchids, all animals, and especially her family and the people around her, whom she would feed with old-world dishes and baked goods that were unrivaled by any. Many of her last months were spent doing the same for Robert and his wife Carol, and their four-legged child Lucy. She is survived by her son Robert and daughter-in-law Carol of Bellaire, Texas, and her sister-in-law Sabina Sass of New York, New York. A viewing will be held at Walkers Funeral Home (120 West Franklin Street, Chapel Hill, NC 27516, 919-942-3861) on Sunday, July 31st, from 3:00-5:00pm.

2011-07-31T00:00:00Z,"An article on July 17about Representative KevinMcCarthy, the House majoritywhip, misstated the level of cutsin government spending relativeto gross domestic product asproposed in the legislation passedby the House of Representativesin April.

According to the judge, the documents proved that unintended acceleration in certain vehicles could have been caused by electromagnetic interference with those vehicles' cruise control systems. There was ''clear and convincing evidence'' that Ford engaged in ''misconduct'' in an attempt to keep information from the jury and influence the outcome of last year's trial, wrote Judge William T. Swigert of the Circuit Court of the Fifth Judicial Circuit for Sumter County."
2011-07-31T00:00:00Z,"Here's a reader's comment about Dave Kehr's Video column about the 1968 movie ''Skidoo,'' a psychedelic generation-gap comedy by Otto Preminger that has just been released on DVD. Groucho Marx played God in the film. ''I was delighted that Mr. Kehr reviewed 'Skidoo,' one of my favorite wannabe countercultural films of the late 1960s. But I'd like to point out that, contrary to conventional Hollywood practices then, Preminger cast the path-breaking African-American fashion model Donyale Luna as God's mistress, with no references whatsoever to her race. Seeing the angular Luna (in a part originally written for Faye Dunaway) flirt and more with Groucho, John Phillip Law, Frankie Avalon and Cesar Romero was clearly part of Preminger's subliminal 'romantic revolt' in the film.''"
2011-07-31T00:00:00Z,"The Ghost Hunter has Louis Vuitton floor mats, and this I did not expect. He arrives at my building in a customized white Mitsubishi Eclipse with a sound system that's Madison-Square-Garden-loud and a TV hidden in the dash. It's less Ghostmobile, more getaway car. I'd forgotten that, esoteric hobbies aside, the Ghost Hunter was born and raised in Brooklyn. And like a lot of guys from Bergen Beach, he loves his car. It is 10:07 p.m. and we are barreling across the Verrazano-Narrows Bridge to Staten Island. The sky above is as black as devil's food cake. It's also the Fourth of July, which says a lot about our respective social lives, the Ghost Hunter's and mine."
2011-07-31T00:00:00Z,"Michael Phelps won his third gold medal of the swimming world championships Saturday in Shanghai, breezing to a victory in the 100-meter butterfly in 50.71 seconds. So far, Phelps has three golds, two silvers and a bronze with one more event to go -- the 4x100 medley relay Sunday, the final night of competition. ''In all, it's been an O.K. week,'' Phelps said. Melissa Franklin, 16, of the United States continued a breakout performance. She won the 200 backstroke, the first major individual gold of her career, and swam the anchor leg as the United States won the gold medal in the 4x100 medley relay for the first time since 1998. Franklin has three golds and five medals in all. ''I totally made sure I came in here and left everything in the pool, and I did,'' Franklin said. ''I'm thrilled.''"
2011-07-31T00:00:00Z,"A picture caption on July 17 with an article about Gerard Mortier, artistic director of the Teatro Real in Madrid, misidentified one of the performers in the six-hour opera he staged in a sports arena outside the city. And a correction in this space last Sunday misspelled part of the name of the opera. It was Alejandro Marco-Buhrmester -- not Wiard Witholt -- who performed in ''St. François d'Assise,'' not ''St. Françoise d'Assise.''"

In honor of rose season at the garden, which started last month and goes through October, The Moment asked him to weigh in on a favorite imposter, the Shakespeare in Love fragrance from A Dozen Roses. ''A lot of David Austin English roses today are bred for scent,'' Mr. Kukielski said. ''I could see this being one of those roses. It's very sweet. It is much more in your face. It has the Damask essence with a combination of some really nice fruity smells, which I mentioned before and which again in my mind are in the rose family. I like the Shakespeare scent because it allows me to remember all of the roses I've smelled in my career.'' It's $95 for 3.4 ounces at select Neiman Marcus locations. HOLLY SIEGEL"

2011-07-31T00:00:00Z,"IS there a creature as imaginative or as indefatigable as the city child in search of a place to play? New York would seem to have been designed for everything but youthful frolic. And, to be sure, it can hold great perils. Yet from generation to generation, ever since children sang ''Ring Around the Rosie'' and ''London Bridge Is Falling Down,'' the sidewalks of New York have yielded to youngsters' inexhaustible need to frisk, exult, screech, plot and plunge."

2011-07-31T00:00:00Z,"In 1965, in an impoverished rural county in the Mississippi Delta, the pioneering physician Jack Geiger helped found one of the nation's first community health centers. Many of the children Geiger treated were seriously malnourished, so he began writing ''prescriptions'' for food - stipulating quantities of milk, vegetables, meat, and fruit that could be ''filled'' at grocery stores, which were instructed to send the bills to the health center, where they were paid out of the pharmacy budget. When word of this reached the Office of Economic Opportunity in Washington, which financed the center, an official was dispatched to Mississippi to reprimand Geiger and make sure he understood that the center's money could be used only for medical purposes. Geiger replied: ''The last time I looked in my textbooks, the specific therapy for malnutrition was food.'' The official had nothing to say and returned to Washington.In some ways, the United States has come a long way since Lyndon Johnson declared the ''war on poverty.'' But in others, we're still at square one. We now have a variety of federally-supported nutrition programs, but the health care system remains senselessly disconnected from the ''social determinants of health.'' In this regard, the United States has fallen behind the rest of the world. If a politician in India announced a public health plan that neglected malnutrition, he would be ridiculed. Here, leaders make this kind of omission all the time. Almost all of the debate about the 2010 Affordable Care Act was consumed with questions about health care access and quality. But if we really want to improve the health of millions of people, we have to address the conditions that make them sick. One of the most impressive organizations in the country that is developing an approach to do this is Health Leads, which mobilizes and trains about 1000 volunteers each year who staff resource desks located in the waiting rooms of 23 hospital clinics or health centers in Baltimore, Boston, Chicago, New York, Providence, R.I., and Washington. At these sites, doctors now regularly ''prescribe'' a wide range of basic resources - like food assistance, housing improvements, or heating fuel subsidies - which Health Leads' volunteers ''fill'' - applying their problem solving skills (and tenacity) to identify resources anywhere they may be available."
2011-07-31T00:00:00Z,"FRANKFURTBMW'S designers and engineers have long vowed that the company's eventual battery-powered cars would not be geekmobiles but true BMWs, with all the zip, handling and style that the German automaker is known for. Norbert Reithofer, the chief executive, is fond of saying that an environmentally friendly auto should not be ''a vow of poverty on wheels.'' BMW fans can soon decide for themselves whether the company has delivered on its promise. On Friday in Frankfurt, BMW unveiled working prototypes of the i8, a plug-in hybrid sport coupe that will carry a six-figure price tag, and the i3, a four-seat battery-powered compact car aimed at a wider market."
2011-07-31T00:00:00Z,"YOU can learn a lot about Dalston, a district in East London, from the storefront for the Mr. Bagel restaurant. On one side, a bright orange sign announces, ''We do Indian and Caribbean food.'' Opposite, Arabic script spells out the word ''halal.'' A traditionally Jewish area, this remote pocket of East London has, in recent years, begun absorbing immigrants from around the globe, transforming it into a multiethnic working-class enclave. Now, thanks in part to the recent extension of the London Overground rail lines -- which added two new stations in the formerly hard-to-reach neighborhood -- Dalston is welcoming its latest wave of new arrivals: young creative types and self-styled bohemians in search of cheap rents and a lively vibe. The result is a new crop of cafes, bars and boutiques that are worth a visit. SETH SHERWOOD"

Travelers can print tickets at home or pick them up at a kiosk at the train station."
2011-07-31T00:00:00Z,"SUSPICIOUS fires, pregnant pauses and empty streets dominate Gregory Crewdson's photographs, which expose the dark side of Norman Rockwell's America to a ''Twilight Zone'' glow. These images are the centerpiece of ''In a Lonely Place'' (Abrams; $40), a new book that for the first time binds three of the artist's most hallucinogenic series in an evocative album format. The pictures in ''Beneath the Roses'' (2003-8) show the influence of Edward Hopper and David Lynch on Mr. Crewdson's approach to psychological menace. Each suggests a crime scene in which estranged, befuddled or naked suburbanites figure as the locus of paranormal events. The documentary, black-and-white images in ''Sanctuary'' (2009), shot in the abandoned back lots of the Cinecittà film studio in Rome, portray a landscape of neglect as haunted by its neo-realist past. And no less fraught is the nocturnal ''Fireflies'' (1996), although this time the demons are mating Tinker Bells fighting the darkness. LINDA YABLONSKY"

Perez, 41, played in the majors as recently as 2006, but the lessons he took from his television producers have come in just as handy as anything he learned as a player. ''Be able to say what you want to say, right off the bat, in that first sentence,'' Perez said, referring to his on-air technique. ''Make the impact in that first sentence and then explain why. And I take the same approach with the players. I tell them exactly what it is at the beginning and then I explain to them why. I think it really hits them, and they get it right away.

Now, after dipping her toes into fashion with illustrations for Erin Wasson's RVCA campaign and the titles for a Missoni film by Kenneth Anger, Ms. Penner has introduced Mombi, a line of dresses named for a witch in L. Frank Baum's Oz series. Created with her friend the designer and stylist Katie Casey, Mombi came into being when the photographer David Mushegain asked Ms. Penner to participate in a pop-up shop for his ''Don't Call It Cool'' show of California youth culture at Colette in Paris. She needed something that could fit in a suitcase. That led to Cosmic Love and Sail '77, two whisper-light chiffon frocks digitally printed with Ms. Penner's intricate prismatic collages.

Recently, I began to wonder what fuel writers have relied on, and the answers turned out to be all over the culinary map. Walt Whitman began the day with oysters and meat, while Gustave Flaubert started off with what passed for a light breakfast in his day: eggs, vegetables, cheese or fruit, and a cup of cold chocolate. The novelist Vendela Vida told me she swears by pistachios, and Mark Kurlansky, the author of ''Salt'' and ''Cod,'' likes to write under the influence of espresso, ''as black as possible.'' For some writers, less is more. Lord Byron , a pioneer in fad diets as well as poetry, sipped vinegar to keep his weight down. Julia Scheeres , the author of the memoir ''Jesus Land,'' aims for more temporary deprivation. ''When in the thick of writing I minimize food intake as much as possible,'' she told me.

2011-07-31T00:00:00Z,"OK Go, a band as famous for its inventive, choreographed videos as for its power pop music, had another novel concept for its latest video, ''All Is Not Lost'': bodies intertwining atop a glass table, seen from below. Yet when planning the shoot, the four-piece band discovered that it needed more bodies. In what the video director Trish Sie describes as ''a perfect storm of timing,'' OK Go's lead singer, Damian Kulash, got a call from the Pilobolus dance troupe, proposing a collaboration. The resulting video added Pilobolus dancers to the mix, their bodies used to create shapes and letters. Kulash says that having Pilobolus work on the band's concept was ''like asking a superchef to make green beans,'' and Itamar Kubovy, the executive director of Pilobolus, returns the compliment. ''This cool result needed an enormous amount of calculation,'' he says. ''And these OK Go guys led beautifully.'' Year OK Go was formed: 1998.

Mary Misch Newman, 69, of Cambridge, MA, died peacefully of cancer on July 24, 2011, in Polson, Montana, surrounded by her loving family and the serenity of Flathead Lake. Kind, playful and generous of spirit, Mary enjoyed life to the fullest until the very end. She died with the same rare grace and strength with which she lived. Mary was born in Manhattan in 1941 to Robert and Janet Misch. Educated at Dalton and Riverdale Country School, she graduated from Mount Holyoke College in 1963 and earned masters degrees from Bank Street and NYU School of Social Work. A lifelong leader in education, Mary began her career as founder of an international high school in Jakarta, Indonesia. In 1980, she became Director of the Churchill School and Center and then in 1986, Head of The Town School, both in Manhattan. In 1992, Mary was named Head of School at Buckingham Browne & Nichols in Cambridge where she played a critical role in integrating faculty and curriculum across three campuses. She was also largely responsible for rebuilding the upper school campus and for establishing partnerships with Boston institutions, including the Museum of Fine Arts. She was committed to fostering a sense of creativity, self-expression and wonder among children. Mary retired briefly in 2001, returning in 2003 to head Cambridge Friends School, where she again united a community committed to diversity, respect and social justice and built a foundation for future success. Her success in leading four different schools stemmed from her profound faith in the unlimited capacity of children and a deep respect for teachers as professionals. These values permeated the vision and culture of each institution. Mary served on the boards of the Cambridge Community Foundation, Shady Hill School, Breakthrough for Children, Primary Source, Early Steps and Prospect Hill Academy. Above all, Mary was a magnificent human being. The same qualities that enabled her to build and lead schools infused her relationships with family and friends. Her deep sense of caring, respect for differences, and ability to bring out the best in everyone drew people together and created enduring ties. Mary was the one to whom family, friends and colleagues turned for guidance, nurturing and inspiration. Mary is survived by her beloved daughters Sara (Doug Sovern) and Emily (John Darrah) and their father John, her life partner Ted Smith, sister Katherine Koritzinsky (Allan), granddaughters Maxine and Sadie Newmann Darrah, niece Carolyn Fertig (Matt), nephew Bradley Koritzinsky (Keren) and grandnephews Jacob and Cameron Fertig and Yaniv Koritzinsky. A Celebration of Mary's Life will be held September 24 at 3:30pm at First Parish Unitarian Universalist Church in Cambridge. Contributions may be made in Mary's memory to enrich the lives of students and teachers to Cambridge Friends School for the Mary Newmann Student Enrichment Fund or to Buckingham Browne & Nichols for the Mary Newmann Faculty Fund."

2011-07-31T00:00:00Z,"Which adjective best describes Ruben Amaro, the general manager of the Philadelphia Phillies. Ruthless? Relentless? Both work pretty well. Amaro made another significant trade on Friday, acquiring the two-time All-Star outfielder Hunter Pence from the Houston Astros for three minor leaguers and a player to be named later. - Since July 2009, Amaro has now used the farm system to acquire Cliff Lee, Roy Halladay, Roy Oswalt and Pence. During that time he also traded Lee to re-stock the farm system, a move that backfired badly and seems to have taught Amaro a lesson, on some level. Ever since, he's been all in, all the time -- championship or bust. Yes, Amaro was raised in Philadelphia.-The Phillies badly needed Pence. Their offense looked frail this week against two ghosts from last October, Matt Cain and Tim Lincecum of the Carlos Beltran-fortified San Francisco Giants. The Phillies were clearly too left-handed, too susceptible to the kind of dominant lefty relievers they should see in October, like Javier Lopez and Jeremy Affeldt of the Giants or Jonny Venters and Eric O'Flaherty of the Atlanta Braves. Pence has a .290 career average against lefties - exactly the same as his mark against righties."

Tiant had a singular flair, with a spinning, gyrating delivery, but if any pitcher comes close today, it is Cueto. For Cueto, a Cincinnati Reds right-hander, the style is working. He had a 1.88 earned run average through his first 15 starts, in the last several of which he has used Tiant-style mechanics. Working from the windup, Cueto lifts his left leg and turns his shoulders to center field, so the hitter sees the 47 on his jersey, but not his face. Then he uncoils toward the batter, somehow picks up the catcher's target and fires."

If you don't recall the TC, it was a mid-'80s Chrysler LeBaron with a Maserati trident. That mongrel gave opera windows a bad name, which is saying something. The TC is a cautionary tale of mashups gone wrong, and it's relevant because Fiat Group, which owns Chrysler and Maserati, is readying another Maserati with American roots: an S.U.V. based on the platform shared by the Jeep Grand Cherokee and Dodge Durango.

2011-07-31T00:00:00Z,"STEIN--Howard, 84, passed away very peacefully at home in Southampton, NY, on July 26th. He is survived by Janet Stein, his beloved wife of 52 years, and by his five daughters and their families including his six granddaughters. Born in Brooklyn, NY, Howard worked in financial services, eventually joining The Dreyfus Corporation where he became chairman and CEO. With many innovations to his credit including some of the first money market and municipal bond funds as well as groundbreaking marketing and advertising strategies, Howard was considered one of the founders of the modern mutual fund industry. A quiet, even shy man of great vision, Howard was known for his keen intuition and his deep insight into the human spirit. He challenged those around him to reach beyond the traditional and the mundane and he insisted that complicated information be distilled into clear and concise ideas. His intense focus and determination helped turn those ideas into meaningful action. His remarkable sense of timing ensured that action was often taken at the perfect moment. Fascinated with the creative side of business, Howard had a lifelong interest in the arts and sciences. He was an avid gardener, spending many happy hours tending his seaside plantings on Long Island. He supported pioneering research in medicine. He came to love photography and assembled a notable collection spanning early masterworks and contemporary, experimental images. Howard's collection became the basis for his charitable foundation, Joy of Giving Something, Inc., which focuses on photography and video as an aid to education, social awareness and societal transformation. Over twenty years, Howard generously and selflessly helped to establish, support and nurture the careers of many artists in the field. Howard was an optimist who deeply believed in our ability to shape our future for the better. He inspired many around him to feel the same way. That may be his greatest legacy. He will be greatly missed by his family and his friends and associates. In lieu of flowers, donations may be made to Joy of Giving Something, Inc., 954 Lexington Avenue, Box #"

Yet when planning the shoot, the four-piece band discovered that it needed more bodies. In what the video director Trish Sie describes as ''a perfect storm of timing,'' OK Go's lead singer, Damian Kulash, got a call from the Pilobolus dance troupe, proposing a collaboration. The resulting video added Pilobolus dancers to the mix, their bodies used to create shapes and letters. Kulash says that having Pilobolus work on the band's concept was ''like asking a superchef to make green beans,'' and Itamar Kubovy, the executive director of Pilobolus, returns the compliment. ''This cool result needed an enormous amount of calculation,'' he says. ''And these OK Go guys led beautifully.'' Year OK Go was formed: 1998. Studio Albums: ''OK Go'' (2002), ''Oh No'' (2005), ''Of the Blue Color of the Sky'' (2010). YouTube views for all 15 of their videos: 125 million.

2011-08-01T18:11:25Z,"January is often the cruelest month for Broadway box offices, as holiday tourists head home, students go back to school and New Yorkers hibernate from the cold and snow. Last winter the lead producers of the Broadway revival of “Promises, Promises” closed the show on Jan. 2 rather than gamble money on recasting their two stars, Sean Hayes and Kristin Chenoweth, and risk a slide in ticket sales. Those same producers are now behind another Broadway revival, “How to Succeed in Business Without Really Trying,” but they have opted to replace their star, Daniel Radcliffe, who finishes his run as the scheming executive J. Pierrepont Finch on New Year’s Day. Confirming rumors that have been circulating for a couple of weeks, the producers announced on Monday that Mr. Radcliffe (of “Harry Potter” fame) will be succeeded by a lesser-known actor, Darren Criss, who has become popular recently on the Fox series “Glee” playing a gay high school student and show choir member who exudes charisma and self-confidence. In casting Mr. Criss the producers are seeking to appeal to at least some of the teenagers, women and gay men who often mob Mr. Radcliffe at the stage door after performances. Mr. Criss is scheduled for only a three-week engagement, Jan. 3 through 22. In their statement announcing Mr. Criss the producers did not say if they plan to cast another actor after him, close the $8.5 million production after he departs, or try to extend his run. A spokesman for the musical said the producers had not made decisions about the future of the show after the Criss run."

2011-08-01T00:00:00Z,"OLSON--Martha, who lived in both New York City and Southampton, died peacefully at her New York home surrounded by friends on July 30, 2011 after a long illness. Martha was a proud achiever and built a distinguished career in public relations. She and two partners started a PR firm in St. Louis that was so successful it was acquired by Farley Manning in New York, where she became a Sr. Vice President. She later joined Hill & Knowlton, rising to Sr. Vice President before her retirement. During the course of her career, Martha advised such powerful clients as the Principality of Monaco, Mexico's Department of Tourism (supervising the launch of Cancun), the Virgin Islands, Anheuser-Busch, E. I. du Pont de Nemours, Pet Milk and Chevron Chemical. Her hands-on style and creative ideas earned her major industry awards, including the Prisms Award presented by the Los Angeles chapter of the Public Relations Society of America in 1980, and two years later, she was one of the first women in the country to win the Silver Anvil Award, the highest honor given by the PRSA. Martha Annette Olson was born in Ft. Stockton, Texas on Christmas day 1920, the daughter of Auburn Elizabeth Bransford and John Nels Olson, a Swedish immigrant. She spent her formative years in Parsons, Kansas before moving to St. Louis and finally to New York. In an interview with the St. Louis Post-Dispatch in January 1958 regarding her public relations success, Martha said, ""Speed somehow always seems to have been part of my life."" Indeed she loved life in the fast lane, whether driving one of her low-slung sports convertibles, flying a single-engine plane as a 19-year-old student pilot and later becoming an airport traffic controller, or much later riding her horse, Dusty, in the Hamptons. Martha is survived by her sister and brother-in-law Jean and Joseph Stevens of Montecito, CA and her brother and sister-in-law Jack and Alice Olson of the National Forest north of Tucson, AZ. She is also survived by her close friends and real estate partners Jody Donohue and Etta Froio, and her beloved Wirehaired Fox Terrier Bentley, named for one of her flashy fast cars she loved to drive."

2011-08-01T00:00:00Z,"Smurfs humiliated a cluster of Hollywood's heaviest weights at the weekend box office. Analysts had predicted that ''Cowboys & Aliens'' - starring Daniel Craig and Harrison Ford, directed by Jon Favreau (''Iron Man'') and produced by Brian Grazer and Steven Spielberg - would easily dominate ticket sales. Instead, it was a photo finish with ''The Smurfs,'' a cartoon-live action hybrid. Both films took in an estimated $36.2 million at North American theaters, as ''The Smurfs'' outperformed expectations, and ''Cowboys & Aliens'' failed to capture young men in significant numbers. The difference, beyond the pedigree of the filmmakers and stars, is cost. Sony Pictures Entertainment spent about $110 million to make ''The Smurfs.'' ''Cowboys & Aliens'' cost at least $163 million, with Mr. Spielberg's DreamWorks Studios providing the bulk of the financing; Universal Pictures distributed and holds a minority financial stake. Moreover, the box-office future looks brighter for ''The Smurfs,'' which young moviegoers gave an A score in exit polls; ''Cowboys & Aliens'' got a B."

2011-08-01T00:00:00Z,"BERLIN -- While Europeans and Americans traveling abroad continue to face steep roaming charges, Chinese travelers can call home for as little as it costs to make a local call. For instance, when Su Xiaoqin, a Chinese translator living in Du sseldorf, calls Shanghai, she does not use the mobile network of her German operator, O2. Instead, she relies on service from China Mobile via a SIM card. As a result, Ms. Su's calls home cost as little as 44 cents a minute, a small fraction of what a call us- ing the German system would run. That's because China Mobile, the world's largest operator with 617 million customers, recently slashed its international roaming rates, following similar cuts by its domestic rivals, China Unicom and China Telecom. ''The word has gotten around that the Chinese operators now have the best rates to China,'' Ms. Su said. For American travelers abroad, however, the charges can still be shockingly high. In May, Paul O'Brien, the general legal counsel of an interna- tional industrial sealants maker based near Philadelphia, returned home after a business trip to Milan and Rome, to a $2,300 roaming bill, which he incurred in two days. Mr. O'Brien described his iPhone activity as moderate, involving calls to the United States through Telecom Italia, and downloading and reading e-mail. Just two days into what was a four-day trip, his American cell- phone operator, which he declined to name, shut off his service, citing his company's policy. ''I was blindsided,'' Mr. O'Brien said, adding that he did not know the limit that he had exceeded. Local operators (in Mr. O'Brien's case Telecom Italia) tend to reap the most profit from roaming charges, said Deep Basu, the vice president for product strategies and consumer products at Roamware, a software maker in San Jose, Calif., which helps operators manage roaming traffic. But the American cellphone carrier -- which has more customers than Telecom Italia and thus more clout in negotiating deals on roaming rates -- would have received a sizable slice as well. The European Union in 2007 stepped in to limit the price of mobile roaming charges in the 27 nation bloc, but those retail price caps, now 35 euro cents (51 cents) a minute for making a call, are higher than those paid by Chinese consumers. In the United States, the level of roaming charges is not regulated by the government but set by American and international operators through private agreements. Customers of China Unicom, that country's No. 2 operator with 182 million mobile users, now pay the equivalent of about 44 cents a minute to call China from most nations in Europe, and as low as 24 cents from America. The operator makes its low rates possible by running an extensive phone callback program, called the **100 Program, which assigns local landline phone numbers to its mobile customers while abroad, and then has a Cost cuts that are unlikely to be adopted in Europe or the U.S.company computer in China call them back over less expensive landlines to complete their long distance calls.China Unicom introduced the service in May, effectively slashing its roaming rates by as much as 90 percent. Sophia Tso, a spokeswoman for China Unicom in Hong Kong, said the decision to substantially lower roaming prices was made to better serve the company's customers. ''Decreasing the price is not merely marketing, it is to meet the user's needs and to meet business development and the in- herent requirement for developing the telecom industry,'' Ms. Tso said. She added that despite the price cuts, China Unicom was still covering its costs. Unicom's low international roaming charges, she said, ''are able to cover all the cost that is agreed between China Unicom and the international operators.'' Daniel Yu, an analyst in Hong Kong at Pyramid Research, said European and American operators, largely protected from outside competitors like the Chinese operators, have no incentive to reduce their own roaming profits. ''I don't think it will do much damage in Europe,'' Mr. Yu said, referring to the Chinese price cuts. But, he added, ''E.U. operators can adopt the same technique, but with the E.U. Commission continuing to reduce roaming rates across the Continent, the incentive to provide the service will be minimized.''"

There was everything from the classic (Grandma Jane’s apple pie, berry with a lattice crust) to the quintessentially Portland (a gluten-free “Rawvocado-chocolate” — avocado, chocolate, raw macadamias, dates and shredded coconut).

Next year Toronto could feature an outfield of Jose Bautista, Rasmus and Travis Snider/Eric Thames, and an infield with Adam Lind, Brett Lawrie and Yunel Escobar, to go along with a power-hitting catcher in J.P. Arencibia. With Ricky Romero and Brandon Morrow developing and Brett Cecil recently building on a solid rookie year, the Jays could crash the Yanks-Sox-Rays triumvirate as early as 2012.The Indians coughed up some top pitching prospects (Drew Pomeranz and Alex White) for Ubaldo Jimenez, and it makes you wonder why the Yankees didn’t offer a similar package (including Dellin Betances and Manny Banuelos), or, if they did, why the Rockies didn’t want it. Jimenez has a good contract and is under team control through 2014, so unless Colorado suspected there was something wrong with him, this seems like a good price. It’s not entirely true that there’s no such thing as a pitching prospect, especially when you’re talking about players who blew away the high minors like Tim Lincecum and Tommy Hanson or mega-talents like David Price or Stephen Strasburg. But for the next tier down, which is how I view both the Indians’ and Yankees’ duos, the failure rate is awfully high.

2011-08-02T00:00:00Z,"LONDON -- There is timely comedy, which is what most satire, stand-up and sitcoms are. And then there is timeless comedy, which, properly performed, should feel as old as the hills and as fresh as ocean air. Or in the case of ''One Man, Two Guvnors,'' Richard Bean's smash play at the National Theater, ocean air scented with the fumes of warm beer, melting taffy and frying fish and chips. Staged by Nicholas Hytner (the National's artistic director), ''One Man, Two Guvnors'' is set in the seaside resort of Brighton in the early 1960s. The plot is based closely on that of Carlo Goldoni's ''Servant of Two Masters,'' from the mid-1700s, which in turn was inspired by far older tales and types from commedia dell'arte. So figure we've got at least half a millennium's worth of comic traditions operating here."

They had been singing without accompaniment for much of the preceding hour; now they also went without microphones, on a version of ''The Earth Has No Skin,'' by the way-out indie folk singer Jana Hunter. The lack of amplification was a reminder, if any were needed, of rural Vermont, where they met at Bennington College and began singing together at house parties just two years ago.

2011-08-02T00:00:00Z,"January is often the cruelest month for Broadway box offices, as holiday tourists head home, students go back to school and New Yorkers hibernate from the cold and snow. Last winter the lead producers of the Broadway revival ''Promises, Promises'' closed the show on Jan. 2 rather than gamble money on recasting their two stars, Sean Hayes and Kristin Chenoweth, and risk a slide in ticket sales. Those same producers are now behind another Broadway revival, ''How to Succeed in Business Without Really Trying,'' but they have opted to replace their star, Daniel Radcliffe, who finishes his run as the scheming executive J. Pierrepont Finch on New Year's Day. Confirming rumors that have been circulating for a couple of weeks, the producers announced on Monday that Mr. Radcliffe (of ''Harry Potter'' fame) will be succeeded by a lesser-known actor, Darren Criss who has become popular recently on the Fox series ''Glee'' playing a gay high school student and show choir member who exudes charisma and self-confidence. In casting Mr. Criss the producers are seeking to appeal to at least some of the teenagers, women and gay men who often mob Mr. Radcliffe at the stage door after performances. Mr. Criss is scheduled for only a three-week engagement, Jan. 3 through 22. In their statement announcing Mr. Criss the producers did not say if they plan to cast another actor after him, close the $8.5 million production after he departs, or try to extend his run. A spokesman for the musical said the producers had not made decisions about the future of the show after the Criss run.

2011-08-02T00:00:00Z,"OLSON--Martha, who lived in both New York City and Southampton, died peacefully at her New York home surrounded by friends on July 30, 2011 after a long illness. Martha was a proud achiever and built a distinguished career in public relations. She and two partners started a PR firm in St. Louis that was so successful it was acquired by Farley Manning in New York, where she became a Sr. Vice President. She later joined Hill & Knowlton, rising to Sr. Vice President before her retirement. During the course of her career, Martha advised such powerful clients as the Principality of Monaco, Mexico's Department of Tourism (supervising the launch of Cancun), the Virgin Islands, Anheuser-Busch, E. I. du Pont de Nemours, Pet Milk and Chevron Chemical. Her hands-on style and creative ideas earned her major industry awards, including the Prisms Award presented by the Los Angeles chapter of the Public Relations Society of America in 1980, and two years later, she was one of the first women in the country to win the Silver Anvil Award, the highest honor given by the PRSA. Martha Annette Olson was born in Ft. Stockton, Texas on Christmas day 1920, the daughter of Auburn Elizabeth Bransford and John Nels Olson, a Swedish immigrant. She spent her formative years in Parsons, Kansas before moving to St. Louis and finally to New York. In an interview with the St. Louis Post-Dispatch in January 1958 regarding her public relations success, Martha said, ""Speed somehow always seems to have been part of my life."" Indeed she loved life in the fast lane, whether driving one of her low-slung sports convertibles, flying a single-engine plane as a 19-year-old student pilot and later becoming an airport traffic controller, or much later riding her horse, Dusty, in the Hamptons. Martha is survived by her sister and brother-in-law Jean and Joseph Stevens of Montecito, CA and her brother and sister-in-law Jack and Alice Olson of the National Forest north of Tucson, AZ. She is also survived by her close friends and real estate partners Jody Donohue and Etta Froio, and her beloved Wirehaired Fox Terrier Bentley, named for one of her flashy fast cars she loved to drive.

Despite the tension and uncertainty that has surrounded efforts to raise the debt ceiling, the vote of 269 to 161 was relatively strong in support of the plan, which would cut more than $2.1 trillion in government spending over 10 years while extending the borrowing authority of the Treasury Department.

But the woman behind the man,  Anne Sinclair, has remained a somewhat shadowy figure. Vanessa Grigoriadis’s piece in New York magazine, borrowing heavily from interviews in Le Monde, Le Nouvel Observateur and the biography Madame DSK, which is currently available only in French, is filled with details of the marriage (both left spouses for each other; she prefers Paris, he their riad in Marrakesh; she broke off a friendship when her friend suggested D.S.K.’s affairs were too numerous to be forgivable even by a Frenchwoman). It also reminds us of Sinclair’s striking readiness, past and present, to stand behind and by her man, despite having a prominent career as a TV host and holding the purse strings.For those of you hankering for more of the “other woman,” it’s worth reading the account of one Marie-Victorine M. in the Daily Beast, who claims to have found D.S.K. irresistibly magnetic (their eyes met across a room and for four months they had a torrid affair), and yet who believes the account of the Sofitel maid is true. What convinced her?  “When I read the first articles in the American press containing for example the detail that he was supposed to have taken his presumed victim from behind, that encouraged me to believe this woman.”"

To finance his growth, Mr. Justice kept borrowing money from the bank, not realizing that the more he grew, the more he needed to borrow because his revenue was not covering his expenses. The loans meant he had money in his accounts — but it was borrowed money. “I knew how to print a financial statement from QuickBooks, but I couldn’t tell you what it meant,” he said. It took the intervention of business owners in a peer group Mr. Justice joined to convince him that if he didn’t master his finances he was going to lose his business."

Retirement of this popular and very visible shuttle program further strains the already diminished agency. “Space experts say the best and brightest often head for the doors when rocket lines get marked for extinction, dampening morale and creating hidden threats,” according to The Times. This is not the first time in NASA’s history when the agency faced publicity troubles. Back in 1974, after the success of the Mercury and Apollo programs, but before the initiation of the Shuttle Program, NASA was convinced by the National Endowment for the Arts to participate in its “Federal Graphics Improvement Program,” and do what many companies these days do to revive their image: undergo a redesign.Up until that point, NASA had been primarily using an insignia adapted by James Modarelli, the head of NASA’s Lewis Research Center Reports Division. This logo, created in 1959 and affectionately dubbed “The Meatball,” relied heavily on multiple visual metaphors. According to NASA’s Web site, “the sphere represents a planet, the stars represent space, the red chevron is a wing representing aeronautics (the latest design in hypersonic wings at the time the logo was developed), and then there is an orbiting spacecraft going around the wing.” Although charming in its quirkiness, the meatball proved difficult to reproduce given the printing technology available at the time and the variety of applications it would need to adorn."

In New York this summer we are dining - or rather feasting - on unusually ambitious and knotty plays. The Public Theater, in its Shakespeare in the Park, has chosen to present two of the playwright's dark late comedies, ''All's Well That Ends Well'' and ''Measure for Measure,'' while the Royal Shakespeare Company packed only one true comedy, ''As You Like It,'' in its trunks for its presentation of five Shakespeare plays in repertory at the Park Avenue Armory."

In June El Museo laid off four staff members as part of an effort to trim $1.1 million from its budget, which is now $5.6 million. Its finances are now stable, the museum's chairman, Tony Bechara, said. Ms. Aguilar, who was born in Cuba, has a master's degree in art history from Hunter College and is a doctoral candidate in art history at the Graduate Center at the City University of New York."

2011-08-03T00:00:00Z,"10 P.M. (Sundance) WHITE NIGHT WEDDING (2008) This double bill from Baltasar Kormakur, the Icelandic director, writer and actor, is introduced with his adaptation of Chekov's ''Ivanov,'' in which a middle-aged professor (Hilmir Snaer Gudnason) prepares to marry a former student (Laufey Eliasdottir) half his age -- if he doesn't get cold feet. The film swept seven categories at the Edda Awards, considered the most prestigious in Iceland. It is followed at 11:40 by ''Jar City'' (with Theodor Juliusson, above), Mr. Kormakur's moody 2006 thriller about a weary homicide detective (Ingvar E. Sigurdsson), who investigates the death of an old man and opens up a hornet's nest of crimes and secrets. ''The picture of Iceland that emerges'' in the film ''is vivid and powerful but not something the country's tourist board would be likely to endorse,'' A. O. Scott wrote in The New York Times. ''The landscape has its austere poetry, to be sure -- mountains framing the apartment blocks of Reykjavik, spits of volcanic rock jutting into a churning sea -- but a fog of damp unhappiness seems to pervade every face and conversation. And yet by the end of this film, based on a popular mystery novel by Arnaldur Indridason, it is hard not to feel a certain affection for the place.'' Mr. Scott described the movie as ''intricate and pointed, conjuring a haunting, satisfying puzzle out of violence and chaos.'' 6 A.M. (TCM) SUMMER UNDER THE STARS: BETTE DAVIS This all-day tribute begins with ''The Working Man'' (1933), starring Davis as a shoe company heiress who toils under cover for her business's chief rival.

And in ''Jezebel'' (1938), at 10, she plays a tempestuous Southern belle whose willfulness destroys those who care for her."

Last year’s broadcast, produced by Mr. Mischer and Bruce Cohen, had soft ratings and was widely criticized for a lackluster performance by one of its hosts, James Franco. If energy is the issue, Mr. Ratner should be able to provide a fix. He is known as a film aficionado and an ambitious filmmaker whose is currently making a Snow White project for Relativity Media, and has dozens of projects in development. Recently, Mr. Ratner directed “Tower Heist.” That action picture, due Nov. 4 from Universal Pictures, has uncertain Oscar prospects, but counts Ben Stiller, Eddie Murphy, Matthew Broderick and Gabourey Sidibe among its stars."

Riffing on Rem Koolhaas’s iconic 1990s book “S, M, L, XL,” the exhibition focuses on projects that range in size from the micro to the massive, in a mix of built and speculative work. For the site-specific installation, LTL inserted a three-sided container with etched and printed surfaces into a long, narrow gallery space. Visitors entering the container make their way through the exhibition from the largest of the four projects on view to the smallest, walking on a white-painted wood floor that is laser-etched with the plans of each project. Canted walls of backlit panels provide photographs, architectural drawings and descriptive text. “Water Proving Ground,” at 69 million square feet, is LTL’s extra-large project. This visionary master plan for the northwest corner of New York Harbor was conceived as part of MoMA/P.S. 1’s recent “Rising Currents” initiative, which studied the impact of anticipated sea-level change on the city. The other projects in the show are all built works: Arthouse, a contemporary art center in Austin, Tex.; the Sullivan Family Student Center at the University of Wyoming in Laramie; and Lobby Wall, a site-specific sculpture for the lobby of Memorial Sloan-Kettering’s new Manhattan building, which is the smallest of the projects at 108 square feet."

Partly it has to do with their origin myth: they recorded the album at the renowned producer Jonathan Wilson’s studio in Laurel Canyon after playing a run of small hootenannies there. But mostly it has to do with their sound, which has a warm, stripped-down Americana feel frequently described as “vintage.” Recently, the group got about as big a nod as four guys playing folk rock could hope for: Robbie Robertson, the somewhat reclusive songwriter from the Band, asked them to back him in a series of rare performances. Now in the middle of an East Coast tour to promote their follow-up record, “Nothing Is Wrong,” which was released this summer, Dawes seems both honored and amused to have been credited with leading a revival of the Laurel Canyon sound."

Keane, chairman of computer science, University College Dublin, and Aaron Gerow, graduate student at Trinity College Dublin. Proceedings of the 22nd International Joint Conference on Artificial Intelligence in Barcelona, July 2011. THE EXPERIMENT Stock market bubbles occur when everyone is talking about the market and has a positive view of it, which is why John D. Rockefeller reputedly got out of the market when a bellhop asked him for a stock tip, Mr. Keane and Mr. Gerow write. They wondered if it would be possible to take a different sort of tip from Rockefeller and listen to the ''voice of the herd'' by tracking the language used by financial commentators. They analyzed 17,713 finance-related articles online from The New York Times, The Financial Times and the BBC from 2006 to 2010. Their hypothesis was that financial commentators would come to repeat the same optimistic words and terms to express a shared positive view of the stock market, evidence that a kind of group think has grabbed hold in the period leading up to and during an economic bubble."

2011-08-04T00:00:00Z,"LASTAVICA--John, of Manchester, MA died at home on July 29, 2011 of cancer. He was born on March 2, 1930 in Novi Sad, Serbia, son of Milan Lastavica and Danica Mihailovich Lastavica. John's father was a mining engineer and professor, who at age 17 volunteered with the Serbian Army fighting on the Salonica front and died in 1932. In 1947, after spending WWII in Belgrade, John escaped from communist Yugoslavia by crossing the Adriatic Sea to Italy on a fourteen-foot sailboat with his mother and two of his sisters. From Italy they went to Peru where he received a Doctorate in Economics from the Catholic University in Lima and worked for General Motors. In 1958 he came to the United States to Yale University where he met and married the late Rita Scimia of Haverhill, MA; they divorced in 1963. He worked for the Ford Motor Company in Detroit and then became an officer of the Bank of Boston with his focus on Operations Research. John's volunteer positions included: President of the International Institute of Boston, Chairman of the Board of the Landing School of Boat Building and Design in Kennebunkport, ME, and Trustee of the Museum of Fine Arts Boston. In New York in 1964, John was reunited with his uncle Steven Lastavica, the first Bishop of the Serbian Orthodox Church appointed to the United States and Canada after WWII. The Bishop was falsely accused of being a communist and he successfully argued his case before the United States Supreme Court. John was a genial gentleman of many talents who did not hesitate to rise in support of the truth. His wife of thirty four years, Catherine Coolidge Lastavica, MD., his daughter Maria and her husband Alain Briancon, his granddaughter Alicia and grandsons Marc and Aidan survive him. A Memorial Service will be held on Coolidge Point Tuesday, August 30, at 11am. Donations in his name may be made to The Thomas Jefferson Heritage Society, P.O.

2011-08-04T00:00:00Z,"SACERDOTE--Peter Marcello, of New York City and Nantucket, MA died in New York on July 31st peacefully surrounded by his family. He succumbed to the prostate cancer that he had been stalwartly battling for many years. He was 73 years old. Mr. Sacerdote was born October 15, 1937 in Turin, Italy and in 1940 his family moved to the United States. He received a Bachelor's Degree of Electrical Engineering from Cornell University in 1960. He served in the Navy from 1960-1962 as Lieutenant (JG), and graduated as a Baker Scholar from Harvard Business School in 1964. He was married to Bonnie L. Johnson on June 18, 1967 in Bronxville, NY. They were devotedly married for forty-four years. Peter enjoyed a distinguished forty-one year career with Goldman, Sachs & Co., which he joined in 1964 directly from business school. He became a General Partner in 1972 and in 1973 was appointed head of the firm's Private Finance Department. In 1980 he became head of the firm's Corporate Finance Department serving in that role for seven years. In 1987 Peter became Co-Head of the firm's merchant banking activities, and served as Chairman of its Investment Committee. He was also Chairman of both the Firm's Commitments and Credit Committees until he retired as a General Partner in 1990. Peter remained active as a Limited Partner serving as Chairman of Goldman's Principal Investment Area's (PIA) Investment Committee - the group responsible for Goldman's corporate private equity and venture capital investing. He served in this role until his retirement in 2006. Peter was known within the firm for his wisdom and investment acumen as well as for being a great teacher, mentor, and friend to many and always reminding everyone, how important it is to have a sense of humor. In 2006, Peter co-founded Whale Rock Capital Management a long-short technology hedge fund with his son Alexander. Peter served as the firm's Chairman for five years and greatly enjoyed working with his son and helping the firm grow to an eight person operation. Over the years, Mr. Sacerdote served on seven corporate boards but there were two that he had a special affinity for: Qualcomm, Inc. and Franklin Resources, Inc. As a Cornell ""double EE,"" Peter had a strong understanding of technology and appreciated his vantage point at Qualcomm to watch the wireless communications revolution unfold. Peter also particularly enjoyed serving on the Board of Franklin Resources, Inc, a firm his father in law founded in 1947. His philanthropic activities included science, education and the arts. He was respected as an active and effective board member. He was on the Board of Overseers of Weill Cornell Medical School and established the Peter M. Sacerdote Urology Laboratory of Research at New York Hospital. He was an Adjunct Professor at Columbia University Business School where he taught a course in corporate finance. He served on the Board of Duke University's Fuqua Business School and Milton Academy. For two years, he served as President of the Alumni Association at Harvard Business School where he established the Peter M. Sacerdote Prize for Social Entrepreneurship. He was a member of the Council on Foreign Relations. He also partnered with his wife Bonnie in supporting a number of cultural institutions, including the Metropolitan Museum of Art. Nantucket Island where Peter spent the last forty two summers, held a very special place in his heart. He loved the island for its natural beauty, sports, friendships and most of all because it was a great place to spend time with his family. Some of his fondest memories were boating and fishing off the shores of Coatue and Great Point with his children and grandchildren. Peter loved playing golf with his friends on Nantucket, whether on the rolling fairways of the Nantucket Golf Club, where he was a founding member, or at seaside Sankaty Head, for which he had a special love having served as a board member for several years and as the Club's President from 2008-2010. Peter also loved his special times with family and friends at the Nantucket Yacht Club, never more so than his last time there - at a picnic celebration of this years 4th of July. He was also active in the Nantucket philanthropic affairs. He endowed the Annual Nantucket Cottage Hospital Health Fair, enabling free mammograms and prostate screenings for local residents. Peter recognized the paramount importance of preserving the island's open, natural land and devoted much time and expertise as a board member of the Nantucket Conservation Foundation. But at his core, Peter was a family man. He derived the most joy from his children, their spouses and his grandchildren, to whom he will always be an inspiration. He lived his life with dignity, grace, and a wonderfully positive attitude, all of which earned him the respect and admiration of those around him. Peter will be remembered as a man dedicated to his family, friends and the communities in which he was involved. All his friends and colleagues continually commented on his wide ranging intellect, his wit and his truly unique sense of humor. These qualities touched all those around him. Peter is survived by his devoted family including his wife Bonnie, his daughter Alisa Brockelman, his sons Alexander and Laurence, his son-in-law Curt Brockelman, daughter-in-law Annagret Sacerdote and his five grandchildren Curtis Brockelman III, Nina Brockelman, Bridget Brockelman, Kate Sacerdote and Peter Sacerdote. In addition he is survived by his brother George Sacerdote, sister in law Carol Sacerdote and their two nephews David and Michael. His other two nephews are the sons of his older brother Albert who predeceased him. He is also pre deceased by his parents Luciana and Giorgio. A private family burial will be held on Nantucket. A future memorial service will take place in New York City, date to be announced. In lieu of flowers, donations may be made in honor of Mr. Peter Sacerdote to Memorial Sloan- Kettering Box 27106, New York, NY 10087 or to The Nantucket Conservation Foundation, P.O.

2011-08-04T00:00:00Z,"''Lysistrata Jones,'' a musical comedy about sex and college basketball that had a well-received production Off Broadway in the spring, will transfer to Broadway and begin performances on Nov. 12 and open on Dec. 14 at the Walter Kerr Theater, the show's producers said on Wednesday. The music and lyrics are by Lewis Flinn and the book is by the playwright Douglas Carter Beane, a three-time Tony Award contender who most recently shared a nomination in June for the book of the musical ''Sister Act.'' The move to Broadway is a big leap: ''Lysistrata Jones'' played this spring in the 99-seat gymnasium of the Judson Memorial Church in Greenwich Village, while the Kerr (while on the small side for musicals) has about 940 seats to sell for each performance. Some Off Broadway shows founder financially in the transition to the much larger Broadway houses; two such musicals last season, ''Bloody Bloody Andrew Jackson'' and ''The Scottsboro Boys,'' flopped in their uptown theaters. But Mr. Beane said in an interview on Wednesday that he was optimistic that ''Lysistrata Jones,'' which will cost $6 million to mount, would find a wide audience."

2011-08-04T00:00:00Z,"The actress Lauren Ambrose, best known as the rebellious Claire Fisher in the HBO series ''Six Feet Under,'' was not an obvious first choice for the Barbra Streisand role in the Broadway-bound revival of the musical ''Funny Girl.'' But a combination of acting skill, comic timing, singing talent - including the high belt that is critical for well-known numbers like ''Don't Rain on My Parade'' - and a ''quirky, surprising fearlessness'' (in the words of the director Bartlett Sher) helped win Ms. Ambrose the role, the revival's producers said on Wednesday. Ms. Ambrose, 33, will star as the comedian and actress Fanny Brice in the revival, which is scheduled for a tryout run at the Ahmanson Theater in Los Angeles from Jan. 15 to Feb. 26, 2012, before an anticipated move to New York in the spring. It would be the first production of ''Funny Girl'' on Broadway since the Streisand-led original, which ran from 1964 to 1967 and led to a 1968 film version for which Ms. Streisand won a best-actress Academy Award."

2011-08-04T00:00:00Z,"8 P.M. (Planet Green) DETROIT IN OVERDRIVE Planet Green teams up with General Motors for a three-part program to examine how this city, which once dominated automotive production, is working to rebuild from a devastating economic decline. Part 1 follows creative types like Joe Faris, who moved back home to Detroit from New York to establish Motor City Denim, a fashion line incorporating elements like seat belts and rivets. The items are made in a retrofitted factory that manufactured protective covers for auto-industry robots for more than 30 years. Then there's Badass Beer, which the Grammy-winning rapper Kid Rock devised to bolster employment in his hometown, and First Robotics, an after-school program founded by Dean Kamen, the inventor of the Segway PT, to pique the interest of high school students. Part 2, at 9, explores the significance of the arts in Detroit, including an installation by Tyree Guyton (above) focusing on the city's homeless and the Sphinx Organization, which introduces classical music to Latino and black children. And Part 3, at 10, visits with those spearheading local food campaigns and highlights the efforts of Veronika Scott, a fourth-year student at the College for Creative Studies who has designed a heat-capturing coat that turns into a sleeping bag. It is made for the homeless and by the homeless, and has become part of a broader effort to provide housing, food and jobs. 4:30 P.M. (HBO Signature) GREENBERG (2010) In what A. O. Scott of The New York Times called Noah Baumbach's ''funniest and saddest movie'' so far, ''and also the riskiest,'' Ben Stiller plays Roger Greenberg, a 40-year-old former musician who, after a mental breakdown, house-sits in the large Los Angeles home of his vacationing brother. Greta Gerwig portrays Florence Marr, the brother's 25-year-old assistant and Roger's on-again, off-again love interest in his quest to recapture his youth. ''Mr. Stiller, suppressing his well-honed sketch comedian's urge to wink at the audience, turns Roger into a walking challenge to the Hollywood axiom that a movie's protagonist must be likable,'' Mr. Scott wrote. Only at the end does Mr. Baumbach reveal that the film has been ''a romantic comedy all along,'' he said. ''And suddenly a movie about a man who is defiantly difficult to like becomes very hard not to love.'' (Above, Mr. Stiller with Bree Larson, left, and Juno Temple.)"

2011-08-05T00:00:00Z,"SACERDOTE--Peter Marcello, of New York City and Nantucket, MA died in New York on July 31st peacefully surrounded by his family. He succumbed to the prostate cancer that he had been stalwartly battling for many years. He was 73 years old. Mr. Sacerdote was born October 15, 1937 in Turin, Italy and in 1940 his family moved to the United States. He received a Bachelor's Degree of Electrical Engineering from Cornell University in 1960. He served in the Navy from 1960-1962 as Lieutenant (JG), and graduated as a Baker Scholar from Harvard Business School in 1964. He was married to Bonnie L. Johnson on June 18, 1967 in Bronxville, NY. They were devotedly married for forty-four years. Peter enjoyed a distinguished forty-one year career with Goldman, Sachs & Co., which he joined in 1964 directly from business school. He became a General Partner in 1972 and in 1973 was appointed head of the firm's Private Finance Department. In 1980 he became head of the firm's Corporate Finance Department serving in that role for seven years. In 1987 Peter became Co-Head of the firm's merchant banking activities, and served as Chairman of its Investment Committee. He was also Chairman of both the Firm's Commitments and Credit Committees until he retired as a General Partner in 1990. Peter remained active as a Limited Partner serving as Chairman of Goldman's Principal Investment Area's (PIA) Investment Committee - the group responsible for Goldman's corporate private equity and venture capital investing. He served in this role until his retirement in 2006. Peter was known within the firm for his wisdom and investment acumen as well as for being a great teacher, mentor, and friend to many and always reminding everyone, how important it is to have a sense of humor. In 2006, Peter co-founded Whale Rock Capital Management a long-short technology hedge fund with his son Alexander. Peter served as the firm's Chairman for five years and greatly enjoyed working with his son and helping the firm grow to an eight person operation. Over the years, Mr. Sacerdote served on seven corporate boards but there were two that he had a special affinity for: Qualcomm, Inc. and Franklin Resources, Inc. As a Cornell ""double EE,"" Peter had a strong understanding of technology and appreciated his vantage point at Qualcomm to watch the wireless communications revolution unfold. Peter also particularly enjoyed serving on the Board of Franklin Resources, Inc, a firm his father in law founded in 1947. His philanthropic activities included science, education and the arts. He was respected as an active and effective board member. He was on the Board of Overseers of Weill Cornell Medical School and established the Peter M. Sacerdote Urology Laboratory of Research at New York Hospital. He was an Adjunct Professor at Columbia University Business School where he taught a course in corporate finance. He served on the Board of Duke University's Fuqua Business School and Milton Academy. For two years, he served as President of the Alumni Association at Harvard Business School where he established the Peter M. Sacerdote Prize for Social Entrepreneurship. He was a member of the Council on Foreign Relations. He also partnered with his wife Bonnie in supporting a number of cultural institutions, including the Metropolitan Museum of Art. Nantucket Island where Peter spent the last forty two summers, held a very special place in his heart. He loved the island for its natural beauty, sports, friendships and most of all because it was a great place to spend time with his family. Some of his fondest memories were boating and fishing off the shores of Coatue and Great Point with his children and grandchildren. Peter loved playing golf with his friends on Nantucket, whether on the rolling fairways of the Nantucket Golf Club, where he was a founding member, or at seaside Sankaty Head, for which he had a special love having served as a board member for several years and as the Club's President from 2008-2010. Peter also loved his special times with family and friends at the Nantucket Yacht Club, never more so than his last time there - at a picnic celebration of this years 4th of July. He was also active in the Nantucket philanthropic affairs. He endowed the Annual Nantucket Cottage Hospital Health Fair, enabling free mammograms and prostate screenings for local residents. Peter recognized the paramount importance of preserving the island's open, natural land and devoted much time and expertise as a board member of the Nantucket Conservation Foundation. But at his core, Peter was a family man. He derived the most joy from his children, their spouses and his grandchildren, to whom he will always be an inspiration. He lived his life with dignity, grace, and a wonderfully positive attitude, all of which earned him the respect and admiration of those around him. Peter will be remembered as a man dedicated to his family, friends and the communities in which he was involved. All his friends and colleagues continually commented on his wide ranging intellect, his wit and his truly unique sense of humor. These qualities touched all those around him. Peter is survived by his devoted family including his wife Bonnie, his daughter Alisa Brockelman, his sons Alexander and Laurence, his son-in-law Curt Brockelman, daughter-in-law Annagret Sacerdote and his five grandchildren Curtis Brockelman III, Nina Brockelman, Bridget Brockelman, Kate Sacerdote and Peter Sacerdote. In addition he is survived by his brother George Sacerdote, sister in law Carol Sacerdote and their two nephews David and Michael. His other two nephews Dean and Bruce Sacerdote are the sons of his older brother Albert who predeceased him. He is also pre deceased by his parents Luciana and Giorgio.

Born June 10, 1923 in Bar Harbor, Maine, the son of William Scoville Moore and Edith Pulitzer Moore; died at home in Rye, New York on August 2, 2011, after a short illness. He is survived by his wife of 63 years, Katherine Cromwell Moore; his sons Richard, David, Jr., and Timothy; their wives Barbara, Leni, and Debby; seven grandchildren, and one great-grandchild. His daughter Kate predeceased him. A graduate of St. Marks School and Harvard College, he served as a lieutenant in the 70th Armored Infantry Battalion, 20th Armored Division in Europe during WWII. After his marriage to Katherine in 1948, he worked with the Marshall Plan in London and as Executive Officer of the mission to Portugal in Lisbon. Following their return to the United States, they settled in Rye in 1951. As a grandson of newspaper publisher Joseph Pulitzer, and with journalism in his blood, he soon went to work as a reporter, first at Greenwich Life, a new weekly paper in Greenwich, Connecticut, and then at the Port Chester Daily Item, where he covered sports, police, and local government. In 1961, he founded the Harrison Independent, a weekly newspaper serving that Westchester community. Three years later, he acquired a countywide weekly, renamed it the Independent Herald of Westchester, and changed its focus from social to business news. He then merged it with the Westchester Business Journal and soon thereafter launched the Connecticut Business Journal. He remained editor-in-chief of the latter two publications until 1987. In a further publishing venture, he founded Northeast International Business magazine in 1987, which he later expanded to International Business magazine. In 1979, he was the first journalist to receive the Service to Exporters Award from the Connecticut-Rhode Island District Export Council. In 1980, the U.S. Department of Commerce presented the Connecticut Business Journal with the prestigious President's E Award, in recognition of its contribution to increasing U.S. trade and investment abroad. He served as Chairman of the Connecticut and Rhode Island District Export Council from 1982-1995. He was a director and officer of other trade groups, including WestConn International Trade Association, the largest such organization in New England, and the Westchester World Trade Council. He also served as a director and member of the executive committee of the Pulitzer Publishing Company for many years. Always willing to give of his time and energy, his local civic activities included serving as a Rye City Democratic Committee district leader, a director and treasurer of the Westchester Urban League, a trustee of Rye Country Day School, founder and first chairman of the Rye Art Center, a member of the board of directors of the Westchester Council for the Arts, and board chairman and director of the Westchester-based social service agency FIRST. Other volunteer work included Business Leaders for Sensible Priorities, Port Chester Hope House, and Children's Village in Dobbs Ferry. He also served on the boards of New York Community Media Alliance, Westchester Community College Foundation, Port Chester Carver Center, and Doolittle Lake Company, and was a founding trustee of the Pulitzer Center for Investigative Journalism. Throughout his life, he pursued his passionate interests in freedom of the press and in international economic development, which latter he considered the hope of the world. His wide-ranging interests also included international travel, political history, tennis, the outdoors and painting. He was much loved and will be sorely missed by both family and friends.

2011-08-06T00:00:00Z,"9 P.M. (Starz) HOW DO YOU KNOW (2010) Reese Witherspoon taps into her intimidating side to play Lisa, a 31-year-old softball star whose world-class aspirations have been dealt a huge blow. Owen Wilson, above with Ms. Witherspoon, is Matty, the major-league pitcher whose spell she falls under, and who thinks he may be ready to give commitment a try. Then George (Paul Rudd) enters Lisa's life, first as a dud of a blind date and then as a friend whose father-cum-boss, Charles (Jack Nicholson), isn't all that unhappy about letting his son take the fall for his own financial misdeeds. Now Lisa needs to decide. Writing in The New York Times, Manohla Dargis said that this romantic comedy from James L. Brooks was ''so wan and disconnected to anything that feels like real life or, just as good, a screwball interpretation of it, that it's hard to know what Mr. Brooks was really after, other than passing the time with some talented movie people.'' Curiously, she added, Ms. Witherspoon, Mr. Rudd and Mr. Wilson were ''outshone by a pair of character actors -- Kathryn Hahn, who plays George's secretary, Annie, and Lenny Venito, as her boyfriend -- who, in an overworked, overwritten hospital scene, show you what love looks like simply by, surprise, good acting.'' 6 A.M. (TCM) SUMMER UNDER THE STARS: LUCILLE BALL An all-day tribute to Ball, the glamorous blond Goldwyn showgirl turned carrot-top comedian, begins with ''Du Barry Was a Lady'' (1943), Roy Del Ruth's musical about Louis Blore (Red Skelton), a nightclub coatroom attendant who dreams that he's Louis XV and that the star he idolizes, May Daly (Ball) -- who claims to be interested only in rich men -- is his lover. Gene Kelly plays the club M.C., Alec Howe, Louis's rival for May's affections. In ''The Long, Long Trailer'' (1954), at 2:30 p.m., Ball and her real-life husband, Desi Arnaz, above, portray newlyweds who take to the road in an oversize motor home. And in ''Stage Door'' (1937), at 8, Ball is a New York City actress, alongside Ginger Rogers, Eve Arden and Ann Miller, in a boarding house where a society beauty (Katharine Hepburn) has come to fulfill her Broadway dreams."
2011-08-06T00:00:00Z,"If those who give out the Oscars are looking for laughs, action and the occasional outrage from their annual awards show, they are on the right track. The Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences has announced that Brett Ratner, a filmmaker known for directing the raucous ''Rush Hour'' series and for producing ''Horrible Bosses,'' will join Don Mischer in producing the next Oscar show, which ABC will broadcast on Feb. 26. Last year's ceremony, below, produced by Mr. Mischer and Bruce Cohen, had soft ratings and was widely criticized for a lackluster performance by one of its hosts, James Franco, onstage below with Anne Hathaway. If energy is the issue, Mr. Ratner should be able to provide a fix. He is known as a film aficionado and an ambitious filmmaker who is developing a new version of ''Snow White'' for Relativity Media, and has dozens of projects in development. Mr. Ratner recently directed ''Tower Heist.'' That action picture, due out on Nov. 4 from Universal Pictures, has uncertain Oscar prospects, but counts Ben Stiller, Eddie Murphy, Matthew Broderick and Gabourey Sidibe among its stars."

The reality program carried CBS to an overall ratings victory as well, as the network averaged around 6.3 million total viewers for the night. ABC came in second, averaging just under 5.5 million viewers, thanks to its reality competitions, ''Wipeout'' (6.6 million viewers) and ''Expedition Impossible'' (4.8 million)."

The documentary, awarded $550,000, is being directed by Jim Brown and will detail how the music, initially banned by the Kremlin, became so popular that it fueled resentment toward the authorities and contributed to the creation of a youth movement. (Above, Stas Namin, a Soviet military cadet, in the documentary.) Digital humanities, a discipline that barely existed a decade ago, has been winning additional financing. This year the endowment's Office of Digital Humanities, created in 2009, awarded 32 start-up grants, all $50,000 or less. The winning projects include a conference to assist speakers of endangered languages in digital preservation efforts and an educational computer game to teach middle schoolers about American Indian earthworks. Bruce Ray Smith of the University of Southern California and Katherine Rowe of Bryn Mawr College received $50,000 to develop a portable electronic application: Mobile Shakespeare Scripts.

She is survived by Peter, her husband, Anthony, her step-son, Donatella, her sister, and Giulio, her brother. Trained as an architect at La Sapienza, but a watercolorist by vocation, her works on paper reside in private collections and among the holding of prominent institutions, include the Museum of Modern Art in New York, The National Gallery in Washington, DC and the San Francisco Museum of Modern Art. Noted for luminous qualities of color and light, her depictions of imagined spaces open up a world of enclosed rooms, sweeping landscapes, watery materiality and atmospheric ephemerality. As the title of a monograph on her work suggests the paintings are not architecture exactly, but evidence that it exists. Also a devoted educator, Lauretta taught design studio in architecture for many years at Columbia University, City College and Pratt University, among other institutions.

As Nova answered questions about his status before the Yankees' game against the Boston Red Sox on Friday he wore a big smile on his face, if only because he was still with the team. The Yankees postponed any decisions that could have sent Nova back to Class AAA Scranton/Wilkes Barre, deciding instead to keep six starters and then figure out what to do after this weekend's series in Boston. Facing three games in hitter-friendly Fenway Park against a team that can wear out pitchers, the Yankees decided they needed as many arms as possible."

2011-08-06T00:00:00Z,"LONDON - Never let it be said that the pig is not a lady. Yes, the title character of ''Betty Blue Eyes,'' the slyly winning new musical at the Ivor Novello Theater, is irrefutably porcine. She emits odors that cause everyone around her to gag, and you do need to watch where you step after she's been in the room. Yet this over-size porker has a shy, persuasive charm that can only be described as genteel. The same may be said of the show in which she appears. Based on the 1984 film ''A Private Function,'' directed by Malcolm Mowbray and written by Alan Bennett, ''Betty Blue Eyes'' is a sweet paradox of a show. It's a reticent crowd pleaser, a big, well-groomed musical that never seems to be courting a standing ovation. Hustling for applause, after all, is not seemly in a crisis economy, when we all need to work as one, make do and, whenever required, do without. This show - need I add? - does not take place in the present."

Mr. Kitamoto, now 72, said he spent many of his younger years in a severe identity crisis, ashamed of his Japanese heritage and wishing he were white. Other young men went so far as to have plastic surgery to disguise their Japanese features. Some committed suicide. ''As a kid, I thought this was the land of equality and freedom, and so this couldn't be happening because of discrimination,'' Mr. Kitamoto, who became a dentist, said the other day in his office, where one wall is covered with photos from that era. ''So I thought it was because there was something wrong with me, that I was a bad person.''"

The images were unmistakably Hama, Syria's fourth-largest city and a focal point of the five-month-old uprising that has left President Bashar al-Assad's leadership isolated and weakened. They suggested the military had retaken control of a city that had briefly wrested itself from four decades of authoritarian rule by the Assad family and enjoyed an unprecedented measure of freedom."

It's always been one of the most powerful forces in the financial universe. And in the case of the debt ceiling, it appears that compound interest has the potential to become a crushing enemy. Some people fear that the United States will lose its AAA credit-rating or even default temporarily, potentially increasing how much it costs the government to borrow money. According to the Congressional Budget Office, ''...a 4-percentage-point across-the-board increase in interest rates would raise federal interest payments next year by about $100 billion; if those higher rates persisted, net interest costs in 2015 would be nearly double the roughly $460 billion that the C.B.O. currently projects for that year.''"

The band posted a statement on its Web site saying the group ''will be continuing our journey without bassist Michael Todd.'' The statement added that it was ''a mutual decision.'' Mr. Todd, 30, left, was arrested in Mansfield, Mass., on July 10, hours before the band was to open for Soundgarden. The band went on without him that night, and a replacement bassist was hired to finish the tour. Court officials in Attleboro, Mass., said Mr. Todd had been released from the county jail and was scheduled to appear in court next week for a hearing. He faces felony charges of armed robbery and drug possession. Through a publicist, the other band members -- Claudio Sanchez, Travis Stever and Chris Pennie -- declined to comment about the decision beyond the statement on the Web site. Mr. Todd did not respond to a message left on Friday. Formed in the mid-1990s in Nyack, N.Y., Coheed and Cambria came to national attention in 2002 and has released five studio albums since then, revolving around a sci-fi story line known as the Amory Wars. The statement said that they were writing and recording songs for a new album, and that Wes Styles, who replaced Mr. Todd during several live performances after the arrest, would continue to play bass for a series of shows in South America and Mexico."

An inning later, the Mets announced that Reyes was feeling stiffness in his left hamstring — yes, the same hamstring that landed him on the disabled list in July. Indeed, in the first inning, he had appeared to pull up gingerly while running out a soft ground ball to Braves’ third baseman Martin Prado. He played the field the next half-inning and appeared fine on the one ball hit to him, but did not return to bat in the second. Details will be updated here."

A distinguished, influential and visionary pedagogue and violinist, Miss Behrend dedicated much of her life to disseminating educational ideas of Dr. Shinichi Suzuki. By founding The School for Strings in 1971, Miss Behrend created an outlet for training future Suzuki teachers and an oasis for nurturing young children in the art of music.

2011-08-07T00:00:00Z,"IN some New York neighborhoods, business after dark still takes on an altogether noirish tone, even though violent crime has fallen citywide by nearly 30 percent over the past decade. At night, the handshakes and fist-bumps are gone, the cheerful banter between clerks and customers replaced by strained conversations conducted through plexiglass. For store owners and overnight clerks, transaction windows in varying styles and degrees of security are an essential safeguard; for customers in persistently dangerous neighborhoods, they are a way of life, a reminder that progress takes time. ''It's just everywhere,'' Charlie Colon, the owner of two Harlem pawnshops, said of the city's transaction windows, as the sky over Frederick Douglass Boulevard turned a steely gray. ''I almost compare it to the taxicabs: If you have one they can't get to you; if you don't have one you get gotten.''"

''Things have all kinds of crazy names,'' her grandmother snapped. ''How should I know?'' As the daughter of émigrés from Ukraine, I was raised on room-temperature beverages and always associated ice with a raft of great American stuff other kids were allowed to have but I wasn't: puppies, sheet cake, fun. My own grandmother would cringe from a glass of ice water as if it were a syringe of Ebola virus. I have no idea what disease she associated with the consumption of cold liquids. Pneumonia?

2011-08-07T00:00:00Z,"ENRIONE--Robert Ugo Bob. February 5, 1947 June 28, 2011. Robert Ugo Bob Enrione, a veteran of the United States Navy, an Emmy award-winning video journalist, and a longtime resident of Tarrytown, NY, died suddenly on June 28, 2011, while he and his wife were visiting family in Virginia. He was 64 years old. Born on February 5, 1947, in Astoria, Queens, Mr. Enrione was the son of the late Hugo and Ermina Enrione. A 1964 graduate of Bryant High School, Mr. Enrione earned a Bachelor's degree in chemical engineering from City College in 1974. During the Vietnam War, Mr. Enrione served in the United States Navy as a Petty Officer -- Machinist's Mate. Stationed in Vietnam, he was awarded the Silver Star, as well as numerous other decorations. Bob worked for ABC News and CBS News as a videotape editor from the mid 70's through his retirement in 2010. Most notably, Bob worked for the CBS Evening News and 60 Minutes and sports. He was also a frequent commentator on political, social, and economic topics on blogs and online journals. In the mid-1990's Bob shared responsibilities with his wife, Jackie, on their local newspaper, West Side Beat. They covered neighborhood politics up through the Washington Beltway. A gourmet cook, Bob is immortalized in his Chef Hugo column providing unique, easy-to-cook recipes for Manhattanites in their traditional closet-size kitchens. The couple was married October 26, 1996. Mayor Giulilani performed the nuptials. Mr. Enrione was an amateur naval historian of enormous skill and considerable reputation. A contributor to Sea Classics and Naval History magazines, Bob's encyclopedic knowledge of naval warfare ranged from the operational intricacies of sloops and brigs-of-war, to the strategic and tactical nuances of the great naval battles of the French Revolutionary and Napoleonic wars, and the War of 1812. At the time of his passing, Bob was working on a monumental historical novel concerning life at sea during the Nelsonian period. He was also a long-time member of the U.S. Naval Institute, and an informal researcher for the renowned novelist, Dewey Lambdin. Bob was also a very talented visual artist, and his sketches of schooners, sloops, brigs, and ship-of-the-line from the great age of sail enlivened several publications and serve as special keepsakes for his family and friends. He leaves his loving wife of 15 years, Jacqueline Wolf-Enrione, as well as numerous close cousins and friends. Bob had many good friends from all walks of life from medical lab technicians to media moguls and five star generals. Those of us whose lives he touched are richer for having known him. Enrione's HMS Indefatigable 251947 shines on. In lieu of flowers, the family has requested that a donation be made in Bob's name to the Naval Institute, 291 Wood Rd, Annapolis, MD 21402, attn: Carol Parkinson. A memorial service will be announced."

2011-08-07T00:00:00Z,"SACERDOTE--Peter Marcello, of New York City and Nantucket, MA died in New York on July 31st peacefully surrounded by his family. He succumbed to the prostate cancer that he had been stalwartly battling for many years. He was 73 years old. Mr. Sacerdote was born October 15, 1937 in Turin, Italy and in 1940 his family moved to the United States. He received a Bachelor's Degree of Electrical Engineering from Cornell University in 1960. He served in the Navy from 1960-1962 as Lieutenant (JG), and graduated as a Baker Scholar from Harvard Business School in 1964. He was married to Bonnie L. Johnson on June 18, 1967 in Bronxville, NY. They were devotedly married for forty-four years. Peter enjoyed a distinguished forty-one year career with Goldman, Sachs & Co., which he joined in 1964 directly from business school. He became a General Partner in 1972 and in 1973 was appointed head of the firm's Private Finance Department. In 1980 he became head of the firm's Corporate Finance Department serving in that role for seven years. In 1987 Peter became Co-Head of the firm's merchant banking activities, and served as Chairman of its Investment Committee. He was also Chairman of both the Firm's Commitments and Credit Committees until he retired as a General Partner in 1990. Peter remained active as a Limited Partner serving as Chairman of Goldman's Principal Investment Area's (PIA) Investment Committee - the group responsible for Goldman's corporate private equity and venture capital investing. He served in this role until his retirement in 2006. Peter was known within the firm for his wisdom and investment acumen as well as for being a great teacher, mentor, and friend to many and always reminding everyone, how important it is to have a sense of humor. In 2006, Peter co-founded Whale Rock Capital Management a long-short technology hedge fund with his son Alexander. Peter served as the firm's Chairman for five years and greatly enjoyed working with his son and helping the firm grow to an eight person operation. Over the years, Mr. Sacerdote served on seven corporate boards but there were two that he had a special affinity for: Qualcomm, Inc. and Franklin Resources, Inc. As a Cornell ""double EE,"" Peter had a strong understanding of technology and appreciated his vantage point at Qualcomm to watch the wireless communications revolution unfold. Peter also particularly enjoyed serving on the Board of Franklin Resources, Inc, a firm his father in law founded in 1947. His philanthropic activities included science, education and the arts. He was respected as an active and effective board member. He was on the Board of Overseers of Weill Cornell Medical School and established the Peter M. Sacerdote Urology Laboratory of Research at New York Hospital. He was an Adjunct Professor at Columbia University Business School where he taught a course in corporate finance. He served on the Board of Duke University's Fuqua Business School and Milton Academy. For two years, he served as President of the Alumni Association at Harvard Business School where he established the Peter M. Sacerdote Prize for Social Entrepreneurship. He was a member of the Council on Foreign Relations. He also partnered with his wife Bonnie in supporting a number of cultural institutions, including the Metropolitan Museum of Art. Nantucket Island where Peter spent the last forty two summers, held a very special place in his heart. He loved the island for its natural beauty, sports, friendships and most of all because it was a great place to spend time with his family. Some of his fondest memories were boating and fishing off the shores of Coatue and Great Point with his children and grandchildren. Peter loved playing golf with his friends on Nantucket, whether on the rolling fairways of the Nantucket Golf Club, where he was a founding member, or at seaside Sankaty Head, for which he had a special love having served as a board member for several years and as the Club's President from 2008-2010. Peter also loved his special times with family and friends at the Nantucket Yacht Club, never more so than his last time there - at a picnic celebration of this years 4th of July. He was also active in the Nantucket philanthropic affairs. He endowed the Annual Nantucket Cottage Hospital Health Fair, enabling free mammograms and prostate screenings for local residents. Peter recognized the paramount importance of preserving the island's open, natural land and devoted much time and expertise as a board member of the Nantucket Conservation Foundation. But at his core, Peter was a family man. He derived the most joy from his children, their spouses and his grandchildren, to whom he will always be an inspiration. He lived his life with dignity, grace, and a wonderfully positive attitude, all of which earned him the respect and admiration of those around him. Peter will be remembered as a man dedicated to his family, friends and the communities in which he was involved. All his friends and colleagues continually commented on his wide ranging intellect, his wit and his truly unique sense of humor. These qualities touched all those around him. Peter is survived by his devoted family including his wife Bonnie, his daughter Alisa Brockelman, his sons Alexander and Laurence, his son-in-law Curt Brockelman, daughter-in-law Annagret Sacerdote and his five grandchildren Curtis Brockelman III, Nina Brockelman, Bridget Brockelman, Kate Sacerdote and Peter Sacerdote. In addition he is survived by his brother George Sacerdote, sister in law Carol Sacerdote and their two nephews David and Michael. His other two nephews Dean and Bruce Sacerdote are the sons of his older brother Albert who predeceased him. He is also pre deceased by his parents Luciana and Giorgio.

(NBC) THE ROAD BACK In this special edition of ''Dateline NBC,'' Tom Brokaw follows three families -- American, Iraqi and Iraqi-American -- through the war in Iraq, starting in 2002, before the United States invaded that country and removed Saddam Hussein from power, and up to the present, as the United States prepares to withdraw its military forces. In his report Mr. Brokaw reveals what happened to the families and asks whether the war was worth it. ''Nobody wants to go to war, nobody,'' says Staff Sgt. Charles Weaver (above with his wife, Dawn, and Mr. Brokaw) of the Second Brigade, Third Infantry Division, in Iraq. ''But if you have to do it, you do whatever you have to do.'' Dr. El Rabei, the patriarch of an Iraqi family, counters, ''I would rather be dead than see American troops in the streets of Iraq and Baghdad.'' 10 A.M.

An old city where the shadows still hold a trace of vanished occupants, where detailed buildings, patiently reconquered by nature, suddenly still are there, sand castles. Through the dreamer's kaleidoscope where the absence of desire is taken as reality, birds slash through the twilight, cypress trees dive into the pool, stars sparkle in the sea, clouds take on shapes, water lilies bloom in the sky, plans become flexible, the limit to how far things can go relaxes, thought dances, light is lit by shade, opposites are juxtaposed, merge and become linked in a prelude to beauty: reverie is contemplation's prehistory, the education of the gaze by the eyes of the soul. Suddenly, the world before concepts."

2011-08-07T00:00:00Z,"DISPROVING all those spurious, borderline-offensive images of Teutonic style (typically involving lederhosen or jackboots), there's ''German Fashion Design'' (Distanz, $68), a half-century survey of one of the more easily overlooked fashion scenes in Europe. The dual-language book dutifully catalogs German fashion contributions in the realms of skiwear (Bogner), exquisitely cut office wear (Jil Sander) and great cheekbones (Claudia Schiffer). It begins in the late 1940s, when the German clothing industry, like much of the country, was still devastated by World War II. (It didn't help matters that the prewar German clothiers were mostly Jewish; the ones who survived emigrated to Seventh Avenue or thereabouts.) Meanwhile, a few visionaries like Heinz Oestergaard and Uli Richter dared to trade the apron dresses and tied-up head scarves worn by Berlin's ''rubble women'' for a more relaxed twist on Gallic chic. Mr. Oestergaard was eventually stymied by the Berlin Wall, but Mr. Richter, whose 1959 fashions are pictured below, flourished in West Germany. His clothes were sold in Bloomingdale's, and he became the first of many German designers to appear in French Vogue. STEPHEN HEYMAN"

Introduced by his uncharacteristically effusive host as a ''hero'' and the man ''responsible for rescuing the Ford Motor Company from the brink of bankruptcy,'' Mr. Mulally took his seat with a smile and a wave to the audience and, beyond it, the country Mr. Mulally hoped to sell on the Focus Electric, a purely electric compact car due in showrooms in 2012."

Once I looked up from my work and a coyote was staring at me from the hedge a dozen feet away, though not with much interest. The squirrels know he's there and stay hidden and the coyote wanders off, hoping to find a little dog in another yard. Several times I've seen a hawk, claws wrapped around the limb of an apple tree, waiting for prey who somehow know better than to reveal themselves. Distractions are good when I'm stuck in whatever it is I'm writing or have reached the point of overwriting. The hawk flies off, the squirrels begin to venture out, cautious at first, and I return to the yellow pad, my mind cleared of unnecessary words. The last in a series on what writers from around the world see from their windows."

Last month on several occasions, groups paused on their way to work for breakfast by the Tiffany front door, before the store opened. Echoes of Ms. Hepburn's boat necks are reappearing. One group, at about 8:15 a.m., included not only Holly but her film boyfriend, a Paul Varjak lookalike. On another morning, there was Mr. Yunioshi, Holly's neighbor, passing in a large Asian hat and a man's summer kimono. One wondered what Holly would look like today. Judging from passers-by, she would still be dressed in black or perhaps a dazzling red Adrian evening dress. Or a vintage 1950s Norman Norell, top, third from left. There were even some Japanese women in long kid gloves waiting for Tiffany's to open to attend a breakfast inside, left center.

2011-08-07T00:00:00Z,"OLSON--Martha, who lived in both New York City and Southampton, died peacefully at her New York home surrounded by friends on July 30, 2011 after a long illness. Martha was a proud achiever and built a distinguished career in public relations. She and two partners started a PR firm in St. Louis that was so successful it was acquired by Farley Manning in New York, where she became a Sr. Vice President. She later joined Hill & Knowlton, rising to Sr. Vice President before her retirement. During the course of her career, Martha advised such powerful clients as the Principality of Monaco, Mexico's Department of Tourism (supervising the launch of Cancun), the Virgin Islands, Anheuser-Busch, E. I. du Pont de Nemours, Pet Milk and Chevron Chemical. Her hands-on style and creative ideas earned her major industry awards, including the Prisms Award presented by the Los Angeles chapter of the Public Relations Society of America in 1980, and two years later, she was one of the first women in the country to win the Silver Anvil Award, the highest honor given by the PRSA. Martha Annette Olson was born in Ft. Stockton, Texas on Christmas day 1920, the daughter of Auburn Elizabeth Bransford and John Nels Olson, a Swedish immigrant. She spent her formative years in Parsons, Kansas before moving to St. Louis and finally to New York. In an interview with the St. Louis Post-Dispatch in January 1958 regarding her public relations success, Martha said, ""Speed somehow always seems to have been part of my life."" Indeed she loved life in the fast lane, whether driving one of her low-slung sports convertibles, flying a single-engine plane as a 19-year-old student pilot and later becoming an airport traffic controller, or much later riding her horse, Dusty, in the Hamptons. Martha is survived by her sister and brother-in-law Jean and Joseph Stevens of Montecito, CA and her brother and sister-in-law Jack and Alice Olson of the National Forest north of Tucson, AZ. She is also survived by her close friends and real estate partners Jody Donohue and Etta Froio, and her beloved Wirehaired Fox Terrier Bentley, named for one of her flashy fast cars she loved to drive.

For example, the Edna heel, a reimagined stiletto loafer, “is beetle-crusher when it’s in black and white,” she says, “and then we did a red and leopard version that has an element of Victoriana.” She’s certainly got a bead on the new monarchy. A pair of nude silk slippers looks fit for a duchess or a Park Avenue princess."

The person on the phone is generally a low-level officer, responding to a request from a superior for pricing on a large and fancy table. Our bid will be presented to the upper ranks as one of a number of ways to spend their remaining money. Consequently, we sell a much lower percentage of these inquiries than those from private clients.

This special, which captures that evening, is being shown before the release, on Aug. 23, of Ms. Streisand's album ''What Matters Most: Barbra Streisand Sings the Lyrics of Alan and Marilyn Bergman.'' In ''The Greatest Duets: It Takes Two,'' at 9:30, Kenny Loggins recalls memorable musical pairings from the 1960s, '70s and '80s, like ''Ain't No Mountain High Enough'' by Marvin Gaye and Tammi Terrell, and ''Don't Go Breaking My Heart'' by Elton John and Kiki Dee. 6 A.M. (TCM) SUMMER UNDER THE STARS: ORSON WELLES In 1939 Welles arrived in Hollywood as a 24-year-old dreamer after having convinced listeners on the East Coast that alien invaders had landed during his radio broadcast of H. G. Wells's ''War of the Worlds.'' For his first feature film, ''Citizen Kane'' (1941), he told the story of a megalomaniacal newspaper mogul who closely resembled William Randolph Hearst -- too closely, it turned out, for the comfort of Hearst, who tried to suppress the project. That movie, considered Welles's masterpiece and what Bosley Crowther, writing in The New York Times, called ''close to being the most sensational film ever made,'' is shown at 10 as part of a prime-time lineup that includes ''The Third Man'' (1949) at 8 and ''Touch of Evil'' (1958) at 12:15 a.m."
2011-08-08T00:00:00Z,"CAREY--Governor Hugh Leo (April 11, 1919 August 7, 2011). Life does not cease; it merely changes. The family of the 51st Governor of New York State gathered in their Shelter Island home to surround their beloved father, grandfather and great-grandfather as he made his peaceful journey to eternal life. In seven terms in Congress, he represented the 12th and then 15th Districts from Brooklyn and was elected unanimously to the Ways and Means Committee. A member of the 4 Horsemen, Hugh Carey joined with Ted Kennedy, Pat Moynihan and Tip O'Neill to advocate for a peaceful solution to the conflict in Northern Ireland. Hugh Carey was elected the 51st Governor of New York on November 5, 1974, the first Democrat in sixteen years, and was re-elected in 1978. As Governor he was the architect of the financial plan that averted the bankruptcy of New York City. Upon the conclusion of his time in office, the NY Times hailed him as a Governor for Hard Winters. One of his earliest acts as Governor was signing the historic Willowbrook consent decree, committing New York State to sweeping reforms in the care of the developmentally disabled. He instituted the I Love New York program and founded the Empire State Games. Following the attacks of September 11, 2001, Governor Carey was asked to represent New York State and speak at numerous funerals for fallen firefighters, throughout the five boroughs and surrounding counties. His public legacy was matched by his larger than life personal story. Born in Brooklyn, NY, he was the third of Margaret and Dennis Carey's six sons. The family persevered during the Depression and went on to form the Peerless Oil Company, a business they started as an offshoot of Margaret Collins Carey's barrel business with the great Nellie Bly. The Governor attended St. Augustine's School in Park Slope and graduated from St. John's University and St. John's University Law School. Hugh Carey married the lovely Helen Owen Twohy on February 27, 1947 in The Lady Chapel of St. Patrick's Cathedral. The Carey's love of family was demonstrated by their parenting of fourteen children: Alexandria, Christopher, Susan, the late Peter and Hugh, Jr., Michael, Donald, Marianne, Nancy, Helen, Bryan, the late Paul, Kevin and Thomas. Mrs. Carey died of cancer in March 1974. Known as much for his wit as his powerful intellect, the Governor was gifted with inimitable Irish charm and a love of song. He was proud to call the legendary Frank Sinatra his friend and adopted New York, New York as his signature song. Channeling Maurice Chevalier, he regaled guests at the many family weddings with his popular rendition of Thank Heaven for Little Girls. His sartorial taste was colorful and impeccable. He found great joy in his 25 grand children and six great-grandchildren. Among his many awards and recognitions, his favorite was an honorary degree in Elan and Joie de Vivre. His larger than life spirit was indomitable; friends and family knew him simply as Huge. In lieu of flowers, donations may be sent to The Lady Chapel at St. Patrick's Cathedral; St. John's University, or The Paul R. Carey Foundation, 22 Corporate Woods Blvd., Albany, NY 12211. The family wishes to acknowledge the many doctors and caregivers who have been devoted to our father in his final years, bringing a singular life to a dignified and peaceful close, or rather the beginning of his next chapter. Excelsior!"

Carey, the governor who helped rescue New York from the brink of financial collapse in the 1970s and tamed a culture of ever-growing spending, died Sunday at his summer home on Shelter Island, N.Y.

''Governor Carey led our state during a time of great financial turmoil and pulled us back from the brink of bankruptcy and economic ruin,'' Mr. Cuomo said in the statement."

She was 88. The cause was cancer, said Joan K. Harris, her friend and executor."
2011-08-08T00:00:00Z,"In the end, it was not the opposition of East Hampton, N.Y., locals worried about a Woodstock in their quiet seaside enclave but lackluster ticket sales that doomed the Music to Know Festival on Long Island next weekend. Just six days before the festival was to be held on an unused runway at the East Hampton Airport, the promoters -- Chris Jones, a Montauk hotelier, and his partner, Bill Collage, a screenwriter -- posted an announcement online saying ''the ticket sales were not adequate to allow the event to continue.'' Mr. Jones had lined up an impressive list of indie bands, led by Vampire Weekend and Bright Eyes. He had also overcome significant resistance in the Hamptons, where many residents worried the two-festival meant an invasion of rowdy rock fans that would snarl traffic on the narrow road running from the Shinnecock to Montauk. But the tickets, which were selling for $195 for a two-day pass, didn't move, and the festival did not have major corporate sponsors, with the exception of some support from Bing, the search engine. The passes were priced fairly high for a new festival. By comparison, Bonnaroo, the giant event in Tennessee, cost between $210 and $250 for a four-day pass to see a lineup that includes the biggest names in popular music. One reason for the lack of ticket sales might have been competition from a similar festival at the Shinnecock reservation this weekend, Escape to New York, which went off smoothly."

She is survived by two children: Eric (Linda) Horodas and Susan (Joel) Goldstein, and two grandchildren, Kevin Horodas and Marc Horodas. She was predeceased in 1995 by her husband of 49 years, Bernard Stuart Horodas. She was the daughter of Maurice S. Handler who built Smart Maid Suit & Co., one of America's leading coat and suit manufacturers during and after WWII. After marrying her beloved husband Bud upon his return from service in the Army Medical Core in the European Theater of Operations in World War II, she completed her education by obtaining a Bachelor's Degree in Anthropology from New York University. She was an avid world traveler, having visited over 30 countries around the world with Bud. She was a patron of the arts, a lifelong subscriber to both the New York Philharmonic and the New York Opera. She was very active in many volunteer causes including Hadassah, but her passion was museum work. In a volunteer capacity, she created the archives at the Katonah Museum, in Katonah, New York. Shirley was a devoted wife and mother, like her father, a loyal supporter of the philanthropies to which she was committed, and all those whose lives she touched will miss her terribly.

2011-08-08T00:00:00Z,"Computer-generated primates, yes. Extreme scatological humor? No. That sums up Hollywood's weekend, as ''Rise of the Planet of the Apes'' took in about $54 million at North American theaters and ''The Change-Up,'' an ultra-crude comedy (it opens with a baby defecating in Jason Bateman's mouth), landed with a $13.5 million thud. The strong No. 1 result for ''Rise of the Planet of the Apes,'' which cost 20th Century Fox about $100 million to produce and won mostly rapturous reviews, validates that studio's bet on computerized visual effects; no live apes were used to make the movie. ''The Smurfs'' (Sony Pictures Entertainment) finished second, selling about $21 million in tickets for a two-week total of $76 million, according to Hollywood.com, which compiles box-office data. ''Cowboys & Aliens'' (Universal Pictures/DreamWorks Studios) limped along third place, taking in an estimated $15.7 million in its second weekend for a total of $67 million."

2011-08-08T00:00:00Z,"Having successfully extended the Lollapalooza franchise to Chile this year, the founder of the influential alternative rock festival in Chicago has announced that he will start a second sister festival in Brazil next spring. The event, Lollapalooza Brazil, will be held April 7-8 at the Jockey Club de Sao Paulo, a large horse-racing track in one of Latin America's largest cities, festival officials said. Perry Farrell, who founded Lollapalooza 20 years ago, announced his intention to expand to Brazil as the United States festival got under way at Grant Park in Chicago. Mr. Farrell, who is also the flamboyant lead singer in Jane's Addiction, said that Brazilians ''have a very rich history of celebration'' and ''there's no telling what heights that party will reach.'' There may be no telling what height the profits will reach either. The strong response to the first Lollapalooza festival in Santiago, Chile, last April suggests there is an appetite in Latin America for the sort of large festivals that have become profitable over the last decade in the United States. Eminem did extremely well at the same racetrack in November, showing that an English-speaking star from the United States could sell out a 25,000-seat venue in Sao Paolo. The two-day Lollapalooza event will use more of the racetrack and is expected to draw about 60,000 people a day, festival promoters said."

As Dean, Wellington had a major impact on the image and reputation of New York Law School, by putting together and overseeing a first-rate faculty, whose well-established scholarship continues to earn respect and admiration from the legal community. He remained Dean of New York Law School for nine years until 2001, and in 2007, he retired from teaching. He also served on the Law School's Board of Trustees. Dean Wellington was awarded the President's Medal of Honor during the Law School's 2011 Commencement Exercises for his significant contributions to the history of New York Law School. During his distinguished career, Dean Wellington's numerous writings on legal process earned him a reputation as a scholar whose nuance and subtle style, just as in his teaching and lecturing, served to illuminate complex issues and to make them completely comprehensible. The Law School community will remember Dean Wellington's inspiring leadership, unswerving dedication to the rule of law, and devotion to teaching and to the legal profession. We extend our condolences to his wife Sheila and his children and grandchildren. Arthur N. Abbey, Chairman of the Board of Trustees Richard A. Matasar Dean and President"
2011-08-10T00:00:00Z,"DEMARAY--Barbara L.,died on July 23, 2011 at Somerset Medical Center. Daughter of Howard H. Demaray and Idabelle C. Demaray, she was a member of one of Somerville's, (NJ) oldest families, occupying the home on West Cliff Street that had been purchased by her grandfather, Lyman H. Demaray in 1896. For most of her career Ms. Demaray was a writer, creative director and vice-president of Young & Rubicam, Inc., the international advertising agency. She served her company in its New York offices, as well as in Hollywood, Copenhagen, Mexico City, the Dominican Republic and Toronto. During a two-year leave of absence from Y&R, she joined the staff of The Children's Television Network in the planning and introduction of Sesame Street. She also designed windows using her wonderfully fanciful creations for Lord and Taylor's and for Tiffany's flagship store on Fifth Avenue in New York City. After retiring in 1986 in Toronto, she continued doing some consulting for a few more years, and eventually embraced full retirement. She maintained residences in Toronto and Somerville, enjoying spending time with friends and their families until finally returning to her family home in Somerville, NJ in 2004. She was a member of St. John's Episcopal Church in Somerville. There are no immediate survivors. A memorial service will be held Saturday, August 13 at 10:00am at St John's Episcopal Church, Somerville. Contributions in her memory can be made to The Nature Conservancy."

2011-08-10T00:00:00Z,"There's a scene in ''The Help,'' the new movie based on Kathryn Stockett's novel, that cracks open the early-'60s world of strained smiles and gentility that rarely leaps out of this big, ole slab of honey-glazed hokum. It's after hours, and Aibileen, a maid played with determined grace by Viola Davis, is going home. Suddenly the bus stops, and a white man orders the black passengers off, explaining that a black man has been shot -- except that he doesn't say black, Negro or colored. In a pool of dreadful night, Aibileen and a young man trade goodbyes and rush off. And then this sturdy, frightened woman starts running as if her life were in danger, because it's Mississippi, and it is. When she gets to safety, Aibileen learns that the man who has been shot is Medgar Evers, the civil rights activist who was gunned down in Jackson, Miss., on June 12, 1963, in front of his home. His wife and three young children, who were trained to lie on the floor in case of gunfire, found him, and Evers died shortly afterward. Hours before, President John F. Kennedy, spurred on by different national events, including the demonstrations in Birmingham led by the Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King Jr., had delivered his landmark speech about civil rights. He said we were facing a ''moral crisis as a country and a people'' and soon introduced legislation that would become the Civil Rights Act of 1964, the same year ''The Help'' rises to its teary, insistently uplifting end."

2011-08-10T00:00:00Z,"10 P.M. (Sundance) MY WINNIPEG (2008) In his rumination on what A. O. Scott, writing in The New York Times, called ''the deep and accidental relationship between a specific place and an individual life,'' Guy Maddin pays tribute to his Canadian hometown and its quirks. Among his assertions: that Winnipeg has two taxi companies, one working the major streets, and the other confined to the back alleys; that some streets were named after well-known prostitutes and brothel owners; that horses, fleeing a fire in the 1920s, froze to death in the river, where their icebound heads became props for skaters (above); and that the city fathers used to sponsor an annual treasure hunt in which first prize was a one-way ticket out of town. Are the stories true? ''To be honest, I'd rather not know,'' Mr. Scott said. ''Fact-checking 'My Winnipeg' would be absurd, since the film, which combines archival documentary images with freshly shot, antique-looking passages, is more concerned with lyrical truth than with literal accuracy.'' He added: ''Much as he may dream of taking that one-way rail journey to somewhere else, Mr. Maddin can no more spurn Winnipeg than it can disown him. In a thoughtful, occasionally excitable voice-over he dutifully tries to explain the place -- its riverine topography and wintry climate, its civic traditions and architectural landmarks. But his real point -- and, for admirers of this brilliant and idiosyncratic artist, the true source of the movie's interest -- is that Winnipeg explains him.'' 6 A.M. (TCM) SUMMER UNDER THE STARS: SHIRLEY MacLAINE This 24-hour tribute to Ms. MacLaine, a former ballet dancer turned chorus girl and Ocar-winning actress, begins with ''Two Loves'' (1961), in which she plays a conservative teacher who struggles with her values while working with native islanders in New Zealand. The prime-time segment starts at 8 p.m. with ''The Apartment'' (1960), starring Jack Lemmon as an aspiring executive who lets his bosses use his apartment for assignations, only to fall for the mistress (Ms. MacLaine) of the big chief."

I was glad to see both on a recent trip, but I was also lucky to spot a sign for another, less-heralded exhibition at the museum. “Plastique Ludique” (“Playful Plastic”), which runs until Nov. 6, presents the work of the Czech toy designer Libuse Niklova (1934-1981), whose work with plastics, particularly in the 1960s and ’70s, changed the look — and the nature — of toys in her native country. Niklova believed that children should be able to play as creatively as possible, and the development of plastics after World War II offered a helpful tool. Her inflatable buffalo, giraffe and elephant, with their simplified, graphic silhouettes and bright, pop colors, could be used as chairs or pool toys for small children. (The three have been reissued in limited numbers and are for sale at the museum’s shop.) And Niklova’s ingenious use of pleated plastic piping produced animals with accordion-like midsections that squealed when squeezed. In contrast to the Chalayan and Lauren exhibitions, which are about the more expensive pleasures of the material world, “Plastique Ludique” offers a surprising, refreshing look at a more modest — yet no less inventive — endeavor."

What he likes about the Pradas, he explains, is “the mix of sharp tailoring and casual leisure.” Having held his post for little over a year, he has pushed Adidas to hybridize in a similar manner. “When I’m in Berlin and I see how the young guys and girls are dressing, none of them are wearing sneakers anymore. So you think, if these are the target consumers, and we are only selling sneakers, well, what are we going to do?” The answer may be found in Adidas SLVR. Priced somewhere between Originals and Y-3 (also under Schoenberger’s purview), the line has been reimagined for fall under his personal design stewardship. “It’s amazing for such a big company to be so open for discussions,” he says. With SLVR, it is a “new approach but still very much in the language of Adidas.”"

His support for the 1979 CUNY Financing and Governance Act and for major campus construction projects in all five boroughs were milestones in public higher education investment. His passion for public service, compassion for the less fortunate, and keen wit will be sorely missed. Our deepest condolences are extended to his beloved family.

A. Scout around for a photo-sharing site that meets your needs in terms of the amount of data you can upload, as well as privacy options. Depending on what Web services you already use, you may have photo-sharing space and not realize it. For example, Hotmail users can take advantage of Microsoft's Windows Live SkyDrive to upload and share photos and Gmail users can easily get started with Google's Picasa Web albums."

2011-08-11T00:00:00Z,"'IRVING JANIS'S GROUPTHINK AND THE SANHEDRIN OF ANCIENT ISRAEL' by Eliezer Schnall, a psychologist at Yeshiva University, and his student, Michael Greenberg. Presented at the American Psychological Association convention in Washington on Aug. 7. THE ARGUMENT One of the most influential theories in the behavioral sciences in recent decades is ''groupthink.'' Developed by the psychologist Irving Janis in the early 1970s, that theory describes how a tight-knit, smart and well-informed group can suppress dissent and make disastrous decisions because of the pressure to agree. As examples Janis used the failure to anticipate the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor in 1941 and the American escalation of the Vietnam War in the mid-'60s. Mr. Schnall argues that decision making entities in the ancient world may have been aware of the danger of conformist thought and developed methods similar to Janis's recommended preventatives. He examines, in particular, the practices of the Sanhedrin, the judicial and legislative body of ancient Israel."
2011-08-11T00:00:00Z,"LESSIN--Robert Howard. Citizen of the World and reluctant but reliable Englewood, NJ taxpayer, died on August 9, 2011 at age 56. Thinker, teacher, and financier, Bob lived his life with a passion for the present and his eyes keenly fixed on the future. He was always original and true to himself. Bob was born in Brooklyn and attended school in Lexington, MA and Ardsley, NY. He was the youngest Eagle Scout in Massachusetts history. Bob graduated in three years from Harvard College (AB '76) having studied economics and applied physics and continued immediately on to Harvard Business School (MBA '78). After graduating, he joined Morgan Stanley as an investment banking associate and became a rising star in its fledging mergers and acquisitions group. In 1980 he married Naida S. Wharton, with whom he had three children, Sam, Daniel, and Kara. He went on to run Smith Barney's investment bank. In 1994 he suffered a stroke; during his recovery, he wrote The Middle Chapters in which he projected social and financial changes stemming from the Internet and other changes in technology. He followed his own advice and left to become a prolific angel investor, founding Dawntreader, a VC fund. He became the Chairman and CEO of Wit Capital, a pioneering investment bank, which he took public and which was later sold to Schwab. He joined Jefferies in 2002 as vice chairman, a position he held until his death. More important to Bob than his resume were his wanderings, both global and intellectual. He skied, biked, kayaked, or walked his way across most of the earth with his second wife Clara Wong at his side (and sometimes with his dogs, Kismet and Chinta, as well). The beaches of Cape Cod, the slopes of Beaver Creek, the shores of Cyprus and the woods of New Jersey were all home to him. He drank in knowledge from every person and place he met and returned deep insights on life and economics back to the community through his friends and his writings. He taught his children his unique life lessons at bedtime, over the dinner table, during games of catch and on long hikes in Flat Rock Brook. Later, nothing made him happier than teaching students at De Le Salle Academy and George Jackson Academy. Teaching, he often remarked, provides the ultimate geometric return on investment, a criteria he broadly embraced. He loved nature; he loved people; and he loved his family. He made lifelong friends everywhere he went, and they will never forget him. His insights and contributions will live on forever. He is survived by his wife Clara, his three children and their mother Naida, his parents Irving and Phyllis Lessin, of Potomac, MD, as well as his brother Larry Lessin, sister-in-law Deborah Lessin and niece and nephew Jessica and Austin. A public memorial service will be held Friday, August 12 at 10am at the Harvard Club, 35 West 44th Street, New York. In lieu of flowers, the family asks that donations be made in Bob's memory to George Jackson Academy, 104 St. Marks Place, New York NY 10009. Attn.: David Arnold."

A microphone can hear detect sound codes that trigger jokes or dance moves that Mattel calls ''Sonic Chirps,'' a technology that has been around before, but has been modified in this case by Mattel engineers to interact with external media, like TV commercials, web sites or YouTube videos. A similar concept was tried with Microsoft's Actimates back in 1997, but instead of using high frequencies, you can hear these codes - they sound like high pitched dial tones that can catch the attention of any nearby cat.

But the biggest criticism Auto-Tune’s critics level against it is that it’s the sonic equivalent of plastic surgery or ‘roids, a digital fix that lets lousy singers skip over that whole learning-to-carry-a-tune thing (boring!) and cut straight to pop stardom’s V.I.P. room. And there’s some truth to that — while the listening public’s acceptance of Auto-Tune has undeniably opened up new avenues of expression for rappers and singers, it’s also enabled some of the world’s most annoying famous people to annoy us in new ways. (Note: We mean no disrespect by including Drake here — his Auto-Tune songs are actually pretty great. But he started out as an actor, so technically he belongs in this category. Hopefully the fact that he is a rich, beautiful man will soften the blow.)"

Kern and his partner, Stephanie Danan, film producer and fashion designer, have founded Co, a collection of luxurious mega-basics: slip dresses, silk tanks and skirts, L.B.D.’s, skinny leather pants and the kind of big old fancy furs that Margot Tenenbaum would adore. The Royal Tenenbaum, in fact, is the personification of the Co customer — a woman who pictures herself in a variety of cinematic situations. To illuminate this idea, Kern and Danan (far right) collaborated with the actress Élodie Bouchez and the director Thomas Bangalter of Daft Punk on a four-minute film that they describe as a period piece with a sci-fi twist. (The film will have its premiere on T’s Web site during Fashion Week.) “We wanted to give the clothes an identity through the characters that we imagine inhabiting them,” Danan says.
