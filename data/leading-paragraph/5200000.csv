After interviews of several hospital administrators, their opinion is passed along that the hospital nurse shortage is due to declining nursing school enrollments. Those declining enrollments, however, are the symptom, not the cause: The shortage is being caused by the administrators themselves."

In late May, the I.R.S. began a formal program to clear up a backlog of tax-shelter cases by offering 75,000 investors a one-shot chance to settle.

The scrutiny of those two successful pitchers has eased, but the subject of illegal pitches is never far from the surface. Probably with good reason.

1987-08-16T00:00:00Z,"LEAD: Chadian forces last week resoundingly defeated the forces of Muammar el-Qaddafi, which have long occupied much of their country. Chadian means are as pleasing as their goal: clever tactics to defeat the Libyans' advanced Soviet weaponry."

Marcos from the presidency 18 months ago, then turned against her and was dismissed, resumed his attacks on the Aquino Administration last week from his new position as a senator. He seemed ready to use the post in his role as the chief political opponent of the president."
1987-08-16T00:00:00Z,"LEAD: JESSE HELMS and Viktor P. Karpov do not often agree, but the Republican senator from North Carolina and the Soviet arms-control official are in accord on at least one important matter - the new Soviet mobile missile, the SS-24. Senator Helms said recently that Moscow was in the initial stages of deploying the 10-warhead SS-24."
1987-08-16T00:00:00Z,"LEAD: Gov. Bill Clinton of Arkansas and his wife, Hillary Rodham Clinton, say his decision not to run for President was simply a more public version of the decisions that millions of couples in their generation have had to make in recent years."

1987-08-16T00:00:00Z,"LEAD: It is unfortunate that altered bats and balls are now and always have, to some extent, been a part of major league baseball. It is equally unfortunate, however, that the regulation strike zone (the armpits to the knees) is no longer a part of the major leagues."
1987-08-16T00:00:00Z,"LEAD: SINCE 1931 the incomprehensibility of ''Finnegans Wake'' has been justified by the explanation that James Joyce was inventing the language of the dreaming mind. That theory, offered by Edmund Wilson in ''Axel's Castle,'' gave readers courage to plow through a book that opens forbiddingly -''riverrun, past Eve and Adam's, from swerve of shore to bend of bay, brings us by a commodious vicus of recirculation back to Howth Castle and Environs'' - and gets worse."
1987-08-16T00:00:00Z,"LEAD: Paris Terminal Question: Where can I find the Charles de Gaulle Airport bus terminal in Paris? - F. M. R., Wilmington, Del. Answer: The terminal for Charles de Gaulle Airport buses is at Porte Maillot (also a Metro stop) in the Palais des Congres convention center.

But many factors - faster-than-expected growth, changing patterns of water use or a summer without rain - can still confound those plans. What follows are reports on how different regions are coping with the problems of providing enough water to their industries, households and farms."
1987-08-16T00:00:00Z,"LEAD: RONALD Reagan came into the Presidency in January 1981 with pledges to make the United States a stronger country than ever before, one that would be respected, even feared, in the rest of the world."

1987-08-16T00:00:00Z,"LEAD: AHEAD OF THE TIMES IS no picnic. Ask August Darnell, whose band, Kid Creole and the Coconuts, forecast late-1980's urban pop back in 1980, when Mr. Darnell became Kid Creole full time. The band Mr. Darnell and the songwriter-arranger Andy (Coati Mundi) Hernandez formed from the remnants of Dr. Buzzard's Original Savannah Band set out to make real New York pop the way they heard it - all the sounds of the city from Broadway to the Bronx, from Tin Pan Alley to the Caribbean enclaves of Brooklyn and Queens."

But in this case, the fans will be watching not Dwight Gooden or Don Mattingly but Andy Roberts and Clive Lloyd."
1987-08-16T00:00:00Z,"LEAD: John le Carre has a lot to answer for. Thanks to him the British espionage novel has developed a kind of writing as murky as the bottom of the Atlantic shelf. Characters talk elliptically and allusively. Nobody seems to know exactly what is going on, including the masters who dangle their marionettes."
1987-08-16T00:00:00Z,"LEAD: The South Korean economy has boomed with considerable help from 57-hour work weeks and $1.75-an-hour industrial wages that enabled Korean exporters to undercut many competitors in the United States and other markets.

1987-08-16T00:00:00Z,"LEAD: THE increasing popularity of fish in the American diet has helped push the price of highly prized species - including Atlantic and Pacific salmon, various flatfishes and tunas, and Atlantic cod - beyond the cost of a first-rate cut of beef, and this, if nothing else, should inspire treating such fare with more respect than that accorded the thigh of a chicken."
1987-08-16T00:00:00Z,"LEAD: Behind a two-way mirror on the door of a freshly painted house here, intelligence experts say, is North Korea's new overseas center for espionage."

1987-08-16T00:00:00Z,"LEAD: THE REDESIGNED AND RE-installed new galleries at the Art Institute of Chicago are by common consent a model of what such things should be.

The sentence should have read: ''At a time when artists were defining reality as the materials of the art surface, or as shapes without any trace of illusionistic reference, or as the intuitive idea itself, Warhol defined reality as images already in the public consciousness."
1987-08-16T00:00:00Z,"LEAD: Another cache of documents, including letters signed by Ulysses S. Grant, has been discovered in a safe-deposit box of Charles Merrill Mount, a portrait painter and art historian who was arrested in Boston Thursday on Federal charges of interstate transportation of stolen property, the authorities said today."
