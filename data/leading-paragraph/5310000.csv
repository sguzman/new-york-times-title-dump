We're as apt to get our facts from lightly embroidered versions of real events as from the events themselves. The television movie, which can proudly base itself on a true story and then touch up the story to suit the audience's taste, has paved the way for this development, but television drama in itself is rarely alarming."

In keeping with its title, this new-composers group takes its styles where it finds them, but it does seem to be looking in a few specific places.

If we were told that he was the head of the department of moral philosophy at an ancient and low-key university, we would have no trouble believing it.

A few months after it opened, it had become a center for improvisational music, at the nexus of risky, format-defying new jazz, new rock and the postmodern assemblages of downtown composers - the tumultuous piano solos of Cecil Taylor, the quick-change artistry of John Zorn, the geometrically proportioned slabs of noise composed by Elliott Sharp, the dreamlike performance-rock of Hugo Largo or the skewed, clattery funk of Curlew."

A wheat field-wholesome young man named Wade (Andrew McCarthy) is on his way to New York City. After his car burns up, he jumps on a freight train where he meets a drifter named Doyle (Matt Dillon) and is so unfazed by his sinister looks - the gold tooth and the panther tattooed on his forearm might have made most folks suspicious - that he hops off the train with his new friend. Following Doyle's lead, the impressionable Wade breaks into a house, goes to a parade where he spots the girl of his dreams and robs a bank. But while he is fleeing the bank, a car carrying the Governor's small daughter falls into the river, so Wade saves the child from drowning, runs away and hides the money - all this before lunchtime. Soon he finds work at a farm owned by the father of the girl of his dreams, a convenient place to roll in the hay, literally, while the town searches for the mystery hero. The plot slows down after that, but does not get less incredible. The characters never become intriguing, though we're supposed to wonder about Wade's moral direction when he hangs onto the money, lies to Doyle and is uncovered as the hero."

''Opening Night,'' previously unreleased in the United States, is a reminder of what has made Mr. Cassavetes' films so appealing, and of what can make them so maddening, too.

Like politicians on the stump, they're busy demonstrating their idealism, their empathy with the common folk, their good intentions, their sincerity. While a little responsibility on the part of people with mass-media exposure doesn't hurt, some mainstream rockers - Steve Winwood, George Michael, Def Leppard, Huey Lewis and dozens of others -have grown so protective of their images that they won't touch iffy, ambivalent or dangerous subjects and emotions."
