Kazutaka Kurihara, one of the SpeechJammer's creators, sees it as a tool to prevent loudmouths from overtaking meetings and public forums, and he'd like to miniaturize his invention so that it can be built into cellphones. ''It's different from conventional weapons such as samurai swords,'' Kurihara says. ''We hope it will build a more peaceful world.''"

2012-06-03T00:00:00Z,"The typical plane cabin is drier than the Arizona desert, and the air is so thin it feels as if you were visiting Machu Picchu. This brutal environment contributes to the parched, exhausted feeling you get after you fly. But there are already planes in the air -- made mostly of carbon fiber -- that solve this problem. Carbon fiber is markedly stronger by weight than the aluminum used for most existing planes, which means that the interior air pressure can be adjusted to more comfortable levels without the risk of damaging the fuselage. Airlines also keep humidity levels low now to prevent the plane's metal skin from corroding, but carbon fiber doesn't rust. That will allow a new system to maintain humidity at a more comfortable 15 percent (up from around 5 to 10 percent). Japan Airlines and Nippon Airlines bought the first crop of these new planes. They're currently in service between Tokyo and Boston."

2012-06-03T00:00:00Z,"A movie projector flashes 24 images across the screen each second to create the illusion of motion -- kind of like a flipbook. The directors James Cameron and Peter Jackson propose kicking that number to 48 or even 60 frames per second. It'll change the way we experience movies: colors will appear brighter, images sharper, motion smoother. Steven Poster, president of the International Cinematographers Guild, says the effect can be ''almost holographic in quality.'' Proponents say it's what 3-D was supposed to feel like -- a kind of immersive reality. Still, the image quality takes some getting used to. At an industry conference where Jackson previewed scenes featuring higher-frame-rate hobbits, critics complained that the hyperclarity made the scenes look like live television rather than cinema. It will doubtless take some getting used to. ''When sound came out, a lot of people said this will last about three years,'' says cinema-studies professor Tom Gunning of the University of Chicago. ''Instead it became totally dominant and wiped silent film off the map.''"

Take Ms. Leach's second ''California'' collection. It includes not only simple and thoughtfully designed striped tees in fresh West Coast colors, but also all of the things that support a summer well spent wearing them: sheared cotton towels that read ''Seashore'' and ''Poolside,'' espadrilles, Turkish foutas (multiuse textiles) and straw fedoras, to start. And the designer just added a limited edition long-sleeve style featuring a wiggly stripe hand-drawn by the artist Elliott Puckette. ''I wanted the shirt to appear to be a canvas,'' Ms. Leach said. ''I didn't want trims or excessive stitching to interfere with the grace of the lines.'' Available in four colors (soft black, pink, sky blue and pool blue), the Pima cotton T-shirts echo Ms. Puckette's preferred palette. ''Ordinarily I etch the lines in my paintings, which is fairly laborious and slow,'' she said. ''I found the process of drawing these lines instead very meditative and fluid.'' At left, the artist Leanne Shapton surrounds herself with all four. Wouldn't you? Chance Elliott Stripe T-shirts, $98 each. Go to chanceco.com. JANE HERMAN"

2012-06-03T00:00:00Z,"WHO doesn't love some good old-fashioned pomp and circumstance? Certainly not the people at BBC America, who have devoted two days to the celebration of QUEEN ELIZABETH II'S DIAMOND JUBILEE. The pageantry begins Sunday at 8:45 a.m. (all times are Eastern) as a flotilla of more than 1,000 boats adorned with streamers and Union Jacks sails down the Thames. A marathon of royal tell-alls, including multiple showings of ''William & Kate: A Fairytale Romance,'' leads up to ''The Diamond Queen,'' at 8 p.m. This three-hour assessment by Andrew Marr of the queen's 60-year reign -- only Victoria ruled longer -- analyzes the effect of the royal family on British trade and international relations as well as strategies to modernize the monarchy. On Tuesday at 3:30 a.m. early risers can catch the queen and Prince Philip as they attend a service of thanksgiving at St. Paul's Cathedral, followed by a formal carriage procession. Even the Americans are getting in on the party. ''Concert for the Queen: A Diamond Jubilee Celebration With Katie Couric,'' Tuesday at 9 p.m. on ABC, stars Elton John, Paul McCartney, Tom Jones, Annie Lennox, Will.i.am and Jessie J. performing in front of Buckingham Palace in a 21st-century take on royal fireworks music."

The car was exhumed recently, wearing a thick patina of dust, from the former estate of William K. Vanderbilt II in Centerport, N.Y., on Long Island, and is scheduled to be featured at the concours, its first public viewing since 1986. Commissioned by Walter P.

2012-06-03T00:00:00Z,"In his guest Ethicist column, Andrew Light argues that the people we are closest to can make special claims on us. But the woman whose question he responds to reports ''no relationship'' with the troubled brother whom she is contemplating taking care of. More critically, Light underestimates the woman's obligations to her own daughter. He overlooks that she has a legal responsibility as a parent -- as well as a moral responsibility, since she presumably chose to have a child. She has no such obligations to a brother. Consequently, Light's recommendation that the woman ''ought'' to draw on her experience as a sibling sounds like a moralistic push into a self-sacrificing caretaker role. I wonder whether Light, as a male, would accept such a role for himself."

Ridge Diagnostics has also started to roll out a test analyzing 10 biomarkers linked to depression in adults. ''Part of the reason there's a stigma for mental illness, including depression, is that people think it's only in their heads,'' Redei says. ''As long as there's no measurable, objective sign, we're going to stay in that mind-set of 'Just snap out of it.' '' Blood tests will take mental illness out of the squishy realm of feelings. And as Lonna Williams, C.E.O. of Ridge Diagnostics, says, they'll help people understand ''it's not their fault.''"

''Family dinner was our opportunity to sit together and enjoy her cooking: salads with tomatoes or avocados from the garden, shepherd's pie and schnitzel -- she's English with an Austrian background.'' His mother now lives in Lucca, Italy, and Mr. Suarez has named his new restaurant for her. In the space that once housed Cushman's and then Sutter's Bakery, Mr. Suarez has Wade Moises, former chef de cuisine of Eataly, overseeing a kitchen that makes fresh pasta and focaccia, as well as dishes prepared with ingredients grown in the organic garden on the roof.

Following is a selection of reader comments from nytimes.com: The way we differentiate our Lake George property from those of absentee home ''investors'' is that we take it seriously as a business: we live on-site, we update our Web site frequently, and we find Vacation Rentals.com to be the most cost-effective of the big-boy aggregators. Certainly that level of engagement is something we don't typically see from the individual owners of one or two units. Also, in contrast to the expense of something like Europe or even Disney World, a 2- or 3-hour-drive vacation makes for a more affordable trip in these economic times. We also, when the sites allow it, look to link directly to our personal site from the one we're advertising on. Results? Our best season last year (out of three so far), and on target to match that this year."

But for various reasons -- you're at work, or you're in a hospital, or your spouse is allergic to dogs -- you can't always have a pet around to improve your mental health. So researchers at the University of British Columbia have created something called ''smart fur.'' It's weird-looking (essentially just a few inches of faux fur) but its sensors allow it to mimic the reaction of a live animal whether you give it a nervous scratch or a slow, calm rub. Creepy? Yes.

2012-06-03T00:00:00Z,"Memorial Day weekend was a great preview of summer, with women deciding for themselves what lengths their skirts would be and how high they would wear their shorts. There's no fashion indecision today: women know what they want to wear. At 10 p.m. on Saturday, Penn Station was filled with young suburbanites in miniskirts, balancing on high heels and platforms as they went off for a night on the town (and later, probably, sore feet). At the Port Authority, visitors were piling out of buses in new versions of sequined hot pants and ankle boots. In Times Square, it was more of the same. During the day, it's another story: long skirts prevail, many with thigh-high slits and shirttail hems -- above the knee in front and long in back. But most intriguing are the transparent, diaphanous long skirts that fully display the legs."
2012-06-03T00:00:00Z,"What's the new psychological trick for improving performance? Strategic lying. When amateur golfers were told, falsely, that a club belonged to the professional golfer Ben Curtis, they putted better than other golfers using the same club. For a study published in March, human cyclists were pitted against a computer-generated opponent moving at, supposedly, the exact speed the cyclist had achieved in an earlier time trial. In fact, the avatars were moving 2 percent faster, and the human cyclists matched them, reaching new levels of speed. Lying is obviously not a long-term strategy -- once you realize what's going on, the effects may evaporate. It works as long as your trainer can keep the secret."

2012-06-03T00:00:00Z,"WEDGED between the communities of Glendale, Los Feliz and Silver Lake in East Los Angeles, lesser-known Atwater Village was nothing more than a poppy field until the early 20th century. As the decades passed, a neighborhood was established; streetcars arrived and Spanish-style houses were built. The Tam O'Shanter inn, dating from 1922, was frequented by Walt Disney himself. Today, this tiny area continues to attract aspiring homeowners looking for historic fixer-uppers and a sense of community. On weekends, the neighborhood's hub of activity, Glendale Boulevard, comes alive: locals line up for tacos, to catch a yoga class or to gather for brunch at the longtime fixture Canelé. In the last few years, that strip, and the area around it, has continued to see the addition of businesses, shops and restaurants, cementing Atwater's status as a bona fide pocket of Angeleno-style bohemia.

The trip is the first such excursion from Geek Nation Tours, which has offered tours of Las Vegas during the convention, in addition to others surrounding events like Comic-Con. The trip, from Aug. 4 to 13, was arranged by Teras Cassidy, the owner of Geek Nation Tours, in consultation with Larry Nemecek, a Star Trek authority. It includes stops at the Griffith Observatory (and the Leonard Nimoy Theater), the Tillman water plant, which was the site of the Starfleet Academy in the New Generation, and the Trona Pinnacles (above), a backdrop used in ''Star Trek V,'' before heading into Las Vegas for the convention."
2012-06-03T00:00:00Z,"Researchers at Wharton, Yale and Harvard have figured out how to make employees feel less pressed for time: force them to help others. According to a recent study, giving workers menial tasks or, surprisingly, longer breaks actually leads them to believe that they have less time, while having them write to a sick child, for instance, makes them feel more in control and ''willing to commit to future engagements despite their busy schedules.'' The idea is that completing an altruistic task increases your sense of productivity, which in turn boosts your confidence about finishing everything else you need to do."

''This tech,'' says Dr. Philip Low, the founder of a medical technology firm called NeuroVigil, ''enables us to look for faint signals of, say, schizophrenia, Parkinson's, depression or Alzheimer's in the brain, even though there may be no obvious symptoms.'' Thus far, Low's device has found a number of applications: evaluating children with autism, studying the efficacy of trial-phase drugs and assessing traumatic brain injury in soldiers. Currently, Low is working on a newer version of the device, which will be the size of a quarter and will transmit brain scans directly to smartphones and tablet computers.

Instead of plastic crawl tubes, there should be tall, steep slides. And balance beams. And rope swings. The rationale is that the more we shield children from potential scrapes and sprained ankles, the more unprepared they'll be for real risk as adults, and the less aware they'll be of their surroundings. Leif Kennair and Ellen Sandseter's ideas have won the support of playground experts on both sides of the Atlantic; one company, Landscape Structures, offers a 10-foot-high climbing wall that twists like a Möbius strip."

But what if you could eat them? ''We've got to package in the same way nature does,'' says a Harvard bioengineer named David Edwards. And so he has devised a way to convert foods into shell-like containers and films that he calls Wikicells. Yogurt will be encased in a strawberry pouch, for instance. You could wash and eat the packaging, like the skin of an apple, or you could toss it, like the peel of an orange, since it's biodegradable. The newly wrapped ice cream and yogurt will be available later this month at the lab store in Paris, with juice and tea coming within the next year or two."

2012-06-03T00:00:00Z,"Frozen food may soon be on par with anything you can get at a three-star restaurant. Sous vide -- a process in which food is heated over a very long period in a low-temperature water bath -- has been used in high-end restaurants for more than a decade. (Thomas Keller and Daniel Boulud were early proponents.) But the once-rarefied technique is becoming mass market. Cuisine Solutions, the company that pioneered sous vide (Keller hired it to train his chefs), now supplies food to grocery stores and the U.S. military. Your local Costco or Wegmans may sell perfectly cooked sous vide lamb shanks, osso buco or turkey roulade. Unlike most meals in the freezer aisle, sous vide food can be reheated in a pot of boiling water and still taste as if it were just prepared. And because sous vide makes it almost impossible to overcook food, it's perfect for the home cook. Fortunately, sous vide machines are becoming more affordable. ''It's like the microwave was 30 years ago,'' Keller says."

When used to line your shirt -- or even your pillowcase or office chair -- it converts subtle differences in temperature across the span of the clothing (say, from your cuff to your armpit) into electricity. And because the different parts of your shirt can vary by about 10 degrees, you could power up your MP3 player just by sitting still. According to the fabric's creator, David Carroll, a cellphone case lined with the material could boost the phone's battery charge by 10 to 15 percent over eight hours, using the heat absorbed from your pants pocket."

The show will include about 75 drawings, beginning with ones he executed in 1948 in Paris. Each is a closely observed likeness from nature, and his inspiration has been everything from seaweed suspended in his studio to a flower he picked up on the side of the road.

Two bucks got you in for a double feature, running nonstop round the clock. The audience was a part of the show. There were bums who found the theater cheaper than a flop, cruisers with their hats on their laps, boys hollering at the screen and the occasional cinephile. You were well advised to exercise great caution in the bathrooms. But the movies were great fun. I miss those days. JULIAN SVEDOSH, Princeton, N.J., posted on nytimes.com"

Unlike existing sleep aids, the drug (which will likely be reviewed by the F.D.A. later this year) works by turning off wakefulness rather than by inducing sleep. ''There's good reason to believe this pill brings on more R.E.M. sleep and better rest,'' says Dr. Emmanuel Mignot of Stanford University. ''It'll be less of a hammer on the brain.''"

At 9, C-Span will broadcast the arrival of the queen, above, at Parliament, where the speakers of the House of Commons and the House of Lords will pay tribute to the occasion, and she will offer comments in return. And at 4:15 a.m. on Tuesday on BBC America, early risers can catch the queen and Prince Philip as they attend a service of thanksgiving at St. Paul's Cathedral, followed by a carriage procession."

Over the next 16 months an estimated 7,500 stores in that county will be required to drop plastic from their checkout counters and offer paper only, for a 10-cent fee. In celebration (and preparation), T went looking for the best totes to take to market. Left, from Hunter, easy-to-clean yellow rubber, ideal for fruits and vegetables ($195, go to hunter-boot.com).

2012-06-03T00:00:00Z,"Traffic jams can form out of the simplest things. One driver gets too close to another and has to brake, as does the driver behind, as does the driver behind him -- pretty soon, the first driver has sent a stop-and-go shock wave down the highway. One driving-simulator study found that nearly half the time one vehicle passed another, the lead vehicle had a faster average speed. All this leads to highway turbulence, which is why many traffic modelers see adaptive cruise control (A.C.C.) -- which automatically maintains a set distance behind a car and the vehicle in front of it -- as the key to congestion relief. Simulations have found that if some 20 percent of vehicles on a highway were equipped with advanced A.C.C., certain jams could be avoided simply through harmonizing speeds and smoothing driver reactions. One study shows that even a highway that is running at peak capacity has only 4.5 percent of its surface area occupied. More sophisticated adaptive cruse control systems could presumably fit more cars on the road. When a quarter of the vehicles on a simulated highway had A.C.C., cumulative travel time dropped by 37.5 percent."

Tiny winged avengers can hunt down invasive beetles, cabbage whites can snoop on destructive raccoons and six-legged nanospies can insert themselves into the air-conditioning systems of even the most impenetrable buildings.

2012-06-03T00:00:00Z,"EVERYBODY knows that ''The Devil Wears Prada'' was better as a movie than as a novel, thanks to the directing (David Frankel), the screenplay (Aline Brosh McKenna) and the marvelous duel of diva and dunce performed by Meryl Streep and Anne Hathaway. So the news that its author, Lauren Weisberger, is writing a sequel didn't exactly produce a Rachel Zoe ''I die!'' moment. It's not that fashion has retracted its claws in the decade since Ms. Weisberger, a former assistant to Anna Wintour, published her first book, but the ground is well scored. And a sequel about an industry that is all about sequels seems almost punishment for our sins."

2012-06-03T00:00:00Z,"You need a lot of water to put out a sizable blaze, and the chemicals used in fire extinguishers can be toxic (halons, the most effective chemical fire suppressant, create holes in the ozone layer). So the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency at the Pentagon has developed a hand-held wand that snuffs out fires, without chemicals. According to the program's manager, Dr. Matt Goodman, an electric field destabilizes the flame's underlying structure rather than blanketing the fire to smother it. Eventually, the technology could be used to create escape routes or extinguish fires without damaging sensitive equipment nearby."
2012-06-03T00:00:00Z,"Soon, coffee isn't going to taste like coffee -- at least not the dark, ashy roasts we drink today. Big producers want uniform taste, and a dark roast makes that easy: it evens out flavors and masks flaws. But now the best beans are increasingly being set aside and shipped in vacuum-sealed packs (instead of burlap bags). Improvements like these have allowed roasters to make coffee that tastes like Seville oranges or toasted almonds or berries, and that sense of experimentation is trickling down to the mass market; Starbucks, for instance, now has a Blonde Roast. As quality continues to improve, coffee will lighten, and dark roasts may just become a relic of the past."

The red numbers descend toward the nadir of January 2009; the blue numbers climb, albeit in fits and starts, reaching positive territory in early 2010 and staying there ever since. The message is clear: Bush brought us to our knees; Obama brought us back."

2012-06-03T00:00:00Z,"In Singapore, it is a common practice for entire families to gather on special occasions for a formal picture, often at a studio, with the resulting image framed and prominently displayed at home. The growing tendency of younger family members to take jobs abroad, however, has left many modern portraits missing a relation or two. So the Singaporean photographer John Clang devised a solution, piggybacking on the video-calling technology that already helps ease the dislocation of separated family members: Skype. Clang, who is based in New York, tried this with his own family first, then used the Internet, embassies and recommendations from friends to track down other Singaporean families with members there and in far-flung places. Those in Singapore stood before their webcam-enabled computers and called their distant relatives on Skype. In these various locations, Clang projected the Skype image onto a wall and then photographed the callers together with their flesh-and-blood kin. No Photoshop was needed, and the entire process is simple enough for people everywhere to take advantage of in migratory times. ''It bridges the gap between the two families that are apart,'' Clang says. One subject was Alexia Wai-Chun Tye, a 50-year-old investment adviser who has lived in Paris since 1999. Her 24-year-old daughter, Stephanie Chi-Weng Tsui, was educated there and in London but moved back to Singapore to take a job as an account-planning executive at Saatchi & Saatchi. Tye can be seen here posing in her Paris apartment with her partner, Pierre de Fouquet, a 57-year-old venture capitalist, while her smiling daughter beams in from Singapore. The picture, Tye says with satisfaction, was ''like a virtual family reunion.''"

To start it up, you can text message the cart's built-in tablet computer. Now it knows who you are and what you need for dinner. The cart uses Microsoft's Kinect motion-sensor technology to track and follow you through the store, pointing you -- in a synthy voice reminiscent of a G.P.S. navigator -- toward products on your list. The system will also warn you if you've added something that violates your dietary restrictions. Still only a prototype, the cart isn't nearly as nimble as its human-powered cousin, but it does have one main advantage. Items you add to the cart can be automatically scanned, and you can finalize your purchase from the device, skipping the checkout line entirely."

2012-06-03T00:00:00Z,"AS the shapers of classical music taste gnaw on the field's future, relevance and identity, New Yorkers are living in a golden age of new music. Groups, festivals and concert series devoted to it saturate the town. This week presents two very different examples. Under Alan Gilbert as music director the tradition-bound NEW YORK PHILHARMONIC has expanded its new-music performances, namely with the Contact! series. The latest program includes two works of modernist giants: ''Two Controversies and a Conversation'' by Elliott Carter and ''... explosante-fixe ...'' by Pierre Boulez. The Carter is receiving its first performance in a new, expanded form. Included is ''NACHLESE Vb: Liederzyklus'' by Michael Jarrell, a 53-year-old Geneva-born composer. David Robertson conducts. 7 p.m. Friday, Metropolitan Museum of Art; 8 p.m. Saturday, Symphony Space, 2537 Broadway, at 95th Street; (212) 570-3949; $20. On the other end of the spectrum is the AMERICAN MODERN ENSEMBLE, one of the myriad small groups of expert freelance musicians playing new music in the city. It presents a program loosely grouped around the theme of travel, with works by John Adams, Robert Paterson, Steve Reich, Billy Strayhorn, Erik Friedlander and D. J. Sparr. 7:30 p.m. Thursday, Merkin Concert Hall, 129 West 67th Street, Manhattan; (212) 501-3330, $10 in advance, $25 day of show."

2012-06-03T00:00:00Z,"The purpose of campaign finance laws and regulation is to promote confidence in government and to encourage people to engage in the political process. This mission is being advanced in a new way by the California Fair Political Practices Commission and the Maryland State Board of Elections, which recently approved first-in-the-nation rules permitting low-dollar text message contributions to political campaigns. Text-message political giving has the potential to transform the political process by democratizing fund-raising. People tend to have a greater sense of personal involvement in the issues in an election if they have made a contribution, even if it's a small one. This connection can lead to increased civic engagement and ultimately a more robust democracy. Increased participation by many small contributors is also one way to counter the effect of big money in politics. Encouraging grass-roots giving is sorely needed in an election season where there is unlimited independent spending through ''super PACs.''"

2012-06-04T00:00:00Z,"IKLE--Doris M. 84, of Bethesda, MD died June 1, 2012 peacefully at her home with her family by her side. Doris was an economist by training and a pioneer in energy efficiency. She died of complications related to ovarian cancer, which she had struggled with since her first diagnosis nineteen years ago. Doris was predeceased by her husband of 52 years, Fred C. Ikle (1924-2011). She is survived by two daughters Judith Ikle of San Francisco, CA and Mimi Ikle-Khalsa of Takoma Park, MD, sons-in-law Aaron Maizlish and Sat Jiwan Ikle-Khalsa, three wonderful grandchildren, Leo and Anna Ikle-Maizlish and Kyah Ikle-Khalsa, a sister Miriam Goodley of Oakland, CA and two nieces. Her ability to persevere through multiple bouts of cancer for nineteen years and to go on and continue to live a productive and happy life as a wife, mother and CEO of her own business has been an inspiration to many. Doris Margret Eisemann was born on May 28, 1928 in Frankfurt, Germany to Richard and Sonja Eisemann. Her parents decided to leave Germany in the spring of 1933 in response to the rising tide of anti-Semitism. The family lived briefly in Switzerland and then in Paris, France before emigrating to the United States in 1937. Doris lived in New York City, Riverdale and Forest Hills and graduated from Forest Hills High School in 1945. She received both Bachelor's and Master's Degrees in Economics from New York University in 1949 and 1953 and completed postgraduate studies in Economics at Columbia University. She held research positions with the National Bureau of Economic Research and the American Banker's Association in New York. She developed the Ikle Index, which measures economic purchase price parity. While employed as an Economist with the Rand Corporation in Santa Monica, Doris met the love of her life, the Swiss-born Fred C. Ikle. With their two daughters, Judith and Mimi, they moved first to Washington in 1973 with Fred's political appointment as the Director of the Arms Control and Disarmament Agency and eventually built their own home inBethesda, MD. In 1977, Doris started her second career as an entrepreneur and renowned expert on residential energy efficiency. She started her company, Conservation Management Corp., now named CMC Energy Services, literally at her kitchen table, to address the need for energy efficiency. Doris was the President and CEO of CMC Energy Services from 1977 to 2010, and stayed on as the Chief Innovation Officer until last month remaining very involved with the day-to-day operations of her business right up to her last days. Early on, she developed the Fuelomizer, a do-it-yourself energy audit slide chart tool. Doris also developed Home Tune-uP a sophisticated software and auditor management tool for residential energy audits. Today, CMC has provided energy audits to over 350,000 residences and 50,000 commercial buildings and employs over 95 people administering energy efficiency programs in Pennsylvania, New Jersey and New York State. In 2010, she received the Lifetime Achievement Award from the Alliance to Save Energy. A Memorial Service will be held on Sunday, June 10, 2012 at 10am, at Temple Emanuel, 10101 Connecticut Ave, Kensington, MD 20895. Donations in honor of Doris may be made to Johns Hopkins University or a charity of your choosing. For JHU, please make your check out to Johns Hopkins University noting Doris' name in the memo.

Are people no longer asking their pros to fix their driver swings because all their problems are fixable by opening or closing the face with a click of a wrench or by moving some weights in the club head? ''The adjustable driver helps people, but if a golfer is committing a gross error - and that still happens plenty - then adjustability won't fix it,'' said Jim Suttie, one of the nation's top-ranked teaching pros. ''But you can close the face, or more important, you can add loft, and that helps people. It will not replace instruction, though.''"

None of which matters if Google cannot get computers that use it out into the world, something that is proving as big a challenge as engineering Chrome. One thing is certain, however: Google is not giving up. It is heading to retail outlets, showcasing the machines as cheap and easy to manage corporate devices, and rethinking how it sells products for education.

The Foresters' Ball, which took place the same weekend as Johnson's alleged sexual assault, is run by students, not by the forestry school.

It was an impressive feat, because the film opened without a 3-D version and the accompanying higher-priced tickets, though it took some technology to squeeze the likes of Bob Hoskins and Ray Winstone into their diminutive roles. For Universal, ''Snow White'' helped to counter the embarrassment of the studio's ''Battleship,'' which ranked fourth at the domestic box office, with just $4.8 million in ticket sales, for a total of $55.1 million since it opened in the United States on May 18. ''Men in Black 3,'' with a full complement of 3-D screens, ranked second, with $29.3 million in domestic ticket sales for Sony Pictures, and a total of $112.3 million since opening on May 25. But the big story was still ''Marvel's The Avengers,'' which added $20.3 million in domestic sales over the weekend, for a total of $552.7 million. According to Walt Disney, which released ''The Avengers,'' the film also had $12.4 million in international sales over the weekend, pushing its global box office to about $1.36 billion. That sent it past ''Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2,'' to become the third-biggest film ever at the global box office behind ''Avatar'' and ''Titanic.''"

The work was shown in Paris and last year at the Matthew Marks Gallery."

Based on economic and market indicators, and a growing sense of public panic, the top officials at the central bank could easily justify a policy move when they hold their regular monthly meeting on Wednesday. The bank could, for example, cut the benchmark interest rate to a record low. Or it could flood commercial banks with more low-interest loans, something which worked to calming effect when it provided such infusions a few months ago."

Scott Walker, whose decision to cut collective bargaining rights for most public workers set off a firestorm in a state usually known for its political civility, easily held on to his job on Tuesday, becoming the first governor in the country to survive a recall election and dealing a painful blow to Democrats and labor unions. Mr. Walker soundly defeated Mayor Tom Barrett of Milwaukee, the Democrats' nominee in the recall attempt, with most precincts across the state reporting results. The victory by Mr. Walker, a Republican who was forced into an election to save his job less than two years into his first term, ensures that Republicans largely retain control of this state's capital, and his fast-rising political profile is likely to soar still higher among conservatives."

2012-06-05T00:00:00Z,"LOS ANGELES - On the eve of the annual E3 video game convention here, Microsoft announced on Monday that it intended to double the amount and scope of media content offered over the next year through the company's Xbox Live online service. While games were the initial focus of Xbox Live, the recent addition of video from partners including Major League Baseball, Netflix and HBO has helped reposition the service and Microsoft's Xbox 360 console as a hub for entertainment beyond video games. Beyond the creation of a new online music service called Xbox Music, Microsoft announced that the National Basketball Association and the National Hockey League had agreed to make their extended programming packages available through Xbox Live. Microsoft also said that ESPN had agreed to stream its flagship network through Xbox Live and that Nickelodeon and Paramount Pictures had also agreed to distribute programming through the service. Microsoft also revealed a new, potentially far-reaching initiative called SmartGlass that is meant to link the Xbox 360 with other popular electronic devices like tablets and cellphones. For example, while playing a game on a living-room television a player might be able to look at his or her tablet to see an in-game map or related inventory. Microsoft said that SmartGlass would support systems including Android devices, iPhones and iPads and smartphones running Windows 8."

(MoreMax) GIRL WITH A PEARL EARRING (2003) This feature directorial debut from Peter Webber, based on the novel by Tracy Chevalier, imagines the life of Griet (Scarlett Johansson), a maid in the Netherlands in the 1660s who becomes the muse for Vermeer (Colin Firth) and is immortalized in one of his most famous paintings. ''Ms. Johansson is photographed so that her skin is as opalescent as her earring, but the movie is opaque,'' Elvis Mitchell wrote in The New York Times. ''It is an earnest, obvious melodrama with no soul, filled with the longing silences that come after a sigh.'' Yet, he added, the film is ''a dexterous and absorbing visual re-creation of the lighting and the look that Vermeer achieved in his work.'' The movie received Oscar nominations for art direction-set decoration, cinematography and costume design."

The deal was announced Friday during a news conference at the organization's 130-seat theater in the historic Sun Building at 280 Broadway, said the executive director, Catherine Peila. The agreement, put together with the help of local elected officials and cultural community representatives, calls for an undisclosed but substantial reduction in the $70,000 monthly rent to Fram Realty, which leases the city-owned building, Ms. Peila said. In addition to the back rent owed, Dance New Amsterdam's payments do not have to begin until 2014, she added."

The revelation raises new questions about MF Global's actions in its last months - in particular, how it responded to regulators. The brokerage firm had previously disclosed that it had met the capital requirements, but never mentioned that it had transferred some bonds rather than raising additional money. The shift was detailed in a report by Louis J. Freeh, the trustee overseeing the bankruptcy of MF Global. The report is separate from the one issued Monday by James W. Giddens, the court-appointed trustee charged with recovering money for MF Global's customers. ''This strategy allowed the MF Global Group to transfer the economic benefits and risks,'' thus reducing the ''regulatory capital requirements,'' the report by Mr. Freeh said."

Or if you're squeamish about the sight of blood and entrails but still have some extra treasure to spare, you could simply buy one for $30,000. HBO announced on Tuesday that it would start selling life-size replicas of the throne from ''Game of Thrones,'' its epic fantasy adapted from George R. R. Martin's ''Song of Ice and Fire'' novels. The replicas are made not from molten steel but from hand-finished, hand-painted fiberglass and fireproof resin, weigh 350 pounds and measure 7 feet, 2 inches tall; 5 feet 11 inches deep; and 5 feet 5 inches wide. HBO, which also offers artifacts and memorabilia inspired by its other original series, said in a news release about the throne that ''calling it impressive is an understatement'' but offered no advice on how to sit in a seat constructed from so many sharp and pointed instruments."

(TMC) SAINT MISBEHAVIN': THE WAVY GRAVY MOVIE (2010) Given his nickname by B. B. King in 1969, Wavy Gravy -- now a 76-year-old hippie idealist born Hugh Nanton Romney -- has been sending out good vibes for more than 50 years while advocating peace, love and laughter in the guise of a clown. (He came to learn that dressing as a clown protected him from police beatings at antiwar protests.) This documentary from Michelle Esrick looks back to his roots as a Greenwich Village poet and traveling monologuist, when he forged connections with Lenny Bruce, Bob Dylan, Ken Kesey and the Grateful Dead. ''The person who emerges is a man who has long transcended rancorous political debate by embodying a holy fool,'' Stephen Holden wrote in The New York Times, noting a moving montage in which Wavy Gravy and his friend Dr. Larry Brilliant traveled to Nepal to help provide sight-restorative cataract surgery. ''As you watch Mr. Romney delight Asian children by playing a kazoo and blowing bubbles, you see exactly the person described by the satirist Paul Krassner as 'the illegitimate son of Harpo Marx and Mother Teresa,' '' Mr. Holden added. ''Make of it what you will: like its subject, 'Saint Misbehavin' ' is an unabashed love letter to the world that defies the cynicism of our age.''"

As an only child, I didn't grow up with much teasing either, and although I can finally let it go when a friend jokes about my ugly feet or coffee budget, I can't say I like it."

This was, to put it mildly, not the easiest season of ''Mad Men'' for Lane Pryce, the seemingly strait-laced and business-savvy partner at Sterling Cooper Draper Pryce, and not just because he didn't receive a Christmas bonus. Lane, played by Jared Harris, right, struggled in his marriage, planted an awkward kiss on Joan Harris and lusted after a mystery woman he knew only from a single photograph and her voice on the telephone. Then, when his personal finances got tight, he embezzled from the company, got caught by Don Draper, was forced to resign and -- last warning for spoilers -- committed suicide in his office."

2012-06-07T00:00:00Z,"FOR a younger generation of hip dads who are dressing up, a stylish tie could be a welcome gift for Father's Day, so long as it's not paisley or four inches wide. Or so goes the thinking behind a new selection of ties at the online retailer Park & Bond, which asked five designers to update that love-it-or-hate-it holiday staple. The ties make their debut on the site on Thursday in a portfolio of images of celebrity dads, part of a promotion that benefits the Boys' Club of New York. There was one caveat for the cravats: they had to be ones Dad would actually wear. So the results are fairly straightforward, like the textured rep stripe by Ovadia & Sons worn here by the actor Matt Bomer ($125), or a subtly striped linen by Pierrepont Hicks that's ideal for a light-colored cotton or seersucker suit ($140). Only one designer, David Hart, went for ironic hipster dad, interpreting the classic hunting motif on a tie embroidered with rifles and deer ($125). In his younger years, Mr. Hart often gave ties to his father, a jazz musician, who had little use for them. My, how times have changed. ''Now that we are making ties,'' Mr. Hart said, ''he's always asking for them.'' ERIC WILSON"

In 1948 he revolutionized the retailing merchandizing industry after returning from the US Armed Forces after WWII, when he started selling discount luggage in Mid-Manhattan under the name of Korvettes. He was considered one of America's top 6 merchandisers of all time.

He and his wife Estelle were honored at the 50th Anniversary of the Ferkauf Graduate School of Psychology in October 2007. A humble giant, Eugene Ferkauf was kind, generous and was a major philanthropist never seeking attention. Despite that, he appeared on the cover of Times magazine in connection with a major article on discount merchandising in 1962.

In this case imitation is the sincerest form of mockery. There is one thing the new show couldn't copy, however. Like it or not, ''The Voice'' actually rewards talent. On ''The Choice'' there's nothing much to reward besides inane chitchat and the wearing of the shortest, tightest skirts imaginable.

Reuters reported that a team from the Museum of London Archaeology had unearthed walls from the gallery and yard of the Curtain Theater, which was home to the Lord Chamberlain's Men and was the primary site for performances of Shakespeare's work between 1597 and 1599. Before moving to the Globe Theater, Shakespeare apparently gave a shout-out (as it was not called in that time) to the Curtain in his prologue to ''Henry V''; that theater is believed by some scholars to be the ''wooden O'' referred to in the lines: ''Or may we cram within this wooden O the very caskes that did affright the air at Agincourt?''"

(MoreMax) HOW TO TRAIN YOUR DRAGON (2010) In this 3-D feature from DreamWorks Animation a teenage Viking named Hiccup (voiced by Jay Baruchel) befriends Toothless, an injured dragon on a windswept island; pleases his demanding father (Gerard Butler); and saves the world in the process. The airborne sequences made the movie particularly compelling when seen with special glasses in a theater. ''When Hiccup first climbs on Toothless's back and urges the dragon to take wing, the hearts of the audience soar with a primitive and durable delight,'' A. O. Scott wrote in The New York Times. ''The techniques that enabled this feeling may be dauntingly complicated, but the feeling could not be simpler.'' At the beginning and the end, '' 'How to Train Your Dragon' is noisy and action-packed in the usual way,'' Mr. Scott added, with ''eye-straining, ear-popping large-scale effects.''

2012-06-07T00:00:00Z,"I have gained tremendous insight reading the comments on this blog. One in particular really struck me recently. It came in response to a post that I had written quite a while ago, ''The Dirty Little Secret of Successful Companies,'' and it illustrates the huge difference in perspective that can exist between the owners of companies and their employees. Here is the comment: There is nothing wrong with being an average (mediocre) employee. Not everyone aspires to be in management. If the person meets the requirements of their current job, and they like the job and want to stay in the job, so be it. Stop trying to force people to get to the next level. The reality is that work is not the most important thing in everyone's lives. People have more important things in their life than work. Work is simply a means to get the money we need to pay the mortgage and our other bills. Work is a low-priority event for most people. I'm only willing to do the bare minimum that it takes to get a paycheck every two weeks. As long as I am meeting the requirements of my job, than that is good enough. Don't expect any more of me because I will not be a slave to any company. -- Jo-Ann Youngblood, Tulsa, OK"

If the label on your adapter says something like ''Input: 100-240VAC,'' with a reference to ''50-60 Hz,'' it should be fine operating in countries with electrical voltage running between 100 volts and 240 volts, and frequencies of 50 to 60 Hertz."

Instead, she became a dissident theologian who spoke for those she considered the neglected spiritual core of the church's membership: Hispanic women like herself. Dr. Isasi-Díaz, who died of cancer in New York on May 13, was widely known in North and South America as the chief theorist behind Mujerista theology -- she published a book of the same name in 1996 -- which extols the role of Hispanic women, especially the poor, in personifying Christian faith in the everyday struggles of life. She was 69."

He was 86. Lipton began his distinguished career at Hearst in 1950 as a law clerk. In 1951, he joined the Office of General Counsel as a lawyer. He was appointed general counsel and became secretary of Hearst Corporation in 1966, a post he held until his retirement in 1990. In 1975, Lipton was appointed to Hearst's Board of Directors. He continued to be a legal consultant to Hearst Corporation, member of the Board of Directors and a trustee of the trust established under the Will of William Randolph Hearst until his death. ""Harvey was both a valued friend and a trusted colleague to all of us who had the pleasure of working with him,"" said Frank A. Bennack, Jr., executive vice chairman and CEO of Hearst Corporation. ""His service as general counsel for 24 years meant he was an important and effective player in Hearst's major changes and events during those years. We were also fortunate to have his good advice and engagement after his retirement in his capacity as a director of the Corporation and a trustee until his death. Our thoughts and prayers are with his family."" Lipton graduated from New York University in 1948 and graduated summa cum laude from St. John's Law School in 1951, and thereafter was awarded a doctorate of law. He was a member of the New York County Lawyers Association. Lipton went to Far Rockaway High School and lived in East Rockaway for the majority of his life. Generous donations to a host of philanthropic organizations were his priority. Lipton is predeceased by his wife, the former Pearl Barsky, and survived by two children, Diane Gail Gollub and Charles Norman Lipton, and five grandchildren, Hayley and Ross Gollub, and Jonah, Samantha and Morgana Lipton.

2012-06-09T00:00:00Z,"10 P.M. (Cinemax) BRIDESMAIDS (2011) A maid of honor (Kristen Wiig, far right, with, from left, Melissa McCarthy, Ellie Kemper, Rose Byrne, Wendi McLendon-Covey and Maya Rudolph) struggles with her financial and romantic woes as she tries to plan the perfect wedding for her best friend (Ms. Rudolph) in this comedy about women in love -- with men, and with one another. Ms. Wiig and Annie Mumolo wrote the script, and Paul Feig directed; Ms. McCarthy, who earned an Oscar nomination; Ms. Byrne; Ms. McLendon-Covey and Ms. Kemper play the bride's friends, who make it through a dress fitting, a bachelorette party and a bridal shower that go very, very wrong. Ms. Wiig and Ms. Mumolo, who also received an Oscar nod for best original screenplay, ''ask the question facing every modern woman who jumps at the chance to enact the latter-day equivalent of being passed from man to man, father to husband, if without a bushel of dowry corn and 12 goats: How do you survive getting down the aisle?'' Manohla Dargis wrote in The New York Times. ''With a little, or rather a lot, of help from your friends, or so say the filmmakers, for better for worse, for richer for poorer, in sickness and in health, to love and to cherish, till misunderstanding, jealousy, other people or just life us do part.'' 8 P.M.

The other chief executive, Nancy Silberkleit, is the trustee of the Silberkleit Trust, which holds 50 percent of Archie Comic Publications; Jon Goldwater owns 25 percent. They do not each control 50 percent of the business. (The other 25 percent is in a trust for Richard Goldwater's three daughters.)

When asked her secret to good health and longevity her motto was ""Everything in Moderation"". Gert and her brother Dave Thypin were long time partners in Thypin Steel Co., founded in 1910 by their father Abraham. She was a modest woman, but received many awards that recognized her as a successful woman in a man's business environment. After retiring at age 87, she became very involved in her community of Rockaway Beach, as an active member of Temple Beth-El and a volunteer and champion fundraiser for Peninsula Hospital. A working woman who put family first, Gert was a role model to many. As the matriarch of a large and close family, she was an inspirational and adored ""Aunt Gertie"". Her legacy lives on in her children Stuart and Judi Oltchick, Arlene and Larry Gilbert, and Ellen and Howard Deixler, her grandchildren Amy, Peter and Amanda, Eric and Assunta, Jay, Avi, and Ben, and her great-grandchildren Marinda, Katherine, Zoe, and Andrew.

My research, a comparison of Americans' Google searches and their voting patterns, found otherwise. If my results are correct, racial animus cost Mr. Obama many more votes than we may have realized. Quantifying the effects of racial prejudice on voting is notoriously problematic. Few people admit bias in surveys.

He first took his drone to northern Afghanistan to photograph archaeological sites that had not been documented before. (The drone was briefly lost till he offered a reward of 5,000 afghanis, or about $115, for it.)

Known for his generosity and steadfastness, for his humor, candor and flair, he will be sorely missed by countless people with whom he interacted with warmth, kindness and verve. He will also be missed by crack rivals at the backgammon table. Mr. Nouri was born in Baghdad in 1918. His education at Jesuit Baghdad College won him an IBM scholarship to Georgetown University in 1938. In 1942, he enlisted in the US Army as an Iraqi national, and served in China and Burma, before becoming an American citizen in 1943. Shortly after, he worked as a staff writer for the Stars and Stripes and the New Yorker, and as a commodities trader at US Steel. Mr. Nouri was a General Agent for New England Mutual Life Insurance Company, with his own agency in New York City. Mr. Nouri leaves behind his wife of 41 years, the former Diana Crocker Redington of San Francisco; two sons, Michael Nouri of Los Angeles and Guy Nouri of Hillsdale, NY; a daughter Katherine Hughes Del Tufo of Princeton, NJ; and two step children: David Redington of Stamford, CT, and Ruth Redington of Cambridge, MA. He is also survived by six grandchildren and four great-grandchildren. A first marriage to the late Gloria Montgomery Nouri ended in divorce. A Memorial Service will be held on June 14th at 2pm at St. Thomas Church, 53rd and 5th Avenue, New York.

2012-06-10T00:00:00Z,"THIS week brings an exhibition that resembles few previously seen in New York in terms of size, scope and subject. ''CARIBBEAN: CROSSROADS OF THE WORLD'' will be spread among three museums: El Museo del Barrio (opening on Tuesday), which initiated its organization; the Studio Museum in Harlem (Thursday); and the Queens Museum of Art (next Sunday). It will present more than 400 works by some 350 artists, and will survey the cultural contribution of the Caribbean and its diaspora, from the Haitian Revolution of 1804 to the present in six thematic sections (two each museum) that weave together art and history. The artists include scores who were born and remained in the region, and others who relocated; European and Americans who emigrated there; others who visited; and still others for whom the Caribbean was an ancestral home or simply a place of the imagination. A mere sampling -- Camille Pissarro, William Blake, Winslow Homer, Hector Hyppolite, Wifredo Lam, Armando Reverón, Clementine Hunter, Felix Gonzalez-Torres and Jean-Michel Basquiat -- promises an ambitious effort that, regardless of any flaws, should astound.

2012-06-10T00:00:00Z,"IN ''First Point,'' his new short film, the artist Richard Phillips combines two of his current obsessions: surfing and Lindsay Lohan. But don't call Ms. Lohan, left, his muse. The actress, Mr. Phillips said, is as much his collaborator as anyone else in the cast and crew, including the surf filmmaker Taylor Steele; the professional surfer Kassia Meador, who performs mesmerizingly as Ms. Lohan's body double; the film editor Jay Rabinowitz; and Thomas Bangalter, half of the electro duo Daft Punk, who composed the ominously swelling score. ''First Point'' is at once a surf film and a film noir, an exploration of the California dream and the Hollywood nightmare. But no doubt the question on everyone's lips when ''First Point'' has its premiere this week at Art Unlimited, the curated section of the Art Basel fair, will be: ''Is it art?'' Fine by Mr. Phillips, who will also feature the piece in a solo show at Gagosian Gallery in September. ''It's just like in my paintings,'' he said. ''Because of the actor and the popular culture dimensions of the project, it will give people -- especially people in the art world -- a real sense of instability with regard to my intentions. Is it a film? Is it an art video? It refuses to announce itself as either.'' ALIX BROWNE"

2012-06-10T00:00:00Z,"''Light is my medium to be investigated,'' says the Japanese artist Hiroshi Sugimoto, who spent years chasing bands of prismatic color around his studio in Tokyo and capturing them, with what was for him rapid-fire succession, using a Polaroid camera. In collaboration with Hermès, 20 of the artist's abstract color studies have been translated into silk scarves in a signed, limited edition of 7 each. Couleurs de L'Ombre or Colors of Shadow, as the collection is called, is a moving tribute to the Polaroid, which faces imminent extinction. (Mr. Sugimoto, in fact, exhausted his last batch of the film to make the images.) Hermès, on the other hand, developed new inkjet technology to faithfully recreate the subtle gradations of intense color. Where the original Polaroids are small and precious, the scarves are large (just over 55 inches square) and dynamic, playing with light in ways the artist had never anticipated, though at around $10,000, you might think twice about actually wearing one. ''It's serious art for me,'' Mr. Sugimoto says, with a nod to Hermès. ''And if it's serious art, for me, it's also very reasonably priced.'' Available at hermes-editeur.com. ALIX BROWNE"

Rue de Bagnolet, the area's main hub of activity, was lined with shuttered shops until around 1999, when the first wave of development brought a contemporary bookshop, Le Merle Moqueur, and a club, La Flèche d'Or, now renowned.

On January 18, 2012, age 77, Dr. Edward Roben Janowitz died suddenly from cardiovascular complications at Dutchess County Hospital in Red Hook, New York. Ed was born to Rose and Benjamin Janowitz and grew up in suburban Paterson, NJ in a family of secular Jewish humanists. He graduated from Rutgers University in 1956 and went on to graduate from Chicago's Pritzker School of Medicine in 1960. Immediately thereafter he volunteered to join charity CARE and spent two years in Kuala Lipis, Malaysia manning a two-hundred bed hospital with another physician. Returning from Malaysia, he spent two years as a major in the US Army Medical Corp in Korea. The Surgeon General of Korea bestowed a special commendation to Edward for service to the poor, above and beyond the call of duty. The governor of Kangwon province Korea sent a letter of appreciation on behalf of the Korean people for Dr. Janowitz' personal efforts in promoting health and welfare. Upon his return from Korea, he completed graduate medical training in New York at the Montefiore Hospital and New York Medical Center. In 1970 he married Hong Cha Kim and established a medical practice on Grand Street on the Lower East Side of Manhattan. He was closely associated with Beth Israel Medical Center in New York, where he served as an attending physician and mentored many other physicians. He made house calls and saw patients in his office, often accepting haircuts, home-cooked food, and other bartered goods and services in lieu of payment. Often he sent patients on their way with a prescription and the $5 or $10 that they lacked to purchase the medication. He was a very caring Jewish family physician, making house calls in the teeming tenements of the lower East side of New York. Dr Edward Janowitz sought social justice, practiced kindness and served his patients and loved ones with humility. He is survived by his beloved wife, Hong Cha Janowitz, his proud son and daughter, Paul and Maia, his loving grandkids, Aidan and Blake, his loving siblings, Linda and Joel, and his daughter in-law Lin Dao.

On NYTimes.com, readers debated the role of private wealth in a public education system. A selection of comments is below. Readers also responded to Ginia Bellafante's Big City column, which examined the word ''gay'' and its changing currency as an insult in light of a court ruling that a false accusation of homosexuality could no longer be considered slander. In a large public-school system where the city gives the same dollar amount for each child, this is how the class system stays maintained. The haves have more. The have-nots don't. How different is it from the suburbs where local taxes support local districts, where wealthy towns have well-provided successful schools and poor towns have poor, failing, underfunded schools?"
2012-06-10T00:00:00Z,"The Pittsburgh Pirates drafted aggressively again last week, grabbing the Stanford right-hander Mark Appel, a Scott Boras client, when he fell to them with the No. 8 pick.

The new spending limits, as mandated by the collective bargaining agreement, will almost certainly blunt the Pirates' recent strategy of spending heavily on multiple selections in each draft."

2012-06-10T00:00:00Z,"There is not a shadow of a doubt that the spotlight on dressing today is totally on men's wear. It has nothing to do with the general public, but it will in 10 years. What we are dealing with are the frontiers of a liberated generation that has in many parts of the country accepted gay marriage and the freedom of expression long associated with women's design. Many of these men have the highest antennas and they are transmitting thoughts about dress that are almost inconceivable, including the breaking of the last taboo: wearing clothes that Western civilization would consider women's. Don't jump to conclusions: this is not about drag. This is embracing the influences of ancient civilizations of Africa and Asian, where the caftan and sarong have long been worn by men. Granted these styles, far left, are most often seen here on men in creative fields, where they can get away with them without ridicule. Certainly Marc Jacobs's long lace shirt has caused an explosion equal to his first grunge collection 20 years ago. Less extreme but equally uncorralled are the clothes of Thom Browne, above left, he of the above-the-ankle trousers. And black contemporary music is a major influence. On a more traditional note: the man at top right, in the most punctiliously tailored and accessorized suits. Below left, a man artfully mixes color, classic shapes and bold accessories. For others, bottom right, it's the rustic look of Paul Bunyan."
2012-06-10T00:00:00Z,"IF LARRY KEIGWIN were a writer, it's easy to imagine him as a poet like Walt Whitman or Frank O'Hara, someone fond of wandering city streets, peering into windows, studying the gaits of passers-by, endlessly curious about the quirks of human behavior. Whitman and O'Hara might be inspired to write poems about city rambling. But Mr. Keigwin creates dances about urban life for his Keigwin + Company that fuse pop culture and high art. He'll be presenting four at the Joyce Theater, two of them world premieres. ''Twelve Chairs,'' which explores states of rejection and survival, is based on a simple but potent structural idea: the game of musical chairs. Competition is also a theme of the other premiere, ''Contact Sport,'' a male quartet that uses athletic movements to suggest the ever-changing relationships among four brothers. The program includes a revised version of the playful ''Trio,'' which received its premiere last fall, and a revival of ''Megalopolis'' (2009), a big work blending futuristic visions with nightclub camp, a mash-up of minimalism and hip-hop. 7:30 p.m. Tuesday and Wednesday, 8 p.m. Thursday to Saturday, 2 p.m. and 7:30 p.m. next Sunday, 175 Eighth Avenue, at 19th Street, Chelsea; (212) 242-0800, joyce.org; from $10."

2012-06-11T00:00:00Z,"7 P.M. (Nickelodeon) FIGURE IT OUT The network updates its popular late '90s game show for the 21st century. Each week Jeff Sutphen, above, challenges four celebrity panelists -- among them, Victoria Justice, Jennette McCurdy, Cymphonique Miller and Rachel Crow -- to uncover the hidden talents or accomplishments of child contestants by bombarding them with questions. For each round in which the panelists fail to come up with the correct answer the contestant wins a prize. If, after three rounds, the panelists still can't figure it out, the player takes home the grand prize. Each game ends with a demonstration of the contestant's abilities. At 9, in a preview of ''Hollywood Heights,'' an adaptation of the Mexican telenovela ''Alcanzar una Estrella,'' Brittany Underwood plays Loren Tate, a shy high school senior who finds herself catapulted to superstardom when she wins a songwriting contest sponsored by her rock idol, Eddie Duran (Cody Longo) -- and, eventually, his love. The show, which also features a multiple-episode guest appearance by James Franco, has its official premiere next Monday. 7:30 A.M. (Fox Movie Channel) SONS AND LOVERS (1960) Jack Cardiff directed this adaptation of the D. H. Lawrence novel about the joy, sorrow and frustration that grow out of a strong bond between a mother (Wendy Hiller) and son (Dean Stockwell) in a northern England coal town, not unlike the one where Lawrence grew up. ''Oddly enough, the powerful passions that race and foam through the original tale, which shocked and dismayed a lot of people when it was published in 1913, do not surge up in the picture,'' Bosley Crowther wrote in The New York Times. ''The strong possessiveness of a mother's love for a son, transferred to him from his father, comes through as a hot, but essentially lavalike, strain of attentiveness and jealous affection untouched by the thrust of Dr. Freud.'' The film received seven Oscar nominations, including best director for Mr. Cardiff and best actor for Trevor Howard as the discarded father, a miner who wed above his social class. Freddie Francis won for best cinematography, which Mr. Crowther called ''picture poetry.''"

The company didn't have a big domestic market or access to a large pool of world-class developers.

2012-06-12T00:00:00Z,"The Broadway musicals ''Once,'' ''Newsies,'' and ''The Gershwins' Porgy and Bess'' all had stronger ticket sales than usual on Monday after their respective wins and televised performance numbers at the Tony Awards on Sunday night, according to publicists for the productions or theater executives familiar with the sales. ''Once,'' which won the best musical Tony and seven others, was on track to sell five times its usual number of tickets on Monday, by far its best day since performances began in February. ''Newsies,'' which won for best score and choreography, was selling almost twice as many tickets as usual. And ''Porgy and Bess,'' which won for best musical revival and best actress in a musical (Audra McDonald), had ''one of its best days since opening'' in January, Jeffrey Richards, a producer of the show, said. Other shows were hoping to rebound from shutouts at the Tonys. The revival of ''Godspell'' didn't have any Tony nominations but did get to stage a number on the CBS telecast, and the producer Ken Davenport said on Monday that he hoped that visibility would yield more ticket sales. ''Godspell'' has been struggling; last week the show grossed its lowest amount, $156,437, since performances began in October. Mr. Davenport, who had said he would close the musical on June 24 if ticket sales did not pick up, said on Monday that he would make a decision on a closing notice soon. Another play, Nicky Silver's comedy ''The Lyons,'' lost its one shot at a Tony on Sunday: best actress in a play for Linda Lavin. ''The Lyons'' has been among the lowest-grossing plays this spring, but a spokesman said on Monday that there were no plans to close it."

Sunscreen itself is not usually flammable.

2012-06-12T00:00:00Z,"McNAMARA--Francis J. Jr.,A prominent Connecticut trial attorney and philanthropist, passed away June 8th in Vero Beach, FL at the age of 84. During his illustrious 35-year career in litigation, he rose to managing partner of the law firm Cummings and Lockwood, Stamford, CT, and argued cases in courts from the Connecticut Supreme Court to the United States Supreme Court as well as in federal courts in many states. During the same time period, he also led the Charles E. Culpeper Foundation in New York City as it disbursed over one hundred million dollars in charitable funds to worthy health, educational and cultural institutions. Mr. McNamara was a voracious reader of history; as well as a passionate student of Irish genealogy, loved writing and had just recently completed a comprehensive memoir of the McNamara family. Mr. McNamara is survived by his loving wife of 26 years, Lois Magner; as well as his six children, three stepchildren and 20 grandchildren. Francis J. McNamara, Jr. was born in Boston, MA on November 30, 1927. He spent his early years in Washington, DC and graduated from Gonzaga High School in 1945. He served in the Navy as a seaman in 1946. He attended Georgetown University, receiving a Bachelor of Arts degree in 1949 and completing his college education in three years. Mr. McNamara considered pursuing a career in radio broadcasting, but at the urging of his father entered law school and subsequently received a Bachelor of Laws degree from Georgetown in 1951. Recalled to active duty as a Navy Lieutenant in early 1952, he served as a Communications Officer on a destroyer and later as Assistant Personnel Officer at the US Naval Station, Newport, RI, until late 1953. Mr. McNamara served as Assistant United States Attorney for the District of Connecticut from January, 1954 until December, 1956. In 1957 he joined the law firm of Cummings and Lockwood and became a partner of that firm in 1960. Mr. McNamara handled many important cases on behalf of Cummings and Lockwood in the Connecticut Supreme Court and Superior Court, the United States District Court for the District of Connecticut and the United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit as well as a case before the U.S. Supreme Court. Prior to his retirement from Cummings and Lockwood in 1991 he was a managing partner in charge of the firm's litigation department and was a member of the Finance and Executive Committees of the firm. Mr. McNamara was a member of the bar of the United States District Courts for the District of Connecticut, the Southern and Eastern Districts of Virginia, the United States Court of Appeals for the Second and Fourth Circuits, the Supreme Court of the United States, the Tax Court of the United States and the United States Court of Military Appeals. He was a Fellow and former State Chairman of the American College of Trial Lawyers. A fellow of the American Bar Foundation and also past president of the Stamford Bar Association, Mr. McNamara lectured on legal matters in this country and in Europe. Mr. McNamara was elected Chairman of the Board of Trustees of the Charles E. Culpeper Foundation in 1968 and remained in this position while maintaining an active law practice with Cummings and Lockwood until 1991 when he became President and Chief Executive Officer of the Foundation. He retired on July 1, 1999 and the Foundation was then merged with the Rockefeller Brothers Fund of New York City. During over three decades in active charge of the philanthropy of the Charles E. Culpeper Foundation Mr. McNamara had a major role in the disbursement of over $120,000,000 in charitable funds to undergraduate institutions of higher learning as well as hospitals, medical centers and medical schools, arts and culture activities and legal programs. A devout Catholic who attended daily Mass for many years, Mr. McNamara was a Knight of Malta and a Knight of the Holy Sepulchre in the Roman Catholic Church. In 1983 he was designated a Knight of St. Gregory the Great by Pope John Paul II. He received the Outstanding Philanthropic Service Award from the Fairfield Foundation of the Diocese of Bridgeport in 1984. Mr. McNamara was a Trustee of Fairfield University from 1969 to 1981 and was elected Trustee Emeritus. In May of 1983, an Honorary Doctor of Laws was conferred on Mr. McNamara by that University. A fan of horse racing since his early days in Washington, DC, Mr. McNamara bred and raced thoroughbred horses for many years. He was also a skier who enjoyed weekends with his children on the ski slopes in Vermont. In his later years, golf became a passion and he was a member of the Wee Burn Country Club in Darien, CT, and the Orchid Island Golf and Beach Club in Vero Beach, FL. Mr. McNamara's first wife, Noreen, died in 1984. He married Lois L. Magner of Norwalk, CT in 1986. In addition to his wife, Mr. McNamara leaves his six children: Francis J. III (and Lisa M.

That is, until Léda (Antonella Lualdi), the mistress of the vintner Henri Marcoux (Jacques Dacqmine), is murdered -- placing him, his high-strung wife (Madeleine Robinson), their unstable son (André Jocelyn) and their heartsick daughter (Jeanne Valérie), who is in love with an unsavory sort (Jean-Paul Belmondo), under suspicion.

And the 1960s. -But by the time Bernadette Castro's father bought this Long Island mansion in the 1960s and brought in 15 Castro Convertibles, somebody had taken the animal head with the antlers away.

That is the message of the newest and perhaps most compelling of the studies, which was presented on Saturday at the annual meeting of the American College of Sports Medicine in San Francisco. For it, researchers at the University of South Carolina Arnold School of Public Health and other institutions combed through the health records of 52,656 American adults who'd undergone physicals between 1971 and 2002 as part of the Aerobics Center Longitudinal Study at the Cooper Institute in Dallas.

He developed a proprietary investment methodology called the Systematic Valuation Discipline (SVD) that PCM continues to employ today. Using the SVD, David amassed one of the best track records in the investment business. David generously supported numerous charitable organizations. He held positions of leadership in many of these organizations, including the Jewish National Fund (JNF), Independent Group Home Living (IGHL), the YIVO Institute in New York City, The Florida Holocaust Museum in Tampa, Florida, Israel Bonds and the Jewish Federation.

A new space has yet to be found, and to remain in Manhattan, the nonprofit's rent -- now about $68,000 a year -- is likely to rise significantly, putting pressure on the group's $480,000 a year budget, Ms. Steinglass said."

That fall Mr. Harrelson headed for New York to try to break into theater, only to hit dead ends. As with many struggling actors, his thoughts turned to writing his own scripts, and he found himself thinking back to that summer in Houston - though it would take more than 25 years, and a collaboration with Mr. Hyman, to finish the play he had in mind. -Their dark comedy, ''Bullet for Adolf,'' which had its world premiere in Toronto last year, will begin performances Off Broadway at New World Stages on July 19 and run through Sept. 9. Mr. Harrelson, who went on to win an Emmy Award on ''Cheers'' and receive two Academy Award nominations, for ''The People vs. Larry Flynt'' (1996) and ''The Messenger'' (2009), will also direct the production."

2012-06-14T00:00:00Z,"FOR Humberto Leon and Carol Lim, the retail whizzes behind Opening Ceremony, this looks to be a gold-medal summer. They will mark the 10th anniversary of their store with a pop-up in London to coincide with the opening ceremony of the Olympic Games. And, in celebration of the Games, they will unveil a large-scale collaboration with Adidas Originals. The collection draws on classic Adidas swimming and cycling styles, now reimagined with '90s street-wear touches -- not designed for sport, but altogether functional nonetheless. ''Growing up not necessarily an athlete, I embrace the idea of sports-inspired clothing that you don't necessarily have to do sports in,'' Mr. Leon said, demonstrating, of course, that shopping is the sincerest form of flattery. Bandanna-print anoraks and swimsuits, sambas and sneakers in a mini-floral print (the sneakers are exceptional) and reflective bombers are a few highlights. The real triumph comes in wearing the sexy, sporty pieces on summer streets. Adidas Originals x Opening Ceremony, $75 to $630 for apparel and $140 to $275 for footwear, available later this month at Opening Ceremony (openingceremony.us) and Adidas Originals (adidas.com)."

She added: ''Nobody does a better job of backing characters into happiness than Mr. Brooks, especially when those characters are high-strung enough to leave happiness practically out of the question. Though this is a looser and less even comedy, it shows off Mr. Brooks's gift for the right-on zinger.''"

Born in Brooklyn on April 18, 1919, to Jake and Minnie Silverman, Saul graduated from Lincoln High School at age 15, then from New York University School of Commerce at age 19. He received his JD degree from New York University Law School in 1941. His illustrious legal and accounting career began with his association with Mike Edelstein, which became Wright Long & Company and later merged with Clarence Rainess, where Saul was the managing partner. At the same time, he developed his legal practice as a tax specialist with his life-long cherished colleague Martin Weinraub, as Silverman & Weinraub. His long and distinguished career was not only based upon his tax law expertise, but also the universal trust in him held by all who sought his services. Never self-serving, he always put the interests of his clients first and was guided by the highest ethical standards. Saul was a respected community leader: honored and active in several Jewish charities, president of the Lake Success Civic Association, Lake Success Municipal Court Judge, president and long-time board member of Beach Point Condominium Association and High Ridge Country Club in Palm Beach, Florida. But the greatest achievement of his life was his long and endlessly happy marriage to Estelle, beautiful wife of 68 years, whom he married on Christmas day, 1943, while serving his country in the Air Force during World War II. Saul will be forever missed by his three loving daughters, Jill Cossman, Linda Sobo and Sheri Labovitz, their spouses David Cossman, Simon Sobo and Steve Labovitz, his grandchildren Joshua Cossman and wife Christy, Jim Cossman and wife Denise, Joanna Cossman, Daniel Sobo and wife Lisa, Michael Sobo and wife Mary Ellen, Andrew Labovitz and wife Allison and Laura Labovitz, and great grandchildren Lucas and Katie.

2012-06-15T00:00:00Z,"BARNETT--Lawrence R. Executive, philanthropist and, foremost, beloved family patriarch, Lawrence Barnett passed away on June 11, 2012. Surrounded by family, Barnett died much as he had lived, with dignity and grace and with the adoration of all those he touched in his 98 years. From 1936 to 2000, Barnett was an executive and served on the boards of such organizations as Music Corporation of America (MCA) (1936 1963), General Artist Corporation (1963 1966), Piper Aircraft Corporation (1969 1977), Warner Communications Inc. (1984 1988), United Television, Inc. (1981 2000) and Chris-Craft Industries, Inc. (1967 2000). MCA founder Jules Stein hired and sent Barnett to MCA's West Coast offices where he handled the careers of many entertainers, including big band leaders Benny Goodman, Tommy Dorsey and Harry James; singers Tony Bennett, Lena Horne and Dinah Shore; and celebrities Jack Benny, George Burns, Dean Martin and Jerry Lewis and Marlon Brando. Barnett heard about a young American actress named Isabel Bigley, who was a big hit in the London production of ""Oklahoma,"" and was featured on the cover of Time Magazine. Barnett met with her, convinced her to sign with MCA, and two years later he asked her to marry him. During her career, Bigley too was widely respected for her work in TV and the theatre. She won a ""Tony Award"" for her role as Sarah Brown in the original Broadway production of ""Guys and Dolls."" Lawrence Barnett's credo in life was to help people so that one day he could look back and say that he lived his life unselfishly and gave something back to society for all the good fortune that was bestowed upon him. Over the years, he shared his passion, dedication, generosity of spirit, leadership and philanthropy with many worthy causes, such as Hillside Hospital, the Adoption Society of Westchester, the Annenberg Center for Health Services and the Eisenhower Medical Center. Lawrence and Isabel Barnett established The Ohio State University Arts Administration Program and the ""Public Policy and the Arts Symposium."" In 1996, Lawrence Barnett was awarded an honorary doctorate of fine arts and received the 2004 Gerlach Outstanding Development Volunteer Award. In 2011, the Barnetts donated the funds to establish the multi-disciplinary ""Lawrence and Isabel Barnett Center for Integrated Arts and Enterprise"" at Ohio State and to support extensive building renovations for the College of Arts and Sciences. Barnett considered one of his greatest philanthropic accomplishments to be his work with The ALS Association to help find a cure and treatments for Lou Gehrig's Disease. ALS (amyotrophic lateral sclerosis) is a devastating neuromuscular disease that robs its victims of the ability to walk, speak and, eventually, to breathe. Barnett served as the founding chair of The ALS Association; gave generously of his time, intellect and support; and became affectionately known as the ""Grandfather"" of the organization, a distinction of which he was especially proud. He and his wife helped fund research that eventually isolated the first gene associated with ALS and sponsored the inaugural Lawrence and Isabel Barnett Post-Doctoral Fellowship Award for ALS research. Barnett once shared, ""I have always felt like I needed to help humanity as much as I can. And we are fortunate enough to be able to give back to the community and make a difference. Even as a child, I wanted to help others."" Lawrence and Isabel Barnett shared 53 years of marriage, until her death in 2006, and leaves a large and loving family of six children: Robert, William, Claudia, Lawrence Jr., James, and Laurey; 16 grandchildren and five great-grandchildren. For more information, visit www.alsa.org/news/lawrence-r-barnett-leaves-a.html.

2012-06-15T00:00:00Z,"It hardly needs to be said that any armed force has the potential for internal as well as external violence. But ''The Invisible War,'' Kirby Dick's incendiary documentary about the epidemic of rape within the United States military, is a shocking and infuriating indictment of widespread sexual attacks on women. Such behavior, the film argues, is tacitly condoned and routinely covered up; the victims are often blamed and their reputations destroyed. This unsettling exposé, which won the audience award at the 2012 Sundance Film Festival, may be the most outraged film in the annual Human Rights Watch Film Festival, which opened on Thursday and continues at the Walter Reade Theater in Lincoln Center through June 28. It is likely to fuel a growing perception of the military as a broken institution, stretched beyond its limits and steeped in a belligerent, hypermasculine mystique that has gone unchecked."

Ryan Gosling (above, with Emma Stone) is Jacob, the pickup artist who helps Cal overcome his bad haircut and terrible fashion sense and tutors him in the art of seduction so he can even the score with his spouse. And Ms. Stone is the recent law school graduate (with a useless boyfriend played by Josh Groban) who catches -- and holds -- Jacob's wandering eye. ''It is possible to wish that 'Crazy, Stupid, Love' were sharper and also to admire its decency and its unshowy skill,'' A. O. Scott wrote in The New York Times. Instead, he added, this romantic comedy, directed by Glenn Ficarra and John Requa, ''opts for mildness, modesty and chastened optimism. At the same time, though, it seems to know that a crueler, more cynical rendering of its story -- a 'Bitter, Hopeless, Love' -- lurks between the lines. What makes it worth watching, and worth liking, is the sense that it arrives at its warm and comforting view of things not by default but by choice.'' 10:30 A.M.

The young girls among the dancers -- who came from as far away as China, South Africa, Australia and Canada -- applied spray-tanner and wore purple eyeshadow and pink lipstick and sparkly dresses and wigs with long ringlets. As the story goes among dancers, the curly wigs derive from the tradition of Irish girls dressing up for Sunday Mass.

Now Lincoln Center Theater opens its own new space, perched atop the Vivian Beaumont. The first tenant of the 112-seat Claire Tow Theater, which becomes the permanent home to the company's LCT3 program, devoted to nurturing new theater talent, is ''SLOWGIRL,'' a play by Greg Pierce about a teenage girl who descends upon her uncle in his Costa Rican retreat after a traumatic accident. (Theater trivia note: Mr. Pierce's uncle is the actor David Hyde Pierce.) In outline Mr. Pierce's drama sounds not unlike the company's current ''4000 Miles,'' Amy Herzog's play about a grandmother coaxing her grandson back to engagement with the world. The biggest success to emerge from the LCT3 program, Ms. Herzog's play moved to the larger Mitzi Newhouse this spring. Anne Kauffman, a gifted shepherd of new writing who directed Ms. Herzog's ''Belleville,'' coming to New York Theater Workshop this fall, is staging ''Slowgirl,'' which stars Zeljko Ivanek and Sarah Steele.

He was 82 and is survived by his brother John E. Grimm III of Southampton, NY; a sister Nan Freeman of Norwalk, CT, and his loving wife Gloria M. Grimm. He is also survived by four children from a previous marriage, Carl H. Grimm of Rehoboth Beach, DE, N. Ellen Eifert of Woodstock, GA., Dr. Laurie Steelsmith of Honolulu, HI, and Susan K. Wilmot of New South Wales, Australia; and five grandchildren. Peter graduated from Deerfield Academy in 1947 and received a Bachelor of Arts degree from Hamilton Collage in 1951 when he captained the varsity tennis team to an undefeated season. In 1952 he graduated from the Newport, RI U.S. Naval Officer Candidate School and from 1953 to 1955 served in the U.S. Navy as a gunnery officer on a destroyer escort during and following the Korean War. From 1955 to 1983, Peter pursued a packaged goods and marketing career with such firms as General Foods, Sterling Drugs, Revlon, and American Home Products. In 1965, Peter co-invented and marketed Count-Down, a dial cigarette holder that reduced the health hazard of cigarette smoking. In 1968 he designed and invented the child protection safety cap that remains in widespread use today. In 1984, Peter became a fundraising consultant to nonprofit organizations such as Citizens Committee for New York City, City Harvest, Holy Trinity Orthodox Church and Montpelier, the General Henry Knox Museum.

2012-06-17T00:00:00Z,"11 P.M. (13) FLORENT: QUEEN OF THE MEAT MARKET (2011) David Sigal traces the trajectory of Restaurant Florent, a 24-hour diner-cum-bistro on Gansevoort Street in Manhattan's meatpacking district, from 1985, when it was the lone eatery in a shadowy industrial area, to 2008 when, after a successful run, it became a relic of a bohemian utopia in a quickly changing neighborhood. The film also chronicles the life of the restaurant's owner, Florent Morellet, above, a French expatriate, artist-cartographer and political activist who, after learning in 1987 that he was H.I.V. positive, disregarded the advice of friends and revealed his status, even keeping a running tabulation of his T-cell count on the restaurant's menu board. Writing in The New York Times, Stephen Holden called this film, which features appearances by Julianne Moore, Diane von Furstenberg, Isaac Mizrahi and Michael Musto, ''a touching, elegiac tale of the rise (and some would say fall) of a colorful New York neighborhood under the relentless march of gentrification.'' 9 A.M.

2012-06-17T00:00:00Z,"Several players early in Saturday's third round remarked how much slower the greens at the Olympic Club were compared to the first two rounds. Customarily, the greens at the United States Open get quicker as they dry out. But shots to the greens that in other days were running several yards after they landed were instead stopping after only a short release. This seemed to confuse the players, not just because it was different than in other days but because it was the opposite of what was happening on the fairways where shots were bounding and running out in what seemed like dry conditions."
2012-06-17T00:00:00Z,"THE celebrated photographer Bruce Weber has always used his home bases -- in Montana, the Adirondacks, Montauk and Miami -- as settings for his distinctly American fashion shoots. On Saturday, the Bellport-Brookhaven Historical Society on Long Island unveiled ''A Bellport Tale,'' an exhibition of photos that Mr. Weber took when he lived in Bellport in the 1970s and '80s. ''Everyone knew each other,'' he said of the bay-side village. ''You could knock on any door and just invite a neighbor over to be part of a photography sitting. It was as easy as borrowing a cup of sugar.'' The images in the exhibition come from a shoot that appeared in British Vogue in 1982 called ''Under Weston Eyes.'' Starring Talisa Soto and the male model of the moment, Bruce Hulse, that story was styled by Grace Coddington and inspired by the work of another photographer, Edward Weston. ''He took things that were very personal to him and let us see into that world,'' Mr. Weber said. ''I thought it would be interesting to do a series of pictures of my own imaginary family, living together in the dysfunctional, neurotic, beautiful way that families do.'' The exhibition (on view through Sept. 3) includes many memorable images, but perhaps none is more evocative of a quiet life on the bay than that of a shirtless Mr. Hulse, sitting on the stern of a boat, cigarette in hand, wearing calf-revealing baggy trousers, rumpled socks and dress shoes.

2012-06-17T00:00:00Z,"''A numerous and enthusiastic audience assembled in Chickering Hall last evening to listen to readings from the writings of Mr. Samuel L. Clemens -- who prefers to be known as 'Mark Twain' -- and Mr. George W. Cable. . . . The management, in its newspaper advertisements, spoke of the entertainment as a 'combination of genius and versatility,' but neglected to say which of the gentlemen had the genius and which the versatility. Some of those who were present last evening may have felt justified in coming to the conclusion that Mr. Cable represented both these elements. . . . Mr. Cable was humorous, pathetic, weird, grotesque, tender and melodramatic by turns, while Mr. Clemens confined his efforts to the ridicule of such ridiculous matters as aged colored gentlemen, the German language and himself. . . . ''The first selection was from [Cable's] 'Dr. Sevier,' the interesting scene in which Narcisse thinks he can 'baw that fifty dolla' himself. Then Mr. Clemens recited a selection from 'The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn,' which will be continued in Mr. Clemens's next book. . . . Mr. Cable's last selection from 'Dr. Sevier' was 'Mary's Night Ride,' in which weirdness, tenderness and melodramatic force were joined with a rare skill that evoked hearty and continued applause."

2012-06-17T00:00:00Z,"LIBERATORE--Marianne Westpalm van Hoorn, died peacefully in her Weston, CT home on June 1, 2012. She will be sorely missed by many and her work in the cause of humanity through the promotion of the arts and music will be long remembered. She leaves behind two sons, Joseph of Northampton, MA and Willem of Ripton, VT and their families: Joe's wife Kira, daughter Aislyn and son Rainier and Willem's wife, Jean Cherouny and their daughters Anneke and Abigail as well as cousins Nico, Magteld, Reinier and Cordula of Holland and cousin Carolyn Lester of Andover, CT and several stepchildren: George, Virginia, Nick, Elliott, and Mark. She was predeceased by her husband of thirty-eight years, Nicholas Liberatore. Marianne was born in Wilmington, DE on September 30, 1928 to Helen Renner of Sandusky OH, a teacher, and Albert Willem Westpalm van Hoorn of Java, Indonesia, a naval architect. She graduated from Wilmington High School at 16 and Oberlin College at age 20 with a double major in History and Art History and was elected to Phi Beta Kappa. Marianne worked in New York City as a buyer for Macy's and later as a Lecturer in Retailing at Tobe-Coburn School. She married Joseph Jewett on February 16 1957. After living briefly in Larchmont, NY they settled in Westport, CT in 1965. In Westport Marianne promoted arts and musical events in local schools as a member of the Westport PTA. She produced a show of ""Westport Artists of the Past"" to commemorate the American Bicentennial at the Westport Public Library. After Joe's death in 1972, Marianne worked for Famous Schools, Sandak Inc. and Garden Way Associates. She married Nicholas Liberatore in 1973 and while living with him in San Francisco, worked at Macy's as Manager of the Direct Mail Division and started her own business there, Shop Work Inc. Nicholas and Marianne lived briefly in Orr's Island, ME in a house she designed but were drawn back to the cultural activity of Westport and its proximity to New York City. Returning to Weston, she became programming director and then President of the South Shore Music Club, leading a resurgence in the popularity and quality of its concerts and making it a major stop for up-and-coming as well as established artists. In the mid-90s, moved by the plight of musicians in besieged Sarajevo, she threw her energy into rebuilding the Sarajevo Philharmonic. Charitable contributions funded the purchase of new instruments and a repair mission with violin maker Phillip Injeian to Farfa, Italy, where the orchestra had found a temporary refuge from the war. Phillip fixed all of the string instruments including one cello with a bullet hole, allowing the orchestra to resume concert activities with a refurbished string sound. After the Sarajevo project she continued creating connections with the international music community by promoting a series of summer musical Odyssey excursions, bringing local music lovers to different culturally rich locations around the world to sample recitals, concerts and operas. In 1995 Marianne founded the Free Young Persons' Concert Series at Pequot Library and in 2002 re-made these concerts under a new entity, Music for Youth (MFY). MFY's mission of musical enrichment has been both innovative and successful. In addition to the Free Young Persons concerts, MFY funds residencies by professional musicians in the Fairfield and Bridgeport schools and an annual scholarship for local graduates continuing their musical education. Her awards include the Ruth Steinkraus Cohen Memorial Outstanding Women of Connecticut Award and the Connecticut Commission on the Arts Distinguished Advocate for the Arts, both in 2003 and the Westport Arts Advisory Council Champion of the Arts Award in 2010. A service and concert of remembrance including the Enso Quartet, a regular participant in Music for Youth programming, will be held at 5pm on June 23 at Trinity Episcopal Church in Southport. Charitable donations can be made in her name to Music for Youth, Inc., P.O. Box 403, Westport, CT 06881. 413-582-0346 for information."

In keeping with her belief in the importance of being an active member of an active community she has donated her remains towards the advancement of research and education.

It starts Monday with ''Psycho'' and concludes Aug. 20 with ''Raiders of the Lost Ark,'' and on Mondays in between are heavyweights like ''On the Waterfront'' (July 9), ''All About Eve'' (Aug. 13) and ''The Wizard of Oz'' (July 2), which, weather permitting, may well generate the season's biggest turnout. (I remember when ''Casablanca'' closed the festival a few years back. Some viewers reverently whispered famous lines a moment before they were uttered on screen.) Of course there are traditions to be observed, namely a trailer or two, the presentation of a vintage Looney Tunes short and (fanfare please) the ritual crowd dance to the quasi-disco, 1980s-era HBO theme music, a 60-second revel to shed workday stress before the feature.

On his 42nd birthday, Mickelson teed off with the stated goal of going low in his third round and putting himself back into contention. An opening six-over 76 has made the rest of the week a steep climb for Mickelson, but his swing felt good and he was confident the putts would begin to fall."

''The brand's DNA is all about the happiness in colors and prints, so this feels like a natural extension,'' she said, which is another way of saying that La Maison's prints are derived from the current season and past collection hit-makers. The collection includes everything from porcelain dinner plates and linen dishcloths to butter dishes, egg cups and even charming lunchboxes. And, with everything priced between $30 and $150 (similar to their sold-out 2006 Target collaboration), customers can afford the luxury of changing their home décor as often as they change their mood and clothes.

2012-06-17T00:00:00Z,"A chart last Sunday with an article about the abuse of prescription stimulants by high school students referred incorrectly to the availability of a generic equivalent of one drug, Concerta. A generic form of the drug has been available since 2011; it is not the case that it is not available and that therefore Concerta could be more expensive. The article also referred incorrectly to Nan Radulovic, a health care worker in Santa Monica, Calif., who said students had asked her for Adderall prescriptions. She is a social worker, not a Ph.D. and psychotherapist and therefore is not a ''Dr.''"

2012-06-17T00:00:00Z,"In last Sunday's Big City column, Ginia Bellafante examined the controversy over the New York Public Library's plan to add a circulating collection to its flagship Fifth Avenue branch and move two million research volumes to off-site storage. On NYTimes.com, readers criticized the plan; a selection of their comments is below. Those who enthuse over the plan -- or at least pooh-pooh its critics -- cannot be current users of the main research library. The fact is the facility is already overcrowded, notably with tourists coming into the building to photograph the ceiling murals and gawk open-mouthed at the architecture. Moreover, as I can attest, a great many books are already in storage, and after you have waited two or three days for the book to be transported from Princeton, N.J., you stand a good chance of having to request it all over again: ''The request must not have gone through,'' you are told, or perhaps ''the book must be lost.''"

2012-06-17T00:00:00Z,"THE musculature is thick and extravagant on ''WIXIW'' (Mute), the sixth full-length album by Liars in just over a decade. That's remarkably productive compared with other Brooklyn bands of the early 21st century, especially given this one's peripatetic nature. For much of the last decade the group -- with Angus Andrew, Aaron Hemphill and Julian Gross as its steady members -- has been changing direction so often and with such vigor that it often appeared to be working against its own best interests. The band has carved out an erratic path that's found it recording in New Jersey, Berlin and now Los Angeles, making songs that were sometimes moist and human and sometimes frigid and electronic, lately interested in traditional structure but only after ignoring it altogether. ''WIXIW'' feels like a reconciliation of many of those directions. Mr. Andrew sings with feeling and integrity, and the band returns to its earliest rhythmic impulses, making for some beautiful art-soul that sometimes recalls early Depeche Mode and other chilly romantics of the early 1980s, and sometimes the bands that dismantled their beauty but kept the pulse. This week Liars play their first New York show since the album's release. 7 p.m. Wednesday, Webster Hall, 125 East 11th Street, East Village, (212) 353-1600, websterhall.com; $20."

Instead, another cab pulled up and we quickly agreed on a price. He drove up the Harlem River Drive chatting energetically over his headset in his native language.

(Bravo) MISS ADVISED They may be pros at dispensing advice to the loveless, but the relationship experts (from left above) Julia Allison of Los Angeles, Emily Morse of San Francisco and Amy Laurent of New York have less-than-stellar track records when it comes to their own romantic lives. This new series follows the women as they try to practice what they preach. For Ms. Allison that means following a 73-point checklist. For Ms. Laurent it's adhering to what she calls ''the rules.'' And for Ms. Morse, whose mission is to help people have better sex, it means keeping an open mind about love and especially monogamy. 7:05 A.M. (MoreMax) OUT OF AFRICA (1985) Meryl Streep (right) earned her fourth best-actress Oscar nomination as the Danish writer Karen Blixen, who later published under the name Isak Dinesen, in this sweeping drama -- and best picture winner -- about her life on a coffee plantation in British East Africa, now Kenya.

2012-06-18T00:00:00Z,"Responding to the challenge that President Obama posed in his order last week to stop deporting some illegal immigrants, Mitt Romney declined to say on Sunday whether he would reverse the president's decision if he takes up occupancy of the White House. Although Mr. Romney said during the Republican primary debates that he would veto the Dream Act, which would provide a path to citizenship for some illegal immigrants, he was more equivocal about Mr. Obama's order last week. It allows work permits and prevents deportation for as many as 1.4 million undocumented immigrants under the age of 30 who were brought to the United States as children."
2012-06-18T00:00:00Z,"For most of its deliriously odd 75 minutes ''Space//Space,'' a mythic and slyly theatrical production by the experimental company Banana Bag & Bodice, seems like some kind of cosmic joke. It's about brothers in space, bored out of their minds. This trip has the trademarks of dark science fiction, but it's more silly than sinister. The siblings' every move is recorded, but no one is watching. They eat ''emergency sandwiches'' even though the term seems designed to make the meal seem less ordinary.

2012-06-18T00:00:00Z,"Out in the Mojave Desert in California, a power plant that could eventually generate enough electricity for 140,000 homes hopes to get its moment in the sun soon. When the $2.2 billion solar thermal plant known as Ivanpah is completed -- sometime next year, if all goes according to plan -- nearly 350,000 mirrors on 3,600 acres will reflect light onto boilers. Steam will power turbines, which will generate electricity that flows to California homes. It will be the largest such plant in the world. These ''solar workhorses of the desert,'' says V. John White, an analyst in Sacramento and an advocate for renewable energy, ''can produce a lot of high-quality energy in the way that other renewable energies can't do. And there are only a handful of places on the planet that have solar radiation that good.'' But some opponents have criticized the Obama administration for pushing solar projects that don't pan out. The solar-panel maker Solyndra declared bankruptcy last year despite receiving $528 million in federally guaranteed loans, while BrightSource Energy, one of Ivanpah's developers, has benefited from a similar $1.6 billion government loan. It's expensive harnessing the sun. And the costs go beyond construction. BrightSource says that it has spent more than $56 million relocating desert tortoises.

Well, who wouldn't? Despite burdening Wonka with a psychological back story and forcing a redemptive father-son reconciliation onto Dahl's tale, ''the sumptuous, eerie look and mood of the movie make it possible to ignore this dispiriting and superfluous adherence to convention,'' A. O. Scott wrote in The New York Times. He added: ''There is simply too much pleasure to be found in Wonka's world to get too hung up about his relationship with his dad. The real lesson of 'Charlie and the Chocolate Factory' is -- or should be -- that pleasure and curiosity are their own rewards.''"

They will play the Apollo Theater in Harlem on June 28. Various combinations of the brothers - Marlon, Jermaine, Tito and Jackie - have performed over the years, including an appearance at last year's ''Michael Forever'' concert in Wales, but this tour will be the first time all four have toured together since 1985. After Michael Jackson's death the four did a reality show on A&E called ''The Jacksons: A Family Dynasty,'' which explored their attempts to stage a comeback before their brother died."

Picking up the pieces of three workweeks shattered by midday school events, early dismissals and half-days, I could send only a quick, impassioned agreement. June, as no general ever said but every mother knows, is hell. It's hard not to love summer, what with fresh tomatoes, sunny days and the aura of freedom. But that freedom for children comes at a high price for working parents: even the most free-range young children cannot be left to roam the house and the neighborhood unsupervised. Every week of camp, grandparent care or summer school presents an opportunity to sort out and bungle a new schedule of pickups, drop-offs, lunches and sunscreen. The need to manage a different structure is as oppressive as a string of 90-degree days."

This program presents highlights from the event, at which an ''all-time team'' was selected by the Mets' play-by-play announcers Gary Cohen and Howie Rose, and the writers Mike Lupica and John Harper of The New York Daily News, Mike Vaccaro of The New York Post and Marty Noble of mlb.com. The team comprises Davey Johnson (manager), Keith Hernandez (first base), Edgardo Alfonzo (second base), José Reyes (shortstop), David Wright (third base), Mike Piazza (catcher), Cleon Jones (left field), Carlos Beltran (center field), Darryl Strawberry (right field) and the pitchers Tom Seaver, Jerry Koosman, Roger McDowell and Tug McGraw. 3 P.M.

But his father has been demoted, so James will have to settle for working at a rundown amusement park. Kristen Stewart plays James's crush, a moody N.Y.U. student secretly involved with a married maintenance man (Ryan Reynolds). Writing in The New York Times about this film from Greg Mottola, A. O. Scott said, ''The smart, slightly depressive vibe feels just right-- for James's era and for our own as well.''"

Oh, I knew that light-starved, water-logged people were out there romping around Piccadilly Circus like newly escaped captives of a crypt. Yet there I was, some feet below street level in the Apollo Theater, grinning away at a fine, murky spectacle of unhappiness like a member of the Addams Family in a torture chamber. What can I say? Whenever the Tyrones are willing to share their misery with me in style, I'm on board. This self-devouring clan, which Eugene O'Neill modeled closely on his own family, has been reassembled to revelatory effect in Anthony Page's excellent revival of ''Long Day's Journey Into Night,'' which runs through Aug. 18.

2012-06-21T00:00:00Z,"Fans of James Joyce who were unable to attend the annual ''Bloomsday on Broadway'' readings at Symphony Space on Saturday - along with anyone who appreciates the sound of famous literature read aloud by trained actors - will want to sample the BBC Radio 4 production ''James Joyce's Ulysses,'' currently accessible to American listeners on the BBC Web site. Broadcast on Saturday - June 16 being the day when the action of ''Ulysses'' takes place - this new radio adaptation consisted of segments scattered across the day's schedule, at times roughly corresponding to the movements of Leopold Bloom and Stephen Dedalus across Dublin in the novel. The high-profile cast includes Stephen Rea as narrator, Andrew Scott (Moriarty in the BBC ''Sherlock'') as Dedalus and Henry Goodman (''The Damned United,'' ''Notting Hill'') as Bloom. The nine segments totaling five and a half hours, available free on the BBC iPlayer site for two weeks, include the dramatization (with songs and sound effects) as well as radio chit-chat and live commentary by the journalist and writer Mark Lawson, introduced by the BBC host J.P. Devlin in Joycean terms as ''the stately, plump Mark Lawson.''"

2012-06-23T00:00:00Z,"ROTHENBERG--Sheldon P. May 28, 1929 June 22, 2012. Born in Brooklyn, NY. Shelly attended Stuyvesant High School and graduated in 1950 from New York University. In 1955 he graduated first in his class from Chicago Medical School. During his residency at The Bronx VA Medical Center, he was introduced to basic research by Drs. Solomon Berson and Rosalind Yalow (Nobel Laureate). This launched his passion for scientific research and drove him through his career to investigate the scientific basis of clinical problems. He joined the faculty of New York Medical College in 1961. In 1980, he moved to SUNY Downstate Medical Center as Chief of the Division of Hematology/Oncology at the Veteran Affairs Medical Center Brooklyn, and then at Downstate Health Science Center. Shelly's research focus was vitamin B12 and folic acid metabolism. He developed the first radioimmunoassays for both vitamins and his studies of their physiology and functions in related disease processes were recognized nationally and internationally. Shelly was a brilliant diagnostician and caring bedside doctor sought after by colleagues for his clinical acumen and loved by his patients. He was an inspiring and demanding teacher who insisted on learning from the book and more importantly from the patient. Medical students and residents vied to be assigned to his service. He repeatedly received the Excellence in Teaching Award at New York Medical College, and later at SUNY Downstate Medical Center. Shelly retired as Chief of Hematology/Oncology in 2003, but continued to direct his laboratory until 2007, finally stepping down after half a century of unstinting devotion to his beloved profession. Shelly's career as a professor, physician and scientist epitomized the best of the medical profession. In recognition of his accomplishments he received The New York State University Chancellor's Award for Exemplary Contributions to Research and Scholarship in 2005. He is survived by his wife, Dr. Maria da Costa, his daughters, Pamela (Mark) and Diane (Fletcher) and grandchildren Tess, Jeremy, Callie and Mia.

2012-06-23T00:00:00Z,"DONTZIN--Michael Joseph. Retired Justice of the Supreme Court of the State of New York, New York County, died peacefully at his home in New York City on June 22, 2012 after a long battle with cancer. Judge Dontzin was 89 years old. Judge Dontzin was born in New York City to immigrant Russian parents, Joseph and Miriam, and attended Stuyvesant High School. During the Korean War, he served as a corpsman in the US Navy. He went on to attend Washington State University in Pullman, then transferred to New York University where he received a B.A in 1948 and a J.D. in 1951. Working as a trial lawyer in private practice, Judge Dontzin became an activist in the Liberal Party, where he was a protege to leaders Alex Rose and David Dubinsky. His activity in politics reflected his passion for social justice, and for the vibrancy and well-being of the city he loved. He practiced law until 1966 when he was appointed as Counsel to Mayor John Lindsay, where he was the Mayor's liaison to the Police Department and the Court System, and led the Mayor's Screening Committee on the Judiciary. Appointed by Mayor Lindsay as Judge of the Criminal Court of the City of New York in 1972, he was elected as a Justice of the Supreme Court, New York County in 1976 and re-elected to successive terms until his retirement from the bench in 1992. Judge Dontzin became the Chief Judicial Officer of the alternative dispute resolution firm Endispute in 1992, which later became JAMS. He resolved thousands of commercial, employment, insurance, mass tort, and other cases as mediator or arbitrator, and became a leading proponent of ADR. At the same time, he founded The Dontzin Law Firm with his son Matthew S. Dontzin and practiced law actively until his death. In the last days of his life, he presided over the marriage of a gay couple in his home, keeping a promise to a friend. The law was his great passion and he will be remembered as a skillful and accomplished jurist. He is survived by his devoted wife of 35 years, Janet Sarno, an actress; daughter Lisa; son Matthew; daughter-in-law Ginger; and grandchildren Maegan Mishico and Cole Dontzin. When not practicing law, Judge Dontzin's other great passion was to serve as his wife's Stage Door Johnny, accompanying her to each of her theater performances. Judge Dontzin was predeceased in 1990 by his former wife Marion Bell Seldin, who remained a close friend after their divorce. The family will receive guests on June 25 and 26 from 6pm to 9pm at the home of Matthew S. Dontzin, 6 East 81st Street, NYC. A memorial service will be held at a later date.

Helen Mirren, above, portrays Rachel Singer, a celebrated Mossad operative who, with two other agents -- her ex-husband, Stephan Gold (Tom Wilkinson), and David Peretz (Ciaran Hinds) -- captured and killed the Mengele-like Nazi fugitive Dieter Vogel (Jesper Christensen), known as the Surgeon of Birkenau. Her exploits have become the subject of a book written by her daughter (Romi Aboulafia). But eventually the accepted account of Rachel's actions begins to erode. Jessica Chastain, Marton Csokas and Sam Worthingon play the agents as young adults in Berlin. ''The claustrophobic, unspoken bonds and rivalries that link Rachel, David and Stephan in their younger and older incarnations are overshadowed by Vogel and everything he represents, and a finely observed study of desire under duress gives way to a breathless and pedestrian globe-trotting thriller,'' A.

Demand for the 271 units sold by dealers translated to a churn rate of four days, Edmunds said. The Scion FR-S, which was developed with the BRZ, experienced a five-day churn."
2012-06-24T00:00:00Z,"Philadelphia WE'RE always saying that ''children are our nation's most valuable resource.'' Unfortunately, we don't behave as if we believe it. Between 2000 and 2010, the number of children living in poverty in America increased by 41 percent, and now includes nearly one-quarter of our kids. Growing up in poverty is bad. It leads to lower graduation rates (a third of these children will not graduate from high school); lower incomes (nearly half will still be living in poverty at age 35); and lower life expectancy (by about eight years)."
2012-06-24T00:00:00Z,"IT'S the fashion equivalent of a Lotto hit. A single item from a designer's collection catches the public's fancy and blows up. There is a sound of rejoicing along Seventh Avenue as cash registers go ka-ching. (Well, cash registers are now mainly digital and hushed, but you get the idea.) Think, historically, of Claire McCardell's 1942 Popover dress for Townley Frocks, a $6.95 garment that flew out of stores and into history, collected by museums that celebrate it as a crisp utilitarian emblem of a new generation of working women. Think of Tory Burch's ballerina flats, which not only made that designer a household name but also even richer than she already was. Think of the Fendi Baguette, a handbag created by Silvia Venturini Fendi in complete opposition to the design brief she had been handed, which was such a runaway success that, despite costing thousands, it sold many thousands and put that venerable house squarely back on the map of fashion relevance."
2012-06-24T00:00:00Z,"THE French like their leaders to be regal, so François Hollande's pledge to be a ''normal'' president will take some getting used to. Not that he seems ready to surrender any of the powers of his office or abandon Charles de Gaulle's ''certain idea of France'' as an exceptional nation. For now, the changes are a matter of style. Less spending, less glamour, less Versailles. More caution, more prudence, more modest living. So what is the new ''normal'' in Mr. Hollande's France? Stilettos Are the New Ballerinas"
2012-06-24T00:00:00Z,"When a government needs to invest in an expensive capital project -- a new sewer system, bridge or highway -- it issues bonds. Bonds raise upfront money from private sector investors, who are then paid back with interest from the tolls or charges the project generates. Until now, no one ever issued a bond to invest in people like Popeye."

He was 99. His death was announced by Chief Judge Audrey B. Collins of the Federal District Court in Los Angeles."
2012-06-24T00:00:00Z,"He was one of those salt-of-the-earth guys from the rural part of Pennsylvania. Middle-aged, married with adult kids, he'd worked his whole life running his own small business, a local restaurant that he jokingly called a bordello. His wife worked, too, and she had health insurance, but he wasn't on her policy. Maybe he couldn't afford it, or he was saving money by playing the odds. After all, he'd always been healthy. And then one day he had leukemia. I was his nurse, and he surprised me one afternoon by bringing up ''death panels.'' Usually I avoid having political conversations in the hospital, but he was preoccupied with something that wasn't real. I didn't want him worrying about a chimera when he was adjusting to a diagnosis of cancer and an inpatient hospital stay that would last six weeks or more."

2012-06-24T00:00:00Z,"MEN Milos Raonic: The 6-foot-5 Canadian may have the best serve in the men's game, and he backs it up with a much-improved ground game. Raonic lost in a third-set tiebreaker to Roger Federer in the quarterfinals in Halle, Germany, last week, despite serving 25 aces. A year ago, playing in his first Wimbledon, Raonic retired in the second round because of a hip injury, which required surgery and kept him sidelined until after the United States Open. He has had a stellar 2012, however, winning tour events in Chennai, India, and San Jose, Calif. He also beat Andy Murray in straight sets to reach the semifinals in Barcelona, Spain. His boyhood idol, Pete Sampras, said Raonic ''is not a player that people want to see on their side of the draw; he really is a dark horse for Wimbledon.''"

He would have turned 72 on June 21. The cause was a brain tumor that was discovered in 1990, his daughter-in-law Katherine Tucker said."
2012-06-24T00:00:00Z,"EUGENE, Ore. -- It was track's version of Bush v. Gore. Potential fame and fortune were on the line for the winner, if those in charge could only figure out who had won. In this case, hanging chads were not the issue. Rather, it was a photograph -- or thousands of them, taken within a second -- that somehow failed to reveal who had finished in third place and earned a spot on the United States Olympic track and field team for this summer's London Games."
2012-06-24T00:00:00Z,"A DUPLEX penthouse co-op at 70th Street and Fifth Avenue that sold for just over $40 million was the biggest sale of the week, according to city records. With wildly expensive properties being snapped up across Manhattan, this apartment, whose last owner was the late financier Theodore J. Forstmann, sold above the $36 million asking price without ever having been listed. Mr. Forstmann, a private equity pioneer, died in 2011 at 71. The co-op was sold by his estate."
2012-06-24T00:00:00Z,"With exquisite timing, a heat wave arrived on the first day of summer, and stylish New Yorkers didn't miss a beat. An estimated 14,000 yoga enthusiasts paved Broadway from 42nd Street to 48th Street with their bodies to mark the solstice. Men went to work in white linen suits or dark suits with Bermuda shorts. Many women observed summer's start with crisp sleeveless white dresses or openwork embroideries and fabrics."
2012-06-24T00:00:00Z,"ONE morning some birder pals and I spend an hour at Sapsucker Woods in Ithaca, N.Y., watching two great blue herons feed their five rowdy chicks. It's a perfect setting for nesting herons, with an oak-snag overhanging a plush green pond, shallows to hunt in and a living larder of small fish and frogs. Only weeks old, the chicks are mainly fluff and appetite. As mom and dad run relays, the chicks clack wildly like wooden castanets, beaks flying, pecking like speed typists. Sibling rivalry is rarely so explicit. Laughing and cooing, we could watch their antics all day."

And on June 16, French foreign nationals in the United States and Canada elected Corinne Narassiguin, a 13-year resident of New York City, to the lower house of Parliament."
2012-06-24T00:00:00Z,"Though the weather may not affect your road trip as dramatically as it would have in tornado-ravaged Hampton, Va., this month, it still can dramatically alter your drive. For travelers who don't want to set out for their dream destination and find, say, trees being uprooted along their path, Weather.com has created Trip Planner, an online tool that forecasts the weather along your route. The relatively simple interface allows you to enter the location you're traveling from and your final stop and reveals weather icons over the route. While it does not provide point-by-point directions, it does provide a link to Google maps, populated with your travel information. The forecasts can be predicted up to five days in advance. After that, their accuracy diminishes to a point at which you wouldn't rely on them to decide your outerwear, let alone chart your course."
2012-06-24T00:00:00Z,"June 25, 2011, Lisbon Last year I was visiting Lisbon for a long weekend, accompanied only by my camera. It was a very hot, sunny Saturday afternoon. I was coming back from a long walk by the pier and decided to take this busy pedestrian street back to the city center. I snapped this shot of a street performer because I loved the expressions of the people looking back at him. And I liked the composition: the lines of the yellow buildings and the pavement's black tiles all converge on him. I felt pulled in. ELENA BARONI, Vancouver"
2012-06-24T00:00:00Z,"June has been very good for Texas Rangers closer Joe Nathan. He is the only player from Stony Brook University to reach the major leagues, and four years ago he donated $500,000 to help the university build a baseball field, which bears his name. The Seawolves reached their first College World Series this month, and Nathan has thrived along with his alma mater. Nathan had not allowed a run this month entering the weekend, and last week he passed the Yankees' Mariano Rivera as the career leader in save percentage (minimum 250 chances). Nathan has converted 15 of 16 save chances this season and 276 of 309 in his career, a success rate of 89.32 percent."
2012-06-24T00:00:00Z,"Hotels with spas that offer treatments for teenagers are nothing new, but some properties have aimed at a younger audience: the under-13 set. Rosewood Hotels and Resorts recently created a new junior menu at its Sense spas in Bermuda, Vancouver and San Miguel de Allende, Mexico, and is adding more locations. Options include a 25-minute facial for $60, a 50-minute manicure and pedicure for $75 and a 25-minute foot massage for $60. Such treatments, for preteenagers, are shorter and less expensive than adult services."

2012-06-24T00:00:00Z,"This column appears in the June 24 issue of The New York Times Magazine. The average person makes more than 200 decisions about food every day, and most of the time isn't even aware of it. We may take a stand each morning when it comes to ordering a tall, nonfat, no-foam latte, but for the most part, we tend to consume what's put in front of us. When we eat out, everything from a restaurant's lighting to the menu design to the size of the plate or cup influences how much we eat and drink."

Today is the summer solstice (the new season officially begins at 7:09 p.m. in New York), and I am reminded of one of my childhood joys. In June, my friends and I would roam the weedy suburban woods at the edges of playgrounds and parking lots in search of white mulberry trees and their prized dark fruits. Our lacquered lips and plum-stained fingertips betrayed our feasting expeditions."

He may look like the Snuggle mascot's accountant, as he says in the film, but he parties hard and punches harder. (The unlucky recipient of his mean right hook is his owner, John, played by Mark Wahlberg, above.) For a stuffed animal lacking opposable thumbs, he's also quite adept with a bong. But as walking, talking plushies on the screen go, he's just one in a long line. And he's not even the most twisted thing out of the toy chest. MEGAN ANGELO"
2012-06-24T00:00:00Z,"Italy arrived at Euro 2012 with a lot of baggage: doubts sowed in South Africa in 2010 and a domestic match-fixing investigation, prompting many to question the Azzurri's ability to compete under the taint of more scandal. England was followed by the usual issues. But unlike past tournaments, when the coach was facing the potential boot, the newly installed Roy Hodgson is surprisingly laid back. And Wayne Rooney came into the tournament with a red-card suspension. Usually, that is how he exits. After sitting out the first two matches, Rooney has returned and aims to capitalize on an uncharacteristically suspect Italy defense. He will have the support of young and energetic wings Ashley Young and James Milner, and Danny Welbeck, Rooney's Manchester United strike partner. Hodgson hopes his team will attack with pace and synchronicity."

But in recent years, local artists and artisans have opened small shops and studios in the neighborhood, many in the traditional wooden houses called machiya, spurring a revival. Here, time-honored Japanese traditions get a modern spin -- from hand-printed paper to classic confections -- with nary a souvenir chopstick in sight. INGRID K. WILLIAMS"

To sample them, you'll have to be 30,000 feet in the air. British Airways recently began marketing in-flight meals called ''Height Cuisine,'' designed by Mr. Blumenthal to retain their flavor in flight. On board, low air pressure and dehydration cause passengers to lose 30 percent of their sense of taste, a British Airways spokeswoman said. So Mr. Blumenthal and a team of chefs, suppliers, and nutritionists create meals packed with enough umami -- that savory taste found in tomatoes and Parmesan cheese -- to satisfy fliers' impaired palates."

2012-06-26T00:00:00Z,"Hans Neuendorf, the chief executive of Artnet, an art-market information company that has helped to transform the way art is bought and sold, has stepped down, handing the reins of the company to his son, the New York Observer reported. In addition, the company is ceasing publication of its online magazine and on Monday closed its magazine offices in New York, Berlin and Paris, according to the Observer. Journalism has been something of a sideline for Artnet, which built its main business by functioning as a kind of Bloomberg terminal of the art auction world. It maintains a database of historical auction prices that now numbers in the millions on which collectors, dealers and auction houses like Sotheby's and Christie's rely, and art galleries also use the company to list and publicize available art works online. Over the last several years, Artnet has also begun to build an online auction business and to develop a system to provide analytical data about the market performance of individual artists."

(BBC America) INSIDE MEN Three employees of a cash-counting center execute a $250 million heist in Bristol, England, in this mini-series, part of the network's ''Dramaville'' programming block. Steven Mackintosh, above, plays John, the manager of the business, who is fed up with his average existence; Warren Brown is Marcus, a forklift driver struggling with debt; and Ashley Walters is Chris, a security guard determined to provide a better life for his family. In Part 2 (of four), the men connect with a businessman who can help them get guns. John, meanwhile, has been recommended for a promotion. The central narrative ''is plausible and entertaining,'' Mike Hale wrote in The New York Times. ''But the procedural aspect is continually diminished to make room for a number of baggy subplots.'' Still, he added, ''These embroideries are tolerable -- if you have an appetite for heist pictures, anyway -- because of Mr. Mackintosh, who always reappears to give the story a jolt.'' 4 P.M. (Sundance) APRÈS LUI (2007) After her son (Adrien Jolivet) dies in an automobile accident, a bookshop owner (Catherine Deneuve) becomes obsessed with his friend (Thomas Dumerchez), who was driving the car.

In ''Paris Je T'Aime'' (2007), at 8, 18 vignettes by directors like Olivier Assayas, Joel and Ethan Coen, Gus Van Sant, Alfonso Cuarón and Tom Tykwer pay homage to the city's neighborhoods. The cast includes Juliette Binoche, Steve Buscemi, Ben Gazzara, Natalie Portman, Fanny Ardant, Maggie Gyllenhaal, Nick Nolte, Gena Rowlands and Gérard Depardieu. Writing in The Times, Stephen Holden described the film as ''a cinematic tasting menu consisting entirely of amuse-bouches,'' adding that ''if there is no need for a main course, you still leave feeling vaguely disappointed at not being served one.''"

When Mr. Dilan made the point that Ms. Velázquez was virtually ''appointed'' by party bosses, he was referring to her appointment to the City Council 28 years ago; he was not referring to when she was first elected to Congress 20 years ago."

2012-06-27T00:00:00Z,"BERENS--Abraham. (1908-2012) It's a lot brighter today wherever the really good guys go after their days on this planet because Abe has moved there after almost 104 years of befriending and helping so many here. Abe was our remarkable, loving, caring Patriarch of the entire global Berens family. Husband of his beloved lifelong partner Mary, father of Sandy (Marcia), Susan (Alan), and Bobby. Beloved grandfather to Andy, Lisa, Carolyn, Jennifer, Jeff and great-grandfather to Cameron, Colby, Connor, Baden, Talia, Landon, Avery, Ben, Gabrielle, Alyssa and Emma. Brother to Esther (Ed), Jean (Mac), Phil (Pearl), Jules (Jolana), Pearl (Murray) and Honey (Lee). To his last days he sent birthday congratulations and generous gifts, noted on his bulging daily family calendar, to his hundreds of family members world-wide, including Carol Pozefsky and literally hundreds of devoted nieces, nephews and cousins. Graduate of Boys High, CCNY (he attended full-time daily while working full-tine at night in the Brooklyn Post Office, for whose baseball team he was the starting and winning pitcher at Ebbets Field), and the Medical School of the University of St. Andrews in Scotland, where he learned the lost art of truly caring for patients and also learned on the Old Course his life-long passion for golf, which he played into his second century. Rose to rank of Major during four years in U.S. Army in WWII in what now is Pakistan. An internationally acclaimed Radiologist in his Brooklyn office on the corner of Bedford and Fenimore for more than fifty years, he invented, designed and produced the cobalt machine for treatment of his cancer patients, many of whom he treated pro bono. Supporter of all good causes, from dogs, cats and manatees to the Southern Poverty Law Center, he went to the polls at age 100 to vote for Barak Obama, whom he surely still is supporting. Ardent fan of the underdog. He was grateful not only for his family but also for two remarkable caregivers named Gela and Bina. In lieu of services or donations, Abe asked that you give your family and other loved ones a big hug."

2012-06-28T00:00:00Z,"Are the sales figures for Justin Bieber's latest album a modest success, or a major smash? The answer shows how complicated the music industry's accounting has become in the digital age. Mr. Bieber's latest album, ''Believe'' (RBMG/Island), opened at No. 1 on the Billboard album chart this week with 374,000 sales, according to Nielsen SoundScan.

Its sales fell significantly short of industry predictions, which were at 400,000 and above. And while it is the year's biggest debut, it is far from the biggest sales week of the year.

''Orphans'' is best remembered in New York as a critically acclaimed hit Off Broadway in 1985, starring John Mahoney (''Frasier'') as Harold and Terry Kinney and Kevin Anderson as the brothers, Treat and Phillip. That production, directed by Gary Sinise, started at Steppenwolf Theater Company in Chicago, and it was one of several New York transfers that brought Steppenwolf to wider attention in the 1980s.

Mr. Bonneville plays Ian Fletcher, the head of deliverance, charged with overseeing a staff (Karl Theobald, Amelia Bullmore and Vincent Franklin) so inept that it's a surprise anything gets done. Olivia Colman is Sally Owen, Ian's ultraefficient and overly protective assistant, who lives in hope that one day he will notice her. And Jessica Hynes (above with Mr. Bonneville) is Siobhan Sharpe, the speed-talking public relations specialist who undoes Ian and just about everyone else in her path.

Under an ''emergency decree'' handed down on June 14, the institute, a non-partisan entity that formerly reported directly to the president, now responds to a Senate riven by partisanship. Its new mandate: to direct its activities at the Romanian diaspora community. As a result, collaborations with American arts institutions - including Lincoln Center, co-sponsor of an annual Romanian film festival, and publishing houses specializing in translated literature -- could be in jeopardy.

2012-06-29T00:00:00Z,"10 P.M. (13) MY REINCARNATION (2011) ''POV'' begins its 25th season with this chronicle of the relationship between Chogyal Namkhai Norbu, a master of the Dzogchen tradition of Buddhism who has lived in Italy for a half-century, and his Western-born son, Yeshi. Recognized since the age of 5 as the reincarnation of his father's uncle Khyentse, a Dzogchen master himself, Yeshi (above right, with his father) has instead embraced the modern world despite the hundreds of followers in Tibet who have long hungered for his arrival. Now in his 30s, he has a family of his own and a career in information-technology management. The director Jennifer Fox followed the family for more than 20 years and was granted access to the Dalai Lama to tell this story of love, spiritual awakening and destiny. ''Especially in the early footage Chogyal Namkhai Norbu is an engaging, charismatic figure; by the end Yeshi is finding his own footing, able to relate to a young, wired-in audience,'' Daniel M. Gold wrote in The New York Times. '' 'My Reincarnation' makes a pretty strong case: When the family business is enlightenment, listen to your dad.'' 8:30 A.M.

But before the gender-reassignment surgery Bree must tie up a loose end and soon is on the road with the previously unknown son (Kevin Zegers) she fathered when she was known as Stanley. ''In this debut feature by Duncan Tucker, who wrote and directed it, 'Transamerica' sets out to affirm Bree's dignity, to liberate her and others like her from any association with camp or freakishness,'' A. O. Scott wrote in The Times. ''That the film succeeds without slipping too far into sentimentality or didacticism is in no small measure the result of Ms. Huffman's wit and grace. (She may also be the first film actor of either sex to do frontal nudity, in a single movie, as both.)''"

While banks will be limited to 25 feet on Broadway and Amsterdam and Columbus Avenues, and storefronts will be limited to 40 feet on Columbus and Amsterdam Avenues, it is not the case that storefronts besides banks will be limited on Broadway.

The arbitrator's decision, issued two days after public schools closed for the summer, was a setback for Mayor Michael R.

2012-06-30T00:00:00Z,"An article on Friday about the Supreme Court's ruling on the health care law misstated the terms of an increase in the Medicare tax, to take effect in 2013, that was part of a second health care bill passed in 2010. The higher rate of 3.8 percent will apply only to incomes higher than $200,000 per year, or $250,000 for married taxpayers filing joint returns, and will be applied to investment income as well as ordinary income. Those earning less will continue to be taxed at the rate of 2.9 percent, which will apply only to earned income, as it does now. The article also gave an incorrect source for an anecdote about Frances Perkins, then the labor secretary, and Justice Harlan F. Stone in 1934 when the Roosevelt administration was seeking a justification for the Social Security program. The anecdote was taken from a a Social Security history on the agency's Web site that was forwarded to The Times by Matt Fink, a biographer. It was not related by Mr. Fink himself."

2012-07-01T00:00:00Z,"MIDNIGHT movies come in various flavors. Some, like David Lynch's ''Eraserhead,'' are creepy; others, like John Waters's oeuvre, are perversely funny. And then you have ''THE ROOM,'' which hits the Landmark Sunshine Cinema on Saturday night, at the appropriate hour. That film falls squarely into ''Plan 9 From Outer Space'' territory, in the pantheon of So Bad It's Good Cinema. But ''The Room,'' from 2003 and produced, written and directed by (and starring, of course) Tommy Wiseau, occupies a singular niche. This isn't amateurish sci-fi. It's more like excruciating soft-core soap opera, with so many continuity errors that the whole enterprise resembles a kind of unwitting cinematic dada. What began as a West Hollywood phenomenon has a regular New York home at the Landmark Sunshine, with fans near ''Rocky Horror'' mania. Audience participation -- flinging plastic utensils during the abundant displays of cryptic spoon imagery in the movie -- has gained traction. Come and savor the sublime awfulness. 143 East Houston Street, Lower East Side, (212) 260-7289, landmarktheatres.com."

2012-07-01T00:00:00Z,"Before reading this article, I was always opposed to the legalization of drugs. It seemed as though legalization would place new burdens on law enforcement and lead to unforeseen consequences. I would like to thank Patrick Radden Keefe for disabusing me of this overly simplistic view of drug policy. In his article, Keefe does a masterful job of depicting the complexity of the drug trade, showing the lengths to which the Sinaloa cartel will go to feed demand in the United States. Some form of legalization would allow these drugs to be produced more cheaply and thus cut into the cartels' profits. It would also reduce their ability to hire enforcers, bribe officials and transport their products across borders. A less muscular enemy might then give law-enforcement bodies a fighting chance.

2012-07-01T00:00:00Z,"AFGHANISTAN looks different from what we're used to seeing, at least through the eyes of the Italian conceptualist ALIGHIERO BOETTI, who traveled extensively there, operated a hotel and worked with its artisans to produce embroidered maps until his death in 1994. Starting Sunday the Museum of Modern Art looks at Boetti's career in a retrospective organized with the Museo Reina Sofía in Madrid and the Tate Modern in London. Best known as one of the leading artists of the Arte Povera movement, Boetti worked in his hometown, Turin, in the early 1960s, along with artists like Luciano Fabro, Mario Merz, Giulio Paolini and Michelangelo Pistoletto. The show, ''Alighiero Boetti: Game Plan,'' is perhaps the largest presentation outside Italy of works by Boetti, starting with his sculptural objects made of everyday materials like cardboard and including drawings like his ballpoint pen rendering from 1973, spelling out ''Mettere a Mondo il Mondo,'' or bringing the world into the world. In 1969 he started postal and map works, in which he mailed envelopes to friends, family and fellow artists in made-up places, forwarding each returned envelope to another nonexistent locale, creating imaginary journeys for people in his life.

2012-07-01T00:00:00Z,"GROWING up in the Paris suburbs, David Obadia (at right in the photo) was obsessed with Air Jordans and the American street-wear brands Supreme and Stussy. His best friend, Nelson Hassan (at left), was more drawn to the avant-garde looks of Commes des Garçons and Raf Simons. No wonder, then, that upon graduation from business school and fashion school, respectively, they started their own label, Brooklyn We Go Hard, named for the Jay-Z song. ''We like everything about Brooklyn, including Bedford Avenue in Williamsburg, Dr. Brown's soda and the Nets,'' Mr. Obadia says. (They've both been there several times, he assures us.) ''Brooklyn brings together the mainstream and the underground, which is what we want to do with the clothes.'' Last year the label gained steam when the designers introduced a sweatshirt (about $140) with ''Brooklyn Parle Français'' embroidered across the chest. It got picked up by Colette in Paris, and has been worn by Kid Cudi at the ''Hunger Games'' premiere, as well as Olivier Nakache, the director of the recent French box-office success ''Les Intouchables.''

2012-07-01T00:00:00Z,"ARON MÖREL is the antithesis of the typical bottom-line-observant publisher. He greets missed deadlines with aplomb. He ignores the time-honored spring/autumn publishing schedule, preferring to bring out books whenever they're ready. He's perfectly comfortable letting his authors steer their own projects, right down to the type of binding. This unorthodox formula has yielded some of the hippest art books of the last few years. His latest output is ''Night and Day,'' a collection of photographs by David Armstrong that were taken at the Mudd Club and other downtown Manhattan spots in the late 1970s and '80s, and that coincides with a show at the Half Gallery on Forsyth Street, through July 23. The book includes a facsimile of a poem by René Ricard (who also designed the cover) and a conversation between Mr. Armstrong and the artist Jack Pierson. ''There are no set formulas,'' Mr. Mörel says. ''We keep everything as intimate as possible. The print runs are limited. The only real rule is that the artist has to take as much control as possible.'' Mr. Mörel takes this one rule seriously: Describing a project with Elizabeth Peyton and Jonathan Horowitz, he sums up the collaboration by saying, ''I really don't know what they're going to do.''

She found diverse inspiration working as an editor for Mademoiselle magazine and as a dress designer for Tanner of North Carolina. In the months following her 60th birthday, Lukie discovered that she was also a supremely talented writer and one of her essays eventually appeared in the Best American Essays collection of 1997 published by Houghton Mifflin. For many years, she owned an art gallery in Charleston, SC and was herself a decorated watercolorist, winning The James Sudem Award from the National Academy of Fine Art in 1980. She is survived by three brothers, William, John and Alexander, her twins, Jane and Anthony and five grandchildren.

2012-07-01T00:00:00Z,"A report on June 10 in the In Transit column about the new SC Johnson Gallery in Racine, Wis., misidentified the building that houses the gallery and misidentified its architect. The gallery is in Fortaleza Hall, not in the SC Johnson Administration Building, and it was designed by Foster + Partners, not by Frank Lloyd Wright. (The headline also misidentified the architect.) The report also referred incorrectly to the gallery's inaugural exhibition. It focuses on Wright's Prairie style; it is not titled ''At Home With Frank Lloyd Wright.'' (That is part of the full name of the gallery -- the SC Johnson Gallery: At Home With Frank Lloyd Wright.)"
2012-07-01T00:00:00Z,"In a front-page Times article last week -- one discussed in this week's Big City column -- Tek Young Lin, a retired Horace Mann teacher, admitted he had had sex with students during his career. Mr. Lin downplayed the seriousness of his actions by suggesting that times were ''different.'' Hundreds of readers responded on NYTimes.com, many addressing Mr. Lin's self-justifications. A selection of reader comments is below. As one of his students, I can say that Tek was a brilliant teacher. I honestly believe HE considers his actions as ''warm'' and ''casual.'' Today we have the knowledge and wisdom to know that there is never anything ''casual'' about an adult male pursuing a young boy or girl. But the '60s and '70s in N.Y. were a time of societal oddities, and Horace Mann was a breeding ground for pushing boundaries. The lines between intimate adventure and sexual conquest were completely obliterated. With as many rules as existed in our studies in things like grammar, there were few, if any, when it came to sexual conduct. Not that it was a free-for-all, but there was bewilderment and excitement in defining what was appropriate."
2012-07-01T00:00:00Z,"There is so much to celebrate about the All-Star Game. From the relay of dominant pitchers to the kaleidoscope of uniforms to the wonderfully inclusive rule that every team must be represented, baseball should be proud of its summer showcase. Yet here we are, a full decade since the infamous tied All-Star Game in Milwaukee, and baseball is still trying to convince fans that the players actually care. This year's slogan: ''I Will Win.'' You see it on T-shirts in the clubhouse, and in television commercials with stone-faced players looking into the camera, stating the league they play for and promising, with great purpose, that they will win."
2012-07-01T00:00:00Z,"ALL three works on the new program by the tap virtuoso JASON SAMUELS SMITH have something to do with the life and music of Charlie Parker, the jazz saxophonist and composer known as Bird, who was one of the most influential figures in bop's development during the 1940s. Parker, who died in 1955, became famous for complex and brilliant improvisations. Mr. Smith, known for his own intricate rhythms, opens his Joyce program with ''Imagine,'' a new solo danced to a live five-piece band that reveals how his experiments in sound and movement led in 2009 to the creation of ''Charlie's Angels: A Tribute to Charlie Parker,'' in which the cast here will include three female tappers: Dormeshia Sumbry-Edwards, Chloe Arnold and Michelle Dorrance. The program concludes with the premiere of another group work, ''Chasing the Bird.'' All three pieces seek to unite the sounds of bop with the sights and sounds of tap. Tuesday at 7:30 p.m., Wednesday at 5 p.m., Thursday and Friday at 8 p.m. and Saturday at 2 and 8 p.m., Joyce Theater, 175 Eighth Avenue at 19th Street, Chelsea, (212) 242-0800, joyce.org; $10 to $39."

Mr. Herman was born in 1930 in Aberdeen, S.D., the fourth of five children to Jacob and Mary Herman. He graduated from Aberdeen's Central High School and later worked his way through the University of South Dakota to earn an engineering degree. Mr. Herman served twelve years in the US Navy, six years as a U.S. Naval Intelligence Officer assigned to the National Security Agency. In 1962 Mr. Herman co-founded COMRESS Inc., an early pioneer in the development and leasing of proprietary software. Ultimately, the entrepreneurial engineer would use COMRESS-profit ""seed money"" to start five other computer-related companies. The most notable was COMTEN, which Mr. Herman sold to the NCR Corp. in 1979. He would, in turn, become the Chief Executive of NCR. He also founded two nonprofit organizations, the Corporation For Open Systems and UNIX International, which helped establish software standards for the international computer industry. He would later chair the U.S. Department of Defense Computer & Communications Cost Reductions Committee. After taking early retirement in 1988, Mr. Herman relocated from Dayton, Oh. to Naples, Fla., where he married Joan. His community involvements ranged from the Miami Valley Hospital Board of Trustees to the vice chairmanship of the Naples Chapter of the American Red Cross. The Hermans moved to Tampa in the fall of 2008. Mr. Herman is survived by his wife, Joan; brothers, Vernon and Harlow; sister, Cleo (Donovan); sons, Daniel (spouse, Judith), Jeffrey (Jeanette), James (Jane), David (Sandy), Robert (Doreen) and stepson Paul Stock (Bonnie); daughters, Julie (David Holt) and stepdaughter Stephani (Rodrigo Vallejo); 14 grandchildren; and one great-grandchild.

Scheduled to run from Thursday through next Sunday, around downtown Manhattan and Brooklyn, it's part music festival, part industry showcase and part film conference -- in other words, like a smaller version of the CMJ Music Marathon, which happens in the fall. There are some choice concessions to the punk ethos once synonymous with CBGB, the old Bowery club: Fishbone and Cro-Mags, surely, along with David Johansen. And there are scattered shows by artists who would seem to suggest an extension of that impulse, like Craig Finn of the Hold Steady. But the festival also features a lot of nonconfrontational indie rock -- by Guided by Voices, Clap Your Hands Say Yeah and Dale Earnhardt Jr. Jr., for starters -- and a daylong spirits celebration. The keynote address will be by Krist Novoselic, the bassist formerly with Nirvana and, less famously, the San Francisco Bay-area punk band Flipper. Go ahead, try to make sense of the whole thing: cbgb.com."

2012-07-01T00:00:00Z,"Orbitz recently released a new version of its iPhone app that allows users to book flights, hotel rooms and car rentals in one seamless session. The upgrade is a departure from other travel apps that handle multiple reservations, like Kayak's, which sends users to browser screens within the app, and Expedia's, which requires users to enter their data repeatedly. Orbitz's investment in the app reflects its belief that travelers will increasingly make reservations by smartphone or tablet, perhaps even choosing those devices over other traditional platforms like laptops and desktops."

For that reason, parents raising white children have a responsibility to address our racist past (and present) with our children in order to help them understand it as something we must actively work to end. This is hard work, but most of parenting is hard, and there are plenty of parents out there who are struggling to succeed. ALI KRONLEY, Philadelphia"

2012-07-01T00:00:00Z,"At a statuesque 5-foot-9, Bunny Yeager had no trouble adopting the pinup poses of the '50s and '60s. Then she moved behind the lens and started taking the pictures herself. Born Linnea Eleanor Yeager, she took her nickname from Lana Turner's character in ''Week-End at the Waldorf.'' One of her most famous photos captured Bettie Page posing in front of a Christmas tree wearing only a Santa hat and a wink, a shot that helped make both of them famous when Yeager sold it to Playboy. Being a woman ''was probably an advantage,'' Yeager says, ''because young girls were relaxedwhen they posed for me.'' More than 250 of her pictures will appear in the book ''Bunny Yeager's Darkroom,'' coming from Rizzoli in September. Yeager still goes to her Miami studio every day. ''I'm 83 years old now, and I feel the same as when I started,'' she says. ''Now I am writing a new book. It is called 'Lovely Luscious Legs.' '' 'I didn't decide to become a photographer.

2012-07-01T00:00:00Z,"LAST season on Showtime's ''EPISODES'' Beverly and Sean Lincoln, the fictional creators of a British TV hit made unrecognizable by an American studio, found their marriage upended by an unlikely collision with Matt LeBlanc (the character, played by the man). That Beverly seemed the last woman who would succumb to Mr. LeBlanc's charms, or that hers would even register on his celebrity radar, pushed the humor over the top. The role earned Mr. LeBlanc, spoofing himself, a Golden Globe. But it's the Olivier Award-winning Tamsin Greig, as Beverly, who is threatening to steal the show. Boyishly slim and fortysomething with close-cropped hair in a sea of blond tresses and breast implants, Beverly is all the more beguiling because of what's not there. In Season 2, starting Sunday at 10:30 p.m., Beverly and Matt plead, cajole and wield big gifts to win back Sean (Stephen Mangan), the man they both love. But in a real-life fairy tale Ms. Greig has been transformed from a British character actor into a different kind of Hollywood swan. Leaving the girls to that other network, she joins the ranks of Showtime's fearless leading ladies of a certain age: Edie Falco, Laura Linney and Mary-Louise Parker, whose ''Weeds'' leads in at 10."

2012-07-01T00:00:00Z,"TERINO--Anthony E.,a former Chief of the Bureau of Secondary School Supervision for New York State, died in his sleep Wednesday, June 20, 2012. He was over 100 years of age. The son of immigrant Italian parents, Anthony was first in his family to attend college and obtain advanced degrees. He grew up in Far Rockaway, New York, and later taught in the same high school from which he had graduated. While studying at City College of New York and NYU, Anthony helped support his parents by working as a letter carrier. Anthony interviewed H.L. Mencken for his college newspaper and was instrumental in bringing noted Italian author Giuseppe Prezzolini to the Italian-American club to speak. Anthony went on to further his education at Columbia University. Later in life, he was awarded an honorary doctorate for his contribution to the education of youth. While teaching in night school as a young man, Anthony met and married Frances Owens of Alford, MA. She was his life partner and soul mate for 64 years until her death in 1999. After various teaching positions, Anthony began to work in the New York State Education Department, where he ultimately served as Bureau Chief for Secondary School Supervision. In this capacity, Anthony was responsible for the accreditation of all secondary schools in New York State. During these years, he was co-author of the popular textbook, Modern English in Action. In his sixties Anthony taught and served as acting president of the then fledgling Schenectady Community College. He taught at Hudson Valley Community College as well. Many private schools throughout New York State received Anthony's help and guidance in securing the required charters to operate. Among the most notable schools in New York City were St. Sergius High School for Russian Orthodox students and schools for the children of Japanese and Italian diplomats. For his work with the latter, Anthony was awarded the honor of ""Cavaliere della Repubblica Italiana,"" a form of knighthood, by the Italian government. In recognition of all his educational contributions, a Long Island lodge of the Order of the Sons of Italy in America was named for him. Anthony was loved, respected, and admired by those who knew him. He will be deeply missed by his two children, Edward and Dorothy; Edward's children, Tara, Vanessa, Wendy, Laura, and Taylor, Dorothy's children, Emily and Theodore; eight great-grandchildren; and his devoted caregivers, Donna, Johanna, Pam and Pat.

There were the usual sights and sounds of summer -- cerulean basins and Marco Polo, blue lips and splash fights. Less evident were the weeks and months of preparation by the city's parks department, which must ready filtration systems, train lifeguards and paint pool surfaces. Last summer, the city hosted nearly two million people at its outdoor pools, which range from aboveground minipools that hold only 18,000 gallons of water to behemoths like the Astoria Pool in Queens, one of 11 mega-pools that opened during the Great Depression.

2012-07-01T00:00:00Z,"IF you live in America in the 21st century you've probably had to listen to a lot of people tell you how busy they are. It's become the default response when you ask anyone how they're doing: ''Busy!'' ''So busy.'' ''Crazy busy.'' It is, pretty obviously, a boast disguised as a complaint. And the stock response is a kind of congratulation: ''That's a good problem to have,'' or ''Better than the opposite.'' Notice it isn't generally people pulling back-to-back shifts in the I.C.U. or commuting by bus to three minimum-wage jobs who tell you how busy they are; what those people are is not busy but tired. Exhausted. Dead on their feet. It's almost always people whose lamented busyness is purely self-imposed: work and obligations they've taken on voluntarily, classes and activities they've ''encouraged'' their kids to participate in. They're busy because of their own ambition or drive or anxiety, because they're addicted to busyness and dread what they might have to face in its absence."

2012-07-01T00:00:00Z,"IT seems that most any theatrical classic can be presented as the diary of a madman. ''Hamlet'' (but of course), ''Sweeney Todd'' (ditto) and ''South Pacific'' (huh?) have all been reset in mental institutions, with varying success. But surely few such productions have been as ambitious -- or as labor efficient -- as the National Theater of Scotland's ''MACBETH,'' which begins performances Thursday as part of Lincoln Center Festival 2012. Directed by John Tiffany (''Black Watch,'' ''Once'') and Andrew Goldberg, this production features a cast of exactly one. That's Alan Cumming, who has embodied all manner of decadence, divine and otherwise, in roles that include the M. C. in ''Cabaret,'' the pope according to Jean Genet and a kilt-sporting Dionysus in Mr. Tiffany's version of ''The Bacchae.'' Having passed (wisely) on the role of the Green Goblin in ''Spider-Man: Turn Off the Dark,'' Mr. Cumming now gets to strut his real superpowers by portraying every single character in ''Macbeth'' as the products of one demented soul's fevered brain. Expect the sound and fury of a cast of thousands. Through July 14, Rose Theater at Lincoln Center, (212) 721-6500, lincolncenterfestival.org; $50 to $100."

Confronted with the perennial question of whether to tell the person whose headphones are so loud that everyone can hear the dialogue of his in-flight entertainment, nearly three-quarters of respondents said that they would ask him to turn it down or solicit a flight attendant to. And if a child is kicking your seat? More than 6 of 10 would say something directly to the child or to the parent. What about getting upgraded to first class when your travel companion doesn't?

2012-07-02T00:00:00Z,"9 P.M. (HBO) MARINA ABRAMOVIC THE ARTIST IS PRESENT (2012) For more than 90 days in the spring of 2010, the performance artist Marina Abramovic, above, sat in a plain wooden chair at the Museum of Modern Art in Manhattan and gazed silently into the eyes of a succession of patrons, hundreds of thousands of whom had lined up for a chance to see her face to face. Some were held rapt; others cried. The effect was recorded in this documentary from Matthew Akers, who traces the genesis of that work. He also uses interviews and archival clips to chronicle the career of Ms. Abramovic, born to national heroes in Tito's Yugoslavia, who, as a member of the European avant-garde in the 1960s and '70s, gained a measure of fame for the fearless and sometimes violent ways she used her body in her performances. Embedded in the film is the love story between Ms. Abramovic and the German performance artist Frank Uwe Laysiepen, known as Ulay, who were romantic partners and collaborators. Writing in The New York Times, A. O. Scott said, ''Like many other recent documentaries about artists, it is more celebratory than analytical, a kind of slick, extended promotional video for its subject.'' 7:45 P.M. (Sundance) LITTLE CHILDREN (2006) Kate Winslet and Patrick Wilson, above, play Sarah Pierce and Brad Adamson, unfulfilled suburbanites who counter the boredom of their lives by embarking on an adulterous affair, in Todd Field and Tom Perrotta's screenplay from the novel by Mr. Perrotta. When Sarah joins a book club, it's ''Madame Bovary'' that's under discussion. Writing in The Times, A. O. Scott called the film superb, adding that ''Mr. Field, with his second feature -- his directing debut was 'In the Bedroom' -- proves to be among the most literary of American filmmakers, one of the few who tries to find a visual language suited to the ambiguous plainness of contemporary realist fiction.'' The result, he said, ''is a movie that is challenging, accessible and hard to stop thinking about. At one point Brad tells Sarah that beauty is overrated, something that, as the narrator notes, only someone secure in his own beauty would say. He may nonetheless be right. But in too many recent movies intelligence is woefully undervalued, and it is this quality -- even more than its considerable beauty -- that distinguishes 'Little Children' from its peers.''"

Make that legions of actors' legs, running and running and running in circles through (and at eye level with) much of the audience at the Gielgud Theater, where ''Chariots of Fire'' is now in residence. I was seated next to one of the (oh, what should I call it?) runways of the circular, multi-part stage that has been created for this amiable adaptation of the 1981 Oscar-winning movie about odds-beating British athletes at the 1924 Olympics. It's rather refreshing how much wind these lads manage to generate. They obviate the necessity of using one's program as a fan.

I would have anxious, confusing dreams about making tee times, finding the first tee and hitting impossible shots. I used to participate in a PGA Tour pro-am tournament every year. In my conscious mind, I was naturally worried about taking my game to a difficult golf course with thousands of eyes watching me play. In my dream-state mind, visions of potential disastrous pro-am shots were plentiful. In one dream, I hit a shot into a V.I.P. tent, and my ball landed on top of a table in someone's dinner plate. When I walked into the tent to find my ball, everyone inside the tent went ''Shhhhhhh'' and grew quiet. Carefully, I climbed on top of the table and hit my shot out of someone's plate. The ball ricocheted around the tent, landing in various places, and I kept hitting the ball until it finally flew out from the tent flaps and back into the fairway."

2012-07-03T00:00:00Z,"LOOKER--Robert, 1922-2012. Founder of Satco. Robert Looker, well-known industrialist, businessman, patron of the arts, and philanthropist, founder and chief executive officer of El Segundo-based Satco, has died. He was in his 90th year. Looker died at UCLA Santa Monica Hospital on June 28 after a brief illness. Satco, which Looker established in 1968, benefited greatly from his engineering inventiveness to produce pioneering models and variations of so-called unit load devices (ULDs) for air cargo, which won for his company the major market share in the field, notably with FedEX, UPS, and many airlines worldwide. Operations take place in El Segundo, near LAX, in seven buildings dedicated to the design, manufacture, sales and service of the various products. In addition there are three repair stations located in Memphis, Louisville, and Indianapolis, where maintenance service is conducted. Looker remained at the helm of the company until the end, appearing at his desk every day of the week. For most of his life, he would drive down the coast from his home in Montecito, ""Villa Califia"" (built by Gordon Kaufman, architect of the Greystone Mansion, Santa Anita and the Los Angeles Times Building); but in recent years he stayed more often at his new house on The Strand in Manhattan Beach, designed by architect Frederick Fisher. ""Dad was a hands-on and feet-on boss,"" says his son Peter, Executive Vice-President of the company. ""We called him 'Designer Bob'--he was always innovating, always improving, always leading the way. When he got something in his sights, change was on the way."" He established the high standards for the air- cargo business that remain active today. Looker was a patron of the Los Angeles Philharmonic and especially of the art scene in the city. He was at one time on the Board of Trustees of both LACE and MOCA, and was still a trustee of LACMA, and a member of the National Gallery of Art Acquisition Committee. He was an important collector of modern and contemporary art, especially German Expressionism, and his acquisitions were on display in his homes in California, New York (Greenwich Village) and London (Brompton Square). Robert Looker was born in Grosse Pointe, Michigan, on August 30, 1922, son of Oscar Looker and Dorothy Jane West Bernard, where he grew up with his older sister Dorothy. During World War II he entered the navy and attended the Naval Academy at Annapolis, graduating in 1946. He remained devoted to the school, making major donations to it, and for the last ten years he served as a member of the Academy's President's Circle. He was prominent in celebrating his class's major anniversaries, although after the 50th he organized one for 52 ++ years in New Orleans, fearing that some colleagues might not last until the 55th date. He himself went beyond year 65. While still in the Academy, on June 12, 1945, he married Mary Marjory Macbeth of Grosse Pointe, who remained his constant companion all his life; they had six children together. After his naval service, Looker joined the Huck Manufacturing Company of Detroit to work for his stepfather and mentor (Lou Huck) and became national sales manager. In 1957, he moved his family from Grosse Pointe to Santa Monica, and bought the Brownline Manufacturing Company, which he operated until 1968, when he formed Satco--as in ""Satisfactory Company."" Bob Looker was constantly striving to expand his intellectual as well as artistic horizons. He was always very interested in philosophy, theology, and hagiography (the scholarly history of saints), especially after he and his family became Catholics in 1968 and fans of the Paulist Fathers at St. Paul the Apostle Church in Westwood. Among his favorite thinkers were Cardinal Newman, Friedrich Nietzsche, Martin Heidegger, Dietrich Bonhoeffer, Hannah Arendt, and, most recently, Epicurus and Lucretius. He was so impressed with Nietzsche, and eager to spread his enthusiasm for his works, that he tried for several years to create a chair of Nietzsche studies at a suitable university, but in the end he decided that his efforts and resources would be best employed in funding the preservation and restoration of the philosopher's personal notes and papers, which were in disarray and decay in the Nietzsche archives in Weimar, Germany. With the grateful assent of the local authorities, he imported expert technicians who went to work, and after long labors put everything in order, producing 45 volumes bound in gold-tooled leather, of all of Nietzsche's published works (5 vols.), lecture notes (3 vols.), philosophical notebooks (24 vols.), memoranda (10 vols.), and musical compositions (3 vols.). An additional volume contained an index and description of the over 900 books in Nietzsche's personal library. An exact duplicate of these volumes, and microfilms of all of the material, were donated by Looker and his philanthropic arm, the Looker Foundation, to the New York Public Library in 2002. The Nietzsche project led to the founding of The Looker Foundation in 1995 for the purpose of supporting programs that address the unmet needs of children, families, education, the environment, and culture and arts. Over the years, major grants have been rewarded to Skowhegan School of Painting & Sculpture, Wheels for Humanity, and the Environment Defense Fund among many other worthy and important organizations. His family looks forward to many more years of honoring the entrepreneurial spirit of Looker and keeping the Foundation alive and giving. Looker's interest in Eastern thought and esthetics, especially Indian philosophy and Japanese design, should also be mentioned. He was a great supporter of Professor Raimundo Panikkar of the School of Religious Studies at the University of California, Santa Barbara, who helped shape his passion for these subjects, especially when viewed through Panikkar's unique merging of Eastern and Western traditions. Looker is survived by his wife Mary, his daughters Blair Ridenour (Tom) and Amy; his sons David (Monica), John, Peter, and Robert; and 10 grandchildren and four great-grandchildren. A funeral mass will be celebrated at St Paul the Apostle Church, Westwood, on Thursday, July 5, at 1:00pm."

She met her late husband, Joshua, in December, 1944, on the deck of a refugee boat sailing across the Black Sea, and married him three days later on a train in Turkey, bound for Palestine. Her incredible story of survival is told in Joshua and Isadora (Lyons Press, 2008), a book written by her grandson, Michael Benanav. After nine years in Israel Joshua and Aviva moved to the U.S., where she enjoyed a 25-year career as one of the top saleswomen at Lord & Taylor in Scarsdale, NY (which is no surprise given her charm and her love of people). She lived a life of deep emotion - joy, grief, and love - and brightened the world with her vibrance, her sense of humor, and her mondel bread. Her greatest pleasure was her family. Aviva is preceded in death by her father, Carol Rosen; mother, Anna Rosen, nee Iacobescu; husband, Joshua; daughter, Tamar; son, Jonathan; and brother Israel.

A&E will let you know just as soon as it finds out: on Monday, that cable channel said it had ordered a new series inspired by that classic Hitchcock suspense film, one that A&E is so crazily excited about that it is going straight to work on the program without producing a pilot episode. The new series, called ''Bates Motel,'' will offer ''a contemporary exploration of the formative years of Norman Bates'' as well as ''his relationship with his mother, Norma, and the world they inhabit,'' A&E said in a news release. Produced by Carlton Cuse (a show runner of ABC's science-fiction drama ''Lost'') and Kerry Ehrin (a producer and writer for NBC's ''Parenthood'' and ''Friday Night Lights''), the show will provide ''access to the dark, twisted back story and learn firsthand how Norma helped forge the most famous serial killer of them all,'' the cable channel said."

2012-07-03T00:00:00Z,"8 P.M. (TCM) STAR OF THE MONTH: LESLIE HOWARD During the 1930s and early '40s, Howard, whose on-screen persona was genteel and romantic, was considered among the most charismatic of British leading men. Although he appeared in comedies like ''It's Love I'm After'' (1937), he is mostly remembered as the aristocratic and melancholy Ashley Wilkes (above, with Vivien Leigh) in ''Gone With the Wind'' (1939). Born in London in 1893 to a British mother and a Hungarian father, he took up acting as therapy for shell shock after serving in World War I. He made his film debut in the British silent movie ''The Heroine of Mons'' (1914) and did a star turn on Broadway in ''Her Cardboard Lover'' before bolstering his film career in 1930 by reprising his stage role from ''Outward Bound.'' Howard died in 1943 when his flight from Portugal to Britain was shot down by the Germans over the Bay of Biscay. He had gone to Lisbon to lecture on theater but was active in anti-Nazi propaganda and may have been involved in intelligence-gathering activities. ''Gone With the Wind'' begins this monthlong tribute, although Howard is said to have disliked both the film and his character, and to never have read the novel. The lineup continues with ''Stand-In'' (1937), at midnight, in which he plays an efficiency expert for a New York bank who takes over a Hollywood studio to prove that it shouldn't be sold; ''The First of the Few'' (1942), at 1:45 a.m., in which he portrays the real-life fighter-plane designer R. J. Mitchell; ''The Gentle Sex'' (1943), at 4 a.m., Howard's fourth and last picture as a director, about the women's branch of the British Army during World War II; and ''The Lamp Still Burns'' (1943), which he produced, and which was released a few months after his death. Based on a novel by Monica Dickens, a great-granddaughter of Charles, it tells of the struggles of the nurses who served in British hospitals during the war. 7 P.M. (Starz) JUMPING THE BROOM (2011) Paula Patton and Laz Alonso play Sabrina Watson and Jason Taylor, lovebirds planning what should be the perfect wedding. That is, until Jason's mother (Loretta Devine), a postal employee, arrives with a chip on her shoulder at the estate of Sabrina's uptight parents. ''Our family were never slaves,'' says Mrs. Watson (Angela Bassett), who likes to converse in French. ''We owned slaves.'' Mayhem ensues as the movie examines, among other subjects, class conflict among African-American families. In The New York Times, A. O. Scott wrote that the film's director, Salim Akil, and its screenwriters, Elizabeth Hunter and Arlene Gibbs, ''fall back on the tried-and-true staple of the busy nuptial weekend to stage a talk show season's worth of conflicts and revelations, both serious and comical.'' The film, whose producers include T. D. Jakes, the Dallas minister and self-help author, is like one of Tyler Perry's movies, Mr. Scott added, but ''stripped of both the anarchic comedy and the over-the-top, operatic passions.''"

2012-07-03T00:00:00Z,"Back in the 1960s, researchers in Africa clocked the wild cheetah as it ran and determined that at full gallop, a cheetah reached a top speed of about 65 miles per hour, making it easily the world's fastest land mammal. No other quadruped or biped comes close. Galloping quarter horses top out around 47 miles per hour, while sluggish humans, in the person of the world record 100-meter sprinter Usain Bolt, have attained a top speed of less than 28 miles per hour. Even the bullet-trainlike greyhound, similar in build and running style to the cheetah, doesn't surpass 40 miles per hour.

(TMC) GREY GARDENS (1975) Before the Broadway musical and the HBO film there was this portrait of Edith Bouvier Beale and her daughter, Little Edie, directed by David and Albert Maysles. An aunt and a first cousin of Jacqueline Kennedy Onassis, the two lived as recluses in a deteriorating mansion in East Hampton, N.Y. ''There is no doubt about the artistry and devotion that the Maysles have used in recording the life in 'Grey Gardens,' '' said a review in The New York Times. ''There is no reason to doubt them when they say they love and admire the Beales. But the moviegoer will still feel like an exploiter. To watch 'Grey Gardens' is to take part in a kind of carnival of attention with two willing but vulnerable people who had established themselves, for better or worse, in the habit of not being looked at. And what happens when the carnival moves on?''"

The 2004 ruling by Stanley R. Ott of the Montgomery County Orphans' Court permitted the foundation, which had struggled financially, to go against the wishes of Albert C. Barnes, who built the collection and stipulated that no picture in it could be lent, sold or moved from the walls of the galleries that he built for it in Merion, Pa. Judge Ott said at the time that he considered the move ''the only viable alternative'' to save the Barnes from bankruptcy, but opponents argued that the foundation's troubles had been overstated."

2012-07-05T00:00:00Z,"ERMENONVILLE, France-- Jean-Jacques Rousseau may have been born in Switzerland (Geneva in fact, in 1712) and not in France. But that tiny geographic detail has not kept the citizens of the Oise, the region north of Paris where Rousseau lived briefly and died, from celebrating the philosopher all year as a national hero. ''Rousseaumania,'' as the newspaper Le Journal du Dimanche called the celebration, includes picnics, conferences, publications, debates, plays, street theater, films, documentaries, concerts and dinners to pay tribute to the author of ''The Social Contract,'' which argues for a system of government and law based on the will of all citizens and remains one of the most influential works of Western political philosophy. Rousseau's house in the town of Montmorency, where he lived from 1757 to 1762, has reopened as a museum this month after a major renovation. Fourteen restaurants in the Oise have created special Rousseau-inspired menus. An authoritative version of Rousseau's complete works has been published in more than 15,000 pages.

2012-07-05T00:00:00Z,"6 P.M. (Flix) THE DISCREET CHARM OF THE BOURGEOISIE (1972) Six upwardly mobile friends try to have dinner together -- but find they can't -- in this surrealist dreamscape from Luis Buñuel, which won an Oscar for best foreign film. Fernando Rey and Delphine Seyrig, above, lead the cast with Paul Frankeur and Jean-Pierre Cassel. Writing in The New York Times, Vincent Canby called the movie brilliant, adding, ''In addition to being extraordinarily funny and perfectly acted, 'The Discreet Charm' moves with the breathtaking speed and self-assurance that only a man of Buñuel's experience can achieve without resorting to awkward ellipsis.'' In ''A Woman Under the Influence'' (1974), at 8, Gena Rowlands plays a woman adrift, and Peter Falk is her manic husband, who keeps assuring her that everything's fine. She'll be anything he wants, she says. To which he shouts, ''Just be yourself!'' If only she were sure which one. ''A troubled person, yes, and certainly an insecure one,'' Nora Sayre wrote in The Times about this study of an unsteady marriage, written and directed by John Cassavetes, who was Ms. Rowland's husband. ''But she doesn't seem sick or crazed enough to justify the crackup that's awaiting her, nor to spend six months in a sanitarium. And that's the hitch in the movie: You can't really tell how the director regards this character.'' Still, she added, ''Mr. Cassavetes is unquestionably sympathetic to the rootless state of the Middle American housewife.'' Both Ms. Rowlands and Cassavetes were nominated for Oscars. 8 P.M. (13) NYC-ARTS Philippe de Montebello, the former director of the Metropolitan Museum of Art, and the journalist Paula Zahn report on the ''Dawn of Egyptian Art'' exhibition at the Met, the Theater for a New Audience and two works by the outsider artist Martín Ramírez at the American Folk Art Museum. In ''Poirot: Cat Among the Pigeons,'' on ''Masterpiece Mystery!'' at 9:30, David Suchet plays Hercule Poirot, Agatha Christie's debonair Belgian supersleuth. He takes on the case of a Middle Eastern princess who is hidden away from revolutionaries at an English girls' school, where, one after another, her teachers are found murdered."

2012-07-05T00:00:00Z,"CONNOLLY--James Patrick, a resident of both Stony Brook, NY and Sag Harbor, NY died on Monday, July 2 at Stony Brook University Medical Center. He was 90 years old. Born in New York City to parents Thomas Connolly and Catherine McDonagh both from Irish Counties Monahan and Galeway. He attended Stuyvesant High School. He enlisted in US Army in September of 1942. He saw action in campaigns and battles in Central Europe, Normandy, Northern France and the Rhineland. He received decorations and citations including The American Service Medal, Fame Service Medal, Good Conduct Medal and World War II Victory Medal. He was Honorably Discharged on December 24, 1945 with the rank of Staff Sergeant. He was a model for print advertising with the Hark Ryder Agency in New York City. Some say he had the same look as Clark Gable. He worked for and retired from The New York Times News Corporation after 25 years as a manager in the classified department. After retirement he volunteered at St. Charles Hospital in Port Jefferson, NY until he was 80 years old. He loved to travel the world especially on Ocean Liners. He was a gardener and had numerous cats and dogs throughout his life. He was strong willed, always had an opinion on any subject and would tell you as he saw it. A true fighter till the end of his life. He is predeceased by his younger brother Reverend Eugene G. Connolly of St. Patrick's Cathedral in New York and his younger sister Mary Connolly Shapiro of Far Rockaway, NY. He is survived by a younger brother Francis J. Connolly Sr. and wife of Medford, NY. His two nephews, Francis J. Connolly Jr. and wife of Stamford CT, Gene M. Connolly of Sag Harbor, NY and nieces and nephews Thomas Connolly, Katherine Connolly, Lauren Connolly and Brian Connolly. Viewing is at Bryant Funeral Home in East Setauket, NY on Friday, July 6th 6-9pm with a Mass and Burial at St. James RC Church at 9:30am in East Setauket, NY.

2012-07-05T00:00:00Z,"SALETAN--Eugene. Physicist, teacher, writer, poet, translator, artist, linguist, drummer, trombonist, folk dancer, skier, airman, Gene Saletan lived many lives. Until his last days, he envisioned more work to do and new paths to follow, but he ran out of time. He died on July 3rd of Non-Hodgkins Lymphoma. The second law of thermodynamics, he said, finally brought him down. He was 87 years old. The son of Russian immigrants in New York City, Gene grew up bilingual in English and Russian and went on to learn French and Italian as well as some Hindi, Spanish, Japanese, and German. He was at home and loved all over the world. During the Second World War, First Lieutenant Eugene Saletan took his place in what Tom Brokaw would later call the Greatest Generation. He served as a B-17 navigator in the 8th Air Force 96th Bomb Group and flew more than 30 missions over Germany from his base in East Anglia. He was awarded the Distinguished Flying Cross. His service years interrupted his education. So did a period of translating scientific books, notably those of the Russian mathematician Israel Gelfand, a project he tackled with the assistance of his beloved first wife, the late Elma Margaret (Peggy) Junz Saletan. The G.I. bill helped Gene earn a Bachelor's degree from Brooklyn College and a Doctorate in physics from Princeton in 1962. He taught physics at Rutgers, Cooper Union, the Birla Institute of Technology in Rajasthan, India, and for more than 25 years was Professor of Physics at Northeastern University in Boston. As Professor Emeritus, Gene continued to flourish. He worked at Northeastern in the SEED and RESEED programs, dedicated to improving the quality of science teaching in middle and high schools. He carved out time to record science texts for blind and dyslexic students through RFB&D, now known as Learning Ally. In 1998, he and Professor Jorge Jose' published ""Classical Dynamics: A Contemporary Approach."" That book joined his previous texts: ""Theoretical Mechanics,"" written with Professor Alan Cromer in 1971 and ""Dynamical Systems"" (1985) undertaken in collaboration with Neapolitan colleagues Professors Giuseppe Marmo, Alberto Simoni, and Bruno Vitale. And then, for fun, in 2007 he translated the children's book ""The Crocodile"" by K.I. Chukovsky from Russian into English. He leaves his adored and adoring wife, the former Ellen Nurnberg, also known as Ellen Cole, his dearly loved nephews, nieces, and cousins, and many cherished friends. Good night, sweet prince. In lieu of flowers, contributions may be made in Eugene Saletan's honor to The Leukemia & Lymphoma Society or The Parkinson Research Foundation. A memorial service is being planned for later in the year."

The Lansburgh Theater, a nonprofit that serves as the landlord for one of the sites where Shakespeare Theater performs, last year told the company that its annual rent there would jump to $480,000 from $70,000. When Shakespeare Theater refused to pay the increase, Lansburgh demanded that it vacate the site and that its managing director, Christopher Jennings, resign from the Lansburgh board.

The documentary, called ''Unlawful Killing,'' is directed by Keith Allen and financed by Mohamed al-Fayed, the billionaire businessman whose son Dodi was Diana's lover and was killed with her in a Paris car crash in 1997. A British jury ruled in 2008 that Diana and Dodi al-Fayed were unlawfully killed by the negligent driving of their chauffeur and photographers chasing after them. Mr. Allen's film, which was shown out of competition at the 2011 Cannes Film Festival, suggests that a conspiracy of British royalty, politicians and secret service officers was to blame for the deaths."

The Times Square event is one of two free concerts offered by the promoters who bought the rights to the defunct punk-rock club; another concert, at the Rumsey Playfield in Central Park, will feature Cloud Nothings, Guided by Voices and the Pains of Being Pure at Heart. The festival is being held at 40 clubs around the city, offering showcases for more than 300 indie rock, punk and hard-core bands.

And in the current New York Classical Theater production of ''Twelfth Night (or What You Will),'' Sir Andrew (the adorable Ian Antal) makes a running comic entrance worthy of Pee-wee Herman. Maybe, I thought as Mr. Antal goofily demonstrated his high-leaping dance moves, wandering around with this play won't be so bad. New York Classical Theater calls its production style ''panoramic theater,'' which means that the cast moves to a new spot for pretty much every scene, and the audience follows. For this ''Twelfth Night,'' directed by Stephen Burdman, that means 16 exhausting moves, beginning and ending at Castle Clinton in Battery Park. This will never be my favorite theater format, but by the show's courtyard ending the cast had pretty much won me over."

In this edition of ''20/20,'' Barbara Walters travels to India and Israel and throughout the United States to explore the meaning of heaven with religious leaders, scientists, celebrities and people who say they have been there. Among those interviewed are Cardinal Theodore E. McCarrick, archbishop emeritus of Washington; Rabbi Neil Gillman of the Jewish Theological Seminary in Manhattan; the Rev. Calvin O. Butts of the Abyssinian Baptist Church in Harlem; Elder William R. Walker, a general authority of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints; and the Dalai Lama (above with Ms. Walters), as well as his longtime follower Richard Gere. Ms. Walters also speaks with Ellen Johnson, a former president of American Atheists; the Islamic scholar Feisal Abdul Rauf; and a member of the Palestinian group Islamic Jihad who is serving time in an Israeli prison for a failed suicide bombing. Dean Hamer, the author of ''The God Gene'' and a former geneticist at the National Institutes of Health, tries to explain why faith comes easily for some and not for others. Finally, Ms. Walters examines the near-death experience in a discussion with Deb Foster, who was clinically dead for about four minutes, and Colton Burpo, who says he went to heaven during emergency surgery. His story is recounted in the book ''Heaven Is for Real,'' written by his father, Todd Burpo, a pastor. 7 A.M.

Until his last days, he envisioned more work to do and new paths to follow, but he ran out of time. He died on July 3rd of Non-Hodgkins Lymphoma. The second law of thermodynamics, he said, finally brought him down. He was 87 years old. The son of Russian immigrants in New York City, Gene grew up bilingual in English and Russian and went on to learn French and Italian as well as some Hindi, Spanish, Japanese, and German. He was at home and loved all over the world. During the Second World War, First Lieutenant Eugene Saletan took his place in what Tom Brokaw would later call the Greatest Generation. He served as a B-17 navigator in the 8th Air Force 96th Bomb Group and flew 27 missions over Germany from his base in East Anglia. He was awarded the Distinguished Flying Cross. His service years interrupted his education. So did a period of translating scientific books, notably those of the Russian mathematician Israel Gelfand, a project he tackled with the assistance of his beloved first wife, the late Elma Margaret (Peggy) Junz Saletan. The G.I. bill helped Gene earn a Bachelor's degree from Brooklyn College and a Doctorate in physics from Princeton in 1962. He taught physics at Rutgers, Cooper Union, the Birla Institute of Technology in Rajasthan, India, and for more than 25 years was Professor of Physics at Northeastern University in Boston. As Professor Emeritus, Gene continued to flourish. He worked at Northeastern in the SEED and RESEED programs, dedicated to improving the quality of science teaching in middle and high schools. He carved out time to record science texts for blind and dyslexic students through RFB&D, now known as Learning Ally. In 1998, he and Professor Jorge Jose' published ""Classical Dynamics: A Contemporary Approach."" That book joined his previous texts: ""Theoretical Mechanics,"" written with Professor Alan Cromer in 1971 and ""Dynamical Systems"" (1985) undertaken in collaboration with Neapolitan colleagues Professors Giuseppe Marmo, Alberto Simoni, and Bruno Vitale. And then, for fun, in 2007 he translated the children's book ""The Crocodile"" by K.I. Chukovsky from Russian into English. He leaves his adored and adoring wife, the former Ellen Nurnberg, also known as Ellen Cole, his dearly loved nephews, nieces, and cousins, and many cherished friends. In lieu of flowers, contributions may be made in Eugene Saletan's honor to The Leukemia & Lymphoma Society or The Parkinson Research Foundation. A memorial service is being planned for later in the year. Good night, sweet prince."

A woman with a kind heart, she was generous to a fault to all her children and grandchildren, trusting them to care for her in her last years. She recreated for us a bygone world with crystalline recollections of her childhood in New York City where horses and trolleys were still commonplace even as soldiers returned from WWI bringing the flu pandemic of 1918 with them. Razor-sharp mind, keen dry humor, and a will of iron in a quiet woman of infinite dignity. Goodbye Mom."
2012-07-07T00:00:00Z,"A Wall Street executive filed suit on Friday against what had been New York's oldest art gallery, Knoedler & Company, charging that it and its former president, Ann Freedman, conspired with others in selling him a fake Willem de Kooning painting for $4 million. The suit is the third filed by an art collector involving a painting sold by the gallery, which closed last year. In this case the executive, John D. Howard, asserts that the gallery paid only $750,000 for the painting in 2007 and days later sold it to him for more than five times that price. ''No genuine work of art by de Kooning with a $4 million retail sale value could be purchased in good faith for $750,000,'' the lawyers for Mr. Howard, from Lynn Cahill LLP, state in the papers filed in federal court in Manhattan. Mr. Howard's suit asserts that his painting is one of a number of suspect works by Modernist masters that were supplied to the gallery by a little known Long Island dealer, Glafira Rosales. It states that the landscape, sold as a work painted by de Kooning in 1956-57, was probably created more recently by ''someone affiliated with Rosales.''"

Classic songs like John Lennon's ''Imagine'' floated over an artificial beach stocked with white sand and beach chairs. Smiling teenagers handed out cupcakes and lemonade. And on Friday, after a countdown from 3, dozens of sweaty people jumped into a turquoise pool with views of the Brooklyn Bridge to one side and the Lower Manhattan skyline to the other."
2012-07-07T00:00:00Z,"For the filmmaker Peter Jackson, this is not the end of his quest to bring ''The Hobbit'' to the screen, nor the beginning of the end, but maybe - just maybe - it's the end of the beginning: the director has finished filming in New Zealand for his long, long-in-the-works adaptation of that J. R. R. Tolkien novel. In a message posted late Thursday or early Friday, depending on how one measures, on his Facebook page, Mr. Jackson wrote: ''We made it! Shoot day 266 and the end of principal photography on 'The Hobbit.' Thanks to our fantastic cast and crew for getting us this far, and to all of you for your support! Next stop, the cutting room. Oh, and Comic Con.'' Lest it be forgotten how significant an accomplishment this is, the making of ''The Hobbit'' was nearly halted by the bankruptcy of MGM (during which the film lost its original director, Guillermo del Toro); and a labor dispute during which Mr. Jackson threatened to move the production to Eastern Europe. Mr. Jackson also underwent surgery for a perforated ulcer before his cameras finally started rolling in March of last year; that was followed by an explosion on the set and a mixed reception for some early ''Hobbit'' footage that was presented at CinemaCon in April."

Ms. Jaffe danced with Ballet Theater for 22 years, retiring as a principal in 2002. Her partners included Mikhail Baryshnikov and Ethan Stiefel, another former dean of the dance school. Ms. Jaffe will resign her position as a ballet mistress at the company, but a spokeswoman said Ballet Theater expected she would continue to choreograph and teach at its Jacqueline Kennedy Onassis School when her schedule allowed. Separately, Ballet Theater announced two promotions on Friday. Hee Seo will become a principal dancer, from soloist, and Alexandre Hammoudi moved from the corps de ballet to soloist.

2012-07-07T00:00:00Z,"9 P.M. (Starz) THE GIRL WITH THE DRAGON TATTOO (2011) Daniel Craig stars as Mikael Blomkvist, a crusading Swedish journalist hired by a wealthy industrialist (Christopher Plummer) to investigate the disappearance of his niece 40 years earlier. Rooney Mara, above, in an Oscar-nominated performance, is Lisbeth Salander, the vulnerable yet ruthlessly competent computer hacker who helps him solve the mystery in this adaptation of the novel by Stieg Larsson, directed by David Fincher. ''She is a marvelous pop-culture character, stranger and more complex than the average superhero and more intriguing than the usual boy wizards and vampire brides,'' A. O. Scott wrote in The New York Times about Lisbeth, who was first played on film by Noomi Rapace. ''It has been her fate, unfortunately, to make her furious, uninspiring way through a series of plodding and ungainly stories.'' And ''despite the slick intensity of Mr. Fincher's style, his movie is not immune to the same lumbering proceduralism,'' Mr. Scott said, referring to what he described as a flaw in the 2010 Swedish adaptation, directed by Niels Arden Oplev. ''There are waves of brilliantly orchestrated anxiety and confusion but also long stretches of drab, hackneyed exposition that flatten the atmosphere.'' Still, he added, ''Mr. Fincher's impressive skill is evident, even as his ambitions seem to be checked by the limitations of the source material and the imperatives of commercial entertainment.'' The film earned an Oscar for best achievement in film editing. 10:30 A.M. (13) RELIGION & ETHICS NEWSWEEKLY Kim Lawton interviews E. J.

The team is calling the evening ''We Love New York Night,'' and Cocca's Hotels, a chain in the capital region, has signed on to sponsor the giveaway.

2012-07-07T00:00:00Z,"Parliament refused on Friday to accept the resignation of its leader, Volodymyr M.

Mr. Lytvyn, the chairman of Parliament, has refused to sign the bill, effectively blocking it from reaching President Viktor F. Yanukovich, who could sign it into law. Instead, Mr. Lytvyn submitted his resignation, challenging the Party of Regions, which holds the majority, to choose a new chairman. Hundreds of people demonstrated against the bill this week, leading to violent clashes with the police. Under the Constitution, Ukrainian is the only official language. But Ukraine, a former Soviet republic, is home to millions of native Russian speakers, particularly in parts of the country that make up Mr. Yanukovich's base of support."

The tone, he said, Is similar to that of his 1998 New Yorker article describing the origins of ''The Power Broker,'' his interviews with Moses and the obstacles he faced. Mr. Caro added that he has an ''understanding'' about the new book with his publisher, Knopf, but no official contract and there is no scheduled publication date."

(TMC) EXIT THROUGH THE GIFT SHOP (2010) This documentary began as a historical account of guerrilla street art recorded over many years by Thierry Guetta, as he followed artists like Shepard Fairey and Invader in Los Angeles. But Mr. Guetta became the unintentional subject of his own movie when the reclusive British artist Banksy decided he would take over editing and production duties. Writing in The New York Times, Jeannette Catsoulis said that the resulting film was ''like Banksy's best work, a trompe l'oeil: a film that looks like a documentary but feels like a monumental con.'' She added: '' 'Exit' could be a new subgenre: the prankumentary. Audiences, however, would be advised simply to enjoy the film on its face -- even if that face is a carefully contrived mask.''"

2012-07-08T00:00:00Z,"FRANCES--Evan, Our Mom, Evan Frances (Agnew), passed away on June 30th, just shy of her 96th birthday. She came from a small town in Michigan, an only child from a poor family. She never knew her father, for the most part she was raised by aunts and uncles. She was Jewish. The odds were stacked against her from the beginning. She overcame them, and then some. She was born four years before women won the right to vote, two years after WWI began, 48 years before the Civil Rights Act became the law of this land. She lived to see 17 presidents elected, and witnessed her country enter into seven wars, during which more than six-hundred thousand American soldiers and six million innocent Jews lost their lives. She was an unusually bright child and diligent student, received a scholarship to attend the University of Chicago, continued her graduate studies at New York University. The war swept American men to foreign shores, jobs that were not previously available to women suddenly were. She filled one, as a reporter for a New York newspaper. The troops came home, she met our father, Alec, they started a family. Her journalism career blossomed along with her children, Andy, Jimmy and Scott. Her award-filled career as a magazine editor began at Family Weekly, continued at Family Circle and Ladies Home Journal, culminated as editor-in-chief of 1,001 Decorating Ideas. She was a member of The Society of the Silurians and the American Society of Interior Designers. Evan, that is what everyone called her, even her children, was passionate about the world around her. She was an iron lady, righteous and unbending, perhaps to a fault. She stood in Union Square for Ethel Rosenberg's vigil, fought McCarthyism, walked the lines for civil rights, brought us to Washington to protest the war in Vietnam. She instilled in her children the spirit to stand unwavering for one's principles. In turn, we have passed this virtue on to ours. To her end, she could quote verse from Shelley and Yeats. Her greatest gift was her ability to write, she was obsessive about the English language. She never spared us when it came to misusage or misspelling of a word, or proper structuring of a sentence. We are grateful and better for these and all of her lessons. She is survived by us, Andy, Jim and Scott, her grandchildren, Sam, Alec, Sophie and David, and her daughters-in-law, Jane, Cynthia and Patti. Until this weekend we called her Evan. From now on we will call her mom. A memorial will be held on August 22nd at 11am, at The Community Church of New York Unitarian Universalist, 40 East 35th St., NYC."

2012-07-08T00:00:00Z,"DRINKING milk is as American as Mom and apple pie. Until not long ago, Americans were encouraged not only by the lobbying group called the American Dairy Association but by parents, doctors and teachers to drink four eight-ounce glasses of milk, ''nature's perfect food,'' every day. That's two pounds! We don't consume two pounds a day of anything else; even our per capita soda consumption is ''only'' a pound a day. Today the Department of Agriculture's recommendation for dairy is a mere three cups daily -- still 1 1/2 pounds by weight -- for every man, woman and child over age 9. This in a country where as many as 50 million people are lactose intolerant, including 90 percent of all Asian-Americans and 75 percent of all African-Americans, Mexican-Americans and Jews. The myplate.gov site helpfully suggests that those people drink lactose-free beverages. (To its credit, it now counts soy milk as ''dairy.'')"

Since the neighborhood began emerging from decades of blight in the mid-aughts, it has been the best place to explore the city's blossoming alternative culture. ERICA GIES"

2012-07-08T00:00:00Z,"''YOU can't hold hot glass in your hand and play with it,'' says Tina Oldknow, curator of modern glass at the Corning Museum of Glass in upstate New York. ''You can't have that even casual acquaintance with the material.'' Five years ago, to help foster a more productive relationship between designers and this difficult material, Corning developed the GlassLab, a mobile glassblowing studio that has since made appearances at Design Miami, the Vitra Design Museum and the Cooper-Hewitt. This summer, it's parked near Pershing Hall on Governors Island, where Corning and the Cooper-Hewitt are collaborating on a series of free public glassblowing demonstrations on weekends through July 29. The designers invited to participate are all contributors to the exhibition ''Graphic Design -- Now in Production,'' also on view on Governors Island as part of the Cooper-Hewitt's off-site programming. As in the past, none of them have much, if any, experience with glass. But graphic designers, attests Rob Cassetti, the head of the GlassLab program, are particularly good at pushing the limits of the form. Recently, the graphic designer Peter Buchanan-Smith, who has also worked in three dimensions, put that theory to the test. He brought in a 2D rendering of a glass buoy shaped and colored like an eyeball, and then stood by as three GlassLab gaffers attempted to realize his vision. The result: a brilliantly hued piece of blown glass (above), well over a foot at its longest. ''It's pretty amazing,'' Mr. Buchanan-Smith said. ''These guys are magicians.'' Go to cmog.org.

2012-07-08T00:00:00Z,"What compels us to leave home, to travel to other places? The great travel writer Bruce Chatwin described nomadism as an ''inveterate impulse,'' deeply rooted in our species. The relentless movement of the modern world bears this out: our relative prosperity has not turned us into a sedentary species. The World Tourism Organization, an agency of the United Nations, reported nearly a billion tourist arrivals in 2011. Some 200 million people are now living outside their country of birth. This type of massive movement -- the rearrangement, temporary or permanent, of multitudes -- is as fundamental to modern life as the Internet, global trade or any other sociopolitical developments. Certainly, many of our most intractable collective challenges as a society are directly linked to our mobility: urbanization, environmental depletion, scarcity and, of course, immigration. An immigrant is a traveler without a return ticket."

John Papa, San Francisco real estate broker, architectural preservationist, patron of the arts, and global-traveler, died at home in his sleep on June 24, 2012. He was born in New Haven, CT, on January 20, 1925, the son of the late John H. and Lucy Merola Papa. As a young man he was active in the family business, Papa & Sons Open Air Market and later as a clothier to Yale students at a local men's clothing store. In 1952 Mr. Papa moved to San Francisco where he pursued a career in real estate and accumulated numerous properties including the historic Selfridge houses, a connected group of six houses designed by the Reid Brothers, located on the southwest corner of California and Pierce streets. His own residence was the Selfridge mansion at 2615 California which Julia Morgan renovated in the 1930s. Mr. Papa was frequently mentioned by the late San Francisco Chronicle columnist, Herb Caen, in his writings about San Francisco's social scene. Mr. Caen also hailed Mr. Papa for his preservation of the Selfridge houses and the creation of the Pierce Street Mews. Mr. Papa was credited with coining the term ""Pacific Heights South"" as he worked to preserve, restore and revitalize this neighborhood beginning in the 1960s. Mr. Papa often and generously entertained friends, family, and the renowned: HM Taufa'ahau Tupou IV, King of Tonga (1965-2006), Lee Evans, 1968 Olympic Gold Medalist, as well as Hollywood actors, professional musicians, and social, civic and business leaders of San Francisco. Among his distinguished performing arts guests were the great sopranos Leontyne Price and Renata Scotto, prima-ballerina Margot Fonteyn, principal dancers Rudolf Nureyev and Sir Anthony James Dowell, as well as numerous dancers of the American Ballet Theater and the Royal Ballet. An avid traveler, Mr. Papa's journeys took him to all continents. Abroad for six months each year, he spent many winters in Puerto Vallarta, and summers in Europe. He will be most fondly remembered for the many amusing postcards sent and anecdotes brought back. He was predeceased by brother, Stephen J. Papa, sisters Rose Thomas and Mary Avitable, and dearest of friends, Christy MacInnes and Rose Goldstein.

Here, young boys from Williamsburg, Brooklyn, perch in the same big barber's chair, newly shorn and relieved to have survived.

He would keep a copy for a collage he had in the shop or for storage at home. He continued the practice until he closed the shop in 2005. He died in 2007, at 90."

Fred graduated cum laude from Phillips Exeter Academy, the Yale Class of 45W, spent two years commanding a mine sweeper in the Pacific, completing his education at Harvard Business School '49.

Fred was a ""great"" fisherman and often fished in the western US. When not fishing he golfed, specializing in hitting from the rough. Over the last seven of his Golden years, he rediscovered his Senior Prom Date and shared her joy of walking on Cannon Beach in Oregon. After retiring and downsizing from four acres to 18, he became treasurer of St. Peter's Church and sang tenor in the choir until the month before he died of liver cancer.

Like many good choreographers he conveys the idea that perhaps you, with a little more training and fewer inhibitions, could do that too. That most of us couldn't manage the rhythmically complex, liquidly supple movement performed by his superb troupe is all the more reason to head this week to the Joyce Theater, where Mr. Brown will present his company, EVIDENCE, in two programs. On the first is the 1999 ''Gatekeepers,'' and the new ''Everybody at the Table,'' with which Mr. Brown continues his exploration of the music of Stevie Wonder. ''Everybody'' is an extension of ''On Earth Together,'' also set to Wonder songs, which Mr. Brown showed in 2010, and it's likely to offer similar themes of love and compassion. In the second program the company performs ''Walking Out the Dark,'' ''Seeking Healing'' and ''Come Ye'': all compelling odes to the joys -- terrestrial and spiritual -- of dancing. 7:30 p.m. Monday to Wednesday, 8 p.m. Thursday to Friday, 2 and 8 p.m. Saturday, 175 Eighth Avenue, at 19th Street, Chelsea,(212) 242-0800, joyce.org; $10 to 49."

The show, about cutthroat rivalry among cheerleaders, features high-flying gymnastics in the gasp-inducing choreography by Andy Blankenbuehler (''In the Heights''). The story, which differs from the 2000 movie, revolves around Campbell (Taylor Louderman), a head cheerleader forced out of her wealthy and very white high school thanks to redistricting. When she arrives at the tougher, more diverse Jackson High, Campbell is no longer super popular; perhaps even worse, the school has no cheerleading squad at all. Taylor tries to effect change and love, competition and maturation ensue of course. In addition to Mr. Blankenbuehler, who also directs, the artistic team includes the book writer Jeff Whitty (''Avenue Q''). The music is by Tom Kitt (''Next to Normal'') and Lin-Manuel Miranda (''In the Heights''), and the lyrics are by Mr. Miranda and Amanda Green. The plot of ''Bring It On'' is not exactly momentous -- or entirely unpredictable -- but isn't it the time of year for a buoyant fling anyway?

That's the title of BAMcinématek's eight-film retrospective of Kelly's career, which begins on Friday with a weeklong run of Alfred Hitchcock's ''Rear Window'' and continues through July 19. In ''Rear Window'' a mischievous playfulness flashed through her exquisitely demure surface. Hitchcock searched far and wide for another blond star with the same balance of fire and ice and came the closest with Eva Marie Saint in ''North by Northwest.'' The archetype's enduring power is evident in January Jones's sleek Betty Draper Francis in ''Mad Men.'' Besides ''High Noon'' and ''Rear Window'' the series includes ''The Country Girl,'' for which Kelly won an Academy Award, beating out Judy Garland in a famous upset; ''High Society,'' ''Mogambo,'' ''The Swan,'' and her other great Hitchcock collaboration, ''To Catch a Thief.'' Rounding out the series is Henry Hathaway's obscure 1951 documentary-style drama, ''Fourteen Hours,'' in which she made her movie debut playing a tiny role.

2012-07-08T00:00:00Z,"OPENING on Thursday at the Whitney Museum of American Art, ''YAYOI KUSAMA'' gives contemporary art's reigning queen of obsessive, hallucinatory repetition the full retrospective treatment. Over six decades of making art in two countries (the United States and Japan) and in every conceivable medium, Ms. Kusama, 83, has ensnared viewers in her painted ''Infinity Nets,'' phallic soft-sculpture ''Accumulations'' and psychedelic fields of dots, where they are forced to confront some intense, discomfiting connections between abstraction and anxiety. As is well known in the art world Ms. Kusama has been living, voluntarily, in a mental institution since 1977. Less well known, these days, are her early performances and happenings, made during the 1960s and '70s, while she was sharing a loft with Donald Judd and keeping company with Warhol, Oldenburg and Joseph Cornell. The films and archival material in the Whitney show, which is arriving from the Tate Modern, should change that. Already on view in the lobby gallery, since June 13, is Ms. Kusama's installation ''Fireflies on the Water'' (2002). Owned by the Whitney, this popular piece (which will be familiar to visitors to the 2004 Whitney Biennial) uses water and mirrors to reflect 150 tiny hanging lights into seemingly infinite constellations.

For the souls of the hundreds buried in a long-vanished cemetery here, a Buddhist minister offered prayers and rang a bell, though its invocation was almost lost as a propeller plane took off from a nearby airfield. Nearly 400 Japanese-Americans journeyed from June 30 to July 3 to this remote corner of California, where 18,789 people of Japanese ancestry were incarcerated during World War II. The turnout was one of the highest ever for the four-day pilgrimage, which occurs every other year around the Fourth of July, organizers said.

2012-07-09T00:00:00Z,"Roger Waters projected his message stadium-wide, literally, when he brought his new production of ''The Wall'' to Yankee Stadium on Friday, starting a two-night stand. A white-brick wall, which is both an ideal video screen in concert and the central metaphor of the rock opera he wrote for the 1979 album by Pink Floyd (with additional music by the band's guitarist, David Gilmour), spanned the stadium and towered 40 feet high. The message Mr. Waters hammered home - with images including animated regiments of goose-stepping hammers on the march - was distrust of power and authority in many forms: parents, schools, celebrities, corporations, countries, ideologies. Throughout intermission (as elegiac music played), and at points during the concert, the names and faces of people killed by wars, terrorism and government actions were shown on the wall. Quotations from George Orwell, Franz Kafka and Dwight D. Eisenhower also appeared on it. At one point, animated bombers dropped corporate logos and religious symbols; ''Run Like Hell'' included a WikiLeaks video from an American helicopter firing on Iraqi journalists. Early in the concert, Mr. Waters deplored ''all the victims of state terror all over the world,'' and preached that giving governments, police and soldiers too much power was ''a very steep and slippery slope to tyranny.''"
2012-07-09T00:00:00Z,"6:05 P.M. (Cinemax) DIE HARD WITH A VENGEANCE (1995) Bruce Willis, left, starring once again as the-down-but-never-out cop John McClane, must stop another terrorist (Jeremy Irons) from destroying a public place. This time, however, Mr. Willis cannot get to the final ''yippee-ki-yay'' without some help from Samuel L. Jackson as Zeus Carver. The film leads its characters (and the viewer) on a dizzying tour of New York City during the mid-90s, from Harlem to Central Park and Wall Street and back up to Tompkins Square Park and the old Yankee Stadium. ''McClane and Zeus are plagued by fake bombs, real bombs and Simon's cadre of killers, not to mention cellular phones that suddenly go dead and really bad traffic on Ninth Avenue,'' Caryn James wrote in The New York Times. The film delivers, she added, ''pure action, with bigger and better explosions and stunts.'' 9:30 A.M. (AMC) RAY (2004) Jamie Foxx, right, won the best actor Oscar for his portrayal of the musician Ray Charles in this biopic directed by Taylor Hackford. A. O. Scott wrote in The Times that Mr. Foxx gave an ''inventive, intuitive and supremely intelligent performance.'' He added: ''He has mastered Charles's leg-swinging gait, his open-mouthed smile and the tilt of his head, as well as the speaking style that could sometimes sound like a form of scat singing. But there is much more than mimicry at work here.''"

Paul Tucker, a deputy governor at the Bank of England, will give evidence on whether senior government officials put pressure on Barclays to lower its submissions to the London interbank offered rate, or Libor. Barclays agreed in late June to pay some $450 million to settle accusations from United States and British authorities that its traders and senior executives had manipulated the rate, which underpins trillions of dollars of corporate loans, home mortgages and derivatives around the world."

2012-07-09T00:00:00Z,"WAKSMAN--Byron H.,M.D. A distinguished immunologist who pioneered the field of neuro-immunology, died on Sunday, June 17 in Lexington, Massachusetts. He was 92. Waksman graduated from Swarthmore College in 1940 and from the University of Pennsylvania Medical School in 1943. He went on to an academic career at both Harvard/ Mass General Hospital and at Yale School of Medicine. He began his research career investigating experimental allergic encephalomyelitis, an artificially induced condition resembling multiple sclerosis, and similar inflammatory diseases of the nervous system, which he termed ""auto-immune"" diseases. Waksman and his students demonstrated the role of the thymus in both immune responses and tissue-specific tolerance. They are also credited with discovering several of the first and most important cytokines and circulating lymphocytes known as T-cells. After retiring from academia, Waksman became vice president for research and medicine at the National Multiple Sclerosis Society, where he streamlined the granting process and improved communication between the board, patients and their families, and the media. One of his greatest achievements was to create a series of yearly workshops that brought together physicians and scientists involved with MS, from basic research to clinical treatments. These workshops and their published summaries successfully promoted cooperative work and moved the field of MS research and treatment forward substantially. Following his second retirement, Waksman taught middle school students at the Salk School of Science in New York, an experience that convinced him of the urgent need to improve science education at the pre-college level. For more than 30 years, Waksman directed the Foundation for Microbiology, established in 1951 by his father, Nobel Laureate Selman Waksman, using patent royalties from the production of streptomycin, the first antibiotic for the treatment of tuberculosis. During his tenure, Waksman focused on improving science communication of every kind. In 1985 he initiated the Science Journalism Program at the Marine Biological Laboratory in Woods Hole, MA, and later created a similar international journalism program (EICOS) at the Max Plank Institute in Munich. He also launched a decade-long K-12 science education initiative training classroom teachers to use hands-on microbiology exercises. Waksman travelled widely both professionally and for pleasure, and he spoke many foreign languages fluently. He was a visiting investigator and/or teacher in France, Britain, Germany, Brazil, Venezuela, and Senegal. From 1961 onward, he served almost continuously on advisory panels of various government agencies, the World Health Organization, and the Rockefeller Foundation, as well as on the editorial boards of scientific journals of immunology. Waksman published more than 350 papers and articles. Waksman's many colleagues, former students, and friends around the world cite his superlative teaching and the open, cooperative, and international atmosphere in his labs as his greatest legacy. Waksman is survived by his wife, Joyce; daughter, Nan Schanbacher; son, Peter; and five grandchildren. Memorial services will take place next summer in Woods Hole."

''People with osteoarthritis are relying more and more heavily on surgery,'' Dr. David T. Felson, a rheumatologist and epidemiologist at Boston University School of Medicine, told me. ''The rate of knee replacement is just skyrocketing, out of proportion to increases in arthritic changes seen on X-rays, and replacement surgery is contributing greatly to the rising costs of Medicare.''"

2012-07-10T00:00:00Z,"Methadone accounted for almost a third of the deaths caused by opioid pain relievers in 2009, even though it was prescribed far less often than other such drugs, government researchers have found. Researchers writing in last week's Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report crunched data from the National Vital Statistics System and the Drug Enforcement Administration. The rate of overdose deaths involving methadone in 2009 was more than five times the rate in 1999, they found. The drug accounted for 1.7 percent of the 257 million prescriptions written in 2009 for opioid pain relievers, but it was involved in 31.4 percent of overdose deaths and more than 40 percent of the deaths attributable to use of a single drug."

(IFC) THE PRESTIGE (2006) Rival magicians (Hugh Jackman and Christian Bale) in 19th-century London compete not only to see who is the greater trickster but also who can win the affection of their beautiful assistant (Scarlett Johansson, above with Mr. Jackman). Directed by Christopher Nolan and based on the novel by Christopher Priest, the movie also manages to weave a bit of reality into the mysticism with the inclusion of the inventor Nikola Tesla (David Bowie, in an inspired supporting turn). Writing in The New York Times, A. O. Scott called the film ''a triumph of gimmickry, a movie generous enough with its showmanship and sleight of hand to quiet the temptation to grumble about its lack of substance.'' He added: ''Maybe, in the end, it all makes sense. Or maybe convincing you that it does is just the last and cleverest of this movie's many sleights of hand.'' 6 P.M. (Showtime) THE SCHOOL OF ROCK (2003) Jack Black, below, stars as Dewey Finn, a broke musician who impersonates his friend to land a substitute teaching gig, in this comedy directed by Richard Linklater. When he discovers that his students possess some raw musical talent, he jumps at the chance to instill in them some good old-fashioned rock 'n' roll skill. Joan Cusack plays the well-intentioned yet tightly wound principal. Writing in The Times, Stephen Holden compared Mr. Black to other kings of comedy: ''Not since Jim Carrey twitched, mugged and leered his way to the head of the class has a comic actor stirred up such a gleeful furor on the screen. And not since John Belushi has one used the anarchic roar of rock as a conceptual platform.''"

2012-07-11T00:00:00Z,"Perhaps the most surprising aspect of the Libor scandal is how familiar it seems. Sure, for some of the world's leading banks to try to manipulate one of the most important interest rates in contemporary finance is clearly egregious. But is that worse than packaging billions of dollars worth of dubious mortgages into a bond and having it stamped with a Triple-A rating to sell to some dupe down the road while betting against it? Or how about forging documents on an industrial scale to foreclose fraudulently on countless homeowners? The misconduct of the financial industry no longer surprises most Americans. Only about one in five has much trust in banks, according to Gallup polls, about half the level in 2007. And it's not just banks that are frowned upon. Trust in big business overall is declining. Sixty-two percent of Americans believe corruption is widespread across corporate America. According to Transparency International, an anticorruption watchdog, nearly three in four Americans believe that corruption has increased over the last three years."

At 11:30 a.m., Part 2, the more sobering ''Guerrilla,'' follows Guevara's star-crossed attempt to ignite a popular uprising in Bolivia. Writing in The New York Times, A. O. Scott called Mr. Del Toro's performance ''technically flawless'' and infused with ''the full and considerable measure of his own charisma.'' He added: ''As history, though, 'Che' is finally not epic but romance. It takes great care to be true to the factual record, but it is, nonetheless, a fairy tale.''"

And as a trend, the color has acquired a real-life jump-start on the red carpet: Elizabeth Banks (near left) chose an embroidered dress from the Alexander McQueen prefall collection for a premiere; Chloë Grace Moretz (far left) wore a McQ dress from the fall runway at another; and Emma Stone (center) chose a regal Rochas for her ''Spider-Man'' tour.

2012-07-12T00:00:00Z,"This year marks the 100th anniversary of the birth of Gordon Parks, the renowned photographer, writer and filmmaker. Beginning Thursday, the Schomburg Center for Research in Black Culture in New York is commemorating the centennial with an exhibition of 100 of his images from six decades, several on public display for the first time. The exhibition, called ''Gordon Parks: 100 Moments,'' includes some of Mr. Parks's more famous work, including ''American Gothic, Washington, D.C.,'' which depicts a black cleaning woman standing in front of an American flag, a broom in one hand and a mop in the background. The photographs getting a new airing are of children in Harlem in the 1940s, before Mr. Parks, who was born on Nov. 30, 1912, became famous. He died in 2006 at 93 and lived in New York for many years. The free exhibition, at 515 Malcolm X Boulevard, in Harlem, continues through Dec. 1.

''I had a few keys words written down to insure myself that I wouldn't mess up,'' he posted on Twitter on Wednesday, saying he wanted to explain his performance. ''I just wanted to do my best.

Meanwhile, Jimmy Connors, McEnroe's former playing rival and his partner and foil in the BBC's acrimonious Wimbledon booth for three years, took to social media to share his analysis of the tournament. The ironyshould not be lost on anyone. For if Jimmy Connors is known for something (besides, perhaps, the best return of serve in tennis history), it is that he has never been the most sociable guy in the room.

''We are struggling with the live music issue,'' he said. ''We have not given up on it, but it is a cash issue. We have yet to find the numbers to make that happen.'' Last season's performances without live music drew objections from the musicians' union. Mr. Tomlinson said the run would include new works; Mr. Taylor's ''Sacre du Printemps (The Rehearsal),'' based on the Stravinsky composition that is marking the 100th year since its premiere; and a discounted ticket evening of two 25-year-old Taylor pieces, ''Speaking in Tongues'' and ''Brandenburgs.''

2012-07-12T00:00:00Z,"7:30 P.M. (Showtime) THE HELP (2011) Skeeter (Emma Stone), an aspiring writer from a prominent family in early 1960s Mississippi, causes an uproar in her community when she interviews black female servants in this adaptation of the Kathryn Stockett novel, directed and written by Tate Taylor. Viola Davis earned a best actress Oscar nomination for her portrayal of Aibileen, a maid who has raised several of the town's white babies. Octavia Spencer (above right, with Ms. Davis) won for best supporting actress as Aibileen's best friend, Minny, who endures soul-killing work for Hilly (Bryce Dallas Howard), a housewife who believes in white superiority. And Cicely Tyson is Constantine, the woman who raised Skeeter -- and who inspires her former charge's journey of discovery. Writing in The New York Times, Manohla Dargis called this best picture nominee a ''big, ole slab of honey-glazed hokum.'' The movie's ''vision of a divided America that while consistently insulting and sometimes even terrifying, is rarely grotesque, despite Hilly's best (worst) segregationist efforts,'' she added. ''Inside all these different homes, black and white women tend to the urgent matters of everyday life, like the care and feeding of children. And while every so often the roar of the outside world steals in like thunder, Mr. Taylor makes sure it doesn't rattle the china or your soul.'' 8 P.M. (HBO) SOMETHING BORROWED (2011) Ginnifer Goodwin stars as Rachel, a New York lawyer who imagines herself a wallflower until, on her 30th birthday, she finally ends up in bed with her longtime crush, Dex (Colin Egglesfield). Kate Hudson is Darcy, a brassy blond bombshell and Rachel's lifelong best friend -- and the woman Dex happens to be engaged to. ''The contrast between Darcy and Rachel is a bit overdrawn, but it should have given the conflict between them at least a hint of comic snap,'' A. O. Scott wrote in The Times about this film, adapted by Luke Greenfield from the novel by Emily Giffin. ''And the premise should have been a surefire recipe for farce, especially when everyone piles into a summer share in the Hamptons.'' Why this film ''should be so cautious and tepid,'' Mr. Scott said, ''is a puzzle.''"

Why the W? In the early '90s the building was home to Club USA, a megaclub designed by Jean Paul Gaultier and run by Peter Gatien, the former New York nightlife impresario who also owned the Limelight, the Tunnel and the Palladium. Club USA, whose décor played on the theme of a gritty, bygone Times Square, was filled on many nights with club kids and drag queens. Its Sunday-night party, Bump, was popular with gay men. The club closed in 1994, and W turned it into a hotel in 2001."

He leaves behind his devoted children, Andrew, James and Margaret and his grandchildren, Rebecca, Rachel, Abigail and Alexander. As chairman and chief executive of Bloomingdale's, Marvin was one of the great merchants and retailers of his day, widely admired, honored and copied. But what was perhaps more remarkable is that he achieved his extraordinary success without ever making an enemy or speaking ill of a rival. He was an unfailingly gracious and generous man who didn't have a mean bone in his body. He was optimistic to a fault, and a font of enthusiasm. His favorite word was ""marvelous."" Marvin was born in New York City and graduated from DeWitt Clinton High School. He enlisted in the Army, and was wounded during action outside Metz. His doctors feared that he would never walk again, but after more than a year of intense therapy, Marvin regained full mobility and never walked with a limp. He was awarded the Purple Heart and three Bronze Battle Stars, and was later given the keys to the city of Metz. After graduating from Harvard in 1947, Marvin enrolled at Harvard Business School and graduated in the famous class of 1949. He met Lee, a student of modern dance and a Smith College student, in 1947, and they married on September 2, 1948. He went to work at Bloomingdale's and rose rapidly up the executive ladder, becoming CEO in 1978. Under his tenure, Bloomingdale's became a cultural mecca; he helped turn retailing into a form of theatre and entertainment. One of the hallmarks of Marvin's career was mentoring many executives who went on to become department store CEOs, as well as hiring, supporting and promoting many women executives. Retiring from Bloomingdale's at age 66, Marvin was ready for another career. For the next 21 years, he ran Marvin Traub Associates, working with many of the designers he had known for so many years as well as retailers and developers all over the world. Marvin loved his life; and ""working,"" for him, was another word for ""living."" Marvin was deeply involved with a wide range of charities and institutions, including Harvard, where he and Lee sponsored scholarships for middle-income students. He and Lee were the center of each other's lives. Marvin was terrifically proud of everything his children accomplished. He was a loving and attentive father-in-law to Lois Traub, Elizabeth Easton and Phyllis Dicker. He considered almost everyone he ever met a friend--and the feeling was mutual. In lieu of flowers, donations may be sent to the Marvin and Lee Traub Flexible Financial Aid Fund at Harvard, or to Pin Down Bladder Cancer. A funeral service will be held at Central Synagogue at 10am on Sunday, July 15."

Justin Timberlake plays Will, who has managed to add three years to his life, only to watch the cost of breathing keep going up. Matt Bomer is Henry Hamilton, a rich 105-year-old stranger who transfers a century to Will, thus ending his own life. Amanda Seyfried, above with Mr. Timberlake, is Sylvia, a babe whose father (Vincent Kartheiser, of ''Mad Men'') helps control the global time market. And Cillian Murphy is the head of the policelike Timekeepers, who blame Will for Henry's death. ''There's plenty to enjoy about that genre standard, which, with the help of the cinematographer Roger Deakins (shooting in digital), Mr. Niccol transforms into a neonoir gaudily washed in green and gold,'' Manohla Dargis wrote of what she called ''a couple-on-the-run flick'' in The New York Times. ''But then the characters open their mouths and start going on about minutes and hours, clocks and watches, and their time running out and not having enough time, and where's my time, don't waste my time, that time will get you killed, brother can you spare some time because, well, I'm all out.'' 10:30 A.M.

2012-07-15T00:00:00Z,"McCALL--James Wilson James Wilson McCall, of Hillsborough, California, on July 13, 2012, after a courageous struggle with cancer. Jim was the beloved husband of Jennifer Jordan McCall; devoted father of Peter Lewis Livingston McCall and Andrew James McCall; stepfather of Caroline Debevoise Clark and Hillary Sage Clark; son of Lewis Livingston McCall, Jr. and Dixann Wilson McCall; and brother of Mary Margaret McCall. Jim was knowledgeable in many subjects from sports, to history, politics, photography, music and Formula 1 racing. Jim was an avid reader, particularly of American history and international relations. Jim was always fun to be with. An entertaining conversationalist, Jim's wit and humor will be deeply missed. His family and friends admired him greatly for his insight and sensitivity, and for his thoughtfulness, modesty and courage. Jim set an example with his intellectual curiosity, dynamic yet gentlemanly manner and high moral character. He was a trusted advisor to many, and a loyal friend. Jim especially enjoyed advising his four children, and was proud that all four of them attended Princeton University. Jim took special pride in his sons and their accomplishments, both in sports and academics. Born in Norman, Oklahoma March 10, 1953, Jim graduated from the University of Oklahoma in 1974 with a B.A. in Letters with Honors, in History, Philosophy and English. Jim completed his undergraduate degree in five semesters, was a member of Phi Beta Kappa and was a Rhodes Scholar nominee from the State of Oklahoma. Jim earned a J.D. from the University of Oklahoma in 1977, where he was a member of the Law Review. In 1974 Jim attended Oxford University as a Scholarship Resident at University College in Economics. Jim earned his M.B.A. in 1984 from Harvard Business School and served as a member of the Faculty Judicial Review Board. Jim's work experience included McKinsey, Goldman Sachs and Security Pacific/Bank of America Venture Capital Group. Jim joined Intel Corporation in Santa Clara, California in 1997 where he remained to the present. He became an Assistant Treasurer for Mergers, Acquisitions & Strategic Investments and Managing Director, Digital Enterprise and Digital Home for Intel Capital Corporation, the venture capital arm of Intel. Jim was a talented athlete and sports enthusiast throughout his life. As a thirteen-year-old, Jim shot even par in a golf tournament; in high school he played football, golf and ran track, holding the State of Oklahoma record for the 220- and 440-yard dash. At the University of Oklahoma Jim played golf and followed professional baseball. Jim's love of golf stayed with him throughout his life. Jim was a member of the San Francisco Golf Club and Burlingame Country Club, San Francisco, the Merion Golf Club, Ardmore, Pennsylvania and The Creek Club, Locust Valley, New York. Jim's family and friends loved to play golf with him, not only because of his entertaining and friendly manner, but also because of his shot-making finesse. Jim gently offered tips to those who requested them, and was always a patient teacher. Jim was keenly devoted to his family and to the memory of his predecessors. Jim was a proud member of The Society of the Cincinnati, whose members are descendants of the Officers who served in General George Washington's Revolutionary Army. He belonged to The Society of Colonial Wars, The General Society Sons of the American Revolution, The Order of St. John of Jerusalem, the General Society of the War of 1812, the Order of Indian Wars of the United States, and the Aztec Club of 1847 Military Society of the Mexican War. Jim's warmth, enthusiasm, and intellect will be greatly missed. A memorial service will be held on Tuesday, July 17, 2012 at 4:00 p.m. at First Presbyterian Church of Burlingame, 1500 Easton Drive, Burlingame, CA 94010.

It is named after Abdi Ipekci, a Turkish journalist assassinated here in 1979 by Mehmet Agca, who later tried to kill Pope John Paul II; a memorial marks the spot where Mr. Ipekci was gunned down. Today, though, Istanbul's fashion set flocks to the international names on the street, including Prada, Cartier and Louis Vuitton.

2012-07-15T00:00:00Z,"The story of Alex White and his involvement in the Kathryn Johnston incident underscores a history of questionable behavior from the city's police force. As an Atlanta native, I think of the raid on the Atlanta Eagle nightclub, where patrons were illegally detained, and of the visiting college professor, Felipe Fernández-Armesto, who was manhandled and then incarcerated after being stopped for jaywalking in the downtown area. It is unfortunate that an international city with aspirations for education, business and the arts will not address the issue of an undisciplined and overly aggressive police force that includes corrupt individuals. Cities like Atlanta should open themselves to scrutiny and exhibit the will to right problems within the system. CAMERON KENNEDY, Atlanta"

''It was in pretty rough shape.'' Since then, she has documented an overhaul that has attracted international notice and reclaimed Central Park as the lungs of the city, the people's backyard and a tourist destination. The conservancy has raised hundreds of millions of dollars from residents, corporations and foundations, and has restored bridges and buildings, gardens and lawns, fountains and monuments.

In ''CAROL CHANNING: LARGER THAN LIFE,'' Monday at 6:30 p.m. on Showtime, the filmmaker Dori Berinstein worships at the altar of the theatrical funny girl, now 91, who soared to stardom in 1949 as the diamond-loving Lorelei Lee in ''Gentlemen Prefer Blondes'' and performed her signature role, the widowed matchmaker Dolly Levi, which she originated in the Broadway hit ''Hello, Dolly!,'' more than 5,000 times. The documentary also chronicles the genesis of the public persona -- a madcap human bobblehead doll with saucer eyes fringed in fake lashes, outsized lips and a megawatt smile, and that voice, somewhere between Betty Boop and a fog horn -- that spawned a thousand imitators. ''You're the best Carol Channing I've ever seen,'' a stranger once told her, assuming she was a drag queen, before asking who she really was. ''A truck driver from Toledo,'' came Ms. Channing's reply."

2012-07-15T00:00:00Z,"As night falls, I watch from the window as flashes from Tuskar Rock Lighthouse become visible. It does its two flashes and then stops as though to take a breath. Until I was 12 and my family stopped coming to this remote place on the coast of Ireland in the summer, I watched the lighthouse too, from a different window not far from here. Every day now as I walk down to the strand I pass the house we lived in then. Someone else is there now, but no matter what happens, the room that I can almost peer into from the lane remains my parents' bedroom, with the iron bed and the cement floor. I suppose it must seem smaller now that I am bigger. And the smell of clover in the field before the cliff is the same smell, although it must be different clover. Maybe the smell is similar and not the same, but because I am trying all day to dream that world of 1967 into existence, it is sometimes closer now than it ever was."

At age ninety-nine, she died as she lived: with courage and grace. She was unique among art dealers in the courage with which she defended the artistic approach about which she was most passionate. She helped introduce the vision of Arp, Le Corbusier, Anni Albers, and Josef Albers to the French public in her two galleries in Paris, and, when she had a gallery in New York, was the first to present the work of many European geometric abstractionists in the United States. She was a splendid and loyal friend, and a woman of profound human insight. She hosted a meeting of the Resistance, with Sartre attending, in 1943 in the middle of Paris, determining that no one would suspect such an event in her gallery on the rue La Boetie because the neighborhood was so heavily occupied by German soldiers; she never lost her bravery or panache. We loved her deeply. Nicholas Fox Weber, Executive Director; his wife Katharine and daughters Lucy and Charlotte; Brenda Danilowitz, Chief Curator"

2012-07-15T00:00:00Z,"IN 1980 the director Francis Ford Coppola -- having weathered the logistical ordeal of shooting ''Apocalypse Now'' in the Philippines -- was ready for a change. His next project, '' ONE FROM THE HEART'' (1982), playing Sunday at the Museum of the Moving Image as part of its indispensable See It Big! series, was a complete reversal: a deliriously fantastical confection, evoking MGM musicals and reveling in studio artifice. The production designer Dean Tavoularis recreated a glittering Las Vegas Strip; the brilliant Vittorio Storaro (''The Conformist'') was the cinematographer; Kenny Ortega (''High School Musical'') choreographed dance sequences; Tom Waits sang with Crystal Gayleon the soundtrack and composed the lush, Oscar-nominated score. The story -- a working-class couple (Teri Garr and Frederic Forrest) bicker and separate (naturally, it's Independence Day), then reconsider -- may be thin. But Ms. Garr, Raul Julia (as a dashing Latin lover) and Nastassja Kinski (as a beguiling circus acrobat) are in top form. Audiences stayed away, evidently not in a romantic mood.

2012-07-15T00:00:00Z,"AT least since 1998, when the United States Olympic Committee first approached sportswear companies to liven up the look of its team, American athletes have worn ceremonial outfits that were manufactured in places far from home. For a decade, almost everything they wore to represent the United States at the opening and closing ceremonies was actually being designed and produced in Canada, by the sportswear company Roots, until the American company Ralph Lauren won those rights in 2008. But an ABC News report this week that pointed out that the Ralph Lauren uniforms the athletes will wear in London, for the ceremonies on July 27, are made in China has prompted an unusual degree of outrage, at least in Congress. Senator Harry Reid, the Democratic majority leader, said on Thursday, ''I think they should take all the uniforms, put them in a big pile and burn them and start all over again.''"

Readers responded to that column and to the cover article, ''He Takes the Village,'' Rebecca Flint Marx's profile of Ben Shaoul, a controversial landlord and real estate developer particularly active in the East Village, on NYTimes.com. A selection of their comments is below. Yes, riding the No. 6 at rush hour ... but not going to work. Taking a drawing class because, as all know, that is what we do when we first arrive in town. A town house in the West Village or a loft in TriBeCa, but two examples of affluent life in the big town. I love the tourists, save those who seem to walk five in a row somewhere on Broadway in the 40s. I love them spending their money, shopping at local businesses and getting out of here. But please spare me that any of the above is ''experiential'' New York living.

2012-07-15T00:00:00Z,"In December 1944, Albert Camus, then editor of Combat, the main newspaper of the French Resistance, made Jean-Paul Sartre an offer he couldn't refuse: the job of American correspondent. Sartre, who had long dreamed about the United States, was delighted to get out of post-Liberation Paris. Camus himself would make the trip soon after, only to return with a characteristically different set of political, philosophical and personal impressions. Both would be kept under close surveillance by the F.B.I., who naturally suspected all philosophers of being subversives. In some sense, existentialism was going home. Twentieth-century French philosophy was not immune to the metaphysical turmoil of the United States at the end of the 19th century. More significantly, both Camus and Sartre had borrowed from 20th-century writers like Faulkner, Hemingway and Dos Passos -- and, of course, from the films of Humphrey Bogart. Camus, in particular, cultivated the trench coat with the upturned collar."

2012-07-15T00:00:00Z,"BIANCHI--Richard, ""Dick"". A prolific Production Designer/Art Director for television and film, died at his home in Connecticut on June 30th. The cause was Multiple Myeloma. He was 84 years old. Born in Somerville, MA, he graduated from Arlington High School, and pursued an interest in art to the Massachusetts College of Art and Design, graduating with a BFA in 1950. After teaching for two months in Concord, NH, he went to Korea with the 45th Infantry Division, and went on to work in Military Government. On the G.I. Bill, he attended Tufts University, graduating with a Master's of Education in Arts and Sciences. Art won over education and, thanks to a mentor in the Tufts Theater Department, he went on to the Yale School of Drama. He graduated with an MFA in 1957, becoming a member of the United Scenic Artists Union that same year. Other than erasing Uncle Wethbee's drawings and weather reports from a board used on air the night before, little is known about his first job at NBC, including the game show ""Haggis Baggis"". Over the next ten years, he designed many Off-Broadway plays, as well as countless television commercials. One of his last being Cora's Country Store for Maxwell House Coffee, with Margaret Hamilton. In 1969, he designed his first feature film ""Puzzle of a Downfall Child"", with Faye Dunaway, followed by ""Voices"" with Amy Irving, and was the New York Art Director for Lady Liberty, with Sophia Loren. Some of his movies for TV were ""Skokie"", with Danny Kaye, ""The Deadliest Season"", with Michael Moriarty, and two Kojak Specials, with Telly Savalis. His series for television included ""The Bloodhound Gang"", three episodes for the CBS series ""The American Parade"", ""Nurse"", with Michael Learned and ""The Equalizer"", with Edward Woodward. During a break in that show's third season, he was asked to do a pilot for CBS called ""Law and Order"". Two years later, it began shooting for NBC, which he designed for the next six years. His love of opera took him to San Francisco to design Mozart's ""Marriage of Figaro"", and his love of painting found him on the coast of Maine for a month every year in the summer. As work kept interrupting these interludes, he finally built a year-round cottage by the sea on an island near Boothbay Harbor. He is survived by his brother and sister-in-law Robert and Erika Bianchi, a niece, Jane Bianchi, and his wife, Maeve McGuire. Gifts may be made in his name to The Massachusetts College of Art and Design, 621 Huntington Ave., Boston, MA 02115, or The Yale School of Drama P. O. Box 208244, New Haven, CT., 06520."

2012-07-15T00:00:00Z,"TRAUB--Marvin, died peacefully at home on July 11. He was 87. He and his wife Lee were married for 63 cloudless years. He leaves behind his devoted children, Andrew, James and Margaret and his grandchildren, Rebecca, Rachel, Abigail and Alexander. As chairman and chief executive of Bloomingdale's, Marvin was one of the great merchants and retailers of his day, widely admired, honored and copied. But what was perhaps more remarkable is that he achieved his extraordinary success without ever making an enemy or speaking ill of a rival. He was an unfailingly gracious and generous man who didn't have a mean bone in his body. He was optimistic to a fault, and a font of enthusiasm. His favorite word was ""marvelous."" Marvin was born in New York City and graduated from DeWitt Clinton High School. He enlisted in the Army, and was wounded during action outside Metz. His doctors feared that he would never walk again, but after more than a year of intense therapy, Marvin regained full mobility and never walked with a limp. He was awarded the Purple Heart and three Bronze Battle Stars, and was later given the keys to the city of Metz. After graduating from Harvard in 1947, Marvin enrolled at Harvard Business School and graduated in the famous class of 1949. He met Lee, a student of modern dance and a Smith College student, in 1947, and they married on September 2, 1948. He went to work at Bloomingdale's and rose rapidly up the executive ladder, becoming CEO in 1978. Under his tenure, Bloomingdale's became a cultural mecca; he helped turn retailing into a form of theatre and entertainment. One of the hallmarks of Marvin's career was mentoring many executives who went on to become department store CEOs, as well as hiring, supporting and promoting many women executives. Retiring from Bloomingdale's at age 66, Marvin was ready for another career. For the next 21 years, he ran Marvin Traub Associates, working with many of the designers he had known for so many years as well as retailers and developers all over the world. Marvin loved his life; and ""working,"" for him, was another word for ""living."" Marvin was deeply involved with a wide range of charities and institutions, including Harvard, where he and Lee sponsored scholarships for middle-income students. He and Lee were the center of each other's lives. Marvin was terrifically proud of everything his children accomplished. He was a loving and attentive father-in-law to Lois Traub, Elizabeth Easton and Phyllis Dicker. He considered almost everyone he ever met a friend--and the feeling was mutual. In lieu of flowers, donations may be sent to the Marvin and Lee Traub Flexible Financial Aid Fund at Harvard, or to Pin Down Bladder Cancer. A funeral service will be held at Central Synagogue at 10am on Sunday, July 15."

''There is a long tradition of great artists working as art handlers,'' said David Zwirner, citing Jason Rhodes, Damien Hirst and Rirkrit Tiravanija. Mr. Zwirner has long wanted to do a show curated from within the gallery's ranks and believed that they had reached a critical mass of talent. ''I'm just glad I didn't have to pick,'' he said. Those honors went to Chris Rawson and James Morrill, the founders of Rawson Projects in Greenpoint, Brooklyn. Mr. Rawson is the archivist for Zwirner, and Mr. Morrill does the gallery's books. While the two did not have a specific aesthetic agenda, they insist that the show was not curated democratically. They set up an open call to the staff for submissions, and only artists with a rigorous working practice could apply. The work cuts across all media, from sound and video to painting and photography, and yet it all ultimately hangs together.

She is represented by the Adamson Gallery in Washington, D.C. She was born in Troy, New York on November 20, 1923, daughter of Catherine Looby and Timothy J. Buckley. Shortly thereafter, her parents moved to the Buckley Ancestral Home Altmar, New York. She was a 1946 graduate of the college of Saint Rose in Albany, NY. Her yearbook described her as ""pensive, dreamy...an artist's artist...clever, poetic Cathy"". In 1945, she lived in Mexico City and studied art at the University of Mexico. On October 7, 1961, she married Nicholas Arcomano, a New York copyright attorney, at The Lady Chapel in St. Patrick's Cathedral. They celebrated their 50th anniversary at the cathedral last year. After her marriage, she attended the New School in New York City and was awarded the first prize for painting in 1974. In 2010, she and her husband established the Cathryn Buckley Arcomano Lectureship Series in contemporary art at the College of Saint Rose.

Its performance at the 2011 MTV Movie Awards was a bit -- shall we say? -- unfocused. It was something like watching icebergs shear off into the sea with a huge splash, a combination of wow and oh dear. In 2010 Young the Giant released its self-titled debut album (on Roadrunner), and it's been oozing along under its own steam, every now and again squeezing out a single -- a couple, like ''Cough Syrup,'' sticky and great -- slowly earning its keep. But the truth is this: Of bands with that absurd name structure, of newish major-label rock bands, of bands who crib shamelessly from the mopers of the late 1980s and early 1990s, Young the Giant is one of the finest. The Smiths and the Cure bubble up through this band's slick, downcast arrangements, which at their most polished recall the Killers, and at their most scuffed, suggest the Walkmen with a bigger budget. And obstacles be damned, it's working: the group's built enough momentum to headline SummerStage.

Often regaling his children with Runyonesque tales of his West Side childhood, he witnessed the building of the George Washington Bridge and he played street baseball with neighborhood boys. Babe Ruth tossed an occasional ball with them. Always a rascal, David once happened upon New York City Police routing a gang; he stayed to watch the firefight. However, he neglected to mention this to his parents who later saw a newspaper photo of the raid; young David was perched just outside of the line of fire. David attended the University of Illinois and served in the US Army during WWII. He co-founded Timpson, Kramer and Crane, a successful food brokerage business in the mid-60s. A lifelong Republican, he was surrounded by a family of staunch Democrats, providing fodder for his love of boisterous political argument. Above all else, David valued family, friends and a good party. When his final illness robbed him of his voice, he joined in a raucous dinner by whispering a joke to one of his daughters line by line so that she could broadcast it to the clan. His beloved wife, Carol, his daughters, Susan Crane (Terry Etapa), Andrea Crane-Rabe, and Nancy Crane (Tom Butler), his brother Gerald (Joan), his grandsons Eric and Dan Rabe (Paula), and numerous nephews and nieces survive him. When asked what he wanted his obituary to say David retorted: ""Tell anyone who owes me money to send it to Carol."""
