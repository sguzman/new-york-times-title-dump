2008-04-15T00:00:00Z,"The return of “Desperate Housewives” lifted ABC to No. 1 in the ratings on Sunday, as 16 million viewers tuned in at 9 p.m., Eastern and Pacific times, for the first new episode of the series since early January, Nielsen reported. Despite delivering the series’s lowest ratings to date among adults 18 to 49, “Desperate Housewives” still easily led the night in that demographic. Rounding out ABC’s schedule were “Oprah’s Big Give” at 8 (8.9 million) and “Eli Stone” at 10 (9.2 million). CBS, runner-up to ABC in the 18-to-49 set, tied for first in total viewers thanks to an overrun of its afternoon “Masters” golf coverage well into the 7 o’clock hour, followed by “60 Minutes,” which attracted roughly 11 million viewers. NBC and Fox finished in a virtual tie for third, although Fox fared better in the 18-to-49 age group, as new episodes of “The Simpsons” at 8 (6.9 million) and “King of the Hill” at 8:30 (6 million) drew particularly strong ratings in that demographic."

He attended Richmond Hill High School and the University of Rochester as a Naval cadet. He served in the U.S. Navy during World War Two as a Specialist for Welfare and Recreation and was the organist for all chapel activities at the U.S. Naval Base in Little Creek, Maryland. Subsequent to his naval service he was employed in the family business in New York City, then known as the United Paste and Glue Company. Along with his father, Herman C. Loderhose, he built United into the national adhesive manufacturer called United Resin Products, Inc. He was a gifted CEO, master salesman, and innovator in packaging patents, coatings and adhesives. In 1997, Mr. Loderhose sold United to the Henkel Corporation and remained with Henkel for the next four years as a senior director of the company. Mr. Loderhose had a lifelong passion for music, particularly the theatre organ. He was well known for his preservation, restoration, perfor mance, and support of the instrument. The gem of his extensive collection being the 55 rank New York Paramount Studio Theatre Organ, until recently located at the family owned Bay Theatre in Seal Beach, California. In June, 2007, Mr. Loderhose gifted this magnificent instrument to The Beatitudes Campus in Phoenix, Arizona where it is being reinstalled for the enjoyment of the residents, members, congregants, staff and the entire Phoenix and theatre organ community. He was a past president and founding member of the American Theatre Organ Society. He played the organ professionally under the name Dick Scott and made numerous recordings for his own label, Renwick Recordings, Inc. as well as for United Artists Records. An avid yachtsman, Mr. Loderhose also had a great passion for World War Two Air Sea Rescue boats. He refurbished and restored numerous rescue/crash boats during his lifetime (Music Man I through VI) and was often a speaker at events sponsored by crash boat organizations throughout the country. His philanthropy included the donation of a restored 64 foot rescue boat to the Sea Scouts of Marina Del Rey, California. When Mr. Loderhose retired from the glue business in 1997 he spent most of his remaining years in Newport Beach, California attending to his yachting and musical interests. He was a member of the Balboa Bay Club, Newport Beach, California. His final years were spent in Tampa, Florida. He is at rest now knowing that whatever his passion, he succeeded. He would want everyone to know that he truly had a ball and would go out playing ''Ain't Misbehavin'' or ''Anchors Away'' if he could; and those who knew him would agree. Life was good. He dearly loved his family and friends and was grateful for the life he led. He is survived by his daughters, Rena L. Singer and her husband Joel B. Singer, Mari J. Galloway and her husband, Michael G. Galloway; six grandchildren, Beryl, Garrett and Lindsay Firestone and Robin, Adam and Shannon Galloway, his loving sister, Grace E. Kerr, and former wife, Marie Tepper. Remembered lovingly by his first wife, and lifelong friend, the late Jane D. Loderhose.

Representatives for the group indicated, however, that they were planning to spend only about $250,000 initially, a relatively small amount. Although the group has been actively soliciting individual donors, the money for the commercials comes mostly from two unions that have endorsed Mrs. Clinton, the American Federation of State, County and Municipal Employees and the Machinists Union. As a ''527,'' one of the groups thus designated because of the part of the tax code they fall under, the American Leadership Project is barred from coordinating with the Clinton campaign and cannot explicitly call for Mrs. Clinton's election. But with Senator Barack Obama spending more than twice as much on advertising in Pennsylvania so far, according to the latest figures from the Campaign Media Analysis Group, which tracks advertising spending, Mrs. Clinton could clearly use the help in getting her message out on the airwaves."

In 1997, Mr. Loderhose sold United to the Henkel Corporation and remained with Henkel for the next four years as a senior director of the company. Mr. Loderhose had a lifelong passion for music, particularly the theatre organ. He was well known for his preservation, restoration, perfor mance, and support of the instrument. The gem of his extensive collection being the 55 rank New York Paramount Studio Theatre Organ, until recently located at the family owned Bay Theatre in Seal Beach, California. In June, 2007, Mr. Loderhose gifted this magnificent instrument to The Beatitudes Campus in Phoenix, Arizona where it is being reinstalled for the enjoyment of the residents, members, congregants, staff and the entire Phoenix and theatre organ community. He was a past president and founding member of the American Theatre Organ Society. He played the organ professionally under the name Dick Scott and made numerous recordings for his own label, Renwick Recordings, Inc. as well as for United Artists Records. An avid yachtsman, Mr. Loderhose also had a great passion for World War Two Air Sea Rescue boats. He refurbished and restored numerous rescue/crash boats during his lifetime (Music Man I through VI) and was often a speaker at events sponsored by crash boat organizations throughout the country. His philanthropy included the donation of a restored 64 foot rescue boat to the Sea Scouts of Marina Del Rey, California. When Mr. Loderhose retired from the glue business in 1997 he spent most of his remaining years in Newport Beach, California attending to his yachting and musical interests. He was a member of the Balboa Bay Club, Newport Beach, California. His final years were spent in Tampa, Florida. He is at rest now knowing that whatever his passion, he succeeded. He would want everyone to know that he truly had a ball and would go out playing ''Ain't Misbehavin'' or ''Anchors Away'' if he could; and those who knew him would agree. Life was good. He dearly loved his family and friends and was grateful for the life he led. He is survived by his daughters, Rena L. Singer and her husband Joel B. Singer, Mari J. Galloway and her husband, Michael G. Galloway; six grandchildren, Beryl, Garrett and Lindsay Firestone and Robin, Adam and Shannon Galloway, his loving sister, Grace E. Kerr, and former wife, Marie Tepper. Remembered lovingly by his first wife, and lifelong friend, the late Jane D. Loderhose. Donations can be made to the American Theatre Organ Society, or the charity of your choice in his memory. Memorial service to take place at Prince of Peace Lutheran Church in Phoenix, Arizona on Saturday, April 19, 2008 at 2pm. Marsicano-B. Marion Reed-Stowers Funeral Home."

And I have to say Senator Clinton looked in her element,"" Mr. Obama said. ""She was taking every opportunity to get a dig in there. You know, that's all right. That's her right.

2008-04-17T13:11:44Z,"In the summer of 2005, Mark Warner, then Virginia's governor and a likely candidate for president, was the honored guest at a meeting of liberal donors just north of San Francisco-the same kind of crowd to whom Barack Obama was talking last week when he made his comments about bitterness, guns and religion. On that night, Mr. Warner proudly rose to make his case for why his success in Virginia could translate into Democratic success in other rural states, and to explain how he had improved schools and local economies in the state's forgotten mining towns. But to his frustration, the donors were far more concerned about his stands on social issues - why he had capitulated to rural voters by embracing gun rights and parental notifications for abortions. At the end of the evening, as one of the donors pushed him further on abortion, Mr. Warner finally lost his cool. ""This is why America hates Democrats,"" he blurted before he drove away."

If you haven’t seen it, AT&T Park is one of those overpraised retro chic palaces that was built, I suppose, to transport the paying customer back to that quaint time when all our ballparks were outfitted with 80-foot Coke bottles and ye olde Wi-fi. (Perhaps I’m being unfair. The stadium has plenty to recommend it. I hear they serve an excellent Sterling Vintners Collection Chardonnay.) Which is to say, you shouldn’t go to AT&T Park, or any ballpark for that matter, expecting an honest reckoning with history. But the Giants’ purge of Bonds -- from a stadium designed expressly for his game, no less -- was something else entirely. It was a fitting tribute, if not to Bonds, then to the most insecure and insufferable franchise this side of Yawkey Way."

The state had appropriated $472 million for the fiscal year ending June 30, but enrollment in the state&#8217;s subsidized insurance programs for low- and middle-income workers exceeded expectations.

Cyndi Roy, a spokeswoman for Mr. Patrick, a Democrat, said this year&#8217;s shortfall would be offset by surplus revenues in the state&#8217;s general fund.

2008-04-17T00:00:00Z,"WHILE protective gear for the martial arts is nothing new, lately one piece of equipment has become more common. In the last two years, two martial arts associations have mandated the use of face shields attached to headgear during tournament sparring to protect noses and eyes. The North American Sport Karate Association, the host of a dozen open tournaments in North America annually, requires athletes under age 18 to wear them, while the American Taekwondo Association (ATA), which has 1,500 schools worldwide, specifies their use for all ages. ''It's like wearing a seatbelt, a preventive measure,'' said Jay Kohl, the ATA's international chairman of tournaments.Not every martial arts federation requires them. Notably absent is the World Taekwondo Federation, recognized as the sport's governing body by the International Olympic Committee. ''The face shields pose a risk of no clear vision,'' said Ji Ho Choi, the president of the Pan American Taekwondo Union, one of the regional taekwondo organizations of the World Taekwondo Federation. Face shield makers prefer clear plastic as a material, because it is transparent and lighter than older-style wire cages. The shields are attached to headgear with Velcro straps and sit off the face for ventilation. Christina Park, 27 and a third-degree black belt, tested four face shields at West Side Taekwondo in New York, where she is an instructor. Ranked by USA Taekwondo, one of the regional taekwondo organizations of the World Taekwondo Federation, she is a two-time national middleweight sparring champion and does not regularly use shields, only headgear. She preferred one-piece shields free of vented cutouts, which she said impeded her vision. By YISHANE LEE"

2008-04-17T00:00:00Z,"KIMMEL--Martin S. The American Jewish Committee profoundly mourns the death of our beloved friend and extraordinarily generous benefactor, Martin Kimmel, to whom we owe an enormous debt of gratitude. Marty was an AJC Honorary Vice President and, along with his cherished wife, Helen, a member of our National Leadership Council. We were proud to pay tribute to him in 2005 with our most prestigious honor our Herbert H. Lehman Human Relations Award. In January 2008, through a major gift, we established the Helen and Martin Kimmel Young Leadership Institute, allowing AJC to more energetically and creatively engage and train emerging Jewish leadership. Buoyed over the years by his loving partnership with Helen, Marty's unshakable trust in AJC's mission and his unfaltering confidence in our ability to make a lasting difference were both inspiring and empowering. His insightful counsel and wholehearted support enabled AJC to intensify our work in pursuit of a more tolerant and compassionate world. This was a man of distinction who touched the lives of so many whom he never met, but who are forever enriched by his benevolence. This was a man of incomparable integrity, determined yet unassuming leadership, and inexhaustible humanity and compassion. This was an altruistic man whose heart was deeply touched and whose spirit was passionately stirred by his abiding love for Israel and the Jewish people and by those Jewish values and ideals that epitomized his very being. Through his extraordinary generosity, he has made possible for us all a better, more hopeful future. With Marty's passing, this world has lost a gentle and noble advocate for humankind, and AJC has lost a treasured and irreplaceable member of our family. Yet even at this time of profound sadness, we remain eternally grateful for Marty's life and his remarkable legacy of philanthropy, decency and human kindness that will long be remembered. At this painful time, we extend our heartfelt condolences and prayers to our dear friend Helen, to Adam Kimmel, and to the rest of the grieving family. May his memory always be a blessing. Richard J. Sideman, Pres. David A. Harris, Exec. Dir. Jaime Kelstein, Assoc. Exec. Dir. KIMMEL--Martin S. The Board of Directors, Officers and all Associates of Kimco Realty mourn the loss of Martin S.

Kimco Realty Corporation KIMMEL--Martin S. We are terribly saddened by the loss of Martin Kimmel, our wonderful friend and partner. We started with a handshake 50 years ago and that was all that was ever needed. Marty always tried to do the right thing and used his energy, vigor and zeal to try to make our world better. Marty was blessed with much sweetness and joy in his life. He became the father of Adam and they shared a very close bond. Marty was so very proud of Adam as a person and of his accomplishments. He was blessed that he found a devoted love relationship with his wife Helen. A relationship that brought him much pleasure and enhanced and extended his life. We treasured our years together and will miss him very much. Shirley and Milton Cooper and Family KIMMEL--Marty. The finest gentleman we have ever known. We will miss you.

His impact on the shape and spirit of the Weizmann Institute is immeasurable; among his most recent contributions were an Award for Innovative Investigation, an Institute for Stem Cell Research, and a Center for Nanoscale Science. Marty was a source of profound inspiration for all of us. Along with his wife, Helen, whom he met at a Weizmann Institute event, Marty's devotion to and love for the Institute have changed the face and future of science forever. Over the years, the Kimmels' support encouraged the research of over 60 scientists at the Institute, and has expanded not only its intellectual activities, but the Institute's campus itself. Marty's warmth, compassion, and wisdom will be dearly missed by the entire Weizmann Institute family. We extend heartfelt condolences to Helen and the entire Kimmel family.

Record numbers of bison have been killed this winter as part of a culling effort to protect cattle from brucellosis, sometimes carried by the bison, and to keep bison from roaming outside the park. The culling has angered groups trying to protect bison and drew criticism in a Government Accountability Office report. State and park officials hope the additional land, more than 5,000 acres, will save bison and cattle. “This is a good day for bison, livestock, and Montana,” said Gov. Brian Schweitzer, above."

Assistant Secretary Lyle Laverty replied to a lawsuit filed by three conservation groups.

Conservation groups petitioned to list polar bears as threatened more than three years ago because many scientists say their habitat, sea ice, is shrinking from global warming. Kassie Siegel, spokeswoman for the Center for Biological Diversity, said the request for more time should be rejected. Ms. Siegel said that the law required a decision by scientists, not lawyers, and that wildlife biologists had made their determination that polar bears needed additional protection."

The alliance could set a precedent, on the federal level as well, and become potentially a turning point in German politics. The accord was reached seven weeks after the Christian Democrats lost their majority in Hamburg, forcing them to seek a partner to remain in power. Despite the parties’ longstanding differences, Ole von Beust, the conservative mayor, decided to open negotiations with the Greens rather than ask his party’s traditional partner, the Social Democrats, to enter into a coalition, because, his aides said, of growing public disillusionment over how the so-called grand coalition of that party and his has performed on the federal stage. The Hamburg experiment will be watched closely by all the political parties as the countdown to federal elections next year starts in earnest."

An acclaimed coloratura soprano, she provided great joy throughout her life to those who were touched by her beautiful voice. Loretta was born in NYC on December 2, 1928 to Julia and Benson Varon. Recognized early for her musical gift, she held her first recital when she was 12 years of age, and was accepted to and graduated from the High School of Music and Art. Although a dedicated wife and mother, Loretta was an accomplished artist with performances at Carnegie Hall, the Brooklyn Academy of Music and on radio and TV. During her singing career, she performed as the main soloist in such operas as the Marriage of Figaro, La Boheme, Aida, and Madame Butterfly, and sang in over seven languages. A woman of grace, style, elegance and substance, her passion for the arts was matched only by her love of family, gardening, interior design, sewing, cooking and travel. She is survived by her husband of 53 years, Norman; sons and daughters-in-law, Jeffrey and Kaye; Peter and Wendy; and Kenneth and Lori; as well as her grandchildren Theodore, Alexander, Julia, Amy, Daniel, Eliza, Andrew, Nathaniel and Teddy; her sister Anita and Niece Julie.

But those right in the middle of the experience don't necessarily share that perspective. Consider Samuel, a 10-year-old Upper West Sider. While some kids march to a different drummer, what he hears is more like an entire band. Samuel doesn't understand why you can't have a day of recess or leave for school through the window or turn that molar you've lost into wearable art. And therein hangs -- like an extremely loose tooth -- a tale. Determined not to surrender his molar for a quarter (it does seem cheap; this is, after all, Manhattan), Samuel accosts the Tooth Fairy. When she voices her own longings to be an ordinary New Yorker, Samuel offers to trade lives. (Sure, he's a boy, but flying is cool.) The fairy is thrilled, proclaiming that there's ''no other place where the people are as happy and well adjusted.'' Poor girl -- couldn't someone have shown her a Woody Allen movie?"

2008-04-18T00:00:00Z,"AKRAM KHAN COMPANY As a solo dancer, Akram Khan seemed to absorb the space around him until there was nothing but him on the stage. That's not surprising, perhaps, in someone who began training at the age of 7 in the complex ancient North Indian dance form called Kathak. His choreography fused Kathak seamlessly with Western contemporary dance, winning him awards, international touring and the admiration of major dance figures in Europe like William Forsythe and Pina Bausch, all by his early 30s. But recent works have looked outward with a vengeance, in a trio of duets that were unlikely collaborations with a French ballerina (Sylvie Guillem), a Flemish-Moroccan former hip-hop dancer and choreographer (Sidi Larbi Cherkaoui) and this year with a French actress (Juliette Binoche). Memories of living in a teeming, disorderly larger world -- hanging from a tree as a child in his parents' native Bangladesh, smoking a cigarette on a Brooklyn fire escape as a teenager, and endless and sometimes dangerous border-crossing journeys as an adult -- have crowded in on Mr. Khan's work."

The Scottish playwright David Greig will be quite conspicuous in New York during the coming months: he has two entries in this festival, and in July his adaptation of ''The Bacchae'' will be part of the Lincoln Center Festival. (''The Bacchae,'' featuring Alan Cumming, comes from the National Theater of Scotland, the company behind ''Black Watch'' at St. Ann's Warehouse last fall.) Brits Off Broadway kicks off on Wednesday with Mr. Greig's ''Yellow Moon'' (with, above from left, Keith Macpherson, Nalini Chetty and Andrew Scott Ramsay). This coming-of-age drama about two teenagers on the run in the Scottish Highlands was presented by TAG Citizens Theater of Glasgow at the Edinburgh Festival Fringe last summer, where it got several good reviews -- most of them referring to the lead couple as a modern-day Bonnie and Clyde. Subtitled ''The Ballad of Leila and Lee,'' Mr. Greig's play has a bit of ''Romeo and Juliet'' about it as well."
2008-04-18T00:00:00Z,"GREGORY CREWDSON With production credits to rival those of a James Cameron movie, Gregory Crewdson's photographs are elaborately contrived micro-epics. The final installment of his series ''Behind the Roses,'' the entirety of which has just been published in a single volume, is refreshingly low-key. In these pictures Mr. Crewdson pulls back a bit from the domestic environment, coaxing drama from the arrested development of New England suburbs. The photographs were shot in Rutland, Vt., and in North Adams and Pittsfield, Mass. (Several of Mr. Crewdson's massive soundstages were assembled at the Massachusetts Museum of Contemporary Art.) They are titled after different seasons, but the time of day -- twilight -- is a constant, as is the unremittingly bleak suburban architecture. Figures, seemingly lifted from Edward Hopper paintings, hover in doorways and driveways and on other thresholds. One woman stands outside in the snow with her arms pinned to her sides, staring at a screen door 10 feet away. A man, right, pauses in similar fashion beneath the movie-theater marquee on a small-town street, the traffic lights permanently set to yellow."
2008-04-18T00:00:00Z,"WEISS--Stephen H . The Trustees and staff of the National Humanities Center are deeply saddened by the death of Stephen H. Weiss on April 16.

A committed Life Overseer and among the Medical College's most generous benefactors, Steve and his wife, Suzanne, endowed the Medical College's deanship in 1984. They have also supported many different clinical areas, with a special emphasis on cardiovascular medicine and the work of Dr. O.

In 1984 he and his wife Suzanne endowed the deanship of the Weill Cornell Medical College. In 1992 he established the Stephen H.

At the rally, the pope made reference to his own youth in Nazi Germany -- a regime that he said ""banished God and thus became impervious to anything true and good."" The pope spoke against relativism -- a longstanding stand of his theological teachings -- and urged the young to consider religious vocations."

2008-04-19T00:00:00Z,"A Yale University art student’s startling claim that she artificially inseminated herself, induced repeated abortions and used the blood for her senior project is false, Yale officials said after her account was published in the student newspaper, The Associated Press reported. In an article on Thursday in The Yale Daily News, the student, Aliza Shvarts, was quoted as saying she had inseminated herself “as often as possible” while taking herbal drugs to induce miscarriages as her senior year performance art piece. Her account found its way to the Internet and news outlets before Yale said it had investigated and found it to be false. “The entire project is an art piece, a creative fiction designed to draw attention to the ambiguity surrounding form and function of a woman’s body,” said Helaine Klasky, a university spokeswoman. Ms. Klasky said that when confronted by three Yale officials, Ms. Shvarts acknowledged that she had never been pregnant and did not induce abortions. On Friday, however, Ms. Shvarts had insisted that she had really experienced “repeated, self-induced miscarriages,” although she had said that she had never known if she was actually pregnant. Ms. Klasky responded that the university had expected her to maintain her story: “She said if Yale puts out a statement saying she did not do this, she would say Yale was doing that to protect its reputation.” In Friday’s Yale Daily News, Ms. Shvarts said she planned to display a work that consisted of a cube lined with plastic sheets, with a mixture of blood and petroleum jelly in between, onto which she would project video footage of herself “experiencing miscarriages in her bathroom tub.” Andrew Mangino, the editor in chief of the Yale Daily News, said the newspaper had published the article after receiving a news release about the project.

Federal Bankruptcy Judge Cecelia G. Morris approved a motion brought by lawyers for the Justice Department to convert the Salanders’ case from a Chapter 11 reorganization to a Chapter 7 liquidation, in which a trustee sells everything except “exempt assets.” The Salanders opposed the motion.

Mr. Salander ran the Salander-O’Reilly Galleries on the Upper East Side. By the time he filed for bankruptcy, complaints were mounting from people who said they had consigned artworks to the gallery but were never paid for them. Mr. Salander has denied any wrongdoing."

Mr. Moonves was “very forceful,” the executive said, quoting him as saying that he “could not be happier with the content of CBS News and with the ‘Evening News’ anchor” and that Ms. Couric would be the anchor “today, tomorrow and in the future,” while acknowledging that the ratings for the evening newscast were “very frustrating.” CBS executives held a meeting in February to discuss possible changes in Ms. Couric’s role, but the executive who was at the meeting said no decisions would be made until after the presidential election. Ms. Couric also addressed the meeting and thanked the staff for working hard despite the rumors, specifically thanking the London bureau for setting up an exclusive interview with the prime minister of Britain, Gordon Brown.

2008-04-19T00:00:00Z,"As Gil Brandt, the NFL.com analyst, said about this year's draft, ''There are so many guys who all look alike.'' That means that this is a deep class, chock full of talent through about two rounds. That is especially good news for a team like Atlanta, which has multiple picks in the early rounds and just as many needs to fill. But most draft analysts think this group lacks immediate-impact players like tackle Joe Thomas, who became a Pro Bowler for Cleveland as a rookie, and running back Adrian Peterson, who electrified the N.F.L. for the Vikings. After Boston College's Matt Ryan, it may not even have another first-round quarterback. The biggest name in this draft could be running back Darren McFadden. He is gifted and fast, but he may be best known for off-the-field issues that could make some teams skittish. That means lots of teams near the top will be happy to trade down to avoid paying the exorbitant guaranteed money commanded by those at the head of the draft. The problem is that the absence of a slam-dunk top pick also means they will find few takers. Here is a look at the first round, with each team's needs. 1. Miami Bill Parcells is the wild card of the draft. The Dolphins have many needs everywhere and he is said to be negotiating with at least one of the top few players to try to pound out a below-market deal before the draft. Offensive tackle Jake Long may be his favorite -- although General Manager Jeff Ireland's slip of the tongue at a news conference might have inadvertently revealed a preference for defense. In that case, it could be a linebacker/end, Chris Long or Vernon Gholston. 2. St. Louis The Rams need help along both lines. Chris Long would fit the bill and, because of his Hall of Fame pedigree, is the safest pick in the draft. 3. Atlanta The Falcons need just about everything, and Mike Smith, the new head coach, is a defensive mind. But has any team ever needed a quarterback -- one with no baggage -- more than the Falcons? 4. Oakland The Raiders' defense is weak, but they could also relieve some pressure on JaMarcus Russell with a powerful running game. Will Al Davis be able to resist the game-breaking allure of Darren McFadden? 5. Kansas City The Chiefs need plenty, especially on offense (which turned into a disaster last season) and on an aging defense. The offensive line needs starters now, but if Matt Ryan is available, the Chiefs will have a hard time passing him to take over for Brodie Croyle. 6. Jets If all of their big acquisitions in free agency pan out, the Jets will have addressed almost all of their significant needs, although another pass rusher or a big playmaker on offense would be nice. 7. New England After losing Asante Samuel and Randall Gay in free agency, the Patriots need cornerbacks. And they could use another infusion of youth at linebacker. 8. Baltimore Steve McNair retired on Thursday, continuing the Ravens' never-ending quest for a quarterback. 9. Cincinnati The middle of the defense is trouble for the Bengals, from the line to linebacker. But what this team really needs is to find players who won't add to the off-field distractions. 10. New Orleans Defensive needs are everywhere for the Saints, and this class is deep at cornerback. 11. Buffalo A big-time receiver would take the heat off Lee Evans and give Trent Edwards another reliable outlet. 12. Denver Both lines are threadbare and with Jay Cutler's rising stature at quarterback, the Broncos have to get him protection from a tackle, and perhaps a receiver. 13. Carolina Calling all offensive tackles -- the Panthers have a job for you immediately. 14. Chicago The good news is returner Devin Hester is still here because he is the only Bears player who reliably provides points. The quarterback situation is still a mess, but at this spot, the Bears may concentrate on replacements for their offensive line. 15. Detroit Memo to Matt Millen: No more wide receivers. How about an offensive lineman or a defensive end? 16. Arizona Still, the Cardinals need more help on defense, perhaps at cornerback, than on offense. 17. Minnesota An edge rusher is the most glaring need, although the Vikings could go for an offensive lineman, too. 18. Houston Injuries to Dunta Robinson mean the Texans need a cornerback. 19. Philadelphia A big-play receiver would be good for Donovan McNabb, but if Lito Sheppard is traded, they will need a cornerback. 20. Tampa Bay Jon Gruden wanted Calvin Johnson last year, and they still need a playmaking receiver. But the Buccaneers may be desperate for a running back, too. 21. Washington Jim Zorn, the rookie coach, wants to run the West Coast offense, and he needs a receiver to do it. 22. Dallas If they Cowboys get cornerback Pacman Jones in a trade, and if he is reinstated, they will have filled a big need. In that case, they can go for a running back. 23. Pittsburgh The Steelers have to shore up an offensive line seriously weakened by the departure of guard Alan Faneca. 24. Tennessee The Titans' biggest need is a receiver who can help Vince Young, who regressed last season. 25. Seattle Matt Hasselbeck needs better blocking around him, so the Seahawks could go for an offensive lineman or for a tight end. 26. Jacksonville If the Jaguars are finally going to challenge for the A.F.C. South title, they have to get a pass rusher. 27. San Diego The Chargers have no gaping holes in their starting lineup -- a luxury -- but they could use depth at cornerback. 28. Dallas See No. 22. 29. San Francisco The offense was a mess last season, and the 49ers could go for an offensive lineman. But they also need linebackers. 30. Green Bay Aaron Rodgers can't take over for an icon all by himself. The Packers could use offensive linemen. 31. Giants They need defense, especially someone to replace safety Gibril Wilson, or maybe a linebacker because Kawika Mitchell is also gone. Jerry Reese had such a successful first draft that it wouldn't be surprising if he unearthed a hidden gem with this pick. TEAMS WITH NO FIRST-ROUND PICKS Indianapolis The Colts could use reinforcements on the defensive line and linebackers. Cleveland But everyone in Cleveland should go out and enjoy the spring day because the Browns' first pick is in the fourth round."

The twinkle in your eyes, the lilt in your laugh, and the warmth of your heart will live in our memories forever. Adios, Amigo. The Mexicans WEISS--Stephen H. Beloved husband of Suzanne Rogers, adored father of Heather, Michael, Jonny and Nathalie, cherished brother of Roger and step-sisters Barbara Stern and Jane Scheiber. Stephen, 72, a resident of Greenwich, CT, died April 16 in New York Hospital, of heart failure. He had a distinguished career as an investment banker, philanthropist and former chairman of the Cornell University Board of Trustees. Above all, he was devoted to his family. Mr. Weiss began his career at A.G. Becker & Co. where he served for 11 years, and was a vice president, shareholder and member of the board of directors. In 1970 he co-founded the investment management firm of Weiss, Peck & Greer, and was the firm's managing partner until the firm was sold in 2001. Most recently he was a managing director of the investment firm of Neuberger Berman, LLC. A 1957 graduate of Cornell University, Mr. Weiss was an enthusiastic and generous supporter of the University, and served on the Board of Trustees for 24 years. He was the board's chairman from 1989-1997. He was the first chairman of the Board of Overseers of the Cornell Medical College and Graduate School of Medical Sciences. In 1980 he was named a Life Overseer. His affection for Cornell and his belief in the importance of education led him to serve on and chair many university committees. His activities at Cornell involved all aspects of the university, including serving on four presidential search committees. In 1984 he and his wife Suzanne endowed the deanship of the Weill Cornell Medical College. In 1992 he established the Stephen H. Weiss Presidential Fellows Awards to honor professors exhibiting an outstanding commitment to undergraduate education. A man of great energy and devotion to the community at large, Stephen was a board member of the National Humanities Center, and vice chairman of the Teagle Foundation. He was a member of the Citizens Budget Commission of New York City, and vice chairman of the Centurion Foundation. In 2000 he was appointed an honorary police commissioner of New York City. He also served on the Board of Visitors of California's School of Medicine, Davis, and was a member of the AACU's National Leadership Council for Liberal Education. Recently he was elected to serve on the Board of Tulane University. There will be a private funeral service for the immediate family. A memorial service at a future date will be announced. In lieu of flowers, those who wish to may send donations to: Cornell University, Attn: President David J. Skorton; or to Weill Cornell Medical College, Attn: Dr. O. Wayne Isom. WEISS--Stephen. Steve, we miss you already. You were a warm and wonderful friend, not only to us but to our children. With you the glass was always half full. Suzanne, we embrace you and send our love. Dalia and Larry WEISS--Stephen H. Cornell University mourns the loss of one of its most devoted and beloved alumni, Stephen H. Weiss, whose leadership at Cornell spanned four decades and was characterized by his extraordinarily high standards and intellect, a dedication to supporting the faculty and excellence in research and teaching, and a generosity of spirit that consistently brought out the best in others. A member of the Class of 1957, Steve played a transformative role in the history of the university as a presidential councillor and as a trustee for 24 years, including eight as chair of the board --a role that was not just an assignment for him, but a passion. He considered his fellow trustees, as well as the Cornell administrators, faculty, and staff with whom he worked, an extended family. His enduring commitment to the Cornell faculty and their research inspired a lifetime of significant philanthropy, including the creation of the Weiss Presidential Fellowships, which recognize professors for their inspirational teaching of undergraduates and their distinguished scholarship. He also gave generously to colleges and departments throughout the university --in Ithaca and at Weill Cornell Medical College --establishing professor ships, visiting professorships, research funds, and discretionary funds in honor of faculty. Steve was the driving force behind the creation of the Weill Cornell Medical College Board of Overseers in 1980 and served with distinction as its first chair and then as a life overseer. In December 2007, he was awarded the Frank H.T. Rhodes Exemplary Alumni Service Award, one of the university's highest distinctions. The Cornell community will deeply miss his keen intellect, wit, warmth, and gracious manner. Steve's love for and pride in his family was clear to all who knew him.

Stephen was a very enthusiastic and generous supporter, and served as Vice Chairman of the Board of Directors for 20 years. In 2000, he was appointed Honorary Police Commissioner of New York City. We extend our heartfelt sympathies to his wife Suzanne and his children, Michael, Jonathan, Natalie and Heather. Albert Fried, Jr. Chairman Joseph Dippell, President and all the members of our Board of Directors WEISS--Stephen. The loss of Stephen H. Weiss is mourned by the NewYork Weill Cornell Council. Steve received the Council's Leadership Award in 2005 for his many years of dedicated service to Weill Cornell Medical College. His guidance, vision, and great wisdom will be missed. Jeffrey W. Greenberg, Chairman, NewYork Weill Cornell Council WEISS--Stephen H. The Tulane University community deeply mourns the passing of Stephen H. Weiss. An extraordinary advisor, supporter and friend, Mr. Weiss was a member of the Board of Tulane University since 2006, serving on its governance, development, investment, athletics and health sciences committees. His generosity to Tulane included the establishment of the Suzanne and Stephen Weiss Presidential Fellowships for Undergraduate Teaching, which each year honors and provides funding to faculty members who have displayed sustained, inspired and distinguished teaching of undergraduate students. In addition to his support of teaching, Mr. Weiss, whose son is a member of the Tulane baseball team, also had a great love for Tulane athletics, which he also supported through both his generosity and passionate attendance of games. Tulane President Scott Cowen had recently visited with Mr. Weiss. President Cowen recalls that Mr. Weiss was his usual engaging, thoughtful and delightful self, laughing, enjoying life and expressing deep interest in the well-being of Tulane and its students. That is the way the Tulane community will remember Mr. Weiss. WEISS--Stephen H. Cornell University mourns the loss of one of its most devoted and beloved alumni, Stephen H. Weiss, whose leadership at Cornell spanned four decades and was characterized by his extraordinarily high standards and intellect, a dedication to supporting the faculty and excellence in research and teaching, and a generosity of spirit that consistently brought out the best in others. A member of the Class of 1957, Steve played a transformative role in the history of the university as a presidential councillor and as a trustee for 24 years, including eight as chair of the board --a role that was not just an assignment for him, but a passion. He considered his fellow trustees, as well as the Cornell administrators, faculty, and staff with whom he worked, an extended family. His enduring commitment to the Cornell faculty and their research inspired a lifetime of significant philanthropy, including the creation of the Weiss Presidential Fellowships, which recognize professors for their inspirational teaching of undergraduates and their distinguished scholarship. He also gave generously to colleges and departments throughout the university --in Ithaca and at Weill Cornell Medical College --establishing professor ships, visiting professorships, research funds, and discretionary funds in honor of faculty. Steve was the driving force behind the creation of the Weill Cornell Medical College Board of Overseers in 1980 and served with distinction as its first chair and then as a life overseer. In December 2007, he was awarded the Frank H.T. Rhodes Exemplary Alumni Service Award, one of the university's highest distinctions. The Cornell community will deeply miss his keen intellect, wit, warmth, and gracious manner. Steve's love for and pride in his family was clear to all who knew him. We express our sincere condolences to his wife Suzanne, their children Heather, Michael, Jonny, and Nathalie, and the entire Weiss family. Peter C. Meinig, Chair of the Board of Trustees, David J. Skorton, President Cornell University WEISS--Stephen. Dearest Suzanne, our deepest sympathy, heartfelt thoughts, prayers, and love are with you and your wonderful children at this very sad time and forever. We will miss Steve so very much. Richard and Diana Feldman WEISS--Stephen. Steve, we miss you already. You were a warm and wonderful friend, not only to us but to our children. With you the glass was always half full. Suzanne, we embrace you and send our love. Dalia and Larry WEISS--Stephen H. Beloved husband of Suzanne Rogers, adored father of Heather, Michael, Jonny and Nathalie, cherished brother of Roger and step-sisters Barbara Stern and Jane Scheiber. Stephen, 72, a resident of Greenwich, CT, died April 16 in New York Hospital, of heart failure. He had a distinguished career as an investment banker, philanthropist and former chairman of the Cornell University Board of Trustees. Above all, he was devoted to his family. Mr. Weiss began his career at A.G. Becker & Co. where he served for 11 years, and was a vice president, shareholder and member of the board of directors. In 1970 he co-founded the investment management firm of Weiss, Peck & Greer, and was the firm's managing partner until the firm was sold in 2001. Most recently he was a managing director of the investment firm of Neuberger Berman, LLC. A 1957 graduate of Cornell University, Mr. Weiss was an enthusiastic and generous supporter of the University, and served on the Board of Trustees for 24 years. He was the board's chairman from 1989-1997. He was the first chairman of the Board of Overseers of the Cornell Medical College and Graduate School of Medical Sciences. In 1980 he was named a Life Overseer. His affection for Cornell and his belief in the importance of education led him to serve on and chair many university committees. His activities at Cornell involved all aspects of the university, including serving on four presidential search committees. In 1984 he and his wife Suzanne endowed the deanship of the Weill Cornell Medical College. In 1992 he established the Stephen H. Weiss Presidential Fellows Awards to honor professors exhibiting an outstanding commitment to undergraduate education. A man of great energy and devotion to the community at large, Stephen was a board member of the National Humanities Center, and vice chairman of the Teagle Foundation. He was a member of the Citizens Budget Commission of New York City, and vice chairman of the Centurion Foundation. In 2000 he was appointed an honorary police commissioner of New York City. He also served on the Board of Visitors of California's School of Medicine, Davis, and was a member of the AACU's National Leadership Council for Liberal Education. Recently he was elected to serve on the Board of Tulane University. There will be a private funeral service for the immediate family. A memorial service at a future date will be announced. In lieu of flowers, those who wish to may send donations to: Cornell University, Attn: President David J. Skorton; or to Weill Cornell Medical College, Attn: Dr. O. Wayne Isom. WEISS--Stephen H. The Directors and staff of the Teagle Foundation mourn the death of Stephen H. Weiss on April 16, 2008. Mr. Weiss was named by Cornell University as its representative on the Board of the Teagle Foundation in November 1998.

His incisive judgement, generous spirit and deep commitment to higher education will be remembered by all who knew him. John Chalsty, Chairman of the Board W. Robert Connor, President and members of the Board of Directors WEISS--Stephen H. The Partners of Weiss, Peck & Greer mourn the passing of Stephen Henry Weiss and extend our heartfelt sympathy to Suzanne and the entire Weiss family. Stephen founded Weiss, Peck & Greer in 1970 with Philip Greer, Stephen Peck and Roger Weiss and established an enduring and well - respected investment management firm characterized by loyalty, dedication and service.

He came to Brooks School in 1948, intending to teach for only one year; forty-three years later he retired as assistant-headmaster of the school and settled in Cape Town, South Africa. His proudest achievement during his tenure was the introduction of the African Exchange Program between Brooks students and their counterparts at Bishops School in Cape Town. Richard hoped to encourage his students to become ''citizens of a larger world community''. The program was ahead of its time and has become a model for several schools since then. A lover of American art and artifacts, Richard befriended Andy Warhol in the 1960s and soon began collecting the artist's work. His entire collection of Warhols was recently given to Williams College, his alma mater. Brooks School will have lending rights. Richard will be sorely missed by the countless Brooks students he mentored and by the many families and friends who shared his love of Africa.

2008-04-20T00:00:00Z,"BY DESIGN Philippe Starck's product design often entered the realm of pure silliness, perhaps epitomized by the goblet-shaped toddler sippy cup in plastic masquerading as crystal that Starck designed for Target back in 2002. Or maybe the WW Stool he designed for Vitra, described as a stool or a ''support for users who prefer to stand,'' priced at an astonishing $4,670. (I will give him a nod for his spider-legged juice squeezer for Alessi; if you'll pardon the unpardonable pun, that design has legs.) I write of Starck in the past tense because the increasingly cynical vibe of his creations seems to have caught up with him. In an interview with the German newspaper Die Zeit recently, Starck proclaimed that ''everything that I designed is absolutely unnecessary.'' This continued a jag of self-deprecation started at the TED conference in March, where Starck began by addressing his audience thusly: ''I must tell you I am like that [indicates shaking hands], not very comfortable, because usually, in life, I think my job is absolutely useless.'' Starck also announced his impending retirement (not effective immediately, but two years from now, so we can expect more of the same)."

It also allows media sophisticates to disseminate high-quality productions virally in spaces usually devoted to college pranks and pet videos.

After working for over a dozen years in Boston at WNAC as a reporter and anchor, and doing play-by-play for various major league and college sports teams, in 1957 Mr. Smith began a career in New York City at WOR Radio and TV. For over three decades, his deep, melodic voice became familiar to New Yorkers as they listened to him bring them the news and commentary from the studio, the street, presidential conventions, inaugurations, NASA space flights and every kind of disaster and national tragedy. He was the original host of William F. Buckley's TV show, 'Firing Line,' the anchor of 'New York Report' on Channel 9 for 20 years (19641984), and the radio voice of the New York Knicks basketball team and Army football. At one point, the New York Daily News dubbed him 'the Walter Cronkite of news radio.' He once told his son, Mark, that ''I liked hearing the phone ring at four in the morning. It meant I might be on my way to something big.'' In addition to his son, Mr. Smith is survived by his wife, Mildred, and three grandchildren, Zachary, Rachel and Lexie. His daughter Deborah died in 1978."

''Our students were not dressing up to par,'' says the president, Michael J. Sorrell, who put in place a business casual dress code last fall. To take the sting out of the cost of a new wardrobe -- most students are ''of humble origins,'' he says -- he reached out to the community for donations and set up the Clothes Closet, a free ''boutique'' where students can get new items as well as the occasional gently worn Armani suit or St. John dress. Yes, those are Ferragamos on Joseph Adams (left), a freshman majoring in business who has always prized dressing well. The shoes, slacks and tie were a gift from a mentor. ''The idea,'' Mr. Adams says, ''is to empower young African-Americans -- no, people of different colors -- to say, 'Look, when you dress up, you feel like you run things, don't you?' '' MISSION STATEMENTS The dress code at Brigham Young reflects the mores of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints: no extreme fashions (navel piercings, minis, halter tops, for girls) or hairstyles (covering ears or below the collar, for boys). That's not to suggest B.Y.U. lacks style trends. Young Mormons typically do missionary work, spreading their faith while doing community service projects.

''We actually came up with the idea after a few drinks. In English university there's something called 'Jailbreak,' where you have to get as far as you can in a week and back, without spending any money, for charity. I was living in Paris over the holidays so we started there. I wanted to stand outside the Arc de Triomphe -- I thought it would be hilarious to stand there dressed as a hitchhiker. That didn't work, so we walked down the Champs Élysées, and then a man stopped and took us on our first hitch. I think we took 27 lifts, 9 of which were in big lorries. The whole trip was all these random experiences, meeting so many different people who were all really kind to us. We didn't have any aggressive remarks, unpleasant experiences. It all went off completely without a hitch.'' As told to Austin Considine"

As Rollins tried to play through an ankle injury, he had spent the past two series looming as a threat off the bench and in the Mets' heads. At the end of last season, Rollins gave voice to the Mets' epic collapse. He tormented them with his cocksure comments off the field and his M.V.P.-caliber play on it. But after spraining his left ankle in the Mets' home opener on April 8 -- right after helping complete a Phillies comeback with a run-scoring single in a 5-2 victory -- Rollins could no longer hurt them with his bat. Playing without him, the Phillies seemed to lose some of their edge."

2008-04-23T00:00:00Z,"In a significant reversal, major meat and dairy industry groups backed a total ban on so-called downer cattle from entering the food supply. Calls for such a ban have come from watchdog groups and some lawmakers in the wake of the large beef recall from a Southern California slaughterhouse in February, but the industry had resisted. Current law bans slaughter of most cows that are unable to stand, or downers, but allows them in if they fall after passing a veterinarian’s inspection and then are reinspected. Advocacy groups called that a loophole, but the Agriculture Department and the meat industry opposed changing it. Now, under pressure from Congress and outside groups, the industry has reconsidered. The American Meat Institute, the National Meat Association and the National Milk Producers Federation said they had petitioned the Agriculture Department to enact a total ban. “We think that the time has come,” said Jeremy Russell, spokesman for the National Meat Association, which represents some 400 packers and processors. “We want to send a clear message to consumers that we’re putting their welfare and concerns ahead of the economics.”."

Devoted husband for 66 years to the late Babs Anatole. Loving father of Amy Schwab and her husband Jim, and Mark Anatole and his wife Jodi. Proud Poppy to Kate and Joanna Schwab and Emily and Carter Anatole. ''Tolia'' as he was known to his old ''China hand'' friends and family, was born in Kiev, Russia. His 98 years were Horatio Alger-like. David's formal education ended when he left school at age 12 to support his mother and sisters. As a young adult he lived in China where his experiences were the stuff that Hollywood scripts are made of: his travels via caravan to Mongolia to buy wool for British colonials (he was typically the first Caucasian the locals had seen), marriage solicitations from Asian royalty, assisting cavalry escorts fighting bandits in the Gobi Desert before being kidnapped and on and on. David came to the U.S. at age 26 with broken English... and a letter of business introduction. Over the next four decades and throughout his business career, he traveled throughout Europe, Asia, and South America as President of the textile division of a U.S. conglomerate, and later his own company, Haroco, Inc. David was blessed with a lifelong passion, horseback riding and jumping and the hunt, that extended from childhood to his early 90s. His beloved horses, from Adventurer to Captain George all too often gave Babs competition for weekend quality time. At age 90, David wrote his memoirs, ''Ma Chu'', which will remain a wonderful legacy to his family and future generations. Poppy, as Babs always reminded the family, ''Happy Times.''

Devoted husband for 66 years to the late Babs Anatole. Loving father of Amy Schwab and her husband Jim, and Mark Anatole and his wife Jodi. Proud Poppy to Kate and Joanna Schwab and Emily and Carter Anatole. ''Tolia'' as he was known to his old ''China hand'' friends and family, was born in Kiev, Russia. His 98 years were Horatio Alger-like. David's formal education ended when he left school at age 12 to support his mother and sisters. As a young adult he lived in China where his experiences were the stuff that Hollywood scripts are made of: his travels via caravan to Mongolia to buy wool for British colonials (he was typically the first Caucasian the locals had seen), marriage solicitations from Asian royalty, assisting cavalry escorts fighting bandits in the Gobi Desert before being kidnapped and on and on. David came to the U.S. at age 26 with broken English... and a letter of business introduction. Over the next four decades and throughout his business career, he traveled throughout Europe, Asia, and South America as President of the textile division of a U.S. conglomerate, and later his own company, Haroco, Inc. David was blessed with a lifelong passion, horseback riding and jumping and the hunt, that extended from childhood to his early 90s. His beloved horses, from Adventurer to Captain George all too often gave Babs competition for weekend quality time. At age 90, David wrote his memoirs, ''Ma Chu'', which will remain a wonderful legacy to his family and future generations. Poppy, as Babs always reminded the family, ''Happy Times.''

2008-04-24T00:00:00Z,"WALKING is the Rodney Dangerfield of the fitness world: It gets no respect. Consider walking shoes, historically the clunky, unattractive stepsiblings of running shoes. But walking is the top fitness activity in the United States, with more than 89 million Americans taking part, according to the National Sporting Goods Association. Not only has the number of race-walking events increased -- the number listed on active.com was 23 percent higher in the first quarter of this year over the same period last year -- but more people are participating, inspiring athletic shoe manufacturers to take walking more seriously. Many walking shoes now use running-shoe technologies, namely lighter material and super-breathable fabrics. While many people do walk in running shoes, experts say they shouldn't. Shoes designed for fitness walking have lower heels than running shoes, ''which is better for preventing shin splints,'' said Dr. Douglas Richie, a past president of the American Academy of Podiatric Sports Medicine."

2008-04-24T00:00:00Z,"Novelty as cause for celebration! In ballet, an art so often stuffed with the same old chestnuts, it takes real courage to promote creativity rather than conservation. Diaghilev remains the exemplar here, but in this regard the United States has led the world for several decades. The concept of presenting a multiple-program bonanza of new choreography goes back to the 1972 Stravinsky Festival of New York City Ballet. That event included old works too, but its wealth of innovation became the stuff of legend. At least four of the new works choreographed then have gone into international ballet repertory. One of that festival's dancers was Peter Martins, who now runs City Ballet. In 1988 he staged its American Music Festival along the same lines, and then, starting in 1992, he began a series of occasional, somewhat festival-like spring Diamond Projects, each of which has produced multiple new works within weeks. Another of those 1972 dancers was Helgi Tomasson. Since 1985 he has run San Francisco Ballet, which is now reaching the climax of its 75th-anniversary season by presenting a New Works Festival that bids to rival City Ballet in the new-choreography stakes."

Last year the entertainer, whose real name is Calvin Broadus, was refused a visa for a tour after he and five members of his entourage were arrested during a reported melee at Heathrow Airport in 2006. In January an immigration judge, Nehar Bird, said he had found no evidence that Snoop Dogg was responsible for any public disorder.

Although this may sound like a solution that would make environmentalists blanch, Ms. Koizumi and Mr. Scoffier have no intention of polluting the air. Their plans involve barbecue skewers, packing tape, string and, most important, enthusiastic children. As artists, they have devised a way to turn two or more plastic bags into a modified box kite, and they will demonstrate on Sunday as part of ''Kite Flight: Plastic Play,'' a workshop sponsored by Socrates Sculpture Park and the Noguchi Museum in Queens."

2008-04-25T00:00:00Z,"CHRIS ROCK When Senator Barack Obama made a speech about race last month, the consensus from commentators was that it was rare to hear such a frank meditation on the topic. Well, candor about race may not be a common practice for politicians on the stump, but it's nothing new to comedy clubs, where black comedians have often held the spotlight by refracting the lens to illuminate issues of race in America. No one is better at this than Chris Rock, above. Following in the tradition of Richard Pryor and Eddie Murphy, Mr. Rock's jokes -- if they can be called that -- would be heartbreaking if they weren't delivered in a voice ready to start a fight and paired with comedic timing ready to dispel one. Mr. Rock brings his own meditation on race, and class, to Madison Square Garden for five nights starting on Wednesday. The appearance, with Mario Joyner, is a return for Mr. Rock, who opened his appropriately named ''No Apologies'' tour with a sold-out show at the Garden on New Year's Eve. Since then he has crisscrossed the country at a pace rivaling that of a political campaign, and this year's election hasn't been far from his mind. In January he gave Mr. Obama and Senator Hillary Rodham Clinton a good ribbing, although he reserved his most blistering words for Mrs. Clinton. Challenging her campaign message, that she has more experience, he said, ''You get on a plane tomorrow, you want the pilot's wife flying you?''"

The five-member Mont Alto Motion Picture Orchestra, based in Louisville, Colo., and led by Rodney Sauer, can be heard on several silent-film DVDs, but the group will offer its first live performance in Manhattan on Friday at Lincoln Center, accompanying two films of high interest in themselves: Harold Lloyd's 1927 comedy ''The Kid Brother'' (6 p.m.) and William A. Wellman's rarely screened 1928 social drama ''Beggars of Life'' (9 p.m.), with Louise Brooks (above, with Richard Arlen) as a young woman who kills her abusive stepfather and, to escape the police, disguises herself as a boy and joins a group of tramps."

Mr. Vincent pleaded guilty in 2005 to working secretly on behalf of the Iraqi government to lobby American and United Nations officials about the oil-for-food program. In exchange for his efforts, he received millions of dollars in concessions to sell Iraqi oil. Mr. Vincent avoided prison time largely because of the substantial cooperation he provided to prosecutors. He was the chief government witness in the trials of Tongsun Park, a South Korean businessman who was sentenced to three years in prison on charges of illegally trying to influence United Nations officials, and of Oscar S.

The Eagles fans will have to be a bit more patient. Barring another deal, Philadelphia will have two picks in the quick succession in, oh about, 21 minutes. The Eagles also gained an additional fourth-round pick (No. 117) in the deal, while giving up a fifth-rounder (No. 152). Philadelphia now has three fourth-round selections.13/44.

AtlantaWashington: Fred Davis, TE, Southern California18/49. Philadelphia: DeSean Jackson, WR, CaliforniaMinutes before the selection was announced, Jackson was seen on the big TV screens here receiving a phone call and celebrating, which caused a celebration among the Eagles fans. An electrifying player whose draft stock was hurt by his size, Jackson will probably play a significant role in the return game. As one excited Eagles fan told me after the draft, ""Goodbye, Reno Mahe.""19/50. Arizona: Calais Campbell, DE, Miami (Fla.)20/51. Washington: Malcolm Kelly, WR, OklahomaWe are starting to see teams drafting highly-regarded players whose stock dropped after the combine and pro days. Campbell is one, and Kelly, coming out of college, was considered one of the top receivers available, but injuries and perceived attitude problems hurt him. But Washington may have gotten a steal, particularly when paired with its earlier pick of Devin Thomas.21/52. Tampa BayJacksonville: Quentin Groves, DE, AuburnThe Jaguars also send a fifth-round pick (No. 158) this year and a seventh-round pick next year to Tampa Bay to move up six spots.22/53.

Or maybe it's competition?26/57. Miami: Chad Henne, QB, MichiganAnd here come the quarterbacks. This year's class is not deep, but it is a bit surprising that we have gone 57 picks and only four quarterbacks have been taken.27/58. JacksonvilleTampa Bay: Dexter Jackson, WR, Appalachian StateThe Buccaneers, after trading down for this pick, used up all of their seven minutes, the first team to see the clock go down to 0:00 so far in this ""streamlined"" draft, as the N.F.L. likes to call it. And they used all the time for a player they already had. Oh, different Dexter Jackson. That Jackson, a safety now with the Bengals, was the Super Bowl MVP for Tampa Bay in 2003.28/59. Indianapolis: Michael Pollak, OG, Arizona StateThis was the Colts' only first-day pick, but the last offensive lineman on a day for the trenches, which was expected. Ten offensive lineman and 11 defensive linemen were selected. Eight tackles were taken in the first round, a record.29/60. Green Bay: Patrick Lee, DB, Auburn30/61. Dallas: Martellus Bennett, TE, Texas A&M31/62. New England: Terrence Wheatley, CB, Colorado32/63. Giants: Terrell Thomas, CB, Southern CaliforniaAgain, not surprising considering the depth at the position, 10 cornerbacks were taken in a truly streamlined draft.

As we mourn, we celebrate the life of this extraordinary man: public television pioneer, creator of acclaimed and pacesetting public television programming, television interviewer, professor, mentor and great friend to us all. He was always a gentleman. Jim was modest about his role as the creator in 1954 of San Francisco's acclaimed public television station KQED that won a worldwide reputation for his imaginative and bold programming. In 1969 Jim became the president of NET, the predecessor to PBS. When NET merged with New York's WNDT/Channel 13, Jim became president of the channel, renaming it WNET. Jim served on the establishing boards of PBS and Children's Television Workshop. From 1976 until 1988 Jim was Professor of Television and Radio at The City University of New York (CUNY) Brooklyn College. Jim's generosity as a teacher and mentor enabled the careers of many working in television today. In 2000 Jim honored CUNY TV by agreeing to be the Chair of the Advisory Board and in 2003 a member of the CUNY TV Foundation Board. We offer our condolences to Jim's sons Douglas, Alan, Ross and their families, and to Jeanne Alexander, his partner for the past fifteen years. We are proud to have had Jim's guidance and friendship. We will always cherish him and all he did for CUNY TV. Robert Isaacson Executive Director DAY--James, April 24, 2008. A pioneer in public television for over five decades. Husband to the late Beverley, beloved father to sons Douglas, of San Jose; Alan, of Sunnyvale, CA; and Ross, of New York City, and late daughter Meredith of New York. No funeral service; contributions can be made to Meredith Day Johnson Fund, San Francisco Foundation, 225 Bush St., Ste. 500, San Francisco, CA 94104. A memorial service is planned for December."

2008-04-27T00:00:00Z,"Before her spiritually earnest recent guest appearance on ''American Idol,'' DOLLY PARTON was lying low, having ducked out of a major tour. She cited back strain as the cause, a bit colorfully. (As Reuters put it, in a widely carried headline: ''Dolly Parton postpones tour, blames breasts.'') Now Ms. Parton, the world's most effervescent country star, is playing her rescheduled dates, barring any further setbacks. Her proud new album, ''Backwoods Barbie'' (Dolly), which briefly cracked the Top 20, takes a brightly self-conscious approach to her plasticized image, notably on the title track: ''Don't let these false eyelashes lead you to believe/That I'm as shallow as I look, 'cause I run true and deep.'' That much should be obvious, but Ms. Parton can hardly be faulted for making the case every now and again. Thursday at 8 p.m., Radio City Music Hall, (212) 307-7171, radiocity.com; $49.50 to $100. Saturday at 8 p.m., Borgata Casino, Atlantic City, (866) 692-6742, theborgata.com; $65 to $125. Another female pop polymath known for messing with notions of glamour -- besides the obvious one, who appears on the cover of this section -- is the singer-songwriter Allison Goldfrapp, namesake of the British electropop duo GOLDFRAPP. ''Seventh Tree'' (Mute), the group's fourth proper album, leans somewhat surprisingly in the direction of languorous folk-pop, rather than fluorescent dance music. There's no telling which side the breathy Ms. Goldfrapp will emphasize at the Beacon Theater on Tuesday; maybe, like Ms. Parton, she can have it both ways.

2008-04-27T00:00:00Z,"''It is the nakedness of drawing that I like,'' Philip Guston once said. Drawing, part of a back-to-basics ethos, helped him to negotiate the transition from Abstract Expressionism to a more figurative style. During his most restless and embattled period, from 1966 to 1968, he abandoned painting entirely and made hundreds of drawings, some as simple as a commalike swipe of an ink brush on an otherwise blank piece of paper. ''PHILIP GUSTON: WORKS ON PAPER,'' opening on Friday at the MORGAN LIBRARY & MUSEUM, is the first retrospective of his drawings in two decades. The show was organized by the Kunstmuseum in Bonn and the Staatliche Graphische Sammlung in Munich. The Morgan is its only stop in the United States."

The players were black, the uniforms white. The team's co-owner, Effa Manley, had just spent $700 on a new set, about as much as she paid her best players each month. It was the Eagles' first time in the Negro World Series, and she wanted them to look the part of champions."

2008-04-27T00:00:00Z,"Youth has not been wasted on any of the young dancers performing in the 1 2 3 FESTIVAL, opening on Tuesday at the Joyce Theater. The dancers are members of three second or junior companies attached to the Alvin Alvin Ailey American Dance Theater, American Ballet Theater and the Paul Taylor Dance Company. All three will perform on opening night. Such ensembles were once primarily a way of training new senior company members, often on the road in theaters too small to present the larger and more established troupes to which they were attached. And audiences certainly got their money's worth in programs that combined expertise with a hunger for the work at hand that made for exhilarating dance. In recent years the second companies have also served as crucibles for new pieces by choreographers ranging from familiar to unknown. AILEY II(also performing Wednesday at 7:30 p.m., May 3 at 2 p.m. and 8 p.m., May 4 at 2 p.m., May 7 at 7:30 p.m. and May 8 at 8 p.m.; $44) has perhaps the most adventurous program, with premieres by Troy Powell, Christopher L. Huggins and Stephane Boko. ABT II(also Thursday and May 9 at 8 p.m., May 10 at 2 p.m. and May 11 at 7:30 p.m.; $38, $25 on May 11) will perform excerpts from ''Raymonda'' and August Bournonville's ''Flower Festival at Genzano,'' as well as Antony Tudor's ''Continuo'' and a new piece by Lauri Stallings. And TAYLOR 2(also Friday at 8 p.m., May 4 and May 6 at 7:30, May 10 at 8 p.m. and May 11 at 2 p.m.; $38, $25 on May 4) will present a mini-feast of dance by Paul Taylor that includes ''Runes,'' ''Profiles,'' ''Arden Court'' and a series of duets from ''Roses.''

I knew I wasn't standing on solid ground, since it hadn't been the best spring training of my career. But it wasn't my first rodeo, either. I had been brought in by the Yankees as a hired gun to support an oft-injured outfield and to provide the sort of depth where, should one of their star outfielders need a day off, the team wouldn't be losing that much in leadership. But after all was said and done, here I was in a 6-by-8 makeshift conference room about to get my pink slip."

2008-04-27T00:00:00Z,"Ever since Christopher Hampton adapted ''LES LIAISONS DANGEREUSES'' for the stage in a Royal Shakespeare Company production in 1985, the story of sexual warfare among French aristocrats has become the Britney Spears of 18th-century epistolary novels: a bosom-heaving entertainment that never goes away. The hit play transferred to Broadway and quickly became a Hollywood movie starring Glenn Close and John Malkovich. Several film versions based on the novel followed, including Milos Forman's ''Valmont'' and the guilty pleasure ''Cruel Intentions,'' which updated the story to the cutthroat world of Manhattan prep schools. The novel, first adapted into a film in 1959 in a version starring Jeanne Moreau, has also been turned into a television mini-series, an opera, a ballet and even a pornographic film. So, one might wonder, why is the Roundabout Theater reviving this war horse (in a period production staged by Rufus Norris) yet again? I'm sure there are many answers, but for me the most compelling might be the opportunity to see the great LAURA LINNEY stretch herself as the conniving, seductive Marquise de Merteuil."

2008-04-28T00:00:00Z,"Iran's prosecutor general railed on Sunday against the invasion of Barbie, Batman, Spider-Man and Harry Potter and demanded that the country's young be protected against them, Agence France-Presse reported. Urging measures to safeguard ''Islamic culture and revolutionary values,'' the prosecutor, Ghorban-Ali Dorri Najafabadi, was quoted by the ISNA news agency as saying: ''Promoting figures like Barbie, Batman, Spider-Man and Harry Potter and the uncontrolled import of CDs of video games and films should alarm all the country's officials. We need to find substitutes to ward off this onslaught, which aims at children and young people whose personality is in the process of being formed.'' Although officials in Iran regularly denounce Western culture, Western toys have been popular there, and affluent parents often indulge their children with them. The prosecutor said, ''These toys, which do not respect the required norms, present dangers for the health of children and affect the survival of toy factories in this country.'' In July 2007 ''Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows'' went on sale in Tehran. Two years ago the police raided toy shops and put black stickers on the packaging of Barbie dolls to hide their bodies. Barbie contravenes Iran's rule that women must cover all bodily contours. Iran's rivals to Barbie and her partner, Ken, are Sara and Dara, who respect Islamic rules but do not enjoy Barbie's popularity."

2008-04-28T00:00:00Z,"When David Robertson first conducted at the Metropolitan Opera in 1996, he had the distressing experience of leading a performance of Janacek's ''Makropulos Case'' in which a tenor died onstage. Things went more smoothly on Saturday night, his first appearance at the house in a decade, leading Mozart's ''Entführung aus dem Serail'' (''The Abduction From the Seraglio''). In the current political climate the genial ending of Mozart's comic singspiel, in which misunderstandings between Muslims and Christians are cheerily smoothed over and peace made, seems depressingly remote. John Dexter's low-budget production from 1979, with its tired looking cutout sets, also seems dated."

2008-04-28T00:00:00Z,"Less than three weeks before this year's Coachella Valley Music and Arts Festival, still the country's banner festival of alternative rock, Prince joined the bill in the most prominent slot. He was Saturday night's final main-stage show, at the end of a day including important sets by Portishead and M.I.A. The addition seemed like a last-minute attempt to increase ticket sales, but it also raised the question: What does Prince signify these days to alternative-rock America? We know what he means in the physical world, even in the California desert here. But what about in the state of mind that is alternative culture; what does he mean in Indie-O? And what would he do to address the credibility issue, the chimerical question that hangs over just about every performer here? On Saturday he played his Fender Telecasters and Stratocasters whenever he possibly could, through a nearly two-hour set. Extra helpings of guitar, side dishes, desserts, groaning tables of guitar. And he just declared credibility outright. ''You are in the coolest place on earth right now,'' he told the crowd in his opening remarks."

The caution means that the matter will remain on her record and could count against her should she be charged with a similar offense. Her spokesman, Chris Goodman, said Ms. Winehouse, 24, had admitted to a common assault by slapping a man with an open hand and accepted a caution. The statement said, ''Amy was fully cooperative and apologized for the incident.'' She was arrested on suspicion of assault after reports of a scuffle with two men during a wild night out. Ms. Winehouse and her husband, Blake Fielder-Civil, were arrested in Norway in October on charges of drug possession. Ms. Winehouse was arrested in London in December on suspicion of attempting to interfere with a court case involving her husband, who is in jail awaiting trial on charges of perverting the course of justice in a case in which he is accused of assaulting a barman."

Since 2006, when the contract took effect, more than 600 teachers have been placed in the reserve after failing to find new positions.The reserve is an outgrowth of the city's contract with the teachers' union, which ended seniority rights in staffing decisions as well as the automatic transfer of teachers who had been cut because of shrinking enrollment, the closing of large schools or the elimination of particular programs.

At a news conference the minister, Mohammad Hossein Safar, said: “This is what we ask publishers and writers, ‘You are aware of the vetting code, so censor pages which are likely to create a dispute.’ ” Declaring that publications should conform to the system’s “religious, moral and national sensitivities,” he warned against graphic descriptions of relationships or sex, saying, “It is a clear violation of the law to give an excessive portrayal of a man and woman’s private relationships” and to “subject our youth and adults to descriptions of intercourse,” adding that “if anyone makes fun of religion, be it Islam or Christianity,” the country “should not allow opposition to God to be reflected in the media.” All publications in Iran must be approved by the Culture Ministry. Publishers have complained of tighter censorship of new books since Mahmoud Ahmadinejad became president in 2005. The culture minister made his remarks in reply to a recent letter from the Tehran Publishers Association complaining that the ministry employed a prolonged and arbitrary vetting process. The letter said, “It has been frequently seen that an issue which has resulted in a book being banned is abundant in another one that is published.”."

2008-04-30T14:18:09Z,"Lots of us think about Amy Spindler, the mind of Amy Spindler, and I'm glad people are again discovering her writing. She came to life, I think, in the latter part of her run as fashion critic of the NYT and then again when she became Style Editor of the Magazine. Amy was a good writer and an excellent, tireless reporter who had an energetic mind that sought out new ideas. She loved the nostalgia piece; one of my favorite articles that I wrote for her at the Magazine was a profile of Jacques Tiffeau (a wild, brilliant guy and a lover of Dior's, by the way). She saw the charm and evergreen ""news"" in those kinds of pieces. But Amy was also someone with strong moral beliefs and maybe that was the source of her contentiousness. She loved catching a fashion exec in a lie, and, of course, there was the heroin chic piece. You felt her rage, her high sense of standards. And she could REALLY yack during a fashion show. Amy would be talking away during a show and you'd be looking at the clothes and going, ""Yeah ahum yeah ahum."" Somehow, she saw everything. Her deputy at the mag, Andy Port, gave a marvelous speech at Amy's memorial, which was held at the Rainbow Room. Amy had a knack, as Andy said, of persuading people to her side. We all knew that special power of hers pretty well."

In its decision, the court noted that the Port Authority, a bistate New York and New Jersey agency that owned the trade center, did not argue that the bombing was unforeseeable, only that it was unlikely, since its own consultants and an internal study group had predicted ""with exact prescience"" how an attack could be carried out.

When she was a child, nearly everyone she knew was from somewhere else, ""back East,"" all the way to Sweden, Norway or the Russian steppes.

On the final night of the bed-in, Lennon led a recording of &#8220;Give Peace a Chance,&#8221; sung by him and 50 or so guests, including Timothy Leary, Tommy Smothers, Petula Clark and Allen Ginsberg. He also gave Ms. Renard a few mementos, including the lyrics, above, and told her that &#8220;one day they will be worth something.&#8221; On July 10 the lyrics and some rare photographs will be offered in London by Christie&#8217;s South Kensington at a sale of rock and pop memorabilia. A Christie&#8217;s announcement said the items were expected to bring $400,000 to $600,000."
2008-04-30T00:00:00Z,"The downward trend for the CBS News anchor Katie Couric continued last week as the network&#8217;s evening newscast dipped again in the ratings. One week after setting a record low, with about 5.39 million viewers, the newscast attracted about 50,000 fewer people, averaging about 5.34 million. The number is the lowest total for the &#8220;CBS Evening News&#8221; since Nielsen research introduced its new rating system in 1987. The broadcast was far more popular before that date. Ms. Couric&#8217;s ratings have been sliding since reports that she and the top management of CBS have held discussions about her future at the network, although network executives, including the chairman, Leslie Moonves, have expressed faith in her and the program. The race at the top of the newscast competition was closer than the prior week as NBC&#8217;s program beat ABC&#8217;s by about 227,000 viewers. A week earlier the gap was about 700,000 viewers as ABC faced possible negative fallout from widespread criticism of its presentation of the Democratic presidential debate in Pennsylvania. For the week NBC averaged about 8.01 million viewers, with ABC at about 7.79 million."

2008-04-30T00:00:00Z,"Energy-hungry India hosted President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad of Iran for a brief but symbolic visit. Mr. Ahmadinejad met in New Delhi with the president, the prime minister and several cabinet ministers, and used the occasion to condemn the efforts of ''bullying powers'' to contain what he called Iran's right to develop nuclear energy. He spoke glowingly of longstanding ties between India and Iran. The visit produced no path-breaking bilateral deals, nor did it iron out the kinks in a proposed 1,600-mile-long natural gas pipeline. But it brought the Indian government a chance to show that it is willing to buck pressure from the White House and shake hands with a man Washington reviles. The government of Prime Minister Manmohan Singh is under pressure at home to assert its independence from the United States, even as that pressure has stalled a landmark nuclear accord initiated by the Bush administration that would allow India access to nuclear technology on the world market.

2008-05-02T00:00:00Z,"'PRINCESS PHOOEY' Few would argue that middle school is like a fairy tale. But at least one fairy tale is like middle school. That's ''Princess Phooey,'' a world premiere musical from Tada! Youth Theater, which portrays the royalty of imaginary kingdoms as close kin to the queen bees of real eighth grade. Lisa Diana Shapiro, who wrote the book and lyrics, has centered her plot on the recently awakened Sleeping Beauty -- here Princess Elessia -- and her little sister, Ermengarde (the Phooey of the title). But Elessia (Jasmine Perez, above center, with Mary Claire Miskell and Christopher Broughton) is nothing like Disney's pure-hearted Aurora (she's an insufferable snob), and the three beneficent fairies are essentially simpering mean girls brandishing wands instead of cellphones. As for poor Ermengarde (Ms. Miskell and Katie Lerner Lee alternate in the role), she's not princess material. A rebel who climbs trees and plays with the servants, she says phooey to pink frills and handsome princes like the one played by Mr. Broughton."

2008-05-02T00:00:00Z,"The 1964 Gallery of Modern Art at 2 Columbus Circle is being transformed into a new space for the Museum of Arts and Design. Almost everything about the building has changed, but the original ''lollipop'' columns persist. New York may not be able yet to place the name, but the lollipops will certainly be familiar. So will the shape and the pale color of Edward Durell Stone's Gallery of Modern Art, built at 2 Columbus Circle in 1964 to house Huntington Hartford's art collection. Almost everything else has changed, however, with the transformation of the building into the Museum of Arts and Design (formerly known as the American Craft Museum), designed by Brad Cloepfil of Allied Works Architecture. Stone's design, initially disparaged, gained admirers in recent years, including Tom Wolfe; the architectural historians Vincent Scully and Robert A. M. Stern; and Herbert Muschamp, former architecture critic of The New York Times. Their pleas could not move the Landmarks Preservation Commission to hold a hearing on whether to designate the building. So the transformation went ahead. Though the museum is four months from opening, the new facade has now emerged from its construction cocoon. Some viewers discern the word ''HE'' in the facade. It is the inadvertent result of a late design revision calling for a band of glass where a restaurant will be. That created a crossbar, making an H. Once one sees it as a letter form, it is hard to ignore."
2008-05-02T00:00:00Z,"GRAFFITI SEASON Technically there's probably not a ''season'' for graffiti. But springtime is close enough. ''You definitely see more names start to show up on the wall once it starts to warm up,'' said Evan Roth, a tagging connoisseur and a founder of Graffiti Research Lab. His group takes a more high-tech approach than popping open a can of spray paint: in one recent project it used lasers to tag structures, including the Brooklyn Bridge, above, remotely (and erase-ably). Other works include projectile LEDs and mobile street furniture; all are documented on its Web site, graffitiresearchlab.com, so others can copy its ideas. ''We fit into the open source credence of belief,'' Mr. Roth said. ''We're trying to come up with methods that are cheaper and easier for nonnerds to create.'' On Sunday, at the PopRally series at the Museum of Modern Art, the group will screen its first film, documenting its creation. Mr. Roth, a former Web designer and architect, started it with James Powderly, a robotics engineer, in 2005, when both were fellows at the Eyebeam Institute. Several of the artists featured will speak afterward, and the band Javelin will play at the after-party. There will be a slew of street art-related happenings in the coming weeks too."

2008-05-02T00:00:00Z,"'STRETCH (A FANTASIA)' It was a most implausible explanation. Rose Mary Woods, President Richard M. Nixon's secretary, made the cover of Time magazine in 1973 after claiming that she had inadvertently pressed the wrong button on a tape recorder and then simultaneously kept her foot on a pedal control for the device while making an impossibly long stretch across her desk to answer a telephone. This gymnastic accident, she said, caused her to erase part of a tape famous for having an 18 1/2-minute gap: a crucial conversation between her boss and his chief of staff, H. R. Haldeman. In the June 20, 1972, conversation, the men were thought to have discussed the Watergate break-in, which occurred three days earlier, so theirs was a chat that the special counsel was eager to hear. Ms. Woods faded from the national scene. In 2005 she died at 87, in an Ohio nursing home, just after President Bush took office for a second term in the wake of accusations of voting irregularities, especially in Ohio. In ''Stretch (A Fantasia),'' her new political comic drama, Susan Bernfield has imagined Ms. Woods, played by Kristin Griffith, above, observing the 2004 presidential election, meshing past and present from the hazy viewpoint of an old woman who epitomized loyal servitude. ''I sort of feel like the point of the play is that politics goes in cycles,'' Ms. Bernfield said in a telephone interview."

In ''Secret Sunshine'' (2007), his best film to date, Mr. Lee takes his time, drawing out the sociological and psychological details embedded in his story of a young widow, Shin-ae (Jeon Do-yeon, above), who, with her young son in tow, has moved to the provincial hometown of her late husband. The residents of the town, Miryang (which translates to ''secret sunshine''), are cold and suspicious, and the only real attention she manages to attract comes from an unwelcome source: Jong-chan, a tubby, good-hearted auto mechanic (the immensely likable Song Kang-ho, of ''The Host'') ,who sees in her his last chance for marriage. But then something transcendently awful happens, which Mr. Lee records with no more emphasis than he gives to the petty annoyances and disappointments that otherwise define Shin-ae's life, and the film's subject snaps into focus: the arbitrariness of suffering, the indifference of the universe."

Next is ''Far ...,'' a solo by the French choreographer Rachid Ouramdane, above. He will trace his own history of identity and war, drawing on the diary his Algerian father kept while serving in the French Army during the occupation of Algeria, and later in Vietnam, in the years leading up to the war there. The terrain is similar, at least in outline. But Mr. Ouramdane is a conceptual creature, heady and cool and far removed from the earthy heat that Ms. Chipaumire inevitably brings to the stage; it should prove a fascinating contrast of ways and means."

2008-05-02T00:00:00Z,"WAYNE THIEBAUD: 'THE FIGURE' In the 1960s Wayne Thiebaud reanimated the traditional still life. His thickly painted pictures of pies, cakes and other food products in cafeteria-style order had terrific visual snap, and they subtly satirized the mechanization of modern life. Mr. Thiebaud did something similar with figure painting, as this excellent show of paintings and drawings dating from 1963 to 1992 demonstrates. The drawings are mostly in pencil, and most are coolly libidinous studies of nude female models. A few portray clothed men sitting on chairs, like ''Man Reading,'' right. All are compelling for their skillful draftsmanship and their detached yet affectionate attentiveness."

One reason is simply the injustice of keeping innocent people in abusive conditions -- a far harsher regime than that faced by convicted murderers in the United States. The inmates at Guantanamo haven't had visits or phone calls with family members for more than six years of confinement, and the authorities constantly play games with them. For example, one of those I mention in the column is al-Ghizzawi, a Libyan who is suffering from extreme health problems. The authorities boasted of giving him glasses. But, according to his lawyer, the glasses are distance glasses, when he is in confined to a tiny cell. What he desperately wants is reading glasses."

2008-05-04T00:00:00Z,"Just one word: plastics. The Japanese industrial-design star Tokujin Yoshioka was born in 1967, the year “The Graduate” had its premiere. The movie must have been an omen for him. After working with Shiro Kuramata and Issey Miyake, Yoshioka became strongly influenced by structure, transparency and the use of synthetics. His origami-like Honey-Pop chair from 2001, made for the Italian company Driade, is composed of 120 sheets of glassine paper that are compressed, cut and then spread open. His 2006 limited-edition Pane chair is made of polyester fibers baked like Italian bread. This month, the Museum of Modern Art Design Store is presenting “Destination: Japan,” a retail exhibition that includes home accessories. Slit Bag (above), a woven vinyl bag that has the illusion of depth even when flat, was originally designed by Yoshioka for the cover of a monograph of his work, which was published by Phaidon. MoMA decided it would be the perfect tote for the design-obsessed shopper — and, at $33, a bargain. MELISSA FELDMAN."

At Petersham Nurseries near Richmond, Surrey, a 15-minute train ride from central London, city folks longing for a country home — or perhaps a glimpse of Stella McCartney — roam the grounds while posh suburbanites from nearby Kew shop for garden supplies and make impromptu play dates around the communal table in a teahouse. The setting is quintessential shabby chic, with rambling greenhouses filled year-round with lush plants, garden antiques and design objects both exotic and familiar. In the main greenhouse, rickety tables hidden among plants form the setting for the chef Skye Gyngell’s lunch-only cafe, with an inspired menu featuring local and seasonal ingredients. (Reservations are mandatory.) A nearby toolshed has been converted into the teahouse, an inviting space for a cup of coffee, tea cakes or a bowl of soup served with Poilâne bread and farmhouse butter — the best way to battle the perpetually damp London air.

When it comes to his own wood-paneled, climate-controlled booze boutique (above), Le Dû doesn’t mind raising a glass to himself: “It is as close to a perfect wine shop as possible.” Or it will be when he finally hunts down a one-of-a-kind eau de vie. “I’m trying to find the absolute best bottle to import,” he says. “I’m not giving up.” We’ll drink to that.

2008-05-04T00:00:00Z,"John Lautner apprenticed with Frank Lloyd Wright, designed Bob Hope’s Palm Springs mansion and unwittingly spawned Googie, the futuristic style of Left Coast architecture based on a coffee shop of the same name. For more than 55 years, the architect created dwellings so site-specific they seemed to spring from the Los Angeles hills (the Sheats/Goldstein house) or touch down from a distant galaxy (the Marbrisa house, seen at right, or the Chemosphere house). His glass-and-poured-concrete masterpieces have co-starred in films, TV shows and even a video game. This summer, Lautner’s cult status gets an institutional imprimatur with the opening of the exhibition “Between Earth and Heaven: The Architecture of John Lautner” at the Hammer Museum in Los Angeles, from July 13 to Oct. 12. (The accompanying catalog, from Rizzoli, is available for $60.) Meanwhile, make like Vincent Gallo and Kelly Lynch and buy a Lautner original at architectureforsale.com.

2008-05-04T00:00:00Z,"For the Manhattan event planner David Monn, organizing a dinner party on the beach usually involves a tent, sofas and a dance floor. When entertaining in his own Sag Harbor, N.Y., backyard, however, things get a little less complicated. “For me, it’s the opposite of a large production,” says the man who’s orchestrated everything from the Met’s Costume Institute gala to the Plaza Hotel’s coming Grand Reopening Celebration and other intimate soirees. In either case, he first creates what he calls “imaginary architecture,” using torches, hurricane lanterns on pillars or lights strung in trees to make guests feel safe. Next he chooses one color element. “Constancy is where we derive our power image,” he notes. Can Monn purchase power among the offerings of CB2, Crate and Barrel’s cheap-and-cheerful offshoot? No problem. He quickly struck upon his color: “Live chartreuse green” — or Olivine, in CB2-speak — which works outdoors as a “continuation of what the eyes are already seeing.” In fact, he liked the textures and ease offered by CB2 so much, guests at one of the three beach weddings he’s organizing this summer should keep a (green) eye out.

2008-05-04T00:00:00Z,"Part treehouse, part oversize closet, the lollipop studios for one, known as Single Hauz, was dreamed up by Pawel Kobrynski, Wojciech Krawczuk and Marcin Sakson, a trio of Polish architects. Each elevated prefab is 6 feet by 20 feet; sliding French doors open into the main living area, with a kitchenette and enough room for a bed and a single chair; and a tiny bathroom is shoehorned into a windowless nook. It can be erected on almost any terrain, even on a lake. “The Single Hauz is a kind of architectural-social manifesto about single people,” Kobrynski says. But it can also provide a refuge even for the happily married, “because every one of us sometimes needs a place where we can be alone.” The Single Hauz has not yet found a manufacturer; for more information, go to frontarchitects.pl. MARK ELLWOOD."
2008-05-04T00:00:00Z,"With the opening of the Thompson LES hotel next month, Lee Friedlander will bring new meaning to the term “artist in residence.” Over each of the 141 beds in this downtown Manhattan hotel, a wall-mounted light box will illuminate black-and-white photographs from Friedlander’s apple and olive tree series, seven variants in all (including the one above). “Our approach was to integrate the work in an architectural context rather than treat it as an applied afterthought,” says the hotel’s interior designer, Jim Walrod. The photographer is in good company: the lobby features a giant color-field painting by Peter Halley, and at the bottom of the outdoor pool, Andy Warhol gazes up from a Gerard Malanga filmstrip that has been acid-etched into the tiles. So, while a handful of locals might bemoan the continuing gentrification of the Lower East Side, few can complain about the hotel’s artistic pedigree. BILL POWERS."

Kane spends most of his time working with his older sister, Tammy — who is also his accomplice, business partner and fit model — in a spacious but grungy East London loft that is best suited for sandwich deliveries. “My studio is so messy,” said Kane, rolling his eyes. “I have magazines and piles of stuff everywhere because I often start working on projects and don’t finish them. We would have had to eat on the floor.”."

2008-05-04T00:00:00Z,"Matthijs Vogels was frustrated by the amount of food people throw away after meals. So, for part of his masters thesis at the Design Academy Eindhoven in the Netherlands, the 27-year-old designer put his frustrations to work: he created a zero-waste restaurant installation. The temporary, small-scale project espoused the “cradle to cradle” philosophy, which embraces ecologically intelligent design as a means of turning waste into new products. “I did several crazy experiments,” Vogels says, and not everything worked out. But he did succeed in creating a series of bowls and plates called Waste-Ware that were hand-pressed out of left-over coffee grounds and herbs. Each biodegradable set doubles as a container; the coffee version is perfect for storing chocolates. To purchase, go to studiohergebruik.nl. S. KIRK WALSH."

But some wonder how high collectors will be willing to go. Consider this: In 1980 Wendell Cherry, a founder of the Humana health-care corporation, bought the painting at Christie's for $2.8 million. In 1996 Mr. Cherry's widow put it on the block at Sotheby's, where Mr. Kirkham bought it for $7.2 million. Now Sotheby's predicts this boldly colorful canvas, depicting a group of young women huddled together, will fetch $24 million to $28 million. ''Munch is one of those artists that people are finally recognizing for his position in the development of modern art,'' said Simon Shaw, head of Sotheby's Impressionist and modern art department in New York."

2008-05-04T00:00:00Z,"WHITE--Lawrence , innovative early producer of programming on radio and television, died on April 27, 2008 at the age of 94. He is survived by his wife of 71 years, Evelyn, their children Joshua, Deborah and Rebecca and grandchildren Mathew and Sarah Barnett. His long career in media arts began as an assistant to the legendary manager/producer Leland Heyward. Soon White was representing artists on his own including Walter Huston and Charles Laughton. Eventually he began to produce independently. He had the original idea of producing weekly radio series based on classic detective fiction like that of Dashiell Hammett. His first success was Sam Spade based on the detective in the book and movie, The Maltese Falcon. Sam Spade was quickly followed by a another series called ''The Fat Man'', in which an original detective in the Hammett style was successfully created. Both series ran for many years on CBS Radio. In the early fifties, White moved to the growing medium of television. He was the creator and sole producer of The Pinky Lee Show. At the height of its popularity, The Pinky Lee Show was broadcast six hours a week live on NBC. The legendary studio in Burbank currently occupied by The Tonight Show was built for Pinky. At the same time and in partnership with Leland Heyward he produced the ground breaking Ford 50th Anniversary Show, one of the very first ''specials'', which starred Ethel Merman and Mary Martin and was directed by Jerome Robbins. At the time, the show was so important that two networks, NBC and CBS both carried it live. Later, White was active in bringing Jazz to a huge audience by producing a series of classic Jazz Shows on Television sponsored by Timex watches. He also pioneered using Videotape at classic circuses in Europe, bringing them to America as ''International Showtime,'' a long running series hosted by Don Ameche on NBC. He is remembered for his originality, creativity and intelligence. Final services are incomplete."
2008-05-04T00:00:00Z,"I WAS a townie living very close to Harvard Square. I must have been around 19. The Harvard Square Theater was a revival house very much like the old Theater 80 St. Marks in Manhattan. It showed classic double features that changed daily. In those days the entrance to the theater was off Mass. Ave., and there was a long, narrow lobby with a decorative planter that ran down the center like a median strip. At some point the planter, which was filled with sand, had been adorned with plastic greenery, but by 1981 it had devolved into a giant ashtray. I was young and stupid and smoking cigarettes at the time. It was very early summer or late spring. It was humid and drizzling, and I was there to see ''Last Tango in Paris'' -- and I was alone."

The article lovingly evokes the enchantment of Rome on a grand but human scale. Strolling through Trastevere, the Tiber Island, the magnificent Campidoglio, and the cobblestoned streets, with both Romans and non-Romans, to soak in the eternal treasures of the city is the pinnacle of pleasure. Having lived in Rome for five years, although it was a long time ago, I still consider it to be my second home. Every time I return and stroll though my favorite haunts, I experience the thrill of the first time. I appreciate Mr. Fisher's reference to Georgina Masson, as her book ''Companion Guide to Rome'' was my companion in the late 60s."

Wart, an orphan and servant boy, is really the young King Arthur -- he just doesn't know it yet. Under the tutelage of the wizard Merlin he learns the most important things about being a future king; Merlin transforms him into various forest creatures -- a fish, a squirrel, a bird -- so he can experience life outside his own skin. This restored version is lovely to look at -- even the requisite dancing Disney sugar bowls somehow look fresh and sparkling. And it does justice to one of the great unsung animated sequences, in which Wart, in squirrel form, is pursued by a cheerful, chattering redheaded squirrelette. She has fallen madly in love with him, at first sight, but for obvious reasons he rebuffs her. When she sees he's not the squirrel for her -- he's not even a squirrel at all -- the disappointment on her face casts a pall, momentarily, on the entire magical forest. The camera pulls back to show her as a tiny forlorn figure, alone at the top of a tree, as Merlin explains to Wart that love is the most perplexing and complicated of all human emotions. Maybe that goes double for squirrels. (Walt Disney Video, June 17, $29.99) STEPHANIE ZACHAREK"

Our first real surprise, though, was the beer list, which included several offbeat microbrews on tap. The second was the wine list, featuring some interesting Italian, California and Washington State choices, well priced from $24 to $38 a bottle, or $4.99 to $9.50 by the glass."

2008-05-04T00:00:00Z,"R ICHARD PRINCE, whose retrospective last year at the Solomon R. Guggenheim Museum in New York won critical acclaim, is still considered a hot commodity. Yet it seems surprising that so many Princes have surfaced on the market recently, privately as well as at auction. Sotheby's and Christie's are both selling paintings from Mr. Prince's popular nurse series, images inspired by the covers of erotic pulp fiction of the 1940s. Some experts say the private sellers are hedge-fund managers who have supported Mr. Prince but are now facing tough times and need cash. Other collectors received overtures from auction houses they simply couldn't refuse. One of the nurse canvases belongs to Peter Brant, who has a large collection of Prince works, including other nurse paintings. Sotheby's is selling his ''Millionaire Nurse,'' depicting a blonde wearing a surgical mask. It is estimated to fetch $3.5 million to $4.5 million."

2008-05-04T00:00:00Z,"IF I hadn't already set my sights on being rebellious with my ''favorite summer movie'' choice (and had said choice limited to one), I would've undoubtedly picked Spike Lee's ''Do the Right Thing,'' a film that expertly captures the cruel, sweet insanity of a sweat-soaked Brooklyn during a heat wave. In that movie Mr. Lee got something more right than anybody ever had before: pure, raw heat. The only thing more pleasing, however, than a film that really feels like summer is one that is completely the opposite, but viewed during those blistering months. For a perfect summer moviegoing experience I would choose a brand-spanking-new print of David Lean's ''Dr. Zhivago,'' playing for one week only at Film Forum -- the Ziegfeld would be something else, but this isn't meant to be science fiction -- and only I and a few close friends (since I have only about six in the entire world) would know about it."

The second and third movies were repeats of past drive-in favorites, like ''Kelly's Heroes,'' which played there so often I'm convinced the theater must have held on to the print for years and never returned it.

Perhaps Jutra is so little known because of his aborted body of work.

2008-05-04T00:00:00Z,"Last fall offered the theatrical release of ''Control,'' Anton Corbijn's austere and deeply moving biopic about Ian Curtis, the lead singer of the revered Manchester, England, post-punk band Joy Division. Mr. Curtis killed himself in 1980, just as the group was about to embark on an American tour. He had been distressed by marital problems, and he suffered from epilepsy, which had only recently been diagnosed. It's a shame that the documentary ''Joy Division,'' directed by Grant Gee, couldn't have been released simultaneously with ''Control.'' The two pictures dovetail beautifully: Mr. Gee interviews the major players in Joy Division's story -- among them Tony Wilson, the television host (and founder of the seminal Factory Records, to which Joy Division was signed) who helped put the band on the map, as well as the group's three other members, who went on to form the more successful (and long-lived) band New Order. What Mr. Gee comes up with perfectly complements Mr. Corbijn's somewhat fictionalized take."

2008-05-04T00:00:00Z,"OH, HOW FAR SUPERHEROS have come. Born of tragedy (Batman), freak accident (Spider-Man), mythology (Wonder Woman) and mutant genes (the X-Men), these champions of justice have gone on to inspire cartoons, toys, video games, novels and films. *Now comes proof that superheros--from their color palettes to their insignias to their impossible physiques--have also played muse to fashion's biggest designers. This week, the Costume Institute of the Metropolitan Museum of Art will present ''Superheroes: Fashion and Fantasy'' (May 7 through Sept. 1), which spotlights more than 500 ensembles--from sportswear to haute couture to film costumes--that reflect a heroic ideal. * But the relationship between the worlds of fashion and cartoon avengers is hardly one-sided. In 1987, Mary Jane Watson married Peter Parker (Spider-Man) in a dress designed by Willi Smith. A decade later, costumes designed by Jean Paul Gaultier were used in the geek-friendly sci-fi adventure film ''The Fifth Element.'' Donna Karan recently hired Paul Pope, a critically acclaimed comic-book artist, to design for DKNY Jeans. And that's not all. The desire to right wrongsin hot-looking outfits inspired the eight new heroines pictured here. It goes without saying that their clothes, all from the fall 2008 collections are, well, Super. Or, in the words of Edna Mode, the cartoon designer in the ''The Incredibles'' and noted hater of capes: ''Superheroes are easy, darling. Mediocrity is much more difficult to work with.'' -- GEORGE GENE GUSTINES"

2008-05-04T00:00:00Z,"S OME dealers must have gulped when they saw that the most expensive painting in Christie's May 6 Impressionist and modern art auction is a Monet, not a modern work. In a sense Christie's seems to be swimming against the tide. (The most expensive work in Sotheby's sale of Impressionist and modern art is a 1912-13 Léger, ''Étude Pour 'La Femme en Bleu,' '' which carries a $35 million to $45 million estimate.) Yet the Monet, ''Le Pont du Chemin de Fer à Argenteuil,'' depicting two puffing locomotives, was considered unabashedly modern in its time. In 1988 Stavros Niarchos, the Greek shipping magnate, sold it for $12.6 million at Christie's in London to the Nahmads, dealers with galleries in New York and London. Defending the house's decision to give this painting a starring role, Guy Bennett, co-head of Impressionist and modern art at Christie's worldwide, said the work was a seminal one for Monet. He said Monet produced only three other comparable paintings of the subject. One is in the National Gallery of Art in Washington, another in the Philadelphia Museum of Art and the third in the Musée d'Orsay in Paris. ''I still believe there are buyers for top Impressionist paintings,'' he added."

Curiously, fewer examples of today's hot Chinese contemporary artists are on offer than a year ago, but Sotheby's contemporary sale on May 14 includes examples by two of today's most sought-after artists from Russia and India. Erik Bulatov, a Russian born in 1933, is being represented for the first time with his painting ''New York.''

Even after the children spread their wings, they still talked to their mother many times a day seeking her wise counsel on all matters great and small.

2008-05-04T00:00:00Z,"BRAD LIDGE, the closer for the Philadelphia Phillies, seems determined to prove that F. Scott Fitzgerald was wrong when he said there were no second acts in American lives. Once considered among the best relief pitchers in baseball, Lidge gave up a dramatic gameending homer to ALBERT PUJOLS in the 2005 National League Championship Series, and from that point seemed to lose his ability to close out big games. In 2006, he had 32 saves, but his earned run average rose to 5.28 from 2.29 the season before. Then in 2007, he lost his job for part of the season and blew 8 of 27 save opportunities. But Lidge has looked as dominant as ever since being traded to Philadelphia in November. He had pitched in 13 games through Friday and had not allowed an earned run. He was striking out nearly a batter per inning and was 7 for 7 in save opportunities. The only problem he has had this season is that he began it on the disabled list. Joining Lidge in the small group of pitchers still carrying a 0.00 E.R.A. is another player clearly in his second act, 38- year-old TROY PERCIVAL of the Tampa Bay Rays. Percival had made 10 appearances and was 6 for 6 in save opportunities despite having been retired for the 2006 season and pitching 34 games in middle relief for the St. Louis Cardinals last season.

2008-05-04T00:00:00Z,"If it's possible to make an elegant movie about suicidal depression, Louis Malle did it with his 1963 ''Fire Within.'' Maurice Ronet plays an alcoholic who has taken the cure, successfully, it seems, although almost from the start we know something's not right: he makes references to an estranged wife, and there's a strange date, July 23, written on his mirror in loopy script, a runelike reminder to himself that he sees every time he looks at his own face. With Erik Satie on the soundtrack -- the score shimmers through the movie like an invisible question mark -- Ronet drifts around Paris on his last day alive, reconnecting with old friends and lovers. One of these is Jeanne Moreau, so full of life when we first see her (in a bobbed haircut and almost comically heavy-rimmed glasses) that it's a jolt to us -- as it seems to crush Ronet -- when we watch her losing herself to the effects of opium."

In the winter I wade through Academy fare that is becoming increasingly dark and depressing. I don't look forward to spending time with crazed killers and nutty oilmen. I've had enough of that living through the Bush years. No, I wait for summer to kick back with what is fast becoming an endangered species: the smart adult comedy. Over past summers I've revisited the Preston Sturges and Billy Wilder classics, the Hepburn-Tracy oeuvre, my beloved ''Annie Hall'' and ''Tootsie.'' This summer I'll be watching, for the umpteenth time, ''The Graduate.'' I was a sophomore in college when ''The Graduate'' was released in 1967. The Vietnam War was escalating, and campuses were on simmer approaching boil. And here comes Benjamin Braddock, a newly minted college grad, re-entering life in suburban Los Angeles without any idea of what to do with his future. What kind of hero was this? Short, dark, not-so-handsome and totally conflicted? What kind of storytelling was this, taking us from brilliant satire to broad comedy to heartbreak, sometimes in the same scene? Suddenly my plan to graduate with a degree in education because it was ''a good and stable occupation for a woman'' seemed wrong. The ground was shaking under everyone's feet, and everything was fair game for questioning."

Seeking to raise money to buy another paper mill, he hit up both Sotheby's and Christie's for substantial guarantees. Experts familiar with the deals say Sotheby's came through with between $70 million and $80 million in exchange for various paintings and sculptures. Christie's got a share of art too, providing Mr. Brant with a reported $35 million. Mr. Brant's collection boasts hundreds of works by artists like Andy Warhol, Jean-Michel Basquiat, John Chamberlain, Richard Prince and Jeff Koons. It may appear that he is unloading the bulk of what he owns, but the art being sold now amounts to only a fraction of his holdings. Among the best for sale is Lichtenstein's ''Ball of Twine,'' a 1963 painting. Mr. Brant bought it in 2001 at Sotheby's for $4 million, the highest price paid for a work in that sale. Now it is estimated at $14 million to $18 million."

In an e-mail message Curtis notified lawyers that ESPN did not have a license to use the painting and was committing willful copyright infringement, the lawsuit said. Court documents said that the painting was shown full screen in the second episode, ''Team in Turmoil,'' and that the series had since been sold in DVD and VHS format.

The painting, one of more than 300 created by Rockwell for The Saturday Evening Post, first appeared in the April 23, 1949, issue and was donated to the National Baseball Hall of Fame & Museum in Cooperstown, N.Y."

On behalf of all our members we express our deepest sympathy to Jim and their entire family. Lew Kramer, President Willa S. Rosenberg, Secretary WOOLNER--Gertrude, age 83, beautiful in every way, passed away on May 6, 2008 at Sarah Neuman Center. Trudy was the loved and loving wife of Jim Woolner since July 1945 and was adored also by Dan Woolner of Vail, Colorado, Steve and Andrea Woolner of Sharon, Massachusetts and their son, almost two years old James Thomas Woolner, known as J.T. She also was a close friend of Jim's sister, Mary Kaufman and Jim's brother, Dr. William Woolner and all the nieces and nephews who idolized her. Trudy and Jim's eldest son Jim Jr. died in 1998 and is remembered every day. Trudy was born in Peoria, Illinois, grew up in Chicago, graduated from Francis Parker School and was accepted by Smith, Vassar and Wellesley. She graduated from Smith in 1946 after marrying Jim in July, 1945 when the 95th Infantry Division was brought home from the ETO through the U.S. on its way to the invasion of Japan. Fortunately President Truman ordered the atomic bombs dropped, ending World War II. Trudy went back to Smith to graduate since Jim didn't get out of the army until November 1946. Trudy worked for The League of Women Voters for two years in New York City and then taught Remedial Reading at the Edgewood School in the Scarsdale School System for 22 years, which she loved. Fairview Country Club in Greenwich was the center of her social life, a place she loved and where she was an active member since 1946, playing a lot of Tennis year-round as well as bridge. She became a proficient skier and went to Vail almost every year from the early 60s until 1980. Trudy and Jim took nine White Water River wilderness trips in Oregon and Idaho with friends from Portland, Oregon. These trips averaged five days and the trip through rivers in British Columbia was 13 days of what was called ''BigWater'', camping along the shore each night on every trip. Trudy and Jim visited Russia, Afghanistan, Nepal, India and Hong Kong in 1970 with Jim Jr. and went to China for two weeks on business in 1976 when only 500 Caucasians per month could get Visas. They also took Dan and Steve on a trip to Japan, Thailand, Malaysia and Hong Kong in 1975. She had her guide take her to elementary schools in almost every country she visited. Funeral Services for Trudy will be held on Friday May 9th, 12 Noon. at Temple Emanu-El of Westchester, 2125 Westchester Ave East, Rye, New York (914) 967-4382."

2008-05-07T00:00:00Z,"ELLIS--Charles R. Peter Booth Wiley, Chairman of the Board of Directors of John Wiley & Sons, Inc.; William J. Pesce, President and CEO; the Board of Directors; and Wiley colleagues around the world are greatly saddened by the death of Charles R. Ellis, 72, who led our company from the difficult days of the late 1980s into the sustained period of growth and profitability that continues into the present. A publisher by temperament and trade, Ellis served as Wiley's President and CEO from 1990-98 and was instrumental in bringing about the company's revival and initiating its transition to a truly global corporation. On his watch, Wiley became profitable again; executed major strategic acquisitions including VCH Publishing Group, Alan R. Liss, and JosseyBass; was listed on the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE: JWa); and launched its first online ventures. In the year of Charles's retirement, the Financial Times ranked Wiley as the world's 27th most respected company. Beyond his role in Wiley's resurgence, Charles has acted as an influential advocate for the worldwide publishing community. With a cosmopolitan perspective enhanced by European postings with Pergamon Press and Elsevier in his pre-Wiley days, Charles was President of the International Publishers Association. He was also Chair of the Association of American Publishers from 1992-94; in 1998, he received the AAP's highest honor, the Curtis Benjamin Award. He was an avid supporter of the Digital Object Identifier, a code embedded in digital content that helped lay the groundwork for publishing online; and worked tirelessly on behalf of intellectual property rights. Those fortunate to have known and worked with this charming, gracious, and diplomatic man will miss him terribly. On behalf of the entire Wiley community, we extend our deepest condolences to his wife, Sandi, and their family. In lieu of flowers, donations to World Education, Inc., 44 Farnsworth Street, Boston, MA 02210 (wei@worlded.org) are requested."

2008-05-07T00:00:00Z,"HALL--James C. The dean, faculty, staff, and students of the Lubin School of Business at Pace University extend our heartfelt sympathy to the family and friends of James C. Hall, former Associate Dean and Director of Graduate Programs, Associate Dean for Planning and Assessment, and Professor of Management and Management Science at Lubin. Jim joined Pace in 1979 after earning his MA and Ph.D. degrees in Adult Education at the University of Chicago. He oversaw all of the Lubin School's full-and part-time graduate programs: MBA, MS, EMBA, and DPS; the assessment of undergraduate and graduate learning outcomes; and reaccreditation by AACSB International, The Association to Advance Collegiate Schools of Business. Typically, MBA classes focus on single disciplines like accounting, finance, or marketing. Jim was one of a team of six faculty members who designed and implemented Lubin's problem - centered Executive MBA program (EMBA), lauded by the AACSB Peer Review Team as ''highly innovative, ahead of its time, and unique in the marketplace.'' The approach has become a touchstone for Lubin instruction. Jim was, above all, a teacher who enjoyed nothing more than being in the classroom. Lubin and Pace have become far richer institutions of learning for his involvement and guidance, and he will be remembered for his positive impact on the way business schools teach. He will be greatly missed. Jim's wife, Julia, survives him, as do his stepchildren, Julia Ashenhurst of Chicago, Illinois; Martha Ashenhurst-Lundin of LaGrange, Illinois; David Ashenhurst of Oberlin, Ohio; and John Ashenhurst of Yonago, Japan; and four grandchildren. A memorial service will be held on Pace's downtown New York City campus, in the lobby of the Michael Schimmel Center for the Arts, 3 Spruce Street, on Wednesday, May 28, from 4pm to 6pm. A fund is being created in Jim Hall's memory to benefit graduate program development. If you would like to contribute, please send a check drawn to Pace University to the attention of Dean Joseph R. Baczko, Lubin School of Business, Pace University, 1 Pace Plaza, New York, NY 10038."

The only child of Bertha and Lawrence Heyl (Associate Librarian at Princeton University), Larry was a graduate of Princeton Country Day, Lawrenceville, and Princeton (class of 1940). He joined the 9th Division of the Army in January 1941, landing at Normandy on June 12, 1944, following training in England, where he met a British private, Jean, at a dance in Winchester. They married four years later in NYC, while he was Associate Editor of Theatre Arts. Larry was a skilled photographer in the style of Cartier-Bresson, capturing the lives, in black and white, of his family, friends and Rockland County artists. He served on the boards of the Rockland Foundation and Edward Hopper House, and edited Nyack in Black & White (2005). Larry spent most of his career in the oil industry, first at Texaco and API, and then at Mobil, heading Investor Relations. A foe of artifice, prejudice, solecisms, superstition, and poor lighting, Larry is deeply missed by Jean, his wife of 60 years (now of Kendal in Sleepy Hollow), his two surviving children, Margery Heyl (director of Nonotuck Community School in Northampton, MA.) and Dorothy Heyl (a lawyer at Milbank Tweed) and their husbands, and his five grandchildren, Julie and Molly Heyl-Rushmer, Regina Heyl DePietro, and Emily and Gregory Nichols (children of Catherine Heyl, d. 1998).

On the other, aromatherapy - mono-themed smells, generally built in minimalist (if not inchoate) style and structure, meant simply to hypnotize like the single, pulsing tone of a Buddhist bowl, lulling into a state of non-thought. Where perfumes seek to convey ideas, aromas are designed to produce the opposite outcome, intentionally tamping down thought: the scent concept of being free of scent concepts."

Under his leadership, the Catholic Medical Center became the largest voluntary health care provider in New York, and one of the largest in the United States. CMC comprised four hospitals and three longterm care facilities, which included a total of 1,695 beds and the largest hospital based home care program in the country. During Mr. Conway's presidency, four hospitals were remodeled or replaced and 18 Family Health Centers were established in medically undeserved areas of Brooklyn and Queens. In addition, the School of Nursing, as well as schools for emergency medical service technicians, radiological technicians and laboratory technicians were organized. CMC also included a substantial substance abuse program. Mr. Conway also oversaw businesses as diverse as a ''captive'' insurance company, a Medicaid managed care program and the Kennedy Medical offices at JFK International Airport. Before his tenure at CMC, Mr. Conway served as executive director of Knickerbocker Hospital in New York City (1960-70) and as administrative assistant at Roosevelt Hospital in New York (1954-60). He was named President Emeritus of the Catholic Medical Center (now St. Vincent's Catholic Medical Center) upon his retirement. He received a BA in management at City College of New York and an MS in hospital administration at Columbia University. He served with the Army in Europe in the Second World War. Mr. Conway was a consultant and lecturer to professional groups and health care organizations in the United States, Europe and the Far East. He was past president of the New York State Catholic Healthcare Council. He participated in various state and national policy groups, including the House of Delegates of the American Hospital Association and the Regent's Advisory Council of the American College of Healthcare Executives. Mr. Conway's publications dealt with diverse issues of health care administration including the future of the multi-hospital system and an article on the career of the physician-pope, John XXI. He was a Life Fellow of the American College of Healthcare Executives. In 1995, he was awarded the B'Nai Birth Distinguished Achievement Award for his lifetime of accomplishment in health care and the Samaritan Foundation bestowed its annual award to him for outstanding achievement in administration. Mr. Conway was named Fellow of the Year of the New York American College of Hospital Administrators in 1985.

She was best known for her profiles of celebrities, published in newspapers and magazines in the U.S. and the UK, including the New York Times, the Los Angeles Times, the London Times, the Sunday Times of London magazine, the Observer, New York Magazine, Cosmopolitan, US, Playboy and Time Out. She wrote about some of the entertainment world's biggest stars, but equally enjoyed seeking out younger performers before they became household names. All who knew Joan considered her to be a fascinating individual. She was a priceless raconteur, but resisted the temptation to sensationalize what was told to her in confidence -a trait that endeared her to the subjects of her portraits. While claiming ignorance of figures, she occasionally admitted to her age and to her children. She is survived by two sons, Andrew and Michael Goodman, a daughter, Wendy Thum, and four grandchildren. Family visitation will be at the Barrett Funeral Home on West 51st Street on May 10, from 8:45 to 10:45, followed by a funeral mass at the Church of St Paul the Apostle at 11:15.

Pesce, President and CEO; the Board of Directors; and Wiley colleagues around the world are greatly saddened by the death of Charles R. Ellis, 72, who led our company from the difficult days of the late 1980s into the sustained period of growth and profitability that continues into the present. A publisher by temperament and trade, Ellis served as Wiley's President and CEO from 1990-98 and was instrumental in bringing about the company's revival and initiating its transition to a truly global corporation. On his watch, Wiley became profitable again; executed major strategic acquisitions including VCH Publishing Group, Alan R. Liss, and JosseyBass; was listed on the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE: JWa); and launched its first online ventures. In the year of Charles's retirement, the Financial Times ranked Wiley as the world's 27th most respected company. Beyond his role in Wiley's resurgence, Charles has acted as an influential advocate for the worldwide publishing community. With a cosmopolitan perspective enhanced by European postings with Pergamon Press and Elsevier in his pre-Wiley days, Charles was President of the International Publishers Association. He was also Chair of the Association of American Publishers from 1992-94; in 1998, he received the AAP's highest honor, the Curtis Benjamin Award. He was an avid supporter of the Digital Object Identifier, a code embedded in digital content that helped lay the groundwork for publishing online; and worked tirelessly on behalf of intellectual property rights. Those fortunate to have known and worked with this charming, gracious, and diplomatic man will miss him terribly. On behalf of the entire Wiley community, we extend our deepest condolences to his wife, Sandi, and their family. In lieu of flowers, donations to World Education, Inc., 44 Farnsworth Street, Boston, MA 02210 (wei@worlded.org) are requested.

A graduate of Princeton University, Charles began his career teaching at a preparatory school and working for Bertrand Russell, the British philosopher and activist. Charles soon found a balance between the intellectual life and concerns of making a living by turning to publishing. After successful stints in executive positions at Pergamon Press, D.C. Heath, and Elsevier Science Publishing Company, he joined John Wiley & Sons, Inc, in 1988, where he served as the President and CEO from 1990-98. A sophisticated and diplomatic man, Charles was an influential advocate for the worldwide publishing community through his work the International Publishers Association and the Association of American Publishers and on behalf of intellectual property rights; in 1998, he received the AAP's highest honor, the Curtis Benjamin Award.

Now, thanks to a host of new and improved waterproof backpacks, their gear can also hit the water -- and still stay dry. Canoe-camping and canoe-hiking are rising in popularity among paddlers, according to Martin Bartels, the executive director of the American Canoe Association. This season's packs are designed to make both activities easier. Among the features are seamless construction, waterproof vinyl and nylon fabrics, roll-top and zipper-like closures to seal out moisture, and padded straps to help shoulder the load on portages and day hikes. ''Lighter and more efficient gear adds to the pleasure of an outing,'' Mr. Bartels said."

2008-05-09T00:00:00Z,"REGGIE WILSON AND ANDRÉYA OUAMBA In August the financial district got a taste of what a collaboration between Reggie Wilson and Andréya Ouamba, from left above, might entail, when ''Accounting for Customs'' received several free lunchtime showings on the steps of the United States Custom House. The brief dance was both visually lush and historically resonant, with lines of performers executing wonderfully inventive phrases up, down and across the imposing stone steps. At one point a dancer scrambled up one of the sheer walls buttressing the staircase, as if trying to reach the giant seated monument above. Failing to gain purchase, she slid back to the ground. ''There is only so much we can do to reinvent our circumstances,'' the beautiful, Sisyphean action seemed to suggest. ''History won't be denied.'' ''Accounting for Customs'' was like a notebook sketch for ''The Good Dance,'' which the Brooklyn Academy of Music will present at its 2009 Next Wave festival. This week, in a program titled ''Kwenda Vutuka (Come Go Return),'' these choreographers are showing a more substantial work in progress excerpt of the piece, along with repertory from their respective companies. Mr. Wilson's Fist & Heel Performance Group, from Brooklyn, will offer two solos, ''Untitled,'' for the captivating Rhetta Aleong, and ''Introduction,'' a much-beloved piece performed by Mr. Wilson. In the New York premiere of his Senegalese Compagnie 1er Temps, the Congolese-born Mr. Ouamba will dance ''Impro-Visé 2,'' a duet with Fatou Cisse."

2008-05-09T00:00:00Z,"'JAZZ GIANTS: THE PHOTOGRAPHY OF HERMAN LEONARD' There have been many great jazz photographers but none more accomplished than Herman Leonard. In a celebrated career that began in the late 1940s, Mr. Leonard, now in his mid-80s, is responsible for some of the music's defining images. His geometrically balanced musician portraits in particular, with their suggestions of cool composure, have long captured what seemed like the essence of jazz, at least in its golden age. Try to conjure the drummer Art Blakey in the mind's eye, and you might well summon him as captured in a photograph by Mr. Herman from 1958: head tilted back, mouth agape, arms in mid-flail. Or consider Dexter Gordon, whose most famous portrait, above, perfectly distills his air of roguish charm and watchful ease. Or think of Lester Young, whom Mr. Leonard once implied by photographing only his personal effects: tenor saxophone case, porkpie hat and a lighted cigarette resting on the lip of an empty soda bottle. It's an ingenious still life and a shrewd act of portraiture in absentia."

The stones in the ''Jewelry on Screen'' film series are diamonds, emeralds and pearls. But craft or carats, beautiful objects so desirable that they cry out to be touched (and copied or stolen) provide plenty of drama. Descend to Café Fledermaus to view the jewel-encrusted stars. The 1955 film ''To Catch a Thief'' (Friday and May 16) is even better than you may remember: Cary Grant and Grace Kelly, above, as Hitchcock-directed cat and mouse on the Côte d'Azur, caught by the Oscar-winning cinematography of Robert Burks. At the start Kelly is jewelry-free in Edith Head ensembles, and Grant's tanned neck is the one to admire, with a red-and-white foulard tucked neatly into his striped pullover. Kelly's neckline redeems itself, of course, in the scene in which she strokes her dazzling necklace and purrs ''di-a-monds'' as a three-syllable word, followed by ''the only thing in the world you can't resist.''

2008-05-09T00:00:00Z,"ERNST LUDWIG KIRCHNER: 'THE UNEXPECTED NEW: LATE PAINTINGS' The German Expressionist painter Ernst Ludwig Kirchner is best known for his riotous Berlin street scenes, all sharp elbows and clashing colors. His later paintings, created after a move from Germany to Davos, Switzerland, and a long recovery from a nervous breakdown, appear less strident. Some 20 of these works, made between 1921 and 1935, are on view in this exhibition at the Michael Werner gallery. From the relative isolation of the Swiss Alps, Kirchner seems to be channeling Matisse in the patterned tablecloth of ''Wine Glass'' (1927-29) and Picasso in the conjoined bodies of ''Singer at the Piano'' and ''Eaters'' (both 1930). Kirchner's flattened, curvilinear forms also betray a less avant-garde influence, that of the turn-of-the-20th-century Jugendstil decorative arts movement."

The Trustees, staff, and volunteers of Educational Broadcasting Corporation (EBC), licensee of Thirteen/WNET and WLIW New York, are deeply saddened by the loss of John Jay Iselin, a man whose passion and leadership were a transformative force for this institution and all of public television. It was during Jay's remarkable tenure as President that ''Channel 13'' became an icon of culture and lifelong learning throughout the New York metropolitan community. From 1973 through 1987, Jay built WNET into America's leading producer of programming for the Public Broadcasting Service and led the creation of many of the programs that have given public television its indelible reputation for quality, integrity and independence. ''Great Performances'', ''Live From Lincoln Center'', ''Nature'', ''The NewsHour'' and ''Bill Moyers Journal'' all sprang to life under Jay's guidance, each adding an illustrious new chapter to the history of American television. Throughout his life, Jay cultivated the kind of cultural and humanistic vision upon which public television and all our society's highest aspirations rest. We extend our most profound sympathies to Jay's wife, Lea, and to their entire family. Every day, as we work to create media that illuminates and inspires, we honor Jay's phenomenal legacy. We will be forever influenced by his vision. James S. Tisch Chairman Neal Shapiro President and CEO ISELIN--John Jay. The Trustees, faculty, students and staff of The Cooper Union for the Advancement of Science and Art note with deep sorrow the passing of the College's tenth president.

Son of William Jay and Fanny (Humphreys) Iselin, he was born in Greenville, SC and graduated from Saint Mark's School and Harvard College, class of 1956. He received a law degree from Cambridge University (Corpus Christi) which he attended as a Marshall Fellow, and a Ph.D. in Government from Harvard University in 1964. During his long and distinguished career in New York, he was National Affairs editor of Newsweek, editor of the trade division of Harper & Row before joining WNET/Channel 13 as general manager in 1971. He served as President of the public television station from 1973 to 1987 where he oversaw its transformation into a major force in the broadcasting world. In 1988, he was appointed President of the Cooper Union in New York, where he remained for 12 years, completing a $50 million capital campaign and endowing several new professorships. In 2000, he became President of the Marconi Society which, based at Columbia University, promotes innovation in telecommunications. Iselin remained on its board until his death. He was a longtime trustee of the Josiah C. Macy Jr. Foundation, the National Geographic Society, The Cathedral of Saint John the Divine, Waterford Institute and The New York State Archives Partnership Trust, and a member of the Council on Foreign Relations and the Advisory Council of Storm King Art Center. Throughout his life he was passionately involved in New York civil affairs and remained devoted to Harvard where he had been an overseer and to Cambridge University and the Marshall Fellowships. In 2004, he was appointed honorary Commander of the British Empire by Queen Elizabeth II. He was a member of the Century Association and the Harvard Club of New York. He was also beloved in Columbia County, NY and in Vinalhaven, Maine where he summered with his family for over 40 years. He is survived by his wife of 51 years, Lea, five children: William of Paris, Benjamin and his wife Cathy of Brooklyn, Josie and her husband Ken Pearce of San Francisco, Fannie Minot of South Hamilton, MA, Alison Russell and her husband Dan of Brooklyn and thirteen grandchildren.
