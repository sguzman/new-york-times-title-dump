2009-06-18T00:00:00Z,"WAGNER--Martin, labor arbitrator, university leader and influential scholar died on Tuesday in his home. He was 97 and lived in Urbana, Illinois. Professor Wagner served as director of the Institute of Labor and Industrial Relations (now the School of Labor and Employment Relations) at the University of Illinois, Urbana-Champaign, from 1958 to 1968. He continued as a professor until 1982, when he retired and was awarded emeritus status. Wagner played a central role in the development of public sector labor relations laws for the state of Illinois, including five years of service as chairman of the Illinois Educational Labor Relations Board and leadership on numerous state and regional federal commissions and boards on training, labor-management relations, unemployment, wage-price controls, civil service, and related matters. Early in his career, Wagner served in the WWII Office of Production Management and as a regional director for the National Labor Relations Board in San Francisco and Cincinnati. In 1948, he served as the founding executive director of the Louisville Labor-Management Committee, the nation's first area labor-management committee. In that same year, he was a founding member of the Industrial Relations Research Association (now the Labor and Employment Relations Association), which recently honored Wagner with its lifetime achievement award. He was also recognized recently for 50 years of service in the National Academy of Arbitrators (NAA), a rare accomplishment as individuals are only inducted into the NAA after they have already achieved prominence in the profession. The International Brotherhood of Electrical Workers (IBEW) provided Wagner with a Lifetime Membership Award in 1996, a particularly significant accomplishment for a labor neutral. At the School of Labor and Employment Relations at the University of Illinois, Wagner launched one of the early doctoral programs in industrial relations in 1966. He was beloved by former students and colleagues alike and is seen as having provided the core ""dna"" for what is one of the nation's top programs in labor and employment relations. Born on September 11, 1911, in Newport Kentucky, Wagner earned A.B. and M.A. degrees from the University of Michigan in 1933 and 1935 respectively. He was a Rhodes Scholar, (Magdalen '36) earning a B.A. from Oxford University in 1937 and later an M.A. from Oxford in 1960. At the 100th anniversary celebration of the Rhodes Scholar program in 2003, Martin Wagner was the third oldest recipient in attendance. Wagner is survived by his son John, of Orlando, FL, his daughter Martha Wagner Weinberg, of Brookline, MA, and two grandchildren, David and Katy Weinberg. His wife Nelle Nordstrom Wagner preceded him in death in 1997. A commemorative celebration of Martin Wagner's life and accomplishments is on Saturday morning, September 12th in the Martin Wagner Education Center at the School of Labor and Employment Relations, University of Illinois, Urbana-Champaign, with a memorial service to follow on that weekend."

2009-06-18T00:00:00Z,"INSECT bites that itch, turn red and swell are a common malady of the summer. What causes the itch is the body's release of histamines as an immune-system response to the bite. ''Mosquitoes inject their saliva as an anticoagulant, and the protein antigens, or toxins, in the saliva is what the body is reacting against,'' said Dr. Dirk Elston, a dermatologist in Danville, Pa., who has studied the pathology of insect bites. ''So the vast majority of bug bite reactions is largely allergic.'' To combat the allergic reactions, pharmaceutical and skin care companies offer topical antihistamines or anti-inflammatories, which now are combined with skin soothers like oatmeal, or can be applied as a spray instead of a cream. Other companies, taking a cue from the growing market for ''all natural'' formulations, rely on plant extracts and essential oils to reduce irritation. Dr. Elston pointed out that that the folk remedy of using Preparation H hemorrhoid cream on insect bites is well founded because one of its ingredients, pramoxine, is a painkiller."

2009-06-18T00:00:00Z,"GILSON--Stanley B.,Jr., also known as ""Gil"", died peacefully at his home in NYC on April 18, 2009 of Park- inson's disease. He was 84. At Gil's request no funeral was held and his ashes will be spread in the same place as his first wife, Sheila Bakerman. Gil was born in Cleveland, Ohio, on December 25, 1924. He moved to New York City in 1953. During his lifetime, he was a musician, a writer, a photographer, an actor and a talent agent. He is survived by his stepson, Robert Bland, his sister-in-law, Jane Bakerman, his niece Debbie Siskin, his nephew Lenny Siskin, his brother-in-law Michael Siskin and his cousins from the Diener side of the family: Jim, Nathalie, Ruth, Ken, Linda, and Sam. Gil had no children. Gil served in the United States Army during World War II, serving as acting first sergeant, supply sergeant, and mess sergeant for one detachment of 250 German prisoners of War in Fort Leonard Wood, Missouri. Gil would often joke about why he spoke English so well--because the German prisoners (many of whom were educated in the U.S.) would correct his English whenever he spoke to them. Gil received a Victory Medal, American Theatre Ribbon and a Good Conduct Medal before he was honorably discharged in 1946. As a freelance writer, Gil published over 2,000 articles in trade magazines, ranging from the oil industry to the healthcare industry. He quickly learned if he took pictures for his articles, he would make more money. So he learned photography as well. Gil, we will miss your wit, your humor and your generosity. We can no longer laugh in your presence, but we are quite certain that somebody is laughing in yours. Rest in peace, my friend."

According to its equally low-budget television pitch, the Yugoslavian car was tailor-made for students (though the student in the ad looked a bit too young to drive), couples, single men and women, which covered nearly everyone. So what if the heated rear windows were more useful as a hand warmer when you pushed the car."

2009-06-19T10:21:49Z,"The Boston Globe's largest union has set a date for a contract ratification vote, though there is no agreement on a contract. The Boston Newspaper Guild sent a memo to members late Thursday, telling them that it had scheduled a vote for July 20. The guild and The Globe are still negotiating on a package of pay and benefit cuts, with face-to-face talks set to resume Monday, and people briefed on the discussions say a deal is close. But in the meantime, The Globe's owner, The New York Times Company, is insisting that a 23 percent pay cut is in effect for Guild members. The company unilaterally imposed the cut after guild members narrowly rejected a previous package of concessions, including a 10.3 percent salary reduction and deep cuts in benefits. The guild has challenged the unilateral cut with a complaint to the federal regulators, but that could take years to resolve. Guild bylaws require a 30-day wait before a contract proposal is voted on, and the 23 percent cut -- which will show up in paychecks sent out next week -- gives the union an incentive to start that clock ticking as soon as possible. So betting on the chance that the two sides will strike a deal early next week, the guild set a date for a vote. People briefed on the talks say negotiators have the outlines of a deal similar to the one that was rejected, but with a smaller pay cut in the range of 7 or 8 percent. The major stumbling block, they say, is dealing with the 23 percent cut, which would have been in effect for more than a month. The guild wants to find a way to repay some or all of that money to its members."

2009-06-19T00:00:00Z,"WAGNER--Martin, labor arbitrator, university leader and influential scholar died on Tuesday in his home. He was 97 and lived in Urbana, Illinois. Professor Wagner served as director of the Institute of Labor and Industrial Relations (now the School of Labor and Employment Relations) at the University of Illinois, Urbana-Champaign, from 1958 to 1968. He continued as a professor until 1982, when he retired and was awarded emeritus status. Wagner played a central role in the development of public sector labor relations laws for the state of Illinois, including five years of service as chairman of the Illinois Educational Labor Relations Board and leadership on numerous state and regional federal commissions and boards on training, labor-management relations, unemployment, wage-price controls, civil service, and related matters. Early in his career, Wagner served in the WWII Office of Production Management and as a regional director for the National Labor Relations Board in San Francisco and Cincinnati. In 1948, he served as the founding executive director of the Louisville Labor-Management Committee, the nation's first area labor-management committee. In that same year, he was a founding member of the Industrial Relations Research Association (now the Labor and Employment Relations Association), which recently honored Wagner with its lifetime achievement award. He was also recognized recently for 50 years of service in the National Academy of Arbitrators (NAA), a rare accomplishment as individuals are only inducted into the NAA after they have already achieved prominence in the profession. The International Brotherhood of Electrical Workers (IBEW) provided Wagner with a Lifetime Membership Award in 1996, a particularly significant accomplishment for a labor neutral. At the School of Labor and Employment Relations at the University of Illinois, Wagner launched one of the early doctoral programs in industrial relations in 1966. He was beloved by former students and colleagues alike and is seen as having provided the core ""dna"" for what is one of the nation's top programs in labor and employment relations. Born on September 11, 1911, in Newport Kentucky, Wagner earned A.B. and M.A. degrees from the University of Michigan in 1933 and 1935 respectively. He was a Rhodes Scholar, (Magdalen '36) earning a B.A. from Oxford University in 1937 and later an M.A. from Oxford in 1960. At the 100th anniversary celebration of the Rhodes Scholar program in 2003, Martin Wagner was the third oldest recipient in attendance. Wagner is survived by his son John, of Orlando, FL, his daughter Martha Wagner Weinberg, of Brookline, MA, and two grandchildren, David and Katy Weinberg. His wife Nelle Nordstrom Wagner preceded him in death in 1997. A commemorative celebration of Martin Wagner's life and accomplishments is on Saturday morning, September 12th in the Martin Wagner Education Center at the School of Labor and Employment Relations, University of Illinois, Urbana-Champaign, with a memorial service to follow on that weekend."

2009-06-21T00:00:00Z,"IT'S akin to the neighborhood diner taking over McDonald's: the news that Koenigsegg -- a Swedish builder of $1 million supercars with a sales total of only 18 cars last year -- will buy Saab from General Motors seems barely less fantastical. If that wild thought had entered my mind when I was testing the CCX last summer, I would have figured the Koenigsegg's 806-horsepower thrust and severe G-forces were to blame. The CCX looked like a four-wheeled starship, and it was a pure gut-check delight to drive. My most lasting impression of the Koenigsegg -- besides its rocket-sled acceleration -- was that it felt like a real production car, rather than a million-dollar kit car or a poorly disguised racer. But Swedish nationality and quirkiness aside, it's still hard to see any logical connection between the Koenigsegg's cost-no-object fantasy and the practical everyday business of Saab."

At Gil's request no funeral was held and his ashes will be spread in the same place as his first wife, Sheila Bakerman. Gil was born in Cleveland, Ohio, on December 25, 1924. He moved to New York City in 1953. During his lifetime, he was a musician, a writer, a photographer, an actor and a talent agent. He is survived by his stepson, Robert Bland, his sister-in-law, Jane Bakerman, his niece Debbie Siskin, his nephew Lenny Siskin, his brother-in-law Michael Siskin and his cousins from the Diener side of the family: Jim, Nathalie, Ruth, Ken, Linda, and Sam. Gil had no children. Gil served in the United States Army during World War II, serving as acting first sergeant, supply sergeant, and mess sergeant for one detachment of 250 German prisoners of War in Fort Leonard Wood, Missouri. Gil would often joke about why he spoke English so well--because the German prisoners (many of whom were educated in the U.S.) would correct his English whenever he spoke to them. Gil received a Victory Medal, American Theatre Ribbon and a Good Conduct Medal before he was honorably discharged in 1946. As a freelance writer, Gil published over 2,000 articles in trade magazines, ranging from the oil industry to the healthcare industry. He quickly learned if he took pictures for his articles, he would make more money. So he learned photography as well. Gil, we will miss your wit, your humor and your generosity. We can no longer laugh in your presence, but we are quite certain that somebody is laughing in yours. Rest in peace, my friend."

Connett, III (Derrydale Press), and Kathryn Elise Underhill Connett. He is predeceased by his sister Elise Migeon Connett Baker. Eugene attended St. Paul's School in Concord, NH, graduating in 1939. He attanded Princeton as a multiple legacy and was a member of the Cottage Club and the crew team. In 1942 he graduated early to enlist as a first lieutenant in the Army Air Corps, as a navigator, and served on a classified assignment with the O.S.S. in the Alsace-Lorraine region of France until 1945. Following WWII, Eugene worked at David Ogilvy Associates in New York, where he met his wife, Etheldred Slosson McGrew (Geneva, NY) (predeceased). They were married on April 29, 1950. Later, Eugene became the Vice President of the American Carpet Institute, worked for Springs Mills, Inc. and consulted to several manufacturers in the fiber industry. Mr. Connett sailed competitively on the Great South Bay and instilled the love of sailing in each of his children.

In 1979, the Connett family moved to Stonington, CT and joined the Wadawannuck Yacht Club. His sterling civic and professional accomplishments are only eclipsed by his greater achievements as a magnificent father, faithful friend and man of integrity. He was adored by all who knew him.

2009-06-21T00:00:00Z,"CONNETT--Eugene Virginius IV. On June 12, 2009, Eugene Virginius Connett IV, aka ""The Kid"", passed on. He was born to his proud parents, Eugene V. Connett III and Kathryn Elise Underhill Connett on a snowy morning on January 21, 1920 in South Orange, NJ. His advent was welcomed with open arms by his sister, Elise Migeon Connett. Eugene was privileged to attend St. Paul's School of Concord, NH, graduating in 1939. In the spring, he fished the chalk streams of England with his father, (who was an expert trout fisherman and distinguished author and owner of the Derrydale Press). He spent his autumns shooting with his father in duck blinds on the Chesapeake and the golden grasslands of North America. Immediately following his high school years, Mr. Connett attended Princeton as a 4th generation legacy, where he graduated with a degree in French Literature in 1942. There, he was a member of the Cottage Club and the Princeton Crew Team. With WWII in full swing in 1942, Mr. Connett enlisted as a first lieutenant in the Army Air Corps. His superb language skills were seen as a valuable asset and bought him a classified assignment with the O.S.S. in the Alsace-Lorraine region of France until 1945. Following the war, Connett returned home and took a position with David Ogilvy Associates in NYC, NY as a marketing executive. He met his future bride, Etheldred Slosson McGrew (of Geneva, NY) in an elevator and smitten with her willowy frame and winsome smile, wed her on April 29, 1950. The following spring, the happy couple was blessed with their first child, Stacey Migeon Connett (Spartz). Within the ensuing seven years, his daughters, (Bevan Brecount Connett Kinney and Kathryn Underhill Connett Loh) and his identical twin sons, (Eugene Virginius Connett V and Aubrey Fitzhugh Connett) had joined the family. Mr. Connett was an accomplished sailor who was familiar throughout the great South Bay of LI, NY, where the Connett family summered until the mid 1950's. In the 1960's, Mr. Connett established himself as a small boat racer's worst nightmare, competing around the harbors of Long Island Sound under the burgee of Riverside Yacht Club in Riverside, CT. In 1979, Eugene and his family relocated to Stonington, CT, where he assumed the distinguished status of M.P.S.O. and enjoyed a membership in the Wadawannuck Yacht Club in Stonington, CT. His professional accomplishments included attaining the Vice Presidency of the American Carpet Institute in NYC, NY and ownership of the world renowned Stonington Clothing Ltd., of Stonington, CT. By far, his greatest achievement was being a magnificent father, faithful friend and man of integrity. He was a lovely guy who led a sun-kissed life and was adored by all who knew him. Eugene Connett IV is survived by all his sons and daughters (above), their spouses and partners; Dan Kinney, Rick Loh, Lori Connett, Kim Connett and David Wolodko. He also leaves behind his handsome grandchildren; Matthew Perry, Eric, Mark and Stacey Loh, Emily Connett and Tommy and Andrew Connett, of whom he was unspeakably proud! Services will be held in his honor at Calvary Episcopal Church located at 27 Church Street, Stonington, CT. 06378 at 12:30pm on Sunday, June 28, 2009.

Over 120 projects were designed in the course of the partnership, including the Heinz Architectural Center at the Carnegie Museum in Pittsburgh. In NYC the firm received the Restoration Award from the Friends of the Upper East Side Historic District.

2009-06-21T00:00:00Z,"DANIEL Birnbaum, the curator of the 53rd Venice Biennale, took its title -- ''Making Worlds'' -- from a book by the American philosopher Nelson Goodman, who advocated thinking about art less as finished work and more as a means, like science, of comprehending the world. Goodman proposed replacing the slippery question ''What is art?'' with the question ''When is art?'' During the biennale, still arguably the world's most important international exhibition, the answer is: always, constantly, art without interval. And Venice itself -- that ''repository of consolations,'' as Henry James called it -- becomes the glorious frame. Much of the contemporary art scattered throughout the city attempts, if only briefly, to become part of Venice's noble architecture, as with Spencer Finch's multicolored windows at the Arsenale, the rooftops glimpsed through Mona Hatoum's cutouts of soldiers, and the unexpected projections and installations that seem to wait around every corner. As if issuing a reminder of the precariousness of Venice and of art itself, the waters invaded on June 6, during the last evening of the press preview, flooding much of the city and turning the ground into a giant mirror in the twilight -- yet another work, with Venice and its art-world multitudes reflected in the surface.

The idea of someone yelling, ''Crawl faster,'' while I scramble on all fours through grass that I know for a fact gets fertilized hourly by a gaggle of obese geese, holds zero appeal. But maybe that's just me. The problem is that you bring your dog to your class and you let him run off-leash. That would still be O.K., except that when I ask you to please leash your dog because if you don't my leashed dog will yank so hard he will dislocate my shoulder, you ignore me."

The reports date to 1999, when Matrixx Initiatives first brought the product to market.

On June 10, Carlos Beltran of the Mets hustled back to the right-center-field wall and seemingly had a fly ball lined up -- until he inexplicably jumped for the ball and it glanced off his glove. It was ruled a hit. The same night, the Yankees' Nick Swisher moved toward the right-field line, came to a jog and simply missed the ball -- another hit. Then last week, Aubrey Huff, the Orioles' first baseman, sprinted some 30 yards down the right-field line, attempted an over-the-shoulder catch of a pop-up, but dropped the ball.

2009-06-21T00:00:00Z,"BAER--Dr. George Martin, died on June 2, 2009, in Mexico City, Mexico at the age of 73. Dr. Baer was an eminent scientist, veterinarian and public health specialist. He was responsible for developing the oral vaccine for rabies that led to the eradication of wildlife rabies in Europe. At the time of his death he was working on a new vaccine against numerous strains of the influenza virus, a project that he was especially eager to complete given the recent worldwide outbreak of the H1N1 virus. Throughout his professional career, Dr. Baer acted from a deeply held belief in the power of preventive medicine and the desire to combat disease both in animals and in humans. Dr. Baer was born on January 12, 1936, in London, England. He was the only son of Kathi Meyer Baer, of Berlin, and Curtis Otto Baer, of Strassburg, Germany. His mother was a renowned musicologist and the first woman to be awarded a doctoral degree in musicology in Leipzig, Germany in the 1920s. His father was a student of Heidegger, a professor of art history at Vassar College and a noted collector of 18th and 19th century master drawings and paintings. Dr. Baer's parents fled Nazi Germany for Paris, France, and then emigrated to the United States in 1940. He grew up in New Rochelle, New York, where he became a competitive horseman and thus began his lifelong love of animals. To his parents' surprise, he did not follow a career in the arts, but instead chose the sciences. After graduating from the Westtown School in Westtown, Pennsylvania, in 1952, he attended Cornell University, where he earned an undergraduate degree in agricultural sciences in 1954 and a degree in veterinary medicine in 1959. He earned a master's degree in Public Health from the University of Michigan in 1960. Dr. Baer began his career in public health by joining the New York Public Health Service, where he learned the practice of epidemiology and virology. In 1968 he entered the U.S. Public Health Service and, thanks to Dr. James H. Steele, his friend and mentor, started a long and successful career at the Centers for Disease Control (CDC) in Atlanta, Georgia. There, he became head of the Rabies Laboratory and with his team of scientists and researchers developed the oral vaccine for wildlife rabies. His expertise in the virology of rabies and his role in developing the oral vaccine against wildlife rabies made him one of the foremost international experts in this area. His book, The Natural History of Rabies, is a definitive reference in the field. On his father's suggestion, in 1959 Dr. Baer traveled to Mexico. There, he met and fell in love with his wife, Maria Olga Lara, and with the country, its people, history, culture and traditions. From 1966 to 1968 he was sent by the CDC to work with the Mexican Public Health Service in Palo Alto, Mexico. Based on his training and working closely with a group of young Mexican scientists and veterinarians, he helped lay the groundwork for Mexico's public health programs against rabies. In addition to his native English and German, Dr. Baer was a fluent Spanish speaker, and loved languages, literature, art and music. He was also an avid mountaineer. Dr. Baer is survived by his wife of 49 years, Maria Olga Baer, three daughters, Katherine Baer, economist, of Washington, D.C., Alexandra Baer, sculptor and artist, of New Paltz, New York, and Isabella Baer, an opera singer, of Mexico City, and four granddaughters. Funeral services were held in Mexico City at the Iglesia de Santa Rosa de Lima on June 4, 2009."

Rapists, in short, have more children than non-rapists. But Begley looks at evidence from a Paraguayan tribe living a traditional existence and finds that in fact that is not the case. Any given rape is quite unlikely to result in offspring -- particularly offspring who survive -- while it often leads to the demise of the rapist."

The United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit, in San Francisco, ruled on Friday that the United States District Court for the Northern District of California had erred in its ruling in Simon & Schuster’s favor in a class-action suit brought by Laci Satterfield, a woman who objected to receiving an ad for “Cell” as a text message. While the district court said that Simon & Schuster, whose imprint Scribner published “Cell,” had not employed a so-called automatic telephone dialing system to send the messages, the appellate court ruled it was not actually clear if an automatic dialing system was used. The court also ruled, contrary to the district court, that a text message could be defined as “a call” and disputed that Ms. Satterfield had consented to receive the message. Adam Rothberg, a spokesman for Simon & Schuster, said the company would continue to defend the case."

Last week The Star-Ledger of Newark, citing data obtained through New Jersey’s Open Public Records Act, reported that 12 percent of all tickets for the concert — including more than 90 percent of “the best seats in the house” — were withheld from public sale, and instead went to Mr. Springsteen, right, his record company and others. Mr. Landau acknowledged that “significant numbers of tickets” are held back for shows in New Jersey, New York and Los Angeles, but countered that of the 2,000 to 3,500 seats closest to the stage, “95 percent of them go to the public.” He also said that some of the held tickets went to the state attorney general, Anne Milgram, for fans who couldn’t get seats when tickets for the show went on sale on Feb. 6. Ticketmaster settled with New Jersey two weeks later over complaints that it had pointed online customers to its resale subsidiary, TicketsNow, where tickets were being offered well above face value."

At the concert Noel Gallagher, the lead guitarist, told the audience, “Anybody who has kept their ticket will get a full refund.” (This could have cost $4.8 million if everyone in attendance accepted the offer.) But on his blog Mr. Gallagher wrote that he now regrets offering the refund and added that he was surprised that the 20,000 fans who asked for their money back didn’t walk out of the concert. “So you were genuinely disappointed?” Mr. Gallagher wrote. “There wasn’t a 20,000 gap in the crowd.”."

2009-06-23T00:00:00Z,"CONNETT--Eugene Virginius IV. On June 12, 2009, Eugene Virginius Connett IV, aka ""The Kid"", passed on. He was born to his proud parents, Eugene V. Connett III and Kathryn Elise Underhill Connett on a snowy morning on January 21, 1920 in South Orange, NJ. His advent was welcomed with open arms by his sister, Elise Migeon Connett. Eugene was privileged to attend St. Paul's School of Concord, NH, graduating in 1939. In the spring, he fished the chalk streams of England with his father, (who was an expert trout fisherman and distinguished author and owner of the Derrydale Press). He spent his autumns shooting with his father in duck blinds on the Chesapeake and the golden grasslands of North America. Immediately following his high school years, Mr. Connett attended Princeton as a 4th generation legacy, where he graduated with a degree in French Literature in 1942. There, he was a member of the Cottage Club and the Princeton Crew Team. With WWII in full swing in 1942, Mr. Connett enlisted as a first lieutenant in the Army Air Corps. His superb language skills were seen as a valuable asset and bought him a classified assignment with the O.S.S. in the Alsace-Lorraine region of France until 1945. Following the war, Connett returned home and took a position with David Ogilvy Associates in NYC, NY as a marketing executive. He met his future bride, Etheldred Slosson McGrew (of Geneva, NY) in an elevator and smitten with her willowy frame and winsome smile, wed her on April 29, 1950. The following spring, the happy couple was blessed with their first child, Stacey Migeon Connett (Spartz). Within the ensuing seven years, his daughters, (Bevan Brecount Connett Kinney and Kathryn Underhill Connett Loh) and his identical twin sons, (Eugene Virginius Connett V and Aubrey Fitzhugh Connett) had joined the family. Mr. Connett was an accomplished sailor who was familiar throughout the great South Bay of LI, NY, where the Connett family summered until the mid 1950's. In the 1960's, Mr. Connett established himself as a small boat racer's worst nightmare, competing around the harbors of Long Island Sound under the burgee of Riverside Yacht Club in Riverside, CT. In 1979, Eugene and his family relocated to Stonington, CT, where he assumed the distinguished status of M.P.S.O. and enjoyed a membership in the Wadawannuck Yacht Club in Stonington, CT. His professional accomplishments included attaining the Vice Presidency of the American Carpet Institute in NYC, NY and ownership of the world renowned Stonington Clothing Ltd., of Stonington, CT. By far, his greatest achievement was being a magnificent father, faithful friend and man of integrity. He was a lovely guy who led a sun-kissed life and was adored by all who knew him. Eugene Connett IV is survived by all his sons and daughters (above), their spouses and partners; Dan Kinney, Rick Loh, Lori Connett, Kim Connett and David Wolodko. He also leaves behind his handsome grandchildren; Matthew Perry, Eric, Mark and Stacey Loh, Emily Connett and Tommy and Andrew Connett, of whom he was unspeakably proud!

Rudy was a valued member of the University of Rochester Medical Center Board. He will be deeply missed.""

They had one group of rodents paddle in a small pool for six hours, this long workout broken into two sessions of three hours each. A second group of rats were made to stroke furiously through short, intense bouts of swimming, while carrying ballast to increase their workload. After 20 seconds, the weighted rats were scooped out of the water and allowed to rest for 10 seconds, before being placed back in the pool for another 20 seconds of exertion. The scientists had the rats repeat these brief, strenuous swims 14 times, for a total of about four-and-a-half minutes of swimming. Afterward, the researchers tested each rat’s muscle fibers and found that, as expected, the rats that had gone for the six-hour swim showed preliminary molecular changes that would increase endurance. But the second rodent group, which exercised for less than five minutes also showed the same molecular changes."

She's not the first casualty in this cratering art market -- in the last six months galleries like Roebling Hall, Clementine and Guild & Greyshkul have all shuttered - but T Magazine has had a long, fruitful relationship with the artists Smith has represented over the last decade. (In fact, back in 2000, Deborah Solomon profiled Smith, a Yale painting grad-turned-Greenpoint gallerist in ""How to Become an Instant Art Star"" in the Times Sunday magazine.) From Adam Cvijanovic's epic landscape murals to Sharon Core's photographic homages to Wayne Thiebaud's everyday food items to the extravagent paper cake Kirsten Hassenfeld created for a T wedding bonus, Smith's artists elevated our pages with intelligence, ingenuity and brilliant craftsmanship. Though she'll be working with these artists privately, we hope this gallery closing is not an actual bellwether of things to come in the art world. As Smith lamented in her note, ""I tried to have a strong and distinct voice and found the art world to be a very bizarre place to navigate. It's my sincere hope that the closing of Bellwether is a wake-up call and that the collectors come back in support of young art."""

Let me reassure you that the news pages of The Times devote much attention to just those things. And I hope it is not tactless to mention that my topic is not so trivial as to keep my critics themselves from commenting on it. But I quite like these putatively unimportant matters.

The food, the service and the art collection are all impeccable - it's one of my, and many other people's, favorite hotels in this country. I suggested it with a huge caveat: They probably won't get in. Even though it's not cheap (but in my opinion not overpriced), Twin Farms is regularly booked a year in advance for nearly every season except maybe mud season. But guess what?

In the complaint, Ms. Hassett says that Ms. Hasselbeck’s book “includes dozens of paraphrased as well as word for word regurgitations of phrases and scrupulously researched factual data entries” and “utilizes a virtually identical order and format of 13 chapters” of Ms. Hassett’s work. The lawsuit states that Ms. Hassett sent a copy of her book to Ms. Hasselbeck in April 2008 after “The View” host disclosed that she had celiac disease. According to the complaint, Ms. Hasselbeck never acknowledged the book or Ms. Hassett. Ms. Hassett and her lawyer, Richard Cunha, declined to comment. In a statement, a Hachette spokeswoman denied the accusations and said that no complaint had been served."

2009-06-25T00:00:00Z,"BUTCHER--Susan Elizabeth, November 21, 1960 to April 15, 2009. A light did indeed go out in Santa Fe, when architect and designer Susan Elizabeth Butcher died at her home in Galisteo, N.M. on April 15 at age 48 after a long, courageous battle with cancer, during which she continued her grand humor, her full and contagious laugh and her passion for visiting with friends. Her husband, Henry, never wavered in her difficult care and was always beside her. A 1978 graduate of Sandia High School, she spent her junior year in France as a foreign exchange student. While studying ballet with Lucy Hayden at the Hayden School of Ballet for 12 years, Susan became an accomplished ballet student, a discipline in which she took great pride. A native of Albuquerque, N.M., Susan earned a Bachelor of Arts degree in architecture from Princeton University in 1983 and a Master's of Architecture cum laude from Princeton in 1987. Her talent and sophistication were apparent in her student work. Like Susan herself, her design work and drawings were elegant, delicate, precise, and graceful. She had the confidence and aesthetic vision to find the perfect balance of design elements that made her projects both tasteful and unique. She began her career as a designer at Hardy, Holtzman, Pfeiffer Associates in New York in 1980. While at Hardy, Holtzman, she worked on the feasibility study for the redesign of the Grand Central Terminal. In June, 1983 Susan was hired as a designer by award winning architect Michael Graves in Princeton, and rose to Director of Interiors before leaving in September 1990. Her projects at Graves included the Walt Disney World Swan and Dolphin Hotels, both receiving the AIA Mid-Florida Chapter Design Award, and the Aventine Hyatt Hotel in La Jolla, California. She was also involved in the firm's design work on the Humana Corporate Headquarters in Louisville, KY. and the Emory University Museum of Modern Art in Atlanta, which were recipients of the prestigious AIA National Award. She is acknowledged as a Project Assistant in Grave's book Michael Graves Buildings and Projects 1982-1989. After leaving Graves' firm, Susan served as Director of Architectural Design for Tishman Construction Corp. of New York from 1990-91. While at Tishman she worked on the Chicago Sheraton and the Rio Mar Resort in Puerto Rico. The founder of Susan Butcher Design, Susan was known for her interior design work on hotels, restaurants, and museums, as well as residences. One of her collaborators was her husband, designer Henry Noestheden. She created her eponymous design firm in 1991 in New Mexico where she was a registered Architect. Her major projects included interior design work for the Eldorado Hotel and the Inn of the Anasazi, both in Santa Fe, as well as the Four Seasons, Resort in Nevis, West Indies, The Fairmont at the Plaza in Kansas City, Missouri, and the Westin Hotel in Detroit. Works still in progress were a large vacation home in Anquilla, a mountain home in Vail, Colorado, and a three house ranch complex in Marfa, Texas. ""In addition to her passion for architecture, design, and fashion, Susan loved to cook, and even as a student would entertain friends with delicious and beautiful meals. Whether it was an impromptu dinner, or her wedding celebration with Henry, Susan created memorable events where her attention to detail made everyone feel welcome and special. Susan's witty perspective helped her friends and colleagues cope with the pressure of deadlines both in graduate school and the office. But her humor didn't hide her serious approach to her design work, and her solid commitment to her friends."" (Nancy Clayton, AIA). ""I respected her intelligence, admired her achievements as a professional and was humbled by her generosity, kindness and consideration as a friend. She did touch my life and made a difference in who I am."" (designer and childhood friend, Eric Montoya.) Susan is survived by her husband Henry Noestheden, her parents Barry Miller and Elizabeth Anne Butcher of Albuquerque, and two brothers, William Robert Butcher and partner Craig W. Thomsen of Portland, Ore., and James Douglas Butcher, wife Crystal Montgomery Butcher and their three children Anastasia Michelle, Cameron James and Nathan Montgomery. Susan's life will be celebrated on June 27 at 1 p.m. at Galisteo. Guests are asked to RSVP and receive further directions by e-mail to jl@sbdsf.com or by calling Susan Butcher Design at (505) 982-7648. A. scholarship in Susan's memory is being established at the University of Cincinnati, where she mentored Interior Design students, and where her own mentor, Michael Graves, holds an Honorary Doctorate Degree. For those wishing to contribute, further details of the fund will be available at the memorial or by calling Susan Butcher Design at (505) 982-7648.

She was a devoted grandmother to Eric, Matthew, Danny, Rachel, Katie and Ellery, an adoring mother-in-law to Steven, Kerry, Konrad, Lori, and the late Ray Reider Golden, and a wonderful aunt to her nieces, Judy, Ann and Louise. Though she faced significant adversity in her life, her husband, Monroe, died when she was 43, and chronic physical challenges, she contributed to the political and artistic life of her community. After World War II, she was involved with the civil rights movement and progressive politics. She was a member of the Congress of Racial Equality, Women Strike for Peace, and spearheaded Allard Lowenstein's congressional campaign in the Five Towns on Long Island. She realized her lifelong dream in November, when she voted for Obama and watched with sheer joy as he won the presidential election. Judy was a major supporter of contemporary artists, responsible for bringing major artists from New York to the Five Towns Music & Arts Foundation, and worked at the Terry Dintenfass Gallery and the Martin Gordon Gallery in New York. When she moved to New York City in 1987, she volunteered weekly until late last year at the Metropolitan Museum of Art and at the Whitney Museum.

While the first filing against the estate said Ms. Kristal had been ''talked into executing the contract'' and noted that she had memory problems, a subsequent filing left open the possibility that she did not sign and said that if she had signed she had been duped.

But a droll little footnote in a recent biography of Josef Vissarionovich Djugashvili -- you can call him Stalin -- set me straight. Or perhaps I should say, it re-educated me. In ''Young Stalin,'' the author Simon Sebag Montefiore travels back to the wild streets of Tbilisi, Georgia, to uncover Stalin the gangster, the extortionist, the bank robber, the poet and the street operator. The biographer's bold ambition is to suggest how this cobbler's son and onetime seminarian could grow up to become perhaps the century's defining dictator.

''Now, when you're out riding on the Greenway, practically every third bike is a folding bike.''"

2009-06-26T09:59:51Z,"The collected edition of “Final Crisis,” the latest event mini-series from DC Comics, tops the hardcover list this week. The story, written by Grant Morrison, was presented as “the day evil wins,” even though we know, c’mon, the heroes are going to be victorious in the end. “Final Crisis” features the return of a long-dead hero, the death of another and a whole lot of parallel earths, where, say, Batman is a vampire; Superman’s rocket landed in the Soviet Union; or Wonder Woman is a villain known as Superwoman. No one handles those endless possibilities better than Mr. Morrison, as he proves again in “Final Crisis” (particularly in the final issue in the collected edition) and in the two-part series “Superman Beyond,” which is wisely included in the hardcover. A peek at some pages from the comic “Final Crisis” is available here. And for a hint at what Mr. Morrison has planned next for the multiverse, click here."
2009-06-26T11:22:15Z,"LONDON — And on Thursday I bore witness to man’s inhumanity to animals. I mean, I think that was what I was doing. Does a man having sex with a cat qualify as animal abuse if the cat is the initiator and has a good time? There are many instances of such species-crossing encounters, described with biological exactness, in “Grasses of a Thousand Colors,” Wallace Shawn’s new play at the Royal Court Theater. But now that I think about it, it’s not really fair to use that question to begin a discussion of a cerebral, quasi-pornographic work that is at heart deeply moralistic, since the judgments it passes on its dubious, phallocentric hero aren’t really about his willingness to copulate with cats. I mean, I guess you could say that in symbolic terms."

And then came Iran. And Mark Sanford. And, well, there was the fact that it was about health care reform. The result: the 10 p.m. show drew 4.7 million viewers, or nearly 3 million fewer than a competing repeat of CBS's ""CSI: New York"" and less than half what the evening's top draw, NBC's ""America's Got Talent,"" attracted in the previous hour.

We may not have known it then, but we were seeing his life flash before our eyes. His personal demons aside, Jackson was the embodiment of fashion's perpetual Peter Pan fantasies. When it came to style, the guy never grew - or gave - up. Over the years, he channeled everyone from Klaus Nomi to Captain Stubing; he dabbled in transvestism and robotics, military paraphernalia and S&M. And all of these looks were custom-made for him, making him perhaps the world's single biggest couture client for over two decades. In recent years, he went ready-to-wear - Balmain, Rick Owens, Givenchy - a sign of the times perhaps, but a weird one considering that all of these designers in some way or another owe him a huge stylistic debt. (Man in the Mirror indeed.) Jackson's love of accessories - gloves, white socks, wrestling belts, military insignias - was legend; in anticipation of his coming tour, he had commissioned a series of masks from the downtown artist Desi Santiago (whose work is now on display at Terence Koh's Asia Song Society). In slide shows above and below, The Moment recaps some of Jackson's more memorable looks, from Bad to Dangerous to quite simply Off the Wall."

2009-06-26T14:11:36Z,I am on the board of directors of a co-op in Great Neck on Long Island. The building is 45 years old and has never had a wheelchair ramp. One of our shareholders wants a ramp at the front of the building. But our garage is at ground level; entering the building from there requires going up only a very small incline. This has proved satisfactory up until now. One of our directors says the Fair Housing Act would require us to accommodate a shareholder if a ramp were requested. Is there such a rule? Aren't we excluded because of the building's age?

The Harry Ransom Center at the University of Texas in Austin is currently showing more than 100 of his images (the center has over 1,300 Henle prints in their archives) in the exhibition ""In Search of Beauty,"" through Aug. 2. An early contributor to Life Magazine, Henle was sent to Paris on assignment for two weeks in the summer of 1938 to capture the daily life of the city. He came back with what he thought was a treasure trove of images, but Life's photo department felt otherwise and decided not to publish the work. But in 1944, when General Charles de Gaulle marched through Paris, liberating the city, Helene Lazareff, the photo editor of The New York Times, called Henle looking for images of prewar Paris. Henle's pictures were quickly published in the Sunday Magazine to celebrate the end of the German occupation. Henle once said, ""One thing an artist can do in this world is to remind people that there is so much beauty that you only have to see it."" Fitting words for someone whose work captures such a wonderful sense of optimism."

She was a devoted grandmother to Eric, Matthew, Danny, Rachel, Katie, Amanda and Ellery, an adoring mother-in-law to Steven, Kerry, Konrad, Lori, and the late Ray Reider Golden, and a wonderful aunt to her nieces, Judy, Ann and Louise. Though she faced significant adversity in her life, her husband, Monroe, died when she was 43, and chronic physical challenges, she contributed to the political and artistic life of her community. After World War II, she was involved with the civil rights movement and progressive politics. She was a member of the Congress of Racial Equality, Women Strike for Peace, and spearheaded Allard Lowenstein's congressional campaign in the Five Towns on Long Island. She realized her lifelong dream in November, when she voted for Obama and watched with sheer joy as he won the presidential election. Judy was a major supporter of contemporary artists, responsible for bringing major artists from New York to the Five Towns Music & Arts Foundation, and worked at the Terry Dintenfass Gallery and the Martin Gordon Gallery in New York. When she moved to New York City in 1987, she volunteered weekly until late last year at the Metropolitan Museum of Art and at the Whitney Museum. She had an uncanny ability of attracting people younger than herself because of her values and spirit. She inspired all of us to live our lives with integrity, commitment and joy. In lieu of flowers, please make a contribution to the Studio Museum of Harlem. Funeral service will be held at the Riverside Memorial Chapel, 180 W. 76th St., New York City on Friday, June 26 at 11:45am. Her life was a blessing."

2009-06-26T00:00:00Z,"That Fox is broadcasting ''Virtuality,'' a film meant to introduce a series it has not scheduled, on a Friday night in June -- one week before the Fourth of July -- carries with it the cruel weight of a live burial. While it ought to be said that ''Virtuality'' seems created to alienate any but the pointiest science-fiction fans (civilians might prefer the weekend backup on I-95 just outside New Haven), it is an impressively credentialed and stylish bit of television moviemaking, an exploration not merely of our practical dependence on technology but also of our psychological and nearly eroticized addiction to it. Through Ronald D. Moore, one of the writers and a chief force behind ''Battlestar Galactica,'' and Peter Berg, the director, the film maximizes its collaboration between Mr. Moore's blunt and distinctly masculine vision of a world careering toward apocalypse and the curvier intimacy of Mr. Berg's camera. His artfully melodramatic close-ups (the trademark of Mr. Berg's series ''Friday Night Lights'') are intended to remind us of all the fleshy emotion from which we absent ourselves when we choose to conduct our relationships at almost every level on screens."

In 1972, he joined International Paper as its CFO and a member of the board. After he retired in 1982, he taught business management courses at the Stern School. He married Margaret Marrin in 1941. During most of their married life, Margaret, who earned her Masters Degree in Social Work from Columbia University, worked as a family counselor, and became a highly sought-after speaker on these subjects. They were a very close couple who excelled at combining family life with two careers long before this life pattern became common. They were happily married for fifty-three years until her death in 1994. Mr. Harrigan was an exceptionally thoughtful, kind and generous man who steadfastly maintained these qualities in his business life as well as in his private life. He was liked and admired by his colleagues and loved by his family. He is survived by his daughter, Patricia Nadosy, of New York City, by his son, Arthur W.

2009-06-26T00:00:00Z,"STEVENS--Lynne. Activist and researcher in the field of violence against women, dies of cancer at 63. Lynne Stevens was Director of the Responding to Violence Against Women Program and an Assistant Professor at the Boston University School of Medicine, Department of Family Medicine. A psychotherapist in private practice in Manhattan for decades, Stevens specialized in improving services for victims of violence. Working with such groups as the International Planned Parenthood Federation/Western Hemisphere and the United Nations Population Fund (UNFPA), she developed and implemented programs in many countries, including Nepal, Venezuela, Sri Lanka, Vietnam and Armenia. Educational materials that she developed have been widely distributed by UNFPA, the CDC, and state anti-violence programs, and been translated into a variety of languages. On moving to Boston University in 2005, she championed evaluating and strengthening services for victims of violence in a variety of settings, including the Family Medicine Department's ambulatory care clinic and other department practices, Manet Community Health Center, Boston University's student health services, and dental clinics. Dr. Larry Culpepper, Professor and Chair of the BU Department of Family Medicine noted, ""Her activities led to the recognition of a problem with many silent victims, to its inclusion in medical curriculum, and to the development of clinical models of care. She had the rare qualities of seeing clearly the suffering others overlooked, and of inspiring colleagues to respond."" As Stevens traveled in Asia, she fell in love with the bright beautiful fabrics worn by the local women. In 2007, she started designing and selling few-of-a-kind yoga bags under the company name Samadhi. She donated a percentage of profits to yogaHOPE, an organization providing free yoga programs for needy women and girls, where she was a volunteer teacher. Stevens served as a member of the boards of directors of domestic violence organizations the New York State Coalition Against Sexual Assault (NYSCASA), and then (after moving to Boston in 2005) Casa Myrna Vazquez, where she recently became Vice-President of the Board. Contributions can be made in her memory to Casa Myrna at POB 180019, Boston, Massachusetts 02218, or online at www.casamyrna.org. In 2006, Stevens and Deborah Maine, Professor of International Health at Boston University's School of Public Health, were married in Great Barrington, Massachusetts, honoring more than 20 years of love and laughter. Stevens is also survived by her sister, Wendy, of Vermont, her aunt, Sherrey Glickman of New Jersey, and other relatives. Memorial services are being planned in New York and Boston."

2009-06-26T00:00:00Z,"CONNETT--Eugene Virginius IV. On June 12, 2009, Eugene Virginius Connett IV, aka ""The Kid"", passed on. He was born to his proud parents, Eugene V. Connett III and Kathryn Elise Underhill Connett on a snowy morning on January 21, 1920 in South Orange, NJ. His advent was welcomed with open arms by his sister, Elise Migeon Connett. Eugene was privileged to attend St. Paul's School of Concord, NH, graduating in 1939. In the spring, he fished the chalk streams of England with his father, (who was an expert trout fisherman and distinguished author and owner of the Derrydale Press). He spent his autumns shooting with his father in duck blinds on the Chesapeake and the golden grasslands of North America. Immediately following his high school years, Mr. Connett attended Princeton as a 4th generation legacy, where he graduated with a degree in French Literature in 1942. There, he was a member of the Cottage Club and the Princeton Crew Team. With WWII in full swing in 1942, Mr. Connett enlisted as a first lieutenant in the Army Air Corps. His superb language skills were seen as a valuable asset and bought him a classified assignment with the O.S.S. in the Alsace-Lorraine region of France until 1945. Following the war, Connett returned home and took a position with David Ogilvy Associates in NYC, NY as a marketing executive. He met his future bride, Etheldred Slosson McGrew (of Geneva, NY) in an elevator and smitten with her willowy frame and winsome smile, wed her on April 29, 1950. The following spring, the happy couple was blessed with their first child, Stacey Migeon Connett (Spartz). Within the ensuing seven years, his daughters, (Bevan Brecount Connett Kinney and Kathryn Underhill Connett Loh) and his identical twin sons, (Eugene Virginius Connett V and Aubrey Fitzhugh Connett) had joined the family. Mr. Connett was an accomplished sailor who was familiar throughout the great South Bay of LI, NY, where the Connett family summered until the mid 1950's. In the 1960's, Mr. Connett established himself as a small boat racer's worst nightmare, competing around the harbors of Long Island Sound under the burgee of Riverside Yacht Club in Riverside, CT. In 1979, Eugene and his family relocated to Stonington, CT, where he assumed the distinguished status of M.P.S.O. and enjoyed a membership in the Wadawannuck Yacht Club in Stonington, CT. His professional accomplishments included attaining the Vice Presidency of the American Carpet Institute in NYC, NY and ownership of the world renowned Stonington Clothing Ltd., of Stonington, CT. By far, his greatest achievement was being a magnificent father, faithful friend and man of integrity. He was a lovely guy who led a sun-kissed life and was adored by all who knew him. Eugene Connett IV is survived by all his sons and daughters (above), their spouses and partners; Dan Kinney, Rick Loh, Lori Connett, Kim Connett and David Wolodko. He also leaves behind his handsome grandchildren; Matthew Perry, Eric, Mark and Stacey Loh, Emily Connett and Tommy and Andrew Connett, of whom he was unspeakably proud! Services will be held in his honor at Calvary Episcopal Church located at 27 Church Street, Stonington, CT. 06378 at 12:30pm on Sunday, June 28, 2009.

And in what he called ''the coolest boyhood dream to come true thus far in my career,'' Mr. Forster, above right, with the Endeavor, gets to try his hand at piloting the space shuttle inside the official flight simulator. 11 A.M.

Mr. Harrigan graduated from NYU in 1942 while serving in the U.S. Navy, received his MBA from NYU in 1949 and, while employed at Western Electric, earned his Ph.D. in Economics from the Stern School of NYU in 1959. During World War II he first served in Naval Intelligence and, after attending Supply Officers School at Harvard, saw sea duty as an officer on a supply ship carrying landing craft in the Pacific. He recalled the ""cheers of the crew when the last B-29 returned from its mission."" In 1947 he joined Western Electric, where he served as Comptroller, then Financial Vice President and, then until 1972 as CFO and a board member. In 1972, he joined International Paper as its CFO and a member of the board. After he retired in 1982, he taught business management courses at the Stern School. He married Margaret Marrin in 1941. During most of their married life, Margaret, who earned her Masters Degree in Social Work from Columbia University, worked as a family counselor, and became a highly sought-after speaker on these subjects. They were a very close couple who excelled at combining family life with two careers long before this life pattern became common. They were happily married for fifty-three years until her death in 1994. Mr. Harrigan was an exceptionally thoughtful, kind and generous man who steadfastly maintained these qualities in his business life as well as in his private life. He was liked and admired by his colleagues and loved by his family. In lieu of flowers, memorial contributions may be made to The Arthur W. Harrigan Scholarship Fund, NYU Stern School of Business, 44 West 4th Street, Suite 10-160, New York, NY 10012. He is survived by his daughter, Patricia Nadosy, of New York City, by his son, Arthur W.

They want to believe the worst about the Middle East, and want to support the Bush/Cheney battle against ""Isamofascism,"" so when this group needs some propaganda, they are relatively easy marks.Prior Pentagon reports on the detainees who allegedly returned to the ""battlefield"" had been widely ridiculed and debunked.

You are not suggesting, A. Neto, that I be concerned about being banned from a fashion show, nor are you saying I should watch what I say.

This was a lazy, pretentious, overwrought collection marked with the slight tear stain of Michael Jackson's legacy, since, according to Tisci, he was to make clothes for the pop star's concert series. If other designers, like John Galliano, were asked to make clothes for Jackson, we didn't hear from them. They had enough good sense not to say anything. Besides, many designers are usually involved with making clothes and accessories for a performer's tour."

''I'm a social worker, but in a previous life I was a filmmaker. My undergraduate degree was in film. I was in Macedonia watching an old friend of mine from film school shoot a commercial promoting travel to Macedonia. So they were shooting different locations around the country, and I just tagged along to all these beautiful places. It reminded me of maybe what Italy was like in the '50s, where it's underdeveloped but has this fascinating culture. It seems like every major civilization has marched through there and conquered it at one time or another, from the Romans to the Byzantines to the Ottomans, the Nazis, the Communists. They've all left their mark. It's much more intriguing than Western Europe. It's the Balkans, you know? It's rich, and it's complicated, and it has this real rugged beauty to it. It's in flux, so that's interesting to see. It hasn't achieved some end state of developed stasis.''"

But the will to till has never left us. At the same time, this recession is forcing local governments to abandon traditional services. Cities are becoming robotized and retro at the same time. The last century saw the flowering of the City Beautiful movement -- grand boulevards and parks, Parisian in intent, if not actual design. This century, hit with the worst economic slap since the Great Depression, has brought the self-service city -- shrunken, less personal and meaner on one level, more neighborly on another. In the hardest-hit cities, where big clusters of foreclosed houses sit empty, entire blocks are being returned to nature -- land banks, they call them.

2009-06-29T08:43:17Z,What we’re reading on Monday morning.
2009-06-29T09:07:34Z,"As the lyrics to a song from the Broadway musical “Avenue Q” point out, nothing lasts, and life, work, happiness and discomfort are only for now. So it goes for the musical itself: the show, an adult themed upgrade of educational children’s programs like “Sesame Street,” will play its last performance on Sept. 13, its publicists said Monday in a news release. The show, which features music and lyrics by Robert Lopez and Jeff Marx and book by Jeff Whitty, taught Broadway a lesson or two when it opened at the Golden Theater in 2003: in a season that also saw the openings of attention-grabbing productions like “Wicked” and “The Boy from Oz,” the scrappy puppet show was the unexpected winner of the Tony Award for best musical. At its closing, “Avenue Q” will have played 2,534 performances and 22 previews."
2009-06-29T10:19:51Z,"Even for a satirical show like “The Simpsons,” it was relatively easy to pay a sincere tribute to Michael Jackson: on Sunday, the animated Fox series opened with the video for “Do the Bartman,” a pop song that Mr. Jackson helped write and produce for the show in 1990. But for many comedy performers and late-night hosts whose acts typically thrive on topicality, there was no one solution for addressing the notable deaths that occurred last week — if they acknowledged these passings at all."
2009-06-29T11:03:38Z,"As one contemplates the dwindling number of people who could unite an increasingly fragmented popular music landscape, one name that does not come to mind is Philip Roth, the irascible author of “Sabbath’s Theater,” “The Human Stain” and other novels. Yet Mr. Roth has made what we believe is his first foray into pop, as part of a techno song that won’t be hitting the Top 40 chart any time soon."

2009-06-29T12:18:06Z,"A man who admitted his role in the theft of the Edvard Munch painting “The Scream” was sentenced Monday to two and a half years in prison by a court in Oslo, The Associated Press reported. The man, Bjoern Hoen, 41, had been found guilty by a Norwegian appeals court of providing the getaway vehicle that was used in the daytime heist. On Aug. 22, 2004, the Munch Museum in Oslo was raided by two armed masked men, who took “The Scream” as well as a second painting, “Madonna,” and drove off in a black station wagon. (Another version of “The Scream” is owned by the National Gallery of Norway.) The works were recovered in 2006 but details on how and where they were found have not been made public. Mr. Hoen had admitted that he provided the car driven by the thieves but said he did not know how the vehicle would be used. Last year, Norway’s Supreme Court sentenced one thief, Stian Skjold, to six years in jail and the getaway driver, Petter Tharaldsen, to 10 years and 6 months. A third suspect, whose name was not given, died of a heroin overdose in 2006."

The veteran comedian, last seen in 1995 on a Broadway stage as Applegate in the revival of “Damn Yankees,” will direct a musical adaptation of his hit 1963 comedy “The Nutty Professor” that is planned for the 2010-11 season, the show’s publicists said in a news release. That film starred Mr. Lewis as the nebbishy Julius Kelp, who invents a formula that transforms him into the debonair Buddy Love. (A 1996 remake starred Eddie Murphy as the overweight Sherman Klump and his suave alter ego.) The musical adaptation will feature music by Marvin Hamlisch (“A Chorus Line”) and lyrics and book by Rupert Holmes (“Curtains,” “The Mystery of Edwin Drood”). A cast has not yet been announced."
2009-06-29T14:57:23Z,"Turns out that backdrop that clocked Bret Michaels at the Tony Awards was only the first surprise to hit “Rock of Ages”: Amy Spanger, who originated the role of the small-town girl turned stripper Sherrie in the Broadway production, has left the show. Ms. Spanger (of Broadway’s “Wedding Singer” and “Kiss Me, Kate”) had been out of “Rock of Ages” since June 8. At that time, its producers said she was on vocal rest at her doctor’s orders but was expected to return to the show on Monday. But on Monday, publicists for the show said in a release that Ms. Spanger had departed due to “personal reasons.” Savannah Wise has been playing the role of Sherrie in Ms. Spanger’s absence. A full-time replacement was not immediately announced, and producers for “Rock of Ages” did not immediately return phone calls."

For the week that ended Sunday, 143 songs by Mr. Jackson were played 67,383 times on terrestrial and satellite radio; the previous week, his songs were played 3,671 times. The most popular song last week was “Billie Jean,” with 4,540 spins (the previous week it had been played only 318 times); next was “Thriller,” with 3,570 spins; and third, “Rock With You,” with 3,546.

2009-06-29T12:55:55Z,"It's hard to recognize a tennis player in civilian clothes, so it took me a moment to see Brian Baker as he ambled towards me. Tall at 6-foot-3, and built like his former rival Novak Djokovic, Baker looked like a student at nearby Belmont University, which in fact he is. He's also the men's assistant tennis coach at Belmont. I had called Brian to hear his impressions of Wimbledon and to see how his own tennis game was coming along. We had agreed to meet for an iced tea at Bongo Java, a coffee place favored by music-business types housed in a old two story structure across the street from Belmont. Once inside, we ordered our drinks and looked at the ""Nun Bun,"" a pastry now preserved with shellac said to resemble Mother Teresa which created quite a stir back in October 1996, when it was featured in USA Today. Our talk turned to the men's draw at Wimbledon, and specifically to Monday's Round of 16 matchups."

Rossi's teammate and perhaps fiercest rival this season, Jorge Lorenzo, was stuck in sixth as Rossi made his move to the front. Lorenzo gave chase but could not get close enough to pressure Rossi, who pulled away in the final laps. ""I felt good on the first lap and knowing that Lorenzo is difficult to beat I put my foot down to establish as big an advantage as possible over him,"" said Rossi, who is only the second rider to score 100 wins.

(The cafe, called Terrace 5, is open only to museum visitors.) But last week, I finally snagged a table -- on the balcony, which overlooks the museum's sculpture garden, and I can say that the view alone was worth the wait. Since I got there at the end of the day, I almost had the balcony to myself -- and the garden, too, since it had rained on and off all day. A deep overhang shelters the outdoor tables, so when the heavens suddenly opened and the rain cascaded down, I was an enchanted spectator rather than a soggy victim. I ordered an iced latte, and - thank you, Danny Meyer - it arrived with its own little pitcher of simple syrup, so I was spared the frustration of trying to dissolve sugar in a cold drink. Sitting there, gazing at the garden and a slice of cityscape that stretched along West 54th Street from the Rockefeller Apartments to the delectably ornamented Elizabeth Arden building on Fifth Avenue, I felt as if a New Yorker cover had come to life.Pilar Viladas is the design editor of T: The New York Times Style Magazine."

They have taken classes in ceramics and drama, and lessons in the saxophone, guitar and trumpet. Some lasted much longer, and required far more of an investment than others. I am probably forgetting a few. Most fell by the wayside, with the inevitable arguments about how much time is enough time to have given it a try.

In an effort to make it easier to find a cab during peak hours and provide some discounts, the Taxi and Limousine Commission recently approved a couple of pilot programs to allow multiple fares at the same time later this year. That move could also add to the cabbies' already-rich reserve of stories, as increased human interaction often does. City Room took the opportunity to ask some drivers: What is the strangest thing you've experienced while driving a cab in New York?"

It proved, once again, the stubborn power of sequels to draw Americans to the multiplex, especially those sequels that promise to replicate the original rather than striking out in unfamiliar directions.

A Norwegian appeals court had found the man, Bjoern Hoen, 41, guilty of providing the getaway vehicle that was used in the daytime heist. On Aug. 22, 2004, the Munch Museum in Oslo was raided by two armed masked men, who took &#8220;The Scream,&#8221; as well as a second Munch painting, &#8220;Madonna,&#8221; and drove off in a black station wagon. The works were recovered in 2006, but details on how and where they were found have not been made public. Mr. Hoen had admitted that he provided the car driven by the thieves but said that he did not know how the vehicle would be used. Two other men have been sentenced in the case, and a third suspect, whose name was not given, died in 2006."
2009-06-30T00:00:00Z,"Hey, ladies (and gentlemen)! Jerry Lewis is headed back to Broadway, this time in the director&#8217;s chair. The veteran comedian, last seen on a Broadway stage as Applegate in the revival of &#8220;Damn Yankees&#8221; in 1995, will direct a musical adaptation of his hit 1963 comedy, &#8220;The Nutty Professor,&#8221; that is planned for the 2010-11 season, the show&#8217;s publicists said in a news release. That film starred Mr. Lewis as the nebbishy Julius Kelp, who invents a formula that transforms him into the debonair Buddy Love. (A 1996 remake starred Eddie Murphy as the overweight Sherman Klump and his suave alter ego.) The adaptation will feature music by Marvin Hamlisch (&#8220;A Chorus Line&#8221;) and lyrics and book by Rupert Holmes (&#8220;Curtains&#8221;). A cast has not yet been announced."

Bidding was lively, but the sale totaled $8.4 million, shy of the low estimate of $8.7 million. The top seller was &#8220;That Was Then This Is Now,&#8221; above, a 1989 painting by Ed Ruscha. It brought $1.1 million, just below the high estimate of $1.2 million. A 1963 sculpture by John Chamberlain, &#8220;Mr. Moto,&#8221; fashioned from painted, crushed steel, sold for $876,443, in the middle of the estimate range of $636,000 to $954,000. But the item pictured on the catalog cover, &#8220;Spiritual America IV,&#8221; Richard Prince&#8217;s 2005 photo portrait of Brooke Shields, failed to sell. Final prices include the commission to Phillips: 25 percent of the first &#163;25,000 ($41,000), 20 percent of the next &#163;25,000 to &#163;500,000 ($41,000 to $825,000) and 12 percent of the rest. Estimates don&#8217;t include commissions. The auctions continue on Tuesday night at Christie&#8217;s, which is selling 41 works estimated at $28.6 million to $40.9 million."

2009-06-30T00:00:00Z,"JESSIMAN--Laura Woodberry, passed away last Wednesday near Durness, Scotland after a hiking accident while vacationing with family members near their second home in Scourie. She was 51 years old. She is survived by her husband Alistair, sons Hugh (25) and Andrew (23) and daughter Margaret (19). She was born Laura Lee Woodberry on August 17, 1957 in New York City. She was the eldest child of Paul and Sandy Woodberry of Dallas, Texas and Sea Island, GA. She is survived by her parents and four siblings: Seth Woodberry of Dallas, TX, Sturgis Woodberry of Darien, CT, Lesley Woodberry Robinson of Mumbai, India and Sarah Woodberry of New York City. She was the loving aunt of 18 nieces and nephews on both sides of the family. She grew up in Greenwich and attended Greenwich Academy before graduating from the Madeira School in Virginia. She spent a post-graduate year at the Uppingham School in Rutland, England where she was elected Head Girl. At Dartmouth College, in Hanover, NH, she captained the women's crew team, wrote for the student newspaper, and graduated in 1980 with the highest distinction in Asian Studies. She met her husband Alistair at Dartmouth. The couple married on Nantucket Island in May, 1981, and recently celebrated 28 years of marriage. After college, Laura worked as an associate banker at Manufacturer's Hanover Trust in New York City, where the Jessimans had their first son, Hugh. They moved to Hong Kong for four years in the 1980s, where their second son Andrew was born. Their daughter Margaret was born in 1990, shortly after they moved to Darien, CT. Son Hugh graduated from Brunswick in 2002 and is now a professional hockey player. He was an Ivy League Rookie of the Year while at Dartmouth, and was drafted in the first round by the N.Y. Rangers. He currently plays for the Nashville Predators organization. Son Andrew graduated from Wake Forest University in 2008, and works as a marketing associate at Priceline in Norwalk, CT. Daughter Margaret just completed her freshman year at Dartmouth, where she competes on the figure skating team. Laura's greatest joy was her family. She was a fixture on the sidelines of her children's sporting events, she was a class mother at Greenwich Academy, and she recently took up golf so she could play with her children. She had a passion for cooking and gardening, making those favorite family activities. She loved to visit new places and enthusiastically planned trips with her extended family. She recently returned from a trip to Rome with her parents and sisters, having accompanied them to France and Russia in past years. She also recently traveled with her husband and children to South America, Tuscany and Prague. Laura enjoyed hill-walking, bicycling and spending time with her friends and family. She also played the piano, studied French and Spanish and volunteered at The Waterside School in Stamford, CT. She loved music and attended the ballet and the symphony regularly. Laura was a remarkable wife, mother, daughter, sister, cousin, friend and always a mentor. To so many, she served as the person to whom everyone asked ""What would Laura think?"" She had a gift for friendship and will be missed dearly. A private funeral Mass will be held on Tuesday, June 30, conducted by family friend Reverend Gerry Murray. A memorial reception for Laura's friends and family will be held from 4 to 7 pm that Tuesday afternoon at the Country Club of Darien, 300 Mansfield Ave. On Wednesday evening, her son Hugh will participate in a benefit for the Obie Harrington-Howes Foundation to be held at the Darien Ice Rink at 7pm.

2009-07-01T00:00:00Z,"I miss the snow. Yes, I know the United States gets snow, but to my Canadian eye, American snow is like American health care: sporadic, unreliable and distributed unevenly among the population. In the heart of Ontario's snow belt, punishing squalls were a fact of life from November through mid-April. One time, 39 inches fell on my hometown in three days -- and school wasn't even canceled. And it wasn't just the quantity of snow -- it's the speed with which it arrived. When I was a child, it wasn't unusual for my 15-minute walk home from school to begin under clear skies and end in a blizzard. I remember once, when I was 8 years old, stumbling into my house, my hair covered in powder and my eyelashes frozen together, and screaming, ''Why do we live here?!'' My mother took my face in her warm hands and said, ''Because it's where people love you.''"

2009-07-01T00:00:00Z,"I miss the pride and simplicity of a national literature, which probably wouldn't exist without government support. We even have a name, CanLit, that people use without fearing they'll sound like nerds. In America we tend toward novels published specifically for one narrowly interpreted demographic. CanLit is an unassuming place, very welcoming to immigrant writers, and since it doesn't dice up readership according to profile there is a national conversation about literature, like a big book club. And I miss Winnipeg's winters, which any Winnipegger will tell you is ridiculous. Nonetheless, I miss the winter sun on snow and ice, the blue sky too cold for a scrap of cloud, and clear air like a healing draft so strong that too much will kill you. Walking in such weather is necessarily walking meditation, every breath sears with cold, every footfall in the snow crunches and squeaks.

Now, in the age of online social media, such responses are immediately amplified to the world. The novelist Alice Hoffman discovered last weekend that a few angry outbursts on Twitter could ricochet through the literary biosphere within minutes. Alain de Botton followed suit after posting a harsh comment on the blog of Caleb Crain, who had reviewed Mr. de Botton’s latest work, “The Pleasures and Sorrows of Work,” for The New York Times Book Review. Mr. de Botton didn’t like the review, and fired back: “I will hate you till the day I die and wish you nothing but ill will in every career move you make.” Ouch.

The return follows two years of negotiations over their rightful ownership: The Italians maintained that they had been looted from sites in Sicily, Sardinia, Apulia and Campania. An accord between the museum and the culture ministry was signed in November and the artifacts — which date from the 9th century B.C. to the 14th century A.D. — will now be returned to museums in their regions of provenance.

He also noted that the actor was found with his hands tied behind his head, adding: “He didn’t die of natural causes, and he didn’t die of suicidal causes from the nature of the ligatures around the body, so that leaves some kind of accidental death.” In June, the authorities in Thailand said it would take a month to know the results of their investigation into Mr. Carradine’s death."

He was terminated by the company in April after he wrote a column about watching a pirated version of the Fox movie “X-Men Origins: Wolverine” on the Internet. In his suit, Mr. Friedman said that his editors had not objected to the column, and had told him not to worry about his job after Rupert Murdoch, the News Corporation chairman, ordered the column to be taken down. In a public statement after Mr. Friedman’s firing, News Corporation said it had a zero tolerance policy for actions it believes promotes online piracy.

As we understand it, the legal question is whether the subject of the photo had a reasonable expectation of privacy. In most states, the courts tend to side with photographers who are on public property, or their own property, and take pictures of things that could be witnessed by any passer-by. The thinking is that people have no expectation of privacy if they have placed themselves where strangers can glimpse them. In the next week or so, we hope to revisit this whole subject in greater depth."

2009-07-02T16:03:42Z,"Admirers of Marc Newson's streamlined furniture and crisp industrial design may be surprised to see his latest creation -- a strikingly ornate diamond and sapphire necklace he conceived for Boucheron, the French jewelry house. The one-of-a-kind ""Julia"" necklace, which is being introduced at a couture-week party in Paris tomorrow evening, was inspired by Newson's obsession with fractals -- geometric shapes that can be subdivided into smaller versions of themselves, specifically the Julia Sets of fractals discovered by Gaston Julia in the early 1900s. ""Fractals are fascinating, complex and rich,"" Newson says, ""and gemstones really lend themselves to exploiting their beauty."" The scientifically-spawned sparkler contains around 2,000 paved stones and took the company's craftspeople 1,500 hours to realize using rapid-prototyping technology and a minimal three-prong setting, so the stones appear to float on the wearer's throat. One thing that won't be floating, however, is the price tag. ""I wasn't thinking luxury at all, but the technical rigorousness of the piece, as well as the sheer number of stones that went into it will probably make this one of the most expensive necklaces Boucheron's ever made.""

Survived by his wife, Amie B. Knox, wife of 58 years, and his four children: Graham, Robert (Dorothee), Amie (Jim Kelley), John (Page) and eight grandchildren. Graham's passion was medicine and after graduating from Columbia College in 1939, and Columbia College of Physicians and Surgeons in 1942, he joined the staff of St Luke's Hospital in New York, with which he was affiliated for more than 45 years. Graham served in the Navy medical corps from 1944-46, participating in the South Atlantic command and later in the invasion of Okinawa. He spent his entire medical career in New York City, both at St. Luke's and St. Vincent's Hospitals where he served in several leadership positions in their departments of vascular surgery. He was also a professor of Clinical Surgery at Columbia College of Physicians and Surgeons and was chief of vascular surgery emeritus at St. Vincent's Hospital. In addition, he served as president of the New York County Medical Society, the New York Surgical Society and the New York Cardiovascular Society. Dr. Knox took great pride in being a surgeon and commuted six days a week by car to New York City. He established lifelong relationships with many of his patients who later became among his closest friends. Graham continued to be an exceptional diagnostician even after his retirement and used his vast knowledge of medicine to advise friends and relatives on various medical issues. A memorial service will be held later in the summer. Contributions can be made to the Joseph Collins Foundation, 787 Seventh Avenue, Room 3950, New York, NY 10019."

The most popular title was “Thriller,” with 44,000 sales, followed by “The Essential Michael Jackson” and “Number Ones,” Billboard reported, based on early data from stores. Those albums, in the reverse order, were Mr. Jackson’s most popular last week, when he sold a total of 422,000 albums and 2.3 million single tracks online, breaking several records. Because all of Mr. Jackson’s albums are at least 18 months old, they do not qualify for the Billboard 200, the trade magazine’s standard albums chart."

Dementieva's serve may be the most improved shot on the tour, and she won a high percentage of both first and second serves against Williams, arguably the game's best returner. Like Roger Federer and Rafael Nadal on the men's side, Serena and Venus Williams have elevated the level of play on the women's tour, with their big serving, aggressive returns and seemingly indomitable wills. Give Dementieva credit for responding to the challenge; she was a shot away from the final, and, for long stretches of the match, outplayed Serena."

2009-07-03T09:00:15Z,"Last September, I wrote about dance music gaining credibility among high-minded indie aficionados, most notably with the critical praise given to the alt-disco bands Hercules and Love Affair, Cut Copy and LCD Soundsystem. Following the unofficial law of pop music that says it takes approximately nine months for a trend to go mass, the beat has officially moved from underground music blogs to the top of the pop charts.Evidence of this is everywhere: Lady Gaga, with her synth-heavy beats and lyrical odes to hedonism, fame and sex, has become something of a poster child for pop music's transition toward clubland. The Black Eyed Peas, a group with absolutely no pretensions toward anything but No. 1 hits, has just released ""The E.N.D. (The Energy Never Dies),"" a concept dance album that sounds like ""Daft Punk for Dummies."" The first official leak of Whitney Houston's eagerly anticipated comeback anthem, ""I Didn't Know My Own Strength,"" came through a throbbing house remix courtesy of the D.J. Peter Rauhofer that played at gay pride parties this past weekend from Toronto to New York. ""Loba"" (""She-Wolf""), the latest single from Shakira, an artist in tune with the international pulse, is a wonderful Giorgio Moroder-influenced dance-floor thumper that sounds like nothing she has put her hips to in the past. And finally, the passing of Michael Jackson was a powerful reminder of his transcendent grooves and otherworldly moves. Last I checked, Jackson had a whopping four of the Top 10 songs and Top 10 albums on iTunes. It's as if the entire globe has just rediscovered that Jackson's unprecedented talent bursts to life only when the bass line drops and we, his adoring audience, snap our fingers to the beat."

It is with great sadness that the Beth Israel Medical Center and Continuum Health Partners community acknowledges the passing of our dear friend, distinguished colleague and generous benefactor, Richard Netter, Esq. A member of the Board of Trustees of Beth Israel Medical Center for over 50 years, Mr. Netter was the longest serving member of the Board. He served in many leadership positions during his tenure, including Vice Chairman. Helping to build Beth Israel over the past 50 years has been a passion for Mr. Netter, and the hospital has benefited greatly from his leadership. He has served on the Continuum Board since its inception in 1997 and has chaired its Nominating Committee since then. Mr. Netter, along with his beloved wife, Alice, also a Trustee, championed many initiatives at Beth Israel through personal philanthropy and through his involvement as a guardian and board member of several foundations. In 2002, he was recognized for his leadership and many efforts on behalf of the hospital with the Beth Israel Charles H. Silver Memorial Award. He raised money to expand our outstanding music therapy program by establishing the Louis B. Armstrong Center for Music and Medicine. With the generous support of the Herbert and Nell Singer Foundation, Mr. Netter helped establish the Herbert and Nell Singer Division of Perioperative Services at the hospital, supporting major enhancements of the operating room suite. Among his many other philanthropic endeavors was the Thanks to Scandinavia Scholarship Fund, established with his good friend, the late entertainer Victor Borge, as an expression of gratitude to the people and governments of the Scandinavian countries for their rescue of Jewish people from the Holocaust. The Fund provides scholarships and fellowships to physicians, nurses, and other healthcare professionals from Scandinavia to study at Beth Israel and other institutions. Mr. Netter had an abiding love for Beth Israel's rich history and a strong commitment to its successful partnership with the other hospitals in the Continuum network. Most importantly, he was steadfast in his commitment to the collective mission of our institutions to always provide the highest quality, most compassionate care to patients from all walks of life. His wit, wisdom and advocacy will be greatly missed but will remain forever his legacy. This special man will be sorely missed. To Alice, his daughters, Laurie Sprayregen (Philip) and Patricia Shiland, his three grandchildren, and his countless friends and admirers throughout the world, we extend our most heartfelt condolences.

Under his leadership, the Peabody Museum and the Essex Institute were merged in 1992.

2009-07-04T00:00:00Z,"It's a kind of calligraphy, these ringlets and waves, hair combed, twisted and pinned. A first lady's coiffure is a pattern, chosen as deliberately as the White House china, but prey to wind and rain, especially on cold Inauguration Days. It's also prey to public opinion, should she dare to make quixotic changes in her 'do -- a sign of flippancy and flip-flopping. Notice there are no flips. In the beginning, we see a newborn empire in those Josephine curls. The mid-20th century is marcelled. And in recent decades, increasingly liberated first ladies sport more leonine locks. Interestingly, there are no bangs. Perhaps this has less to do with hair and more to do with campaign promises of marital harmony and world peace. -- LAURA JACOBS, the author, most recently, of ''The Bird Catcher''"

Magna, Canada's biggest auto parts manufacturer, was chosen in May by the German government as the preferred bidder for Opel, which has its headquarters outside Frankfurt. In Britain, where Opel owns two factories that make vehicles under the Vauxhall brand, the government may lend money to help complete the sale to Magna, the business secretary, Peter Mandelson, above, said.

Statistically, I would guess that the chances of the guest getting another favor are pretty small. That’s the nature of lotteries. It’s equally hard to imagine why that Hyatt customer would recommend the Hyatt to a friend. Odds are the friend wouldn’t win a favor; so imagine the potential for envy and resentment in that friendship.

But economic turning points are notoriously hard to identify, especially when a parade of data can seem to contradict itself. After the 2001 recession, 20 months passed before the National Bureau of Economic Research officially determined its endpoint. To get a feeling for how cycles are evolving, economists at the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development have been watching a chart of industrial production, based on data from manufacturers, miners and utility companies. (In the United States, industry's share of the economy has fallen to about 20 percent, but it still moves roughly in step with the economy as a whole.)

2009-07-05T00:00:00Z,"WIMBLEDON, England -- Nighttime tennis has arrived on Centre Court, but the long American tradition of Breakfast at Wimbledon is not endangered. Such was the claim of Ian Ritchie, the chief executive of the All England Club, in an interview about the future effect of the new Centre Court roof. ''Building the roof was never done on the basis of, here's a great commercial opportunity,'' Ritchie said, noting that the plan for the project predated his arrival as the chief executive in 2005. ''It was built as an insurance against the weather and, to a lesser extent, the light.'' In other words, there is no intention to create separate day and night programs, as there are at the United States and Australian Opens, or to move the women's and men's finals into a prime-time night slot. ''We have said pretty consistently that it is not something that is attractive to us, and that we consider Wimbledon to be a summer, outdoors event,'' Ritchie said. ''We don't want to have what they have in the U.S. and Australia.'' He acknowledged that the fourth-round match between Andy Murray and Stanislas Wawrinka that was played under the roof and lasted until 10:39 p.m. had drawn what he called an ''astonishing'' audience on BBC. Ritchie said the number of viewers for Murray-Wawrinka peaked at 12.6 million for a 56.4 percent audience share, which he said was comparable for the 2008 Champions League soccer final between Manchester United and Chelsea. The five-set match was so electrifying it immediately set off speculation that scheduled night tennis at Wimbledon was an inevitability. Ritchie said, ''We have no intention of doing that.'' He said that adding a night session would not be as lucrative an arrangement aspeople may believe because ''ticket revenue is a relatively small proportion of the overall gross'' at Wimbledon. In addition, he said the tournament must always be mindful of its grass courts, unlike the hardcourts, where, he said, ''you can play all day and night.''"

It's a pastime for people to complain about the fans' choices, but fans are not obligated to vote for the players having the best seasons. They are supposed to vote for the players they want to see. This holds true even though, since 2003, the league that wins the All-Star Game has been rewarded with home-field advantage in the World Series. Teams with home-field advantage are 3-3 in the World Series since the adoption of the new rule. The fans deserve credit for their selections so far. They have recognized the surprise season of RAUL IBANEZ by making him the top vote-getter among N.L. outfielders. And despite ALEX RODRIGUEZ's celebrity, the fans have gone for EVAN LONGORIA in a rout at third base in the A.L. Other than JOSH HAMILTON, who has been injured most of the season, all the other selections appear to be legitimate. Take first base in the A.L.: MARK TEIXEIRA leads in extra-base hits, KEVIN YOUKILIS in on-base percentage. Both are stars, either would be a good choice."

It was a very tragic battle that night, not only for the family, but for the U.S. Navy. It was an unbelievable thing to see the monument with the word Quincy on it. Had my mother and father been alive today, they would have been quite taken aback with the whole thing. Eileen made the arrangements for a boat to take us to where the Quincy sank, and off we went on a very choppy day. My brother Jack had passed away recently and his son gave us a little container with some of the ashes. A sister had a Boy Scout badge of Billy's, with the troop number, which she pasted on a rock so that it would sink.

2009-07-05T00:00:00Z,"FLEMING--Phyllis J.,Sarah Whiting Francis Professor of Physics, Emerita, at Wellesley College, died after a long illness on June 23, 2009. A physicist, she dedicated her life to the enhancement of opportunities for women in science as a pioneer in teaching, research and service. She believed to know a subject one must teach it. Thirty of her Wellesley students completed doctorates in physics including Persis Drell, the Director of the Stanford Linear Accelerator Center. Among the countless others she inspired with her wit and wisdom was Pamela Melroy, the astronaut. As Dean of Wellesley from 1968-1972, she organized the MIT-Wellesley Exchange and the Continuing Education Program which enabled women whose education had been interrupted to complete their degrees. After her return to full time teaching, she wrote a successful textbook and served as Department Chair and Director of the Science Center. Born in Shelbyville, Indiana, she was graduated from Hanover College in 1946 and earned her M.S. and Ph.D. from the University of Wisconsin-Madison in 1948 and 1955 respectively. She was the recipient of many awards. Hanover honored her with an Alumnae Award in 1963 and an Honorary D.Sc. in 2003. In 1982 at Wellesley, she was the first scientist to win the Pinanski Prize for Distinguished Teaching. Later she also was the first winner of the Janet Guernsey Award for Exceptional Lifetime Achievement for her service to faculty, students and alumnae. More recently, she was named a 2009 Alumni Fellow of the UW Physics Department. In addition to her 50 year Wellesley career, she also taught at Mt. Holyoke College from 1948-1950. She completed her career by tutoring at Cape Cod Community College for five semesters. She is survived by her sister, Helen Lorenz, her brother-in-law, two nephews and two great-nephews and her life partner, Linda B. Miller, South Wellfleet, Mass.

2009-07-05T00:00:00Z,"It's doubtful that Landon Donovan will be hosting a welcome-back dinner in Beverly Hills when his Galaxy teammate David Beckham returns to Los Angeles this month. In a new book, Donovan, the American midfielder, questioned Beckham's commitment, his leadership and his motivation for playing soccer in the United States. ''When David first came, I believed he was committed to what he was doing,'' Donovan is quoted in ''The Beckham Experiment,'' by the Sports Illustrated writer Grant Wahl. ''He cared. He wanted to do well. He wanted the team and the league to do well.'' But something changed, according to Donovan, and Beckham decided soon after Coach Ruud Gullit was fired that it was not worth his time. ''He just flipped a switch and said, 'Uh-huh, I'm not doing it anymore,''' Donovan said. ''I can't think of another guy where I'd say he wasn't a good teammate, he didn't give everything through all this, he didn't still care.'' The relationship appeared amiable in public but was rife with tension, some jealousy and suspicion, according to Wahl's account, due out July 14 and excerpted in Sports Illustrated. The relationship between Beckham, Major League Soccer's most expensive player, and Donovan, its most successful American star, had a rocky start when Donovan was pressured to give up the captaincy. ''Let him be the captain; you be the star,'' the team's former general manager Alexi Lalas reportedly told Donovan at the time. But what the club's brass did not tell Donovan, according to Wahl, was that the request did not come from the team's leadership, but from Beckham's camp. ''He didn't have a problem with someone else being captain, least of all a player with Beckham's credentials, but he did have an acute sense of being disrespected,'' Wahl wrote. That feeling, and questions about Beckham's attitude, persisted as Donovan grew weary with his teammate and Beckham grew weary of M.L.S. When Beckham went to A.C. Milan, Donovan was left with a team bereft of talent. With Beckham's return scheduled for July 16 -- against the Red Bulls -- one has to wonder how the two will get along. ''Donovan had wanted the Beckham Experiment to work, and there was no reason in his mind that it still couldn't be successful in 2009,'' Wahl wrote. ''But not if Beckham continued acting the way he had during the last half of 2008.'' This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print."
2009-07-05T00:00:00Z,"Much of the attention in this year's All-Star balloting has focused on the race for the American League's starting first baseman. In each of the last four weeks of voting results, the top spot changed hands between MARK TEIXEIRA of the Yankees and KEVIN YOUKILIS of Boston. Separated at one point by as little as 1,209 votes in Teixeira's favor on June 9, the two were 40,047 apart in Youkilis's favor in the last round of published results Tuesday. When the starters are announced Sunday, it will be either the bulky Red Sox folk hero or the player that spurned them for their bitter rival. Regardless of that outcome, all of the attention has benefited Boston in another way, with DUSTIN PEDROIA, Youkilis's teammate, making a dramatic comeback in the balloting for starting second baseman. On June 9, IAN KINSLER of the Texas Rangers had a comfortable lead of 250,078 votes. By June 16, Pedroia had narrowed it to 200,238. On June 23, it was 58,390; in the last set of results Tuesday, it was just 6,830. With the polls closed, fans will have to wait to see if the race is able to rival the closest of all All- Star votes, when MANNY TRILLO of the Philadelphia Phillies edged STEVE SAX of the Los Angeles Dodgers by 1,625 for the National League's starting spot at second base in 1982."

The league's board, citing debt and higher expenses, canceled the 2009 schedule in December and hopes to play again in 2010. ''We get to keep the trophy for two years because we're in suspension,'' Bon Jovi said, smiling. He added: ''But here's the truth. If we come back, we will set a new benchmark for what is sports ownership. ''This is more than a lockout. We're on the brink of the abyss. I can tell you thousands of man-hours are spent trying hard to keep those players employed and keep our fans satisfied.'' Bon Jovi said the league's chances for survival were 50-50. He added that he would like to explore ownership of an N.F.L. team. ''Yeah, why do you think I'm getting this education?'' he said about his A.F.L. experience. Bon Jovi is a longtime Giants fan and a season-ticket holder. ''One of the things I hang my hat on as a sports owner is that I'm looking for men of character,'' he said. When wide receiver Plaxico Burress shot himself in the thigh with an unlicensed handgun on Nov. 29 in a Manhattan nightclub, he put the Giants' season in disarray and reaffirmed Bon Jovi's philosophy as an owner: ''Not characters.

Macur answered readers' questions about the Tour, the issues facing cycling, the top riders in this year's race and what it takes to win the coveted yellow jersey. The complete Q&A is available at nytimes.com/sports. Q: Will Lance Armstrong concede the leadership role to Alberto Contador without making a fuss? A: Whether Lance Armstrong, the seventime Tour de France champion, will lead Astana or not is the biggest question of the race right now. He has said that the race itself would decide which rider will be the leader and that he will accept whatever happens. At the team presentation, he told the crowd that his most important goal of his race was to help Astana win. I don't think Armstrong will make a fuss about the battle, at least through the news media. So far, he has played down his chances to beat Contador, saying his age, his midseason injury and his time off the bike has put him at a disadvantage. The odds are, however, that he will do his talking on his bike. Beating Contador may just be his biggest challenge at the Tour -- ever. Q: Is Christian Vande Velde deliberately flying under the radar, or is his star, like many others, eclipsed by Armstrong?"

Curated by Luca Missoni, son of Ottavio and Rosita Missoni, the husband and wife who turned knitwear into wearable art in the 1960s, the exhibition displays both original garments and photographs of several signature pieces, like the spring-summer collection of 1968, above. ''The designs created by the Missonis drew inspiration from European art of the Modernist era,'' said Roberta Cremoncini, director of the Estorick Collection (www.estorickcollection.com). In support of this theory, works by modern artists like Gino Severini, Sonia Delaunay and Tancredi, all featuring boldly colored geometric patterns -- and are on loan from the Missonis' private art collection -- are part of the show. The exhibition also explores the processes involved in producing the designs. Drawings and sketches are on view, as well as photographs and a 30-minute documentary film. Two videos show designs in progress from conception to realization, and an installation focuses on a loom while it produces a typical striped material. Admission is £5, or $8.40 at $1.68 to the pound. The Estorick Collection is at 39a Canonbury Square, London N1; (44-20) 7704-9522."

2009-07-05T00:00:00Z,"Every so often a baseball player does something that gets people talking about the unwritten rules of baseball. Earlier this season, Detroit's GERALD LAIRD attempted a bunt in the sixth inning of a game in which Boston's JOSH BECKETT was pitching a no-hitter. According to the unwritten rules of baseball, it is not acceptable to bunt in order to break up a no-hitter. Laird did not get a hit, but the no-hit bid was broken up the next inning. Two weeks ago, Kansas City's BRAYAN PENA was chewed out by Houston catcher IVAN RODRIGUEZ, who thought that Pena was peeking at signs and location from the batter's box. Again, that is a no-no according to the unwritten rules of baseball. Pena hit his first home run of the season later in the at-bat. So where do these unwritten rules of baseball come from, and why has no one bothered to write them down? First of all, they have been written down. In 1986, Baseball Digest published a fairly comprehensive list that can still be easily found on the Internet. The list, titled ''The Book of Unwritten Baseball Rules,'' originally appeared in The Orange County Register and was written by PETER SCHMUCK (who now writes for The Baltimore Sun) and RANDY YOUNGMAN, who still writes for The Register. The list consisted of 30 items, but was heavy on strategy with suggestions like, ''Never throw behind the runner'' and ''Don't hit-and-run with an 0-2 count.'' It does not say anything about shouting to distract a player who is settling under a pop-up, which ALEX RODRIGUEZ did in 2007. It also does not mention swinging at a 3-0 pitch or not stealing a base when your team is way ahead late in a game. But do not worry, baseball fans; many of those unwritten rules have now been written down as well. In 2008, ROSS BERNSTEIN wrote, ''The Code: Baseball's Unwritten Rules and Its Ignore-at-Your- Own-Risk Code of Conduct.'' This March, PAUL DICKSON wrote more simply, ''The Unwritten Rules of Baseball.'' There are more unwritten rules other than not bunting to break up a no-hitter, or not peeking, or not shouting or not stealing with a big lead. There is no crying in baseball (that one comes from the classic baseball movie ''A League of Their Own''). There is no showboating, no headhunting and no sign stealing. Everyone leaves the bench during a fight, and it is bad form to show up an umpire over balls and strikes. Many of these rules are broken all the time, and they can begin to get confusing, as when Tampa Bay's B. J. UPTON stole second and third base with his team down nine runs against the Indians earlier this season. Cleveland's VICTOR MARTINEZ and KERRY WOOD took exception, even though the Rays ended up scoring seven runs before finally losing, 11-7. ''If you're going to get respect, show respect,'' Martinez told reporters after the game. Like the Mafia, it seems, baseball is all about respect and not writing things down. Later in the series, Wood was brought in to face Upton and threw a pitch behind him (which is often the way these unwritten rules are enforced) before tempers flared and the benches cleared. When Rays Manager JOE MADDON was asked about the book of unwritten rules after the game, he responded, ''There's a lot of pages out of the book that need to be burned.''"

2009-07-05T00:00:00Z,"TECHNICALLY not an alley but the nickname for the stretch of West 28th Street between Fifth and Sixth Avenues, where several sheet music publishers had offices in the late 1880s until the early 1930s. It got the label because the chaos of sound produced by so many pianos, playing at the same time on one street, was said to sound like the clanging of pots and pans, which at the time were made of tin. ''Jewish immigrants, many of them experienced salesmen, figured out if you can sell neckties, you could sell songs,'' said Philip Furia, a professor of creative writing at the University of North Carolina at Wilmington and an author of ''Irving Berlin: A Life in Song.'' ''They opened up sheetmusic publishing houses where they created the songs in their offices. They had composers, arrangers and lyricists, and they ground out songs almost assemblyline.'' Irving Berlin 1888-1989 Famous Songs: ''God Bless America'' ''White Christmas'' ''Easter Parade'' ''Alexander's Ragtime Band'' ''Cheek to Cheek'' Famous Stage Musicals: ''Annie Get Your Gun'' ''Call Me Madam'' Why He's Important: Born in Russia and raised in poverty on the Lower East Side, Berlin had a long and varied career as a composer and lyricist, writing for Tin Pan Alley, Broadway and Hollywood. ''He was the most versatile songwriter,'' Mr. Furia said. ''Whatever happened in music, Berlin was at the forefront of it, unlike other composers who were good at one kind of thing. He was so long-lived. He was popular until rock 'n' roll. He just couldn't make that transition.''"

He served in many leadership positions during his tenure, including Vice Chairman. Helping to build Beth Israel over the past 50 years has been a passion for Mr. Netter, and the hospital has benefited greatly from his leadership. He has served on the Continuum Board since its inception in 1997 and has chaired its Nominating Committee since then. Mr. Netter, along with his beloved wife, Alice, also a Trustee, championed many initiatives at Beth Israel through personal philanthropy and through his involvement as a guardian and board member of several foundations. In 2002, he was recognized for his leadership and many efforts on behalf of the hospital with the Beth Israel Charles H. Silver Memorial Award. He raised money to expand our outstanding music therapy program by establishing the Louis B. Armstrong Center for Music and Medicine. With the generous support of the Herbert and Nell Singer Foundation, Mr. Netter helped establish the Herbert and Nell Singer Division of Perioperative Services at the hospital, supporting major enhancements of the operating room suite. Among his many other philanthropic endeavors was the Thanks to Scandinavia Scholarship Fund, established with his good friend, the late entertainer Victor Borge, as an expression of gratitude to the people and governments of the Scandinavian countries for their rescue of Jewish people from the Holocaust. The Fund provides scholarships and fellowships to physicians, nurses, and other healthcare professionals from Scandinavia to study at Beth Israel and other institutions. Mr. Netter had an abiding love for Beth Israel's rich history and a strong commitment to its successful partnership with the other hospitals in the Continuum network. Most importantly, he was steadfast in his commitment to the collective mission of our institutions to always provide the highest quality, most compassionate care to patients from all walks of life. His wit, wisdom and advocacy will be greatly missed but will remain forever his legacy. This special man will be sorely missed.

Martins, who creates his images with long exposures but without digital manipulation, traveled from rural Georgia to suburban California, visiting large construction projects that began during the speculative boom years and then came to a sudden halt, often half-finished, when the housing and securities markets collapsed. The abandoned or stalled developments -- and Martins's photos of them -- can be seen as signs of the hubris (and occasional criminality) that typified the boom and the economic and human damage that remained in its wake. ''The sudden shift in the economy unmasked such excess,'' Martins says, reflecting on the sites he visited. ''People are present in these images, but not physically.

Some of that coastline is also gritty (Gowanus, anyone?), but there are plenty of peaceful and pristine spots. The city's smallest beach, at 40.4 acres, is Manhattan (which is actually in Brooklyn), and its largest is Coney Island, at right, with 107.12 acres; Coney's beach and Boardwalk ranked ninth last year in attendance among the nation's 75 urban parks. JENNIFER MASCIA SADDEST BEACH Lonelyville, on Fire Island. The origins of the name, in use since the 1880s, are a mystery. GEEKIEST BEACH Gilgo, in Babylon (Suffolk County). Gilgo is the fictional meeting place -- in the year 2354 -- of Capt.Benjamin Sisko and his wife, Jennifer, in ''Star Trek: Deep Space Nine.'' SCARIEST BEACH Atlantic Avenue, in Amagansett (also in Suffolk County). During World War II, a secret United States Navy communications post there tracked German U-boats. Then, on June 13, 1942, four Nazi spies landed a mere 200 yards away. Awkward! But neither group knew that the other was there. The spies buried their uniforms in the sand, dressed as fishermen and hopped a train to Manhattan. They were apprehended three weeks later."

Mr. Harrigan graduated from NYU in 1942 while serving in the US Navy, received his MBA from NYU in 1949 and, while employed at Western Electric, earned his PhD in Economics from the Stern School of NYU in 1959. During World War II he first served in Naval Intelligence and, after attending Supply Officers School at Harvard, saw sea duty as an officer on a supply ship carrying landing craft in the Pacific. He recalled the ""cheers of the crew when the last B-29 returned from its mission."" In 1947 he joined Western Electric, where he served as Comptroller, then Financial VP and, then until 1972 as CFO and a board member. In 1972, he joined International Paper as its CFO and a member of the board. After he retired in 1982, he taught business management courses at the Stern School. He married Margaret Marrin in 1941. During most of their married life, Margaret, who earned her Masters Degree in Social Work from Columbia University, worked as a family counselor, and became a highly sought-after speaker on these subjects. They were a very close couple who excelled at combining family life with two careers long before this life pattern became common. They were happily married for fifty-three years until her death in 1994.

2009-07-08T09:47:22Z,"For much of the 1990s, when the phrase “adapted from the ‘Saturday Night Live’ sketch” was applied to a comedy feature film — think “A Night at the Roxbury,” “It’s Pat” or “Stuart Saves His Family” — it was usually a sign that that movie would end up as ill-fated as Mr. Bill. Now, The Hollywood Reporter says, plans are rapidly falling into place for the first “SNL” skit-to-movie screen transfer since “The Ladies Man,” to be adapted from the recurring “MacGruber” comedy sketches featuring Will Forte."

2009-07-08T11:11:27Z,"At a sentencing hearing on Tuesday in Toronto, the theater producers Garth H. Drabinsky and Myron I. Gottlieb proposed that they undertake a lecture tour of Canadian schools as part of their punishment for fraud convictions, Bloomberg News reported. In March, Mr. Drabinsky, the founder of the Broadway production company Livent, and Mr. Gottlieb, his business partner, were convicted of forgery and defrauding shareholders of more than $400 million. The company’s Broadway productions included “Ragtime,” “Kiss of the Spider Woman” and “Showboat.” At the hearing Tuesday, Mr. Drabinsky’s lawyer, Edward Greenspan, proposed that in lieu of a prison sentence his client visit 65 Canadian schools to teach theater students about “discipline in the craft” and “avoidance of unethical conduct,” according to Bloomberg; Mr. Gottlieb proposed visits to six universities to discuss business ethics. Prosecutors called the proposals “a drastic departure” from traditional punishments. The defendants could be sentenced to up to 10 years for fraud and 14 years for forgery at a hearing on Aug. 5."
2009-07-08T12:16:12Z,"LONDON — The plucky American mezzo-soprano Joyce DiDonato triumphed over a fractured right fibula at the Royal Opera House here on Tuesday night, by all reports, and won an enormous ovation. As the entire opera world seems to know by now, on Saturday night, at the opening of a six-performance run of Rossini’s “Barbiere di Siviglia,” Ms. DiDonato slipped onstage just after her Act I aria and broke her right leg. Somehow, she carried on, hobbling, limping, using a crutch in Act II and gamely trying to ignore the pain."

On Wednesday, HBO said in a news release that in December it would broadcast “Robin Williams: Weapons of Self-Destruction,” a comedy special filmed during his tour of the same name. The special, Mr. Williams’s fifth for the cable channel and his first since “Robin Williams: Live on Broadway” in 2002, will be recorded during his performances in November at DAR Constitution Hall in Washington. Mr. Williams is slated to resume his tour in Bloomington, Ind., on Sept. 30. He had surgery in March to replace his aortic valve, repair his mitral valve and correct his irregular heartbeat. The show was to have come to the Neil Simon Theater on Broadway in April and May, but no alternate dates for those performances have been announced."

Billboard reported that Mr. Reznor said that Nine Inch Nails would play a “handful of shows” in New York, Chicago and Los Angeles beginning Aug. 22. Though the band’s recent tour with Jane’s Addiction was meant to be its swan song, Mr. Reznor wrote on the official Nine Inch Nails Web site, nin.com, that “many shows were in daylight — it just didn’t feel right to end NIN that way.” Dates for specific shows were not announced, but Mr. Reznor wrote that the New York performances would take place at Bowery Ballroom, Webster Hall and Terminal 5.

2009-07-08T13:39:36Z,"Fans of Michael Jackson who have sought a place in New York to worship the fallen King of Pop have recently been short one shrine: for several days, the wax figure of Mr. Jackson that stood at Madame Tussauds New York — a rendering arguably as haunting as the person it depicts — has been absent from that Times Square attraction. A spokeswoman for Madame Tussauds said that the wax figure of Mr. Jackson, who died on June 25, was loaned on July 2 to the museum’s Washington branch for the singer’s fans in the nation’s capital who had requested it. She said that the wax figure was due to return to the New York location on Friday, adding, “Sometimes with shipping, sometimes there’s delays.” In the meantime, admirers of pop icons can still find wax renditions of Jimi Hendrix, Biggie Smalls and Elvis Presley at the New York museum."

The actor originated the character (whose last name, according to the release, is pronounced “(p)Shub-er-shef-ski”) when “Superior Donuts” made its debut last year at the Steppenwolf Theater in Chicago. Mr. McKean last appeared on Broadway in the 2007 revival of Harold Pinter’s “The Homecoming,” though he is perhaps best known for portraying David St. Hubbins, the singer and guitarist of the mock rock band Spinal Tap. The Broadway production of “Superior Donuts” is to be directed by Tina Landau, who also directed the Steppenwolf production.

2009-07-08T15:07:43Z,"For the second week, the real action in music sales was to be found on Billboard’s catalog album chart, for albums released more than 18 months ago: the top 10 slots were occupied by records featuring Michael Jackson, and two of Mr. Jackson’s albums outsold the No. 1 album on the Billboard 200 chart. According to data from Nielsen SoundScan, Mr. Jackson’s “Number Ones” sold 339,000 copies and “Thriller” sold 187,000 for the week ending July 5. (Each album sold just over 100,000 copies in the week ending June 28, three days after Mr. Jackson’s death.) By comparison, the top album on the Billboard 200 chart, the 31st installment of the “Now That’s What I Call Music!” compilation series, sold 169,261 units. Among the more unusual beneficiaries of the Jackson sales boom, Agence France-Presse reported, has been the Dutch pension fund ABP, which in 2008 purchased the rights to several of Mr. Jackson’s songs, including “Remember the Time” and “You Are Not Alone.” The top five positions on the Billboard 200 chart were rounded out by Brad Paisley’s “American Saturday Night,” Rob Thomas’s “Cradlesong,” “Wilco (The Album)” by Wilco and “The E.N.D.” by Black Eyed Peas."

The world's attention will be on important agenda items like trade, food safety and climate change, but one minor detail caught my eye: the Italian luxury linen company Frette is providing each leader with a monogrammed set of Egyptian cotton sheets, towels and his-and-hers bathrobes. Now, it's important to note that, in conjunction with this promotional vehicle, Frette has made a charitable donation to support those affected by the earthquake, a commendable effort. But while I'm all for showcasing Italian craftsmanship, and I'm sure Barack and Angela and Dmitri are going to be much more productive after sleeping like babies on their 600-thread-count sheets and swaddling post-shower in plush terry robes, I still have to wonder: Does anyone think that they really need such swag?

Almost invariably, they wobbled badly, flailing out with their arms and having to put their foot down much sooner than people who'd never sprained an ankle. With this simple experiment, the doctor made a critical, if in retrospect, seemingly self-evident discovery. People with bad ankles have bad balance."

Mr. de Peralta was born in New Orleans on November 8, 1914, the son of Pedro Grave de Peralta, who was the then Argentinean Ambassador to the United States and Adele Gloria de Peralta who was actively involved in New York society. Mr. de Peralta began his business career as the leader of his band ""Armando and his Ambassadors"" and as the owner of the Pago Pago Club, a popular nightclub frequented by New York society in the 1930s and 1940s.

During his military service as a Corporal with the 375th Field Artillery Battalion, Mr. de Peralta was injured by a misplaced land mine resulting in the total paralysis of his legs. Fortunately, Mr. de Peralta had not allowed his military injury to deter him from commencing a new career in the shipping industry where he started as an employee for 26 years with Thor Eckert & Co. prior to founding his own shipping company, Peralta Shipping Corporation which became the exclusive transatlantic shipper of the paper products of International Paper Company and the St. Regis Paper Company. After Mr. de Peralta sold his shipping business, he commenced several new careers as a real estate investor and developer, a co-producer of a variety of Broadway musicals, an author of eight published books of romantic poetry, and as a philanthropist. Mr. de Peralta's life was the subject of an improvisational ensemble play ""Life Game"" at the La Jolla Playhouse Forum in 2000.

Wonjun Park, a young artist in South Korea, came to America in 1973, and he worked at many different jobs to make a living while pursuing his art whenever he could. In January 2008, Mr. Park learned he had gastric cancer, which had spread to his liver. He underwent surgery to remove parts of his stomach and liver in March, and he began 10 months of chemotherapy in May. His battle with cancer has caused him to question his beliefs, and to discover a desire to live on through his art, even after his death. ''Art was something I had to do all the time to feel I am alive,'' Mr. Park said. But his experience led to a reassessment. ''Have I created art just to satisfy and to console myself, who has been overwhelmed by uncertainty and death?'' Mr. Park wrote on his blog in Korean. ''After I was sentenced to death and my mind was jailed in my own body,'' as he describes his cancer in his blog, he realized his desire to live on through his art. ''Art is not just to satisfy oneself,'' he said. ''Art is not just to express oneself. Art is also my instinct to protest death, and the will to live through it.''

2009-07-09T11:16:25Z,"To bring Daniel Craig and Hugh Jackman together in a movie would probably require a budget of hundreds of millions of dollars and, perhaps, a screenplay about secret agents and mutants. To get the actors together on Broadway, it just took a story about Chicago cops. Mr. Craig, the star of the James Bond movies “Casino Royale” and “Quantum of Solace,” and Mr. Jackman, who plays Wolverine in the “X-Men” movies, will star in the Broadway production of the Keith Huff play “A Steady Rain” for a limited run this fall, its publicists said Thursday in a news release. The play, to be directed by John Crowley (“The Pillowman”), will run at the Gerald Schoenfeld Theater, with previews scheduled to begin on Sept. 10 and an official opening of Sept. 29. Its limited run is slated to end on Dec. 6. The play will mark the Broadway debut of Mr. Craig, who has previously acted at the Royal National Theater (in “Angels in America”) and in the Peter Hall Company at the Old Vic (in “Hurlyburly”). Mr. Jackman won the Tony Award for best actor in a musical in 2004 for his portrayal of Peter Allen in “The Boy From Oz.”"

One element of the generous house antipasto -- which pretty much everybody in the nearly all-local crowd ordered -- was an inch or so of what looked like soft salami. Well, it was soft salami, or sausage at any rate, but with the difference that it hadn't been aged much; hardly at all, in fact, just long enough to let the salt and pepper settle in. The raw pork, a nice balance of fat and lean, was highly seasoned and impeccably trimmed and chopped -- you can imagine that running into any strands of connective tissue in a thing like this could ruin the effect, if not the evening.

2009-07-09T00:00:00Z,"MARGOLIS--Barbara Ann, on July 3, at age 79. Born in Malden, MA, the daughter of Eli and Shirley Schneider. She was an alumna of Simmons College. Barbara was New York City's Chief of Protocol under Mayor Ed Koch. Starting with her association with the Vera Institute of Justice in the mid-1960s, she developed a passion, a base of knowledge, and a group of like-minded friends and colleagues that allowed her to effect considerable positive change for the incarcerated in New York City. In 1980, she started the Rikers Review, a publication written and produced by inmates on Rikers Island. Nine years later, she created Fresh Start, a program that brought many of New York's best chefs and restaurateurs to Rikers Island to teach inmates about the industry and train them to work as food professionals. She served on the Board of Trustees of the Vera Institute of Justice, was a member of the Board of Corrections, served on the Board of the Osborne Association, and was a founding member of the Board of Trustees of the New York Correction History Society. She received the Correctional Association of New York's highest honor, the 1844 Medal Award, in recognition of her outstanding activism to advance the well-being and rehabilitation of prisoners. The Horticultural Society of New York was another singular source of joy in her volunteer life, combining her passion for prison reform issues (through its Rikers Island ""Green Team"" program) and a commitment to cultivating beauty for its own sake. She joined the Board of the Horticultural Society in 1989 and was named Chairman of the Board in 2007. She was married for fifty years to David I. Margolis until his death in December 2008. She is survived by her four children: Brian, Robert, Peter, and Nancy; five grandchildren: Porter, Sophie, Delphine, Harry, and Maximilian; and one sister, Arline Guefen.

She was a strong proponent for the use of therapeutic gardening techniques and a major supporter of our Horticultural Therapy Rehabilitation Programs on Rikers Island. In 2007, Mrs. Margolis was elected Chair of the Board and she founded an annual art auction to raise money for The Society's outreach programs.

NBC said Friday afternoon that its new series “Parenthood,” about the reunion of a multi-generational family in California, would be delayed until early 2010 because Maura Tierney, one of its stars, had been sidelined by an illness. The network said production would be postponed for eight weeks “due to medical evaluation” that Ms. Tierney is undergoing. Ms. Tierney was expected to play a cash-strapped daughter who returns home to live with her parents in the series, which is loosely adapted from the 1989 film of the same name. On NBC’s fall schedule, “Parenthood” will be replaced by “Mercy,” a medical drama that had been scheduled for midseason. The stars of “Mercy” “have been summoned to start work on the series early to have it ready for a September debut,” The Hollywood Reporter said."

Mr. Johns has revealed that there are power rings of nearly every color stripe, including red, orange, yellow, blue and indigo. It could’ve been hokey, but it works thanks to a legion of new characters and the well-defined motivation of each new corps. It’s all leading up to “Blackest Night,” an eight-issue miniseries that begins next week."

2009-07-10T11:06:39Z,"Just when it looked like the television airwaves in Russia were safe for foul mouthed, crudely animated American children, an episode of the animated series “South Park” has been censored there to omit a scene that poked fun at the Russian prime minister Vladimir V. Putin, The Associated Press reported. On Friday, a spokesman for the Russian cable channel 2×2 said that an episode of “South Park” it had shown on Tuesday night had omitted a scene in which the show’s young characters phone Mr. Putin, seeking his help to launch a dying whale to the moon. (In the cartoon, Mr. Putin concludes that he is receiving a prank call from President George W. Bush.) The 2×2 spokesman did not indicate whether the 2×2 channel or television regulators had made the cut, telling The A.P., “the given scene in this version was absent.” Last year, Russian prosecutors issued an official warning to 2×2, saying that its broadcast of the “South Park” episode “Mr. Hankey’s Christmas Classics” promoted “hatred between religions,” but in June, a Moscow court canceled that warning."
2009-07-10T11:58:11Z,"If you had millions of dollars to spend on a tribute to Michael Jackson, what would you use it for? A museum? A statue? How about a scaled-down replica of the singer’s Neverland Ranch? A group of Chinese developers are pursuing that third option, with plans to build it on an island off Shanghai as a shrine for fans of the King of Pop, Reuters reported. Citing the China Daily newspaper, Reuters said that the developers planned to build their replica of the whimsical, Los Olivos, Calif., property on Chongming island, at a cost of about $15 million, to be completed by the 2010 Shanghai World Expo next July. Qiu Xuefan, an investor in the project, told China Daily that it was a tribute to Mr. Jackson that would “offer the Chinese people an outlet for expressing their love toward him.” Mr. Jackson lived at the Neverland Ranch until 2005. It was purchased last year by Colony Capital L.L.C. as a joint venture between that company and Mr. Jackson."

But in this weekend's Travel section, Lionel Beehner suggests that a better way to experience Pamplona is to go any other time than during the bull run - that the charms of this ancient city are best experienced when you aren't trying to dodge a bull with mayhem on his mind. Based on this past week's events, that's probably good advice. As The Times's news blog, The Lede, pointed out earlier today, a 27 year-old man was gored to death by a bull on the fourth day of the week-long festival, a tragic event captured in this explicit, grisly video. Better to take Mr. Beehner's advice: Skip the bulls and hit the tapas bars instead."

2009-07-10T00:00:00Z,"WEIL--Ira Ira Weil, a scientist who worked on the Manhattan Project in World War II, died after a brief illness June 20 at his home on Manhattan's Upper West Side. He was 87. As a research chemist at several companies, he held patents for innovations in a number of areas, including detergents and skin treatment products. Ira was born in the Bronx on October 19, 1921 and grew up in Brooklyn. He graduated from New Utrecht High School and earned a BA in chemistry from Brooklyn College in 1942. While still an undergraduate, he was recruited into the Manhattan Project, where he joined his brother Lester and also met his first wife, fellow scientist Adele Rubenstein. After the war, he completed his doctorate in physical chemistry at Columbia University and moved to Cambridge, MA, where he was an instructor in chemistry at Harvard University. Following Adele Weil's death in 1950, he returned to New York and spent the rest of his career as a research chemist in the private sector, briefly as head of his own company and later at Lever Brothers (now Unilever) until his retirement in 1986. In 1958 he married Alice Ehrenfeld of New York, a lawyer, who as Alice E. Weil rose to be the highest-ranking woman to serve in the United Nations, as Assistant Secretary General for General Services. An outspoken, independent-minded liberal and veteran of many peace and civil rights demonstrations, Ira grew increasingly pessimistic about his country's direction in recent years, but happily, he lived to witness and thoroughly relish the Democratic landslide of 2008. In retirement, he maintained a decades-long enthusiasm for opera and theater and added new interests, including birding in Central Park and, until her death in 1996, frequent overseas trips with Alice, whose work required extensive foreign travel. We will remember him warmly as a wise and steadfast friend and as an engaging and cheerfully opinionated raconteur and conversationalist, with a rich fund of memories from his boyhood in Depression-Era Brooklyn as well as some alarmingly colorful tales from the realms of science and industry. Ira is survived by a sister, Edna, of Fort Worth, TX; two brothers, Lester, of Menlo Park, CA, and Sanford, of Canton, NY; a son from his first marriage, Eric, of Newton, MA; two children from his second marriage, Jonathan, of Seattle, and Ann, of Walpole, NH; and his beloved grandchild, Ann's daughter Alice. He was a member of Sigma Xi, Phi Lambda Upsilon and the American Chemical Society. A private burial service was held at Wellwood Cemetery, Farmingdale, NY, on June 22."
2009-07-10T00:00:00Z,"MARKS--David V. P.,54, of Manhattan, passed away on July 8, 2009. Beloved son of the late Margaret and John Marks, he was the cherished brother of Michael Marks and the late Laura Marks, the brother-in-law of Jill Darrow, and the loving uncle of Katie and John Marks, whom he adored. David was privileged to attend The Dalton School; Harvard College, where he studied economics under Nobel laureates Kenneth Arrow and Wassily Leontief and graduated summa cum laude; Harvard Law School, where he received his J.D. degree, cum laude; and the Harvard University Graduate School of Arts and Sciences, where he studied under Nobel laureate Thomas Schelling and received his A.M. and Ph.D. degrees in economics. David's scholarly publications include ""Competition in the Investment Banking Industry"" (Harvard University Press), co-authored with Harvard Business School Professors Samuel L. Hayes, III and A. Michael Spence, and ""Signposting: The Selective Revelation of Product Information"" (Harvard Business School Press), co-authored with Kennedy School of Government Professor Richard J. Zeckhauser. David was a member of the bar in Massachusetts and New York. David began his business career as President of The GMS Group, Inc., a strategic consulting firm that he formed with two Harvard Law School professors to furnish advice to firms in the financial services sector. Later, David was President of an independent music publishing company, St. Nicholas Music Inc., and was a private investor in intellectual property, securities, fine art and other assets. David's interests were numerous and varied. He studied and collected Renaissance and 19th century Renaissance revival decorative arts, arms and armor, and furnishings. He was a longtime student of the history of New York architecture, especially its residential architecture. He served on the boards of various preservation organizations including Carnegie Hill Neighbors, the Defenders of the Historic Upper East Side, and the Historic Neighborhood Enhancement Alliance. David was active in The Episcopal Chaplaincy at Harvard for 30 years, including serving as Finance Committee Member, Treasurer, Vice President and, most recently, President. David's quest for perfection in everything he did was an inspiration to all who knew him. He also encouraged and cultivated perfection in all of those around him, the end result of which was a litany of enduring friendships. He was deeply loved and will be greatly missed. A memorial service will be held on Monday, July 13, at 11:30am at the Frank E. Campbell Funeral Chapel, 1076 Madison Avenue at 81st Street. In lieu of flowers, please consider a donation in David's memory to Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center, 1275 York Avenue New York, NY 10065, www.mskcc.org."

2009-07-10T00:00:00Z,"SCHNELLING--Anthony (Tony) H. N.,Founder and CEO of Bridge Associates LLC, a Noted Turnaround and Restructuring Firm, dies at 62. Tony Schnelling spent his life crossing and then creating bridges. He rode through the Khyber Pass at 12 and when he was 42, he spent three months riding horseback in Mongolia, ultimately convincing the herders that American men could not only ride but also wrestle. He spoke six languages fluently. His facility with languages, including multiple dialects of German, allowed him to bring a bit of home to a German woman who found herself waiting tables in Boise, Idaho. While at college, he bridged the chasm between athletics and academia by graduating from Swarthmore College while being recognized as an All American soccer player. After earning an MBA from Harvard University in 1972, he built a bridge to renewed profitability for the faltering family printing business. Tony then realized he needed a new challenge and went to Fordham Law School at the age of 41, graduating cum laude. After law school, Tony joined the New York law firm of Stroock & Stroock & Lavan, where his practice encompassed both general corporate and insolvency law. He represented corporate debtors, secured lenders and creditors in bankruptcy cases and out-of-court restructurings in a variety of jurisdictions and industries in the United States and Europe. But again he saw another path. In 1997, he founded a boutique financial consulting firm aptly enough named Bridge Associates LLC specializing in advising businesses in all aspects of financial restructuring. Over the next decade, he built the firm into a leading professional services organization focused on providing advisory, crisis and interim management and litigation support. He also acted as a trustee in a number of cases, leading the recovery of tens of millions of dollars for creditors. Tony's engagements as a turnaround and restructuring specialist included such high profile cases as Refco, Heilig-Meyers and Conseco Finance to name just a few. But even as a re-structuring professional, Tony continued to build bridges, including one in Calpine, Inc., where he was retained as a Court appointed expert by the Honorable Burton Lifland and eventually bridged the seemingly insurmountable gap between the numerous constituencies leading to a consensual resolution. At the time of his death, the firm had seven partners and 40 professionals in offices located in New York, NY; Tulsa, OK; Chicago, IL; Dallas, TX; Cleveland, OH; Nashville, TN and Tampa, FL. Tony never stopped tapping out messages and making calls on his omnipresent Blackberry. From his beloved home in Amenia, New York, he worked on client and firm matters until the time of his death, taking conference calls from his bedroom, and continuing to provide sage counsel and strategy to clients and colleagues until the end. When long time friend and partner, Carl Young, asked Tony to take it easy, Tony's answer was, ""Carl, I am going to be asleep for a long time - this is more fun."" David N. Phelps, another of Tony's partners, stated, ""Not only in business, but in every aspect of his life, he was loved by a wide range of people and admired by an even bigger circle. I know I speak for all of his partners, colleagues, clients and friends when I say we will miss him dearly."" Tony was described by those who were close to him as a visionary who warned about the current economic crisis, but who also had a gift to see novel and innovative solutions, where others saw problems and roadblocks. ""He could look at an abandoned paper mill sitting on top of a toxic waste site and could see a recreational marina,"" said Louis Robichaux, a partner of Tony's. Even after leaving the practice of law, Tony continued to strengthen the connection between law and business, becoming an Adjunct Professor at Fordham University School of Law, as well as a member of the School's Board of Directors. Additionally, he founded the Anthony Schnelling Scholarship Fund, awarded to students entering law school after being in the workforce for several years. He also taught at Columbia University's School of Business in New York and at the Jones Graduate School at Rice University in Houston. He served as the Vice President of Development for the American Bankruptcy Institute and was a member of the organization's Board of Directors. He was recently elected by his peers as a Fellow of the American College of Bankruptcy. Tony is a past member of the Board of Directors of The Pomfret School and was also a long-term supporter of Canine Companions for Independence, which honored him with their Hearts and Heroes Award for his fund raising efforts. There are many words to describe Tony but his wife, Bettina Whyte put it best. ""Tony was amazing. In his life, in his work, in his intellectual abilities, in his compassion, in his commitment to friends and family - he was simply amazing."" He is survived by his wife, Bettina M. Whyte, and his mother, Emily Leeser. He also leaves behind his half-sister, Eva Claire Schnelling of Houndstooth, England. In lieu of flowers, the family has asked that donations be made to The Anthony Schnelling Lectureship Series in Commercial Bankruptcy at Fordham University School of Law."

Ian's art has appeared internationally, in galleries, books, magazines, and newspapers. His recent works centered around his eccentric humor and delight in puns.

''The plan was to get away from New York in February. We had gone to Chichén Itzá, the Mayan ruins, and ended up somewhere in between there and Tulum. From what I understand, cenotes are formed when underground water breaks down the stone to create these sinkholes. I had never heard of them before, but they turned out to be everywhere. People even had them in their backyards. This one was in the middle of a sleepy little Mexican town. I just decided to jump in. You know when you've been in the sun all day, your body is sort of swollen and you're exhausted? It felt liberating, the end of a nice birthday -- which I normally spend in Sweden or New York, where it's freaking cold. When we were leaving, I recognized some Norwegians arriving -- the language is very easy for us to understand. But you just pretend you don't know what they're saying. I said ''Enjoy'' in English. They arrived the same way as I did -- thinking it was incredibly exotic and special -- and I didn't want to ruin their moment.'' As told to Seth Kugel"

Martinez, 20, in the majors only because of a raft of injuries, was hitting .176 and swinging at balls at his eyes. Manager Jerry Manuel said that if Martinez's struggles continued, the organization risked damaging his confidence for the long term. The Marlins found themselves in a similar position with outfielder Cameron Maybin, a top prospect. Maybin, 22, was hitting .202 in May when he was sent to Class AAA New Orleans.

Ever since, he has been foraging in Brooklyn backyards in search of 18th- and 19th-century specimens tossed into abandoned outhouses, which he calls ''pits.'' He gets a rush of anticipation that can keep him awake the night before a dig. After identifying a promising location, Mr. Fortmeyer begins the excavation process by probing the soil with a pointed steel pole to locate the cistern or privy. In the early days, a fellow collector showed Mr. Fortmeyer how to make probes from scrap metal found in abandoned cars; he now buys them from a steel manufacturer. He digs in private yards and offers the homeowners their pick of the artifacts he finds, but he said they rarely keep any because ''they see how hard we work.'' Mr. Fortmeyer is known to his fellow bottle diggers as ''Fireman Jack.'' He and his wife, Delores, raised their children on Long Island but moved to Boerum Hill, Brooklyn, after Mr. Fortmeyer retired, for the digging."

That is a noteworthy achievement for a company that made its name selling a puny plastic-clad motorcycle just as Detroit was birthing its most flamboyant whales. For a broad swath of American consumers, Honda -- a brand applied not only to cars and motorcycles but also to generators, lawn mowers and anything else the world's largest engine maker could power -- is the maker of unpretentious good stuff at accessible prices.

The results, which are the subject of ''Mademoiselle,'' a new book published by Steidl, include expected images of her (striking a meditative pose, a Kent cigarette dangling from her mouth) and some rare moments of charm: smiling from behind a screen, joking with one of her models; sharing a cocktail with her staff. ''There are hardly any photos of her -- even when young -- with such a winning smile, with such a lightness in her expression,'' Karl Lagerfeld, who conceived and designed the book, writes in the foreword.

2009-07-12T00:00:00Z,"STEPHENS--Claude Odell, affectionately known as ""Claude O. Stephens,"" the former President and Chief Executive Officer of Texas Gulf Sulphur Co. (TGS), died peacefully at his home on Thursday, July 9, 2009. He was 100 years old. Stephens was born to Buford Dured Stephens and Carrie Madeline Collins Stephens on October 6, 1908 in Darbun, Mississippi. He graduated from Bay City (Texas) High School where he played football and basketball. He obtained a degree in Petroleum Engineering from Louisiana State University (LSU). In his senior year at LSU, he was a cadet colonel; he commanded the LSU ROTC Regiment and received the Kemper Williams Sabre. At the outbreak of World War II, Stephens was commissioned as a second lieutenant of Infantry in the U. S. Army. He received additional training at the Infantry School in Fort Benning, GA. Stephens later rose to the rank of major and served in Japan as the War came to a close. He was awarded the Bronze Star. While still in college, Stephens' father died. As the eldest son in the family, he took on the responsibility of providing for the family. Stephens obtained employment with TGS as a driller's helper and assisted his mother with raising his younger siblings. As a result of his hard work ethic, skill, and intelligence, he quickly rose through the ranks and became rig supervisor. Stephens became an engineer for TGS in 1938 after he graduated from LSU. Ten years later in 1948, he was assigned to head the TGS office in Worland, Wyoming where he and his crew revolutionized the sulphur extraction process. This process permitted sulphur to be produced from sour natural gas. In 1952, Stephens was appointed as a Vice President of TGS and assigned to its New York office. He became a director of TGS in 1956. Stephens was named President and CEO of TGS in 1958 and assumed oversight of sulphur production facilities throughout the United States and Canada. Under his leadership in the 1960s and through the early 1970s when he retired, TGS diversified its operations and substantially increased its stock value. Stephens was greatly respected and admired by all who worked for and with him. LSU honored Stephens as ""Alumnus of the Year"" in 1968. In 1970, he was awarded the Distinguished Alumni Award and the President's Award. He was a Diamond Life Member of Pi Kappa Alpha Fraternity and a 32 Degree Mason, Siloam Lodge No. 276 (Oklahoma). Stephens is survived by his wife of forty-nine years, Lois B. Stephens; brothers Charles Stephens of Odessa, Texas and Fred Stephens of Sun City, Texas, and a host of nieces, nephews, great-nieces and great-nephews. He was preceded in death by his brother, Buford Aubrey Stephens and his sister, Doris Kathleen Stephens. For memorial service information, please contact Marilyn J.

Kuroda, with his bent front leg and rear foot dragging over the mound -- the presumed cause for the troublesome blisters on the top of his right foot -- appears to use the motion. Bartolo Colon, trying to hang on to his career, is also a drop-and-drive pitcher. The Phillies prospect Kyle Drabek fits the mold.

Charles, the Prince of Wales, resigned from the British Society for the Protection of Ancient Buildings after the group rejected a foreword that he wrote for a book about restoration.

The society declined the foreword after Prince Charles said he would not make any changes to it. Last month the Prince found himself in a public dispute with the architect Richard Rogers, after Charles wrote that the architect’s now canceled plans for a housing development in Chelsea would clash with other architecture in the area, including the Royal Hospital designed by Christopher Wren."

He attended The Hill School in Pottstown, PA, received his Bachelor of Arts in Architecture from Yale University and his Master of Landscape Architecture from Harvard University. He also served as a Fighter Pilot, Captain, in the United States Air Force from 1954 to 1957. Ed Stone began his career in Fort Lauderdale with Frederick B. Stresau, one of the pioneers of landscape architecture in the State of Florida. In 1960 he founded Edward D. Stone, Jr. and Associates (EDSA), Fort Lauderdale, FL, one of the preeminent planning and landscape architecture firms in the world. Ed was elected a Fellow in the American Society of Landscape Archiects/ASLA in 1974 and awarded the Society's prestigious ASLA Medal in 1994, the ""highest honor the American Society of Landscape Architects may bestow upon a landscape architect whose lifetime achievements and contributions to the profession have had a unique and lasting impact on the welfare of the public and the environment."" Under his leadership, EDSA has received over 140 statewide, national and international awards. Ed was exceptionally proud of the EDSA Minority Scholarship which is awarded yearly by the ASLA. EDSA's most recent honor, the ASLA Landmark Award co-sponsored by the National Trust for Historic Preservation for PepsiCo's world headquarters in Purchase, NY was particularly gratifying. Designed over thirty years ago, PepsiCo's corporate campus was recognized for its excellence and inspiration to its people and their purpose. Among DSA's other projects are Atlantis in the Bahamas, PGA National Resort Community in Palm Beach Gardens, FL, Madinat Jumeirah in Dubai, Fort Lauderdale's Beach Revitalization and Riverwalk, Daufuskie Island in South Carolina and Nova Southeast University in south Florida, and John's Island in Vero Beach, FL.

CBS News kept calling, looking for someone to say on camera the criticism I felt: huge sums being justified by cold war arguments about militarizing space, and there was no way to vote for using that money to solve big problems on Earth. CBS finally sent a car and swore I would be back in an hour.

Everything happened just as I expected, except for one detail. I had not expected that the television camera would be the most important part of the mission, the first item to be deployed and the last to be abandoned. That was the big surprise, that NASA planned the Apollo operation as an international sporting event with the whole world watching. This strategy was brilliantly successful, but it had an unfortunate consequence. When the Russians walked out of the game, we walked out too."

At the moment of the Moon shot, I had really started to identify myself with the antiwar part of my generation. When I heard we had gone and landed on the Moon, I thought this was yet another depredation. This seemed like part of the technology of war, which it wasn't."

Mr. Gelb, 55, a former record executive, took over from Joseph Volpe in the fall of 2006 with aggressive marketing plans to draw new audiences. But the Met has been grappling with a deficit. Donations are down, and the company's endowment, once as high as $300 million, was down by a third at the beginning of 2009. Senior staff members -- including Mr. Gelb -- had a 10 percent pay cut starting in December, said Peter Clark, a Met spokesman, who confirmed Mr. Gelb's 36 percent pay increase for the 2007-8 season. The Met declined to comment on Mr. Gelb's contract. Nonunion employees are scheduled to take a 10 percent cut, beginning in August.

2009-07-14T00:00:00Z,"An interest in space exploration wasn't anything new in my life. My mother was a space enthusiast and I grew up interested in the conquest of space. So I was tracking all that stuff for years. In 1966, I went on a campaign to get high-quality photographs of the Earth taken from space. Despite the space race, there had still been no strong photographs of the Earth from space. So when Apollo 8 went up on Dec. 29, 1968 -- the same year we first published the ''Whole Earth Catalog'' -- they finally took the first Earthrise photograph, the famous one that everyone now knows. And that helped spawn the environmental movement. That became the planetary icon. It replaced the mushroom cloud as the dominant image of the age, replacing an image of fear with an image of hope."

2009-07-14T00:00:00Z,"KNUTSON--Donald I.,Ph.D., 68, Mathematician 1941-2009. On Friday, Donald Knutson, son of Charlotte and Henry Knutson, died at his home in Park Slope twenty-five months after being diagnosed with brain cancer. At M.I.T., Dr. Knutson earned his bachelor's degree, his doctorate and his wife, Andrea Allen Knutson. Don's 1968 doctoral thesis, ""Algebraic Spaces"", is still widely read today by those pursuing algebraic stacks. Don taught at Boston College, Columbia, where he guided doctoral students, and Fordham. In 1978, after receiving an M.B.A. from Columbia, Don started a 29-year career as a financial executive at CBS Television Network. Early in his career he was asked to determine what CBS should bid for the Olympics and NFL contracts. For the latter, Don's first step was to ask what the letters NFL meant. Later he developed many of the analytical systems that are in use at CBS today, and which he was still improving up until the day before he was diagnosed with a tumor in the center of his brain. After his surgery he attacked his neurological problems with a no-fuss cheerful curiosity. He relearned the alphabet using his grandson's puzzles, rejoined the Brooklyn Conservatory Chorale, attempted to dine in every Park Slope restaurant, and hiked the hills of Prospect Park, the Berkshires and the Swiss Alps. Even after last winter when a second tumor paralyzed his right side, he regarded dressing himself one-handed as an interesting project and continued to attend at least two plays or concerts weekly. The only challenge that he found heartbreaking was the decline in his ability to play the piano. Don is survived by his wife Andrea, his children Allen and Miranda, his grandchildren Fionn and Taran, his brother Robert, his five cats and his 5,000-book library.
