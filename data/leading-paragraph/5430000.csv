1989-11-26T00:00:00Z,"LEAD: FREUD DESCRIBED COLLECTORS AS MISERLY, PEDANTIC, STUBBORN and compulsively tidy. And indeed, most do confess their boundless penchant for objects is, well, a little eccentric.

Some of this housing already is built and sits empty, because of threats made by the Palestinian Liberation Organization against any Arab who tries to improve his physical conditions."

1989-11-26T00:00:00Z,"LEAD: Few legal principles are as established as the one that holds that when you go to a baseball game you accept the risk of being hit by a foul ball. Courts have held so over and over. But that particular judicial word has not gotten through to a court in Chicago. Last week, a Cook County Circuit Court jury awarded a 16-year-old boy, Delbert Yates Jr., $67,500 of Cubs money for damages suffered when he was hit by a foul ball at Wrigley"
1989-11-26T00:00:00Z,"LEAD: Yes. Not all sports can be judged popular according to a professional standard. Soccer is a game played by millions of youngsters and adults across America. The United States doesn't need a professional soccer league to make the game popular. All we need are the youths to play the game, a few experienced coaches and a baseball outfield on which to play."
1989-11-26T00:00:00Z,"LEAD: It used to be like a fever with me, a compulsion, a madness: to go into a bookstore, head straight for the brand-new books, flip right to the back of the jacket and see if the author was young or old, my age or even - rats! - younger. Envy is a vocational hazard for most writers. It festers in one's mind, distracting one from one's own work, at its most virulent even capable of rousing the sufferer from sleep to brood over another's triumph."
1989-11-26T00:00:00Z,"LEAD: ALMOST everyone I know has a driver's license, yet none of my friends have ever shown theirs to me. Perhaps they are as ashamed of the photograph on it as I am of mine. People usually don't show them around, proudly, like baby pictures. Instead, they are carefully hidden in billfolds or handbags, retrieved only when identification is required."

1989-11-26T00:00:00Z,"LEAD: I've been thinking a lot lately about what is wrong with the world, and I have finally decided: data overload. Because of the proliferation of computers and of people capable of running them, we are awash in information that nobody needs - or worse, that nobody believes. Gatherers of statistics have great power, but they usually operate quietly."

1989-11-26T00:00:00Z,"LEAD: Until recently, few people made a fuss when a neighbor posted a ''For Sale'' sign on his front lawn, since it usually remained there for a just few weeks. Moreover, the right to do so seemed - like the right to decorate a front yard at Christmas - indisputable. It was, after all, a personal act on private property."
1989-11-26T00:00:00Z,"LEAD: Watching the Macy's Thanksgiving Day Parade - from the comfort of my armchair, thank you - reminded me of the years I used to venture out early in the morning to capture the parade on film. It never snowed, like it did this year, but it always seemed to be either bitterly cold, raining or both."

1989-11-26T00:00:00Z,"LEAD: Cold fusion may not have worked in science labs this year, but late-1980's popular music has been happily knocking together genres to release new energy. De La Soul's ''3 Feet High and Rising'' (Tommy Boy 1019) sets three calm, droll rappers amid unexpected borrowings; its loopy playfulness and peace-symbol graphics were quickly dubbed ''hippie-hop."

1989-11-26T00:00:00Z,"LEAD: For This Week: If the Thanksgiving Day snow has melted, plant bulbs; they are better in the ground at this late date rather than tossed and forgotten in the back of a garage or toolshed. Be sure the compost pile is securely piled so it does not blow down or away in winter storms. Lightly prune rambler and climbing roses, if their canes are subject to wind damage."

1989-11-26T00:00:00Z,"LEAD: If the controversial paper by Dr. Baltimore et al. that appeared in the journal Cell is so important, have any other laboratories tried to repeat their results and publish them?

1989-11-26T00:00:00Z,"LEAD: Joel Brinkley portrays the Intifada as the shebab - as masked young men - who throw stones at Israeli soldiers and settlers (''Inside the Intifada,'' Oct. 29). In April, I was part of a delegation of lawyers and medical professionals who spent two weeks in the West Bank and Gaza. The Intifada is, indeed, stone throwers, but, more significantly, it is the resistance to Israeli occupation."

This is most assuredly not the London of Christopher Wren or of John Nash. Nor is it the London of Prince Charles, who has made it clear that he expects this huge tower to be a desecration of the city's skyline."
1989-11-26T00:00:00Z,"LEAD: OFFICIALLY it is New Jersey State Prison, but more often than not it's called Trenton, the end of the line, the toughest maximum-security prison in New Jersey, a place from which, it is said, there are only two ways out: over the wall or with a toe tag."

1989-11-26T00:00:00Z,LEAD: It makes good sense to reverse the course of a game against the average opponent because the chances are he will either not catch on to the alteration of circumstances or be too slow or timid to react forcefully.

1989-11-26T00:00:00Z,"LEAD: No. The American sports mentality simply does not have the patience or attention span for a continuous-play game. Half the fun of football, baseball, basketball, etc., is the time when there is no action. During these breaks we argue over the pros and cons of our team's performance, go to the refrigerator, mull our ineptitude in this week's pool picks, and on and on."
1989-11-26T00:00:00Z,"LEAD: Frankly, I find soccer as exciting as watching ice melt. The sport has evolved into a series of 0-0, 1-0, and 2-1 games.

The bulk of them are harvested by boat, but at Oostduinkerke, shrimp fishermen on horseback still drag their nets at low tide to scoop up these tiny glistening delicacies.

1989-12-03T00:00:00Z,"LEAD: Short films are so pitilessly noncommercial that they become havens of freedom; film makers might as well give up any idea of reaching a large audience and do the most wildly inventive work they can. The exception to this rule occurs in film schools, where fledgling producers, directors, writers and cinematographers put together brief films commonly known as ''calling cards'' to the industry, meant to show agents and producers that these students have become professionals."

1989-12-24T00:00:00Z,"LEAD: Years ago, if you watched Bill Cosby, Danny Kaye or Tim Conway, you could see humorous sketches about dentists. Today, things are totally different. Barbara Klaus, a person who wants to inflict pain on dentists to compensate for the fact that she is not funny, couldn't get into comedy school and obviously failed whatever writing courses she might have taken."

1989-12-24T00:00:00Z,"LEAD: THE magic of Christmas is a fleeting gift of childhood. Once gone, it can almost never be recaptured. As the season approaches, a brief glimmer of a long ago Christmas will be recalled by a carol overheard, the sparkle of a decoration or the familiar scent of fresh pine. It comes and goes so quickly that sometimes we can scarcely identify what it is that brings on that feeling of excitement and anticipation we associate with a more innocent time in our lives."

After sharpening their claws on Mr. Spira's politically correct Naugahyde furniture, do his cats hunt, kill and eat mice?"
1989-12-24T00:00:00Z,LEAD: ONE of the treasures of the kitchen is a recipe for hors d'oeuvres that can be whipped up at the last minute with ingredients that are always on hand. Such a failsafe is a godsend when unexpected guests drop in or when nothing beyond a bowl of salted nuts comes to mind to serve before a dinner party.
1989-12-24T00:00:00Z,"LEAD: In 1979, as a rookie, Ottis Anderson replaced Terry Metcalf as the St. Louis Cardinals' tailback.

1989-12-24T00:00:00Z,"LEAD: Since dentistry has made so much progress in the prevention of tooth and gum disease, it saddened me to read the article. As a psychotherapist and spouse of a dentist, it seems clear that dental phobia is much harder to cure and prevent than cavities."
