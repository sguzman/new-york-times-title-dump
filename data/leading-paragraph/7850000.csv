He earned his Bachelor of Arts degree at Brooklyn College in 1954 and graduated from Columbia Law School in 1959. He joined Weil, Gotshal & Manges LLP in 1969 as the Firm's 14th partner and was an integral member of the Firm for the majority of his long and distinguished career. From September 2002 to March 2007, he was a Managing Director and Vice Chairman of the independent investment bank Greenhill & Co. Mr. Miller created Weil's bankruptcy practice and, in so doing, elevated the practice of bankruptcy law to the large law firm environment as a profitable and mainstream practice group of most major U.S. law firms. Throughout his career, he played a key role in the most significant, notable and complex bankruptcies and restructurings in history, including Lehman Brothers, General Motors, American Airlines, R.H. Macy, Texaco, WorldCom and Enron. He also played a key role in managing Weil. Mr. Miller, along with three other partners, managed the Firm up until it elected its first Executive Partner in 1989, and his leadership and vision significantly impacted Weil's evolution from a small, two-office law firm to one of the world's major full-service firms. Described by colleagues as a gifted teacher as well as practitioner, Mr. Miller spent significant time teaching at a number of institutions, including Columbia University Law School, Yale Law School and New York University School of Law. He trained and mentored a number of future leaders of the restructuring bar, and championed young talent. He was the consummate practitioner, colleague and friend to so many. Mr. Miller was a member of the National Bankruptcy Conference, a fellow of the American College of Bankruptcy, a fellow of the American Bar Foundation, and a Trustee of the Committee on Economic Development. Mr. Miller loved the opera, and he was a long-time Advisory Director for The Metropolitan Opera. Mr. Miller's vast contributions to the law and the community will live on through the many people he impacted throughout his life and career. He will be missed greatly by his many colleagues and friends at Weil and beyond. Mr. Miller was a beloved and devoted husband. He is survived by his wife, Ruth. In honor of Mr. Miller, Weil has established the Harvey R. Miller Lecture Series at Columbia Law School. To make a gift, please make your check payable to Columbia Law School and indicate The Harvey R. Miller Lecture Series Fund. Send to the attention of David Strumeyer, Executive Director for Weil, Gotshal & Manges LLP, 767 Fifth Avenue, New York, NY 10153. 1/3"

2015-04-29T00:00:00Z,"KALPAKJIAN--Gary, beloved husband, father, grandfather, and great -grandfather, died on April 21st, 2015 in Gulf Stream, Florida. Born in Constanza, Romania in 1927 to loving Armenian parents Mihran and Nevart Kalpakjian, in 1937 he left Europe with his parents and brother Henry to come to America. They settled in Brooklyn, where he met Helen Hartigan, whom he married in 1950. He graduated Brooklyn Technical High School and enlisted in the US Navy at the outbreak of World War II, but after losing his brother in the war he completed his service in Jacksonville, Florida.

There, Gary pioneered a home frozen food delivery service named Thrift-Pak, and over the next 30 years he expanded the business nationwide as Colorado Prime, eventually earning a public listing on the New York Stock Exchange. His foresight in combining convenience and quality with home delivery anticipated many current trends, proving itself far ahead of its time.

2015-04-29T00:00:00Z,"NAPOLEON--Marty. Marty Napoleon, Jazz Pianist, a man who lived a life of true passion has died April 27, 2015 at 93. Benny Goodman, Louis Armstrong, Gene Krupa, Charlie Barnett are just some of the jazz luminaries who Marty played piano with. Born in Brooklyn on June 2, 1921 to Sicilian Immigrants Matteo Napoli and Giovanina (nee Giamporcaro) (A/K/A Marty and Jenny Napoleon). Marty was destined for a life in music. Music constantly filled the Napoleon household. His father Marty played banjo. His mother Jenny played guitar and sang. Older brothers Teddy (piano), Andy (drums), older sister Marge Alleluia and younger sister Jo Shine were vocalists. And his Uncle Phil gained fame as ""Phil Napoleon and His Memphis Five"". Marty's father and his brother Andy were also artists. Blessed with innate talent and combined with a passionate dedication, Marty began his illustrious career as a teenager, playing with Bob Astor's band. At age 20, he joined Chico Marx and his Orchestra, with lead singer 16 year old Mel Torme. He soon became a favorite of all the top jazz musicians, who wanted the remarkably talented and always jovial Marty to join them...George Auld, Teddy Powell, Joe Venuti, Lee Castle, Charlie Barnett, Benny Goodman, Gene Krupa, Charlie Shavers, Coleman Hawkins, Red Allen and Charlie Ventura. Soon he became part of the legendary ""The Big Four"" which included Marty, Buddy Rich, Chubby Jackson and Charlie Ventura. He went on to form several groups who gained wide- spread fame...particularly in the early days of the Hamptons. Included in these groups were Ronnie Odrich, Doc Severinson, and Morgana King, among others. Marty also had a two-piano quartet with his brother Teddy on the second piano, in Las Vegas. Marty gained his greatest fame and joined the pantheon of all-time greats playing with Louis Armstrong and His All Stars, replacing Earl Hines in 1952. He toured the world with the All Stars. They were featured on the Dean Martin Show, Johnny Carson, Dick Cavett, Jackie Gleason and Danny Kaye shows. They also did an NBC special with Herb Alpert. He continued playing with ""Satchmo"" over the years until Louis' final performance at the Waldorf Astoria. Marty's distinctive piano virtuoso can be heard on many of Armstrong's biggest hits, including ""Hello Dolly"", ""Mame"", and ""It's A Wonderful World"". Over the course of his storied career Marty played at the top Jazz venues - Michael's Pub, the Metropole, Basin Street East, and the World Trade Center. He performed at the most prestigious jazz festivals in the world - Newport, Kool, JVG, and San Remo (in Italy). In 1992, Marty did a one-man Concert at Carnegie Hall. 1987 was a particularly good year for Marty. He was selected to play with Lionel Hampton at the historic Frank Sinatra Show at Carnegie Hall and topped that by playing at The White House for President Ronald Reagan. Marty's movie credits include ""To Beat The Band"", ""The Glenn Miller Story"", ""All That Jazz"", ""The French Connection"", ""Raging Bull"" and ""Tootsie"". Marty never lost his passion for music, playing Jazz concerts into his early 90's with his friends Ray Mosca and Ron Odrich. But Marty Napoleon's passion extended way beyond the keys of his piano. Marty was all about family. Marty was married to the love of his life, the late ""Bebe"" (nee Marie Giordano) Napoleon for 67 years. He was a loving father to Jeanine and her husband Steve Goldman, and to Marty Jr. and his wife Teresa. He adored his grandchildren Cherie Napoleon Goldman, Todd Goldman, Marty Warren Napoleon and Brent Napoleon, and they adored him. (Brent was instrumental in helping his grandfather put together all his biographical notes for a book.) He was also the cherished greatgrandfather of Alexander Napoleon Inoa. The world will miss this amazing talent. His friends and family will miss this amazing man. The family will receive friends Thursday 3-5, 7-9 at McLaughlin Kramer Megiel Funeral Home, 220 Glen St. Glen Cove, NY. Religious Service Friday 12 noon. Interment St. Johns Cemetery, Middle Village, N.Y. 1/3"

He earned his Bachelor of Arts degree at Brooklyn College in 1954 and graduated from Columbia Law School in 1959. He joined Weil, Gotshal & Manges LLP in 1969 as the Firm's 14th partner and was an integral member of the Firm for the majority of his long and distinguished career. From September 2002 to March 2007, he was a Managing Director and Vice Chairman of the independent investment bank Greenhill & Co. Mr. Miller created Weil's bankruptcy practice and, in so doing, elevated the practice of bankruptcy law to the large law firm environment as a profitable and mainstream practice group of most major U.S. law firms. Throughout his career, he played a key role in the most significant, notable and complex bankruptcies and restructurings in history, including Lehman Brothers, General Motors, American Airlines, R.H. Macy, Texaco, WorldCom and Enron. He also played a key role in managing Weil. Mr. Miller, along with three other partners, managed the Firm up until it elected its first Executive Partner in 1989, and his leadership and vision significantly impacted Weil's evolution from a small, two-office law firm to one of the world's major full-service firms. Described by colleagues as a gifted teacher as well as practitioner, Mr. Miller spent significant time teaching at a number of institutions, including Columbia University Law School, Yale Law School and New York University School of Law. He trained and mentored a number of future leaders of the restructuring bar, and championed young talent. He was the consummate practitioner, colleague and friend to so many. Mr. Miller was a member of the National Bankruptcy Conference, a fellow of the American College of Bankruptcy, a fellow of the American Bar Foundation, and a Trustee of the Committee on Economic Development. Mr. Miller loved the opera, and he was a long-time Advisory Director for The Metropolitan Opera. Mr. Miller's vast contributions to the law and the community will live on through the many people he impacted throughout his life and career. He will be missed greatly by his many colleagues and friends at Weil and beyond. Mr. Miller was a beloved and devoted husband. He is survived by his wife, Ruth. In honor of Mr. Miller, Weil has established the Harvey R. Miller Lecture Series at Columbia Law School. To make a gift, please make your check payable to Columbia Law School and indicate The Harvey R. Miller Lecture Series Fund.

2015-05-01T00:00:00Z,"SHEPARD--Thomas R.,Jr. May 1, 2015--Thomas Rockwell Shepard, Jr., former publisher of Look magazine; legendary advertising sales executive, World War II veteran; and author of four books, the last of which he published at age 95, died April 29 of pneumonia at Sarasota Memorial Hospital. He was 96 years old. At a career crossroads after almost five years of U.S. Navy service in the Western Pacific theatre, Mr. Shepard considered both Harvard Business School and Look magazine's training program. Mike Cowles, the founder and publisher of Look, convinced him that he would get a better business education by joining Look. Assigned first to the magazine's Cleveland office, Mr. Shepard launched a 26-year career that included stops in Boston and Los Angeles before he landed in New York in 1949. He rose from salesman to advertising sales manager to director of advertising before being named Look's publisher in 1965. In the mid-1960's, Look, which showcased photographs in its feature pages, passed its rival Life in circulation, reaching 8.5 million. However, television's inroads into the advertising sales that were Look's principal source of revenue prompted a financial crisis at the magazine. Look ceased publishing in 1971. Life folded a few months later, ending the era of the mass market photography feature magazine. When Look shut its doors, Mr. Shepard made sure everyone on his sales team had new employment, and then joined the Institute of Outdoor Advertising as president, a job he held until 1976. During that time, Outdoor Advertising quadrupled in revenue, and he was elected to the Outdoor Advertising Hall of Fame. Mr. Shepard was born in 1918 at Lying-In Hospital in New York City, the son of Thomas Rockwell Shepard and Marie Maze Dickinson Shepard. He grew up in East Orange, N.J., during the Great Depression and graduated from East Orange High School, where he was president of his senior class. In 1940, he graduated from Amherst College, which he attended on scholarship and where he waited tables for spending money. After graduation, Mr. Shepard, who wanted to get married but knew jobs were scarce, applied for what he believed was the best opportunity for a successful future in business--the very competitive Vick School of Applied Merchandising in New York, an executive marketing training program created by the Vick Chemical Company. He was one of just three graduates in 1941, by then having been a traveling salesman of Vick's Vapo-Rub to smalltown country stores. Recounting the experience in letters to his fiancee, Nancy Kruidenier, he described Texas as being filled with ""bogs, bugs, mules, wild dogs, [and] the ever present danger of rattlers and bulls."" He married Nancy Kruidenier of Des Moines, Iowa in September of that year. The day after the attack on Pearl Harbor three months later, Mr. Shepard went to New York's Navy headquarters and volunteered to serve. Based on his experience with small boats, he was commissioned as an ensign and eventually assigned to Destroyer Escort 419, the USS Robert F. Keller, as gunnery officer. He was involved in six major campaigns in the western Pacific in 1944 and 1945, including Iwo Jima and Okinawa. He also endured two typhoons at sea, including three grueling days of conning the ship safely through ""Halsey's Typhoon,"" which sank three U.S. destroyers. At the end of his service, he was the Keller's executive officer and held the rank of lieutenant commander. Following his career in advertising and publishing, Mr. Shepard spent the next three decades of his life traveling the world extensively with his beloved wife, Nancy. He remained deeply involved with Amherst College and his Amherst classmates throughout his life, raising funds for the college in every capacity. In 1990, he received Amherst's Medal For Eminent Service. He was president of the Class of 1940 for the past 20 years, frequently encouraging--or admonishing--his classmates to ""stay vertical."" He enjoyed writing: his final book of four, Making the Sale: The Art of Salesmanship, was published last year. Mr. Shepard was passionate about national politics and international news his entire life and prided himself on his tenacity to stay informed. Rare was the day that he didn't devour The New York Times, listen to broadcast news, and become engaged in serious conversation with friends and family about national and international issues. In the early 1990's, Mr. Shepard chaired George H.W. Bush's presidential campaign in Connecticut. A staunch, lifelong devotion to the Republican Party ended a decade later when Mr. Shepard began to prefer more moderate Democratic candidates. A longtime resident of Greenwich, Conn., Mr. Shepard was deeply involved in the community, holding multiple civic leadership positions. He was a member of the Round Hill and Belle Haven Clubs. He also had a home in Sarasota, where he was a member of the Bird Key Yacht Club. Mr. Shepard is survived by his wife, Nancy; three daughters, Sue Shepard Jaques of Lambertville, NJ, and her husband Pete Jaques, Molly Dickinson Shepard of Philadelphia and her husband Peter Dean, and Amy Shepard Knight of Chevy Chase, Md., and her husband Edward Knight; a son, Thomas R. (Rocky) Shepard III of Rye, NY and his wife Peggy O'Neal Shepard; nine grandchildren and twelve great grandchildren. Funeral services will be private. 1/3"
2015-05-01T00:00:00Z,"MILLER--Harvey R. It is with great sadness that we announce the passing of Harvey Miller after a courageous battle with ALS. He was 82 years old. Mr. Miller was born in 1933. He earned his Bachelor of Arts degree at Brooklyn College in 1954 and graduated from Columbia Law School in 1959. He joined Weil, Gotshal & Manges LLP in 1969 as the Firm's 14th partner and was an integral member of the Firm for the majority of his long and distinguished career. From September 2002 to March 2007, he was a Managing Director and Vice Chairman of the independent investment bank Greenhill & Co. Mr. Miller created Weil's bankruptcy practice and, in so doing, elevated the practice of bankruptcy law to the large law firm environment as a profitable and mainstream practice group of most major U.S. law firms. Throughout his career, he played a key role in the most significant, notable and complex bankruptcies and restructurings in history, including Lehman Brothers, General Motors, American Airlines, R.H. Macy, Texaco, WorldCom and Enron. He also played a key role in managing Weil. Mr. Miller, along with three other partners, managed the Firm up until it elected its first Executive Partner in 1989, and his leadership and vision significantly impacted Weil's evolution from a small, two-office law firm to one of the world's major full-service firms. Described by colleagues as a gifted teacher as well as practitioner, Mr. Miller spent significant time teaching at a number of institutions, including Columbia University Law School, Yale Law School and New York University School of Law. He trained and mentored a number of future leaders of the restructuring bar, and championed young talent. He was the consummate practitioner, colleague and friend to so many. Mr. Miller was a member of the National Bankruptcy Conference, a fellow of the American College of Bankruptcy, a fellow of the American Bar Foundation, and a Trustee of the Committee on Economic Development. Mr. Miller loved the opera, and he was a long-time Advisory Director for The Metropolitan Opera. Mr. Miller's vast contributions to the law and the community will live on through the many people he impacted throughout his life and career. He will be missed greatly by his many colleagues and friends at Weil and beyond. Mr. Miller was a beloved and devoted husband. He is survived by his wife, Ruth. In honor of Mr. Miller, Weil has established the Harvey R. Miller Lecture Series at Columbia Law School. To make a gift, please make your check payable to Columbia Law School and indicate The Harvey R. Miller Lecture Series Fund.

He earned his Bachelor of Arts degree at Brooklyn College in 1954 and graduated from Columbia Law School in 1959. He joined Weil, Gotshal & Manges LLP in 1969 as the Firm's 14th partner and was an integral member of the Firm for the majority of his long and distinguished career. From September 2002 to March 2007, he was a Managing Director and Vice Chairman of the independent investment bank Greenhill & Co. Mr. Miller created Weil's bankruptcy practice and, in so doing, elevated the practice of bankruptcy law to the large law firm environment as a profitable and mainstream practice group of most major U.S. law firms. Throughout his career, he played a key role in the most significant, notable and complex bankruptcies and restructurings in history, including Lehman Brothers, General Motors, American Airlines, R.H. Macy, Texaco, WorldCom and Enron. He also played a key role in managing Weil. Mr. Miller, along with three other partners, managed the Firm up until it elected its first Executive Partner in 1989, and his leadership and vision significantly impacted Weil's evolution from a small, two-office law firm to one of the world's major full-service firms. Described by colleagues as a gifted teacher as well as practitioner, Mr. Miller spent significant time teaching at a number of institutions, including Columbia University Law School, Yale Law School and New York University School of Law. He trained and mentored a number of future leaders of the restructuring bar, and championed young talent. He was the consummate practitioner, colleague and friend to so many. Mr. Miller was a member of the National Bankruptcy Conference, a fellow of the American College of Bankruptcy, a fellow of the American Bar Foundation, and a Trustee of the Committee on Economic Development. Mr. Miller loved the opera, and he was a long-time Advisory Director for The Metropolitan Opera. Mr. Miller's vast contributions to the law and the community will live on through the many people he impacted throughout his life and career. He will be missed greatly by his many colleagues and friends at Weil and beyond. Mr. Miller was a beloved and devoted husband. He is survived by his wife, Ruth. In honor of Mr. Miller, Weil has established the Harvey R. Miller Lecture Series at Columbia Law School. To make a gift, please make your check payable to Columbia Law School and indicate The Harvey R. Miller Lecture Series Fund.

Throughout his career, he played a key role in the most significant, notable and complex bankruptcies and restructurings in history, including Lehman Brothers, General Motors, American Airlines, R.H. Macy, Texaco, WorldCom and Enron. He also played a key role in managing Weil. Mr. Miller, along with three other partners, managed the Firm up until it elected its first Executive Partner in 1989, and his leadership and vision significantly impacted Weil's evolution from a small, two-office law firm to one of the world's major full-service firms. Described by colleagues as a gifted teacher as well as practitioner, Mr. Miller spent significant time teaching at a number of institutions, including Columbia University Law School, Yale Law School and New York University School of Law. He trained and mentored a number of future leaders of the restructuring bar, and championed young talent. He was the consummate practitioner, colleague and friend to so many. Mr. Miller was a member of the National Bankruptcy Conference, a fellow of the American College of Bankruptcy, a fellow of the American Bar Foundation, and a Trustee of the Committee on Economic Development. Mr. Miller loved the opera, and he was a long-time Advisory Director for The Metropolitan Opera.

We would like to celebrate the life of William Sokolin, leading New York City wine merchant, who passed away peacefully in his home on Tuesday, April 28th, 2015, surrounded by family. Loving husband to Gloria Sokolin, father to Deanne and David Sokolin, father-in-law to Glenn Goldstein and devoted grandfather to Jeremy and Lilly Goldstein. As a young man, Bill attended Horace Mann in Riverdale and Tufts University where he excelled in sports. He said that a big moment in his life happened when he signed with Branch Rickey of the Brooklyn Dodgers and saw images of Hank Greenberg dancing around him. As a patriot, Bill left the Dodgers for the US Army during the Korean War. When he returned from serving his country, he went directly into the family's liquor business, which his father opened on Madison Avenue in 1934, immediately after Prohibition ended. Bill discovered his passion for wine long before it had been mainstreamed in America, and he innovatively changed the focus of the store from liquor to wine by 1959. A pioneering force in the fine and rare wine business, Bill was considered one of the leading experts on the subject of wine and wine investing. He was a published author of ""Liquid Assets"" and ""The Complete Wine Investor"" and essentially invented the concept of fine wine investment in the Bordeaux market in the mid-1960s. Bill was known not only for his vast wine knowledge, but also for his charm, leaving customers with wonderful and memorable shopping experiences. Bill was once famously quoted as saying: ""What is the definition of a good wine? It should start and end with a smile."" Bill was a true original as anyone who knew him can attest to. He will be greatly missed, but the memories with him leave us smiling."

Born in Bronx, NY on November 13, 1924, LeRoy was the son of Aaron and Dorothy Rubin and brother to Justine Auerbach, who predeceased him. He was married for 63 years to Barbara Eydenberg Rubin who survives him. They have three children-Jim Rubin (Faye Weitzman), Jane Hoffman (Coley) and Patty Sacks (Douglas), 11 grandchildren (Alexis (Evan), Zac, Josh, Danny, Sophie, Hillary, Tim, Chris, Olivia, Elizabeth and Haley), one great-grandchild (Myles), one nephew and three nieces. Lee was the founder and owner of LeeBar Management Company. Leebar owns and manages a variety of residential, commercial, and industrial properties both in and around New York and in other parts of the country. Lee converted numerous prewar apartment buildings on the upper westside into cooperatives, and loved to tell stories of his great bargaining accomplishments with the tenants groups in these buildings. Lee loved the business and remained until his death a very savvy bargain seeker and indefatigable deal hunter. He was an active board member of the Paul Taylor Dance Company and the President's Council at Weill Cornell Hospital. Lee was a long standing member and director of the Lotos Club. A hearty club participant, he served on the finance and arts committee. He was often found at state dinners, reading plays, and engaging with great interest in history book groups. Lee was known for a quick wit and irreverent sense of humor that often entertained and sometimes offended. He was an elegant man, a dapper dresser and loved conversation. Leroy graduated from Dewitt Clinton High School and the University of Pennsylvania. His college years were interrupted by his service in the US Army as a member of the 103rd Infantry Division in World War II. After basic training he was deployed to France but was soon captured by the Germans. He spent months in a POW camp in the Czech Republic. His wartime experiences - which influenced much of his adult life - were documented both by the Shoah foundation and the book, No Hero, No Coward, by George Davis. Above all, Lee cherished time with family, his adored wife, and their active life in the community of Stamford, Connecticut where he sat on school and museum boards. His quiet time was spent in the out of doors, on the ski slopes of Vermont, Colorado and Europe, fox hunting and horseback riding in Upper Westchester and with a great book. Lee remained to the end a patriarch and embracer of family time. He was an impulsive and persistent telephoner of his three children, their spouses and the 11 grandchildren. Lee, Dad, Grandpa, Great-gramps, Uncle Lee will be sorely missed but will live on in the family members he touched and deeply influenced. Rest well, Le Roi- our king! Our hearts are broken. The family will receive guests Monday and Tuesday from 4-8pm at 35 Sutton Place #"

Born in Bronx, NY on November 13, 1924, LeRoy was the son of Aaron and Dorothy Rubin and brother to Justine Auerbach, who predeceased him. He was married for 63 years to Barbara Eydenberg Rubin who survives him. They have three children-Jim Rubin (Faye Weitzman), Jane Hoffman (Coley) and Patty Sacks (Douglas), 11 grandchildren (Alexis (Evan), Zac, Josh, Danny, Sophie, Hillary, Tim, Chris, Olivia, Elizabeth and Haley), one great-grandchild (Myles), one nephew and three nieces. Lee was the founder and owner of LeeBar Management Company. Leebar owns and manages a variety of residential, commercial, and industrial properties both in and around New York and in other parts of the country. Lee converted numerous prewar apartment buildings on the upper westside into cooperatives, and loved to tell stories of his great bargaining accomplishments with the tenants groups in these buildings. Lee loved the business and remained until his death a very savvy bargain seeker and indefatigable deal hunter. He was an active board member of the Paul Taylor Dance Company and the President's Council at Weill Cornell Hospital. Lee was a long standing member and director of the Lotos Club. A hearty club participant, he served on the finance and arts committee. He was often found at state dinners, reading plays, and engaging with great interest in history book groups. Lee was known for a quick wit and irreverent sense of humor that often entertained and sometimes offended. He was an elegant man, a dapper dresser and loved conversation. Leroy graduated from Dewitt Clinton High School and the University of Pennsylvania. His college years were interrupted by his service in the US Army as a member of the 103rd Infantry Division in World War II. After basic training he was deployed to France but was soon captured by the Germans. He spent months in a POW camp in the Czech Republic. His wartime experiences - which influenced much of his adult life - were documented both by the Shoah foundation and the book, No Hero, No Coward, by George Davis. Above all, Lee cherished time with family, his adored wife, and their active life in the community of Stamford, Connecticut where he sat on school and museum boards. His quiet time was spent in the out of doors, on the ski slopes of Vermont, Colorado and Europe, fox hunting and horseback riding in Upper Westchester and with a great book. Lee remained to the end a patriarch and embracer of family time. He was an impulsive and persistent telephoner of his three children, their spouses and the 11 grandchildren. Lee, Dad, Grandpa, Great-gramps, Uncle Lee will be sorely missed but will live on in the family members he touched and deeply influenced. Rest well, Le Roi- our king! Our hearts are broken.

After graduating from City College he volunteered as a paratrooper in World War II, launching what would be an illustrious 30-year military career. At the time of his 1968 retirement from the U.S. Army, he was among the most decorated combat veterans of his time, with honors from heroic actions and serious wounds in three wars: WWII, Korea and Vietnam. He was awarded the Distinguished Service Cross, three Silver Stars, four Bronze Stars, five Purple Hearts, the Legion of Merit, two Joint Commendation Medals and two Air Medals. His 70-year marriage to Ruth Engelman, of the Bronx, began before he departed for battle in the Philippines. There he took part in the audacious airborne raid of Los Banos in 1945, rescuing more than 2,000 U.S. and Allied civilians from a Japanese prison camp. Col. Garten's feats of bravery in the Korean War garnered recommendations for the Congressional Medal of Honor. He was gravely wounded in Vietnam, but even after losing a leg he requested and received assignment as post commander at Fort Bragg. Having earned a master's degree in International Relations from George Washington University, he became a professor of history and political science at the University of Tampa in 1970. He and Ruth, who died in 2013, moved to Oregon in 2001 to be near their grandchildren.

Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center mourns with great sorrow the untimely death of our esteemed colleague Alan Hall, Chair of the Sloan Kettering Institute's Cell Biology Program. A brilliant and gifted scientist, Dr. Hall joined MSK in 2004 to lead that program. During an extraordinary career, he made fundamental contributions to our understanding of how the cellular cytoskeleton is organized and regulated.

But it was in his daily life at MSK that Dr. Hall shined the brightest. He was a devoted teacher and mentor, a generous and good-humored colleague, and a remarkable human being.

2015-05-10T00:00:00Z,"GERTLER--Menard M.,physician, researcher, and professor of cardiology died on 6 May 2015 at the age of 95 years old. He was two weeks and one day short of his 96th birthday. Dr. Gertler had a distinguished career in medicine that spanned seven decades and which put him at the forefront of medical discovery and education. While a student at the Faculty of Medicine at McGill University in the 1940s, Menard Gertler worked with two legendary doctors, Wilder Penfield and Francis McNaughton, with whom he assisted in the construction of a plastic model of the human brain. During a second period of study at McGill, Dr. Gertler joined pioneering surgeon, Arthur Vineberg, to develop a major technique of heart surgery that is still used today. In the 1950s, Dr. Gertler worked with Paul Dudley White at Harvard and Massachusetts General Hospital, a collaboration which resulted in the publication of the monograph, Coronary Heart Disease in Young Adults: A Multi-Disciplinary Study, which was cited in the early 2000's by the New England Journal of Medicine as one of the landmark publications in the field of cardiology of the past fifty years. Inspired by the work of Nobel-Prize winning biochemist Severo Ochoa also during the 1950s, Dr. Gertler went on to do his own research on congestive heart failure which led to the introduction of the drug Inocor as a treatment. Dr. Gertler and Dr. White collaborated on yet another book on cardiology which was followed by Gertler's book entitled You Can Predict Your Heart Attack and Prevent It, published by Random House in 1961. While Dr. White wrote the forward, Dr. Gertler credited his wife, Anna Paull Gertler, for translating the entire manuscript from medical into lay terms for the general public. In addition, Dr. Gertler wrote articles in many medical publications and lectured in more than fifteen countries. Considered one of the giants in his field, he has taught medicine at McGill, Harvard, NYU, Columbia and Cornell Universities. When Dr. Gertler retired from Weill Cornell, the college bestowed on him the title of Professor Emeritus. Born in Saskatoon, Saskatchuwan, the oldest of five children, he finished his undergraduate work at the University of Saskatchuwan before entering McGill Medical School. He met his wife, Anna Paull Gertler, in Montreal while acting as the resident doctor in an ambulance. When his future mother-in-law fell in the snowy streets of Montreal and broke her leg, he met his wife. Together they had three children during a marriage that lasted for sixty-five years until his wife's death in 2009. Dr. Gertler is survived by his daughter, Barbara Victor, her husband, Edward Lebar, and a son, Jonathan Paull Gertler. Another daughter, Stephanie Gertler Schiffer died in 2015. Also surviving are seven grandchildren, and three great-grandchildren. A memorial will be held at Weill Cornell Medical College toward the end of May followed by a reception at the Griffiths Faculty Club. Information about the Memorial will be announced by e-mail throughout the Medical College and through his daughter, Barbara Victor. Instead of flowers, donations in memory of Dr. Menard Gertler may be designated to Weill Cornell College for the Hajjar Laboratory, %Weill Cornell Medical College, Office of External Affairs, 1300 York Avenue, Box 314, New York, New York 10065. 1/3"

2015-05-10T00:00:00Z,"MARCUS--Aaron Jacob. A loving husband and father, an impassioned scientific mind and mentor, Dr. Aaron J. Marcus died peacefully in his sleep on May 6. He spent his entire professional career pursuing the secrets of blood. This was a long pursuit, which began with the publication of his first paper in 1958 and was still going on just a few weeks ago. Despite his pure passion for science, he was no less enamored of the opera, Thomas Mann, fountain pens, fine leather shoes, audio equipment, photography, the Beatles, chocolate, and the Chrysler Building. There was always an omnivorous, endearingly daffy curiosity in play, and an eagerness to share his enthusiasms. He was born in Brooklyn in 1925 and educated at the University of Virginia and New York Medical College. He spent more than fifty years at the Veterans Administration Harbor Healthcare System, dedicating himself to experimentation in a narrow, instrument-crammed lab. One colleague called the place ""his secret garden of science""--and the harvest went on for decades, abetted by a productive association with Weill Cornell Medical College, where he was a Professor of Medicine. He was the kindest, funniest, and quirkiest of human beings, and will be missed forever by those who loved him. He is survived by his wife, Deana; his sister, Evelyn; his children, Lisa, James, and Douglas, and their spouses, Lee and Nina; his grandchildren, Nathaniel, Chiara, Shanti, Jamila, and Ishai; and the very wide circle of people whose lives he touched."

2015-05-10T00:00:00Z,"LEWIS--Margaret (M.E.H. Lewis), award-winning playwright and author, died on March 21 in Bradenton, Florida. She was 50. Lewis produced plays in Chicago and in the national theater scene. Her first staged play, Charms for Protection, won the Julie Harris Award, the first of numerous honors Lewis would receive in her career. Since then, Lewis created more than a dozen works that garnered critical acclaim and earned her grants from the Illinois Arts Council, residencies at the Ragdale Foundation, and a Tremain Grant. Her first production in Chicago, Stage Left's production of Burying the Bones, was nominated for three Joseph Jefferson awards, including Best New Work. Burying the Bones is perhaps Lewis's best-known work. It has been staged across the country, most recently finishing successful and sold-out runs in both Buffalo and Detroit. Lewis's work addressed issues of social justice and reflected on the ways the past haunts and informs the present. Burying the Bones deals with the ramifications of apartheid and a woman's personal journey to find her presumed-dead husband. 2010's Here Where It's Safe tells the story of an Indian woman carrying a child for a barren American couple. Fellow Travelers, which won the Jeff Award for Best New Work in 2006, centers around the friendship between two young artists in 1930s Berlin. In each of these works, Lewis humanized events that were distant from her own life and helped localize global and historic struggles. Lewis's work was seen at theaters in New York, Los Angeles, Melbourne, Detroit, Milwaukee, and Stockholm, but her heart and soul were given to the Chicago theater community. In addition to writing, Lewis devoted her life to education. She taught young playwrights in schools across Chicago, working most recently with Chicago Dramatists. She also believed passionately in helping out others in the theater world and was a member of both the Dramatists Guild and the Women's Theatre Alliance. Her final script, 180 Degree Rule, co-authored with Barbara Lhota, will be produced in Chicago by Babes with Blades in the spring of 2016. Lewis was preceded in death by her mother, Rosemarie Lewis, and her brother, Tom Lewis. She is survived by her father, John Lewis, her nephew, Marcus Lewis, her niece, Jaina Shaw, and dozens of beloved and close friends throughout the world. An open house memorial service will be held for her on Sunday, May 17 from 6:30pm-10:00pm at the Chicago Dramatists located at 1105 W. Chicago Avenue, Chicago, Illinois 60642 (also visit their website at www.chicago dramatists.org) The family requested donations be made in Lewis's name to Doctors Without Borders, Heifer International, or the M.E.H.

2015-05-15T00:00:00Z,"GRIFFITH--Dr. Derrick. The friends and colleagues of Derrick Griffith in the Office of the Senior University Dean for Academic Affairs at The City University of New York are devastated by the news of his death in the AMTRAK train derailment. We had the privilege of working with Derrick from 2003 to 2010. He is justifiably best known for his work in founding and inspiring CUNY Prep, a program that enabled thousands of out-of-school youth to earn high school equivalency diplomas and enter college during his tenure as principal. But, from the day he began, his intellectual and practical influence was evident in our work far beyond CUNY Prep's walls. For example, in 2008 Derrick was a key member of the University Committee charged with planning the Guttman Community College. His approach to work with young people was unique. It often appeared that he knew what they were thinking before they knew it themselves. When he spoke to them, they listened; when he challenged them, they responded; and, perhaps most important, when he believed in them, they came to believe in themselves. His ability to communicate and connect with young people who had far too often been told they would never be successful encouraged all of us to think deeply about our own work with youth. He had much the same effect on his colleagues as he had with students--we listened, we responded and we believed. He was a willing and provocative advice- giver. His convictions were deeply held and he seldom hesitated to speak his mind. His death has deprived the people of the city of the brilliance, the passion and the talent of an outstanding educator and one of its finest residents. We will miss him. Our thoughts are with his mother, Carlea Griffith, and son, Darryus Griffith, as they confront their loss.

He was 87. Bernard Pollara was born on July 28, 1927 in Chicago, IL to Sicilian immigrants Giuseppe and Dominica Pollara. He served as a Hospital Corpman in the United States Navy from 1945 to 1946. Under the G.I. Bill, he earned a BS in Chemistry from Northwestern University (1951) and an MS in Chemistry from the University of Illinois (1954). He went on to receive an MD (1960) and a PhD in Biochemistry (1963) from the University of Minnesota, where he did his Pediatric Residency and Immunology Fellowship. In 1969, he moved with his family to Albany, NY to head up the New York State Health Department's Kidney Disease Institute while also teaching pediatrics at Albany Medical College. In 1979, he became Chairman of the Department of Pediatrics at Albany Med, where he remained until 1994. He moved to Tampa, FL to become the John E. and Aliese Price Professor of General Pediatrics and Adolescent Medicine at the University of South Florida (USF) College of Medicine where he served as Division Chief, Medical Director, and Interim Chair, retiring reluctantly in 2010 when his health began to fail.

He was a gourmet chef who loved traveling the world, fly-fishing, betting on football games, and eating pie. He loved spending time with his family and was thrilled to see his grandchildren thrive. He will be dearly missed.

2015-05-17T00:00:00Z,"THOMAS--David Gilbert, Researcher, Scientist, Executive, Volunteer, Loving Father, Litchfield. Research scientist and Executive Director at Bell Laboratories for 38 years, died on Saturday, May 9 at the Charlotte Hungerford Hospital in Torrington, Ct. He was 86 years old. Mr. Thomas was born on August 4, 1928 in London, England, and was the son of Alan Thomas and Elsa (Auger) Thomas. He married in 1957 and was the beloved husband of June M. Thomas. His United States citizenship was granted in 1960. The educational years of his youth were spent at Harrow School, in England, and at The Putney School in Vermont. He received his BA, MA and PhD in Chemistry from Oxford University where he finished his educational studies in 1952. Afterwards, he worked as a researcher for the Royal Military College in Kingston, Canada. While at a musical concert in New Jersey, Mr. Thomas met a scientist who told him about a place called ""Bell Laboratories."" He was intrigued and began working there in 1954. Once employed, his scientific mind flourished, and for the next 38 years he worked to create technological advancements that have affected our telecommunication abilities to this day. The first research he did at Bell Labs led him to the solid- state chemistry of semiconducting materials. Later, he directed his research toward the optical properties of semiconductors, including their luminescence. After becoming Head of the Semiconductor Electronics Research Department in 1962, Mr. Thomas conducted studies leading to the development of gallium phosphide light-emitting diodes, which were used extensively as indicator lights of maintenance equipment, control panels, and some new multiline telephones and business telephone consoles. A practical application at the time was the ""Princess"" phone which lit up with a green glow when lifted from its handset. In 1969, Mr. Thomas moved from research into development and became the Executive Director of the Electronic Devices, Process and Materials Division responsible for the development of electronic devices, including their materials and fabrication. During this same year, he was a co- recipient, along with John Hopfield, of the Oliver E. Buckley Solid State Physics Prize of the American Physical Society for his theoretical and experimental work related to the interaction of light and solids. Mr. Thomas was also the holder of seven patents, one of which was awarded to him and his colleague Willard S. Boyle. This patent helped lead to the development of the semiconductor injection laser, which is found in many electronic appliances. In 1976, Mr. Thomas became Executive Director of Bell Laboratories' Transmission Systems Division. His chief activity here was to oversee the development and design of a variety of transmission systems, and to assist in their introduction into manufacture. These systems included digital fiber optic systems for terrestrial use, and also submarine fiber optic systems for transoceanic use. The 1988 submarine fiber optic system that Mr. Thomas worked on was designed to increase phone transmissions from the United States, England and France to 40,000 simultaneous phone calls. One of the challenges that arose were sharks who, sensing the magnetic field created by the cable's high voltage, bit them. Thicker cable were subsequently designed to help with this problem. Mr. Thomas continued to work at Bell Laboratories until 1992. He and June then moved to Dallas, Texas where he briefly worked for a small electronics company and, in 1994, he began his retirement. Not one prone to idleness, he embraced the computer age with zeal by building his own and by using his skills to help organizations computerize their data records. These organizations included the Dallas District Attorney's office Division of Family Violence and, after moving to Litchfield, Ct., in 2002, the Town of Litchfield's Assessor's Office, the Litchfield Historical Society, the Greenwood Counseling Center, the Warner Theater, and the Susan B. Anthony Project. He also made annual treks to Avon, Ct. where he would help people to file their tax returns. Mr. Thomas was an avid reader and could be politically vocal about supporting liberal policies. He very much enjoyed the beauty and solitude of the nearby White Memorial Woods. Mr. Thomas was predeceased by his loving wife, June, in January of this year. He is survived by his beloved children Virginia S. Thomas of New York, New York and Victoria C. Thomas of New Canaan, Ct., as well as, granddaughters Eliza K. Lupone and Madeline J. Lupone. His brother, Gerry Thomas, resides in London, England. In lieu of flowers, the family asks that donations be made to Charlotte Hungerford Hospital in memory of David G. Thomas, c/o Development Office, 540 Litchfield St., Torrington, Ct. 06790.

Matt and his wife Martha were residents of Westport, CT and wintered at his beloved Ocean Reef Club in Key Largo, FL. No one who knew Matt will ever forget him. He was a complicated and unique man, who approached everything he did with limitless energy and enthusiasm. He was a truly loveable curmudgeon. In 1960, after graduating from St. Lawrence University, Matt married his first wife Sharon Briggs, fathered two sons Briggs and Peter, moved to Connecticut and joined his father's company Precision Gear Inc.; then located in Corona, Queens. PGI is now a seventy six year old aerospace manufacturing company that makes parts for both the commercial and defense aerospace markets. Matt was a sportsman. He loved both freshwater and saltwater fishing, hunting waterfowl on the Long Island Sound and upland birds in New Brunswick, camping by a stream, car racing and playing golf with friends and family. For many summers Matt spent July and much of August fly fishing in Montana, Idaho and Wyoming. With his friend Bob D'Ambruoso he co-owned ""Headwaters Angling,"" a fly fishing and guide shop in Ennis, MT. Another Forelli entrepreneurial venture was a popular steakhouse/bar in Darien, CT called ""Lock Stock & Barrel."" Of all Matthew's good qualities, and he had many, the most important was his unquestioned generosity. Matt supported innumerable charities. To name just a few: Bonefish & Tarpon Trust, AmeriCares, Brigham & Women's Hospital, Kids in Crisis, the Ocean Reef Foundation, and his alma mater St. Lawrence University; where there is a Forelli Family Scholarship. Matt's generosity also extended to his friends. He had a host of them and he was always there for them. Whatever they needed - money, advice, a place to stay, a shoulder to cry on.

2015-05-17T00:00:00Z,"d'AYMERY--Gilles. Gilles d'Aymery, 64, died peacefully on May 9 at his home in San Francisco after a lengthy illness. Aymery was born in France and educated at the Universities of Economics & Law of Toulouse and Paris, and at the Institut d'Etudes Politiques de Paris. He began his career in the international oil and gas industry, moved to the U.S. in 1982 where he eventually became a computer consultant to small businesses, and in 1996 he changed course to pursue his true passion: writing, launching the Web magazine Swans Commentary, where he was publisher, co- editor, essayist, and political commentator. Aymery was a long-time advocate of policies that promote cooperation, equal allocation and sharing of created wealth entailing redistribution of revenues, collective decision-making on the control of resources, and underconsumptionism to mitigate growing human-made ecological mayhem. As a contrarian by nature and a secular humanist by affinity, he was never a member of or affiliated with a political party, and never embraced any ideological chapel. His socioeconomic stance landed him in the socialist libertarian corner, and he was profoundly antiwar. His work included endless correspondence with the political and literary hodgepodge, assiduous reading, and researching that resulted in over 400 essays and articles that can be read at http://www.swans.com/library/archives.html. Swans condemned the commercialization of the Web and refused advertising, instead relying on the contribution of readers to support publishing costs. Aymery is survived by his wife, Jan Baughman, their beloved pets, and her family; mother Anne and brothers Patrick and Marc-Antoine of France and their families; and numerous friends, writers, and readers who will miss his brilliant mind, irreverent humor, revealing insights, sharp analysis, and willingness to challenge conventional wisdom, while promoting poetry, music, arts, and culture. Private remembrances will be held in the U.S. and France. In lieu of flowers, please make a contribution to the American Civil Liberties Union. 1/3"

2015-05-17T00:00:00Z,"MATTESON--William Bleecker. 1928-2015. Everything in our father's life was carefully planned: right down to the way he died. We were assembled at West Point Military Academy for our uncle's interment on May 8th, 2015. The weather was beautiful, the church service was profound, and the soldiers were impressive and with their rifles and flag-folding and their gratitude for our uncle's service to our country. It was all very moving and maybe a bit too much for our aging father. He enjoyed a lively dinner with us, then stayed up exchanging animated stories with his sister about their childhood. When he went to bed on Friday, he had a smile on his face. Sadly, he never woke up. William Bleecker Matteson was born in 1928 and grew up in Mount Vernon, NY. He graduated from The Peddie School in 1946 and Yale University in 1950, and married Marilee Brill three months later. It was the beginning of a lifelong love story. He graduated from Harvard Law School as a member of the Harvard Law Review in 1953 and for the next two years, he clerked for The Honorable Augustus N. Hand in the Federal Court of Appeals in the Second Circuit in New York City and Justice Harold H. Burton in the United States Supreme Court. He joined the Debevoise law firm in 1955 and became a partner in 1961. He headed the Paris office of Debevoise from 1973 to 1976. He was presiding partner of the firm from 1988 to 1993. What was so great about Bill? Unlike a lot of powerful business executives today, he knew how to balance his career and his family life. He raised us in New York City so he could eat breakfast and dinner with us and still put in a full day at the office. He didn't want to waste time commuting out to the suburbs like his father did. His friendships were deep and often with other ""giants"" in the law profession. After our mother was in a devastating car accident in 1968, he promised that if she recovered fully from her countless fractures, they would live life to its fullest. In 1973, we moved to Paris, where we spent three unforgettable years. Bill was one of the leading corporate lawyers of his generation. He handled a lot of high-profile, interesting cases. He used to say that each one felt like a whole new job and he was always excited to tackle it. In 1979, he got a call while we were on vacation: Chrysler was about to go bankrupt, and could he become their lead attorney in the first bailout during the time of the Loan Guarantee Act in 1980. Lee Iacocca was so impressed with Bill's work that he asked him to join the Statue of Liberty-Ellis Island Foundation, a private-sector effort to raise funds for the restoration and preservation of the Statue of Liberty and Ellis Island. Bill had three daughters who grew up in the 1970s, and he began to understand the importance of women in the workplace. He was known to mentor young female lawyers at his law firm. One of his mantras was ""make your clients your friends and your friends your clients."" He was a consummate client developer who worked to understand the people he represented and their businesses. He also lectured at Columbia Law School from 1971 to 1980, except for the years we lived in Paris. He truly believed in the law and we never saw him do anything dishonest, except when he pretended he didn't speak French to get out of a traffic ticket in Paris. Over the years, Bill was active in the International Bar Association and the Bar Association of New York. He served on several boards, including the French-American Foundation, The Hartford Foundation, The Salk Institute, The Board of Foreign Parishes, The Sconset Trust, The New York Institute for Special Education, The Peddie School, Miss Porter's School and Kalamazoo College. A particular interest of his was the U.S. Council for International Business (USCIB), where he served as a Vice Chairman from 1986 to 1999, focusing on key issues of world trade, finance and investments as the U.S. representative on the Business and Industry Advisory Committee to the Organization for Economic Cooperation in Paris (BIAC). We recently received an email from an old friend: ""I heard about your Dad, but have no idea what to say. I planned for Bill to live forever."" So did we. But in his own special way, his exit was as dignified as his life and career had been. To have spent his last day at his sister's side with the amazingly beautiful backdrop of West Point in spring, it might've just been his plan. Bill Matteson is survived by his wife of almost 65 years: Marilee; his sister: Anne Sisson; his three daughters and their spouses: Lynn Matteson and John Hoops, Sandra and Perry Helm, Holly and Marshall Pagon; and three grandchildren: William Matteson, and Willow and Samuel Pagon. In lieu of flowers: please send donations in his name to the Sconset Trust, PO Box 821, Siasconset, MA 02564 for conservation efforts on Nantucket Island, ""his emotional home."" A service is planned there later this summer. 1/3"

He was a complicated and unique man, who approached everything he did with limitless energy and enthusiasm. He was a truly loveable curmudgeon. In 1960, after graduating from St. Lawrence University, Matt married his first wife Sharon Briggs, fathered two sons Briggs and Peter, moved to Connecticut and joined his father's company Precision Gear Inc.; then located in Corona, Queens. PGI is now a seventy six year old aerospace manufacturing company that makes parts for both the commercial and defense aerospace markets. Matt was a sportsman. He loved both freshwater and saltwater fishing, hunting waterfowl on the Long Island Sound and upland birds in New Brunswick, camping by a stream, car racing and playing golf with friends and family. For many summers Matt spent July and much of August fly fishing in Montana, Idaho and Wyoming. With his friend Bob D'Ambruoso he co-owned ""Headwaters Angling,"" a fly fishing and guide shop in Ennis, MT. Another Forelli entrepreneurial venture was a popular steakhouse/bar in Darien, CT called ""Lock Stock & Barrel."" Of all Matthew's good qualities, and he had many, the most important was his unquestioned generosity. Matt supported innumerable charities. To name just a few: Bonefish & Tarpon Trust, AmeriCares, Brigham & Women's Hospital, Kids in Crisis, the Ocean Reef Foundation, and his alma mater St. Lawrence University; where there is a Forelli Family Scholarship. Matt's generosity also extended to his friends. He had a host of them and he was always there for them. Whatever they needed - money, advice, a place to stay, a shoulder to cry on. In addition to his wife Martha, Matt is survived by his sister Margaret Urciuoli; brother Billy; son Briggs and wife Jennifer, their children Matthew and Meg; son Peter and wife Michaela, their boys Briggs, Beau and Brodie; his former wife Sharon; Martha's two daughters Brook Lewis and Diana Cuyler and her four grandchildren Hannah, Harper, Lily and Elias. 1/3"

William Samuel ""Billy"" Calabretta, left his earthly body behind on Saturday, May 16, 2015, and entered his eternal home, a place that is peaceful and free from the pain and suffering he endured during the last months of his earthly existence. Billy lived a big life, being born to parents late in life who adored their only son, and older sisters who surrounded him with love. His personality, good looks and intellect carried him far in life. Billy lived life his way, all the time, even in his last years when confronted with trial and tribulation. Billy struck out to make his own life at the tender age of 19, after the death of his father. He made his own way in life, finding a place to live near the ocean that he loved. Billy put himself through school and had a goal for his future; a goal that he fully achieved. Billy built his business empire ""brick by brick"" and attained all that he desired in life. Billy was a shrewd businessman and built his business on the premise of a strong will and hard work. In the end, his strength and will sustained him when doctors and nurses questioned his ability to maintain life through such a debilitating illness. Billy was a Financial Planning Specialist and Managing Director, Wealth Management of Morgan Stanley Financial Group in Boca Raton, Florida. He has been honored in the financial world many times, most recently in Forbes Magazine maintaining his high business standards, knowledge and expertise even through the worst of times. It was this work that Billy thrived on and he was regarded in high esteem by his clients and colleagues alike for his business expertise both nationally and internationally in the financial world. Billy lived a full and blessed life with his beautiful and loving wife, Jocelyn Canning Calabretta, who cared for him to the very end. Jocelyn's love for her husband was beautiful to behold and a blessing to him during the dark days of his illness. Jocelyn lived true to her vow ""in sickness and in health"" and cared and nurtured Billy through the worst of times. Billy's family was devoted to him from his first cry to his last breath. Billy was a life force that drew people to him and he enjoyed the friendship of many. Son, brother, husband, nephew, uncle, Godfather, friend? Billy was and will always be surrounded by love. Billy leaves behind to love him and honor his memory, his wife Jocelyn Canning Calabretta, sister and brother-in-law, Deborah and Randy Renner of Delray Beach, Florida, sister and brother-in-law Connie and Kevin Brogan, of St. Simons Island, Georgia, nephews, Jeff Oliverio of Hollywood, Florida and Gabe Oliverio of Delray Beach, Florida, niece and husband, Jessica Windon Callaghan and Nick Callaghan of St. Augustine, Florida, three great nephews, Jackson and Liam Callaghan and Michael Oliverio and many loving cousins in West Virginia, Maryland, Ohio and North Carolina. Italian family ties run true and deep and Billy will always be remembered with love and smiles to all those who knew him and had the exceptional opportunity to be part of his life. Billy was preceded in death by his father, William Samuel Calabretta and his mother, Rose Oliverio Calabretta. Billy loved his mother dearly and cared for her diligently upon the death of his father many years ago. He was the very best son any mother could have wanted. Bill and Rose celebrate with Billy now, their much beloved son, and happiness and joy abounds in heaven. A Memorial Celebration will be held on Thursday, May 21, 2015, at Seagate Beach Club, A1A Delray Beach, from 6:00pm until 9:00pm. Acknowledgements to Billy's life will begin at 7:15.

2015-05-20T00:00:00Z,"BLITZER--Susan. Susan Blitzer, 67, of Princeton, New Jersey and Portsmouth, Rhode Island passed away on May 11, 2015. She is survived by her loving husband and children, Michael, Marin, and David, and her two wonderful dogs, Higgins and Watson. Susan was originally from Framingham, Massachusetts and began her career in the retail industry. She started working as a salesperson at Jordan Marsh in Boston. After graduating from Russel Sage College in New York, she moved to New Jersey and worked in the old Princeton Bamberger's store. She then traveled the world as a handbag and jewelry buyer for Bamberger's (now known as Macy's). It was at Bamberger's that she met Michael, and they were married in 1978. But most of all, Susan will be remembered for her philanthropic work, as she was well-known for her successful fundraisers. When designing these charity events, she brought great vigor and creativity, and her style and taste made her fundraisers nights to remember. She devoted her energies to two causes in particular. First, she was a passionate believer in private school education and sent both of her children to Princeton Day School. For many years, she chaired the school's auction committee, where her auctions raised hundreds of thousands for the school's teacher development fund. Then, after her children's graduation, she focused on another cause dear to her heart - animal rescue shelters. She served for several years on the board of SAVE Animal Rescue, an animal shelter in Princeton, and helped run their annual gala. Over the years, she and Michael supported a number of causes, particularly SAVE, Boston Preparatory Charter Public School (the school where her son, David, teaches), and the Home for Little Wanderers (the charity her daughter, Marin, has supported for the last 10 years through her fundraising efforts). To her family, she will be remembered as an avid reader and a crossword zealot. She loved flowers, plants, and herbs. She took great pride in her amazing cooking.

Loving husband of Joan, brother of Paula Oreck, father of Susan (Jonathan Bram) and Elizabeth (Andrew Cohen) and adoring grandfather of Nathan, Lily, Henry, Julia and Jenny. Arthur was a proud 1949 graduate of The Fieldston School, was surely its longest serving trustee, and maintained cherished lifelong friendships with many of his classmates. Both of his daughters and all five grandchildren continued his legacy there. He graduated from Johns Hopkins University in 1953, where he was a long serving trustee and permanent class president. As was his way, he made many wonderful friends at Hopkins, through whom he ultimately met his bride, Joannie Goldberg of Charleston, SC, a Goucher graduate. From 1954-57, he served in the United States Army Security Agency in Tokyo and was awarded the Commendation Ribbon for Meritorious Achievement. Arthur was the president of Bruno Appliance Corporation, a distribution business started by his father, Irving, which was for many years the country's largest distributor of RCA and Whirlpool appliances. Arthur was a trustee of Beth Israel Medical Center and Continuum Health Partners for many decades. Arthur loved tradition and often joked that he was never one for change, choosing to spend 80 of his 84 years in the same Central Park West apartment. He was president of the Kenilworth's co-op board for many years. Throughout his illness, the dinners he shared with a group of special neighbors were true highlights. Arthur was the youngest child in a large extended family and his pride in his uncle General David Sarnoff's accomplishments was well known. He was thrilled to preside over the enormous and wonderful Sarnoff family Thanksgiving at his home in Yorktown Heights for many years. Arthur also truly embraced Joan's colorful southern family and was in turn embraced by the Dumas clan. In 1978 the couple purchased a home on South Carolina's Sullivan's Island and spent happy summers on the beach surrounded by multiple generations. The annual Shabbat dinners they hosted there were loud and delicious and are cherished memories of their loving extended family. Family legend maintains that Arthur was the first season ticket holder at the new Madison Square Garden, cheering the Knicks to their two championships with an enthusiasm he would later bring to his grandchildren's endless parade of sports games, concerts and the Fieldston fashion show. Arthur was kind and generous to so many people who passed through his life, maintaining meaningful relationships with classmates, neighbors, distant cousins, old army buddies and many of his children's friends and classmates. He was truly loved and he will be missed. Services will be held at 10:30am this Friday at Congregation Rodeph Sholom, 7 West 83rd St. In lieu of flowers, contributions can be made to the Arthur Sarnoff Alumni Scholarship Fund at Ethical Culture Fieldston School, attn Whitney Pollack wpollack@ecfs.org 212-712-6242. 1/3"

He died of a brain aneurysm on May 20, 2015 surrounded by his family. Bigger than life fit Rick. His treasured pack of friends tell unbelievable, but true stories. Backcountry skiing, single-track biking, ice climbing, mountaineering: Rick knew what he loved and he did it, even during his illness. Rick adored his wife, Jodie, and his children, Samantha, Sophie and Jackson. His family was the center of his life. Jodie was his favorite companion and constant support, and especially during the difficult last years of his life. He was fiercely proud of his kids' many accomplishments. Rick had a very successful Rockefeller Center practice as a board-certified prosthodontist since 1990. His empathy, uncompromising ethics, quality of treatment and his brutal honesty brought him a steady influx of patients, and imbued his professional relationships with the warmth of personal ones. From Methuen, MA, Rick stayed close to his extended family all his life. He was devoted to his mother, Gloria, and checked in daily with his brother, Rob. He established and maintained deep connections with people. He had numerous life-long friends and formed strong attachments with his professional colleagues and his patients. We all loved him back. He could be opinionated, stubborn and demanding. But he came from his heart, and from his intense commitment to what he believed was right. He engaged all who knew him more fully with life because he engaged so fully with it. Our lives are richer as a result.

2015-05-22T00:00:00Z,"ROCKEFELLER-- Margaretta ""Happy"" Our beloved Mother, Margaretta ""Happy"" Fitler Rockefeller, peacefully passed away in her sleep on the morning of Tuesday, May 19. Her children and many loved ones gathered around her in loving memory. We are blessed that up until her death, she was happily active and engaged with her family, beloved friends and interests. Throughout her life, our Mother was a constant inspiration and source of profound love and wisdom for her family and friends. Our Mother cared deeply about her family, friends, and the well being of others. During World War II, she served in the American Women's Volunteer Service and also served as a nurse's aide in the Philadelphia Naval Hospital assisting the wounded. She had a keen interest in understanding and spending time with different peoples and cultures. She worked quietly to promote mutual understanding and had an uncanny ability to generate understanding and respect among people of different backgrounds and views. As First Lady of New York and Second Lady of the United States and as a concerned and interested citizen, she visited all parts of the globe. She was appointed to two terms as a public delegate to the United Nations by President George H. W. Bush in 1991 and 1992, serving under US Ambassador Thomas Pickering. After her service, she continued to advance her country's interests there and host important gatherings. She had a deep love of learning and read throughout her life historical novels and history. She was proud of how her heritage and her family had helped America over the years. Her great-great- grandfather, General George Meade, was Commander of the Union Army at the Battle of Gettysburg. She was the great granddaughter of Edwin H. Fitler, former Mayor of Philadelphia. And she was also descended from Jonathan Dickenson, the founder of Princeton University, and Joseph Harrison, who built the railroads in Russia under Tsar Nicholas II. As a breast cancer survivor enduring two mastectomies shortly after her husband Nelson Rockefeller became Vice President of the United States, she played an important role, along with First Lady Betty Ford, in helping people gain a greater awareness of breast cancer and its detection. Her charitable interests included heartfelt support for the Philadelphia Orchestra and its annual visits to China and the orchestra's mission of promoting international understanding. She supported the Franklin D. Roosevelt Four Freedoms Park in New York City, the Central Park Conservancy, the Rockefeller State Park Preserve, and served on the Board of Historic Hudson Valley and as a Trustee of the Rockefeller Brothers Fund. She served as Chairman of the Board of the Saratoga Performing Arts Center (SPAC) from its formation in 1966 until 1973 and was named as Honorary Chairperson for SPAC's 50th Anniversary Celebration in 2016. As a Mother she guided us with her steadfast love and thoughtful insights and understanding of people and the world. She taught us the value and importance of friends and family and country. She shared with us her deep love of nature from which she drew strength and spirituality. She delighted in feeding birds and wildlife near her home. For over thirty five years she was a dedicated swimmer nearly every day. She deeply enjoyed taking long walks with loved ones as often as she could. Mom was a kind and giving woman, who left us with loving memories that will remain forever. Our Mother, above all, was dedicated to her immediate and extended family and to many dear friends. She greatly loved spending time with her children, including Malinda Menotti who passed away in 2005, and fourteen grandchildren. She had a firm belief in the importance of family and the nurturing, support, and perspective it provides. On Tuesday, June 9 there will be a private funeral with family and close friends. In September there will be a Memorial Celebration of her life. We greatly miss her and we will always be guided by her wisdom and love. The Children of Mrs. Nelson A. ""Happy"" Rockefeller; James B. Murphy, Wendy M. Bickford, Carol M. Lyden, Nelson A. Rockefeller, Jr., Mark F. Rockefeller. 1"
2015-05-22T00:00:00Z,"SARNOFF--Arthur I.,84, died peacefully at home on May 20, surrounded by family. Loving husband of Joan, brother of Paula Oreck, father of Susan (Jonathan Bram) and Elizabeth (Andrew Cohen) and adoring grandfather of Nathan, Lily, Henry, Julia and Jenny. Arthur was a proud 1949 graduate of The Fieldston School, was surely its longest serving trustee, and maintained cherished lifelong friendships with many of his classmates. Both of his daughters and all five grandchildren continued his legacy there. He graduated from Johns Hopkins University in 1953, where he was a long serving trustee and permanent class president. As was his way, he made many wonderful friends at Hopkins, through whom he ultimately met his bride, Joannie Goldberg of Charleston, SC, a Goucher graduate. From 1954-57, he served in the United States Army Security Agency in Tokyo and was awarded the Commendation Ribbon for Meritorious Achievement. Arthur was the president of Bruno Appliance Corporation, a distribution business started by his father, Irving, which was for many years the country's largest distributor of RCA and Whirlpool appliances. Arthur was a trustee of Beth Israel Medical Center and Continuum Health Partners for many decades. Arthur loved tradition and often joked that he was never one for change, choosing to spend 80 of his 84 years in the same Central Park West apartment. He was president of the Kenilworth's co-op board for many years. Throughout his illness, the dinners he shared with a group of special neighbors were true highlights. Arthur was the youngest child in a large extended family and his pride in his uncle General David Sarnoff's accomplishments was well known. He was thrilled to preside over the enormous and wonderful Sarnoff family Thanksgiving at his home in Yorktown Heights for many years. Arthur also truly embraced Joan's colorful southern family and was in turn embraced by the Dumas clan. In 1978 the couple purchased a home on South Carolina's Sullivan's Island and spent happy summers on the beach surrounded by multiple generations. The annual Shabbat dinners they hosted there were loud and delicious and are cherished memories of their loving extended family. Family legend maintains that Arthur was the first season ticket holder at the new Madison Square Garden, cheering the Knicks to their two championships with an enthusiasm he would later bring to his grandchildren's endless parade of sports games, concerts and the Fieldston fashion show. Arthur was kind and generous to so many people who passed through his life, maintaining meaningful relationships with classmates, neighbors, distant cousins, old army buddies and many of his children's friends and classmates. He was truly loved and he will be missed. Services will be held at 10:30am this Friday at Congregation Rodeph Sholom, 7 West 83rd St. In lieu of flowers, contributions can be made to the Arthur Sarnoff Alumni Scholarship Fund at Ethical Culture Fieldston School, attn Whitney Pollack wpollack@ecfs.org 212-712-6242. 1/3"

She attended the University of Delaware and worked as a real estate agent for Brown Harris Stevens in New York before devoting herself to her family. She was a quick-witted puzzle and game lover, an antiques aficionado, a movie buff, and an avid knitter who was the consummate hostess and life of the party. She was elegant and creative, always served the best hors d'oeuvres, delivered the snappiest one-liners and never skipped dessert. She died on May 17th from heart failure surrounded by her loved ones.

He died of a brain aneurysm on May 20, 2015 surrounded by his family. Bigger than life fit Rick. His treasured pack of friends tell unbelievable, but true stories. Backcountry skiing, single-track biking, ice climbing, mountaineering: Rick knew what he loved and he did it, even during his illness. Rick adored his wife, Jodie, and his children, Samantha, Sophie and Jackson. His family was the center of his life. Jodie was his favorite companion and constant support, and especially during the difficult last years of his life. He was fiercely proud of his kids' many accomplishments. Rick had a very successful Rockefeller Center practice as a board-certified prosthodontist since 1990. His empathy, uncompromising ethics, quality of treatment and his brutal honesty brought him a steady influx of patients, and imbued his professional relationships with the warmth of personal ones. From Methuen, MA, Rick stayed close to his extended family all his life. He was devoted to his mother, Gloria, and checked in daily with his brother, Rob. He established and maintained deep connections with people. He had numerous life-long friends and formed strong attachments with his professional colleagues and his patients. We all loved him back. He could be opinionated, stubborn and demanding. But he came from his heart, and from his intense commitment to what he believed was right. He engaged all who knew him more fully with life because he engaged so fully with it. Our lives are richer as a result. Services will be held on Saturday, May 23, 2015 at 2 pm at All Saints Episcopal Church, Scarborough Road, Briarcliff Manor. Please make a memorial donation to the Mount Washington Observatory instead of flowers."

2015-05-23T00:00:00Z,"ROCKEFELLER-- Margaretta ""Happy"" Our beloved Mother, Margaretta ""Happy"" Fitler Rockefeller, peacefully passed away in her sleep on the morning of Tuesday, May 19. Her children and many loved ones gathered around her in loving memory. We are blessed that up until her death, she was happily active and engaged with her family, beloved friends and interests. Throughout her life, our Mother was a constant inspiration and source of profound love and wisdom for her family and friends. Our Mother cared deeply about her family, friends, and the well being of others. During World War II, she served in the American Women's Volunteer Service and also served as a nurse's aide in the Philadelphia Naval Hospital assisting the wounded. She had a keen interest in understanding and spending time with different peoples and cultures. She worked quietly to promote mutual understanding and had an uncanny ability to generate understanding and respect among people of different backgrounds and views. As First Lady of New York and Second Lady of the United States and as a concerned and interested citizen, she visited all parts of the globe. She was appointed to two terms as a public delegate to the United Nations by President George H. W. Bush in 1991 and 1992, serving under US Ambassador Thomas Pickering. After her service, she continued to advance her country's interests there and host important gatherings. She had a deep love of learning and read throughout her life historical novels and history. She was proud of how her heritage and her family had helped America over the years. Her great-great- grandfather, General George Meade, was Commander of the Union Army at the Battle of Gettysburg. She was the great granddaughter of Edwin H. Fitler, former Mayor of Philadelphia. And she was also descended from Jonathan Dickenson, the founder of Princeton University, and Joseph Harrison, who built the railroads in Russia under Tsar Nicholas II. As a breast cancer survivor enduring two mastectomies shortly after her husband Nelson Rockefeller became Vice President of the United States, she played an important role, along with First Lady Betty Ford, in helping people gain a greater awareness of breast cancer and its detection. Her charitable interests included heartfelt support for the Philadelphia Orchestra and its annual visits to China and the orchestra's mission of promoting international understanding. She supported the Franklin D. Roosevelt Four Freedoms Park in New York City, the Central Park Conservancy, the Rockefeller State Park Preserve, and served on the Board of Historic Hudson Valley and as a Trustee of the Rockefeller Brothers Fund. She served as Chairman of the Board of the Saratoga Performing Arts Center (SPAC) from its formation in 1966 until 1973 and was named as Honorary Chairperson for SPAC's 50th Anniversary Celebration in 2016. As a Mother she guided us with her steadfast love and thoughtful insights and understanding of people and the world. She taught us the value and importance of friends and family and country. She shared with us her deep love of nature from which she drew strength and spirituality. She delighted in feeding birds and wildlife near her home. For over thirty five years she was a dedicated swimmer nearly every day. She deeply enjoyed taking long walks with loved ones as often as she could. Mom was a kind and giving woman, who left us with loving memories that will remain forever. Our Mother, above all, was dedicated to her immediate and extended family and to many dear friends. She greatly loved spending time with her children, including Malinda Menotti who passed away in 2005, and fourteen grandchildren. She had a firm belief in the importance of family and the nurturing, support, and perspective it provides. On Tuesday, June 9 there will be a private funeral with family and close friends. In September there will be a Memorial Celebration of her life. We greatly miss her and we will always be guided by her wisdom and love. The Children of Mrs. Nelson A. ""Happy"" Rockefeller; James B. Murphy, Wendy M. Bickford, Carol M. Lyden, Nelson A. Rockefeller, Jr., Mark F. Rockefeller. 1"

2015-05-24T00:00:00Z,"JACKREL--Rebecca Robin 43, passed away on Sunday, May 3rd two years after being diagnosed with incurable cancer. After a long winding path - starting with a Masters in music education in New York, to working at a solder manufacturing company in Texas, to providing Quality Assurance at a software company in Silicon Valley, to practicing as a Veterinary Technician at pet hospitals in San Francisco - Rebecca finally found her passion as a wildlife photographer. In the short time she had to practice her art, Rebecca journeyed to all seven continents. With her focus on conservation, she highlighted the dangers of the Pacific Garbage Patch to her beloved albatross, the great toll climate change has inflicted on polar bears, the horrible boat wounds suffered by manatees and more. She also captured the beauty of the natural world, from penguins warming their eggs in Antarctica, to a humpback whale relaxing with her calf in the Dominican Republic, to a polar bear swimming through a glowing twilight near the North Pole. Her crowning achievement was the Ethiopian Wolf Project, a program she created to raise awareness for the critically endangered Ethiopian Wolf. In 2011, after spending five weeks in the highlands of Ethiopia accompanied by fellow wildlife photographer Will Burrard- Lucas, Rebecca produced ""The Ethiopian Wolf: Hope at the Edge of Extinction"", the definitive book on this unique creature and its struggle for survival. Rebecca's work can be seen at her website: http://www. rebeccajackrel.com/, or through her stock agencies: Alamy, Getty, AGE Fotostock, Danita Delimont and PhotoShelter. More of her work, insights into her process and her chronicle of living with cancer can be found at her blog: http://rebecca jackrel.blogspot.com/. Rebecca's photographs will be featured in the upcoming book ""When Mountain Lions are Neighbors: Wildlife in Today's California"", by Beth Pratt-Bergstrom, to be published in early 2016 by Heyday Books. Rebecca's art, her dedication to conservation, and the grace and strength with which she faced her final years are an inspiration to us all.

2015-05-24T00:00:00Z,"CULLMAN--Nan Ogburn. Nan Cullman, singer and explorer, died following a stroke on Monday, May 18, at her home in Pittsboro, North Carolina. She was 85. Born in Smithfield, North Carolina in 1929, Nan began a singing career at the age of 15 when she won a scholarship in a statewide competition to attend the Julliard School in New York. She also studied at Columbia University and the University of Heidelberg in Germany. She performed throughout her life with regional opera companies and choral societies. Her favorite role was Fiordiligi from Mozart's Cosi fan tutte that she performed for the Westchester Opera Company. In 1951, she married Hugh Cullman, son of Broadway 'angel' and Port Authority Chairman, Howard S. Cullman, and made her home in Westchester County, New York for the next 40 years. She was active with civic organizations, serving on the board of Youth Consultation Service of New York, the vestry of Christ's Church, Rye and as a volunteer working in the recovery room at United Hospital in Port Chester, New York. She was also a long-term board member of the North Carolina Symphony. In her 40s, Mrs. Cullman took up mountain- eering and other extreme travel pursuits, riding camels with the Tuareg tribe through the Hoggar Mountains of southern Algeria, climbing to the Everest base camps from both the Nepalese and Tibetan sides and obtaining one of the first visas to hike through Bhutan. She almost lost her life on Everest, when she was blinded and at the summit of Mount Kilimanjaro where she was overcome by altitude sickness. According to her daughter, Alexandra Haslingden, ""Long before Sheryl Sandberg challenged women to lean in, my mother was jumping in."" As recently as 2013, she was hiking in the Dolomites and this year was planning an expedition to the Highlands of Scotland. Mrs. Cullman is survived by her husband Hugh Cullman as well as her three children, Katherine Hedges of London, England, Hugh Cullman Jr. of Rye, New York, and Alexandra Haslingden of Sydney, Australia, and nine grandchildren. A memorial service will be held at St. Paul's Church in Beaufort, NC on Wednesday, May 27 at 11:00am.

2015-05-24T00:00:00Z,"SARNOFF--Arthur I.,84, died peacefully at home on May 20, surrounded by family. Loving husband of Joan, brother of Paula Oreck, father of Susan (Jonathan Bram) and Elizabeth (Andrew Cohen) and adoring grandfather of Nathan, Lily, Henry, Julia and Jenny. Arthur was a proud 1949 graduate of The Fieldston School, was surely its longest serving trustee, and maintained cherished lifelong friendships with many of his classmates. Both of his daughters and all five grandchildren continued his legacy there. He graduated from Johns Hopkins University in 1953, where he was a long serving trustee and permanent class president. As was his way, he made many wonderful friends at Hopkins, through whom he ultimately met his bride, Joannie Goldberg of Charleston, SC, a Goucher graduate. From 1954-57, he served in the United States Army Security Agency in Tokyo and was awarded the Commendation Ribbon for Meritorious Achievement. Arthur was the president of Bruno Appliance Corporation, a distribution business started by his father, Irving, which was for many years the country's largest distributor of RCA and Whirlpool appliances. Arthur was a trustee of Beth Israel Medical Center and Continuum Health Partners for many decades. Arthur loved tradition and often joked that he was never one for change, choosing to spend 80 of his 84 years in the same Central Park West apartment. He was president of the Kenilworth's co-op board for many years. Throughout his illness, the dinners he shared with a group of special neighbors were true highlights. Arthur was the youngest child in a large extended family and his pride in his uncle General David Sarnoff's accomplishments was well known. He was thrilled to preside over the enormous and wonderful Sarnoff family Thanksgiving at his home in Yorktown Heights for many years. Arthur also truly embraced Joan's colorful southern family and was in turn embraced by the Dumas clan. In 1978 the couple purchased a home on South Carolina's Sullivan's Island and spent happy summers on the beach surrounded by multiple generations. The annual Shabbat dinners they hosted there were loud and delicious and are cherished memories of their loving extended family. Family legend maintains that Arthur was the first season ticket holder at the new Madison Square Garden, cheering the Knicks to their two championships with an enthusiasm he would later bring to his grandchildren's endless parade of sports games, concerts and the Fieldston fashion show. Arthur was kind and generous to so many people who passed through his life, maintaining meaningful relationships with classmates, neighbors, distant cousins, old army buddies and many of his children's friends and classmates. He was truly loved and he will be missed.

Her children and many loved ones gathered around her in loving memory. We are blessed that up until her death, she was happily active and engaged with her family, beloved friends and interests. Throughout her life, our Mother was a constant inspiration and source of profound love and wisdom for her family and friends. Our Mother cared deeply about her family, friends, and the well being of others. During World War II, she served in the American Women's Volunteer Service and also served as a nurse's aide in the Philadelphia Naval Hospital assisting the wounded. She had a keen interest in understanding and spending time with different peoples and cultures. She worked quietly to promote mutual understanding and had an uncanny ability to generate understanding and respect among people of different backgrounds and views. As First Lady of New York and Second Lady of the United States and as a concerned and interested citizen, she visited all parts of the globe. She was appointed to two terms as a public delegate to the United Nations by President George H. W. Bush in 1991 and 1992, serving under US Ambassador Thomas Pickering. After her service, she continued to advance her country's interests there and host important gatherings. She had a deep love of learning and read throughout her life historical novels and history. She was proud of how her heritage and her family had helped America over the years. Her great-great- grandfather, General George Meade, was Commander of the Union Army at the Battle of Gettysburg. She was the great granddaughter of Edwin H. Fitler, former Mayor of Philadelphia. And she was also descended from Jonathan Dickenson, the founder of Princeton University, and Joseph Harrison, who built the railroads in Russia under Tsar Nicholas II. As a breast cancer survivor enduring two mastectomies shortly after her husband Nelson Rockefeller became Vice President of the United States, she played an important role, along with First Lady Betty Ford, in helping people gain a greater awareness of breast cancer and its detection. Her charitable interests included heartfelt support for the Philadelphia Orchestra and its annual visits to China and the orchestra's mission of promoting international understanding. She supported the Franklin D. Roosevelt Four Freedoms Park in New York City, the Central Park Conservancy, the Rockefeller State Park Preserve, and served on the Board of Historic Hudson Valley and as a Trustee of the Rockefeller Brothers Fund. She served as Chairman of the Board of the Saratoga Performing Arts Center (SPAC) from its formation in 1966 until 1973 and was named as Honorary Chairperson for SPAC's 50th Anniversary Celebration in 2016. As a Mother she guided us with her steadfast love and thoughtful insights and understanding of people and the world. She taught us the value and importance of friends and family and country. She shared with us her deep love of nature from which she drew strength and spirituality. She delighted in feeding birds and wildlife near her home. For over thirty five years she was a dedicated swimmer nearly every day. She deeply enjoyed taking long walks with loved ones as often as she could. Mom was a kind and giving woman, who left us with loving memories that will remain forever. Our Mother, above all, was dedicated to her immediate and extended family and to many dear friends. She greatly loved spending time with her children, including Malinda Menotti who passed away in 2005, and fourteen grandchildren. She had a firm belief in the importance of family and the nurturing, support, and perspective it provides. On Tuesday, June 9 there will be a private funeral with family and close friends. In September there will be a Memorial Celebration of her life. We greatly miss her and we will always be guided by her wisdom and love. The Children of Mrs. Nelson A. ""Happy"" Rockefeller; James B.

2015-05-24T00:00:00Z,"TORSON--John. John Archie Torson, private art dealer and resident of New York City for more than 60 years, died Thursday evening, May 14, 2015, from an accident while still in good health, which is what he had always hoped, and not far from the apartment he called home for most of his life. Just short of 90 years of age, John remained active and engaging. He was looking forward with great anticipation to the soon arrival of his family for what he said would be our last get- together. So although his family grieves that he is gone, we take solace that he died while in a happy state and still out and about in the city he so loved. He has been a loyal and contented resident of Manhattan and thought it, indeed, knew it to be the greatest city in the world. John was born in Independence, Wisconsin in 1926. He grew up in this small, rural farming village with his parents and sister. Independence always held a cherished place in his heart, but in his senior year of high school, he was called into the US Navy during war times. After serving until 1947, he then attended the University of Minnesota where he studied art and architecture. Graduating in 1952, he began work in Minneapolis at the Dayton Company. In 1954, he moved to New York City. Once there he was first associated with the Wayah Gallery on 4th Avenue. Encouraged by Mr. Wayah and with the confidence and the initial financial backing of his parents, John ventured out into what would become his profession and went to Europe in 1956 for his first art buying trip. His chosen profession proved ideal for his temperament and critical eye. He never stopped working, loving art, and enjoying people from all over the world who shared his enthusiasm for the arts and the artist behind the creative enterprise. John was a world traveller and always keenly aware of his surroundings and the beauty that a discerning eye could discover. He became schooled in art, music, and architecture without ever losing his love and passion for these artistic forms. He was well known and respected by his peers and clients within the art community. He also supported many fine museums, galleries, and institutions of art and music, especially those in his beloved city, notably The Metropolitan Museum of Art, The Museum of Modern Art, The Morgan Library, The Frick, The Mannes School of Music, and The Julliard School of Music. We know there are many more that should be mentioned. He had friends from all over the world, and all who knew him would agree that our world has lost a very keen eye and provocative mind. John had the unique proclivity of becoming important to the many people whose lives he touched. Primarily because he sought to appreciate each persons's individuality, while at the same time probing to understand, he became significant to each of us. He guarded zealously his own freedom of mind and because of this, chose to remain somewhat anonymous and always independent. He loved children and treasured the pictures made for him by those of a dear friend when he was in the hospital five years ago recovering from a traumatic brain injury. He wanted to be alive in this world only as long as he remained vital. He was never self indulgent, but he certainly enjoyed good food at the places that he frequented. He was a man of routines. And he had many special friends with whom he engaged regularly for meals and events and social occasions. He was friendly, warm, generous, charming, clever, funny, and witty and became special even to strangers, if given a chance to interact. John had to be shared among many people, but he didn't mind. Smile. One friend once said of him, he makes more use of New York City for what it has to offer in the arts than any other person I know. That could also be said of his ability to challenge each of us to see differently and think more deeply. Being a successful art dealer, he also contributed to the financial success of others. But more than anything, he wanted each of us to enter into the visual world he experienced. The art world has lost a great ally, and we have lost a good friend. He will be missed. He is survived by his beloved sister, Patricia (Boyd), and her children whom he adopted as his own -- his nieces, Carol and Cathy, and his nephews, William and Matthew. John opened his home to his extended family and never tired of showing them New York's greatness, as well as its not so easily discovered treasures. We were all blessed to have known him. Family and close friends will gather to celebrate his life in the city he cherished and then return his ashes to Wisconsin to be buried beside his father Archie and his mother Caroline. In lieu of flowers, he can be remembered by a gift in his name to the Metropolitan Museum of Art. 1/3"

She left this world as she came into it... with extraordinary beauty, grace and dignity. To all who were fortunate to know her, she was her own person - loving, determined, strong, independent, generous, courageous, kind and fiercely loyal. Born to Sarah and Ben, the second of three children, she developed a flair for style, from changing the spelling of her name from ""Edith"" to ""Edythe"" at age 7, to becoming a runway model, to bringing new meaning to haute couture and wearing it with style! She was an avid card player and bargain shopper, passionate about theatre, ballet and opera and an enthusiastic world traveler. Always the hostess extraordinaire, she loved entertaining and bringing people together. Her magnetism drew people in and all wanted to be her friend. Friendships were vital to her and friends became members of her family. She was a devoted daughter and granddaughter, an impassioned sibling to her sister, Florence Bauman, and her brother, Morty Grossman, a proud and loving mother and grandmother, and a spirited aunt and cousin. Her femininity and exquisite beauty captivated many men who wanted to marry her, but only three were fortunate enough to call her his wife. Husband of 37 years, Jack Gottlieb remained her greatest love. Celebrating the life of Edythe are daughters Patricia Gardner, Carole Kaplan and Madeline Raffe Robison, stepson Stuart Gottlieb, grandchildren Pamela Goldsmith, Dana George, Stephanie Crispe, Sarah Maisano and Michael Rotolo, great- grandson Raiden Crispe, and numerous nieces, nephews, cousins and friends.

2015-05-25T00:00:00Z,"LEAF--Martin N. A practicing attorney in New York since 1958, Martin N. Leaf died in Manhattan on May 23 after a long illness. In his legal career he created successful joint ventures and business relationships among major companies throughout the world. He managed litigation, handled dispute resolution, conducted complex contract negotiations, and focused on First Amendment and intellectual property rights cases. Leaf obtained his first legal post--a clerkship while still in law school--when the criminal defense lawyer Emile Zola Berman delivered a lecture to 250 law students. When Berman asked if there were any questions, Leaf raised his hand and asked, ""Can I have a job in your office?"" Berman told him to be at his office the next Monday afternoon--and he got the position. His next clerkship led to a position with Fuchsberg & Fuchsberg, with whom he worked for five years, trying dozens of cases in jury trials. At one point, the young lawyer had earned a record of 20-0. In 1963 Leaf formed the firm of Leaf, Kurzman and Deull together with two other attorneys, Robert G. Kurzman and Ellis M. Deull, and practiced with them for sixteen years, after which he joined the litigation department of Morrison Cohen Singer & Weinstein. Notwithstanding his official retirement in 1990, Leaf continued his relationship with several long-time clients and worked every day since then. In his theatrical practice he represented several entertainment figures, including the actors Raul Julia and Anthony Zerbe, the singer John Denver, and the stage designer Chester Weinberg. Along with his interest in humanitarian projects, he worked with The Hunger Project, an international charity to eliminate hunger across the globe, as a United Nations NGO (non- governmental organization). And he has served as litigation counsel for Landmark, an international development and training company. As counsel for Takachiho Koheki in 1970, he negotiated a ground-breaking joint venture with the computer manufacturer Burroughs Corporation (now Unisys), which became a template for U.S.-Japanese business ventures. Leaf was active in his hometown of Hastings-on-Hudson, New York and served as the Village Attorney for fourteen years through successive political administrations, and also served as Special District Attorney for Westchester County. In 1965, along with his wife, Louise Sarkin Leaf, and five other couples, he co- founded Temple Beth Shalom in Hastings, which now has more than 400 members. While representing Lhamo Dondrub, the 14th Dalai Lama, Leaf got the U.S. State Department to reverse its previous ruling and to issue a visa to let the Dalai Lama come to the United States. He helped the Dalai Lama to add two new chapters to the original plate of his early book, My Land and My People. During the administration of President Jimmy Carter, Leaf served as a ""Goodwill Ambassador"" to Denmark through the ""People to People"" program in which U.S. families exchanged visits with their Danish counterparts. Leaf served on the boards of numerous companies, as well as many nonprofit organizations, including the American Arab Council (consisting of retired ambassadors, ministers of state in the Arab world, and other dignitaries); Trail Blazers Camp (camping for inner city children, founded 1887); Windstar (John Denver's nonprofit organization, focused on the environment and sustainability); the Buckminster Fuller Institute, the National Black Theater; Pro Musicis, a 50-year-old organization supporting musical talent in young people and in residents of institutions where great music is not available (such as prisons, mental health facilities, hospitals, and drug rehabilitation centers); and Echo Hills Mental Health Clinic (a facility for Westchester residents). As a delegate for five years to the NGO Branch of the United Nations, he submitted a White Paper on World Hunger. Leaf was born in New York City, February 19, 1932. He graduated from Washington University in St. Louis, and received his law degree from The New York University School of Law. He served with distinction in the U.S. Army, attaining the rank of Second Lieutenant. He was married for almost forty years to Louise Sarkin Leaf, an urban planner in New Rochelle, until her death in 1995. His children are Marc Leaf, an attorney in New York; Jenifer Leaf Jaeger, a physician now working for the NYC Department of Health and Mental Hygiene; and Cliff Leaf, an author and magazine editor. He loved his grandchildren (in alphabetical order, Connie, Emma, John, Lauren, Rachel, Sam, Sofia, and William) and greatgrandchildren Hadley, Lulu, and Sophie. He was born ""with a gift of laughter and a sense that the world was mad,"" and died surrounded by those he loved and who loved him most, his children, his ""everything,"" Norma Deull, and their extended families. Funeral services will be held on Wednesday, May 27, 2015, at 10:00am, at Riverside Memorial Chapel, 180 West 76th Street, New York, NY. In lieu of flowers, donations may be made to The Hunger Project or Citymeals-on-Wheels. 1/3"

As wife, partner, best and greatest friend for the past 27 years, she is survived by her husband, Gregory Whyte. She is also survived by her brothers Kevin and Stephen Gropp and their families.

2015-05-26T00:00:00Z,"LEAF--Martin N. A practicing attorney in New York since 1958, Martin N. Leaf died in Manhattan on May 23 after a long illness. In his legal career he created successful joint ventures and business relationships among major companies throughout the world. He managed litigation, handled dispute resolution, conducted complex contract negotiations, and focused on First Amendment and intellectual property rights cases. Leaf obtained his first legal post--a clerkship while still in law school--when the criminal defense lawyer Emile Zola Berman delivered a lecture to 250 law students. When Berman asked if there were any questions, Leaf raised his hand and asked, ""Can I have a job in your office?"" Berman told him to be at his office the next Monday afternoon--and he got the position. His next clerkship led to a position with Fuchsberg & Fuchsberg, with whom he worked for five years, trying dozens of cases in jury trials. At one point, the young lawyer had earned a record of 20-0. In 1963 Leaf formed the firm of Leaf, Kurzman and Deull together with two other attorneys, Robert G. Kurzman and Ellis M. Deull, and practiced with them for sixteen years, after which he joined the litigation department of Morrison Cohen Singer & Weinstein. Notwithstanding his official retirement in 1990, Leaf continued his relationship with several long-time clients and worked every day since then. In his theatrical practice he represented several entertainment figures, including the actors Raul Julia and Anthony Zerbe, the singer John Denver, and the stage designer Chester Weinberg. Along with his interest in humanitarian projects, he worked with The Hunger Project, an international charity to eliminate hunger across the globe, as a United Nations NGO (non- governmental organization). And he has served as litigation counsel for Landmark, an international development and training company. As counsel for Takachiho Koheki in 1970, he negotiated a ground-breaking joint venture with the computer manufacturer Burroughs Corporation (now Unisys), which became a template for U.S.-Japanese business ventures. Leaf was active in his hometown of Hastings-on-Hudson, New York and served as the Village Attorney for fourteen years through successive political administrations, and also served as Special District Attorney for Westchester County. In 1965, along with his wife, Louise Sarkin Leaf, and five other couples, he co- founded Temple Beth Shalom in Hastings, which now has more than 400 members. While representing Lhamo Dondrub, the 14th Dalai Lama, Leaf got the U.S. State Department to reverse its previous ruling and to issue a visa to let the Dalai Lama come to the United States. He helped the Dalai Lama to add two new chapters to the original plate of his early book, My Land and My People. During the administration of President Jimmy Carter, Leaf served as a ""Goodwill Ambassador"" to Denmark through the ""People to People"" program in which U.S. families exchanged visits with their Danish counterparts. Leaf served on the boards of numerous companies, as well as many nonprofit organizations, including the American Arab Council (consisting of retired ambassadors, ministers of state in the Arab world, and other dignitaries); Trail Blazers Camp (camping for inner city children, founded 1887); Windstar (John Denver's nonprofit organization, focused on the environment and sustainability); the Buckminster Fuller Institute, the National Black Theater; Pro Musicis, a 50-year-old organization supporting musical talent in young people and in residents of institutions where great music is not available (such as prisons, mental health facilities, hospitals, and drug rehabilitation centers); and Echo Hills Mental Health Clinic (a facility for Westchester residents). As a delegate for five years to the NGO Branch of the United Nations, he submitted a White Paper on World Hunger. Leaf was born in New York City, February 19, 1932. He graduated from Washington University in St. Louis, and received his law degree from The New York University School of Law. He served with distinction in the U.S. Army, attaining the rank of First Lieutenant. He was married for almost forty years to Louise Sarkin Leaf, an urban planner in New Rochelle, until her death in 1995. His children are Marc Leaf, an attorney in New York; Jenifer Leaf Jaeger, a physician now working for the NYC Department of Health and Mental Hygiene; and Cliff Leaf, an author and magazine editor. He loved his grandchildren (in alphabetical order, Connie, Emma, John, Lauren, Rachel, Sam, Sofia, and William) and greatgrandchildren Hadley, Lulu, and Sophie. He was born ""with a gift of laughter and a sense that the world was mad,"" and died surrounded by those he loved and who loved him most, his children, his ""everything,"" Norma Deull, and their extended families. Funeral services will be held on Wednesday, May 27, 2015, at 10:00am, at Riverside Memorial Chapel, 180 West 76th Street, New York, NY.

2015-05-27T00:00:00Z,"CULLMAN--Nan Ogburn. Nan Cullman, singer and explorer, died following a stroke on Monday, May 18, at her home in Pittsboro, North Carolina. She was 85. Born in Smithfield, North Carolina in 1929, Nan began a singing career at the age of 15 when she won a scholarship in a statewide competition to attend the Julliard School in New York. She also studied at Columbia University and the University of Heidelberg in Germany. She performed throughout her life with regional opera companies and choral societies. Her favorite role was Fiordiligi from Mozart's Cosi fan tutte that she performed for the Westchester Opera Company. In 1951, she married Hugh Cullman, son of Broadway 'angel' and Port Authority Chairman, Howard S. Cullman, and made her home in Westchester County, New York for the next 40 years. She was active with civic organizations, serving on the board of Youth Consultation Service of New York, the vestry of Christ's Church, Rye and as a volunteer working in the recovery room at United Hospital in Port Chester, New York. She was also a long-term board member of the North Carolina Symphony. In her 40s, Mrs. Cullman took up mountain- eering and other extreme travel pursuits, riding camels with the Tuareg tribe through the Hoggar Mountains of southern Algeria, climbing to the Everest base camps from both the Nepalese and Tibetan sides and obtaining one of the first visas to hike through Bhutan. She almost lost her life on Everest, when she was blinded and at the summit of Mount Kilimanjaro where she was overcome by altitude sickness. According to her daughter, Alexandra Haslingden, ""Long before Sheryl Sandberg challenged women to lean in, my mother was jumping in."" As recently as 2013, she was hiking in the Dolomites and this year was planning an expedition to the Highlands of Scotland. Mrs. Cullman is survived by her husband Hugh Cullman as well as her three children, Katherine Hedges of London, England, Hugh Cullman Jr. of Rye, New York, and Alexandra Haslingden of Sydney, Australia, and nine grandchildren. A memorial service will be held at St. Paul's Church in Beaufort, NC on Wednesday, May 27 at 11:00am. In lieu of flowers, contributions can be made to the North Carolina Community Foundation. 919-828-4387. nccommunityfoundation.org 1/3"

2015-05-29T00:00:00Z,"JACKREL--Rebecca Robin 43, passed away on Sunday, May 3rd two years after being diagnosed with incurable cancer. After a long winding path - starting with a Masters in music education in New York, to working at a solder manufacturing company in Texas, to providing Quality Assurance at a software company in Silicon Valley, to practicing as a Veterinary Technician at pet hospitals in San Francisco - Rebecca finally found her passion as a wildlife photographer. In the short time she had to practice her art, Rebecca journeyed to all seven continents. With her focus on conservation, she highlighted the dangers of the Pacific Garbage Patch to her beloved albatross, the great toll climate change has inflicted on polar bears, the horrible boat wounds suffered by manatees and more. She also captured the beauty of the natural world, from penguins warming their eggs in Antarctica, to a humpback whale relaxing with her calf in the Dominican Republic, to a polar bear swimming through a glowing twilight near the North Pole. Her crowning achievement was the Ethiopian Wolf Project, a program she created to raise awareness for the critically endangered Ethiopian Wolf. In 2011, after spending five weeks in the highlands of Ethiopia accompanied by fellow wildlife photographer Will Burrard- Lucas, Rebecca produced ""The Ethiopian Wolf: Hope at the Edge of Extinction"", the definitive book on this unique creature and its struggle for survival. Rebecca's work can be seen at her website: http://www. rebeccajackrel.com/, or through her stock agencies: Alamy, Getty, AGE Fotostock, Danita Delimont and PhotoShelter. More of her work, insights into her process and her chronicle of living with cancer can be found at her blog: http://rebecca jackrel.blogspot.com/. Rebecca's photographs will be featured in the upcoming book ""When Mountain Lions are Neighbors: Wildlife in Today's California"", by Beth Pratt-Bergstrom, to be published in early 2016 by Heyday Books. Rebecca's art, her dedication to conservation, and the grace and strength with which she faced her final years are an inspiration to us all.

2015-05-29T00:00:00Z,"FAMULARO--Joseph John, 92, of West Palm Beach, FL passed away Wednesday, May 27 2015 in Danbury Hospital in Connecticut at midnight. Joe was born May 29, 1922 in New York City to Angela Cerabone and Joseph Anthony Famularo. His long-time friend, Bernard H. Kinzer, predeceased him on July 30, 2012. Joe attended NYC public schools, the University of Kentucky (BA), and Columbia University (MA).

He authored several books on management and, after retirement from the business world, soon became known as a prolific food writer.

The Trustees and staff of The Metropolitan Museum of Art mourn deeply the passing of Parker Gilbert, a devoted leader and friend of the Museum, and one of the most active and influential trustees in its history. He shared his advice and broad expertise over many years as a Trustee (1990-2010), Trustee Emeritus (2010-15), and Vice Chairman of the Board (1999-2010). His involvement also extended to chairing the Met's nominating and investment committees, and serving actively as a member of its executive, compensation, finance, budget, acquisitions, employee benefits, and institutional responsibility committees, as well as the Visiting Committee for the Department of Modern and Contemporary Art. With his wife Gail, he made generous contributions to the Museum, including a landmark gift in 2000 establishing an endowment fund that provides vital support for a range of exhibitions. Parker was a calm, authoritative, and reassuring leader, particularly during times of fiscal strain, and he was always able to look beyond the horizon to define and continue to build a healthier museum. He was a mentor to staff and fellow Trustees, and also contributed generously in the tradition of his family, the Morgans. Always high-minded and determined, while deeply human and philanthropic, he was an extraordinary colleague whom we will miss greatly. We extend our heartfelt condolences to Gail and to the entire family. Daniel Brodsky, Chairman Thomas P. Campbell, Director and CEO Emily K. Rafferty, President Emerita 1"

2015-06-01T00:00:00Z,"TEEMAN--Susan, 71, Wall Street Loses an Executive Recruitment Pioneer. Susan was born on August 14, 1943 in Winnetka, Illinois. She graduated from New Trier High School in Winnetka, IL and Skidmore College in Saratoga Springs, NY. In the 1970's Susan came to New York City where she started her life long career as a renowned financial services executive recruiter in the Human Resources department at Lehman Brothers. After several years as the Head of the department, Susan decided to become an entrepreneur and founded her own executive search firm where she recruited and placed Wall Street professionals around the world. Over the years the firm grew to be one of the most prestigious search firms in New York with hundreds of recruiters under the names: Teeman Perley Gilmartin, Teeman Allison Perley, Teeman Kiniry, Teeman Associates and Smythe Teeman. Susan was well respected in the financial community and was recognized for her dedication, kind heart and generosity. She was a pioneer for women in Wall Street and paved the way for women in an industry where they were scarce. Many of the women she trained went on to be top executives at banks and hedge funds, as well as executive recruitment firms of their own. Susan was also a successful fund raiser for the Special Olympics, inspired by her sister Merry. She is predeceased by her parents, and survived by her beloved sister Merry.

William John White, 84, May 27, 2015, died peacefully at NYU Medical Center Thursday morning following an almost decade long battle with renal failure and bone cancer. He was truly a warrior heading through snowstorms and hurricanes to receive dialysis three times a week for four hours a day at 6:00am. A long fought struggle through pain and great suffering is now at end as he is with God in Heaven. Bill was born on August 2, 1930 to Tom and Elizabeth White in Brooklyn, New York. His mother passed away when he was 10 years old and he and his only sibling Tom Jr. found great sanctuary in their summer home at Point Lookout, New York. Tom went off to World War II becoming a key man on General Patton's team at the wars end. He returned home and after years of Bill selling printing presses to industry decided to join forces with his brother. They build some of the greatest, celebrated and indeed simple New York restaurants. Their three star New York Times Giraffe on East 58th Street featured a 20 foot silver giraffe out front and boasted clientele including Aristotle Onassis and John and Yoko Lennon. Their upper East side Beach Cafe on 70th Street and 2nd Avenue which they held for 37 years still continues at 48 years strong with a former manager Dave Goodside. The Point View Inn in in Point Lookout, now the Fisherman's Catch, was a bowling alley when Bill was young.

Two weeks ago this was celebrated at Le Grainne Cafe where he had his favorite french toast. He and Pat travelled the world excited to explore culture and cuisine.

On his 50th wedding anniversary his Holiness Pope Benedict XVII received him at the Vatican blessed them and His Eminence Edmond Cardinal Czoka, The Vatican's number three remarried them at a private Papal chapel under St. Peter's Basilica adjacent to Pope John Paul II tomb. Bill was educated at All Hallows high school by the Irish Christian Brothers who gave him great character. He graduated from Fordham University with a bachelors degree. He and Patricia had one child, Bill. He worked in the family business until 1992 when he became Chief of Staff and right hand to the late Zachary Fisher, the philanthropist who saved the Intrepid Sea Air Space Museum where he remained as its President for almost 20 years raising hundreds of millions for our nation's Veterans. He is now the CEO of Constellations Group in New York City.

He and Bryan's parents, Joe and Donna Eure and their daughter Adrienne and husband Todd Henningsen were the best of friends. Bill is survived by Patricia, Bill and Bryan and over 80 plus nieces, nephews, cousins, spouses and children thereof. He adored them all.

2015-06-03T00:00:00Z,"BARRY--Edward. We are saddened to report that Ed Barry, who was the President of Oxford University Press, USA, from 1982 to 2000, has passed away after a short illness. Before joining OUP, Ed spent twenty years at Macmillan Publishing Company, achieving the post of President of The Free Press, and subsequently President to the Professional Books Division, which included The Free Press, Macmillan Library Reference, Schirmer Books, and Macmillan Scientific, Technical, Medical, and Professional. In the nearly two decades that Ed oversaw our US operations, the Press made significant strides in most every realm of its publishing. Oxford's reference publishing, an area in which Ed had particular expertise dating back to his Macmillan years, expanded dramatically. Our trade and college textbook publishing flourished, and academic publishing expanded from its beginnings as a small list in philosophy to a program that encompassed works in most humanities, social science, and science disciplines. And the overall profile of the Press changed significantly, with the US's role shifting from primarily that of distributor of UK-generated books to one with a distinct and influential publishing identity of its own. Ed also oversaw the relocation of both the warehouse facility from Fair Lawn, NJ to Cary, NC, and the New York offices from a relatively modest space at 200 Madison (in what was then, to Ed's discomfort, known as ""the Putnam Berkeley building"") to the current location, in each instance a challenging and complicated advancement for the Press. Ed was known as a strong advocate for his people, an ambitious publisher, and a ""numbers man"": someone who could tame the unwieldy beast of a publishing P&L. He combined business expertise and love of publishing in a way that set him, and Oxford USA, apart. To opt for an obvious metaphor, Ed Barry left his imprint on OUP. 1/3"

She was 59 years old. She retired in 2014. She worked under five chancellors. During her tenure, she helped reporters after 9/11 understand where schools provided long-term counseling for student and staff throughout the city, and she also helped reporters navigate the uncharted waters of the early stages of mayoral control. She was dependable, available and dedicated to the city she loved. Her best memories, she would tell friends, was her time as a reporter for the New York Post from 1981-1990. She covered the transit beat and often remarked she covered anything that moves- cars, buses, subway, ferries, commuter trains. She wrote an exclusive story about the lack of engineers who maintain subway tracks that could lead to derailments if not properly handled, and another exclusive about gaps between subways and many platforms leading to missteps by riders. The problem still plagues the subway system. She enjoyed traveling and went to Europe often. She also went to Alaska but never got to see Sweden or Norway. She loved animals, especially a very special cocker spaniel named Rusty with White paws and neck- the epitome of regal- who was part of the family, the most important part, for 16 years. Margie leaves behind two dear friends, Pat Wilks Battle of Staten Island and Karen Minelli of Virginia. Her father, Jerry, whom she admired for his dry sense of humor and extraordinary intelligence, died in 1989 on the N/R line at Grand Central just a day after Margie, as a reporter, attended a press conference thee. Her mother, Alice, died in 2014 after a long-term career as an occupational therapist. Service Monday, June 8th, 12 noon, at ""The Riverside,"" 76 St. and Amsterdam Ave. 1/3"

2015-06-06T00:00:00Z,"BECK--John Childress. Died peacefully at his home in Vero Beach, Florida on June 3, 2015. Son of the late Madeline Childress and T. Edmund Beck, Beck was born in Mount Vernon, NY on March 10, 1932. He attended Phillips Exeter Academy before graduating from the Wooster School in 1949. He earned a BA in History from his beloved Princeton University in 1953. While at Princeton, Beck was part of a nationally ranked crew team that narrowly missed capturing an Olympic berth for the 1952 games. He captained the varsity crew team the following year. Immediately following college, Beck served in the US Navy rising to the rank of Lieutenant (J.G.). He went on to earn an MBA from Harvard Business School in 1958 before joining Beck, Mack & Oliver, an investment counseling firm founded by his father and two of his father's Princeton colleagues. Beck became a partner in 1962 and later, Senior Partner. During his time with Beck, Mack & Oliver, based on his own investment prowess and extraordinarily personable style, Beck oversaw the firm's growth to becoming a leader in investment counseling. His advice and investment acumen were sought from individuals and institutions alike. He served on many boards, including Russell Reynolds Associates, the Chubb Corporation, Colonial Williamsburg, and most preciously to him, Princeton University. As a trustee at Princeton, he chaired the University's Investment Committee and during his tenure, created the Princeton Investment Company (Princo) which continues to manage the University's endowment. Beck prided himself as much on his personal touch as his facility with numbers. Even at six foot five, he was approachable, his often intimidating facade giving way to a warm, welcome, and very quick sense of humor. Still, he relished competition and put his size and wily southpaw to good use in racquet sports, in particular. Following in the footsteps of his mother, Beck became a nationally ranked platform tennis player in the mid 70's, taking the National Mixed Doubles title with his sister, Susan Beck Wasch, in 1972 and the National Men's title with Herbert Fitzgibbon in 1974. He was also an avid if not often successful fly fisherman and hunter. He reluctantly retired from Beck, Mack & Oliver in 1997 but took comfort in handing the reins of the firm to his eldest son, Robert Childress Beck of New York, NY. Beck maintained his primary residence in Bedford, NY. He is survived by his wife of fourteen years, Marilyn McClure Plumb Beck, and four other children from his first marriage to the former Mary Boulton Fiske (Beck): William Fiske Beck of Chappaqua, NY, Susanne Boulton Beck of Boston, MA, Christopher Mackay Beck of Mendham, NJ, and Edwin Wells Beck of Darien, CT. He also leaves behind fourteen grandchildren, his younger sister, Susan Wasch Beck, of Middletown, CT, and his older brother, Thaddeus Edmund Beck Jr. of Vienna, VA. Services will be held on Thursday, June 25th at 11AM at Saint Matthew's Episcopal Church, 382 Cantitoe St, Bedford, NY. In lieu of flowers, donations may be made to The Wooster School, 91 Miry Brook Rd, Danbury, CT 06810, to support financial aid; or to the Michael J. Fox Foundation, P.O.

2015-06-06T00:00:00Z,"WEITZ--Mel. It is with profound sadness that we announce the passing of Mel Weitz, the legendary supermarket innovator, and our beloved father, grandfather and husband. Melvin Weitz, who began delivering milk to his Brooklyn neighbors as a six year old in order to help support his family during the Depression, and was handling heavy boxes at the local grocery store by the age of ten and eventually, as an adult, built a 17-unit high volume chain of supermarkets on Long Island, died on June 4 at his home in Boca Raton, FL. He was 91. ""His mind was sharp and his spirit loving and generous until his very last breath,"" said his daughter Lori Shabtai, who describes her father as ""an officer, a gentleman, and a visionary."" Born on December 20, 1923, Mel Weitz served in the United States Navy during World War II and was a survivor of the USS Quincy, a heavy cruiser that sunk at the Battle of Savo Island on August 9, 1942, having been attacked by a large Japanese naval force, which left 370 American men dead. Mr. Weitz spent hours in the water attempting to rescue his shipmates and was awarded the Purple Heart by the U.S. Government. After leaving the military, Mel Weitz excelled in the grocery business. Employed as a manager by the Big Apple Supermarket chain in New York, he eventually became its president. In 1972, at the age of 48, he decided to implement his own ideas as to how supermarkets should look and be run. Mr. Weitz' markets were larger and better stocked then others from that era. Each Melmarkets' Foodtown Supermarket was over 60,000 square feet when the industry median stood at about 42,000. Considered a businessman of great vision and a master merchandiser, Mr. Weitz built his company, Melmarkets. Inc. from a single Foodtown store into a small empire across Nassau and Suffolk Counties. According to an article in Forbes Magazine dated November 18 1992, ""When it comes to sheer profitability, Melmarkets has few peers. That high average checkout number is the key."" Mr. Weitz' customers were spending twice as much per transaction as the national average. His credo was to pile high and sell low. He understood his clientele, and was admired for the superior quality of his produce and his commitment to customer service. And shoppers enjoyed the theatricality of Mel Weitz' presentations, which included such features as visiting rabbis offering matzoh making demonstrations and a loudspeaker inviting Easter celebrants to a ham sale. Each spring, for six weeks, he opened an entire 65,000 square foot Kosher for Passover supermarket, a precursor to the trendy pop-up stores of today. There were always tempting aromas from the on-site bakeries and freshly roasted chickens in the deli-sections of his Foodtowns, and usually, plenty of free samples. These were startling innovations when they first appeared in Mr. Weitz' markets. Club discount cards and low-priced bulk merchandise were also part of Mel Weitz' unique marketing strategies. Mr. Weitz married three times, and is survived by his loving wife Ellen, his brother Phil Weitz, 93 years old, and four children from his previous marriages: Bruce (and Lil) Weitz, Pamela (and Alan) Gordon, Steven Weitz, and Lori Shabtai. Other survivors include his stepdaughters, Lannie Lipson and Sage Augello, and their husbands, Michael Furgiuele and Vincent Augello, and fourteen grandchildren from all of his children and stepchildren: Justin Gordon, Brendon and Sumner Weitz, Nicole Shabtai (and Doug Mand), Danielle and David Shabtai, Jonathan, Ashley, and Brandon Weitz, Jared and Courtney Lipson, and Sage, Samantha and Julie Augello. Mel Weitz told Forbes in 1992, ""When you read my name in the obituaries, that is when I will retire."" He actually retired some years prior to today, when The Stop & Shop Companies purchased Melmarkets. but his visionary impact on the supermarket industry remains in effect. Funeral services will be held graveside at South Florida National Cemetery, 6501 S. State Road 7, Lake Worth, FL 33449 (561-649-6489) on Monday, June 8 at 9:30am. Mel Weitz' family requests that any donations in Mr. Weitz' name be made to the charity of the donor's choice as that would befit his unique and giving style. Mel Weitz' remarkable legacy will be long remembered. His honesty, listening skills, straight talk and great compassion made him an elder statesman for all who crossed his path. The memory of this fine gentleman, a true creative force, will be cherished by his devoted family, dear friends, and thousands of former satisfied customers. As his daughter Lori Shabtai sadly pens this obituary, she adds, ""The world lost a very special angel on Thursday and he will be deeply missed but remain with and in all those who were fortunate to know and love him. Dad, I am honored to have been your daughter and I will miss you every day of my life."" 1/3"

2015-06-07T00:00:00Z,"WHITE--William. William John White, 84, May 27, 2015, died peacefully at NYU Medical Center Thursday morning following an almost decade long battle with renal failure and bone cancer. He was truly a warrior heading through snowstorms and hurricanes to receive dialysis three times a week for four hours a day at 6:00am. A long fought struggle through pain and great suffering is now at end as he is with God in Heaven. Bill was born on August 2, 1930 to Tom and Elizabeth White in Brooklyn, New York. His mother passed away when he was 10 years old and he and his only sibling Tom Jr. found great sanctuary in their summer home at Point Lookout, New York. Tom went off to World War II becoming a key man on General Patton's team at the wars end. He returned home and after years of Bill selling printing presses to industry decided to join forces with his brother. They build some of the greatest, celebrated and indeed simple New York restaurants. Their three star New York Times Giraffe on East 58th Street featured a 20 foot silver giraffe out front and boasted clientele including Aristotle Onassis and John and Yoko Lennon. Their upper East side Beach Cafe on 70th Street and 2nd Avenue which they held for 37 years still continues at 48 years strong with a former manager Dave Goodside. The Point View Inn in in Point Lookout, now the Fisherman's Catch, was a bowling alley when Bill was young. He was a ""pinboy"" and 50 years later owned the 500 seat seaside lobster joint with other dear family members. He founded the Point Lookout Chamber of Commerce and was a distinguished member of the community there. He was an active member of the Point Lookout Civic Association for over 50 years. He and Patricia are parishioners of Our Lady of the Miraculous Medal R.C. for 65 years. He met his beloved wife Patricia at Ladycliff College in 1955 at a dance near West Point. They later married on May 18, 1957 and remained the loves of each other's lives, best friends and soulmates for 58 years. Two weeks ago this was celebrated at Le Grainne Cafe where he had his favorite french toast. He and Pat travelled the world excited to explore culture and cuisine.

Mr. Weitz spent hours in the water attempting to rescue his shipmates and was awarded the Purple Heart by the U.S. Government. After leaving the military, Mel Weitz excelled in the grocery business. Employed as a manager by the Big Apple Supermarket chain in New York, he eventually became its president. In 1972, at the age of 48, he decided to implement his own ideas as to how supermarkets should look and be run. Mr. Weitz' markets were larger and better stocked then others from that era. Each Melmarkets' Foodtown Supermarket was over 60,000 square feet when the industry median stood at about 42,000. Considered a businessman of great vision and a master merchandiser, Mr. Weitz built his company, Melmarkets. Inc. from a single Foodtown store into a small empire across Nassau and Suffolk Counties. According to an article in Forbes Magazine dated November 18 1992, ""When it comes to sheer profitability, Melmarkets has few peers. That high average checkout number is the key."" Mr. Weitz' customers were spending twice as much per transaction as the national average. His credo was to pile high and sell low. He understood his clientele, and was admired for the superior quality of his produce and his commitment to customer service. And shoppers enjoyed the theatricality of Mel Weitz' presentations, which included such features as visiting rabbis offering matzoh making demonstrations and a loudspeaker inviting Easter celebrants to a ham sale. Each spring, for six weeks, he opened an entire 65,000 square foot Kosher for Passover supermarket, a precursor to the trendy pop-up stores of today. There were always tempting aromas from the on-site bakeries and freshly roasted chickens in the deli-sections of his Foodtowns, and usually, plenty of free samples. These were startling innovations when they first appeared in Mr. Weitz' markets. Club discount cards and low-priced bulk merchandise were also part of Mel Weitz' unique marketing strategies. Mr. Weitz married three times, and is survived by his loving wife Ellen, his brother Phil Weitz, 93 years old, and four children from his previous marriages: Bruce (and Lil) Weitz, Pamela (and Alan) Gordon, Steven Weitz, and Lori Shabtai. Other survivors include his stepdaughters, Lannie Lipson and Sage Augello, and their husbands, Michael Furgiuele and Vincent Augello, and fourteen grandchildren from all of his children and stepchildren: Justin Gordon, Brendon and Sumner Weitz, Nicole Shabtai (and Doug Mand), Danielle and David Shabtai, Jonathan, Ashley, and Brandon Weitz, Jared and Courtney Lipson, and Sage, Samantha and Julie Augello. Mel Weitz told Forbes in 1992, ""When you read my name in the obituaries, that is when I will retire."" He actually retired some years prior to today, when The Stop & Shop Companies purchased Melmarkets. but his visionary impact on the supermarket industry remains in effect. Funeral services will be held graveside at South Florida National Cemetery, 6501 S. State Road 7, Lake Worth, FL 33449 (561-649-6489) on Monday, June 8 at 9:30am. Mel Weitz' family requests that any donations in Mr. Weitz' name be made to the charity of the donor's choice as that would befit his unique and giving style. Mel Weitz' remarkable legacy will be long remembered. His honesty, listening skills, straight talk and great compassion made him an elder statesman for all who crossed his path. The memory of this fine gentleman, a true creative force, will be cherished by his devoted family, dear friends, and thousands of former satisfied customers. As his daughter Lori Shabtai sadly pens this obituary, she adds, ""The world lost a very special angel on Thursday and he will be deeply missed but remain with and in all those who were fortunate to know and love him. Dad, I am honored to have been your daughter and I will miss you every day of my life."" 1/3"

2015-06-07T00:00:00Z,"BECK--John Childress. Died peacefully at his home in Vero Beach, Florida on June 3, 2015. Son of the late Madeline Childress and T. Edmund Beck, Beck was born in Mount Vernon, NY on March 10, 1932. He attended Phillips Exeter Academy before graduating from the Wooster School in 1949. He earned a BA in History from his beloved Princeton University in 1953. While at Princeton, Beck was part of a nationally ranked crew team that narrowly missed capturing an Olympic berth for the 1952 games. He captained the varsity crew team the following year. Immediately following college, Beck served in the US Navy rising to the rank of Lieutenant (J.G.). He went on to earn an MBA from Harvard Business School in 1958 before joining Beck, Mack & Oliver, an investment counseling firm founded by his father and two of his father's Princeton colleagues. Beck became a partner in 1962 and later, Senior Partner. During his time with Beck, Mack & Oliver, based on his own investment prowess and extraordinarily personable style, Beck oversaw the firm's growth to becoming a leader in investment counseling. His advice and investment acumen were sought from individuals and institutions alike. He served on many boards, including Russell Reynolds Associates, the Chubb Corporation, Colonial Williamsburg, and most preciously to him, Princeton University. As a trustee at Princeton, he chaired the University's Investment Committee and during his tenure, created the Princeton Investment Company (Princo) which continues to manage the University's endowment. Beck prided himself as much on his personal touch as his facility with numbers. Even at six foot five, he was approachable, his often intimidating facade giving way to a warm, welcome, and very quick sense of humor. Still, he relished competition and put his size and wily southpaw to good use in racquet sports, in particular. Following in the footsteps of his mother, Beck became a nationally ranked platform tennis player in the mid 70's, taking the National Mixed Doubles title with his sister, Susan Beck Wasch, in 1972 and the National Men's title with Herbert Fitzgibbon in 1974. He was also an avid if not often successful fly fisherman and hunter. He reluctantly retired from Beck, Mack & Oliver in 1997 but took comfort in handing the reins of the firm to his eldest son, Robert Childress Beck of New York, NY. Beck maintained his primary residence in Bedford, NY. He is survived by his wife of fourteen years, Marilyn McClure Plumb Beck, and four other children from his first marriage to the former Mary Boulton Fiske (Beck): William Fiske Beck of Chappaqua, NY, Susanne Boulton Beck of Boston, MA, Christopher Mackay Beck of Mendham, NJ, and Edwin Wells Beck of Darien, CT. He also leaves behind fourteen grandchildren, his younger sister, Susan Beck Wasch, of Middletown, CT, and his older brother, Thaddeus Edmund Beck Jr. of Glasgow, VA. Services will be held on Thursday, June 25th at 11am at Saint Matthew's Episcopal Church, 382 Cantitoe St, Bedford, NY.

2015-06-09T00:00:00Z,"HEINS--Professor Maurice H.,of Deephaven, MN passed away on June 4, 2015 at the age of 99. He was born in Boston, MA on November 19, 1915, the third son of Samuel and Rachel Heins. As a boy, he attended Boston Latin School where he began his lifelong enjoyment of Greek and Latin literature, then attended Harvard College where he majored in Mathematics, graduated first in his class in 1937, and won a fellowship for a year of travel to mathematical centers in Europe. He received his PhD from Harvard in 1939. He was a highly prolific scholar and enjoyed a long and distinguished career in academia. His research interests were varied, but focused primarily on complex and harmonic analysis. He was the author of close to 100 research papers, published in the most prestigious journals, and three textbooks on complex analysis. He is especially known for his work on so- called Hardy classes of functions defined on Riemann surfaces and on conformal metrics. Known for his kind and gentle demeanor, Professor Heins was widely sought as a mentor and advisor. He was the thesis advisor for some nineteen students over the course of his long career. In 1940, he married Hadassah Wagman (Radcliffe 1939), and they moved to Princeton, New Jersey where Maurice conducted research at the Institute for Advanced Study as an assistant to Marston Morse, one of his teachers at Harvard. He returned to the Institute to conduct his own research in 1956. Professor Heins held academic positions at three major research universities: Brown University, the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign and the University of Maryland at College Park, where he was recruited to a distinguished chair professorship. He was invited to visiting positions and to give lectures at the major mathematics research centers in the United States and Europe, including the University of California Berkeley, Imperial College, London and the University of Paris. His long career also included stints at the Illinois Institute of Technology; a period at the Pentagon; and research and teaching for brief periods in Helsinki, Stockholm, Wurzberg, and Zurich. After retiring from his professorship at the University of Maryland, he continued to pursue his research interests, publishing papers into the 1990s. He was elected as a Fellow of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences and to the initial class of Fellows of the American Mathematical Society. He is survived by his wife of 75 years, Hadassah Wagman Heins, of Deephaven, MN; son Samuel Heins and his wife Stacey Mills of Wayzata, MN; daughter Sulamith Heins Potter of Olympia, WA; grandchildren Elizabeth Potter Scully, Madeleine Heins Israelson, Noah Potter, and Nora Heins Murray; and several great-grandchildren. Funeral services were held Monday in Minnesota. In lieu of flowers, the family requests that any memorials be made to Planned Parenthood Minnesota, North Dakota, South Dakota in St. Paul; The Ploughshares Fund in San Francisco; or the Advocates for Human Rights in Minneapolis, MN.

2015-06-09T00:00:00Z,"GRIFFIN--James. James Quigley Griffin, of Hopewell, NJ died peacefully on June 2nd after a brief illness. A revered husband, father, grandfather, farmer, sportsman and friend to countless individuals, Mr. Griffin had a diverse and inspiring career in banking, museum administration, finance, and as a trustee of numerous cultural institutions. Son of Helen Quigley and Donald Worner Griffin, Mr. Griffin was born in Lock Haven, PA on August 23, 1932. He grew up on the Princeton University campus where his father was General Secretary of the Alumni Association. He was a graduate of the Gilman School of Baltimore, MD and earned an AB in history from Princeton University in 1955. After serving as Captain in the US Army, he began a 25 year career at First National City Bank where he rose to be a Vice President and Head of Personnel for Citibank's International Division. In 1979 Mr. Griffin joined the Metropolitan Museum of Art as Treasurer and Vice President for Finance. Upon leaving the Metropolitan Museum he joined Patterson, Belknap, Webb and Tyler LLP as Treasurer. After 35 years commuting to New York City, Mr. Griffin chose to work closer to home and his family, and joined Wilmerding, Miller & Co., Inc., an investment advisory firm in Princeton, NJ as Vice President and Secretary from 1992 until the present. Mr. Griffin served as Treasurer on the Boards of the New York Historical Society, the New York Society Library, International School Services (ISS), AMIDEAST (America- Mideast Educational and Training Services, Inc.), and as a trustee at Morven Museum and Garden. Mr. Griffin was deeply committed to The Ivy Club in Princeton, where he served as the Graduate Board President from 1982 until his death. He was a longstanding member of the Century Association, the Anglers Club of New York, and Pretty Brook Tennis Club. Mr. Griffin is survived by his wife of 56 years, Barbara Moorehead Griffin; his three daughters, Barbara Griffin Cole, Cynthia Griffin Ferris, and Sarah Griffin Thompson; his sons-in-law, Christopher A. Cole, Timothy G. Ferris, Newell M. Thompson; and nine grandchildren. He and his wife lived on a working sheep farm in Hopewell, NJ where he was a passionate amateur stonemason. When not working on his legendary argillite stonewalls, he could be found in the vegetable garden or on his tractor mowing the fields. He loved nothing better than to prepare a homegrown feast for his family and friends in their warm, welcoming kitchen. In the winter, after the first cold snap, the call went out, ""Ice at Jimmy's!"" Skaters of all ages joined with him to play fast and furious shinny hockey on the Griffin's pond. He was widely known for his gentle, gracious and selfless manner, his work ethic, and his unwavering values. An optimist with a keen appreciation for individual talent in all walks of life; he was a rare person who inspired others to be better. A Memorial Service celebrating the Life of James Q. Griffin will be held at the Princeton University Chapel on June 22 at 11am. In lieu of flowers, friends may contribute to the James Q. Griffin Memorial Fund at the Princeton Area Community Foundation (15 Princess Road, Lawrenceville, NJ 08525) which will support education, leadership, and Jim's other charitable interests. 1/3"

2015-06-09T00:00:00Z,"GRIFFIN--James Q. The Board of Governors of The Ivy Club and the Trustees of the Ivy 1879 Foundation mourn with profound sorrow the passing of our friend, James Q. Griffin, Princeton Class of 1955. Jim was elected president of The Ivy Club in 1982, and he led the Club for over three decades, overseeing changes including the admission of women and the establishment of the Foundation to further the Club's educational role. He conceived of and led the effort to build a splendid addition to Ivy's Clubhouse, named by the Board the Griffin Wing despite the reluctance born of Jim's characteristic modesty. He nurtured the undergraduate members in the Club's culture by his unassuming example in word and deed, and by his endearing sense of humor. Thanks to his irresistible charm and wisdom, Jim exercised his leadership through the creation of a willing consensus in the board and the membership as a whole. His vision advanced the quality of the Club's life and enhanced its educational mission. Jim's legacy, in spirit and in stone, will always be an important part of Ivy. Jim Griffin was a natural and complete gentleman, a loyal Princetonian and a man utterly devoted to his family and his friends. The values by which he lived, and the standards he set, inspired all those whose lives he touched. We shall miss him greatly. The Trustees of the Foundation join the Governors of Ivy in extending to Jim's wife, Barbie, and to his entire family, our heartfelt condolences. The Ivy Club Corbin R. Miller, Treasurer Robert A. Engel, Secretary Ivy 1879 Foundation John F. Cook, President Frances P. Jain, Secretary 1/3"

Suzanne is survived by her son John E. Scanlan of New York City, her sister Mrs. Robert F. Brown of Scranton, PA, and many beloved nieces and nephews and their families. She was the daughter of the late Mr. and Mrs. Edmund F. O'Neill of Brooklyn, where she was born on August 6, 1920. Mrs. Scanlan had a long legal career, spending the last 37 years of her working life with the firm of Cullen & Dykman.

She and her husband, also a lawyer, lived in Riverdale for over 20 years, where they raised their sons. She returned to practicing law in 1975, and ran for the New York State Assembly in the 73rd District in 1986. A wake is being held at the Frank E. Campbell Madison Ave and 81st Street on Thursday and Friday 2-5pm and 7-9pm. A Funeral Mass is being celebrated at St. Ignatius Loyola Roman Catholic Church on Saturday June 13th at 10:00am.

2015-06-10T00:00:00Z,"WARD--Arthur C. 1921-2015 Hilton Head, SC formerly of Franklin Lakes, NJ. On June 5th, Arthur Charles Ward passed away peacefully after a brief illness, just short of his 94th birthday. Truly a Renaissance man, he was an artist, a wordsmith and an entrepreneur but mostly he was a good, kind and generous man, above all he was Daddy, Poppop and Arfie. Born in New York City he grew up in Rutherford, NJ where he graduated from high school in 1939. He attended Hamilton College, graduating in February of 1943 and immediately entered the Army in the 293rd Combat Engineers. His unit was posted to Patten's Third Army and served from Normandy through Germany until the end of the war. Returning home with both his parents deceased, he started work at P.E. Guerin with his aunt, Marguerite Guerin. The firm had been closed during the war but was starting up again with little money, a skeleton work force but an established reputation as the finest source for decorative hardware and bathroom fittings. The clientele was the top architects and interior designers. He became the owner through the years and his artistry and design still graces well known public buildings, museums, park and historic residences, both in New York and throughout the country. He met Nancy (Ann) Davies on a blind date and they were married on May 16th , 1953. They had 62 wonderful years together and were truly soulmates. He is survived by his wife Nancy; daughter Kathryn and her husband Dr. Thaddeus Grabowy, Rumson, NJ, son Andrew and his wife, Mary, Franklin Lakes, NJ. Grandchildren: T.J., Allie, Katie, Christina and Thomas Grabowy, Tara, Ryan, Christopher and Cameron Ward. Niece Susie (Ken) Barkauskas, Allendale, NJ and nephew Doug (Ginger) Ward, AZ. Rest in peace Arthur Ward, you will be sorely missed. Funeral Mass will be celebrated Saturday, June 20, 2015, 10:30am in the Church of the Precious Blood, 72 Riverdale Avenue, Monmouth Beach, NJ 07750. Interment will be private.

Born in Manchester, NH, he considered Manhattan his home for more than sixty years. He attended Pratt Institute but left because he did not feel its direction was compatible with his own vision. Eventually he graduated from NYU. Devoted to his artwork he chronicled the landscape of the city, its people and fellow employees of the Typographical Union in paintings, watercolors, washes and etchings. His prints are represented by The Old Print Shop. With a wide range of interests and capabilities, he was especially proud of the home he built in Connecticut.

George Herbert Weller, retired US Coast Guard officer, attorney, and beloved family man, passed away on May 25th, Memorial Day, at age 94 at St. Paul's Towers retirement community in Oakland, California. Raised in Los Angeles, George attended Manual Arts High School and graduated from the US Coast Guard Academy in 1944. Shortly after graduation, he married the love of his life, Alice Carey, whom he had met at Connecticut College. George served at sea for many years, transporting GI's to Europe and returning with German POW's in the last year of WWII. After the war he captained an all-Filipino crew on a mission to relight Philippine lighthouses. With George as deck officer, the icebreaker CGC Eastwind pushed the farthest north of any ship under its own power up to that time (1948), and on its return home became the first ship to transit Fury and Hecla Strait. George spent several additional tours of duty on weather patrol in both the North Atlantic and the Pacific. Sent by the Coast Guard to George Washington University Law School, he received his J.D. in 1957 and subsequently served as USCG legal officer in California, Virginia, and New York. He coached a high school debate team and was frequently enlisted by colleagues and family members for his canny critiques. Committed to racial justice, he volunteered in the summers of 1964 and 1965 as a civil rights attorney for the Lawyers' Constitutional Defense Committed in Jacksonville, Florida and Shreveport, Louisiana. George later served as Assistant US Attorney, Eastern District of New York, 1971-1976, then as Assistant Attorney General for the State of Michigan, 1976-2002. In the latter post he defended statutes raising the drinking age to 21 and regulating lobbyists as well as arguing successfully before the US Supreme Court in Will v. Michigan State Police (1989). He retired at age 81 to California with his cherished wife Alice. George was a man of integrity, humility, humor, and courage. He was a lifelong active Catholic and liberal Democrat. Deeply loved by a wide circle of family and friends, George and Alice lent helping hands to countless people and causes over the years. In addition to his wife, George is survived by his son, Stephen Weller, daughter Karen Weller, daughter Valerie Weller and son-in-law Carl Guarneri, son-in-law Kevin McCoy and daughter-in-law Mary Geddes. His daughter Suzanne Weller passed away in 2000. He is also survived by more than a dozen beloved grandchildren and great- grandchildren.

In 1982, he was elected President of Neuberger Berman Management, Inc. and ultimately became a Partner in Neuberger Berman, LLC. Stan served for many years on the board of the Investment Company Institute and was President of the No-Load Mutual Fund Association. Considered a maverick both professionally and personally, Stanley's genius was his creativity and focus. He will be sorely missed and his life accomplishments will be an inspiration for all of the generations of family that will succeed him. Contributions in his memory to the Taub Alzheimer's Disease Research Institute 630 W. 168th St., PH 19, New York, NY 10032 would be greatly appreciated. 1/3"

2015-06-13T00:00:00Z,"MULHOLLAND--James S.,II. James S. Mulholland, II, age 91, a pioneer in Computer Magazine Publishing and a Co- founder of Hayden Publishing Company, died peacefully at his home in Vero Beach, Florida. He is survived by his loving wife Clariel (Claire) of sixty years, his son James III of Vero Beach, FL, daughter Marie of Evergreen, CO, sister Ethel Barth of Scotch Plains, NJ, and nine Grandchildren. In addition to living in Florida, Jim spent more than fifty years as a summer resident of Southampton, New York. He was born and raised in Brooklyn, NY where he graduated as the class valedictorian from P.S. 201 and the St. Francis Preparatory School. Jim then went on to M.I.T. After his sophomore year, World War II erupted and he was drafted into the Navy. He served as a Lieutenant Junior Grade and Navigation Officer aboard the USS Columbus for three years. After the war he returned to M.I.T., completed his education and graduated with a degree in General Engineering. His first job was with Reinhold Publishing as an advertising salesman for the American Chemical Society magazine and he attended the N.Y.U. Graduate School of Business at night. The electronics market was burgeoning and it was in 1952 that he co-founded Hayden Publishing Company. Electronic Design magazine was the first publication from Hayden with Microwaves+RF, Computer Decisions, Personal Computing, Systems+Software, and the Gold Book, A Master Directory for the Electronics Industry, eventually joining the stable of magazines. In 1961, Hayden acquired the John F. Rider Book Company, along with Ahrens Publishing. The company in the early 1970's acquired the exclusive world-wide marketing and distribution rights to the books published by Spartan Books. Hayden Book Company published over six-hundred books under the Hayden, Rider and Ahrens imprints. Popular titles ranged from Basic Electricity (Volumes 1 through 5), Electronics One- Seven, Basic: Basic: An Introduction to Computer Programming, to Introduction to the Novel, Writing to be Read, Introduction to the Short Story, The Bakers' Manual for Quantity Baking and Pastry Making and Modern Hotel/Motel Management Methods. As an early proponent of personal computers, Jim founded the Hayden Software Company in 1978. The company specialized in personal computing software programs for the first generation of personal computers, including the Radio Shack, Atari, IBM and Apple computers. Programs such as Sargon III, and Pie Writer were some of the more successful Hayden programs during the early days of personal computers. As a prominent magazine publisher, Jim was a board member of the American Business Press, a trade group, and represented the association in negotiations with the Postal Rate Commission to grant equal postal rates and delivery times to the trade magazines which were already enjoyed by the commercial press. During the climax of the Cold War Years, Jim contacted Judge James L. Buckley, then President of Radio Free Europe and Radio Liberty, to provide religious programming that would be broadcast to the Eastern European countries influenced and controlled by Soviet Communism. After selling Hayden Publishing, Hayden Book Company, and Hayden Software Company in 1986, Jim organized a World Day of Prayer on the Fortieth Anniversary of the ratification of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights by the United Nations. Jim in the 1990's continued with his love of technology with early stage investments in several Internet related businesses. Jim was an avid skier and tennis player, was an early proponent of Platform Tennis(Paddle Tennis), and loved the water as a life-long swimmer, and sailor. Jim was a member of the Young Presidents Organization, the World Business Organization and the Chief Executives Organization. Together with his wife, he enjoyed their world-wide travels with these organizations. Jim loved his Catholic Faith and created a Catholic Information Center on the Internet. He was a Knight Commander of St. Gregory, the highest honor granted to a layman by the Vatican, was a Knight of the Equestrian Order of the Holy Sepulchre of Jerusalem, as well as a Knight of the Sovereign Order of Malta. Jim was a past Director of the American Business, Press, The New York Athletic Club, The Portsmouth Abbey School Board of Consultants, The Research Center for Religious & Human Rights in Closed Societies, CREED (The Christian Rescue Effort for the Emancipation of Dissidents), The Temple of Understanding, the Religious News Service, and along with Cardinal Martino, the Papal Nuncio to the United Nations from the Holy See, the Path to Peace Foundation.

In addition to living in Florida, Jim spent more than fifty years as a summer resident of Southampton, New York. He was born and raised in Brooklyn, NY where he graduated as the class valedictorian from P.S. 201 and the St. Francis Preparatory School. Jim then went on to M.I.T. After his sophomore year, World War II erupted and he was drafted into the Navy. He served as a Lieutenant Junior Grade and Navigation Officer aboard the USS Columbus for three years. After the war he returned to M.I.T., completed his education and graduated with a degree in General Engineering. His first job was with Reinhold Publishing as an advertising salesman for the American Chemical Society magazine and he attended the N.Y.U. Graduate School of Business at night. The electronics market was burgeoning and it was in 1952 that he co-founded Hayden Publishing Company. Electronic Design magazine was the first publication from Hayden with Microwaves+RF, Computer Decisions, Personal Computing, Systems+Software, and the Gold Book, A Master Directory for the Electronics Industry, eventually joining the stable of magazines. In 1961, Hayden acquired the John F. Rider Book Company, along with Ahrens Publishing. The company in the early 1970's acquired the exclusive world-wide marketing and distribution rights to the books published by Spartan Books.

The company specialized in personal computing software programs for the first generation of personal computers, including the Radio Shack, Atari, IBM and Apple computers. Programs such as Sargon III, and Pie Writer were some of the more successful Hayden programs during the early days of personal computers. As a prominent magazine publisher, Jim was a board member of the American Business Press, a trade group, and represented the association in negotiations with the Postal Rate Commission to grant equal postal rates and delivery times to the trade magazines which were already enjoyed by the commercial press. During the climax of the Cold War Years, Jim contacted Judge James L. Buckley, then President of Radio Free Europe and Radio Liberty, to provide religious programming that would be broadcast to the Eastern European countries influenced and controlled by Soviet Communism. After selling Hayden Publishing, Hayden Book Company, and Hayden Software Company in 1986, Jim organized a World Day of Prayer on the Fortieth Anniversary of the ratification of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights by the United Nations. Jim in the 1990's continued with his love of technology with early stage investments in several Internet related businesses. Jim was an avid skier and tennis player, was an early proponent of Platform Tennis(Paddle Tennis), and loved the water as a life-long swimmer, and sailor. Jim was a member of the Young Presidents Organization, the World Business Organization and the Chief Executives Organization.
