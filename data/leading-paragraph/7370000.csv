If the jobs bill is not passed, the $50 billion would represent 7 percent of the savings needed to reduce next year's deficit to a level economists consider sustainable, not one-fourth of the savings."

Before fans get caught up in any irrational exuberance, hear this -- the match was part of a sophisticated computer simulation using EA Sports's 2010 FIFA World Cup South Africa video game, which went on sale on April 27. The simulation, on an Xbox 360 system, played the entire 32-team, 64-game tournament that will not begin, for real, until June 11, when the hosts face Mexico in Johannesburg.

Only 41,000 private jobs were created, far short of expectations of 150,000 to 180,000 jobs, and unemployment rates remained steady.

2010-06-06T17:15:34Z,"Have you ever thought about whether to have a child? If so, what factors entered into your decision? Was it whether having children would be good for you, your partner and others close to the possible child, such as children you may already have, or perhaps your parents? For most people contemplating reproduction, those are the dominant questions. Some may also think about the desirability of adding to the strain that the nearly seven billion people already here are putting on our planet's environment. But very few ask whether coming into existence is a good thing for the child itself. Most of those who consider that question probably do so because they have some reason to fear that the child's life would be especially difficult - for example, if they have a family history of a devastating illness, physical or mental, that cannot yet be detected prenatally.All this suggests that we think it is wrong to bring into the world a child whose prospects for a happy, healthy life are poor, but we don't usually think the fact that a child is likely to have a happy, healthy life is a reason for bringing the child into existence. This has come to be known among philosophers as ""the asymmetry"" and it is not easy to justify. But rather than go into the explanations usually proffered - and why they fail - I want to raise a related problem. How good does life have to be, to make it reasonable to bring a child into the world? Is the standard of life experienced by most people in developed nations today good enough to make this decision unproblematic, in the absence of specific knowledge that the child will have a severe genetic disease or other problem?"

2010-06-06T00:00:00Z,"It's unfortunate that this assessment of the album makes it sound like the pop tunes have been cleaned up and dumbed down rather than done with attitude and flourish. I'm in the younger demographic and would love this CD if the songs were done in a new and funky way. I feel like the older demographic is either going to want to stick to its usual classical music or listen to the original songs, if it's just straightforward covers. I hope that's not the case, because I appreciate many of these bands, and it sounds as if Ms. Fleming has legitimate talent.

The inherent contradiction is part of what made him as fascinating a person as he was a ballplayer. And let's make no mistake: from 1989 through 1999, with the Seattle Mariners, Griffey was truly incandescent. He oozed potential and lived up to it. The choices his contemporaries made in the steroids era have saddened or angered so many fans, yet Griffey stands apart. He was the best of his day, no asterisks needed."

Just making my way down subway stairs at rush hour, with people breathing down my neck, is holy terror. But it is not the physical strain of steps and crowds that is my main source of anxiety. It is the naive, inappropriate and sometimes downright mean comments that people make. Because the umbilical cord was wrapped around my neck at birth, I have an awkward gait and slurred speech. In the disability realm, mine are relatively minor. I don't use assistance devices. I have two master's degrees and have been a professor and poet for many years.

We are looking for suggestions on reasonable hotels in either city within walking distance of the must-see sites. We plan on trips to Olympic and Mount Rainier National Parks and wondered how easy it would be to rent camping gear (tents and sleeping bags) for a few nights in the great outdoors. Sue Berger, Huntington Woods, Mich. A.First, be sure to make hotel reservations before going to Seattle, as July is peak season. The Edgewater Hotel (edgewaterhotel.com; from $249, double occupancy) and the nearby Seattle Marriott Waterfront (www.marriott.com; $269, double occupancy) are on the waterfront and close to several must-see sights. Consult Matthew Preusch's ''36 Hours in Seattle'' (Nov. 23, 2008) for further sightseeing and dining suggestions (which you can find in our Seattle destination guide at nytimes.com/travel). Take a stroll on the waterfront; on a clear day, you can see the Olympic Mountains across Elliott Bay. Stroll to the Seattle Aquarium, which the children will enjoy, and the Olympic Sculpture Park, where you'll find Alexander Calder's spider-like sculpture, ''Eagle,'' above. Afterward, make your way to the Space Needle; the observation deck, at 520 feet, offers a stunning panorama of the city and its surrounding landscape."

It's this Lonely Planet circuit that everyone just signs on to, hops into the land cruiser with six other hippies, cruises with their guitars and doesn't even think about it. But if you look on the map, it's actually far better to go in reverse. And it's really cheap, like $150 extra to say 'Give us a car and a driver and let's do it ourselves.' The nothingness is what made it one of the most unique places I've ever been to. Your perceptions are just completely thrown off. Distance becomes obsolete. It's just white and blue and that's all there is. Our guide was used to normal groups staying in hostels, but we were determined to spend that night on the salt flat. It was really windy, and we kept telling him it would be warm with three people in the tent. But he ended up sleeping in the car. He even ate his dinner in there.'' As told to Seth Kugel"

2010-06-06T00:00:00Z,"If you're going to start a line of biographical comic books devoted to ''culturally relevant celebrities and pop-culture icons,'' Lady Gaga is probably a good choice to inaugurate the series. But the first issue of ''Fame,'' published by Bluewater Productions, is very strange. The story is told from the perspective of Lester Bangs, a homage to the rock critic depicted in ''Almost Famous.'' Bangs becomes a fan of Lady Gaga after a chance viewing of one of her videos on MTV and quickly evolves into a fanatic (a la Robert De Niro in ''The Fan'' or Jennifer Jason Leigh in ''Single White Female''). Bangs goes from seeing himself as the male lead in the ''Paparazzi'' video to being Gaga herself. In another scene, he dons a wig and performs ''Poker Face.'' The blonde locks do not do the dark-haired, chubby schmo any favors."

Beloved husband of Thelma; devoted father of John, Denise and Steven; and loving grandfather of Angela, Robyn, Cameron, Jake and Ryan. Survived by all, he will be missed by all. Preceded in death by his parents, Frank and Elsie Luttrell; his siblings, Howard, Charles, Alfred, Herbert, Mildred, Florence, and Marian; he is survived by his sister Lorene. Amidst the hardship of the Great Depression, John was born into a poor family with nine children in rural Christian County, Missouri. Later, his family moved to the small town of Leon, Kansas, where John grew up. An accomplished student-athlete in high school, John accepted an unsolicited offer of financial assistance by the town doctor and his wife, Harry and Dorothy Last, so he could enroll at the University of Kansas. During college, John demonstrated a native facility for high mathematics, but also enjoyed collegiate life as president of his social fraternity, Lambda Chi Alpha. John had a long and distinguished career with Mobil Oil Corporation. He began as a rig worker in between his sophomore and junior years at KU, and joined the company's exploration and producing division in 1952 after completing a Bachelor of Science degree in petroleum engineering, where he earned high honors. Across 37 years with Mobil, beginning in Venezuela, he rose to become the youngest managing director in the history of the company, running Mobil operations first in Libya, then Nigeria, and then Mobil North Sea, based in London. At the time of his retirement, he was vice president of Mobil worldwide exploration and producing, based in New York. Known for his fairness and generosity, he was a private family man who nonetheless touched the lives of many in a positive way. During his later years, he developed an interest in theoretical physics and spent countless hours studying vanguard theories in quantum mechanics. Many mornings, he could be seen walking his rat terrier, Chelsea, and later Dunster, in Selleck's Woods in Darien. For more than 50 years, John loved his wife and family, his friends, and, of course, the KU Jayhawks basketball team. Rock, Chalk, Jayhawk! Donations may be made in memory of John Luttrell to the Dr. Harry Last Memorial Scholarship, KU Endowment Association, PO Box 928, Lawrence, Kansas, 66044.

Beloved great-grandfather ""Papa Hymie"" to William Samuel Brown, Zoe Judith Mildred Sansted, Zachary Dakota Aloysius Sansted and Zia Eva Dora Sansted, all of Connecticut, he was also father-in-law to Judith Ann Brown of Manhattan. He was the Widow of Mildred Brown and Shirley Goodman. He was preceded in death by his parents Samuel Brown and Dora Arkis Brown who were immigrants from Odessa, Russia, His brothers Mende Brown and Nathan Brown. He also leaves behind his beloved caretaker Zulfiya Ziyakhodjaev, who gave structure, meaning, and love to his final years, his great friend and doctor Cameron Hernandez of Mt Sinai Visiting Doctors, who he admired as a doctor and loved as a friend, a neighborhood full of people who loved him, and a bustling building full of devoted staff who were more than just that to him; they looked out for him, listened to him and enabled him to remain the independent guy that he was until the very end. He was a member of the community of North Stamford, CT, where he spent every weekend and most summers for his entire life, and he leaves behind a group of friends there who have been a tremendous foundation, providing a retreat to a very intense and creative mind. He also leaves a wonderful, talented, and devoted group of actors who he has worked with for years and who have remained his loyal friends and creative inspiration throughout more years than any may want to admit. He surely joins those who left this earth before him at some heavenly table-reading, throwing a cue, joking with Zero, and listening to Mercy growl out a laugh. He grew up in the Brownsville section of Brooklyn, fluent in Yiddish, and only learned English upon his entry into public school. Steeped in music and great classics, he played violin, and excelled intellectually, while attending Boy's High School with the likes of Bugsy Seigel and The Amboy Dukes. He attended Brooklyn College and Brooklyn Law School graduating as valedictorian with a law degree in 1931, but acting was his great passion, and he already was producing and performing in live theater, Catskills revues, and on the fast growing medium of radio. Legendary creator, producer, director of radio drama, beginning in 1927 with the Hi Brow Readings, he was a one man show, often seen riding a horse in Central Park or walking the country roads of his Stamford, CT retreat while editing scripts with a red pencil, he was a mysterious figure to many but a regular guy to those that knew him. Some of his notable series include The Rise of the Goldbergs, Dick Tracy, Adventures of the Thin Man, Inner Sanctum Mysteries, Grand central Station, and the Peabody Winning CBS Radio Mystery Theater. In the 1950s he bought Players Studios at 221 West 26th Street, now Chelsea Studios, to produce his shows. He was a Founding Member of the Director's Guild of America, proud AFTRA member, a philanthropist and founder of The Radio Drama Network to propagate the spoken word, and was devoted to health care causes and the issues facing people over 50. He was a proud liberal, intellectual, art collector, and legendarily frugal. A member of the Radio Hall of Fame, Brown is the recipient of the American Broadcast Pioneer and the Peabody Award. Brown has taught audio drama at Brooklyn College and the School of Visual Arts. He has lived at the same apartment on Central Park West since 1938.

Like conversations with strangers on a train, these random literaryencounters can be unsettling, distracting or life changing. Eight writers tell us what they have read on their summer vacations. In a small bed-and-breakfast in Mexico, I found a copy of ''Unreliable Memoirs'' -- the autobiography of the Australian critic, poet and novelist Clive James. I'd never heard of James before, but this battered, swollen, salt-stained, absolutely enchanting paperback sent me home with an assignment: to read everything he'd ever written. As it turned out, this was a huge task (it consumed pretty much all of 2008), especially considering that James's writings include the great tome ''Cultural Amnesia,'' the reading of which is something like getting a master's degree in 20th-century intellectual history."

The layers of images, from flea-market oil portraits and Greek studies to '40s crime-scene photos and an amazing shot of the Knicks at the airport, circa 1969, speak of an odd inheritance indeed."

2010-06-06T00:00:00Z,"PRUETT--Eddie, The Last of Sugar Babies' Gaiety Quartet. Edward (Eddie) Pruett passed from life suddenly on June 3, 2010, at home, with his life partner, Lawrence (Larry) Hooper desperately trying to save his life while awaiting medics. Eddie's was such a good life and deservedly so -- he was such a good person. Ask anyone who ever knew him. Eddie was born in Terre Haute, Indiana, on July 21, 1951, the son of Fred A. Pruett and Edna Cope Pruett. The family, including two sisters, Ruth Pruett Tate and Susan Pruett Richardson, later moved to East Ridge, Tennessee (adjacent to Chattanooga), where the remaining family reside today. He is survived by his life partner Lawrence (Larry) Hooper, his sister Ruth Pruett Tate, his life brother Ray Hooper, life sister Judy Hooper, life sister Carol Graziano, life brother Ron Graziano, many wonderful nieces and nephews, and so many fine friends and neighbors. Eddie attended schools in East Ridge and went on to Middle Tennessee State University in 1970, majoring in Music and Theatre. While there in 1971, he met his life partner, Larry Hooper (then at Austin Peay State University), and the two enjoyed both each other's company, love, and profound joys and fulfillment for almost 39 years. Eddie transferred to Austin Peay in 1972 and became a star on the Austin Peay Theatre stage, before going on to perform at Nashville's Opryland theme park. During his Opryland period, he performed in numerous park shows; was a regular on the TV show ""Music Hall America"" (which originated from Opryland); was a part of Tennessee Ernie Ford's 1974 detente-driven tour of the former Soviet Union; played the White House with the Ford troupe and danced with First Lady Betty Ford; and appeared in other Nashville productions, including a Children's Theatre production of Young Mozart, which eventually played the Kennedy Center in Washington DC. In December, 1976, Eddie and Larry moved to New York City (inspired by their dear friends, Ted and Rosemary Norris of Clarksville, Tennessee) and pursued their career dreams. Eddie's dreams landed him on Broadway in 1979, as a member of the Gaiety Quartet in Sugar Babies. During the show's 1979-1982 run on Broadway, he was also the dance captain and partner to co-star Ann Miller's Mr. Banjo Man. After the Broadway run, Eddie toured with Sugar Babies and then retired from show business in 1990. In 1993, he and Larry moved to the Green Pond lake community in Rockaway, New Jersey, where they built their dream home and over the years, hosted many dear family members, friends, and guests. It was there, on June 3, 2010, that Eddie suffered an immediately fatal heart attack that took him from Larry, leaving enormous grief but also endless fine memories. It was a life lived well and the Fates are to be thanked for their generosity toward a couple of guys lucky enough to find each other early and to be able to share so much. At Eddie's request, there will be no funeral, no formal memorial, and no requests for flowers or contributions. Friends and loved ones are asked only to remember him (and Larry) whenever gathered together -- in recognition that all we leave when we leave this life are the memories that exist in the minds of those met and loved."

2010-06-06T00:00:00Z,"When people first hear the name National Ballet of Spain, they usually assume that the distinguished company performs works like ''Swan Lake'' and ''Giselle.'' But to the Spanish, the term ballet simply means dance - in this instance, traditional Spanish dance. To discover its breadth, beauty and theatricality, one need only spend an evening at the grand Teatro de la Zarzuela (Calle de Jovellanos, 4; 34-91-524-54-00), where the company will perform from July 8 to 18. For its 30th anniversary season, the troupe (teatrodelazarzuela.mcu.es) will present an extensive program of works from the Bolero School, a type of elegant and exuberant dance popular in the 18th century. Eminent dance teachers of royalty began creating what became the Bolero School in the late 17th century, combining steps from court and regional dances. It gained so much popularity over the next 100 years that the 18th century became known as ''the century of dance teachers.'' (Goya's many paintings of dancers, in their sumptuous costumes, indicate how important it had become.) ''There's an elegance and refinement to the dances,'' said the artistic director Jose Antonio Ruiz, ''that captures the period. It's particularly refreshing now.''"
2010-06-06T00:00:00Z,"For her show ''Too Good to Be True'' at the Collette Blanchard Gallery on the Lower East Side, artist Rachel Hovnanian deals with the power and burden of beauty. Her photographs of various beauty queens (literally female trophies tops set in plaster) pose in pristine all-white scenarios- holding a bouquet in front a cabinet of donuts, perched on a bed surrounded by shopping bags from Chanel, Gucci and YSL, and standing in front of a mirror that adds pounds to the waistline. Hovnanian uses dollhouse pieces to create her maquettes of what the Texas-born artist refers to as as ''fantasy of perfect domestic life.'' Indeed, in one of the last scenes, our perfect beauty queen is passed out on a bed with empty bottles of vodka and valium. ''We feel this pressure in the media to be these perfect people, to look and act a certain way. But at the same time, we want to see the imperfections, the harsh realities. Look at at all the gossip magazines where we get to to see people off camera. We want to know it's too good to be true.'' The show runs from today through June 30th."

The boardwalk is a promenade for bikini wearers and minuscule dogs, and the piers are catnip for illegal divers. And as twilight arrives, impromptu dancing begins as musicians play on the boardwalk. At night the skyline twinkles with the colored lights of the new rides."

I just want to enjoy the ocean, the sights, the fresh fruit and enjoy being in the company of the locals! Sarah R. Adams, Spring Arbor, Mich.A.In Costa Rica, the beach communities on the Caribbean coast between the towns of Puerto Viejo and Manzanillo are an ideal surfing destination - and a cheaper alternative to the so-called Gold Coast on the Pacific side. This beautiful 11-mile stretch of coastline, south of Limon province, ''attracts disciples,'' Gisela Williams wrote in her article ''With the Surfers on Costa Rica's Untamed Coast'' (April 4, 2010). For those looking for a laid-back and untamed vibe, the Caribbean coast is a great alternative to the country's more populated and touristy Pacific coast. To get there, you can take a puddle-jumper flight from San Jose to Puerto Limon, or a shuttle bus. But the easiest way, Ms. Williams noted, is to rent a car (four-wheel-drive recommended) and drive (about four hours). She suggested Casa Viva Beach Houses (www.puntauva.net), where a one-bedroom bungalow on the beach starts at $100 a day."

Functional rash guards come in graphic Warhol era op-art, a 1950's cut gingham bikini is engineered to stay put in the worst wipeouts and board shorts are done in a vintage wallpaper pattern. Demling and Mulligan had the idea for Pret-a-Surf two summers ago while landlocked in Amagansett with a broken foot and lyme disease, respectively. Mulligan, a surf addict decided to cheer herself up by buying a board at a local shop and noticed that all the ladies surf wear looked like it was designed for an ''8 year old girl.''

2010-06-06T00:00:00Z,"Almost two dozen players will represent the U.S. men's national soccer team at the World Cup starting this month in South Africa. But years before they reached this acme, most of them confirmed their promise by playing on one or more youth national teams. So it will be no surprise if some of the elite prospects on the following pages, all of whom are U.S. youth-team members, end up playing for the U.S. at the World Cup four, eight or even a dozen years from now. To capture a glimpse of the future of American soccer, the French photographer Charles Fréger shot players who, like many in the American talent pool these days, were born abroad or whose parents were. To make his portraits, he had to visit the Netherlands -- where a group of under-20s was gathered for a tournament -- as well as Salt Lake City, Dallas and Norway. It's an itinerary that hints at another truth about American soccer talent: it's not only coming from abroad; at ever younger ages, it's also going abroad. As the coach of the under-20s recently noted, more than 200 prospects now playing in other countries would be eligible for the team at next year's U-20 World Cup. Ability and American citizenship are the criteria. As the United States becomes more serious about taking on the world at the world's game, its players are bringing more and more of the world to the American team."

''You're in this terrible Catch-22, a classic Catch-22,'' explained Mr. Medwed, a former co-director of the Second Look Project at Brooklyn Law School, who now teaches at the University of Utah. ''You know that if you proclaim your innocence at the parole hearing and remain true to yourself and true to your case then the chances of being released on parole are remote. But you also know that if I put on a good show, show some remorse, I'll have a better chance.''"

2010-06-07T18:00:23Z,"Once again Friday night's episode of ""Friday Night Lights,'' proved to be an evocative treatise on miserable parenting. Early on we see Vince scouring the empty fridge in his apartment right before the camera finds its way to the image of his mother sacked out on a bench outside. She didn't forget to pick up the milk because she is too harried; she is too strung out to remember to do it in the first place. The series checks off every category of bad mother or father: Vince's mom is an addict; Becky's mom is an obsessive too focused on the transgressions of Becky's dad to really be in the moment with her daughter. Did anybody else feel worse for Becky that her mom was screaming into the dad's voice mail during the pageant than they did over the fact that he didn't bother to show up?And how about that pageant? (I loved Becky's correcting of the M.C. -- ""It's just 'Wicked.'"") There is something so incongruous -- in a good way -- about Becky being on the beauty pageant circuit, since she is so not a Texas looker. The show hammered this home with its shots of her competitors. Her confidence -- her aggressiveness with Riggins -- is constantly at odds with her rebellious hair and unconventional prettiness, and I'm finding myself really riveted by the tension. Becky is also the first central female character to be ordinary looking. (Tyra, Julie and Lyla -- knockouts all.) And what's amazing is how self-assured she is in spite of her clearly bad family life. She knows how to perform: I like the way her confidence was contrasted with Vince's, when he is asked to deliver a speech at a pancake breakfast after a great turn in his football game. He is at a loss and further confused by J.D. McCoy's Dale Carnegie-like ease in front of an audience."

He is predeceased by his parents, Stuart A. and Genevieve M. Wade, his sister Margaret Welch, and his wife Joan Kehoe Wade. He is survived by his children Kevin, David, Jennifer (Garrity), Tim, and Laura (Farley), his eighteen grandchildren, his second wife Helen (Milne) Wade, and countless old friends and colleagues. A native of Pelham, NY, he attended Georgetown University and earned his BS in Business Administration from New York University in 1952. While working for the American Broadcasting Company in New York City he met Joan Marie Kehoe, and they were married in 1953. They settled in Chappaqua, NY, where Peter began his career as a prominent local merchant as owner of the Village Bottle Shop in Chappaqua and of the Young & Halstead Company in neighboring Mt. Kisco. While serving as a Trustee and Treasurer for the Northern Westchester Hospital Center there, he led the campaign to enlarge and expand that facility. In recognition of his talents and contributions, he was elected President of the hospital in 1977 and embarked on a second career as a hospital administrator, which he conducted with wisdom, expertise, and tireless enthusiasm until his retirement in 1990. During this time, he also served on the Board of Blue Cross-Blue Shield of Greater New York. In retirement in Pawling, Peter took on leadership roles as a member of the Quaker Hill Country Club and the parish of St. John the Evangelist Roman Catholic Church while enjoying golf, traveling, and the company of his grandchildren. We mourn his passing and rejoice in his life; we will always cherish our memories of him as a loving husband and father, a wise and tender counsel, a cheerful and doting ""Popop"", a fine and loyal friend, and as a man who valued service to his fellow man as the true measure of success. In this spirit, and in lieu of flowers, please make a contribution in his memory to the Alzheimer's Association. Viewing on June 9th from 6 to 8pm at the Horn and Thomes Funeral Home, 83 East Main St., Pawling NY.

Grandfather to Melina Celeste Brown and Barrie Kristen Brown. Beloved great-grandfather ""Papa Hymie"" to William Samuel Brown, Zoe Judith Mildred Sansted, Zachary Dakota Aloysius Sansted and Zia Eva Dora Sansted, all of Connecticut, he was also father-in-law to Judith Ann Brown of Manhattan. He was the Widow of Mildred Brown and Shirley Goodman. He was preceded in death by his parents Samuel Brown and Dora Arkis Brown who were immigrants from Odessa, Russia, His brothers Mende Brown and Nathan Brown. He also leaves behind his beloved caretaker Zulfiya Ziyakhodjaev, who gave structure, meaning, and love to his final years, his great friend and doctor Cameron Hernandez of Mt Sinai Visiting Doctors, who he admired as a doctor and loved as a friend, a neighborhood full of people who loved him, and a bustling building full of devoted staff who were more than just that to him; they looked out for him, listened to him and enabled him to remain the independent guy that he was until the very end. He was a member of the community of North Stamford, CT, where he spent every weekend and most summers for his entire life, and he leaves behind a group of friends there who have been a tremendous foundation, providing a retreat to a very intense and creative mind. He also leaves a wonderful, talented, and devoted group of actors who he has worked with for years and who have remained his loyal friends and creative inspiration throughout more years than any may want to admit. He surely joins those who left this earth before him at some heavenly table-reading, throwing a cue, joking with Zero, and listening to Mercy growl out a laugh. He grew up in the Brownsville section of Brooklyn, fluent in Yiddish, and only learned English upon his entry into public school. Steeped in music and great classics, he played violin, and excelled intellectually, while attending Boy's High School with the likes of Bugsy Seigel and The Amboy Dukes. He attended Brooklyn College and Brooklyn Law School graduating as valedictorian with a law degree in 1931, but acting was his great passion, and he already was producing and performing in live theater, Catskills revues, and on the fast growing medium of radio. Legendary creator, producer, director of radio drama, beginning in 1927 with the Hi Brow Readings, he was a one man show, often seen riding a horse in Central Park or walking the country roads of his Stamford, CT retreat while editing scripts with a red pencil, he was a mysterious figure to many but a regular guy to those that knew him. Some of his notable series include The Rise of the Goldbergs, Dick Tracy, Adventures of the Thin Man, Inner Sanctum Mysteries, Grand central Station, and the Peabody Winning CBS Radio Mystery Theater. In the 1950s he bought Players Studios at 221 West 26th Street, now Chelsea Studios, to produce his shows. He was a Founding Member of the Director's Guild of America, proud AFTRA member, a philanthropist and founder of The Radio Drama Network to propagate the spoken word, and was devoted to health care causes and the issues facing people over 50. He was a proud liberal, intellectual, art collector, and legendarily frugal. A member of the Radio Hall of Fame, Brown is the recipient of the American Broadcast Pioneer and the Peabody Award. Brown has taught audio drama at Brooklyn College and the School of Visual Arts. He has lived at the same apartment on Central Park West since 1938. He was awarded a doctorate of Humane Letters by Brooklyn College in 2003. Services will be private, The family urges that in Lieu of flowers donations be sent to the Visiting Doctors of Mt Sinai, Attn: Dr Cameron Hernandez, 5 East 102nd Street, New York, NY 10029."

The hypocrisy here is frankly hilarious, considering that the ABC program ""Grey's Anatomy"" has used the word ""douche"" not in the medical sense, but as a pejorative put-down, and a character on the 1990's ABC program ""NYPD Blue"" routinely used the word with its popular pairing, ""bag.""

As Thomas herself reportedly said in a 2002 speech, 'I censored myself for 50 years.... Now I wake up and ask myself, Who do I hate today?' Straight reporters have been taught for six decades to submerge or even smother their political and philosophical views in the workplace.

Degrading the quality of that discussion still further is the likelihood that the partisanship-averse journos haven't bothered to construct their own self-conscious political philosophy, beyond identifying Bad Guys and wanting to Fix Problems.

No doubt this is what caught the eye of the European hotel group, Accor, which restored and remodeled the property to include 144 rooms (from about $122 to $1,060), some of them split-level suites, decorated with rich red and white fabrics and Baroque- and Rococo-style furnishings."

2010-06-08T00:00:00Z,"PEARSON--Emily Feder Was born in Cluj, Transylvania/Hungary on July 4, 1914. She immigrated in 1928 with her family and was married to Samuel Pearson on December 31, 1936. In 1940 Emily lived in Brooklyn and was a neighbor of Estee Lauder, and became her first door to door makeup model. During WWII Emily sang for the USO entertaining with Rosemary Clooney and Billy Daniels. Emily supported Sam through his career in Wall Street and ultimately joined as founding partners with Jack Dreyfus in The Dreyfus Fund. In 1962 Emily dined with Eleanor Roosevelt at the request of Dr. David Gurewitsch, the Roosevelt's personal physician. Emily was asked to convince the ailing first lady to go to Switzerland to undergo cellular rejuvenation therapy (the precursor to stem cell research). Emily and Sam underwent this treatment by Dr. Paul Niehans of Vevey Switzerland and lived into their 90s. Emily and Sam contributed heavily to Robert F. Kennedy. The Senator personally wrote to thank them for helping to retire his 1964 campaign debt. With connections in the Kennedy and Nixon administrations, Emily labored to free relatives from behind the Iron Curtain, as well as fed and clothed Hungarian immigrants. Emily and Sam were Master Builders of The Albert Einstein College of Medicine, a division of Yeshiva University. Their first great-grandchild Tyler was delivered in Madison, WI by an obstetrician who was a graduate of the very same institution. They also, along with Jacob Fuchsberg (New York State Court of Appeals) were founders of the Jewish Community Center of Harrison, NY. Emily Pearson financed the start up of The MBP Company, LLC d/b/a Marron Foods, an ingredient manufacturing company headquartered in Harrison, NY with facilities in Durand and Oconomowoc, WI. The concern is the recipient of the Small Business Success Story Award from the Oshkosh College of Business, division of the University of Wisconsin. Emily's eldest son Michael passed away in 1987. She is survived by her two other sons Roger and his wife Jennifer, Matthew and his wife Ronnie. Emily is also survived by her grandchildren Daniel and his wife Billee, Ryan, Michael, Olivia, Adam and Ian. She is also survived by two great-granchildren Tyler and Jacob. Emily requested that in lieu of food and other offerings of condolence, donations be sent to The Young Israel of Harrison, New York at 207 Union Avenue, Harrison, NY 10528 to help their building program. She wanted to help erect two synagogues in her beloved home Town of Harrison, New York where she resided for 53 years. Emily Pearson's tenacity and determined perseverance insured the success of her husband and sons. She never forgot her roots and always taught her family to give back to the community and country she loved so dearly. Gravesite service will be held at Riversville Cemetery at 1pm Thursday. For further information please contact Riverside Chapel at 914-664-6800."

As a child growing up in the San Francisco Bay Area, I started visiting the California Academy of Sciences, and seeing the exhibits and aquarium are some of my earliest memories. Little did I know that I would end up working there for 28 years and counting. I was always raising tadpoles into frogs and caterpillars into butterflies, and finding scorpions on the hill behind our house. I would also go to the tide pools on the Marin coast. When I was in high school and took biology, my inspirational teacher, Gordon Chan, would take students on field trips, including to tide pool areas. I told him I had seen nudibranchs in a book about marine life, but I had never been able to find one. ''No problem,'' he said. ''I know exactly where to find them.''

In 1940 Emily lived in Brooklyn and was a neighbor of Estee Lauder, and became her first door to door makeup model. During WWII Emily sang for the USO entertaining with Rosemary Clooney and Billy Daniels. Emily supported Sam through his career in Wall Street and ultimately joined as founding partners with Jack Dreyfus in The Dreyfus Fund. In 1962 Emily dined with Eleanor Roosevelt at the request of Dr. David Gurewitsch, the Roosevelt's personal physician. Emily was asked to convince the ailing first lady to go to Switzerland to undergo cellular rejuvenation therapy (the precursor to stem cell research). Emily and Sam underwent this treatment by Dr. Paul Niehans of Vevey Switzerland and lived into their 90s. Emily and Sam contributed heavily to Robert F. Kennedy. The Senator personally wrote to thank them for helping to retire his 1964 campaign debt. With connections in the Kennedy and Nixon administrations, Emily labored to free relatives from behind the Iron Curtain, as well as fed and clothed Hungarian immigrants. Emily and Sam were Master Builders of The Albert Einstein College of Medicine, a division of Yeshiva University. Their first great-grandchild Tyler was delivered in Madison, WI by an obstetrician who was a graduate of the very same institution. They also, along with Jacob Fuchsberg (New York State Court of Appeals) were founders of the Jewish Community Center of Harrison, NY. Emily Pearson financed the start up of The MBP Company, LLC d/b/a Marron Foods, an ingredient manufacturing company headquartered in Harrison, NY with facilities in Durand and Oconomowoc, WI. The concern is the recipient of the Small Business Success Story Award from the Oshkosh College of Business, division of the University of Wisconsin. Emily's eldest son Michael passed away in 1987. She is survived by her two other sons Roger and his wife Jennifer, Matthew and his wife Ronnie. Emily is also survived by her grandchildren Daniel and his wife Billee, Ryan, Michael, Olivia, Adam and Ian. She is also survived by two great-granchildren Tyler and Jacob. Emily requested that in lieu of food and other offerings of condolence, donations be sent to The Young Israel of Harrison, New York at 207 Union Avenue, Harrison, NY 10528 to help their building program. She wanted to help erect two synagogues in her beloved home Town of Harrison, New York where she resided for 53 years. Emily Pearson's tenacity and determined perseverance insured the success of her husband and sons. She never forgot her roots and always taught her family to give back to the community and country she loved so dearly. Gravesite service will be held at Riversville Cemetery at 1pm Thursday.

2010-06-09T00:00:00Z,"A couple of weeks ago, at Bar Boulud in Manhattan, I ordered oysters. They came beautifully nestled on ice, punctuated with a scattering of pink peppercorns. Usually I enjoy my oysters plain, with no condiments. But I was curious about the peppercorns and put some on the oysters. It was a delicious combination. Earlier that day, I had tasted 20 rosés from Provence. As I began to think about food that would complement the wines, the fruity spiciness and the floral aroma of the peppercorns stuck in my mind. Not with oysters, but perhaps with translucent raw slices of fresh, seasonal, sweet fish like fluke. Along with the peppercorns, I added pink grapefruit for a modest note of bitter sweetness, and some high-toned radish slices."

2010-06-09T00:00:00Z,"ROBERTSON--Josephine (Josie) Tucker, died at her home in New York City on June 8 after a long struggle with breast cancer. The daughter of Robert and Josephine (Pimmie) Spencer Tucker, she was born May 16, 1943, in San Antonio, and graduated from Saint Mary's Hall there in 1961. She later attended Briarcliff College and graduated from the University of Texas in 1965. Before her marriage to Julian Robertson in 1972, Josie and her sister-in-law started and managed Tuckertown which designed and produced Christmas-tree ornaments which sold to leading department stores throughout the nation. Known always for her artistic talents and creativity, she collaborated with Julian to build two golf-course resorts in New Zealand. Hers was the eye behind the impeccable style of the two award-winning lodges they built near the golf courses. An avid golfer, she was the 2006 women's champion at Sebonack Golf Club in Southampton, NY. She was gifted with flowers, and loved using them while entertaining friends and family. Always gracious, lighthearted, and fun, she masked a formidable set of organizational skills which she put to work as a mother of three sons and as a volunteer in New York City. Her civic accomplishments were many. She joined the Women's Board of The Boys' Club of New York in 1978, served as its president, and in 2000 was elected to the combined board of trustees. In 2007, when she was the honoree at its annual spring dance, a group of friends raised money in her honor for the Boys' Club's Josie Robertson School of Music and Art. She also was on the Board of Overseers of Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center since 2004, a director of Classroom, Inc. from 1999 and a director of the Breast Cancer Research Foundation since 2002. In 1996, the Robertsons established the Robertson Foundation which supports education, medical research, spirituality, and environmental causes. In 1998, shortly after her breast-cancer surgery, Julian surprised Josie with a gift to Lincoln Center for the Performing Arts that named the plaza there in her honor. She and Julian were leading supporters of the Central Park Conservancy, where she joined the board of the Women's Committee in 1997. In 1998 they funded the restoration of the 59th Street Pond and its surrounding landscape. She is survived by her loving family: her husband of 38 years; son Spencer, his wife, Sarah, and their children Hollis, Hart, and Wyndham of Brooklyn; son Julian H. III (Jay) of Hawke's Bay, New Zealand; and son Alexander Tucker of Manhattan. Also surviving are two sisters, Mary Cassell of Albuquerque and Julia Rasmussen of Houston, and two brothers, Robert Tucker of San Antonio and George Tucker of Midland. She will be missed by everyone fortunate enough to have known her. Funeral will be at 11am Friday, June 11 at St. Bartholomew's Church at 325 Park Avenue, New York. Visitation will be at 11:30-2 and 5-7pm on Thursday, June 10 at Frank Campbell Funeral Home, 1076 Madison Avenue, New York.

2010-06-10T00:00:00Z,"ROBERTSON--Josephine (Josie) Tucker. Died at her home in New York City on June 8 after a long struggle with breast cancer. The daughter of Robert and Josephine (Pimmie) Spencer Tucker, she was born May 16, 1943, in San Antonio, and graduated from Saint Mary's Hall there in 1961. She later attended Briarcliff College and graduated from the University of Texas in 1965. Before her marriage to Julian Robertson in 1972, Josie and her sister-in-law started and managed Tuckertown which designed and produced Christmas-tree ornaments which sold to leading department stores throughout the nation. Known always for her artistic talents and creativity, she collaborated with Julian to build two golf-course resorts in New Zealand. Hers was the eye behind the impeccable style of the two award-winning lodges they built near the golf courses. An avid golfer, she was the 2006 women's champion at Sebonack Golf Club in Southampton, NY. She was gifted with flowers, and loved using them while entertaining friends and family. Always gracious, lighthearted, and fun, she masked a formidable set of organizational skills which she put to work as a mother of three sons and as a volunteer in New York City. Her civic accomplishments were many. She joined the Women's Board of The Boys' Club of New York in 1978, served as its president, and in 2000 was elected to the combined board of trustees. In 2007, when she was the honoree at its annual spring dance, a group of friends raised money in her honor for the Boys' Club's Josie Robertson School of Music and Art. She also was on the Board of Overseers of Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center since 2004, a director of Classroom, Inc. from 1999 and a director of the Breast Cancer Research Foundation since 2002. In 1996, the Robertsons established the Robertson Foundation which supports education, medical research, spirituality, and environmental causes. In 1998, shortly after her breast-cancer surgery, Julian surprised Josie with a gift to Lincoln Center for the Performing Arts that named the plaza there in her honor. She and Julian were leading supporters of the Central Park Conservancy, where she joined the board of the Women's Committee in 1997. In 1998 they funded the restoration of the 59th Street Pond and its surrounding landscape. She is survived by her loving family: her husband of 38 years; son Spencer, his wife, Sarah, and their children Hollis, Hart, and Wyndham of Brooklyn; son Julian H. III (Jay) of Hawke's Bay, New Zealand; and son Alexander Tucker of Manhattan. Also surviving are two sisters, Mary Cassell of Albuquerque and Julia Rasmussen of Houston, and two brothers, Robert Tucker of San Antonio and George Tucker of Midland. She will be missed by everyone fortunate enough to have known her. Funeral will be at 11am Friday, June 11 at St. Bartholomew's Church at 325 Park Avenue, New York. Visitation will be at 11:30-2 and 5-7pm on Thursday, June 10 at Frank Campbell Funeral Home, 1076 Madison Avenue, New York.

He was married for 57 years to Ruth Donenfeld Weintraub (1915-1993), to whom he was passionately devoted. Abe held a variety of jobs during his lifetime, which included chipper and caulker at the Brooklyn Navy Yard, shoe salesman, window trimmer, toy company salesman and production manager, and mail handler for the US Post Office. He retained a special interest and pride in the growth of American Business as he watched its development during the almost full century of his life. Abe is survived by his daughter Florence, sons Irwin, Joel, and Robert, six grandchildren, five great-grandchildren, his brother Sidney and sister Joyce. Always enthusiastic about life's possibilities, Abe began a pastime of running at age 80. After training with the NY Roadrunners Club, he competed in 10 New York and three London Marathons, as well as many one - 10 mile races in New York City, Falmouth, MA and Martha's Vineyard, MA. Soon after beginning to run, he expressed his goal to be the first runner over 90 to compete in the NYC Marathon, which he accomplished in 2000. Between the ages of 80 and 94 he participated in over 500 races. Through his drive and vigor, he became an inspiration and role model for both runners and non-runners alike, illustrating what could be accomplished in later years.

2010-06-11T09:54:26Z,"""The Tea Parties are a grassroots movement, and as a result, they have a lot of volunteers and a modest, but not insignificant amount of money. They'll be able to punch above their weight in states where voters expect to interact with campaigns and candidates outside of their television sets and where old-fashioned door-knocking makes a difference - I'm thinking Iowa and New Hampshire. But in the states with expensive media markets (think New York, Illinois, New Jersey, Connecticut, Maryland, and surprisingly Texas with high-cost Houston, Dallas, and San Antonio) the candidates of the Tea Parties, usually little-known newcomers to politics, will have a much harder time breaking through. The two recent West Coast primaries illustrate this distinction well: Nevada has two big cities, Las Vegas and Reno, and vast swaths of rural territory. California is famously the most expensive state in the country to campaign in; it has a huge population, is spread out all over, has some of the most expensive media markets in the country, and has an electorate whose interest in politics varies greatly. In Nevada, the Tea Party Express spent $500,000 on ads touting [Shannon] Angle, an astonishing amount of money in that state; in California, it is an exaggeration to say that a half million can be found in the petty-cash drawer of the Meg Whitman campaign, but not by that much on a campaign that spent $81 million to win the primary."""

2010-06-11T00:00:00Z,"SANSONE--Zachary, was born in Brooklyn, New York. Then at the age of twelve his family moved back to Italy. During that time, he studied at the University of Naples and obtained a degree in jurisprudence. Unfortunately, when World War II broke out he was forced to serve in the military. The horrors of war had a profound effect on him and colored his views on warfare. Zachary returned to his hometown of Sant' Antonio Abate and became extremely involved in rebuilding his town which had been ravaged by the war. Despite his hard work, the political climate at the time was not favorable to the needs of the people. Disillusioned in 1949 he left for New York where he met and married his soul mate Mary Crisalli. His wife Mary was always very active in social service work. With Zack at her side, they went on to create Congress of Italian Organizations (CIAO) in the early 60's. Their success of more than 40 years included the opening of day care, senior and social service centers throughout the city. Zack always insisted that Mary take the spotlight, he was more comfortable being the man behind the scene. Zack was her greatest advisor. Mary was the heart and Zack was the soul. In 2010 his work in Sant' Antonio finally obtained its due recognition when a committee from this town came to New York to honor his accomplishments as the first democratically elected mayor after the war. Zack was an avid reader who loved learning, however his greatest love was his wife Mary who he leaves after 61 years of marriage, his daughter Carmela, his son Ralph who predeceased him in 1986, and his two grandsons Gene-Paul and Zachary. He is survived by his sisters Giulia, Nina and Dora. Private ceremony for family only will take place tomorrow, Friday, June 11th. Zachary's wife Mary asks that you respect her privacy at this time. Please refrain from calling or visiting. Visitiation will be on Saturday, Sunday and Monday June 12, 13, and 14 from 12noon-4pm at the Sansone home at 1451-59th Street, Brooklyn, NY 11219.

We offer our loving support to Isobel, our president, and to Jennifer and the entire family. Ron will be remembered and grievously missed by many, though few of us will find language that will adequately express his profound impact. Ron was a brilliant professional, a powerful and fiercely ethical advocate, and a deeply loving husband, father, grandfather and friend. His presence in any room was at once commanding and reassuring. Ron calmly furthered consensus by offering the most thoughtful solutions with eloquence and elegance. By example, he inspired everyone else to be a better version of themselves. Through his legendary philanthropy and personal generosity, Ron also proved to be a partner and mentor to a generation of lawyers and entertainment executives. We will all miss Ron with a stubborn ache, and in place of his commanding presence, there will be a void beyond our ability to fill. We are certain he would want us to populate the empty space with those best versions of ourselves and share our lasting memories of his humor, wisdom, and great capacity for love.

Thet Sambath, a Cambodian journalist whose father and older brother were among the two million slaughtered by the Khmer Rouge, coaxes a Cambodian farmer who carried out its lethal orders to describe his method of execution. The farmer recalls in a dispassionate tone how a fellow soldier would grab the bowed head of a kneeling prisoner and wrench it back so he could slit the victim's throat. After a while, he notes, his arm would tire, and instead of slitting throats, he would simply jab in the knife."

2010-06-12T13:23:08Z,"For a second straight game, Alex Rodriguez was not in the Yankees' lineup because of tendinitis in his right hip flexor. His availability to pinch hit against the Houston Astros was not known. Rodriguez is considered day to day with the tendinitis, which is not believed to be related to the hip surgery he had in 2009. Manager Joe Girardi did not know if Rodriguez would be available as a pinch-hitter Saturday because Rodriguez did not meet with the training staff before Girardi briefed reporters. ""He's not ready to go and we'll continue to evaluate him every day and see what availability we have of him every day,"" Girardi said before the game. ""He's not a starter for us. I came to the ballpark not planning on starting him. I'll keep talking to our doctors."" Rodriguez was not available to reporters before the game. Rodriguez did not play on Friday. He had complained of tightness in his groin area and exited after the first inning of Thursday's loss at Baltimore. Rodriguez also exited early in a Yankees win over Toronto last Sunday, a day after a 14-inning loss to the Blue Jays. Asked if Rodriguez's workout regimen to warm up his surgically repaired hip might have caused the tendinitis, Girarid said: ""He didn't have a problem until we played that 14-inning game on the turf. So is it more of his workload or was it more the 14 innings on the turf, a day game after night game? If I was a guessing man, I'd guess it was the latter."" Girardi said he did not know whether Rodriguez might be used as a designated hitter when he returns. Kevin Russo was listed as the Yankees' starting third baseman on Saturday. Ramiro Pena started at third base Friday and went 0 for 3."

He missed 40 games last year with a fracture in the same thumb."
2010-06-12T13:02:29Z,"The big party that is Bonnaroo teetered on an uncharacteristic mood on Friday: introspection.

I sat next to this guy in Civil Procedure--our first year at the Harvard Law School (we were not yet 22)--taught by the bombastic Professor Richard Field and our knees knocked in unison. He became my instant friend and classmate throughout law school and thereafter, and in 1962 we started the firm then called Barovick and Konecky which became perhaps one of the foremost entertainment and sports law firms in this country and abroad. He was my partner and my friend. We would meet at the end of the day, sometimes with a drink but often not, and discuss the details of our clients' problems, potential strategies for resolving knotty issues and ....laughing. Not at or about our clients, but about the industry's foibles and absurdities, finding humor in situations others might not--laughing riotously so that even after long and trying client negotiations or problems, we could go home to our loving wives with a smile. He was a fine lawyer and a special person. I loved him and will miss him. Dick Barovick"

He was married to performer/theater producer Isobel Robins Konecky for 49 years. He was a mentor, confidant, advisor to many. A man who made the lives of all who knew him better. In addition to his love of the law, he also loved the theater and served on the board of the American Theatre Wing. He was the best husband, father, grandfather, brother and uncle ever.

In a Bucks post on Tuesday, ''The Merchants That Don't Take Cash,'' we wrote that a growing number of businesses are no longer taking cash and that those no-cash policies are legal.

2010-06-12T00:00:00Z,"JIDDA -- Roughly two years ago, Rowdha Yousef began to notice a disturbing trend: Saudi women like herself were beginning to organize campaigns for greater personal freedoms. Suddenly, there were women asking for the right to drive, to choose whether to wear a veil, and to take a job without a male relative's permission, all using the Internet to collect signatures and organize meetings and all becoming, she felt, more voluble by the month. The final straw came last summer, when she read reports that a female activist in Saudi Arabia's eastern province, Wajeha al-Huwaider, had been to the border with Bahrain, demanding to cross using only her passport, without a male chaperon or a male guardian's written permission."

2010-06-12T00:00:00Z,"9 P.M. (Showtime) ADVENTURELAND (2009) It's the summer of 1987, and James Brennan (Jesse Eisenberg) is dreaming of a post-college trek across Europe, followed by graduate school at Columbia. But his father has been demoted, so James will have to settle for working at a run-down amusement park in western Pennsylvania, the only job for which his degree in comparative literature qualifies him. Kristen Stewart, above with Mr. Eisenberg, plays James's crush, Em, a moody N.Y.U. student secretly involved with Connell (Ryan Reynolds), a married maintenance man who likes to weave bogus tales about all the famous musicians he's jammed with, most notably Lou Reed. Although Greg Mottola, who wrote and directed this comedy, is ''careful not to fetishize or lampoon the 1980s with silly hairdos or too-obvious topical references,'' A. O. Scott wrote in The New York Times, he does at times lay on ''the suburban adolescent malaise with too heavy a hand.'' Still, ''the smart, slightly depressive vibe feels just right -- for James's era and for our own as well,'' he added. ''The path to adulthood is lined with disappointment, but for a young man with an open heart and a measure of self-confidence, to say nothing of a degree in comp lit, things will most likely be O.K.'' 10 A.M.

2010-06-13T00:00:00Z,"RADNITZ--Robert B.,who entertained a generation as producer of the films Sounder, Cross Creek, Island of the Blue Dolphins and many others died June 6 at his home in Malibu, California, from complications of a stroke suffered years earlier. He was 85 years old. Radnitz's passion was stimulating the imagination of both children and adults. Parents and teachers came to recognize that his name on a motion picture ensured a creative experience that could be shared between generations. He was awarded many accolades, from eight Academy Award nominations for his films to a joint resolution honoring his work from the U.S. Congress. Born August 9, 1924, in Great Neck, Long Island, Radnitz was the only child of Fred and Lilyn Radnitz. Afflicted with asthma as a child, he was a voracious reader. A love of movies was nurtured by Saturday visits with his father to Manhattan, for at least one double feature per trip. He dreamed of bringing great literature to the screen. He enrolled at the University of Virginia due to the school's renowned curricula in English literature and drama. He became editor of the school's literary magazine, managed the drama society and founded an off-campus playhouse. After graduating, he initially stayed at the University teaching English, but ultimately decided to pursue a career in stage and film. He served an apprenticeship with legendary theatrical director Harold Clurman. Afterward, he became a stage manager at the West Hampton Playhouse and then a producer on Broadway. Noted critic Walter Kerr called his 1955 The Young and the Beautiful ""...a perfect production."" It went on to play successfully on London's West End. Feeling that his ultimate contributions would be in motion pictures, Radnitz moved to Hollywood. After a stint at United Artists, he became a story consultant for production chief Buddy Adler at 20th Century Fox. This led to the opportunity to produce his first movie, A Dog of Flanders, released in 1960. A Dog of Flanders established the pattern for most future Robert Radnitz films: a family film, based on an acclaimed novel, featuring a young person who must overcome adversity. All of his films were shot entirely on location, many using local non-actors in secondary roles. The soundtracks were often filled with indigenous music. ""No other art can match motion pictures' potential for conveying place,"" said Radnitz. ""The exposure to a new geography can be one of the great joys of movie-going."" Despite making films about and for young people, Radnitz avoided the sweet and sentimental. Critic Judith Crist of New York magazine said that Radnitz ""restores respectability to the oft abused genre of family films."" A Dog of Flanders established another pattern for Radnitz's films: awards and accolades. It won the Grand Prix Gold Lion Award at the Venice Film Festival (the first American film so honored). Over the next thirty years Radnitz produced another dozen popular motion pictures, including Misty, My Side of the Mountain, Where the Lilies Bloom, plus two television films, Mary White and Never Forget, all of which received awards and critical praise. His most honored film was Sounder, in 1972. It was nominated for a Best Picture Oscar and three other Academy Awards. It received a Special Humanitarian Award from the California State Assembly and four NAACP Image Awards, including one for Radnitz. It was also his biggest commercial success. The year Sounder was released Radnitz received his greatest tribute: becoming the first filmmaker ever honored by a joint resolution of the U.S. Congress for his body of work. Radnitz overcame his childhood asthma to become a robust adult. He swam every morning year-round in the Pacific Ocean, just steps from his Malibu home. Known as one of the best non-pro tennis players in Southern California, he held his own against members of the Pepperdine University tennis team half his age, playing nearly every day. Only wearing long pants or a tie when absolutely necessary, he was well known in the restaurants of Malibu and Hollywood in his trademark white FILA tennis outfit, arriving behind the wheel of his white convertible with the license plates ""CALM."" Asked about the plates, he would explain, ""It is a state I hope one day to achieve."" Driving that car along Pacific Cost Highway to Pepperdine one day, he spotted an attractive woman jogging. Seeing her again the next day, he pulled over to talk to her. Thus he met Pearl, who became his wife of over 20 years. Radnitz had several new projects in the works when he suffered a massive stroke in 1996 that effectively ended his career and started a long deterioration of his health. Although confined to a wheelchair, he still attended movies regularly (and expressed his opinions loudly) and still got out onto the tennis court twice weekly to return balls. He passed away Sunday night, June 6, at his Malibu home, surrounded by his devoted wife Pearl and his beloved dogs, Coco, Junior and Rosebud, finally achieving a state of calm. Radnitz had no children, but leaves behind an impressive legacy. When Radnitz received the joint resolution of Congress, Supreme Court Justice William O. Douglas paid him tribute with the words, ""The films Robert Radnitz has produced touch the common thread of humanity and that's why he's made such a great and glorious contribution to the thing that makes our society a viable, living, vibrant whole."" He will be laid to rest next to his parents in New York in a private ceremony. Plans for a memorial service in Los Angeles are pending. In lieu of flowers, Pearl Radnitz suggests friends make donations to their favorite charities in Robert Radnitz's name."

Born in New York, she attended the University of Wisconsin and graduated from New York University. She worked for over four decades, in the fashion industry, including AMC, Adrienne Vittadini, and the last fifteen years as Manager of Textile Reproductions at the Metropolitan Museum of Art. She was supportive and generous with her knowledge--she loved what she did and she loved all who knew her. No matter what she wore, she always had style--even casually, she was elegant. And as busy as she was, she always had enough time to help a friend find the right outfit, the right sofa, the right apartment. The quintessential New Yorker, she walked the city, knew every bus route, loved theatre, movies, museums, books, tennis in Central Park, bike riding in Europe. For business and pleasure, she traveled all over the world, including Chicago which she even grew to love when visiting her daughter and son-in-law and grandchildren. We will miss her wit, her perception and wisdom--and how much she loved a good laugh.

An expert on the states of consciousness and coma, he was the co-author of many books and articles on the subject.

But Israelis tend to see them as semi-powerless; they see Hamas as the rising power (especially after Hamas's victory in the Turkish flotilla war), and they understand, in ways that many Americans don't seem to understand, that Hamas poses an existential threat - you should pardon the expression - to the Palestinian Authority led by Abbas and Fayyad. ... For the typical Israeli, two events in particular have soured them on the chance for compromise. In 2000, the Israeli army pulled out of Lebanon. It was hoped that this pull-out would lead to peace on the northern border, but instead it led to rocket attacks by the Iranian-sponsored Hezbollah. In 2005, Israel unilaterally pulled its soldiers and settlers out of Gaza. Again, rockets followed ... Now, of course, the peace process, such as it is, hinges in part on an Israeli willingness to withdraw from the West Bank, including the hills of the West Bank that overlook Tel Aviv, the airport, and the entire thickly-populated central region of the country. This withdrawal will not be happening anytime soon, because there is a high degree of certainty among Israelis that a withdrawal from the West Bank hills would be followed not by peaceful reconciliation, but, again, by rockets. No Israeli wants to be a freier, a sucker, and right now the Israelis feel like suckers."""

2010-06-14T07:05:49Z,"It always seems to be the case that whatever gets hyped in the press will be undermined by reality in the coming days. Anytime the Dutch play, there is talk of Cruyff and Total Football and the sheer ecstatic beauty of the game. Talk of angels, Picasso and improbable genius shortly follow. And then there was today's effort: a pedestrian affair by any account. The Netherlands clearly miss the creativity and dynamism created by winger Robben who is a one man whirling dervish out there. Without his fervor the midfield did not have the options up front. Van Persie had maybe one stellar chance all game? It wasn't until late in the second half with the substitutions of the youngsters Afellay and, in particular, Elia on the left flank, that things started to open up and traces of the Dutch flair could be spotted. So let's hold off on any more talk of Total Football until we actually see it from the starting lineup."

2010-06-14T00:00:00Z,"The layout and location of the Pebble Beach Golf Links, site of this week's United States Open, can bring about some unusual rules situations, specifically because the course has holes that abut what is arguably the largest lateral water hazard in the world (i.e., the Pacific Ocean). For example, this week players may choose to drop a ball in a dropping zone outside of a bunker instead of in a bunker when taking relief under the water hazard Rule (Rule 26). The long bunker to the left of the 18th fairway at Pebble Beach is immediately adjacent to the ocean. If a player's ball last crossed the margin of the lateral water hazard adjacent to this long bunker, the player may play the ball as it lies in the lateral water hazard, play a ball from where he played his previous shot, drop a ball in the bunker within two club lengths of the point where his ball last crossed the margin of the hazard or drop a ball in the nearest dropping zone that is not nearer the hole than the point where the ball last crossed the margin of the hazard."

2010-06-14T00:00:00Z,"Maybe it's the color drawings that look like regular golfers I have known. Maybe it's the thick paper that reminds me of my old grade school projects. Maybe it's the simplicity of the tasks and the guidance offered, but I have always loved the Private Lessons section at the back of Golf Magazine. Four years ago, a collection of the most insightful lessons culled from the magazine through the decades was published. This year, new material has been added in the revised edition, ''Private Lessons: The Best of the Best Instruction.'' (Abrams Books) It's a hefty tome, more than 300 pages and shaped like a textbook, but inside are the handy, digestible tips with the accurate, familiar illustrations. The lessons are separated into chapters with titles like course management, the mental game and specialty short game shots. If searching for a golf-related Father's Day gift, ''Private Lessons'' will be more helpful than a dozen golf balls - and last considerably longer as well."

It assumes that developed countries cannot cut down on consumption.""  But ""Last Generation?"" isn't a piece about overpopulation or environmental destruction, and it makes no assumptions about whether developed countries can cut down on consumption.  It just isn't about that question at all.  It asks a deeper question, one not dependent on the environmental constraints on our planet, nor on the number of people now on Earth.  Even if there were only 1 million humans on this planet, all living at the level of an average citizen of, say, Switzerland, we could still ask whether it would be a good thing to have children in order to continue the species."

I was going to a theater opening on a recent evening and just didn't feel like sporting my usual ""tie slightly undone/white shirt open at the neck/sport jacket"" combo. I rummaged through my bureau looking for who knows what, when I came across a stack of faded-print cotton bandannas (the nostalgic cowboy kind). Perfect! If the Parisians can pull off their origami-like mastery of the scarf, why can't I give it a try? I first folded it in half to make a triangle, then rolled it up tightly, à la Fruit Roll-Up. I wrapped it snugly around my neck and tied a small, tight knot in front, tucking the ends into my shirt. I instantly felt dressier, more suitable for the special evening I had in store. Any slight apprehension I had about winning a Charles Nelson Reilly look-alike contest was quickly assuaged when I received some very nice, unexpected compliments. Since then, I've been on the hunt for vintage bandannas so I can give my well-worn neckties a break."

Green and Lillian R. Green. He loved language and the written word, graduating from Dartmouth University with a B.A. in English, and he was passionate about music. An accomplished pianist who was once invited to tour with Blood, Sweat and Tears, Bill rejoiced in the sound, the study, and the playing of cutting-edge jazz, so much so that he was once arrested at an underground Hartford jazz club that catered to mixed-race couples. He loved his job as a scientific writer and editor at the NYU Hospital for Joint Diseases, and he took great pride in it. He also loved New York City, the Mets, the latest computer technology, and humor, especially puns. He did what he loved, succeeded at it, and shared his passions with everyone around him. Most of all he loved his family. He is survived by his daughters, Betse Green and Nicole Green-Hilgen, sons-in-law Bill Cernansky and Sorin Hilgen; grandchildren Jason and Justin Ramirez, Jan and Grace Hilgen; and his closest friends, Sally Frenkel and Jack Ricci. A memorial service will be held in New York City on Friday, June 18.

For 35 years, Dr. Plum served as neurologist-in-chief and chairman of the Department of Neurology and Neuroscience at Cornell University Medical College and New York Hospital -- today known as NewYork-Presbyterian Hospital/Weill Cornell Medical Center. He was known nationally and internationally as a true pioneer in the study of the metabolism of the brain as it relates to traumatic head injury, stroke and coma. A renowned researcher, Dr. Plum was author and editor of more than 250 neurology publications and was founder and chief editor of the highly regarded Annals of Neurology from 197684. In collaboration with Dr. Bryan Jennett on a paper published in The Lancet in 1972, Dr. Plum originated the term ""permanent vegetative state"" to describe the type of unconsciousness that can follow serious brain injury or illness. Dr. Plum was a tireless advocate for the rights of terminally ill patients, promoting the use of living wills that ensured carrying out the end-of-life wishes for patients unable to communicate due to traumatic brain injury. Dr. Plum was a beloved teacher at Cornell University Medical College and trained a generation of neurologists who are today spread around the globe. A former student remarked, ""Dr. Plum imparted a flash of insight to his students which represented a genius that placed him far beyond his peers. You quickly realized you were in the presence of a great mind."" We offer our heartfelt condolences to his wife, Susan; his two sons Michael and Christopher; and his daughter, Carol. Antonio M.

It does not take a student of European politics to know which way Europe's political elites are likely to go. The plan being discussed is extraordinary. Like gamblers increasingly obsessed with the idea that their string of mounting losses will eventually pay off with an even bigger win, the European chiefs in Brussels are convinced that if they just double down one more time on their integration project, they will finally achieve victory ... Until a few months ago Jean-Claude Trichet was insisting, like the Duke of Wellington on the English constitution, that the euro was more or less perfect. Now, he is calling for a new 'budgetary federation' to keep the project afloat. ... In theory, the only way of ensuring stability within monetary union, as most economists will tell you, is to go for full-fledged fiscal union. In other words, to make the Greek budget a section of the budget for the whole eurozone. So Greece could nestle safely in the harbour of German taxpayers' vast funds. But in the case of the eurozone, such a fiscal union is likely to result only in deeper economic peril, social unrest and political disarray. And it would mark an almost complete repudiation of what the euro was supposed to stand for when it was hatched almost 20 years ago."""

Ms. Perry secured the rights to the photo, which appeared on the cover of Esquire, from Mr. Fischer himself.

Not sawdust -- though we make lots of that, too -- but perfectly good chunks of cherry, walnut, mahogany, oak and maple. We toss several hundred dollars' worth in the Dumpster every week. There are many things we could be making with our scraps. The pieces range from 12 inches to 36 inches long, they are usually 4 to 14 inches wide, and 1 to 3 inches thick. Here's a few things we could easily make: cutting boards, toys, chess sets, jewelry boxes, expensive pens, chop sticks, backgammon boards, picture frames, baseball bats, forks and spoons, turned bowls, trophy bases, etc., etc. Beautiful, valuable things that people pay good money for every day.

2010-06-17T00:00:00Z,"There are certain to be consequences if New York State introduces no-fault divorce, as now seems likely. The divorce rate might climb. Matrimonial battles will focus on bitter issues like support and child custody. The poor will be able to get divorced as easily as the rich. But there is something else. Those who are splitting up can just tell the truth. For decades, New York State's divorce system has been built on a foundation of winks and falsehoods. If you wanted to split quickly, you and your spouse had to give one of the limited number of allowable reasons -- including adultery, cruelty, imprisonment or abandonment -- so there was a tendency to pick one out of a hat."

2010-06-17T00:00:00Z,"Recently, someone asked me why women don't support each other in business. The question threw me because it presumed a fact that seemed dubious at best -- and completely contrary to the reality I've experienced, both personally and through the stories I've written about women who own businesses. The ''cat fight'' narrative might draw viewers to reality TV shows and romantic comedies, but it's not helpful to the female business owner eager to learn from and share with her peers. Earlier this week, I visited the inaugural gathering of Sharp Skirts, an online and offline community of women who own a wide range of businesses -- or who aspire to become their own bosses. Sharp Skirts was founded by Carla Thompson, a former Silicon Valley marketing executive and Austin transplant. ''I got tired of reading articles that asked where the women entrepreneurs were,'' said Ms. Thompson. ''I was surrounded by them and knew they had an abundance of skills to share.''"

2010-06-17T00:00:00Z,"O.K., here's my deal with Twitter. Personally, I have a hard time doing anything in 140 characters or less. Maybe it's a difference of the sexes thing. Research tells us more men than women are on Twitter while the Facebook community (which offers free-flowing prose if you choose) is heavier in estrogen. No surprise there really. Men tend to be bottom-liners and women seem to enjoy talking about their experiences more. As a marketing person, I know Twitter works great as a traffic-driving tool for lots of restaurants and retail stores (online and off), including Birds Barbershop, which is one of the small businesses in Austin that clearly knows what it's doing on Twitter. Last week it was raining (a relative oddity here), and business was a little slow, so Ashley Cass, who manages Birds' social media, posted a three-hour, 25-percent rain discount at one of the Austin locations and got lots of takers immediately. Whole Foods, another Austin company, is great at engaging its customers (two million Twitter followers), listening to and answering their questions in 140 keystrokes."

From running my own business and observing many others, I have learned that companies have their strengths and weaknesses and the strengths often feed the weaknesses. It is much easier to see this from the outside. People tend to do what they are good at doing and what they like doing. That does not necessarily mean they are doing what is best for the company."

For years, before the couple packed for the beach or a cruise, Ms. Bryce shaved her husband's back with a razor in the shower.

And the putt on No. 18 that cost him a victory at the 2009 British Open ended up short and to the right of the hole; he did not yank it, which suggests it was long and to the left."

And few shops in Europe are more faithfully dedicated to heirloom denim and classic work wear than the new Stockholm shop Mr. Mudd and Mr. Gold. The name alone, taken from a Townes Van Zandt classic, is like Carhartts incarnate. The shop, in Södermalm, the city's answer to Brooklyn and the only party of town that could be called gritty, is outfitted almost entirely in unfinished knotty pine boards; they line the walls and form blocky benches and tables for merchandise that includes Mr. Freedom work shirts, Quoddy moccasins, Pendleton blankets and Wesco motorcycle boots. And true to the cult of craftsmanship, the narrative behind every company the store does business with is highlighted on its Web site. The expertly focused selection of brands includes plenty of international origin - canvas satchels from Brady Bags of England, founded in 1877; Grunden rain gear (Sweden, 1926); jeans by The Real McCoy's (Japan, 1990) - but the effect is nonetheless a mashup of styles that feels unmistakably American.

Although the bloodletting has ebbed, Kyrgyzstan, an obscure central Asian country that houses American and Russian military bases, remains in serious danger of fragmenting. The provisional Kyrgyz government has lost control of large areas in the southern part of the country because of its failure to quell attacks that have killed at least several hundred ethnic Uzbeks, and possibly many more.

2010-06-18T15:39:48Z,"I am not a soccer fan, particularly. I hated playing the game as a kid, I'm easily exasperated by the ties and the low scoring and the penalty-kick finales, and I loathe what Jonathan Last calls ""the ritual attack of the soccer scolds"" every World Cup season. (Also, I had college roommates - and dear friends - who insisted on referring to the game as ""football,"" even though they were Americans going to college in America, for crying out loud.) But today's United States-Slovenia match was a beautiful, remarkable, riveting thing to watch - and a game seemingly perfectly engineered, in its stakes and scoring and sudden reversals, to hoist me on my own soccer-hating petard."

2010-06-18T15:38:30Z,"""In some ways, the Napoleonic Wars seem very alien to us. Americans are, mostly, used to short and simple wars. Our three greatest military conflicts - the Civil War, World War One and World War Two - were relatively short. After some initial setbacks, victory came relatively swiftly; we never suffered the shattering setbacks that drove the British out of Europe during the Napoleonic wars as coalition after coalition went down to defeat .... The Cold War was the longest and most complex international contest in which the United States has ever engaged as a leading protagonist, and that conflict was less intense and less complicated than the Anglo-French conflict of 1792-1815 ... But ever since the end of the Cold War, the world has been trending back toward the kind of kaleidoscopic politics of 18th and 19th century Europe and away from the more stable configurations of the late twentieth century. With no single great power threat to the world order currently on stage and a variety of issues agitating international politics, many countries are exploring new options and testing new partners. While the world hopefully is not on the road to another global conflict on a Napoleonic scale anytime soon, Americans need to prepare for an era of changing coalitions and individualistic and prickly great and middle powers seeking to elbow their way onto center stage."""

Once upon a time, a pitcher would have considered himself fortunate to escape Coors Field with a performance like that, but for Jimenez, the Rockies' 26-year-old ace, it was a blemish that raised his earned run average above 1.00 for the first time in nearly two months. Even in what's shaping up to be the year of the pitcher, Jimenez is standing out. In addition to the no-hitter he tossed on April 17, he leads the majors in wins (he now has 13 after his victory over the Twins on Thursday afternoon) and his 1.15 E.R.A., if it continues, would be the lowest since Bob Gibson posted a 1.12 mark during the notoriously offense-starved 1968 season."

(HBO) HARRY POTTER AND THE HALF-BLOOD PRINCE (2009) In this sixth chapter in the eight-part film series, new dangers lurk for Dumbledore (Michael Gambon), above, and especially Harry (Daniel Radcliffe) after he is commissioned to destroy Voldemort, played in his youth by Hero Fiennes-Tiffin (a nephew of Ralph, who portrays the evildoer's adult incarnation) and Frank Dillane (the son of the actor Stephen). Writing in The New York Times, Manohla Dargis called Mr. Gambon invaluable and Alan Rickman (as Prof. Severus Snape) sensational, but said that Mr. Radcliffe, Rupert Grint (Ron) and Emma Watson (Hermione) had ''grown up into three prettily manicured bores.'' This film series ''has begun to show signs of stress around the edges, a bit of fatigue, or maybe that's just my gnawing impatience,'' she wrote. ''Not that the director, David Yates, doesn't keep things moving and flying and soaring, his cameras slashing through the gloom that has settled onto this epic endeavor like a damp, enveloping fog and at times threatened to snuff out its joy as terminally as a soul-sucking Dementor.'' 10:30 A.M.

Barton of Texas in support of BP underscored the potential peril for lawmakers forced to respond to crises involving industries vital to their regions, and whose bountiful donations finance their political campaigns.

I spoke with several employment lawyers around the country, and here's what I found.The lawyers I talked to weren't aware of any federal laws that specifically stated that lying about your salary when applying for a private-sector job is illegal.

She continued, ""When I say to you, there is nobody like me, and there never was, that is a statement I want every woman to feel and make about themselves."" Apparently, even though she loves men - she hails them! - she is a little bit of a feminist because she exemplifies what it looks like for a woman to say, and to believe, that there's nobody like her."

2010-06-20T00:00:00Z,"Q.My fiance and I are thinking about honeymooning in Croatia in August. We'd like some time on the beaches and to do some exploring. Can you suggest a 10-day itinerary and luxurious (not exorbitant) hotels? Michelle Marcus, New YorkA.With its Roman ruins, medieval castles and gorgeous coastline, Croatia is an ideal honeymoon destination. Fly to Zagreb (above) and allow a couple of days to explore that lovely city before you head to the coast. Read Alex Crevar's ''36 Hours in Zagreb'' (Sept. 6, 2009), for sightseeing, dining and lodging suggestions. Walk or take the tram to the Upper Town neighborhoods, where historic buildings and churches are concentrated, and then walk to the Zagreb City Museum (mgz.hr), which offers a look at the city's political, architectural and artistic history. Next, walk around the pedestrian-only Tkalciceva Street, jammed with cafes and boutiques, and stop at Ivica i Marica, a restaurant and patisserie offering traditional desserts. On your second day, head to the Lower Town, which is dominated by a ''green horseshoe'' of parks and is home to the Academy of Sciences and Art, the National Theater and the Botanical Gardens. For lodging, Mr. Crevar suggested Hotel Dubrovnik (www.hotel-dubrovnik.hr; 130 euros, or $155 at $1.17 to the euro, for a double), with a great location: one of its buildings overlooks the cafe-packed Jelacic Square."

Mr. Leutwyler photographed the items prior to Mr. Jackson's death in 2009, forgoing visual trickery and relying instead on a plain black background. Many of the images point to the otherwordly realm the star inhabited; others, such as an ordinary tube sock studded with rhinestones, bring him heartbreakingly down to earth. This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print."

2010-06-20T00:00:00Z,"What does exercise do to your body? It may seem as if science, medicine and common sense answered that question long ago. But in fact the precise mechanisms by which exercise alters your body -- at a deep, molecularlevel -- remain poorly understood. A number of analyses of the effect that exercise has on heart disease, for instance, have concluded that working out lessens a person's chances of developing heart problems far more than scientists can account for. They understand the physiological reasons for about 60 percent of the reduced risk. The rest is a mysterious if welcome bonus. But a new study that gauged the metabolic effects of exercise may significantly advance our understanding of what's going on inside a body in motion. During the experiment, scientists actually saw how much being fit changes your ability to incinerate fat, moderate blood sugar and otherwise function well. They also uncovered proof, at once inspiring and cautionary, of just how complicated and pervasive exercise's consequences are."

2010-06-20T00:00:00Z,"With the World Cup games in South Africa just days away, soccer balls aren't the only things spinning out of control. The New York City artist Kehinde Wiley's ''Africa Lifestyle'' sneakers and sports apparel for Puma are creating their own brand of hysteria. Puma has been supplying African soccer teams with uniforms since 1997, when it signed on with Cameroon. Wiley's own partnership with the brand began two years ago with a commission to capture the spirit of the game through life-size paintings of Africana footballers like Samuel Eto'o of Cameroon, John Mensah of Ghana and Emmanuel Eboue of Ivory Coast. The paintings have been touring the globe with pit stops in Paris, London, New York, Beijing, Tokyo, Milan and Johannesburg, where they will land just in time for next week's kickoff. Wiley, 33, whose name means ''second born'' in Yoruba, was raised in Los Angeles by an African-American mother and a Nigerian father and says this project has been like ''a coming-out party.'' The spirited collection includes bomber jackets, T-shirts, leggings, laces and particularly eye-catching patterned kicks like ''Tekkies Heroic Sisters.'' Wiley calls this initiative his response to ''street branding,'' in which a fondness for abstraction, West African art and ''veritable wax'' fabrics from Dakar and Lagos merge onto lively footwear that echoes contemporary African tribal markings. According to Antonio Bertone, Puma's chief marketing officer, the raw canvas for each additional collection will be sourced directly from Africa. In the meantime, keep an eye out for more items debuting this fall, including the Kehinde Puffa and the unisex 4M Mix high-top sneakers."

She chaired the Second District of Greenwich's Representative Town Meeting. She raised five children and nourished 12 grandchildren, three great-grandchildren, and two husbands. All in only 88 years. Sally Schilthuis Johnson Whipple, who died June 16 of complications of Alzheimer's, was the first of three formidable daughters of the late Willem and Sally Schilthuis. Born September 10, 1921, in New York City, she attended Friends Seminary, The Thomas School and Sarah Lawrence College. In 1943 she married Robert L. Johnson, Jr., who then was sent to the Pacific with the U.S. Navy for the duration of World War II. When Bob returned, they moved to Wynnewood, PA, where they raised their two sons and three daughters while Bob commuted to Philadelphia as an editor of The Saturday Evening Post. In 1962, when the Post transferred its editorial offices to New York City, Sally and family moved to Greenwich. Bob died in 1970, and Sally devoted her time to helping raise grandchildren, taking college courses, and volunteering for Greenwich charities. Surprised by a ""Vote for Sally Johnson for the RTM"" sign (posted by a friend), she was elected, and shortly was voted Chairman of the Second District. In 1994 she married widower A.B.C. Whipple, with whom she traveled from Nantucket to Virgin Gorda and Bermuda to Holland, where she kept in touch with her many Dutch cousins. Sally is survived by her sons Robert L. Johnson, III (and wife Patricia) of Houston, TX, Peter Johnson (and wife Connie) of Scottsdale, AZ, her daughters Linda Johnson Parker (and husband Richard) of Auburn, CA, Sally Johnson Wilkinson (and husband Geoffrey) of Milton, MA, and Carol Johnson Wynn (and husband Thomas) of Bristol, VT, plus her sister Pamela Rossbach (and husband Laurence) of North Haven, NY, those dozen grandchildren, three great-grandchildren, and her second husband, ""Cal"" Whipple, a former editor at LIFE Magazine, all of whom will never forget the grand and lovable lady who graced their lives. A celebration of her life will be held at St. Catherine of Sienna Church in Riverside at 11:00am on June 28th."

And there were no high-end celebrities for the 100th anniversary of the Brooklyn Botanic Gardens on June 7. The stars of the evening were the gardens, including a new herb garden. The 450 guests wore their own clothes and their own jewelry -- unlike the extravagantly dressed guests at many of the high profile events, who migrate from Palm Beach to their summer homes in the Hamptons. The Brooklyn attendees reflected a very American style of dress for a major event. It reminded one of garden parties in Newport, R.I.; Rumson, N.J., and Philadelphia. Flower prints were a favorite, as was the occasional picture hat."

I say this not as a salesman but as a dyed-in-the-wool middle-class consumer. I'm waiting in line at a fast-food restaurant while a coupon fight goes on in front of me, delaying me from my sweet, sweet weekly communion with a Southern Style Chicken Biscuit. No, the coupon does not say that you are entitled to a free iced latte. You show it to me as if I'm your lawyer, and it states plainly, ''A free cup of coffee.'' And, no, they are not the same thing."
2010-06-20T00:00:00Z,"Al Kaline, a Hall of Fame outfielder for the Detroit Tigers, retired in 1974 with a career batting average of .297, 3,007 hits, 399 home runs and 1,583 runs batted in. Kaline, 75, now a special assistant to the Tigers' president, Dave Dombrowski, was in Manhattan in May. He accepted the Vin Scully Lifetime Achievement Award in Sports Broadcasting on behalf of Ernie Harwell, the longtime Tigers broadcaster who died just before the presentation. The award is sponsored by WFUV, Fordham University's radio station. Q. You never played in the minor leagues. Do you think other players are capable of making that jump?A. There's a financial issue today. You bring a player up too soon, he can play out his option and go someplace else just when he's becoming a star. He can leave the team that has groomed him and gave him money. When I played, you were owned outright by the club until a team traded you or released you.Q. Who was the toughest pitcher you faced?A. One pitcher who gave me a lot of trouble was Frank Sullivan with the Red Sox. He wasn't by any sense of imagination a great pitcher, but he was a big, tall sidearmer. I never got hits off him. When I was a real good player, Bob Lemon and Early Wynn were tough on me, too. Then when I got older, 38, 39, Nolan Ryan was tough."

Ariel Levy's profile of Huckabee, in this week's New Yorker, lines up plenty of reasons why this might be flat wrong, from Huckabee's proven inability to raise money or organize a ground game, to his perpetually-simmering war with the conservative establishment, to his tendency to self-pigeonhole (his protests to the contrary notwithstanding) as the candidate of Southern evangelicals and only Southern evangelicals. (There's also the fact that he might just be happier as a well-compensated entertainer than as a politician.) But Levy also captures many of the qualities that make Huckabee more formidable than many handicappers acknowledge: His immense charm and ""relentless niceness,"" his intense bond with one of the G.O.P.'s largest constituencies, his high favorable numbers among Republican voters and his strength in early polls. And, of course, his ability to appear on any TV show, any time and anywhere, and charm the socks off the audience."

In today's post, I will leave all whimsy aside, and show you that the universe we inhabit is stranger that our fictitious imaginings. Today we will explore a fundamental and almost unbelievable result of Quantum Mechanics (QM) through a set of simple puzzles. This famous result is ""Bell's Interconnectedness Theorem"" which was discovered by the physicist John Stewart Bell in 1964. Bell's theorem has been called by physicist Henry Stapp ""the most profound discovery of Science."" It is profound because it shows that the universe has the property of non-locality: two particles can be light years apart, yet they are linked to each other instantaneously. How instantaneously? Recent measurements have shown that this phenomenon occurs more than 10,000 times the speed of light! In order to show that the universe in non-local, Bell showed that a certain simple and obvious inequality - Bell's inequality - is violated. Amazingly, the only math that you need to understand this profound inequality is contained in the following simple problem."

2010-06-22T09:38:23Z,"""If I were to put a dress on, I wouldn't look like a woman,"" says Sophie Hicks. ""I'd look like a man in drag."" The sternly chic British architect began wearing mannish suits as a fashion editor at glossies like Tatler and British Vogue. Then, in the late 1980s, she quit her editorial job and went to architecture school. Sure, high fashion frustrated her. (Madonna, at the very last moment, once bailed on a big photo shoot that Hicks had dreamed up with Azzedine Alaïa.) But Hicks's concerns about the industry went deeper. ""I was only 26, and I started seeing fashion go in circles,"" she says, noting that the legends she worked alongside - like Grace Coddington - ""must have seen the same things go around 12 dozen times."" Hicks's biography has fabulous footnotes: She appeared in a Fellini film (""Intervista,"" in 1986), designed a Picasso exhibit for the Royal Academy of Arts, and made a perfume bottle for Paul Smith. Her most famous buildings are, perhaps predictably, fashion boutiques. She has designed shops for Yohji Yamamoto in Paris, Paul Smith in London and 100 or so Chloé stores, including flagships in Tokyo, New York and Hong Kong. Today, she's at work on a small home in South Kensington. For that building, she's invented a ""geometric building block"" with the British brick maker Ibstock. ""It's a bit like mesh,"" she says of the partially translucent brick. ""So you'll get little glimpses of what's going on outside."""

Born in Birmingham, Alabama 69 years ago, Charles grew up amid the civil rights campaigns of the 1960s. Some of his principles came from his father, John, who in the 1950s led African-American workers against brutal opposition in a long battle for equal pay at the Birmingham News. Charles had unionism, equality and integrity in his DNA. Growing up in Birmingham as the youngest of four children, Charles learned the importance of individual goals and group goals as well. He graduated from Parker High, then the largest black high school in the country, and went on to attend Howard University in Washington, DC, where Stokely Carmichael was a fellow classmate and his instructors included some of the nation's top black professors such as E. Franklin Frazier, Bernard Fall, and Donald McHenry who went on to become the Ambassador to the UN under President Jimmy Carter. Charles Ensley and his wife Annette moved to New York in 1965. He became a caseworker in the Bureau of Child Welfare Bedford-Stuyvesant office and also worked on the side tutoring kids in Harlem and educating welfare rights groups. In 1982, after a hotly contested election, with more than 70% of the vote, he became President of Local 371 and began demanding more democracy and financial accountability in the union. Ensley was an innovative, independent leader with high integrity. He had an amazing sense of humor and a quick wit. He fought with vigor and intelligence and was proud of winning dignity and job protections for his members and never waivered in his steadfast determination to pursue a progressive agenda. He believed that diversity is a major source of the strength of the Union. Black, White and Latino, men and women - blue collar and professional the common ground is the union and defense of the rights of every single member. Under his leadership as a tough negotiator Local 371 became the ""Mighty, Mighty Union"" and membership grew from 9,000 to 17,000 members. He received numerous awards for his work, among them the prestigious Ellis Island Medal of Honor in 2001. He served on a number of Boards, including the AFSCME International Executive Board. Ensley who lived on the Upper West Side of Manhattan enjoyed jazz, theatre, and reading that ranged from Russian literature to the French existentialists, with a particular interest in black history and the development of the black novel. He was a collector of black art and surrounded himself with some of the well known and lesser-known artists from around the world. Ensley is survived by his wife, Annette Ensley; his sister, Barbara Jean Ensley; his two nephews, Bradley Joel Funnye, Clarence Del Monte Funnye, a niece, Imani Austin; and cousins in Portland, Oregon, Denver, Colorado and Austin, Texas. His parents, John and Gladys Ensley, his sister, Mary Elizabeth Goldson and brother John Ensley preceded him in death. Ensley requested that there be no funeral or memorial services. He asked that everyone, particularly Local 371 members, use time, energy and resources in maintaining the Mighty, Mighty Union."

She brought beauty into the world and shared it with those around her. Born in Brooklyn, and a long-time resident of Roslyn and Sagaponack, she was an avid New Yorker who appreciated and relished the best the city had to offer. She was a woman of great style. She had a vibrant and keen intellect, was an avid reader, and was wonderfully articulate. An accomplished Life Master bridge player, a devotee of music, art, and books, an early and strong advocate for women's rights, civil rights, and social justice, she gave her deepest love to her family - her ""proudest achievement."" She is survived by her family who loved her deeply: her husband of 63 years, Alvin Silverman; her children, Barbara Berke, Andrew Silverman and his wife, Molly Paul, and Nancy Silverman and her husband, Benjamin Nathans; her sister Adelaide Wells and brother Allan Bakst and their families; and her eight grandchildren (Jessica, Sally, Jennifer, Nicholas, Will, Gabriel, Ilana and Dora) and two great-grandchildren (Caroline and Emily).

Our usual pattern is to start to stir at 4 a.m., getting the fire going for breakfast (usually sticky rice or noodle soup). Several of us look over the maps and determine what areas to cover as well as which teams will go where. We try to be on our way early in the morning because our best chance of finding monkeys is when they are active. Doucs do not vocalize as frequently as other primates, so we rarely detect them by their calls. Generally, we hear leaves moving as animals jump from one branch to another; so if we are quiet, patient, and lucky enough to be nearby when they are moving, we are able to find groups."

2010-06-22T00:00:00Z,"10 P.M. (13, 49) WILLIAM KUNSTLER: DISTURBING THE UNIVERSE (2009) As children, Emily and Sarah Kunstler idolized their father, William, below, who had marched with Martin Luther King Jr. and defended the Chicago Seven and American Indians protesting at Wounded Knee, S.D. But as teenagers they grew increasingly disenchanted as he chose to represent terrorists and rapists and even embraced John Gotti in front of the courthouse press corps. ''P.O.V.'' begins its 23rd season with this documentary, in which the sisters try to reconcile their father's past with the wild-haired, media-hungry man -- who liked to compare himself to Michelangelo's statue of David -- they knew in their youth. Writing in The New York Times, Stephen Holden called the film ''a refresher course on the history of American left-wing politics in the 1960s and '70s as well as an affectionate personal biography of Kunstler.'' He added, ''Although the film, with its home movies and family reminiscences, portrays him as a heroic crusader for justice, it is by no means a hagiography of a man who earned widespread contempt late in his career for defending pariahs.'' 8 P.M.

She brought beauty into the world and shared it with those around her. Born in Brooklyn, and a long-time resident of Roslyn and Sagaponack, she was an avid New Yorker who appreciated and relished the best the city had to offer. She was a woman of great style. She had a vibrant and keen intellect, was an avid reader, and was wonderfully articulate. An accomplished Life Master bridge player, a devotee of music, art, and books, an early and strong advocate for women's rights, civil rights, and social justice, she gave her deepest love to her family - her ""proudest achievement."" She is survived by her family who loved her deeply: her husband of 63 years, Alvin Silverman; her children, Barbara Berke, Andrew Silverman and his wife, Molly Paul, and Nancy Silverman and her husband, Benjamin Nathans; her sister Adelaide Wells and brother Allan Bakst and their families; and her eight grandchildren (Jessica, Sally, Jennifer, Nicholas, Will, Gabriel, Ilana and Dora) and two great-grandchildren (Caroline and Emily). We will all miss her greatly and will cherish her memory forever.

(SNY) JERRY SEINFELD CALLS THE NEW YORK METS Mr. Seinfeld, below, will join the Mets announcers Gary Cohen and Keith Hernandez in the SNY broadcast booth for at least three innings as the team takes on the Detroit Tigers at Citi Field -- a Father's Day gift from Mr. Seinfeld's wife, Jessica, to fulfill her husband's longtime dream. It's a reunion, sort of. In 1992 Mr. Hernandez guest starred in a two-part ''Seinfeld'' episode called ''The Boyfriend,'' in which he asked Jerry to move the furniture while he wooed Elaine. In a subplot, when Kramer and Newman accused Mr. Hernandez of spitting on them after a Mets game, Jerry came to his hero's defense by devising a ''second-spitter'' theory. The role, which occurred after Mr. Hernandez's retirement from baseball, ''gave me a second shelf life, it's just incredible,'' he recently told Ken Belson of The New York Times. But he refuses to watch the episode ''because I thought I stunk.'' Now, he has a question for Mr. Seinfeld: What did you really think of my performance on the show? Tune in for the answer. 6 P.M.

It has always allowed some types of food into Gaza; the latest change will lift restrictions that were in place on some foodstuffs."

Mr. Bond was also active in Masonic-related orders, including the Royal Arch Masons, in which he served as state-wide Grand High Priest in 1979; the Knights Templar, where he served as Commander of Ontario Commandery in 1975; and the Ancient and Accepted Scottish Rite, under whose jurisdiction Mr. Bond was awarded the 33rd degree in 1977. Following his tenure as Grand Master, Mr. Bond was appointed to the office of Grand Lecturer in 1988, an office which gave him the opportunity to travel to Masonic lodges across the state. Mr. Bond struck an imposing and impressive figure, as his height and his distinctive voice gave authority and drama to his educational presentations. He retired as Grand Lecturer in 1999. Mr. Bond was a graduate of State University College at Oswego, and worked as a controller and accountant at Cyclotherm Corporation and the Crane Company, in mid-state New York. He retired from Oswego Package Boiler Company in 1980, and became a private financial and management consultant, while devoting the bulk of his time to Masonic activities.

Artichokes contain cynarin, a compound with an oddly sweet aftertaste that can distort the flavor of wine, especially red.

It was made with just the fleshy hearts and stems, roasted in a wood oven and slathered with garlic butter, cheese and bread crumbs."

Mr. Fleming, who was raised in Cincinnati, said he had wanted to be a bass singer, but his voice was too high. ''That's probably why I chose to play the bass violin,'' he said. His mother, Rebecca, played the piano, and his aunt Clara Harvey was a violinist. ''When she opened up the violin case,'' Mr. Fleming said, ''I smelled the rosin for the first time. That was a vivid memory.'' He began playing the bass violin in high school, and he came to New York in 1963. ''There was a time in New York when you could play six days a week,'' Mr. Fleming said. Now, he occasionally plays at the Kitano on Park Avenue, he said. Earlier pictures in the series are at nytimes.com/lens."

2010-06-24T16:48:30Z,"""In the longer term, the Army has to return to its tradition of getting rid of leaders who are failing ... Back in World War II, the Army had no qualms about letting officers go; at least 16 of the 155 generals who commanded divisions in combat during the war were relieved while in combat. George Marshall, the nation's top general, felt that a willingness to fire subordinates was a requirement of leadership. He once described Gen. Hap Arnold, chief of the Army Air Forces, as a fine man, but one who 'didn't have the nerve to get rid of men not worth a damn.' ... The tradition of swift relief provided two benefits that we have lost in today's Army: It punished failure and it gave an opportunity to younger, more energetic officers who were better equipped to adapt to the quickening pace of the war ... But that tradition was somehow lost in the Korean War and buried conclusively in Vietnam. Nowadays, dynamic young leaders can't emerge as quickly, because almost no one is fired. In a much-discussed 2007 article in Armed Forces Journal, Lt. Col. Paul Yingling wrote that ""a private who loses a rifle suffers far greater consequences than a general who loses a war."" ... Had Army officers been managed in the Afghan War as they were during World War II, we would be seeing a new generation of leaders emerge. Instead, a beleaguered president once again is sending David Petraeus to the rescue, making it appear as though he is the only competent general we have."""

2010-06-24T09:38:14Z,"Slovakia bounced Italy out of the 2010 World Cup, by a 3-2 score, at Ellis Park in Johannesburg, the biggest shock of the tournament thus far. The Italians are the defending champions, and while it's difficult to repeat (only Italy in 1934 and 1938 and Brazil in 1958 and 1962 have done so), it's another thing to go out in the first round. It was a pulsating match, especially the second half. For Slovakia, which led 1-0 at halftime, Robert Vittek scored his second goal in the 73rd minute. The teams then traded goals in the 81st (Antonio DiNatale), 89th (Kamil Kopunek) and 92nd (Fabio Quagliarella). Paraguay and Slovakia qualify from Group F, and will meet their counterparts from Group G in the Round of 16.

2010-06-24T08:59:13Z,"Just a quick thought. Round 9 of the Kings Tournament in Romania is underway and Magnus Carlsen of Norway has White against Liviu-Dieter Nisipeanu of Romania. The game, which is live, started 1 e4 e5 2 Nf3 Nc6 3 Bb5 and then Nisipeanu trotted out the Schliemann Defense with 3 ... f5. Now maybe Nisipeanu did not want to suffer several hours of the ""Spanish Torture,"" the nickname for the Ruy Lopez. But playing the Schliemann, which is a bit unsound to begin with, against Carlsen seems a bit like committing harakiri. Maybe he figured he has a puncher's chance of winning if he just goes in and trades blows. Or maybe he is testing Carlsen's knowledge. We'll see."

Dr. M was well known in the hospital for his elegant surgical technique and deep respect for patients as individuals. But what my friend, Dennis, and I, and the other doctors-in-training cherished most was his uncanny ability to recognize exactly how much we residents could and couldn't do. Or, perhaps more aptly, how much he should and shouldn't do when teaching us. When we were interns, fresh out of medical school, for example, Dr. M seemed to be everywhere at once, filling our lives with directives on patient management, directions on where to cut (''just a millimeter lower!'') and daily assurances that even the greatest of surgeons all started out struggling to remove grape-sized sebaceous cysts and egg-shaped benign fatty lumps and bumps."

2010-06-24T00:00:00Z,"KRANE--Steven C. The lawyers and staff of Proskauer Rose LLP mourn the sudden and untimely passing of our longtime partner, colleague, and friend, Steven C. Krane. Steve was one of the nation's foremost and widely recognized leaders in the field of legal ethics and professional responsibility. He was also a wise counselor and confidant, a dear friend, charming colleague and a truly kind and decent human being. The General Counsel of Proskauer, Steve also served as co-head of the firm's Law Firm Practice Group, where he represented law firms and individual lawyers in their most sensitive and important matters. But he will likely be best remembered for his integral leadership role in developing and interpreting the rules governing the professional conduct of lawyers. Steve was a member of the New York State Commission on Public Integrity and the former Chair of the American Bar Association's Standing Committee on Ethics and Professional Responsibility. For 14 years, Steve also led the New York State Bar Association committee responsible for formulating the ethics rules governing New York lawyers. In 2007, he was appointed by then-Chief Judge Judith Kaye as co-chair of the New York Judicial Institute on Professionalism in the Law. He also served as vice-chair of the NYSBA Special Committee on the Law Governing Firm Structure and Operation (the MacCrate Committee); chaired the NYSBA Special Committee on Multidisciplinary Practice; and was recently named vice-chair of the International Bar Association Committee on Multidisciplinary Practices. Steve was active in the development of law and policy relating to cross-border legal practice, serving as one of the principal negotiators for the ABA and NYSBA in their efforts to achieve agreements with foreign governments to liberalize restrictions on lawyers. He held numerous positions in this arena, including: chair-elect of the NYSBA Section on International Law and Practice; chair of the NYSBA Special Committee on Cross-Border Legal Practice; and advisor to the ABA Task Force on International Trade in Legal Services. He was recently appointed to the Policy Committee of the Bar Issues Commission of the International Bar Association. Steve also had a distinguished career as a bar leader outside of the field of legal ethics, most notably serving as president of the NYSBA in 2001-2002, the youngest person to hold that post, and as a member of the ABA's Board of Governors. He coordinated the efforts of the organized bar in responding to the terrorist attacks of September 11; successfully represented the ABA in its challenge to the Federal Trade Commission's ""Red Flag Rules""; and created and chaired the Student Loan Assistance for the Public Interest program, which provides grants to lawyers in public interest jobs. Active in the community, he was a member of the Board of Directors of the Friends of the John Jay Homestead (Katonah, NY). He previously served as a clerk for Judge Kaye, with whom he maintained a longtime friendship, in the New York State Court of Appeals. In addition, he was a hearing panel member and the hearing panel chair of the Departmental Disciplinary Committee, First Judicial Department, in New York; served as a hearing panel chair for the Committee on Grievances of the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York; and was a special referee for disciplinary cases in the Appellate Division, Second Judicial Department. Steve also wrote and lectured extensively on ethics issues, and taught professional responsibility for several years at the Columbia University School of Law. Apart from his extraordinary professional accomplishments, Steve was a remarkable human being: beloved by colleagues; a devoted mentor to numerous young lawyers; brilliant but humble; passionate about the profession; a man of boundless energy, impeccable integrity and filled with abundant cheer. He will be sorely missed and always remembered as a true lawyer's lawyer and a devoted colleague. Our thoughts are with his family. Allen I. Fagin Chairman, Proskauer Rose LLP"

2010-06-25T17:15:04Z,"In this World Cup, as with every other World Cup in history, wrong calls happen. Whether they are crucial and end a team's hopes or whether they are inconsequential, the calls are frustrating at the least and infuriating at the most. Naturally we focus our anger on the man on the field wearing a different color shirt. Yes, the referee gets most of the blame, or the whole refereeing team and occasionally a manipulative player who takes a dive to get a call."

2010-06-25T16:05:14Z,"When the intra-liberal e-mail round-robin known as JournoList first attracted attention early last year, it seemed significant primarily as a milestone in the emergence of a kind of ""movement liberal"" mentality among certain media personalities - a team-player spirit, you might say, that imitated what liberals have long perceived as one of the strengths of movement conservatism. I suspect that some of the journalists who participated in the e-mail list (I'm thinking of figures who write for mainstream outlets like Time and Newsweek and The New Yorker, in particular) would have never dreamed of joining a semi-secret liberal forum a decade ago: That would have seemed too partisan, too compromising, too biased. But now the world had changed, and they were happy to join a members-only political discussion group that deliberately excluded right-of-center writers and thinkers."

But it's easier to do the shopping once they get there, at the new little market in the expanding, ramshackle complex anchored by Rockaway Taco. Elizabeth Gilchrist, a partner, said the produce was mainly local (much of it from Blooming Hill Farm in the Hudson Valley) and organic. Right now, greens, including callaloo, are in abundance, $3 a bag. There are also some tropical fruits because they are used by the smoothie stand that shares the premises. The market also sells bread from Roberta's in Bushwick, Brooklyn, and some locally handmade odds and ends like glasses made from Red Stripe beer bottles, $10 each."

If you haven't seen ""Black White + Gray: A Portrait of Sam Wagstaff and Robert Mapplethorpe,"" add it to your Netflix queue pronto! Johansson riffed on Wagstaff's ability to morph from uptown art collector to downtown bohemian in a collection that includes slouchy masculine suits for above 57th Street and sexy, short leather dresses that are perfect for below 14th."

Some of the cranes appeared as prints on paper shirts and on full, gathered skirts and dresses. There were also some terrific wallpaper effects. I think you could compose a wonderful short story around a boy in Southern small town who wears a skull-print skirt. And I don't say that because I think there is anything strange about the idea.

Her bright smile and generous spirit were contagious. Long time teacher and school administrator, she was widely admired and loved by her colleagues and students alike.

2010-06-25T00:00:00Z,"KRANE--Steven C. The lawyers and staff of Proskauer Rose LLP mourn the sudden and untimely passing of our longtime partner, colleague, and friend, Steven C. Krane. Steve was one of the nation's foremost and widely recognized leaders in the field of legal ethics and professional responsibility. He was also a wise counselor and confidant, a dear friend, charming colleague and a truly kind and decent human being. The General Counsel of Proskauer, Steve also served as co-head of the firm's Law Firm Practice Group, where he represented law firms and individual lawyers in their most sensitive and important matters. But he will likely be best remembered for his integral leadership role in developing and interpreting the rules governing the professional conduct of lawyers. Steve was a member of the New York State Commission on Public Integrity and the former Chair of the American Bar Association's Standing Committee on Ethics and Professional Responsibility. For 14 years, Steve also led the New York State Bar Association committee responsible for formulating the ethics rules governing New York lawyers. In 2007, he was appointed by then-Chief Judge Judith Kaye as co-chair of the New York Judicial Institute on Professionalism in the Law. He also served as vice-chair of the NYSBA Special Committee on the Law Governing Firm Structure and Operation (the MacCrate Committee); chaired the NYSBA Special Committee on Multidisciplinary Practice; and was recently named vice-chair of the International Bar Association Committee on Multidisciplinary Practices. Steve was active in the development of law and policy relating to cross-border legal practice, serving as one of the principal negotiators for the ABA and NYSBA in their efforts to achieve agreements with foreign governments to liberalize restrictions on lawyers. He held numerous positions in this arena, including: chair-elect of the NYSBA Section on International Law and Practice; chair of the NYSBA Special Committee on Cross-Border Legal Practice; and advisor to the ABA Task Force on International Trade in Legal Services. He was recently appointed to the Policy Committee of the Bar Issues Commission of the International Bar Association. Steve also had a distinguished career as a bar leader outside of the field of legal ethics, most notably serving as president of the NYSBA in 2001-2002, the youngest person to hold that post, and as a member of the ABA's Board of Governors. He coordinated the efforts of the organized bar in responding to the terrorist attacks of September 11; successfully represented the ABA in its challenge to the Federal Trade Commission's ""Red Flag Rules""; and created and chaired the Student Loan Assistance for the Public Interest program, which provides grants to lawyers in public interest jobs. Active in the community, he was a member of the Board of Directors of the Friends of the John Jay Homestead (Katonah, NY). He previously served as a clerk for Judge Kaye, with whom he maintained a longtime friendship, in the New York State Court of Appeals. In addition, he was a hearing panel member and the hearing panel chair of the Departmental Disciplinary Committee, First Judicial Department, in New York; served as a hearing panel chair for the Committee on Grievances of the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York; and was a special referee for disciplinary cases in the Appellate Division, Second Judicial Department. Steve also wrote and lectured extensively on ethics issues, and taught professional responsibility for several years at the Columbia University School of Law. Apart from his extraordinary professional accomplishments, Steve was a remarkable human being: beloved by colleagues; a devoted mentor to numerous young lawyers; brilliant but humble; passionate about the profession; a man of boundless energy, impeccable integrity and filled with abundant cheer. He will be sorely missed and always remembered as a true lawyer's lawyer and a devoted colleague. Our thoughts are with his family. Funeral services will be held Monday June 28 at 11:30am at Frank E. Campbell, The Funeral Chapel, 1076 Madison Ave at 81st St, call: 212-288-3500 Allen I. Fagin Chairman, Proskauer Rose LLP"

For every student who graduated, four others dropped out. Now, two years after a charter school group took over, gang violence is sharply down, fewer students are dropping out, and test scores have inched upward.

2010-06-25T00:00:00Z,"KINNEAR--Peter Ogden, 92, passed away on May 31, 2010. Peter was a gifted architect, a private, wise and graceful man, with a wonderful sense of humor. From boyhood to college, Peter spent summers at Camp Pasquaney in Hebron, NH. He said that it was here that he learned the values that he carried with him through his life. There began his love for the mountains of the Northeast, where he skied and fly fished well into his 80's. His love of fly fishing took him to his beloved Three Rivers Ranch in Idaho, where he and wife Emily fished the Snake River for almost 20 years. He graduated from Yale School of Architecture in 1941, and in the 1950s he started his own firm in Greenwich, CT. He designed and built over 250 homes, and a variety of other buildings from Art Galleries, to a Firehouse in Tarrytown, NY. For Peter, architecture was a pairing of simple, elegant design, with the needs of his clients. His brilliance at siting a building was nothing short of genius. His family and friends will miss this man who skied with grace, fished with ardor, designed with vision and had a good laugh along the way."

While no one said he was leaving, there was little doubt in anyone's mind that most of those closest to Gen. Stanley A. McChrystal, who was fired on Wednesday by President Obama, would leave with him. That would be partly in a show of solidarity and partly because the new commander, Gen. David H.

We'll see when ''The Shaggs: Philosophy of the World'' is presented as a joint production of Playwrights Horizons and New York Theater Workshop next year. Featuring a book and lyrics by Joy Gregory, and music and lyrics by Gunnar Madsen, ''The Shaggs'' chronicles the real-life story of the Wiggin sisters -- Dorothy, known as Dot (vocals and lead guitar); Betty (rhythm guitar); and Helen (drums) -- who had no musical experience when their father, Austin, pulled them out of school and set them on a very crooked path to artistic immortality.

(HBO) FUNNY PEOPLE (2009) In this film from Judd Apatow, Adam Sandler, above, plays George Simmons, a stand-up comedian turned Hollywood star and jerk who discovers that he has a rare, potentially fatal blood disease. Seth Rogen is Ira, the fledgling comic George hires as an assistant, who for the time being seems only too content to accept his employer's scraps -- like the $1,000 he earns for writing jokes for George's appearance at a MySpace corporate event, while his boss pockets the $299,000 balance. And Mr. Apatow's wife, Leslie Mann, plays Laura, the love who got away from George, and the one he wants back now that he's dying. Writing in The New York Times, Manohla Dargis said there was ''something irritatingly self-satisfied'' about the film, partly stemming from the autobiographical touches, including Mr. Apatow's use of his wife and his daughters, Maude and Iris, who portray Laura's children. ''Watching 'Funny People,' you get the sense that Mr. Apatow, one of the most successful filmmakers working in Hollywood, is very happy,'' she wrote. ''Bummer.'' 10:30 A.M.

For young men, it's mainly the evenings, although a few brave guys wear them with jackets and ties, an idea that never took off in the mid-1950s. The return of the hot pants of 1970, worn with high heels, recalls '40s pin-up girls. They're now worn for day as well as for clubs. Wide-legged, knee-length shorts are seen as equivalent to short, above-the-knee skirts for the office. It'll take a couple of seasons to sort out how shorts fit in with all city lifestyles."

He designed and built over 250 homes, and a variety of other buildings from Art Galleries, to a Firehouse in Tarrytown, NY.

Eventually, she agreed to volunteer on a very limited basis. What began as a temporary, part-time volunteer job soon turned into the driving force of Ms. Harris's life, and she became President of the House in 1979. The original New York City House was located on East 86th Street and had 24 guest rooms; Ms. Harris spearheaded the expansion of the House to its present location on East 73rd Street, which serves 84 families, and is now the largest Ronald McDonald House in the world. During her tenure, she expanded the Board of Directors to include some of the most influential and successful business leaders in New York, including investors Kenneth Langone and Stanley Shopkorn, and Randel Falco, former Chairman and CEO of America Online. In 1994, Ms. Harris launched ""Skate with the Greats"" an annual fundraising event with the New York Rangers, through which she befriended Rangers legend Rod Gilbert and his wife, Judy, who became avid supporters of the House. Mr. Gilbert said, ""Vivian was a good friend and a very special lady. She made everybody Brian Leetch and I, and all the Rangers realize that we could help make a difference in these kids' lives. She had immense passion and tremendous grace. Judy and I will miss her very much, and our prayers are with her family."" While Ms. Harris' role as a fundraiser and administrator helped the Ronald McDonald House of New York to expand and thrive, for the children and families who have stayed there, Ms. Harris will be remembered for how much she cared about their emotional well-being and happiness. Her mission was to make sure that the children were always treated, as she said, ""as kids first, and kids with cancer second,"" which became the mantra of the House. Additionally, Ms. Harris was on the Board of Directors and Trustee of the Boy Scouts of America, where she was also Chair of Scouting for Children with Disabilities, a program that she expanded from 2,500 members to over 19,000. Her work on behalf of ill and disabled children earned Ms. Harris numerous awards and honors, including a Citation of Merit from Mayor Edward Koch for ""Educating the Public About Handicapped Children"" in 1980' Social Conscience Award from the Karen Horney Psychiatric Clinic, the organization's highest award, in 1976; Golden Torch Award from the National Boy Scout Committee in 1981; and a Silver Beaver Award from the Boy Scouts of America in 1980. She is survived by her brother, Robert Sloane, of Florida; her son, Jerry Harris, of Lloyd Harbor, New York; her daughter, Ellyn Harris Wallin, of Manhattan; and her grandson, Kevin Rudolf, of Los Angeles."

2010-06-27T00:00:00Z,"RICHARD AVEDON once told Ruth Ansel that if you did one good picture a year, that was enough. As an art director of Harper's Bazaar in the 1960s, The New York Times Magazine in the '70s and Vanity Fair in the '80s, she did far more than that. ''Hall of Femmes: Ruth Ansel,'' a new book by the Swedish design duo Hjarta Smarta, explores her extraordinary career as the first female art director in all three of those posts, and the iconic imagery she produced. Like the February 1965 cover of Bazaar (far left), which featured a close-up of Steve McQueen, his smiling face framed by the diamond bangles on a woman's arm. ''If we had used Cary Grant,'' she notes in the book, ''it would have been less of a surprise.'' Nowadays, Ms. Ansel runs her own design studio and has just completed a book on the photographer Jerry Schatzberg, which will be published by Rizzoli this fall. As for magazines, she has taken a ''timeout'' from looking at them. ''Back then we believed style and artistry, and originality made for good business,'' she said. ''We were all about surprises on the covers. Today, there is not enough time or money for that. What a great opportunity for someone willing to think out of the box. Hello, iPad!''"

2010-06-27T00:00:00Z,"OLIVIA JUDSON Yeasts are fungi -- so they are related to mushrooms. And fungi are, strangely, quite close relations of ours. Or at least, they are more closely related to animals than they are to plants. Like animals, they digest their food -- though fungi do it not by swallowing, but by releasing chemicals into the environment. The chemicals break down the food -- like rotting wood -- into smaller molecules, and the fungus then imports these smaller molecules into its cells. Sometimes this takes on sinister dimensions. For example, if you are a nematode worm crawling through the soil, you may get stuck in a sticky web. But in this web there is no spider. The web itself is alive: it is not made of silk, but of the filaments of a fungus. The web itself will digest you. Other fungi set snares -- they produce rings of cells that swell up when a worm passes through, catching it round the middle. The fungus then digests the worm at its leisure."

The Department of Pediatrics at Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center deeply mourns the passing of Vivian Harris, former president of the Ronald McDonald House of New York City. Mrs. Harris was an extraordinary individual who devoted her life to the welfare of children. She served as President of this ""home away from home"" for children with cancer and their families for over 26 years, and in so doing, provided the means by which hundreds of children afflicted with a cancer diagnosis could achieve the best cancer care possible. As a partner with the Department of Pediatrics of MSKCC, she strove to provide the most appropriate and nurturing atmosphere possible to enable families to come through the cancer experience with minimal impact on the family unit. She was a strong advocate for the role of the family in the ultimate health and well-being of young patients. The ""home"" Vivian created, both in proximity and supportive services with our staff, allowed children and families to receive comprehensive cancer treatment they might otherwise have had to forego. Our robust program in ambulatory care, designed to significantly curtail the time children spend in hospital, was largely enabled by her drive to meet the needs of children and families in treatment. Mrs. Harris was beloved by the Board of Directors and staff of the Home, her colleagues at MSKCC, and the patients and families she served. Her personal style and good humor brought smiles and relief to the dozens in her care on a daily basis. Our condolences to her children, Jerry and Ellyn, her grandson Kevin Rudolf, and brother Robert Sloane. She will be deeply missed."

Now is a good time for Watson to give his fans a glimpse into his thinking, his technique and his golf wisdom, and that is the principal ambition of Watson's new, two-disc DVD, ''Lessons of a Lifetime.'' Watson has stored up a lot of instructional advice over the decades, much of it culled from the golfing greats he has known. But this is no quick-fix highlight reel of golf tricks worth trying. That is obviously not Watson's way of doing things. His DVD starts with fundamentals like grip, setup and alignment and takes you through just about everything else you might encounter on the golf course, including a downhill buried lie in a bunker. Some of us might just throw up our hands and declare that ball unplayable, but that obviously is not Watson's way of doing things either."

There was Derek Jeter at shortstop, Jorge Posada catching and Andy Pettitte on the mound, as special as ever. Mariano Rivera showed up, but his appearance was unexpected. The Yankees scored four runs off Jonathan Broxton in the ninth inning, then escaped with an 8-6 victory in 10 innings over Torre's Dodgers on Sunday when Robinson Cano blasted a two-run homer. It was the second time in four games that the Yankees tied the score in the ninth inning, went ahead in the 10th on a home run, then relied on two innings from Rivera. Rarely do managers bring in their closers in a tie game on the road, but Joe Girardi had Rivera, and with a day off Monday, he knew he could use him for two innings, if needed. Torre does not have the same luxury."

2010-06-29T16:32:46Z,"At age 102, the renowned Brazilian architect Oscar Niemeyer is still working - and still inspiring. Specifically, he inspired one of his countrymen - Roberto Stern, the president and creative director of the jeweler H. Stern - to bring out a collection of jewelry that was inspired by the maestro's sketches of buildings (including one of Brasilia, Niemeyer's masterpiece), flowers and even the female form. The H. Stern Collection by Oscar Niemeyer, which was created in collaboration with the architect, captures the sketches' light, flowing lines and their general joie de vivre. Niemeyer's sketch for the exuberantly-curved roof of a church in Pampulha, Belo Horizonte, for example, was translated into a pair of white gold and diamond earrings. An almost childlike drawing of a flower became a graceful, delicate bracelet made of what seems like a single, slender ribbon of yellow gold. The jeweler is known for its creative collaborations, like those with Diane von Furstenberg, the Campana brothers and even Disney (on the surreal-luxe ""Alice in Wonderland"" collection). But was Niemeyer surprised by Roberto Stern's request to turn his architectural sketches into rings and necklaces? Not at all. Stern recalled that the architect said simply, ""I want to make beautiful things."""

Only 19 percent of currently married couples have taken part in marriage counseling; a recent study of divorcing couples found that nearly two-thirds never sought counseling before deciding to end the relationship."
2010-06-29T00:00:00Z,"GOSS--Mary E. Weber Professor Emerita of the Department of Public Health at the Weill Cornell Medical Center, died unexpectedly at her home on June 23. A pioneering medical sociologist, her 1959 Ph.D. dissertation at Columbia University, under the direction of Professor Robert K. Merton, was an analysis of the organizational roles of physicians. Later published as Physicians in Bureaucracy, her early and influential work helped shape the emerging specialty of medical sociology. It was complemented by her contribution to the 1957 book The Student Physician that described innovative changes to the Comprehensive Care and Teaching Program for fourth-year medical students at Weill Cornell, such as introducing a public health focus on more advanced epidemiologic studies of diseases important to clinicians. As a medical sociologist, often in collaboration with Professor George G. Reader, MD, of Weill Cornell, she subsequently contributed to a wide range of studies on the delivery and effectiveness of medical care that led to her 1972 faculty appointment in the Weill Cornell Department of Public Health. She served a term as Book Review Editor of the American Journal of Sociology, and then was Editor of the Journal of Medical Sociology, now the Journal of Health and Social Behavior, from 1976 to 1978. Along with teaching and administrative responsibilities, her research interests continued until her retirement in 1992. For these and other contributions, she was honored in 2000 with the prestigious Leo G. Reeder Award from the Section of Medical Sociology of the American Sociological Association. Born in Chicago in 1926, she graduated in 1943 from the then Nazareth Academy for Women in LaGrange Park, IL. She then attended the University of Iowa, Iowa City, where in 1947 she received a department honored BA in sociology along with university honors and, in 1948, an MA, also in sociology. Married in 1945 to Albert E. Goss, in 1948 she and he began residency in Amherst, MA where she did fill-in teaching of sociology at Smith College and the University of Massachusetts, Amherst. In January 1951, she entered the Ph.D. program in sociology at Columbia University, in which she was a Gilder Fellow from 1952-1953, and began joint residence in New York City and Amherst. In 1966 she, her surviving husband and young son, Charles A. Goss, entered her long residency in Piscataway, NJ. Charles now resides in Chapel Hill, NC with his wife, Karen, and children Jessica and Derek. Her other immediate survivors comprise her sister, Dorothy Weber Inyard and nephew Gary Inyard of Chicago, brother C. Edward Weber and wife Suzanne, of Milwaukee, and nephews Paul Weber of Spencer, WI and Mark Weber of Eden Prairie MN, and their families. A memorial service will be announced later. Her ashes are consigned to the Weber family plot in the Bohemian National Cemetery in Chicago. Memorializing donations should be made to the Weill Cornell Medical College (please write ""Dept. of Public Health in memory of Mary Goss"" in the memo line of the check), Office of Development, 1300 York Avenue, Box 123, New York, NY 10065."

(13) THE BEACHES OF AGNÈS (2009) In her latest documentary, presented by ''P.O.V.,'' the French filmmaker Agnès Varda, now 82, creates something of a sequel to ''The Gleaners and I.'' That film, which she shot on digital video, made a case for foraging as a way of life. In this film, which Manohla Dargis, writing in The New York Times, called ''similarly glorious and generous,'' Ms. Varda, above, picks ''through the world, close to home and far afield, finding images that please her and give her pause, like her wrinkled hand, the one not holding the camera, that she scrutinizes with rue if no obvious regret.'' The result is an overview of her life, from her youth in Belgium to her association with the French New Wave, her marriage to the director Jacques Demy (''The Umbrellas of Cherbourg'') and the making of her movies. ''It's a remarkable history, rich in comedy and occasionally heartbreaking, filled with wise reflections and strange digressions about the wonders of life,'' Ms. Dargis added. ''It's a life she has come close to perfecting, I think, mostly by keeping her mind as blissfully and enduringly open as her round eyes.'' 8 P.M.
