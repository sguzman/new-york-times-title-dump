Mr. Laurents, who wrote the book for ''Gypsy'' and directed its 2008 revival on Broadway starring Patti LuPone, said that Warner Brothers and Joel Silver were attached as producers, but that no director had been chosen. Contrary to a report in The New York Post on Wednesday, Mr. Laurents said that Ms. Streisand would not direct the film; she once wanted to, he said, ''but playing Rose is enough to make her happy.'' Ms. Streisand, who won an Academy Award for best actress in 1968 for the film musical ''Funny Girl,'' has been interested in doing ''Gypsy'' for many years, Mr. Laurents said, ''but now things are serious and a movie is truly in the works.'' He said that he had suggested Tom Hanks to play the role of Herbie, Rose's love interest and the talent manager of her two daughters, Baby June and Louise. ''Barbra loved the idea,'' Mr. Laurents said."

The Lauder family and Clinique send their heartfelt condolences upon the passing of Karen Anderegg, friend and former President of Clinique. Karen died on December 27, 2010 at her winter home at Smoke Tree Ranch, Palm Springs, California at the age of 70. Her husband William D. Rutherford and her step-son Dr. Mel Rutherford were by her side. Karen had a talent for words, a talent for people, and a talent for style. Karen was already a well-known figure in the magazine industry with editorial careers at Vogue, and Mademoiselle and had just launched the first U.S. edition of Elle, when we tapped her to be the President of Clinique in 1987. During the five years she spent leading Clinique, she was known among her colleagues for her creative vision and her brilliance. A strong mentor and a tireless advocate for women, Karen was generous with her advice and her encouragement to young women leaders. Karen was one of the most valuable members of our management team. She moved to Portland, Oregon in 1991 to be with her husband. Although Karen was deeply missed at Clinique, we were glad to see her share her passions for women's issues and art in her new community. She served on the Boards of Directors of the Oregon Symphony, Oregon Entrepreneurs Forum, The Coast Airlines, Bizstrata, and Athena Medical. At the time of her death, she was a member of the Board of Ethics Point and ODS Health Plans. She also served on the Business Advisory Board of Portland State University. Karen is survived by her daughter Margit Anderegg and grandchildren Augie and Axel of New York City; her sister Kathryn Miller of Woodland, Washington; nephew F. Jackson Lewis and family of Portland, Oregon; her husband William D. Rutherford and his children, Dr. Mel Rutherford of Dundas, Canada, and Wayne Rutherford of Dakar, Senegal. She will be missed by her many friends at The Estee Lauder Companies. In lieu of flowers, the family asks that donations be made to Providence Portland Medical Foundation, 4805 NE Glisan, Portland, Oregon 97213, or to Memorial Sloan-Kettering Ovarian Cancer Research Fund, or to the charity of your choice."

He served in the US Navy with distinction in World War II. He earned a Silver Star in 1943 at age 29 due to his bravery at the time of the invasion of Sicily. He was in command of a ship close to the shore the night before the invasion that had been ordered to signal the location of the landing beach to the invading forces. He had a successful business career in the printing business that resulted in the sale by him and his partner of the Allen Hollander Company to Litton Industries when Arthur was in his mid-50's. In conjunction with Admiral Gene La Roque and other patriotic people, Arthur helped start and enlist substantial support for the Center for Defense Information in Washington, DC. Arthur loved golf and he served as a Board Member and President of Quaker Ridge Golf Club. He traveled extensively throughout his life. In 1975 he and all his family mourned the death of his daughter, Elizabeth.

He said he would address the team on Thursday and would go over the basics: that the first team to receive the ball cannot win simply by kicking a field goal, as it could in the regular season; that a touchdown would still win the game on the first possession; that should each team kick one field goal, the format reverts to sudden death."

I stand by all of those arguments, but I also agree with Daniel Foster that the filibuster reform proposal the Senate Democrats are putting forward looks pretty reasonable.  Essentially, for the filibuster to work as I'd like it to work, it needs to be available as a check on temporary majorities without becoming a routine tactic for obstruction, which is how it's increasingly employed. Ultimately, restoring this balance requires more collegiality, comity, and good manners: There's no rule you can change that explicitly limits the filibuster to particularly sweeping and controversial pieces of legislation. (I mean, no reasonable rule, since I suppose you could imagine a provision stating that ""60 votes shall only be required for cloture when Gallup shows that a majority of Americans oppose the legislation in question,"" or something similarly implausible.) But the revisions the Democrats are contemplating - which would limit the filibuster to substantive measures (no filibustering motions to proceed) and require actual speechifying from filibustering senators - would at least make the filibuster feel more extraordinary than it does today. And that seems like a step in the right direction."

2011-01-07T14:33:38Z,"Clutch performance in professional basketball has its own distinct mythology. The meaning of every action - each shot, foregone shot, pass and foregone pass - is dissected and analyzed to a ludicrous degree, primarily in an effort to better understand the stuff of which N.B.A. players are made. Does a certain star have ""nerves of steel"" or a ""killer instinct?"" Are they soft? Weak-minded? Descriptions such as these are thrown around disguised as absolutes, even though clutch play is often hopelessly tainted by perception bias. All it takes is one big shot to create a legend. Once a player establishes a reputation as a clutch scorer, it typically follows him to his grave, regardless of what that pesky legitimate evidence indicates."

2011-01-07T00:00:00Z,"TRAGER--Judge David G. The Brooklyn Law School community mourns the loss of an extraordinary and beloved colleague, teacher, trustee, former dean and great friend. The son of Solomon and Clara Trager, who emigrated from Vienna to the United States at the end of World War I, David was raised in Mount Vernon, NY, and was a graduate of Columbia University and Harvard Law School. As a young lawyer, David trained under the great trial lawyer, Emile Zola Berman, and then served successively as law clerk to New York State Court of Appeals Judge Kenneth Keating and Chief Judge Stanley Fuld. He then began a career that combined law school teaching and public service. From 1970 to 1972, he served as Assistant United States Attorney for the Eastern District of New York and Chief of the Appeals Division. In 1972, he joined the faculty of Brooklyn Law School, with which he was associated until his death. In 1974, was appointed United States Attorney for the Eastern District of New York by President Richard Nixon. When David took office, he pledged to hire only ""the most qualified lawyers that can be attracted,"" selected solely on the basis of their ability, and he increased the hiring of women and minority assistants. He was the first U.S. Attorney in the country to create part-time positions for Assistant U.S. Attorneys. He also pledged to conduct business ""in a completely independent and nonpolitical fashion,"" and to ""enforce the laws vigorously against all who violate them."" He kept that pledge, a fact recognized by President Jimmy Carter who continued him in office. In 1978, he returned to Brooklyn Law School, where he taught Constitutional Law and Conflict of Laws and, in 1983, was appointed Dean of the Law School. During his tenure as Dean, the School made great progress in virtually every area. He was instrumental in attracting nationally renowned and promising new scholars and made the School a magnet for visiting professors from around the world. Under his leadership, the School embarked on what was at the time the most ambitious capital expansion program in its history, including construction of an architecturally acclaimed addition to the School's main building and the purchase of the School's first residence halls. David was a formidable multi-tasker; while serving as Dean, he also served as Chair of the State Commission of Investigation, as a member of the New York City Charter Revision Commission, as President of the Federal Bar Council, and as Chairman of Mayor Koch's Committee on the Judiciary. In 1993, he was appointed United States District Judge for the Eastern District of New York, and continued his affiliation with Brooklyn Law School as a member of the Board of Trustees and as an Adjunct Professor. His role in raising the School to new heights was indispensable and his mark on Brooklyn Law School is indelible. We extend our deepest sympathy to David's wife, Roberta Weisbrod, their children, Mara (Isaac Koyfman), Josiah, and Naomi, grandchildren Nathaniel and Hannah, his brother, Arthur, and the entire family.

The organizers of the Cannes Film Festival clearly didn't mind Mr. De Niro's other affiliation, announcing on Thursday that he will serve as the president of the jury for its coming 64th annual run, which will be May 11-22. Mr. De Niro, the quintessential New York actor whose films run the gamut from ''Mean Streets'' to ''Little Fockers,'' served as the president of the Cannes jury twice in the 1980s, and starred in two films that won the festival's Palme d'or prize: Martin Scorsese's ''Taxi Driver,'' in 1976, and Roland Joffe's ''Mission,'' in 1986. In a remarkably long statement for the notably laconic actor, Mr. De Niro said, ''The Cannes Film Festival is a rare opportunity for me as it is one of the oldest and one of the best in the world.'' He added that because of his involvement in the Tribeca Film Festival and its spinoff the Doha Tribeca Film Festival in Qatar, ''I have an increased appreciation for the jury, who serve, undertaking an important role in choosing films that are represented in the world of film at its highest level, and these types of festivals help connect the international film community and have a lasting cultural impact.''"

Born and raised in the Bronx, she married the love of her life Ira Saunders in 1940. She worked for an accounting firm in Manhattan, and after the birth of her two daughters Barbra and Margi, she moved her family to Hewlett, New York where she was a devoted wife and mother.

After the passing of Ira, Muriel continued to live life to the fullest as a golfer, avid card player, tennis enthusiast, world traveler and grandmother of four. Muriel had recently moved to Atlanta Georgia to be closer to her family and her newly born great grandchildren. Muriel passed away on January 1st, 2011 after having her last dance on New Year's Eve.

2011-01-08T19:43:03Z,"My Sunday column looks at the rise of China, through the prism of the new women's world chess champion, Hou Yifan. She's a 16-year-old schoolgirl, and an astonishing phenomenon. Until now, there has only been one woman to crack the top 100 in chess rankings, and that's Judit Polgar, by far the most impressive player in the history of women's chess. Polgar, from an amazing chess-playing Hungarian family, peaked at no. 8 in the world and most recently was ranked 49. But Polgar is 34 and is unlikely to surge to the top of the rankings, while Hou Yifan is young enough that she could end up in the top few players worldwide over the next 10 or 15 years. (While Hou Yifan is the women's chess champion, she still has a lower ranking than Polgar, who does not compete in women's tournaments. Here's the piece by my Times colleague and chess columnist Dylan McClain about Hou's triumph.)"

Dr. Badell was born in Barcelona, Spain in 1929, and her Catalan heritage and pride infused her life's achievements both personal and professional. She was the only female graduate in the class of 1952 of the Facultad de Medicina in Barcelona. Married in 1953, her young family made the journey to the United States in 1955. With pride, she became a United States citizen on April 20, 1964. Dr. Badell completed her residency in the new field of Rehabilitation with the support of Dr. Howard A. Rusk. As a leader in the study of physical medicine and pediatric rehabilitation, Dr. Badell's career spanned more than 50 years including roles as Director of the Children's Unit at St. Agnes Hospital in White Plains, NY and Director of Rehabilitation at Long Island Jewish Medical Center, Westbury, NY. She pioneered the use of a combined therapy approach for children, integrating physical, speech and occupational therapies along with educational, emotional and family support. She also published extensively and is still considered an expert in the overall treatment of spina bifida. Dr. Badell's personal passion was being a mother and continually nurturing her own and her daughters' relationship with a beautiful, loving and multi-talented family miles away in Spain. Her legacy to her daughters and grandchildren is passed on through her values which speak to being a good person that honors family, enjoys the accomplishments that come with hard work, seeks an excellent education and has the courage to overcome obstacles. She is survived by her daughters and their husbands: Angie (Douglas Robertson), Carmen (John Thain), and Maria (Michael Paddack); and her treasured grandchildren are blessed with many memories of their ""Yaya"" and ""Grandma"": Alexander (Tracy), Nicole, Victoria and Zachary Thain; Anna Fleming and Eliza Claire Paddack, along with an extended family in and around Barcelona, Spain. It was Dr. Badell's wish that she also be known for her ongoing esteem and support of the New York Province of the Society of Jesus. Services will be held at the Church of the Resurrection in Rye, NY on Tuesday January 11, at 11am."

2011-01-08T00:00:00Z,"The Seahawks are the worst team ever to reach the playoffs in an established league that doesn't award postseason berths like participation trophies. Their first-round hopes rest with their legendary home-field advantage (bolstered by crowd noise and jet lag) and the Saints' knack for tripping over weak opponents (see Cardinals and Browns). SEAHAWKS ON OFFENSE If Matt Hasselbeck was the family sedan, he would be donated to charity for a tax write-off rather than traded in at this point. Hasselbeck is a consummate pro who has had an outstanding career, but he could snap like a piece of balsa wood at any time. The rest of the offense was built from post-consumer recyclables, cast-offs from bad teams like Mike Williams (Lions), Marshawn Lynch (Bills) and Michael Robinson (Niners). The hardest hitter in the N.F.L. is not Ray Lewis or Troy Polamalu; it's central tendency. The Saints' defense recorded 26 interceptions and 9 return touchdowns last year, but those outliers regressed to 9 interceptions and 2 turnovers this season. The Saints' real turnover potential lies somewhere between the two extremes."

2011-01-08T00:00:00Z,"When Daniel Kitson was about 9, he told his teacher that he was thinking of killing himself. At some point over the next few decades, he forgot this had ever happened, until just over a week ago when his mother reminded him. Asked in an interview if he really was suicidal or if it was just a plea for attention, he said with a merry chuckle, ''I have no idea.'' It's the kind of odd, intriguing story that Mr. Kitson specializes in: disturbing, willfully open-ended and its content incongruously matched with its tone. In his acclaimed shows Mr. Kitson, a 33-year-old British comic with a bushy beard and a stutter, explores questions about loss and love and the pursuit of meaning that are too complicated to answer completely."
2011-01-08T00:00:00Z,"On the third-season premiere of ''Jersey Shore'' on Thursday night, it was Deena Cortese, the newest addition to the beach house, who spent the episode repeatedly declaring herself a ''blast in a glass.'' But on Friday it was MTV that had cause to celebrate: it said the premiere had been watched by 8.45 million viewers, making it MTV's highest-rated series broadcast to date. The Season 3 debut episode, in which Nicole Polizzi (alias Snooki), Mike Sorrentino (aka the Situation) and their catchphrase-coining pals returned to their abode in Seaside Heights, N.J., saw a ratings increase of 63 percent over the Season 2 premiere in July (when the orange-skinned cast traveled to Miami) and 36 percent over that season's finale in October. The overall viewership for the latest ''Jersey Shore'' premiere at 10 p.m. even exceeded broadcast networks like ABC (which drew 7.8 million viewers for a ''Private Practice'' repeat) and NBC (which attracted just over two million for reruns of ''The Office''). ''At the end of the day they haven't changed,'' Chris Linn, MTV's executive vice president of programming and head of production, said in a telephone interview. ''They're still true to who they are. They're the same characters that we fell in love with in the first season. I think we all have the same worry that the success of the show and their notoriety would somehow change them into something less enjoyable, and that just hasn't happened.''"

Prepare to grow even greener with envy: on Friday HBO announced that it had ordered a full season of a new comedy series that Ms. Dunham created and will star in for that cable channel. HBO said in a news release that the series, called ''Girls,'' will offer ''a comic look at the assorted humiliations and rare triumphs of a group of girls in their early 20s,'' with a cast that will also feature Jemima Kirke (of ''Tiny Furniture''), Allison Williams (''American Dreams''), Adam Driver (of the HBO movie ''You Don't Know Jack'') and Zosia Mamet (''Mad Men''). Lest she be labeled an underachiever, Ms. Dunham also wrote and directed the show's pilot episode, and the series will be produced by Jenni Konner and Judd Apatow (who's keeping plenty busy himself these days). A premiere date for ''Girls'' wasn't immediately announced. This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print."

The Board of Trustees and Staff of the Whitney Museum of American Art note with deep sadness the passing of longtime Trustee, writer, advisor, and dear friend, B. H. Friedman. He will always be remembered for his love of art, language and books. Bob wrote the biography of the Museum's founder Gertrude Vanderbilt Whitney and numerous works on artists including an early biography on Jackson Pollock. His passion for the Whitney and American Art led to his appointment to the Whitney Board of Trustees in 1961, as one of the original non-family Trustees. B. H. lent his intellect and wisdom to the shaping of the institution for four decades serving as Chairman of the Whitney's first Building Committee and overseeing the planning and construction of our iconic Marcel Breuer Building. During his outstanding leadership of the Acquisitions Committee, the Museum's collection was enhanced by so many of the New York School of artists he befriended. When elected an Honorary Trustee in 1978, it was said that B.H. ""brought a dimension to our thinking, an insight, which is rare and precious.' This depth and his legacy will remain an indelible part of the Whitney. His presence will be sorely missed. Our most sincere and heartfelt sympathies to his daughter Daisy, his son Jackson, daughter-in-law Petra, and his grandchildren Oskar and Linea. Flora Miller Biddle, Honorary Chairman Leonard A.

(TCM) THE ESSENTIALS: ROAD TO MOROCCOBing Crosby portrays Jeff Peters, and Bob Hope is Turkey Jackson, con artists marooned in the Arabian desert after a shipwreck, in this 1942 musical, directed by David Butler. In need of cash, Jeff sells Turkey into slavery, but then decides to rescue his friend after his conscience gets the best of him -- only to discover that Turkey is now the romantic consort of the beautiful Princess Shalmar (Dorothy Lamour, above, with Hope, left, and Crosby). But Turkey has competition in the evil sheik Mullay Kasim (Anthony Quinn). Meanwhile, a court astrologer sees doom in Jeff and Turkey's future. In introducing the film, Robert Osborne and Alec Baldwin explain why ''Road to Morocco'' -- the third, and most popular, of the ''Road'' pictures starring Crosby, Hope and Lamour -- is must-see viewing. The evening continues on a royal theme with ''The Prince and the Showgirl'' (1957), with Marilyn Monroe as an American starlet in London who causes an international stir when she falls for a titled European (Laurence Olivier, who also directed), at 9:30; ''The Swan'' (1956), starring Grace Kelly as a noblewoman who falls for her brother's tutor (Louis Jourdan) on the eve of her marriage to a prince (Alec Guinness), at 11:30; ''Mrs. Brown'' (1997), about the scandalous friendship between Queen Victoria (Judi Dench) and John Brown (Billy Connolly), her personal servant, at 1:30 a.m.; and ''The Student Prince'' (1954), with Edmund Purdom as a prince who falls in love with a barmaid (Ann Blyth) during his last fling before assuming the crown, at 3:30. 10:30 A.M.

2011-01-09T00:00:00Z,"TOWNIES The courtroom is one of those quintessential New York situations where people are just cobbled together, trying to make sense of it all. Like an apartment building, it is a self-contained world, conforming to its own logic. The court attorneys, often former prosecutors who now counsel 200 or so people a day, shuffle in and out, jotting down the bare bones of people's sagas and stories, sifting through gripes and vituperations, offering advice on the fly. As in any court, the attorneys know the predilections of the judges: some don't like cyclists; another has a thing against dogs. One judge, a court officer told me, used to charge higher fines for people caught drinking imported beer than for those drinking domestic ones.-- ELIZABETH DWOSKIN, excerpt from ''Summoned by the Court Jester FIXES Brazil is employing a version of an idea now in use in some 40 countries,one already successful on an enormous scale. This is likely the most important government antipoverty program the world has ever seen. It is worth looking at how it works, and why it has been able to help so many people. The program fights poverty in two ways. One is straightforward: it gives money to the poor. This works. And no, the money tends not to be stolen or diverted to the better-off. The idea's other purpose -- to give children more education and better health -- is longer term and harder to measure. But measured it is.-- TINA ROSENBERG, excerpt from ''To Beat Back Poverty, Pay the Poor'' For more, nytimes.com/opinionator"

The Board of Trustees and Staff of the Whitney Museum of American Art note with deep sadness the passing of longtime Trustee, writer, advisor, and dear friend, B. H. Friedman. He will always be remembered for his love of art, language and books. Bob wrote the biography of the Museum's founder Gertrude Vanderbilt Whitney and numerous works on artists including an early biography on Jackson Pollock. His passion for the Whitney and American Art led to his appointment to the Whitney Board of Trustees in 1961, as one of the original non-family Trustees. B. H. lent his intellect and wisdom to the shaping of the institution for four decades serving as Chairman of the Whitney's first Building Committee and overseeing the planning and construction of our iconic Marcel Breuer Building. During his outstanding leadership of the Acquisitions Committee, the Museum's collection was enhanced by so many of the New York School of artists he befriended. When elected an Honorary Trustee in 1978, it was said that B.H. ""brought a dimension to our thinking, an insight, which is rare and precious.' This depth and his legacy will remain an indelible part of the Whitney. His presence will be sorely missed. Our most sincere and heartfelt sympathies to his daughter Daisy, his son Jackson, daughter-in-law Petra, and his grandchildren Oskar and Linea. Flora Miller Biddle, Honorary Chairman Leonard A.

Regional airports across the former Soviet Union tend to be a dreary lot, with all the appeal of a 24-hour bus station. But the one in Lviv, the largest city in western Ukraine, had wood paneling and ornate columns and the feel of a grand old railway station in a 1950s film. I was there last winter to cover the Ukrainian presidential elections, tromping through the snow to watch the candidates on the stump and to pester voters for their opinions. But I soon discovered that this city on the edge of the Soviet empire, at a crossroads of Europe, was a cobblestoned find. The unexpected beauty of the airport terminal was a hint of what Lviv offered -- winding streets that reflected the influences of centuries of overlapping cultures."

Joe came from humble beginnings in Brownwood, where his academic drive and basketball skills eventually earned him a full scholarship at Howard Payne University. After graduating, Joe gave back to his beloved home state as both a basketball coach and biology teacher. In the early 70s, his natural abilities in business carried him first to Dallas and later to Sydney, Australia, where he discovered the first designer denim: ""JAG"" jeans. He then opened the first ever jeans-only store in Beverly Hills, CA. After making his mark on the fashion world, Joe changed courses and went to work in finance for his mentor, Alan Greenberg, at the Los Angeles office of Bear Stearns. It was there that Joe's trademark tenacity, honesty and humility earned him the trust of those around him and allowed him to cultivate a thriving business and build precious friendships, both of which he lovingly nurtured for over thirty years. In addition to being a successful businessman and entrepreneur, Joe was a genuine bon vivant. Friends were always greeted with a warmhearted smile and notoriously good humor. In his free time, Joe loved to play golf and was an avid sports aficionado. Throughout his life, Joe remained proud of his modest roots and returned to Texas as often as he could. Joe is survived by his loving wife, Heyson Leach, and sons Skip Morelock Leach of Dallas and Scott Leach of Los Angeles. Predeceasing him were his parents Carl and Juanita Leach and brother Ronald Leach.

2011-01-09T00:00:00Z,"BELL--Sam, U.S. District Judge for the Northern District of Ohio, Inactive Status, died December 23, 2010, in Akron, Ohio. The only child of Marie Williams Bell and Samuel H. Bell was born in Rochester, NY, on a snowy New Year's Eve in 1925. A short time later the family moved to Akron, Ohio. Intelligent and evenhanded in his approach, Judge Bell treated those with whom he dealt with fairness and respect. And he listened, intently. Watching his mind work was like watching the twinkling facets of a turning crystal. His wit, his love of sports and Notre Dame, and his capacity for understanding humanity enhanced his intellectualism. He served on every level of the judiciary except the U.S. Supreme Court. When sitting as a trial judge, he always stood up when the jury entered his courtroom; not the reverse. ""A gift"" was the way he described his time as a federal judge. Though he took senior status to preserve a temporary judgeship for Akron and inactive status in 1998, the law continued to live for him. He team-taught with his wife, a lawyer and legal writing teacher, and others, a pre-law seminar at The College of Wooster, culminating in the Bell Lectureship in Law at The College of Wooster. He helped to found the Scanlon Inn of Court. Considered a Constitutionalist, he was an avid reader of history and visited many Civil War battlefields to study the logistics involved. Time spent outdoors with his wife Jennie, whether flyfishing, bicycling or walking local trails was relished by both. Preceded in death by his parents and his first wife, Joyce Shaw Bell, the mother of his sons, he is survived by his wife Jennie McCall Bell of Silver Lake, Ohio; sons Henry W. and wife and Steven D.; six grandchildren and two great-grandchildren. He shall be greatly missed by the Steven H. Mault family of Portsmouth, Ohio. Services have been held. Memorials may be made to the Bell Lectureship at the College of Wooster or to the Humane Society of Greater Akron, Ohio, or of your choice. His Quiet Strength was Magnificent.

Black Beauty, the automotive star of the cliff-hanging ''Green Hornet'' movie serial of the 1940s, scorched Mulholland Drive in Los Angeles as the car of the series' masked hero. Its speed, of course, was pure cinematic fantasy. But surpassing 200 m.p.h. in a production car eventually became a reality.

2011-01-09T00:00:00Z,"The giant snowstorm in December rekindled the irritation that is felt by many homeowners in the New York area, who after spending hours digging their cars out of six-foot-high snowbanks and driving to pick up groceries, return home to find a strange car parked in that just-cleared curb space. This is, perhaps, a minor inconvenience compared with the plight of residents whose cars get snowed in and stay snowed in for days after a storm, but it is nonetheless frustrating on an interpersonal level. My neighbors and I are all in the same snowed-in predicament - dig we must, drive we must. So at some point, all of us have to shovel out. Surely space usurpers know the toil and trouble and exertion necessary to create a car-length chasm in the mini-mountain of snow outside their front doors because they had to dig out their own cars?

So much of Italy is ancient, magnificent, priceless and also serviceable. When I was Rome bureau chief in the late '90s, I visited the Palazzo Farnese, a Renaissance palace designed by Antonio da Sangallo the Younger and Michelangelo. It was a busy place. It's the French embassy, and in the ambassador's office, junior diplomats smoked and fetched faxes underneath giant frescoes by Francesco Salviati and Taddeo Zuccari."

He was an instrumental part of the significant industrial growth of ITT Europe during the time of the legendary Harold Geneen and subsequently assisted Geneens successor, Rand Araskog, in the merger and subsequent sale of ITT Telecommunications to Alcatel of France. Fluent in four languages, he ran ITT's automotive and industrial companies throughout Europe. Mr. Chluski had quite a life before ITT. He was born in Warsaw, Poland in 1923 and educated in Poland, France and the UK. At the outbreak of WWII, he was captured by the Soviet army in 1939 and spent several months in a prison camp near Kieve, Ukraine. On his release he made his way by train and bicycle across Europe to North Africa where he survived in Algiers until Allied forces liberated the area in 1942. He volunteered to fight the Axis forces with the Americans and was subsequently selected and trained by the OSS as a paratrooper where he performed several drops behind enemy lines. After military service in WWII, he received a degree in economics at the City of London Polytechnic. He joined Harry Ferguson Ltd. in the UK as a shipping clerk in 1948. By 1968 and after working for the company in the UK, France and Canada, he became CEO of Massey Ferguson's North American operations based in Des Moines, Iowa. He joined ITT Corporation of New York, NY in 1972 and was placed in charge of their new automotive group based in Brussels, Belgium. Subsequently he was also given responsibilities of their Industrial Products and Electronic businesses, totaling over 50 companies and thousands of employees. In 1981, he was appointed Senior VP Executive Representative of the Chairman and CEO. In 1986 he was key negotiator for the sale of ITT's world telecommunications business to GCE (Alcatel). He retired as an employee at the age of 65 from ITT in 1986, but continued as an advisor to the Chairman and CEO of ITT until 1994. He was also appointed as Advisor to Chairman of Marceau Investissements based in Paris, France from 1988-2002. During this time, he also served as Chairman of the Advisory Board of Alexander Proudfoot Company worldwide from 1988-1995 and for IMT Consulting of Las Vegas, NV from 1996-2001.

2011-01-09T00:00:00Z,"In 1971, Earl Monroe was traded to the Knicks from the Baltimore Bullets, now the Washington Wizards. A flashy ball handler known as the Pearl, he joined Walt Frazier to form one of the most talented backcourts in N.B.A. history. They helped lead the Knicks to the championship in 1973. Monroe, whose No. 15 jersey was retired by the team in 1986, was inducted into the Basketball Hall of Fame in 1990. He was also named to the N.B.A.'s 50th-anniversary team in 1996. Monroe, Junior Bridgeman and George Gervin were honored recently for their service to the National Basketball Retired Players Association and the N.Y.U. Langone Medical Center at a benefit for the hospital's Center for the Study and Treatment of Pain.Q.How do you spend your time now?A.I have a multimedia company called Reverse Spin Entertainment that is involved with music, film and sports. I'm also a health advocate for Emblem Health and Merck.Q.How did you become involved with music?A.I've always been a music guy. My father used to sing and dance with Bessie Smith. I've been a fan of gospel, blues, R&B and pop. I love great voices, big hooks, melodies and lyrics that say something.Q.Do you have a favorite artist you've worked with?A.In 1983, I launched my first label, Pretty Pearl Records, with a guy from my alma mater in Winston Salem, N.C., by the name of Curtis Hairston. He was a phenomenal talent, and we had hit records in the U.S. and Europe. Unfortunately, at age 34, Curtis passed away.Q.What is your latest project?A.With my new label, Reverse Spin Entertainment, or R.S.E., I'm contemplating a tribute record to celebrate Curtis's legacy. R.S.E. also owns other masters and has an extensive publishing catalog which we endeavor to find opportunities for. With new signings, we're looking for talent outside of the mainstream and assisting them in building their careers.Q.Any thoughts about Solomon Burke, a friend of your family's, who died in October?A.Solomon Burke was a great talent and a fantastic singer. A member of the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame, he transcended generations of fans from his R&B days of songs like ''Everybody Needs Somebody to Love,'' to songs the younger folks were able to experience, like ''Crazy.'' He performed, acted and was a country music pioneer. When I was growing up in Philly, my cousin Margie used to bring him by the house. I thought he was a cousin of mine. I use to charge the kids in the neighborhood 10 cents just to come in the dining room to look at him. We have lost a giant, but we are blessed by the wonderful legacy he left behind.Q.What players do you enjoy watching now?A.I enjoy watching Kobe Bryant, LeBron James, Kevin Durant, Chris Paul and a few other players in the league. Most of the players I've mentioned are guards. They not only are great players, but they are leaders and set a good example for the youth. Q.How has the game changed since you were in the league?A.The game is faster up and down the court, and there are not as many back-to-the-basket big men. With the advent of so many underclassmen coming into the league, there is not the same continuity of play from experienced veterans and basketball I.Q.Q.What do you think about the officiating in today's game?A.The officiating is a little different in that with the pace of the game itself; referees have to be as much in shape as the players. Still I feel as when I played, I hate the refs. But over all, they do a good job.Q.What do you think about the new rule calling for technicals for overt gestures, like punching the air in anger, even if they are not directed at a referee?A.I think it's good for the game. You don't show up the refs, and it eliminates some of the heated exchanges that occur, not only between the players and refs, but also helps to keep the crowd in check. Especially my friend Spike Lee."

She cried when she showed me this poem, because it described the life that she felt so lucky to have: We met at the end of the party / When most of the drinks were dead / And all the glasses dirty: / ""Have this that's left,"" you said. / We walked through the last of summer, / When shadows reached long and blue / Across days that were growing shorter: / You said: ""There's autumn too."" / Always for you what's finished / Is nothing, and what survives / Cancels the failed, the famished, / As if we had fresh lives / From that night on, and just living / Could make me unaware / Of June, and the guests arriving, / And I not there. -Philip Larkin Karen, we love you and we will miss you forever.

2011-01-09T00:00:00Z,"Here's a reader comment on Jon Pareles's column about the new simplicity in pop music. ''They say the hardest ice cream to make is a truly great vanilla, because the recipe's simplicity shows any flaws in the ingredients or the maker's skill. I think the same is true with pop or rock music. Pop, unlike opera or classical, is a simple medium, basically three chords with a sung melody on top. The genius is in how you assemble them. Even a mature band working with full creative powers can still write beautifully simple music, such as U2's 'I Still Haven't Found What I'm Looking For,' from the album 'Joshua Tree.' That's pop at it's best. After all, we hum the melody, not the trills and fills.''"

Guest speakers, who included scholars, entertainers and business leaders, held court on its theme, ""New Tomorrows,"" while following the TED guidelines that have been a hallmark of the speaker series since its founding in 1984: adhering to 18-minute time limits to say their piece."

2011-01-10T08:59:31Z,"""The Social Network"" may have continued its sweep of professional opionators on Saturday when it earned the top prize (and more) from the National Society of Film Critics, but there were some surprises among the winners. The group, consisting of 61 writers from publications like Time, The Village Voice and The New Yorker, gave the best supporting actress award to Olivia Williams for her role as a political wife in Roman Polanski's ""The Ghost Writer."" She creamed her competition, getting substantially more votes than Amy Adams and Melissa Leo for ""The Fighter"" or Jacki Weaver for ""Animal Kingdom."" ""The Ghost Writer"" also placed in the screenplay and director category, which may mean that it has a better-than-a-dark-horse chance at the Oscars (a dappled horse?). The society does reveal its final tally, an unusual openness in the world of trophy-giving. For a closer look at what their numbers mean, check out The Hollywood Reporter's take. As Tim Appelo notes there, if Ms. Williams does win an Oscar, she will have to hand it over to Mr. Polanski - as she promised she would - because he's got a pretty clear vision for his performers. ""He acts the scene for you,"" she said. ""And if you don't copy what he does, he goes, 'No! Like this,' -- pause, movement, intonation, the works. So the prize for any performance really does go to Roman."""

Mr. Armstrong, the 38-year-old Green Day front man and guitarist and a co-writer of that Broadway musical adapted from his band's hit album of the same title, rejoined the show on Jan. 1 to resume the role of St. Jimmy, the pugnacious, drug-pushing alter ego of the protagonist, Johnny (portrayed by John Gallagher Jr.). (Charles Isherwood's review of Mr. Armstrong in ''American Idiot'' appears in Monday's New York Times.) But in the final minutes before showtime on Friday night, Mr. Armstrong took on other parts - from a nervous neophyte gingerly reviewing his notes from Michael Mayer, the musical's director and co-writer, to an extroverted jester prancing around the stage in a female co-star's sequined dress."

A funeral service will be held at Trinity Church, 33 Mercer Street in Princeton at 10:30am on Tuesday, January 11, 2011. Oleg Grabar was a distinguished scholar of Islamic art and architecture and a professor at the Institute for Advanced Study in Princeton, New Jersey (1990 1998), Harvard University (1969 1990) and the University of Michigan (1954 1969). Born in Strasbourg in 1929, he studied at the University of Paris, Harvard University (A.B. 1950) and Princeton University (Ph.D. 1955) and became a U.S. citizen in 1960. Professor Grabar was a prolific and inexhaustible scholar, teacher and author. He wrote more than 30 books in English and French, which have been translated into many languages, and more than 100 articles. The Formation of Islamic Art, first published in 1978, and the two-volume Pelican history of Islamic art and architecture are standards in the field, as are his monographs on the Dome of the Rock, the Alhambra and the Great Mosque of Isfahan. He was a mentor to several generations of scholars of Islamic art, an organizer of colloquia, scholarly organizations, journals and prizes, and the recipient of numerous honors. Most recently in November 2010, his life's work was recognized by the Chairman's Award from the Aga Khan Award for Architecture. Oleg Grabar's days were animated by a spirit of curiosity, energy and wonder, and by his gifts of enthusiasm and generosity towards his students, colleagues, friends and family."

A facialist's facialist if ever there was one, Chin has figured out how to buff, squeeze and laser even the most recalcitrant skin into its best showing. She's not been called ""Mean Christine"" for no reason: her facials are rigorous rather than soothing and may include the meticulous (and time-consuming) lancing of what she affectionately refers to as ""doughnuts"" - those sebaceous bumps under the skin that give it a regrettably bumpy appearance but are rarely bothered with by more massage-happy hands. Chin's knowledge and expertise don't come cheap and her Orchard Street salon isn't cozy or even spacious, but she's worth the trek. And now there's another reason to seek her out, even if you've never tried her services: Chin has come out with a new line - the Christine Chin Celebrity collection - that reinforces her beliefs. The result of four years of closely supervised work with a Swiss lab, the products include Nano Gold, a new type of gold particle, as well as active plant cells from Sequoia, Blue Lotus and Argan. They range in price from $48 for the superb cleanser and toner to $120 for the debris-busting gommage. For the complete list of available products for sale online, go to christinechin.com."

2011-01-12T00:00:00Z,"8 P.M. (TCM) HAPPY 101ST BIRTHDAY, LUISE RAINER Reared in Düsseldorf, Germany, and Vienna -- during a childhood she described as ''one of starvation, poverty and revolution'' -- Ms. Rainer distinguished herself on the Berlin stage in Max Reinhardt's company before heading in 1935 to Hollywood, where some imagined she might become the next Greta Garbo. Under contract to MGM, she had achieved fame by 1937 as the first back-to-back Oscar recipient in acting. ''Nothing worse could have happened to me,'' she said later of her subsequent inability to meet audience expectations in a succession of insignificant roles. After a failed marriage to the playwright Clifford Odets, she left MGM after only three and a half years and eight pictures, returning to film briefly in 1943 in ''Hostages'' for Paramount. Happily remarried to the British publisher Robert Knittel from 1945 until his death in 1989, Ms. Rainer appeared sporadically in television and onstage in London, where she lives, before making her 11-minute movie comeback at 86 in ''The Gambler'' (1997) as the wealthy grandmother of a family on the brink of ruin. This four-film tribute is introduced by ''Luise Rainer: Live From the TCM Film Festival'' (2011), featuring her April 2010 interview with Robert Osborne. ''The Good Earth'' (1937), Victor Fleming's adaptation of the Pearl Buck classic about Chinese farmers battling the elements, starring Ms. Rainer in her Oscar-winning role as the kitchen slave O-Lan, follows at 8:30. In ''The Great Ziegfeld'' (1936), at 11:30, Robert Z. Leonard's lavish biography of the starmaker Flo Ziegfeld (William Powell), she plays the French singer Anna Held, for which she earned her first Oscar. In ''The Great Waltz'' (1938), at 2:45 a.m., a film loosely based on the life of the composer Johann Strauss II (Fernand Gravet), she appears as the fictitious Poldi Vogelhuber, Strauss's wife. The night ends with ''Dramatic School'' (1938), at 4:30, with Ms. Rainer (above, proposing a toast), appearing alongside Lana Turner and Paulette Goddard, as a young actress struggling to find fame on the stage and success in her marriage to a titled Frenchman (Alan Marshal). 7:55 P.M. (Sundance) L'AUBERGE ESPAGNOLE (2002) Xavier Rousseau, an uptight Parisian student played by Romain Duris, moves into a communal apartment in Barcelona and soon learns the international language of love and friendship in this comedy from Cédric Klapisch.

In ''Bob Le Flambeur'' (1956), the first entry in a double bill by Jean Pierre Melville, starting at 10, Roger Duchesne stars as Bob Montagné, a pompadoured middle-aged gambler who stakes everything on a daring plan to rob a casino. In ''Le Doulos'' (1962), at 11:45, a young Jean-Paul Belmondo, dressed in trench coat and fedora, stars as Silien, a stylishly sinister Parisian hood hired by a recent parolee (Serge Reggiani) for a safe-cracking job."

2011-01-12T00:00:00Z,"Michael White and Chris Cannon have officially dissolved their high-flying, high-end restaurant partnership, following two months of silence after blog items and unceasing speculation in the food world fueled the rumors of a breakup. The Altamarea Group, the SoHo-based umbrella company for the restaurateurs' businesses, announced Monday in a three-paragraph statement that Mr. White and Ahmass Fakahany, the company's chief executive, ''have ended their partnership'' with Mr. Cannon, resulting in a division of their fast-growing empire. The former partners operated seven restaurants - Marea, Alto, Convivio, Osteria Morini and Ai Fiori in Manhattan, as well as Due Mari and Due Terre, both in New Jersey. The statement said that Mr. Cannon would continue to own and operate the Northern Italian-accented Alto and the Southern Italian-inflected Convivio, and would soon name new chefs for them. That's because Gordon Finn, the chef de cuisine of Alto, and Matt Adler, the chef de cuisine of Convivio, will be leaving the restaurants for Mr. White. ''They will stay until we can find replacements for them,'' Mr. Cannon said. Mr. White and Mr. Fakahany, both of whom declined comment, will continue to own and operate Marea, Osteria Morini and Ai Fiori, as well as Due Terre and Due Mari in New Jersey. According to the statement, ''all future ventures under the Altamarea Group name will be operated by the partnership of Fakahany and White,'' including the company's ''first international project due to open in late spring 2011 on the Hong Kong harbor.'' In prior interviews, Mr. Cannon, Mr. White and Mr. Fakahany said they had planned to collaborate in ventures in other American cities and Asia, and were to have explored the opening of casual takeout restaurants. No financial details of the breakup were disclosed. Rumors of the breakup were first reported in November on Eater. It took months to make the announcement due to ''the complicated situation with a lot of restaurants involved - untangling them,'' Mr. Cannon said.He declined comment on the reasons for the breakup, or on Mr. Fakahany, but said that ''I very much enjoyed working with Michael, and I will look upon the time with him very fondly.''"

''Until it secures A.G.M.A.'s consent, N.Y.C.B. may not conduct any tours which engage less than the entire company,'' the union said, adding that it mailed notice of its complaint to the company on Monday.

2011-01-12T00:00:00Z,"The Tuck Rule has lost a supporter, and not just anybody. Mike Pereira was the N.F.L.'s vice president for officiating from 2004-9, and spent the five seasons before that as the league's director of officiating. He joined Fox Sports this season as a rules analyst. It's in that capacity that he revisited a rule that has puzzled many fans (and infuriated some) for a decade. On Sunday, Chiefs quarterback Matt Cassel was tackled by the Ravens' Lardarius Webb while pulling the ball back to his body. The ruling was a fumble, and the Ravens recovered. After a challenge and review, the call was reversed to an incomplete pass. The call turned out not to matter -- the Ravens won easily, 30-7. But a Tuck ruling meant everything in 2002, when the Raiders recovered the ball but had to give it back to the Patriots in a snowy playoff game. At the time, Pereira defended the call, saying, ''Any time you're tucking the ball back toward your body, it's an incomplete pass'' and ''I may agree that Brady was not trying to throw the ball'' but ''he never controlled it long enough to consider him a runner.''"

He wants to keep everything as is for the enjoyment of the next generation.

O. Scott wrote in The New York Times of this movie from Olivier Assayas, which, Mr. Scott said, is about ''the curious alchemy that transforms certain objects into art.'' The film, ''as calm and quiet as its title, is in some ways his most coherent and complex exploration of the current shape of the world,'' Mr. Scott added. ''Don't be fooled by the apparent modesty of its ambitions. Sometimes a small, homely object -- a teapot, a writing desk, a sketchbook, a movie about such things -- turns out to be a masterpiece.'' 8 P.M.

Toklas'' (1968), at 11:45, Sellers is a henpecked Los Angeles lawyer who escapes into the world of hippies and free love; in ''What's New Pussycat?'' (1965), at 1:30 a.m., he's a psychiatrist to a fashion editor (Peter O'Toole) who can't stop beautiful women from pursuing him. And in ''After the Fox'' (1966), at 3:30, Sellers plays a notorious con man who poses as a film director to smuggle $3 million in gold bullion into Italy."

Aaron/ David became a successful business man first in Palestine, then in the newly formed Israel, where he was a fifth generation Israeli, and then in his adopted New York community. He was the CEO of Hi-Shear Industries (an NYSE-registered institution). He and his wife supported many Jewish institutions, including the Jewish Theological Seminary, North Shore Long Island Jewish Hospital, the UJA, the Solomon Schechter School, and Temple Beth Sholom in Roslyn Heights, where they endowed the David and Shoshanna Wingate Center. He was a powerful presence in many lives. His own life was shaped by the love of an extraordinary and wonderful woman, Shoshanna. All who knew them admired the deep love they held for each other and their amazing partnership throughout their sixty-seven years together. David and his adored Shoshanna forged a life built on hard work, sacrifice, commitment to family and a dedication to the welfare of the Jewish Community. They shared a great love of the arts and a circle of devoted friends. He will be remembered always by all those his life touched, and by all those who knew him for his delighted and welcoming smile. May his name be forever a blessing. May his name always be included among the names of the righteous. Services are at 11:30am on Tuesday, January 11 at Temple Beth Sholom, Rosyln Heights, NY.

We, the viewing audience, dive into Kevin Durant's past to watch an apparent time traveler pretend to inform Durant of his eventual N.B.A. fate. In the lack of real purpose, we're left to focus solely on the commercial's aesthetic, which is as bizarre as it is false.It's silly to ask how we -- along with our mystery traveler -- are transported to Rockville, Maryland circa 2005. After all, beyond a typical suspension of disbelief that accompanies the commercial medium, television ads are typically constructed in a serialized manner. In Television Culture, media scholar John Fiske described the serialized form as ""an infinitely extended middle,"" and in a sense, that's where these spots take (and leave) us. The year 2005 isn't a beginning in any sense for Durant, and we're not privileged to see the process by which our traveler makes his way into Durant's past. There's also no real attempt at ending or closure, marking the images we see as some sort of enduring middleness, a journey which we join in progress. If nothing else, such a structure reinforces that this tale we're witnessing is hardly our own."

2011-01-14T10:57:24Z,"I wonder periodically if there is some sort of mom-blog jinx. I was already an avid reader of blogs even before I was asked to create Motherlode, and now scrolling through several dozen of them each day is my professional routine. When you read so many you can't help noticing that very bad things have happened to a striking number of their authors. Some of this, of course, is because the Internet is now the place to turn when parents are struggling. That would explain many of the blogs that were started after -- after a father was paralyzed, or a mother died in childbirth or a husband drowned.But what strikes me is the number of times that tragedy found a blogger who just happened to be blogging. Stephanie Nielsen wrote mostly about life as the mother of four children until she and her husband were nearly killed, and Stephanie was horrifyingly burned, in a plane crash. Heather Armstrong was writing about work when she was blindsided by postpartum depression and blogged her way through a psychiatric hospitalization. The comic Daphne Brogdon's blog was about her blended family, until she lost her life savings to Bernie Madoff."

(1914) Plagued by repeated Equity work stoppages - something producer Henry Ford never encountered back in Detroit - the musical drama about the creation of the nation's first assembly-line automobile was delayed in previews first when the stage collapsed under the weight of an entire factory floor and again when one car rolled past its wheel chucks in the slanted orchestra pit, crippling a stagehand. On opening night, the synchronized starting of 300 two-stroke engines unleashed a cloud of smoke that hospitalized half the audience.

2011-01-15T00:00:00Z,"LOS ANGELES- Selling tickets to the afterparties is nothing. In a suit filed in Superior court in Los Angeles on Thursday, a former publicist for the Golden Globes alleges that the organization's members engaged in payola, accepting money and gifts from studios in exchange for nominating their films; sold red carpet space and media access at a profit; and received payment from studios to lobby their fellow Hollywood Foreign Press voters towards (or against) movies. The publicist, Michael Russell, who had worked with the association for 17 years, asked for $2 million in damages and lost wages, reported TheWrap.com. ''These actions perpetrate a fraud on the public, to which HFPA holds itself out as a charitable organization dedicated to recognizing excellence in film,'' the lawsuit read, according to the blog. The organization - whose president, Philip Berk, was also named in the suit, did not respond to a request for comment from The Wrap. As a publicist, Mr. Russell's job ''involved defending the HFPA from the very claims he now cites in his own lawsuit,'' Brent Lang writes in the blog. ''Many investigative stories over the years have singled out the organization for practices that might call into question its non-profit status; the organization has responded over the years by tightening its rules, but has not responded to criticisms that the organization is a closely-held clique that is almost impossible to join.''"

On October 16, 2010, Maynard Goldstein--the last surviving veteran of the Abraham Lincoln Brigade who fought at Jarama--spoke at a benefit event for the Archives of the Vets. He spoke passionately, bringing to life the streets of New York in the 1930's, the streets out of which he came and out of which came the seven other New Yorkers who crossed the Pyrenees with him, putting their lives on the line as they and three thousand other Americans tried to stop the spread of fascism. He spoke without hesitation. He spoke about the continued need to confront the forces of reaction. He spoke without notes. And he held the audience spellbound. Some one and one half months later he celebrated his 97th birthday. Happily? Not quite. Sadly? Not really. But he wasn't pleased with his increasing frailty and he missed Kate, his wife of sixty-eight years, no less an activist than he, who had died three years earlier. Having loving and appreciating friends and family did little to make up for her loss. And so did he go into and through his tenth decade, with all the losses inseparable from a long life, but pleased that his activism didn't stop with Spain. After all, his was the only unionized advertising agency in the City, something he insisted upon, something he brought to pass. His mind never faltered. No surprise then that he played bridge up to the last week of his life. A gathering to memorialize this most remarkable man will be held at his apartment in Manhattan, 300 East 74th Street, Apt. 15F on the 23rd of January, 2011. Festivities will begin at 1:00pm."

But even then La MaMa had for me the whiff of another time, the patchouli scent of the 1960s, when downtown theater was longhaired, renegade and rude. I wasn't around for that heady heyday of La MaMa, the willful, playful brainchild of Ellen Stewart, who died on Thursday. Yet what I saw in the East Village theater that January night in 1994 turned out to be not only absolutely of the moment but also of the future. It was a rough-hewn, rowdy, dirty little play called ''Stitches,'' put on by a brother-and-sister team that presumptuously called itself the Talent Family. Their real names? David and Amy Sedaris."

Peter Sarsgaard is David, the older man who introduces her to a world of art auctions and Champagne while appealing to the pretensions of her proper parents (Cara Seymour and Mr. Molina). But soon it's apparent that David and his fabulous life aren't quite what they seem, though that doesn't stop Jenny from playing along with the charade. ''It's not that she's out of control -- quite the contrary,'' A. O. Scott wrote in The New York Times about this film from Lone Scherfig, written by Nick Hornby and based on a memoir by Lynn Barber. ''She is deliberately and systematically, with what she imagines to be full knowledge of the consequences, seeking out what the vestigial Victorianism of her era would see as her ruin.'' He added, ''The filmmakers themselves seem too intoxicated by the mystique of the period to take full account of the sad, bleak aspects of the story they have to tell.'' Still, in the end, the film is ''a pleasure -- which I don't mean entirely as a compliment.'' 10:30 A.M. (13) RELIGION & ETHICS NEWSWEEKLY Kim Lawton reports on the Rev.

2011-01-16T17:35:22Z,"Almost 20 years ago now, in western Ecuador, I traveled with a team of extraordinary biologists studying a remnant of forest as it was being hacked down around us. Al Gentry, a gangling figure in a grimy T-shirt and jeans frayed from chronic tree climbing, was a botanist whose strategy toward all hazards was to pretend that they didn't exist. At one point, a tree came crashing down beside him after he lost his footing on a slope. Still on his back, he reached out for an orchid growing on the trunk and said, ""Oh, that's Gongora,"" as casually as if he had just spotted an old friend on a city street.The team's birder, Ted Parker, specialized in identifying bird species by sound alone. He started his work day before dawn, standing in the rain under a faded umbrella, his sneakers sunk to their high-tops in mud, whispering into a microcassette recorder about what he was hearing: ""Scarlet-rumped cacique a fasciated antshrike two more pairs of Myrmeciza immaculata counter-singing.

There are so many - where to start? Well, the group doesn't have a documentary category at all, for example. And as has been much noted, it entirely snubbed ""True Grit,"" the Coen brothers Western. Maybe they just have it in for the Coens? Last year's ""A Serious Man"" was also nearly ignored."

""Stay out of trouble,"" Mark Wahlberg, as always a big draw for fans, told a teenage boy after posing for a photo with him.

After a sneak peak for ""The Green Hornet"" was greeted with ridicule from fanboys last summer, Sony performed triage. The film, based on the 1930s radio serial and 1960s television show, was re-edited, new scenes were shot and the advertising plan was reworked. The upshot: While sales were on the squishy side for a 3-D release costing at least $110 million, ""The Green Hornet"" is far from the flop that many expected."

But others said that the Lightning had been merely sore losers and that the shootout - a skills contest tacked onto what was otherwise a tie game - was meant to entertain fans.

2011-01-16T00:00:00Z,"Carmelo Anthony, whom the Knicks are considering acquiring in a trade, is sometimes thought of as a selfish player. Indeed, he is the center of the Denver Nuggets' offense. When he is on the court for them, about 30 percent of their possessions end in Anthony's shooting, going to the foul line or committing a turnover. And he is not much of a passer: over his career, Anthony has accumulated 3.1 assists per 36 minutes played, considerably less than the average of other high-volume scorers like Kobe Bryant (4.6 assists per 36 minutes) or LeBron James (6.2)."

But a cherished annual ritual, finding calendars to organize and inspire me during the coming year, was lost to me this past holiday season, and I can't help wondering if it's because race is passe now, in these tough-but-equal times. I usually buy four calendars for home and one for work, and I always look forward to a visual feast - artwork, landscapes, beautifully printed snippets of wisdom - from which to choose. This year, I made an earlier than usual run on a major bookseller that carries an array of the two trends I favor: calendars informed by the spirituality of the East, and those informed by the artwork and images of people like me, a brown-skinned descendant of Africa. I forfeited the after-Christmas discount, feeling sure I'd find even more bounty."

He was a renowned speaker, writer, analyst and consultant to the banking industry. For over 30 years, he authored and published ""The Golembe Reports,"" a commentary on banking issues. Born in Liberty, NY in 1924, Mr. Golembe was a veteran of WWII, and was a recipient of the Purple Heart. Following his military service, he earned a doctorate degree in economics from Columbia College and a law degree from George Washington University. Dr. Golembe began his career in 1951 as a financial economist with the FDIC and subsequently was employed by the American Bankers Association. In 1966, he founded a banking research and consulting firm, headquartered in Washington, DC that was nationally known and described by the head of a major banking trade association as the ""Mercedes of the industry."" Following the sale of Golembe Associates in 1989, he was chairman of the board of The Secura Group in DC until 1994. In 1979, he founded the International Financial Conference (IFC), an educational corporation comprised of mid-size regional banks and other international financial institutions. He served as the executive manager of the IFC for 16 years and the senior advisor to its Board of Directors until 1998. He also served for 10 years as a director of Barnett Banks of Florida. During his lifetime, he was a frequent contributor to professional journals, as well as author of numerous publications, including his co-authorship of ""Federal Regulation of Banking."" His most recent book, ""But I Never Made a Loan,"" gave his take on the evolution and history of banking systems in the US. He was a true intellectual, yet could cut to the chase of a matter with his wit and insight.

2011-01-16T00:00:00Z,"REGAN--John M.,Jr., former Chairman and CEO of Marsh & McLennan Companies, Inc. and a highly respected business leader died Monday. He was 89 and a resident of Ocean Ridge, FL. Jack Regan, as he was known, began his career in New York in the Casualty department at Marsh & McLennan in 1946. He was made assistant manager of the Boston office in 1954 and manager of the New York office thirteen years later. A series of promotions led to his appointment as President of Marsh and McLennan Companies in 1972 and CEO the following year. During his thirteen-year tenure as CEO, the company diversified its businesses significantly and developed a strategy to expand its operations globally, resulting in an eightfold growth in the company's revenue and market capitalization. The international expansion advanced markedly with Marsh & McLennan's successful 1980 merger with C. T. Bowring, a Lloyd's-based UK brokerage house. Mr. Regan lived in New York for most of his career where he was active in professional, business and charitable organizations including the Inner-city Scholarship Fund and the Cardinal's Committee on Education for the Archdiocese of New York. He retired in June 1986. Mr. Regan graduated five months early from Yale University in January 1943 so that he could join the war effort. He served as a first lieutenant and platoon commander with the U.S. 22nd Infantry of the 4th Army Division during the Normandy campaign and was seriously wounded in action during the June 22, 1944 attack on Cherbourg. After what he referred to as ""gold-bricking"" in an English hospital, he returned to duty in a variety of capacities throughout Europe. He earned a Bronze Star and the Purple Heart and was discharged in 1946. Born in Minneapolis, MN on June 7, 1921, John M. Regan, Jr. was the eldest of three children of John M. and Philomena M. Regan. He attended St. Thomas Military Academy and graduated from Yale with honors. He also attended the Advanced Management Program at Harvard University's School of Business Administration. Mr. Regan served as a Trustee of Notre Dame University, Connecticut College, St. Vincent's Hospital and New York Law School and as a Director of Morgan Stanley Group, ACF Industries and the A. C. Nielson Company. He was a member of the Council on Foreign Relations, the Ocean Club of Florida, the Gulf Stream Bath and Tennis Club, the Misquamicut Club and the Watch Hill Yacht Club where he served as Commodore for four years. In addition to his wife of sixty one years, Prudence S. Regan, he is survived by two brothers Robert M. Regan of Minneapolis, MN and Richard F. Regan of Honolulu, Hawaii, six children including John M. Regan III of Watch Hill, RI, Deborah R. Edwards of Hartsdale, NY, Peter M. Regan of New Berlin, NY, R. Christopher Regan of Mendham, NJ, Prudence R. Hallarman of Lincolnshire, IL and William M. Regan of New York, NY and nine grandchildren. A private funeral will be held this week.

2011-01-16T00:00:00Z,"MARX--Helen Zanetti, known to her friends as Noonie, died on January 12, 2011, at home of an ovarian type cancer. She was 72. She confronted her illness with her usual dignity, and grace, and with a strength that may have surprised even her. She never showed a trace of self-pity. Her legendary sense of humor was intact to the end. The last few weeks of her life were peaceful. Her children were with her constantly. It was a time of coming together, a time of understanding, a time of love. Helen Zanetti was born in Bucharest, Romania, on Christmas Eve, 1938, to George (Pearson) and Enrique Carlos Zanetti. Her father, Enrique, was later the Chase Bank representative in Buenos Aires, where the family spent eight years and where Noonie attended the French Lycee. In 1956, she graduated from Miss Porter's School in Farmington, CT, and from Smith College in 1960. An only child, she made many close friends at school and kept them her entire life. She continued to make friends into her seventies, a rare feat. In the 1970s, she co-owned and ran a specialty retail store on Madison Ave., Thaxton & Co., and in 1987 started The Madison Avenue Fund for Children, a resounding charitable success to this day. Noonie was also deeply involved in and on the Board of The Big Sisters, a Catholic charity which started by mentoring girls who came through the New York Children's Court. In 1996 Noonie began a successful publishing career with her imprint, Helen Marx Books, which, in association with Turtle Point Press and Books and Co. made its mark with unusual, original, and distinguished titles, a few of them best-sellers in the small press category. In 2005, Noonie won the prestigious French- American Foundation Translation Prize for the novel Silbermann by Jacques de Lacretelle, wining over an important translation of Marcel Proust's The Guermantes Way. This year, her translation of The Princess, the King, and the Anarchist, which she also published and which has already sold out its run, has again been submitted for the Translation Prize. She was one of the original founders in 1971 of the Proust Group, a reading group now in its fortieth year. She acquired over many years an outstanding collection of American art. She loved music, was an inveterate concert and opera goer, and joined the Board of The Metropolitan Opera Guild in 1990, serving as Vice President from 1994-1996. Her paradise was Paris, a city she had come to love from childhood visits with her grandmother. During her last twenty years she made sure she spent part of each year in Paris, where she did much of her translating and, as usual, added a small army of new friends. A French friend said that Noonie was the only American she had ever known who spoke like a native French-person. She was proud of being able to read her favorite author, Proust, in French. She was a long-time member (57 years) of The Colony Club. She had beauty, a sharp intelligence, and worldliness, but it was her amazing capacity for friendship for which she will be remembered and missed. A truly kind and loving person has gone from our lives, and we will never have another friend like her. She is survived by her children Pearson, Lindsay, Louis, and Geoffrey Marx, her son-in-law Stephen Mark, and her grandsons Cal and Teddy Mailer. In lieu of flowers, donations may be made to The Children's Aid Society, 105 E. 22nd St., NY, NY 10010, or The Humane Society, 306 E. 59th St., New York, NY 10022.

I love it. There's actually a lot to debate -- though from the tone of some of the remarks, I hear what sounds like the us-and-them rhetoric of liberal and conservative pundits. Will I play Maddow to your Beck? Let's start with Bridget Foley's thoughtful front-page piece in Women's Wear Daily on Wednesday about the implications of fashion's populist swing toward celebrity, the Internet and mass-oriented deals with stores like H & M. Essentially, Ms. Foley argues that fashion has lost its mojo because high-end designers and companies -- which, by the way, she doesn't identify or properly hold accountable -- have fractured their own elite position. I would argue that some degree of philistinism has existed in fashion since designers and their clever business partners realized in the 1980s that they could generate quick cash by licensing their names.

2011-01-16T00:00:00Z,"GOLDSTEIN--Maynard, 2 December 1913-12 January 2011. On October 16, 2010, Maynard Goldstein--the last surviving veteran of the Abraham Lincoln Brigade who fought at Jarama--spoke at a benefit event for the Archives of the Vets. He spoke passionately, bringing to life the streets of New York in the 1930's, the streets out of which he came and out of which came the seven other New Yorkers who crossed the Pyrenees with him, putting their lives on the line as they and three thousand other Americans tried to stop the spread of fascism. He spoke without hesitation. He spoke about the continued need to confront the forces of reaction. He spoke without notes. And he held the audience spellbound. Some one and one half months later he celebrated his 97th birthday. Happily? Not quite. Sadly? Not really. But he wasn't pleased with his increasing frailty and he missed Kate, his wife of sixty-eight years, no less an activist than he, who had died three years earlier. Having loving and appreciating friends and family did little to make up for her loss. And so did he go into and through his tenth decade, with all the losses inseparable from a long life, but pleased that his activism didn't stop with Spain. After all, his was the only unionized advertising agency in the City, something he insisted upon, something he brought to pass. His mind never faltered. No surprise then that he played bridge up to the last week of his life. A gathering to memorialize this most remarkable man will be held at his apartment in Manhattan, 300 East 74th Street, Apt. 15F on the 23rd of January, 2011. Festivities will begin at 1:00pm."

Aaron/ David became a successful business man first in Palestine, then in the newly formed Israel, where he was a fifth generation Israeli, and then in his adopted New York community. He was the CEO of Hi-Shear Industries (an NYSE-registered institution). He and his wife supported many Jewish institutions, including the Jewish Theological Seminary, North Shore Long Island Jewish Hospital, the UJA, the Solomon Schechter School, and Temple Beth Sholom in Roslyn Heights, where they endowed the David and Shoshanna Wingate Center. He was a powerful presence in many lives. His own life was shaped by the love of an extraordinary and wonderful woman, Shoshanna. All who knew them admired the deep love they held for each other and their amazing partnership throughout their sixty-seven years together. David and his adored Shoshanna forged a life built on hard work, sacrifice, commitment to family and a dedication to the welfare of the Jewish Community. They shared a great love of the arts and a circle of devoted friends. He will be remembered always by all those his life touched, and by all those who knew him for his delighted and welcoming smile.

Mr. Rabanne, who is responsible for some acidic put-downs of his own, certainly lived up to the moniker with his ubiquitous chain-mail dresses of the 1960s. Less known, however, was his 69 bag from a collection of that year. Celebrating the designer's enduring vision of fashion, Comme des Garçons has teamed with Paco Rabanne to release nine variations on the bag, including versions in clear acrylic Perspex, pink metallic suede and black rubber. The 69 bags are priced from $965 to $2,200. Available exclusively at Comme des Garçons, 520 West 22nd Street; (212) 604-9200. EDWARD BARSAMIAN"

Atlanta's five-game winning streak was snapped by the Houston Rockets on Saturday night, and with it went a hot stretch in which Crawford put up 27.4 points a game and a 51.2 field-goal percentage. Known for his inconsistent shooting, Crawford has often been criticized for his risk-taking. Among his lowlights was the 2003-4 season, when he shot 38.6 percent from the field. Unfortunately for the Chicago Bulls, his team at the time, that percentage did not stop him from taking 16.5 shots a game.Since arriving in Atlanta last season, however, he has shown more discipline as a shooter - 44.5 percent for the season."

What if the ''tomorrow'' part manifested itself not just in the object (the car) but in new initiatives inspired by the broad national movement toward collaborative consumption?-- Excerpt from ''All Tomorrow's Taxis'' DISUNION With his compromise, Crittenden hoped to achieve a lasting peace-- not just a truce -- through a geographical and constitutional ''solution'' to the slavery crisis. First and foremost, Crittenden restored the Missouri Compromise line that had been nullified in1854 by the Kansas-Nebraska Act. By reintroducing this line, and extending it west to the California border, Crittenden hoped to restore the tenuous peace created by a clear geographical distinction between slavery and freedom. Slavery would be permanently prohibited north of this line, thereby reversing the Supreme Court's 1857 ruling that Congress had no right to regulate slavery in the federal territories. In territories south of this line, however, the federal government would have no say over slavery; instead, the decision to allow or prohibit slavery would be made by those living in the territories themselves.-- SUSAN SCHULTEN, Excerpt from ''Last Chance for Compromise''"

He subsequently served on the Frick Council and was elected to the Board in 2000. Mr. Seiden's enthusiasm and support for the Frick were boundless. Over the years, he provided substantial funding for numerous exhibitions and curatorial activities, typically in honor of friends or scholars whom he admired. His greatest pleasure however, was the Frick Art Reference Library, of which he was a tireless advocate and for which he started many book funds and helped to underwrite the Center for the History of Collection in America. We shall miss his extraordinary intelligence, judgment and dedication, and we extend our heartfelt sympathy to his wife, Janine Luke. Margot C. Bogert, Chairman, Anne L. Poulet, Director."

2011-01-16T00:00:00Z,"HOROWITZ--Dr. Louise S.,78, died peacefully at home on January 14, 2011, comforted by the constant attention of her children and close friends. Born January 24, 1932 to Charles Schwartz and Bertie Grad Schwartz, Louise graduated from Fieldston High School in 1950. She attended Smith College until her marriage to David Horowitz in 1951, and then transferred to Barnard College where she received her bachelor's degree with distinction in 1954. Louise's inquiring mind and critical skills drew her to pursue graduate work in philosophy at Columbia University. Continuing her studies while raising three children, Louise received her Ph.D. degree in 1969. She joined the faculty of Long Island University's Brooklyn Campus, where she specialized in teaching Philosophy of Art and, her personal favorite, Oriental Philosophy. Highly respected among students, Louise was the campus Women's Liberation Club advisor and was frequently asked to serve as a faculty chaperon for bus trips to Washington, D.C. anti-war demonstrations. Divorced in 1972, she soon met Alton Johnson, with whom she lived until his death in 2001. In 1977 Louise left teaching to enter New York Law School, where she graduated cum laude with her J.D. degree in 1981. She practiced law until shortly before her death, specializing in civil and commercial litigation in state and federal courts. With a lifelong interest in art, music, and the theater, Louise also was a painter and frequently attended opera, ballet, and dance performances. Committed to public service, she served for many years on the Metropolitan Center for Mental Health board, including president from 1984 to 2010, and as a member of the New York Public Library Board of Trustees from 1978 to 1984. Fervent in her opinions and always loving a good argument, Louise is remembered by her friends and family for her intellect, charm, and eminent hospitality. She is survived by her brother Ernest Schwartz, children Marilyn, Roger, and Diana, and grandchildren Jason and Lucy Horowitz. A memorial service to remember her life will take place on Monday, January 17, 9:30am at the Riverside Memorial Chapel, 180 West 76th Street. To recognize Louise's deep love for her home on Shelter Island, the family asks that in lieu of flowers, contributions be sent in her name to the Mashomack Preserve, PO Box 850, Shelter Island, NY 11964."

2011-01-17T00:00:00Z,"6. JETS (Wild card) at 2. PITTSBURGH STEELERS When these teams played in Week 15 at Heinz Field, the Jets came from behind, then held off a last-second Steelers drive, to win, 22-17. Until Sunday's victory over the Patriots, the win in Pittsburgh was the Jets' most complete game: with a balanced offensive attack, an error-free Mark Sanchez and a defense to keep their low-scoring offense in it. The Steelers were able to run and pass on the Jets, but Ben Roethlisberger was sacked three times. Against the Patriots in the divisional game, the Jets were similarly balanced. Sanchez settled down quickly and the Jets contained Tom Brady by playing back, keeping the offense in front of them and getting pressure without blitzing. Pittsburgh was depleted in Week 15, without safety Troy Polamalu, defensive lineman Aaron Smith and tight end Heath Miller. Those are key cogs for the Steelers, who will probably want to run on the Jets again(they had 146 yards in the regular-season game). The Jets will want to run, too, but that's a tough proposition if the Steelers' defense is healthy. They are first in the league against the run, allowing only 62.8 yards a game. The Jets rushed for 106 yards in their first meeting. PLAYER TO WATCH If Sanchez's passes are as erratic here as they were against the Colts, the Steelers' opportunistic defense could make him pay. He will have to be wary of Polamalu trolling the middle of the field. Sanchez and Braylon Edwards hooked up eight times in their last game against the Steelers, a game that proved Sanchez could play well in cold weather. National Football Conference 6. GREEN BAY PACKERS (Wild card) at 2. CHICAGO BEARS (North champion)Packers quarterback Aaron Rodgers has been otherworldly this postseason (49 of 63 for 546 yards, 6touchdowns, no interceptions), and he easilysolved the Falcons' defense. Jay Cutler cut down on his interceptions this season and Mike Martz, the Bears' offensive coordinator, finally seems content not to get him killed. Still, the Green Bay defense has been impressive, particularly late in the season, and it will go after Cutler. The question for the Bears, as it has been for each of the Packers' last few opponents, is if they can stay with the Packers' big-play offense. Ignore the scoring outburst against the Seahawks; it is hard to get much of a read on anything Chicago did against an opponent that looked so inept. The Falcons could not keep up, allowing Rodgers seven completions of at least 20 yards, and he was especially dangerous when he was outside the pocket. The Packers ranked 10th in points scored in the regular season; the Bears ranked 21st. Now we know why Chicago Coach Lovie Smith played his starters in the season finale in an effort to keep Green Bay out of the playoffs. After splitting games with the Packers this season, Smith probably knew this offensive explosion was coming. He will try to slow the Packers by running Matt Forte and hoping the Packers cannot block Julius Peppers. PLAYER TO WATCH Rodgers is creating his legend this season. When the Packers had no running game earlier in the season, he was virtually the sole offensive threat. Against the Falcons, he was practically flawless. He is trouble even outside the pocket and is difficult to bring down, so the Bears will have to finish sacks, not merely get pressure."

(13) DINOSAUR WARS In the summer of 1868 the paleontologist Othniel Charles Marsh, on board a Union Pacific train on a sightseeing excursion through the country's newly opened Western frontier, realized that he was traveling through the greatest dinosaur burial ground of all time. But he had competition in his fossil hunting from his fellow paleontologist Edward Drinker Cope. ''American Experience'' follows the men's efforts as they uncover the remains of dozens of prehistoric animals, including 130 species of dinosaurs; collect thousands of specimens; provide evidence to prove Charles Darwin's contested theory of evolution; and put American science on the world map. But their professional rivalry eventually got the better of them. What began as denigrating comments in science journals led to the destruction of fossils and political maneuverings that left both men alone and nearly destitute.

2011-01-17T00:00:00Z,"''The Green Hornet'' was No. 1 at North American theaters over the weekend with about $34 million in ticket sales -- proof that a studio, in this case Sony Pictures Entertainment, can fix a troubled movie on the fly. After a sneak peak for ''The Green Hornet'' was greeted with ridicule from fanboys last summer, Sony performed triage. The film, based on the 1930s radio serial and 1960s television show, was re-edited, new scenes were shot and the advertising plan was reworked. The upshot: While sales were on the squishy side for a 3-D release costing at least $110 million, ''The Green Hornet'' is far from the flop that many expected. The weekend was uglier for ''The Dilemma,'' a poorly reviewed comedy directed by Ron Howard -- yes, the Oscar-winning one -- that sold about $17.4 million for second place. The inauspicious debut for ''The Dilemma,'' which cost at least $70 million to make, adds to a track record for Universal Pictures that is increasingly troubling. ''True Grit'' (Paramount Pictures) was third with about $11.2 million for a total of $126.4 million, according to Hollywood.com, which compiles box office statistics. ''The King's Speech'' (the Weinstein Company) was fourth with about $9 million for a limited-release total of $44.6 million. ''Black Swan'' (Fox Searchlight), was fifth with $8 million, lifting its total to a $73 million."

2011-01-17T00:00:00Z,"MARX--Helen Zanetti, known to her friends as Noonie, died on January 12, 2011, at home of an ovarian type cancer. She was 72. She confronted her illness with her usual dignity, and grace, and with a strength that may have surprised even her. She never showed a trace of self-pity. Her legendary sense of humor was intact to the end. The last few weeks of her life were peaceful. Her children were with her constantly. It was a time of coming together, a time of understanding, a time of love. Helen Zanetti was born in Bucharest, Romania, on Christmas Eve, 1938, to George (Pearson) and Enrique Carlos Zanetti. Her father, Enrique, was later the Chase Bank representative in Buenos Aires, where the family spent eight years and where Noonie attended the French Lycee. In 1956, she graduated from Miss Porter's School in Farmington, CT, and from Smith College in 1960. An only child, she made many close friends at school and kept them her entire life. She continued to make friends into her seventies, a rare feat. In the 1970s, she co-owned and ran a specialty retail store on Madison Ave., Thaxton & Co., and in 1987 started The Madison Avenue Fund for Children, a resounding charitable success to this day. Noonie was also deeply involved in and on the Board of The Big Sisters, a Catholic charity which started by mentoring girls who came through the New York Children's Court. In 1996 Noonie began a successful publishing career with her imprint, Helen Marx Books, which, in association with Turtle Point Press and Books and Co. made its mark with unusual, original, and distinguished titles, a few of them best-sellers in the small press category. In 2005, Noonie won the prestigious French- American Foundation Translation Prize for the novel Silbermann by Jacques de Lacretelle, wining over an important translation of Marcel Proust's The Guermantes Way. This year, her translation of The Princess, the King, and the Anarchist, which she also published and which has already sold out its run, has again been submitted for the Translation Prize. She was one of the original founders in 1971 of the Proust Group, a reading group now in its fortieth year. She acquired over many years an outstanding collection of American art. She loved music, was an inveterate concert and opera goer, and joined the Board of The Metropolitan Opera Guild in 1990, serving as Vice President from 1994-1996. Her paradise was Paris, a city she had come to love from childhood visits with her grandmother. During her last twenty years she made sure she spent part of each year in Paris, where she did much of her translating and, as usual, added a small army of new friends. A French friend said that Noonie was the only American she had ever known who spoke like a native French-person. She was proud of being able to read her favorite author, Proust, in French. She was a long-time member (57 years) of The Colony Club. She had beauty, a sharp intelligence, and worldliness, but it was her amazing capacity for friendship for which she will be remembered and missed. A truly kind and loving person has gone from our lives, and we will never have another friend like her. She is survived by her children Pearson, Lindsay, Louis, and Geoffrey Marx, her son-in-law Stephen Mark, and her grandsons Cal and Teddy Mailer. In lieu of flowers, donations may be made to The Children's Aid Society, 105 E. 22nd St., NY, NY 10010, or The Humane Society, 306 E. 59th St., New York, NY 10022.

""Paradis,"" at Johann König Galerie in Berlin Kreuzberg, shows large-format prints of a naked Charlotte Rampling with an equally naked Raquel Zimmermann, rambling about the Louvre and posing alongside the Mona Lisa and a marble Napoleon. Originally published in the French magazine Paradis in 2009 and shown at Lehmann Maupin in New York the same year, the images have lost none of their beauty or inherent shock factor. Teller's other, much smaller, show in Berlin is equally revealing. Located in an ingeniously designed third-floor space run by the Berlin-based 032c Magazine, the exhibition comprises new work that Teller has simply called ""Men and Women."" An image of a naked Vivienne Westwood, broadly grinning and with her legs splayed, presides over the show like a regal cross between Annie Sprinkle and Marie Antoinette, while next to her the photographer William Eggleston, photographed at home in Memphis, and Teller's own 9-year-old son, Ed, photographed in the gym of a hotel in the Maldives, seem goofily adrift. ""It's really a show about impotence,"" remarked a guest at the opening on Saturday night. ""In the middle you have Vivienne, all powerful and sexual, and to the left and to the right you have an old man who can't really do it anymore, and a young man who can't do it yet.""

2011-01-18T00:00:00Z,"SEIDEN--Melvin R.,age 80, died of a massive brain hemorrhage on January 14, 2011. The eldest son of Katherine and Murray Seiden, Mel attended schools in New Jersey and graduated from Harvard College (1952) and Harvard Law School (1955). He served in the Navy from 1955-1958 and retired as a Lieutenant. Mel was inspired by the life of Paul J. Sachs who, after a successful career at Goldman Sachs, became an associate director of the Fogg Art Museum at Harvard. Mel started in the investment field at Loeb Rhoades & Co. (1958-1961), then founded Seiden & deCuevas (1962-1986). He was chairman of several venture capital funds in the 1970's. Mel was also a trustee of various Merrill Lynch mutual funds and investment companies from 1981-2002, and he was most recently a consultant and director of Edge Management. After retiring from active work in the financial field, he devoted himself to art and philanthropy. As he was colorblind, he developed a special interest in drawings, cartoons (New Yorker) and caricatures (Al Hirschfeld) and most recently illuminated medieval manuscripts, all of which he collected on behalf of institutions. His philanthropic activities were centered at Harvard, including Villa I Tatti, The School of Public Health and various art museums and libraries. He also derived enormous pleasure, and made great friends, at the Fidelity Charitable Gift Fund in Boston where he was a trustee from 2004-2010. His New York philanthropies were centered at The Morgan Library, where he was on several visiting committees; The Frick Collection, where he was a trustee; and The Childrens' Aid Society, where he was also a trustee and helped develop programs to counter obesity and teenage pregnancy. He supported art by financing catalogues and exhibitions around the globe from The Shanghai Art Museum, The Ambrosiana in Milan, the Museums of Scotland, The Albertina in Vienna, British libraries and museums. Mel had an iconoclastic turn of mind, an astonishing memory and delightful wit. He was kind and thoughtful in conversation and a wonderful companion, friend and mentor. In addition to legions of friends, he leaves his wife, Janine Luke, three sisters, numerous nieces and nephews and his devoted associates, Bea Pappagallo and Chiquita Harding, all of whom colored his life and provided love and fun. There will be a Memorial Service at a later date. In lieu of flowers, memorial donations to any of the New York charities listed below would be appreciated: The Childrens' Aid Society, Attn: Richard R.

The eldest son of Katherine and Murray Seiden, Mel attended schools in New Jersey and graduated from Harvard College (1952) and Harvard Law School (1955). He served in the Navy from 1955-1958 and retired as a Lieutenant. Mel was inspired by the life of Paul J. Sachs who, after a successful career at Goldman Sachs, became an associate director of the Fogg Art Museum at Harvard. Mel started in the investment field at Loeb Rhoades & Co. (1958-1961), then founded Seiden & deCuevas (1962-1986). He was chairman of several venture capital funds in the 1970's. Mel was also a trustee of various Merrill Lynch mutual funds and investment companies from 1981-2002, and he was most recently a consultant and director of Edge Management. After retiring from active work in the financial field, he devoted himself to art and philanthropy. As he was colorblind, he developed a special interest in drawings, cartoons (New Yorker) and caricatures (Al Hirschfeld) and most recently illuminated medieval manuscripts, all of which he collected on behalf of institutions. His philanthropic activities were centered at Harvard, including Villa I Tatti, The School of Public Health and various art museums and libraries. He also derived enormous pleasure, and made great friends, at the Fidelity Charitable Gift Fund in Boston where he was a trustee from 2004-2010. His New York philanthropies were centered at The Morgan Library, where he was on several visiting committees; The Frick Collection, where he was a trustee; and The Childrens' Aid Society, where he was also a trustee and helped develop programs to counter obesity and teenage pregnancy. He supported art by financing catalogues and exhibitions around the globe from The Shanghai Art Museum, The Ambrosiana in Milan, the Museums of Scotland, The Albertina in Vienna, British libraries and museums. Mel had an iconoclastic turn of mind, an astonishing memory and delightful wit. He was kind and thoughtful in conversation and a wonderful companion, friend and mentor. In addition to legions of friends, he leaves his wife, Janine Luke, three sisters, numerous nieces and nephews and his devoted associates, Bea Pappagallo and Chiquita Harding, all of whom colored his life and provided love and fun. There will be a Memorial Service at a later date. In lieu of flowers, memorial donations to any of the New York charities listed below would be appreciated: The Childrens' Aid Society, Attn: Richard R. Buery, Jr., 105 East 22nd St., New York, NY 10010; The Frick Collection, Attn: Anne Poulet, 1 East 70th St, New York, NY 10016; The Morgan Library, Attn: William M.

2011-01-19T00:00:00Z,"HOROWITZ--Dr. Louise S.,78, died peacefully at home on January 14, 2011, comforted by the constant attention of her children and close friends. Born January 24, 1932 to Charles Schwartz and Bertie Grad Schwartz, Louise graduated from Fieldston High School in 1950. She attended Smith College until her marriage to David Horowitz in 1951, and then transferred to Barnard College where she received her bachelor's degree with distinction in 1954. Louise's inquiring mind and critical skills drew her to pursue graduate work in philosophy at Columbia University. Continuing her studies while raising three children, Louise received her Ph.D. degree in 1969. She joined the faculty of Long Island University's Brooklyn Campus, where she specialized in teaching Philosophy of Art and, her personal favorite, Oriental Philosophy. Highly respected among students, Louise was the campus Women's Liberation Club advisor and was frequently asked to serve as a faculty chaperon for bus trips to Washington, D.C. anti-war demonstrations. Divorced in 1972, she soon met Alton Johnson, with whom she lived until his death in 2001. In 1977 Louise left teaching to enter New York Law School, where she graduated cum laude with her J.D. degree in 1981. She practiced law until shortly before her death, specializing in civil and commercial litigation in state and federal courts. With a lifelong interest in art, music, and the theater, Louise also was a painter and frequently attended opera, ballet, and dance performances. Committed to public service, she served for many years on the Metropolitan Center for Mental Health board, including president from 1984 to 2010, and as a member of the New York Public Library Board of Trustees from 1978 to 1984. Fervent in her opinions and always loving a good argument, Louise is remembered by her friends and family for her intellect, charm, and eminent hospitality. She is survived by her brother Ernest Schwartz, children Marilyn, Roger, and Diana, and grandchildren Jason and Lucy Horowitz and Andrew Hendrix. A memorial service to remember her life will take place on Monday, January 17, 9:30am at the Riverside Memorial Chapel, 180 West 76th Street. To recognize Louise's deep love for her home on Shelter Island, the family asks that in lieu of flowers, contributions be sent in her name to the Mashomack Preserve, PO Box 850, Shelter Island, NY 11964."

Gerard (Jerry) 81, prominent economist who spent the bulk of his career at the University of Pennsylvania, died Saturday, January 15 in Newton, MA of complications related to pancreatic cancer. He was the author of a substantial body of research over a distinguished career. After spending 37 years at the University of Pennsylvania, he moved to Northeastern University in Boston. He completed his final teaching assignment there this last December, 2010. Prof. Adams was born in Breslau in 1929. His family emigrated to the United States in 1939. He attended the University of Michigan, receiving an undergraduate degree in 1949 and then continuing on to obtain a Ph.D. in 1956 under the supervision of Lawrence Klein, who subsequently went on to win the Nobel Prize in Economics. In 1961, he joined Klein, who had moved to the University of Pennsylvania, where he remained until 1998. He helped Klein to create the Wharton Model, one of the first econometric forecasting models using computers to simulate the world economy. It subsequently grew into the Link Model, which forecasts the economy using a variety of input data from smaller models around the world, and which contributed to Klein's Nobel Prize in 1980. Prof. Adams served as the director of the Economics Research Unit at the University of Pennsylvania and a principal investigator on the Link Model. Together with Klein, he was one of the founding members of Wharton Economic Forecasting Associates.

2011-01-19T00:00:00Z,"8:15 P.M. (Sundance) WOMEN WITHOUT MEN (2009) The visual artist Shirin Neshat is celebrated for her explorations of women's lives in Islamic societies. In this, her directorial debut, she follows four Iranian women from different classes and backgrounds during August 1953, when elements in favor of the monarchy ousted Mohammed Mossadegh and his democratically elected government and restored Shah Mohammed Reza Pahlavi to power, with the help of clandestine support from Britain and the United States. Zarin (Orsi Toth) is an emancipated prostitute who has fled her brothel for refuge at a public bath; Munis (Shabnam Tolouei, above) is a virtual prisoner in the house she shares with her fundamentalist brother, whom the religiously devout Faezeh (Pegah Ferydoni) secretly longs to marry; and Fakhri (Arita Shahrzad), a wealthy 50-year-old, is suffering in an unhappy marriage to a general who reviles her for being menopausal. ''This visually transfixing film, which originated as a video installation, has the feel of an exhibition of Ms. Neshat's work whose figures have stirred to life to play out a tragic feminist allegory,'' Stephen Holden wrote in his review in The New York Times. The film is loosely adapted from a novel by Shahrnush Parsipur, who appears briefly as the bossy madam of the brothel. 8 P.M.

Most recently, he made a gift to the Yale School of Management that will allow Yale to begin the construction of the new unified campus and building for the Yale School of Management. The building will be known as Edward P. Evans Hall. Mr. Evans' greatest joy was racing thoroughbred horses and breeding thoroughbreds at his farm in Casanova, Virginia known as Spring Hill Farm. He bred over 100 stakes winners and as of his death was the 4th leading breeder and 7th leading owner in North America. Ned was consistently named as one of the Top 10 breeders in North America. His horse Quality Road was one of the favorites for the 2009 Kentucky Derby and won or placed in 12 out of 13 starts. Quality Road was injured before the 2009 Derby and was unable to compete in any of the Triple Crown races in that year.

Though I'm going to dedicate this post to selectively recapping the comments and seeing what perspective we can wring out of them, it won't be my last word on the subject. And some of the comments I neglect here will influence future posts. Some of you took pains to emphasize that information technology is, over all, a pretty good thing for small businesses. As Josh Patrick pointed out in his comment, it can be ''a life saver'' that allows operating at much lower costs, enough to tip a company into profitability. And crucially, noted Erwin Susara, it has ''leveled the playing field'' with big companies in some ways, especially in terms of market reach -- and maybe even by allowing small companies to get ahead of the big guys by adopting new technologies more quickly, added Kalen."

2011-01-20T00:00:00Z,"LAZARUS--Leonard, passed away Saturday, January 15, 2011 at his home in Manhattan. He was 100 years old. Born on January 21, 1910, Leonard lived and loved life for over a century. He nurtured and cherished all his colleagues, friends and loved ones. Leonard was a self-made man. He actively practiced law into his 90s. He was a bright lawyer with a gift for bringing both allies and adversaries together to make ""things work."" He was a mentor to many lawyers and a man of his word and handshake. For over 70 years Mr. Lazarus played a part in the resurgence after World War II of the real estate markets in Manhattan, Queens and Long Island, engaging in a successful private practice with a schoolmate Richard Klugherz. Mr. Lazarus was born in the Bronx to German immigrants, had one brother Edward, and a sister, Nettie, both of whom predeceased him. When Leonard was very young, his father, Henry, took them to North Adams, MA because there was work there in its factories and mills. Leonard's father contracted TB and upon the doctor's advice relocated to the Adirondacks in Saranac Lake. Leonard's mother, Lillie, was very resourceful and found a place big enough, with land, to run a boarding house and for her husband to run a kosher chicken and egg business. His father was one of the first in the area to save enough money for a new Ford delivery truck, and the few Jewish families in the area loved to patronize such an enterprise. At a young age Leonard helped his parents. He had the largest paper route in the neighborhood and took furs to the rail station for a furrier. His respect for hard work, people and the love he developed for nature, while living, hiking and canoeing in the Adirondacks stayed with him throughout his life. Many years later he gave more than one hundred and fifty acres to a land trust in the Adirondacks to preserve nature from development. Mr. Lazarus' father died two days after his high school graduation so proud of his son who was the first person in the family to graduate high school. He won the state championship on the debating team and was Publisher and Treasurer of his yearbook. After his father's death, the family relocated back to the Bronx where his mother opened a family grocery business where Leonard worked. One of the customers, Rose, became his first wife. Leonard won a state scholarship to Columbia University at sixteen. He worked for the New York Times and became a soda fountain man in a movie house that showed the first talkie movie with Al Jolson, and then became the manager of the cafeteria at Columbia. While in college, Leonard befriended August Gold, a friendship which lasted a life time. In later years, August persuaded Leonard to support and invest in affordable development projects in Ossining, NY. After graduation from Columbia University School of Law during the depression, Leonard made fast friends with an older respected lawyer named Mr. Lochen who saw Leonard's potential. Leonard represented the bus driver's union, three to four hundred men on strike, and conducted labor negotiations with Mayor La Guardia. Mr. Lazarus was a conscientious objector; however he served in the Army for two years in his capacity as an attorney stationed at the Pentagon. After the Army, he lived and practiced law in Jamaica, Queens. He became associated with William Edwards, a real estate entrepreneur, who convinced Mr. Lazarus to move his law practice to Long Island and open an office in Mineola. Mr. Lazarus was instrumental in the development, leasing and sale of many buildings. A project of which he was most proud was Sheldon Solow and his building, The Solow Building at Nine 57th Street, the legendary Manhattan skyscraper designed by Skidmore, Owings and Merrill, and built in 1974. Mr. Lazarus also was a partner in the Americana Mall, a luxury destination shopping mall in Manhasset, Long Island. He enjoyed working with Steve Hess Associates, William Edwards, Milt Levin, the Castagna Family, among other businesses from Long Island. He consulted with the late Fred Trump, the Parker family and the LeFraks. Mr. Lazarus married Rose Lazarus in 1936. They lived in New York for almost fifty years. Rose was an accomplished pianist and teacher. After a tragic car accident took Rose's life in 1986, Leonard remarried a longtime friend, the widow of one of his friends from college, Henrietta (Hindy) Creamer, an accomplished economist, interior decorator and artist. Mr. Lazarus was a supporter of numerous charitable foundations, including Columbia University, C.A.R.E., Saranac Lake High School and Central Park Conservancy, Inc. Mr. Lazarus is survived by two sons, Frederic Lazarus of Bradenton, FL and David Lazarus of Queensbury, NY; three grandchildren, Dana, Nicole and David Paul as well as a recent newborn great-grandchild, Annabel Rose, all from Queensbury, NY. He also leaves his sister's children, his niece Iris Greenwald Hamburger and her husband Jerome Hamburger of Lawrence, NY and his nephew, Richard Greenwald and his brother Edward's children, his nieces Susan Qubein and Ellen Lazarus. He is also survived by his close friend and companion, Denise Bibro, and all of his caretakers who loved and took care of him for many years. Funeral services are being arranged with the Campbell Funeral Chapel on Madison Avenue, New York City. A memorial will be planned in the near future. For information you may call: 212-288-3500. In lieu of flowers, a contribution to one of Mr. Lazarus' favorite charities or a similar charity of your choice will be appreciated."

He is survived by two brothers Thomas M. Evans, Jr. and Robert S. Evans, his niece, Ashley Evans and his nephews Jonathan Evans, Thomas M. Evans, III and Mark Johnson Evans. Ned graduated from Yale University in 1964 and earned an MBA from Harvard Business School in 1967. He had a long and successful business career beginning in 1968, holding executive positions with a number of family businesses. In 1980, Ned became Chairman and CEO of MacMillian, Inc. Beginning in 1988, he became involved with personal business interests and investments including breeding and racing thoroughbred horses. Ned was also known as a generous philanthropist. He formed the Edward P. Evans Foundation and contributed to a number of charitable organizations in various fields throughout the United States. Most recently, he made a gift to the Yale School of Management that will allow Yale to begin the construction of the new unified campus and building for the Yale School of Management. The building will be known as Edward P. Evans Hall. Mr. Evans' greatest joy was racing thoroughbred horses and breeding thoroughbreds at his farm in Casanova, Virginia known as Spring Hill Farm. He bred over 100 stakes winners and as of his death was the 4th leading breeder and 7th leading owner in North America. Ned was consistently named as one of the Top 10 breeders in North America. His horse Quality Road was one of the favorites for the 2009 Kentucky Derby and won or placed in 12 out of 13 starts. Quality Road was injured before the 2009 Derby and was unable to compete in any of the Triple Crown races in that year. The Thoroughbred Owners and Breeders Association named Ned the Virginia Breeder of the Year nine times, most recently in 2009, and the National Breeder of the Year in 2009. Services will be private. In lieu of flowers, donations may be made to Aplastic Anemia & MDS International Foundation, 100 Park Avenue, Suite 108, Rockville, MD 20850."

2011-01-20T00:00:00Z,"Batman has found a nemesis for his next cinematic adventure - and, it appears, a love interest, too. On Wednesday, Warner Brothers Pictures announced a new cast member and the role of another in ''The Dark Knight Rises,'' the third Batman movie to be directed by Christopher Nolan, the ''Inception'' and ''Memento'' filmmaker. Joining Christian Bale, who returns as Batman and his daytime alter ego, Bruce Wayne, is Anne Hathaway (of ''Love and Other Drugs'') who will play Selina Kyle; the film will also feature Tom Hardy, a co-star of ''Inception,'' as the villain Bane. As comic-book fans know, the Selina Kyle character is the secret identity of Batman's sometime paramour (and sometime foe) Catwoman, and Bane is a muscular bad guy powered by an addictive drug called Venom. But a news release from Warner Brothers gave no descriptions of how these characters would be utilized in Mr. Nolan's film. Mr. Nolan said in a statement only that Ms. Hathaway was ''a fantastic addition to our ensemble as we complete our story'' and that he was ''delighted to be working with Tom again and excited to watch him bring to life our new interpretation of one of Batman's most formidable enemies.''"

But as record stores have vanished and people have turned to digital music -- according to Nielsen SoundScan, digital downloads now account for 46 percent of all music purchases, including both full albums and individual tracks -- sales of full albums have fallen. And fallen. For students of the music industry, the weekly album chart can be a grim read, as the numbers hit historic low after historic low."

Using critical moments captured by Mr. Drew and his associates, Albert Maysles, D. A. Pennebaker, Richard Leacock, Hope Ryden and James Lipscomb, the film follows Kennedy as he meets with union workers as a fledgling candidate; watches approvingly as his wife, Jacqueline Bouvier Kennedy, gives a stump speech; strategizes with staffers about election tactics; deals with the Soviet Union and Nikita S. Khrushchev during the Cuban missile crisis; and works with his attorney general, his brother Robert F. Kennedy, during a showdown with Gov.

Often one would be buttoned across the neck for extra warmth, but because that interrupted the shape (particularly a problem if any battle medals happened to be hanging there), a second lapel was needed to cover the chest."

2011-01-21T00:00:00Z,"FERNANDO--Laura Mahnil (nee Sumanadasa) was born on April 14, 1940, in London, England. Her father, L.H. Sumanadasa, and mother, Miriam de Mel, were from Ceylon (known today as Sri Lanka). Her father was an aeronautical engineer working in England for the Royal Air Force. In 1943, after years of war, her parents decided to return to Ceylon. They were part of a convoy of thirteen ships that set sail. Their ship was separated from the convoy during a terrible storm. German submarines torpedoed the convoy, and in the end because of the storm, theirs was the only ship to make it home safely. Laura Mahnil used this as an allegory as she bravely fought cancer these past two years. Laura Mahnil attended Ladies' College in Colombo. She then completed her licentiate from the Royal Schools of Music in piano performance, training under Ithalie de Saram. She married C.K. Fernando in 1965, and they promptly moved to New York, as her husband was chosen as a Fulbright scholar to pursue graduate study at NYU in physical therapy. Laura Mahnil began studying under Joseph Raieff, Professor at the Juilliard School. She won first prize in the 1969 Open Piano Competition of Radio Ceylon. She eventually chose to sacrifice her career in performance to bring up her children. While living in New York, she and her husband had two daughters, Netasha and Tanya, and later while living in Denmark, they had a son, Rajiv. In 1974, the family moved to the Chicago area. Laura Mahnil started teaching piano, and taught a whole generation of students in the Hinsdaleak Brook area. She was active in the music circles, and was a member and President of the Hinsdale Music Club. In 1996, she and her husband moved to Naples, Florida. She continued to be active in music. She played for services at the Unitarian Congregation of Naples, and was on the board of the Naples Music Club. She also began to perform again. She performed both solo concerts, playing with the Naples Orchestra and Chorus, and music for two pianos with concert pianist, Richard Bosworth. They performed in Naples, Chicago, as well as Colombo, where they gave a charity concert for Mallika Home for Elderly Women, an organization founded in part by her grandmother, Laura de Mel. Laura Mahnil's grace, beauty, goodness, and gift of music will continue to touch all those who knew and loved her. She is survived by a loving husband, Dr. C.K. Fernando; three devoted children, Netasha Scarpiniti, Tanya Fernando, and Rajiv Fernando; two beloved grandchildren, Anthony and Giana, and son-in-law, Frank Scarpiniti; three adoring siblings, Lelani Chinnadurai, Ananda Sumanadasa, and Madera Gunewardane; and a cherished community of family and friends. Memorial services will be held in Oak Brook, Illinois and Naples, Florida. The family kindly requests that in lieu of flowers, donations be made to the Laura Mahnil Fernando Memorial Fund for Cancer Care: Harris Bank, 141 West Jackson Blvd., Main Floor, Chicago, Il 60604."

The show's 10th season, which began Wednesday on Fox with new judges, looked more like an older woman's fantasy - a Nancy Meyers movie about the revenge of the scorned first wife. The introduction of the new stars, Jennifer Lopez and Steven Tyler, was labored, long and almost painfully lighthearted, like a divorced husband awkwardly presenting the new wife to his grown but unforgiving children. And all the while, over on CBS, Paula Abdul, who was replaced as an ''Idol'' judge last season by Ellen DeGeneres, shimmered, preened and gloated on her own reality contest, ''Live to Dance.''"

(CBS) MEDIUM After seven seasons and a move from one network to another, this series ends with Allison (Patricia Arquette, above with Enrique Murciano) and Joe (Jake Weber) being pulled in different directions -- and their family forever changed -- when she becomes a lawyer, and he starts a new job. 7:20 P.M. (Starz) 2012 (2009) The director Roland Emmerich ''cracks the planet like a nut, splitting its crust, toppling its mountains and cities, and laying its every creeping thing to inevitable tedious waste,'' Manohla Dargis wrote in The New York Times about this doomsday drama. Woody Harrelson plays the fellow who has predicted it all, taking his cue from a Maya prophecy. The cast is rounded out by John Cusack as a divorced dad and Amanda Peet as his eye-rolling ex; Danny Glover as the American president; Chiwetel Ejiofor as a sort of mad scientist; Oliver Platt as a sleazy White House aide; and Thandie Newton as the president's daughter. ''Mr. Harrelson looks like he's actually having the kind of good time stupid movies should provide but that this one roundly fails to deliver,'' Ms. Dargis said. ''Despite the frenetic action scenes, the movie sags, done in by multiple story lines that undercut one another and by the heaviness of its conceit.''"

Yes, you read that right: Mr. Mason, the comedian, actor and monologist, has his own reasons for awaiting the official opening of ''Spider-Man,'' after what will have been at least five delays of its opening night and more than 100 preview performances. On that day, Mr. Mason will no longer hold what appears to be the record for the most previews performed by a Broadway show before its opening, set in 1969 when his play ''A Teaspoon Every Four Hours'' played 97 previews - and then closed on its opening night."

2011-01-22T00:00:00Z,"You may not have realized that the balloon dog you bought for a buck from a street clown might be a collector's item. But the artist Jeff Koons, who constructed a 10-foot tall ''Balloon Dog'' that has been exhibited in the Metropolitan Museum of Art and elsewhere, sent a cease-and-desist letter to a Canadian manufacturer and San Francisco gallery for producing and selling ''Balloon Dog'' bookends. Now the gallery, Park Life, has asked a federal court for a declaratory judgment that states the canine shape cannot be copyrighted, according to Courthouse News Service. ''As virtually any clown can attest, no one owns the idea of making a balloon dog, and the shape created by twisting a balloon into a dog-like form is part of the public domain,'' the gallery says in its federal complaint. ''Any similarities between the Balloon Dog Bookend compared with the Balloon Dog Structure are driven by the wholly unprotectable idea of depicting the shape of a balloon dog in a solid form.'' This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print."

The reconstructed theater, in the Southwark section of London, announced what it calls a ''Cultural Olympiad,'' in which all of the plays will be performed, each in a different language. The idea is to present a theatrical counterpart to the Olympic games which are scheduled to take place in London that year. In a statement Dominic Dromgoole, the Globe's artistic director called it ''a terrifically clear and simple and slightly bananas idea'' that would demonstrate Shakespeare's international appeal. The roster, scheduled to begin on Shakespeare's birthday, April 23, includes ''The Tempest'' in Arabic, ''Titus Andronicus'' in Cantonese, ''Julius Caesar'' in Italian, ''Henry VIII'' in Spanish and ''Taming of the Shrew'' in Urdu. A performance of ''Love's Labour's Lost'' in British sign language is also planned. ''His plays have been translated into every major living language,'' Mr. Dromgoole said, ''and there is a long tradition of Shakespeare performances around the world in people's own vernacular.''"

2011-01-22T00:00:00Z,"Pep Boys-Manny, Moe & Jack is considering a sale of the company, according to a person with direct knowledge of the matter. Pep Boys, the auto-parts chain based in Philadelphia, has hired Bank of America to seek out potential buyers, said this person, who spoke on condition of anonymity because he was not authorized to speak publicly about the matter. It is unlikely that another company will acquire Pep Boys. Instead, a likely buyer would be a large private equity firm like Apollo Global Management or Bain Capital. A sale of Pep Boys would be the latest signal that corporate boards have confidence in executing mergers and acquisitions amid a revived credit market and a stable stock market. At the same time, private equity firms are awash with cash that they are looking to put to work. On Thursday, DealBook reported that Warner Music Group is on the auction block. J. Crew, the retail chain, announced a deal last year to be acquired by TPG, the private equity firm. Shares of Pep Boys traded higher Thursday after Bloomberg first reported the company was in play. In midday trading Friday, Pep Boys shares rose $2.42, or 19.6 percent, to $14.74. That gives the company a market value of about $775 million. Pep Boys was founded in 1921 by Emanuel ''Manny'' Rosenfeld, Maurice ''Moe'' Strauss, Moe Radavitz and Graham ''Jack'' Jackson with a single store in Philadelphia. Today it has more than 600 locations across the country that sell auto parts and provide repair services. The auto-parts retailing business is fiercely competitive, with the largest players being AutoZone, Advance Auto and O'Reilly Automotive.

2011-01-23T00:00:00Z,"My husband has a major birthday coming up in March. To celebrate, I would like to take him for a long weekend within about four hours' drive from New York City. I am looking for a romantic inn with a comfortable lounge and fireplace and good food at a rate of less than $300 a night. We prefer small places rather than large resorts. We don't ski but would like to be close to some good hiking (providing there is not too much snow) or some interesting place to visit. Do you have any suggestions? Wendy Johnson, New YorkA.I loved the Waybury Inn (wayburyinn.com) in East Middlebury, Vt., at the base of the Green Mountains, where I stayed in October. The drive from New York is five hours but well worth it, since it will meet your needs: it is romantic, with a comfortable lounge and fireplace, and has excellent dining options; doubles, with bathroom, start at $130. The 13 rooms vary in size and decor; I stayed in the sumptuous Robert Frost room - he was a frequent diner at the inn - with a sitting area and a Jacuzzi in the bathroom; in the room, you'll also find the ''secret'' wooden box with hundreds of letters written by past guests - reflections on life - which can easily take up hours of your time."

Elizabeth was born in Buffalo, NY on August 20, 1937 and was the daughter of the late Louis Dribben and Clara Franklin. A graduate of Lafayette High School (Buffalo) and University of Buffalo, ""Liz"" enjoyed a four-decade career encompassing almost every aspect of broadcast news from writing to producing to on-air reporting, both locally on Buffalo's WKBW-TV and nationally for CBS News, in both radio and television. A pioneer among women in her field, Dribben continued to mentor younger reporters in her capacity as a member of the Adjunct Faculty of the Graduate School of Journalism at Columbia University. At CBS from 197293, Dribben was principal writerproducer for Mike Wallace and Dan Rather, and produced her own program, One on One, eventually racking up some 2000 in-depth interviews with newsmakers in politics and the arts, from jurist Robert Bork to actress Helen Hayes. Her passion for theatre was legendary. She created and managed the network's (and the world's) first satellite radio unit. Ms. Dribben was a 2001 inductee of the Buffalo Broadcasting Hall of Fame, and a 2008 inductee to the Lafayette High School Hall of Fame. While she leaves no immediate family, she is survived by cousins in Albany, New York City and Israel, with her ""family of friends"" intertwined world-wide throughout the broadcasting and performance arts world. Elizabeth's generosity extends beyond her life, with the donation of her body to the Albert Einstein College of Medicine. Contributions in her memory may be made to the University at Buffalo (Attn: Cindy Johannes E. Dribben Archives, P.O.

Gerard (Jerry) 81, prominent economist who spent the bulk of his career at the University of Pennsylvania, died Saturday, January 15 in Newton, MA of complications related to pancreatic cancer. He was the author of a substantial body of research over a distinguished career. After spending 37 years at the University of Pennsylvania, he moved to Northeastern University in Boston. He completed his final teaching assignment there this last December, 2010. Prof. Adams was born in Breslau in 1929. His family emigrated to the United States in 1939. He attended the University of Michigan, receiving an undergraduate degree in 1949 and then continuing on to obtain a Ph.D. in 1956 under the supervision of Lawrence Klein, who subsequently went on to win the Nobel Prize in Economics. In 1961, he joined Klein, who had moved to the University of Pennsylvania, where he remained until 1998. He helped Klein to create the Wharton Model, one of the first econometric forecasting models using computers to simulate the world economy. It subsequently grew into the Link Model, which forecasts the economy using a variety of input data from smaller models around the world, and which contributed to Klein's Nobel Prize in 1980. Prof. Adams served as the director of the Economics Research Unit at the University of Pennsylvania and a principal investigator on the Link Model. Together with Klein, he was one of the founding members of Wharton Economic Forecasting Associates. He was the author of over 250 research articles and over a dozen books, including ""The Business Forecasting Revolution,"" ""East Asian Development: Will the East Asian Growth Miracle Survive?,"" ""Macroeconomics for Business and Society,"" ""The E-Business and the New Economy,"" and ""East Asia and the New Economy."" He submitted the manuscript for his newest book ""Globalization and the New Economy"" in December. Prof. Adams is survived by his wife Heidi Vernon, his brothers Peter Adams and Robert Adams, his four children Leslie Martin, Colin Adams, Loren Burton, and Mark Adams, his stepchildren Joshua Wortzel and Jennifer Stiller, his ten grandchildren, and his cats Minou and Maomi, all of whom will miss him greatly.

She was born near Shenyang, in Northeast China. Her father, Tung Jing-Cheng (also named Hsu-Tsong), was a Confucian scholar, and her mother, Grand Duchess Wang Shou-Kun, was the founder and head of a girls school. Professor Tung, as she liked to be called, graduated from Harbin Normal College for Women, and was the first Government sponsored graduate student to attend Ochanomizu Women's University in Tokyo. To escape the massacres during the Chinese Civil War, she, together with her three infant sons, sought refuge in Japan. There she established herself as a respected professor of Chinese Culture and Literature at Keio University. To supplement her modest academic salary in order to raise her three sons, she wrote poetry, translated books and movie subtitles, and taught Chinese cooking at home and on television. After sending each of her sons to the United States for high school, she joined them there, taught at American University in Washington, D.C., and worked as a researcher in the Chinese Collection of the U.S. Library of Congress. As a daughter of a Confucian scholar, she memorized the Chinese Classics, and even in her 90s she would recite Tang poems and passages from the Analects. She was proudest of her three sons-number one son, Roger Ko-Chih, graduated from St. Louis High School in Honolulu and Dartmouth College and received his Ph.D. from the University of Stockholm, and just retired as Regional Director of the UNESCO Institute for Statistics, Asia-Pacific Region; number two son, Alan Ko-Jen (known by his Japanese name Katsumi Tanaka), graduated from Phillips Academy, Andover, Harvard College and Harvard Law School, and is a business man in Hawaii, an advisor specializing in US-Asia transactions, and a well-known commentator on political and economic affairs; and number three son, Barry Ko-Yung, graduated from Phillips Academy, Andover, Harvard College, Harvard Law School, attended the University of Tokyo, is an international lawyer practicing with Morrison & Foerster and a visiting lecturer and senior research scholar at Yale Law School, and served as the Vice President and General Counsel of the World Bank.

(13, 49) BIRDS OF THE GODS The depths of New Guinea's rainforest are inhabited by birds of unimaginable color and beauty, with plumes so fabulous that when Europeans first saw them in the 16th century, they believed the creatures were heaven-sent and called them birds of paradise (above, the Raggiana bird of paradise). The people of New Guinea say the birds possess supernatural powers. But to find these birds, and to witness their extraordinary mating displays, is next to impossible.

2011-01-23T00:00:00Z,"A century ago, Israel Zangwill popular- ized the term in his play, ''The Melting Pot.'' From a Lower East Side rooftop, the protagonist proclaimed, ''What is the glory of Rome and Jerusalem, where all nations and races come to worship and look back, compared with the glory of America, where all races and nations come to labor and look forward?''New York has evolved into a greater crucible of race and ethnicity today than it was back then, but the city also remains very much a mosaic -- a variegated montage of neighborhoods in which certain groups predominate.In a month or so, the 2010 census will most likely confirm a record high in the city's foreign-born population. American Community Survey data released last month revealed a striking metamorphosis during the last decade. Traditional ethnic enclaves sprawled into adjacent communi- ties. Once monolithic tracts of white and black and native-born residents have become bespeckled with newcomers.Nearly 700,000 foreigners have settled in the city.

2011-01-23T00:00:00Z,"It has long been a cliché that muscle bulk doesn't equate to intelligence. In fact, most of the science to date about activity and brain health has focused on the role of endurance exercise in improving our brain functioning. Aerobic exercise causes a steep spike in blood movement to the brain, an action that some researchers have speculated might be necessary for the creation of new brain cells, or neurogenesis. Running and other forms of aerobic exercise have been shown, in mice and men, to lead to neurogenesis in those portions of the brain associated with memory and thinking, providing another compelling reason to get out at lunchtime and run. Since weight training doesn't cause the same spike, few researchers have thought that it would have a similar effect. But recent studies intimate otherwise. Several studies involve animals. It's not easy, of course, to induce a mouse or a lab rat to lift weights, so the experimenters have to develop clever approximations of resistance training to see what impact adding muscle and strength has on an animal's brain. In a study presented at the annual meeting of the Society for Neuroscience in November, researchers from Brazil secured weights to the tails of a group of rats and had them climb a ladder five sessions a week. Other rats on the same schedule ran on a treadmill, and a third group just sat around. After eight weeks, the running rats had much higher levels of brain-derived neurotrophic factor (B.D.N.F.), a growth factor that is thought to help spark neurogenesis, than the sedentary rats. So did the rats with weights tied to their tails. The weight-bearing rats, like the runners, did well on tests of rodent learning and memory, like rapidly negotiating a water maze. Both endurance and weight training seemed to make the rats smarter."

2011-01-23T00:00:00Z,"LAZARUS--Leonard, passed away Saturday, January 15, 2011 at his home in Manhattan. He was 100 years old. Born on January 21, 1910, Leonard lived and loved life for over a century. He nurtured and cherished all his colleagues, friends and loved ones. Leonard was a self-made man. He actively practiced law into his 90s. He was a bright lawyer with a gift for bringing both allies and adversaries together to make ""things work."" He was a mentor to many lawyers and a man of his word and handshake. For over 70 years Mr. Lazarus played a part in the resurgence after World War II of the real estate markets in Manhattan, Queens and Long Island, engaging in a successful private practice with a schoolmate Richard Klugherz. Mr. Lazarus was born in the Bronx to German immigrants, had one brother Edward, and a sister, Nettie, both of whom predeceased him. When Leonard was very young, his father, Henry, took them to North Adams, MA because there was work there in its factories and mills. Leonard's father contracted TB and upon the doctor's advice relocated to the Adirondacks in Saranac Lake. Leonard's mother, Lillie, was very resourceful and found a place big enough, with land, to run a boarding house and for her husband to run a kosher chicken and egg business. His father was one of the first in the area to save enough money for a new Ford delivery truck, and the few Jewish families in the area loved to patronize such an enterprise. At a young age Leonard helped his parents. He had the largest paper route in the neighborhood and took furs to the rail station for a furrier. His respect for hard work, people and the love he developed for nature, while living, hiking and canoeing in the Adirondacks stayed with him throughout his life. Many years later he gave more than one hundred and fifty acres to a land trust in the Adirondacks to preserve nature from development. Mr. Lazarus' father died two days after his high school graduation so proud of his son who was the first person in the family to graduate high school. He won the state championship on the debating team and was Publisher and Treasurer of his yearbook. After his father's death, the family relocated back to the Bronx where his mother opened a family grocery business where Leonard worked. One of the customers, Rose, became his first wife. Leonard won a state scholarship to Columbia University at sixteen. He worked for the New York Times and became a soda fountain man in a movie house that showed the first talkie movie with Al Jolson, and then became the manager of the cafeteria at Columbia. While in college, Leonard befriended August Gold, a friendship which lasted a life time. In later years, August persuaded Leonard to support and invest in affordable development projects in Ossining, NY. After graduation from Columbia University School of Law during the depression, Leonard made fast friends with an older respected lawyer named Mr. Lochen who saw Leonard's potential. Leonard represented the bus driver's union, three to four hundred men on strike, and conducted labor negotiations with Mayor La Guardia. Mr. Lazarus was a conscientious objector; however he served in the Army for two years in his capacity as an attorney stationed at the Pentagon. After the Army, he lived and practiced law in Jamaica, Queens. He became associated with William Edwards, a real estate entrepreneur, who convinced Mr. Lazarus to move his law practice to Long Island and open an office in Mineola. Mr. Lazarus was instrumental in the development, leasing and sale of many buildings. A project of which he was most proud was Sheldon Solow and his building, The Solow Building at Nine 57th Street, the legendary Manhattan skyscraper designed by Skidmore, Owings and Merrill, and built in 1974. Mr. Lazarus also was a partner in the Americana Mall, a luxury destination shopping mall in Manhasset, Long Island. He enjoyed working with Steve Hess Associates, William Edwards, Milt Levin, the Castagna Family, among other businesses from Long Island. He consulted with the late Fred Trump, the Parker family and the LeFraks. Mr. Lazarus married Rose Lazarus in 1936. They lived in New York for almost fifty years. Rose was an accomplished pianist and teacher. After a tragic car accident took Rose's life in 1986, Leonard remarried a longtime friend, the widow of one of his friends from college, Henrietta (Hindy) Creamer, an accomplished economist, interior decorator and artist. Mr. Lazarus was a supporter of numerous charitable foundations, including Columbia University, C.A.R.E., Saranac Lake High School and Central Park Conservancy, Inc. Mr. Lazarus is survived by two sons, Frederic Lazarus of Bradenton, FL and David Lazarus of Queensbury, NY; three grandchildren, Dana, Nicole and David Paul as well as a recent newborn great-grandchild, Annabel Rose, all from Queensbury, NY. He also leaves his sister's children, his niece Iris Greenwald Hamburger and her husband Jerome Hamburger of Lawrence, NY and his nephew, Richard Greenwald and his brother Edward's children, his nieces Susan Qubein and Ellen Lazarus. He is also survived by his close friend and companion, Denise Bibro, and all of his caretakers who loved and took care of him for many years. Funeral services are being arranged with the Campbell Funeral Chapel on Madison Avenue, New York City. A memorial will be planned in the near future. For information you may call: 212-288-3500.

2011-01-23T00:00:00Z,"SHRIVER--Sargent. The world has lost a treasured and most valuable human being, Sargent Shriver. A man of great faith and eternal optimism, he served our nation and changed the lives of millions as a public servant. The D'Urso family was blessed to know Sargent Shriver, his beloved wife Eunice Kennedy Shriver and their children as special, dear friends. We extend our heartfelt sympathy and dearest love to their devoted children, Maria, Robert, Timothy, Mark and Anthony, as well as their 19 grandchildren and all of the Shriver and Kennedy families. The Roman Catholic faith that was born in his childhood home and nurtured as an altar boy serving Mass for the Sulpicians at St. Mary's in Roland Park, Maryland became the driving force of Sargent Shriver's incredible life of service to his country and his fellow man, his eternal hope for the future and his compassion for humanity. Sargent Shriver was truly an American hero who cared for the least among us, was a voice for the voiceless, and inspired the best in all of us. Embodying St. Benedict's rule, ""Ora et Labora"" - Pray and Work - Sargent Shriver was a daily communicant at Mass who spent each day of his life tirelessly working for the betterment of humanity. As Founding Director of the Peace Corps, architect of the War on Poverty, U.S. Ambassador to France, advocate for the Special Olympics with his beloved wife and founder, Eunice, and now their son Timothy, and in his countless other good works for justice and peace throughout the world, Sargent Shriver's vision, unbridled enthusiasm and charismatic leadership were born of love, the Love of Christ and reverence for the sanctity of each human life. Msgr. John Patrick Carroll-Abbing, founder of Boys Town of Italy in Rome wrote, ""The secret of happiness is to love, but the essence of love is to serve."" The United States has lost a treasure, but, surely Heaven has gained a saint. A devoted husband and father, Sargent Shriver's dedication to public service was matched only by his love for his family. May Sargent Shriver's legacy live on in the service, vitality, faith, hope and love of a new generation, a legacy already embodied in the works of service of his amazing children. Sargent Shriver had a well-worn Rosary. Let us remember to pray daily to Divine Mercy, which the world so needs, and to say often ""JESUS, I TRUST IN YOU!"" -- The Holy Family -""Help me to live by the example of the Holy Family united in respect and love with all mankind. Bless me, my friends, and family, that by drawing close to You, we may come closer to each other. Protect us from all evil, and bring us to everlasting life. We ask this through Our Lord, Jesus Christ. Amen."" The D'Urso family shared Sargent and Eunice Kennedy Shriver's great love for Blessed Mother Teresa who said, ""The World today is Hungry not only for Bread, but Hungry to be Loved."" She also said, ""If we Pray, we will Believe. If we Believe, we will Love. If we Love, we will Serve."" In gratitude for his heroic, unselfish life, Florence D'Urso and her family, who also serve the poorest of the poor throughout the world, will make a contribution to the Special Olympics in India in memory of our dear friend, Sargent Shriver."

2011-01-23T00:00:00Z,"The look that dominates high fashion in New York is a long stretch of leg, ankle boots and a new posture. Every era has a defining stance, and at present, it is standing with your legs crossed, like a model or a dancer en pointe. The key to the look is the ankle boot, some with platforms and stiletto heels. Christian Louboutin's signature designs with red soles are at right. What pushed the silhouette to the top was the discarding of heavy-looking knee-high boots for the showgirl display of shapely legs."

2011-01-23T00:00:00Z,"KING--Marcia Gygli. Noted artist of San Antonio, Texas and New York, passed away January 18, 2011 after a long battle with leukemia. Mrs. King was born in Cleveland, Ohio June 4, 1931 to Robert and Ruth Farr Gygli. She attended Laurel School in Shaker Heights, Ohio and received a BA in English from Smith College. She did post graduate work at the Corcoran School of Art in Washington, DC and received a Master of Fine Arts from the University of Texas San Antonio. Mrs. King moved from Texas to New York City in 1979 as her art career prospered but she continued to return to her home in San Antonio throughout her life and lived at home in San Antonio in her final years. In 2009, her 40 year Retrospective of work was on display simultaneously at three institutions in San Antonio: San Antonio Museum of Art, Southwest School of Art and Craft and the University of Texas at San Antonio. She spent her summers in Sagaponack, New York, where she painted, enjoyed the beach and the special light of Long Island with her family and friends. She had numerous one-person and group shows at galleries, museums and colleges and received wide-spread critical acclaim. Her work can be seen in museums such as the Guggenheim and Brooklyn Museums in New York, Newark Museum, Cleveland Museum of Art, San Antonio Museum of Art, McNay Museum of Art and National Museum of Women in the Arts in Washington, DC. She also sold to private collectors around the world and notable corporate collections such as Clear Channel Communications, Goldman Sachs, Phillip Morris, British Petroleum, Continental Life Insurance and others. The art critic Grace Glueck commented recently on her work: ""Marcia King was a dynamic and inventive artist who shunned trendy art world modes and movements to focus on her own vision. Her passionate paintings, tempered by humor, covered a broad range, from tumultuous landscapes to keenly-observed floral specimens; from deeply-felt portrayals of humans and animals to salient narratives of the human condition. As she worked, she developed ingenious techniques to enhance her expansive large-scale images, notably that of surrounding them with exuberant frames that became part of the painting, often spilling over into the viewer's space. What she did, she did with deep conviction; she was an artist who would not be swayed from her own humanistic path.'' Mrs. King was an energetic person who loved life, her family and many friends. She had wide-ranging interests including art, style, business and philosophy. She enjoyed long walks and bike rides with her two sons and her five grandchildren whether in Texas or Long Island. Her family and its history were important to her and she researched her roots back to Switzerland where she arranged a trip with her two boys to meet their distant Swiss cousins. She is survived by her loving sons Rollin W. King, Jr. of San Antonio and Edward P. King and daughter-in-law Wendy D. King of Dallas, her five grandchildren Ann E., Ellie, Rollin III, Prescott and Charlie King and her niece Lynn Gygli MacDougall of Newport Beach, California. A memorial service will be held at St. Luke's Episcopal Church in San Antonio, Texas on Friday, January 28th at 4:00pm. In lieu of flowers donations in her memory may be made to MD Anderson Cancer Center-AML Research in Houston www.MDAnderson.org, McNay Art Museum in San Antonio www.McNayArt.org, or the Marcia Gygli King Endowed Scholarship in Art at the University of Texas at San Antonio www.UTSA.edu."

2011-01-23T00:00:00Z,"WHO says youth is wasted on the young? Lily Kwong, 22, is a sociology and urban studies major at Columbia who is also a sometime fashion blogger and Elite model. She previously did stints at GQ and worked as the studio director for her cousin, the emerging designer Joseph Altuzarra. She also works with her father on a social media and educational gaming company. It makes sense, then, that when she collaborated on a shoot with her photographer friend Elle Muliarchyk, the pair's point of departure was fittingly baroque. ''Maybe it's because I had recently been to the Met,'' Ms. Kwong said, joking, ''but we were inspired by Old Masters paintings -- everything from the light to the gestures -- and David Lynch movies. We really wanted to marry the two.'' What, no digital component? ''Actually,'' she says, ''it was shot in the apartment of Cindy Gallop, the social entrepreneur behind IfWeRanTheWorld.com.''

For over 60 years Dorothy was the devoted and adored wife of Murray Feiss. She was an extraordinary mother, grandmother, great-grandmother, sister, aunt and great-aunt. Dorothy was born in the Bronx, New York on January 23, 1928 and lived her entire life in New York, first as a homeowner in New Rochelle and for the past 30 years in Purchase, New York. Dorothy made an indelible impression on everyone who met her, as evidenced by the overflowing mourners at her service on Sunday, January 16th at her beloved Temple Shaaray Tefila, in Bedford Corners, New York. Her Rabbi, repeatedly described her as the richest woman he knew, because she was always content with what she had and valued everyone so dearly. She was seen by anyone who met her as the happiest, friendliest most loving woman who always saw the world with a positive outlook and imbued everyone around her with the feeling that they were special and could accomplish anything they wanted to. Dorothy didn't simply have friends, she had fans. Dorothy was at Murray's side as together they built a business, traveled the world, practiced a life of philanthropy and ""shepped nochas"" from children, grandchildren and great-grandchildren. Dorothy passed suddenly and peacefully on Saturday January 15th. To honor Dorothy's memory her husband Murray and her children Andrea and Robert Greene and June and Ron Hersh ask that anyone wishing to make a donation do so to the The Dorothy and Murray Feiss Foundation, 4 Orchard Drive, Purchase, New York 10577. She will be missed, cherished, remembered and loved forever."

One group that has been particularly hard hit by the recession is youth. Among workers aged 16 to 24, the unemployment rate is almost 20 percent. For young Latinos, it's over 24 percent, and for young African Americans, it's over 32 percent. Some 4.4 million youths are currently unemployed.This is of serious concern to a country with a rapidly aging population.

''It makes me think of how much we operate every single day on faith and belief,'' regardless of any connection to organized religion. Ms. Turner has performed the play, written by Matthew Lombardo and directed by Rob Ruggiero, in Hartford, Cincinnati and St. Louis, enduring rewrites and revisions along the trail. ''Each step of the way, it was getter better,'' Ms. Turner said by telephone. ''We were learning what the audience understands or doesn't understand. It's a luxury to have almost six months to do.'' Ms. Turner's last appearance on Broadway, in 2005 as Martha in ''Who's Afraid of Virginia Woolf,'' won her a Tony nomination. Joining her on stage will be Stephen Kunken and Evan Jonigkeit.

The Packers found a running game late in the season, but they should not count on that against a Steelers defense that obliterates the run. Pittsburgh's cornerbacks are vulnerable, though, especially if safety Troy Polamalu is not completely healthy. That could provide a field day for Aaron Rodgers, who was probably the league's best quarterback in the second half of the season."

(13, 49) PANAMA CANAL On Aug. 15, 1914, the Panama Canal opened, connecting the world's two largest oceans and signaling the emergence of the United States as a superpower. The technological achievement trumped the efforts of the French, who had failed at a similar endeavor a few years earlier, losing nearly 22,000 workers in the process. The cost for America? The loss of 5,600 lives over more than a decade of grueling labor and an outlay of $350 million, the largest single federal expenditure at that time.

An evening of drunken carousing ensues. Nick craves sexual experience, and who better to tutor him on picking up women than his uncle? Writing in The New York Times, Stephen Holden described the role of the oily Roger as ''a small coup for Mr. Scott, who is normally the quintessence of earnest sincerity on the screen.'' But it is Mr. Eisenberg (''The Social Network'' ) who steals the show. ''The young actor's portrayal of an innocent but adventurous high school student finds a lovely balance between crude adolescent avidity and an inner sweetness that contradicts everything Roger stands for,'' Mr. Holden wrote. ''It is this sweetness that wins over the women they meet and earns Nick his first serious kiss.''"

And in his Saturday radio address, the president declared that ''We can out-compete any other nation on Earth.'' This may be smart politics. Arguably, Mr. Obama has enlisted an old cliché on behalf of a good cause, as a way to sell a much-needed increase in public investment to a public thoroughly indoctrinated in the view that government spending is a bad thing."

From President Obama, we heard a reasonably eloquent case for center-left technocracy and industrial policy, punctuated by a few bipartisan flourishes, in which the entitlement issue felt like an afterthought: He took note of the problem, thanked his own fiscal commission for their work without endorsing any of their recommendations, made general, detail-free pledges to keep Medicare and Social Security solvent (but ""without slashing benefits for future generations""), and then moved swiftly on to the case for tax reform. Tax reform is important, of course, and so are education and technological innovation and infrastructure and all the other issues that the president touched on in this speech. But it was still striking that in an address organized around the theme of American competitiveness, which ran to almost 7,000 words and lasted for an hour, the president spent almost as much time talking about solar power as he did about the roots of the nation's fiscal crisis."

2011-01-25T00:00:00Z,"SCHREYER--William A.,William A. Schreyer, who began his career marking stock prices on a chalkboard at a storefront office and rose to become chairman and CEO of Merrill Lynch died on Saturday, January 22, 2011. During a 45-year career with Merrill Lynch, he led its transformation from US stock brokerage to diversified global investment bank. He was 83 and died peacefully at his Princeton, NJ home surrounded by family. During the stock market crash of 1987, ""Bill"" Schreyer gained wide recognition for his decisive leadership, when he counseled investors not to panic, via nationally televised commercials, signing-off with the signature line: ""At Merrill Lynch, we're still bullish on America."" He was known as a visionary leader, a generous mentor and an irrepressible optimist. An active philanthropist, he gave $55 Million to his alma mater, Penn State, to establish the Schreyer Honors College. Bill Schreyer was born in Williamsport, PA where his father managed the local office of a stock brokerage acquired by Merrill Lynch. Long before the age of instantaneous electronic data transmission, he worked part time marking a storefront chalkboard with securities prices wired from New York. After graduating from Penn State University in 1948, Mr. Schreyer joined Merrill Lynch as a junior executive trainee, and was sent to Buffalo, NY as an account executive-now called financial advisor. There, he met Joan Legg, the daughter of a local banker, and in 1953 they were married. He served for two years as a lieutenant in the U.S. Air Force stationed in Germany- where he developed his interest in international financial markets. In 1963 he entered management as head of the company's Trenton, NJ office and held a succession of positions in the company's retail branch office system, culminating in 1972 as regional director in the New York metropolitan area. As he moved up the management chain, he began to advocate that the company develop beyond its brokerage base and create a separate capital markets division. In 1981, he was put in charge of that division. Two decades later, in 2003, that division accounted for 50 percent of the company's net revenues and 70 percent of pretax profits. Mr. Schreyer became president of the parent company in 1982, and rose to CEO and chairman of the board in 1985. A period of substantial international investment followed. Merrill Lynch was among the first group of foreign firms admitted to membership in the Tokyo Stock Exchange (1986) and became the first U.S. investment bank to open a representative office in the People's Republic of China (1993). On the eve of his retirement, Forbes magazine gave this assessment of Mr Schreyer's tenure as CEO: ""If ever a chairman deserved well of his shareholders, Schreyer does."" Mr. Schreyer served on the Penn State Board of Trustees from 1986 to 1998, including two terms as president (1993-1996). He also chaired the university's first capital campaign which ran from 1984-1990, raising over $350 million. He was a trustee and international councilor of the Center for Strategic and International Studies, a bipartisan public policy institute based in Washington, D.C. Mr. Schreyer also served as a trustee of the George H.W. Bush Presidential Library Foundation, and was a consultor for the Vatican's Patrimony of the Apostolic See. In addition to his wife, Mr. Schreyer is survived by his daughter, DrueAnne Schreyer, a son-in-law, Rodney Frazier, and two grandchildren, Kelly and Charles Frazier. A private service for family members will be held in Princeton, and a memorial service will be planned for the spring. The family asks that, in lieu of flowers, any donations in Mr. Schreyer's memory be made to The Schreyer Honors College at Penn State, in University Park, PA; the Center for Strategic and International Studies in Washington, DC; the Princeton HealthCare System, in Princeton, NJ, or Daytop Village, in New York, NY. In his 2009 memoir, ""Still Bullish on America,"" Schreyer examined the ""cataclysmic"" financial events of the two previous years with this conclusion: ""Yes, I'm an optimist. The pessimists are correct at any given points in history, but never over the long term. I believe in the regenerative powers of capitalism, as long as there are people at work with intelligence, imagination, courage, character and the desire to make a better life. I don't see any of those human qualities going away anytime soon."""

2011-01-25T00:00:00Z,"A curious phenomenon swept the frigid streets of New York City today, where temperatures plummeted to 8 degrees: people looked where they were going. The lure of warm destinations, the primal urge to rush indoors and a deep reluctance to expose tender fingers to the brutal cold meant that iPhones, Blackberrys and other P.D.A.'s were tucked away. Strolling the streets, seeing so many people untethered to various electronic distractions or jabbering away in halfalogues, one could be forgiven for thinking it was 2002 all over again. Which got us thinking about what were some other glass-half-full benefits of this polar blast. A sampling:Average wait time at food carts on Monday: zero minutes. Because no one was in line. Anywhere. Even the famous Halal Cart on the southwest corner of 53rd Street and Avenue of the Americas, where wait times can stretch to 45 minutes, was virtually customer-free. ''You see the weather?'' one of the vendors asked. ''There's nobody in the street.'' Indeed, by New York standards, there was no one in the street. For New Yorkers and Midtown workers forced to brave Times Square: fewer tourists to contend with, walking s l o w l y and four people across. For tourists braving Times Square: fewer impatient New Yorkers to contend with, dogging their heels and muttering curses. If you went to the TKTS booth at 2 p.m., when lines even on Mondays, a slow day on Broadway, are usually 30-people deep, you would have been the first in line. Tourists - hey, they're our bread and butter - had plenty of room on double-decker buses. Anyone hitting a New York Sports Club in Midtown around 12:30 p.m., generally a frantic time, would have had a pick of treadmills, ellipticals, or any other machine. It seems counterintuitive, because working out generally leads to getting warm, but getting to the gym clearly proved too daunting for many. ''Because of the cold,'' a gym receptionist said. People who climbed Times Square's red steps, New York's equivalent of a giant stoop, pretty much had the entire expanse to themselves, which happens almost never. At one point midday, the only person on the steps was Hacene Boulai, a 39-year-old assistant nurse visiting from Montreal, who had climbed to the summit and was enjoying the view. ''I'm really happy,'' Mr. Boulai said. ''I feel like I am king here.'' For New York may have been cold, he said, but Montreal was colder."

2011-01-26T00:01:44Z,"Tiger Woods, Chris Canty (a defensive tackle for the New York Giants) and the Phillies' pitcher Cliff Lee have in the past year or so greatly boosted the popularity of a controversial therapy by employing it to combat a sore knee (Woods), hamstring (Canty) and abdomen (Lee). The treatment, platelet-rich plasma therapy, or P.R.P., involves centrifuging a person's own blood until it contains a concentrated mix of plasma cells and growth factors and then injecting the resulting substance directly into the injured tissue. In theory, the distilled growth factors (a protein or substance that helps stimulate growth) should speed healing and improve the tissue's health, which has happened in the lab. When scientists surgically created lesions in animal tendons and other tissues, P.R.P. therapy nudged the injured tissues to rapidly create new collagen and blood vessels. Meanwhile, testimonials from professional athletes suggested that the shots work in humans as well. Today, recreational athletes reportedly clamor for P.R.P. to treat everything from tennis elbow to back pain, even though the procedure rarely is covered by insurance and can cost $1,000 a shot. ""It has buzz,"" said Dennis Cardone, a clinical associate professor at New York University's Langone Medical Center who has written about the use of P.R.P. in sports medicine."

After the war, he was associated with the law firm of Nims, Verdi and Martin in New York. In 1952, Horan joined the Legal Department of Merck & Co., Inc. and rose steadily: serving successively as General Counsel, Director of Public Relations, Director of Research Administration, Director of Corporate Planning, and President of Merck Sharp and Dohme. Following his retirement from management at Merck, Horan played an active role in the development of the biotech industry, serving as Chairman of the Board of Myriad Laboratories, Chairman of Atrix Laboratories, and Director of Celgene Laboratories. Horan's corporate directorships included: General Motors Corporation, NCR Corporation, JP Morgan & Co. Inc., and Morgan Guaranty Trust Company of New York, and the Burlington Industries, Inc.

2011-01-26T00:00:00Z,"TAMPA, Fla. - Changing positions is not in Derek Jeter's immediate future. But if it ever happens, Jeter would most likely fit in the outfield. That is how General Manager Brian Cashman, during an informal question-and-answer session with fans Tuesday morning at a breakfast in Times Square, responded when asked how long Jeter would remain the Yankees' starting shortstop. Cashman said he would be ''surprised'' if Jeter played the duration of his new contract at shortstop, with center field a potential landing spot because Cashman prefers his corner infielders and outfielders to have power. Jeter, who in December signed a three-year deal with a player option for 2014, turns 37 in June, and the Yankees have concerns about his long-term viability at shortstop. Jeter won his fifth Gold Glove last season despite showing diminished range, according to many advanced defensive metrics. The Yankees believe that Jeter can still play shortstop at a high level, though, and there are no plans to make a switch soon."

So have sympathy for Peter Jackson, who will likely take some time off from that mammoth fantasy franchise after undergoing surgery for a perforated ulcer. Melissa Booth, a publicist for Mr. Jackson, told Agence France-Presse that the filmmaker had been experiencing stomach pains and on Wednesday night was admitted to Wellington Hospital in New Zealand, where doctors gave him the diagnosis and operated on him. Mr. Jackson, the Academy Award-winning director of the ""Lord of the Rings"" movies, stepped in last year to direct the ""Hobbit"" films after Guillermo del Toro withdrew, then fought a pitched battle against labor unions in New Zealand and Australia over hiring practices, with Mr. Jackson warning he could move the films out of New Zealand if the unions did not back down."

But the plate is noteworthy for what it depicts: a dachshund named Lump, owned by Mr. Duncan in the 1950s. The Harry Ransom Center said on Wednesday that the plate was decorated by Picasso for Mr. Duncan at Picasso's Villa La Californie in Cannes, France, on April 19, 1957 (and provided photographs of Picasso at work to corroborate the story). Mr. Duncan brought Lump to Picasso's villa, and over lunch Picasso asked if the dog had ever had his own plate.

This isn't knowledge you're born with. You pick it up from family and friends and, if you're lucky, from mentors. Oddly, for something so important, it receives little emphasis in schools and colleges; many job training programs gloss over it."

2011-01-28T00:00:00Z,"If you'd recently taken on the weighty assignment of directing two movies adapted from J. R. R. Tolkien's ''Hobbit,'' then defended that project during a potentially catastrophic labor crisis, you might be under some stress, too. So have sympathy for Peter Jackson, who will likely take some time off from that mammoth fantasy franchise after undergoing surgery for a perforated ulcer. Melissa Booth, a publicist for Mr. Jackson, told Agence France-Presse that the filmmaker had been experiencing stomach pains and on Wednesday night was admitted to Wellington Hospital in New Zealand, where doctors gave him the diagnosis and operated on him. Mr. Jackson, the Academy Award-winning director of the ''Lord of the Rings'' movies, stepped in last year to direct the ''Hobbit'' films after Guillermo del Toro withdrew, then fought a pitched battle against labor unions in New Zealand and Australia over hiring practices, with Mr. Jackson warning he could move the films out of New Zealand if the unions did not back down. Production on ''The Hobbit'' was to begin next month, but Ms. Booth said there would likely be a ''slight delay'' as Mr. Jackson recuperates. Asked how long that delay could be, Ms. Booth replied, ''How long is a piece of string?''"

2011-01-28T00:00:00Z,"SIEGEL--Phyllis Musiker Passed away on January 25, 2011, in Fort Collins, CO, at age 86, from cancer.

2011-01-28T00:00:00Z,"HEINEKEN'S INSIGHTS The World Economic Forum's annual meeting is taking place in Europe, but the real economic action is in emerging markets. So on Thursday executives got advice from an experienced hand on how to do business in those markets, an urgent question when growth in Europe and the United States remains tepid. Jean-François van Boxmeer, chief executive of Heineken, said at a breakfast at the forum, in Davos, Switzerland, that his company assessed countries according to a simple formula: population growth multiplied by economic growth times political stability. By that measure, Nigeria may be a safer place than Greece, he said -- at least for a beer maker. JACK EWING CLINTON'S WIDE RANGE If there is anyone who is tailor-made for the global talk-fest in Davos, it is Bill Clinton. On Thursday, Mr. Clinton, who first attended the forum a decade ago as president, took the main stage for an interview with Klaus Schwab, the founder of the conference. In a wide-ranging chat, he discussed topics including Haiti, American politics, the Middle East, particle physics and the Neanderthal genome project.

2011-01-28T00:00:00Z,"Some of the Tea Party's most prominent candidates never made it to Washington (think Christine ''I am not a witch'' O'Donnell of Delaware), but the movement that perhaps best embodied the anti-incumbent sentiment of 2010 has nonetheless gained a toehold in the upper chamber of Congress. And on Thursday it became official: Senator Jim DeMint of South Carolina, the Tea Party patron, and the freshmen senators Rand Paul of Kentucky and Mike Lee of Utah held the first official gathering of the Senate Tea Party Caucus. But other newly elected Republican senators have refused to join, including some who had Tea Party support in the fall campaign, like Senators Patrick J. Toomey of Pennsylvania, Kelly A. Ayotte of New Hampshire, and Marco Rubio of Florida. And Mr. DeMint, who has been flirting with the idea of a presidential run, was the only nonfreshman senator to sign on. With its small membership, the Tea Party Caucus amounts to fewer than 10 percent of Republicans in the Senate, making it a minority within the minority. Mr. Lee, in an interview on CNN, said size did not matter. ''It's a relatively small group at this point, and I don't necessarily think it needs to be big,'' Mr. Lee said. ''We're not intending this to be a full-blown, influential caucus. We're intending this to be a conduit for information to pass between individuals who sympathize with the Tea Party movement and the United States Senate.'' Mr. Lee added, ''In time, it may grow.'' The House Tea Party Caucus, led by Representative Michele Bachmann, Republican of Minnesota, held its first event late last year.

2011-01-29T00:00:00Z,"Impressionism and the Super Bowl might seem like strange bedfellows, but they will be getting a little bro time together this year in the spirit of the game. Continuing an art tradition that began last year, the Carnegie Museum of Art in Pittsburgh and the Milwaukee Art Museum (the closest museum to Green Bay, Wisc., home of the Packers), have agreed to make a gridiron bet. If Green Bay wins, the Carnegie will send Pierre Renoir's ''Bathers with a Crab'' from the 1890s to Milwaukee as a temporary loan. If the Steelers win, the Carnegie's patrons will get a brief visit from a Gustave Caillebotte, another water-focused scene titled ''Boating on the Yerres'' from 1877. Daniel Keegan, director of the Milwaukee Art Museum, predicted boldly (in a prepared statement) that he would soon be welcoming the Renoir to his turf, ''where the public can enjoy it and be reminded of the superiority of the Green Bay Packers.''"

The event was billed as a battle between beers and brewers from either side of the country. The East Coast Versus West Coast Punk Rock Brew Tour had a Warped Tour sensibility - the four craft brewers lecturing to the members of the local beer appreciation group, the St. George Taps and Barley Beer Club - wore black T-shirts with beer tour dates listed on the back, and some had beards that would have been at home at a Korn concert. But the 20 or so club members who braved the snow frothing up the front door of the Wild Goose Publick House wouldn't have made it through the doors at Webster Hall: there were enough Pendleton plaid shirts to make guests think they'd stepped off Forest Avenue into Portland, Ore."

2011-01-29T00:00:00Z,"There is, apparently, a distinction even rarer than being granted a license to kill by Her Majesty's Secret Service, and that is having a bronze sculpture of your likeness displayed in the Estonian capital, Tallinn. Sean Connery is now that most exceptional of actors who can claim both honors: on Thursday, a bust depicting the well-preserved star of seven James Bond films (not to mention ''The Hunt for Red October,'' ''Highlander'' and ''The Untouchables'') was unveiled outside Tallinn's Scottish Club, an organization for Scottish expatriates and admirers of all things Scottish in Estonia, The Associated Press reported. Peter Carter, Britain's ambassador to Estonia, said at the unveiling of the $14,000 sculpture that Mr. Connery was ''without a doubt, an icon,'' adding: ''He is variously known as James Bond or the sexiest man of the century. He's a great British actor, a great Scot actor and a great symbol for Scotland.'' Mr. Connery was not present, but said in a statement: ''One cannot help but be flattered by the Scottish Club's gesture. My best wishes to the members of the club and to all the people who made this possible.'' The statement was read by Mart Haamer, president of the Scottish Club, hopefully in his best Sean Connery accent."
2011-01-29T00:00:00Z,"Count on Rocco Landesman to stir the pot. Speaking at a conference about new play development at Arena Stage in Washington on Thursday, Mr. Landesman, the chairman of the National Endowment for the Arts, addressed the problem of struggling theaters. ''You can either increase demand or decrease supply,'' he said. ''Demand is not going to increase, so it is time to think about decreasing supply.'' His comment reverberated through the blogosphere. ''What does he mean there's too much supply?!?'' wrote Trisha Mead, the public relations and publications manager at Portland Center Stage in Oregon. ''What does he mean we can't increase demand?!? Who determines which theater companies are wheat and which are chaff?!?'' In another post, Durango Miller, a playwright and director, said: ''Why not just increase funding? Maybe the N.E.A. is outdated and should be replaced by another system for funding the arts in the United States. Or maybe the people who are running the N.E.A. should be replaced.'' In a telephone interview on Friday Mr. Landesman defended his comments. ''There is a disconnect that has to be taken seriously - our research shows that attendance has been decreasing while the number of the organizations have been proliferating,'' he said. ''That's a discussion nobody wants to have.'' Foundations and agencies like the endowment should perhaps reconsider re-allocating their resources, he said, perhaps giving larger grants to fewer institutions. ''There might be too many resident theaters - it is possible,'' he said. ''At least we have to talk about it.'' This month a group of Republican lawmakers called for the elimination of the National Endowment for the Arts and the National Endowment for the Humanities. Mr. Landesman said he was reserving judgment about that. ''I think we have to see what comes out in the away of actual legislation,'' he said. ''I'm optimistic that the N.E.A. and the N.E.H. are going to be O.K.''"
2011-01-29T00:00:00Z,"CUNDILL--Peter. Peter Cundill was born in Montreal in October 1938. He was educated at Lower Canada College where he made his mark on the football field and on the basketball team. He gained a Bachelor of Commerce degree from McGill University in 1960, after which he qualified as a Chartered Accountant and entered the investment business. In 1963 he began to keep the daily journal that he maintained for more than 40 years as he built and grew the Cundill Value Fund for which he became famous. Peter had what he called his ""epiphany"" on a plane when he read about the value investment principles of Benjamin Graham. His comment was ""This Is What I Want To Do For The Rest Of My Life"" and he did, with a success that richly rewarded thousands of investors, not least those with small resources and precious savings. His record over 35 years as a global mutual fund manager was unrivalled. In 2001 he received the Analysts' Choice Career Achievement Award in recognition of proven superior performance and his lifetime contribution to the financial community. At the Canadian Investment Awards ceremony he was introduced as ""the Indiana Jones of Canadian Money Managers"" - an epithet in which he took great delight. But Peter was in no sense one dimensional. He had a passion for physical challenges, running 22 marathons including a ""sub 3"" when aged over 40, of which he was immensely proud. His interests were exceptionally wide ranging, springing from his insatiable curiosity, a characteristic which he regarded as a vital component in every aspect of life. He was a voracious reader and an inveterate traveller, once commenting ""if I haven't been on a plane for a week I begin to feel restless"". He was never happier than in a hotel suite where he could smoke his cigars and eat his favourite ""junk"" foods (typically hot dogs with lashings of mustard and vanilla ice cream smothered in caramel sauce). Although he lived in London for the past 20 years and loved that city he remained inordinately proud of being Canadian, profoundly interested in everything about his country. He relished nothing better than being among a gathering of Canadians with a bit of Montreal gossip, some Bay Street news and Vancouver views. His abiding passion for history and his belief that it is only possible to comprehend the present and arrive at a measured perspective about the future if one understands the past, led to his founding of The Cundill International Prize in History at McGill, the largest in the world. The Cundill Foundation, which now controls his very considerable wealth, has supported and will continue to support a wide range of charities as well as research projects and educational and enterprise gifts to young people. In 2006 Peter was diagnosed with Fragile X Tremor/Ataxia Syndrome, an as yet untreatable neurological condition. As a result he retired from daily operational fund management in 2009, becoming Chairman Emeritus of Mackenzie Cundill. Nevertheless, far from giving up or wallowing in self pity, Peter fully embraced the challenge of his condition with unwavering cheerfulness and a determination to lead as full a life as possible and to continue to guide and support all those within his wide reach in a personal and professional sense. His influence has been profound. He was very anxious to provide some legacy of his investment genius which might be useful to others and this culminated in the production of a book, There's Always Something To Do The Peter Cundill Investment Approach. To his immense delight the first copy was pressed into his hands in hospital two days before he died. It will be released at the end of February. Peter was pre-deceased by his beloved wife, Joanie, and is survived by his stepdaughter, Evelyn, two grandchildren, his stepson, Roger, and his brother, Grier. He will be deeply missed by a large international circle of friends and all of his ex-colleagues and associates. Following his wishes, Peter will be cremated and his ashes will be scattered in Quebec and British Columbia. Memorial services will be held in Vancouver, Toronto and London at dates to be announced. If you would like to make a donation in his memory, please consider the VGH & UBC Hospital Foundation, www.worldclasshealthcare.ca. Condolences to: peter.cundill.family@gmail.com"

If someone falls too far behind in his payments, a repo man arrives on the scene with a body scanner and a scalpel, the better to detect company property and cut it out. But when Remy tries to reclaim the artificial heart of a musician named T-Bone (the rapper RZA), he's knocked unconscious from an electric shock and emerges from a coma to discover that he, too, has been implanted with a fake pumper. Writing in The New York Times, Stephen Holden said that ''as a recession-era satire,'' this nasty, comic thriller from Miguel Sapochnik ''strikes a very bitter chord.'' He added: ''In today's climate of widespread home foreclosures in which most banks refuse to modify the terms of mortgages, the movie offers a grotesque funhouse reflection of this scarily Darwinian environment. Then there is the matter of escalating health care costs and the insurance industry's resistance to reform. We are halfway there already.''

He served on the Committee of Americans for the Panama Canal Treaty and the Citizens Commission on Indochinese Refugees following the end of the Vietnam War.

2011-01-30T00:00:00Z,"New Orleans quarterback Drew Brees, the most valuable player in last year's Super Bowl, is in Honolulu to participate in Sunday's Pro Bowl. Last week, he teamed with Procter & Gamble on Oahu to help build a playground at the Leeward Y.M.C.A., one of five community service projects of the 2011 N.F.L. Play 60 Community Blitz, which promotes youth health and wellness.Q.Who was your idol growing up?A.I had a lot of them. I also played baseball growing up, and one of my idols was Ted Williams, I knew every one of his statistics. That's why I wear No. 9. I also idolized Ken Griffey Jr. I tried to emulate his swing. I had a chance to play golf with him a few years ago and I was in awe. In terms of football, my heroes were Joe Montana and Troy Aikman. Q.Who will win the Super Bowl?A.I don't really know. Both teams are playing very well right now. They each have similar-style defenses. Pittsburgh uses more ball control, but they have big-play capability with Ben Roethlisberger and his receivers. On the flip side, Green Bay is an aggressive team that likes to air it out. I don't know if there's a real favorite here.Q.How do you stack up against Roethlisberger and Tom Brady?A.Drew Brees? Who's that? In all seriousness, I consider Tom Brady and Peyton Manning to be the two best quarterbacks in the league, and the rest of us are kind of nipping at their heels. They are the cream of the crop, and hopefully, when it's all said and done, I can be mentioned in that same sentence.Q.Will there be a lockout?A.I hope not, but it's a legitimate concern. We as players are preparing ourselves for that possibility. In the last three years, we've experienced some of the greatest gains in terms of popularity and generating total revenue. Our salaries are predicated on how well the league does financially, so if the league is making money, that means we're making money. And yet we are being asked to take an 18 percent pay cut. We are also being asked to go to an 18-game schedule, which will increase our chance of injury and long-term health risks. Considering that revenues continue to go up and up, these are not very fair requests.Q.What do the Saints need to do to get back to the Super Bowl?A.We just have to get some much-needed rest and then get back to work. We also need to get some guys healthy again. I'm excited about some of our young players and feel that we have as good a shot as anyone to get back to the Super Bowl.Q.Tell us something no one knows about you.A.I'm not a surfer, but I like to paddleboard. It's something I did for the first time a few years ago during a family vacation in Hawaii, and I just kind of got hooked. It's a great workout and very therapeutic.Q.What will you do in the off-season?A.I'm going to spend time with my family. I'm finally feeling that the ride from the 2009 Super Bowl is now ending, and now I have a chance to relax a bit. I need to recharge my batteries, both physically and mentally."

2011-01-30T00:00:00Z,"Massey Energy, the embattled coal mine operator, agreed on Saturday to sell itself for about $7.1 billion in cash and stock in a deal that will create a new giant in coal production - and could help Massey shed legal burdens arising from a marred safety record that includes the explosion last year at the Upper Big Branch mine in West Virginia. Under the terms of the deal, Alpha Natural Resources will pay 1.025 of its own shares and $10 in cash, for a total of $69.33 as of Friday's market close, for each Massey share. That represents a 21 percent premium to Massey's Friday closing price of $57.23. The deal will unite two of the biggest American producers of coal, with more than 110 mines and about five billion tons of combined reserves throughout the Appalachian region, the Midwest and Wyoming. It will also bolster Alpha's presence in the growing market for metallurgical coal, which is used to make steel. Massey has enormous reserves of metallurgical coal, and it has increased its exports to countries like India and Brazil, where strong demand has driven up global prices for the material."

Some were old enough to recall horse-drawn street cars and 32-story ''skyscrapers'' even as they sped around by subway or ascended to the 102nd floor of the Empire State Building. Sobersided planners and wide-eyed visionaries thought this astonishing pace of transformation would never abate. A dreamer named W. Parker Chase proposed in 1932 that the 50 million people living in New York City 50 years on would ride vacuum-tube escalators and take air taxis to their 250-story office towers. The Regional Plan Association envisioned a 1,200-foot-long bathhouse complex at Great Kills Park on Staten Island. Robert Moses, who usually had the power to get things done, tried to persuade the United Nations to build a Brasília-like center at Flushing Meadow Park in Queens.

2011-01-30T00:00:00Z,"SCHREYER--William A.,William A. Schreyer, who began his career marking stock prices on a chalkboard at a storefront office and rose to become chairman and CEO of Merrill Lynch died on Saturday, January 22, 2011. During a 45-year career with Merrill Lynch, he led its transformation from US stock brokerage to diversified global investment bank. He was 83 and died peacefully at his Princeton, NJ home surrounded by family. During the stock market crash of 1987, ""Bill"" Schreyer gained wide recognition for his decisive leadership, when he counseled investors not to panic, via nationally televised commercials, signing-off with the signature line: ""At Merrill Lynch, we're still bullish on America."" He was known as a visionary leader, a generous mentor and an irrepressible optimist. An active philanthropist, he gave $55 Million to his alma mater, Penn State, to establish the Schreyer Honors College. Bill Schreyer was born in Williamsport, PA where his father managed the local office of a stock brokerage acquired by Merrill Lynch. Long before the age of instantaneous electronic data transmission, he worked part time marking a storefront chalkboard with securities prices wired from New York. After graduating from Penn State University in 1948, Mr. Schreyer joined Merrill Lynch as a junior executive trainee, and was sent to Buffalo, NY as an account executive-now called financial advisor. There, he met Joan Legg, the daughter of a local banker, and in 1953 they were married. He served for two years as a lieutenant in the U.S. Air Force stationed in Germany- where he developed his interest in international financial markets. In 1963 he entered management as head of the company's Trenton, NJ office and held a succession of positions in the company's retail branch office system, culminating in 1972 as regional director in the New York metropolitan area. As he moved up the management chain, he began to advocate that the company develop beyond its brokerage base and create a separate capital markets division. In 1981, he was put in charge of that division. Two decades later, in 2003, that division accounted for 50 percent of the company's net revenues and 70 percent of pretax profits. Mr. Schreyer became president of the parent company in 1982, and rose to CEO and chairman of the board in 1985. A period of substantial international investment followed. Merrill Lynch was among the first group of foreign firms admitted to membership in the Tokyo Stock Exchange (1986) and became the first U.S. investment bank to open a representative office in the People's Republic of China (1993). On the eve of his retirement, Forbes magazine gave this assessment of Mr Schreyer's tenure as CEO: ""If ever a chairman deserved well of his shareholders, Schreyer does."" Mr. Schreyer served on the Penn State Board of Trustees from 1986 to 1998, including two terms as president (1993-1996). He also chaired the university's first capital campaign which ran from 1984-1990, raising over $350 million. He was a trustee and international councilor of the Center for Strategic and International Studies, a bipartisan public policy institute based in Washington, D.C. Mr. Schreyer also served as a trustee of the George H.W. Bush Presidential Library Foundation, and was a consultor for the Vatican's Patrimony of the Apostolic See. In addition to his wife, Mr. Schreyer is survived by his daughter, DrueAnne Schreyer, a son-in-law, Rodney Frazier, and two grandchildren, Kelly and Charles Frazier. A private service for family members will be held in Princeton, and a memorial service will be planned for the spring. The family asks that, in lieu of flowers, any donations in Mr. Schreyer's memory be made to The Schreyer Honors College at Penn State, in University Park, PA; the Center for Strategic and International Studies in Washington, DC; the Princeton HealthCare System, in Princeton, NJ, or Daytop Village, in New York, NY. In his 2009 memoir, ""Still Bullish on America,"" Schreyer examined the ""cataclysmic"" financial events of the two previous years with this conclusion: ""Yes, I'm an optimist. The pessimists are correct at any given points in history, but never over the long term. I believe in the regenerative powers of capitalism, as long as there are people at work with intelligence, imagination, courage, character and the desire to make a better life. I don't see any of those human qualities going away anytime soon."""

She will be remembered not only for her strength of character and uncompromising intellect, but for also for her unceasing kindness and thoughtfulness.

2011-01-30T00:00:00Z,"A CAMEO appearance on ''Gossip Girl,'' which featured one of his paintings as part of the décor, led the artist Richard Phillips to the subject of his latest solo show. ''Most Wanted,'' at White Cube in London, features 10 larger-than-life oil paintings of celebrities against luxury label backdrops. ''I was hanging out on set, and it was incredible how these young actors were shaping news,'' Mr. Phillips said. ''They would take something from Page Six that was written about the show and then read it into the script. It was what the new shape of Pop Art can be: this reflexive mirror of culture.'' Mr. Phillips began musing over the idea of capturing that star power on canvas, and the result is a Pop pantheon that includes Chace Crawford and Taylor Momsen (above from left), as well as Dakota Fanning, Justin Timberlake, Kristen Stewart, Miley Cyrus, Robert Pattinson, Taylor Swift, Leonardo DiCaprio and Zac Efron (above right). In a Warholian nod, all the portraits are outlined in ''halos'' inspired by Richard Bernstein's Interview magazine cover art. BEE-SHYUAN CHANG"

2011-01-30T00:00:00Z,"As a student and a teacher of language, I appreciate curses and other vulgarities: they can add color and emphasis to our vernacular. But like all stylistic flourishes, the audience has to be taken into consideration. So here's the current quandary. The distinction between where it is and is not appropriate to curse - and I am not just talking about calling upon the wrath of God here, but of the full canon of vulgarities and obscenities - has nearly vanished. There are apparently no rules. No curse-free zones (except maybe church, and one can only hope that is the case). People curse without consideration."

Henry Cavill, a British actor whose credits include the Showtime series ''The Tudors,'' the 2007 fantasy film ''Stardust'' and the coming adventure ''Immortals,'' will play Superman and his secret identity, Clark Kent, in a film that Mr. Snyder is directing for Warner Brothers, the studio said on Sunday. In a statement, Mr. Snyder, whose previous films include the comic-book adaptations ''300'' and ''Watchmen,'' said, ''In the pantheon of superheroes, Superman is the most recognized and revered character of all time, and I am honored to be a part of his return to the big screen.''

2011-02-01T00:00:00Z,"9 P.M. (National Geographic) HARD TIME A new season begins with ''The Hustle,'' which explores the underground prison economy -- an illegal system of barter and trade -- inside the Ross Correctional Institution in Chillicothe, Ohio. There, inmates have concocted a variety of money-making strategies to buy items like potato chips and brand-name shampoo at the commissary. Some work as tailors or tattoo artists to earn extra money; others act as lawyers for fellow inmates. (Above, David Applegate, an inmate, displays his tattoos.) The currency of choice: instant coffee. ''Prison City,'' a second episode at 10, interviews inmates at Ross who are using their sentences to prepare for life on the outside. Then there is David Stonestreet, who was sentenced as a teenager to 20 years to life for complicity to aggravated murder. Mr. Stonestreet, who has no hope of parole, has acknowledged his homosexuality and transformed into an alter ego, Twiggy. 8 P.M.

2011-02-01T00:00:00Z,"MAHON--Myra Ellen. Myra Ellen Mahon (nee Murphy) passed peacefully at home in Delray Beach, Florida, on Saturday, January 29, 2011, embraced and enveloped by the love and caring presence of her dear and cherished husband of 54 years, Arthur J. Mahon, and her four beloved children, Maura, Donna, Arthur and Nancy. Myra was also the dear Nana to her two grandchildren, Christopher and Emelia, and a wonderful mother-in-law to Susan who were holding her hand in spirit when she passed. Myra's date of passing was the Feast Day of Saint Thomas Aquinas, a day that her husband Arthur treasures and holds close to his heart, because on the day when he first met his beautiful, seventeen year-old wife-to-be at a Manhattan College dance, she told him she was reading the teachings of Saint Thomas Aquinas. Born in New York City on April 15, 1937 to James H. Murphy, from County Clare, and Mary Murphy (nee Caroon) from Westmeath, Ireland, Myra was always proud of, and true to, her roots in the Bronx and Ireland. She is predeceased by her parents, her deeply loved sister, Clare, and sisters-in-law, Mary Therese and Delia Rose. Her baby sister, Nula, who Myra loved dearly, survives her. Myra is also survived by her nieces, Maria O'Leary and Diane Slote, to whom she became a surrogate mother after their mothers' deaths, and by twenty other wonderful nieces and nephews from the Neil Mahon, Fitzpatrick, Burris, Thanhauser, and Slote families who were blessed to spend many weekends, Christmases, Thanksgivings, ski trips and also summers in Madison and Candlewood Lake, Connecticut, with their beautiful, generous, wise, funny and slightly irreverent Aunt Myra. A kid from Woodycrest Avenue in the Highbridge section of the Bronx, Myra lived from childhood with enormous intelligence, passion, elegance, conviction and concern for the underdog and the underserved. When the family moved to Queens, she attended St. Agnes High School in College Point. Married at the age of 20 to her love, Arthur, she returned to college as a young mother of four and graduated from Marymount, Tarrytown, summa cum laude as the valedictorian of her class, going on to earn her Masters in Social Work with high honors from Fordham University. Myra initiated her business career as a social worker at the United Way of Tristate in New York City, rising rapidly to Executive Vice President overseeing corporate partnerships and giving. She went on to become the Development Director of the Archdiocese of New York where she was fueled by her passion for raising funds for children to attend inner-city Catholic primary schools like the one she attended, Sacred Heart. An extraordinary team builder, mentor and leader, Myra took great joy and pride in the many people she worked alongside of, and she forever cherished their shared accomplishments and victories. Myra also lent her enormous energy and passion for social justice as a Member of the Board of Directors of a legion of wonderful organizations that embodied her unending commitment to giving all people the opportunity to live full, dignified and joyful lives. Those organizations included Marymount College, Women In Need, New York Foundation, Calvary Hospital and Hospice, New York State Parks and Recreation Commission, Museum of the City of New York and the Healthcare Chaplaincy. Myra took great joy serving for many years as the Co-Chair of the Women's Health Symposium at Weill Cornell Medical Center with her very dear friend and fellow New Yorker, Joan Weill. Myra was surprised five years ago when her loving husband, Arthur, told her that the second floor of the Weill Cornell Medical College's new building under construction at 1305 York Avenue in New York City would contain a resource center and it would be named in her honor. She was so pleased that the Myra Mahon Patient Resource Center included reading rooms and a library to help patients and families learn about and manage their illnesses. Upon its completion, Myra personally dedicated the Center ""To those who serve unseen."" Myra's immediate family and her personal assistant, Joan Hanebury, whom Myra loved dearly, attended a private memorial mass on Monday, January 31, 2011, at Holy Name of Jesus Church, Palm Beach, Florida, to honor and bless her memory. How appropriate and meaningful it is that Monday was the feast day of St. John Bosco, who dedicated his life to the education of poor children. There will be a mass celebrating Myra's life and all of her many loves, joys and accomplishments at Saint Patrick's Cathedral in New York City in the Spring. Donations in Myra's memory can be made to the Inner City Scholarship Fund of the Archdiocese of New York (Ms. Helen Lowe (212)371-1011, ext. 3325) for the Myra Mahon Fund for students at the Sacred Heart School in the Bronx, or to the Weill Cornell Medical College (Mr. Larry Schafer (212)746-4070) for the support of the Myra Mahon Patient Resource Center. Myra blessed the many people she loved with her warm spirit, endless wisdom, grace and intuitive gift for understanding and helping them. She leaves us with the memory of her sharing her favorite Irish prayer, ""May the road rise up to meet you. May the wind always be at your back.

2011-02-01T00:00:00Z,"SCHAEFER--Clifford E. Schaefer, co-founder of Flying Cranes Antiques, Ltd., internationally recognized New York City firm for rare Meiji art, passed away on Thursday, January 20, 2011 at Weill Cornell Medical Center in Manhattan. Always optimistic and courageous, Cliff had survived nine surgeries through the years, but this last one was impossible for survival, but one he underwent with his usual display of courage and hope. After graduating from Ohio State University in the 1950s, Cliff joined the Marines like his father before him. Initially a lieutenant, he became an intelligence officer soon after, serving in Alexandria and Camp LeJeune, NC. After a few years, following his stint in the Marines, he opened a busy office-machine business in Manhattan, his clients among the largest corporations in the city. During this time, he studied law during the evenings at Brooklyn Law and exhausted, he would joke, often missed his stop on the train during his late ride home. In the 1970s, when he and his wife, Jean, decided that country air would be a desired reprieve from the pace of city life, they rented a small cottage near Litchfield, CT. In order to furnish their new retreat, the country auction became a Saturday night ritual. Soon, all things Japanese became a specific lure and the country auction expanded to venues nationally and finally abroad. Collecting became a passion, the first interests, Japanese Hiradoware and cloisonne. Cliff's passion became an obsession and led eventually to the establishment of Flying Cranes Antiques. He and his wife opened their first gallery at The Manhattan Art & Antiques Center in New York City in 1985, followed by additional galleries in the same venue. It didn't take long for discriminating collectors, museums and royalty to become regular guests at the galleries. The obsession became total joy and encouraged the couple to travel and eventually to spend weekends at their new compound on a pristine lake in the mountains. Being addict collectors, soon Japanese landscaping, replete with koi pond, waterfall, rare shrubs, trees and rocks became the weekend focus, providing much pleasure from living among this Japanese-like extension of their life's work. A highly regarded London based Meiji art colleague described Cliff as, ""An Immense character in the Japanese world and a wonderful promoter of the subject we both hold dear. His enthusiasm was entirely natural, as was his eye for the finest pieces in our field."" Cliff will be remembered by all who knew him as a kind and generous man a devoted husband, father, grandfather, great-grandfather and the warmest friend. He had a lust for living, which he relished and lived to the fullest. So great was his zeal for collecting that during his last stay in hospital, an agent brought an item for him to see (before going to surgery) and his daughter photographed him handling the piece, which with excitement, he purchased right then and there. He will be greatly missed by all who knew him. He is survived by his wife, children, grandchildren and great-grandchildren."

2011-02-01T00:00:00Z,"BUSINESS DAY An article on Friday about the downgrading of Japan's long-term sovereign debt by Standard & Poor's misstated the proportion of United States debt that is held by foreign investors. As in Japan, a majority of American debt is held domestically; it is not the case that most American debt is held by foreigners. (The Treasury estimates that foreigners own 47 percent of the outstanding Treasury debt not held by other American government agencies, like Federal Reserve and the Social Security Administration. If that debt to other government agencies is included, foreigners own 31 percent of the total.)"

She inspired all of us with her steadfast commitment to women's health, patient education and medicine, as well as her concern for the needs of patients and their families. Alongside her husband, Arthur Mahon, she established a legacy of charitable giving and was a tireless supporter of Weill Cornell Medical College and NewYork-Presbyterian Hospital. Her dedication to the advancement of women's health led her to serve as co-chair of the Women's Health Symposium Executive Steering Committee and co-chair of the Maurice R. Greenberg Distinguished Service Award Dinner, positions she held for more than a decade. Under her leadership, the annual Symposium educated hundreds of women about important health care issues and encouraged them to become their own health care advocates. We will miss our friend Myra -- her sound guidance, her beautiful smile, and most of all, her extraordinary compassion and kindness. Her passing leaves an emptiness in all of our hearts. Her outstanding contributions and enormous generosity will never be forgotten. We extend our sincere condolences to the entire Mahon family, including her husband, Arthur, and her children Maura, Madonna, Arthur and Nancy.

2011-02-01T00:00:00Z,"The new year has barely begun, but two big-event music festivals are already hits. Last week the Coachella Valley Music & Arts Festival in Indio, Calif., with Arcade Fire, Kanye West, Kings of Leon and the Strokes, sold out less than a week after going on sale. And by Monday all of the three-day passes for I'll Be Your Mirror, the new event in Asbury Park, N.J., presented by the people behind the All Tomorrow's Parties concerts, had sold out, three days after they went on sale. The two events are on very different scales. Coachella, which runs from April 15 to 17, sells tickets only for its full three-day run, and in the past its attendance has been in the neighborhood of 70,000 people per day. I'll Be Your Mirror, from Sept. 30 to Oct. 2, can hold a little more than 5,000 people in its two main theaters, and in addition to the 1,500 or so weekend passes that went on sale last week, single-day tickets are also available. (But they're said to be going fast too, particularly for the second day, featuring the British band Portishead; the opening night has a highly anticipated show by Jeff Mangum of the group Neutral Milk Hotel that is only open to people with full weekend passes.)"

2011-02-01T00:00:00Z,"American Symphony Orchestra Carnegie Hall The American Symphony Or- chestra is known for its advocacy of neglected music, and on Sunday afternoon at Carnegie Hall, it presented what it said was the United States premiere of a century-old opera, Alberic Mag- nard's elegant, moving ''Beren- ice.'' Based on Racine's play about the Roman emperor Titus, who under public pressure sends away his beloved Berenice, the queen of Judea, to free himself for marriage to a native-born Roman, the opera is a little like ''Dido and Aeneas'' meets ''Madama Butter- fly.'' Magnard was an ardent Wag- nerian, and the slow-burning pas- sions and vivid orchestral colors of ''Berenice'' can resemble a lighter-textured, harmonically calmer ''Tristan und Isolde.'' In the wake of innovative works like Debussy's ''Pelleas et Melisande'' (1902) and Strauss's ''Salome'' (1905), ''Berenice,'' first per- formed in 1911, must have seemed tame, and it nearly vanished from the repertory. But it is involving, with Titus's indecision and Berenice's self-sacrificing dignity set to eloquent music that reflects the agonized but restrained emo- tions of Racinian style. The baritone Brian Mulligan was a vibrantly youthful Titus, and the bass Gregory Reinhart was imposing as his adviser Mucien. But Leon Botstein, the orchestra's music director, con- ducted rigidly, too rarely allowing Magnard's atmospheric score to breathe. And in the end, the opera de- pends most on a charismatic mez- zo-soprano in the title role, un- leashing rich floods of tone across a wide vocal and emotional range. While this Berenice, Michaela Martens was a sympathetic pres- ence, her voice tended to vanish and she never really commanded the stage. Still, even in an inconsistent performance, ''Berenice'' made an impression: an opera both self- consciously classical and unex- pectedly fresh. ZACHARY WOOLFE Ecstatic Music Festival Merkin Concert Hall As part of the Kaufman Cen- ter's Ecstatic Music Festival, the vibrant new-music orchestra Alarm Will Sound joined forces on Sunday afternoon with Face the Music, an ensemble of teenagers studying at the center's Special Music School. Face the Music, di- rected by Jennifer Undercofler, has given stunning performances in recent years, most notably a lively account of Terry Riley's ''In C'' as part of Make Music New York in 2009. This time, it began with two de- lightfully idiosyncratic post-Mini- malist works by Tristan Perich: ''Qsqsqsqsqsqsqsqqqqqqqqqqqq'' -- combining the tinkly timbres of toy pianos with Mr. Perich's bright-edged electronic sound -- and ''Interface,'' melding elec- tronics and a string quartet into something that sounds halfway between a harmonium and bag- pipes. Alarm Will Sound offered a quick overview of its current fas- cinations. Mostly that meant ar- rangements of electronica, includ- ing Preshish Moments's ''Why Do Birds,'' a parody of an old Car- penters recording, and Aphex Twin's percussion-and-brass- dominated ''Omgyjya Switch 7.'' Stefan Freund contributed ''kinda asleep,'' a sparkly ar- rangement from Matt Marks's ''Little Death: Vol. 1'' (both com- posers are players in the ensem- ble), but Alarm's most striking of- fering was Gavin Chuck's omi- nous orchestration of two move- ments (''Killshot'' and ''O God Protect Me'') from Ben Frost's ''By the Throat'' album. Together, Alarm Will Sound and instrumentalists and singers from Face the Music closed the concert with Steve Reich's ''Tehil- lim,'' in an occasionally muddy but generally spirited, often hard- driven performance conducted byAlan Pierson.
