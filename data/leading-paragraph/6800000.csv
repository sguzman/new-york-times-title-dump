Another absentee, the right-hander Carl Pavano, who hasn't pitched for the Yankees this season, won't pitch this season. He needs bone-chip surgery above the elbow."

I would argue that hindsight has shown that those two candidates had equal amounts of presidential electability: zero.

But Silvio Berlusconi, the ousted prime minister, called the vote ''profoundly immoral'' because honorary senators do not normally take part in confidence votes.

And on his last night in Mandalay, he went to see the Moustache Brothers comedy troupe, who ''have paid a steep price for their laughs,'' in the form of arrest and imprisonment, and whom the regime now allows to perform only for tourists. The suspicion inevitably arises, however, that the only reason the Moustache Brothers are allowed to perform for tourists is that they are being required to kick back some (and likely most) of the precious foreign currency they earn to the regime."

All of the debauchery she craves is here by the bushel. Last year we held a party in celebration of the first book in the Motorcycleman series. The event was held at a local doughnut shop, where patrons were serenaded by an Elvis impersonator accompanied by an accordionist. The liquor was free- flowing and everybody understood the ''no glass'' policy. The cuisine was Chinese takeout and hot glazed doughnuts. There were no arrests or fistfights, but we did witness one divorce and two marriage proposals (one same sex). We expect our next party, for ''Voodoo Moon'' (the second book in that series) to be even louder and more obnoxious than the first. The party will have a Dixie theme, complete with a Louisiana funeral jazz band, hurricanes and a Truman Capote look-alike reading from a selection of our titles. As you see, then, rumors of the death of book parties are highly exaggerated! One just needs to know where to find them. Jeremy Townsend Phil Englehardt Exeter, N.H.

2006-05-21T00:00:00Z,"The prolific RICHARD GREENBERG -- whose new play ''THE HOUSE IN TOWN,'' about a wealthy Manhattan couple in the late 1920's, starts performances this week -- is in a serious slump and badly in need of a hit, to use a baseball metaphor, which is something he has been known to do. In September his cotton-candy-light ''Naked Girl on the Appian Way'' received a critical drubbing that seemed particularly harsh, until the revival of his drama ''Three Days of Rain'' opened on Broadway in April, and the critics really went to work. Granted, Julia Roberts took the brunt of the assault, but few would argue that the production did any favors for Mr. Greenberg's reputation. He has had better receptions with world premieres in Washington and Chicago, but only slightly. The Washington Post critic Peter Marks dismissively likened Mr. Greenberg's ''Bal Masque,'' which opened at Theater J, to a Neil Simon comedy, and Charles Isherwood of The New York Times said that ''The Well-Appointed Room,'' which opened at the Steppenwolf Theater, was infected with the ''glib nihilism'' of NEIL LaBUTE. Sheesh. ''House,'' directed by DOUG HUGHES, could still be the kind of success that redeems the season, but if it isn't, hey, there's always next year. ''The House in Town'' starts previews Wednesday at the Mitzi E. Newhouse Theater, Lincoln Center, (212) 279-4200; $70 until June 18, then $75. Speaking of Mr. LaBute, his new play, ''SOME GIRL(S),'' began previews last week at the Lucille Lortel Theater, and it reunites the devilish playwright with the director JO BONNEY, who successfully staged his hit version of ''Fat Pig.'' In this relationship drama, a fiancé, played by DAVID SCHWIMMER in Chicago and ERIC McCORMACK here, visits four ex-girlfriends before getting hitched. I can't imagine what could possibly go wrong. ''Some Girl(s)'' is now in previews. 121 Christopher Street, West Village, (212) 279-4200; $65 and $75."
2006-05-21T00:00:00Z,"To the Editor: It is distressing to read that the dispute between DeCamp Bus Lines and New Jersey Transit has not been resolved (''Tug of War Over Commuters,'' May 14). Yes, commuting on the bus can be difficult. I've heard people complain about the service on New Jersey Transit, too. My experiences, however, are always good. I am handicapped, and walk, slowly, with a cane. The DeCamp drivers are unfailingly thoughtful: in-bound drivers will let me get seated before pulling away, and the drivers coming home will try to pull close to the curb so that I can more easily ''debus.'' Loss of DeCamp would force me to consider the train, which is not a realistic option for the handicapped."
2006-05-21T00:00:00Z,"RUBINSTEIN--Eli A. Eli A. Rubinstein, Ph.D., a scientist who was an authority on the effects of TV violence on children, was born in New York City on April 27, 1919. He died at Carolina Meadows in Chapel Hill, NC on May 15, 2006, at age 87. His last formal position was as Adjunct Research Professor of Mass Communications, School of Journalism, University of North Carolina, Chapel Hill, NC from 1971 to 1978, he was Professor of Psychiatry and Psychology at the Health Sciences Center, State University of New York at Stony Brook, New York. He received his Ph.D. in psychology at the Catholic University of America in 1950. He served for twenty years in various senior research and administrative positions in federal agencies in Washington, D.C.; in the Veterans Administration, from 1950 to 1958, and then at the National Institute of Mental Health, from 1958 through 1971. At the time he left federal service, he was the Assistant Director for Extramural Programs and Behavioral Sciences at NIMH and the highest ranked psychologist at that Institute. One of the last major responsibilities he had in that federal position was the coordination of a three-year national program of research on television and social behavior. The results of that research program were summarized, in 1972, in a comprehensive report by the Surgeon General's Scientific Advisory Committee on Television and Social Behavior, assessing the effects of televised violence on the behavior of children. Dr. Rubinstein served as Vice-Chairman and project leader for that Committee, representing the Surgeon General. Five volumes of technical reports, published under Dr. Rubinstein's guidance, served as scientific documentation for the Committee report. Subsequently, Dr. Rubinstein was a senior advisor and contributor to the tenyear update of the Surgeon General's report, published in 1982. Over his entire scientific career, Dr. Rubinstein published more than 100 articles and books on such diverse topics as: research in psychotherapy, the status of mental health manpower, the qualities of science administration, and developments in the behavioral sciences, in addition to his editing of the original five volumes of technical reports on television and social behavior. His major publications since 1975 were on policy issues relating to findings on the effects of television on the viewer. He was the co-editor of a book, published in 1985, on ''The Media, Social Science and Social Policy for Children.'' He was coeditor of ''Big World, Small Screen,'' a book published in 1992, which examined the research and scientific conclusions on the effects of television viewing on various segments of the viewing public. He testified before various congressional committees on the effects of televised violence and on policy issues related to that public problem. On the less serious side of his career, Dr. Rubinstein prided himself on having been the master of ceremonies at many retirement parties at the NIMH. His doggerel and sharp comments at these events were always enjoyed by the audience. At his own retirement party from the NIMH in 1971, he was given a plaque naming him ''Poet Laureate Emeritus.'' His federal career was distinguished by the fact that he began in 1940 as the lowest grade clerk, working in the 1940 decennial census. Through a series of promotions and advances because of his graduate work, he ended his federal service, thirty years later, at the highest grade level, GS18, one of only a handful of federal civil service employees to have ever accomplished that feat. Dr. Rubinstein was a Fellow of the American Psychological Association. He had been a consultant to many private and federal agencies concerned with research in the behavioral sciences. He was also a consulting editor for various scientific journals. In 1967-1968, he was a Fellow at the Center for Advanced Study in the Behavioral Sciences, Stanford, CA. Dr. Rubinstein is survived by three children; two sons, Dr. Lawrence V. Rubinstein of Rockville, MD, and Dr. Donald H. Rubinstein of Guam and one daughter, Betsy Rubinstein of Chevy Chase, MD and three grandchildren."

More than a dozen states have tried this novel strategy for preventing sexual recidivism. Their experiences clearly show that these laws waste taxpayer dollars and embroil state agencies in endless litigation. Instead of warehousing a small percentage of sex offenders, states should use the money on cost-effective strategies like community supervision combined with mandatory treatment that would reach many more released convicts."

Predictably, creative people find creative ways of balancing two professions. Teaching is a time-honored way for an artist to keep the wolf from the door. It is, in fact, the most common alternative profession listed on applications for financial support at the Pollock-Krasner Foundation in Manhattan, according to Caroline Black, its program officer.

2006-05-21T00:00:00Z,"To the Editor: I must register a protest concerning David Gilmour's review of my book, ''The Terror'' (May 7). In it he casually assimilates my analysis of the September Massacres of 1792 to an entirely unnecessary, and insulting, association with belittling the Holocaust, and a diminution of the impact of 9/11 on America. If I may be allowed to quote myself in my own defense, these are some of my concluding remarks on the topic in the book: After discussing the fact that many potential victims were spared by the ''tribunals'' set up in the prisons, I note that: ''In all the horror of massacre, it is perhaps here that we find the greatest apparent incomprehensibility. . . . It is easy to come to terms with the idea of irrational carnage carried out by sadistic mobs: such acts fit neatly into the concept of a radically 'different,' almost subhuman crowd, safely distanced from the self-image of the observer. Far less comfortable is the realization that bloody murder could be committed by upright citizens in the name of their country's freedom.'' I am trying here, as an unprejudiced observer will note, to retrieve the Massacres for understanding. I should have thought it clear that I do not use words like ''horror'' and ''bloody murder'' about acts of which I approve, or the significance of which I wish to diminish in any way. I had hoped it was possible to write about these events at a distance of more than 200 years without being forced to defend myself against charges of unreasonable sympathy. It would appear, however, that the French Revolution remains capable of stirring ire, even across the wide Atlantic. David Andress Portsmouth, England"

2006-05-21T00:00:00Z,"BEYOND BLACK, by Hilary Mantel. (Picador, $14.) This darkly comic novel explores spiritualism through the story of a woman coming to terms with her disturbing past. Mantel's fat, middle-aged English heroine, Alison Hart, is a professional medium and clairvoyant -- a ''sensitive'' -- who depends on the help of a grizzled ''spirit guide'' named Morris. Just as Alison has begun to dictate her autobiography to her no-nonsense assistant, Colette, her consciousness comes under attack from Morris and a crew of villainous apparitions. Our reviewer, Terrence Rafferty, said ''Beyond Black'' feels like ''a great, gleeful binge, a wallow in the not-good-for-you riches of this writer's extraordinarily vivid, violent imagination.''"

Set in the New Orleans Garden District, the surrounding Louisiana backwoods and the above-ground tombs of a local cemetery (Michael Yeargan's design, beautifully lighted by Peter Kaczorowski, is strikingly handsome), in a time described as ''five years before Hurricane Katrina,'' this raucous, blackly tinted romp finds most of Henley's dysfunctional losers wetting the whistle at every opportunity. Be it Jack Daniel's, Wild Turkey or good, old-fashioned Coca-Cola, the Clays and Chrystals rarely stop drinking as they scramble to ''find the courage to be honest and true,'' to quote Andrew Clay (Reg Rogers), the family's oldest brother, self-anointed savior and would-be state auditor."

2006-05-21T00:00:00Z,"To the Editor: We are longtime admirers of Philip Roth's fiction and appreciative of the depth and complexity in his latest book, ''Everyman,'' reviewed by Nadine Gordimer (May 7). Nonetheless, as social scientists, we feel compelled to comment on its thrust. Our research intimately following the lives of middle-class Americans who are currently in their 70's shows that only a small minority ''worry about oblivion,'' in Roth's phrasing. Most believe, as the gravedigger encountered by the protagonist puts it, that ''You gotta do what you gotta do,'' and they get on with it. They accept their lives -- including illness, loss, and their many past misdeeds and mistakes -- and purposefully engage with the present. Unlike Roth's protagonist, many older Americans are well buffered by family, faith and friends. Some despair, but they tend to be the same people who were also despairing in young and middle adulthood. With the aging of the baby boomers upon us, we share this note lest too many aging Americans take permission from Roth to dwell in the past and fear the future rather than seize the present.

The Horace Mann community is in deep shock and mourning over the tragic death of our cherished alumnus, Alexander Capelluto, HM 2004. Alexander's extraordinary intelligence and goodness, his indomitable spirit and fortitude, and his wonderful sense of humor touched all. Graduating as Valedictorian of his class, he was recognized in many ways for his distinguished work and valuable contributions to the daily life of the school...elected to the Cum Laude Society, he graduated with honors in Mathematics, History, English and Science. He was the recipient of the Joseph Chase Award in Mathematics and was a National Merit Scholarship awardee. He received Jazz Band and Chamber Wind Band awards, and was awarded the Scholarship for Academic Excellence provided by the State of New York. He was a remarkable individual whose imprint was everywhere...class president, a Governing Council representative, Model UN member, president of the Jazz Ensemble, ad hoc reporter for The Record, a cross-country runner and an avid basketball player. He was elected by his classmates to deliver their valedictory in June 2004. His death is a tragic loss.

Just above the rustle of leaves and the hushed splashing of lawn sprinklers, you may hear guitars strum and voices murmur as sophisticated recording equipment hums. They are 21st-century Dickinsons and Whitmans with names like Boxcar Nancy and East River Pipe making music that will go straight to the Web or eventually appear on self-produced CD's. All they need is one small, quiet room and their dreams to lose themselves in the obsessive world of what has become known as bedroom pop, bloglike music that tries to make the world a better place through a perfect homemade song."

2006-05-21T00:00:00Z,"WILLIAMS--Ray. Died May 14 at NYU Medical Center which was a part of most of his life. Ray was the Administrator of the Department of Surgery under Frank Spencer, MD. About 40 years ago when his son Shawn had to tell his classmates what his father's work was, he said, ''My Dad tells doctors what to do.'' Well, that somewhat overstates it, but all at NYU who had contact with him knew he could things done and was so highly regarded for his ability as a facilitator. The general word was ''Go see Ray.'' Ray was born in Atlanta, GA and a graduate of Grady High School and Georgia Tech. He was enormously popular as a young man and was relied upon to be the organizer. This ability continued throughout his life. He organized numerous cruise trips among so many other activities for multiple friends. Ray was also a generous contributor to all equality causes. Ray is survived by his life partner of 40 years, Frank Folisi, his son, Shawn, daughter-in-law, Jasmine, and their children, David and Jennifer, and a brother, Graybill, of Orlando, FL."

At their best they are cultural beacons in the suburbs, a place where the arts flourish in communities that otherwise may not be able to support them. The visual arts are a prime example. There are more than two dozen galleries and museums tucked away on campuses in the New York suburbs. They are a varied lot, characterized partly by the wealth of the school and the generosity of alumni and partly by the kind of art they display."
2006-05-21T00:00:00Z,"Thinking about the health and future of Long Island Sound calls to mind an old ''Far Side'' cartoon, the one where a dentist, having filled a patient's gaping jaws with a steely forest of braces, clamps, screws and straps, announces that he wants to insert a tennis ball, too, just to see if he can. About 20 million people live within 50 miles of the Sound, and it seems sometimes as if all of them at once are either putting something into it (sewage, fertilizer, pesticides, natural gas platforms) or taking something out (striped bass, flounder, clams, lobsters). Left to itself, the Sound would surely regain its footing as a stable, healthy ecosystem."

An independent, forthright, incisive thinker of great integrity, she worked closely with Dr. Kenneth Clark, taught at the university level and in New York City high schools for many years rescuing scores of students out of poverty, designed and developed educational and testing programs. Very concerned with the oppressed, she gave generously of time and money to numerous organizations including those in her Lower East Side neighborhood of Gouverneur Gardens. Dr. Halpern graduated from CCNY in 1958 Phi Beta Kappa, earned an MA in English from Cornell, a Ph.D from Fordham and was a Post Doctoral Fellow at Columbia. She was a generous philanthropist of the arts and education, more recently researching the history of immigrants and immigration. The daughter of Max J.

2006-05-21T00:00:00Z,"LIBYA The News -- The United States renewed diplomatic relations with Libya, ending more than a quarter-century of estrangement. Behind the News -- The two countries' relationship has come a long way since 1979, when the United States severed relations, and particularly since 1988, when Libyan agents blew up Pan Am Flight 103 over Scotland, killing 270. Libya did its part by abandoning unconventional weapons and renouncing terrorism. But in some ways the world has also passed Libya by, and with Iraq, Afghanistan, Al Qaeda and now Iran, the United States has bigger fish to fry. IRAQ The News -- A panel of judges in the trial of Saddam Hussein approved formal charges of crimes against humanity in the case. Behind the News -- The ruling means that Mr. Hussein and seven co-defendants would almost certainly face the death penalty if convicted. Mr. Hussein and the others are on trial in connection with the execution of 148 Shiites in 1982. Convictions would not come anytime soon, however. The trial has already gone on for more than seven months -- the judges' ruling came after the prosecution presented its evidence -- and is expected to continue into the fall. WASHINGTON The News -- Less than a day after the deadline for enrollment in the Medicare prescription drug program, a bipartisan group of senators pushed to eliminate the penalty for people who missed it. Behind the News -- The administration had defended the penalty -- an increase on future premiums -- as a stick to encourage people to sign up for the program, which subsidizes drug coverage. But the senators, uneasy about upsetting the electorate in an election year, said the program was difficult to understand. Waiving the fee would cost an estimated $1.7 billion over five years. RHODE ISLAND The News -- A judge in Rhode Island sentenced the onetime reality TV star Richard Hatch to 51 months in prison for tax evasion. Behind the News -- The sentence was at least 10 months longer than expected, and the judge said he opted for the longer term because it was clear to him that Mr. Hatch had lied during the trial. Mr. Hatch denied that he had been less than truthful, but fans of reality television could believe the judge's comments, given that Mr. Hatch connived his way to winning the CBS reality show ''Survivor'' in 2000. TEXAS The News -- The Texas Department of Transportation said it would consider raising the speed limit to 80 miles per hour on parts of two Interstate highways. Behind the News -- By making the proposal, the department seemed to thumb its nose at those who argue that Americans need to conserve gasoline. And traffic safety experts said that raising the limit would make the highways, in rural parts of West Texas, less safe. But officials said that if they raised the limit, they would just be acknowledging the obvious: that motorists drive that fast already."

2006-05-21T00:00:00Z,"Sweeps month rolls on. NBC's ''10.5: APOCALYPSE'' (Sunday and Tuesday nights at 9) is a sequel to a 2004 disaster film in which the West Coast was devastated by an earthquake that surely qualified as ''the big one.'' But my oh my, now there's an even worse earthquake coming. One seismologist (FRANK LANGELLA) has predicted that it could create a continental divide right down the middle of the United States. BEAU BRIDGES is the president, KIM DELANEY a determined seismologist, DAVID CUBITT her ex-boyfriend and GARCELLE BEAUVAIS-NILON the FEMA boss. When Stephen King thinks about the apocalypse, he heads for Nevada (at least Las Vegas was the Antichrist's headquarters in ''The Stand''). The title of ''STEPHEN KING'S DESPERATION'' (ABC, Tuesday night at 8), a three-hour movie, refers to Desperation, Nev., where hapless motorists are stopped by a local lawman (RON PERLMAN), framed for marijuana possession and thrown in jail. The scary part is that dead people are lying all over town, and the cop is possessed by something evil. TOM SKERRITT, ANNABETH GISH, MATT FREWER and CHARLES DURNING are among the inmates. It's highly self-referential. (Yes, that's ''redrum'' written on a wall.) One more time, it's the ''AMERICAN IDOL'' season finale on Fox. CHRIS DAUGHTRY, who even the notoriously demanding SIMON COWELL predicted would win, is gone. On Tuesday night at 8 the two finalists perform. Then the producers stretch out Wednesday night's show (also at 8), when the winner is announced, to two hours. That includes a reunion of the Top 12, but some people will still watch only the last 10 minutes. For those not swept up so much by sweeps, ''JIM HENSON'S THE STORYTELLER'' comes out as a two-disc DVD set (Sony Pictures, $19.94) on Tuesday. That means nine fairy tales (including one that asks whether a king will marry his beautiful daughter off to a hedgehog) and four Greek myths with decidedly uncuddly puppets."

However, his failure to even once mention women's rights in an article explicitly focused on the politics of women's health disturbed me. Instead of quoting the English writer Daniel Defoe, Shorto might have cited the United States Supreme Court, which in 1908 ruled that the state could regulate a woman's workday because it had an interest in ''protecting'' her reproductive capacity for ''the well-being of the race.'' How is it that now, despite the fact that this case was long since implicitly overturned, this country is still run by people who believe that womanhood is inextricable from motherhood?

It includes figures as major as Keith Jarrett and Pat Metheny, and endless numbers of musicians who are still learning. Deeply original and aesthetically aggressive, Mr. Bley long ago found a way to express his long, elegant, voluminous thoughts in a manner that implies complete autonomy from its given setting but isn't quite free jazz. The music runs on a mixture of deep historical knowledge and its own inviolable principles. On Monday he plays a duo concert with one of the younger pianists who has absorbed him most deeply, FRANK KIMBROUGH. The admiration runs both ways, but that doesn't mean they'll go easy on each other.

More than a dozen states have tried this novel strategy for preventing sexual recidivism. Their experiences clearly show that these laws waste taxpayer dollars and embroil state agencies in endless litigation. Instead of warehousing a small percentage of sex offenders, states should use the money on cost-effective strategies like community supervision combined with mandatory treatment that would reach many more released convicts."

2006-05-21T00:00:00Z,"Hundreds of immigrants and their supporters marched down Madison Avenue yesterday, calling on the United States Senate to pass legislation this week that would offer millions of illegal immigrants the chance to become American citizens. The march was far smaller than an April 10 demonstration that drew thousands to City Hall Park. The atmosphere was festive as Koreans, South Asians, Hispanics, Haitians and others beat bongo drums, blew whistles and waved signs reading, ''I Love Immigrant New York.''"
2006-05-21T00:00:00Z,"JOE ORTON has received a lot of attention recently, largely because of Alec Baldwin's turn in ''Entertaining Mr. Sloane'' at the Roundabout Theater in Manhattan. The Two River Theater Company here boasts no movie stars in its Orton comedy, ''What the Butler Saw,'' but it shares Roundabout's challenge to successfully bring British humor to an American audience. The most striking element of the Two River production is Jeremy Doucette's set. As soon as the curtain rose on opening night, the audience applauded the sprawling psychiatric clinic, painted in robin's-egg blue with cream-colored wainscoting. The costumes by Deborah J. Caney are exactly late 1960's London, from the bobby's blue cap to the secretary's pink high heels. But while the production is lovely to look at, it is not as delightful to hold."
2006-05-21T00:00:00Z,"What if the slowly emerging opposition to contraception is much more than an effort to inhibit promiscuity, promote youthful abstinence or contend that contraception is really a type of abortion? What if it is ultimately an effort to condemn any action intended to prevent procreation? We may be dealing with a mind-set aimed at eventually controlling private marital behavior. I suspect most people are critical of Iranian mullahs, who control dress codes and the public behavior of unmarried people. Are we quietly edging toward a similar effort to impose state control over the desire of people, unmarried or married, to decide whether they wish to procreate? Jerry Sheinbach Lutherville, Md."
2006-05-21T00:00:00Z,"A picture caption last Sunday with the Summer Stages list of festivals misidentified the site of a concert in the San Luis Obispo Mozart Festival. It was Chapel Hill, a private chapel in Shandon, Calif., built in the mission style, not an 18th-century Spanish mission."
2006-05-21T00:00:00Z,"FROM now through the fall, the county's calendar is chockablock with art, music and cultural festivals. Have you ever wondered what it takes to get one on the map in a community? Those who have done so cite several key factors: a strong idea, a core group of dedicated volunteers and advance planning of up to a year. According to Ron Aja, outreach events director of the 40-year-old Clearwater Festival, which is scheduled for June 17 and 18 at Croton Point Park in Croton-on-Hudson: ''If you're just starting out, you need either a lot of money or a lot of time. If you don't have money, you need a lot of time to put all the pieces together in a way you can afford.'' And keep expectations low, he advises -- at least at the beginning. ''There's a growth process. Unless you can afford big names, you need to let the festival grow organically.''"

2006-05-21T00:00:00Z,"Having mastered the grape, Australians are tackling the coffee bean. A visit to Campos, a coffee bar in Sydney, or to Batch Espresso, in Melbourne, is worth the 22-hour flight from New York -- not to mention a great way to kick the jet lag. Order a ''short black,'' Aussie for espresso, or a ''flat white,'' a sort of macho cappuccino, devoid of froth. In no time, you'll discover why baristas have replaced pub owners as the anchors of many communities. How did this former British colony steeped in tea drinking succumb to coffee mania? It started in Italy in 1947, when Achilles Gaggia perfected the spresso machine -- right on cue for the post-World War II migration to Australia from southern Europe. Italians arrived en masse in the 50's and early 60's, and a generation later, espresso had seeped into the mainstream. About 10,000 cafes dot the country, so competition is fierce. At least one leading newspaper gives a barista-of-the-year award. ''Coffee Guide ... Sydney'' rates 120 of the city's top cafes. Baristas even distinguish their drinks with latte art -- motifs like roses and fern leaves. The craft has become so popular, technical colleges now give classes. IAN KELDOULIS"
2006-05-21T00:00:00Z,"To the Editor: Re ''Is Lefty Finally Showing Up?'' [April 23]: Charles Isherwood astutely observes that there is a renewed interest in unionism, exemplified by revivals of ''The Pajama Game'' and ''Awake and Sing.'' The producers he cites are not-for-profit institutions, however. Meanwhile, in Broadway's commercial sector, producers and theater owners are banding together to try to weaken if not eliminate theatrical unions: each week 10 cents of every paid admission is diverted to a strike fund for this very purpose. (The contract of Local 1 of the International Alliance of Theatrical Stage Employees, the stagehands' union, is up for renegotiation in 2007.)"
2006-05-21T00:00:00Z,"HELPING a friend with her tag sale in the Hamptons, while trying to get rid of a few of my own accumulated possessions, was not only an exhausting ordeal but a mind opener. Who ever needed any of this stuff? I vow to live only with more than what is absolutely necessary -- an unrealistic concept for anyone except the die-hard minimalist (hardly me). Yet having much less stuff around is a cleansing thought."
2006-05-21T00:00:00Z,"To the Editor: ''Odd Math for 'Best High Schools' List,'' by Michael Winerip (On Education column, May 17), exposes the major flaw in Newsweek's list of America's Best High Schools: that it is based on the percentage of students taking Advanced Placement tests, without regard to how many do well on the tests."

For eight years, he has been a salesman at Harrow's, a hangarlike pool and spa store with inflated duckies dangling from the rafters. Certain phrases -- ''extruded aluminum'' and ''optional decking feature,'' for example -- have become part of his everyday vocabulary."

2006-05-21T00:00:00Z,"While fancy liquid soaps may be a dime a dozen these days, C. O. Bigelow's Lemon Hand Wash seems to have struck a chord with shoppers who are snapping up bottles of the citrusy stuff and making it the latest ablutionary accessory. The hand wash made its debut this spring and swiftly sold out."
2006-05-21T00:00:00Z,"To the Editor: Michael J. Agovino hit the nail on the head in his article about New York University. I was a member of the same endangered species: local, subway-riding students. In the late 60's I was in one of the last classes in the evening division at N.Y.U. Law School before that division was shut down -- largely, we suspected, because the Harvards, Yales and Columbias do not run evening divisions for less desirable people like me. I sometimes dream of Harvard Law School recognizing its obligations to the local community and opening up an evening division. Should that ever happen, I would not be surprised to see N.Y.U. fall over itself to backtrack. Brian A. Jones Brooklyn Heights"
2006-05-21T00:00:00Z,"To the Editor: Re ''Way North of the Border'' (April 30): Immigrants here legally are O.K. But illegal immigrants have with deliberate forethought violated our borders and laws. Deport them. If there is no one to care for their children, born here, give them a choice. Take the children with them, and we will give the kids United States passports. Or put the children in the care of the state child welfare agencies."
2006-05-21T00:00:00Z,"Anyone who has a problem with contraception should spend a few days in a country where women spend their entire adult lives bearing and raising children. We have increasing problems with street kids, rampant crime of all types, malnutrition, illiteracy and low status of women, just to start. How could someone who is ''pro-life'' wish this on anyone?

2006-05-21T00:00:00Z,"FOR cinema lovers, a July bonanza awaits. Long Island film festivals are becoming showcases for new work, offering a chance to see hundreds of lovingly made films, many of which may never find mainstream distribution. Nearly all the films scheduled to come to the Island via festivals are independent, a slippery label generally meaning that they were not produced by major studios and do not have built-in distribution deals. With finished films in hand, filmmakers hunger for audiences. For the burgeoning number of independent filmmakers around the world, film festivals are the brightest hope for finding distributors."
2006-05-21T00:00:00Z,"Joe Torre's first words after the Yankees' 11-inning comeback victory yesterday spoke a lot about what is on his mind. ''It was an ugly game for a long time,'' he said. Torre, the Yankees' manager, is concerned about his team's defense. The Yankees have committed at least one error in each of their past eight games, surviving four errors yesterday to beat the Mets, 5-4."

Then, in a split-second maneuver, she bent a knee and threw a hip to one side like a weapon. Her class tried to follow suit, but that smoothness eluded them. ''No bouncing!'' Ms. Kores admonished."
2006-05-21T00:00:00Z,"No longer a cow town, Bozeman -- in Big Sky Country, Montana -- has been nicknamed Boz Angeles because of an influx of Californians and celebrities. This has resulted in ranchers cashing out and Wal-Mart moving in, although downtown Bozeman still has plenty of charm, along with mountain views. And while it has been known to snow in August, on most weekends you'll find the whole town -- and its many dogs -- floating down the Madison and Yellowstone Rivers on inner tubes."
2006-05-21T00:00:00Z,"Weak demand for some European sailings is leading to some deep discounts for summer cruises in the Mediterranean and Northern Europe. Earlier this month, Holland America Line, which has five ships in Europe this year, one more than in 2005, cut prices by 30 percent or more off brochure rates on four Baltic cruises departing May through September. For example, most of its 12-day Best of the Baltic voyage on the Rotterdam, right, sailing from London to Copenhagen in June and July, now start at $1,499 a person based on double occupancy, down from $2,349.

2006-05-21T00:00:00Z,"ASHLEY KAHN was in one of those sublime yet ridiculous situations a few years ago when he stumbled upon his writerly epiphany. He had spent most of the previous dozen years as a road or tour manager for rock acts and he happened to be in Memphis helping run a tour for Britney Spears. ''I had taken some of the dancers over to Graceland for a tour during the afternoon and, at the same time, I was editing a piece on the 40th anniversary of 'Kind of Blue,' one of Miles Davis's masterpieces,'' he said. ''So there I was on the cellphone on a bench at Graceland trying to explain modal jazz to an editor while Britney's dancers were, I don't know, crying at Elvis's grave. It was pretty funny.''"

2006-05-21T00:00:00Z,"To the Editor: Carole Getzoff (''The Demon Shopper of Fordham Road,'' May 14) pulled me back in time to similar childhood memories. I, too, grew up in the Northeast Bronx -- not Pelham Bay but Parkchester -- and Alexander's on Fordham Road was the change-of-season mecca of shopping. The paired shoes, the success of the hunt, the whining (me) when my mother picked out serviceable but not necessarily stylish clothing. The hours (or so it seemed) of measuring, nipping, tucking, all while rotating so slowly on the stepstool. All this done while my brother was allowed, most unfairly, to watch TV or go ''down'' to play!"

Some congregated around cars while they sipped from plastic cups, while others followed a flashlight-waving attendant toward the back door of a 19th-century church. Once inside, they handed their casserole dishes to the evening's gray-haired but youthful host, John Friedlander, a real estate agent."
2006-05-21T00:00:00Z,"Paramount Classics is pulling out the political stops to pump its documentary about global warming, ''AN INCONVENIENT TRUTH,'' which arrives just at the moment when the broader culture seems ready to pay attention. The film had its premiere at Sundance but, oddly, did not make a big splash there. It features former Vice President AL GORE as he travels from place to place ringing alarm bells (which is not the same as being alarmist) about global warming; it also intersperses science with Mr. Gore's personal journey into activism. The studio has tapped into political grass-roots groups to promote the film, but you needn't be an activist to find this either interesting or relevant. Opens Wednesday at Sunshine Cinema, 143 East Houston Street, (212) 330-8182, and AMC Loews Lincoln Square, 1998 Broadway, (212) 505-6397; and at the Arclight Hollywood in Los Angeles, (323) 464-4226, and the Monica in Santa Monica, (310) 394-9741. If you're into dark Gothic tales with more than a hint of forbidden sex, see ''THE KING,'' which opened on Friday in Manhattan and expands to five more cities on June 9. The gifted GAEL GARCÍA BERNAL plays a young dreamer just out of the Navy who travels to Corpus Christi, Tex., to find his father, played by WILLIAM HURT. But the father, now a pastor, would rather forget this reminder of a sinning past. As the young man continues to insinuate himself into the family's life, and that of his half-sister, the stage is set for violence and, ultimately, tragedy. MILO ADDICA, whose credits include ''Monster's Ball'' and ''Birth,'' wrote the screenplay with JAMES MARSH, who directed. Sunshine Cinema, 143 East Houston Street, (212) 330-8182."

2006-05-21T00:00:00Z,"The Hong Kong fashion company Shanghai Tang has taken a great leap forward in recent years, thanks to Joanne Ooi, its creative director since late 2001. ''We've transformed the brand from a high-end, touristic Chinese emporium into modern clothes with a Chinese touch,'' said Ms. Ooi, a native of Singapore. ''I get my ideas from China. I don't read fashion magazines or go to runway shows for inspiration. I prefer to visit a province in China to see how a certain ethnic group dresses or to read a biography of the Empress Dowager.'' Ms. Ooi, 38, said she considered wearing all black to be ''a cop-out, a form of laziness,'' and described her own aesthetic as ''powerful femininity.'' She explained: ''I never dress in girlie clothes, I don't wear ruffles. During that big Victorian lace moment I bought a token shirt on a whim, and I never wore it.'' Her favorite designers are the flounce-free Azzedine Alaïa, Helmut Lang, Junya Watanabe and Missoni."

Suib, the head of the university's department of chemistry, said he studies ''Plain and Painted Parts'' every day. He looks at the beakers, the spectrographs and the other scientific instruments incorporated into the work by the artist, Robert Cumming.

About 20 million people live within 50 miles of the Sound, and it seems sometimes as if all of them at once are either putting something into it (sewage, fertilizer, pesticides, natural gas platforms) or taking something out (striped bass, flounder, clams, lobsters). Left to itself, the Sound would surely regain its footing as a stable, healthy ecosystem."

President and Chief Executive Officer of Paragon Honda, Paragon Acura, and White Plains Honda died quietly with his family at his side, on May 10, 2006, in Westchester, NY. Mr. Singer died from complications due to cancer; he was 72 years of age. As a devoted husband, father and grandfather he leaves behind a legacy of accomplishments and achievements earned with an unparallel combination of dignity, drive and respect for all of those around him. Mr. Singer was a Holocaust survivor, a veteran of the Korean War, an entrepreneur, a marathon runner, and a collector of antique automobiles; his son said appropriately, at his father's funeral service, ''My Father embodied the American Dream.'' His eloquent speech, his elegant touch, mixed with his iron willed determination earned him the nickname the ''silk hammer.'' Perhaps his greatest gift of all was his ability to cause ordinary people to conduct themselves in extraordinary ways, using encouragement, thoughtfulness, and selflessness as his tools. Mr Singer is survived by his wife Edith, two daughters, Michelle and Karen and his son Cory. Other surviving family members include his sisters Susan and Katherine, and his six grandchildren Anna, Lauren, Danielle, Julian, Isaac, and Samuel."

2006-05-21T00:00:00Z,There were so many issues raised in Russell Shorto's article that I almost don't know where to begin.

2006-05-21T00:00:00Z,"The American orchestral scene has seemed volatile of late, with lots of changings of the guard: new music directors, departing general managers and so on. The PITTSBURGH SYMPHONY was part of this trend last season, when it announced the replacement of its music director, Mariss Jansons, with a triumvirate (Andrew Davis, Yan Pascal Tortelier and Marek Janowski). For its Carnegie concert this week, however, the orchestra is going with the tried and true: the star conductor CHRISTOPH VON DOHNANYI, who has served as music director in Cleveland but never in Pittsburgh. Mr. Dohnanyi's acute, precise music making may be a contrast to Mr. Jansons's more expressive approach, but it's like comparing different kinds of caviar. The program includes Bartok, Haydn and Tchaikovsky's ''Pathétique.'' Tuesday at 8 p.m., Carnegie Hall, (212) 247-7800; $26 to $89. One keeps coming back to the Metropolitan Museum's interesting ''PIANO FORTE'' series, featuring strong pianists in a rather intricately conceived group of concerts involving three different pianos and three different pairings of composers. Finishing off the season is Bach and Brahms in the capable hands of FREDERIC CHIU, who offers a kind of understated virtuosity that serves the music more than the performer (a good thing), and whose Bach is particularly fine. Thursday at 8 p.m., (212) 570-3939; $40. Left to my own devices, I might check out the EDGAR MEYER YOUNG ARTISTS CONCERT to hear what Mr. Meyer, the versatile classical-bluegrass bass player and composer, can achieve with a group of young fiddlers, classical violinists, cellists and even a dobro player. Sunday at 7:30 p.m., Zankel Hall, Carnegie Hall; $15. Or, expanding my horizons still further, I might take in the final concert of the ''NEW SOUNDS LIVE'' series at Merkin Concert Hall, which has covered everything from Meredith Monk to Bang on a Can, and which this week presents two new-music groups the series calls ''post-rock,'' RACHEL'S and CLOGS. Thursday at 8 p.m., 129 West 67th Street, Manhattan, (212) 501-3330; $20."

It made him a pop star when he proclaimed a monumentally orchestrated despair in the 1966 Walker Brothers hit ''The Sun Ain't Gonna Shine Anymore.'' He moved from Los Angeles to London, where the Walker Brothers -- not his brothers and not his last name, Engel -- became pop idols for a few years. There he embarked on his own increasingly idiosyncratic songwriting career: from pop-rock to singing Jacques Brel to what can only, and incompletely, be called art songs."

Working as a journalist in Mississippi for a handful of years, I found my past connected me to so many people. Crafting racially charged stories, I saw myself in the eyes of interviewed after interviewed. No, I didn't know what it was like to be perceived as scary because my melanin shaded me darker. But I knew what it was like to wear out-of-style clothes and want the shoes and cooler lunches that others had. As a lesbian, I knew what it was like to feel out of place."

His shock of vertical hair is mostly gray, and he retains a boyish sweetness and openness of spirit, delighting in the warm response of the audience and the critics, who were themselves mainly delighted with ''Volver.''

Anyone who knows me, knows that I go big or I go home. It's sort of the mantra of my life. For example, I stumbled into stand up comedy earlier last year and decided to test the waters. I skipped the open mics at the hole in the wall bars; I skipped practicing my routine in front of familiar friends and faces. Instead, I flew to LA and hit the stage at the Improv and The Laugh Factory. My friends couldn't believe that I had the wherewithal to get on stage at such renowned comedy institutions and contend with the professionals. I have to admit, sashaying past pictures of comedic geniuses such as Robin Williams, Tim Allen, and Jay Leno made me a little nervous. As I attempted to steady my heart before the host said my name, I scribbled a reminder at the top of my notes that a mentor had said along the way, ""Never be afraid to succeed."" With that, I jumped on stage. I was swimming with the big fishes and I had a blast doing it. If you're looking for someone to make you laugh, don't pick me, it didn't go very well.

Next in the top 5 were Chicago O'Hare (76.5 million); Los Angeles International (61.5 million); Dallas/Fort Worth International (59.2 million); and McCarran International in Las Vegas (44 million). Passenger traffic is defined as the total of arriving and departing passengers, though connecting passengers are counted only once. Meanwhile, airlines have fewer employees to handle the crush.

What's in are a platinum skull encased in diamonds and the latest rendering of ''The Virgin Mother,'' his 35-foot-tall, 13.5-ton bronze statue exposing the bones, muscle tissue and fetus of a hugely pregnant woman. First the skull, which Mr. Hirst, right, described in an interview with The Observer of London as ''certainly the biggest single undertaking by a jeweler since the crown jewels,'' Agence France-Presse reported. Mr. Hirst said the work, titled ''For the Love of God,'' will consist of a human skull, cast in platinum and covered in 8,500 diamonds at a cost of $15 million to $18.8 million. ''The biggest expense will be the 50-carat beauty that will sit on the forehead,'' he said, adding: ''The only part of the original skull that will remain will be the teeth. You need that grotesque element for it to work as a piece of art.'' Explaining the artistic impulse, Mr. Hirst said: ''I just want to celebrate life by saying to hell with death. What better way of saying that than by taking the ultimate symbol of death and covering it in the ultimate symbol of luxury, desire and decadence?'' ''The Virgin Mother'' went on view yesterday in the courtyard outside the Royal Academy of Arts in London, the BBC reported. An earlier rendering was installed in 2005 outside Lever House in Manhattan. Madonna With Mirrors Religion and entertainment don't intersect only in ''The Da Vinci Code.''

Promoting her new album, ''Confessions on a Dance Floor'' (Warner Brothers), before an audience that included her kabbalah instructor, Rabbi Yehuda Berg, as well as Nicole Richie and Rosie O'Donnell, Madonna was 50 minutes late when she started the show by popping out of a mirrored ball in sadomasochistic riding gear (with whip), singing ''Future Lovers'' while four bare-chested male dancers writhed with ball gags in their mouths. Her tour will continue in North America for two months and begin a five-week European leg in Wales on July 30. Mariah Carey will tour for the first time in more than three years, beginning on Aug. 5 in Miami, Billboard reported. She will appear on Aug. 23 and Aug. 29 at Madison Square Garden, on Aug. 25 at the Mohegan Sun Arena in Uncasville, Conn., and on Aug. 27 in East Rutherford, N.J. Ticket sales for the tour, promoting her hit album ''The Emancipation of Mimi'' (Island/Def Jam), begin on June 2."

The speculation was fueled in part because last year other Hollywood actors who were not nominated for their stage work -- Denzel Washington and Jessica Lange, for example -- were not part of the ceremony. The other presenters announced yesterday were Ralph Fiennes, a nominee in the acting category for ''Faith Healer,'' and Cynthia Nixon, nominated in the same category for ''Rabbit Hole''; Martin Short, whose show ''Martin Short: Fame Becomes Me'' will open on Broadway in August; Alfre Woodard, who was on Broadway in 2004 and has had a recurring role this year on ''Desperate Housewives''; Eric McCormack, from ''Will & Grace,'' currently in previews for Neil LaBute's ''Some Girl(s)'' at the MCC Theater off Broadway; and Anna Paquin, an Academy Award winner who has been in several Off Broadway plays.

2006-05-23T00:00:00Z,"There are several South Korean films at Cannes this year, including ''The Unforgiven,'' an impressive first feature from Yoon Jong-bin. The film, which is screening out of the main competition in a section called Un Certain Regard, follows a sensitive young man (he listens to Belle and Sebastian) through the brutalizing first years of his military service. The film's complex narrative structure cost it some viewers during its first press screening (the scandalously bad projection didn't help), but those who stuck with it were rewarded by a film that, much like Roman Polanski's ''Pianist,'' shows how individuals can be broken by systems of power bit by soul-crushing bit. Mr. Yoon also wrote the script and plays one of the two pivotal supporting roles, as yet another young man who slips under the boot. Another offering from South Korea -- and the best film I've seen to date at this year's festival -- is ''The Host,'' which for some reason is screening outside the main festival program in a parallel section called the Directors' Fortnight. Directed by Bong Joon-ho, who made the policier ''Memories of Murder,'' this terrific hybrid-genre fantasy about a mutant creature with a lotuslike mouth and a steady appetite has been alternately described as a monster movie and a science fiction thriller, but is also a comedy, a family drama, a political critique and, at times, a seriously scary freak-out. Mr. Bong can shift moods and tones on a dime, and when the loudly appreciative audience wasn't laughing at the witty dialogue it was shrieking at tensely wound scenes as effective as any in Steven Spielberg's ''War of the Worlds.''

2006-05-23T00:00:00Z,"Abbreviated sneak peeks of studio movies are a publicity ritual at Cannes, and this year is no different. Last week, Paramount showed 20 minutes of one of its end-of-the-year great hopes, Bill Condon's ''Dreamgirls,'' and on Sunday it unveiled 20 minutes of Oliver Stone's ''World Trade Center,'' about two Port Authority police trapped under the rubble of the World Trade Center. (The film is to open in August.) The excerpt was shown before a screening of Mr. Stone's ''Platoon,'' his 1986 drama about the Vietnam War, showing here in the Cannes Classics section. After taking the stage with the three stars of ''Platoon'' -- Willem Dafoe, Tom Berenger and Charlie Sheen -- Mr. Stone spoke very briefly, in French, about what he called his ''work in progress.'' He noted that the special effects looked like something out of a Japanese science fiction film (they didn't) and that ''the truth must exist in some way to confront power and extremism.'' These words were followed by 20 unnerving minutes in which we follow a Port Authority officer, played by Nicolas Cage, from his predawn rise to when the second tower collapses on him. It would be both impossible and unfair to say more, other than that the footage looked good and was very upsetting to watch, primarily because it includes images of the actual burning towers. (That said, Mr. Cage's mustache does elicit concern since bad hair sometimes portends a bad film; witness Mr. Stone's ''Alexander.'') Like ''United 93,'' this clip made me wonder why Hollywood seems so eager to turn this raw national wound into entertainment. MANOHLA DARGIS"

''Housewives'' (with Brenda Strong, below) delivered 23.96 million viewers to a two-hour episode that included ''Lost''-like flashbacks to the early days of the neighbors' lives. (Last May's finale brought in more than 30 million viewers, and a much higher rating in the 18-to-49 demographic.) Earlier, ''Home Edition'' was broadcast in two parts. The 7 p.m. episode drew 8.25 million viewers in Nielsen's estimates, and the one at 8 p.m. brought in a more robust 13.59 million, opposite CBS's season finale of ''Cold Case'' (13.1 million). Fox's season-enders of ''The Simpsons'' (8.23 million) and ''Family Guy'' (8.07 million) put the network in second place for the night among adults 18 to 49.

2006-05-23T00:00:00Z,"At first glance, it would be hard to imagine a movie more immediately topical than ''The Caiman,'' Nanni Moretti's new film about Silvio Berlusconi, the media tycoon turned politician who has dominated Italian public life for at least a decade. Indeed, ''The Caiman,'' which was released in Italy a few weeks before the recent Italian elections and which screened for the press here Monday morning, may risk pushing timeliness to the point of obsolescence, given Mr. Berlusconi's narrowly achieved and grudgingly conceded defeat last month by a center-left coalition led by Romano Prodi. It was therefore perhaps inevitable that the first question asked of Mr. Moretti at the post-screening news conference was whether the election had changed his perception of the movie -- which some in Italy believe may have influenced the outcome -- and its political message."

But her endorsement of the Clean Energy Transition, with its narrow emphasis upon currently deployable renewable technologies, is also equally ineffective, because these technologies are now too small in output or too localized, and are often not competitive in today's energy markets without subsidy. The Clean Energy Transition agenda is a positive step, but it seriously underestimates the scale and types of changes needed."

Otherwise, the rocky hills are dotted with white and yellow flowers and quiet stands of pine and eucalyptus. It was my second week as the globe-trotting Frugal Traveler, and I was beginning to wonder if I had made a wrong turn. Bealo, for all its rustic charms, is not easy to reach without a car. From Porto, Portugal, I made my way north using the region's network of inexpensive buses and trains, dropping 9 euros here, 2.50 euros there. But none of the buses actually went to Bealo proper. About nine miles from Bealo, I finally got off the bus and called Miguel, a person I'd never met, who'd been text messaging me all day with offers to pick me up."

2006-05-24T00:00:00Z,"The editor of an Internet newspaper faces prosecution for publishing a satirical article mocking President Vladimir V. Putin's recent proposal to address Russia's demographic crisis by encouraging families to have more children, news agencies reported. Vladimir Rakhmankov, editor of the Web site Cursive in the Ivanovo region northeast of Moscow, said his article, published May 18, contrasted Mr. Putin's proposal with an announcement that animals in the local zoo were mating at a high rate. He called Mr. Putin ''Russia's phallic symbol.'' Prosecutors questioned him the next day and shuttered his office the day after that. The Web site was also closed. Mr. Rakhmankov faces a fine and up to a year in prison for violating an article of the criminal code that prohibits insulting public officials. ''It was a light article, not even satire,'' Mr. Rakhmankov said in telephone interview. ''I saw it as funny.'' STEVEN LEE MYERS (NYT)"

''Ministers cannot express their opinions,'' Mr. Prodi said. ''They must speak about decisions, their consequences and their implementation.''

When I get a whiff of it in the supermarket, or when a plate of pasta with pesto makes its way into my vicinity as it did this week, I want to grab a bunch and start cooking. When I was learning how to cook, fresh basil (I grew up with dried, a substance that we could all do without) meant pesto, and pesto meant pasta. But just as we've learned further roles for basil (including, yes, ice cream), we now know all that pesto can do, from serving as a sauce for grilled food to being the base for salad dressing."

2006-05-24T00:00:00Z,"About 90 minutes into the 8:30 a.m. press screening of Alejandro González Iñárritu's ''Babel'' on Tuesday, something strange happened. There had already been plenty of startling images and scenes in the movie, which, like Mr. González Iñárritu's previous films ''Amores Perros'' and ''21 Grams,'' splinters time and leaps across space as it tells four parallel yet connected stories. But at this moment the audience was thrown jarringly backward, as a scene we had witnessed some time earlier seemed to be occurring all over again. Was this another example of Mr. González Iñárritu playing with chronology? No, it was something much more shocking and, at the same time, fairly banal. At a festival that prides itself on fastidious attention to technical detail, someone in the projection booth had mixed up the reels. The lapse was soon noticed, the audience began to make noise, and the house lights came up briefly before the movie resumed, in proper sequence."

2006-05-24T00:00:00Z,"Consider the strange case of Bruno Dumont. In 1997 Cannes showed that French filmmaker's feature debut, ''Life of Jesus,'' outside the main selection in the parallel program, Directors' Fortnight. The film, which follows a group of unemployed young people in a desolate town in Normandy, received a special mention and subsequently hit the festival rounds. Like critics, festival programmers tend to have a proprietary relationship with directors they feel they have had a hand in discovering, so when Mr. Dumont was invited back to Cannes two years later with his second film, ''Humanity,'' it was no surprise that this time he was welcomed into the main competition. During its first press screening ''Humanity'' suffered a fair share of critical derision, telegraphed with choruses of giggles, but nonetheless picked up three major awards. Cannes understandably passed on Mr. Dumont's follow-up film, ''Twentynine Palms,'' a violent folly about two Europeans tooling around the California desert in a symbolically overloaded Hummer. Now Mr. Dumont is back in competition at Cannes with ''Flandres,'' about a young French farmer named Demester who goes off to fight in some unnamed war in an unspecified Arab country. Once again, the filmmaker's favorite themes and tropes are mostly present, notably the narcoleptic pacing, human faces as cragged as landscapes, ritualistic rutting and, regrettably, allusions to Robert Bresson, one of the art's holy men."

Born in Detroit, Michigan, Mr. Hollander was the second of four sons of Emil and Berte Hollander. His father led an orchestra that accompanied the then silent movies and his early life was spent traveling with his family throughout the eastern United States. During World War II, he served with the Marines in the Pacific Theater. He subsequently attended the State University of Iowa at Iowa City, receiving his Master's degree from its School of Journalism in 1952. He worked for Moody's Financial News, for the New York Post and finally for the New York Times where he spent most of his professional life. He worked on the real estate desk there for 16 years until his retirement. According to his colleagues, he was the epitome of an old-time newspaperman with his Lou Grant smile and cigar and daily lunch at Gough's, a now defunct newsmen's watering hole, who totally lived his passion, to be a meticulous, honest editor. Mr. Hollander's wife Shirley died in 1983. He met his companion Janet Bertomen, in 1985.

In their post-match poll of members who rated the team's performance, the Amerks earned a meager 4.01 on a scale of 0 to 10, with Steve Cherundolo, the right back and goat on Morocco's 90th-minute goal, rating a dismal 2.88."

In a brief hearing in High Court in London, his lawyer, Nigel Tait, said, ''The articles falsely alleged that Sir Elton issued a bizarre and absurd edict to guests'' not to approach him, ''thereby acting like old-fashioned royalty or some tin-pot dictator and exhibiting self-important, arrogant and rude behavior bordering on paranoia.'' He said that the assertions ''caused Sir Elton considerable embarrassment and distress,'' and that the newspaper had issued a prompt apology and agreed to substantial damages. He added that Sir Elton intended to donate the award to the Elton John AIDS Foundation.

But now dozens of American companies coat fabrics with minuscule silicon-based particles to transform the properties of backcountry clothing so that hikers and campers can live in the same outfits for days without any telltale smudges. Called NanoSphere, the treatment was developed by Schoeller, the Swiss textile company and promises to repel stains and keep users cool without changing the feel of the fabric. To test NanoSphere, Mike Kautz, a manager for the Appalachian Mountain Club, wore treated garments as he hiked to huts in the White Mountains of New Hampshire to clean them in preparation for summer. He got covered with mud, grease and rust in the process. He also splashed on honey, ketchup and other foods to assess which clothes were easily wiped clean and which defeated the purpose of looking unsoiled for days. KATE SIBER"

Leon Tancer died peacefully at his home in Teaneck, NJ on May 24, 2006, four days before his 90th birthday. In a career that spanned more than six decades, Dr. Tancer was Director of Obstetrics and Gynecology at three New York City intitutions: French Hospital (1949-1971), Brookdale Hospital Medical Center (1971-1984), and Maimonides Medical Center (1984-1990). He was also Professor of Clinical Obstetrics and Gynecology at New York University School of Medicine (1958-1979), at State University of New York, Health Science Center at Brooklyn (1979-1990) and at Columbia University College of Physicians and Surgeons (1990-recently). An internationally known uro-gynecologist, he was an expert on the surgical repair of fistulas and other complications of unattended childbirth. Dr. Tancer was also a sought-after teacher who traveled to medically underserved countries, such as Ethiopia, to share knowledge and surgical techniques which radically improved the lives of many women. The son of Jewish immigrants from Galicia, M. Leon Tancer graduated from Erasmus High School in Brooklyn, New York University College of Arts & Pure Science in 1936, and New York University College of Medicine in 1940. Dr. Tancer served as a Lieutenant Commander (Active Service, 1942-1946) in the US Navy during WWII before completing his postgraduate study and training at NYU School of Medicine, Harlem Hospital and French Hospital. Throughout his career, he remained close to his alma mater as President of NYU Medical Alumni (1970-1971), Director of NYU Alumni Federation (1971-1976), as a recipient of the NYU Alumni Meritorius Award in 1975, and as a 1993 recipient of the Solomon A. Berson Medical Alumni Achievement Award. ''I always thought of him as the consummate physician in his humanistic approach to the patient and her family,'' said Dr. Anthony Grieco, Associate Dean of New York University School of Medicine. ''You have no idea how important it was to have someone of his stature, someone who was looked up to as a role model, inspiring the new Berson inductees. He was a commanding figure, with excitement in his eye and in his voice, with a spark, a dynamism that never left him, even when he was ill.'' Dr. Tancer was also active in civic and Jewish affairs in Teaneck, NJ, where his two children grew up. He loved music, opera, theater and the culture of NYC. Throughout his life he was an avid and outstanding athlete and tennis player. He was the patriarch and fulcrum of the farflung but close-knit Tancer family. Dr. Tancer is survived by his beloved wife of 66 years, Norma Gorshen Tancer; his daughter, Jo Ann Tancer and her partner Martin Hennessey; his son and daughter-in-law, Steven Bennett and Nancy Kaplan Tancer; his cherished grandchildren Jason, Matthew and Lauren Tancer; his sister, Reni Tancer Kaye of Providence, RI; numerous nieces, nephews, grandnieces and grandnephews; and the hundreds of physicians whose lives and careers he sternly but lovingly shaped. He made a meaningful impact on everyone who knew him. His loss is deeply mourned by all. Services Thursday 11:45 AM at ''The Riverside'' 76th Street and Amsterdam Avenue. $(6$)TANCER--M. Leon.

But Mr. Prince is in Las Vegas working on a production of ''The Phantom of the Opera,'' which is to start previews on June 12.

That is, until August 1993, when a drug lord killed four police officers, and the police retaliated by killing 21 innocent people in Mr. Sá's favela, including his brother. Haunted by the incident, Mr. Sá set out to forge a different path for the children in his slum with the pulse from a fusion of rock, hip-hop, reggae and Brazilian percussion he called Banda AfroReggae.

2006-05-26T00:00:00Z,"A week after putting up for sale a historic painting of Mao Zedong, a Chinese auction house has canceled the June 3 auction of the portrait, below, saying it will probably be sent to a national museum in China. The Huachen Auction Company, which had said it planned to auction a painting that served as the model for the large portrait now hanging in Tiananmen Square, said the owner withdrew it after the government intervened this week. The potential auction of Mao's portrait, painted by Zhang Zhenshi, one of his official painters in the 1950's and 1960's, drew widespread criticism on the Internet in China and raised concerns about the historic image being sent overseas, even though it is already owned by an unidentified Chinese-American. In a statement yesterday the auction house said that after the government made ''suggestions,'' the owner withdrew the painting from Huachen's spring auction in Beijing and began negotiating with Chinese museums about a sale or donation. Measuring 36 inches by 27 inches, the portrait, believed to have been painted in the 1950's or 1960's, has been widely reproduced in China and was expected to sell for at least $120,000.

Second Stage, 307 West 43rd Street, Clinton, (212) 246-4422. Broadway * 'AWAKE AND SING!' Dreams and disappointments, hopes and fears, encouraging words and bitter put-downs clash by day and night in Clifford Odets's turbulent comedy-drama about a Jewish family struggling to stay afloat in the 1930's. A gifted roster of performers -- including Mark Ruffalo, Lauren Ambrose, Zoë Wanamaker and Ben Gazzara -- manage to locate the dreaming centers of their characters, buried beneath layers of political sloganeering, everyday gripes or street slang. And even when the focus occasionally blurs in Bartlett Sher's ultimately moving revival, Odets's zesty dialogue, in which jazzy period colloquialisms are slung around like punches at a prize fight, is a joy to hear (2:30). Belasco Theater, 111 West 44th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Charles Isherwood) * 'BRIDGE & TUNNEL' This delightful solo show, written and performed by Sarah Jones, is a sweet-spirited valentine to New York City, its polyglot citizens and the larger notion of an all-inclusive America. In 90 minutes of acutely observed portraiture gently tinted with humor, Ms. Jones plays more than a dozen men and women participating in an open-mike evening of poetry for immigrants (1:30). Helen Hayes Theater, 240 West 44th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Isherwood) 'THE COLOR PURPLE' So much plot, so many years, so many characters to cram into less than three hours. This beat-the-clock musical adaptation of Alice Walker's Pulitzer Prize-winning novel about Southern black women finding their inner warriors never slows down long enough for you to embrace it. LaChanze leads the vibrant, hard-working cast (2:40). Broadway Theater, 1681 Broadway, at 53rd Street, (212) 239-6200. (Ben Brantley) 'DIRTY ROTTEN SCOUNDRELS' The arrival of Jonathan Pryce and his eloquent eyebrows automatically makes this the season's most improved musical. With Mr. Pryce (who replaces the admirable but uneasy John Lithgow) playing the silken swindler to Norbert Leo Butz's vulgar grifter, it's as if a mismatched entry in a three-legged race had become an Olympic figure-skating pair (2:35). Imperial Theater, 249 West 45th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley) 'THE DROWSY CHAPERONE' This small and ingratiating spoof of 1920's stage frolics, as imagined by an obsessive show queen, may not be a masterpiece. But in a dry season for musicals, ''The Drowsy Chaperone'' has theatergoers responding as if they were withering house plants, finally being watered after long neglect. Bob Martin and Sutton Foster are the stand-outs in the eager, energetic cast (1:40). Marquis Theater, 1535 Broadway, at 45th Street, (212) 307-4100. (Brantley) *'FAITH HEALER' In the title role of Brian Friel's great play, Ralph Fiennes paints a portrait of the artist as dreamer and destroyer that feels both as old as folklore and so fresh that it might be painted in wet blood. Also starring Cherry Jones and the superb Ian McDiarmid, this mesmerizing series of monologues has been directed with poetic starkness by Jonathan Kent (2:35). Booth Theater, 222 West 45th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley) * 'THE HISTORY BOYS' Madly enjoyable. Alan's Bennett's play about a battle for the hearts and minds of a group of university-bound students, imported with the original British cast from the National Theater, moves with a breezy narrative swagger that transcends cultural barriers. Directed by Nicholas Hytner, with a perfectly oiled ensemble led by the superb Richard Griffiths and Stephen Campbell Moore as schoolmasters with opposing views of history and education (2:40). Broadhurst Theater, 235 West 44th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley) 'HOT FEET' A dancing encyclopedia of clichés set to the music of Earth, Wind and Fire. Numbing (2:30). Hilton Theater, 213 West 42nd Street, (212) 307-4100. (Isherwood) 'JERSEY BOYS' From grit to glamour with the Four Seasons, directed by the pop repackager Des McAnuff (''The Who's Tommy''). The real thrill of this shrink-wrapped bio-musical, for those who want something more than recycled chart toppers and a story line poured from a can, is watching the wonderful John Lloyd Young (as Frankie Valli) cross the line from exact impersonation into something far more compelling (2:30). August Wilson Theater, 245 West 52nd Street, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley) * 'THE LIEUTENANT OF INISHMORE' Please turn off your political correctness monitor along with your cellphone for Martin McDonagh's gleeful, gory and appallingly entertaining play. This blood farce about terrorism in rural Ireland, acutely directed by Wilson Milam, has a carnage factor to rival Quentin Tarantino's. But it is also wildly, absurdly funny and, even more improbably, severely moral (1:45). Lyceum Theater, 149 West 45th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley) 'THE LIGHT IN THE PIAZZA' Love is a many-flavored thing, from sugary to sour, in Adam Guettel and Craig Lucas's encouragingly ambitious and discouragingly unfulfilled new musical. The show soars only in the sweetly bitter songs performed by the wonderful Victoria Clark, as an American abroad (2:15). Beaumont Theater, Lincoln Center, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley) 'THE ODD COUPLE' Odd is not the word for this couple. How could an adjective suggesting strangeness or surprise apply to a production so calculatedly devoted to the known, the cozy, the conventional? As the title characters in Neil Simon's 1965 comedy, directed as if to a metronome by Joe Mantello, Nathan Lane and Matthew Broderick reprise their star performances from ''The Producers,'' and it's not a natural fit. Don't even consider killing yourself because the show is already sold out (2:10). Brooks Atkinson Theater, 256 West 47th Street, (212) 307-4100. (Brantley) * 'THE PAJAMA GAME' Sexual chemistry in a Broadway musical? Isn't that illegal now? If it were, then Harry Connick Jr. and Kelli O'Hara -- the white-hot stars of Kathleen Marshall's delicious revival of this 1954 musical -- would be looking at long jail terms. This intoxicating production, which features a charming supporting cast led by Michael McKean, allows grown-up audiences the rare chance to witness a bona fide adult love affair translated into hummable songs and sprightly dance (2:30). American Airlines Theater, 227 West 42nd Street, (212) 719-1300. (Brantley) *'SHINING CITY' Quiet, haunting and absolutely glorious. Conor McPherson's impeccably assembled ghost story about being alone in the crowded city of Dublin has been brought to American shores with a first-rate cast (Brian F. O'Byrne, Oliver Platt, Martha Plimpton and Peter Scanavino), directed by Robert Falls (1:45). Biltmore Theater, 261 West 47th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley) * 'SWEENEY TODD' Sweet dreams, New York. This thrilling new revival of Stephen Sondheim and Hugh Wheeler's musical, with Michael Cerveris and Patti LuPone leading a cast of 10 who double as their own musicians, burrows into your thoughts like a campfire storyteller who knows what really scares you. The inventive director John Doyle aims his pared-down interpretation at the squirming child in everyone who wants to have his worst fears both confirmed and dispelled (2:30). Eugene O'Neill Theater, 230 West 49th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley) 'TARZAN' This writhing green blob with music, adapted by Disney Theatrical Productions from the 1999 animated film, has the feeling of a super-deluxe day care center, equipped with lots of bungee cords and karaoke syntheziers, where kids can swing when they get tired of singing, and vice-versa. The soda-pop score is by Phil Collins (2:30). Richard Rodgers Theater, 226 West 46th Street, (212) 307-4747. (Brantley) 'THREE DAYS OF RAIN' In this revival of Richard Greenberg's slender, elegant drama of family disconnectedness, Julia Roberts is stiff with self-consciousness, glancingly acquainted with the two characters she plays and deeply, disturbingly beautiful. Otherwise, it is almost impossible to discern the virtues of the play itself in this wooden and splintered production, directed by Joe Mantello and also starring Paul Rudd and Bradley Cooper, who have little chance of capturing the audience's attention (2:30). Bernard B. Jacobs Theater, 242 West 45th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley) 'THE THREEPENNY OPERA' Presented as a long, pansexual orgy, Scott Elliot's numbing revival of the Brecht-Weill classic feels like a party where the hangover begins almost as soon as the evening does. The starry cast includes Alan Cumming (as Mac the Knife) and a Dietrich-like Cyndi Lauper, though only Jim Dale and Nellie McKay appear to have a clue as to what the show is about (2:40). Studio 54, 254 West 54th Street, (212) 719-1300. (Brantley) * 'THE 25TH ANNUAL PUTNAM COUNTY SPELLING BEE' The happy news for this happy-making little musical is that the move to larger quarters has dissipated none of its quirky charm. William Finn's score sounds plumper and more rewarding than it did on Off Broadway, providing a sprinkling of sugar to complement the sass in Rachel Sheinkin's zinger-filled book. The performances are flawless. Gold stars all around (1:45). Circle in the Square, 1633 Broadway, at 50th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Isherwood) 'THE WEDDING SINGER' An assembly-kit musical that might as well be called ''That 80's Show,'' this stage version of the 1998 film is all winks and nods and quotations from the era of big hair and junk bonds. The cast members, who include Stephen Lynch and Laura Benanti, are personable enough, which is not the same as saying they have personalities (2:20). Al Hirschfeld Theater, 302 West 45th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley) Off Broadway 'ANNULLA' Eileen De Felitta is charming in Emily Mann's worthy one-woman play about a Jewish woman who passed for Aryan in Nazi Germany, but too much time is devoted to less intriguing aspects of the character's life (1:20). Theater at St. Luke's, 308 West 46th Street, Clinton, (212) 239-6200. (Anita Gates) 'ASSISTED LOVING' This warm and witty monologue by Bob Morris, who contributes the Age of Dissonance column to the Sunday Styles section of The New York Times, is performed by the author, who chronicles his widowed father's and his own search for love in and around New York. Engaging, subtle and winning (1:10). Daryl Roth Theater, D-Lounge, 103 East 15th Street, at Union Square, (212) 239-6200. (George Hunka) 'BEAU BRUMMELL' Ian Kelly is funny, engaging and intensely sympathetic as the early-19th-century British fashion plate who spent his last years in exile (1:30). 59E59 Theaters, 59 East 59th Street, (212) 279-4200. (Gates) *'BILLY CONNOLLY LIVE!' This popular comedian will remind you of a Scottish George Carlin, with a bit of Eddie Izzard mixed in (2:00). 37 Arts, 450 West 37 Street, (212) 307-4100. (Jason Zinoman) 'CAGE LOVE' The new thriller by Christopher Denham -- star of ''Red Light Winter'' -- is a compulsively watchable, sometimes ridiculous drama about a man who becomes increasingly suspicious of his wife-to-be (1:30). Rattlestick Theater, 224 Waverly Place, Greenwich Village, (212) 868-4444. (Zinoman). 'CIRQUE DU SOLEIL -- CORTEO' The Cirque du Soleil's latest extravaganza, which upholds the ubiquitous Cirque standard, is a fantasy of a dead (though cheerful) clown imagining his own funeral. Unsurprisingly, his cortege is full of circus acts. (2:30). Grand Chapiteau at Randall's Island, (800) 678-5440. (John Rockwell) 'COLUMBINUS' The grim ecosphere of the average American high school is analyzed with sympathy and precision in this new play by Stephen Karam and P J Paparelli, which aims to expose the cultural and personal pathologies that gave rise to the horrific events in Littleton, Colo., in 1999, when two students went on a murderous rampage at Columbine High School, killing a dozen students and a teacher before killing themselves. Well acted and stylishly directed, the play exudes earnestness, and a measure of self-importance, too (2:00). New York Theater Workshop, 79 East Fourth Street, East Village, (212) 239-6200. (Isherwood) 'DEFIANCE' The second in John Patrick Shanley's cycle of morality plays that began with ''Doubt,'' this ambitious tale of racial relations and the military mindset on a North Carolina marine base feels both overcrowded and oddly diffuse. If ''Doubt'' has an elegant and energy-efficient sprinter's gait, ''Defiance'' progresses with a flustered air of distraction. The excellent Margaret Colin, as an officer's wife, provides a welcome shot of credibility (1:30). Manhattan Theater Club, Theater 1, 131 West 55th Street, (212) 581-1212. (Brantley) 'DRUMSTRUCK' This noisy novelty is a mixed blessing. Providing a two-foot drum on every seat, it offers an opportunity to exorcise aggressions by delivering a good beating, and, on a slightly more elevated level, it presents a superficial introduction to African culture, lessons in drumming and 90 minutes of nonstop music, song and dancing by a good-natured cast. So, while literally and figuratively giving off many good vibes, it adds up to lightweight entertainment that stops just short of pulverizing the eardrums (1:30). Dodger Stages, Stage 2, 340 West 50th Street, Clinton, (212) 239-6200. (Lawrence Van Gelder) 'HAMLET' Theater by the Blind's modest, pared-down production offers an angry, sarcastic prince; an Ophelia who won't stop singing; and a Polonius who actually seems to know what he's saying (2:15). Theater Five, 311 West 43rd Street, Clinton, (212) 868-4444. (Gates) 'JACQUES BREL IS ALIVE AND WELL AND LIVING IN PARIS' A powerfully sung revival of the 1968 revue, presented with affectionate nostalgia by the director Gordon Greenberg. As in the original, two men (Robert Cuccioli and Rodney Hicks) and two women (Natascia Diaz and Gay Marshall) perform a wide selection of Brel's plaintive ballads and stirring anthems. Ms. Marshall's captivating performance of ''Ne Me Quitte Pas,'' sung in the original French and with heart-stirring transparency, represents Brel at his best. (2:00). Zipper Theater, 336 West 37th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Isherwood) 'NOT A GENUINE BLACK MAN' Brian Copeland's solo memoir about his African-American family moving into a white suburb in the early 1970's is an engaging, if stiltedly performed, show (1:30). DR2 Theater, 103 East 15th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Zinoman) 'THE RACE' Impending fatherhood stuns a man almost speechless in this brisk trot through nine months of anxiety. Performed by the London-based troupe Gecko, ''The Race'' is a hybrid of theater and dance, and lasts just an hour. Occasionally the inventive imagery stalls, and the show seems to run out of imaginative breath, but it provides enough small-scale wizardry to please fans of physical theater (1:00). 59E59 Theaters, 59 East 59th Street, (212) 279-4200. (Isherwood) 'RED LIGHT WINTER' A frank, occasionally graphic story of erotic fixation and the havoc it can wreak on sensitive types. Written and directed by Adam Rapp, this play is both a doomy romantic drama and a morbid comedy about the anxieties of male friendship. Although somewhat contrived, it features a lovely performance by Christopher Denham as a lonely soul starved for intimacy (2:25). Barrow Street Theater, 27 Barrow Street, West Village, (212) 239-6200. (Isherwood) 'SANDRA BERNHARD: EVERYTHING BAD AND BEAUTIFUL' Sandra Bernhard was a proverbial rock star long before headline-making folks in even the most prosaic walks of life were being referred to as such. Her new show, a collection of songs interspersed with musings on her life and on public figures ranging from Britney Spears to Condoleezza Rice, is casual to the point of being offhand. That said, it's invigorating to be in the presence of a true original (2:00). Daryl Roth Theater, 101 East 15th Street, at Union Square, (212) 239-6200. (Isherwood) 'SUCKER FISH MESSIAH' Ryan Michael Teller's drama about two brothers, one on the verge of a nervous breakdown, is just a disjointed collection of monologues and encounters, several of them misogynist. (2:00). Bouwerie Lane Theater, 330 Bowery, at Bond Street, East Village, (212) 677-0060, ext. 16. (Gates) 'TRYST' A suspense drama of a distinctly old-fashioned stamp about the romance between a handsome cad (Maxwell Caulfield) and a lonely spinster (Amelia Campbell). Will the wily predator seduce and abandon the mousy milliner? Karoline Leach's play springs a few twists that lack psychological credibility but keep the plot on the boil (2:00). Promenade Theater, 2162 Broadway, at 76th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Isherwood) Off Off Broadway 'BACK OF THE THROAT' An Arab-American playwright (Yussef El Guindi) addressing the harassment of Arab-Americans after 9/11? Interesting. But the play would have been even more interesting if the harassers were something other than cardboard characters out of the J. Edgar Hoover closet (1:15). Flea Theater, 41 White Street, TriBeCa, (212) 352-3101. (Neil Genzlinger) 'I WILL COME LIKE A THIEF' The writer Trish Harnetiaux and the director Jude Domski have together created the potent outline of a parable about passive if still jittery Americans awash in government gobbledygook after 9/11 and Hurricane Katrina. But there is a staginess to their random characters that is hard to overcome, and ultimately the play, set in an American city being evacuated, does not live up to its promise (1:15). The 78th Street Theater Lab, 236 West 78th Street, (212) 868-4444. (Andrea Stevens) Long-Running Shows * 'ALTAR BOYZ' This sweetly satirical show about a Christian pop group made up of five potential Teen People cover boys is an enjoyable, silly diversion (1:30). New World Stages, 340 West 50th Street, Clinton, (212) 239-6200.(Isherwood) 'AVENUE Q' R-rated puppets give lively life lessons (2:10). Golden, 252 West 45th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley) 'BEAUTY AND THE BEAST' Cartoon made flesh, sort of (2:30). Lunt-Fontanne Theater, 205 West 46th Street, (212) 307-4747. (Brantley) 'CHICAGO' Irrefutable proof that crime pays (2:25). Ambassador Theater, 219 West 49th Street, (212) 239-6200.(Brantley) 'DOUBT, A PARABLE' (Pulitzer Prize, Best Play 2005, and Tony Award, Best Play 2005) John Patrick Shanley makes subversive use of musty conventions in the clash between the head of a parochial school and the young priest who may or may not be too fond of the boys in his charge (1:30). Walter Kerr Theater, 219 West 48th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley) 'HAIRSPRAY' Fizzy pop, cute kids, large man in a housedress (2:30). Neil Simon Theater, 250 West 52nd Street, (212) 307-4100. (Brantley) 'THE LION KING' Disney on safari, where the big bucks roam (2:45). New Amsterdam Theater, 214 West 42nd Street, (212) 307-4100. (Brantley) 'MAMMA MIA!' The jukebox that devoured Broadway (2:20). Cadillac Winter Garden Theater, 1634 Broadway, at 50th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley) 'THE PHANTOM OF THE OPERA' Who was that masked man, anyway? (2:30). Majestic Theater, 247 West 44th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley) 'THE PRODUCERS' The ne plus ultra of showbiz scams (2:45). St. James Theater, 246 West 44th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley) 'RENT' East Village angst and love songs to die for (2:45). Nederlander Theater, 208 West 41st Street, (212) 307-4100. (Brantley) 'SLAVA'S SNOWSHOW' Clowns chosen by the Russian master Slava Polunin are stirring up laughter and enjoyment. A show that touches the heart as well as tickles the funny bone (1:30). Union Square Theater, 100 East 17th Street, Flatiron district, (212) 307-4100.(Van Gelder) 'SPAMALOT' (Tony Award, Best Musical 2005) This staged re-creation of the mock-medieval movie ''Monty Python and the Holy Grail'' is basically a singing scrapbook for Python fans. Such a good time is being had by so many people that this fitful, eager celebration of inanity and irreverence has found a large and lucrative audience (2:20). Shubert Theater, 225 West 44th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley) 'WICKED' Oz revisited, with political corrections (2:45). Gershwin Theater, 222 West 51st Street, (212) 307-4100. (Brantley) Last Chance 'BASED ON A TOTALLY TRUE STORY' A chatty, autobiographical comedy by Roberto Aguirre-Sacasa about a writer for comic books who moonlights as a screenwriter and playwright. Juggling his two jobs, the busy writer begins backsliding in his unofficial third, ''being a loving, giving, emotionally available boyfriend.'' Minor-key angst ensues in this perky two hours of comic navel-gazing (2:00). Manhattan Theater Club at City Center Stage II, 131 West 55th Street, (212) 581-1212; closing on Sunday. (Isherwood) 'COWBOYS!' This melodrama spoof with gay men at the Straight Arrow Ranch makes up for what it lacks in professionalism with a good-natured goofiness (2:10). Wings Theater, 154 Christopher Street, West Village, (212) 627-2961; closing tomorrow. (Gates) 'J.A.P. CHRONICLES: THE MUSICAL' Isabel Rose, an energetic overachiever, wrote and performs this one-woman show based on her own novel. To her credit, she was willing to hack apart her book to make a viable work of theater, and belts out tunes that are catchy (if uninspired), but the result feels superficial, trafficking in the kinds of obvious stereotypes her background leads you to believe she'd like to challenge (1:30). Perry Street Theater, 31 Perry Street, Greenwich Village, (212) 868-4444; closing tomorrow. (Anne Midgette) * 'LANDSCAPE OF THE BODY' This terrific revival, directed by Michael Greif, identifies the unbearable wistfulness of being in John Guare's delirious heartbreaker of a comedy from 1977. The top-flight cast is led by Lili Taylor and Sherie Rene Scott as sisters -- one living, one a singing ghost -- who move in and out of a lyrical and sordid world where tabloid prurience has become a religion (2:20). Signature Theater's Peter Norton Space, 555 West 42nd Street, Clinton, (212) 244-7529; closing on Sunday. (Brantley) 'LESTAT' A musical sleeping pill, adapted from Anne Rice's ''Vampire Chronicles'' and featuring songs by Elton John and Bernie Taupin, that could well give the makers of Ambien a run for their money. Dare to look upon this tale of the undead and keep your eyelids from growing heavier and heavier and heavier (2:30). Palace Theater, 1564 Broadway, near 47th Street, (212) 307-4100; closing on Sunday. (Brantley) 'THE NECKLACE' In eight parts, shown two at a time, this loony show -- set in a spooky house with a mysterious history -- helps revive an old and beloved form: the serial (2:15). The Ohio Theater, 66 Wooster Street, SoHo; (212) 868-4444; closing tomorrow. (Zinoman). 'A SPALDING GRAY MATTER' This darkly comic solo show, written and performed by Michael Brandt, tells the story of the playwright's own tragic sickness and recovery. It proves that aping Spalding Gray is not easy (1:10). The New Group at Theater Row, Clurman Theater, 410 West 42nd Street, Clinton, (212) 279-4200; closing tomorrow. (Zinoman) * 'STUFF HAPPENS' Daniel Sullivan's sharp, invigorating production of David Hare's journalistic drama about the road to war in Iraq is conducted on the modest scale of a town-hall meeting. The characters (who have names like Bush and Blair) seem less like destiny-shaping gods than the ego trippers in your office. If that means they're too close for comfort, then ''Stuff Happens'' is doing its job (2:50). The Public Theater, 425 Lafayette Street, at Astor Place, East Village, (212) 239-6200; closing on Sunday. (Brantley) 'YOUNG PLAYWRIGHTS FESTIVAL XXIV' An interesting evening of one-acts by three young women who were 18 when their plays were selected offers a glimpse -- at times humorous -- of what some teenage Americans are thinking about. The fact that the subjects are frequent headline topics, like alcoholism, incest, attempted suicide and the failure of science and organized religion to heal the world, should not surprise (2:00). Peter Jay Sharp Theater, 416 West 42nd Street, Clinton, (212) 279-4200; closing tomorrow. (Stevens) Movies Ratings and running times are in parentheses; foreign films have English subtitles. Full reviews of all current releases, movie trailers, show times and tickets: nytimes.com/movies. 'AKEELAH AND THE BEE' (PG, 112 minutes) Eleven-year-old Akeelah Anderson (Keke Palmer) is a bright but unmotivated girl who can outspell anyone at her South Los Angeles middle school. When Akeelah gets a taste of victory by winning the school bee, she throws herself into studying for the regional one, coached by a stern English professor named Joshua Larabee (Laurence Fishburne). But Akeelah's mother (Angela Bassett) objects to her daughter's obsession with what she considers a ''game.'' The innate suspense and charm of the spelling bee, along with a trio of crack performances, turn what is, in essence, a formulaic picture into something more satisfying: an underdog tale that manages to inspire without being sappy. (Dana Stevens) * 'ARMY OF SHADOWS' (No rating, 140 minutes, in French) Dark as pitch and without compromise, Jean-Pierre Melville's 1969 masterpiece centers on the feats of a small band of Resistance fighters operating during the occupation. Brilliant, harrowing, essential viewing. (Manohla Dargis) 'ART SCHOOL CONFIDENTIAL' (R, 102 minutes) A lump of misanthropy from Terry Zwigoff and Daniel Clowes, who made the sublime ''Ghost World.'' This time they plod through a grouchy attack on -- and example of -- the pretense and hypocrisy of self-declared artists. John Malkovich's performance as a drawing instructor is sly and insightful, a glimpse at what the movie might have been. (A. O. Scott) * 'CLEAN' (R, 110 minutes) This fine French movie, written and directed by Olivier Assayas, is one of the few fictional films to evoke realistically the grubby texture of existence for second- and third-tier rock celebrities crumbling under a combination of fading renown and drug addiction. Maggie Cheung and Nick Nolte offer memorable portrayals as a recovering junkie and her compassionate father-in-law. (Stephen Holden) 'THE DA VINCI CODE' (PG-13, 148 minutes) Theology aside, ''The Da Vinci Code'' is, above all, a murder mystery. And as such, once it gets going, Ron Howard's movie has its pleasures. He and the screenwriter Akiva Goldsman have deftly rearranged some elements of the plot, unkinking a few overelaborate twists and introducing others that keep the action moving along. The movie does, however, take a while to accelerate, popping the clutch and leaving rubber on the road as it tries to establish who is who, what he's doing and why. So I certainly can't support any calls for boycotting or protesting this busy, trivial, inoffensive film. Which is not to say that I'm recommending that you go see it. (Scott) * 'DOWN IN THE VALLEY' (R, 114 minutes) This allegorical neo-Western set in the San Fernando Valley has dreams as big as the fantasies that consume its protagonist, a Stetson-wearing suburban cowboy (Edward Norton) who is not what he appears to be. How much you like it will depend on your appetite for the kind of cultural metaphors that David Jacobson flings onto the screen with a reckless abandon. (Holden) * 'INSIDE MAN' (R, 128 minutes) The latest from Spike Lee takes a familiar setup -- a Wall Street bank heist that mutates into a hostage crisis -- and twists it ever so slightly and nicely. Among the film's most sustained pleasures are its holy trinity -- Denzel Washington, Clive Owen and Jodie Foster -- and the best lineup of pusses and mugs outside ''The Sopranos.'' (Dargis) * 'L'ENFANT (THE CHILD)' (R, 100 minutes, in French) The latest from the Belgian brothers Jean-Pierre and Luc Dardenne involves a young thief (Jérémie Renier) who one day sells his newborn son for a fat envelope of cash. What interests the Dardennes is not only how a man would sell a child as casually as a slab of beef, but also whether a man like this, having committed such a repellent offense, can find redemption. (Dargis) 'MISSION: IMPOSSIBLE III' (PG-13, 126 minutes) Er, this time it's personal, as Tom Cruise plays a dashing operative for a clandestine organization who sweeps a simpering brunette off her feet. Directed, without much flair, by J. J. Abrams, the small-screen auteur behind ''Lost'' and ''Alias.'' (Dargis) 'POSEIDON' (PG-13, 100 minutes) Wolfgang Petersen's ''Poseidon'' is unlikely to replace the original in the hearts of action-hungry moviegoers, though it will probably expunge the memory of the earlier, made-for-TV remake (and also, perhaps, of the 1979 sequel, ''Beyond the Poseidon Adventure''). The hard-working cast does a lot of screaming, climbing and death-defying in soaking-wet evening wear, but they can hardly hope to match the ripe absurdity of Shelley Winters, Red Buttons, Gene Hackman and Ernest Borgnine. (Scott) 'THE PROMISE' (PG-13, 103 minutes, in Mandarin) A lavish spectacle -- somewhere between grand opera and cartoon -- from Chen Kaige, about a love triangle involving a general, a slave and a cursed princess. Sometimes breathtaking, sometimes out of breath. (Scott) 'REVOLOUTION' (No rating, 80 minutes) ''RevoLOUtion'' is the story of Lou Benedetti (Bret Carr), a washed-up Brooklyn palooka who overcomes a chronic stammer and serious anger issues in his quest to become a motivational speaker. But with his nonstop jabbering and Woody-Allen-on-helium voice, Lou is so annoying that not even a grumpy cameo by Burt Young and some lovely shots of the Brooklyn Bridge can save a movie as punch-drunk as its benighted protagonist. (Jeannette Catsoulis) 'RUSSIAN DOLLS' (No rating, 129 minutes, in English, Russian, French and Spanish) The sequel to the international hit ''L'Auberge Espagnole'' belongs to a long line of airy French films that induce a pleasant buzz of Euro-envy. Like its forerunner, it is a generational group portrait of young, smart, sexy, well-educated Europeans at work and play filmed in a style that might be called Truffaut Lite. (Holden) 'SEE NO EVIL' (R, 84 minutes) In ''See No Evil,'' the professional wrestler Glen Jacobs (a k a Kane) plays a lumbering psychopath intent on butchering the juvenile delinquents on cleanup duty at the hotel where he's holed up. Propelled by an inebriated camera that careers off walls and, at one point, roots around in an empty eye socket, the movie soon devolves into a bloodily creative string of mutilations and impalings. (Catsoulis) * 'STICK IT' (PG-13, 103 minutes) Somersaulting through happy clichés and unexpected invention, this spry teenage comedy gets everything right. (Nathan Lee) * 'THREE TIMES' (No rating, 135 minutes, in Mandarin and Taiwanese dialect) For this hypnotically beautiful cinematic trilogy, the Taiwanese director Hou Hsiao-hsien, one of the modern masters of the art, brings us love and loss in three different time periods. (Dargis) * '12 AND HOLDING' (R, 94 minutes) This poignant, beautifully acted film, directed by Michael Cuesta (''L.I.E.''), flashes a laser beam on the moment between childhood and adolescence, when unguarded emotions and fantasies still rule, but adult experience beckons. (Holden) 'UNITED 93' (R, 115 minutes) A scrupulously tasteful Hollywood re-creation of the downing of the fourth plane hijacked by Muslim terrorists on Sept. 11 and easily the feel-bad American movie of the year. Written and directed by Paul Greengrass, whose earlier films include ''Bloody Sunday.'' (Dargis) 'WAH-WAH' (R, 97 minutes) Scored to the death rattle of the British Empire in Africa, ''Wah-Wah'' observes the disintegration of the Compton family through the eyes of its young son. In his writing and directorial debut the actor Richard E. Grant probes the pungent details of his own childhood in Swaziland, vividly recreating a community steeped in boredom, booze and casual adultery. (Catsoulis) * 'WATER' (PG-13, 114 minutes, in Hindi) Set in India in 1938, ''Water'' focuses on a group of widows condemned by Hindu law to live in an institution on the banks of the River Ganges. The arrival of a high-spirited 8-year-old girl encourages one widow to question her faith and another to begin a love affair with a Gandhian idealist. Bobbing back and forth between romantic melodrama and spiritual inquiry, ''Water'' is an exquisitely beautiful film about the institutionalized oppression of an entire class of women. (Catsoulis) Film Series ROBERT ALTMAN (Through June 8) This weekend's films at the Museum of the Moving Image's 22-film retrospective of Mr. Altman's work include ''Gosford Park'' (2001), about snobbery and intrigue during an English country-house weekend; ''Health'' (1980) , a satire about physical fitness and presidential politics; and ''Short Cuts'' (1993), the director's interpretation of Raymond Carver stories about life in Los Angeles. 35th Avenue at 36th Street, Astoria, Queens, (718) 784-0077; $10.

BOUNCING SOULS (Thursday) The punk kings of New Jersey, Bouncing Souls have been going strong for nearly two decades, with no signs of slowing down; their new album, ''The Gold Record'' (Epitaph), is chock-full of adrenalized, ''Hey! Hey! Hey!'' shout-alongs. They begin a sold-out six-night run at the Knitting Factory. At 6:30 p.m., 74 Leonard Street, TriBeCa, (212) 219-3006. (Ben Sisario) * T BONE BURNETT (Thursday) Best known as a producer who stylishly reimagines American roots music -- he made the soundtracks to ''O Brother, Where Art Thou?'' and ''Cold Mountain'' and has worked with Gillian Welch and Los Lobos, among others -- Mr. Burnett recently offered a reminder of his solo work: a new album, ''The True False Identity'' (Columbia), rooted in blues, reggae and wry political commentary.

This one, featuring the bassist Chris Lee (of the ''Late Show With David Letterman'' band) and the guitarist Jimmy Vivino (from ''Late Night With Conan O'Brien''), recreates even the most complex studio work of the later Beatles without breaking a sweat. At 8 p.m., Webster Hall, 125 East 11th Street, East Village, (212) 533-2111; $30. (Sisario) * HOWARD FISHMAN'S BASEMENT TAPES PROJECT (Tonight through Sunday night) Mr. Fishman has been rummaging through the attic of American song for years, finding witty insights in Dixieland, swing and bluegrass.

At 8 p.m., Cake Shop, 152 Ludlow Street, Lower East Side, (212) 253-0036; $7. (Sisario) HOWE GELB (Tomorrow) In Giant Sand and on his own, Howe Gelb creates hushed, still scenes with specks of countryish guitar and a 4 a.m. voice. The songs can be irritatingly shapeless, though, which is what makes Mr. Gelb's latest album, '' 'Sno Angel Like You'' (Thrill Jockey), such an unexpected pleasure: recorded with a Canadian gospel choir, the songs are tidy, concise and grand, yet lose none of Mr. Gelb's comforting informality. He appears with the full choir. At 8 p.m., Bowery Ballroom, 6 Delancey Street, near the Bowery, Lower East Side, (212) 533-2111; $16 in advance, $18 at the door.

(Sisario) GRAVEYARDS, HAIR POLICE, PRURIENT AND CARLOS GIFFONI, HEATHEN SHAME (Wednesday) The fearsomely loud and intense Michigan band Wolf Eyes -- who once described themselves as ''the Lynyrd Skynyrd of noise'' -- hovers over this bill, an all-star lineup of sorts in the small, small world of noise rock. Graveyards features John Olson of Wolf Eyes, and Hair Police features Mike Connelly, a longtime friend who is a recent addition. Prurient, a k a Dominik Fernow, collaborates with Carlos Giffoni, a musician and scenemaker in New York, and Heathen Shame has members of Twisted Village and Major Stars. At 8 p.m., Tonic, 107 Norfolk Street, near Delancey Street, Lower East Side, (212) 358-7501; $10. (Sisario) * NELLIE McKAY (Sunday) On nights off from ''The Threepenny Opera'' on Broadway, Ms. McKay, a songwriting sprite whom it is impossible to get tired of, is playing a series of late-night shows at Joe's Pub through June 18.

(Sisario) PEARL JAM (Thursday) Sounding limber and energized on its new, self-titled album -- oh why did it take Pearl Jam so long to find those thunderbolt AC/DC riffs? -- the alt-rock road warriors head out once again. With My Morning Jacket, a band from Louisville, Ky., with a calm and entrancing take on Southern rock. At 7:30 p.m., Continental Airlines Arena, East Rutherford, N.J., (212) 307-7171; sold out. (Sisario) GRUFF RHYS (Thursday) In Super Furry Animals, Gruff Rhys plays wonderfully overwrought pop, cramming together Beach Boys melodies, zooming space-rock, noisy punk and some penitent country. On his own, he scales back the sound but not his ambitions. At 8 p.m., Tonic, 107 Norfolk Street, near Delancey Street, Lower East Side, (212) 358-7501; $12. (Sisario) * RICKY SKAGGS AND KENTUCKY THUNDER (Thursday) Ricky Skaggs's fingers fly over just about anything with frets, especially the mandolin; he's no slouch on the fiddle, either, and he has the high tenor voice of a singer steeped in bluegrass. This concert, one of the first of the extensive River to River Festival, also features Andy Statman, Carrie Rodriguez and Citigrass. At 7 p.m., Castle Clinton National Monument, Battery Park, Lower Manhattan, (212) 835-2789. Free; tickets, two per person, are available at 5 p.m. (Jon Pareles) SOUL POSITION (Tonight and tomorrow night) The rapper Blueprint and the D.J. and producer RJD2, allied as Soul Position, put the braggadocio in alternative rap. They match swaggering funk tracks to sympathetic or smart-alecky rhymes about the unglamorous life: ''You got beef? I got vegetables.'' Tonight at 9, Bowery Ballroom, 6 Delancey Street, near the Bowery, Lower East Side, (212) 533-2111; $17. Tomorrow night at 8, Southpaw, 125 Fifth Avenue, near Sterling Place, Park Slope, Brooklyn, (718) 230-0236; $15. (Pareles) STAIND, THREE DAYS GRACE (Wednesday) With stock grunge riffs and lyrics like ''The truth is that I'm not so good at showing how I feel,'' Staind's music could be mistaken for the program of a very loud group-therapy session. Three Days Grace also confesses to the sound of power chords, but with even less introspection and creativity. At 7:30 p.m., Nokia Theater, 1515 Broadway, at 44th Street, (212) 307-7171; $36. (Sisario) STYX, FOREIGNER (Tonight) Sumer is icumen in, and pop nostalgia comes to Jones Beach. It begins with a trip back to the late 70's and early 80's, with the prog bombast of Styx (''Come Sail Away'') and the proletarian strut of Foreigner (''Juke Box Hero''). At 7:30, Nikon at Jones Beach Theater, Wantagh, N.Y., (516) 221-1000 or (212) 307-7171; $20 and $42.50. (Sisario) * SUNN O))), BORIS (Tuesday) The rumbling, distorted drone of an ultraloud guitar is a sacrament to be experienced with awe in the music of these two groups. The members of Sunn O))) -- whose name is a tribute to a brand of amplifiers -- dress in long robes as they perform low feedback epics in glacial time. Boris, from Japan, has a wider palette, and an appetite for sonic violence. At 7:30 p.m., Avalon, 662 Avenue of the Americas, at 20th Street, Chelsea, (212) 807-7780 or (212) 307-7171; $18 in advance, $20 at the door. (Sisario) TAJ MAHAL (Tonight through Sunday night) In Taj Mahal's hands, the blues is no weighty downer but a repository of breezy, evocative sounds easily connected to Caribbean and Hawaiian music.

(Sisario) TEAM DRESCH (Tuesday and Wednesday) A decade ago Team Dresch, a light in the riot grrrl scene, faded out just as Sleater-Kinney was fading in.

I. has crowned himself ''King of the South'' -- a coronation not received kindly by some other Southern rap princes -- and now, on top of his game with a hit album and a major movie appearance (in ''ATL'') under his belt, he makes his way to the Apollo Theater. At 7:30 and 11 p.m., 253 West 125th Street, Harlem, (212) 531-5305 or (212) 307-7171; $30 to $50.

With After Hours and Jeff Klein. At 8 p.m., Irving Plaza, 17 Irving Place, at 15th Street, Manhattan, (212) 777-6800; $20 in advance, $22 at the door. (Pareles) YELLOWMAN (Tuesday) More proof that Jamaican music is stranger than fiction. Yellowman is a great dance-hall reggae vocalist who also happens to be an albino. He has built his career on tongue-in-cheek sexual boasts, and although his popularity peaked about 20 years ago, he still puts on a good show, mixing wicked wit with sentimental old favorites. With Dub Trio. At 8 p.m., B. B. King Blues Club and Grill, 237 West 42nd Street, Manhattan, (212) 997-4144; $25 in advance, $27 at the door.

(Holden) ANDREA MARCOVICCI (Tonight and tomorrow, and Tuesday through Thursday) Ms. Marcovicci's new show, ''Just Love by Request'' is a kind of living room musicale that's one-half pre-set and one-half determined by audience suggestions.

(Midgette) KONSTANTIN LIFSCHITZ (Sunday) Shostakovich's 24 preludes and fugues for piano in all the major and minor keys were composed in homage to Bach's preludes and fugues. These ingenious and intrigu ing works would be part of the standard repertory and played all the time were they not so technically challenging. So give credit to the pianist Konstantin Lifschitz, who was reared in Moscow and trained at the Royal Academy of Music in London. He will play the complete set in a double-header on Sunday, presented by the essential and popular series Free for All at Town Hall. Mr. Lifschitz plays the first 12 at 2 p.m. and, after a needed break, tackles the rest at 7. Town Hall, 123 West 43rd Street, Manhattan, (212) 707-8787; free, but tickets are required, available at the box office at noon. (Anthony Tommasini) NEW YORK PHILHARMONIC (Tonight, tomorrow, Wednesday and Thursday) Tonight and tomorrow Lorin Maazel conducts Berlioz's ''Harold in Italy'' and Mahler's Symphony No. 1; the violist Cynthia Phelps is the soloist in the Berlioz. On Wednesday Mr. Maazel, Peter Schickele and the Philharmonic talk about and demonstrate what makes Berlioz's ''Symphonie Fantastique'' tick. On Thursday the Philharmonic and Mr. Maazel are in their adventurous mode, abetted by the French pianist Pierre-Laurent Aimard in music by Elliott Carter, Stravinsky and Berlioz. Tonight and tomorrow night at 8, Wednesday at 6:45 p.m., Thursday at 7:30 p.m., Avery Fisher Hall, Lincoln Center, (212) 721-6500; $26 to $94, except $23 to $58 on Wednesday. (Bernard Holland) * NEW YORK PHILHARMONIC MEMORIAL DAY CONCERT (Monday) The Philharmonic ventures into the acoustically cavernous Cathedral Church of St. John the Divine, as Xian Zhang conducts Verdi's overture to ''La Forza del Destino'' and the Tchaikovsky Fifth Symphony. At 8 pm, 1047 Amsterdam Avenue, at 112th Street, Morningside Heights, (212) 875-5709; free.

The season continues until July 15. Tonight and tomorrow night, and Monday through Thursday evenings at 8; tomorrow and Wednesday at 2 p.m.; Metropolitan Opera House, Lincoln Center, (212) 362-6000 or abt.org; $23 to $100. (John Rockwell) ARTHUR AVILES TYPICAL THEATER (Tonight) New dances by the irrepressible Mr. Aviles include the intriguingly named ''This Pleasant and Grateful Asylum.''

(Jennifer Dunning) CEDAR LAKE CONTEMPORARY BALLET (Thursday) This ''Dream Collaborations'' program attracted little attention when it was first performed in January. Its reprise offers another chance to see the work of two promising choreographers -- the Brooklyn-born Nicolo Fonte and the Canadian Emily Molnar -- as well as a piece by the company director, Benoit-Swan Pouffer. (Through June 4.) At 8 p.m., Cedar Lake Theater, 547 West 26th Street, Chelsea, (212) 868-4444 or Smartix.com; $30; $10 for students and 65+.

(Dunning) ELIOT FELD MANDANCE PROJECT (Wednesday and Thursday) The first week of Eliot Feld's annual season at the Joyce will feature three new works by the prolific Mr. Feld on the programs, and ''Ugha Bugha,'' recently danced for the first time by the New York City Ballet. Mikhail Baryshnikov was expected to perform ''Mr. XYZ,'' a solo created for him in 2004, but had to cancel because of an injury. The solo will be replaced by works from the repertory, including ''Kore,'' a solo set to music by Steve Reich. Despite the name of the company, the talented group of nine -- some from Mr. Feld's school -- includes two women. (Through June 11.) At 8 p.m., Joyce Theater, 175 Eighth Avenue, at 19th Street, Chelsea, (212) 242-0800; $42. (Sulcas) FREEFALL (Wednesday and Thursday) The company's new ''Clever Hans,'' a theater piece with choreography by Lynn Brown and Lynn Marie Ruse, tells the Grimm fairy tale from three points of view. (Through June 4.) At 8:30 p.m., HERE Arts Center, 145 Sixth Avenue, at Dominick Street, South Village, (212) 868-4444 or www.here.org; $20. (Dunning) CHERYLYN LAVAGNINO (Tonight through Sunday night) Contemporary uses of the tradition of dancing on point will be explored in a program to live music. At 8:30, Danspace Project, St. Mark's Church, 131 East 10th Street, East Village, (212) 674-8194 or www.danspaceproject.org; $15.(Jack Anderson) * TIFFANY MILLS COMPANY (Thursday) Ms. Mills' new ''Godard'' tackles the familiar theme of human relationships, but the piece is set, intriguingly, to music by John Zorn inspired by the quirks of the filmmaker Jean-Luc Godard, and has video by Ela Troyano. The program also includes the much sparer new ''LandFall (Part 1).'' (Through June 3.) At 8 p.m., the Duke on 42nd Street, 229 West 42nd Street, Manhattan, (212) 239-6200 or www.tiffanymillscompany.org; $30 (includes gala post-performance reception). (Dunning) * MOMIX (Tonight through Sunday) In this closing weekend, Momix will perform its surreal, sometimes psychedelic ''Lunar Sea.'' Tonight at 8, tomorrow at 2 and 8 p.m., Sunday at 2 and 7:30 p.m., Joyce Theater, 175 Eighth Avenue, at 19th Street, Chelsea, (212) 242-0800 or www.joyce.org; $42. (Dunning) MOVEMENT WORKS (Tonight) This showcase for dance and theater works-in-progress will feature work by six artists, including Sita Mani. At 8, Center for Remembering and Sharing, 123 Fourth Avenue, near 12th Street, East Village, (212) 352-3101; $15. (Dunning) * NEW YORK CITY BALLET (Tonight through Sunday, and Tuesday through Thursday) No new Diamond Project ballets this week, just repertory programs in which two of those premieres can be seen -- Peter Martins's tonight, Jean-Pierre Bonnefoux's tomorrow and Wednesday nights. There is also an amusing ''All Stravinsky'' program Sunday afternoon -- amusing because it seems to be going head to head with American Ballet Theater's ''All-Star Stravinsky'' run at the Metropolitan Opera House. The City Ballet season continues until June 25. Tonight, tomorrow night and Thursday night at 8, tomorrow at 2 p.m., Sunday at 3 p.m., Tuesday and Wednesday at 7:30 p.m., New York State Theater, Lincoln Center, (212) 870-5570 or nycballet.com; $30 to $86; student rush tickets at $15. (Rockwell) ELKE RINDFLEISCH (Tonight through Sunday night) Ms. Rindfleisch's new ''Damage,'' set to live music, begins with her six dancers struggling as if pushed and dragged by internal physical forces, and ends with dancers moving through a setting that includes a moveable staircase, a hallway to nowhere and a mysteriously illuminated corner. At 8:30, Wallabout Studio, 50 Taaffe Place, between Flushing and Park Avenues, Fort Greene, Brooklyn, (917) 251-4561; $15. (Dunning) PAZ TANJUAQUIO/TOPAZ ARTS (Thursday) A double bill from the Philippine-born Ms. Tanjuaquio and the composer Todd Richmond. It includes ''Thunder Against 1.2.3.,'' in which Ms. Tanjuaquio uses her mellifluous voice and clear movement style to evoke images of Southeast Asia and suggest larger political concerns. She also presents a preview of a new work, ''Soundless Music,'' inspired by a 1952 Yoko Ono text. Well, why not? (Through June 3.) At 8 p.m., Joyce SoHo, 155 Mercer Street, (212) 334-7479; Thursday benefit gala, $50. (June 2 and 3, $20; $15 for students and 65+.) (Sulcas) TAP DANCE DAY CELEBRATION (Sunday) This is the 17th gala performance celebrating National Tap Dance Day: Flo-Bert Life Achievement Awards will be handed out, and a number of well-known tappers -- including Mable Lee and Jimmy Clyde -- will perform to music by the Frank Owens Trio. These events tend to be long, but Ms. Lee's legs should make it all worthwhile. At 7 p.m., Fashion Institute of Technology Haft Auditorium, 227 West 27th Street, Chelsea, (718) 975-6867 or questions@nytap.org; $25 to $65. (Sulcas) BILL YOUNG/COLLEEN THOMAS & DANCERS (Thursday) Mr. Young and Ms. Thomas have collaborated for years as dancers and choreographers. This latest program will include their new ''A Place in France,'' whose set has transparent distorting panels, magnifying lenses, tanks of water and live close-up video. (Through June 2.) At 7:30 p.m., Tisch School of the Arts, 111 Second Avenue, at Seventh Street, East Village, (212) 998-1982; $15; $12 for students and 65+.(Dunning) ZVIDANCE (Tonight through Sunday) New works by Zvi Gotheiner include ''Les Noces,'' his version of Stravinsky's ballet about marriage, and ''12A,'' a commentary on superstitions about the number 13, to a commissioned score by Scott Killian. Tonight and tomorrow night at 7:30, Sunday at 2 p.m., Dance Theater Workshop, 219 West 19th Street, Chelsea, (212) 924-0077; $25; $15 for students and 65+. (Anderson) Art Museums and galleries are in Manhattan unless otherwise noted. Full reviews of recent art shows: nytimes.com/art. Museums * American Folk Art Museum: 'WHITE ON WHITE (AND A LITTLE GRAY),' through Sept. 17. The importance of neo-Classicism to early American architecture, silver and fine furniture is not exactly news. This small, beautiful show follows its spread into more personal corners of visual culture: often exquisite, strikingly dimensional white-work bedcovers; luminously grisaille, sometimes wacky marble-dust drawings; and print-work embroidery mourning pictures. Few exhibitions this size (35 pieces) present quite such a vivid and rewarding picture of artistic assimilation and transformation. 45 West 53rd Street, (212) 265-1040. (Roberta Smith) * BARD GRADUATE CENTER: 'AMERICAN STREAMLINED DESIGN: THE WORLD OF TOMORROW,' through June 11. Streamlining, a particularly American design concept born of our love of speed and admiration for industrial production, peaked in the 1930's and 40's, and is now said to be undergoing a revival. This tribute to it includes more than 180 objects, from boring but useful items like a receipt printer designed by Walter Dorwin Teague in 1946 to a plastic bicycle helmet of flowing teardrop shapes designed by John Larkin in 2000. The show is perhaps too packed with repetitive examples -- do we need to see three similar electric drills? -- but don't let that stop you. There's no shortage of wonderful things to look at here. 18 West 86th Street, (212) 501-3000. (Grace Glueck) * BROOKLYN MUSEUM: 'SYMPHONIC POEM: THE ART OF AMINAH BRENDA LYNN ROBINSON,' through Aug. 13. This prodigious show, by an artist born and still living in Columbus, Ohio, celebrates her heritage in paintings, drawings, sculpture, stitchery, leather work and less classifiable forms of expression. Besides its sheer visual wizardry, using materials like leaves, twigs, bark, buttons and cast-off clothes, her art is compelling in that it ruminates on the history of black migration to, and settlement in, the United States, from early times to the present, in a garrulous, very personal way. 200 Eastern Parkway, at Prospect Park, (718) 638-5000. (Glueck) COOPER-HEWITT NATIONAL DESIGN MUSEUM: 'FREDERIC CHURCH, WINSLOW HOMER AND THOMAS MORAN: TOURISM AND THE AMERICAN LANDSCAPE,' through Oct. 22. It turns out that the Cooper-Hewitt owns thousands of rarely seen paintings, prints and sketches by Church, Homer and Moran. Studies of the countryside, mostly, they revere unspoiled nature and record tourism, a booming industry in 19th-century America. Here they're combined with antique postcards, old Baedekers, stereoscopic photographs, playing cards with pictures of Yellowstone on them and souvenir platters, all to trace the nation's transformation from primeval wilderness to Catskills resort. The show is extremely entertaining. And Church's oil sketches alone are worth the price of admission: exquisite, plainspoken Emersonian love poems to New York and New England. 2 East 91st Street, at Fifth Avenue, (212) 849-8400. (Michael Kimmelman) * FRICK COLLECTION: 'VERONESE'S ALLEGORIES: VIRTUE, LOVE AND EXPLORATION IN RENAISSANCE VENICE,' through July 16. Paolo Veronese (1528-88), a superb colorist and one of the most suavely sensuous of Renaissance Venetian painters, used the age-old device of allegory to make abstract concepts visual, often by means of human or mythological figures. In this five-painting show, the first to include all of his large-scale allegories from American collections, high ideals mingle with earthy and sometimes erotic physicality, as in the painting ''Venus and Mars United by Love.'' 1 East 70th Street, (212) 288-0700. (Glueck) JEWISH MUSEUM: 'EVA HESSE: SCULPTURE,' through Sept. 17. Assembled by Elizabeth Sussman, curator at the Whitney Museum of American Art, and Fred Wasserman, a curator at the Jewish Museum, this show focuses on a pivotal Hesse exhibition, ''Chain Polymers,'' at the Fischbach Gallery -- known for promoting Minimalist painters -- in 1968. Arguably a compilation of her best work, it was her first and only solo show of sculpture during her lifetime, and most of the objects in it -- along with some earlier and later pieces -- are here. One of the earliest is ''Compart'' (1966), a four-panel vertical that starts at the top with a fully formed, round, breastlike image of neatly wound cord that mysteriously breaks up into part of the same image on each of the three panels beneath. The last, most startling and most impressive work is ''Untitled (Rope Piece),'' of 1970, made as Ms. Hesse was dying, finished with the help of friends. (An exhibition of her drawings is on view at the Drawing Center.) 1109 Fifth Avenue, at 92nd Street, (212) 423-3200. (Glueck) * METROPOLITAN MUSEUM OF ART: 'ANGLOMANIA: TRADITION AND TRANSGRESSION IN BRITISH FASHION,' through Sept. 4. Ranging from early-18th-century gowns to next season's evening wear, this show crowds 65 extravagantly clad mannequins into the Met's normally serene English period rooms, trying to connect the sartorial innovations of the English dandy, the aggressive tribal attire of punk and the deconstructive impulses of today's British fashion stars. A certain confusion, both intellectual and visual reigns, but there is more than enough to look at. (212) 535-7710. (Smith) MET: 'HATSHEPSUT,' through July 9. Can a queen be a king, too? Consider the case of Hatshepsut, an Egyptian ruler of the 15th century B.C. She assumed the supreme title of pharaoh and ruled Egypt in that powerfully masculine role until her death. Hatshepsut is the subject of a celebratory show at the Metropolitan Museum of Art, one that commemorates the 100th anniversary of the Met's department of Egyptian art. Organized by the Met and the Fine Arts Museums of San Francisco, it includes many objects from the Met's own extensive holdings, excavated at its digs in the 1920's and 30's. But it isn't so easy to follow Hatshepsut's trail in this ambitious show, what with the number of relatives, subordinates, minor officials and such who also have a place in it, along with scarabs, jewelry, pottery, furniture and other artifacts. (See above.) (Glueck) * Morgan Library and Museum: 'Masterworks from the Morgan,' through Sept. 10. Almost three years after closing to build an expansion, the Morgan is back and brilliant. What's new: Renzo Piano's splendid four-story glass-and-steel court, a sort of giant solarium with see-through elevators; two good-size second-floor galleries; and a neat little strongbox of an enclosure, called the Cube, for reliquaries and altar vessels, medieval objects made with so much silver and gold that they seem to give off heat. What's not new: almost everything in this exhibition, which fills every gallery with mini-exhibitions of master drawings and musical manuscripts, as well as illuminated gospels, devotional sculptures and historical and literary autograph manuscripts from the Brontes to Bob Dylan. 225 Madison Avenue, at East 36th Street, (212) 685-0008 or themorgan.org. ( Individual show closings can be checked by telephone or through the Web site.) (Holland Cotter) Museum of Modern Art : 'AGAINST THE GRAIN: CONTEMPORARY ART FROM THE EDWARD R. BROIDA COLLECTION,' through Sept. 18. The latest collection assembled by the Museum of Modern Art bolsters its holdings of art world mavericks like Philip Guston, Jennifer Bartlett, Ken Price and Vija Celmins and includes first-timers like Robert Grosvenor, John Lees and Susana Solano. It also illuminates parts of the untold, or forgotten, stories of the art of the 1970's and 80's: the achievements of painters and sculptors who were not at the forefront of Post-Minimalism, photo appropriation or Neo-Expressionism. Some of their efforts may disappear into storage, but quite a few will shake up the Modern's conception of the complicated course of art since 1970. The Museum of Modern Art, (212) 708-9400. (Smith) New York Public Library: 'FRENCH BOOK ART/LIVRES D'ARTISTES: ARTISTS AND POETS IN DIALOGUE,' through Aug. 18. Organized with the Bibliothèque Littéraire Jacques Doucet in Paris, this lavish exhibition surveys some of the experimental ferment brought on by the combination of free verse, visionary publishers and the high rate of talent among French artists and poets, especially in the early years of the 20th century. Concentrating on books, but also including prints and drawings, it retells the tale of the French avant-garde on a relatively egalitarian playing field. New York Public Library, Fifth Avenue at 42nd Street, (212) 869-8089. (Smith) NOGUCHI MUSEUM: 'BEST OF FRIENDS: BUCKMINSTER FULLER AND ISAMU NOGUCHI,' through Oct. 15. Great, lasting friendships are rare, but friendships that enlarge the spirit through ideas, ideals and new insights are in a class by themselves. Over a stretch of more than 50 years, the sculptor Isamu Noguchi and the visionary designer R. Buckminster Fuller enjoyed such a friendship, which led to aesthetic and practical achievements that left their mark. The course of their varied collaborations is traced in this exhibition, which includes models, sculptures, drawings, photographs and films. 9-01 33rd Road, between Vernon Boulevard and 10th Street, Long Island City, Queens, (718) 204-7088. (Glueck) * The Studio Museum In harlem: 'Energy/Experimentation: Black Artists and Abstraction, 1964-1980,' through July 2. During one of the most radical periods in 20th-century American politics, the Black Power era, a group of African-American artists was working in one of the most radical forms of 20th-century art: abstraction. This show is stylishly installed; the 15 artists are intensely individualistic and part of an important history. One, the sculptor Tom Lloyd (1921-96), opened the Studio Museum with a solo show in 1968. 144 West 125th Street, (212) 864-4500. (Cotter) Galleries: Uptown * Willem de Kooning, 'Paintings 1975-1978' Working with wide brushes, putty knives and other unidentifiable tools and methods, de Kooning improvised with abandon and to beautiful effect in these 13 paintings from the 70's. L & M Arts, 45 East 78th Street, (212) 861-0020, through June 3. (Ken Johnson) Galleries: SoHo 'EVA HESSE: DRAWING' This show deals in depth with Ms. Hesse's works on paper, ranging from rough sketches or notes, to test pieces made from various materials that function as drawings, to finished projects that stand on their own. A zealous researcher, Ms. Hesse made all kinds of thumbnail notations and calculations to explore the properties of her malleable materials. Many of these sheets, perhaps too many, are shown, too. Drawing Center, 35 Wooster Street, (212) 219-2166, through July 15. (Glueck) Galleries: Chelsea MICHAEL BELL-SMITH This young American artist brings digital animation and painting into an unusually effective, visually ravishing alliance by a sparing use of motion, radiant colors and the suppression of narrative. Foxy Production, 617 West 27th Street, (212) 239-2758, through June 3. (Smith) Julia Condon: 'Mandalas' Inspired by Tibetan tradition, Ms. Condon uses many thin glazes on square canvases to create entrancing, soft-focus mandalas in which diaphanous crystalline and floral patterns radiate from glowing centers. Dinter Fine Art, 547 West 27th Street, (212) 947-2818, through June 3. (Johnson) Justin Craun: 'The Individual' Inspired partly by kitschy Christian record album cover images from the 1950's, this inventive young painter creates acidic, vividly abstracted and patterned portraits of people who look as if they've been possessed by evil aliens from outer space. Fredericks & Freiser, 536 West 24th Street, (212) 633-6555, through June 10. (Johnson) Willem de Kooning: 'Sketchbook' Twelve pages bearing spidery pencil drawings from a rare, intact sketchbook from the mid-1970's by this great Abstract Expressionist. Matthew Marks Gallery, 523 West 24th Street, (212) 243-0200, through June 17. (Johnson) * Joe FiG With extraordinary skill and ingenuity, this young sculptor replicates in miniature the studios of well-known artists. The centerpiece of his exhibition recreates the adjoining Long Island studios of the painters and spouses Eric Fischl and April Gornik. Plus Ultra Gallery, 637 West 27th Street, (212) 643-3152, through June 3. (Johnson) Ilya & Emilia Kabakov The painter, sculptor, storyteller and Conceptualist Mr. Kabakov and his partner, Emilia Kabakov, present a series of paintings they made recently, but that museum-style labels claim were made in the 1970's by Ilya Kabakov, who may or may not be the same person as the author of this exhibition. The paintings adroitly mix passages of Modernist abstraction and social realism, but the real interest is in the idea of the art history of an alternative universe. Sean Kelly, 528 West 29th Street, (212) 239-1181, through June 3. (Johnson) 'Never Mind the Bollocks: Here's Amanda Lear' Muse, film actress, professional Somebody, Amanda Lear is also a painter, as her oil portraits of Francis Bacon, Salvador Dalí and Leonardo da Vinci attest. But the point of the show is to pay homage to Ms. Lear herself, and some interesting artists: Scott Hug, Kanishka Raja, Ryan Steadman and James. J. Williams III, with paintings; Michelle Lopez and Anna Sew Hoy, with small sculptures; and -- best -- Christoph Broich with a large work of latex and lace titled ''The Girl Who Sold Her Soul to the Devil and Won.'' Envoy, 535 West 22nd Street, sixth floor, (212) 242-7524, through June 3. (Cotter) * Rosalind Solomon, 'American Pictures from Chapalingas' This excellent exhibition of works from 1974 to 2000 surveys the career of a photographer with a keen eye for human individuality and a pitch-perfect sense of composition. Her art bears a family resemblance to that of Diane Arbus, but it is gentler and kinder. Foley, 547 West 27th Street, (212) 244-9081, through June 3. (Johnson) Christoph Worringer In his large-scale allegories, this young German painter features multiple images of himself with pupil-less eyes in mysterious theatrical situations. Whatever they may mean, it is tantalizing to imagine where Mr. Worringer's blend of traditionalist figurative painting and Postmodernist surrealism might lead. Lucas Schoormans, 508 West 26th Street, (212) 243-3159, through June 10. (Johnson) Other Galleries Glen Fogel and Yoko Inoue Yoko Inoue, born in Japan, looks at what it is to be American in a solo show that includes a stack of woolen ''Old Glory'' sweaters made by weavers in South America, and a series of portraits of Ms. Inoue made by other artists. A new video by Glen Fogel, shot during the Billy Graham Crusade at Flushing Meadows, Queens, in 2005, focuses on the Christian rock bands that served as warm-up acts for Mr. Graham. The musicians look as if they could be from the 1960's, though the message they are delivering is very different. Or is it? Momenta, 72 Berry Street, near North Ninth Street, Williamsburg, Brooklyn, (718) 218-8058, through June 12. (Cotter) 'Mystic River' The artist Noah Sheldon has assembled a lyrical group show not quite of this world. Dike Blair makes an unearthly thing of Las Vegas in a fine watercolor painting; the excellent Peter Coffin contributes a portrait in the form of a photographed aura; Martha Friedman offers a levitating rope; Ian Hundley displays a patch of aerial topography in the form of a crazy quilt; Roger White paints the sun. The spirit of Stephen Shore's 1970's photographs of the American landscape flows through it all. Southfirst, 60 North Sixth Street, Williamsburg, Brooklyn, (718) 599-4884, through June 11. (Cotter) Last Chance 'BREATHE DEEP NYC NO CHARGE' Richard P. Rubenstein's short 1972 video of Gordon Matta-Clark's ''Clean Air Machine'' in action documents both an early instance of ecological Conceptualism and relationship aesthetics and a New York that seems very far away. Sara Tecchia Roma New York, 529 West 20th Street, Chelsea, (212) 741-2900; closes tomorrow. (Smith) KADAR BROCK: PAINTING CAN YOU TAKE ME TO HEAVEN That question isn't answered by the canvases in this solo debut, but their visual rambunctiousness and slammed-together abstract styles and robust paint handling have definite promise. Buia Gallery, 541 West 23rd Street, Chelsea, (212) 366-9915; closes tomorrow. (Smith) * Brooklyn Museum: WILLIAM WEGMAN: 'FUNNEY/STRANGE' Descended from Marcel Duchamp and Buster Keaton, Mr. Wegman has straddled high and low for more than three decades, using his signature Weimaraners to make the art world's funniest videos, as well as television commercials, calendars and children's books. His popular success has tended to obscure his originality and influence, along with a multifarious production that includes wittily captioned drawings, wonderfully irreverent paintings and a host of nondog photographic work. 200 Eastern Parkway, Brooklyn, (718) 638-5000; closes on Sunday. (Smith) NATHALIE DJURBERG This young Swedish artist's short, exquisitely colored, intensely barbed Claymation animations usually feature young women and girls engaged in various kind of vileness, conjuring up a darkness so over the top that it turns light. Almost. Zach Feuer, 530 West 24th Street, Chelsea, (212) 989-7700; closes tomorrow. (Smith) CEAL FLOYER Using little more than a snippet of song, a blue balloon and fizz, the works in this exhibition offer proof that beauty is in the details hovering at the edges of perception. 303 Gallery, 525 West 22nd Street, Chelsea, (212) 255-1121; closes tomorrow. (Smith) Judy Glantzman Her congested expressionistic paintings composed of scores of little human heads are like visions of hell by the Belgian Symbolist James Ensor. Also on view are scary and funny little doll-like figures made of a material called Super Sculpy. Betty Cuningham, 541 West 25th Street, Chelsea, (212) 242-2772; closes today. (Johnson) * International Center of Photography: 'Snap Judgments: New Positions in Contemporary African Photography' If Martians tuned into our television news broadcasts, they'd have a miserable impression of life on Earth. War, disease, poverty, heartbreak and nothing else. That's exactly how most of the world sees Africa: filtered through images of calamity. The Nigerian-born curator Okwui Enwezor offers a bracing alternative view in this show of recent photography from Africa. 1133 Avenue of the Americas, at 43rd Street, (212) 857-0000; closes on Sunday.(Cotter) * Josephsohn A powerful exhibition of five crusty, semi-abstract, oversized heads cast in bronze by a Zurich-based sculptor who was born in East Prussia in 1920. Peter BLUM, 99 Wooster Street, SoHo, (212) 343-0441; closes tomorrow. (Johnson) NATIONAL MUSEUM OF THE AMERICAN INDIAN: 'FIRST AMERICAN ART' That American Indian art can provide the same aesthetic and emotional pleasure as European and American Modernism is the premise of this show, made up of 200 objects from the Charles and Valerie Diker Collection, and it affirms American Indian art's worthy aesthetic place in world culture. 1 Bowling Green, Lower Manhattan, (212) 514-3700; closes on Monday. (Glueck) Josephine Pryde: 'Maids & Magnetism' Obliquely conceptual, blurry, over-exposed and doubly exposed photographs that allude to spirit photography, Modernist experimentalism and consumerism. Reena Spaulings Fine Art, 371 Grand Street, Lower East Side, (212) 477-5006; closes on Sunday. (Johnson) Whitney Museum of American Art: 'WHITNEY BIENNIAL 2006: DAY FOR NIGHT' This biennial will provoke much head-scratching by uninitiated visitors. A hermetic take on what has been making waves, it's packaged -- branded might be the better word -- as a show long on collaboration and open-endedness: several shows under one roof, including a revival of the 1960's ''Peace Tower,'' which rises like a Tinker Toy construction from the Whitney courtyard, with contributions by dozens of artists. As a counter to the image of the art world as rich, youth-besotted and obsessed with crafty little nothings, the ethos here is provisional, messy, half-baked, cantankerous, insular -- radical qualities art used to have when it could still call itself radical and wasn't like a barnacle clinging to the cruise ship of pop culture. That was back in the 1970's. And much of what's here harks back to that moment. (800) 944-8639 or www.whitney.org; closes on Sunday. (Kimmelman)"

2006-05-26T00:00:00Z,"The secretary of the Smithsonian Institution, Lawrence M. Small, was on the defensive yesterday during a House Administration Committee hearing into an agreement the Smithsonian made with Showtime Networks to set up an on-demand cable station whose programming would feature Smithsonian programs and collections. As part of the deal, the new network is to get the right of first refusal on commercial documentaries that relied significantly on the museum's archives, curators or scientists. The committee has struggled against a confidentiality clause to gain access to a complete version of the contract. Mr. Small also faced questions about the contract's 30-year length and the concern that independent filmmakers would now face restricted access to the Smithsonian's resources. Of the 350 contracts the Smithsonian has entered into over the last five years, Mr. Small said, fewer than 5 percent would have been affected by the new contract. But he apologized for ''the tremendous hullabaloo that has been created for members of Congress.'' ASHLEY PARKER"

Martha Rosler brings Abu Ghraib into the suburban living room; Deborah Bright shoots Plymouth Rock behind bars. Holly Hughes, Joanne Leonard and Susan Meiselas consider, in very different ways, the binds entailed in sexual role-playing. Clarissa Sligh and Pat Ward Williams turn stories of African-American women into narratives of entrapment."
2006-05-26T00:00:00Z,"On certain spring and summer nights, it feels like quite a sacrifice to leave the purpling evening sky and birdsong behind for a cramped theater seat. Luckily, the River to River Festival offers an alternative; with its Sitelines series, you can have your sky and see dance too. This summer the program's curator and producer, Nolini Barretto, chose to pair established downtown choreographers with emerging ones, letting the chips fall where they might. ''Essentially, it was a foist,'' Ms. Barretto said with a laugh, adding that she hoped to create informal mentorships through the pairings. The first fruits of this experiment can be seen tonight at the South Street Seaport, when the wickedly clever Keely Garfield and Zach Morris present ''Hope & Anchor'' (with Donna Ahmadi, above), riffing on various aspects of New York's nautical history. As opposed to their partners, the artists could choose their locations; the idea, Ms. Barretto said, was to find unusual places within high-traffic areas. Later in the festival Douglas Dunn and Elke Rindfleisch will inhabit the elevated acre at 55 Water Street in ''Multiple Undo & Other Distortions,'' and H. T. Chen and Sharon Estacio will create an ''Oasis'' in frenetic Columbus Park in Chinatown. Performances will also unfold at Laundromats, lobbies, exterior balconies and street corners. So keep your eyes open, and your fingers crossed for good weather. (''Hope & Anchor'' can be seen tonight and tomorrow night, as well as May 31 and June 1 through 3, at 7. For a complete list of programs, visit www.rivertorivernyc.com. Performances are free; no rain dates.) CLAUDIA LA ROCCO"

2006-05-26T00:00:00Z,"Since his emergence early in the 1990's, Kurt Rosenwinkel has evolved into one of the leading guitarists in modern jazz and one of the most clearly gifted musicians of his generation. Mr. Rosenwinkel, above, made his first big impression as part of the bright new generation at Smalls, though by that time he had already received the imprimatur of the esteemed vibraphonist Gary Burton. What he developed at Smalls was a personal identity on the guitar: a warm, luminous sound to humanize his formidable technique. Mr. Rosenwinkel gradually began to apply that sound to bands led by his elders (notably the drummer Paul Motian) as well as by his contemporaries (the tenor saxophonist Mark Turner), but it was within his own ensembles that it fully flourished. Last year Verve released his fourth album, ''Deep Song,'' featuring a group of accomplished peers like the saxophonist Joshua Redman and the pianist Brad Mehldau, and the results were both striking and subtle. (Or to be more precise: striking in its subtlety, which may be why the album received less attention than it deserved.) Since then, Mr. Rosenwinkel has focused on a separate working band, superior in some regards because of his deeply intuitive rapport with Mr. Turner, the saxophonist. This ensemble, which also features the pianist Aaron Goldberg, the bassist Joe Martin and the drummer Eric Harland, imbues its performances with a blend of shadowy introspection and combustible interplay. In other words, it's a perfect home for Mr. Rosenwinkel, and an experience best savored live.

Still, the juxtaposition of Jean-Michel Basquiat's early work with Jean Dubuffet's late paintings exudes a high-wattage electricity all its own. Both artists were aggressively chewing up culture and spitting out a new aggregate, playing with the so-called primitive and refusing to distinguish between drawing and painting. For Basquiat that culture was already mongrel, drawn from Europe, Africa and the Americas, in addition to poetry, music and sports."

2006-05-26T00:00:00Z,"It always seems virtuosic when an actor portrays a handful of characters in one scene, but it's easier than it looks. Still, among the other triumphs of the ingratiating new solo show ''No Child'' is that Nilaja Sun, above, evokes an entire public school classroom without resorting to schtick. Ms. Sun, the child of African-American and Puerto Rican parents, is a master at subtle shorthand, communicating a wealth of information in a precise movement or vocal inflection. She uses her small, limber body like a champion bodybuilder manipulating his muscles: isolating a small area, drawing attention to it before shifting to the next one. It's a marvelous performance, so detailed that it avoids the potential clichés of the subject matter at hand. Based on Ms. Sun's own experiences, the plot is about a naïve teacher who enters one of the worst public schools in the city (it's never just pretty bad, is it?) and directs a group of hopeless teenagers in a production of ''Our Country's Good.'' While most reviews have harped on how the show portrays a school system in crisis, the play is just as much about another flagging institution, the theater. ''Thespian,'' she explains to her students, ''means actor, citizen, lover of all things great.'' It's a favorite subject of Ms. Sun's and one that she has sent up and celebrated in several past solos. ''No Child'' may sound like earnest political theater, but it's just as much about the heartaches of being an actor in this city. As she presents herself so candidly, the life can be embarrassing, absurd, rewarding. At the end of the show she imagines the payoff, a future with a Tony, an Oscar and Denzel Washington as a husband. ''His first wife,'' she says with a hint of a smile, ''never had a chance.''

2006-05-26T00:00:00Z,"Beanie Sigel Shot The rapper Beanie Sigel, right, was shot early yesterday morning during an attempted robbery in Philadelphia, The Associated Press reported. Mr. Sigel, whose real name is Dwight Grant, was wounded in the upper right arm shortly after 8 a.m., the police said, but was able to drive himself to a hospital, where he was reported to be in good condition. The police said that five men traveling in two cars had attempted the robbery. The shooting was the latest chapter in a turbulent life. In January, Mr. Sigel, whose three albums have each reached the Top 5 on the Billboard album chart, was convicted of misdemeanor simple assault and sentenced to two years' probation as a result of an argument with a man outside a restaurant in 2003. Last August he left a federal prison after serving a year on a weapons charge. In September he was acquitted of attempted murder, and in November he was jailed briefly until he paid $27,000 in child support and $2,000 in fines.

Since early this month the site, DreamMusician.com, has been selling song downloads for about $2 each and compilations of the same song with different instrumental parts removed, starting at about $18. The aspiring musician then inserts his performance. The site says it expects to offer more than 1,000 songs by the end of the year.

As the most deliberately repetitive band in rock history -- its first record contained a song-manifesto called ''Repetition'' -- this is its virtue, its legacy. Since 1978 this British group, led by the invariably bored-looking and -sounding Mark E. Smith, above, has issued a steady, mostly predictable stream of songs characterized by jagged, jabby guitar; choppy rhythms; and Mr. Smith's cynical, tuneless slur, in lines that can be droll (''The dead cannot contradict'') or simply stupid (''Pay your rates/Pay your water rates''). Nothing else has ever sounded quite like the Fall, even the many postpunk groups it influenced, from Sonic Youth and Pavement to Franz Ferdinand and Clinic. But there has always been something tantalizingly unpredictable about Mr. Smith, particularly on tour. Churlish as ever well into his 40's, he has on recent tours gotten into fights with band mates and been arrested. A few weeks ago, just days into the band's current American tour, three members left and were quickly replaced, as so many Fall players over the years have. ''They are always different,'' the British D.J. and Fall admirer John Peel once said of the band, ''they are always the same.''

Upstairs is a quieter refuge with leather booths, tasseled lampshades and tablecloths. And uniting the two levels is the menu and cooking of Sascha Lyon, whose American and Continental standard-bearers seem to channel the spirit of a Midwestern hotel. It's an odd and uneventful restaurant but an often enjoyable one, with a rack of lamb (upstairs) and double burger (downstairs) that prompt no complaints. 55 Gansevoort Street, at Ninth Avenue, meatpacking district; (212) 989-1920. Lunch and dinner entrees, $15 to $42. * [Rating: One Star] Crema Taking Mexican cooking in the kind of nuanced directions that too few restaurants in New York do, Julieta Ballesteros, formerly of Mexicana Mama, lays chicken on a purée of squash blossoms, puts portobello mushroom atop it and crowns it all with goat cheese. Imaginative flourishes or intricate architecture define many of her dishes, but the kitchen's execution does not always live up to the recipes. The cheerful, orange-tinged setting and fine margaritas are definite compensation, and Ms. Ballesteros is a chef to watch. 111 West 17th Street, Manhattan ; (212) 691-4477.

She was independent, strong willed, generous, a fighter for causes she believed in, and the first woman to achieve many of the positions she held. Born in the Bronx in 1913, she graduated from Hunter College in 1933. Grateful for her free education at the college, she created the first endowed chair at that institution, and was an active member and contributor to its Scholarship and Welfare fund. She worked at the Department of Welfare where she organized the first sitdown strike and later became the first female local president at DC37. She worked for Russian War Relief and the American Labor Party and developed the Furriers' union dental clinic. Later she went into private industry and was the first female president of a vitamin production company, Synergy Plus. When she retired at age 76, she became a senior activist, first as president of the Hudson Guild Senior Center, then as the founding director of the Institute for Senior Action, a program which trains seniors to advocate for their needs. She is survived by her brother Donald of Pittsburgh and her son, Robert Jacobson and his partner Marilyn Gelber, of Brooklyn. A funeral will be at the Riverside Chapel at Amsterdam Av. & 76th St. on Sunday at 11:30AM. In her honor, contributions can be made to the Dorothy Epstein Legacy Fund, JPAC for Older Adults, 132 W. 31 St. NYC 10001. $(6$)EPSTEIN--Dorothy.We mourn the loss of a tremendous community leader.

2006-05-28T00:00:00Z,"CHILDREN who love the magic of a carousel ride may begin to feel a tingle when they hear that a carousel has been proposed for a waterfront park in the Town of Oyster Bay. But their parents will quite likely be jolted out of their nostalgia, because this symbol of youthful fun is generating heated debate. ''Hand-carved horses, old-style seats shaped like Teddy bears -- the best of the folk art traditions is what we have in mind for the Theodore Roosevelt carousel,'' said Joan Mahon, the executive director of the Oyster Bay Main Street Association, which proposed the project. ''Our plan is to link the downtown shopping district of Oyster Bay hamlet to the waterfront area with this fun, friendly, family-oriented amusement ride.''"

But when my design firm worked with many other disciplines and trades to make it into a museum, we were all impressed with the efforts of Josephine Harron and Richard Helfant of the Save Lucy Committee. They had little local support and less money, yet they revived this rare artifact for the benefit of the city, state and nation."

(Isn't it?) The chief executive of Raytheon was sorry that a company-produced booklet he wrote plagiarized a book published in 1944, a Missouri high school teacher was sorry for asking students to write about whom they would kill and how they would go about doing it and Hideki Matsui of the Yankees was sorry for breaking his wrist while diving for a ball."
2006-05-28T00:00:00Z,"To the Editor: Some questions about immigrants' taking jobs from citizens struck me when I read ''The 'Locusts' Have Their Day'' (editorial, May 14). Like the village of Mamaroneck described in the editorial, many communities have areas where day laborers congregate to be selected for odd jobs. I wonder how many of those job seekers are United States citizens. Are immigrants, legal or otherwise, hired at a greater rate? And if so, why? Do they tolerate lower pay or poorer working conditions? Do they just work harder? Are immigrants really taking jobs away from us citizens? Terry Takahashi Eugene, Ore."

2006-05-28T00:00:00Z,"To the Editor: I can scarcely believe that the island of Oahu described by Mr. Downes is the same place where I have been a half-year resident for the last 10 years. He seems to have missed the wild, unspoiled beauty of the North Shore, whose awe-inspiring 30-foot waves draw spectators and surfers from all over the world; the serenity that exudes from the many Buddhist temples that dot the island; the fun and exoticism of Chinatown; the world-class food (I'd rather eat in Honolulu than in Paris); the sensuousness of the color; and texture of island clothing.

2006-05-28T00:00:00Z,"An evil genius is the tick, which spreads disease by hiding in the fur of adorable woodland creatures. We freely slaughter the disease-bearing mosquito, but cannot as easily assault the tick because of our love for the white-tailed deer, its dainty, doe-eyed hostage. Instead of culling overabundant herds of suburban deer, we argue over how to subdue them with compassion, by fencing ourselves in, adjusting our gardening techniques or promoting deer family planning. The sturdy tick laughs, and multiplies. This looks to be another bad tick summer in the Northeast. Reports of Lyme disease were up 34 percent last year in Connecticut. Checking for ticks and taking antibiotics are a way of life on the East End of Long Island, particularly on Shelter Island, which has the highest incidence of Lyme disease and other tick-borne ailments in Suffolk County. The term ''Shelter Island foreplay'' describes nothing naughty but rather the fastidious monkey business of checking one another for ticks before bedtime."
2006-05-28T00:00:00Z,"For more than two years, a high-powered group of New Yorkers has been trying to figure out ways to bring the state's huge shadow government into the daylight and thus give the public a handle on hundreds of loosely regulated public-private authorities responsible for almost $30 billion in state revenue and $114 billion in outstanding debt. Last week, the group -- known as the New York State Commission on Public Authority Reform -- proposed several useful but modest reforms that will need to be strengthened to ensure that the authorities operate more openly and responsibly. The authorities were originally set up to be more like private corporations, avoiding bureaucratic snarls and moving nimbly to build and maintain public works projects like canals and subways. But over the years they have grown in number from a few big construction agencies to several hundred authorities free of government meddling and the market constraints that keep most public corporations in check."
2006-05-28T00:00:00Z,"''THE DA VINCI CODE'' opened in movie theaters on the day I saw Glen Berger's ''Underneath the Lintel'' at the Long Wharf Theater. So it was fairly easy to get into the mood for an ancient religious mystery and a related quest involving extreme secrecy, intricate detective work and global travel. This one, which reaches back to ancient Judea and the day of Jesus' crucifixion, turned out to be disarmingly entertaining."

2006-05-28T00:00:00Z,"THE mention of Rees Jones in Barbara Bush's autobiography tells one part of the story. It is a brief note in ''Barbara Bush: A Memoir,'' about her and former President George H. W. Bush's 50th anniversary weekend in Sea Island, Ga., where they had spent their honeymoon. Mr. Jones got to play in a fivesome that included Bill Jones, the chief executive of Sea Island, the professional golfer Davis Love III, former Attorney General Griffin B. Bell and Mr. Bush. ''One time Mr. Bush hit a ball in some swampy area and started to search for it,'' said the 64-year-old Mr. Jones, who was invited along because he had designed the course. ''I told him he didn't have to do that, that we would give him a good lie.''"
2006-05-28T00:00:00Z,To the Sports Editor: Jane Schwartz writes that the real miracle ''is that so many of us are still capable of caring so much.''

(Even a line of bags made from recycled candy wrappers runs into the $200 range). In canvas and terry, repurposed paper and sailcloth, here are some of the season's most shoreworthy totes. 1. Chanel's surf-print canvas tote comes in buoyant blue and red and has an outside zip pocket. The straps are made of nylon webbing ($1,250 at Chanel stores 800-550-0005). 2. L. L. Bean's Vacationland Multistripe Boat & Tote, with a zip top and a hidden key clip, provides lots of retro bang for the buck at $29 (at www.llbean.com). 3. A classic Bahia beach basket by Rafé has braided leather straps and green or coral floral handkerchief trim ($350 at Rafé New York, 877-772-3369). 4. Pucci's floral terrycloth hobo has canvas straps and white leather trim ($690 at Bergdorf Goodman). 5. An Ecoist tote bag made of braided recycled candy wrappers has a detachable orange nylon zip pouch and leather straps ($238 at www.orangelola.com). 6. Desmo's arts-and-crafts white cotton bucket bag is finished with dark leather trim and a drawstring ($598 at Searle stores). 7. The tweedy linen Sac Marine by Hermès cuts a long silhouette with a flat-front zipper pocket and a drawstring top ($2,100 at Hermès stores). 8. Nanette Lepore's 40's-inspired banana-leaf print bag has ribbon-wrapped handles and a flap front adorned with a bow ($310 at Nanette Lepore in New York, 212-219-8265). 9.

2006-05-28T00:00:00Z,"MILFORD, MICH. The News -- The F.B.I. began tearing down a horse barn at a farm outside Detroit, continuing the search for signs of the former Teamsters union president James R. Hoffa. Behind the News -- A week of digging has produced no evidence of the remains of Mr. Hoffa, who disappeared in 1975. But the F.B.I. has called the tip that led agents to the site the most credible lead in years. An informant, in prison on drug charges, claims he saw the labor leader buried at the spot where the barn stands now. At the time of the disappearance the farm was owned by a Hoffa associate, Rolland McMaster, now 92. WASHINGTON The News -- Attorney General Alberto R. Gonzales said journalists who publish classified information might be open to prosecution. Behind the News -- In a television interview, Mr. Gonzales said the government had ''an obligation'' to protect national security, and appeared to refer to espionage laws. Scholars say those laws were never meant to apply to journalists, yet Mr. Gonzales's comments raised the possibility, at least, that they might be applied in recent cases, including publication by The New York Times of information about a National Security Agency surveillance program. CONGRESS The News -- The F.B.I. searched the offices of a congressman as part of a bribery investigation, touching off a dispute between Congress and the Justice Department. Behind the News -- The department refused to relinquish records seized from the office of Representative William J. Jefferson, Democrat of Louisiana. Congressional leaders had demanded their return, saying the search violated constitutional doctrines, including the separation of powers, and historical practice. By midweek, President Bush intervened, ordering the records sealed for 45 days to give both sides time to work out an agreement. WASHINGTON The News -- The Department of Veterans Affairs was investigating the theft of electronic records of 26.5 million veterans, including information like Social Security numbers and dates of birth. Behind the News -- The records were stolen from the home of an employee who routinely took sensitive data out of the office to work on. Secretary Jim Nicholson said procedures for reporting the theft were not followed -- he said he did not hear about it for two weeks. He was expected to ask Congress for money to pay for the incident. Just sending letters to the affected veterans was estimated to cost more than $10 million. NEW ORLEANS The News -- With the hurricane season about to begin, the Army Corps of Engineers put the finishing touches on the rebuilt levee system of New Orleans. Behind the News -- The rebuilding project, which cost $800 million and involved more than 150 miles of levees, was lauded as a major engineering feat. Experts noted the system was better in many ways. But critics wondered if it was improved enough, given how inadequate the system was to begin with.

2006-05-28T00:00:00Z,"TO Harvey Weisman, a Woodmere developer, the former Mill Neck Marina in Locust Valley seems like a fine setting for four $800,000 to $1 million houses that he wants permission from the Town of Oyster Bay to build. A local county legislator, some neighbors and an environmental group, Friends of the Bay, all disagree. They say that the property, which is on the shore of a national wildlife preserve, is fit only for cleanup and preservation."
2006-05-28T00:00:00Z,To the Editor: The article mentions that public health advocates are likely to oppose BabyFirst. The article does not elaborate however. Television viewing in small children is far from innocuous. Numerous studies have linked television watching among infants and toddlers to increases in attention problems and obesity. The Times should address these issues rather than tout this ridiculous channel. Fiona Havers Seattle

2006-05-28T00:00:00Z,"For many of us in New Jersey, life comes down to two basic needs: home and the Shore. And as we gear up for another blissful season of traffic jams, sunburns and sand fleas, it's a good time to read Emil R. Salvini's recent book, ''Boardwalk Memories: Tales of the Jersey Shore'' (Globe Pequot, $24.95). Mr. Salvini is a historian with solid credentials. He is a member of the Cape May Historic Preservation Commission, a past president of the North Jersey Highlands Historical Society and a life member of the Cape May County Historical Society. His lifelong love of boardwalks began with visits to his grandparents' home in Bradley Beach and walking the boards in Asbury Park. That was where he learned to play Skee-Ball and where, years later, he taught the game to his daughters."

2006-05-28T00:00:00Z,"IT was a bit eerie last Sunday on many Connecticut soccer fields. It was cold and raining, and the parents huddled under umbrellas were unusually quiet. They were quiet even when their team scored a goal. It was Silent Sidelines Weekend across the state and parents were supposed to refrain from their usual oratory, trading shouts and whoops for polite applause and maybe just a word or two of encouragement instead."
2006-05-28T00:00:00Z,"A review on May 14 about ''Sons of Providence: The Brown Brothers, the Slave Trade, and the American Revolution,'' by Charles Rappleye, misstated the year that a band of Rhode Islanders destroyed the Gaspee, a British revenue ship. It was 1772, not 1773."
2006-05-28T00:00:00Z,"Of all the third-rail issues in New Jersey -- and there are almost as many of those as New Jersey Transit cars in disrepair -- the big one is home rule. Whatever that is.

With sea levels rising and stronger, more frequent storms all but certain, how can communities pass up this offer?

2006-05-28T00:00:00Z,"ANYONE who thinks that a signature on a painting confers authenticity may want to consider the curious case of ''Keene Valley,'' a late-1860's oil painting now in an exhibition of works from the permanent collection at the Heckscher Museum of Art here. These days, the painting is attributed to Asher B. Durand, a highly valued Hudson River School painter -- one of his works, ''Kindred Spirits'' (1849), was sold by the New York Public Library a year ago to the Wal-Mart heiress Alice L. Walton for more than $35 million. But for much of the life of ''Keene Valley,'' this was not necessarily the case."

2006-05-28T00:00:00Z,"OF all the possible business investments over the last decade, real estate at the Jersey Shore has been among the rosiest. While this is still largely true, real estate brokers say they have noticed an odd twist this season: extravagant houses in the $5 million to $10 million range are moving quickly, but sales of midpriced housing have slowed. ''Sometimes you don't know when a market is changing until it actually happens,'' said Ron Soldano, an agent with James C. Otton Real Estate in Stone Harbor. ''Suddenly, those meat-and-potatoes properties in Avalon and Stone Harbor, those that go for between $1 million and $2 million, these are just lying fallow.''"

2006-05-28T00:00:00Z,"Mills Corporation, the developer of the Xanadu shopping and entertainment complex at the Meadowlands, has acknowledged that the project will take longer, cost more and earn less money than originally projected, according to documents filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission. That disclosure rekindled fears on Wednesday that New Jersey may be spending hundreds of millions in tax dollars to provide infrastructure improvements for what could turn out to be little more than a shopping mall. But Mills executives and state officials say that there are no plans to curtail construction of the entertainment and extreme-sports facilities intended to make the complex as much of a tourist destination as a shopping center. In its filing with the S.E.C., Mills, based in Arlington, Va., said that Xanadu's opening would be delayed six months to a year beyond the recently announced date of the fall of 2007, and its cost would be higher than anticipated."

2006-05-28T00:00:00Z,"The MUSEUM OF MODERN ART has adopted a title with missionary zeal, ''To Save and Project,'' as the title of its annual festival of newly preserved films from the world's archives. And a mission it is, against the deadly alliance of time and chemistry that has destroyed, according to the figure most often quoted by preservationists, around 90 percent of the world's stock of silent films and at least 40 percent of all sound cinema. The monthlong program, which began on May 19, covers an array of genres and countries, from Hollywood films of the 1950's and 60's to a selection of features by TEUVO TULIO, a Finnish filmmaker active from 1929 to 1972, whom Aki Kaurismaki, Finland's current leading director, has praised as a master. Four of Tulio's melodramas are on view this week: ''THE CROSS OF LOVE'' (1946) Sunday at 5:30 p.m.; ''IN THE FIELDS OF DREAMS'' (1940) Monday at 1:30 p.m.; ''THE WAY YOU WANTED ME'' (1944) Monday at 3:45 p.m.; and ''THE SONG OF THE SCARLET FLOWER'' (1938), Monday at 6 p.m. The Italian filmmaker PIETRO GERMI is known for his acerbic social comedies, including the murderous satire ''Divorce, Italian Style'' (1961). But he began his career in the postwar era making crime films, very much in the American noir style of shadowy social realism. ''GIOVENTÙ PERDUTA'' (''Lost Youth'') was Germi's second feature, made in 1947 but still concerned with the lingering influence of fascism in the confused years after the war. Jacques Sernas stars as a strikingly Aryan college student, the son of a respected professor, who has organized his impressionable friends into a criminal gang that robs for thrills; a melodramatic flourish is provided by the enduringly popular leading man Massimo Girotti as a police infiltrator who falls in love with Sernas's sister. It's a terse, violent film that recalls the contemporary Hollywood work of Richard Fleischer and Anthony Mann. ''Gioventù Perduta'' screens on Sunday at 1 p.m. and Wednesday at 6 p.m. But the revelation of the week is an early film by the American master KING VIDOR. ''THE FAMILY HONOR,'' made in 1920, stars Florence Vidor, a beauty out of John Singer Sargent who was married to the director at the time, as a fallen aristocrat of the Old South. Like many of Vidor's protagonists, she is caught between the lure of urbanization (represented by her suitor, an enterprising local newspaper editor) and the comforts of rustification. But this time, it's the small town that turns out to be corrupt, and Vidor's indictment of the narrow village types is as sharply observant as his depiction of the vanished milieu of the self-contained small town. This lovely and trenchant film has been preserved by the Cinémathèque Française with its original tints. It shows on Friday at 2 p.m. 11 West 53rd Street, Manhattan, (212) 708-9400."
2006-05-28T00:00:00Z,"WHAT WE OWE IRAQ: War and the Ethics of Nation Building, by Noah Feldman. (Princeton University, $14.95.) In the spring of 2003 Feldman, a professor of constitutional law at New York University, helped shape Iraq's Transitional Administrative Law, the political road map for the country's journey from occupied territory to democratic nation. In ''What We Owe Iraq'' -- part theoretical treatise, part political analysis, part memoir -- Feldman, right, makes the case that when the United States invaded Iraq, it not only toppled a tyrant but also undertook a ''trusteeship'' on behalf of the Iraqi people. In SQUANDERED VICTORY: The American Occupation and the Bungled Effort to Bring Democracy to Iraq (Owl Books/Holt, $15), Larry Diamond recalls his time spent in Iraq as part of the Coalition Provisional Authority and argues that the country's postwar troubles are the result of ''gross negligence'' on the part of a Bush administration that rushed to war."
2006-05-28T00:00:00Z,"For more than two years, a high-powered group of New Yorkers has been trying to figure out ways to bring the state's huge shadow government into the daylight and thus give the public a handle on hundreds of loosely regulated public-private authorities responsible for almost $30 billion in state revenue and $114 billion in outstanding debt. Last week, the group -- known as the New York State Commission on Public Authority Reform -- proposed several useful but modest reforms that will need to be strengthened to ensure that the authorities operate more openly and responsibly. The authorities were originally set up to be more like private corporations, avoiding bureaucratic snarls and moving nimbly to build and maintain public works projects like canals and subways. But over the years they have grown in number from a few big construction agencies to several hundred authorities free of government meddling and the market constraints that keep most public corporations in check."

It is a success for the artists and for the curator, Mary Birmingham, who wanted to create an exhibition that reflected current issues in American society. She chose headlines as a theme, finding artists who worked with material gathered from the mass media to make art. The result is an intensely topical show. Ms. Birmingham, an independent curator, has selected artwork that refers to current events, politics and world affairs. Some of the work directly engages these issues, making social, cultural and political statements. But other work looks at what Ms. Birmingham calls in a catalog essay for the exhibition ''the mediation of news,'' or the way in which the news media package and filter information for consumption."

2006-05-28T00:00:00Z,"FOR me, Memorial Day weekend brings back memories of yard sales that have come and gone, but there is one that particularly sticks in my mind. It was an estate sale, to be exact, in Goldens Bridge. The books were heaped haphazardly across a floor muddy with the footprints of antiques hunters. I got there late, and the bookcases had been sold, along with most of the furniture. No matter; it was the books that caught my eye, old but in excellent shape, covers solid and bright, gilded titles still gleaming. I went right to my knees. Books only an English professor could love: American, a century old, mostly by forgotten writers. I began stacking them up, leafing through each volume to assess condition and to search for the treasures that sometimes fall out of old books: flowers, letters, handmade paper dolls."

2006-05-28T00:00:00Z,"Mame Dennis, that self-styled life force in a turban and high heels, may have launched a thousand drag queens since she showed up in Patrick Dennis's 1955 novel, ''Auntie Mame.'' But the indefatigable old siren has definitely had her effect on real women too, particularly American actresses in mid-career. In the 1950's Rosalind Russell (pushing 50 herself) acquired a sheen of high glamour (plus Tony and Oscar nominations) by appearing in the stage and film adaptations. And it was ''MAME,'' the 1966 musical version of the play, that made an A-list star out of Angela Lansbury. (Without Mame, would there have been a Jessica Fletcher?) And now it is the turn of CHRISTINE BARANSKI, who opens as the singing, dancing high-bohemian socialite on Thursday at the KENNEDY CENTER in Washington. Though she was won two Tonys and an Emmy for supporting roles, Ms. Baranski has long been a major musical comedy star waiting to happen, as anyone can testify who saw her show-stealing turn in the Encores! concert production of ''Promises, Promises'' at City Center. The question is whether ''Mame,'' which is really just a sweet sherry pretending to be a martini, will avoid the time-warp cramps that critics found in the 1983 Broadway revival (again starring Ms. Lansbury). Trying to ensure against signs of cultural aging are the inventive director ERIC SCHAEFFER and a supporting cast that includes HARRIET HARRIS (as the sourly pickled diva Vera Charles) and EMILY SKINNER (as the nerdy Agnes Gooch). The songs, of course, are by JERRY HERMAN, who, as the composer of both ''Mame'' and ''Hello, Dolly!,'' has kept many a post-ingénue actress in mink. (800) 444-1324; $25 to $90."

Born in the Bronx in 1913, she graduated from Hunter College in 1933. Grateful for her free education at the college, she created the first endowed chair at that institution, and was an active member and contributor to its Scholarship and Welfare fund. She worked at the Department of Welfare where she organized the first sitdown strike and later became the first female local president at DC37. She worked for Russian War Relief and the American Labor Party and developed the Furriers' union dental clinic. Later she went into private industry and was the first female president of a vitamin production company, Synergy Plus.

2006-05-28T00:00:00Z,"There is perhaps nothing so idealistic, in the best sense, as the ambition to make information available to the largest possible number of people. But Kevin Kelly's argument (May 14) in favor of a ''universal'' electronic library possesses a common flaw, which is expressed when the contents of books are routinely referred to as ''information.'' Books (and other forms of text) are, of course, far more than that; it is the purveyors of scanning technology who must portray books solely as information, for it is only as bits of information that books can be processed. Texts, which are not just objects but encounters, possess context: ideology, historicity, consciousness, form, not to mention body, material depth. This is true not just for verse and fiction, but for history and science. To ''integrate'' texts by extracting, remixing and reassembling them, to use Kelly's terms, is to obliterate the meaningful autonomy that distinguishes the individual work.

The scope of Ms. Hadid's work is particularly large. On view starting Saturday will be some 140 of her Constructivist-inspired paintings, sketchbooks and drawings, which she calls her ''testing fields.'' The building's top three ramps will be lined with 95 architectural models from her projects. The show will explore many of her recent buildings, including the Phaeno Science Center in Wolfsburg, Germany, and the BMW Central Building in Leipzig, Germany, along with her design for the Vitra Fire Station in Weil am Rhein, Germany, and the Rosenthal Center for Contemporary Art in Cincinnati. Also on view will be her prototype for the environmentally responsive, three-wheeled urban Z-Car, a commission for Kenny Schachter, a British collector and art dealer, as well as the Z-Kitchen, which was unveiled at the Milan Design Fair last month. The ''sensory responsive,'' science-fiction environment has two islands, one for fire, the other water, as well as a complete multimedia system.

Tuesday's concert has the minimalist producer OREN AMBARCHI as an opening act. One headliner is SUNN O))), a band that emits a low, ultra-heavy drone that can sound either welcoming or menacing or both. The other is BORIS, a Japanese trio that has grown less single-minded over time. The new Boris album is ''Pink'' (Southern Lord), which alternates between sludgy epics and fuzzy, punkish tantrums. 8:30, 662 Avenue of the Americas, at 20th Street, (212) 807-7780 or (212) 307-7171; $18 in advance, $20 at the door. A very different -- but also highly anticipated -- show comes to the APOLLO THEATER on Thursday night: the Atlanta rapper T. I. is to play two sets. His new album is ''King'' (Atlantic), and it's true, for now. It's the year's best and most popular hip-hop album so far. T. I. is part of the Southern insurgency that has redefined mainstream hip-hop over the past few years, but he's also something of a throwback: a meticulous craftsman, justly proud of his elegant flow. Expect some high-profile guests, along with an even more entertaining spectacle, a room full of New York hip-hop fans learning how to respect an out-of-towner. 7:30 and 11 p.m., 253 West 125th Street, Harlem, (212) 531-5305 or (212) 307-7171; $30 to $50."

2006-05-28T00:00:00Z,"The Airbus story is a frivolous example of a bigger professional truth -- the need for more thorough fact-checking and investigation. The story got traction, so to speak, because it confirmed everyone's worst suspicions of the airlines and experiences with air travel."

2006-05-28T00:00:00Z,"ELIOT FELD has been having a good season. It started with his spectacular ''Sir Isaac's Apples'' at the Juilliard School and continued with a Diamond Project premiere and two all-Feld programs at New York City Ballet. Now comes the annual stint of his BALLET TECH at the Joyce Theater, with the Mandance Project. The repertory will include two of the ballets seen at City Ballet, along with ''Mr. XYZ,'' with MIKHAIL BARYSHNIKOV in all performances during the first week. Wednesday through Saturday at 8 p.m., next Sunday at 7:30 p.m. and June 6-11, along with Kidsdance, next Sunday and June 10 at 2 p.m., Joyce Theater, 175 Eighth Avenue, at 19th Street, Chelsea, (212) 242-0800 or joyce.org; $42; Kidsdance, $30 for adults, $20 for children; for Wednesday gala tickets, call (212) 777-7710, ext. 316. Coincidence or competition? In the midst of American Ballet Theater's ''All Star Stravinsky'' program at the Metropolitan Opera House, the NEW YORK CITY BALLET has slipped its very own ''All Stravinsky'' program into the repertory at the New York State Theater. There is no overlap of scores or choreography, but the two programs should still make for a piquant comparison. Today at 3 p.m., New York State Theater, Lincoln Center, (212) 870-5570 or nycballet.org, $30 to $86, $15 for student rush tickets. DANCEMOPOLITAN -- or dancemOpolitan, as they write it down at Joe's Pub -- has established itself as one of the livelier, more unusual dance showcases in town. On the club's vest-pocket stage, with a different curator for each program, you can enjoy a dizzying revue of 10 or more dancers and dance companies. Friday and Saturday offer the ''Thrash and Rock Show,'' with a live band and, as hosts, THE NICOLES, who are Nicole Berger and Nicole Wolcott. Friday and Saturday at 9:30 p.m., Joe's Pub, at the Public Theater, 425 Lafayette Street, at Astor Place, East Village, (212) 239-6200 or telecharge .com; $15 in advance, $20 at the door; dinner reservations at (212) 539-8778."

2006-05-28T00:00:00Z,"To the Editor: Greg Sandow's review of Stephen Walsh's ''Stravinsky: The Second Exile'' (April 30) quotes Walsh to the effect that much of my work ''is riddled with bias, error, supposition and falsehood.'' I maintain that these terms apply more aptly to Walsh's work. The review concedes that ''Walsh is no longer courteous, and when discussing Craft his tone shifts from sarcasm to outrage.'' This hostility is glaring in the book's caption to a picture taken in January 1947: ''Studying the score of 'Persephone' with James Fassett'' (the producer) ''and Robert Craft, who has sneaked into the photograph.'' In reality, several other people standing between Stravinsky and me have been airbrushed out, since I was the last person in a line-up, positioned there by the photographer herself. Otherwise, the book pays me several unintended compliments, even elevating me to a higher realm: after berating Boulez for several paragraphs on Stravinsky's mistrust of him, Walsh quotes another composer's statement that ''Boulez rates (and fears!) only Craft and Stockhausen. He spits on the rest.'' Walsh relies heavily on oral history, with which the book is stuffed, but why does he continue trying to discredit someone who lived in the closest daily relationship with the composer for a quarter of a century? He also manages to avoid other accurately informed people who knew Stravinsky well, like Elliott Carter and Harold Shapero. A paragraph on Michael Tilson Thomas describing Stravinsky, taken from someone else's book, should have suggested to Walsh that the young conductor would qualify as a primary source. While a U.S.C. music student, Thomas was the keenest observer of everything about Stravinsky as conductor and composer, superbly mimicking the older man's conducting gestures and his speech. Thomas attended not only Stravinsky programs at the Los Angeles Monday Evening Concerts but others with the composer in the audience. The younger man can still point out passages in ''Agon'' that Stravinsky lifted from such masters as Schutz and Monteverdi. Thomas recalls the composer's own California concerts, imitating the expression on Stravinsky's face, as when he confused the program order and began beating the slow 12/8 of ''Firebird'' while the orchestra launched into the Fourth Tableau of ''Petrushka.'' Concluding that Stravinsky's 1959-60 concert series in New York left him ''out of pocket,'' Walsh misses an important aspect of the composer's character, his financial foxiness. In actuality, Stravinsky realized a handsome profit from the series by enlisting three different sponsors for the same event: the wealthy husband of his piano soloist in ''Movements''; Goddard Lieberson, who was induced to double Columbia Records' contribution; and the scrap-metal tycoon Hans Popper, who had hosted the composer's 1959 Japanese tour. A further boost to the budget came from Aaron Copland, Roger Sessions, Lukas Foss and Samuel Barber, who waived their performance fees as pianists in ''Les Noces.'' Having mentioned Sessions (another intimate source ignored by Walsh, who occasionally visited Stravinsky in his last years for the pleasure of conversing with him in Russian), I am reminded of a splurge of mistakes in ''The Second Exile'' concerning Stravinsky's participation in a Princeton symposium in 1959. Walsh claims that the Stravinskys ''set off from Hollywood at the end of August, and after a few days in Princeton . . . they flew on to London for the discussions with Eliot.'' In truth, the composer, coming by car from New York, spent a single day at the university, his purpose being to collect me for an earlier departure to Britain. Stravinsky arranged with Sessions to replace my lecture by giving one himself. There were no discussions with Eliot, since the two men had already abandoned the idea of collaboration. The crucial shortcoming of ''The Second Exile'' is its utter distortion of history in the sordid tale of the Stravinsky family rift, both before the composer's death and in the decade of litigation following. A full discussion of these matters would require a hefty volume, and would include New York City Surrogate Court records and the depositions taken by Martin Garbus. Walsh's bias in favor of the Stravinsky family heirs against his widow deprives the biography of any claim to objectivity. This is evident from the outset, since the book begins with a paean to the composer's 60-year-old grandson, who has consistently blocked the publication of a long overdue variorum edition of his grandfather's works, Stravinsky's most fervent wish.

2006-05-28T00:00:00Z,"FOR one of the freshest and most interesting perspectives on youth sports in recent years, consider the observations of Jeff Van Gundy, the former New York Knicks coach.

This was the first really nice day of the spring, and my roommate had just got over being sick, so we were all down by the river hanging out. It was the first time we could take out our capris and sandals and swimsuits and get a little color. Coming to Spain really, really opened up my eyes to a different lifestyle. In Seville, they are very much night people. I'm also really surprised how much ham they have. They have ham with everything; it's crazy.'' As told to Seth Kugel"

2006-05-28T00:00:00Z,"I am planning to stay in Nice and notice that prices quoted by hotels are much higher than those quoted by online travel sites. Should I risk giving my credit card details online or grit my teeth and pay a higher price directly with the hotel? -- Brittmarie Janson Perez, Albuquerque When you call a hotel, you will normally be quoted the rack rate, or the published price, whereas a travel agent or travel site should be able to offer you a discounted price. But, as with air fares, you never know whether the price you are offered is the best you can get. So it is worth comparing prices: 20 to 30 percent off the published price is a good deal for a four-star hotel."
2006-05-28T00:00:00Z,"Don't let the cool blue eyes and upturned collars of Germany's second-largest city and media capital fool you. Hamburg's moneyed set may subsidize a lavish array of Michelin-starred restaurants and sumptuous hotels, but it is the gritty, somewhat seedy districts of St. Pauli and the Reeperbahn that still show visitors a rollicking good time. GAMES -- An intriguing match up is in store when Argentina plays Ivory Coast on June 10. Scalpers won't be earning much, though, when Ecuador plays Costa Rica on June 15 or when Saudi Arabia takes on Ukraine on June 19. But expect prices to jump when two of Europe's leading teams, the Czech Republic and Italy, clash on June 22. There will be a quarterfinal on June 30. HOTELS -- A growing tourist spot, Hamburg has new design hotels, old guest houses and everything between. Last-minute travelers can call the city's tourist office (49-403-005-1500, www.hamburg-tourism.de) or show up at the welcome center in front of the city hall. For less bustle, drive an hour north to Lübeck on the Baltic coast (hotel hotline: 49-180-588-2233; www.luebeck-tourism.de). NO TICKET? -- An 860-square-foot screen will be set up in Heiligengeistfeld, a giant field next to Germany's favorite underdog team, St. Pauli. The site, which will have a food court resembling the city's famous fish market, is within stumbling distance of the Reeperbahn. BAR -- Fans of St. Pauli are among the world's most loyal, and patient. Get to know them at Herzblut (Reeperbahn 50; 49-403-339-6933; www.herzblut-st-pauli.de). Order the local brew, Astra, or risk dirty looks. After, head to Barbarabar (Hamburger Berg 11; 49-171-418-1418; www.barbarabar.de), where the crowd will relive the day's glories and tragedies on the foosball tables. DOWNTIME -- Hamburgers love their show tunes. Among the musicals you can sing along with between matches are ''Dirty Dancing,'' ''Mamma Mia!'' and ''The Lion King'' (''Der König der Löwen'').

The head-banging earlier this month at the Meadowlands' Bamboozle fest certainly helped solidify that hardcore rap sheet. And on its heels, the all-metal cross-country One Nation Undivided tour, headlined by the New Jersey bands Ill Niño and God Forbid, will provide reinforcement on June 8 at the Starland Ballroom in Sayreville."

This feature film follows Mr. Ross (above), Drew Carey, Blake Clark, Kyle Dunnigan and Kathy Kinney, among others, as they muster laughs in the Sunni Triangle -- while dealing with a mortar attack on their hotel and a common malady known as Sadaam's revenge. 8:30 P.M. (Nickelodeon) NICK NEWS SPECIAL EDITION -- No one does tween-speak better than the beguilingly candid Linda Ellerbee, precisely because she treats adolescents like adults, no matter how mature the subject matter. This 15thanniversary special looks at some of the brightest moments in her tenure at the helm of ''Nick News'' and demonstrates that, whether discussing religious differences, AIDS, eating disorders, gay parents, the war in Iraq or the race for president with 9- or 90- year-olds, Mr. Ellerbee never recoils. 9 P.M.

''Rejection is a terrible thing to take,'' he said. For Mr. Berkowitz, 66, a retired advertising executive, the word ''no'' does not exist in a competitive marketplace.

Born in Astoria, New York on July 19, 1924, Manuela was a long term resident of East Rockaway, New York, a graduate of City College, founder and partner in BFW Management, and dedicated long term volunteer and employee of the Helen Keller Services for the Blind. Devoted daughter and caretaker, she is predeceased by her mother and father, Manuela Garcia Romero and Manuel Romero, her brothers Anthony Romero and Joseph Romero, and her nephew Robert Romero. She is survived and grieved by her sisters-in-law Lee Murphy and Mildred Romero, her nephews Thomas Romero, Paul Romero and Philip Romero, her grand-nieces Kate and Tessa Romero, and her godchildren Morgan Avila and Robert Locke. Manuela was a woman of taste elegance and dignity. Respected and admired by all for her intelligence and independence, Manuela was a shining example of a life well lived, of happiness achieved through rigorous attention to detail and forthright honesty. A memorial service will be held on Sunday, June 18 at 2:00 P.M., at the home of Morgan Avila, 292 Ocean Ave, Lynbrook NY. All are encouraged to join us and celebrate her remarkable life. Manuela Romero was the person we all wish to be, a woman held in the highest esteem and missed by all who knew her."

I'm curious about why people from other cultures eat certain animal parts that would make even the hardiest ''Fear Factor'' contestant squeamish. When I was in a Beijing restaurant a few years ago, I pointed to chicken feet on the English menu. ''Ohhh, we don't have that,'' said the waitress, amused that an American tourist would pick the most inedible-sounding thing on an outdated menu. Little did I know then that I didn't have to go all the way to Beijing to satisfy my craving for chicken feet; all I had to do was drive a few miles to Kam Man Food in East Hanover. The supermarket, one of two Kam Mans in New Jersey, has a food court with a Chinese food counter, a Vietnamese food counter and a counter that serves Asian pastries, sweets and smoothies."

2006-05-28T00:00:00Z,"''RESCUE ME'' returns this week (FX, Tuesday at 10 p.m.), and viewers who thought that the Season 2 death of Tommy's young son might sink the show into a maudlin morass will be pleased that Tommy (played by DENIS LEARY) is showing surprising resilience. Of course what passes for resilience on ''Rescue Me,'' the firefighter drama, is a character who still drinks and talks to ghosts, and who remains angry to the point of near violence, but at least he's making jokes. SUSAN SARANDON will guest star as a love interest for Franco (DANIEL SUNJATA) beginning in the second episode. Nerds in prime time! ABC will broadcast ''THE 2006 SCRIPPS NATIONAL SPELLING BEE'' for the first time (Thursday at 8 p.m.). The preliminary rounds will be on ESPN earlier in the day (noon to 3 p.m.) so you can figure out your rooting interest. Elsewhere in nerd news, NBC's reality franchise ''LAST COMIC STANDING'' has made its way back onto the schedule (Tuesday at 8 p.m.) after flaming out in an ill-conceived, hurried third season in the summer of 2004. JAY MOHR, the irascible former host, has been replaced by ANTHONY CLARK of ''Yes, Dear'' infamy. Can the once breezily enjoyable comedy competition overcome these obstacles? Members of the ''LAGUNA BEACH'' cult who have wished that every reality series could be stuffed with compelling characters, gorgeously filmed and hypnotically paced can look forward to ''THE HILLS'' (MTV, Wednesday at 10 p.m.). This ''Laguna Beach'' spinoff follows the guileless, possibly simple-minded LAUREN CONRAD, late of Orange County, in her move to Los Angeles, where she gets an internship at Teen Vogue and enrolls in fashion school. From what viewers know of her already, Ms. Conrad seems destined to be surrounded by backstabbers and game players, and escaping Laguna has not changed her fate. Bad news for her, great news for us."

2006-05-28T00:00:00Z,"To the Editor: Joe Queenan's astute comparison of Frank Sinatra and Bruce Springsteen ('' 'My Way' or the Highway?,'' May 21) accurately points out the many similarities between these accomplished performers from the Garden State. However, I think he may have sold Springsteen short. Although Sinatra's music ''makes you feel like a million bucks,'' we need to remember that those ''feel-good'' songs were emblematic of the 1950's and early 60's, when, indeed, many Americans were happy just to enjoy the positive side of life and often avoided facing conditions that would later demand answers. Springsteen's darker music reflects the realism that had become necessary by the close of the 20th century, when many of the problems that were ignored in that earlier generation finally demanded our attention."

2006-05-29T23:12:31Z,"The BBC has struck a serious blow against workplace productivity around the planet by including, on the part of its World Cup site that profiles each of the teams in the competition, two features that could render otherwise productive office workers completely useless for hours at a time over the next six weeks. The first is an interactive ""Squad Selector"" allowing you to pick different starting 11's for each nation in the tournament, then arrange those players into various formations and finally e-mail the whole thing to all your friends, so that they can also stare intently at their screens all day, clicking away like mad and appearing to be deeply engaged in their jobs, while in fact doing nothing of any use to their employers. (Here, for example, is the Squad Selector for Holland -- whose manager, Marco van Basten, might now be rethinking his commitment to playing in a 4-3-3 after what The Guardian called a less-than-impressive 1-0 win over Cameroon this past weekend, despite the fact that the Indomitable But Argumentative Lions ""argued constantly, both with each other and the referee"" and had no less than 5 players booked for dissent during the match.)"

The shooting occurred about 1:10 a.m. at 202-01 116th Avenue, when a person who was not invited to the party fired several shots over the fence, striking the man in the neck, the police said.

The police declined to identify him last evening because it was unclear whether his family had been notified of his death, a police spokesman said. The shooting took place on Albany Avenue near Albany Manor, a dance hall where a reggae party was held on Saturday night, but it was unclear whether the victim had been at the party or had been involved in a fight there. The gunman sped away in a car, said a man who heard the shots, Thomas Gore, 70. "

Both were up in double-digit percentages compared with the previous season in total viewers and among adults 18 to 49 years old. After the two nights of ''Idol'' came CBS's ''CSI'' (25.2 million), followed by ''Desperate Housewives'' (22.2 million) and ''Grey's Anatomy'' (19.9 million). The most-watched new show of the season was the Monday edition of NBC's ''Deal or No Deal'' (15.8 million), which ranked 13th. ''The Unit'' (15.5 million) on CBS followed that and was the top scripted new show. ''Veronica Mars,'' formerly of UPN and now of the CW, was the least-watched show to be renewed for next season.

2006-05-29T00:00:00Z,"Shearwater ''Palo Santo'' (Misra) The last Shearwater album, ''Winged Life,'' was modest and charming, full of precisely written songs about bittersweet revelations. Shearwater, from Austin, Tex., is led by Jonathan Meiburg, a singer and songwriter and (as it happens) ornithologist who also plays in Okkervil River.

He was also something of a social climber and joined the military to get there. Still, George Washington (above, as portrayed by Jackson Bolt) is the standard to which American commanders are held.

2006-05-29T00:00:00Z,"MEMORIAL DAY MEANS the unofficial start of summer. But it also means the official start of another season: reality television season. The kickoff was last Thursday, when Fox presented the first reality show of the summer, ''So You Think You Can Dance,'' a talent competition for hoofers. That series jump-started the summer reality show monsoon one week early in a successful effort to grab some of the huge audience glued to the latest ''American Idol'' lollapalooza. [C1.] BRIAN TIERNEY, ADMAN, corporate pitchman, part P. T. Barnum, part Little Engine That Could, is grabbing any and all opportunities to expand outlets for the Philadephia newspapers and their shared Web site that he agreed to buy last week. [C1.] SONY, KNOWN IN the United States for electronics, has expanded into so many business areas in Japan and abroad that it has blurred its original identity as an engineering innovator. Analysts say this murkier image threatens one of the company's most profitable assets: the so-called Sony premium, the higher prices long commanded by its electronics products, which still account for 64 percent of revenue. [C1.] TV GUIDE PLANS give a free DVD of television clips to people who buy the magazine on the newsstand. The DVD, which will go on sale this Thursday and will be affixed to the front of 700,000 issues on newsstands on the East and West Coasts, features clips of 17 new and returning shows that editors recommend for summer viewing. The goal, TV Guide said, is to grab the attention of younger readers in an era when television listings are available free on cable and newspapers and magazines burst with articles about television shows and their stars. [C6.] THE NUMBER OF PEOPLE paying their bills online instead of by check is booming, according to a recent survey. Matthew Lewis, below, executive vice persident of CheckFree, which helps banks and billers build online bill presentation and payment serivces, says online payment services can help consumers. His company, he said, wants to make online bill payments part of the way Americans live their lives. [C4.] TACIT SOFTWARE IS preparing a Web service that will make it simple for online shoppers to pick the brains of friends and colleagues for opinions and expertise. Tacit plans to start testing the service, called Illumio, next month. The service allows the user to data mine the computers of friends, business associates and others with shared interests on any number of subjects. The system is intended to extend a growing category of software that helps groups collaborate and work together more efficiently. [C5.] THE ADVERTISING AGENCY that created the character of the lonely Maytag repairman is about to become lonely, too, as the new owner of Maytag appliances moves the account to another agency. Leo Burnett in Chicago, which has produced Maytag campaigns since 1955, is losing the assignment as the Whirlpool Corporation, which acquired the Maytag Corporation in March, consolidates accounts at its own agency, Publicis Worldwide in New York. [C6.] THE FRENCH INVESTOR Vincent Bolloré maneuvered four representatives onto the Havas board and eventually took over as chairman of the company last year. Now he hopes to star in a sequel. After installing himself at Havas, Mr. Bolloré started accumulating a stake in Aegis, which owns Carat, the largest buyer of media space and time in Europe and this month has taken steps that could give him more control and perhaps eventually a combiniation of Aegis with Havas. [C5.] WHEN CMP MEDIA and O'Reilly Media, sponsors of the Web 2.0 conference on technology and business, tried to prevent a nonprofit organization in Ireland from using the Web 2.0 name for a conference of its own, bloggers were incensed, saying the 2.0 philosophy is about sharing. CMP and O'Reilly said they were acting to protect a patent application they have for Web 2.0 but, in this case, they agreed to let the organizers use the name. [C6.] SINCE THE ELECTION of his minority Conservative government in January, Prime Minister Stephen Harper below, of Canada and his staff have repeatedly tried to change how Canada's news outlets deal with its prime minister. Mr. Harper's office is vetting minor government announcements, members of his cabinet have generally been off limits to reporters, and cameras have been blocked from covering the return of Canadian soldiers' remains from Afghanistan. About two dozen political reporters walked out of Mr. Harper's news conference last week in protest. [C3.] YOU LINK TO MINE; I'll link to yours.

Picket lines were removed by midafternoon after the strike was ruled illegal by a labor relations board. Service was partly in place by the evening rush hour."

We have, however, lost a decade of crucial time in which we could have started to address the problem of global warming; instead, politicians and pundits like Gregg Easterbrook worked hard to convince us that we should not act.

2006-05-30T00:00:00Z,"'X-Men' Cleans Up ''X-Men: The Last Stand'' hauled in an estimated $120.12 million at the box office over the four-day Memorial Day weekend, though its three-day gross was revised yesterday to $103.12 million from $107 million by the tracking company Exhibitor Relations. That total left ''X-Men'' (Fox), starring Halle Berry, Hugh Jackman, Rebecca Romijn, right, and Ian McKellen, far ahead of ''The Da Vinci Code'' (Sony), which took in $43 million for four days and $34 million for three. The third-place finisher was ''Over the Hedge'' (DreamWorks), with $35.34 million and $26.87 million, followed by ''Mission: Impossible III'' (Paramount), with $8.56 million and $6.69 million, and ''Poseidon'' (Warner Brothers), with $7 million and $5.53 million. The cumulative total, $228.58 million, amassed by the Top 12 films made this four-day Memorial Day weekend the second biggest, behind 2004 ($236.67 million). More New York Art for Berlin Buoyed by the spectacular success of a 2004 exhibition of 200 masterpieces from the Museum of Modern Art in New York, the New National Gallery in Berlin has announced plans for a major exhibition next year of 19th- and 20th-century art from the Metropolitan Museum of Art, Agence France-Presse reported. The show, ''Metro,'' from May 30 to Oct. 7, 2007, will present nearly 150 paintings by masters including van Gogh, Renoir, Monet, Manet, Pissarro, Delacroix, Toulouse-Lautrec, Picasso and Modigliani, as well as Rodin sculptures, among them ''The Burghers of Calais,'' right. The 2004 exhibition attracted 1.2 million visitors from all over Europe and remained open around the clock during its final days. Discussing the 2007 exhibition, Peter Raue, chairman of the Friends of the New National Gallery, said, ''We are, of course, again hoping for many, many visitors and will do everything to ensure that the lines are as short as possible.'' 16th-Century Sting Sting, below, will go time-tripping to the 16th century for his next album. What's more, it will be issued on a classical label, Deutsche Grammophon, in October. The focal instrument is the lute. On his Web site, Sting.com, he said that about two years ago he received a lute as a gift from the Argentine guitarist Dominic Miller, ''and I sort of became fascinated with it and immersed myself in the lute and lute music.'' He added: ''It reminded of an interest I've had for a long time -- for almost 25 years -- in the works of John Dowland. John Dowland was a 16th-century English composer who wrote songs for the lute. He was really the first singer-songwriter that we know of, and so a lot of us owe our living to this man.'' From this came the idea of an album of Dowland music. ''It's a strange record, a delightful record and I think people will be intrigued by it,'' Sting said. Silencing James Blunt One radio station has had enough of the chart-topping British rocker James Blunt, below, Agence France-Presse reported. Responding to listeners who said they were fed up with hearing ''You're Beautiful'' and ''Goodbye My Lover,'' Essex FM in southern England has banned his songs. ''We don't have anything against James Blunt, and we're pleased he has been so successful, but we really need a break,'' said Chris Cotton, the program director. He noted that the music industry pressures radio stations to play the music of certain performers over and over again. ''We're happy to stand up to this pressure and follow the strong message listeners have given us,'' Mr. Cotton said. ''We encourage other radio stations to take the same step.'' Ice Cube's Oprah Complaint Ice Cube has joined the chorus of rappers complaining that Oprah Winfrey has no use for hip-hop, The Associated Press reported. In an interview in the July issue of FHM magazine, to be published on June 6, Ice Cube, right, said, ''I've been involved in three projects pitched to her, but I've never been asked to participate.'' He added that she has had rapists, child molesters and ''lying authors'' on her show. ''If I'm not a rags-to-riches story for her, who is?'' Ludacris and 50 Cent have also been critical. A spokesman for Ms. Winfrey's production company, Harpo, told The A.P. that she would not respond directly to Ice Cube's remarks. Earlier this month, in a surprise appearance on the New York radio station WWPR-FM, known as Power 105.1, Ms. Winfrey said, ''I've been accused of not liking hip-hop, and that's just not true.'' Handke Prize Stirs Debate Does the avant-garde Austrian author Peter Handke deserve the $50,000 Heinrich Heine Prize for literature, or should he be disqualified because of his sympathies for the Yugoslav leader Slobodan Milosevic, who died in March in The Hague while on trial for genocide and war crimes? Fritz Kuhn, a parliamentary leader of the Green Party in Germany, said it would be a ''scandal'' to honor Mr. Handke, Agence France-Presse reported. Mr. Kuhn urged the city of Düsseldorf, the sponsor of the award, to overrule the jury. But Joseph Kruse, director of the Heinrich Heine Institute, who described Mr. Handke as ''increasingly lost,'' said it might be counterproductive to ''treat him as though he has the plague.'' The prize is to be awarded on Dec. 13 but must first be confirmed in June by the Düsseldorf authorities. Last month the Comédie-Française, citing his Milosevic support, canceled plans to produce a Handke play."

Aside from that effort, there is a split in the King campaign as to what to tell the roughly 10 percent of the delegates already committed to Mr. King.

[A1.] THE BATTLE FOR AIR -- Americans are increasingly recognizing that the effects of carbon emissions on global warming are a serious problem, but there are no rules in the United States regulating heat-trapping gases comparable to those that most other developed countries have adopted under the Kyoto Protocol. Some United States businesses, though, are responding for a variety of reasons anyway: to satisfy customers or shareholders who worry about the environment, to improve their public image or to drive down their energy costs.

After all, life on earth holds uncountable mysteries. Here's one that puzzles me: Why is it that no birds have evolved pregnancy? Representatives of all the other major groups of backboned animals, from guppies to skinks, have evolved to give birth - why not birds? It would surely be better for an emperor penguin to give birth than to play ice hockey with its egg. Another: Can you alter the odds of conceiving a son or a daughter by altering how often and when you have sex? Tentative evidence suggests you might be able to - but the data are deeply unclear. And how about this: What, apart from thinking, does the sperm whale use its head for? A sperm whale's head makes up about one third of its body length, and much of the space is taken up by something called the spermaceti organ - but despite much speculation (is it acoustical? A battering ram?), no one knows exactly what this does."

If he is confirmed, ethics rules could force him to give up authority over most of his $700 million stake in Goldman Sachs. As Treasury secretary, Mr. Paulson will make $175,700, not much more than a junior investment banker; last year at Goldman Sachs, he made more than $38 million. BY ERIC DASH, PAGE C5"

2006-05-31T00:00:00Z,"SOKOLOFF -- Alice Hunt. Died April 29, 2006 in Sun Valley, Idaho. She was born in New York, June 3, 1912, the daughter of the late Dr. James Ramsay Hunt, professor of neurology at Columbia University, who was arguably the pre-eminent neurologist of the 20th century. Her mother was the late Alice St. John Nolan, of Springfield, Illinois. She survived her beloved husband, Dr. Boris Sokoloff, originally of St. Petersburg, Russia, who first came to this country at the invitation of the Rockefeller Institute from the Pasteur Institute in Paris. He also worked at Sloan Kettering and University of Washington Cancer Research Center, authored 27 books, and ended his career as head of The Cancer Research Laboratory at Florida Southern College. He also was editor of the scientific journal, Growth. Her much loved brother was the late James Ramsay Hunt Jr., former intelligence officer with the CIA. She was a loving and beloved mother to Kiril, of Boca Raton, Florida, and Sun Valley, Idaho, and leaves behind her precious grandchildren, Jay and Emily Sokoloff. As the last of her generation by more than 25 years, she was a loving aunt to four nieces and nephews, to whom she was a mainstay of support over the years, and was great-aunt to twelve great-nieces and nephews. Alice was a precocious student, being admitted to Radcliffe when she was only 16. A child of the Depression, she was obliged to leave college after only one year and worked as a researcher and writer in New York City. She was an accomplished pianist and musician who studied composition with Rubin Goldmark and Constantin Shvedoff. She wrote in many different forms and her works include a symphony, several shorter orchestral pieces, three string quartets and works for solo instruments and various chamber groups, several of which have been performed at Carnegie Hall. She was a pupil of Alexander Siloti, considered the greatest pianist of his day as well as a student of Franz Liszt, whose daughter, Cosima Wagner, was the subject of one of Alice's three biographies. Another biography was entitled Hadley: The First Mrs. Hemmingway. It is generally regarded that ''A Movable Feast'' by Ernest Hemmingway was written by Ernest as a love story for his first wife. The other biography was a riches to rags story, the life of Kate Chase Smith, who was the daughter of Salmon Chase, Secretary of the Treasury, under Lincoln who experienced a tragic fall. For 25 years, Alice wrote classical music reviews for a syndicate of newspapers. In her spare time, she wrote mystery stories, which were published in many popular magazines. When her husband died in 1979, she returned to her roots in Westchester County, where she spent many years as a volunteer in the oncology department of Northern Westchester Hospital in Mount Kisco. She considered this the most rewarding work of her life. Sharp until the end, she was passionately interested in current affairs. She considered her childhood summers on the farm in Katonah, New York to have shaped her life. A great dog lover, she took much interest in the myriad canine personalities who became a part of her life over the years. Her loving devotion to and involvement in the lives of the younger members of her family was a sustaining pleasure for her and for them. A memorial service will take place on Saturday, June 3, 2006, 2 P.M. at St. Matthew's Church, in Bedford, New York. Memorial contributions may be made to the Idaho Compassion."

2006-05-31T00:00:00Z,"CASSON--Dr. Phillip Raynor. Died on May 29 following a recent illness. Born in Sydney, Australia, Dr. Casson graduated from the Sydney High Boys School and went on to attend the Sydney University medical School. After graduating with a BS and MB in medicine he went to Broome, Australia, to work as a surgeon in the Flying Doctor's Service, the airplane-based medical unit that made it possible for resident of the Australian Outback to receive emergency medical care. Dr. Casson then spent 12 years as a practicing surgeon in England, becoming a Fellow of the Royal College of Surgeons in 1958. He came to the United States in 1959 to do a Fellowship in head and neck cancer at Sloan-Kettering Memorial Hospital. In 1963, he joined the staff at the New York University Medical Center at the urging of Dr. John Converse, who had recently founded the Institute of Reconstructive and Plastic Surgery at the hospital. There, Dr. Casson became involved in pioneering transplant research, most notably in that being conducted by Dr. Jean Dausset of Paris, France. Along with Dr. Converse and the late Dr. Felix Rapaport, Dr. Casson helped Dr. Dausset investigate the significance of tissue typing and histocompatibility in facilitating the successful transplantations of human organs, groundbreaking ideas in the medical field and for which Dr. Dausset received the 1980 Nobel Prize. Dr. Casson remained on the staff of NYU Medical Center as an Associate Professor of Plastic Surgery until his retirement in 2004. He was also an Assistant Attending Surgeon at Tisch Hospital and an Associate Attending Surgeon at the New York Eye and Ear Infirmary. He was a member of the American College of Surgeons, the American Society of Plastic and Reconstructive Surgery and the Transplant Society. He was also a founding member of the Pawling Mountain Club in Pawling, NY. Dr. Casson will be remembered as a warm and caring husband, father and physician. A gifted surgeon who made enduring contributions to the medical community, he remained a mentor to many surgeons who trained under him over the course of his long career.

2006-05-31T00:00:00Z,"After the final two women left on ''The Apprentice'' turned on each other in last week's episode, Donald Trump decided to fire them both for disloyal behavior. That left Sean and Lee as the finalists, and the two men competed in Monday's penultimate episode. NBC's ''Apprentice'' did not benefit from being one of the few original offerings on the prime-time schedule; in Nielsen's estimates, it brought in 9.63 million viewers, in line with its average for this edition. But NBC performed steadily, and its ''Deal or No Deal'' rerun at 8 p.m. was the night's most-watched show, with 13.66 million viewers, making the network No. 1 among total viewers and adults 18 to 49. On ABC the fourth game of the N.B.A.'s Eastern Conference finals was broadcast live, so its ratings were preliminary. But it appeared to put the network in a tie with CBS for second place in the 18-to-49 demographic. KATE AURTHUR"

The defendant, Lina Sinha, 40, who was a teacher at the Montessori International School of New York, was initially charged last fall with abusing one student, but charges were added at yesterday's indictment. The Manhattan district attorney, Robert M. Morgenthau, said that Ms. Sinha was also charged with bribing one student not to testify before a grand jury. Gerald Shargel, her lawyer, said she took a polygraph test that indicated ''she was telling the truth when she denied the allegations.'' Ms. Sinha, who has pleaded not guilty, is on leave from the school."

Though the mencía grape and the Bierzo wines made from it tended to tip the scale in the direction of rusticity, Bierzo is a region in transition, where modern winemaking is changing the flavor profile. Repeat: You can't go wrong with lamb, specifically, lamb on the grill. Because I found hints of rosemary in both the bouquet of some of these wines and on my palate, I decided to let this herb carry the day. You can't go wrong with rosemary, either."
2006-05-31T00:00:00Z,"AS European techniques have their inevitable impact on Asian desserts -- a trend you see both in Asia and in the United States -- it's pleasant to turn to a traditional Thai dessert, one that, oddly enough, reminds me of American strawberry shortcake. With mangoes, sticky rice and coconut milk, you have a sweet-and-acidic fruit over a sweetened starch topped with a sweet ''cream.'' O.K., it's not a perfect analogy, but with mango season in full swing, it's a great dessert. At this time of year the price of mangoes falls and their quality rises. The small, deep yellow Champagne mangoes are abundant now, and the standard red-green variety is sold ripe for a change."

2006-06-01T00:00:00Z,"ALDWELL - Edward. Mannes College and The New School mourn the passing of Edward Aldwell, distinguished pianist, educator, learned musician, and scholar. Over several decades, Ed taught and helped launch the careers of many pianists, unstintingly imparting his knowledge and artistry to generations of students. His groundbreaking text, ''Harmony and Voice Leading'' (co-authored with Carl Schachter), helped transform the teaching of music theory throughout the world. His immensely intelligent performances and recordings, especially of the music of J.S. Bach, are widely appreciated. He generously supported Mannes in all ways. A genuinely wise and gentle soul in an era with few such people, his presence will be sorely missed.

2006-06-01T00:00:00Z,"Struggling to cope with a 1,000-plus percent annual inflation rate, Zimbabwe introduced a new $100,000 bank note, double the $50,000 note that had been the largest denomination in circulation. Still, the new note is only worth about one American dollar at official exchange rates, and draws only about 30 American cents on the black market, which more accurately reflects its value. The new note may help ease a growing currency shortage. The United Nations regional news agency quoted Zimbabwe Reserve Bank officials as saying that the country had run short of money after the government ran out of the foreign exchange needed to buy the imported ink and paper required to print bills.

2006-06-01T00:00:00Z,"Broadway was crowded this season with popular long-running musicals, surprise hits, celebrities and, apparently, tourists. All those crowds broke a few records. According to statistics released yesterday by the League of American Theaters and Producers, paid attendance climbed just above 12 million for the first time, up 4.1 percent from the previous season's 11.5 million. More than four-fifths of seats were filled for the season, a record. But the real jump on Broadway was in the grosses; this season, sales reached a record $861.6 million, up 12 percent from last season's receipts. The discrepancy between the leap in gross receipts and the growth in paid attendance can be explained in part by the popularity of premium tickets, for shows like ''Wicked'' and ''The Phantom of the Opera,'' above, which can command three times the regular price of a top orchestra seat. Tourists continued to be a large part of the record crowds, making up more than half the tickets sold. CAMPBELL ROBERTSON"

2006-06-01T00:00:00Z,"There was a time, not long ago, when the idea of jet travel in the Persian Gulf countries conjured up images of white-robed sheiks accompanied by cages full of squawking falcons and of European oil executives lounging in first-class luxury -- of a frequent-flier population more at home with a large entourage than a humble rolling suitcase. How things have changed. Now, in the domed rotunda of the old-fashioned little airport in Sharjah, you are as likely to come across a family of Egyptians returning from a shopping spree in Dubai or a group of young men from the United Arab Emirates off for a week of partying in Beirut.

Born in Sydney, Australia, Dr. Casson graduated from the Sydney High Boys School and went on to attend the Sydney University medical School. After graduating with a BS and MB in medicine he went to Broome, Australia, to work as a surgeon in the Flying Doctor's Service, the airplane-based medical unit that made it possible for resident of the Australian Outback to receive emergency medical care. Dr. Casson then spent 12 years as a practicing surgeon in England, becoming a Fellow of the Royal College of Surgeons in 1958. He came to the United States in 1959 to do a Fellowship in head and neck cancer at Sloan-Kettering Memorial Hospital. In 1963, he joined the staff at the New York University Medical Center at the urging of Dr. John Converse, who had recently founded the Institute of Reconstructive and Plastic Surgery at the hospital. There, Dr. Casson became involved in pioneering transplant research, most notably in that being conducted by Dr. Jean Dausset of Paris, France. Along with Dr. Converse and the late Dr. Felix Rapaport, Dr. Casson helped Dr. Dausset investigate the significance of tissue typing and histocompatibility in facilitating the successful transplantations of human organs, groundbreaking ideas in the medical field and for which Dr. Dausset received the 1980 Nobel Prize. Dr. Casson remained on the staff of NYU Medical Center as an Associate Professor of Plastic Surgery until his retirement in 2004. He was also an Assistant Attending Surgeon at Tisch Hospital and an Associate Attending Surgeon at the New York Eye and Ear Infirmary. He was a member of the American College of Surgeons, the American Society of Plastic and Reconstructive Surgery and the Transplant Society. He was also a founding member of the Pawling Mountain Club in Pawling, NY. Dr. Casson will be remembered as a warm and caring husband, father and physician. A gifted surgeon who made enduring contributions to the medical community, he remained a mentor to many surgeons who trained under him over the course of his long career. He was an avid sportsman and oenophile who enjoyed the company of a wide variety of friends who shared his interests and sense of humor. He is survived by his loving wife Rosemary and daughters, Nicole, Victoria and Lindsay. In lieu of flowers, contributions may be sent in his memory to the National Foundation for Facial Reconstruction, 317 East 34th Street, Suite 901, New York, NY 10016.

2006-06-02T00:00:00Z,"Thanks to the Public Art Fund, there is almost always an interesting sculpture on the Doris C. Freedman Plaza on Central Park's southeast corner. Currently in residence is ''Corner Plot,'' above, a magical, site-specific work by Sarah Sze. From the outside you see a low pyramid constructed of brick, glass and metal, resembling the rooftop corner of an apartment building like the one diagonally across Fifth Avenue from the plaza. It looks as if a whole building had toppled and sunk into the ground as a result of some natural or supernatural disaster. Up close you can see through windows on two sides, down into one of Ms. Sze's signature, semi-Cubist, semi-Surrealist environments made of materials and objects you could purchase at Home Depot, Staples and Wal-Mart. There are multilevel shelves, abstract gridded structures, yardsticks held in place by clamps, desk lamps projecting every which way, a miniature flight of spiral stairs and a plant with round, bright green leaves. The space is also neatly stocked with household goods like toilet paper rolls, white towels, water bottles, soap bars and a fire extinguisher. It looks partly like a survival shelter created by a mad architect and partly like an unusually imaginative department store window display. The interior is not quite as wonderful as the fantastic exterior leads you to expect, but the sculpture as a whole scores a rare public-art hat trick: it appeals to the cognoscenti, intrigues random passers-by and delights children.

The operators agreed to cut their wholesale roaming charges to 0.45 euro (58 cents) a minute, from 0.90 euro ($1.15) starting Oct. 1, and to cut them to 0.36 euro (46 cents) in October 2007.

Café d'Alsace With more than 110 pilsners and lagers and bocks, along with a designated beer sommelier to explain them all, Café d'Alsace is New York's newest paradise for beer lovers. But what makes it even more special is that it could stand alone as a fetching brasserie with accomplished (although inconsistent) food, including first-rate sausages, a satisfying choucroute garnie, a warm potato salad like no other and terrific desserts. It's a sturdy restaurant, not just a gimmicky one, and won't be beer today and gone tomorrow. 1695 Second Avenue, at 88th Street; (212) 722-5133. Dinner entrees, $16.75 to $29.96. ** [Rating: Two Stars] Sascha Downstairs is a brasserie-style space that would clearly like to compete with the nearby Pastis. Upstairs is a quieter refuge with leather booths, tasseled lampshades and tablecloths. And uniting the two levels is the menu and cooking of Sascha Lyon, whose American and Continental standard-bearers seem to channel the spirit of a Midwestern hotel. It's an odd and uneventful restaurant but an often enjoyable one, with a rack of lamb (upstairs) and double burger (downstairs) that prompt no complaints. 55 Gansevoort Street, at Ninth Avenue, meatpacking district; (212) 989-1920. Lunch and dinner entrees, $15 to $42. * [Rating: One Star] Crema Taking Mexican cooking in the kind of nuanced directions that too few restaurants in New York do, Julieta Ballesteros, formerly of Mexicana Mama, lays chicken on a purée of squash blossoms, puts portobello mushroom atop it and crowns it all with goat cheese. Imaginative flourishes or intricate architecture define many of her dishes, but the kitchen's execution does not always live up to the recipes. The cheerful, orange-tinged setting and fine margaritas are definite compensation, and Ms. Ballesteros is a chef to watch. 111 West 17th Street, Manhattan; (212) 691-4477. Dinner entrees, $17 to $26. * [Rating: One Star] A Voce The chef Andrew Carmellini's solo debut, A Voce concerns itself more with sating than with wowing you, and does so with seasonal ingredients, full-flavored dishes and superior cooking. Mr. Carmellini's terrific pasta dishes include agnolotti filled with duck and covered in a foie gras sauce, and pappardelle with a lamb Bolognese shine, and he's got a talent for meatballs, alternately made of duck, pork and shrimp. The stylized, contemporary room doesn't really go with the food, but there are enormously comfortable swivel chairs as a compensation, along with a thoughtful wine list. 41 Madison Avenue, entrance on 26th Street; (212) 545-8555.

''You still attend to the kid and you love the kid, but you also begin to learn how to let the kid teach you stuff.'' Mr. Gutierrez's mesmerizing solo was a handful as a newborn; one can only imagine what has transpired since then. The work, above, which probes the performer's relationship to the audience, contains nudity, but far more revealing is Mr. Gutierrez's baring of his mental and emotional landscape; a shifting, fragile terrain that seems to consist equally of bravado and vulnerability. That mix is part of what makes him such an irresistible performer, whether he's mimicking a tape of himself mouthing off at a panel discussion or following a set of unspoken rules in a section of improvisational movement. ''I won't tell you what I'm thinking because then it's no fun for me,'' his e-mail teased. Also returning to the Workshop is Mr. Gutierrez's ''Difficult Bodies,'' a dance for three women that, with ''Retrospective Exhibitionist,'' creates a performance diptych. As with his solo, Mr. Gutierrez would only hint at subtle but important changes that ''invigorate and underline the 'power' of the women in the piece.'' Powerful women or no, they also function as representations of Mr. Gutierrez, in all his dizzying forms.

WHAT -- 3-bedroom house About two years ago, I got an inkling that it was time for a change. My son and daughter were in college, and after years of being active in the community -- the P.T.A., the community board, our synagogue, you name it -- my wife and I sensed it was time to slow down."
2006-06-02T00:00:00Z,"Three people testified yesterday at the hearing of a committee considering raises for the city's elected officials for the first time since 1999. A representative of the Staten Island borough president, James P. Molinaro, said it was ''ridiculous'' that borough presidents were paid only $135,000, far less than the salary of several mayoral aides. Two civic groups, the New York Public Interest Research Group and the Citizens Union, supported modest salary increases. The commission is scheduled to deliver a report by August to Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg (who refused the official salary of $195,000 and accepts a token $1). He will then present his own recommendations to the Council, whose members are paid $90,000. SEWELL CHAN (NYT)"

2006-06-02T00:00:00Z,"Idol Signs Deal to Record To the victor belong the spoils. Taylor Hicks, below, has signed the contract that comes with his victory in the latest ''American Idol'' competition, The Associated Press reported.

Second Stage, 307 West 43rd Street, Clinton, (212) 246-4422. Broadway * 'AWAKE AND SING!' Dreams and disappointments, hopes and fears, encouraging words and bitter put-downs clash by day and night in Clifford Odets's turbulent comedy-drama about a Jewish family struggling to stay afloat in the 1930's. A gifted roster of performers -- including Mark Ruffalo, Lauren Ambrose, Zoë Wanamaker and Ben Gazzara -- manage to locate the dreaming centers of their characters, buried beneath layers of political sloganeering, everyday gripes or street slang. And even when the focus occasionally blurs in Bartlett Sher's ultimately moving revival, Odets's zesty dialogue, in which jazzy period colloquialisms are slung around like punches at a prize fight, is a joy to hear (2:30). Belasco Theater, 111 West 44th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Charles Isherwood) * 'BRIDGE & TUNNEL' This delightful solo show, written and performed by Sarah Jones, is a sweet-spirited valentine to New York City, its polyglot citizens and the larger notion of an all-inclusive America. In 90 minutes of acutely observed portraiture gently tinted with humor, Ms. Jones plays more than a dozen men and women participating in an open-mike evening of poetry for immigrants (1:30). Helen Hayes Theater, 240 West 44th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Isherwood) 'THE COLOR PURPLE' So much plot, so many years, so many characters to cram into less than three hours. This beat-the-clock musical adaptation of Alice Walker's Pulitzer Prize-winning novel about Southern black women finding their inner warriors never slows down long enough for you to embrace it. LaChanze leads the vibrant, hard-working cast (2:40). Broadway Theater, 1681 Broadway, at 53rd Street, (212) 239-6200. (Ben Brantley) 'DIRTY ROTTEN SCOUNDRELS' The arrival of Jonathan Pryce and his eloquent eyebrows automatically makes this the season's most improved musical. With Mr. Pryce (who replaces the admirable but uneasy John Lithgow) playing the silken swindler to Norbert Leo Butz's vulgar grifter, it's as if a mismatched entry in a three-legged race had become an Olympic figure-skating pair (2:35). Imperial Theater, 249 West 45th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley) 'THE DROWSY CHAPERONE' This small and ingratiating spoof of 1920's stage frolics, as imagined by an obsessive show queen, may not be a masterpiece. But in a dry season for musicals, ''The Drowsy Chaperone'' has theatergoers responding as if they were withering house plants, finally being watered after long neglect. Bob Martin and Sutton Foster are the stand-outs in the eager, energetic cast (1:40). Marquis Theater, 1535 Broadway, at 45th Street, (212) 307-4100. (Brantley) *'FAITH HEALER' In the title role of Brian Friel's great play, Ralph Fiennes paints a portrait of the artist as dreamer and destroyer that feels both as old as folklore and so fresh that it might be painted in wet blood. Also starring Cherry Jones and the superb Ian McDiarmid, this mesmerizing series of monologues has been directed with poetic starkness by Jonathan Kent (2:35). Booth Theater, 222 West 45th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley) * 'THE HISTORY BOYS' Madly enjoyable. Alan's Bennett's play about a battle for the hearts and minds of a group of university-bound students, imported with the original British cast from the National Theater, moves with a breezy narrative swagger that transcends cultural barriers. Directed by Nicholas Hytner, with a perfectly oiled ensemble led by the superb Richard Griffiths and Stephen Campbell Moore as schoolmasters with opposing views of history and education (2:40). Broadhurst Theater, 235 West 44th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley) 'HOT FEET' A dancing encyclopedia of clichés set to the music of Earth, Wind and Fire. Numbing (2:30). Hilton Theater, 213 West 42nd Street, (212) 307-4100. (Isherwood) 'JERSEY BOYS' From grit to glamour with the Four Seasons, directed by the pop repackager Des McAnuff (''The Who's Tommy''). The real thrill of this shrink-wrapped bio-musical, for those who want something more than recycled chart toppers and a story line poured from a can, is watching the wonderful John Lloyd Young (as Frankie Valli) cross the line from exact impersonation into something far more compelling (2:30). August Wilson Theater, 245 West 52nd Street, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley) * 'THE LIEUTENANT OF INISHMORE' Please turn off your political correctness monitor along with your cellphone for Martin McDonagh's gleeful, gory and appallingly entertaining play. This blood farce about terrorism in rural Ireland, acutely directed by Wilson Milam, has a carnage factor to rival Quentin Tarantino's. But it is also wildly, absurdly funny and, even more improbably, severely moral (1:45). Lyceum Theater, 149 West 45th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley) 'THE LIGHT IN THE PIAZZA' Love is a many-flavored thing, from sugary to sour, in Adam Guettel and Craig Lucas's encouragingly ambitious and discouragingly unfulfilled new musical. The show soars only in the sweetly bitter songs performed by the wonderful Victoria Clark, as an American abroad (2:15). Beaumont Theater, Lincoln Center, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley) * 'THE PAJAMA GAME' Sexual chemistry in a Broadway musical? Isn't that illegal now? If it were, then Harry Connick Jr. and Kelli O'Hara -- the white-hot stars of Kathleen Marshall's delicious revival of this 1954 musical -- would be looking at long jail terms. This intoxicating production, which features a charming supporting cast led by Michael McKean, allows grown-up audiences the rare chance to witness a bona fide adult love affair translated into hummable songs and sprightly dance (2:30). American Airlines Theater, 227 West 42nd Street, (212) 719-1300. (Brantley) *'SHINING CITY' Quiet, haunting and absolutely glorious. Conor McPherson's impeccably assembled ghost story about being alone in the crowded city of Dublin has been brought to American shores with a first-rate cast (Brian F. O'Byrne, Oliver Platt, Martha Plimpton and Peter Scanavino), directed by Robert Falls (1:45). Biltmore Theater, 261 West 47th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley) * 'SWEENEY TODD' Sweet dreams, New York. This thrilling new revival of Stephen Sondheim and Hugh Wheeler's musical, with Michael Cerveris and Patti LuPone leading a cast of 10 who double as their own musicians, burrows into your thoughts like a campfire storyteller who knows what really scares you. The inventive director John Doyle aims his pared-down interpretation at the squirming child in everyone who wants to have his worst fears both confirmed and dispelled (2:30). Eugene O'Neill Theater, 230 West 49th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley) 'TARZAN' This writhing green blob with music, adapted by Disney Theatrical Productions from the 1999 animated film, has the feeling of a super-deluxe day-care center, equipped with lots of bungee cords and karaoke synthesizers, where kids can swing when they get tired of singing, and vice versa. The soda-pop score is by Phil Collins (2:30). Richard Rodgers Theater, 226 West 46th Street, (212) 307-4747. (Brantley) 'THREE DAYS OF RAIN' In this revival of Richard Greenberg's slender, elegant drama of family disconnectedness, Julia Roberts is stiff with self-consciousness, glancingly acquainted with the two characters she plays and deeply, disturbingly beautiful. Otherwise, it is almost impossible to discern the virtues of the play itself in this wooden and splintered production, directed by Joe Mantello and also starring Paul Rudd and Bradley Cooper, who have little chance of capturing the audience's attention (2:30). Bernard B. Jacobs Theater, 242 West 45th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley) 'THE THREEPENNY OPERA' Presented as a long, pansexual orgy, Scott Elliot's numbing revival of the Brecht-Weill classic feels like a party where the hangover begins almost as soon as the evening does. The starry cast includes Alan Cumming (as Mac the Knife) and a Dietrich-like Cyndi Lauper, though only Jim Dale and Nellie McKay appear to have a clue as to what the show is about (2:40). Studio 54, 254 West 54th Street, (212) 719-1300. (Brantley) * 'THE 25TH ANNUAL PUTNAM COUNTY SPELLING BEE' The happy news for this happy-making little musical is that the move to larger quarters has dissipated none of its quirky charm. William Finn's score sounds plumper and more rewarding than it did on Off Broadway, providing a sprinkling of sugar to complement the sass in Rachel Sheinkin's zinger-filled book. The performances are flawless. Gold stars all around (1:45). Circle in the Square, 1633 Broadway, at 50th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Isherwood) 'THE WEDDING SINGER' An assembly-kit musical that might as well be called ''That 80's Show,'' this stage version of the 1998 film is all winks and nods and quotations from the era of big hair and junk bonds. The cast members, who include Stephen Lynch and Laura Benanti, are personable enough, which is not the same as saying they have personalities (2:20). Al Hirschfeld Theater, 302 West 45th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley) Off Broadway 'ANNULLA' Eileen De Felitta is charming in Emily Mann's worthy one-woman play about a Jewish woman who passed for Aryan in Nazi Germany, but too much time is devoted to less intriguing aspects of the character's life (1:20). Theater at St. Luke's, 308 West 46th Street, Clinton, (212) 239-6200. (Anita Gates) 'ASSISTED LOVING' This warm and witty monologue by Bob Morris, who contributes the Age of Dissonance column to the Sunday Styles section of The New York Times, is performed by the author, who chronicles his widowed father's and his own search for love in and around New York. Engaging, subtle and winning (1:10). Daryl Roth Theater, D-Lounge, 103 East 15th Street, at Union Square, (212) 239-6200. (George Hunka) * 'BILLY CONNOLLY LIVE!' This popular comedian will remind you of a Scottish George Carlin, with a bit of Eddie Izzard mixed in (2:00). 37 Arts, 450 West 37 Street, (212) 307-4100. (Jason Zinoman) 'CAGE LOVE' The new thriller by Christopher Denham -- star of ''Red Light Winter'' -- is a compulsively watchable, sometimes ridiculous drama about a man who becomes increasingly suspicious of his wife-to-be (1:30). Rattlestick Theater, 224 Waverly Place, Greenwich Village, (212) 868-4444. (Zinoman) 'CIRQUE DU SOLEIL -- CORTEO' The Cirque du Soleil's latest extravaganza, which upholds the ubiquitous Cirque standard, is a fantasy of a dead (though cheerful) clown imagining his own funeral. Unsurprisingly, his cortege is full of circus acts (2:30). Grand Chapiteau at Randall's Island, (800) 678-5440. (John Rockwell) 'COLUMBINUS' The grim ecosphere of the average American high school is analyzed with sympathy and precision in this new play by Stephen Karam and P J Paparelli, which aims to expose the cultural and personal pathologies that gave rise to the horrific events in Littleton, Colo., in 1999, when two students went on a murderous rampage at Columbine High School, killing a dozen students and a teacher before killing themselves. Well acted and stylishly directed, the play exudes earnestness, and a measure of self-importance, too (2:00). New York Theater Workshop, 79 East Fourth Street, East Village, (212) 239-6200. (Isherwood) 'DARK YELLOW' Elias Koteas and Tina Benko star in this compelling one-act psychological thriller about a one-night stand that involves one shocking revelation after another (1:35). Studio Dante, 257 West 29th Street, Chelsea, (212) 868-4444. (Gates) 'HAMLET' Theater by the Blind's modest, pared-down production offers an angry, sarcastic prince; an Ophelia who won't stop singing; and a Polonius who actually seems to know what he's saying (2:15). Theater Five, 311 West 43rd Street, Clinton, (212) 868-4444. (Gates) 'JACQUES BREL IS ALIVE AND WELL AND LIVING IN PARIS' A powerfully sung revival of the 1968 revue, presented with affectionate nostalgia by the director Gordon Greenberg. As in the original, two men (Robert Cuccioli and Rodney Hicks) and two women (Natascia Diaz and Gay Marshall) perform a wide selection of Brel's plaintive ballads and stirring anthems. Ms. Marshall's captivating performance of ''Ne Me Quitte Pas,'' sung in the original French and with heart-stirring transparency, represents Brel at his best (2:00). Zipper Theater, 336 West 37th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Isherwood) 'MARATHON 2006' David Ives's haunting suspense tale ''The Other Woman'' highlights the first batch of short plays in the Ensemble Studio Theater's annual marathon of one-acts. A master of the comic short play, Mr. Ives channels his inner Rod Serling here, creating an eerie theatrical nocturne starring Ruthie Henshall and Scott Cohen, and directed with delicacy by Walter Bobbie. Two other fine two-handers, by Amy Fox and Anton Dudley, are also on the bill (2:00). Ensemble Studio Theater, 549 West 52nd Street, Clinton, (212) 352-3101.(Isherwood) 'NO CHILD' Teachers will love Nilaja Sun's one-woman show about the challenges of teaching drama at Malcolm X High School (1:10). Beckett Theater at Theater Row, 410 West 42nd Street, Clinton, (212) 279-4200. (Gates) 'NOT A GENUINE BLACK MAN' Brian Copeland's solo memoir about his African-American family moving into a white suburb in the early 1970's is an engaging, if stiltedly performed, show (1:30). DR2 Theater, 103 East 15th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Zinoman) 'RED LIGHT WINTER' A frank, occasionally graphic story of erotic fixation and the havoc it can wreak on sensitive types. Written and directed by Adam Rapp, this play is both a doomy romantic drama and a morbid comedy about the anxieties of male friendship. Although somewhat contrived, it features a lovely performance by Christopher Denham as a lonely soul starved for intimacy (2:25). Barrow Street Theater, 27 Barrow Street, West Village, (212) 239-6200. (Isherwood) * 'STUFF HAPPENS' Daniel Sullivan's sharp, invigorating production of David Hare's journalistic drama about the road to war in Iraq is conducted on the modest scale of a town-hall meeting. The characters (who have names like Bush and Blair) seem less like destiny-shaping gods than the ego trippers in your office. If that means they're too close for comfort, then ''Stuff Happens'' is doing its job (2:50). The Public Theater, 425 Lafayette Street, at Astor Place, East Village, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley) 'TROUT STANLEY' Claudia Dey's hysterically funny, deliciously lyrical piece of Canadian Gothic is about strange 30-year-old twin sisters and the mysterious man who arrives, D. H. Lawrence style, to upset the household's delicate balance (1:50). Culture Project, 45 Bleecker Street, at Lafayette Street, East Village, (212) 868-4444. (Gates) 'TRYST' A suspense drama of a distinctly old-fashioned stamp about the romance between a handsome cad (Maxwell Caulfield) and a lonely spinster (Amelia Campbell). Will the wily predator seduce and abandon the mousy milliner? Karoline Leach's play springs a few twists that lack psychological credibility but keep the plot on the boil (2:00). Promenade Theater, 2162 Broadway, at 76th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Isherwood) Off Off Broadway 'AIN'T SUPPOSED TO DIE A NATURAL DEATH' Melvin Van Peebles's 1971 Tony-nominated musical, ''Ain't Supposed to Die a Natural Death,'' isn't so much performed at the club T New York, as erupted, like some sort of streetwise lava flow. This early precursor to hip-hop, rap and poetry slams is a get-down, roiling depiction of ghetto life, and we're not talking urbane bling (1:30) T New York, 240 West 52nd Street, (212) 352-3101. (Phoebe Hoban) 'HAM LAKE' A gregarious 20-something man reveals more than he intends to in this 80-minute seriocomic barroom monologue by Sam Rosen and Nat Bennett. Mr. Rosen is a wry and skilled earbender. Huron Club at the SoHo Playhouse, 15 Vandam Street, South Village, (212) 691-1555. (Hunka) 'HERAKLES VIA PHAEDRA' Making her annual excursion into Greek myth and history, Ellen Stewart presents the labors of Herakles and the tragedies of Theseus with an exhilarating, rough-hewn mix of flamenco, wildly beautiful puppets, acrobatic combat between men and magical beasts and a classical South Indian dance performed with a live snake (1:30). La MaMa E.T.C. Annex, 66 East Fourth Street, East Village, (212) 475-7710. (Miriam Horn) Long-Running Shows * 'ALTAR BOYZ' This sweetly satirical show about a Christian pop group made up of five potential Teen People cover boys is an enjoyable, silly diversion (1:30). New World Stages, 340 West 50th Street, Clinton, (212) 239-6200.(Isherwood) 'AVENUE Q' R-rated puppets give lively life lessons (2:10). Golden, 252 West 45th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley) 'BEAUTY AND THE BEAST' Cartoon made flesh, sort of (2:30). Lunt-Fontanne Theater, 205 West 46th Street, (212) 307-4747. (Brantley) 'CHICAGO' Irrefutable proof that crime pays (2:25). Ambassador Theater, 219 West 49th Street, (212) 239-6200.(Brantley) 'DOUBT, A PARABLE' (Pulitzer Prize, Best Play 2005, and Tony Award, Best Play 2005) John Patrick Shanley makes subversive use of musty conventions in the clash between the head of a parochial school and the young priest who may or may not be too fond of the boys in his charge (1:30). Walter Kerr Theater, 219 West 48th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley) 'HAIRSPRAY' Fizzy pop, cute kids, large man in a housedress (2:30). Neil Simon Theater, 250 West 52nd Street, (212) 307-4100. (Brantley) 'THE LION KING' Disney on safari, where the big bucks roam (2:45). New Amsterdam Theater, 214 West 42nd Street, (212) 307-4100. (Brantley) 'MAMMA MIA!' The jukebox that devoured Broadway (2:20). Cadillac Winter Garden Theater, 1634 Broadway, at 50th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley) 'THE PHANTOM OF THE OPERA' Who was that masked man, anyway? (2:30). Majestic Theater, 247 West 44th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley) 'THE PRODUCERS' The ne plus ultra of showbiz scams (2:45). St. James Theater, 246 West 44th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley) 'RENT' East Village angst and love songs to die for (2:45). Nederlander Theater, 208 West 41st Street, (212) 307-4100. (Brantley) 'SPAMALOT' (Tony Award, Best Musical 2005) This staged re-creation of the mock-medieval movie ''Monty Python and the Holy Grail'' is basically a singing scrapbook for Python fans. Such a good time is being had by so many people that this fitful, eager celebration of inanity and irreverence has found a large and lucrative audience (2:20). Shubert Theater, 225 West 44th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley) 'WICKED' Oz revisited, with political corrections (2:45). Gershwin Theater, 222 West 51st Street, (212) 307-4100. (Brantley) Last Chance 'DEFIANCE' The second in John Patrick Shanley's cycle of morality plays that began with ''Doubt,'' this ambitious tale of racial relations and the military mindset on a North Carolina marine base feels both overcrowded and oddly diffuse. If ''Doubt'' has an elegant and energy-efficient sprinter's gait, ''Defiance'' progresses with a flustered air of distraction. The excellent Margaret Colin, as an officer's wife, provides a welcome shot of credibility (1:30). Manhattan Theater Club, Theater 1, 131 West 55th Street, (212) 581-1212; closing on Sunday. (Brantley) 'I WILL COME LIKE A THIEF' The writer Trish Harnetiaux and the director Jude Domski have together created the potent outline of a parable about passive if still jittery Americans awash in government gobbledygook after 9/11 and Hurricane Katrina. But there is a staginess to their random characters that is hard to overcome, and ultimately the play, set in an American city being evacuated, does not live up to its promise (1:15). The 78th Street Theater Lab, 236 West 78th Street, (212) 868-4444; closing on Sunday. (Andrea Stevens) 'THE ODD COUPLE' Odd is not the word for this couple. How could an adjective suggesting strangeness or surprise apply to a production so calculatedly devoted to the known, the cozy, the conventional? As the title characters in Neil Simon's 1965 comedy, directed as if to a metronome by Joe Mantello, Nathan Lane and Matthew Broderick reprise their star performances from ''The Producers,'' and it's not a natural fit. Don't even consider killing yourself because the show is already sold out (2:10). Brooks Atkinson Theater, 256 West 47th Street, (212) 307-4100; closing on Sunday. (Brantley) 'THE RACE' Impending fatherhood stuns a man almost speechless in this brisk trot through nine months of anxiety. Performed by the London-based troupe Gecko, ''The Race'' is a hybrid of theater and dance, and lasts just an hour. Occasionally the inventive imagery stalls, and the show seems to run out of imaginative breath, but it provides enough small-scale wizardry to please fans of physical theater (1:00). 59E59 Theaters, 59 East 59th Street, (212) 279-4200; closing on Sunday.

'AKEELAH AND THE BEE' (PG, 112 minutes) Eleven-year-old Akeelah Anderson (Keke Palmer) is a bright but unmotivated girl who can outspell anyone at her South Los Angeles middle school. When Akeelah gets a taste of victory by winning the school bee, she throws herself into studying for the regional one, coached by a stern English professor named Joshua Larabee (Laurence Fishburne). But Akeelah's mother (Angela Bassett) objects to her daughter's obsession with what she considers a ''game.'' The innate suspense and charm of the spelling bee, along with a trio of crack performances, turn what is, in essence, a formulaic picture into something more satisfying: an underdog tale that manages to inspire without being sappy. (Dana Stevens) * 'AN INCONVENIENT TRUTH' (PG, 96 minutes) Al Gore gives a lecture on climate change. One of the most exciting and essential movies of the year. Seriously. (A. O. Scott) * 'ARMY OF SHADOWS' (No rating, 140 minutes, in French) Dark as pitch and without compromise, Jean-Pierre Melville's 1969 masterpiece centers on the feats of a small band of Resistance fighters operating during the occupation. Brilliant, harrowing, essential viewing. (Manohla Dargis) 'ART SCHOOL CONFIDENTIAL' (R, 102 minutes) A lump of misanthropy from Terry Zwigoff and Daniel Clowes, who made the sublime ''Ghost World.'' This time they plod through a grouchy attack on -- and example of -- the pretense and hypocrisy of self-declared artists. John Malkovich's performance as a drawing instructor is sly and insightful, a glimpse at what the movie might have been. (Scott) * 'CAVITE' (No rating, 80 minutes, in English and Tagalog) Terrorism and cultural identity are only two of the themes wound into a tight knot of fear and bewilderment in ''Cavite,'' a gripping, no-budget political thriller shot on the fly with handheld cameras that scour the teeming streets and squatter shacks of Cavite, a city on the outskirts of Manila. (Stephen Holden) * 'CLEAN' (R, 110 minutes) This fine French movie, written and directed by Olivier Assayas, is one of the few fictional films to evoke realistically the grubby texture of existence for second- and third-tier rock celebrities crumbling under a combination of fading renown and drug addiction. Maggie Cheung and Nick Nolte offer memorable portrayals as a recovering junkie and her compassionate father-in-law. (Holden) 'THE DA VINCI CODE' (PG-13, 148 minutes) Theology aside, ''The Da Vinci Code'' is, above all, a murder mystery. And as such, once it gets going, Ron Howard's movie has its pleasures. He and the screenwriter Akiva Goldsman have deftly rearranged some elements of the plot, unkinking a few overelaborate twists and introducing others that keep the action moving along. The movie does, however, take a while to accelerate, popping the clutch and leaving rubber on the road as it tries to establish who is who, what he's doing and why. So I certainly can't support any calls for boycotting or protesting this busy, trivial, inoffensive film. Which is not to say that I'm recommending that you go see it. (Scott) * 'DOWN IN THE VALLEY' (R, 114 minutes) This allegorical neo-Western set in the San Fernando Valley has dreams as big as the fantasies that consume its protagonist, a Stetson-wearing suburban cowboy (Edward Norton) who is not what he appears to be. How much you like it will depend on your appetite for the kind of cultural metaphors that David Jacobson flings onto the screen with a reckless abandon. (Holden) * 'INSIDE MAN' (R, 128 minutes) The latest from Spike Lee takes a familiar setup -- a Wall Street bank heist that mutates into a hostage crisis -- and twists it ever so slightly and nicely. Among the film's most sustained pleasures are its holy trinity -- Denzel Washington, Clive Owen and Jodie Foster -- and the best lineup of pusses and mugs outside ''The Sopranos.'' (Dargis) 'THE KING' (R, 105 minutes) James Marsh employs both clichés and some lived-in emotions and atmosphere for his fitfully engaging, exasperating film about a young Mexican-American (Gael García Bernal) whose search for his patrimony leads him into the bosom of a deeply religious Texas family (headed by a very fine William Hurt). (Dargis) * 'LA MOUSTACHE' (No rating, 86 minutes, in French) Emmanuel Carrière's psychological mystery prepares you to bask in one of those sexy, bittersweet marital comedies that are a hallmark of sophisticated French cinema. Then, by degrees, it subverts those expectations to spiral down a rabbit hole of ambiguity and doubt. (Holden) * 'L'ENFANT (THE CHILD)' (R, 100 minutes, in French) The latest from the Belgian brothers Jean-Pierre and Luc Dardenne involves a young thief (Jérémie Renier) who one day sells his newborn son for a fat envelope of cash. What interests the Dardennes is not only how a man would sell a child as casually as a slab of beef, but also whether a man like this, having committed such a repellent offense, can find redemption. (Dargis) 'MISSION: IMPOSSIBLE III' (PG-13, 126 minutes) Er, this time it's personal, as Tom Cruise plays a dashing operative for a clandestine organization who sweeps a simpering brunette off her feet. Directed, without much flair, by J. J. Abrams, the small-screen auteur behind ''Lost'' and ''Alias.'' (Dargis) 'OVER THE HEDGE' (PG, 83 minutes) This tale about some woodland critters threatened by their new human neighbors has the technical trappings of a worthwhile Saturday matinee, so it's too bad no one paid commensurate attention to the script. The writers, including Karey Kirkpatrick, who directed with Tim Johnson, pad the story with the usual yuks and some glop about family, but there is no poetry here and little thought. (Dargis) 'POSEIDON' (PG-13, 100 minutes) Wolfgang Petersen's ''Poseidon'' is unlikely to replace the original in the hearts of action-hungry moviegoers, though it will probably expunge the memory of the earlier, made-for-TV remake (and also, perhaps, of the 1979 sequel, ''Beyond the Poseidon Adventure''). The hard-working cast does a lot of screaming, climbing and death-defying in soaking-wet evening wear, but they can hardly hope to match the ripe absurdity of Shelley Winters, Red Buttons, Gene Hackman and Ernest Borgnine. (Scott) 'THE PROMISE' (PG-13, 103 minutes, in Mandarin) A lavish spectacle -- somewhere between grand opera and cartoon -- from Chen Kaige, about a love triangle involving a general, a slave and a cursed princess. Sometimes breathtaking, sometimes out of breath. (Scott) 'SEE NO EVIL' (R, 84 minutes) In ''See No Evil'' the professional wrestler Glen Jacobs (a k a Kane) plays a lumbering psychopath intent on butchering the juvenile delinquents on cleanup duty at the hotel where he's holed up. Propelled by an inebriated camera that careers off walls and, at one point, roots around in an empty eye socket, the movie soon devolves into a bloodily creative string of mutilations and impalings. (Jeannette Catsoulis) * 'STICK IT' (PG-13, 103 minutes) Somersaulting through happy clichés and unexpected invention, this spry teenage comedy gets everything right. (Nathan Lee) * 'THREE TIMES' (No rating, 135 minutes, in Mandarin and Taiwanese dialect) For this hypnotically beautiful cinematic trilogy, the Taiwanese director Hou Hsiao-hsien, one of the modern masters of the art, brings us love and loss in three different time periods. (Dargis) * '12 AND HOLDING' (R, 94 minutes) This poignant, beautifully acted film, directed by Michael Cuesta (''L.I.E.''), flashes a laser beam on the moment between childhood and adolescence, when unguarded emotions and fantasies still rule, but adult experience beckons. (Holden) 'UNITED 93' (R, 115 minutes) A scrupulously tasteful Hollywood re-creation of the downing of the fourth plane hijacked by Muslim terrorists on Sept. 11 and easily the feel-bad American movie of the year. Written and directed by Paul Greengrass, whose earlier films include ''Bloody Sunday.'' (Dargis) * 'WATER' (PG-13, 114 minutes, in Hindi) Set in India in 1938, ''Water'' focuses on a group of widows condemned by Hindu law to live in an institution on the banks of the River Ganges. The arrival of a high-spirited 8-year-old girl encourages one widow to question her faith and another to begin a love affair with a Gandhian idealist. Bobbing back and forth between romantic melodrama and spiritual inquiry, ''Water'' is an exquisitely beautiful film about the institutionalized oppression of an entire class of women. (Catsoulis) 'X-MEN: THE LAST STAND' (PG-13, 104 minutes) As expected, the third and presumably last film about the powerful Marvel Comics mutants who walk and often fight among us pretty much looks and plays like the first two, though perhaps with more noise and babes, and a little less glum. The credited writers here are Simon Kinberg and Zak Penn, who, like the director Brett Ratner, are not mutant enough to fly. (Dargis) Film Series ROBERT ALTMAN (Through Thursday) The Museum of the Moving Image's 22-film retrospective of Mr. Altman's work concludes on Thursday with a screening of his newest ensemble comedy, ''A Prairie Home Companion,'' followed by a discussion with Mr. Altman. Directors Guild Theater, 110 West 57th Street, Manhattan, (718) 784-4520; $24. (Anita Gates) B-NOIR (Through June 15) Film Forum's six-week festival of 70 low-budget American thrillers from the 1940's and 50's continues this weekend with two double features. Today and Saturday, the features are ''Thieves' Highway'' (1949), about a truck driver avenging an attack on his father, and ''The Sleeping City'' (1950), about a shooting at Bellevue Hospital. The double feature for Sunday and Monday is ''Side Street'' (1949), the story of a struggling postal employee who steals $30,000, and ''Mystery Street'' (1950), which revolves around a skeleton on a Massachusetts beach. 209 West Houston Street, west of Avenue of the Americas, South Village, (212) 727-8110; $10. (Gates) BROOKLYN INTERNATIONAL FILM FESTIVAL (Through June 11) This ninth annual festival opens tonight at the Brooklyn Museum with Libero De Rienzo's ''Blood, Death Does Not Exist'' (2005), a day in the life of an aspiring ballerina and her overdependent, drug-dealing brother. Cantor Auditorium, 200 Eastern Parkway, at Washington Avenue, (718) 388-4306; $10. (Gates) OPEN ROADS: NEW ITALIAN CINEMA (Through June 9) This weekend the Film Society of Lincoln Center's tribute to contemporary Italian filmmakers includes Massimo Andrei's debut feature, ''Mater Natura'' (2005), the story of a Neapolitan transsexual in love with a car-wash owner; Giacomo Martelli's espionage thriller ''The Listening'' (2006), about eavesdropping technology; and Carlo Verdone's comedy ''My Best Enemy'' (2006), about a man who has it all and messes it up. Walter Reade Theater, 165 West 65th Street, Lincoln Center, (212) 875-5600; $10. (Gates) TOMORROWLAND: CAL ARTS IN MOVING PICTURES (Through Aug. 13) The Museum of Modern Art is sponsoring a three-decade survey of films and videos by former students at the California Institute of the Arts. Tomorrow night's program, ''The (Post) Studio Artists'' is a collection of six 1970's shorts, including Chris Langdon and Fred Worden's ''Now, You Can Do Anything,'' set on a Malibu beach. On Wednesday night the program is student films whose creators went on to make their reputations at Pixar. Roy and Niuta Titus Theaters, (212) 708-9400; $10. (Gates) TO SAVE AND PROJECT: THE FOURTH MOMA INTERNATIONAL FESTIVAL OF FILM PRESERVATION (Through June 21) This monthlong program of preserved and restored films continues at the Museum of Modern Art. This weekend's features include a Dutch silent, ''The Living Ladder'' (1913), about acrobats, a burning windmill and a damsel in distress; and Fritz Lang's German Expressionist masterpiece ''M'' (1931), starring Peter Lorre as a serial killer. Roy and Niuta Titus Theaters, (212) 708-9400; $10. (Gates) THE VISION THAT CHANGED CINEMA: MICHELANGELO ANTONIONI (Through June 29) BAMcinématek's tribute to Antonioni begins on Wednesday with a weeklong run of his biggest commercial success, ''Blow-Up'' (1966). Vanessa Redgrave and David Hemmings star in the film, set squarely in swinging 60's London (the music! the fashions!), which tells the story of a fashion photographer who might have accidentally documented a murder. BAM Rose Cinemas, 30 Lafayette Avenue, at Ashland Place, Fort Greene, Brooklyn, (718) 636-4100; $10. (Gates) Pop Full reviews of recent concerts: nytimes.com/music. AVION TRAVEL (Tomorrow) The breezily romantic band Avion Travel is one of the jewels of the Italian music scene, playing a sophisticated mixture of French-Italian cabaret and Brazilian baião; the group stunned Italy six years ago by winning at Sanremo, a big pop festival not known for its sophisticated tastes. At 7:30 p.m., Joe's Pub at the Public Theater, 425 Lafayette Street, at Astor Place, East Village, (212) 239-6200; $15. (Ben Sisario) BARDO POND (Thursday) Bardo Pond, from Philadelphia, specializes in heavy, cyclical songs, letting big, dusty guitar riffs come round again and again. With Holy Ghost and the Winter Pageant. At 8:30 p.m., Mercury Lounge, 217 East Houston Street, at Ludlow Street, Lower East Side, (212) 260-4700; $10 in advance, $12 at the door. (Kelefa Sanneh) BOUNCING SOULS (Tonight through Tuesday) The punk kings of New Jersey, Bouncing Souls have been going strong for nearly two decades, with no signs of slowing down: their new album, ''The Gold Record'' (Epitaph), is chock-full of adrenalized ''Hey! Hey! Hey!'' shout-alongs. They finish up a sold-out run at the Knitting Factory with lots of guests: Blanks 77 (tonight), Paint It Black (tomorrow), Sticks and Stones (Sunday), the Slackers (Monday) and the Explosion (Tuesday). At 6:30 p.m., 74 Leonard Street, TriBeCa, (212) 219-3006. (Sisario) JAMES BROWN (Thursday) He is the godfather of much more than soul: as the chief architect of funk, James Brown is one of the most influential figures in popular music since Louis Armstrong. He's a great dancer, too. At 8 p.m., B. B. King Blues Club and Grill, 237 West 42nd Street, Manhattan, (212) 997-4144; $80 in advance, $85 at the door. (Sisario) ROY CARRIER AND THE NITE ROCKERS (Tomorrow) Mr. Carrier, an old-fashioned zydeco accordionist, takes a break from his club in Lawtell, La., to lead his band for a Southern Louisiana dance party in Times Square. At 8:30 p.m., with a free zydeco dance lesson at 7:30, Connolly's, 121 West 45th Street, Manhattan, (212) 685-7597; $22. (Sisario) COCOROSIE (Tonight) As CocoRosie, the Casady sisters, Sierra and Bianca, make a swirling psychodrama out of girlish daydreams, hints of trip-hop, chirping crickets and cooed Billie Holiday-ish vocals. With Spleen and Nomi. At 8 p.m., Bowery Ballroom, 6 Delancey Street, near the Bowery, Lower East Side, (212) 533-2111; $15. (Sisario) DICK DALE (Sunday) Dick Dale, king of the surf guitar, provides no polite nostalgia trip to the mid-1960's. He's out to summon elemental forces with the stomping beat of his band and his heavily reverbed, brusquely attacked guitar lines, along with the dive-bombing, tremolo glissandos that literally melt his guitar picks from the heat of their friction on the strings. At 8 p.m., CBGB, 315 Bowery, at Bleecker Street, East Village, (212) 982-4052; $20 in advance, $25 at the door. (Jon Pareles) DAVID (HONEYBOY) EDWARDS, ROBERT LOCKWOOD JR. (Wednesday) These veteran Delta bluesmen, both born in 1915, boast close connections to the fabled Robert Johnson: Mr. Edwards played with him in the 1930's, and Mr. Lockwood learned some of his songs directly from the master. At 8 p.m., B. B. King Blues Club and Grill, 237 West 42nd Street, (212) 997-4144; $25. (Sisario) THE FABULOUS SOUL SHAKERS (Tonight) Sort of an oldies Backstreet Boys, the Fabulous Soul Shakers are five talented young men -- each has won or been a finalist at Apollo Theater showcases -- assembled to perform letter-perfect renditions of doo-wop and soul from the 1950's and 60's. At 8:30, Magnetic Field, 97 Atlantic Avenue, between Henry and Hicks Streets, Brooklyn Heights, (718) 834-0069; $10. (Sisario) * THE FALL (Tonight) Nearly 30 years ago, with jagged, jabby guitars and the tuneless slur of its leader and propagandist, Mark E. Smith, this British band laid out a reductionist ''three R's'' of pop: ''Repetition, repetition, repetition.'' Umpteen albums later, the Fall is a cornerstone of postpunk, and Mr. Smith still finds ways to make repetition sound new. With the Cairo Gang. At 9 p.m., Southpaw, 125 Fifth Avenue, near Sterling Place, Park Slope, Brooklyn, (718) 230-0236; sold out. (Sisario) * HOT 97 SUMMER JAM (Sunday) The annual mega-concerts presented by the radio station Hot 97 (WQHT-FM) are always among the biggest live hip-hop events in the country, a status derived as much from the long roster of stars as from the sparks that sometimes fly among them. This year features Mary J. Blige, Jamie Foxx, Busta Rhymes, Sean Paul, Three 6 Mafia, Chris Brown, T. I., Ne-Yo, Jermaine Dupri and Dem Franchize Boyz. At 7 p.m., Giants Stadium, East Rutherford, N.J., (201) 935-3900; $35 to $160. (Sisario) MASON JENNINGS, TEDDY THOMPSON (Thursday) Heavy-lidded confessions by young men holding acoustic guitars can sometimes go the way of empty bromides, as they do in the songs of Mason Jennings (''Be here now/No other place to be''). Teddy Thompson fares better: the son of the great British folk-pop singers Richard and Linda Thompson, he absorbed some of his parents' pithy melancholy, an attitude that leaves room for some smirks: ''This is a party,'' Mr. Thompson groans, ''no frowns allowed.'' At 6:30 p.m., Webster Hall, 125 East 11th Street, East Village, (212) 533-2111; $20. (Sisario) JOAN JETT (Monday through Thursday) Joan Jett has been expertly playing the tough-chick-with-a-guitar role longer than many of her younger imitators have been alive. Promoting a new album, ''Sinner'' (Blackheart Records), she makes a sweep through the clubs of New York. Monday at 8 p.m., Bowery Ballroom, 6 Delancey Street, near the Bowery, Lower East Side, (212) 533-2111; $20. Tuesday at 8 p.m., Southpaw, 125 Fifth Avenue, near Sterling Place, Park Slope, Brooklyn, (718) 230-0236; $20. Wednesday at 8 p.m., CBGB, 315 Bowery, at Bleecker Street, East Village, (212) 982-4052; sold out. Thursday at 9 p.m., Northsix, 66 North Sixth Street, Williamsburg, Brooklyn, (718) 599-5103; $20. (Sisario) LITTLE RICHARD (Tomorrow) He may always be most celebrated for bringing scat to rock (''A-wop-bop-a-loo-bop, a-lop-bam-boom!''), but Little Richard's delirious falsetto ''oooh!'' and androgynous showmanship have influenced everybody from Paul McCartney to Prince. At 8 p.m., Apollo Theater, 253 West 125th Street, Harlem, (212) 531-5305 or (212) 307-7171; $47 and $57. (Sisario) LONGWAVE (Tonight) This New York band ponders self-destruction and transcendence in brooding songs with guitar lines that coil and climb. With Pela and English Department. At 9, Northsix, 66 North Sixth Street, Williamsburg, Brooklyn, (718) 599-5103; $10 in advance, $12 at the door. (Pareles) * NELLIE McKAY (Sunday) On nights off from ''The Threepenny Opera'' on Broadway, Ms. McKay, a songwriting sprite whom it is impossible to get tired of, is playing a series of late-night shows at Joe's Pub. These are rare chances to hear the songs from her excellent second album, ''Pretty Little Head,'' which has been in music purgatory since Ms. McKay was dropped by Columbia late last year. At 11:30 p.m., the Public Theater, 425 Lafayette Street, at Astor Place, East Village, (212) 239-6200; $20. (Sisario) PEARL JAM (Tomorrow) Sounding limber and energized on its new, self-titled album -- oh why did it take Pearl Jam so long to find those thunderbolt AC/DC riffs? -- the alt-rock road warriors head out once again. With My Morning Jacket, a band from Louisville, Ky., with a calm and entrancing take on Southern rock. At 7:30 p.m., Continental Airlines Arena, East Rutherford, N.J., (212) 307-7171; sold out. (Sisario) PEARLS AND BRASS (Wednesday) And on a certain beer-buzzed day (whose ordinal number is forgotten), Deep Purple, the James Gang and early Black Sabbath created fuzzy, head-nodding biker metal, and it was good. Many begats later, Pearls and Brass, from Nazareth, Pa., worships studiously at their altar. With Nudity and Endless Boogie. At 9 p.m., Union Pool, 484 Union Avenue, at Meeker Avenue, Williamsburg, Brooklyn, (718) 609-0484; $7. (Sisario) LINDA RONSTADT (Tonight) Ms. Ronstadt's pleasurable, circuitous route through pop, having already covered everything from Queen's ''We Will Rock You'' to mariachi, next turns, on her coming album ''Adieu False Heart'' (Vanguard), to ''Walk Away Renee,'' the Left Banke's 1966 nugget of baroque psychedelia, as well as songs by Richard Thompson, Julie Miller and Bill Monroe. At 8, Beacon Theater, 2124 Broadway, at 74th Street, (212) 496-7070 or (212) 307-7171; $33.50 to $128.50. (Sisario) SOUTHERN CULTURE ON THE SKIDS (Wednesday) This long-running three-piece from North Carolina knows just how much to poke fun at chicken-fried, backwoods rockabilly: a lot, but not too much to get in the way of some finger-licking twangy guitar. Don't let the band leave without playing its barnstorming ode to Santo, the vigilante Mexican wrestler. With the Demolition String Band. At 9 p.m., Mercury Lounge, 217 East Houston Street, at Ludlow Street, Lower East Side, (212) 260-4700; $15. (Sisario) THE STILLS (Tonight) On its debut album three years ago, this Montreal band took the sulking guitar minimalism of New York groups like Interpol and the Strokes and sublimated it into a shimmering, majestic gloom that recalled the glories of U2 and Echo and the Bunnymen. Its new album, ''Without Feathers'' (Vice), perplexingly slows things down to a bored crawl. With Rogue Wave. At 10 p.m., Maxwell's, 1039 Washington Street, Hoboken, N.J., (201) 798-0406; sold out. (Sisario) * SUPER FURRY ANIMALS (Tonight) The Welsh band Super Furry Animals plays wonderfully overwrought pop, cramming together Beach Boys' melodies, zooming space-rock, noisy punk and some penitent country. This show, with Dead Meadow as the opening act, begins the modest but essential summer series at the South Street Seaport, as part of the River to River Festival. At 7 p.m., Pier 17, Fulton and South Streets, Lower Manhattan, (212) 835-2789; free. (Sisario) * TAPES 'N TAPES (Sunday and Tuesday) A few months ago this Minneapolis band, playing dry, indie-pop rhapsodies recalling Pavement and the early Pixies, was little known. Then came a big Internet buzz courtesy of bloggers and the tastemaking Web site Pitchfork. But the group also found success in a comfortingly old-fashioned way, by blowing everybody away at the South by Southwest festival in March; within a month the group had a deal with XL Recordings and a busy tour schedule, including these two sold-out dates. With Figurines and Cold War Kids. At 7:30 p.m., Bowery Ballroom, 6 Delancey Street, near the Bowery, Lower East Side, (212) 533-2111. (Sisario) MARY TIMONY (Tonight) Mary Timony, who led the band Helium, has kept her tightly wound guitar riffs but has gradually left behind the personality crises of indie-rock to ponder higher thoughts and cosmic forces. With Tralala, Human Television and Tiny Amps. At 8:30, Mercury Lounge, 217 East Houston Street, at Ludlow Street, Lower East Side, (212) 260-4700; $10. (Pareles) WOLFMOTHER (Tomorrow) The retro-rock wayback machine makes two stops in the music of this Australian band: to the screamy abandon of mid-1960's garage rock (the fingernails-on-blackboard yelp at the beginning of the band's debut album will bring a smile to any fan of the Sonics, who sang ''Psycho'' and other garage classics), and then forward just a few years to the amp-throbbing, proto-metal bacchanals of Blue Cheer and Black Sabbath. With Deadboy and the Elephantmen. At 6:30 p.m., Webster Hall, 125 East 11th Street, East Village, (212) 533-2111; sold out. (Sisario) Cabaret Full reviews of recent cabaret shows: nytimes.com/music. BARBARA CARROLL (Sunday) Even when swinging out, this Lady of a Thousand Songs remains an impressionist with special affinities for Thelonious Monk and bossa nova. At 2 p.m., the Algonquin Hotel, Oak Room, 59 West 44th Street, Manhattan, (212) 419-9331; $58, including brunch at noon. (Stephen Holden) BLOSSOM DEARIE (Tomorrow and Sunday) To watch this singer and pianist is to appreciate the power of a carefully deployed pop-jazz minimalism combined with a highly discriminating taste in songs. The songs date from all periods of a career remarkable for its longevity and for Ms. Dearie's stubborn independence and sly wit. Tomorrow at 7 p.m., Sunday at 6:15 p.m., Danny's Skylight Room, 346 West 46th Street, Clinton, (212) 265-8133; $25, with a $15 minimum, or $54.50 for a dinner-and-show package. (Holden) * MARIA FRIEDMAN (Tonight and tomorrow night) This British theater star commands a flexible, pitch-perfect soprano as pure as spring water. In her new show of Sondheim songs her dramatic instincts match her singing in subtlety, taste and insight. At 8:45 and 10:45, Café Carlyle, Carlyle Hotel, 35 East 76th Street, Manhattan, (212) 744-1600; $75. (Holden) ANDREA MARCOVICCI (Tonight and tomorrow, and Tuesday through Thursday) Ms. Marcovicci's new show, ''Just Love by Request'' is a kind of living room musicale that's one-half pre-set and one-half determined by audience suggestions. The singer's charm rules this unruly format. At 9 p.m., with additional shows tonight and tomorrow night at 11:30, the Algonquin Hotel, Oak Room, 59 West 44th Street, Manhattan, (212) 419-9331; $60 cover Tuesday through Thursday, $65 tonight and tomorrow; $60 prix fixe dinner required for 9 p.m. shows; otherwise, a $20 minimum. (Holden) ANNIE ROSS (Wednesday) Cool, funny, swinging and indestructible, this 75-year-old singer and sometime actress exemplifies old-time hip in its most generous incarnation. At 9:15 p.m., Danny's Skylight Room, 346 West 46th Street, Clinton, (212) 265-8133; $25, with a $12 minimum. (Holden) Jazz Full reviews of recent jazz concerts: nytimes.com/music. J .D.

At 6 p.m., 55 Bar, 55 Christopher Street, West Village, (212) 929-9883; no cover. (Chinen) JOE LOCKE-GEOFFREY KEEZER QUARTET (Tuesday through June 11) Precision, intuition and flash are all musical traits shared by Mr. Locke, a vibraphonist, and Mr. Keezer, a pianist and keyboardist. The same could be said of the bassist Reuben Rogers and the drummer Terreon Gully, who round out this ensemble.

(Chinen) KURT ROSENWINKEL GROUP (Through Sunday) Mr. Rosenwinkel's guitar has a luminous tone that offsets the cerebral tinge of his compositions, and his rapport with the tenor saxophonist Mark Turner borders on the telepathic. This ensemble, which also features the pianist Aaron Goldberg, the bassist Joe Martin and the drummer Eric Harland, imbues its performances with a blend of shadowy introspection and combustible interplay. At 8 and 10 p.m., Iridium, 1650 Broadway, at 51st Street, (212) 582-2121; cover, $30, with a $10 minimum. (Chinen) DIANE SCHUUR AND SARA GAZAREK (Tuesday through June 11) Among jazz singers, Ms. Schuur is a survivor and a study in perseverance, if not exactly a musical role model.

(Anne Midgette) 'FAUST' (Tonight through Sunday) The diminutive Amato Opera winds up its season with a brand-new production of Gounod's chestnut, with its usual rotating casts and exuberant conducting from the company's founder, Tony Amato. Tonight and tomorrow night at 7:30, Sunday afternoon at 2:30, Amato Opera, 319 Bowery, at Second Street, East Village, (212) 228-8200; $30; $25 for students and 65+. (Midgette) 'MÉDÉE' (Tomorrow) Many opera connoisseurs consider Cherubini's ''Médée'' from 1797 an elegant masterpiece, especially in its original French version. Beethoven ranked his Italian-born contemporary Cherubini as the greatest living composer of dramatic music. Still, the score awkwardly blends Cherubini's operatic sensibility with long stretches of spoken dialogue. In a concert performance tomorrow night at Carnegie Hall, Peter Tiboris, the general and artistic director of MidAmerica Productions, will try to give the opera new life by exaggerating its stylistic dichotomy. The roles will be sung in French by a roster of singers, but the spoken dialogue will be delivered in an English translation by the members of the Aquila Theater Company. Irini Tsirakidou will sing the title role. Mr. Tiboris will conduct the Manhattan Philharmonic. At 7:30 p.m., (212) 247-7800; $35 to $89. (Anthony Tommasini) 'PAGLIACCI' (Wednesday and Thursday) Small opera companies are springing up at such a pace that it's getting difficult to tell them apart. The Chelsea Opera is doing its best to stand out by presenting Daniel Rodriguez, who burst onto the classical music and national-anthem scene in 2001 as ''the singing cop,'' in the title role of Leoncavallo's classic. At 8 p.m., St. Peter's Episcopal Church, 346 West 20th Street, Chelsea, (866) 811-4111; $25 at the door; $20 for students and 65+; $5 discount when purchased in advance. (Midgette) Classical Music BARGEMUSIC (Tonight through Sunday, and Thursday) This week and next at Bargemusic, the living-room-size converted coffee barge moored under the Brooklyn Bridge, the fare is drawn from the more intimate side of chamber music. Tonight, Dmitry Rachmanov, a fine pianist, plays an all-Schubert recital, with the ''Moments Musicaux'' (D. 780) and the Sonatas in A minor (D. 784) and D (D. 850). Tomorrow and Sunday Mr. Rachmanov will be joined by the violinist Mark Peskanov and the cellist Colin Carr for more Schubert, including the Sonatina for Violin and Piano (D. 384), the ''Arpeggione'' Sonata and the Piano Trio in B flat (D. 898). And on Thursday the cellist Adrian Daurov plays the first of two concerts devoted to all the Bach Cello Suites, this one including the first four of the six. Tonight, tomorrow and Thursday at 7:30, Sunday at 4 p.m., Fulton Ferry Landing next to the Brooklyn Bridge, Brooklyn, (718) 624-2083; $35; $20 for students.

The Korde work, a premiere, is the 100th score commissioned by the ensemble. At 8 p.m., Merkin Concert Hall, 129 West 67th Street, Manhattan, (212) 501-3330; $20; $10 for students and 65+. (Kozinn) SUMI JO (Tonight) During the early years of this Korean soprano's career, she received some helpful public support from Joan Sutherland, who knows a thing or two about what it takes to be a coloratura soprano. Since making her Metropolitan Opera debut as Gilda in ''Rigoletto,'' Ms. Jo has sung nearly 50 times with the company. But her last appearance was in 2000, and her career has drifted to Europe. A tour celebrating the 20th anniversary of Ms. Jo's professional debut, rather mawkishly titled ''Beautiful Challenge,'' comes to Carnegie Hall tonight, giving New Yorkers a fresh chance to assess the current state of Ms. Jo's artistry in works by Donizetti, Offenbach, Duman Cho and others. Will Crutchfield conducts the Orchestra of St. Luke's. At 8, (212) 247-7800; $30 to $90. (Tommasini) MUSICA SACRA (Monday) The Romantic age is the focus of this well-known chorus's final concert of the season, and not all sacred, at that.

At 8 p.m., Alice Tully Hall, Lincoln Center, (212) 721-6500; $15 to $45. (Holland) 'REWIND' (Thursday) In its New York premiere, ''Rewind'' is less a concert than a continuous visual and sonic experience. The program spans five centuries of music, from Renaissance works to commissioned scores and spontaneously created acoustic and electronic pieces. But the selections will meld into one another, and ambient noise (conversations, crinkling paper) will be digitally sampled and folded into the sound space. The performers will be stationed in various parts of the Orensanz Center for the Arts, adding to the spatial and visual atmosphere. Some fine musicians are taking part, including the violinists Anne Akiko Meyers and Colin Jacobson, along with the Knights, a chamber orchestra, and the conductor Paul Haas, who conceived ''Rewind.'' This may be one concert where coughing not only does not matter but will also become a part of the piece. At 8 p.m., 172 Norfolk Street, Lower East Side, (516) 319-9307; $20 in advance; $25 at the door. (Tommasini) ST. LUKE'S CHAMBER ENSEMBLE (Tomorrow and Sunday) New works often have a moment in the spotlight, at their premieres, and are then filed away. In its ''Second Helpings'' series, the St. Luke's Chamber Ensemble takes another look at some of these.

(Rockwell) * NOCHE FLAMENCA WITH SOLEDAD BARRIO (Wednesday and Thursday) Ms. Barrio is a remarkable dancer, serious and impassioned, and the hit of this winter's Flamenco Gala at City Center. Her Spanish company, founded with her husband, Martín Santangelo, is settling into the intimate Theater 80, through July 30. At 8 p.m., Theater 80, 80 St. Marks Place, (212) 352-3101 or theatermania.com; $45 ($100 for opening night).

(Dunning) * ROD RODGERS DANCE COMPANY (Thursday) Rodgers, who died in 2002, had a distinctive movement and choreographic style, and his dancers have managed to keep it alive through continuing the work of his East Village studio, which will be celebrated in the benefit that opens four-day performance series. (Through June 11.) At 7 p.m. Harry DeJur Playhouse, Henry Street Settlement, 466 Grand Street, Lower East Side, (212) 674-9066 or rodrodgersdance.com; $25; $10 for children under 10. (Dunning) SCHOOL OF AMERICAN BALLET (Tomorrow and Monday) In keeping with its founding principal, the school's 42nd annual workshop performance features two ballets by George Balanchine, ''Square Dance'' and ''Bourrée Fantasque,'' as well as one by Christopher Wheeldon, ''Scènes de Ballet.'' They're students now, but some will go on to greatness. Tomorrow at 2 and 8 p.m., Monday at 7 p.m., Peter Jay Sharp Theater, 155 West 65th Street, Lincoln Center, (212) 769-6600; $35 (both performances tomorrow), $65 (Monday benefit).

(Dunning) THREEWAY (Tonight through Sunday) Chill already. The three women choreographers who form the interestingly named group -- Colleen Dunagan, Erin Mitchell and Sue Hogan -- say the company title simply reflects their desire to form a dance project among Los Angeles, Seattle and New York City. At 8 p.m., Arts at University Settlement, 184 Eldridge Street at Rivington Street, Lower East Side, (209) 602-3216; $15.(Dunning) URBAN BUSH WOMEN (Tomorrow) The company brings its signature mix of powerful, sassy and decidedly female dance to a Brooklyn park for a performance jam inspired by a Yoruba proverb. They weave together repertory, including excerpts from ''Give Your Hands to Struggle'' and the rousing ''Batty Moves,'' with a participatory call and response. The show opens with a dance by local sixth graders. At 6 p.m., Coffey Park, Visitation Place between Dwight and Richards Streets, Red Hook, Brooklyn, (212) 625-3505 or dancinginthestreets.org; free. (Kinetz) NINA WINTHROP AND DANCERS (Thursday) Ms. Winthrop will present her multimedia ''That's Me -- I'm the One Lying Down Over There,'' set to music by Jon Gibson. She has described its inspiration as the tendency of the world to be marked by ''strange shades of joy and sharp fits of ecstasy.'' (Through June 11.)

Full reviews of recent art shows: nytimes.com/art. Museums * American Folk Art Museum: 'WHITE ON WHITE (AND A LITTLE GRAY),' through Sept. 17. The importance of neo-Classicism to early American architecture, silver and fine furniture is not exactly news. This small, beautiful show follows its spread into more personal corners of visual culture: often exquisite, strikingly dimensional white-work bedcovers; luminously grisaille, sometimes wacky marble-dust drawings; and print-work embroidery mourning pictures. 45 West 53rd Street, (212) 265-1040. (Roberta Smith) * BARD GRADUATE CENTER: 'AMERICAN STREAMLINED DESIGN: THE WORLD OF TOMORROW,' through June 11. Streamlining, a particularly American design concept born of our love of speed and admiration for industrial production, peaked in the 1930's and 40's, and is now said to be undergoing a revival. This tribute to it includes more than 180 objects, from boring but useful items like a receipt printer designed by Walter Dorwin Teague in 1946 to a plastic bicycle helmet of flowing teardrop shapes designed by John Larkin in 2000. The show is perhaps too packed with repetitive examples -- do we need to see three similar electric drills? -- but don't let that stop you. There's no shortage of wonderful things to look at here. 18 West 86th Street, (212) 501-3000. (Grace Glueck) * BROOKLYN MUSEUM: 'SYMPHONIC POEM: THE ART OF AMINAH BRENDA LYNN ROBINSON,' through Aug. 13. This prodigious show, by an artist born and still living in Columbus, Ohio, celebrates her heritage in paintings, drawings, sculpture, stitchery, leather work and less classifiable forms of expression. Besides its sheer visual wizardry, using materials like leaves, twigs, bark, buttons and cast-off clothes, her art is compelling in that it ruminates on the history of black migration to, and settlement in, the United States, from early times to the present, in a garrulous, very personal way. 200 Eastern Parkway, at Prospect Park, (718) 638-5000. (Glueck) COOPER-HEWITT NATIONAL DESIGN MUSEUM: 'FREDERIC CHURCH, WINSLOW HOMER AND THOMAS MORAN: TOURISM AND THE AMERICAN LANDSCAPE,' through Oct. 22. It turns out that the Cooper-Hewitt owns thousands of rarely seen paintings, prints and sketches by Church, Homer and Moran. Studies of the countryside, mostly, they revere unspoiled nature and record tourism, a booming industry in 19th-century America. Here they're combined with antique postcards, old Baedekers, stereoscopic photographs, playing cards with pictures of Yellowstone on them and souvenir platters, all to trace the nation's transformation from primeval wilderness to Catskills resort. The show is extremely entertaining.2 East 91st Street, at Fifth Avenue, (212) 849-8400. (Michael Kimmelman) * FRICK COLLECTION: 'VERONESE'S ALLEGORIES: VIRTUE, LOVE AND EXPLORATION IN RENAISSANCE VENICE,' through July 16. Paolo Veronese (1528-88), a superb colorist and one of the most suavely sensuous of Renaissance Venetian painters, used the age-old device of allegory to make abstract concepts visual, often by means of human or mythological figures. In this five-painting show, the first to include all of his large-scale allegories from American collections, high ideals mingle with earthy and sometimes erotic physicality, as in the painting ''Venus and Mars United by Love.'' 1 East 70th Street, (212) 288-0700. (Glueck) JEWISH MUSEUM: 'EVA HESSE: SCULPTURE,' through Sept. 17. Assembled by Elizabeth Sussman, curator at the Whitney Museum of American Art, and Fred Wasserman, a curator at the Jewish Museum, this show focuses on a pivotal Hesse exhibition, ''Chain Polymers,'' at the Fischbach Gallery -- known for promoting Minimalist painters -- in 1968. Arguably a compilation of her best work, it was her first and only solo show of sculpture during her lifetime, and most of the objects in it -- along with some earlier and later pieces -- are here. (An exhibition of her drawings is on view at the Drawing Center.) 1109 Fifth Avenue, at 92nd Street, (212) 423-3200. (Glueck) * METROPOLITAN MUSEUM OF ART: 'ANGLOMANIA: TRADITION AND TRANSGRESSION IN BRITISH FASHION,' through Sept. 4. Ranging from early-18th-century gowns to next season's evening wear, this show crowds 65 extravagantly clad mannequins into the Met's normally serene English period rooms, trying to connect the sartorial innovations of the English dandy, the aggressive tribal attire of punk and the deconstructive impulses of today's British fashion stars. (212) 535-7710. (Smith) * MET: 'GIRODET: ROMANTIC REBEL,' through Aug. 27. Hugely famous in the early 19th century, Girodet dropped down the memory chute. His ''Ossian Receiving the Ghosts of French Heroes,'' painted for Napoleon, is one of the most deranged pictures in art history. It's so unhinged that it's almost lovable, which is otherwise the last word to come to mind for an artist who, in his uptight, smarty-pants mode, could be a bore. But give the show a shot. It's sometimes brilliant, and Girodet's strangeness and fairly repellent character make him at least fascinating to contemplate and heroic in his immoderation. History is full of shifty characters, antique visionaries, cusp figures and half-crazy oddball innovators, later overlooked because they're hard to pigeonhole. Their independent cast of mind is the truest expression of how civilization advances. (See above.) (Kimmelman) * Morgan Library and Museum: 'Masterworks from the Morgan,' through Sept. 10. Almost three years after closing to build an expansion, the Morgan is back and brilliant. What's new: Renzo Piano's splendid four-story glass-and-steel court, a sort of giant solarium with see-through elevators; two good-size second-floor galleries; and a neat little strongbox of an enclosure, called the Cube, for reliquaries and altar vessels, medieval objects made with so much silver and gold that they seem to give off heat. What's not new: almost everything in this exhibition, which fills every gallery with mini-exhibitions of master drawings and musical manuscripts. 225 Madison Avenue, at East 36th Street, (212) 685-0008 or themorgan.org. ( Individual show closings can be checked by telephone or through the Web site.)(Holland Cotter) Museum of Modern Art : 'AGAINST THE GRAIN: CONTEMPORARY ART FROM THE EDWARD R. BROIDA COLLECTION,' through July 10. The latest collection assembled by the Museum of Modern Art bolsters its holdings of art world mavericks like Philip Guston, Jennifer Bartlett, Ken Price and Vija Celmins and includes first-timers like Robert Grosvenor, John Lees and Susana Solano. It also illuminates parts of the untold, or forgotten, stories of the art of the 1970's and 80's: the achievements of painters and sculptors who were not at the forefront of Post-Minimalism, photo appropriation or Neo-Expressionism. Some of their efforts may disappear into storage, but quite a few will shake up the Modern's conception of the complicated course of art since 1970. The Museum of Modern Art, (212) 708-9400. (Smith) Museum of the City of New York: Sherril Schell: 'Unknown Modernist,' through June 13. Though little known today, the photographer Sherril Schell (1877-1964) was critically recognized in the 1930's for his severely formalist photographs of New York architecture. This small exhibition presents 15 examples in which closely cropped views of the Chrysler Building, the Empire State Building, the Brooklyn Bridge and other monuments of Manhattan emphasize compositional order, structure, pattern, light and shadow. Museum of the City of New York, 1220 Fifth Avenue, at 103rd Street, (212) 534-1672. (Ken Johnson) New York Public Library: 'FRENCH BOOK ART/LIVRES D'ARTISTES: ARTISTS AND POETS IN DIALOGUE,' through Aug. 18. Organized with the Bibliothèque Littéraire Jacques Doucet in Paris, this lavish exhibition surveys some of the experimental ferment brought on by the combination of free verse, visionary publishers and the high rate of talent among French artists and poets, especially in the early years of the 20th century. New York Public Library, Fifth Avenue at 42nd Street, (212) 869-8089. (Smith) NOGUCHI MUSEUM: 'BEST OF FRIENDS: BUCKMINSTER FULLER AND ISAMU NOGUCHI,' through Oct. 15. Great, lasting friendships are rare, but friendships that enlarge the spirit through ideas, ideals and new insights are in a class by themselves. Over a stretch of more than 50 years, the sculptor Isamu Noguchi and the visionary designer R. Buckminster Fuller enjoyed such a friendship, which led to aesthetic and practical achievements that left their mark. The course of their varied collaborations is traced in this exhibition, which includes models, sculptures, drawings, photographs and films. 9-01 33rd Road, between Vernon Boulevard and 10th Street, Long Island City, Queens, (718) 204-7088. (Glueck) * The Studio Museum In harlem: 'Energy/Experimentation: Black Artists and Abstraction, 1964-1980,' through July 2. During one of the most radical periods in 20th-century American politics, the Black Power era, a group of African-American artists was working in one of the most radical forms of 20th-century art: abstraction. This show is stylishly installed; the 15 artists are intensely individualistic and part of an important history. 144 West 125th Street, (212) 864-4500. (Cotter) Galleries: 57th Street 'THE EAMES LOUNGE CHAIR: AN ICON OF MODERN DESIGN' Celebrating the 50th anniversary of a chair whose combination of declarative modernist structure and sheer creature comfort was both innovative and a bit alien, this exhibition is a successful design object in its own right. It pays homage with drawings, advertising ephemera, precursors, vintage television clips, a wonderful documentary and three versions of the chair itself, enshrined, exploded and useable. Museum of Arts & Design, 40 West 53rd Street, (212) 956-3535, through Sept. 3. (Smith) Galleries: SoHo EVA HESSE: 'DRAWING' This show deals in depth with Ms. Hesse's works on paper, ranging from rough sketches or notes, to test pieces made from various materials that function as drawings, to finished projects that stand on their own. A zealous researcher, Ms. Hesse made all kinds of thumbnail notations and calculations to explore the properties of her malleable materials. Many of these sheets, perhaps too many, are shown, too. Drawing Center, 35 Wooster Street, (212) 219-2166, through July 15. (Glueck) Galleries: Chelsea * 'An Ongoing Low-Grade Mystery' Organized by the curator Bob Nickas, this excellent group show includes works in many different mediums and styles related in that they are all predominantly red. Donald Judd, Sherrie Levine, Jim Drain, Wolfgang Tillmans and Dan Walsh are among more than 30 artists included. Paula Cooper, 534 West 21st Street, (212) 255-1105, through June 23. (Johnson) Willem de Kooning: 'Sketchbook' Twelve pages bearing spidery pencil drawings from a rare, intact sketchbook from the mid-1970's by this great Abstract Expressionist. Matthew Marks Gallery, 523 West 24th Street, (212) 243-0200, through June 17. (Johnson) BASQUIAT and DUBUFFET: 'PERSONAL MEMORIES' Nothing illuminates art like other art. And the pairing of two artists with similar appetites for drawing, collage, the grittiness of life and a bristling energy exudes a high-wattage electricity all its own. PaceWildenstein, 534 West 25th Street, (212) 929-7000, through June 17. (Smith) RICHARD SERRA: 'ROLLED AND FORGED' The centerpiece of the latest Serra spectacular, which favors mass, compression and rectangles over stretched-thin curves and spirals, is a low-lying maze in which the shifting heights and staggered placement of 16 thick, hedgelike plates create one of the most spatially complex yet straightforward works of his career. Gagosian Gallery, 555 West 24th Street, (212) 741-1111, through Aug. 11. (Smith) Other Galleries 'The Drop' More than two dozen artists present multimedia conceptual creations about the global problem of water. In works ranging from densely informational to entertainingly visual, they address the pollution, increasing scarcity and private marketing of one of our planet's most necessary resources. Nancy Drew made 100 colorful paintings based on water bottle labels; Brandon Ballengée presents a pyramid of bottles containing preserved specimens of endangered marine life; and Christy Rupp's installation of five water coolers invites viewers to test the water of each of New York's five boroughs. Exit Art, 475 10th Avenue, at 36th Street, (212) 966-7745, through June 10. (Johnson) Last Chance * Willem de Kooning: 'Paintings 1975-1978' Working with wide brushes, putty knives and other unidentifiable tools and methods, de Kooning improvised with abandon and to beautiful effect in these 13 paintings from the 70's. L & M Arts, 45 East 78th Street, (212) 861-0020; closes tomorrow. (Johnson) * Joe FiG With extraordinary skill and ingenuity, this young sculptor replicates in miniature the studios of well-known artists. The centerpiece of his exhibition recreates the adjoining Long Island studios of the painters and spouses Eric Fischl and April Gornik. Plus Ultra Gallery, 637 West 27th Street, Chelsea, (212) 643-3152; closes tomorrow. (Johnson) * Rosalind Solomon: 'American Pictures from Chapalingas' This excellent exhibition of works from 1974 to 2000 surveys the career of a photographer with a keen eye for human individuality and a pitch-perfect sense of composition. Her art bears a family resemblance to that of Diane Arbus, but it is gentler and kinder. Foley, 547 West 27th Street, Chelsea, (212) 244-9081; closes tomorrow. (Johnson)"

Mr. Griffiths as Mr. Griffiths doesn't like to be interrupted either. So when a cellphone went off for the third time during a crucial scene at Wednesday's matinee at the Broadhurst Theater, he stopped performing and glared at the audience. ''I can't compete with these electronic devices,'' he said. ''Now you were asked nicely by the stage manager,'' he continued, referring to the preshow announcement telling audience members of the 2003 City Council ban on cellphones in theaters. ''You were told that it's against the law.'' This, he said, is ''just disrespectful.'' Then he announced that he would start the scene for the second -- and last -- time: ''I won't do it again. You've been warned.'' The audience vigorously clapped. Mr. Griffiths has previously halted performances in London for repeated cellphone interruptions, asking the transgressors to leave. At the matinee Mr. Griffiths left and re-entered to restart the scene with Clive Merrison, who plays the headmaster. This time when Mr. Griffith said, ''I hate to be interrupted,'' the audience laughed. And even Mr. Griffiths couldn't contain a smile. PATRICIA COHEN"

Jim leaves his beloved wife Patricia (Sweeney), 13 children, 33 grandchildren and one great grandchild. As a dad, he instilled the importance of a close knit family unit, religion and education and was happiest when with family. While teaching in the 1950's, he envisioned an all boys' school for the ''underachiever.'' In 1962 he fulfilled his dream by founding St. Thomas More School that has shaped the lives of thousands of young men. Born in Waterbury, CT in 1923, Jim attended Sacred Heart School and Crosby High. Important early influences were relatives Msgr. William Fox and Rev. Michael J. McGivney, founder of ''The Knights of Columbus.'' After studying in the seminary, he transferred to Georgetown University, graduating in 1947, earning his Masters from Fairfield University in 1952. As a teacher at Fairfield Prep, he coached men's basketball at Fairfield University, and was inducted into their sports Hall of Fame. Later, he was awarded an Honorary Doctorate by Fairfield for founding STM. A memorial service will be held 10:00 a.m. Saturday June 24th in Our Lady Chapel at St. Thomas More School.

The choice could have been straightforward, but for one thing: Mrs. Porter lived in Tucson and Mr. Navran was in Hawaii. The two knew nothing about health care services in Missouri and did not know where to start looking. Luckily, their lawyer knew about Kansas City Home Care, a geriatric care management company that assesses a person's condition and puts together services to address the situation.

The European leg of the Stones' world tour had been scheduled to begin last Saturday, but was postponed when Mr. Richards, 62, reportedly fell out of a palm tree in April while on vacation in Fiji, suffering a concussion. He had brain surgery last month in New Zealand. The rescheduled European tour will include 21 stadium concerts in 11 countries through Sept. 3; two German dates, in Nuremberg and Leipzig, have been canceled. In a statement Mr. Richards said: ''Excuse me, I fell off of my perch! Sorry to disrupt everyone's plans but now -- it's FULL STEAM AHEAD! Ouch!'' Jolie a Cybersavvy Mom Angelina Jolie has a head start on cybersquatters.

Internet registration files show that the Web addresses ''shilohjolie,'' ''shilohpitt,'' ''shilohjoliepitt,'' ''shilohnouveljolie,'' ''shilohnouvelpitt'' and ''shilohnouveljoliepitt'' -- with the extensions .com, .org, .net and .info -- had been reserved as of May 27, when the baby was born. Ms. Jolie has control of those Web addresses for one year. Tom Cruise and Katie Holmes were not so enterprising. Their daughter's name, Suri, was co-opted by someone else who registered the domain ''suricruise.com.'' That Web site features a countdown to Suri's 18th birthday.

Starbucks will begin selling a DVD-CD combo of the film and a Chuck Berry compilation album on June 27, the same day that the distributor Image Entertainment will release the standard two- and four-disc versions of the film. The Starbucks DVD includes 40 minutes of extra film selected and edited by the director Taylor Hackford and will sell for $19.95. The documentary is based on a concert for Mr. Berry's 60th birthday in 1986 featuring Keith Richards, Eric Clapton, Etta James, Linda Ronstadt and others. Dear Catherine Twenty-six letters written by Voltaire, left, to Catherine the Great of Russia were bought at auction on Tuesday on behalf of an unidentified bidder, Agence France-Presse reported. According to Reuters, Alexander Khochinsky, a dealer in Moscow, told Nezavisimaya Gazeta, a Moscow newspaper, in a report published on Thursday, that he bought the letters for $750,000 at an auction at Sotheby's in Paris. Mr. Khochinsky said the letters would be returned to Russia. He declined comment when asked if he had bought the letters at the request of a Russian state official, the paper said. The lot represents more than a quarter of Voltaire's extensive correspondence with Catherine (1729-96). ''The letters contain texts completely unknown to researchers,'' Mr. Khochinsky said. ''They have been published nowhere.'' Pop Notes New albums due in coming months include the country stars George Jones and Merle Haggard's first record together since 1982.

Other guests on the album include Fat Joe and Styles P. Nas's album ''Hip-Hop Is Dead,'' to be marketed jointly by Def Jam and Columbia, is set for a Sept. 19 release. The next project for Diana Krall, above, will include standards like ''From This Moment On,'' ''How Insensitive'' and ''It Could Happen to You'' in quartet and large-band settings. Her album, which does not yet have a title, is scheduled for a Sept. 12 release by Verve. The label Shout Factory will release five late albums by the blues legend John Lee Hooker next year. The albums, all from the 1980's and 90's, include ''Boom Boom'' and ''Chill Out.'' The label also plans to release an 84-track, four-disc box set by the end of 2006. Mr. Hooker died in 2001."

A second preview is scheduled for tonight, with the official opening now set for Thursday.

Energy companies, meanwhile, are eager to spend money and are likely to spend a lot more soon. These developments have something in common: energy prices. Gasoline near $3 a gallon and the prospect of high summer air-conditioning bills are spooking many consumers but are exciting energy executives looking to use their cash hoards to buy out rivals. Seeking to calm the financial markets, which were rattled by these changes and persistent signs of inflation, President Bush nominated a new Treasury secretary with ample credibility on Wall Street and Capital Hill. A NEW CAPTAIN -- With the dollar falling and the trade deficit rising, and with tax cuts bumping up against a sizable federal budget deficit, President Bush named Henry M. Paulson Jr., a Wall Street banker, to succeed John W. Snow as Treasury secretary."

A1 The United States military said it has cleared of any wrongdoing a commander who led a raid March 15 on a home in Ishaqi, north of Baghdad, that left as many as nine Iraqis dead and prompted the police to charge that American forces executed civilians.

For 10 years, they rode motorcycles around the country, picking up work along the way when they ran out of money. Siebert has written numerous children's books about her experiences, and in TOUR AMERICA: A JOURNEY THROUGH POEMS AND ART (Chronicle, $17.95, ages 8 and up), she teams with Stephen T. Johnson, an artist and recipient of a Caldecott Honor, to highlight her favorite places.

2006-06-04T00:00:00Z,"INTERNATIONAL 3-24 Smuggling Scheme in Iraq The sabotage attacks that have crippled Iraq's oil pipelines and refineries for the past three years are now being used to aid a vast gasoline smuggling network that is costing the Iraqi government billions of dollars a year. 1 Gunmen ambushed five Russian embassy workers just blocks from their residence in western Baghdad, killing one and kidnapping the others in a bold attack that has become common in parts of Baghdad. In Basra a suicide attacker blew up a car bomb, killing at least 15 people. 10 Humans and Spread of Bird Flu In the wake of a cluster of avian flu cases that killed seven members of a rural Indonesian family, it appears likely that there have been many more human-to-human infections than the authorities have previously acknowledged. 14 Terrorist Arrests in Toronto Seventeen Canadian residents were arrested and charged with plotting to attack targets in southern Ontario with crude but powerful fertilizer bombs, the Canadian authorities said. American officials said the plot did not involve any targets in the United States, but warned that the full dimension of the plan was as yet unknown. 1 How Iran Strategy Changed With the threat of the coalition against Iran at risk of falling apart, and after intense debate lasting nearly two months, the Bush administration gradually grew more comfortable with offering talks to Iran, a country it considers the number one state sponsor of terrorism. 1 Defense Secretary Donald Rumsfeld told a gathering of defense experts that Iran was ''one of the leading terrorist nations in the world,'' and also questioned why Russia and China would allow Iran to participate the Shanghai Cooperation Organization. 12 NATIONAL 26-34 Border Patrol's Role Grows With a major expansion proposed by President Bush, the Border Patrol may soon overtake the F.B.I. as the largest federal law enforcement agency. But the stepped-up mission comes as the Border Patrol wrestles with recruitment and training problems and several agents face accusations of misconduct. 34 Town Seeks Its Own Energy A farming town in Indiana wants to secede from America's energy grid and power itself entirely with renewable sources, like its corn and pigs. 1 Early Test for Democrats In the first major Congressional race of what could be a politically volatile year, the battle to fill the seat of a jailed Republican in California is providing an early test of whether Democrats can turn Republican unrest into control of the House. 26 French Renaissance in Maine After decades of stigma for French-Americans in Maine, French is making a comeback. The state elected its first openly French-American congressman, and Gov. John E. Baldacci has steadily increased commerce with French-speaking countries. 26 Using Secrets Privilege Facing a wave of litigation challenging its eavesdropping at home and its handling of terror suspects abroad, the Bush administration is increasingly turning to a legal tactic that swiftly torpedoes most lawsuits: the state secrets privilege. 32 New Breast Cancer Drug For women with a certain type of breast cancer, the drug Herceptin has represented a major advance, but for some of those women, the drug never works. Now, an experimental drug promises to help women whose cancer continues to worsen despite taking Herceptin. 26 NEW YORK/REGION 27-29 Clinton Criticizes Terror Cut Intensifying complaints about a cut in antiterrorism money for New York City, Senator Hillary Rodham Clinton challenged President Bush to take responsibility for the action.

2006-06-04T00:00:00Z,"ARGENTINA The Argentines have historically been loaded with talent, from Diego Maradona to their current teenage phenomenon, Lionel Messi. They beguile with their feet, their heads and, in the case of Maradona, their hands. And, of course, they win: two World Cups and two second-place finishes. So why are they so loathed? Could it be because the team has more drama queens than ''Desperate Housewives'' -- players who dive and fake injuries when someone sweats a little too close to them? Or because they often mistake an opponent's legs for the ball (they earned a tournament-high 45 yellow and 4 red cards in 18 qualifying matches)? But skill trumps chicanery, and Argentina has plenty of the former. In addition to Messi, there are the predatory goal scorers Hernán Crespo and Carlos Tevez, and the artful playmaker, Juan Román Riquelme. Those skeptics can decry Argentina all they want -- they're likely to end up with huevos on their faces. CZECH REPUBLIC The Czechs are one of the few teams that refuse to genuflect to Brazil. After all, in that other beautiful game -- supermodel supremacy -- they've long since encroached upon Brazilian dominance, and it's somehow fitting that their soccer has gotten prettier, too. Since the Velvet Divorce, which split the country into the Czech and the Slovak republics 13 years ago, the once dreary, mechanical Czechs have acquired the verve and sophistication of their stylish capital, Prague. Technically assured, the current Czech team is also long on height, from the man-mountain 6-foot-8 striker, Jan Koller, to the imposing 6-foot-5 goalkeeper, Petr Cech. But no one embodies the new Czech spirit more than Pavel Nedved, he of the silky blond locks and even silkier skills. Coaxed out of retirement from international competition, the aging (33) but charismatic Juventus midfielder still dictates the Czechs' rhythm, and he can unleash thunderbolts with either foot. Nedved is known as the Czech Cannon, and he's their best shot at dethroning Brazil. ENGLAND Only six weeks ago, England was a halfway-decent bet to win the World Cup. Many bookmakers had them as second favorites. Wayne Rooney, the team's 20-year-old savior, even went all Joe Namath on the British media. ''Of course, we're going to win the World Cup,'' he boasted, neglecting to mention his track record: reports of $1.3 million in gambling debts. Then he broke his rapier right foot, and four years after England prayed for the recovery of David Beckham's glamorous metatarsal, the country finds itself once again kneeling down to ask that a famous foot be healed. Actually, two. Rooney's strike partner Michael Owen is still recovering from a broken metatarsal. The lame attackers have forced lame-duck coach Sven-Goran Eriksson to roll the dice on the warp speed of the 17-year-old prodigy Theo Walcott, whom he has never seen play live. Yet with the formidable midfield tandem of Steven Gerrard and Frank Lampard, to say nothing of Beckham's bendalicious prowess, the English should have little trouble in the first round. As for winning their first World Cup in 40 years, all bets are off. FRANCE The good news is that the French can hardly do worse than they did four years ago, when they arrived as defending champions and departed three games later -- winless, goal-less, joie-less. Then as now, they relied heavily on the talismanic presence of Zinédine Zidane, a three-time FIFA World Player of the Year and the linchpin of Real Madrid's famed galácticos. Having hobbled away from international competition in 2004, Zidane un-retired last year after all of France begged him to return as Les Bleus struggled to qualify for Germany. ''God is back,'' said Thierry Henry, a celestial talent in his own right. But the question remains: has Zidane, now 33, gone from galáctico to geriatrico? And how many of his fellow countrymen -- like Claude Makelele and Lilian Thuram, 33 and 34, respectively -- have also passed their sell-by dates? It falls to the great Henry, a sprightly 28, to ignite the French attack, but although he has been electrifying with Arsenal, his professional team, he has yet to display the same form for France. Sacré Bleus! GERMANY The only thing that's receding faster than coach Jürgen Klinsmann's hairline is the host country's faith in him. After five years of failing to beat a single world-class team, Germany turned to its former national hero and asked him to re-engineer the team's once proud soccer machine from a panzer into a BMW roadster. Instead of endurance and impregnability, he demanded adaptability and speed, off-loading battle-tested veterans in favor of untried youngsters like the fabulously named midfielder Bastian Schweinsteiger. Out went captain and goalkeeper Oliver Kahn, and in stepped rival Jens Lehmann, who recorded six consecutive shutouts for Arsenal in the Champions League (before being ejected in the final). The calm center of the team remains intact, however, bolted down by the ever dangerous Michael Ballack. Still, it seems unlikely that Klinsmann's kinder have the mettle to restore the Germans to soccer prominence, but there is one thing going for them: they get to play in their own haus. ITALY With the Italians, you don't know whether to laugh or cry. For years, the Azzurri have sung the bluesabout the injustices they've suffered at the hands of corrupt foreign referees. How ironic, then, that a match-fixing scandal has implicated their own World Cup referee, as well as all sorts of Italian suits. It's as if the soccer gods dropped a dead fish into the lap of Italy's World Cup prospects, just when those prospects looked so promising. Led by Luca Toni, who scored an astonishing 31 goals in Serie A this year, the Azzurri have successfully shed their stultifyingly defensive style in favor of a more wide-open attacking game full of flair and speed, tearing apart Germany, 4-1, in a recent World Cup tuneup. That this was accomplished without the operatic soul of the team, Francesco Totti, the Roma star known for his pretty chip shots and petty cheap shots, augured especially well for the Italians. And just as the country's rabid fans were ready to hail the return of their hero from a broken leg, the scandal has left them more hysterical than a Puccini heroine. On the other hand, because Italy is in the same group as the U.S., its woes could be buona fortuna for the Americans. THE NETHERLANDS Generally believed to be the best country never to have won the World Cup, Holland has always been one of the most colorful teams in the tournament -- literally. From their wildly entertaining Total Football of the 70's to the brilliance of their stars of the 80's and 90's -- Marco van Basten, Ruud Gullit and Frank Rijkaard -- the neon-orange-clad Dutch just can't seem to make it to the other side of the rainbow. They've lost in two World Cup finals. But in the last decade or so, Holland has earned a new reputation: as a self-defeating collection of arrogant divas who are riven by racial strife and prefer looking flashy on the field to actually winning. This year, at least, under van Basten's calm direction, the team looks once again to be a contender. He'll have plenty of world-class players to call on, including the lethal attacking trio of Ruud van Nistelrooy, Arjen Robben and Rafael van der Vaart, yet somehow you just can't help feeling that the Oranje will have their hopes crushed. SPAIN In the past half-century, Spain has yet to escape the quarterfinals, and in 1982 the team suffered the madre of all humiliations when, as host of the tournament, they crashed out in the second round. How to explain that a country boasting two of the world's most glamorous clubs -- Real Madrid and Barcelona -- has never produced a team worthy of its audacious talent? Could it be the Goalkeeper Curse? In 1998, their veteran keeper Andoni Zubizarreta sent his team packing with a spectacularly embarrassing gaffe. Four years later, Santiago Cañizares, attempting to make a save on a bottle of dropped cologne, tore a tendon and had to be replaced. This time around, sure-handed keeper Íker Casillas will no doubt go fragrance-free. But if the Spaniards, led by the teenage sensation Cesc Fábregas and their prodigious goal scorer, Raúl, need any extra incentive to finally realize their potential, they recently got it in the form of performance bonuses: if Spain wins the cup, each player will receive an estimated $700,000. That will buy a lot of Eau de Redemption."

2006-06-04T00:00:00Z,"To the Editor: It appears that the methodology used in the poll of literati was to ask each person to choose one novel as the best published since 1980. This is not a reliable statistical technique. Far more robust would be to ask each individual for a list of three top novels in order of preference (allowing for the designation of ties as well). Then give each first choice 3 points, each second choice 2 points, each third choice 1 point. If an individual judges two equal first choices, they should be given 2.5 points apiece; two equal last choices should be given 1.5 points apiece; and all three choices equal should be given 2 points apiece. This method would be far, far fairer, since many people will find it almost impossible to choose just one without feeling that very close second or third choices are neglected. The method I suggest is highly likely to result in the same conclusion if you had chosen another group of the same size of a similar composition. But if each person submits only one choice, that is not nearly so likely, rendering your poll's final ranking virtually meaningless.

2006-06-04T00:00:00Z,"There may be no free Shakespeare in the park in Montauk this summer, because members of the Hamptons Shakespeare Festival have been shut out of the county-owned cabins they have stayed in for the last 10 years and are dubious about finding other affordable accommodations at the height of the summer season. The festival usually puts on a production for four weeks at Theodore Roosevelt County Park starting in mid-July and then moves to Agawam Park in Southampton for a week. Since the first festival in 1996, its actors and workers have stayed in cabins at the county park, most recently for a flat total fee of about $11,000. But this year, the cabins, which are part of what was once a cattle and dude ranch, are booked for the summer. They are being used by park officials and contractors who, in April, started a renovation of Third House, built in 1806 and used by Colonel Roosevelt and his Rough Riders after the Spanish-American War."

2006-06-04T00:00:00Z,"Since its creation 18 years ago in the wake of several municipal corruption scandals, New York City's system of public campaign financing has become an indispensable feature of local politics, and a model for campaign reformers nationwide. The system provides public matching funds to candidates in return for enhanced disclosure, a pledge to honor spending and contribution limits, and at the citywide level, participation in broadcast debates -- in all, a worthwhile investment in democracy. Much of the credit for the system's success belongs to Nicole Gordon, the program's executive director since its inception. Working with Frederick Schwarz Jr., the chairman of the five-member Campaign Finance Board, which oversees the program, and his predecessor, the Rev. Joseph O'Hare, Ms. Gordon has worked to maintain the board's non-partisan culture as well as its resolve to enforce the rules even in the heat of campaigns."
2006-06-04T00:00:00Z,"After reading Kevin Kelly's article, I felt the need to go and look at my book collection, most of which I inherited from my mother. I handled each book gently, since they are all now quite frail. My mother's books are more than personal mementos. They are a reminder that some things cannot, and should not, be replaced. I use the Internet all the time and I think it's fantastic -- for research, not for reading. I mean really reading. A book may look ''inert,'' but there's nothing inert about what happens when I shut off the PC and the TV, and begin to read. There is an intimacy to holding this special possession in my hands that I cannot experience by looking at a plastic screen inside a metal box. I applaud the dazzling advances in research that the Internet has brought and will continue to bring. And yet I will, at the end of every day, curl up with a good book, not a good computer.

MY MOTHER'S WEDDING DRESS The Life & Afterlife of Clothes. By Justine Picardie 256 pp., Bloomsbury. $22.95. MUCH of the time when women shop, what they're really after is not a new outfit, it's a new self. With the exchange of a piece of plastic, they hope to achieve a look that transforms them into a captivating stranger. The fact that this doesn't quite work is why so many women's closets resemble clothing compost -- mulching heaps of different looks that don't come together in wan morning light but are too expensive to throw away and too pilled or rumpled to give to Goodwill in good conscience."

2006-06-04T00:00:00Z,"To the Editor: The choice of Toni Morrison's popular 1987 novel, ''Beloved,'' was unsurprising and well deserved. But The Times did not go far enough in drawing out the implication of Morrison's win and the receipt of the same laurel a generation ago by Ellison's ''Invisible Man.'' We now hold conclusive proof that in the 20th century we witnessed the distinctive arrival of an authentic American style, and that style is African-American. Black American culture and life are the universal metaphor for the genuine American. Since colonial times we have embraced African-Americans' indigenous experiments in speech, gesture, movement, rhythm and song. Today, we bear witness to more than 50 years of extraordinary black prowess in literature. Lawrence Jackson Atlanta The writer, an assistant professor of English at Emory University, is the author of a biography of Ralph Ellison."
2006-06-04T00:00:00Z,"While the opinions of Adam Goodheart (May 21) and his various sources offer a lively and interesting debate on the architecture of the University of Virginia, he left out an important group of experts on the subject: the students, faculty and staff -- those who eat, sleep and work in its highly disputed buildings. As a member of this diverse community, I value the functionality as well as the aesthetic beauty of the university's grounds. Keeping this in mind, I should add that (despite its visually appealing design) the ''very 21st-century culinary options'' offered at the Observatory Hill dining hall are generally limited to pizza and chicken-fried steak.

2006-06-04T00:00:00Z,"NEARLY a century ago, area leaders created the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey because they knew the region's long-term economic survival lay in cooperation, not competition between the states. Recently, we saw regional cooperation again as New Jersey and New York forged a unified agreement to rebuild the World Trade Center site. But too often in the last few years this kind of cooperation has been the exception. And that must change. Because divided, New Jersey and New York risk being crushed under the weight of their own growth. Together, however, the two states can make the landmark investments that will determine our economic success over the next century."
2006-06-04T00:00:00Z,"The Austrian accessories designer Devi Kroell got her career boost not from a powerful fashion editor but from a pop star with a reality television show, Jessica Simpson. ''I did this huge hobo bag in metallic python, and Jessica wore it nonstop on every episode of 'The Newlyweds' for six months,'' Ms. Kroell said. ''She put me on the map.'' No one-hit wonder, Ms. Kroell has just been nominated for the second time in two years for Swarovski's Perry Ellis Award for accessory design from the Council of Fashion Designers of America. The winner will be announced tomorrow evening."

2006-06-04T00:00:00Z,"Almost a year after Elizabeth Butler, a vivacious high school senior from North Salem, was found strangled and stabbed to death in her parents' car, her former boyfriend was found guilty of the murder. The former boyfriend, Ariel Menendez, 28, of the Bronx, whom the police described as unwilling to accept the breakup of the couple's relationship, was convicted Tuesday of two counts of first-degree murder, and first-degree rape and a criminal sexual act. It took the jury two hours to reach a verdict."
2006-06-04T00:00:00Z,"To the Editor: New York City is making substantial progress in addressing nitrogen loading in Long Island Sound, a major source of water quality degradation mentioned in your May 21 editorial ''Over Troubled Water.'' In January, the city and the state reached an agreement that will sharply reduce nitrogen discharges from city-owned sewage treatment plants along the upper East River. Construction valued at more than $700 million at the city's Wards Island, Tallman Island, Hunts Point and Bowery Bay wastewater treatment plants will result in a 58.5 percent reduction in nitrogen discharges from those four plants by 2017."
2006-06-04T00:00:00Z,To the Editor There is another factor to consider about the impact that unpaid internships have on the labor market.

When you pack for a golf trip, there's the bag for clubs, balls and umbrella, and there's the bag for clothes, jackets and shoes -- in other words, what you wear instead of what you use. The first rule, when it comes to packing, is to focus on layers, including collared shirts, water-repellent shells and a sweater vest to keep you warm but your arms unencumbered. What comes next depends on the weather (and the stringency of club dress codes). Hedge your bets by working from this list.

Enlarged in 1974 and 1998, and now enhanced for the third time, the museum is opening a 113,000-square-foot wing, designed by Michael Graves and named for Target, the Minneapolis-based retailer that contributed more than $10 million to the building fund. With other renovations factored in, the new space amounts to an increase of 40 percent in exhibition area. What's in it for viewers? Well, the grand opening next Sunday will salute the reinstallation of much of the permanent collection of almost 100,000 works, covering more than 5,000 years of art history. It includes one of the major collections of Asian art in the United States, with 20,000 square feet devoted to the installation of Chinese art alone. And six new galleries have been added to the nine existing ones for one of the country's largest permanent installations of Japanese art. Four new shows will kick off the exhibition program. ''The Surreal Calder'' explores the Surrealist origins of the American sculptor Alexander Calder. ''From Dürer to Cassatt: Five Centuries of Master Prints From the Jones Collection'' plays up the 1916 gift from Herschel V. Jones, publisher of The Minneapolis Journal, that forms the core of the museum's print holdings. ''Highlights From the Harrison Collection of Fine Photographs (1992-2006)'' includes 100 works by major 20th-century figures.

So a round-trip ticket between Brussels and Bruges can cost as little as $44 (second class) and $66 (first class); between Brussels and Antwerp, $30 (second class) and $54 (first class).

2006-06-04T00:00:00Z,"ITALY THE LOCKDOWN Italy is extremely organized defensively. They're not as conservative as they used to be, but in big tournaments they still have a conservative mentality. They'll start with four defenders, four midfielders and two forwards. If they are protecting a lead, they'll drop Gennaro Gattuso, who's a terrific defensive midfielder, back into a deeper position. They'll drop one of their forwards back or replace him with another central midfielder. All this will lock out the middle. To beat a locked-in team like that, you can try to go wide to cross balls into the box or play long balls from your half and hope your forwards can get to one of them. Or you can concede territory when the ball turns over, and let them come at you. Then, when you win the ball back and they're exposed, you can counterattack and maybe catch 'em. But if you hold on to the ball too much and allow the Italians to get set, they're a very tough team to crack. They're one of the best in the world at killing off a game. BRAZIL ALL-OUT ATTACK Brazil plays a 4-2-2-2: four defenders, two rows of midfielders and two forwards. It's an interesting formation, and unique. It works because Brazil has so many tremendous players who can get forward and also get back to defend. In the midfield, Ronaldinho has the freedom to find the game wherever he wants -- not quite as much as when he plays for Barcelona, but still, he's free. He likes to drift to the left, and when he does, the midfielder Kaká will move into a more central role. On the flanks, you've got Cafu and Roberto Carlos running the entire length of the field and serving balls in toward the goal. And then you've got big, strong guys in front, like Ronaldo and Adriano, who are not only gifted with their feet but are good in the air as well. So they attack with three, four, five guys at once. Two defensive midfielders, Emerson and Zé Roberto, hold down the center while everyone is going forward. They can destroy you in a million different ways. GERMANY THE FREE KICK Taking a free kick is not rocket science, but the Germans do it as well as anyone in the world. Generally, they'll put two players over the ball, a left-footer, like Lukas Podolski, and a right-footer, like Bernd Schneider, to disguise which way the ball will come in. Usually they'll hit an in-swinger, which curves in toward the goal at high speed and is very tricky to defend against. Their other players will line up near the goal and then run toward the net. The first runner and maybe the second will be decoys, and then the third out of, say, five runners will be Michael Ballack, their best player, who scored on the United States four years ago on one of these plays. With all this movement in a confined space, it's easy for the defenders to lose a man. If the ball is hit properly, Ballack will just get to it first and head it on target. To make this kind of set piece work, you need movement, good service, guys who are good in the air and courage -- to jump into a crowd of people knowing that a goalkeeper is coming. ENGLAND MIDFIELD POWER They depend so much on Wayne Rooney. But if he stays injured, England will still probably go with the same 4-4-2 formation -- only Peter Crouch will be Michael Owen's partner up front. Crouch is very tall, very good in the air and much better with his feet than people give him credit for. So even though losing Rooney is a blow, they now have an option they might not have had before: to play longer, more direct balls from the back. Otherwise, they can still build up through the midfield, with Steven Gerrard and Frank Lampard playing side by side. Since both of them like to come forward, the question there is, can one of them sit back? But in the end, England is more likely to play longer balls to the front of the opposing goal. There aren't many in the world who are better at that than David Beckham. And every one of these guys across the midfield -- Beckham, Gerrard, Lampard and Joe Cole -- can shoot very well from distance. THE NETHERLANDS WING PLAY The Dutch use real wingers -- rare in international soccer. In this 4-3-3 system, you've got these wide players who operate on the outside. Arjen Robben and Dirk Kuyt are two guys on the wing, and they love to go right at you one-on-one. Robben especially has the ability to cut inside and get shots off. Or he can beat you to the outside and serve crosses into the box in front of the net. Their target man is Ruud van Nistelrooy. He's amazing in the box, a guy who gets so many goals from within six yards of the net. And he's going to get tremendous service from his teammates on the flanks. That's the thing about the Dutch: every player -- defenders, midfielders, forwards -- has a high level of competence on the ball. There's a historical memory of Total Football here: the great Dutch system of the mid-70's that revolutionized the game, where players would change positions on the fly. I wouldn't call the setup of this team complete Total Football, but they have the personnel to come close. U.S.A. GOING WIDE The Americans like to play a 4-4-2 and go through the midfield with short passes from player to player, not over the midfield with long balls directly from the defense to the forwards. It's just a bit of the Latin style. They'll have Claudio Reyna and John O'Brien in the middle of the midfield, anchoring it, and that gives freedom to Landon Donovan and DaMarcus Beasley to go inside or outside. Then, if they want to open it up a bit, either Reyna or O'Brien will move forward a little while the other will stay back and help defend. Here, the ability for them to get around and wide is going to be important. That's where Eddie Lewis and Steve Cherundolo come in; they're both good servers of the ball. Beasley is also a very good wide player. These players will get forward and bring the ball into the corners. In the last World Cup, they made great runs wide against Portugal and Mexico to set up important goals. That'll be a characteristic this time, too. AND NOW FOR A LITTLE ONE-ON-ONE THE TURN AS THE IVORY COAST STRIKER DIDIER DROGBA RUNS, HE CHANGES THE DIRECTION OF THE BALL BY KNOCKING IT WITH THE HEEL OF HIS TRAILING LEG. THE MOVE IS A VARIATION OF ONE PIONEERED BY THE DUTCH LEGEND JOHAN CRUYFF, BUT DROGBA AND THE ARGENTINE ATTACKER LIONEL MESSI USE THIS TRICK AT A FULL SPRINT, LEAVING DEFENDERS WRONG-FOOTED. THE SCISSORS CRISTIANO RONALDO, THE PORTUGUESE DRIBBLING WIZARD, LIKES TO FEIGN KICKING THE BALL WITH THE OUTSIDE OF HIS FOOT AND INSTEAD STEPS OVER IT, THROWING THE DEFENDER OFF BALANCE. HE OFTEN REPEATS THE MOVE WITH HIS OTHER FOOT: THE DOUBLE SCISSORS. A POPULAR DRIBBLING MOVE, THE SCISSORS IS ALSO A FAVORITE OF FRANCE'S ZINÉDINE ZIDANE. THE FLICK FLACK PLAYERS LIKE RONALDINHO AND SWEDEN'S ZLATAN IBRAHIMOVIC SHOW REMARKABLE BALL CONTROL WITH THIS MOVE, ALSO KNOWN AS THE ELASTICO. AFTER PUSHING THE BALL ONE WAY WITH THE OUTSIDE OF HIS FOOT, A PLAYER IMMEDIATELY DRAGS IT BACK THE OTHER WAY WITH THE INSIDE. WHEN IT'S DONE AT FULL SPEED, THE BALL APPEARS STUCK TO HIS FOOT. *ALL LINEUPS SUBJECT TO CHANGE"

We shared so many wonderful experiences bringing up our children and enjoying travel adventures around the world. Barbara, you possessed such grace and beauty. You were so kind, so good, so giving, so wise, so feminine, yet strong and independent. You were a loving and caring mother. Claire's, Leslie's and Randy's fine qualities and virtues do credit to your maternal devotion. Beezie, no husband has ever had a more noble and loving wife. Roy was blessed from the day he met you. Yours was the most admired and loving marriage we have ever known. Ashley and Tracy weep for you at this sad time. We mourn for Barbara and pray for God to bless Roy and give him the strength to carry on and go forth with his life. Dalia and Larry"

2006-06-04T00:00:00Z,"The big news of the week is the premiere of ALEXEI RATMANSKY's''Russian Seasons,'' commissioned by the New York City Ballet for its Diamond Project series and performed by the company on Thursday, repeated on Saturday afternoon. Mr. Ratmansky, the director of the Bolshoi Ballet, has hitherto seemed like a sunny sort of artist, to judge by his comical re-envisioning of the Soviet ballet ''The Bright Stream'' last year for the Bolshoi season in New York City, and charming pieces seen at the Jacob's Pillow Dance Festival in 1999. But ''Russian Seasons'' mines the darker-sounding themes of the music, by the contemporary Russian composer LEONID DESYATNIKOV, and the heritage that in part inspired both the ballet and its score. New York State Theater, Lincoln Center, (212) 721-6500 or www.nycballet.com; $30 to $76. Across the plaza at American Ballet Theater, three ballerinas will take on the character of Cinderella, who looks anything but a pathetic waif in DAVID BOECHLER's costumes for JAMES KUDELKA's new look at an old fairy tale. The feisty GILLIAN MURPHY will play the title role, with DAVID HALLBERG as her handsome prince, on Monday and Friday nights and Wednesday afternoon. The bouncy little XIOMARA REYES will take on the role on Tuesday, Thursday and Saturday nights, performing with GUILLAUME CÔTÉ, a guest principal from the National Ballet of Canada. And the delicate, lyrical JULIE KENT takes over on Wednesday night and Saturday afternoon, with MARCELO GOMES as her prince. Metropolitan Opera House, Lincoln Center, (212) 362-6000 or www.abt.org; $23 to $163. Future Cinderellas and their princes may be spotted on Monday night at the Peter Jay Sharp (formerly Juilliard) Theater, when students of the City Ballet-affiliated School of American Ballet will perform GEORGE BALANCHINE's ''Square Dance'' and rarely seen ''Bourrée Fantasque'' and CHRISTOPHER WHEELDON's effervescent ''Scènes de Ballet,'' created for the school.

Bang on a Can commissions and presents new music and started the modern chamber ensemble called the Bang on a Can All-Stars. It has moved its annual all-day extravaganza to downtown Manhattan, where it is now free as part of the River to River Festival. Bang on a Can happily knocks down category dividers, and this year's festival spans Minimalism, jazz, electronica, improvisation, Siberian throat singing, Balinese gamelan and, still, some modern chamber music. There will be music from Bang on a Can's founding composers -- JULIA WOLFE, MICHAEL GORDON and DAVID LANG -- and its All-Stars. The lineup also includes ALARM WILL SOUND, a small orchestra that has transcribed the electronic pieces of Aphex Twin for unplugged instruments; AMIINA, a string quartet from Iceland that also plays instruments like xylophone and autoharp and has toured and recorded with Sigur Ros; MATMOS, an electronic group that often manipulates found sounds, performing with the ensemble SO PERCUSSION; GLEN KOTCHE, the drummer from Wilco; JEROME COOPER, the drummer from the free-jazz Revolutionary Ensemble; YAT-KHA, a Siberian group that features throat singing; MICHAEL NYMAN, whose Minimalist compositions include the score for the Jane Campion film ''The Piano''; and DON BYRON, a clarinetist who keeps delving into odd corners of American music. The complete lineup is at www.bangonacan.org. The marathon begins with a program for children at 11:30 a.m. and runs until 10 p.m.; admission is free."

This is because, like many of our neighbors' fences, the one we installed around our property happens to be of the invisible variety. Its technology, known generically as a pet containment system, was invented in the early 1970's and consists of three parts: wire wrapped in a cable that is buried at the perimeter of our two-acre plot, a transmitter and a receiver."

As the sage -- and Marxist -- father of Bessie Berger, the matriarch of the Depression-era family and the grandfather of her idealistic son Ralph, he provides both the play's voice of reason and its voice of agitprop. Mr. Gazarra describes how he found the essence of his character. It was, he says, ''much like Proust's Madeleine cookie that sent him back into his childhood.'' He continues, ''I was about three weeks into rehearsal, and I kept saying: 'Where is the Jew? I haven't found the Jew.' Around that time a young lady came in to teach me how to use barber tools. So among the tools was the hand clipper that brought me back, really. I hadn't seen one of those since I was a child.''

2006-06-04T00:00:00Z,"To the Editor: So ''Beloved'' -- the ''expected winner,'' according to A. O. Scott -- is anointed by the Book Review as the best work of American fiction published in the last quarter-century. Yet the list of 22 books that received multiple votes contains only one other novel by a woman, Marilynne Robinson's ''Housekeeping.'' Of the judges named, fewer than one in three is a woman. (We're left to guess how many women were on the original list of a ''couple of hundred prominent writers, critics, editors and other literary sages'' whose opinions were solicited.) Meanwhile, women are the authors of more than half the works of fiction reviewed in the same issue. I looked in vain in Scott's otherwise thought-provoking essay for some discussion of how gender contributes to our present-day judgments of fiction, from weekly reviews to lists of the ''best.'' Surely all American women who have published since 1980 can't be said, as Scott remarks of Ann Beattie, to have ''steadfastly'' refused to try to live up to an ''implicit criterion of importance.'' Perhaps our ideas of importance are worth revisiting. To borrow Scott's phrase regarding ''The Group'' (the only novel by a woman that he mentions as having been in contention for Book Week's 1965 list), I'll insist if no one else will.

The landmarks, like the Plaza Hotel, which inspired Kay Thompson's ''Eloise,'' and Pete's Tavern, where O. Henry is said to have written ''Gift of the Magi,'' fall into the same categories Mr. Kurutz used in his article. One can also stay at the Algonquin Hotel on West 44th Street, home of the famed literary Round Table of the 1920's, or have a drink at Chumley's (temporarily closed due to a recent fire next door) in Greenwich Village, which was frequented by John Steinbeck, Ernest Hemingway, Edna Ferber, Simone de Beauvoir and Jack Kerouac. During the day, you can stop at the Donnell Library Center (20 West 53rd Street) and visit the original stuffed-animal collection that inspired A. A. Milne's ''Winnie-the-Pooh.''

2006-06-04T00:00:00Z,"David Wilmot, ''The Lieutenant of Inishmore'' The second scene of Martin McDonagh's ''Lieutenant of Inishmore'' opens with a blood-spattered man dangling upside down and being nastily tortured by Padraic, a crazed member of a tiny Irish Republican Army splinter group. Padraic, played with sleazy gusto by David Wilmot, is taunting his victim with a razor, but it is the two revolvers he wears in a double shoulder holster that Mr. Wilmot said gave him instant access to his violent character. ''I guess I liked them because they are empowering,'' he said of the weapons. ''When you pick up the guns, they are sort of like magic wands; people in the audience shift. I guess they are scared of getting sprayed by blood.''"

2006-06-04T00:00:00Z,"I must agree with Richard Tuttle: ''the whole architecture profession is ego gone wild.'' Here in Denver, Daniel Libeskind has given us a new art museum that looks, God forbid, like a collapsed skyscraper, jagged and inverted. Our football stadium has the vertigo-inducing look of an amusement-park ride, and our airport evokes a nomad's tent that can be rolled up and taken elsewhere. I believe architecture should embody two principles: a sense of place and a sense of stability, one or both of which seem to be lacking in much postmodern design. Jimi Bernath Englewood, Colo."

When the milled steel doors are closed, you are apt to feel a little groggy as the oil paint fumes start to kick in, but that just adds to the heady atmosphere, already thick with myth. Until the ascendancy of Gerhard Richter, the talented, mystical realist painter, few German artists were as admired and collected as Mr. Kiefer."
2006-06-04T00:00:00Z,"Connecticut and I go back a long way. So long, in fact, that I could tell you the story of how ''Yankee Doodle'' got to be the state song. Connecticut was my first great political obsession, and I can still sing the words to ''The Green Hills of My Connecticut,'' which ''Yankee Doodle'' replaced in 1978. Though you really wouldn't want to encourage that. Beginning today, The Times will be publishing a separate editorial page on Connecticut issues every Sunday. We'll now have editorial pages in all five of the paper's regional weeklies, but I suspect Connecticut's is always going to have a special place in my affections. You cannot possibly spend as much time in a state capitol as I did in Hartford and not always feel the tug."
2006-06-04T00:00:00Z,"IT'S prom season and graduation is just around the corner. If there ever was a time to focus on the problem of underage drinking here in Connecticut, it's now, when teenagers are busy celebrating their final days of high school and the beginning of independence, in many cases by popping a cork or opening a bottle. Why should we focus on underage drinking? Because we have a serious problem in this state. Every year, hundreds of teenagers in Connecticut are injured in alcohol-related accidents and assaults. And what's worse is that these teenagers (and about 138,000 of their drinking peers who avoid violent injuries) are also being harmed in a less visible way by significant and documented harm to their developing brains. For a state with our per capita wealth, population talents and diverse resources, we -- parents and elected officials -- are letting our children down."

2006-06-04T00:00:00Z,"I found it surprising that nowhere in the discussion of a digitized universal library was there mention of Jorge Luis Borges's ''Library of Babel.'' In 1941, Borges posited the existence of an endless library (otherwise known as the universe) that was made up of infinite hexagonal galleries of books, containing everything ever written, including all that has ever been conceived of having been written. While Borges feared the human species might be on the verge of extinction, he did believe that ''the Library -- enlightened, solitary, infinite, perfectly unmoving, armed with precious volumes, pointless, incorruptible, and secret -- will endure.''

Before beginning Lorraine's humorous commentary about her life, Ms. Jones slips on the glasses. ''Those glasses are my portals into her worldview,'' said the actress, who has already received a special Tony Award this season for her show.

This is not a coincidence. William Oster, the Southampton restaurant's chef and owner, founded the Riverhead restaurant and was its first chef. When he left, he took the name with him. (For a while, there were two Tuscan Houses -- until the one in Riverhead closed for a few months and then reopened with a new name, Il Luigino Classico.) The Southampton restaurant occupies the prominent corner location that for many years was Basilico. It is a straightforward place with sunny sponge-painted walls, carpeting, sturdy wood chairs, dramatic wall sconces, ceiling fans, framed mirrors and familiar Italian art. Arches filled with opaque glass separate the dining area from the barroom, an inviting space with high-table seating, a mirror-backed bar and a striped ceiling of blue and deep red."

2006-06-04T00:00:00Z,"Before Marlon Brando died in 2004, he spent six months working on a movie directed by a Tunisian filmmaker, Ridha Behi. The uncompleted work is now being reconfigured as part fiction and part documentary. Retitled ''Brando and Brando,'' it will be about Mr. Behi's budding friendship with the actor. Mr. Behi is the latest filmmaker who has been forced to deal with the death of a star in the middle of production. Today, thanks to digital technology, editors can insert a dead actor into almost any scene. This was the case with Brandon Lee, who was killed in an accident during filming of ''The Crow'' (1994), and with Oliver Reed, who died during ''Gladiator'' (2000)."
2006-06-04T00:00:00Z,"The Connecticut judiciary appears to care little for openness, especially when it comes to information that could embarrass the politically connected, not to mention the judiciary itself. In recent years, Connecticut judges have sealed records of cases involving prominent people, refused to release routine information and, most recently, told reporters they could not take notes in an open courtroom. The public has thus been denied information, for example, about the divorce of the University of Connecticut president, Philip Austin, as well as details of civil cases involving judges and attorneys."

2006-06-04T00:00:00Z,"The documentary maker JAY CORCORAN has never shied away from exploring painful and politically touchy aspects of gay male sexuality from a ground-level perspective. His newest film, ''ROCK BOTTOM,'' examines the crystal meth epidemic affecting gay New Yorkers in various stages of addiction and recovery. Why, the film wonders, has this potent, destructive form of speed become such a scourge? In its thrall, users lose their health (several of those interviewed were taking H.I.V. medication), their jobs, their loved ones and sometimes even their lives. This cautionary film suggests that the crisis is rooted in the fundamental stresses of gay culture. Among men with low self-esteem, the drug temporarily blots out shame, anxiety and sexual inhibition. Peer pressure within an insulated, sex-based party culture is another cause. Most disturbing is the testimony from those interviewed about the physical experience of sex when high on crystal meth. Because it enhances and prolongs pleasure, many former users find themselves disappointed or even uninterested in sex without speed. That's why so many go back to the drug. Although psychologists and doctors have their say, the bulk of the movie focuses on present and former users, who speak about their experiences with a remarkable candor. ''Rock Bottom'' is being screened Tuesday at 8:15 p.m. and Wednesday at 3:45 p.m. at the AMC Loews 34th Street Theater as part of NEWFEST 2006, the 18th New York Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, Lesbian and Transgender Film Festival. In a lighter vein, the festival's closing-night film, RAMON SALAZAR'S ''20 CENTIMETERS'' (next Sunday at the same theater), is a gender-bending Spanish musical-comedy fantasy. Its heroine, pursuing transgender surgery (male to female), falls asleep and awakens as the star of her own Technicolor Hollywood-style musical. 312 West 34th Street, at Eighth Avenue, Manhattan, (646) 797-9947, www.newfest.org."

2006-06-04T00:00:00Z,"To the Editor: I was annoyed by the careless sweep of A. O. Scott's statement, in ''In Search of the Best'' (May 21), that the Book Review's survey to determine the best American novel of the last 25 years ''reveals that the baby boom . . . has not produced a great novel.'' It reveals no such thing. Those surveyed -- whose credentials certainly entitle them to an opinion -- were not asked to name those novels of the last 25 years they considered ''great.'' They were asked to choose ''the single best work'' of that period. They may think 12 or 15 great novels were published in that span; they may think not one was. We have no way of telling. They were asked a different question. Scott also mentions that of the authors to receive more than two votes, only Tim O'Brien and Marilynne Robinson were born after World War II. But that still leaves some authors who (I assume) received exactly two votes: Mark Helprin was born in 1947, Denis Johnson in 1949 and Edward P. Jones in 1951, which would make them all boomers by ordinary accounting. Surely it is much too soon, in any case, to say that Jonathan Franzen, David Foster Wallace, Richard Powers or William T. Vollmann -- to say nothing of Mary Gaitskill, Ben Marcus, Paul Auster, Lorrie Moore or Charles Johnson -- have not written great fiction. Posterity always has the deciding vote in these matters.

Beginning in Paris in the early 1920's, Man Ray (1890-1976) used electricity as an inspiration for art.

His long and successful career as a designer in the field of American Fashion spanned many continents and included his opening a design business, his employment as Senior Vice President of Design with the Leslie Fay Corporation in New York City, and as a fashion consultant in Miami, FL. Mr. Mason had resided in Fort Lauderdale for the past 25 years involving himself with charitable activities, most recently as a docent with the Bonnet House in Fort Lauderdale, where his kind, generous and sophisticated persona exquisitely complimented the capacity in which he served. A dear friend of Mr. Mason's recently shared his thoughts, which follow. For those who had the good fortune to know Stephen Mason or who had the privilege to meet him, we are saying goodbye to one of the last of a great era. ''This was a man who was at the opening nights of Chorus Line, Brigadoon, West Side Story, Pal Joey, Damn Yankees, and countless others. His friends were legends like Bob Fosse, Michael Bennett, Cheryl Hines, the Lunts, Bob Mackie, Rock Hudson, Robert Preston, and Burt Lancaster. He designed and/or built dresses for Jackie Onassis, Lauren Bacall, Marlene Dietrich, and he did once tango with Marilyn Monroe. This was a man who lived his life every second to its fullest. He could turn a phrase like no one I have ever met, and as I am sometimes stumped for words myself, I can only borrow words from a much greater writer who said, 'Good night, sweet prince, And flights of angels sing thee to thy rest!'''

Behind the News -- In some ways, an odd choice. Mr. Paulson is a deficit hawk while the administration has built up historic budget deficits. But many allies of the White House had lobbied for him, convinced he could help convey the strengths in the economy and reassure voters of the president's economic competence. Mr. Paulson had to be carefully courted, a sign of the prestige the job has lost under Mr. Bush. THE NONCIVILIAN The News -- Gen. Michael V. Hayden was sworn in as director of the Central Intelligence Agency. Behind the News -- At the ceremony Wednesday, President Bush felt compelled to give agency employees a pep talk, assuring them that they remained ''vital'' to the White House. The event was for public consumption. (The general officially became director Tuesday.) The administration wanted to lift agency morale and portray a sense of calm after several turbulent years at the C.I.A. Sensitivity lingers over a military officer leading the civilian agency. THE GOLDEN ARM The News -- Roger Clemens, the future Hall of Fame pitcher, agreed to come out of retirement and rejoin the Houston Astros. Behind the News -- A break for the struggling Astros, the defending National League champions. Clemens turns 44 in August but is hardly teetering. He led the major leagues with a 1.87 earned run average last year. His time off could keep him fresh in September. Three other 43-year-old pitchers are still kicking: Terry Mulholland of Arizona, Jaimie Moyer of Seattle and David Wells of Boston. One subplot: Clemens's son Koby, an infielder in Houston's minor league system, could join his father soon. THE NEW CHILD The News -- Well, not so new a child. Prince Albert II of Monaco acknowledged that he is the father of a 14-year-old American girl, a lawyer for the prince's family, Thierry Lacoste, told Le Figaro, a French newspaper. Officials in Monaco said they would not comment on the matter. Behind the News -- Last year, Prince Albert, who is not married, acknowledged that he was the father of a 3-year-old boy. He later told The New York Times that he did not know of any other paternity claims that could be true. Mr. Lacoste told Le Figaro that legal paternity was established several weeks ago. THE LONG FAREWELL The News -- Katie Couric spent her final day as anchor of ''Today.'' Now it's on to the ''CBS Evening News'' in September. Behind the News -- For weeks, NBC built a relentless drumbeat of publicity. Then came Wednesday's lovefest packed with memories and tributes. Was it too much? It could have ''turned unbearably cloying but didn't, mainly because Ms. Couric reined in her emotions and did not exit in a puddle of tears,'' wrote Alessandra Stanley of The New York Times.

And Barb (Jeanne Tripplehorn, above, with Mr. Paxton) seizes the spotlight at the Mother of the Year ceremony at the governor's mansion. Could it have anything to do with her parenting skills being so much more expansive than previously thought? 8:30 P.M. (Nickelodeon) LET'S JUST PLAY: GO HEALTHY CHALLENGE -- In April, four adolescents vowed to live healthier lifestyles -- and to encourage their friends, families and communities to do the same. This special assesses their progress. 9 P.M.

(HBO) THE SOPRANOS -- Season finale. Tony, ever the supportive spouse, gives Carmela a career boost, while A.J. receives a perk from his own place of employment. 9 P.M. (National Geographic Channel) SPACE RACE: THE UNTOLD STORY -- On their side: Sergei Korolev, a political prisoner. On ours: Wernher von Braun, a former Nazi scientist.

(History Channel) THE REVOLUTION -- Everyone knows the principal players: Thomas Paine, John Adams, Thomas Jefferson, George Washington and Benjamin Franklin. But what about the unsung heroes -- the spies, slaves, free Africans, American Indian sympathizers, emancipated women and downright eccentric personalities -- who dared to take on the mightiest empire in the world? This new 13-part series looks at the common folk who committed treason against the British crown for the cause of independence. 10 P.M. (E!) THE SIMPLE LIFE: 'TIL DEATH DO US PART -- Make that ''The Surreal Life,'' since Paris Hilton and Nicole Richie (near right, with Ms. Hilton) aren't talking these days.

2006-06-04T00:00:00Z,"To the Editor: Senator John Kerry's supporters believe that the charges of the Swift boat group cost him the election. The senator's Vietnam record, however, would have never been a significant issue had he not foolishly made it the centerpiece of his campaign, including the opening words of his acceptance speech for the Democratic presidential nomination: ''I'm John Kerry, and I'm reporting for duty.''"
2006-06-04T00:00:00Z,"From the critical (and blogospherical) drubbing most of them received, you might think that the movie and television stars who dared to tread the New York boards this season were a colony of succubi and incubi sent to defile our sacred temple. At the very least, Hollywood types like JULIA ROBERTS, DAVID SCHWIMMER and AMANDA PEET were accused of taking jobs that belonged to properly trained stage actors. But who is ever properly trained? Drama school graduates can blither their way through performances as false as any Tinseltown nitwit's. Meanwhile Ms. Roberts wasn't the train wreck some painted her as; I hope she tries again. And several of her West Coast colleagues -- GLORIA REUBEN in ''Stuff Happens,'' JOHNNY GALECKI in ''The Little Dog Laughed,'' OLIVER PLATT in ''Shining City,'' LAUREN AMBROSE in ''Awake and Sing!'' -- were terrific. Provenance is a poor measure of actors. O.K., there was SUZANNE SOMERS. Still, the west-to-east traffic isn't slowing down. Right now in New York WENDIE MALICK (''Just Shoot Me'') and MARK MOSES (''Desperate Housewives'') are starring in DAVID WARREN's Wall Street comedy ''BURLEIGH GRIME$.'' (In previews, opens June 13, New World Stages, 340 West 50th Street, Clinton, 212-239-6200; $70.) And SANDRA OH (''Grey's Anatomy'') is headlining DIANA SON's ''SATELLITES,'' an intimate drama about an interracial couple. (In previews, opens June 18, Public Theater, 425 Lafayette Street, East Village, 212-239-6200; $50.) But the bicoastal casting prize goes to NEIL LABUTE's ''SOME GIRL(S),'' whose Must-See TV ensemble includes ERIC MCCORMACK (''Will & Grace''), MAURA TIERNEY (''ER''), FRAN DRESCHER (''The Nanny''), JUDY REYES (''Scrubs'') and BROOKE SMITH (''Grey's Anatomy''). (In previews, opens Thursday, Lucille Lortel Theater, 121 Christopher Street, Greenwich Village, 212-279-4200; $65 to $70.) Imported, yes, but at a time when plays are getting smaller, top-notch small-screen casts may be just the ticket."

Jim leaves his beloved wife Patricia (Sweeney), 13 children, 33 grandchildren and one great grandchild. As a dad, he instilled the importance of a close knit family unit, religion and education and was happiest when with family. While teaching in the 1950's, he envisioned an all boys' school for the ''underachiever.'' In 1962 he fulfilled his dream by founding St. Thomas More School that has shaped the lives of thousands of young men. Born in Waterbury, CT in 1923, Jim attended Sacred Heart School and Crosby High. Important early influences were relatives Msgr. William Fox and Rev. Michael J. McGivney, founder of ''The Knights of Columbus.'' After studying in the seminary, he transferred to Georgetown University, graduating in 1947, earning his Masters from Fairfield University in 1952. As a teacher at Fairfield Prep, he coached men's basketball at Fairfield University, and was inducted into their sports Hall of Fame. Later, he was awarded an Honorary Doctorate by Fairfield for founding STM. A memorial service will be held 10:00 a.m. Saturday June 24th in Our Lady Chapel at St. Thomas More School.

Hardly any of us remember the Long Island Express of 1938, which tore open the Shinnecock Inlet and killed more than 50 people. But we can all recall the storms that slashed across southern Florida and the Gulf of Mexico last year. Now a new hurricane season has begun, and Long Island is rolling the dice one more time. How ready are we?

Leslie Fabian died peacefully after a recurring struggle with prostate cancer. His loyal and loving wife of 18 years, Jo Phelps Fabian, was with him. Born in Budapest, Hungary on May 11, 1927, Les Fabian's life became a classic American success story. His early years and education in Hungary were disrupted by WWII, the Nazi occupation and subsequent intervention by the Soviet Army. He managed to slip out of Hungary, migrate to the USA and promptly enlist in the US Army for service during the Korean War. His linguistic skills were utilized during his Army service in Europe. In the process, he was able to assist his late parents, Dr. Alexander and Edith Fabian, in securing Visas to the US, along with his only sibling, George Fabian, now of Bryn Mawr, PA. Upon completion of his military service, Les Fabian focused on his education. In quick succession, he earned an undergraduate degree from Columbia University, an MBA from NYU, plus an LLD from NYU as well. He chose securities analysis and investment banking as his career. At the beginning, New York Life Insurance Company had 2 junior analyst places open (following public utilities and railroads) and 2 promising applicants, including Mr. Fabian. Both neophyte analysts were hired, their assignments being decided by a coin flip. Les Fabian became a career-long public utilities analyst/investment banker as a result. In time, Les Fabian settled into what became Dean Witter Reynolds Inc., now part of Morgan Stanley, where he advanced to major stockholder, SVP and Director. In the process, he recruited over 50 utilities companies as corporate clients for his firm. Les Fabian then transferred his energies to the executive search field, becoming a partner of Ward, Howell Inc. He had several avocations in the areas of culture, history and the performing arts, principal of which was the Metropolitan Opera Co to which he became a generous donor for many years. Jo Phelps Fabian currently serves as a member of the Board of the Met. Constant world travelers but consummate New Yorkers, the Fabians have maintained a Park Avenue home for many years. Likewise, they have maintained memberships in both New York's University Club and Union League Club. Generous in many ways, he was helpful to the careers of young people close to him. Also, he constantly revered the memory of his only child, Barbara Fabian, who predeceased him. He was a member of The Brick Presbyterian Church of NYC. Interment was private."
2006-06-04T00:00:00Z,"LaChanze, ''The Color Purple'' If clothes make the man, it's the wig that makes the woman in LaChanze's interpretation of Celie, one of the central characters in the Broadway adaptation of Alice Walker's novel and Steven Spielberg's movie ''The Color Purple.'' ''What helps me to really put the final touches on becoming Celie is when I put the wig on and look at myself,'' the actress, who goes by only one name, said. ''It immediately transforms me. It's braided to look like the natural hair of a Southern girl of that time. I wore my hair like that as a child, in big plaits, and being from the South, that's a very familiar look for me.''"
2006-06-04T00:00:00Z,"AS problems go, it was a bit of a luxury matter: a gloriously sunny Memorial Day weekend, nominally free and clear. My wife, Jill, and I could theoretically go anywhere, but the most likely destination was someplace near the Atlantic Ocean within driving distance. From where we sit, which is in Montclair, that could be the Jersey Shore, or more ambitiously, the Hamptons. We decided to split the difference. When it comes to the choice between the Hamptons and the Jersey Shore, we are generally Third Way people. Minnesotans by birth, we grew up in a culture where every weekend, the question was always the same: ''Are we going Up North?'' Up North meant scattering to any one of the 10,000 lakes (more, actually) that the state is famous for."
2006-06-04T00:00:00Z,"To the Sports Editor: In ''Even With Veterans, Woeful Royals Are Playing Like Court Jesters,'' (May 28), Jack Curry's statement that the Royal's owner, David Glass, ''has long been stingy with the payroll'' seems an understatement. Kansas City is a classic example of a team that should benefit from baseball's revenue sharing and luxury tax."
2006-06-04T00:00:00Z,"An essay on May 21 about publishers' promotional strategies for literary fiction gave an incorrect job title for Janet Silver of Houghton Mifflin, who suggested finding ''ways of talking about a book that go beyond its intrinsic merit.'' She is a vice president and the publisher of adult trade books, not editor in chief. (Silver held all three titles simultaneously until April, when she named Eamon Dolan editor in chief.)"
2006-06-04T00:00:00Z,"PBS is bringing back ''GEORGE GERSHWIN: REMEMBERED'' (check local listings), a satisfying 1987 ''AMERICAN MASTERS'' documentary. In many ways the life of the man who composed ''Rhapsody in Blue,'' ''Porgy and Bess'' and a string of pop hits like ''The Man I Love'' is a classic New York story: growing up poor with immigrant parents, making it big on Tin Pan Alley, going Hollywood, becoming disillusioned, dying young. The nice thing about ''THE 2006 ALMA AWARDS'' (Monday at 9:30 p.m. on ABC), which honors Latino performers, is that the nominees aren't all the same as those on the other thousand awards telecasts. CLIFTON COLLINS JR. (né Gonzalez-Gonzalez), for instance, is nominated for the film ''Capote'' (he played the killer Perry Smith). And who knew ALEXIS BLEDEL of ''Gilmore Girls'' was Hispanic (Mexican mother, Argentine father)? EVA LONGORIA of ''Desperate Housewives'' is host. Nothing could sound like a worse programming idea than ''QUEER EYE: LAS VEGAS.'' But in this new batch of episodes, starting this week (Tuesday at 10 p.m. on BRAVO), the Fab Five demonstrate the proper mix of enthusiasm and superiority toward the city's excess. CARSON KRESSLEY wears gold lamé. JAI RODRIGUEZ tries on a showgirl outfit. And the whole gang piles into a white stretch limo to make over some poor heterosexual wretch, in this case a comedian-magician who lives with his artist wife in a house that Mr. Kressley describes as '' 'Golden Girls' on a budget.'' The comedian Kathy Griffin's self-deprecating act is getting a little old, but she does put her heart into it. The most painful moment on the season premiere of ''KATHY GRIFFIN: MY LIFE ON THE D-LIST'' (Tuesday at 9 p.m. on BRAVO) is Kathy Griffin Day in Louisville, Ky. The ceremony is sparsely attended, to say the least. Sometimes this hour feels like HBO's recent series ''The Comeback,'' about a washed-up television actress (played by Lisa Kudrow), which people either loved or hated."

But the New York State Legislature has yet to pass these changes. In the meantime, more than 1,100 New Yorkers every year unnecessarily progress to full-blown AIDS because their illness went undiagnosed for almost 10 years. AIDS groups should be screaming for expanded testing, and many of them are. But some are fighting any change, as though the epidemic hasn't evolved since the 1980's. In those days, there were important reasons to protect people getting tested for AIDS. There were no drugs to treat the disease. A positive test meant that you were just waiting to die. William F. Buckley was calling for tattoos to identify people with H.I.V., and others wanted to quarantine us."

Only doom-punk stalwarts like the Bay Area quartet AFI would release an album called ''Decemberunderground'' in June (albeit on 6/6/06, the gothest day of the century). There are no lazy beach strolls in ''Summer Shudder,'' just a tortured breakup and fears of suicide and melting eyeliner. ''Under the summer rain, I burned away,'' Mr. Havok sings. He prefers a ''Love Like Winter'' in which it's ''December every day.'' On the bright side, the temperatures that month in Berkeley -- where Mr. Havok lives -- average in the ungloomy 50's."

Sami Saatchi, above, of SVS Fine Jewelry in Oceanside, N.Y., is a member. [C4.] NEW BUSINESS MAGAZINE -- After months of anonymity, the new glossy business magazine from Condé Nast -- to start publishing next year -- now has an identity: Condé Nast Portfolio.

In February the foundation's president, Barry Munitz, resigned under pressure amid growing questions about his improper use of the trust's money. He was not given a severance package and was required to repay the trust $250,000 to settle questions about his expenses and travel. Mr. Hartwig said the foundation's board had decided to revamp the Web site as part of an overall plan ''to strengthen existing policies and create in some cases new policies designed to guard against issues that we've been dealing with over the past couple of years on the management side.''

That made it the highest-rated episode of this edition, but it was the lowest-rated ''Apprentice'' finale, and in total viewers, CBS's ''CSI: Miami'' rerun (11.6 million) outdrew it. Despite the ''Apprentice'' lag, NBC easily won the night among adults 18 to 49 and total viewers.

The center, a treasure house of literary holdings, has already staked its claim on Broadway and Hollywood with acquisitions of the Stella Adler archives and the collections of film legends like David O. Selznick and Gloria Swanson. In a statement with the announcement of the gift, Mr. De Niro, above, a two-time Oscar winner (''The Godfather Part II'' and ''Raging Bull'') who has appeared in 67 films and directed two others, said he had chosen the Harry Ransom Center to make the materials available to students and the public. ''Ultimately that's what it's all about,'' he said. Steve Wilson, associate curator of the center's film collection, said the trove should be invaluable to scholars and actors alike.

Most of the things I cook now, I had never heard of until I was almost 30.''

2006-06-07T00:00:00Z,"ONCE a year, it seems, I go on a miniquest to find a ''new'' recipe for rhubarb. It isn't easy. There are very real limits to what you can do with a sour vegetable that doesn't really have much substance. And because there's not much in the way of either supply of or demand for it -- most stores stock a few stalks for a few weeks a year, and that's it -- the repertory doesn't seem to change much. You occasionally see rhubarb cooked with fish or stewed with sweet fruits to make a compote or, of course, made into pies, especially with strawberries, a wonderful marriage. But on a recent trip to England, where rhubarb is celebrated more than it is here, I was offered a preparation I had once loved but lost track of: rhubarb soup. This is an unexpected creation, but it makes perfect sense. When cooked with water, even for just a little while, rhubarb falls apart completely, thickening whatever liquid surrounds it."

The novel, the third for Ms. Smith, right, is a modern rendering of E. M. Forster's ''Howards End.'' ''This is a book which combines extraordinary characterization with skillful and seemingly effortless plotting,'' said Martha Kearney, the BBC news broadcaster who was the chairwoman of the judges' panel. ''It ranges from exposing the intimacies of family life to broader themes of aesthetics, ethics and the vagaries of academe in a literary tour de force.'' The Orange Prize, in its 11th year, is open to women whose novels are published in Britain and display ''excellence, originality and accessibility.'' Ms. Smith defeated a field that included Ali Smith (''The Accidental''), Nicole Krauss (''The History of Love''), Hilary Mantel (''Beyond Black''), Sarah Waters (''The Night Watch'') and Carrie Tiffany (''Everyman's Rules for Scientific Living'').

Kimbell Museum Returns A Confiscated Turner The Kimbell Art Museum in Fort Worth is returning a J. M. W. Turner painting to the heirs of a couple whose goods were sold at an auction of ''Jewish property'' by the Vichy regime in World War II France. The painting, ''Glaucus and Scylla'' (1841), which has been in the Kimbell's collection since 1966, will remain on view only through June 25. The museum said ''Glaucus and Scylla'' was being returned as a result of discussions with Alain Monteagle, who represents the heirs of John and Anna Jaffé, who were residents of Nice. Mr. Jaffé bequeathed the painting to his wife when he died in 1933, and when she died in 1942, she left it to a niece and three nephews, one of them the grandfather of Mr. Monteagle. The Kimbell said that the Vichy authorities had disregarded Mrs. Jaffé's bequest, seized the contents of her home in July 1943 and auctioned them in Nice, scattering more than 60 paintings and other works of art. The Turner painting did not re-emerge in any records until 1956 and was sold and resold through dealers until the Kimbell acquired it.

Fans of the free-flowing attacking play the Czechs unleashed on the rest of Europe two years ago may recall that Nedved's knees have an unusual ""patella tri-partitia"" structure which, as the Czech team doctor Petr Krejci explained at the time, makes him uniquely gifted: ""Most people have a single piece of bone to make their kneecap. One per cent of people have two parts, but three parts? Only Nedved."" This, according to a writer for The Independent covering the Czech run through Euro 2004, ""explained his running style and his ability to retain control of the ball so adeptly in many tight situations"" and also led to much discussion in many European languages of Nedved's knees. Hence, the terror felt by Czech fans -- and neutrals hoping to witness beautiful play over the next few weeks -- every time one of those knees sustains what the British call ""a knock"". -- R.M."

As MDA's top executive for more than 40 years, Bob can be credited with virtually every achievement made by MDA -- the Jerry Lewis Labor Day Telethon, a summer camp program benefiting more than 4,000 kids a year, cutting-edge lifesaving research, a nationwide network of expert-led clinics, and too many other accomplishments to enumerate. With an unwavering commitment to MDA's primary mission of eradicating neuromuscular diseases, Bob pressed staff members and rallied volunteers to do their best. At the same time, he opened his compassionate heart to thousands of families he knew personally whose lives were affected by the more than 40 diseases in MDA's program. Bob Ross was MDA's president and chief executive officer, and much more. His numerous skills created success, his vision made dreams come true, and his deeply caring heart assured that the easing of suffering was always MDA's guiding priority. We extend our deepest condolences to his family, and to the countless members of his MDA family. We're honored to have been his friends.

The executive said he was told the film, which opened on May 19, was withdrawn to make way for locally produced movies. But he noted that another Hollywood film, ''Ice Age: The Meltdown,'' was to be released in China today. Streisand to Tour Barbra Streisand will hit the road next fall in her first national tour since 1994.

In a statement, Ms. Streisand, left, said: ''The increasingly urgent need for private citizen support to combat dangerous climate change, along with education and health issues, was the prime reason I decided to tour again. This will allow me to direct funds and awareness to causes that I care deeply about.'' Dates and cities are to be announced. Handke Rejects Heine Prize The avant-garde Austrian author Peter Handke turned down a German prize for literature before the Düsseldorf city council could vote to revoke it, Agence France-Presse reported. Mr. Handke, below, won the Heinrich Heine prize, valued at $63,000, last month. But last week the council said it would veto the jury's decision because of Mr. Handke's sympathies for the Yugoslav leader Slobodan Milosevic, who died in March in The Hague while on trial for genocide and war crimes. In a letter to Joachim Erwin, Düsseldorf's mayor, Mr. Handke said, ''I am writing to you to spare you and the world from the upcoming sitting of the city council in which they will decide not to give me the prize.'' He added that his action was ''above all to spare my work, which I do not want to become an endless target for the vulgar insults of party politicians.''

''I then plan to travel, write, consult and continue to be an advocate for the art and artists of film and television,'' she said. During her tenure, Ms. Firstenberg, who was named to her post by the board and Charlton Heston, then the organization's chairman, has expanded the institute beyond its founding mission, to train a new generation of filmmakers and preserve the nation's film heritage. It transformed itself from a traditional nonprofit organization significantly financed by the National Endowment for the Arts into a self-sufficient entrepreneurial organization. It also became a major nonprofit film exhibitor, inaugurated significant celebrations of American film and television, acquired an eight-acre Los Angeles campus, opened a theater and culture center outside Washington and established the AFI Los Angeles International Film Festival.

2006-06-09T00:00:00Z,"Is it possible to take a photograph that doesn't hold the eye for at least a few seconds? Apparently not. The human appetite for looking at images of the world, the unending horrors, beauties and banalities of that world, and the ever-more sophisticated technology for manipulating images pretty much guarantee that some attention will be paid. Some: the attention span alternately expands and contracts in ''reGeneration: 50 Photographers of Tomorrow'' at the Aperture Gallery in Chelsea. Selected by William A. Ewing, director of the Musée de L'Elysée in Lausanne, Switzerland, and Nathalie Herschdorfer and Jean-Christophe Blaser, who are associate curators there, it surveys the state of photography through the work of 50 students or recent graduates of 63 art schools or university photography departments in the United States, Canada, Europe and, less frequently, elsewhere. Confirming the fail-safe eye candy of large size, color and expert printing, the show suggests that all photography is essentially surreal: beautiful, disturbing, invasive and more or less contrived. The forms of modern architecture continue to fascinate. Digitalization is here to stay whether in portraiture or nearly abstract images. The distinction between real and manipulated, more staged and less staged is ever more blurred. Among the most compelling images: Pieter Hugo's ''Tem Vleksi, Cape Town,'' above, from a series tracking albinism through Europe, South America and Africa; Mieke van de Voort's heartbreaking images of rooms in which people died alone; and Christoph Bangert's images of life in the Gaza Strip. Perhaps most telling is Carlin Wing's ''Culture Inc.,'' a series that builds on Louise Lawler's images of art at large; it shows the work of famous art-world photographers in corporate settings.

His solo debut at this gallery was a nightmarish environment based on Matisse's ''Red Studio.'' ''Dreams and Nightmares of the African Astronauts'' is a primitivist salon that opens a Pandora's box of artistic and ethical issues. It all began when Mr. Boggio Sella visited an impoverished village in Burkina Faso, bringing books on astronomy and photographs of the 1969 Moon landing. The latter was news to many of the villagers. He then collaborated with local batik makers, mud-cloth painters and woodcarvers to incorporate their new notion of the Moon and the cosmos into their work. In addition to plastering the walls with the results of this effort, he has arranged tourist masks and other objects, some of which he made, in large ethnographic vitrines. In videos, the villagers discuss the Moon landing, sometimes wondering if the money might have been better spent on Earth, and a local man seems to spend a day in a reasonable facsimile of an astronaut's suit."

When Susan Sellers and Michael Rock, founding partners of the SoHo graphic-design firm 2x4, went looking for a second home nine years ago, the answer was obvious: a place like the one where Mr. Rock grew up, a rambling, welcoming old shingle-style house in Warwick, R.I., on Narragansett Bay. The two had relished spending holidays there since they first got together in the late 1980's. That house no longer existed; it had been sold by Mr. Rock's parents and, in 1996, razed (to the family's horror) to make room for a mansion. So the designers put their modernist instincts on ice, pooled their assets with their friend Dan Costa, a Boston-based architect, and went searching for a sweetly funky place in the sun. They set their sights just beyond the bay, on Block Island, where Mr. Rock's parents, both pilots, had flown the couple for one of their first vacations."

2006-06-09T00:00:00Z,"The pianist Taylor Eigsti fits the textbook definition of a jazz prodigy: his first professional experience came at age 8, when he opened a concert for his mentor, the pianist David Benoit. Now 21, Mr. Eigsti, above, has made measurable steps toward artistic adulthood, including his first album on a prominent label (Concord) and his first booking at the Blue Note (next week). The album, ''Lucky to Be Me,'' puts him in the driver's seat of two serious rhythm sections -- including the one that he's touring with, comprising James Genus on bass and Billy Kilson on drums -- and in dialogue with the 18-year-old guitarist Julian Lage, another celebrated prodigy from Northern California and, not coincidentally, one of Mr. Eigsti's best friends. Perhaps as expected, the music is uneven. But the results make a fascinating study regardless, partly because Mr. Eigsti hails from a generation that has absorbed the last wave of new arrivals (like Brad Mehldau) right alongside earlier precursors (like Ahmad Jamal). His furious arrangement of John Coltrane's ''Giant Steps,'' for instance, strongly suggests the early-1990's youngblood Jacky Terrasson Trio; on the next track, a sunny original called ''Get Your Hopes Up,'' his fluidly improvised lines reveal the influence of Mr. Mehldau. Elsewhere Mr. Eigsti's repertory can be a touch callow, as in the case of a Bjork song (a cliché in under-30 jazz circles) and the theme to ''The Sopranos'' (a simple case of bad judgment). But those are small offenses; fortunately Mr. Eigsti is no small talent.

She is best known for her installations of L.E.D. panels that dispense her dark cryptic writings in scrolling ribbons of light. Now, in very different gallery shows, Ms. Holzer concentrates on other people's words and modes of presentation that feel familiar, if not a little tired. At Lambert, large color photographs document public pieces in which the words of an assortment of contemporary poets were projected on imposing public buildings, including the New York Public Library. The appearance of highly personal language on impersonal edifices at night, has sinister overtones, but the effect is generally snoozy.

But architecture enthusiasts and cranks alike can certainly take its measure in the weeks and months ahead. Perhaps the optimum view of the 46-story building, with its bold ''diagrid'' design, is from a distance. The southwestern portion of Central Park, including Long Meadow, as well as certain spots on the Upper East Side of Manhattan, like the roof of the Metropolitan Museum of Art, offer vistas of the tower.

2006-06-09T00:00:00Z,"8 P.M. (Animal Planet) MEERKAT MANOR -- They sure look cute. But there's a reason a meerkat family (above) is called a mob. This new series, filmed across a 10-year Cambridge University study, follows the interplay -- the squabbles, the love affairs, the backstabbing and self-sacrifice worthy of ''King Lear'' -- among the Whiskers, a group of meerkats in the Kalahari Desert in southern Africa whose matriarch, Flower, is anything but sweet. 8 P.M. (History Channel) BUILDING IN THE NAME OF GOD -- This ''Time Machine'' episode looks at the divine inspiration -- not to mention the innovative design and engineering -- behind some of the most important churches of the Italian Renaissance, including the Duomo in Florence, the Santa Maria Delle Grazie in Milan and St. Peter's in Rome. 8 P.M. (AMC) THE MAN FROM SNOWY RIVER (1982). In this expansive ode to the mythology of the Australian outback, a fatherless young man trades the mountains of his childhood for the lowlands, falls in love and is accused of releasing a prize stallion along the way. And Kirk Douglas faces quite an acting challenge in dual roles as twin brothers who haven't spoken for years -- that is, until their 20-year-old feud heats up again. 9 P.M.

Where are those meerkats (see above) when you need them? 10 P.M. (CMT) UNSUNG -- A woman is reunited with the daughter she gave up for adoption, and one of the outcomes is Jeffrey Steele and Kip Raines's song ''A Long Way Around,'' in this series in which songwriters use real-life events as inspiration. 10:30 P.M. (Turner Classic Movies) THE PRINCESS AND THE PIRATE (1944). Before Johnny Depp and Keira Knightley in ''Pirates of the Caribbean,'' there was this madcap pseudo-period piece about a princess (Virginia Mayo) traveling incognito to elope with her true love who runs into trouble on the high seas -- and the errant knight (Bob Hope, in one of his funniest roles) -- who will save her. 11:35 P.M.

2006-06-09T00:00:00Z,"The Smithsonian Institution announced yesterday that its counsel to the inspector general and assistant inspector general for investigations, A. Sprightley Ryan, would become acting inspector general on Sunday. Ms. Ryan joined the institution in October 2003 after serving as a prosecutor on environmental cases at the Justice Department. She will temporarily replace Debra S. Ritt, who submitted her resignation last month to take a senior executive position in the audit office of the Small Business Administration. Ms. Ritt had complained that declining resources and manpower for her office had lessened its effectiveness and independence. Sheila P. Burke, the Smithsonian's deputy secretary and chief operating officer, said that officials were assembling a search committee to fill the inspector general position permanently. ''We want to ensure that there is no halt in the work that this important office is doing,'' she said. The inspector general's office was established at the institution in 1989 to conduct independent investigations of its operations. JOHN FILES"
2006-06-09T00:00:00Z,"In early 2004, 13 mostly unknown playwrights decided to strike back. Sick of the endless process of developing plays that tie up work for years, these writers, who included Anne Washburn, Sarah Ruhl and Young Jean Lee, organized 13P, a company created to defend the much-abused playwright. Its shows put the control firmly in the hands of the writers, who are the artistic directors of their own work, casting it, choosing the director and helping find a stage. Forget about all those readings and workshops. 13P's slogan is, ''We don't develop plays. (We do them).'' Apparently, they weren't kidding. Despite the challenges facing the creation of any new play -- finding money and space, to start -- 13P has in the last month produced three new plays. (The plan is to mount one work by all 13 playwrights before 2010.) While displaying a diversity of style, subject matter and success, the shows all appear refreshingly undiluted and uncompromised, which can be a mixed blessing. Kate E. Ryan's ''Mark Smith,'' a raw mockumentary about the life of a 1980's pop star, could use some more shaping, and Gary Winter's ''At Said,'' which recently closed, was desperately in need of an editor's pen. But it's hard to argue with the success of Sheila Callaghan's appealingly ambitious ''Dead City,'' above, with Dan Illian and Elizabeth Norment. It is an uncompromising, melancholic riff on ''Ulysses.'' Perhaps the rough edges of the stylized, evocative language or motley crew of urban archetypes would have been sanded off in development. We should be glad they weren't. (''Dead City'' is playing at 3LD Art & Technology Center, 80 Greenwich Street, Lower Manhattan, through June 24. ''Mark Smith'' is at Walker Space, 46 Walker Street, TriBeCa, through June 24. For both, call 212-868-4444.) JASON ZINOMAN"
2006-06-09T00:00:00Z,"An Alien Eye: And Other Killah Anthems Sikkema Jenkins & Company 530 West 22nd Street, Chelsea Through June 17 The multitalented artist Wangechi Mutu has a few too many options under consideration, with mixed results. Her large collage-ink paintings on Mylar, depicting bejeweled and befeathered African beauties with gorgeously mottled complexions and strange faces cavorting among tall, serpentine grasses, have become technically overwrought. Their evocation of the objectification of the wild and exotic other is approaching the kinky seductiveness of the fashion spreads that are among the things they seek to indict. Two sculptures involving antique chairs on improvised stilts and upended wine bottles dripping wine and trimmed with fur are dully generic. These offer a foretaste of ''Exhuming Gluttony: A Lover's Requiem,'' Ms. Mutu's over-the-top installation, a collaboration with the British architect David Adjaye, at Salon 94 on East 94th Street in Manhattan. Incorporating many more dripping, fur-lined wine bottles, animal skins and an enormous raw-wood table with scores of legs, the piece is a cross between a morgue, a massacre, a tannery and a banquet hall. It brings the excess and color of Ms. Mutu's Mylar paintings into real space, which is an accomplishment, but like many elaborate artists' projects and installations these days, its main message seems to be: I built this because I can."

The menu wears the label ''contemporary American,'' which means a little French, a little Italian and a lot of seasonal produce. 149 Broadway, at Bedford Avenue, Williamsburg, Brooklyn; (718) 384-6343.

But what makes it even more special is that it could stand alone as a fetching brasserie with accomplished (although inconsistent) food, including first-rate sausages, a satisfying choucroute garnie, a warm potato salad like no other and terrific desserts. It's a sturdy restaurant, not just a gimmicky one, and won't be beer today and gone tomorrow. 1695 Second Avenue, at 88th Street, Manhattan,; (212) 722-5133.

And uniting the two levels is the menu and cooking of Sascha Lyon, whose American and Continental standard-bearers seem to channel the spirit of a Midwestern hotel. It's an odd and uneventful restaurant, but an often enjoyable one, with a rack of lamb (upstairs) and double burger (downstairs) that prompt no complaints. 55 Gansevoort Street, at Ninth Avenue, meatpacking district; (212) 989-1920.

2006-06-09T00:00:00Z,"An obituary on Wednesday about Claude Terrail, former proprietor of the Paris restaurant La Tour d'Argent, reversed the marriages that produced his surviving son and daughter and misstated the given name of his daughter. His son, André, is from his second marriage, not his first; his daughter, from his first marriage, is Anne, not Barbara."
2006-06-09T00:00:00Z,To the Editor: Don't get me wrong: I am glad to hear the news that Abu Musab al-Zarqawi has been killed. It is to be hoped that his death will result in the saving of American and Iraqi lives.
2006-06-09T00:00:00Z,"Acquisitions of commercial REIT's - real estate investment trusts - have been growing, as evidenced by this week's buyout of Trizec Properties and its sister company, Trizec Canada. The deal making points to confidence that demand for office space will be strong."
2006-06-09T00:00:00Z,"Hudson Franklin 508 West 26th Street, Chelsea Through June 17 Anne Thompson, a Brooklyn resident having her first solo exhibition, gives a sweet, neo-hippie spin to 60's-style Op and grid painting. On medium-large canvases in many colors, Ms. Thompson paints vibrant, all-over, candy-color plaid patterns. In each, an abstract, possibly scientific symbol, like a pair of intersecting ovals or concentric, bisected circles, emerges from the plaid field by small shifts of hue and shade. Ms. Thompson applies paint smoothly and keeps her edges sharp, but the intersecting lines of the plaid pattern are slightly wobbly, giving the paintings a folksy look. They might have been made by a quiltmaker who had a close encounter with extraterrestrial or supernatural beings."
2006-06-09T00:00:00Z,"An article on May 18 about the events that led to the fatal stabbing of Edwin Owusu-Hammond, a 15-year-old Bronx boy, misidentified the area that includes University Heights, the neighborhood where the two 13-year-old boys accused of the killing live. It is the western Bronx, not the South Bronx."
2006-06-09T00:00:00Z,"FROM JORDAN TO INFAMY -- Abu Musab al-Zarqawi was something of a phantom to the American military, to the Iraqi people and to those who grew up with him in Jordan.

2006-06-09T00:00:00Z,"To the Editor: Re: ''Second Homes That Put Ecology First'': These stories fascinate me because they always invite consideration of the larger question: ''What does it mean to be green?'' Perhaps one can live large and think green, but the inherent conflict of values will be an ever-present challenge of choice. The irony of an Andover, Mass., family driving to a former four-car garage in Kirby, Vt., most weekends and on vacations is best summarized by Ms. Eikenberry: ''We drive up here in a Subaru. You make choices all along the way, and anything you do right is better than not doing it.'' Not really. 36 years ago, I worked on the first Earth Day in Madison, Wis. Our theme in 1970: Lifestyle on Trial. That trial continues in 2006 as we rationalize our consumption of land and resources as conservation. Green is an admirable goal, but one can't guzzle gas to get there. Michael Sievers Portland, Ore."
2006-06-09T00:00:00Z,"Fox's ''So You Think You Can Dance'' was Wednesday's most-watched show, with 10.4 million viewers in Nielsen's estimates. The mean-spirited dance competition led Fox to a victory in total viewers and among adults 18 to 49; it also drew the highest 18-to-34 ratings of any show so far this summer season. But NBC was No. 1 in households for the night. Its two-hour ''Dateline: To Catch a Predator'' delivered 7.8 million viewers, and a ''Law & Order'' rerun brought in 7.9 million. CBS's ''Game Show Marathon'' is proving to be no ''Deal or No Deal'' ratings-wise. It attracted 6.9 million viewers at 8 p.m. and dragged down the rest of CBS's schedule, reruns of ''Criminal Minds'' (8 million) and ''CSI: New York'' (9.3 million). Sunday's season finale of ''The Sopranos'' drew 8.9 million viewers. That was a drop from its last season-ender, in June 2004, which brought in an audience of just under 11 million. The show returned this year after a long hiatus. KATE AURTHUR"

2006-06-09T00:00:00Z,"WHO -- Jim Farrelly, 42, a stay-at-home father from Augusta, Ga. WHERE -- Tybee Island, Ga. WHAT -- 4-bedroom house The kayaking options are endless here. I can paddle along the mouth of the Savannah River near Fort Pulaski and watch the containerships come in, or go over to Little Tybee Island and go through canals accessible only at high tide. My wife is an Army surgeon and works very long hours, so when she is in a kayak, she just likes to drift. I'll plan our trips to the tide so we will drift along the Back River on Tybee, and when the tide changes we'll float back home. My first trip in a kayak was seven years ago in Key West on an eco-tour. I later bought two kayaks. A few years ago I decided to buy a kayak kit and build my own. Planks of plywood are joined by copper wire, and when it looks like a boat it's ready. Then you sand it and put fiberglass on the inside and outside of the kayak. One of my favorite trips is to an area between Tybee and Little Tybee that the locals call the triangle. It's the equivalent of skiing down four-foot moguls. Hurricanes have also passed near Tybee creating big swells. One day I was out on the water as a storm passed with a couple of guys, some younger than me including one ex-Navy diver. We surfed down the six- to eight-foot waves and had the time of our lives spitting sand. Of course there is a big difference between 42 years old and 30 years old, and I spent most of the next day drooling on the couch."

Second Stage, 307 West 43rd Street, Clinton, (212) 246-4422. Broadway * 'AWAKE AND SING!' Dreams and disappointments, hopes and fears, encouraging words and bitter put-downs clash by day and night in Clifford Odets's turbulent comedy-drama about a Jewish family struggling to stay afloat in the 1930's. A gifted roster of performers -- including Mark Ruffalo, Lauren Ambrose, Zoë Wanamaker and Ben Gazzara -- manage to locate the dreaming centers of their characters, buried beneath layers of political sloganeering, everyday gripes or street slang. And even when the focus occasionally blurs in Bartlett Sher's ultimately moving revival, Odets's zesty dialogue, in which jazzy period colloquialisms are slung around like punches at a prize fight, is a joy to hear (2:30). Belasco Theater, 111 West 44th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Charles Isherwood) * 'BRIDGE & TUNNEL' This delightful solo show, written and performed by Sarah Jones, is a sweet-spirited valentine to New York City, its polyglot citizens and the larger notion of an all-inclusive America. In 90 minutes of acutely observed portraiture gently tinted with humor, Ms. Jones plays more than a dozen men and women participating in an open-mike evening of poetry for immigrants (1:30). Helen Hayes Theater, 240 West 44th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Isherwood) 'THE COLOR PURPLE' So much plot, so many years, so many characters to cram into less than three hours. This beat-the-clock musical adaptation of Alice Walker's Pulitzer Prize-winning novel about Southern black women finding their inner warriors never slows down long enough for you to embrace it. LaChanze leads the vibrant, hard-working cast (2:40). Broadway Theater, 1681 Broadway, at 53rd Street, (212) 239-6200.(Ben Brantley) 'DIRTY ROTTEN SCOUNDRELS' The arrival of Jonathan Pryce and his eloquent eyebrows automatically makes this the season's most improved musical. With Mr. Pryce (who replaces the admirable but uneasy John Lithgow) playing the silken swindler to Norbert Leo Butz's vulgar grifter, it's as if a mismatched entry in a three-legged race had become an Olympic figure-skating pair (2:35). Imperial Theater, 249 West 45th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley) 'THE DROWSY CHAPERONE' This small and ingratiating spoof of 1920's stage frolics, as imagined by an obsessive show queen, may not be a masterpiece. But in a dry season for musicals, ''The Drowsy Chaperone'' has theatergoers responding as if they were withering house plants, finally being watered after long neglect. Bob Martin and Sutton Foster are the stand-outs in the eager, energetic cast (1:40). Marquis Theater, 1535 Broadway, at 45th Street, (212) 307-4100. (Brantley) *'FAITH HEALER' In the title role of Brian Friel's great play, Ralph Fiennes paints a portrait of the artist as dreamer and destroyer that feels both as old as folklore and so fresh that it might be painted in wet blood. Also starring Cherry Jones and the superb Ian McDiarmid, this mesmerizing series of monologues has been directed with poetic starkness by Jonathan Kent (2:35). Booth Theater, 222 West 45th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley) * 'THE HISTORY BOYS' Madly enjoyable. Alan's Bennett's play about a battle for the hearts and minds of a group of university-bound students, imported with the original British cast from the National Theater, moves with a breezy narrative swagger that transcends cultural barriers. Directed by Nicholas Hytner, with a perfectly oiled ensemble led by the superb Richard Griffiths and Stephen Campbell Moore as schoolmasters with opposing views of history and education (2:40). Broadhurst Theater, 235 West 44th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley) 'HOT FEET' A dancing encyclopedia of clichés set to the music of Earth, Wind and Fire. Numbing (2:30). Hilton Theater, 213 West 42nd Street, (212) 307-4100. (Isherwood) 'JERSEY BOYS' From grit to glamour with the Four Seasons, directed by the pop repackager Des McAnuff (''The Who's Tommy''). The real thrill of this shrink-wrapped bio-musical, for those who want something more than recycled chart toppers and a story line poured from a can, is watching the wonderful John Lloyd Young (as Frankie Valli) cross the line from exact impersonation into something far more compelling (2:30). August Wilson Theater, 245 West 52nd Street, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley) * 'THE LIEUTENANT OF INISHMORE' Please turn off your political correctness monitor along with your cellphone for Martin McDonagh's gleeful, gory and appallingly entertaining play. This blood farce about terrorism in rural Ireland, acutely directed by Wilson Milam, has a carnage factor to rival Quentin Tarantino's. But it is also wildly, absurdly funny and, even more improbably, severely moral (1:45). Lyceum Theater, 149 West 45th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley) 'THE LIGHT IN THE PIAZZA' Love is a many-flavored thing, from sugary to sour, in Adam Guettel and Craig Lucas's encouragingly ambitious and discouragingly unfulfilled new musical. The show soars only in the sweetly bitter songs performed by the wonderful Victoria Clark, as an American abroad (2:15). Beaumont Theater, Lincoln Center, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley) * 'THE PAJAMA GAME' Sexual chemistry in a Broadway musical? Isn't that illegal now? If it were, then Harry Connick Jr. and Kelli O'Hara -- the white-hot stars of Kathleen Marshall's delicious revival of this 1954 musical -- would be looking at long jail terms. This intoxicating production, which features a charming supporting cast led by Michael McKean, allows grown-up audiences the rare chance to witness a bona fide adult love affair translated into hummable songs and sprightly dance (2:30). American Airlines Theater, 227 West 42nd Street, (212) 719-1300. (Brantley) *'SHINING CITY' Quiet, haunting and absolutely glorious. Conor McPherson's impeccably assembled ghost story about being alone in the crowded city of Dublin has been brought to American shores with a first-rate cast (Brian F. O'Byrne, Oliver Platt, Martha Plimpton and Peter Scanavino), directed by Robert Falls (1:45). Biltmore Theater, 261 West 47th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley) * 'SWEENEY TODD' Sweet dreams, New York. This thrilling new revival of Stephen Sondheim and Hugh Wheeler's musical, with Michael Cerveris and Patti LuPone leading a cast of 10 who double as their own musicians, burrows into your thoughts like a campfire storyteller who knows what really scares you. The inventive director John Doyle aims his pared-down interpretation at the squirming child in everyone who wants to have his worst fears both confirmed and dispelled (2:30). Eugene O'Neill Theater, 230 West 49th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley) 'TARZAN' This writhing green blob with music, adapted by Disney Theatrical Productions from the 1999 animated film, has the feeling of a super-deluxe day-care center, equipped with lots of bungee cords and karaoke synthesizers, where kids can swing when they get tired of singing, and vice versa. The soda-pop score is by Phil Collins (2:30). Richard Rodgers Theater, 226 West 46th Street, (212) 307-4747. (Brantley) 'THREE DAYS OF RAIN' In this revival of Richard Greenberg's slender, elegant drama of family disconnectedness, Julia Roberts is stiff with self-consciousness, glancingly acquainted with the two characters she plays and deeply, disturbingly beautiful. Otherwise, it is almost impossible to discern the virtues of the play itself in this wooden and splintered production, directed by Joe Mantello and also starring Paul Rudd and Bradley Cooper, who have little chance of capturing the audience's attention (2:30). Bernard B. Jacobs Theater, 242 West 45th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley) 'THE THREEPENNY OPERA' Presented as a long, pansexual orgy, Scott Elliot's numbing revival of the Brecht-Weill classic feels like a party where the hangover begins almost as soon as the evening does. The starry cast includes Alan Cumming (as Mac the Knife) and a Dietrich-like Cyndi Lauper, though only Jim Dale and Nellie McKay appear to have a clue as to what the show is about (2:40). Studio 54, 254 West 54th Street, (212) 719-1300. (Brantley) * 'THE 25TH ANNUAL PUTNAM COUNTY SPELLING BEE' The happy news for this happy-making little musical is that the move to larger quarters has dissipated none of its quirky charm. William Finn's score sounds plumper and more rewarding than it did on Off Broadway, providing a sprinkling of sugar to complement the sass in Rachel Sheinkin's zinger-filled book. The performances are flawless. Gold stars all around (1:45). Circle in the Square, 1633 Broadway, at 50th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Isherwood) 'THE WEDDING SINGER' An assembly-kit musical that might as well be called ''That 80's Show,'' this stage version of the 1998 film is all winks and nods and quotations from the era of big hair and junk bonds. The cast members, who include Stephen Lynch and Laura Benanti, are personable enough, which is not the same as saying they have personalities (2:20). Al Hirschfeld Theater, 302 West 45th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley) Off Broadway 'ASSISTED LOVING' This warm and witty monologue by Bob Morris, who contributes the Age of Dissonance column to the Sunday Styles section of The New York Times, is performed by the author, who chronicles his widowed father's and his own search for love in and around New York. Engaging, subtle and winning (1:10). Daryl Roth Theater, D-Lounge, 103 East 15th Street, at Union Square, (212) 239-6200. (George Hunka) * 'BILLY CONNOLLY LIVE!' This popular comedian will remind you of a Scottish George Carlin, with a bit of Eddie Izzard mixed in (2:00). 37 Arts, 450 West 37th Street, (212) 307-4100. (Jason Zinoman) 'CAGE LOVE' The new thriller by Christopher Denham -- star of ''Red Light Winter'' -- is a compulsively watchable, sometimes ridiculous drama about a man who becomes increasingly suspicious of his wife-to-be (1:30). Rattlestick Theater, 224 Waverly Place, Greenwich Village, (212) 868-4444. (Zinoman) 'CIRQUE DU SOLEIL -- CORTEO' The Cirque du Soleil's latest extravaganza, which upholds the ubiquitous Cirque standard, is a fantasy of a dead (though cheerful) clown imagining his own funeral. Unsurprisingly, his cortege is full of circus acts (2:30). Grand Chapiteau at Randall's Island, (800) 678-5440. (John Rockwell) 'DARK YELLOW' Elias Koteas and Tina Benko star in this compelling one-act psychological thriller about a one-night stand that involves one shocking revelation after another (1:35). Studio Dante, 257 West 29th Street, Chelsea, (212) 868-4444. (Anita Gates) * 'FORBIDDEN BROADWAY: SPECIAL VICTIMS UNIT' This production features the expected caricatures of ego-driven singing stars. But even more than usual, the show offers an acute list of grievances about the sickly state of the Broadway musical, where, as the lyrics have it, ''everything old is old again'' (1:45). Performances resume on Monday. 47th Street Theater, 304 West 47th Street, Clinton, (212) 239-6200.(Brantley) 'THE GOLD STANDARD' A successful alumnus, his trophy girlfriend and an eccentric Korean professor form a romantic triangle at a campus bar in Daniel Roberts's drama, which is occasionally original but often downright odd (2:30). The Irish Arts Center, 553 West 51st Street, Clinton, (212) 868-4444. (Gates) 'JACQUES BREL IS ALIVE AND WELL AND LIVING IN PARIS' A powerfully sung revival of the 1968 revue, presented with affectionate nostalgia by the director Gordon Greenberg. As in the original, two men (Robert Cuccioli and Rodney Hicks) and two women (Natascia Diaz and Gay Marshall) perform a wide selection of Brel's plaintive ballads and stirring anthems. Ms. Marshall's captivating performance of ''Ne Me Quitte Pas,'' sung in the original French and with heart-stirring transparency, represents Brel at his best (2:00). Zipper Theater, 336 West 37th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Isherwood) 'NO CHILD' Teachers will love Nilaja Sun's one-woman show about the challenges of teaching drama at Malcolm X High School (1:10). Beckett Theater at Theater Row, 410 West 42nd Street, Clinton, (212) 279-4200. (Gates) 'NOT A GENUINE BLACK MAN' Brian Copeland's solo memoir about his African-American family moving into a white suburb in the early 1970's is an engaging, if stiltedly performed, show (1:30). DR2 Theater, 103 East 15th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Zinoman) 'RED LIGHT WINTER' A frank, occasionally graphic story of erotic fixation and the havoc it can wreak on sensitive types. Written and directed by Adam Rapp, this play is both a doomy romantic drama and a morbid comedy about the anxieties of male friendship. Although somewhat contrived, it features a lovely performance by Christopher Denham as a lonely soul starved for intimacy (2:25). Barrow Street Theater, 27 Barrow Street, West Village, (212) 239-6200. (Isherwood) 'SANDRA BERNHARD: EVERYTHING BAD AND BEAUTIFUL' Sandra Bernhard was a proverbial rock star long before headline-making folks in even the most prosaic walks of life were being referred to as such. Her new show, a collection of songs interspersed with musings on her life and on public figures ranging from Britney Spears to Condoleezza Rice, is casual to the point of being offhand. That said, it's invigorating to be in the presence of a true original (2:00). Daryl Roth Theater, 101 East 15th Street, at Union Square, (212) 239-6200. (Isherwood) * 'STUFF HAPPENS' Daniel Sullivan's sharp, invigorating production of David Hare's journalistic drama about the road to war in Iraq is conducted on the modest scale of a town-hall meeting. The characters (who have names like Bush and Blair) seem less like destiny-shaping gods than the ego trippers in your office. If that means they're too close for comfort, then ''Stuff Happens'' is doing its job (2:50). The Public Theater, 425 Lafayette Street, at Astor Place, East Village, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley) 'TEMPEST TOSSED FOOLS' This musical audience-participation children's version of ''The Tempest'' is rowdy, colorful and not all that Shakespearean. Manhattan Ensemble Theater, 55 Mercer Street, SoHo, (212) 239-6200. (Gates) 'TRYST' A suspense drama of a distinctly old-fashioned stamp about the romance between a handsome cad (Maxwell Caulfield) and a lonely spinster (Amelia Campbell). Will the wily predator seduce and abandon the mousy milliner? Karoline Leach's play springs a few twists that lack psychological credibility but keep the plot on the boil (2:00). Promenade Theater, 2162 Broadway, at 76th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Isherwood) Off Off Broadway 'AIN'T SUPPOSED TO DIE A NATURAL DEATH' Melvin Van Peebles's 1971 Tony-nominated musical, ''Ain't Supposed to Die a Natural Death,'' isn't so much performed at the club T New York, as erupted, like some sort of streetwise lava flow. This early precursor to hip-hop, rap and poetry slams is a get-down, roiling depiction of ghetto life, and we're not talking urbane bling (1:30) T New York, 240 West 52nd Street, (212) 352-3101. (Phoebe Hoban) 'BACK OF THE THROAT' An Arab-American playwright (Yussef El Guindi) addressing the harassment of Arab-Americans after 9/11? Interesting. But the play would have been even more interesting if the harassers were something other than cardboard characters out of the J. Edgar Hoover closet (1:15). Flea Theater, 41 White Street, TriBeCa, (212) 352-3101. (Neil Genzlinger) 'HAM LAKE' A gregarious 20-something man reveals more than he intends to in this 80-minute seriocomic barroom monologue by Sam Rosen and Nat Bennett. Mr. Rosen is a wry and skilled earbender. Huron Club at the SoHo Playhouse, 15 Vandam Street, South Village, (212) 691-1555. (Hunka) * 'WAITING FOR GODOT' Vladimir (Wendell Pierce) and Estragon (J. Kyle Manzay) wait and wait, but in this version they're soaking wet, their desolate plot being surrounded by water. A familiar play is injected with surprises (2:00). Harlem School for the Arts, 645 St. Nicholas Avenue, near 141st Street, Hamilton Heights, (212) 864-4444. (Genzlinger) Long-Running Shows * 'ALTAR BOYZ' This sweetly satirical show about a Christian pop group made up of five potential Teen People cover boys is an enjoyable, silly diversion (1:30). New World Stages, 340 West 50th Street, Clinton, (212) 239-6200.(Isherwood) 'AVENUE Q' R-rated puppets give lively life lessons (2:10). Golden, 252 West 45th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley) 'BEAUTY AND THE BEAST' Cartoon made flesh, sort of (2:30). Lunt-Fontanne Theater, 205 West 46th Street, (212) 307-4747. (Brantley) 'CHICAGO' Irrefutable proof that crime pays (2:25). Ambassador Theater, 219 West 49th Street, (212) 239-6200.(Brantley) 'DOUBT, A PARABLE' (Pulitzer Prize, Best Play 2005, and Tony Award, Best Play 2005) John Patrick Shanley makes subversive use of musty conventions in the clash between the head of a parochial school and the young priest who may or may not be too fond of the boys in his charge (1:30). Walter Kerr Theater, 219 West 48th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley) 'HAIRSPRAY' Fizzy pop, cute kids, large man in a housedress (2:30). Neil Simon Theater, 250 West 52nd Street, (212) 307-4100. (Brantley) 'THE LION KING' Disney on safari, where the big bucks roam (2:45). Resumes performances on Tuesday at the Minskoff Theater, 200 West 45th Street at Broadway, (212) 307-4100. (Brantley) 'MAMMA MIA!' The jukebox that devoured Broadway (2:20). Cadillac Winter Garden Theater, 1634 Broadway, at 50th Street, (212) 239-6200.

(Brantley) 'THE PRODUCERS' The ne plus ultra of showbiz scams (2:45). St. James Theater, 246 West 44th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley) 'RENT' East Village angst and love songs to die for (2:45). Nederlander Theater, 208 West 41st Street, (212) 307-4100. (Brantley) 'SLAVA'S SNOWSHOW' Clowns chosen by the Russian master Slava Polunin are stirring up laughter and enjoyment. A show that touches the heart as well as tickles the funny bone (1:30). Union Square Theater, 100 East 17th Street, Flatiron district, (212) 307-4100.(Lawrence Van Gelder) 'SPAMALOT' (Tony Award, Best Musical 2005) This staged re-creation of the mock-medieval movie ''Monty Python and the Holy Grail'' is basically a singing scrapbook for Python fans. Such a good time is being had by so many people that this fitful, eager celebration of inanity and irreverence has found a large and lucrative audience (2:20). Shubert Theater, 225 West 44th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley) 'WICKED' Oz revisited, with political corrections (2:45). Gershwin Theater, 222 West 51st Street, (212) 307-4100. (Brantley) Last Chance 'BEAU BRUMMELL' Ian Kelly is funny, engaging and intensely sympathetic as the early-19th-century British fashion plate who spent his last years in exile (1:30). 59E59 Theaters, 59 East 59th Street, (212) 279-4200; closing on Sunday. (Gates) 'COLUMBINUS' The grim ecosphere of the average American high school is analyzed with sympathy and precision in this new play by Stephen Karam and P J Paparelli, which aims to expose the cultural and personal pathologies that gave rise to the horrific events in Littleton, Colo., in 1999, when two students went on a murderous rampage at Columbine High School, killing a dozen students and a teacher before killing themselves. Well acted and stylishly directed, the play exudes earnestness, and a measure of self-importance, too (2:00). New York Theater Workshop, 79 East Fourth Street, East Village, (212) 239-6200; closing on Sunday. (Isherwood) 'HAMLET' Theater by the Blind's modest, pared-down production offers an angry, sarcastic prince; an Ophelia who won't stop singing; and a Polonius who actually seems to know what he's saying (2:15). Theater Five, 311 West 43rd Street, Clinton, (212) 868-4444; closing on Sunday. (Gates) 'HERAKLES VIA PHAEDRA' Making her annual excursion into Greek myth and history, Ellen Stewart presents the labors of Herakles and the tragedies of Theseus with an exhilarating, rough-hewn mix of flamenco, wildly beautiful puppets, acrobatic combat between men and magical beasts and a classical South Indian dance performed with a live snake (1:30). La MaMa E.T.C. Annex, 66 East Fourth Street, East Village, (212) 475-7710; closing on Sunday. (Miriam Horn) 'TROUT STANLEY' Claudia Dey's hysterically funny, deliciously lyrical piece of Canadian Gothic is about strange 30-year-old twin sisters and the mysterious man who arrives, D. H. Lawrence style, to upset the household's delicate balance (1:50). Culture Project, 45 Bleecker Street, at Lafayette Street, East Village, (212) 868-4444; closing on Sunday.

'AKEELAH AND THE BEE' (PG, 112 minutes) Eleven-year-old Akeelah Anderson (Keke Palmer) is a bright but unmotivated girl who can outspell anyone at her South Los Angeles middle school. When Akeelah gets a taste of victory by winning the school bee, she throws herself into studying for the regional one, coached by a stern English professor named Joshua Larabee (Laurence Fishburne). But Akeelah's mother (Angela Bassett) objects to her daughter's obsession with what she considers a ''game.'' The innate suspense and charm of the spelling bee, along with a trio of crack performances, turn what is, in essence, a formulaic picture into something more satisfying: an underdog tale that inspires without being sappy. (Dana Stevens) * 'AN INCONVENIENT TRUTH' (PG, 96 minutes) Al Gore gives a lecture on climate change. One of the most exciting and necessary movies of the year. Seriously. (A. O. Scott) * 'ARMY OF SHADOWS' (No rating, 140 minutes, in French) Dark as pitch and without compromise, Jean-Pierre Melville's 1969 masterpiece centers on the feats of a small band of Resistance fighters during the occupation. Brilliant, harrowing, essential viewing.(Manohla Dargis) 'ART SCHOOL CONFIDENTIAL' (R, 102 minutes) A lump of misanthropy from Terry Zwigoff and Daniel Clowes, who made the sublime ''Ghost World.'' This time they plod through a grouchy attack on the pretense and hypocrisy of self-declared artists. John Malkovich's performance as a drawing instructor is sly and insightful, a glimpse at what the movie might have been. (Scott) 'THE BREAK-UP' (PG-13, 105 minutes) Jennifer Aniston and Vince Vaughn split up and share custody of a Chicago condominium. Dull and cheerless, notwithstanding a handful of funny supporting turns, notably from Judy Davis and Jason Bateman. (Scott) * 'CAVITE' (No rating, 80 minutes, in English and Tagalog) Terrorism and cultural identity are only two of the themes wound into a tight knot of fear and bewilderment in this gripping, no-budget political thriller shot on the fly with hand-held cameras that scour the teeming streets and squatter shacks of Cavite, a city on the outskirts of Manila. (Stephen Holden) * 'CLEAN' (R, 110 minutes) This fine French movie, written and directed by Olivier Assayas, is one of the few fictional films to evoke realistically the grubby texture of existence for second- and third-tier rock celebrities crumbling under a combination of fading renown and drug addiction. Maggie Cheung and Nick Nolte offer memorable portrayals as a recovering junkie and her compassionate father-in-law. (Holden) 'THE CULT OF THE SUICIDE BOMBER' (No rating, 96 minutes) An engrossing if intellectually thin made-for-British-television documentary that purports to explain how suicide bombing -- which its narrator, Robert Baer, likens to a ''pathological virus'' -- evolved from a weapon of war into a weapon of terror and, finally in Iraq, a ''weapon of chaos.'' (Dargis) 'THE DA VINCI CODE' (PG-13, 148 minutes) Theology aside, ''The Da Vinci Code'' is, above all, a murder mystery. And as such, once it gets going, Ron Howard's movie has its pleasures. He and the screenwriter Akiva Goldsman have deftly rearranged some elements of the plot, unkinking a few overelaborate twists and introducing others that keep the action moving along. The movie does, however, take a while to accelerate, popping the clutch and leaving rubber on the road as it tries to establish who is who, what he's doing and why. So I certainly can't support any calls for boycotting or protesting this busy, trivial, inoffensive film. Which is not to say that I'm recommending that you go see it. (Scott) * 'DOWN IN THE VALLEY' (R, 114 minutes) This allegorical neo-western set in the San Fernando Valley has dreams as big as the fantasies that consume its protagonist, a Stetson-wearing suburban cowboy (Edward Norton) who is not what he appears to be. How much you like it will depend on your appetite for the kind of cultural metaphors that David Jacobson flings onto the screen with a reckless abandon. (Holden) * 'INSIDE MAN' (R, 128 minutes) The latest from Spike Lee takes a familiar setup -- a Wall Street bank heist that mutates into a hostage crisis -- and twists it ever so slightly and nicely. Among the film's most sustained pleasures are its holy trinity -- Denzel Washington, Clive Owen and Jodie Foster -- and the best lineup of pusses and mugs outside ''The Sopranos.'' (Dargis) 'THE KING' (R, 105 minutes) James Marsh uses clichés and some lived-in emotions and atmosphere for his fitfully engaging, exasperating film about a young Mexican-American (Gael García Bernal) whose search for his patrimony leads him into the bosom of a deeply religious Texas family (headed by a very fine William Hurt). (Dargis) * 'LA MOUSTACHE' (No rating, 86 minutes, in French) Emmanuel Carrière's psychological mystery prepares you to bask in one of those sexy, bittersweet marital comedies that are a hallmark of sophisticated French cinema. Then, by degrees, it subverts those expectations to spiral down a rabbit hole of ambiguity and doubt. (Holden) * 'L'ENFANT (THE CHILD)' (R, 100 minutes, in French) The latest from the Belgian brothers Jean-Pierre and Luc Dardenne involves a young thief (Jérémie Renier) who one day sells his newborn son for a fat envelope of cash. What interests the Dardennes is not only how a man would sell a child as casually as a slab of beef, but also whether a man like this, having committed such a repellent offense, can find redemption. (Dargis) 'MISSION: IMPOSSIBLE III' (PG-13, 126 minutes) Er, this time it's personal, as Tom Cruise plays a dashing operative for a clandestine organization who sweeps a simpering brunette off her feet. Directed, without much flair, by J. J. Abrams, the small-screen auteur behind ''Lost'' and ''Alias.'' (Dargis) 'THE OMEN' (R, 110 minutes) The supremely unnecessary remake of ''The Omen,'' the 1976 horror show that, along with ''Rosemary's Baby'' and ''The Exorcist,'' plunked everyone's favorite baddie, Satan, into the Hollywood mainstream, wants to capitalize on the tabloid theology in the air. But for a few contemporary touches (the World Trade Center in flames as a portent of Armageddon) it slavishly recycles the original. (Holden) 'OVER THE HEDGE' (PG, 83 minutes) This tale about some woodland critters threatened by their new human neighbors has the technical trappings of a worthwhile Saturday matinee, so it's too bad no one paid commensurate attention to the script. The writers, including Karey Kirkpatrick, who directed with Tim Johnson, pad the story with the usual yuks and some glop about family, but there is no poetry here and little thought. (Dargis) 'POSEIDON' (PG-13, 100 minutes) Wolfgang Petersen's ''Poseidon'' is unlikely to replace the original in the hearts of action-hungry moviegoers, though it will probably expunge the memory of the earlier, made-for-TV remake (and also, perhaps, of the 1979 sequel, ''Beyond the Poseidon Adventure''). The hard-working cast does a lot of screaming, climbing and death-defying in soaking-wet evening wear, but they can hardly hope to match the ripe absurdity of Shelley Winters, Red Buttons, Gene Hackman and Ernest Borgnine. (Scott) 'THE PROMISE' (PG-13, 103 minutes, in Mandarin) A lavish spectacle -- somewhere between grand opera and cartoon -- from Chen Kaige, about a love triangle involving a general, a slave and a cursed princess. Sometimes breathtaking, sometimes out of breath. (Scott) 'SEE NO EVIL' (R, 84 minutes) In ''See No Evil'' the professional wrestler Glen Jacobs (a k a Kane) plays a lumbering psychopath intent on butchering the juvenile delinquents on cleanup duty at the hotel where he's holed up. Propelled by an inebriated camera that careers off walls and, at one point, roots around in an empty eye socket, the movie soon devolves into a bloodily creative string of mutilations and impalings.(Jeannette Catsoulis) * 'STICK IT' (PG-13, 103 minutes) Somersaulting through happy clichés and unexpected invention, this spry teenage comedy gets everything right. (Nathan Lee) * 'THREE TIMES' (No rating, 135 minutes, in Mandarin and Taiwanese dialect) For this hypnotically beautiful cinematic trilogy, the Taiwanese director Hou Hsiao-hsien, one of the modern masters of the art, brings us love and loss in three different time periods. (Dargis) * '12 AND HOLDING' (R, 94 minutes) This poignant, beautifully acted film, directed by Michael Cuesta (''L.I.E.''), flashes a laser beam on the moment between childhood and adolescence, when unguarded emotions and fantasies still rule, but adult experience beckons. (Holden) 'UNITED 93' (R, 115 minutes) A scrupulously tasteful Hollywood re-creation of the downing of the fourth plane hijacked by Muslim terrorists on Sept. 11 and easily the feel-bad American movie of the year. Written and directed by Paul Greengrass, whose earlier films include ''Bloody Sunday.'' (Dargis) * 'WATER' (PG-13, 114 minutes, in Hindi) Set in India in 1938, ''Water'' focuses on a group of widows condemned by Hindu law to live in an institution on the banks of the River Ganges. The arrival of a high-spirited 8-year-old girl encourages one widow to question her faith and another to begin a love affair with a Gandhian idealist. Bobbing back and forth between romantic melodrama and spiritual inquiry, ''Water'' is an exquisitely beautiful film about the institutionalized oppression of an entire class of women. (Catsoulis) 'X-MEN: THE LAST STAND' (PG-13, 104 minutes) As expected, the third and presumably last film about the powerful Marvel Comics mutants who walk and often fight among us pretty much looks and plays like the first two, though perhaps with more noise and babes, and a little less glum. The credited writers here are Simon Kinberg and Zak Penn, who, like the director, Brett Ratner, are not mutant enough to fly. (Dargis) Film Series B-NOIR (Through June 15) Film Forum's six-week festival of 70 low-budget American thrillers from the 1940's and 50's continues this weekend with two double features. Today and Saturday, the films, both directed by Phil Karlson, are ''Kansas City Confidential'' (1952), about a man framed for an armored-car robbery, and ''The Phenix City Story'' (1955), a docudrama about a corrupt Alabama town. The double feature for Sunday and Monday is ''Man in the Dark'' (1953), about a criminal who loses his memory in experimental brain surgery, and ''D.O.A.'' (1950), in which a poisoned, dying man searches for his killer. Edmond O'Brien stars in both. 209 West Houston Street, west of Avenue of the Americas, South Village, (212) 727-8110; $10.(Anita Gates) HUMAN RIGHTS WATCH INTERNATIONAL FILM FESTIVAL (Through June 22) The Film Society of Lincoln Center sponsors this annual festival. This weekend's features include the New York premieres of ''The Camden 28'' (2006), about early-1970's anti-Vietnam War activists; ''Dreaming Lhasa'' (2005), the adventures of a Tibetan filmmaker from New York; and ''Source'' (2005), a documentary from the Czech Republic about the oil boom in Azerbaijan.. Walter Reade Theater, 165 West 65th Street, Lincoln Center, (212) 875-5600; $10. (Gates) STANLEY KUBRICK RETROSPECTIVE (Through July 9) The Museum of the Moving Image's five-week series, which includes all 12 of Kubrick's full-length features, continues with ''Killer's Kiss'' (1955), an indie-style film about a boxer; ''The Killing'' (1956), his acclaimed racetrack heist film; and ''La Ronde'' (1950), Max Ophuls's 1950 Vienna romance ''La Ronde,'' based on the same Arthur Schnitzler novel as Kubrick's ''Eyes Wide Shut.'' 35th Avenue at 36th Street, Astoria, Queens, (718) 784-0077; $10. (Gates) KUROSAWA (Through Sept. 18) The IFC Center's weekend series honoring Akira Kurosawa continues this weekend with ''Dersu Uzala'' (1975), his Oscar-winning Soviet-made drama about a hunter's friendship with a Russian military explorer. 323 Avenue of the Americas, at West Third Street, Greenwich Village, (212) 924-7771; $10.75. (Gates) TO SAVE AND PROJECT: THE FOURTH MOMA INTERNATIONAL FESTIVAL OF FILM PRESERVATION (Through June 21) This monthlong program of preserved and restored films continues at the Museum of Modern Art. This weekend's features include ''Le Coupable'' (1917), a recently rediscovered French silent about a magistrate's illegitimate son, and two Satyajit Ray films, ''The Coward'' (1965), about a screenwriter and an old love, and ''The Holy Man,'' about a fake guru. Roy and Niuta Titus Theaters, 11 West 53rd Street, Manhattan, (212) 708-9400; $10. (Gates) THE VISION THAT CHANGED CINEMA: MICHELANGELO ANTONIONI (Through June 29) BAMcinématek's tribute to Antonioni continues with screenings of his biggest commercial success, ''Blow-Up'' (1966), starring Vanessa Redgrave and David Hemmings, through Tuesday. Two programs of Antonioni's short films will be shown on Wednesday and Thursday. BAM Rose Cinemas, 30 Lafayette Avenue, at Ashland Place, Fort Greene, Brooklyn, (718) 636-4100; $10. (Gates) Pop Full reviews of recent concerts: nytimes.com/music. * ARCTIC MONKEYS (Wednesday) For nearly a year it's been pretty much impossible to read or even hear anything about this young group from Sheffield, England, without some fervid opinion about whether it is or is not, in fact, the greatest band on the planet. The pros have a decent case: the band's catchy, high-strung songs, with terse, punchy guitar riffs and caustic lyrics about the nightclubbing life, are, at the very least, one of rock's biggest new thrills. Appearing with We Are Scientists, a Brooklyn band playing a similar if less memorable kind of spiky disco-punk. At 6:45 p.m.; Roseland, 239 West 52nd Street, Manhattan, (212) 777-6800; $25. (Ben Sisario) BABY GRAMPS (Tomorrow through Wednesday) With a gray beard the size of small shrubbery, a raspy Popeye voice and manic skills on the steel guitar, Baby Gramps plays a cartoonish variation on the role of hobo troubadour in old-timey songs like ''Big Rock Candy Mountain.'' But where he really shines is in his hilarious and ingenious wordplay, as in his palindrome song (''Go hang a salami -- I'm a lasagna hog''). Tomorrow at 7 p.m.; Barbès, 376 Ninth Street, at Sixth Avenue, Park Slope, Brooklyn, (718) 965-9177; $10. Sunday at 9 p.m., Hank's Saloon, 46 Third Avenue, at Atlantic Avenue, Boerum Hill, Brooklyn, (718) 625-8003; $8 donation. Monday at 7 p.m.; Living Room, 154 Ludlow Street, near Stanton Street, Lower East Side, (212) 533-7235; free. Wednesday at 9:45 p.m., Naked Lunch, 17 Thompson Street, SoHo, (212) 343-0828; $10. (Sisario) JAMES BROWN (Tonight) He is the godfather of much more than soul: as the chief architect of funk, James Brown is one of the most influential figures in popular music since Louis Armstrong. He's a great dancer, too. At 8 p.m.; B. B. King Blues Club and Grill, 237 West 42nd Street, Manhattan, (212) 997-4144; $80 in advance, $85 at the door. (Sisario) * CAMILLE (Monday and Tuesday) On her album ''Le Fil'' (Narada), Camille creates an astonishing vocal soundworld in miniature, with playful, brassy parts -- some in French, some in scatlike percussive syllables -- cleverly multitracked over a constant hummed drone. There is an elaborate musical intelligence at work, though the overall effect is simply that of an alluring siren song. Monday at 7:30 p.m., Tuesday at 9:30 p.m.; Joe's Pub at the Public Theater, 425 Lafayette Street, at Astor Place, East Village, (212) 239-6200; sold out. (Sisario) * CAT POWER AND THE MEMPHIS RHYTHM BAND (Tonight and tomorrow night) For her most recent album, ''The Greatest'' (Matador), Chan Marshall, the burgundy-voiced figure of indie melancholy who performs as Cat Power, recorded in Memphis with a group of veteran soul players. The strutting rhythms, tender guitars and happy horns give her an expressive new vocabulary of sorrows, loves and joys; she hasn't sounded so inspired in years. With Dexter Romweber, who played rockabilly with passion and fury in the Flat Duo Jets. At 8; Town Hall, 123 West 43rd Street, Manhattan, (212) 840-2824; sold out. (Sisario) GOGOL BORDELLO (Tonight) With an untamed stage persona a bit like Iggy Pop and a bit like a paranoid Kafka protagonist, the singer-contortionist Eugene Hutz leads a cultural mashup of dirty punk, raucous Gypsy music and vaudevillian theatrics. The band has been playing like there's no tomorrow for seven or eight years and shows no signs of slowing down or even taking a breath. With Kultur Shock, Dub Trio and Outernational. At 7:30; Irving Plaza, 17 Irving Place, at 15th Street, Manhattan, (212) 777-6800; sold out. (Sisario) JAMES HUNTER (Wednesday) After years honing his style in London pubs, this dapper British singer has emerged with ''People Gonna Talk'' (Go/Rounder), recreating the smooth, slithery R & B of early-1960's American singers like Sam Cooke, Jackie Wilson and Little Willie John with care and affection. At 7:30 and 10 p.m.; Makor, 35 West 67th Street, Manhattan, (212) 415-5500; sold out. (Sisario) McDONALD'S GOSPELFEST (Thursday) This competition and performance series puts amateurs and gospel's biggest stars on the same stage. This year those stars include Donnie McClurkin, the Rev. Hezekiah Walker and the Love Fellowship Tabernacle Choir, Vickie Winans, Cissy Houston and Tye Tribbett. The four-day event runs through June 18. At 7:30 p.m.; City Center, 131 West 55th Street, Manhattan, (212) 581-1212; $35 to $100.(Sisario) * NELLIE McKAY (Sunday) On nights off from ''The Threepenny Opera'' on Broadway, Ms. McKay, a songwriting sprite whom it is impossible to get tired of, is playing a series of late-night shows at Joe's Pub. These are rare chances to hear the songs from her excellent second album, ''Pretty Little Head,'' which has been in music purgatory since Ms. McKay was dropped by Columbia late last year. At 11:30 p.m.; Joe's Pub at the Public Theater, 425 Lafayette Street, at Astor Place, East Village, (212) 239-6200; $20. (Sisario) NEW CARS, BLONDIE (Tonight) The summer touring season sometimes creates strange allegiances. Todd Rundgren is fronting the New Cars, which features two original members of the Cars. (Another two, including the singer Ric Ocasek, declined to participate, and the bassist Benjamin Orr died six years ago.) Mr. Rundgren fills the role of lead singer pretty well, which, considering his versatility, isn't a surprise. With Blondie, whose 2006 highlights include induction into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame and a sexy new song by Debbie Harry in tribute to Lil' Kim. At 7 p.m.; Nikon at Jones Beach Theater, Wantagh, N.Y., (516) 221-1000 or (212) 307-7171; $20 to $65.(Sisario) MACEO PARKER (Wednesday and Thursday) As the alto saxophonist for James Brown in his prime funk years and later for George Clinton's Parliament-Funkadelic, Mr. Parker has an impeccable pedigree and the skills to match. Wednesday at 8 p.m.; Irving Plaza, 17 Irving Place, at 15th Street, Manhattan, (212) 777-6800; $32 in advance, $25 at the door. Thursday at 8 p.m., Celebrate Brooklyn, Prospect Park Bandshell, Prospect Park West and Ninth Street, Park Slope, Brooklyn, (718) 855-7882; $3 suggested donation. (Sisario) * RADIOHEAD (Tuesday and Wednesday) It's been three years since the last Radiohead album, and Thom Yorke, its singer, is releasing a solo record next month. Those are sometimes bad signs for a band, but there's nothing to worry about here: on this brief summer tour Radiohead is trying out material for a new album. At 8 p.m.; Theater at Madison Square Garden, (212) 465-6741; sold out. (Sisario) SUSHEELA RAMAN (Tuesday) Ms. Raman, born in India and living in London, wanders East and West in her songs, often placing Indian-tinged melodies atop pop-jazz vamps. With Brisa Roché. At 7 p.m.; Joe's Pub at the Public Theater, 425 Lafayette Street, at Astor Place, East Village, (212) 239-6200; $18.(Jon Pareles) SONIC YOUTH (Tuesday) Conventional wisdom would say that Sonic Youth should have burned out years ago: the band has been treading the same shaggy avant-indie path since the early 1980's, and each of its members has had plenty of other interests to pursue. But since its 2002 album ''Murray Street,'' partly about life after 9/11, Sonic Youth has hit a wonderful new stride, sounding comfortable, focused and invigorated. The band begins a tour for its strong new album, ''Rather Ripped'' (Geffen), at CBGB. At 8 p.m.; 315 Bowery, at Bleecker Street, East Village, (212) 982-4052; sold out. (Sisario) RALPH STANLEY (Wednesday) Ralph Stanley's stark, unflinching ''O Death'' leaped out of the soundtrack of ''O Brother, Where Are Thou?'' and introduced a few million new listeners to a gripping, venerable singer whose songs about sin, temptation and salvation are cornerstones of country music. Leading his own band, Mr. Stanley is more avuncular than apocalyptic, but his songs still have eerie moments. With Tres Chicas, featuring the singers Caitlin Cary, Lynn Blakey and Tonya Lamm. At 7 p.m.; Rockefeller Park, Battery Park City, (212) 835-2789; free. (Pareles) STEW (Tomorrow) When he's not leading his band, the Negro Problem, Stew plays quieter, melodic pop songs that free-associate their way through wry situations and extravagant metaphors. At 9:30 p.m.; Joe's Pub at the Public Theater, 425 Lafayette Street, at Astor Place, East Village, (212) 239-6200; $15 in advance, $20 at the door. (Pareles) STIFF LITTLE FINGERS (Sunday) Before Rancid revived the political fervor and punk and ska momentum of the Clash, Stiff Little Fingers was around to insist that the Clash had the right ideas all along. At 8 p.m.; Irving Plaza, 17 Irving Place, at 15th Street, Manhattan, (212) 777-6800; $20. (Pareles) ROB THOMAS, JEWEL (Tomorrow) On his solo album ''Something to Be'' (Atlantic), Rob Thomas, the lead singer of Matchbox Twenty, has reinvented himself as a dance-pop wiggler in the George Michael mode. Jewel has already gone through her electronic phase (on her forgettable album ''0304'') and, on her new ''Goodbye Alice in Wonderland'' (Atlantic), returned to her specialty, cooing guitar folk. At 7 p.m.; Nikon at Jones Beach Theater, Wantagh, N.Y., (516) 221-1000 or (212) 307-7171; $20 to $65. (Sisario) TILLY AND THE WALL (Wednesday) This Omaha indie-rock band plays smart, tuneful anthems with some rough edges, like many indie-rock bands, but has one truly unusual (and effective) gimmick: its percussion comes from the manic tap-dancing of one of its members, Jamie Williams. With David Dondero. At 8 p.m.; Bowery Ballroom, 6 Delancey Street, near the Bowery, Lower East Side, (212) 533-2111; $14. (Sisario) UNCLE MONK (Tomorrow) There is life after the Ramones, but who knew that its sound would be bluegrass? Tom Erdelyi, better known as Tommy Ramone, the band's first drummer (and only surviving original member), plays a mean mandolin in this new acoustic duo, singing tautly written songs -- much like Ramones songs, but with tenderness -- about the comforts and subtle politics of home life. At 8 p.m.; with Radio I-Ching (featuring Dee Pop of the Bush Tetras), Johnny Black and others. CB's 313 Gallery, 313 Bowery, at Bleecker Street, East Village, (212) 982-4052; $8. (Sisario) * RUFUS WAINWRIGHT (Wednesday and Thursday) He might well call it sacred music. With a 40-piece orchestra, Mr. Wainwright performs a track-by-track tribute to Judy Garland's 1961 live album ''Judy at Carnegie Hall,'' from ''The Trolley Song'' to ''Chicago.'' At 8 p.m.; Carnegie Hall, (212) 247-7800; sold out. (Sisario) GRETCHEN WILSON (Thursday) Ms. Wilson arrived two years ago as an unapologetic honky-tonker, and though her second album, ''All Jacked Up'' (Epic), deals with some morning-after complications, her appetites are undiminished. On ''Skoal Ring'' she identifies her preferred flavor of man by his chewing tobacco: ''That berry blend on his lips still turns me on.'' At 8 p.m.; Radio City Music Hall, (212) 247-4777; $46.50 to $96.50. (Sisario) 'ZAPPA PLAYS ZAPPA' (Monday) More than a decade after his death, Frank Zappa's transformation from rock composer to composer, period, seems about as complete as it can be. His vast output -- more than 60 albums -- is a repertory to be engaged and interpreted again and again, and for this tour, his son Dweezil is playing his music with a roster that includes the former Zappa employees Steve Vai, Napoleon Murphy Brock and Terry Bozzio. At 8 p.m.; Beacon Theater, 2124 Broadway, at 74th Street, (212) 496-7070 or (212) 307-7171; $39.50 to $85. (Sisario) Cabaret Full reviews of recent cabaret shows: nytimes.com/music. BARBARA CARROLL (Sunday) Even when swinging out, this Lady of a Thousand Songs remains an impressionist with special affinities for Thelonious Monk and bossa nova.

TOSHIKO AKIYOSHI: A LADIES SALUTE TO A PIONEER (Thursday) Ms. Akiyoshi is an accomplished composer, arranger and pianist, though not originally in that order: it was her pianism that brought her first into the spotlight, and then into the United States, some 50 years ago.

There will be the New York premiere of Andrew Imbrie's Symphony No. 2, composed in 1970. Mr. Imbrie, celebrating his 85th birthday this year, writes works that mostly hew to formal classical structures, but speak in a gritty, astringent and arresting modern language. The Riverside Symphony has long championed this original composer's music. George Rothman, the music director, will also conduct the United States premiere of the Symphony No. 2 by the little-heard Danish composer Niels Gade, who worked under Mendelssohn at Leipzig in his youth and became an influential figure in Scandinavia in the late 19th century.

But this recital, with the pianist Robert Kulek, will be her New York debut. The program includes works by Grieg, Schnittke, Brahms and Ravel. At 5 p.m., Town Hall, 123 West 43rd Street, Manhattan, (212) 707-8787; free, but tickets are required. (Tickets are distributed starting at noon on the day of concert.)

Tonight at 7:30, tomorrow at 3 and 7:30 p.m., Sunday at 3 p.m., Harry DeJur Playhouse, Henry Street Settlement, 466 Grand Street, Lower East Side, (212) 674-9066 or rodrodgersdance.com; $20 for adults, $10 for children under 12 (tonight and tomorrow night), $15 (tomorrow afternoon), $10 (Sunday afternoon). (Dunning) URBAN KUTCHERIe (Tonight and tomorrow) This multimedia program by New York-based Indian classical dancers and musicians will feature work by Bharatanatyam dance by Sonali Skandan. At 8 p.m., Joyce SoHo, 155 Mercer Street, (212) 334-7479 or sonaliskandan.com; $15, $10 for students and 65+. (Dunning) NINA WINTHROP AND DANCERS (Tonight through Sunday) Ms. Winthrop will present her multimedia ''That's Me -- I'm the One Lying Down Over There,'' set to music by Jon Gibson. She has described its inspiration as the tendency of the world to be marked by ''strange shades of joy and sharp fits of ecstasy.'' At 8:30 p.m., Danspace Project at St. Mark's Church, 131 East 10th Street, at Second Avenue, East Village (212)674-8194 or danspaceproject.org; $15; $12 for students and 65+. (Dunning) Art Museums and galleries are in Manhattan unless otherwise noted. Full reviews of recent art shows: nytimes.com/art. Museums * American Folk Art Museum: 'WHITE ON WHITE (AND A LITTLE GRAY),' through Sept. 17. The importance of neo-Classicism to early American architecture, silver and fine furniture is not exactly news. This small, beautiful show follows its spread into more personal corners of visual culture: often exquisite, strikingly dimensional white-work bedcovers; luminously grisaille, sometimes wacky marble-dust drawings; and print-work embroidery mourning pictures. 45 West 53rd Street, (212) 265-1040. (Roberta Smith) * BROOKLYN MUSEUM: 'SYMPHONIC POEM: THE ART OF AMINAH BRENDA LYNN ROBINSON,' through Aug. 13. This prodigious show, by an artist born and still living in Columbus, Ohio, celebrates her heritage in paintings, drawings, sculpture, stitchery, leather work and less classifiable forms of expression. Besides its sheer visual wizardry, using materials like leaves, twigs, bark, buttons and cast-off clothes, her art is compelling in that it ruminates on the history of black migration to, and settlement in, the United States, from early times to the present, in a garrulous, very personal way. 200 Eastern Parkway, at Prospect Park, (718) 638-5000. (Grace Glueck) COOPER-HEWITT NATIONAL DESIGN MUSEUM: 'FREDERIC CHURCH, WINSLOW HOMER AND THOMAS MORAN: TOURISM AND THE AMERICAN LANDSCAPE,' through Oct. 22. It turns out that the Cooper-Hewitt owns thousands of rarely seen paintings, prints and sketches by Church, Homer and Moran. Studies of the countryside, mostly, they revere unspoiled nature and record tourism, a booming industry in 19th-century America. Here they're combined with antique postcards, old Baedekers, stereoscopic photographs, playing cards with pictures of Yellowstone on them and souvenir platters, all to trace the nation's transformation from primeval wilderness to Catskills resort. The show is extremely entertaining. 2 East 91st Street, at Fifth Avenue, (212) 849-8400. (Michael Kimmelman) * FRICK COLLECTION: 'VERONESE'S ALLEGORIES: VIRTUE, LOVE AND EXPLORATION IN RENAISSANCE VENICE,' through July 16. Paolo Veronese (1528-88), a superb colorist and one of the most suavely sensuous of Renaissance Venetian painters, used the age-old device of allegory to make abstract concepts visual, often by means of human or mythological figures. In this five-painting show, the first to include all of his large-scale allegories from American collections, high ideals mingle with earthy and sometimes erotic physicality, as in the painting ''Venus and Mars United by Love.'' 1 East 70th Street, (212) 288-0700. (Glueck) SOLOMON R. GUGGENHEIM MUSEUM: 'ZAHA HADID: THIRTY YEARS IN ARCHITECTURE,' through Oct. 25. This exhibition, Ms. Hadid's first major retrospective in the United States, gives New Yorkers a chance to see what they've been missing. The show, in the Solomon R. Guggenheim Museum's rotunda, spirals through Ms. Hadid's career, from her early enchantment with Soviet Constructivism to the sensuous and fluid cityscapes of her more recent commissions. It illuminates her capacity for bridging different worlds: traditional perspective drawing and slick computer-generated imagery, and the era of utopian manifestos and the ambiguous values of the information age. (212) 423-3500.(Nicolai Ouroussoff) JEWISH MUSEUM: 'EVA HESSE: SCULPTURE,' through Sept. 17. Assembled by Elizabeth Sussman, curator at the Whitney Museum of American Art, and Fred Wasserman, a curator at the Jewish Museum, this show focuses on a pivotal Hesse exhibition, ''Chain Polymers,'' at the Fischbach Gallery -- known for promoting Minimalist painters -- in 1968. Arguably a compilation of her best work, it was her first and only solo show of sculpture during her lifetime, and most of the objects in it -- along with some earlier and later pieces -- are here. (An exhibition of her drawings is on view at the Drawing Center.) 1109 Fifth Avenue, at 92nd Street, (212) 423-3200. (Glueck) * METROPOLITAN MUSEUM OF ART: 'ANGLOMANIA: TRADITION AND TRANSGRESSION IN BRITISH FASHION,' through Sept. 4. Ranging from early-18th-century gowns to next season's evening wear, this show crowds 65 extravagantly clad mannequins into the Met's normally serene English period rooms, trying to connect the sartorial innovations of the English dandy, the aggressive tribal attire of punk and the deconstructive impulses of today's British fashion stars. (212) 535-7710. (Smith) * MET: 'GIRODET: ROMANTIC REBEL,' through Aug. 27. Hugely famous in the early 19th century, Girodet dropped down the memory chute. His ''Ossian Receiving the Ghosts of French Heroes,'' painted for Napoleon, is one of the most deranged pictures in art history. It's so unhinged that it's almost lovable, which is otherwise the last word to come to mind for an artist who, in his uptight, smarty-pants mode, could be a bore. But give the show a shot. It's sometimes brilliant, and Girodet's strangeness and fairly repellent character make him at least fascinating to contemplate and heroic in his immoderation. History is full of shifty characters, antique visionaries, cusp figures and half-crazy oddball innovators, later overlooked because they're hard to pigeonhole. Their independent cast of mind is the truest expression of how civilization advances. (See above.) (Kimmelman) 'THE EAMES LOUNGE CHAIR: AN ICON OF MODERN DESIGN' Celebrating the 50th anniversary of a chair whose combination of declarative modernist structure and sheer creature comfort was both innovative and a bit alien, this exhibition is a successful design object in its own right. It pays homage with drawings, advertising ephemera, precursors, vintage television clips, a wonderful documentary and three versions of the chair itself, enshrined, exploded and useable. Museum of Arts & Design, 40 West 53rd Street, (212) 956-3535, through Sept. 3. (Smith) Museum of Modern Art : 'AGAINST THE GRAIN: CONTEMPORARY ART FROM THE EDWARD R. BROIDA COLLECTION,' through July 10. The latest collection assembled by the Museum of Modern Art bolsters its holdings of art world mavericks like Philip Guston, Jennifer Bartlett, Ken Price and Vija Celmins and includes first-timers like Robert Grosvenor, John Lees and Susana Solano. It also illuminates parts of the untold, or forgotten, stories of the art of the 1970's and 80's: the achievements of painters and sculptors who were not at the forefront of Post-Minimalism, photo appropriation or Neo-Expressionism. Some of their efforts may disappear into storage, but quite a few will shake up the Modern's conception of the complicated course of art since 1970. The Museum of Modern Art, (212) 708-9400. (Smith) National Academy: '181st Annual: an Invitational Exhibition of Contemporary Art' This year's sprawling hodgepodge of an invitational presents works by 124 artists ranging from tightly focused realist painting to politically charged video installation. National Academy, 1083 Fifth Avenue, at 89th Street, (212) 369-4880. Through June 13. (Ken Johnson) New York Public Library: 'FRENCH BOOK ART/LIVRES D'ARTISTES: ARTISTS AND POETS IN DIALOGUE,' through Aug. 18. Organized with the Bibliothèque Littéraire Jacques Doucet in Paris, this lavish exhibition surveys some of the experimental ferment brought on by the combination of free verse, visionary publishers and the high rate of talent among French artists and poets, especially in the early years of the 20th century. New York Public Library, Fifth Avenue at 42nd Street, (212) 869-8089. (Smith) NOGUCHI MUSEUM: 'BEST OF FRIENDS: BUCKMINSTER FULLER AND ISAMU NOGUCHI,' through Oct. 15. Great, lasting friendships are rare, but friendships that enlarge the spirit through ideas, ideals and new insights are in a class by themselves. Over a stretch of more than 50 years, the sculptor Isamu Noguchi and the visionary designer R. Buckminster Fuller enjoyed such a friendship, which led to aesthetic and practical achievements that left their mark. The course of their varied collaborations is traced in this exhibition, which includes models, sculptures, drawings, photographs and films. 9-01 33rd Road, between Vernon Boulevard and 10th Street, Long Island City, Queens, (718) 204-7088. (Glueck) * The Studio Museum In harlem: 'Energy/Experimentation: Black Artists and Abstraction, 1964-1980,' through July 2. During one of the most radical periods in 20th-century American politics, the Black Power era, a group of African-American artists was working in one of the most radical forms of 20th-century art: abstraction. This show is stylishly installed; the 15 artists are intensely individualistic and part of an important history. 144 West 125th Street, (212) 864-4500. (Holland Cotter) Galleries: Uptown Peter Dayton: 'Surfboards by Clement Greenberg' For a witty spin on commodity-critique art, Mr. Dayton creates panel paintings combining the glossy surfaces, colorful banding and logos of surfboard design and the striped patterns of paintings by Kenneth Noland and Barnett Newman that were favored by the powerful formalist critic Clement Greenberg. Winston Wächter, 39 East 78th Street, (212) 327-2526, through June 24. (Johnson) Galleries: 57th Street 'Coup de Foudre' Four works loosely related by the metaphor of lightning. Emilie Halpern offers a white plastic lightning bolt and walls papered by heat-sensitive film. Small cutouts by Tim Noble & Sue Webster cast pornographic shadows; stick-on letters applied to the floor, walls and ceiling by Tamara Sussman spell out an erotic fantasy written in Web-based ''slash fiction'' style; and a surprisingly affecting, grainy, rambling video created by Enid Baxter Blader with a homemade camera explores stormy natural and emotional weather. Tina Kim, 41 West 57th Street, (212) 716-1100, through June 23. (Johnson) Galleries: SoHo EVA HESSE: 'DRAWING' This show deals in depth with Ms. Hesse's works on paper, ranging from rough sketches or notes, to test pieces made from various materials that function as drawings, to finished projects that stand on their own. A zealous researcher, Ms. Hesse made all kinds of thumbnail notations and calculations to explore the properties of her malleable materials. Many of these sheets, perhaps too many, are shown, too. Drawing Center, 35 Wooster Street, (212) 219-2166, through July 15. (Glueck) * THOMAS ZIPP: URANLICHT An impressive solo debut pairs dark, nearly abstract landscapes and cursory botanical imagery with appropriated images of authoritarian bearded men, evoking a by-gone avant-garde and the reaction against it. A room-filling hand-built organ that Père Ubu might have loved completes the presentation. HarrisLieberman, 89 Vandam Street, South Village, (212) 206-1290, through June 17. (Smith) Galleries: Chelsea * 'An Ongoing Low-Grade Mystery' Organized by the curator Bob Nickas, this excellent group show includes works in many different mediums and styles related in that they are all predominantly red. Donald Judd, Sherrie Levine, Jim Drain, Wolfgang Tillmans and Dan Walsh are among more than 30 artists included. Paula Cooper, 534 West 21st Street, (212) 255-1105, through June 23. (Johnson) * Mamma Andersson: 'Rooms Under the Influence' In haunting paintings of rooms and landscapes, this Swedish painter combines the sensuousness of Edouard Vuillard and the moody angst of Edvard Munch. David Zwirner, 525 West 19th Street, (212) 727-2070, through June 17. (Johnson) Willem de Kooning: 'Sketchbook' Twelve pages bearing spidery pencil drawings from a rare, intact sketchbook from the mid-1970's by this great Abstract Expressionist. Matthew Marks Gallery, 523 West 24th Street, (212) 243-0200, through June 17. (Johnson) * NICOLE EISENMAN: 'PROGRESS: REAL & IMAGINED' This show is dominated by two mural-sized paintings of elaborately imagined, demonically energetic panoramas. One examines the artist's dilemma; the other takes a distinctly ahistorical view of life. But both represent real progress in Ms. Eisenman's determined struggle to flesh out her narrative style with color and texture, and a room of small paintings shows even more promise. Leo Koenig, 545 West 23rd Street, (212) 334-9304, through June 17. (Smith) Jeremy Gilbert-Rolfe If you know Mr. Gilbert-Rolfe only for his formidably cerebral art criticism (among other achievements, he is co-founder of the journal October), you may be surprised by his paintings. His four square canvases combining Color Field painting and vertical passages of grid painting appeal far more to sensory than to intellectual experience. Gray Kapernekas, 526 West 26th Street, (212) 462-4150, through June 17. (Johnson) 'Invisible Might: Works from 1965-1971' This luminous group show about the euphoric convergence of Minimalism and new technologies in the late 60's and early 70's includes a smoky glass cube by Larry Bell; a solid black plastic cube by John McCracken; a tall, clear acrylic prism by Robert Irwin; a beautiful aqua green light projection by James Turrell; a yellow molded plastic relief by Craig Kauffman; and a corner composition of elastic cords and bent metal rods by Fred Sandback. Nyehaus, 15 Gramercy Park South, (212) 995-1785, through June 24. (Johnson) RICHARD SERRA: 'ROLLED AND FORGED' The centerpiece of the latest Serra spectacular, which favors mass, compression and rectangles over stretched-thin curves and spirals, is a low-lying maze in which the shifting heights and staggered placement of 16 thick, hedgelike plates create one of the most spatially complex yet straightforward works of his career. Gagosian Gallery, 555 West 24th Street, (212) 741-1111, through Aug. 11. (Smith) Last Chance * BARD GRADUATE CENTER: 'AMERICAN STREAMLINED DESIGN: THE WORLD OF TOMORROW,' Streamlining, a particularly American design concept born of our love of speed and admiration for industrial production, peaked in the 1930's and 40's, and is now said to be undergoing a revival. This tribute to it includes more than 180 objects, from boring but useful items like a receipt printer designed by Walter Dorwin Teague in 1946 to a plastic bicycle helmet of flowing teardrop shapes designed by John Larkin in 2000. The show is perhaps too packed with repetitive examples -- do we need to see three similar electric drills? -- but don't let that stop you. There's no shortage of wonderful things to look at here. 18 West 86th Street, (212) 501-3000; closes on Sunday. (Glueck) Museum of the City of New York: Sherril Schell: 'Unknown Modernist,' Though little known today, the photographer Sherril Schell (1877-1964) was critically recognized in the 1930's for his severely formalist photographs of New York architecture. This small exhibition presents 15 examples in which closely cropped views of the Chrysler Building, the Empire State Building, the Brooklyn Bridge and other monuments of Manhattan emphasize compositional order, structure, pattern, light and shadow. Museum of the City of New York, 1220 Fifth Avenue, at 103rd Street, (212) 534-1672; closes on Tuesday. (Johnson)"
2006-06-09T00:00:00Z,"Gentrification cometh, but on certain sleepy weekends, the Red Hook section of Brooklyn still feels like an abandoned urban paradise: wide-open swaths of sky, empty cobblestone streets and plenty of ocean. Tomorrow, however, the Caribbeans are coming, as Dancing in City Parks presents the second in a series of free public performances. First up is Tania Isaac Dance. Originally from St. Lucia and now based in Philadelphia, Tania Isaac was a standout member of Rennie Harris's Puremovement company and now mixes contemporary movement with traditional Caribbean forms in creating her own choreography. Expect high-energy dance, performed to everything from soca to Bach, as the company presents a number of works from its repertory. The Haitian folkloric company Ase Dance Theater Collective, above, completes the afternoon program with its own mix of old and new, including a Red Hook-specific ra-ra (a traditional Haitian dance) incorporating the fifth-grade class of P.S./M.S. 27. Audiences are encouraged to participate in a jam session after the performance, but wallflowers may want to escape to Red Hook's divine, ramshackle waterfront. Dancing in City Parks concludes on June 17, when the tap dancer Tamango, from French Guiana and New York, will take over Highbridge Park in Washington Heights with his spirited, international Urban Tap. Using three platforms set up around the audience and amplified shoes, Tamango and company will strive for a surround-sound carnival of rhythms.

(BBC America) SHARPE'S COMPANY -- Sean Bean (right) is Richard Sharpe, a maverick rifleman fighting Napoleon, in the United States premiere of this British television series from the 1990's, based on Bernard Cornwell's novels.

(Showtime) RE: EVOLUTION OF SPORTS -- The season finale of this series looks at the paths forged by Jamie O'Brien, a rip curl pipeline masters champion; Victoria Jealouse, an extreme backcountry snowboarder; and Jay Quinlan, a freestyle snowmobiler, as they continue to push beyond the boundaries. 8 P.M. (History Channel) AMAZON ADVENTURES -- Since the 15th century, the Amazon -- a largely uncharted region some 2.7 million square miles in scope, stretching across eight South American countries -- has held the imagination of explorers who traversed its colossal river and boundless jungles for hidden riches. This special extols the exploits of adventurers who have mined the Amazon for treasures cultural and scientific as well as of a more lucrative, if mythical, nature. 8 P.M. (TLC) FLIP IT FAST -- Five of the country's most successful house flippers reveal the nuts and bolts of buying, fixing and selling property -- stat! -- to turn a quick profit. At 10, ''This House Must Go'' apportions the time, effort and investment that should go into remodeling a home. 8:30 P.M. (Sundance) JANICE BEARD 45 WPM -- (1999). Been there, done that. That's the story of Ms. Beard (Eileen Walsh), an eccentric Scot who gets a temp job in London to pay for treatment for her deeply traumatized mother -- ''postnatal, postmortem depression,'' anyone? -- but winds up an unwitting pawn of an industrial saboteur (the always amusing Rhys Ifans, above, with Ms. Walsh). 9 P.M. (Logo) WHEN OCEAN MEETS SKY -- With its heady mixture of sand, surf and social scene, Fire Island Pines has become one of the world's most celebrated gay resorts. This documentary chronicles the community's transformation from nudist colony to gay mecca, and reflects on the political, environmental and social battles fought throughout its history. 9 P.M. (Sci Fi) BLACK HOLE -- An atomic research experiment goes awry in St. Louis, creating a big black hole and unleashing a creature from the beyond that feeds on the electricity pulsing beneath the city's streets. And oh, yeah -- its appetite is large enough to swallow the Midwest whole. 10 P.M. (HBO) LEWIS BLACK: RED, WHITE AND SCREWED -- Mr. Black (right), ever the wry social observer, cerebrates on topics including the war in Iraq, Hurricane Katrina and FEMA, gay marriage, the Dick Cheney shooting incident, President Bush, fossils and evolution.

2006-06-10T00:00:00Z,"In the preliminary Nielsen estimates for Thursday's ratings, ABC scored a rare victory for the night in households and in the 18-to-49 demographic because of Game 1 of the N.B.A. finals, in which the Dallas Mavericks beat the Miami Heat. CBS, led by reruns of ''CSI'' (12.37 million) and ''Without a Trace'' (11.1 million), appeared to be No. 1 among total viewers but was dragged down by ''Game Show Marathon'' at 8 (6.84 million). CBS placed fourth for the night among adults 18 to 49. Fox was second behind ABC in that age group: a rerun of ''So You Think You Can Dance'' (6.37 million) was followed by a new episode (10 million). And NBC broadcast four repeats of ''My Name Is Earl,'' along with the premiere of ''Windfall.'' That be-careful-what-you-wish-for lottery drama delivered 8.98 million viewers at 10 and beat ''Without a Trace'' in the 18-to-49 demographic. But it lost some of its audience from the first half-hour to the second, which can sometimes be a harbinger of failure. KATE AURTHUR"

2006-06-11T00:00:00Z,"Some orchestras take a safely inclusive approach to contemporary music, making sure to touch all stylistic camps in their programming. This has not been the way of the adventurous RIVERSIDE SYMPHONY, which ends its 25th-anniversary season with a concert on Thursday night at Alice Tully Hall. Over the years GEORGE ROTHMAN, the music director, and ANTHONY KORF, the artistic director, have championed select contemporary composers they believe in, among them the French master Henri Dutilleux, the Danish eclectic Poul Ruders and the dynamic American Stephen Hartke. Another American, ANDREW IMBRIE, has also been a Riverside Symphony favorite. Mr. Rothman conducted the orchestra in an acclaimed 1999 Bridge Records CD, which offered gripping accounts of Mr. Imbrie's Requiem and Piano Concerto No. 3. Mr. Imbrie, who celebrates his 85th birthday this year, writes works that in their structures honor the precedents of the classical tradition, but that speak with a gnarly and arrestingly modern harmonic voice. Thursday's program presents the New York premiere of his 1970 Symphony No. 2. Mr. Rothman will also conduct two 19th-century Nordic works: the Second Symphony of the Danish composer NIELS GADE, in its American premiere, and GRIEG's ever-popular Piano Concerto, with TERRENCE WILSON as soloist. At 7:30 p.m., Lincoln Center, (212) 721-6500; $45 and $25. The concert week kicks off today with two afternoon events. The essential FREE FOR ALL AT TOWN HALL series presents the New York debut of the emerging violinist ARABELLA STEINBACHER, born in 1981 to a German father and Japanese mother. With the pianist ROBERT KULEK, she will play works by Grieg, Schnittke, Brahms and Ravel. (Today at 5 p.m., Town Hall, 123 West 43rd Street, Manhattan, freeforallattownhall.org; free, tickets distributed today starting at noon.) And LEON BOTSTEIN conducts the AMERICAN SYMPHONY ORCHESTRA in ''From Russia With Mozart.'' It begins with Rimsky-Korsakov's one-act opera ''Mozart and Salieri,'' which anticipates Peter Shaffer's play ''Amadeus,'' and it ends with Alexander Dargomyzhsky's opera ''The Stone Guest,'' based on Pushkin's version of the Don Juan legend. 3 p.m., Avery Fisher Hall, Lincoln Center, (212) 247-7800; $25 to $53."

This may be admirable, but the building, too often, is the focus of attention, when what happens inside is far more important. An inanimate structure neither entertains nor educates. The performances are patronized, sadly, by an exclusive minority. Mr. Kozinn is correct that it is necessary to ''grab the dorsal fin,'' but without making music education a priority, it is unlikely that the ''fin'' will be up for grabs anytime soon.

The dam breaks on the deluge of summer reality programming this week. ABC offers the frothy ''HOW TO GET THE GUY'' (Monday at 10 p.m.), in which four San Francisco women (the Party Girl, the Girl Next Door and so on) are coached in the ways of dating. The two coaches are engaging and practical -- they advise not getting wasted on dates -- and the women are likable (except for the New Age irritant known as the Dreamer).

2006-06-11T00:00:00Z,"ON the face of it, requiring all individuals convicted of any crime in New York State to give DNA samples for inclusion in a state database seems completely rational and unassailable. While the current law requires only the collection of DNA from those convicted of particular crimes, proponents of expanding DNA retrieval to include those convicted of any felony or misdemeanor argue that people who commit petty crimes are likely to commit more serious ones later. Moreover, their logic goes, if there are more samples in the database, then there will be more DNA matches and more criminals will be caught before they can break the law again. But there are serious implications to widespread testing that have been overlooked by its supporters in the State Senate, which has passed an expanded DNA collection bill, and in the Assembly, where a similar bill is pending. The pitfalls of adding an abundance of new DNA profiles to the state's database go far beyond legitimate concerns about the civil liberties of convicted criminals or innocent persons falsely accused."

2006-06-11T00:00:00Z,"A review on May 28 about ''A Life Uncorked,'' a book of memoirs by the wine writer Hugh Johnson, referred incorrectly to a wine from Château Figeac discussed by Johnson at such length that he self-deprecatingly apologized to readers. Like all the wine produced there, it was a Bordeaux, not a Burgundy. (Château Figeac is in St.-Émilion, in the eastern part of the Bordeaux wine region.) The review also referred incorrectly to Château Latour, in the Bordeaux commune of Pauillac, on whose board Johnson has served. It is currently owned by François Pinault, a French industrialist; it has never been a ''Rothschild vineyard.''"

(BBC America) QUEEN AND COUNTRY -- On June 15, Britain will celebrate the 80th birthday of Queen Elizabeth II (along with the 85th birthday of her husband, the Duke of Edinburgh). This four-hour special examines the key aspects of the reign of one of the world's most photographed personalities, who, even now, remains an enigma to her people. At 7, ''H.M. the Queen: A Remarkable Life'' looks at how the queen (above, shown arriving at Westminster Abbey on May 17) has weathered change during more than 50 years on the throne. 8 P.M. (CBS) THE 60TH ANNUAL TONY AWARDS -- She may not have earned a Tony nomination, but her star turn in ''Three Days of Rain'' was a major factor in the 4.1 percent boost in ticket sales this year, according to the League of American Theaters and Producers. We're sure she'll rake in more than a few viewers in her role as a presenter at this, the least glitzy (and most scantily watched) of all major award ceremonies, broadcast live from Radio City Music Hall in Manhattan. 9 P.M. (Food Network) FOOD NETWORK CATERS YOUR VEGAS WEDDING -- It's a bride's dream-come-true when Giada de Laurentiis, Bobby Flay and other network chefs whip up a feast fit for the celebration of a lifetime. 9 P.M. (USA) THE 4400 -- Only seconds ago, Isabelle (Megalyn Echikunwoke, left) was a year-old baby. Now, in this season premiere about 4,400 humans who were abducted by aliens and then returned to Earth, she's a beautiful 20-year-old. And there are repercussions. 9 P.M. (Discovery) KRAKATOA: VOLCANO OF DESTRUCTION -- Multiply the magnitude of the 2004 tsunami by four and add the devastation of a volcanic eruption. That was the impact of the 1883 eruption of Krakatoa in Indonesia, whose explosion could be heard 3,000 miles away in Australia. This computergenerated special is almost, but thankfully not quite, like being there. 9 P.M. (HBO) DEADWOOD -- Lawlessness comes to an end with the beginning of a new season, as the town's first real election approaches. Call it strategic planning. 10 P.M. (HBO) ENTOURAGE -- Vince takes a brand-name date to his ''Aquaman'' premiere. And it's spelled M-O-M. 10:30 P.M. (HBO) LUCKY LOUIE -- Louis C.K. and Pamela Adlon (left) play Louie and Kim, typical blue-collar parents raising a child, in this new sitcom. Which is why her offer of sex for a week sounds awfully suspicious. 11 P.M.

2006-06-11T00:00:00Z,"Terrence McNally's play ''Frankie and Johnny in the Clair de Lune'' is, to put it bluntly, about losers. First produced at the Manhattan Theater Club in 1987, it is a haunting two-character piece that revolves around a one-night stand, the difficulties of dealing with either rejection or acceptance, and the sturdily built emotional defenses that get in the way. But this is not a lament, like Tom Noonan's first-date play ''What Happened Was '' or a comedy of psychological manners, like Renée Taylor and Joseph Bologna's ''Made for Each Other.'' Mr. McNally has said of his play, ''There's this sense of getting on, of making life happen.'' The uneven but rewarding new production at the Hartford Stage, directed by Jeremy B. Cohen, eventually conveys that."

2006-06-11T00:00:00Z,"''DOLLY will never go away again'' -- or so promises the refrain from the most famous title song of all time. But in fact, since Carol Channing packed up ''Hello, Dolly!'' in 1996, after at least 5,000 performances in several Broadway runs and numerous tours around the country, no major new production has dared come near New York. It's not clear why: with songs by Jerry Herman, book by Michael Stewart and original direction and choreography by Gower Champion, the show plays well in almost any circumstances. (Please ignore the 1969 movie starring Barbra Streisand.) Perhaps something about its very solidity, and the familiarity of Ms. Channing's extreme interpretation of the meddling, matchmaking widow, has recently kept top-drawer singing actresses away. But after her success as Golda Meir in ''Golda's Balcony'' -- one of the longest-running solo shows in Broadway history -- Tovah Feldshuh, 53, felt she was ready for that other take-charge scrapper with a Jewish surname, Dolly Gallagher Levi. For the production that opened on Saturday at the Paper Mill Playhouse in Millburn, N.J., and runs through July 23, Ms. Feldshuh rethought the character, researching the direct source material (Thornton Wilder's plays ''The Matchmaker'' and ''The Merchant of Yonkers'') and antecedents as diverse as 19th-century Viennese farce, Molière and commedia dell'arte."

Here are nine gifts for Father's Day to make dads of all ages feel hip. 1. Dress shirts from the Endurance collection by Ted Baker London combine elegant tailoring with durable cotton, which resists wrinkles, water and stains, in combinations of stripes, jacquards and solids ($95 to $125 at Ted Baker London in New York, 212-343-8989). 2. A paisley stamped belt by Etro has a touch of color and clever grace notes ($225 at www.Bergdorf Goodman.com). 3. Bright canvas drafting totes by Coach are made of cotton and trimmed with leather and suede for a lightweight summer alternative to bulky leather briefcases and heavy gym bags ($298 at www.Coach.com). 4. Straight-legged -- but not ridiculously skinny -- jeans from the new SLM collection by Paper, Denim & Cloth cut a streamlined silhouette ($182 at Saks Fifth Avenue stores). 5. The limited-edition Italian IKE watch has a virtually weightless clear plastic bracelet, which wears like steel and is waterproof up to 100 feet. It is also available with a bright orange rubber bracelet ($275 at www.vivre.com). 6. A Game Cube by Barneys New York is filled with mother-of-pearl poker chips, checkers and a checkerboard, dominoes, dice and playing cards. The whole kit is encased in a handmade leather cube fashioned to resemble an oversize die ($350 at www.barneys.com). 7. Supersoft long-sleeve T-shirts by Splendid Mills reverse from stripes to solids ($76 at Apartment No. 9 in Chicago, 773-395-2999). Short-sleeve versions are one-sided in bright or neutral stripes and are whisper light for the hottest days ($52, at Lisa Kline Men in Los Angeles, 310-385-7113). 8. The newest cult grooming product for men by Sharps is Bald Head Balm to protect Dad's scalp from relentless rays ($28). Included in the line are a conditioning shampoo ($12) and Guck in a Puck, which is hair styling with a viselike grip ($16, all at www.sharpsusa.com). 9. Easy-to-wear swim shorts by Boden are neither too long nor nerdishly short. The geometric fish and blue wave swirl is the pattern to watch ($54 at www.boden.com)."

And the summers -- oh, the summers -- when the six McDermott kids would pile into the car with their mother and head around the corner to the sprawling, shimmering pool complex that their town had built for them and the hordes of other families who had made the same trek south from cramped city neighborhoods in search of the same sweet pleasures."

But it should please the public, for this is the first time these distinguished works of art have traveled en masse from their home at the Corcoran Gallery in Washington. As a frequent visitor to museums in the nation's capital, I know many of the paintings in this delightful exhibition well. Some of them are old friends, for I have been looking at them on and off for years, either in real life or as reproductions in art history books. The exhibition does not contain the entire collection, but a selection of 74 of the best pictures from the Corcoran Gallery's permanent collection. While the rooms that house the collection are being refurbished, some of their most famous tenants were sent on the road, stopping first in Houston before heading to Southampton."

Mr. McKenzie-Adams was convicted in 2003 of sexual assault for having sex with two of his students, but Mr. Emanuel won his release from prison after filing a novel, but controversial, appeal that at least one other law firm has already copied. Mr. Emanuel is not denying or admitting that his client had sex with the students, ages 16 and 17, but is claiming that Mr. McKenzie-Adams's constitutional right to privacy was violated. In Connecticut, it is not illegal, of course, for two consenting adults to have a relationship, and people over the age of 16 are considered to have reached the age of consent."
2006-06-11T00:00:00Z,"The portrayal of my interview with Deborah Solomon (May 14) was misleading, callous and hurtful. I spoke with Deborah Solomon for more than one hour for what she described as a Mother's Day feature. We spent much of that time talking about my mom. I told her how my mom insisted her four kids sit at the kitchen table doing our homework while she prepared supper. We couldn't trade our pencil for a fork until she had corrected our work. Her lessons of discipline, accountability and preparation were invaluable training for my job as a journalist. I told her of Mom's joy at hearing our parish priest say, ''The hand that rocks the cradle rules the world'' because it affirmed the reality in our family -- that I was truly blessed to have a strong mother and strong father. I told her how my mom would wake me with a soft ''Tim, Tim.'' To me this proved you could be heard without yelling, something I hope is reflected each Sunday on ''Meet the Press.'' I told Solomon the details of my mom's final hours last August when she died from cancer. All four children were at her bedside. I told Solomon that my mom was a beautiful person, inside and out. Solomon chose to ignore all this, and instead the interview was selectively edited -- an interview entitled ''All About My Father,'' implying I chose to talk about my dad rather than my mom on Mother's Day. She also combined questions in her piece, suggesting I did not offer separate and distinct responses to each of her questions, which, of course, I did. My mom was a central figure in my life. This was my first Mother's Day without her. Your writer's deliberate mischaracterization of our conversation and her feeble attempt at humor made it a particularly painful day.

2006-06-11T00:00:00Z,"AS summer arrives with its peak electricity demands, the best of all possible worlds apparently prevails in our deregulated electricity market in New York State. A report released in early March by the Department of Public Service in Albany concludes that the wholesale electricity markets in New York ''are among the most advanced in the nation and that wholesale competition has led to significant efficiencies.'' The primary evidence is that the average prices paid by customers, adjusted for inflation, fell by roughly 16 percent from 1996 to 2004. This drop is indeed good news, and many have seized on it as evidence of the deregulated market's health. Unfortunately, this conclusion is incorrect. Deregulated markets have failed to prompt the investments needed to ensure a reliable future supply, particularly in New York City, Long Island and the greater metropolitan area. Furthermore, New York State still has the highest average price of electricity in the continental United States. In spite of our major hydroelectric plants at Niagara and Messina, the average retail price in New York State in 2004 (12.5 cents per kilowatt hour) was 50 percent higher than the price in Pennsylvania (8 cents per kilowatt hour)."

2006-06-11T00:00:00Z,"The eminent domain battle in New London moved closer to resolution when the City Council voted last Monday to begin the eviction process for the remaining residents of the Fort Trumbull neighborhood. All but two of the seven remaining homeowners have agreed to settle with the city, and when asked before the vote what she would do if the councilors pushed ahead, Susette Kelo, one of the two holdouts, said she might have to ''get some boxes.'' New London condemned the homes in 2000, but a legal battle that reached the United States Supreme Court caused delays. The court backed the city in the case, allowing the city to take the properties and turn them over to a private developer to build a hotel, offices and homes. But the ruling spurred a national outcry against eminent domain and spurred some states to forbid taking homes to make way for private redevelopment."

2006-06-11T00:00:00Z,"ON the face of it, requiring all individuals convicted of any crime in New York State to give DNA samples for inclusion in a state database seems completely rational and unassailable. While the current law requires only the collection of DNA from those convicted of particular crimes, proponents of expanding DNA retrieval to include those convicted of any felony or misdemeanor argue that people who commit petty crimes are likely to commit more serious ones later. Moreover, their logic goes, if there are more samples in the database, then there will be more DNA matches and more criminals will be caught before they can break the law again. But there are serious implications to widespread testing that have been overlooked by its supporters in the State Senate, which has passed an expanded DNA collection bill, and in the Assembly, where a similar bill is pending.

2006-06-11T00:00:00Z,"SIMON--John L. Died peacefully at his home on June 8 following a courageous effort to overcome leukemia. Cherished father of Julie and brother of Richard (Maxine) Simon and Barbra and (Bruce) London. He is further survived by his beloved Lori and her daughters, his niece and nephews and close friend Marylu. John made enduring commitments and contributions to his community serving as president of The American Jewish Committee, Central New Jersey chapter and esteemed member of its International Relations Commission. He was an innovator and visionary in his diversified and highly regarded work in the healthcare industry. John was a man of rare openness and insight with the sort of warmth that put people at ease and made them lifelong friends. He made an impact on all of us who had the privilege of knowing him and he will be profoundly missed. Memorial services will be held at The Grounds for Sculpture in Hamilton, New Jersey on June 12 at 3PM. In lieu of flowers, contributions may be made in John's name to The American Jewish Committee, 225 Millburn Avenue, Suite 301, Millburn, NJ 07041."

2006-06-11T00:00:00Z,"To the Editor: Re ''Deadly Quackery,'' by John Moore and Nicoli Nattrass (Op-Ed, June 4): The South African government's comprehensive H.I.V. and AIDS program has three principal objectives. One, prevent the transmission of H.I.V. Two, when transmission occurs, delay for as long as possible the onset of AIDS-defining illness. Three, care for patients whose infections have progressed to AIDS-defining illness."
2006-06-11T00:00:00Z,"To the Editor: For more decades than I will enumerate I have hugely enjoyed the layout and approach of the Book Review. I like to scan the table of contents and then read the reviews whose titles and reviewers attract me, both fiction and nonfiction categories. I liked the fact that each issue contained an interesting combination of fiction and nonfiction reviews as well as other interesting features. My mind was stretched by the diverse reviews in each issue. Now to my dismay I pick up the May 21 issue and it is devoted entirely to fiction. I feel robbed. Then comes the May 28 issue devoted exclusively to food. I throw it in the wastebasket. Though I occasionally am attracted to a food book review, an entire issue devoted to that subject turns me off. No mind stretching here. Perhaps the next issue will be devoted to crime books. That, too, will go in the wastebasket, though an occasional crime book review attracts me. How I yearn for the Book Review of old that did not try to push particular books or categories of books on me but always stimulated me with a careful selection of reviews of outstanding and important books on a wide variety of subjects, along with eye-catchingbook ads. Perusing The New York Times Book Review is a habit difficult to break. Please, no more special-interest issues other than the year-end best books of the year. I do not enjoy throwing copies in the wastebasket before reading. Henry Halsted Racine, Wis."
2006-06-11T00:00:00Z,"''Psycho'' is famous for a shocking syncopation: ALFRED HITCHCOCK silences his heroine in the middle of her song. (And where else but in the shower?) To play the audience like an organ demands a killer sense of timing -- or, to switch metaphors, suspense is the art of killing time itself. With its razor-sharp montage and suffocating tensions, ''Psycho'' inflicts a sustained and subtle assault on the normal rhythms of life. As such, it screams to be slowed down, picked apart and scrutinized frame by frame. Two of the most fascinating responses to the movie proceed in just this manner. In his posthumously published study ''A LONG HARD LOOK AT PSYCHO,'' the critic RAYMOND DURGNAT crawls through every square inch of the movie, ingeniously analyzing its ''tissue of implication and suggestion.'' The artist DOUGLAS GORDON has taken a simpler but more drastic approach, enabling everyone to look as hard as Durgnat. ''24 HOUR PSYCHO'' is just that: Hitchcock's 109-minute masterpiece projected at two frames per second rather than the standard 24, with a consequent run time of one full day. Like Andy Warhol's eight-hour portrait of the Empire State Building, or the artist Paul Pfeiffer's extraordinary three-month study of a wasp nest, Mr. Gordon's 1993 video sounds like a flippant stunt until you set eyes on its gripping creep of light and shadow. Equal parts homage, invention and metacritical commentary, ''24 Hour Psycho'' is as hypnotic, in its slow-drip way, as the source material. The video is habitually situated in the center of a room and projected on a translucent screen, encouraging reflection on both sides of the image, and of ''Psycho'' itself as a piece of sculpture. Thus does it greet visitors to ''DOUGLAS GORDON: TIMELINE,'' an elegantly installed retrospective of the artist's videos opening today at the Museum of Modern Art. What Mr. Gordon has done to ''The Exorcist,'' Otto Preminger's ''Whirlpool'' and the spectacle of an enormous female elephant padding around the Gagosian Gallery (in his 2003 knockout ''Play Dead; Real Time'') can be investigated on the second and sixth floors of the Museum of Modern Art through Sept. 4. 11 West 53rd Street, Manhattan, (212) 708-9400."
2006-06-11T00:00:00Z,"A picture caption last Sunday with the continuation of a cover article about the developer Bruce Ratner's projects misstated the site of his Atlantic Yards development. It is on rail yards and other land in Prospect Heights and on a block in Park Slope. It is not in Downtown Brooklyn, although it is near that neighborhood. In addition, three credits were omitted. A picture of the New York Times building was by Angel Franco/The New York Times. A picture of Mr. Ratner with Frank Gehry was by John Marshall Mantel/Associated Press.

2006-06-11T00:00:00Z,"As a student of social movements and an occasional political blogger, I had hoped that the Web offered a more democratic space for a wide variety of voices, and in theory, that was what blogs were supposed to offer (Matt Bai, May 28). The reality has been that those who run the blog sites create an elitism that simply mirrors the traditional political arena, where those with the most connections get the most airplay. As Bai suggests, these new avenues will not change the current political configuration but will simply meld into it. Tina Gentzkow Portland, Ore."
2006-06-11T00:00:00Z,"In 2003, Tovah Feldshuh secured wide critical praise and a long Broadway run by reincarnating a ghost. Now, starring in ''Hello, Dolly!'' at the Paper Mill Playhouse in Millburn, she is trying hard to keep a couple of ghosts off the stage. Ms. Feldshuh's Broadway success -- she was nominated for a Tony Award -- was the one-woman show ''Golda's Balcony,'' in which night after night, with the help of makeup artists, she transformed herself into a convincing Golda Meir. Now, on the Paper Mill stage, she is Dolly Gallagher Levi. But she is decisively not Carol Channing or Barbra Streisand."

This is the year that control over the state budget has moved solidly into the governor's office. The Legislature's role, steadily diminishing over the last few years, has been whittled down to that of official supplicant. Gov. George Pataki has essentially taken on the role of state parent, and New York's 212 legislators can do nothing more than whine, plead, denounce and delay."

2006-06-11T00:00:00Z,"Anthony and Federico Terzano -- first-generation Italian-Americans, brothers and partners in the storefront restaurant Babbone -- are big, personable guys who, in the great Italian tradition, want to feed you to make you happy. On a recent night, Freddy, who works up front, came to our table with both an apology (''We're a little jammed up in the kitchen'') and a plate of boccie-size meatballs to tide us over. His brother, Tony, cooks with as much muscle as finesse, with little regard for calories, which is not to say that his hearty, Abruzzese-style cuisine is not delicious. In her classic book ''Italian Regional Cooking,'' Ada Boni describes the Abruzzo's ''historical tradition of gigantic meals,'' manifest in the panarda, a colossal feast dating to antiquity. Mr. Terzano's plus-size portions do nothing if not honor his ancestry."

Once you find the right street, you can't miss the free-standing brick building, set back from the road, with Colombian and United States flags above the door and, on the roof, a delightful folk sculpture of a crowded bus piled high with passengers and luggage. The best time to visit La Sorpresa, which is open from 6:30 a.m. to 9 p.m. daily, is midmorning, when the breads, sweet rolls and other baked goods come piping hot from the kitchen. It is possible to order coffee and take your sweet roll through the adjoining door to a stool at the bar of the restaurant, which is quiet at that time of day."

2006-06-11T00:00:00Z,"AS summer arrives with its peak electricity demands, the best of all possible worlds apparently prevails in our deregulated electricity market in New York State. A report released in early March by the Department of Public Service in Albany concludes that the wholesale electricity markets in New York ''are among the most advanced in the nation and that wholesale competition has led to significant efficiencies.'' The primary evidence is that the average prices paid by customers, adjusted for inflation, fell by roughly 16 percent from 1996 to 2004. This drop is indeed good news, and many have seized on it as evidence of the deregulated market's health. Unfortunately, this conclusion is incorrect. Deregulated markets have failed to prompt the investments needed to ensure a reliable future supply, particularly in New York City, Long Island and the greater metropolitan area. Furthermore, New York State still has the highest average price of electricity in the continental United States. In spite of our major hydroelectric plants at Niagara and Messina, the average retail price in New York State in 2004 (12.5 cents per kilowatt hour) was 50 percent higher than the price in Pennsylvania (8 cents per kilowatt hour)."

But are these students ''volunteering''? Volunteer work should give the volunteer an altruistic sense of satisfaction that he or she is helping without personal gain. Students cannot possibly understand the true value of volunteer work if their motivations are based, at least partly, on societal pressures to gain and not on genuine concern.

2006-06-11T00:00:00Z,"The South Korean artist ATTA KIM's best-known body of work is a series called ''The Museum Project'' (1995-2002), for which he photographed his human subjects -- families, nude couples, maimed war veterans -- locked inside plexiglass exhibition cases like specimens on display. The series eventually took a religious turn with models posing as Buddhist deities. The pictures in his first major American solo show, at the INTERNATIONAL CENTER OF PHOTOGRAPHY, continue in this spiritual trajectory. Filmed using long exposure times, figures, landscapes and religious icons have been turned into apparitions. People, art and museums may last for a while, Mr. Kim seems to say, but all things eventually melt away. Through Aug. 27, 1133 Avenue of the Americas, at 43rd Street, Manhattan, (212) 857-0000. Photography has been an existential mirror and also a social tool for the American artist LORNA SIMPSON, who has a midcareer survey at the Museum of Contemporary Art in Los Angeles. Ms. Simpson, born in 1960, uses combinations of image and text to examine gender, race and history from an oblique, conceptualist perspective. Her serial pictures of figures standing with their backs to the camera or with their faces obscured have implied narratives. But it is the viewer who fills in the story line. Through July 10, 250 South Grand Avenue, Los Angeles, (213) 626-6222. If you miss the Simpson show in Los Angeles, you can catch it at the Whitney Museum of American Art next year and elsewhere. But that is not the case with ''CASAS GRANDES AND THE CERAMIC ART OF THE ANCIENT SOUTHWEST,'' at the ART INSTITUTE OF CHICAGO, which will not travel. The ceramic art produced by Indian communities in northwest Mexico and the American Southwest between 1200 and 1400 is among the most beautiful anywhere. The Mimbres vessels from what is now New Mexico, with their fantastic painted figures and animals, may be familiar. But this border-dissolving exhibition expands the story of a great ceramic tradition into Mexico itself. Through Aug. 13, 111 South Michigan Avenue, Chicago, (312) 443-3600."

But once the red carpet has been rolled up at Radio City, as it will be Monday morning after Sunday night's awards, it's open season for the smaller fry. The week is thick with theater openings away from the Great White Way. First up is ''BURLEIGH GRIME$,'' a comedy by ROGER KIRBY about a neophyte Wall Street trader and his mentor. The astringent WENDIE MALICK, a regular on the snarky sitcom ''Just Shoot Me,'' stars alongside MARK MOSES, the killer widower on ''Desperate Housewives.'' The show also features music by the ''Dirty Rotten Scoundrels'' composer DAVID YAZBEK, who seems to like writing for bad guys. DAVID WARREN directs. Opens Tuesday at New World Stages, 340 West 50th Street, (212) 239-6200; $70. In ''THE WATER'S EDGE,'' the new play by THERESA REBECK at the Second Stage Theater, drama begins to boil when a woman and her two adult children receive a visit from her ex-husband, long estranged. KATE BURTON and TONY GOLDWYN play the former spouses. The play is set at a lakeside house, the kind of place where unexpected, possibly disturbing things are wont to occur. Opens Wednesday, 307 West 43rd Street, (212) 246-4422; $58 to $65. The Atlantic Theater Company makes its first foray into new musicals with ''SPRING AWAKENING,'' which boasts a score by DUNCAN SHEIK, best known as a pop-rock performer and composer. Mr. Sheik has evinced some disaffection from the old-school musical in interviews, and certainly the source material, Frank Wedekind's once-scandalous 1891 play about sexual exploration among teenagers, suggests that this will not be your run-of-the-mill singalong show.

He was ''the Z word,'' the villain-for-all-occasions, the default to turn to whenever American commanders looked for causes and patterns in a conflict that, at the time, they had only begun to figure their way through. He was the devil's pimpernel -- now in Falluja, now in Baghdad, now in Mosul. He moved undetected across a map that was an obstacle course of checkpoints and curfews and roadside explosions and traffic back-ups behind American military convoys -- enough to make a nervous wreck of the most placid traveler, let alone a man sharing with Osama bin Laden the grim distinction of a $25-million American bounty on his head."

Nanking, a recently opened restaurant in New Hyde Park, named for a former capital of China and proclaiming on its marquee that it is Thai and Chinese, does not specialize in the familiar. Patrons who expect complimentary crispy noodles, pots of hot tea, rice with their entrees and fortune cookies at the end of the meal may be taken aback. Most of the surprises, though, are pleasant ones, for the décor and the food are appealing. This is a beautiful restaurant with hammered copper tabletops, red plush chairs and banquette seating.

Two months ago, the city manager, John J. Laffey, first proposed a $72.4 million budget that included a 25 percent tax increase. City Council members offered alternatives to reduce the increase, but partisan wrangling divided the five-member council. Under the City Charter, because there was no consensus on an alternative, Mr. Laffey's original budget went into effect on June 1."

How likely is this to happen, and what can one do if it does? -- Jeremy Woolfe, Brussels It's down to the law of averages catching up with you. Bumping, or ''involuntary denied boarding,'' happens because airlines typically oversell flights by up to 50 percent to compensate for people who fail to turn up. For instance, Judith Goldberg of Tel Aviv writes: ''I flew Austrian Airlines from Tel Aviv to Delhi, via Vienna. When I arrived at the transfer desk, two and a half hours before the Delhi flight, I was told I had no seat reservation, the flight was overbooked, and I would be wait-listed -- no matter that I had paid months in advance and was joining a tour.

2006-06-11T00:00:00Z,"To the Editor: Your policy of assigning reviews to unbiased third parties has been violated by your assignment of ''A G-Man's Life: The FBI, Being 'Deep Throat,' and the Struggle for Honor in Washington,'' by Mark Felt and me, to John Dean (May 7). It would be hard to imagine a reviewer more biased than Dean. He was convicted of a crime and disbarred as a result of both Felt's investigation of Watergate and his role as ''Deep Throat.'' Additionally, the book assigned for review deals sneeringly with Dean's lack of integrity. Dean himself has written two books assessing the identity and motives of Deep Throat, both of which were proven embarrassingly wrong in light of the recent revelation of Felt's role. Dean's bias has resulted in palpably false assertions in the review, the heart of which, ironically, is that Felt has supposedly made factual errors in this book. Dean claims, for example, that, contrary to Felt's assertion in our book, John ''Ehrlichman and I were out of the White House at the time'' of L. Patrick Gray's resignation. In fact, Gray resigned and was replaced on April 27, 1973, while Dean and Ehrlichman were employed in the White House until April 30. Dean also states unequivocally that Felt was wrong in writing that the ''White House'' was ''following'' the Watergate investigation ''through L. Patrick Gray.'' In fact, Dean himself, as White House counsel, received multiple F.B.I. investigative reports from Gray, as any informed observer knows. Finally, Dean's claim that it is ''absurd'' to say Daniel Ellsberg had been ''briefed'' rests upon deliberate misreading. Felt claimed only that Ellsberg had been briefed ''on the subject,'' which is the Kissinger wiretaps generally, revealed in Time magazine three months earlier, about which his lawyers had since been inquiring; and not that Ellsberg knew that he had actually been overheard. The oleaginous Dean's attempt to alchemize these provably false charges into mere technicalities engenders yet more falsity. Ehrlichman was influential with, and praised by, Nixon through the end. In fact, Dean devoured a foot-high stack of F.B.I. summaries, ''302'' and ''airtel'' investigative reports, which he often kept on his desk, admitting in ''Blind Ambition'' that ''on a park bench, I told Gray I needed the materials to keep track of the investigation's progress.'' In any case, Felt's work is proven not to be ''riddled with errors''; someone else's, though, is. Because Dean's accusations of inaccuracy are at the core of his criticism of the book, they cannot be dismissed as inconsequential. Accordingly, Dean's obvious bias has sullied, actually and substantially, the integrity of the review process. John D. O'Connor San Francisco John Dean replies: John O'Connor claims I am biased against Mark Felt, so I wrote a review falsely claiming his book with Felt has errors. I do confess a bias -- toward honest history, but I have none toward Mark Felt. In fact, when it was revealed that he was Deep Throat, I made highly favorable comments publicly, at a time when my former Nixon White House colleagues were busy trashing him. (I publicly congratulated O'Connor as well, but I stand by my Deep Throat sleuthing, for Mark Felt does not fit all the clues found in ''All the President's Men.'') As for Felt's sneering, since he does it to everyone in the Nixon White House, and he is deeply confused about the facts, I did not take it personally. O'Connor asserts that Felt's investigation of Watergate and his role as ''Deep Throat'' are reason for my bias, but he could not be more wrong. The historical record (testimony and Nixon tapes) show that after trying to persuade my colleagues to end the Watergate coverup -- which was not being investigated by the F.B.I. at the time, for only the Senate Watergate Committee was exploring it as a potential matter of misconduct -- I went to the United States Attorney's office on my own initiative to end the coverup. Felt had nothing whatsoever to do with my decision. As for Deep Throat, according to ''All the President's Men,'' he never mentioned my name until April 16, 1973 (after I had been dealing with the prosecutors for several weeks), and then he gave Woodward totally false information about me, like claiming I had talked with Senator Howard Baker, who was ''in the bag'' -- which was untrue -- and that Nixon personally threatened to send me to jail if I told the prosecutors about ''national security matters'' -- which was also untrue. The distortions in O'Connor's letter, in which he misstates what I wrote in my review and uses his misstatements to assert I have falsely accused the book of being in error, necessarily require a bit of explanation. In my review I wrote: ''Felt, who was passed over for the director's job, claims that in the period after Gray's departure from the F.B.I., he 'knew that as long as John Dean and John Ehrlichman were in the White House,' he 'would have less chance of receiving the appointment than the man in the moon.' But Ehrlichman and I were out of the White House at that time.'' Note, however, how O'Connor has twisted my words, writing: ''Dean claims . . . that, contrary to Felt's assertion in our book, 'Ehrlichman and I were out of the White House at the time' of L. Patrick Gray's resignation.'' (Emphasis added because I did not mention Gray's resignation.) Here are the facts. Pat Gray resigned on April 27, 1973, and President Nixon selected William Ruckelshaus, the head of the Environmental Protection Agency, to serve as acting director that same day. Felt/O'Connor write that Felt understood that Ruckelshaus ''would barely warm the director's chair'' (for Ruckelshaus had said he did not want the job of F.B.I. director). They then explain that on April 30, 1973 (according to The New York Times, for the date is not in the book), when Felt presented Ruckelshaus with a copy of a telegram from senior F.B.I. officials to the president urging Nixon to appoint someone from within the F.B.I. to be director, that Felt did not have himself in mind. The reason, Felt/ O'Connor write, was that Ehrlichman and I were in the White House. But that is not true. O'Connor's acknowledgment that he knew Ehrlichman and I had left the White House the very day that Felt decides he has no chance of becoming director because we are in the White House makes absolutely no sense. In my review I wrote that ''Felt seems unaware that the White House followed the F.B.I.'s Watergate investigation through Henry Petersen, chief of the criminal division, not through the acting director, L. Patrick Gray.'' Note again how O'Connor has twisted my statement, writing that ''Dean also states unequivocally that Felt was wrong in writing that the 'White House' was following the Watergate investigation 'through L. Patrick Gray.' (Emphasis added because that is not what I wrote.) Yet he makes his claim that I am wrong based on a statement I did not make, nor do I dispute: ''In fact, Dean himself, as White House counsel, received multiple F.B.I. investigative reports from Gray, as any informed observer knows.'' Any informed observer would also know that I testified on repeated occasions that there was nothing in the F.B.I. material I received from Gray that was particularly useful to the White House and that I followed the Watergate investigation through Henry Petersen. This is the historical record I alluded to, which O'Connor simply ignores. Lastly, I wrote Felt/ O'Connor claim ''that Daniel Ellsberg, who leaked the Pentagon Papers, 'had certainly been briefed' on the fact that he had been wiretapped at the White House's behest, an absurd assertion.'' The assertion is absurd for several reasons. To set up this claim that Ellsberg had been briefed about White House wiretaps, Felt/O'Connor write that ''during the closing days'' of Ellsberg's trial, ''The Washington Post alleged that the White House Plumbers had placed wiretaps on Ellsberg's phone.'' Felt/O'Connor have mislabeled the so-called Kissinger national security wiretaps (from 1969-70), one of which was placed on former Kissinger aide Morton Halperin, for this tap picked up some 15 conversations with Ellsberg -- a fact the government lied about, including, apparently, Mark Felt. The Plumbers (who operated in 1971) did not wiretap Ellsberg. Ellsberg's memoir, ''Secrets: A Memoir of Vietnam,'' and the Pentagon Papers report that his attorneys made repeated inquiries to the government about whether Ellsberg had been wiretapped but were always given ''formal denials''; nowhere in his memoir is there a hint that Ellsberg had been briefed on the White House wiretaps. (Ellsberg confirmed to me that, in fact, he had not been briefed, and he too found Felt's contention ''absurd.'') Notwithstanding O'Connor's letter, I repeat what I stated in the review: ''A G-Man's Life'' is riddled with errors. I had only mentioned a few of them because I had no desire to embarrass Felt or O'Connor. I will resist characterizing O'Connor's letter because it speaks for itself. The editor replies: Although John Dean's review of ''A G-Man's Life'' disclosed that he is mentioned in the book, the Book Review should have encouraged him to be more explicit about his dealings with Mark Felt during the Watergate controversy."

2006-06-11T00:00:00Z,"AS summer arrives with its peak electricity demands, the best of all possible worlds apparently prevails in our deregulated electricity market in New York State. A report released in early March by the Department of Public Service in Albany concludes that the wholesale electricity markets in New York ''are among the most advanced in the nation and that wholesale competition has led to significant efficiencies.'' The primary evidence is that the average prices paid by customers, adjusted for inflation, fell by roughly 16 percent from 1996 to 2004. This drop is indeed good news, and many have seized on it as evidence of the deregulated market's health. Unfortunately, this conclusion is incorrect. Deregulated markets have failed to prompt the investments needed to ensure a reliable future supply, particularly in New York City, Long Island and the greater metropolitan area. Furthermore, New York State still has the highest average price of electricity in the continental United States. In spite of our major hydroelectric plants at Niagara and Messina, the average retail price in New York State in 2004 (12.5 cents per kilowatt hour) was 50 percent higher than the price in Pennsylvania (8 cents per kilowatt hour)."

2006-06-11T00:00:00Z,"To the Editor: Re ''The Lost Summer'' (June 4): Reading your article, I was filled with frustration and outrage. Yet another article on the workaholic youngsters of today and their vicariously overachieving parents? I wonder how many parents of ninth and 10th graders will see this article and push their children ever harder, worrying that they are falling behind in the race to get the ''gold medal'' of an acceptance into Harvard."
2006-06-11T00:00:00Z,"MY spring planting never occurs in spring. I have to use the phrase ''spring planting'' loosely to accommodate the fact that it always happens in summer. I start dreaming in March, but by June only delusions have sprouted. I buy seeds, imagining I will have time to cultivate them in little pots or trays. In reality, my tote bag and kitchen cabinets hold packets of seed pods long past their expiration dates. I yearn with a fever bred by generations. Everybody in my family was a closet gardener in a city apartment, producing pale lunar indoor stalks on the shadowy shelf above the winter coats."

Ms. West, who had been running Capital One Financial's domestic credit card business, received a pay package worth more than $20 million for joining Penney last week, according to a contract that was filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission."
2006-06-11T00:00:00Z,"MARK D. BOUGHTON, the mayor of Danbury who won a national reputation for talking tough to illegal immigrants, is a descendant of immigrants. Only his French-British ancestors arrived in this country a few decades after the Mayflower. It is understandable that one could forget after all this time that coming to a new land is an awkward business, and that the natives may not be happy with the newcomers' outlandish ways. Let's remember that despite the initial good will that we romanticize on Thanksgiving, the Indians grew quite upset with the Pilgrim interlopers and killed more than a few."

2006-06-11T00:00:00Z,"THE sign on the Lou Gehrig baseball says ''Not for Sale,'' but that does not stop memorabilia collectors and sports fans who flock to the Hobby Shop in Aberdeen from asking Marvin Schutzer, the owner, to name his price. ''One guy walked in here and said: 'How much do you want for it? I'll pay anything, anything,' '' Mr. Schutzer, 65, recalled. ''But I told him what I tell everyone else, that the ball means too much to me to ever want to part with it and that one day it will go to my oldest son, with instructions never to sell.''"
2006-06-11T00:00:00Z,"At its best, all dance taps into a sense of ritual communion with something larger than the self. The Korean dancer MYUNG SOO KIM makes this explicit in ''MODERN ECHOES OF THE ANCIENT,'' an evening of solos that call upon the traditional shaman dances of her homeland. Between the solos, Ms. Kim will sing ''Arirang,'' peasant songs of resistance that document the woes of Korea's troubled history, and change her elaborate costumes onstage. She offers a kind of primer on traditional Korean dance, filtered through both personal history and contemporary sensibility, that sounds fascinating. Wednesday through Friday at 8 p.m., Saturday at 2 and 8 p.m. and next Sunday at 2 and 7 p.m., the Duke on 42nd Street, 229 West 42nd Street, second floor, (212) 239-6200 or www.telecharge.com; $35, $25 for students and 65+. During American Ballet Theater's recent Metropolitan Opera House season, audiences had just one chance to see the glorious Kirov Ballet star DIANA VISHNEVA perform the title role in ''Giselle.'' This week she will give two performances as the village maiden betrayed by her noble lover and transformed into a Wili, one of a band of haunted spirits condemned to destroy the men who deceived them. In this ballet, Ms. Vishneva's technical command and exquisitely articulated upper body are merely at the service of her dramatic powers. Wednesday and Saturday at 8 p.m., Lincoln Center, (212) 362-6000; $23 to $100. There has been a lot of buzz about the Finnish-born choreographer JORMA ELO recently. He began to make a name for himself after joining the Nederlands Dans Theater in 1990 and put himself on the map in this country when he made the critically applauded ''Sharp Side of Dark'' for the Boston Ballet in 2002. Last year he was appointed the resident choreographer of that company, and this week the New York City Ballet will perform the premiere of his as-yet-unnamed Diamond Project commission, to music by Vivaldi and Biber. Good ballet choreographers are in short supply these days, so here's hoping. Friday and Saturday at 8 p.m., New York State Theater, Lincoln Center, (212) 870-5570; $30 to $86."

But if you are not a resident of one of the 26 Connecticut towns with a shoreline on Long Island Sound, chances are you will face high ticket prices for parking or admission before you dig your toes in the sand. The situation is a state embarrassment. Now Stamford has made a more neighborly move to lower nonresident beach parking fees, and it is something other towns should emulate."

2006-06-11T00:00:00Z,"I have been a New Yorker for decades now, but I call Butler County my home. Your article captured the spirit and heart of this often overlooked corner of western Pennsylvania. I grew up in its rolling hills and, in a different generation, watched high-school friends go off to Vietnam and listened as my dad and his friends quietly discussed their experiences in World War II, though only if prodded. My view then, as it is now, is that returning veterans of all generations do not receive the proper medical and social help that they need to reintegrate within their communities. Veterans Affairs hospitals in Butler and elsewhere are simply not provided the resources to do the job. This article was a fitting tribute to the founding fathers of Butler County who served the military, through the ensuing generations who continued to serve. Perhaps it will also serve to stimulate dialogue on the assistance that returning veterans have earned from their service. Such support knows no political boundaries. Cindy Morgan-Olson New York"

The menu will also feature several kinds of fish, preferably caught within miles of the restaurant and preferably served within hours of being caught. Mr. Nischan, who is active in the organic food movement, is teaming with Mr. Newman to create a restaurant called the Dressing Room next to the Westport Country Playhouse that will serve traditional American foods and rely on produce, cheese and meat from state farmers."

2006-06-11T00:00:00Z,"To the Editor: As a high school junior, I commiserated with the teenagers featured in ''The Lost Summer.'' Our generation has a remarkably new criterion by which we can be rejected from our top-choice universities. We must worry not only about our SAT scores and G.P.A.'s, but also about how we spend our free time. If one applicant worked with a research lab on debilitating diseases and another reinforced a church in sub-Saharan Africa, is there room for the bright, well-rounded applicant from our parents' generations? Somewhere between doing summer course work for Advanced Placement classes, volunteering as an emergency medical technician and working two jobs, I forgot to make room in my schedule to work in an orphanage.

2006-06-11T00:00:00Z,"If ''To be, or not to be'' conjures images of a wan and slender Prince of Denmark prowling the gloomy turrets of Elsinore Castle as he ponders his own mortality, well, think again. Picture an overweight, bleary-eyed hulk of a man dressed in his underwear, slumped in an armchair, whisky flask in hand, glass poised at his lips. And listen as a magnificent actor named Morlan Higgins declaims Shakespeare's immortal text in a voice tinged with enough personal regret and heartbreak to move one to tears. ''Exits and Entrances'' is the South African playwright Athol Fugard's latest work, and the role of Andre Huguenet, a legendary Afrikaan actor for whom the writer served as ''dresser'' in the early stages of his own aborted acting career, is any performer's dream part. Where else, in a 90-minute outing, would one have the chance to tear into Hamlet's melancholy soliloquy, stumble bloody-faced and eyeless through Oedipus's howling monologue, pour forth the tormented ramblings of Cardinal Mindszenty in Bridget Boland's ''Prisoner''?"
2006-06-11T00:00:00Z,"High school athletes will soon be living the legacy of Coach Codey. Details are in place for random drug testing in championship events, as Richard J. Codey, then the governor, directed in an executive order in December. Testing will start this fall. Under the plan adopted by the New Jersey State Interscholastic Athletic Association last week, New Jersey will become the first state to require random steroid screening of scholastic athletes. Five percent of about 10,000 players in state tournaments will have to take urine tests after championship games."

W. Apple Jr.'s recollection of Leon's Russian Grill in Tehran (May 28). That is where my future husband took me for dinner on our first date. Thank you, Mr. Apple, for mentioning that special restaurant, a very good one. My favorite was karsky, the lamb dish, a rack of chops grilled to perfection. Karina Lima Patterson, N.Y."

2006-06-11T00:00:00Z,"JUSTIN G. SCHILLER, who collects and sells art and old and rare books, is shopping for a Manhattan apartment. But he has no intention of plunking down a single penny for one. Rather, he plans to do something fittingly old-fashioned: barter. In a time when half a million dollars barely buys a studio in New York, Mr. Schiller is hoping to trade a watercolor drawing by his longtime friend Maurice Sendak, perhaps best known for his children's book ''Where the Wild Things Are,'' for an apartment."
2006-06-11T00:00:00Z,"THERE are four large cardboard packing boxes sitting in my front hall that irritate me every time I walk by them, which is many times a day. These packages arrived at my doorstep via U.P.S. several weeks ago, predating my daughter's arrival home from college by a day or two. They sit, a glaring reminder of how difficult it can be to reabsorb the college student back into the household. The boxes are packed to the brim with dirty laundry, blankets and pillows, sweaters and scarves, a couple of stretched canvases, framed photos and much more -- I have only skimmed the top layers. (My daughter ships what she doesn't store on campus, since her college is far enough away that she travels there by plane.) The key point, however, is that both she and the boxes have been home since May and still, they remain unpacked."
2006-06-11T00:00:00Z,"MICHEL NISCHAN says we should know where our food comes from. At the Westport restaurant he plans to open with Paul Newman in August, the food will come from cows and vegetables raised without relying on hormones or pesticides. The menu will also feature several kinds of fish, preferably caught within miles of the restaurant and preferably served within hours of being caught. Mr. Nischan, who is active in the organic food movement, is teaming with Mr. Newman to create a restaurant called the Dressing Room next to the Westport Country Playhouse that will serve traditional American foods and rely on produce, cheese and meat from state farmers."

Platner of Parlin, N.J. The Rev. Carlye J. Hughes performed the ceremony at St. James' Episcopal Church in New York. Mrs. Platner, 30, is the public relations and marketing manager of Angel Sanchez, a designer of evening wear and bridal gowns in New York. She graduated from Sweet Briar College.

2006-06-11T00:00:00Z,"To the Editor: During the 19th century my great-great-great grandfather, James Sinclair, was at the head of the oldest stoneworking business in New York City, which was named after him and founded in 1820. He furnished the stonework for the city's bank buildings, the Stock Exchange Building, the Astor Library Building, St. Luke's Hospital, the old Times Building in 1857 and the residences of many prominent figures. He saw Wall Street built over twice and took down stone he had laid for buildings now outdated, giving way to new structures which he also built."
2006-06-11T00:00:00Z,"THE sign on the Lou Gehrig baseball says ''Not for Sale,'' but that does not stop memorabilia collectors and sports fans who flock to the Hobby Shop in Aberdeen from asking Marvin Schutzer, the owner, to name his price. ''One guy walked in here and said: 'How much do you want for it? I'll pay anything, anything,' '' Mr. Schutzer, 65, recalled. ''But I told him what I tell everyone else, that the ball means too much to me to ever want to part with it and that one day it will go to my oldest son, with instructions never to sell.''"

2006-06-11T00:00:00Z,"To the Sports Editor: Re ''Marion Jones Adds New York Event to Comeback Trail'' (June 3): As a track and field official, and a former competitor, I am frustrated by your limited coverage of track and field. We get an occasional item about a top athlete's performance in a popular event (usually the 100 or the mile) and an overabundance of articles about Marion Jones, who has not done much recently."
2006-06-11T00:00:00Z,"TOWARD the end of the ''I Love Lucy'' television series, which ran from 1951 to 1957, the Ricardo family moved from New York City to ''the country'' -- Westport, to be exact -- and Lucy started raising chickens. From then on, all of America saw Connecticut as ''the country.'' Oddly enough, that moment marked the beginning of the mass exodus of upwardly mobile New Yorkers to the suburbs of the metropolitan region -- and the beginning of the end of animal agriculture in this state."
2006-06-11T00:00:00Z,"To the Editor: Congratulations for your enlightening and indispensable tribute to New York's unsung and largely uncelebrated stoneworkers and their legacy (''Written in Stone,'' June 4)."
2006-06-11T00:00:00Z,"MY spring planting never occurs in spring. I have to use the phrase ''spring planting'' loosely to accommodate the fact that it always happens in summer. I start dreaming in March, but by June only delusions have sprouted. I buy seeds, imagining I will have time to cultivate them in little pots or trays. In reality, my tote bag and kitchen cabinets hold packets of seed pods long past their expiration dates. I yearn with a fever bred by generations. Everybody in my family was a closet gardener in a city apartment, producing pale lunar indoor stalks on the shadowy shelf above the winter coats."
2006-06-11T00:00:00Z,"THE showcase promoted a number of underground Asian bands, but most of the audience at the Knitting Factory in TriBeCa on this Sunday night had come out to see a three-man rap group, the Notorious MSG, whose account of an unusual trajectory from the kitchens of Chinatown restaurants to the local stage was the big draw. By 9 p.m., with fists and camcorders raised, the crowd cheered as the group bounded onto the stage. They were outfitted in matching black Adidas tracksuits, sunglasses, and three distinct hairstyles: Jheri-curled mullet, frizzy dreadlocks and bowl cut."
2006-06-11T00:00:00Z,"To the Editor: I am a psychologist and a life member of the American Psychological Association. The opinion expressed by Stephen Behnke, director of ethics of the association, that participation of psychologists in the interrogation of prisoners at Guantánamo and such places (''Psychologists Preferred for Detainees,'' National Briefing item, June 7) is acceptable and ''a valuable contribution'' certainly does not reflect my view nor, necessarily, that of the membership as a whole."
2006-06-11T00:00:00Z,"The new government of Iraq has decided to postpone any demand for negotiations to establish a more formal legal basis for the presence of American and other foreign troops on its soil, Iraqi and American officials said this week. Instead, these officials said, Iraq will allow the current United Nations mandate to remain in effect beyond a deadline next Thursday for a review of Security Council Resolution 1637, which authorizes the American-led military coalition to continue combat operations."

2006-06-11T00:00:00Z,"Has your grande/half-skim-half-soy/mocha/no-foam latte lost its luster? At Café Beethoven in Chatham, you'll find specialty drinks reminiscent of a Viennese cafe. The Fur Elise ($3.25), which combines cocoa, coffee, steamed milk and orange wedge, goes well with one of the cafe's pastries (petits fours, napoleons, croissants) or muffins and sweet breads (a morning favorite is banana-blueberry bread, at $1.25 a slice)."
2006-06-11T00:00:00Z,"To the Sports Editor: Gary Sheffield and Hideki Matsui are great players, no doubt. Their replacements in the batting order provide a level of intensity, scrappiness and hunger to prove themselves that the Yankees have lacked in their starting lineup since the championship years. Strange as it seems, the Yankees are a better team without an All-Star at every position. Steve Hermanos San Francisco"
2006-06-11T00:00:00Z,"THE image is etched in his memory: a woman caressing the name of a soldier at the Vietnam Veterans Memorial in Washington. Ned Benton, a college professor and history buff, wondered about the story behind that name, which made him think about the stories behind the names of the dozens of soldiers memorialized in the Village of Larchmont, where he lives. Eight years ago, as the village was updating its Web site, Mr. Benton and his colleagues at the Larchmont Historical Society had an idea: Why not use the Internet to tell the stories of these soldiers? The challenge was to uncover the information."

2006-06-11T00:00:00Z,"THE killing of Iraq's most wanted terrorist leader, Abu Musab al-Zarqawi, won't end the country's civil strife. There may be as many as 100 insurgent groups waging war against United States forces, and often, each other. They are not fully understood, in part because their relationships seem to evolve from month to month. Already this year, several new groups have emerged."

Boerum Hill Condo $695,000 BROOKLYN: 497 Pacific Street (at Third Street), #2A A 1,200-square-foot, one-bedroom, two-bath condo in an old sail-making factory building, converted about 20 years ago.

The backyard pool area, including the spa and waterfall, is private and resortlike. CONS: This is deep suburbia; it may take a few extra minutes of driving time to get to a cup of coffee. Condo Conversion $1,779,240 CONNECTICUT: 25 Forest Street, Stamford A 2,400-square-foot condo with three bedrooms, three baths, an office, a new kitchen and a terrace.

Smaller units in the building start as low as $376,000. CONS: This project is not for buyers in a hurry -- the remaining tenants had until June 10 to decide whether to buy, which means many conversions are only just beginning."
2006-06-11T00:00:00Z,"A listing in the Summer Arts Calendar on May 21, about Shakespeare on the Sound in Pinkney Park in Rowayton, misstated the admission policy and the address.

2006-06-11T00:00:00Z,"MY spring planting never occurs in spring. I have to use the phrase ''spring planting'' loosely to accommodate the fact that it always happens in summer. I start dreaming in March, but by June only delusions have sprouted. I buy seeds, imagining I will have time to cultivate them in little pots or trays. In reality, my tote bag and kitchen cabinets hold packets of seed pods long past their expiration dates. I yearn with a fever bred by generations. Everybody in my family was a closet gardener in a city apartment, producing pale lunar indoor stalks on the shadowy shelf above the winter coats."
2006-06-11T00:00:00Z,"It's all been said before, at one university or another. And so, in trying to come up with something new, many commencement speakers do considerable research on what to say -- and what it is permissible to say -- before they address graduating students. This year, Judith Resnik, a legal scholar, could win the exhaustive-preparation prize. For her speech at Bryn Mawr, Dr. Resnik reviewed over 100 years of commencement addresses."
2006-06-11T00:00:00Z,"The National Academy of Sciences released a report on alternatives to the Indian Point nuclear reactors in Buchanan on Tuesday that pleased critics and supporters of the plant. The report, commissioned three years ago in a bill sponsored by Representative Nita M. Lowey, a Westchester Democrat, found that New York could replace the energy generated by Indian Point if the reactors were shut down, but that other options would be costlier, create more pollution, and leave New Yorkers more vulnerable to natural gas shortages."
2006-06-11T00:00:00Z,"When Bettina S. Simon quit on June 1 as the chief legal officer at Mannatech, a vitamins and nutritional supplements manufacturer in Coppell, Tex., she departed with some pretty sizable, not to mention unusual, parting gifts. According to a company filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission, Ms. Simon, 57, received her ''executive desk, executive chair and two side chairs.'' That is in addition to her company car and a monthly consulting contract that will pay her $10,000 a month for a year -- two far more common items handed out to departing corporate executives."
2006-06-11T00:00:00Z,"IT is daunting enough to mount a direct challenge to the likes of Toyota and Honda, but Hyundai's quest to join the top ranks of global automakers has been complicated by the legal troubles of its chairman in Korea and by turbulence in the top ranks of its American operations. No longer a late-night punch line, the Hyundai-Kia Automotive Group now ranks No. 6 in worldwide sales, according to Automotive News, a trade publication. And Hyundai was already one of the world's fastest-growing major automakers when it opened an assembly plant -- its first American factory -- in Montgomery, Ala., in 2005. Cars from Hyundai and its Kia subsidiary, which not long ago were cellar dwellers in the quality and reliability ratings of J. D. Power & Associates and other survey firms, have shown steady improvement. Some have even achieved best-in-class status."
2006-06-11T00:00:00Z,"To the Editor: In ''Shameless in the Senate'' (column, June 5), Paul Krugman writes about the estate tax repeal and ''moderate Republicans like Lincoln Chafee of Rhode Island who consistently cave in to the party's right wing.'' This statement is puzzling. Anyone familiar with my voting record would never use the phrase ''cave in.'' In his Feb. 10 column, Mr. Krugman wrote about the tax cut debate of 2001 that ''even some Republican senators were skeptical'' of the $1.6 trillion tax cut and were responsible for scaling it back to $1.35 trillion. This, as Mr. Krugman said, led to the ''sunsets'' and the expiration of the estate tax in 2010. The skeptical Republican senators were actually only three, myself being one."
2006-06-11T00:00:00Z,"Works of religious art are generally found in churches or in the permanent-collection rooms of major museums. It is rare to see them in a contemporary art museum. But for the next nine months, at the Hudson Valley Center for Contemporary Art in Peekskill, ''Reverence'' invites viewers to lift their eyes to spiritual heights, and depths. As an agnostic who has spent a great deal of time at churches and temples looking at religious art, I approached this exhibition with a measure of skepticism; how, I wondered, could contemporary artists compete with the great masters of religious art?"
2006-06-11T00:00:00Z,"To the Sports Editor: I was on the sideline of a soccer game in New Jersey watching my 14-year-old son in a tournament when a player on the opposing team directed an ethnic slur at one of my son's teammates. This is not an infrequent occurrence in youth soccer. The league has a no-tolerance policy for such behavior, but it is rarely enforced."

2006-06-11T00:00:00Z,"Call it a case of revising taxation with uneven representation. First, the taxation: Last week, New Jersey's top two lawmakers announced that they were launching a series of summer committee hearings on strategies to beat back the frequent increases in what are already the nation's highest property taxes."
2006-06-11T00:00:00Z,"In the basement of a weathered grocery store on a gentrifying stretch of downtown White Plains, Feeling Mizik, a Haitian compas band, rehearses every Saturday night. Compas, Haiti's popular music, is rooted in a fusion of African rhythms, Haitian Creole culture and European ballroom dancing. And these days it is frequently updated with strains of hip-hop, funk and salsa, its Creole lyrics meshed with English and Spanish. Ever-changing compas -- also spelled kompa, as it is pronounced, or konpa -- provides Haitian-Americans from Miami to Brooklyn and points in Westchester with a vital link to their past. The members of Feeling Mizik, which may be the only compas band based in Westchester, have been living in White Plains for as long as 35 years and as little as two months. Most of them didn't play compas until they arrived in the United States."
2006-06-11T00:00:00Z,"To the Editor: The assumption underlying ''Why It's Right to Test,'' by Peter Staley (Op-Ed, June 4), is that more people are not testing for H.I.V. because written consent, which is currently required by New York State law, is a barrier. Written consent is not a barrier to patients testing for H.I.V."
2006-06-11T00:00:00Z,"THERE are four large cardboard packing boxes sitting in my front hall that irritate me every time I walk by them, which is many times a day. These packages arrived at my doorstep via U.P.S. several weeks ago, predating my daughter's arrival home from college by a day or two. They sit, a glaring reminder of how difficult it can be to reabsorb the college student back into the household. The boxes are packed to the brim with dirty laundry, blankets and pillows, sweaters and scarves, a couple of stretched canvases, framed photos and much more -- I have only skimmed the top layers. (My daughter ships what she doesn't store on campus, since her college is far enough away that she travels there by plane.) The key point, however, is that both she and the boxes have been home since May and still, they remain unpacked."
2006-06-11T00:00:00Z,"To the Editor: Congratulations to Hunterdon County, N.J., for its public information campaign credited in reducing by half the annual new cases of Lyme disease. By comparison, in Suffolk County, where millions are spent in fighting the much-hyped mosquito-transmitted West Nile Virus (which over the past several years averaged only a few new cases), our public officials scarcely make any reference to the presence of Lyme, despite the number of new cases being in the hundreds annually. They've tried ignoring it. It didn't go away!"
2006-06-11T00:00:00Z,"THE 7:47 a.m. Long Island Rail Road train from Ronkonkoma to Jamaica pulled into the Deer Park station, and Sandra Krebelj-Douglas eyed her fellow passengers carefully. As one of eight official ''note takers'' for the L.I.R.R. Commuters Council, a volunteer group that acts as the voice of the railroad's passengers, she was preparing to monitor riders' behavior in a two-month program to establish the nature and extent of antisocial behavior. Results from the note takers, who ride different lines from different stations, will be used in a report sent to railroad management later in the year."
2006-06-11T00:00:00Z,"KURZ--Israel Beloved husband, dearest father, grandfather, and great grandfather. Always there for all of us. A pillar for his community and his people."
2006-06-11T00:00:00Z,"MENOWITZ--Sophie. Died June 11, 1979, twentyseven long years ago. Loving wife, mother, grandmother. We shall always remember your devotion to your family. Your loving family"
2006-06-11T00:00:00Z,"VILLENCY--Ruth, on June 10, 2006. Beloved wife of the late Maurice. Devoted mother of Roy and Linda Neuberger and Bob and Rowann Villency. Dear grandmother of Juliet and Osher Jungreis, Susan and Shlomo Lancry, Aharon and Ariel Neuberger, Miriam and Alvin Hess, Nechama and Yaakov Slatus, Cara and Joshna Sacks, Eric and Kimberly Villency.

Service Sunday 11:45 at ''The Riverside'', 76th Street and Amsterdam Avenue."
2006-06-11T00:00:00Z,"IF ''shabby'' can be mistaken for ''blighted,'' then yes, the brick apartments at 150 Secatogue Avenue, where the ''No'' on the ''No Vacancy'' sign is intentionally obscured by dirty white paper, qualify. These may be garden apartments, but this is no garden spot. Unlike the landscaping at two brick complexes around the corner on busy Conklin Avenue, where signs advertise luxury apartments and condominiums, the grounds here suffer from terminal neglect. Odd, considering that some of the tenants are the same Latino day laborers hired to manicure the properties of Long Island homeowners who can afford to pay someone else to keep their lawns green and pools pristine."

2006-06-11T00:00:00Z,"ROTHMAN--Lester D., in New York City on June 6 at the age of 94. Born in Brooklyn, New York, Dr. Rothman graduated from NYU School of Medicine and practiced Internal Medicine in New York for over 60 years. He was also a veteran of World War II, serving as a Flight Surgeon in the Army Air Forces in the Asiatic-Pacific Theatre. Survivors include his loving wife, Judith Sadoski, son Dr. Peter M. Rothman of Fort Wayne, Indiana, grandson Wilson J. Rothman of Fort Lee, New Jersey, granddaughter Caroline Rothman Victory of Sarasota, Florida, and many nieces and nephews. Dr. Rothman was predeceased by his first wife, Rosemarie Brancato Rothman, and his two sisters, Jean Rothenberg and Sylvia Palant. In accordance with his wishes, no memorial service is planned. Acknowledgements of his passing may be sent to the American Heart Association."
2006-06-11T00:00:00Z,"The sinuous lines of the fin de siècle textile patterns and Art Nouveau movement have injected a new spirit into the current rigid style of fashion. The most stunning example, large photo at right, worn last month by the New Yorker Ingrid Yonke, was hand-painted to duplicate the cut-velvet 1900 Worth gown next to it, now on view in the Metropolitan Museum of Art's British fashion exhibition. Spring clothes are echoing the flourishes of gates, like the one above, one of the beauties at Old Westbury Gardens, on Long Island. Exotic flowers like the black iris, bottom left, called ''Hello Darkness,'' and the vines of scarlet nasturtiums were just a couple of nature's influences on textiles of the Art Nouveau period."
2006-06-11T00:00:00Z,"To the Editor: It is certainly true that Democrats have failed woefully to build effective organizations at the state and local levels, Ohio being perhaps the most glaring example. But I think that Daniel Galvin (Op-Ed, June 3) misses the most important reason that Democrats are impatient and anxious with Howard Dean's strategy to focus on the long term, rather than on the coming fall elections."
2006-06-11T00:00:00Z,"Sallie L. Krawcheck, the chief financial officer of Citigroup, is widely regarded as one of the most powerful women in business, but she has never been a director of a public corporation. That is about to change because Dell Inc., whose annual meeting will be on July 21, has nominated her to its board. Ms. Krawcheck, who turned 41 in late November, will be more than a decade younger than nine of her fellow Dell directors. But she won't be the youngest."
2006-06-11T00:00:00Z,"To the Editor: The Democratic Party's vision has deteriorated into anti-Republicanism after the failure of its vision of the welfare state as an ideal. If the Democrats don't wake up and realize that more government can evolve only into totalitarianism, all the strategy and tactics for getting elected will be for naught."
2006-06-11T00:00:00Z,"I chuckled as I read the letters (May 28) criticizing Kevin Kelly's article (May 14) on the coming revolution in distributing book content online. The critics are clearly bedfellows in print: writers, publishers a museum curator. The same kind of entrenched folks no doubt resisted the digital transformation of library card catalogs a few years ago. And long before that, blacksmiths and wagonmakers were similarly disposed against the railroaders. All disruptive technologies have their momentary detractors. What an exciting time we readers live in. Sheldon Peck Waban, Mass."
2006-06-11T00:00:00Z,"To the Editor: In ''A World-Class Party'' (May 28), Jeff Z. Klein describes all of the merriment and excitement that will surround the soccer competition in Germany. Of all the venues in Germany, Mr. Klein selects Cologne as his choice because of its ''smart hotels'' and ''culturally sophisticated attractions.'' He singles out one of those attractions, Pascha, described as a ''10-story bordello'' where soccer fans from all over the world are already being welcomed. To add a bit of humor, Mr. Klein mentions that this brothel is ''on the aptly named Hornstrasse.'' I suppose we are all meant to chuckle and wink at this point. It's too bad it's not victimless fun.

In a sense, the restaurant is Déjà Vu all over again: that's the name of the establishment it replaced about six months ago. If you examine Sri Thai's takeout menu, with its intriguing amalgam of Thai and French dishes, you'll see that the restaurant's name has been carefully taped over Déjà Vu's. So have the prices, which (as on the sit-down menu) average about $2 lower."

2006-06-11T00:00:00Z,"THEY MADE AMERICA: From the Steam Engine to the Search Engine -- Two Centuries of Innovators, by Harold Evans with Gail Buckland and David Lefer. (Back Bay/ Little, Brown, $18.95.) Sir Harold, the historian, publisher and journalist, follows up ''The American Century'' (1998) with absorbing profiles of Americans from the Wright brothers to Bill Gates, whose inventiveness changed the way we live. The author sees innovation as ''a distinguishing characteristic of the United States'' -- both a product of and a contributor to American society. Originally published as an illustrated large-format volume, ''They Made America'' was the basis of a four-part television series for PBS in 2004. ''This is a rich, wide-ranging work,'' Neil Genzlinger wrote in the Book Review."
2006-06-11T00:00:00Z,"When they write the history of New York State politics, 2006 will undoubtedly be labeled a particularly strange year. This is the year that control over the state budget has moved solidly into the governor's office. The Legislature's role, steadily diminishing over the last few years, has been whittled down to that of official supplicant. Gov. George Pataki has essentially taken on the role of state parent, and New York's 212 legislators can do nothing more than whine, plead, denounce and delay."
2006-06-11T00:00:00Z,"SEASON OPENER The News -- The 2006 Congressional campaign season got under way early, with a special election for a House seat in San Diego. Behind the News -- Republicans held on to the seat, which was left vacant when Randy Cunningham resigned after pleading guilty in a corruption scandal. But the thin victory margin of the winner, Brian P. Bilbray, was a sign that the party may be in for difficult times in more competitive districts. Campaigns were already in full swing in some of those districts, long before the traditional Labor Day start of the election season. CYBER-RIVALRY The News -- Google unveiled a new online spreadsheet program, the latest volley in its attacks against its rival Microsoft. Behind the News -- The free program, Google Spreadsheets, is designed to allow multiple users to work on a spreadsheet simultaneously. But more important, perhaps, is that it can read files created in Microsoft's popular program Excel. So it's another step in Google's efforts to make inroads on Microsoft's core business, desktop programs. Microsoft has countered in recent years by expanding its Web offerings. BOOMTOWN The News -- Construction contractors for the Freedom Tower announced they would begin work on the foundation by blasting away bedrock. Behind the News -- While the thought of more explosions at the World Trade Center site might be chilling to residents and workers in Lower Manhattan, those in charge of the project said that the detonations, to be carried out over two months, would hardly be noticeable. Blasting, they added, would produce far less dust and din than the constant pounding of an alternative method, hydraulic rams attached to backhoes. M-M-MEMORIES The News -- Barbra Streisand announced she would perform in 20 cities this fall, her first concert tour in a dozen years. Behind the News -- Since Ms. Streisand, 64, never really retired, it's not a comeback tour. A more accurate description might be ''marathon fund-raising event.'' The singer, who has long used her concerts to raise money for political causes, said she would donate proceeds this time to educational, environmental and women's health groups. PLAYTIME The News -- The 32-team World Cup soccer tournament got under way in Germany with the opening match in Munich. Behind the News -- Concerns about how the monthlong event might be affected by racist fans, bribable referees, an influx of prostitutes and even the shape of the ball dominated much of the discussion in the weeks leading up to it. Most of the worries melted away as play began, although German and English fans had to be separated by police officers in Frankfut. In the opener, Germany defeated Costa Rica, 4-2."
2006-06-11T00:00:00Z,"President Bush's two-day strategy session starting Monday at Camp David is intended to revive highly tangible efforts to shore up Iraq's new government, from getting the electricity back on in Baghdad to purging the security forces of revenge-seeking militias, White House officials said. Three years of efforts to accomplish those goals have largely failed. Billions of dollars have been spent on both electricity and security, yet residents of Baghdad get only five to eight hours of power a day, and the American ambassador acknowledged on Friday that the city is ''more insecure now than it was a few months ago.''"
2006-06-11T00:00:00Z,"INTERNATIONAL 3-20 Taliban Surges in Afghanistan A large springtime offensive by the Taliban has turned into their strongest show of force since American forces chased them from power in late 2001, and Afghan and foreign officials and local villagers blamed a scarcity of United States-led coalition forces for the resurgence. 1 Hamas Rockets Hit Israel Hamas fired at least 15 Qassam rockets from Gaza into Israel, ending a 16-month truce with Israel, a day after eight Palestinians, including four children, were killed on a Gaza beach, apparently by an errant Israeli shell. 8 Iran to Present Counteroffer Iran's foreign minister said that the government would issue a counteroffer to an proposal by Europe, China and the United States to get Iran give up enriching uranium in the short term. 26 Iraq Delays Decision on Troops The new government of Iraq has decided to postpone any demand for negotiations to establish a more formal legal basis for the presence of American and other foreign troops on its soil, Iraqi and American officials said. 20 Concern Over China's Coal Use China uses more coal than the United States, the European Union and Japan combined, and the increase in global-warming gases from China's coal use will probably exceed that for all industrialized countries combined over the next 25 years, surpassing by five times the reduction in such emissions that the Kyoto Protocol seeks. 1 Progress in Hariri Inquiry The head of the United Nations inquiry into the assassination of Rafik Hariri, the former Lebanese prime minister, said he was making ''considerable progress'' and had established the case was probably a suicide bombing, but he revealed nothing new about who was behind the killing. 27 Zarqawi Planned Expansion At the time of his death, Abu Musab al-Zarqawi was still trying to transform his organization into a global operation capable of striking far beyond Iraq's borders, recruiting terrorists both in Iraq and abroad, intelligence experts agree. 1 Venezuela Forges New Force President Hugo Chávez is attempting to create Latin America's largest civilian reserve force as part of Venezuela's rising military profile, in preparation for what Mr. Chavez insists is the threat of invasion by the United States. 3 NATIONAL 28-37 Suicides at Guantánamo Three detainees being held at the United States military prison at Guantánamo Bay, Cuba, apparently committed suicide, the first deaths of detainees to be reported at the military prison since it opened in early 2002, American military officials said. 1 Medicare Problems Continue Bush administration officials say Medicare's new prescription drug program is humming along smoothly, but many patients still say they have difficulty getting the drugs they need. 32 Democrats Courting Bloggers If there is an emerging consensus among much of the Democratic Party establishment, it is that blogs are an important emerging power in American politics. What is less clear is how mainstream politicians grapple with an audience that has defined itself in part by its dissatisfaction with mainstream politicians. 37 Recruiters Look to MySpace Many companies that recruit on college campuses have been using search engines to conduct background checks on seniors looking for their first job. But now, college career counselors and other experts say, some recruiters are also looking up applicants on social networking sites like Facebook and MySpace. 1 OBITUARIES 45 Charles F.

2006-06-12T00:00:00Z,"Jones Is On When It Counts THE WORLD'S BEST golfer was Bobby Jones, a 27-year-old amateur (and lawyer) from Atlanta. The next year, he won the Grand Slam of that day: United States Open, United States Amateur, British Open and British Amateur. This time at Winged Foot, he was erratic one day, sensational the next. In the final round, he led by six strokes with six holes to play, then crumbled until his curling 12-foot putt on the 72nd hole gave him a 79 and a first-place tie with Al Espinosa, at 294. The next day, in a 36-hole playoff, Jones shot 72-69 and won by 23 strokes. As the leading pro, Espinosa won $1,000. Jones, an amateur, left with only a trophy. Casper by a Stroke FOR THE FIRST TIME in the tournament's history, the final round was postponed a day. In the cold and wind of the last day, many had an opportunity to win. Ben Hogan, seeking his fifth Open title, needed only a par 70, but his putter betrayed him and he shot a 76. He tied for eighth place with Sam Snead, who had a 75. Mike Souchak, who knew the Winged Foot course well because he was once an assistant pro there, left his chip shot short on the 72nd hole. Bob Rosburg recorded sensational birdies, holing a 50-foot explosion from a trap on the 11th hole and a 50-foot putt on the 12th. He needed a 30-foot putt on the 18th and missed. Billy Casper, 27, finished at 282 and won by a stroke over Rosburg. Casper played 72 holes with few gambles and near-faultless putting (114 putts over 72 holes). Hale Irwin's Magic 2-Iron IT WAS HALE IRWIN against the legends, and the legends lost. In the first round, Jack Nicklaus's 25-foot birdie putt on the first hole caught the ridge and ended up 28 feet from the hole. Johnny Miller, the defending champion, had three consecutive bunker shots roll back to his feet on the par-3 seventh hole and took a 7. In the second round, Gary Player took a triple-bogey 7 on the fourth hole and a double-bogey 6 on the 14th, where his shanked bunker shot almost hit Arnold Palmer. Lee Trevino missed the cut. Tom Watson entered the final round leading by a stroke, only to finish with nine bogeys and a 79. Irwin, with six bogeys, struggled in the last round, too. But he managed to put a 2-iron on the 72nd green and twoputted to defeat Forrest Fezler by two strokes with a 287, seven over par. Fuzzy Zoeller and the White Towel TRAFFIC, PARKING and crowd-control problems were so bad that Jim Hand, the president of the United States Golf Association, said, ''This is an absolute zoo.'' The tournament ended in a wild way, too. On the 72nd hole, Greg Norman made a sliding 45-foot putt for par and tied Fuzzy Zoeller for the lead. Zoeller, standing in the fairway, thought Norman had made birdie for the lead and waved a white towel in mock surrender. Zoeller made par for 276, forcing an 18-hole playoff the next day. On the second hole of the playoff, Zoeller rolled in a 68-foot downhill putt, Norman three-putted from 18 feet, and a runaway began. Zoeller won with a 67 to Norman's 75. Walking to the final green, Norman, beaten but still with a sense of humor, waved his own white towel. FRANK LITSKY (NYT)"

But the network won this Sunday because of games of a different sort: the N.B.A. Finals. Nielsen's estimates for the live broadcast were preliminary, but its overnight ratings showed that ABC was ahead among total viewers and adults 18 to 49, and that this year's game No. 2 delivered a larger audience than last year's. CBS and its Tony Awards placed second among viewers, but fourth in the 18-to-49 demographic. Fox, in turn, was No. 2 among 18-to-49 year-olds, and fourth among viewers. Its most-watched show of the night was a rerun of ''Family Guy'' at 9 p.m., with 5.93 million viewers.

2006-06-13T00:00:00Z,"An international group of scientists is building a new kind of telescope at the bottom of the Mediterranean Sea, near the coast of France. To be completed in 2007, it will detect light generated by neutrinos, the high-energy cosmic particles that pass directly through the Earth. Because neutrinos pass through most matter (including the seafloor), scientists can use them to peer into active galactic nuclei. Why underwater? To help shield the telescope from cosmic radiation coming from above. FRANK O'CONNELL AN UNDERWATER ARRAY Twelve vertical lines, each made up of 75 optical modules. Diagram (schematic, not to scale) highlights the following: 3 OPTICAL MODULES SEA FLOOR ANCHOR BUOY LIGHT FROM SOURCE TO DETECTION 1. Some neutrinos are thought to be created and ejected into space from black holes. 2. Neutrinos encountering the Earth pass right through, emerging on the other side. 3. Interacting with the Earth's crust or the water of the ocean, the neutrinos produce muons. 4. As they rise up from the ocean floor, the muons emit a faint bluish light, called Cherenkov light. 5. Photo detectors sense this light and relay the data to shore. PARTICLE TRAJECTORY As the muons pass through the telescope, individual sensors pick up the emitted light. Tracing the path backward through the array, scientists can determine the particles' trajectory. OPTICAL MODULES Pressure-resistant glass spheres encase photo sensors. The modules are angled down 45 degrees to better detect the muons as they move upward. (Diagram) Antares observes space by looking down through the Earth rather than up through the atmosphere.

The difference lies in the layers of cells at the back of the eyeball, where the flash of light strikes. When people are photographed in dim light, their pupils are wide open to let in enough light to see. As the flash hits the retina, which is richly supplied with blood vessels that are close to the surface, a red reflection may result."

2006-06-14T00:00:00Z,"ANA SORTUN, the chef at Oleana restaurant in Cambridge, Mass., finished culinary school in Paris in 1988. But the education of her palate wasn't complete, she said, until she apprenticed herself to the Tunisian chef Moncef Meddeb in Boston, then began traveling to Turkey and Greece in the 1990's. In those countries she first encountered the seasonings that are used liberally by cooks in the Eastern Mediterranean, but sparingly in the European repertory she'd been schooled in: many kinds of chilies; dried herbs like mint and thyme; warm spices like turmeric, cumin, and cinnamon; sesame and poppy seeds; intensely sweet-tart pomegranate molasses."

The girl died after being caught in cross-fire outside a downtown mall, and the audacity of the gunfight -- in broad daylight on Canada's busiest shopping day of the year -- shocked the city, which had already experienced a rash of gang shootings. The killing had an influence on the national election the next month that was won by the Conservatives, whose leader, Stephen Harper, blamed the policies of the Liberal government of Prime Minister Paul Martin for an increase in violence.

2006-06-14T00:00:00Z,"The finest chocolate, as we know it, dates from 1879. That was when Rudolph Lindt, a Swiss chocolatier, invented the conching machine, which made it easier to knead a mass of warm chocolate to a satin-smooth texture. The longer the chocolate is conched, the finer the texture. Chocolate that is worked by hand will never achieve that finesse. But a bite of a bar of Don Puglisi chocolate proves that there is merit in old-fashioned chocolate that is dull, not shiny, and has a pleasingly crunchy texture. This artisanal chocolate from Modica, a baroque hill town in southeast Sicily, is made from the finest criollo beans and is worked without heating, on a machine that is similar to a metate, a Mexican-style mortar, so that the sugar crystals retain their integrity."

2006-06-14T00:00:00Z,"Five years ago, if you were searching the globe for the next international party hot spot, you might easily have overlooked the island of Hvar, off Croatia's Dalmatian coast. The wars that engulfed the region following the breakup of Yugoslavia in 1991 had only just ended, and Hvar itself was nothing but a hilly rock in the unpolluted Adriatic Sea, dotted with picturesque villages and cursed with fresh seafood, near-eternal sunshine and a currency cheapened by years of conflict. In other words, Hvar was ripe for a comeback, as was the entire country. In the not-so-amazing race by travel insiders to find the new ""it"" spot, Croatia has been billed as ""the next Italy."" And for frugal travelers everywhere, ""emerging"" and ""undiscovered"" are not only code words for tourist-free and unspoiled but often synonymous with affordable."

Mr. Brachman is an experienced chef, but his friendly book, which might be just right for a Father's Day gift, assumes little familiarity with the kitchen. It covers tools, shopping, shortcuts and, perhaps best of all, how kids can be enlisted to help out at mealtime. The recipes are basic: pasta primavera, for example, pot roast, even popcorn. The blueberry muffin recipe is excellent. The esthetics of Japanese food, so evident on the plate, start with often hand-crafted kitchen implements. Cooks everywhere have discovered the santoku knife, but in ''Cool Tools: Cooking Utensils from the Japanese Kitchen'' (Kodansha International, $28), Kate Klippensteen discusses many more utensils, like slender chopsticks used in cooking, ceramic pots, special graters and graceful bamboo colanders.

It built steadily from its first half-hour at 8 p.m. (5.5 million viewers) to its last at 9:30 p.m. (7.9 million). CBS's night of repeats placed first among viewers, and second in the 18-to-49 demographic. Its ''CSI: Miami'' rerun at 10 p.m. was the night's most-watched show, with 13.4 million viewers.

2006-06-14T00:00:00Z,"8 P.M. (CBS) AFI's 100 YEARS . . . 100 CHEERS -- It's more than 100 years old, but who's counting? The folks at the American Film Institute, that's for sure, with this ninth annual countdown special. This time, it's 100 of the most inspiring films, as voted on by 1,500 industry types from a list of 300 (including ''Erin Brockovich,'' starring Julia Roberts, above). A load of stars -- including Jessica Alba, Angela Bassett, Don Cheadle, Danny DeVito, Kirk Douglas, Sally Field, Jane Fonda, Whoopi Goldberg, Ed Harris, Ron Howard, James Earl Jones, Ben Kingsley, William H. Macy and Steven Spielberg -- will do the listing honors. 8 P.M. (Fox) SO YOU THINK YOU CAN DANCE -- Viewers, turn on your cellphones! The Top 20 finalists try to remember that it takes two to tango, krump, paso doble and salsa as they dance as couples before the phone lines are opened to voters for the first time this season. 8 P.M. (13) BILL IRWIN: CLOWN PRINCE -- Robin Williams calls him ''Fred Astaire on mojitos,'' which is a pretty apt description for someone whose pliable physicality put the limp in Noodle (as in Mr., his ''Sesame Street'' character). This 2004 ''Great Performances'' special traverses 25 years in the life of Mr. Irwin -- actor, playwright, director, choreographer, clown and national treasure -- as he sets about proving that sometimes a simple gesture is just as effective in getting your point across as a script's worth of words. 9 P.M. (13, 49) COLE PORTER: YOU'RE THE TOP -- His marriage was a mostly happy sham, and some of his bestknown love songs were inspired by men. Still, no one could craft a lighthearted ode to human emotion better than Porter (above), whose life, as shown in this 1990 ''American Masters'' special, was as complicated as they come. Bobby Short, the definitive Porter interpreter, narrates. 9 P.M. (Sci Fi) COUNTDOWN TO DOOMSDAY -- Has the state of the world got you down? This special, with Matt Lauer as host, not only lists 10 potential scenarios under which earth's next mass extinction might occur, but also -- for the optimists out there -- 10 equally plausible approaches for averting disaster. 10 P.M. (ABC) COMMANDER IN CHIEF -- Talk about a lame duck. Mackenzie Allen (Geena Davis, right), the country's first female leader, says goodbye to the Oval Office, Air Force One and her other presidential perks in this series finale -- but not before trying to get the Equal Rights Amendment passed. 10:30 P.M.

Mixing it with other greens rarely makes sense, because it makes a mockery of most of them; teaming it with tame meat or fish is almost equally futile. That's all fine with me. Using arugula as the basis for a main-course salad gives you a reason to put together plenty of really strong flavors, all playing nicely off the others. Here I assemble salt cod, capers, a lot of parsley -- which has a definite affinity for arugula -- a sharp lemony dressing and, for bulk, contrast and texture, some cooked white beans."

Senator Hillary Rodham Clinton, Democrat of New York, faced boos and shouts of ''bring them home'' from an audience of liberal Democrats here on Tuesday as she argued against setting a deadline, wading into what she called a ''difficult conversation.''

2006-06-15T00:00:00Z,"AUGERI--Joseph. A legend in the cosmetics industry, Joe passed away peacefully on the morning of Sunday, June 11. Credited with turning Lancome into a household name, Joe was well respected not only for his business acumen, but also for his sociable disposition. The son of Italian immigrant parents, Joe grew up in Brooklyn with his sister, Anne. During World War II, Joe served in the Army. When the war drew to a close, Joe decided to attend Rollins College and graduated in 1953. Armed with a degree, it took Joe a mere one week to get a job at Revlon as a sales trainee, and over the course of the next 17 years Joe worked his way up to become Vice President of Sales. Later, Joe would join L'Oreal USA. Joe assumed control of a little known division named Lancome and, within 10 years, Joe turned Lancome into a well-known brand. On the heels of such a turnaround, L'Oreal was anxious to see what else Augeri could accomplish. By 1984, Joe had become a Senior Vice President, overseeing Lancome, Ralph Lauren, Biotherm, and Cosmair's European fragrance division. In his later years at L'Oreal he worked with the international divisions to further develop their business. For his enduring contributions to the industry, Augeri was presented with the coveted Beauty Fashion Medal of Honor Award in 1990. Having achieved a great deal of success in his career, Joe retired to Palm Beach, Florida in 1993. Joe married his longtime love, Ann Fox, on May 3, 1996. They were seldom without friends and family. Joe's joie de vivre warmed the hearts of those around him. With a mischievous glint in his eye, Joe lived and loved life to the fullest. He is survived by his wife Ann, sister Anne Detroyer, and many nieces and nephews. The funeral service for Joe will be held Friday at 12:30 PM the C.C. Van Emburgh Funeral Home, 306 East Ridgewood Avenue, Ridgewood, New Jersey. (www.vanemburgh.com).

She was born Nancy Helen Marie Leeds in New York City on February 24, 1925, the daughter of William Batemen Leeds, Jr. and Princess Xenia Georgievna of Russia. Through her mother, she was a member of the Romanov dynasty and direct descendent of Catherine the Great. Nancy's maternal grandfather, Grand Duke George Mikhailovitch, was shot by the Bolsheviks in St. Petersburg in the Russian Revolution. Nancy was proud and dutiful of this heritage, but relished also the roughand-tumble adventures of her American ancestors, who included the senior William B. Leeds, the Tin Plate King. She was raised on Long Island, where she attended the Green Vale School. She was a graduate of the Ethel Walker School in Simsbury, CT and Sarah Lawrence College. In December 1945 she married Edward Judson Wynkoop, Jr., of Syracuse, NY. The Wynkoops lived for 21 years in Darien, CT before moving to Woodstock in 1969, where Nancy belonged to the New Century Club and was president of the Vermont chapter of the Colonial Dames of America. She is survived by her husband, Edward J. Wynkoop of Woodstock, and their daughter, Alexandra, of South Burlington, Vermont. Most of the Wynkoop-Romanov collection, including rare objects of Faberge, was endowed to Middlebury College toward the end of Nancys life.

2006-06-15T00:00:00Z,"A day after scientists reduced the alert level for Mount Merapi, it erupted and spewed wide trails of lava and huge clouds of searing hot gas through the night. The gas clouds, which can exceed temperatures of 540 degrees Fahrenheit, traveled more than four miles from Merapi's peak, well past the closest villages. Lava edged to within 700 feet of Kaliadem, one of the closest villages to the thundering crater. Scientists reinstated the alert to its highest level in the afternoon, just before sirens began blaring across the mountain, setting off the instant evacuation of thousands of villagers in trucks and cars and on motorbikes. Many of them had just returned home after spending weeks in nearby refugee camps. But Mbah Marijan, a 79-year-old local spiritual leader who lives just below the lava dome and who makes offerings to appease the volcano, remained at home, where lava crept to within several hundred feet of his front door.

My mother spoke with her two brothers in Baghdad right after a friend called her with the news. A couple of days later, I called another uncle in Baghdad to congratulate him. He was happy, and said that people were celebrating even more than when Saddam was captured. The reason for that, explained Huda, a cousin's wife in Cleveland, was Zarqawi's overt appeals to Sunnis to kill Shias. My take on that is that through Zarqawi's open incitement to kill Shias and the bid for a civil war, Iraqis had to look their racism in the eye - and what they've seen, they haven't liked. The bearer of that message, had to be destroyed."

2006-06-16T00:00:00Z,"An article yesterday about President Bush's plan to designate a 1,200-mile-long chain of largely uninhabited small Hawaiian islands as a national monument referred incorrectly to Gov. Linda Lingle. She is the second Republican to be elected governor of Hawaii. (The first was William F. Quinn, in 1959.) The article also misspelled the given name of the executive director of the Western Pacific Fishery Management Council, which opposes a complete ban on fishing in the area. She is Kitty M. Simonds, not Kittie."

2006-06-16T00:00:00Z,"SUN--Alexander S., he was a beloved father and scientist who dedicated his life to saving the lives of others. Born in 1939 in Hunan, China, Alexander Shikuan Sun survived the invasion of China during WWII. Alexander completed his college education in Taiwan and moved to the U.S. to receive his Ph.D. at the University of California at Berkeley. With the mentorship of Nobel Laureate, Dr. Melvin Calvin, Alexander excelled in the field of photosynthesis and later as a postdoc under the guidance of Nobel Laureate Christian de Duv. Alexander was a pioneer in the study of aging for more than 15 years as a faculty member at Mount Sinai Hospital and continued his research at Yale University School of Medicine. When his mother was diagnosed with inoperable Stage IV lung cancer and given 6 months to live, Alexander invented his Selected Vegetable Herbal Soup that allowed his mother to live an additional 17 years. Through the advancement and development of his company, Sun Farm Corporation, Alexander has aided cancer patients around the world. His dream of achieving approval from the FDA for his product was almost realized before his passing. Today, his dream of fully developing the first nontoxic treatment for cancer continues. He is survived by his brother and sister, nephew, niece, wife, and two sons who are determined to sustain what they hope to be his enduring legacy. A funeral will be held at Frank E. Campbell Funeral Chapel at 1076 Madison Avenue at 81st Street at 1pm on Friday, June 16. There will be a Memorial Service at the Sun home at 500 Anderson Ave., Milford, CT at 1pm on Saturday, June 17th. Donations can be made to the American Heart Association."

2006-06-16T00:00:00Z,"A group of Brooklyn College graduate art students whose thesis exhibition was shut down last month have filed a federal suit against New York City, the Parks Department and the college, claiming that their free-speech rights were violated and that their work was damaged when it was removed. On May 4, a day after the exhibition opened, the Brooklyn parks commissioner, Julius Spiegel, ordered it closed and changed the locks on the exhibition space, a World War II memorial hall near the Brooklyn Bridge. He said that some of the artworks -- featuring, among other things, a live rat and a sculpture of a hand holding a penis -- were not appropriate for families, violating an oral agreement he said his department reached six years ago with Brooklyn College on the use of the space. The suit, filed in district court in Brooklyn by Norman Siegel, the former executive director of the New York Civil Liberties Union, asks the court to send ''a clear message'' that ''government is not the appropriate body to judge the value of art.'' After the closing, the students accepted an offer by the college to relocate the show at an empty retail space at 70 Washington Street in the Dumbo neighborhood of Brooklyn. That exhibition closes today. RANDY KENNEDY"

2006-06-16T00:00:00Z,"A two-hour ''So You Think You Can Dance,'' which featured the first performances by the competition's finalists, put Fox in the No. 1 slot on Wednesday night. In Nielsen's estimates, ''Dance'' drew 9.7 million viewers, and its viewership and demographic ratings built as the evening went on. So far, the show's ratings have increased significantly over its first season last summer. The CBS primetime special ''AFI: 100 Years, 100 Cheers'' (8.3 million) put the network in second place. NBC continued its broadcasts of hockey's Stanley Cup finals; though the ratings for the games were preliminary, they indicated an audience of fewer than 5 million. Speaking of small audiences, the once formidable ''Commander in Chief'' had its candle snuffed out on Wednesday.

Hudson Guild Theater, 441 West 26th Street, Chelsea, (212) 352-3101. Broadway * 'AWAKE AND SING!' (Tony Award, Best Play Revival 2006) Dreams and disappointments, hopes and fears, encouraging words and bitter putdowns clash by day and night in Clifford Odets's turbulent comedy-drama about a Jewish family struggling to stay afloat in the 1930's. A gifted roster of performers -- including Mark Ruffalo, Lauren Ambrose, Zoë Wanamaker and Ben Gazzara -- manage to locate the dreaming centers of their characters, buried beneath layers of political sloganeering, everyday gripes or street slang. And even when the focus occasionally blurs in Bartlett Sher's ultimately moving revival, Odets's zesty dialogue, in which jazzy period colloquialisms are slung around like punches at a prize fight, is a joy to hear (2:30). Belasco Theater, 111 West 44th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Charles Isherwood) * 'BRIDGE & TUNNEL' (Tony Award, Special Theatrical Event 2006) This delightful solo show, written and performed by Sarah Jones, is a sweet-spirited valentine to New York City, its polyglot citizens and the larger notion of an all-inclusive America. In 90 minutes of acutely observed portraiture gently tinted with humor, Ms. Jones plays more than a dozen men and women participating in an open-mike evening of poetry for immigrants (1:30). Helen Hayes Theater, 240 West 44th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Isherwood) 'THE COLOR PURPLE' So much plot, so many years, so many characters to cram into less than three hours. This beat-the-clock musical adaptation of Alice Walker's Pulitzer Prize-winning novel about Southern black women finding their inner warriors never slows down long enough for you to embrace it. LaChanze leads the vibrant, hard-working cast (2:40). Broadway Theater, 1681 Broadway, at 53rd Street, (212) 239-6200.(Ben Brantley) 'DIRTY ROTTEN SCOUNDRELS' The arrival of Jonathan Pryce and his eloquent eyebrows automatically makes this the season's most improved musical. With Mr. Pryce (who replaces the admirable but uneasy John Lithgow) playing the silken swindler to Norbert Leo Butz's vulgar grifter, it's as if a mismatched entry in a three-legged race had become an Olympic figure-skating pair (2:35). Imperial Theater, 249 West 45th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley) 'THE DROWSY CHAPERONE' (Tony Awards, Best Book of a Musical and Best Original Score 2006) This small and ingratiating spoof of 1920's stage frolics, as imagined by an obsessive show queen, may not be a masterpiece. But in a dry season for musicals, ''The Drowsy Chaperone'' has theatergoers responding as if they were withering house plants, finally being watered after long neglect. Bob Martin and Sutton Foster are the standouts in the eager, energetic cast (1:40). Marquis Theater, 1535 Broadway, at 45th Street, (212) 307-4100. (Brantley) *'FAITH HEALER' In the title role of Brian Friel's great play, Ralph Fiennes paints a portrait of the artist as dreamer and destroyer that feels both as old as folklore and so fresh that it might be painted in wet blood. Also starring Cherry Jones and the superb Ian McDiarmid, this mesmerizing series of monologues has been directed with poetic starkness by Jonathan Kent (2:35). Booth Theater, 222 West 45th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley) * 'THE HISTORY BOYS' (Tony Awards, Best Play and Best Direction of a Play, 2006) Madly enjoyable. Alan Bennett's play about a battle for the hearts and minds of a group of university-bound students, imported with the original British cast from the National Theater, moves with a breezy narrative swagger that transcends cultural barriers. Directed by Nicholas Hytner, with a perfectly oiled ensemble led by the superb Richard Griffiths and Stephen Campbell Moore as schoolmasters with opposing views of history and education (2:40). Broadhurst Theater, 235 West 44th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley) 'HOT FEET' A dancing encyclopedia of clichés set to the music of Earth, Wind and Fire. Numbing (2:30). Hilton Theater, 213 West 42nd Street, (212) 307-4100. (Isherwood) 'JERSEY BOYS' (Tony Award, Best Musical 2006) From grit to glamour with the Four Seasons, directed by the pop repackager Des McAnuff (''The Who's Tommy''). The real thrill of this shrink-wrapped bio-musical, for those who want something more than recycled chart toppers and a story line poured from a can, is watching the wonderful John Lloyd Young (as Frankie Valli) cross the line from exact impersonation into something far more compelling (2:30). August Wilson Theater, 245 West 52nd Street, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley) * 'THE LIEUTENANT OF INISHMORE' Please turn off your political correctness monitor along with your cellphone for Martin McDonagh's gleeful, gory and appallingly entertaining play. This blood farce about terrorism in rural Ireland, acutely directed by Wilson Milam, has a carnage factor to rival Quentin Tarantino's. But it is also wildly, absurdly funny and, even more improbably, severely moral (1:45). Lyceum Theater, 149 West 45th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley) 'THE LIGHT IN THE PIAZZA' Love is a many flavored thing, from sugary to sour, in Adam Guettel and Craig Lucas's encouragingly ambitious and discouragingly unfulfilled new musical. The show soars only in the sweetly bitter songs performed by the wonderful Victoria Clark, as an American abroad (2:15). Beaumont Theater, Lincoln Center, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley) *'SHINING CITY' Quiet, haunting and absolutely glorious. Conor McPherson's impeccably assembled ghost story about being alone in the crowded city of Dublin has been brought to American shores with a first-rate cast (Brian F. O'Byrne, Oliver Platt, Martha Plimpton and Peter Scanavino), directed by Robert Falls (1:45). Biltmore Theater, 261 West 47th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley) * 'SWEENEY TODD' (Tony Award, Best Direction of a Musical 2006) Sweet dreams, New York. This thrilling new revival of Stephen Sondheim and Hugh Wheeler's musical, with Michael Cerveris and Patti LuPone leading a cast of 10 who double as their own musicians, burrows into your thoughts like a campfire storyteller who knows what really scares you. The inventive director John Doyle aims his pared-down interpretation at the squirming child in everyone who wants to have his worst fears both confirmed and dispelled (2:30). Eugene O'Neill Theater, 230 West 49th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley) 'TARZAN' This writhing green blob with music, adapted by Disney Theatrical Productions from the 1999 animated film, has the feeling of a super-deluxe day care center, equipped with lots of bungee cords and karaoke synthesizers, where children can swing when they get tired of singing, and vice versa. The soda-pop score is by Phil Collins (2:30). Richard Rodgers Theater, 226 West 46th Street, (212) 307-4747. (Brantley) 'THE THREEPENNY OPERA' Presented as a long, pansexual orgy, Scott Elliot's numbing revival of the Brecht-Weill classic feels like a party where the hangover begins almost as soon as the evening does. The starry cast includes Alan Cumming (as Mac the Knife) and a Dietrich-like Cyndi Lauper, though only Jim Dale and Nellie McKay appear to have a clue as to what the show is about (2:40). Studio 54, 254 West 54th Street, (212) 719-1300. (Brantley) * 'THE 25TH ANNUAL PUTNAM COUNTY SPELLING BEE' The happy news for this happy-making little musical is that the move to larger quarters has dissipated none of its quirky charm. William Finn's score sounds plumper and more rewarding than it did Off Broadway, providing a sprinkling of sugar to complement the sass in Rachel Sheinkin's zinger-filled book. The performances are flawless. Gold stars all around (1:45). Circle in the Square, 1633 Broadway, at 50th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Isherwood) 'THE WEDDING SINGER' An assembly-kit musical that might as well be called ''That 80's Show,'' this stage version of the 1998 film is all winks and nods and quotations from the era of big hair and junk bonds. The cast members, who include Stephen Lynch and Laura Benanti, are personable enough, which is not the same as saying they have personalities (2:20). Al Hirschfeld Theater, 302 West 45th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley) Off Broadway 'ASSISTED LOVING' This warm and witty monologue by Bob Morris, who contributes the Age of Dissonance column to the Sunday Styles section of The New York Times, is performed by the author, who chronicles his widowed father's and his own search for love in and around New York. Engaging, subtle and winning (1:10). Daryl Roth Theater, D-Lounge, 103 East 15th Street, at Union Square, (212) 239-6200. (George Hunka) 'BURLEIGH GRIME$' A feeble-witted comedy by Roger Kirby about dirty dealings on Wall Street, featuring a pair of skilled actors known for recent television work -- Wendie Malick of ''Just Shoot Me'' and Mark Moses of ''Desperate Housewives'' -- and incidental music by David Yazbek, who wrote the score for Broadway's ''Dirty Rotten Scoundrels.'' These putative assets are painfully ill served by Mr. Kirby's play, which is long on ludicrous plot and short on fresh humor. (2:10). New World Stages, 340 West 50th Street, Clinton, (212) 239-6200. (Isherwood) 'CAGE LOVE' The new thriller by Christopher Denham -- star of ''Red Light Winter'' -- is a compulsively watchable, sometimes ridiculous drama about a man who becomes increasingly suspicious of his wife-to-be (1:30). Rattlestick Theater, 224 Waverly Place, Greenwich Village, (212) 868-4444. (Jason Zinoman) 'CIRQUE DU SOLEIL -- CORTEO' The Cirque du Soleil's latest extravaganza, which upholds the ubiquitous Cirque standard, is a fantasy of a dead (though cheerful) clown imagining his own funeral. Unsurprisingly, his cortege is full of circus acts (2:30). Grand Chapiteau at Randall's Island, (800) 678-5440. (John Rockwell) 'CRAZY FOR THE DOG' Christopher Boal's effective family melodrama about a brother, a sister, a wife and a boyfriend caught in a web of recrimination and confession, touched off by the kidnapping of a shih tzu (2:00). Bouwerie Lane Theater, 330 Bowery, at Bond Street, East Village, (212) 677-0060, Ext. 16. (Hunka) 'THE FIELD' John B. Keane's portrait of rural life in Ireland in the mid-20th century, both sorrowful and censorious. This sturdy new production, directed by Ciaran O'Reilly, features Marty Maguire as Bull McCabe, a tough farmer who will stop at nothing to preserve his right to raise his cattle on a field about to be auctioned. A little moralistic, but powerful nonetheless (2:30). Irish Repertory Theater, 132 West 22nd Street, Chelsea, (212) 727-2737. (Isherwood) * 'FORBIDDEN BROADWAY: SPECIAL VICTIMS UNIT' This production features the expected caricatures of ego-driven singing stars. But even more than usual, the show offers an acute list of grievances about the sickly state of the Broadway musical, where, as the lyrics have it, ''everything old is old again'' (1:45). 47th Street Theater, 304 West 47th Street, Clinton, (212) 239-6200.(Brantley) 'THE GOLD STANDARD' A successful alumnus, his trophy girlfriend and an eccentric Korean professor form a romantic triangle at a campus bar in Daniel Roberts's drama, which is occasionally original but often downright odd (2:30). The Irish Arts Center, 553 West 51st Street, Clinton, (212) 868-4444. (Anita Gates) 'IN THE MATTER OF J. ROBERT OPPENHEIMER' In the title role, Thomas Jay Ryan makes morality, in its truest sense, look fashionable. This is a long but frequently gripping play of literate talk and real ideas (2:45). The Connelly Theater, 220 East Fourth Street, Lower East Side, (212) 868-4444. (Gates) 'JACQUES BREL IS ALIVE AND WELL AND LIVING IN PARIS' A powerfully sung revival of the 1968 revue, presented with affectionate nostalgia by the director Gordon Greenberg. As in the original, two men (Robert Cuccioli and Rodney Hicks) and two women (Natascia Diaz and Gay Marshall) perform a wide selection of Brel's plaintive ballads and stirring anthems. Ms. Marshall's captivating performance of ''Ne Me Quitte Pas,'' sung in the original French and with heart-stirring transparency, represents Brel at his best (2:00). Zipper Theater, 336 West 37th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Isherwood) 'NOT A GENUINE BLACK MAN' Brian Copeland's solo memoir about his African-American family moving into a white suburb in the early 1970's is an engaging, if stiltedly performed, show (1:30). DR2 Theater, 103 East 15th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Zinoman) 'NOTHING' A morsel of catnip for Anglophiles, flavorfully adapted by Andrea Hart from the novel by Henry Green. Simon Dutton and Sophie Ward play onetime lovers contemplating the possible marriage of their children in this comedy of manners about the string of upheavals that a romance in one generation causes in another (1:40). The 59E59 Theaters, 59 East 59th Street, (212) 279-4200. (Isherwood) 'THE PORCH' Kari Floren, who wrote this comedy about three unwanted guests at a failing B & B, takes a battering-ram approach to forcing her figures into her plot: there's a lot of noise and messiness along the way. But after establishing her four stereotypes (the abrasive and lonely career woman, the failed alcoholic writer, the gay dancer and the confused ex-dancer with commitment issues, who all declaim in loud, loud voices), she pulls off a surprise ending that manages to confer considerably more credibility on the enterprise (1:30). Altered Stages, 212 West 29th Street, Chelsea, second floor, (212) 279-4200. (Anne Midgette) 'RED LIGHT WINTER' A frank, occasionally graphic story of erotic fixation and the havoc it can wreak on sensitive types. Written and directed by Adam Rapp, this play is both a doomy romantic drama and a morbid comedy about the anxieties of male friendship. Although somewhat contrived, it features a lovely performance by Christopher Denham as a lonely soul starved for intimacy (2:25). Barrow Street Theater, 27 Barrow Street, West Village, (212) 239-6200. (Isherwood) 'SANDRA BERNHARD: EVERYTHING BAD AND BEAUTIFUL' Sandra Bernhard was a proverbial rock star long before headline-making folks in even the most prosaic walks of life were being referred to as such. Her new show, a collection of songs interspersed with musings on her life and on public figures ranging from Britney Spears to Condoleezza Rice, is casual to the point of being offhand. That said, it's invigorating to be in the presence of a true original (2:00). Daryl Roth Theater, 101 East 15th Street, at Union Square, (212) 239-6200. (Isherwood) 'SOME GIRL(S)' A slight and sour comedy from Neil LaBute that once again puts a morally bankrupt man under the microscope and watches him squirm. The central specimen is here played by Eric McCormack, who as a thoughtless heterosexual gives much the same performance he did as a thoughtful homosexual on ''Will and Grace.'' Jo Bonney directs a cast that also includes Fran Drescher, Judy Reyes, Brooke Smith and Maura Tierney as women done wrong by the same man (1:40). Lucille Lortel Theater, 121 Christopher Street, West Village, (212) 279-4200. (Brantley) 'STOPPING TRAFFIC' The actress Mary Pat Gleason's endearing one-woman show about making movies (and just getting through life) while bipolar is a play with both a message and some hearty laughs (1:30). Vineyard Theater, 108 East 15th Street, (212) 353-0303. (Gates) * 'STUFF HAPPENS' Daniel Sullivan's sharp, invigorating production of David Hare's journalistic drama about the road to war in Iraq is conducted on the modest scale of a town-hall meeting. The characters (who have names like Bush and Blair) seem less like destiny-shaping gods than the ego trippers in your office. If that means they're too close for comfort, then ''Stuff Happens'' is doing its job (2:50). The Public Theater, 425 Lafayette Street, at Astor Place, East Village, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley) 'TEMPEST TOSSED FOOLS' This musical audience-participation children's version of ''The Tempest'' is rowdy, colorful and not all that Shakespearean. Manhattan Ensemble Theater, 55 Mercer Street, SoHo, (212) 239-6200. (Gates) Off Off Broadway 'BACK OF THE THROAT' An Arab-American playwright, Yussef El Guindi, addressing the harassment of Arab-Americans after Sept. 11? Interesting. But the play would have been even more interesting if the harassers were something other than cardboard characters out of the J. Edgar Hoover closet (1:15). Flea Theater, 41 White Street, TriBeCa, (212) 352-3101. (Neil Genzlinger) 'HAM LAKE' A gregarious 20-something man reveals more than he intends to in this 80-minute seriocomic barroom monologue by Sam Rosen and Nat Bennett. Mr. Rosen is a wry and skilled earbender. Huron Club at the SoHo Playhouse, 15 Vandam Street, South Village, (212) 691-1555. (Hunka) * 'WAITING FOR GODOT' Vladimir (Wendell Pierce) and Estragon (J. Kyle Manzay) wait and wait, but in this version they're soaking wet, their desolate plot being surrounded by water. A familiar play is injected with surprises (2:00). Harlem School for the Arts, 645 St. Nicholas Avenue, near 141st Street, Hamilton Heights, (212) 864-4444. (Genzlinger) Long-Running Shows * 'ALTAR BOYZ' This sweetly satirical show about a Christian pop group made up of five potential Teen People cover boys is an enjoyable, silly diversion (1:30). New World Stages, 340 West 50th Street, Clinton, (212) 239-6200.(Isherwood) 'AVENUE Q' R-rated puppets give lively life lessons (2:10). Golden, 252 West 45th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley) 'BEAUTY AND THE BEAST' Cartoon made flesh, sort of (2:30). Lunt-Fontanne Theater, 205 West 46th Street, (212) 307-4747. (Brantley) 'CHICAGO' Irrefutable proof that crime pays (2:25). Ambassador Theater, 219 West 49th Street, (212) 239-6200.(Brantley) 'DOUBT, A PARABLE' John Patrick Shanley makes subversive use of musty conventions in the clash between the head of a parochial school and the young priest who may or may not be too fond of the boys in his charge (1:30). Walter Kerr Theater, 219 West 48th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley) 'HAIRSPRAY' Fizzy pop, cute kids, large man in a housedress (2:30). Neil Simon Theater, 250 West 52nd Street, (212) 307-4100. (Brantley) 'THE LION KING' Disney on safari, where the big bucks roam (2:45). Minskoff Theater, 200 West 45th Street at Broadway, (212) 307-4100. (Brantley) 'MAMMA MIA!' The jukebox that devoured Broadway (2:20). Cadillac Winter Garden Theater, 1634 Broadway, at 50th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley) 'THE PHANTOM OF THE OPERA' Who was that masked man, anyway? (2:30). Majestic Theater, 247 West 44th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley) 'THE PRODUCERS' The ne plus ultra of showbiz scams (2:45). St. James Theater, 246 West 44th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley) 'RENT' East Village angst and love songs to die for (2:45). Nederlander Theater, 208 West 41st Street, (212) 307-4100. (Brantley) 'SLAVA'S SNOWSHOW' Clowns chosen by the Russian master Slava Polunin are stirring up laughter and enjoyment. A show that touches the heart as well as tickles the funny bone (1:30). Union Square Theater, 100 East 17th Street, Flatiron District, (212) 307-4100.(Lawrence Van Gelder) 'SPAMALOT' This staged re-creation of the mock-medieval movie ''Monty Python and the Holy Grail'' is basically a singing scrapbook for Python fans. Such a good time is being had by so many people that this fitful, eager celebration of inanity and irreverence has found a large and lucrative audience (2:20). Shubert Theater, 225 West 44th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley) 'WICKED' Oz revisited, with political corrections (2:45). Gershwin Theater, 222 West 51st Street, (212) 307-4100. (Brantley) Last Chance 'AIN'T SUPPOSED TO DIE A NATURAL DEATH' Melvin Van Peebles's 1971 Tony-nominated musical, ''Ain't Supposed to Die a Natural Death,'' isn't so much performed at the club T New York, as erupted, like some sort of streetwise lava flow. This early precursor to hip-hop, rap and poetry slams is a get-down, roiling depiction of ghetto life, and we're not talking urbane bling (1:30). T New York, 240 West 52nd Street, Clinton, (212) 352-3101; closing tomorrow. (Phoebe Hoban) * 'BILLY CONNOLLY LIVE!' This popular comedian will remind you of a Scottish George Carlin, with a bit of Eddie Izzard mixed in (2:00). 37 Arts, 450 West 37th Street, (212) 307-4100; closing tomorrow. (Zinoman) 'DARK YELLOW' Elias Koteas and Tina Benko star in this compelling one-act psychological thriller about a one-night stand that involves one shocking revelation after another (1:35). Studio Dante, 257 West 29th Street, Chelsea, (212) 868-4444; closing tomorrow. (Gates) 'IN BETWEEN THE SHEETS' Based on three short stories by Ian McEwan, this trilogy is billed as the first-ever theatrical adaptation of the author's works. But the writer-director, Seth Duerr, doesn't provide a strong enough hand to replace the author's voice that's lost in the move from page to stage (1:30). Theater 54 in the Shetler Studios, 244 West 54th Street, 12th floor, Clinton, (212) 868-4444; closing tomorrow. (Midgette) * 'THE PAJAMA GAME' (Tony Award, Best Musical Revival 2006) Sexual chemistry in a Broadway musical? Isn't that illegal now? If it were, then Harry Connick Jr. and Kelli O'Hara -- the white-hot stars of Kathleen Marshall's delicious revival of this 1954 musical -- would be looking at long jail terms. This intoxicating production, which features a charming supporting cast led by Michael McKean, allows grown-up audiences the rare chance to witness a bona fide adult love affair translated into hummable songs and sprightly dance (2:30). American Airlines Theater, 227 West 42nd Street, (212) 719-1300; closing tomorrow. (Brantley) 'THREE DAYS OF RAIN' In this revival of Richard Greenberg's slender, elegant drama of family disconnectedness, Julia Roberts is stiff with self-consciousness, glancingly acquainted with the two characters she plays and deeply, disturbingly beautiful. Otherwise, it is almost impossible to discern the virtues of the play itself in this wooden and splintered production, directed by Joe Mantello and also starring Paul Rudd and Bradley Cooper, who have little chance of capturing the audience's attention (2:30). Bernard B. Jacobs Theater, 242 West 45th Street, (212) 239-6200; closing on Sunday. (Brantley) 'NO CHILD' Teachers will love Nilaja Sun's one-woman show about the challenges of teaching drama at Malcolm X High School (1:10). Beckett Theater at Theater Row, 410 West 42nd Street, Clinton, (212) 279-4200; closing on Sunday. (Gates) Movies Ratings and running times are in parentheses; foreign films have English subtitles. Full reviews of all current releases, movie trailers, show times and tickets: nytimes.com/movies. * 'AN INCONVENIENT TRUTH' (PG, 96 minutes) Al Gore gives a lecture on climate change. One of the most exciting and necessary movies of the year. Seriously. (A. O. Scott) * 'ARMY OF SHADOWS' (No rating, 140 minutes, in French) Dark as pitch and without compromise, Jean-Pierre Melville's 1969 masterpiece centers on the feats of a small band of Resistance fighters during the occupation. Brilliant, harrowing, essential viewing.(Manohla Dargis) 'ART SCHOOL CONFIDENTIAL' (R, 102 minutes) A lump of misanthropy from Terry Zwigoff and Daniel Clowes, who made the sublime ''Ghost World.'' This time they plod through a grouchy attack on the pretense and hypocrisy of self-declared artists. John Malkovich's performance as a drawing instructor is sly and insightful, a glimpse at what the movie might have been. (Scott) 'THE BREAK-UP' (PG-13, 105 minutes) Jennifer Aniston and Vince Vaughn split up and share custody of a Chicago condominium. Dull and cheerless, notwithstanding a handful of funny supporting turns, notably from Judy Davis and Jason Bateman. (Scott) 'CARS' (G, 114 minutes) The latest 3D toon from Pixar just putt, putt, putts along, a shining model of technological progress and consumer safety. John Lasseter directed, and Owen Wilson provides the voice of the little red race car who learns all the right lessons from, among others, a 1951 Hudson Hornet given voice by Paul Newman. (Dargis) * 'CROSSING THE BRIDGE: THE SOUND OF ISTANBUL' (No rating, 91 minutes, in German, Turkish and English) If life were fair and film exhibition better, you could watch Fatih Akin's infectiously enjoyable survey of contemporary Turkish music while standing up, or, more ideally, while swaying, spinning and shimmying. But whether you sit or spin, remember to tell the projectionist to crank up the volume. (Dargis) 'THE CULT OF THE SUICIDE BOMBER' (No rating, 96 minutes) An engrossing if intellectually thin made-for-British-television documentary that purports to explain how suicide bombing -- which its narrator, Robert Baer, likens to a ''pathological virus'' -- evolved from a weapon of war into a weapon of terror and finally, in Iraq, a ''weapon of chaos.'' (Dargis) 'THE DA VINCI CODE' (PG-13, 148 minutes) Theology aside, ''The Da Vinci Code'' is, above all, a murder mystery. And as such, once it gets going, Ron Howard's movie has its pleasures. He and the screenwriter Akiva Goldsman have deftly rearranged some elements of the plot, unkinking a few overelaborate twists and introducing others that keep the action moving along. The movie does, however, take a while to accelerate, popping the clutch and leaving rubber on the road as it tries to establish who is who, what he's doing and why. So I certainly can't support any calls for boycotting or protesting this busy, trivial, inoffensive film. Which is not to say that I'm recommending that you go see it. (Scott) * 'DOWN IN THE VALLEY' (R, 114 minutes) This allegorical neo-western set in the San Fernando Valley has dreams as big as the fantasies that consume its protagonist, a Stetson-wearing suburban cowboy (Edward Norton) who is not what he appears to be. How much you like it will depend on your appetite for the kind of cultural metaphors that David Jacobson flings onto the screen with a reckless abandon. (Stephen Holden) 'THE HEART OF THE GAME' (PG-13, 98 minutes) A documentary look from the newcomer Ward Serrill at the hoop dreams of both a girls' high school basketball team and of the tough-talking, softhearted coach who guides them to their championship season. (Dargis) 'THE KING' (R, 105 minutes) James Marsh uses clichés and some lived-in emotions and atmosphere for his fitfully engaging, exasperating film about a young Mexican-American (Gael García Bernal) whose search for his patrimony leads him into the bosom of a deeply religious Texas family (headed by a very fine William Hurt). (Dargis) * 'LA MOUSTACHE' (No rating, 86 minutes, in French) Emmanuel Carrière's psychological mystery prepares you to bask in one of those sexy, bittersweet marital comedies that are a hallmark of sophisticated French cinema. Then, by degrees, it subverts those expectations to spiral down a rabbit hole of ambiguity and doubt. (Holden) 'MISSION: IMPOSSIBLE III' (PG-13, 126 minutes) Er, this time it's personal, as Tom Cruise plays a dashing operative for a clandestine organization who sweeps a simpering brunette off her feet. Directed, without much flair, by J. J. Abrams, the small-screen auteur behind ''Lost'' and ''Alias.'' (Dargis) 'THE OMEN' (R, 110 minutes) The supremely unnecessary remake of ''The Omen,'' the 1976 horror show that, along with ''Rosemary's Baby'' and ''The Exorcist,'' plunked everyone's favorite baddie, Satan, into the Hollywood mainstream, wants to capitalize on the tabloid theology in the air. Except for a few contemporary touches (the World Trade Center in flames as a portent of Armageddon) it slavishly recycles the original. (Holden) 'OVER THE HEDGE' (PG, 83 minutes) This tale about some woodland critters threatened by their new human neighbors has the technical trappings of a worthwhile Saturday matinee, so it's too bad no one paid commensurate attention to the script. The writers, including Karey Kirkpatrick, who directed with Tim Johnson, pad the story with the usual yuks and some glop about family, but there is no poetry here and little thought. (Dargis) 'bombon-EL PERRO' (No rating, 96 minutes, in Spanish) A lonely, unemployed, middle-aged man finds a glimmer of hope when he acquires a purebred show dog in this sweet, gritty neo-realist fable from Argentina. (Scott) 'POSEIDON' (PG-13, 100 minutes) Wolfgang Petersen's ''Poseidon'' is unlikely to replace the original in the hearts of action-hungry moviegoers, though it will probably expunge the memory of the earlier, made-for-TV remake (and also, perhaps, of the 1979 sequel, ''Beyond the Poseidon Adventure''). The hard-working cast does a lot of screaming, climbing and death-defying in soaking-wet evening wear, but they can hardly hope to match the ripe absurdity of Shelley Winters, Red Buttons, Gene Hackman and Ernest Borgnine. (Scott) * 'A PRAIRIE HOME COMPANION' (PG-13, 105 minutes) Garrison Keillor's long-running Public Radio hootenanny turns out to be the perfect vehicle for Robert Altman's fluid, chaotic humanism. The performances -- especially by Lily Tomlin and Meryl Streep as a pair of singing sisters -- are so full of relaxed vitality that you almost don't notice that the film is, at heart, a wry, sober contemplation of mortality. (Scott) 'SEE NO EVIL' (R, 84 minutes) In ''See No Evil'' the wrestler Glen Jacobs (a k a Kane) plays a lumbering psychopath intent on butchering the juvenile delinquents on cleanup duty at the hotel where he's holed up. Propelled by an inebriated camera that careers off walls and, at one point, roots around in an empty eye socket, the movie soon devolves into a bloodily creative string of mutilations and impalings. (Jeannette Catsoulis) 'UNITED 93' (R, 115 minutes) A scrupulously tasteful Hollywood re-creation of the downing of the fourth plane hijacked by Muslim terrorists on Sept. 11 and easily the feel-bad American movie of the year. Written and directed by Paul Greengrass, whose earlier films include ''Bloody Sunday.'' (Dargis) * 'WATER' (PG-13, 114 minutes, in Hindi) Set in India in 1938, ''Water'' focuses on a group of widows condemned by Hindu law to live in an institution on the banks of the River Ganges. The arrival of a high-spirited 8-year-old girl encourages one widow to question her faith and another to begin a love affair with a Gandhian idealist. Bobbing back and forth between romantic melodrama and spiritual inquiry, ''Water'' is an exquisitely beautiful film about the institutionalized oppression of an entire class of women. (Catsoulis) 'X-MEN: THE LAST STAND' (PG-13, 104 minutes) As expected, the third and presumably last film about the powerful Marvel Comics mutants who walk and often fight among us pretty much looks and plays like the first two, though perhaps with more noise and babes, and a little less glum. The credited writers here are Simon Kinberg and Zak Penn, who, like the director, Brett Ratner, are not mutant enough to fly. (Dargis) Film Series HUMAN RIGHTS WATCH INTERNATIONAL FILM FESTIVAL (Through Thursday) This weekend's features in this annual festival, sponsored by the Film Society of Lincoln Center, include ''Amu'' (2005), about a young Indian-American and the 1984 Sikh massacre in Delhi; ''Winter in Baghdad'' (2005), a Spanish documentary about the effects of the United States invasion of Iraq; and ''Rosita'' (2005), the true story of a pregnant 9-year-old rape victim in Nicaragua. Walter Reade Theater, 165 West 65th Street, (212) 875-5600; $10. (Anita Gates) STANLEY KUBRICK RETROSPECTIVE (Through July 9) The Museum of the Moving Image's five-week series continues this weekend with ''Paths of Glory'' (1957), the World War I drama starring Kirk Douglas; ''Full Metal Jacket'' (1987), the Vietnam War drama (this screening is followed by a discussion with the film's star Matthew Modine); ''Spartacus'' (1960), with Kirk Douglas as a resourceful Roman slave; and ''A.I.: Artificial Intelligence'' (2001), the futuristic fantasy developed by Kubrick before his death and completed by Steven Spielberg. 35th Avenue at 36th Street, Astoria, Queens, (718) 784-0077; $10. (Gates) NEW YORK ASIAN FILM FESTIVAL (Through July 1) Subway Cinema's fifth annual festival of high-grossing and/or award-winning new movies opens today at Anthology Film Archives. The weekend's films, all from 2005, include ''Gangster,'' a particularly bloody crime flick from Malaysia; ''The Great Yokai War,'' which has been described as Takashi Miike's ''Lord of the Rings''; and ''Cromartie High School,'' a Japanese spoof of juvenile delinquent movies, with robots, demons and space monkeys. 32 Second Avenue, at Second Street, East Village, (212) 505-5181; $9. (Gates) TOMORROWLAND: CAL ARTS IN MOVING PICTURES (Through Aug. 13) The Museum of Modern Art is sponsoring a three-decade survey of films and videos by former students at the California Institute of the Arts. Four programs of shorts will be screened this weekend. The films include Joanna Priestley's ''Voices'' (1985), all about neuroses; Brooke Keesling's ''Boobie Girl'' (2001), about an unendowed young woman whose prayers are answered; and Q. Allen Brocka's eight-minute comedy ''Rick and Steve: The Happiest Gay Couple in All the World'' (2000). Roy and Niuta Titus Theaters, (212) 708-9400; $10. (Gates) TO SAVE AND PROJECT: THE FOURTH MOMA INTERNATIONAL FESTIVAL OF FILM PRESERVATION (Through June 21) This monthlong program of preserved and restored films continues at the Museum of Modern Art. This weekend's features include ''By the Law'' (1926), a Soviet silent based on Jack London's story ''The Unexpected,'' and ''The Mad Fox'' (1962), a Japanese fable in which a for tuneteller goes insane and marries an animal in human disguise. Roy and Niuta Titus Theaters, (212) 708-9400; $10. (Gates) THE VISION THAT CHANGED CINEMA: MICHELANGELO ANTONIONI (Through June 29) BAMcinématek's tribute to Antonioni continues with three films this weekend. ''Il Grido'' (1957) is his drama about a mechanic, rejected in love, who becomes a drifter. ''L'Avventura'' (1960) is a mystery drama about two men who grow close after a woman in their lives disappears. ''La Notte'' (1961) stars Jeanne Moreau and Marcello Mastroianni as a couple with a dying friend and a dying marriage. BAM Rose Cinemas, 30 Lafayette Avenue, at Ashland Place, Fort Greene, Brooklyn, (718) 636-4100; $10. (Gates) Pop Full reviews of recent concerts: nytimes.com/music. AFI (Thursday) This band, whose name stands for A Fire Inside, gives its funereal emo songs a jolt of energy by reaching back to the anthemic hard-core punk of 1980's groups like Agnostic Front and Naked Raygun. The recipe works: this week, on the strength of its catchy single ''Miss Murder,'' the band's new album, ''Decemberunderground'' (Interscope), went to No. 1. Also on the bill are Dillinger Escape Plan, which plays an impossibly complex kind of punk-jazz, and Nightmare of You. At 7:30 p.m., Roseland, 239 West 52nd Street, Manhattan, (212) 777-6800; sold out. (Ben Sisario) LAURIE ANDERSON (Tomorrow) Her entrancing performances weave coolly surrealistic songs and witty, reflective monologues with a seamless dream logic. At this outdoor concert, part of the Celebrate Brooklyn series, she will play new, old and improvised pieces, and will be joined by the Tuvan throat singers of Chirgilchin, who also open the show. At 7:30 p.m., Prospect Park Bandshell, Prospect Park West and Ninth Street, Park Slope, (718) 855-7882; $3 suggested donation. (Sisario) BABY GRAMPS (Tomorrow through Tuesday) With a gray beard the size of small shrubbery, a raspy Popeye voice and manic skills on the steel guitar, Baby Gramps offers a cartoonish variation on the role of hobo troubadour in old-timey songs like ''Big Rock Candy Mountain.'' But where he really shines is in his hilarious and ingenious wordplay, as in his palindrome song (''Go hang a salami -- I'm a lasagna hog''). Tomorrow at 7 p.m., Terra Blues, 149 Bleecker Street, Greenwich Village, (212) 777-7776. Sunday at 9 p.m., Rodeo Bar, 375 Third Avenue, at 27th Street, Manhattan, (212) 683-6500; free. Monday at 9:30 p.m., Lakeside Lounge, 162 Avenue B, between 10th and 11th Streets, East Village, (212) 529-8463; free. Tuesday at 8 p.m., Zebulon Cafe, 258 Wythe Avenue, near North Third Street, Williamsburg, Brooklyn, (718) 218-6934; free. (Sisario) BEIRUT (Tuesday) Zach Condon, a 19-year-old from Albuquerque, has already made albums inspired by the Magnetic Fields and classic doo-wop. For his latest, ''Gulag Orkestar'' (Ba Da Bing), released under the name Beirut, he turned to the somber and ecstatic marches of Balkan Gypsy music. On the album Mr. Condon plays most of the horns, pianos, organs, percussion and even ukulele and mandolins himself, but for this tour he is joined by a full band. With A Hawk and a Hacksaw. At 9 p.m., Northsix, 66 North Sixth Street, Williamsburg, Brooklyn, (718) 599-5103; $10. (Sisario) CHUCK BERRY (Tonight) Half a century ago, in songs like ''Maybellene'' and ''Johnny B. Goode,'' Chuck Berry hit on a formula that gives him as much a claim as anybody to being the inventor of rock 'n' roll: a taut, fast boogie derived from R & B, matched to lyrics that celebrate the carefree, mythical teenage lifestyle. At 8, B. B. King Blues Club and Grill, 243 West 42nd Street, Manhattan, (212) 997-4144; $90. (Sisario) BLUE CHEER (Sunday and Tuesday) On a few gloriously untidy albums in the late 1960's and early 70's, Blue Cheer followed the blunter edges of Jimi Hendrix's sound into a bludgeoning kind of primordial heavy metal, and played it with an un-self-conscious glee that made the members sound like cavemen discovering fire. Sunday at 9 p.m., with Dead Meadow, Maxwell's, 1039 Washington Street, Hoboken, N.J., (201) 653-1703; $15. Tuesday at 8 p.m., with the Black Hollies, CBGB, 315 Bowery, at Bleecker Street, East Village, (212) 982-4052; $15. (Sisario) 'BROADWAY BY THE YEAR: THE MUSICALS OF 1978' (Monday) In the last program this season of Town Hall's Broadway by the Year series, ''Ain't Misbehavin','' ''Eubie!,'' ''The Best Little Whorehouse in Texas,'' ''On the Twentieth Century'' and other shows from 1978 get the oh-what-a-time treatment from Carolee Carmelo, Mary Bond Davis, Chuck Cooper, Felicia Finley, Julie Garnye, Nancy Opel, Noah Racey, Christine Pedi, Lennie Watts and Lari White. At 8 p.m., 123 West 43rd Street, Manhattan, (212) 840-2824; $40 and $45. (Sisario) ALEJANDRO ESCOVEDO, MARAH (Thursday) Mr. Escovedo's songs stare down loss and mortality with a mixture of unflinching memory and a rocker's defiance. The band Marah's articulate songs are doused in greasy, sweaty, exuberant rock. At 7:30 p.m., Irving Plaza, 17 Irving Place, at 15th Street, Manhattan, (212) 777-6800; $20. (Jon Pareles) FAIRPORT CONVENTION (Sunday) One original member and two later recruits of this groundbreaking British progressive-folk group from the 1960's and 70's -- the guitarist Simon Nicol, who was in it from the beginning, along with the violinist and mandolin player Chris Leslie and the violinist Ric Sanders -- play an acoustic set of Fairport Convention songs, jazz and swing standards and traditional folk. At 7 p.m., Joe's Pub at the Public Theater, 425 Lafayette Street, at Astor Place, East Village, (212) 239-6200; $25. (Sisario) THE FIGGS (Tonight) Joining the pop-punk lineage that stretches back to the early, rowdy Beatles and any number of 1960's garage bands, the Figgs make their guitars blare through the neat constructions of their songs. They sing about rejects and romantic also-rans, with a streak of resentment that's as strong as their melodic skills. With Tommy Keene and Seth Tiven. At 9:30, Maxwell's, 1039 Washington Street, Hoboken, N.J., (201) 653-1703; $10. (Pareles) * ARETHA FRANKLIN (Tuesday and Wednesday) Aretha Franklin has said she intends to stop extensive touring, but she keeps coming back, to grateful crowds. She gives her first concerts at the Apollo Theater in more than 20 years. At 8 p.m., 253 West 125th Street, Harlem, (212) 531-5305 or (212) 307-7171; $77 to $177. (Sisario) 'FROM B TO Z' (Tomorrow) The avant-garde band the Z's, whose songs sputter forth in Morse-code dots of percussion and saxophone, kicks off a tour at this ''episode'' in a series of casual artistic gatherings. The night also features music by Electroputas, Lake, Vizusa and Legend, projections by Meredith Arena and dance by Skint. At 8 p.m., Cake Shop, 152 Ludlow Street, between Stanton and Rivington Streets, Lower East Side, (212) 253-0036; $7. (Sisario) GOMEZ (Wednesday) This British band emerged in the mid-1990's, the heyday of Britpop, with an against-the-grain obsession with tight, sharp blues-rock. On its new album, ''How We Operate'' (ATO), it has veered into folkier realms, though it still plays with unusual precision and focus. Also on the bill is Martha Wainwright, whose passionate songs swirl from her acoustic guitar into grand arrangements but never lose their intimacy. At 7:30 p.m., Webster Hall, 125 East 11th Street, East Village, (212) 533-2111; $25. (Sisario) ETTA JAMES, SUSAN TEDESCHI (Tuesday) In 1954 a teenage Etta James made her first record, ''The Wallflower (Dance With Me, Henry),'' a flirty response to Hank Ballard's hit ''Work With Me, Annie,'' and she has been singing sexy, assertive blues and R & B ever since. She comes to Carnegie Hall as part of the JVC Jazz Festival, with Susan Tedeschi, a singer and guitarist who blends some soul and funk into her blues. At 8 p.m., (212) 247-7800; $35 to $85. (Sisario) LEGENDARY PINK DOTS (Monday and Tuesday) Since 1980, Edward Ka-Spel has led the Legendary Pink Dots through songs that hold on to the psychedelia of 1967-68; they set his surreal imagery and hints of gothic legend to music that can be amiable, chaotic or eerie. With One Bit Music on Monday and Beat the Devil on Tuesday. At 8 p.m., Knitting Factory, 74 Leonard Street, TriBeCa, (212) 219-3006; $15 in advance, $18 at the door.

(Sisario) * NELLIE McKAY (Sunday) On nights off from ''The Threepenny Opera'' on Broadway, Ms. McKay, a songwriting sprite whom it is impossible to get tired of, has been playing a series of late-night shows at Joe's Pub; this weekend's show is her last. These are rare chances to hear the songs from her excellent second album, ''Pretty Little Head,'' which has been in music purgatory since Ms. McKay was dropped by Columbia late last year. At 11:30 p.m.; Joe's Pub at the Public Theater, 425 Lafayette Street, at Astor Place, East Village, (212) 239-6200; $20.

(Sisario) RHETT MILLER, TEDDY THOMPSON, OLLABELLE (Tomorrow) Country and folk will get three varied readings at Central Park SummerStage tomorrow. Rhett Miller, whether with his country-flavored bar band Old 97's or in solo heartthrob mode, is an unrepentant honky-tonker with a gift for melody. Teddy Thompson is the son of the great British folk-pop singers Richard and Linda Thompson, and he absorbed some of his parents' pithy melancholy, an attitude that leaves room for some smirks. Ollabelle worships country, bluegrass and gospel with crystalline voices and wide eyes. At 3 p.m., Rumsey Playfield, midpark at 70th Street, (212) 360-2777; free. (Sisario) MORNINGWOOD (Wednesday) Led by Chantal Claret -- who, when not whipping her hair into a brunet cloud, struts the stage in a hypersexualized trance -- Morningwood plays quick, jumpy, New Wave vamps about one of two things: sex and rock. With Rock Kills Kid and Big City Rock. At 7 p.m., Warsaw, 261 Driggs Avenue, at Eckford Street, Greenpoint, Brooklyn, (718) 387-0505; $15. (Sisario) NINE INCH NAILS, BAUHAUS (Tonight and tomorrow night) Trent Reznor waited six years to make another Nine Inch Nails album, but ''With Teeth,'' released last year, showed that Mr. Reznor's talents for disorienting electronica, self-flagellating lyrics and, most of all, cathartic tantrums of noise, have remained intact. This summer Nine Inch Nails is touring with Bauhaus, whose bleak and shadowy songs helped create goth-rock in the late 1970's and early 80's. Also on the bill is Peaches, whose bawdy electro-punk burlesque provides its own kind of catharsis. Tonight at 7, PNC Bank Arts Center, Holmdel, N.J., (732) 335-8698; $29.50 to $49.50. Tomorrow night at 7, Nikon at Jones Beach Theater, Wantagh, N.Y., (516) 221-1000; $29.50 to $49.50. (Sisario) ODETTA (Thursday) Odetta has been a blues powerhouse since the 1950's, strumming hard and singing with a deep, leathery voice that harks back to field hollers and spirituals. She gives her songs the authority of archetypes. At noon, BAM Rhythm & Blues Festival, MetroTech Commons Plaza, Flatbush Avenue and Myrtle Street, Downtown Brooklyn, (718) 636-4100; free. (Pareles) * TOM PETTY AND THE HEARTBREAKERS (Tuesday) Tom Petty is going all out for his current tour, celebrating 30 years with the Heartbreakers. Peter Bogdanovich is working on a documentary, and the roster of guests for dates later in the summer includes Pearl Jam and the Allman Brothers. At Madison Square Garden on Tuesday, the opening act will be Trey Anastasio from Phish, and Stevie Nicks is to join the band for, among others, ''Stop Draggin' My Heart Around,'' her duet with Mr. Petty that still sounds as achy and soulful as it did in 1981. At 8 p.m., (212) 465-6741; $45 to $85. (Sisario) SMOKEY ROBINSON (Thursday) As part of the JVC Jazz Festival, the Motown prince makes his first appearance at Carnegie Hall in 31 years. At 8 p.m., (212) 247-7800; $35 to $85. (Sisario) SLAYER, LAMB OF GOD, MASTODON, CHILDREN OF BODOM (Tonight) Here is a quick primer on the meaner side of heavy metal over the last couple of decades. Slayer emerged in the early 1980's with a hellish, claustrophobic sound -- all foreboding skies and tormented vocals -- and has stuck steadfastly to it. Lamb of God, from Richmond, Va., derives some of its grinding, jackhammer-fast churn from Slayer and Pantera, and, without any irony or sarcasm, calls its style ''pure American metal.'' Mastodon reaches into avant-garde noise and progressive rock, and Children of Bodom, from Finland, is an exemplar of the operatically dismal black-metal school. At 5:30 p.m., Continental Airlines Arena, East Rutherford, N.J., (201) 935-3900; $39. (Sisario) SOUTHSIDE JOHNNY AND THE ASBURY JUKES (Tomorrow and Sunday) While his friend Bruce Springsteen left the Jersey Shore behind and went on to write all-American anthems and parables, Southside Johnny Lyon stuck to the old bar-band basics: rolling R & B vamps and raspy-voiced, good-natured soul plaints, complete with horn section. At 8 p.m., B. B. King Blues Club and Grill, 237 West 42nd Street, Manhattan, (212) 997-4144; $35. (Pareles) * BRUCE SPRINGSTEEN WITH THE SEEGER SESSIONS BAND (Thursday) A hootenanny of musicians, playing banjos, accordions, fiddles and guitars, accompanies Bruce Springsteen in folk songs of work, hardscrabble survival and political anger -- the Depression-era ''How Can a Poor Man Stand Such Times and Live'' gets a Hurricane Katrina rewrite -- from his latest album, ''We Shall Overcome: The Seeger Sessions'' (Columbia). At 8 p.m., Madison Square Garden, (212) 465-6741; $59.50 to $89.50. (Sisario) TAKFARINAS (Sunday) The Algerian singer Hassen Zermani, who performs as Takfarinas and plays a double-necked lute, blends Berber music with reggae and electronic pop. With Chris Berry and Panjea. At 3 p.m., Central Park SummerStage, Rumsey Playfield, midpark at 70th Street, (212) 360-2777; free. (Sisario) * LEE ANN WOMACK (Tonight) Ms. Womack drew the respect of Nashville and lots of new fans with last year's ''There's More Where That Came From,'' whose heartfelt reflections, conservative arrangements and outstanding songwriting represented an ideal of country music. At 8, St. George Theater, 35 Hyatt Street, Staten Island, (718) 442-2900 or (212) 307-7171; $50 to $85. (Sisario) YELLOWCARD (Wednesday) Yellowcard's mopey lyrics and nursery-rhyme pop-punk might sound like generic emo-rock until you hear the violin. And even then At 7 p.m., Nokia Theater, 1515 Broadway, at 44th Street, (212) 307-7171; $26 in advance, $28 at the door. (Sisario) Cabaret Full reviews of recent cabaret shows: nytimes.com/music. BARBARA CARROLL (Sunday) Even when swinging out, this Lady of a Thousand Songs remains an impressionist with special affinities for Thelonious Monk and bossa nova. At 2 p.m., the Algonquin Hotel, Oak Room, 59 West 44th Street, Manhattan, (212) 419-9331; $58, including brunch at noon. (Stephen Holden) BLOSSOM DEARIE (Tomorrow and Sunday) To watch this singer and pianist is to appreciate the power of a carefully deployed pop-jazz minimalism combined with a highly discriminating taste in songs. The songs date from all periods of a career remarkable for its longevity and for Ms. Dearie's stubborn independence and sly wit. Tomorrow at 7 p.m., Sunday at 6:15 p.m., Danny's Skylight Room, 346 West 46th Street, Clinton, (212) 265-8133; $25, with a $15 minimum, or $54.50 for a dinner-and-show package. (Holden) * Eartha Kitt (Tonight and tomorrow night, and Tuesday through Thursday nights) The latest edition of an act Ms. Kitt has been performing for decades is the lightest, swiftest and funniest one to date, and that's all to the good. More than ever, the singer, now a glamorous 79, pauses to poke fun at her status as the greatest and wittiest of all singing tigresses. At 8:45, with additional shows tonight and tomorrow night at 10:45, Café Carlyle, Carlyle Hotel, 35 East 76th Street, Manhattan, (212) 744-1600; $100. (Holden) ANNIE ROSS (Wednesday) Cool, funny, swinging and indestructible, this 75-year-old singer and sometime actress exemplifies old-time hip in its most generous incarnation. At 9:15 p.m., Danny's Skylight Room, 346 West 46th Street, Clinton, (212) 265-8133; $25, with a $12 minimum. (Holden) Jazz Full reviews of recent jazz concerts: nytimes.com/music.

(Chinen) CHRIS BOTTI/LIZZ WRIGHT (Tomorrow) The world of contemporary jazz, as it's now called, has few stylists as consistently winsome as Mr. Botti, a trumpeter whose melodic understatement (along with a few celebrity endorsements) has translated into popular appeal. Ms. Wright is a young and self-assured singer whose soulful alto has emerged as one of jazz's most welcome new timbres. At 8 p.m., Carnegie Hall, (212) 247-7800; $30 to $75. JVC Jazz Festival. (Chinen) BRAZIL NIGHTS (Wednesday through June 24) As part of the JVC Jazz Festival, the Jazz Standard offers four consecutive nights of Brazilian jazz, beginning with Choro Ensemble, a quintet that devotes itself to the choro, a traditional strain of cafe music (Wednesday), and Antropo-Fagia, a new quintet led by the percussionist Cyro Baptista and featuring the guitarist Romero Lubambo (Thursday). At 7:30 and 9:30 p.m., with an 11:30 p.m. set on Fridays and Saturdays, Jazz Standard, 116 East 27th Street, Manhattan, (212) 576-2232; cover, $25. (Chinen) DAVE BRUBECK'S BIRTHDAY PARTY: TAKE 5 PLUS 80 (Wednesday) At 85, Mr. Brubeck plays the piano with undiminished vigor and still maintains a punishing schedule. This concert features not only his well-traveled quartet but also a new big band, in its first New York performance. For good measure, Bill Cosby will also be there. At 8 p.m., Carnegie Hall, (212) 247-7800; $30 to $75. JVC Jazz Festival. (Chinen) CLARINET MARMALADE (Tuesday) The clarinet, once a dominant instrument in jazz, has become something of a connoisseur's choice. This concert gathers a handful of its leading contemporary practitioners, with styles ranging from New Orleans traditional (Evan Christopher) to mainstream swing (Ken Peplowski, Kenny Davern) to ultramodern (Don Byron). At 8 p.m., Kaye Playhouse 68th Street, between Lexington and Park Avenues, (212) 772-4448; $45. JVC Jazz Festival. (Chinen) CLARION CALL: A NEW ORLEANS TRUMPET CELEBRATION (Thursday) Four accomplished trumpeters from New Orleans -- Marlon Jordan, Kermit Ruffins, James Andrews and Christian Scott -- join a rhythm section with similar pedigree: David Torkanowsky on piano, Roland Guerin on bass and Herlin Riley on drums.

(Chinen) * ORNETTE COLEMAN QUINTET (Tonight) With an expanded version of the superb quartet first heard at a JVC Jazz Festival concert at Carnegie Hall in 2003, the alto saxophonist and composer Ornette Coleman pursues a holistic ideal of improvised group communication that's easier to recognize than define. His fellow adventurers are Tony Falanga and Greg Cohen on double basses, Al MacDowell on electric bass, and Denardo Coleman, his son, on drums. At 8, Carnegie Hall, (212) 247-7800; $30 to $75. JVC Jazz Festival. (Chinen) RAVI COLTRANE QUARTET (Tuesday through June 24) Mr. Coltrane, the tenor and soprano saxophonist, has developed one of the strongest working bands in jazz over the past few years.

At 9 and 11 p.m., Birdland, 315 West 44th Street, Clinton, (212) 581-3080; cover, $30; $35 on Fridays and Saturdays, with a $10 minimum.

Rose Hall, Jazz at Lincoln Center, 60th Street and Broadway, (212) 258-9595; cover, $30, with a minimum of $10 at tables, $5 at the bar. (Chinen) DIZZY GILLESPIE ALL-STAR BIG BAND (Tuesday through June 25) Bebop's goateed ambassador did some of his best work with big bands, a fact that this repertory ensemble, led by his former trombonist and arranger Slide Hampton, happily exploits. The band includes other veterans of Gillespie's employ -- like the saxophonists James Moody, Frank Wess and Jimmy Heath -- as well as Roy Hargrove, the trumpeter enlisted to fill his shoes here. At 8 and 10:30 p.m., Blue Note, 131 West Third Street, West Village, (212) 475-8592; cover, $35 at tables, $20 at the bar, with a $5 minimum. (Chinen) BOBBY HUTCHERSON QUARTET (Sunday) In the late 1960's, Mr. Hutcherson defined a commanding, harmonically exploratory post-bop vibraphone style. He has lost none of his prowess, as he has demonstrated in recent years with the SFJAZZ Collective, and as he further proves here, with a rhythm section composed of Renee Rosnes on piano, Dwayne Burno on bass and Willie Jones III on drums. At 3 p.m., Schomburg Center for Research in Black Culture, 515 Lenox Avenue, at West 135th Street, Harlem, (212) 491-2200; $20; members, $17. JVC Jazz Festival.

(Chinen) BRAD MEHLDAU (Tuesday) In his solo piano recitals Mr. Mehldau blends judicious pop offerings, archaic songbook standards and intricate originals, employing a touch that runs from sprightly to somber. His recent solo album ''Live in Tokyo'' (Nonesuch) was a noteworthy achievement, and time has only deepened his ambidextrous grace. At 8:30 p.m., Zankel Hall, Carnegie Hall, (212) 247-7800; $50. JVC Jazz Festival. (Chinen) MARCUS MILLER BAND/ROY HARGROVE AND RH FACTOR (Tonight) There may not be a funkier electric bassist than Mr. Miller, who is still best known for his work with the late, synthesizer-strewn bands of Miles Davis. Mr. Miller's own ensemble includes a Milesian trumpeter, Patches Stewart, as well as the drummer Poogie Bell, the saxophonist Keith Anderson, the keyboardist Bobby Sparks and the harmonica virtuoso Grégoire Maret. Some of those musicians also have ties to RH Factor, a neo-soul outfit led by Mr. Hargrove, a sharp and ever-poised trumpeter. At 9, Irving Plaza, 17 Irving Place, at East 15th Street, Manhattan, (212) 307-7171; $30. JVC Jazz Festival. (Chinen) NU JAZZ TODAY! (Tonight) This concert, which inaugurates the Central Park SummerStage season, assembles four acts that spike their grooves with avant-garde experimentation. In ascending order of abstraction, they are Nils Petter Molvaer, a Norwegian trumpeter specializing in electronic textures; Groundtruther, composed of the guitarists Charlie Hunter and Elliott Sharp and the drummer Bobby Previte; Sex Mob, a quartet equally enamored of Billy Preston and Albert Ayler; and Matthew Shipp, a pianist and composer drawn to thorny pointillism. At 7, Central Park SummerStage, midpark at 70th Street, (212) 360-2777; www.summerstage.org; free. (Chinen) BUCKY PIZZARELLI 80TH-BIRTHDAY CELEBRATION (Monday) Warmth and wit are assured in this party for Mr. Pizzarelli, the venerable swing guitarist.

At 8 p.m., Kaye Playhouse, 68th Street, between Lexington and Park Avenues, (212) 772-4448; $45. JVC Jazz Festival. (Chinen) CHRIS POTTER'S UNDERGROUND (Tonight) The tenor saxophonist Chris Potter has an improvisational approach that is intellectual and athletic in equal measure. His funk-fusion band Underground, originally formed at the 55 Bar, returns there tonight. At 10 p.m., 55 Bar, 55 Christopher Street, West Village, (212) 929-9883; cover, $10. (Chinen) ROB REDDY QUINTET (Tuesday) Mr. Reddy is a soprano and alto saxophonist with a taste for ragged polyphony; he features his own compositions in this group with the guitarist Jef Lee Johnson, the pianist Michael Cain, the bassist Dom Richards and the drummer Pheeroan akLaff. At 8 p.m., Tonic, 107 Norfolk Street, near Delancey Street, Lower East Side, (212) 358-7501; cover, $12. (Chinen) JASON RIGBY QUARTET (Monday) ''Translucent Space'' (Fresh Sound-New Talent), the new album by the saxophonist and bass clarinetist Jason Rigby, doesn't come by its name casually; it's an album of airy, often diaphanous music, with faint echoes of early fusion and Third Stream. Mr. Rigby plays here with the album's rhythm section of Mike Holober on piano, Cameron Brown on bass and Mark Ferber on drums. At 8:30 p.m., Cornelia Street Café, 29 Cornelia Street, West Village, (212) 989-9319; cover, $10, with a one-drink minimum. (Chinen) NED ROTHENBERG, GERRY HEMINGWAY, ALEX WATERMAN (Tonight) Extended techniques and broad textural range are both assured in this ensemble, which consists of Mr. Rothenberg on saxophones, clarinets and shakuhachi; Mr. Waterman on cello; and Mr. Hemingway on drums and percussion.

(Chinen) * SANGAM: CHARLES LLOYD, ZAKIR HUSSAIN, ERIC HARLAND (Thursday) This collaborative trio recently released a gripping self-titled album documenting its first performance, in 2004. The group has toured since then, and its exploratory rapport has sharpened; what remains the same is the quality of its components, from the saxophones and flutes of Mr. Lloyd to the percussive virtuosity of Mr. Hussain (on tablas) and Mr. Harland (on drum kit). At 8:30 p.m., Zankel Hall, Carnegie Hall, (212) 247-7800; $50. JVC Jazz Festival. (Chinen) SWEET LORRAINE: A JAZZ CELEBRATION FOR THE VILLAGE VANGUARD (Monday) Lorraine Gordon, the owner and proprietor of the Village Vanguard, receives a fitting tribute from some of the top-shelf bands that have been regulars at the club: the Vanguard Jazz Orchestra, with the saxophonist Joe Lovano as a guest; the Roy Hargrove Quintet, with the vibraphonist Bobby Hutcherson; a group led by the drummer Paul Motian, featuring the saxophonist Chris Potter; Dr. Michael White's Original Liberty Jazz Band, from New Orleans; and the Bad Plus. 8 p.m., Carnegie Hall, (212) 247-7800; $30 to $75. JVC Jazz Festival. (Chinen) RALPH TOWNER (Wednesday) Mr. Towner has perfected a solo guitar style of exceptional fullness, as he recently demonstrated on a gem of an album called ''Time Line'' (ECM). In all likelihood, he'll perform an equally entrancing program here. At 8:30 p.m., Zankel Hall, Carnegie Hall, (212) 247-7800; $50. JVC Jazz Festival. (Chinen) TRIO BRAAMDEJOODEVATCHER (Tonight) The unwieldy name of this Dutch piano trio is merely a combination of surnames: Michiel Braam, pianist; Wilbert de Joode, bassist; and Michael Vatcher, drummer. As heard on an appealing new live album, ''Change This Song'' (Bik Bent Braam), the group practices a strain of modern jazz that's pliable, playful and rhythmically capricious. At 7:30 p.m., Tonic, 107 Norfolk Street, near Delancey Street, Lower East Side, (212) 358-7501; cover, $8. (Chinen) * VISION FESTIVAL XI (Through Sunday) Avant-garde jazz culture has no better colloquy in this country than the Vision Festival, which encompasses experimental dance and visual arts as well as improvised music. Its final few days include promising panel discussions and afternoon performances, but the focus remains on the evening concerts, featuring luminaries like the violinist Billy Bang (tonight) and the saxophonist and composer Roscoe Mitchell (tomorrow). Sunday's closing act, scheduled for 9 p.m., is being billed as the final United States performance of the saxophonist David S. Ware's celebrated quartet. Times vary, with activities running from the afternoon past midnight at Angel Orensanz Foundation for the Arts, 172 Norfolk Street, Lower East Side, visionfestival.org; $25 per night. (Chinen) MATT WILSON AND TED NASH (Monday) Mr. Wilson, a drummer, and Mr. Nash, a saxophonist and flutist, have played together in each other's groups (and other settings) for years, so they should have no problem connecting in a duo setting. Among the traits they have in common: rhythmic flexibility, melodic directness and an aversion to pretension and cliché. At 8 p.m., Merkin Concert Hall, 129 West 67th Street, Manhattan, (212) 501-3330; $25. (Chinen) Classical Full reviews of recent music performances: nytimes.com/music.

(Bernard Holland) LOCRIAN CHAMBER PLAYERS (Tonight) There are contemporary chamber music ensembles, and then there are the Locrian Chamber Players, a vehemently contemporary chamber music ensemble. The group's operating principle is to perform only works written within the last 10 years. If this policy seems unduly restrictive, looked at another way, it's fresh and exciting, and represents the group's conviction that there are enough worthy works being written right now to assure varied and engaging programs. Tonight the ensemble plays works by the major German composer Wolfgang Rihm, as well as by John Adams, Tom Johnson, David MacDonald and Jonathan Faiman (a pianist with the ensemble). The free concerts are held in the intimate and acoustically vibrant performance space on the 10th floor of Riverside Church, which even boasts an open-air balcony accessible during intermission. At 8, 91 Claremont Avenue, at 121st Street, Morningside Heights, (718) 458-4864. (Anthony Tommasini) MANNES INSTITUTE AND FESTIVAL FOR CONTEMPORARY PERFORMANCE (Thursday) The format resembles that at the Marlboro festival in Vermont, but the content is strictly modern. Starting this week and running through June 30, this year's institute focuses on violin, piano and percussion, offering young participants a chance to work with the likes of Frederic Rzewski and Curtis Macomber in master classes, open rehearsals and symposiums. The definition of contemporary seems to extend back to the early 20th century; at the first public concert on Thursday, Rolf Schulte, a violinist, and Marc Ponthus, a pianist and the institute's director, will play works by Krenek, Stockhausen, Mario Davidovsky and Richard Wilson. Events begin at 10:30 a.m.; the concert is at 8 p.m., Mannes College, 150 West 85th Street, Manhattan, (212) 580-0210, Ext. 4884; free. (Anne Midgette) TANNERY POND CONCERTS (Tomorrow) Christian Steiner is well known for his photography; less well known, perhaps, as a musician; and least known as the artistic director of this lovely little concert series, for which he lures leading musicians up to the Berkshires to perform in an enchanting little wooden hall. This weekend's offering is an all-Milhaud program, with the pianist Gilbert Kalish, the violinist Carmit Zori and other musicians. At 8 p.m., Mount Lebanon Shaker Village, New Lebanon, N.Y., (888) 820-9441; $25 and $30.

At 7:30 p.m., Dance Theater Workshop, 219 West 19th Street, Chelsea, (212) 924-0077; $25; $15 for students, 65+ and artists.

(Dunning) DIXIE FUN DANCE THEATER (Through Sunday) During ''The Money Show,'' which concerns the cost of producing modern dance, members of the audience will receive tokens they can spend on anything from food services to foot massages. There will also be a snowstorm of theatrical money. Tonight and tomorrow night at 8, Sunday at 2 p.m., Dance New Amsterdam, 280 Broadway, at Chambers Street, Lower Manhattan, (212) 279-4200 or www.ticketcentral.com, $17.

Danspace Project at St. Mark's Church, 131 East 10th Street, at Second Avenue, East Village, (212) 674-8112 or www.danspaceproject.org; $10; $5 with two cans of food. (Dunning) ISH (Tonight through Sunday) This Dutch company presents ''4-ISH,'' a show that might be called hip-hop but is really hip-hoppish and involves many kinds of urban derring-do, including quarter pipes (as in skateboarding), kung fu, electrified skate wheels and a live D.J. Tonight at 7, tomorrow at 2 and 7 p.m., Sunday at noon and 5 p.m., New Victory Theater, 209 West 42nd Street, Manhattan, (212) 239-6200, newvictory.org; $10 to $30.

(Anderson) * JACOB'S PILLOW DANCE FESTIVAL (Wednesday and Thursday) After an opening gala tomorrow night, this bucolic, tradition-laden, artistically lively Berkshires dance festival -- the premiere event of its kind in the Northeast and (along with the American Dance Festival in North Carolina) the country -- gets under way on Wednesday. The opening attraction is CND2, whose name is short for the second company of Nacho Duato's Compañía Nacional de Danza from Spain. This is the younger, smaller ensemble attached to the big company, and it devotes itself to Mr. Duato's quirky, inventive choreography. Ted Shawn Theater at 8 p.m. $50; $45 for students, 65+ and children. Details of the week's free performances and exhibitions can be found at www.jacobspillow.org. Jacob's Pillow Dance Festival, 358 George Carter Road, Becket, Mass., (413) 243-0745 or (413) 243-9919, Ext. 25, for gala information.

The penultimate Diamond Project commission, Alexei Ratmansky's, will get its final performance Wednesday night. All the programs in the last week, starting Tuesday, will be conducted by Andrea Quinn, the departing music director; there will be a special tribute to her on Wednesday. The season ends June 25. Tonight, tomorrow night and Thursday night at 8; tomorrow at 2 p.m.; Sunday at 3 p.m.; Tuesday and Wednesday at 7:30 p.m. New York State Theater, Lincoln Center, (212) 870-5570 or nycballet.org; $30 to $86; student rush tickets, $15. (Rockwell) * NOCHE FLAMENCA WITH SOLEDAD BARRIO (Tonight through Sunday; Wednesday and Thursday) Ms. Barrio is a remarkable dancer, serious and impassioned, and the hit of this winter's Flamenco Gala at City Center.

Tonight, tomorrow night and Wednesday and Thursday nights at 8; tomorrow and Sunday at 2 p.m. Sunday at 5 p.m., Theater 80, 80 St. Marks Place, East Village, (212) 352-3101 or theatermania.com; $45.

Tonight at 8, tomorrow at 2 and 8 p.m., Ailey Citigroup Theater, 405 West 55th Street, Clinton, (212) 868-4444 or www.notesinmotion.org; $35.

(Dunning) RAIFORD ROGERS MODERN BALLET (Wednesday and Thursday) A program of repertory works features the premiere of ''Transcription,'' a multimedia piece that seeks to create the sensation of a vehicle moving through the ethnically diverse neighborhoods of Los Angeles. (Through June 24.) At 8 p.m., Ailey Citigroup Theater, 405 West 55th Street, Clinton, (800) 595-4849 or www.tix.com. $20; $15 for students and 65+. (Anderson) Art Museums and galleries are in Manhattan unless otherwise noted. Full reviews of recent art shows: nytimes.com/art. Museums * American Folk Art Museum: 'WHITE ON WHITE (AND A LITTLE GRAY),' through Sept. 17. The importance of neo-Classicism to early American architecture, silver and fine furniture is not exactly news. This small, beautiful show follows its spread into more personal corners of visual culture: often exquisite, strikingly dimensional white-work bedcovers; luminously grisaille, sometimes wacky marble-dust drawings; and print-work embroidery mourning pictures. 45 West 53rd Street, (212) 265-1040. (Roberta Smith) * BROOKLYN MUSEUM: 'SYMPHONIC POEM: THE ART OF AMINAH BRENDA LYNN ROBINSON,' through Aug. 13. This prodigious show, by an artist born and still living in Columbus, Ohio, celebrates her heritage in paintings, drawings, sculpture, stitchery, leather work and less classifiable forms of expression. Besides its sheer visual wizardry, using materials like leaves, twigs, bark, buttons and cast-off clothes, her art is compelling in that it ruminates on the history of black migration to, and settlement in, the United States, from early times to the present, in a garrulous, very personal way. 200 Eastern Parkway, at Prospect Park, (718) 638-5000. (Grace Glueck) COOPER-HEWITT NATIONAL DESIGN MUSEUM: 'FREDERIC CHURCH, WINSLOW HOMER AND THOMAS MORAN: TOURISM AND THE AMERICAN LANDSCAPE,' through Oct. 22. It turns out that the Cooper-Hewitt owns thousands of rarely seen paintings, prints and sketches by Church, Homer and Moran. Studies of the countryside, mostly, they revere unspoiled nature and record tourism, a booming industry in 19th-century America. Here they're combined with antique postcards, old Baedekers, stereoscopic photographs, playing cards with pictures of Yellowstone on them and souvenir platters, all to trace the nation's transformation from primeval wilderness to Catskills resort. The show is extremely entertaining. 2 East 91st Street, at Fifth Avenue, (212) 849-8400. (Michael Kimmelman) * FRICK COLLECTION: 'VERONESE'S ALLEGORIES: VIRTUE, LOVE AND EXPLORATION IN RENAISSANCE VENICE,' through July 16. Paolo Veronese (1528-88), a superb colorist and one of the most suavely sensuous of Renaissance Venetian painters, used the age-old device of allegory to make abstract concepts visual, often by means of human or mythological figures. In this five-painting show, the first to include all of his large-scale allegories from American collections, high ideals mingle with earthy and sometimes erotic physicality, as in the painting ''Venus and Mars United by Love.'' 1 East 70th Street, (212) 288-0700. (Glueck) SOLOMON R. GUGGENHEIM MUSEUM: 'ZAHA HADID: THIRTY YEARS IN ARCHITECTURE,' through Oct. 25. This exhibition, Ms. Hadid's first major retrospective in the United States, gives New Yorkers a chance to see what they've been missing. The show, in the Solomon R. Guggenheim Museum's rotunda, spirals through Ms. Hadid's career, from her early enchantment with Soviet Constructivism to the sensuous and fluid cityscapes of her more recent commissions. It illuminates her capacity for bridging different worlds: traditional perspective drawing and slick computer-generated imagery, and the era of utopian manifestos and the ambiguous values of the information age. (212) 423-3500. (Nicolai Ouroussoff) * International Center of Photography: 'UNKNOWN WEEGEE,' through Aug. 27. From the 1930's through the 1950's, Weegee -- real name, Arthur Fellig (1899-1968) -- was one of the best known news photographers in the country. He specialized in capturing the sensational side of urban life: crime, disaster, demi-monde nightlife. Tirelessly invasive, he lived by night. For him, the city was a 24-hour emergency room, an amphetamine drip. This show of 95 pictures gives a good sense of his range, and calls particular attention to his awareness of social problems related to class and race. 1114 Avenue of the Americas, at 43rd Street, (212) 857-0000.(Holland Cotter) * METropolitan museum of art: 'GIRODET: ROMANTIC REBEL,' through Aug. 27. Hugely famous in the early 19th century, Girodet dropped down the memory chute. His ''Ossian Receiving the Ghosts of French Heroes,'' painted for Napoleon, is one of the most deranged pictures in art history. It's so unhinged that it's almost lovable, which is otherwise the last word to come to mind for an artist who, in his uptight, smarty-pants mode, could be a bore. But give the show a shot. It's sometimes brilliant, and Girodet's strangeness and fairly repellent character make him at least fascinating to contemplate and heroic in his immoderation. (212) 535-7710.(Kimmelman) * Morgan Library and Museum: 'Masterworks from the Morgan,' through Sept. 10. Almost three years after closing to build an expansion, the Morgan is back and brilliant. What's new: Renzo Piano's splendid four-story glass-and-steel court, a sort of giant solarium with see-through elevators; two good-size second-floor galleries; and a neat little strongbox of an enclosure, called the Cube, for reliquaries and altar vessels, medieval objects made with so much silver and gold that they seem to give off heat. What's not new: almost everything in this exhibition, which fills every gallery with mini-exhibitions of master drawings and musical manuscripts, as well as illuminated gospels, devotional sculptures and historical and literary autograph manuscripts from the Brontes to Bob Dylan. 225 Madison Avenue, at East 36th Street, (212) 685-0008 or www.themorgan.org. (Individual show closings can be checked by telephone or through the Web site.) Cotter) Museum of Arts & Design: 'THE EAMES LOUNGE CHAIR: AN ICON OF MODERN DESIGN,' through Sept. 3 Celebrating the 50th anniversary of a chair whose combination of declarative modernist structure and sheer creature comfort was both innovative and a bit alien, this exhibition is a successful design object in its own right. It pays homage with drawings, advertising ephemera, precursors, vintage television clips, a wonderful documentary and three versions of the chair itself, enshrined, exploded and useable. 40 West 53rd Street, (212) 956-3535. (Smith) Museum of Modern Art: Douglas Gordon: 'Timeline,' through Sept 4. This selection of works by the artist known for appropriating and inventively manipulating Hollywood movies includes his projection of Alfred Hitchcock's ''Psycho,'' which runs so slowly that it takes 24 hours to complete, and a large-scale video installation that studies a circus elephant performing in an empty art gallery. Museum of Modern Art. (212) 708-9400. (Ken Johnson) National Academy: '181st Annual: an Invitational Exhibition of Contemporary Art' This year's sprawling hodgepodge of an invitational presents works by 124 artists ranging from tightly focused realist painting to politically charged video installation. National Academy, 1083 Fifth Avenue, at 89th Street, (212) 369-4880, through June 18. (Johnson) New York Public Library: 'FRENCH BOOK ART/LIVRES D'ARTISTES: ARTISTS AND POETS IN DIALOGUE,' through Aug. 18. Organized with the Bibliothèque Littéraire Jacques Doucet in Paris, this lavish exhibition surveys some of the experimental ferment brought on by the combination of free verse, visionary publishers and the high rate of talent among French artists and poets, especially in the early years of the 20th century. New York Public Library, Fifth Avenue at 42nd Street, (212) 869-8089. (Smith) NOGUCHI MUSEUM: 'BEST OF FRIENDS: BUCKMINSTER FULLER AND ISAMU NOGUCHI,' through Oct. 15. Great, lasting friendships are rare, but friendships that enlarge the spirit through ideas, ideals and new insights are in a class by themselves. Over a stretch of more than 50 years, the sculptor Isamu Noguchi and the visionary designer R. Buckminster Fuller enjoyed such a friendship, which led to aesthetic and practical achievements that left their mark. The course of their varied collaborations is traced in this exhibition, which includes models, sculptures, drawings, photographs and films. 9-01 33rd Road, between Vernon Boulevard and 10th Street, Long Island City, Queens, (718) 204-7088. (Glueck) * The Studio Museum In harlem: 'Energy/Experimentation: Black Artists and Abstraction, 1964-1980,' through July 2. During one of the most radical periods in 20th-century American politics, the Black Power era, a group of African-American artists was working in one of the most radical forms of 20th-century art: abstraction. This show is stylishly installed; (one gallery bursts with color, another has a cool platinum shimmer); the 15 artists are intensely individualistic and part of an important history. 144 West 125th Street, (212) 864-4500. (Cotter) Galleries: Uptown Peter Dayton: 'Surfboards by Clement Greenberg' For a witty spin on commodity-critique art, Mr. Dayton creates panel paintings combining the glossy surfaces, colorful banding and logos of surfboard design and the striped patterns of paintings by Kenneth Noland and Barnett Newman that were favored by the powerful formalist critic Clement Greenberg. Winston Wächter, 39 East 78th Street, (212) 327-2526, through June 24. (Johnson) * WANGECHI MUTU: EXHUMING GLUTTONY: A LOVER'S REQUIEM In tandem with this artist's Chelsea debut, an over-the-top installation made with the British architect David Adjaye includes fur-trimmed wine bottles dripping wine, animal skins and an enormous raw wood table. Conflating morgue, tannery and banquet hall, it brings the excess and color of this artist's paintings on Mylar into real space, but its main message seems to be: I built this because I can. Salon 94, 12 East 94th Street, (646) 672-9212, through July 7. (Smith) * Sarah Sze: 'Corner Plot' The upper corner of an apartment building protrudes from the Doris C. Freedman Plaza's pavement as if the whole edifice had toppled and sunk into the ground. Through the window's of Ms. Sze's magical outdoor sculpture you can see a complicated interior that looks as if it were created by a mad architect. Doris C. Freedman Plaza, 60th Street and Fifth Avenue, (212) 980-4575, through Oct. 29. (Johnson) Galleries: 57th Street 'Coup de Foudre' Four works loosely related by the metaphor of lightning. Emilie Halpern offers a white plastic lightning bolt and walls papered by heat-sensitive film. Small cutouts by Tim Noble & Sue Webster cast pornographic shadows; stick-on letters applied to the floor, walls and ceiling by Tamara Sussman spell out an erotic fantasy written in Web-based ''slash fiction'' style; and a surprisingly affecting, grainy, rambling video created by Enid Baxter Blader with a homemade camera explores stormy natural and emotional weather. Tina Kim, 41 West 57th Street, (212) 716-1100, through June 23. (Johnson) Galleries: SoHo * 'Artists Against the State: Perestroika Revisited' Satiric and subversive Pop and Conceptualist works by more than 50 artists working in the Soviet Union during the years leading up to the end of Communism. Ronald Feldman, 31 Mercer Street, (212) 226-3232, through June 24. (Johnson) Philippe Decrauzat: 'Plate 28' A conceptually perplexing but visually striking installation by a young Swiss artist includes a black and white grid painted on the walls; a sculpture based on a Russian Constructivist design; and a grainy, flickering black-and-white film showing glimpses of ominous landscapes from ''The Twilight Zone.'' Swiss Institute, 495 Broadway, at Broome Street, (212) 925-2035, through July 15. (Johnson) Jackie Gendel: 'Portraits' With seemingly off-hand painterly verve, smudgy colors and a sweet sense of humor, Ms. Gendel creates smart and sensuous, semi-abstract riffs on Modernist portraiture. Jeff Bailey, 511 West 25th Street, (212) 989-0156, through July 1. (Johnson) Galleries: Chelsea * 'An Ongoing Low-Grade Mystery' Organized by the curator Bob Nickas, this excellent group show includes works in many different mediums and styles, related in that they are all predominantly red. Donald Judd, Sherrie Levine, Jim Drain, Wolfgang Tillmans and Dan Walsh are among more than 30 artists included. Paula Cooper, 534 West 21st Street, (212) 255-1105, through June 23. (Johnson) * 'The Rest is Silence: James Lee Byars' New York only really started to wake up to James Lee Byars (1932-1997) when he died. Although born in the United States, he spent his formative years in Japan, where he developed a performance-based aesthetic of evanescance; and his main career was in Europe, where he adapted reductiveness to an art of material luxe. This three-gallery survey has some early work but focuses on the large-scale sculptures of his later years. It is tempting to fit him into existing slots: performance art, Minimalism, Conceptualism, whatever. But his extravagance and his privacy combine to keep him outside the fold, as do his his philosophical concerns: Big Ideas, or rather Big Questions, about perfection, death and eternity. Perry Rubenstein Gallery, 526 West 24th Street, (212) 627-8000; 534 West 24th Street and 527 West 23rd Street; Mary Boone Gallery, 541 West 24th Street and 745 Fifth Avenue, (212) 752-2929); Michael Werner, 4 East 77th Street, (212) 988-1623. All through June 24. (Cotter) Reto Boller A Swiss artist who has exhibited widely in Europe, Mr. Boller creates minimalist works in two and three dimensions that focus on color and texture. For his first exhibition in the United States, he has covered the walls and floor of a large section of this gallery with bright red adhesive material, to perceptually intense effect. James Nicholson, 547 West 27th Street, (212) 967-5700, through June 24. (Johnson) * Loretta Lux By means of subtle digital manipulations, Ms. Lux turns color photographs of children in empty rooms into hallucinatory portraits of angelic beings with slightly oversized heads; big, soulful eyes; and beautiful clothes. Yossi Milo, 525 West 25th Street, (212) 414-0370, through June 24. (Johnson) * NEW VIDEO, NEW EUROPE A selection of 49 tapes by 40 artists from 16 Eastern European countries, several of which did not exist before the collapse of the Soviet Union in 1989, presents bits and pieces of another world. Revolution, landmines, economic hardship and disappearing ways of life alternate with wit and artistic originality. The whole forms an inadvertent documentary, but many of the parts are well worth attention. The Kitchen, 512 East 19th Street, Chelsea, (212) 255-5793, through June 30. (Smith) RICHARD SERRA: 'ROLLED AND FORGED' The centerpiece of the latest Serra spectacular, which favors mass, compression and rectangles over stretched-thin curves and spirals, is a low-lying maze in which the shifting heights and staggered placement of 16 thick, hedgelike plates create one of the most spatially complex yet straightforward works of his career. Gagosian Gallery, 555 West 24th Street, (212) 741-1111, through Aug. 11. (Smith) Last Chance * Mamma Andersson: 'Rooms Under the Influence' In haunting paintings of rooms and landscapes, this Swedish painter combines the sensuousness of Edouard Vuillard and the moody angst of Edvard Munch. David Zwirner, 525 West 19th Street, Chelsea, (212) 727-2070; closing tomorrow. (Johnson) * MARCO BOGGIO SELLA: DREAMS AND NIGHTMARES OF THE AFRICAN ASTRONAUTS Combining a salon hanging with ethnographic displays, and works made by the artist in various collaborations with artisans of an impoverished village in Bukina Faso, this show opens a Pandora's box of artistic and ethical issues, and gives the viewer plenty to look at. John Connelly Presents, 625 West 27th Street, Chelsea, (212) 337-9523; closing tomorrow. (Smith) * JENNY HOLZER: ARCHIVE and NIGHT FEED Two exhibitions of new work present color photographs of poems projected on public buildings and silk-screen paintings that enlarge declassified, often heavily censored military and intelligence documents. The plight of the individual in an unforgiving (and in the second case, post-9/11) world is starkly evoked, but might be equally if not more effective in book form. Cheim & Read, 547 West 25th Street, Chelsea, (212) 242-7727, and Yvon Lambert New York, 564 West 25th Street, Chelsea, (212) 242-3611; closing tomorrow. (Smith) * WANGECHI MUTU: AN ALIEN EYE AND OTHER KILLAH ANTHEMS This gallery debut includes opulent collage and ink paintings on Mylar of exotic creatures, sculpture and fierce little collages combining ethnographic postcards with pornographic images. It indicates extravagant artistic gifts, passion and pressing subjects but also suggests that too many options are under consideration. Sikkema Jenkins & Company, 530 West 22nd Street, Chelsea, (212) 929-2262; closing tomorrow. (Smith) REGENERATION: 50 PHOTOGRAPHERS OF TOMORROW A show of emerging and student photographers gives a surprisingly energetic view of the medium as unavoidably surreal, frequently digitalized and extremely ambiguous, in which the divisions among real, manipulated and set-up are concerned. Current trends are confirmed. Relatively straight photojournalism tends to carry the day. Aperture Gallery, 547 West 27th Street, Chelsea, (212) 505-5555; closing on Thursday. (Smith) * THOMAS ZIPP: URANLICHT An impressive solo debut pairs dark, nearly abstract landscapes and cursory botanical imagery with appropriated images of authoritarian bearded men, evoking a bygone avant-garde and the reaction against it. A room-filling hand-built organ that Père Ubu might have loved completes the presentation. HarrisLieberman, 89 Vandam Street, South Village, (212) 206-1290; closing tomorrow. (Smith)"
2006-06-16T00:00:00Z,"After more than two years as director of the Newark Police Department, Anthony F. Ambrose III, left, announced yesterday that he would retire on June 30. Mr. Ambrose's retirement coincides with Mayor Sharpe James's last day in office. Mr. Ambrose, who joined the force in 1986, has led the 1,800-member department since April 2004. Sakina Cole, a spokeswoman for Mayor-elect Cory A. Booker, said that Mr. Booker would probably announce a successor by July 1, when he is sworn into office. JOHN HOLL (NYT)"
2006-06-16T00:00:00Z,"Thesaurus Paintings Peter Freeman Inc. 560 Broadway, at Prince Street, SoHo Through July 1 Drawings From Four Decades Werner H. Kramarsky 560 Broadway, at Prince Street, SoHo Through June 24 Since the early 1970's, the art of the Conceptualist Mel Bochner has been distinguished by an acute, somewhat perverse intelligence; a love of language and counting; elegant, energetic handwriting; and a strong allegiance to color. But it has also often been a bit aloof, cool to the touch. Not any more. The ''Thesaurus'' paintings that Mr. Bochner began making several years ago spiced up the 2004 Whitney Biennial and are now having their first solo presentation at Peter Freeman Inc. They hold their own in today's crowded word-painting field by heating his characteristic interests to a merry boil. Downstairs from Mr. Freeman's gallery, a beautiful 40-year retrospective of Mr. Bochner's drawings gives a good idea of where they come from. The last show at the exhibition space for works on paper that the dedicated collector Werner H. Kramarsky has maintained for more than a decade, it begins with a drawing from 1966 that neutrally lists the synonyms for the word ''opening'' in ink on yellow legal paper."

2006-06-16T00:00:00Z,"The mezzo-soprano Lorraine Hunt Lieberson, below, is canceling all performances for the rest of the year for ''personal reasons,'' starting with an appearance at Tanglewood on Aug. 11, the Boston Symphony Orchestra said. She was to have sung Handel arias with the orchestra under Harry Bicket. Ms. Lieberson's engagements this year only amounted to a handful, said Bill Palant, her representative at IMG Artists. Ms. Lieberson has canceled a number of performances in the past two seasons for health reasons. Mr. Palant said he was not authorized by the singer to elaborate on the recent round of cancellations. ''I don't want any inferences or implications to be made by anyone,'' he said. DANIEL J. WAKIN"
2006-06-16T00:00:00Z,"Diner's Guide presents excerpts from recent restaurant reviews. Dona Dona promisingly combines the talents of an ambitious chef (Michael Psilakis of Onera) and a shrewd restaurateur (Donatella Arpaia of David Burke & Donatella). He's Greek, she's Italian, and this pretty, pampering restaurant is a little of both and a lot of neither, vaulting past ethnic tags into the frillier realm of haute hodgepodge. The raw seafood compositions are terrific, while other dishes, including pasta, sometimes suffer from too much aspiration: an overload of effects. 208 East 52nd Street, Midtown, (212) 308-0830. Pasta dishes and entrees, $19 to $45. ** [Rating: Two Stars] Dressler Another sign that the dining scene in Williamsburg, Brooklyn, has grown up, Dressler isn't a proudly musty time capsule like Bamonte's nor a bastion of hipster irreverence. It's something with a more ecumenical appeal: a restaurant serving food that's sophisticated without being too clever in a room that's beautiful without being too flamboyant. The menu wears the label ''contemporary American,'' which means a little French, a little Italian and a lot of seasonal produce. 149 Broadway, at Bedford Avenue, Williamsburg, Brooklyn; (718) 384-6343. Entrees, $16 to $26. ** [Rating: Two Stars] Café d'Alsace With more than 110 pilsners and lagers and bocks, along with a designated beer sommelier to explain them all, Café d'Alsace is the newest paradise for beer lovers in New York. But what makes it even more special is that it could stand alone as a fetching brasserie with accomplished (although inconsistent) food, including first-rate sausages, a satisfying choucroute garnie, a warm potato salad like no other and terrific desserts. It's a sturdy restaurant, not just a gimmicky one, and won't be beer today and gone tomorrow. 1695 Second Avenue, at 88th Street, Manhattan; (212) 722-5133. Dinner entrees, $16.75 to $29.96. ** [Rating: Two Stars] Sascha Downstairs is a brasserie-style space that would clearly like to compete with the nearby Pastis. Upstairs is a quieter refuge with leather booths, tasseled lampshades and tablecloths. And uniting the two levels is the menu and cooking of Sascha Lyon, whose American and Continental standard-bearers seem to channel the spirit of a Midwestern hotel. It's an odd and uneventful restaurant, but an often enjoyable one, with a rack of lamb (upstairs) and double burger (downstairs) that prompt no complaints. 55 Gansevoort Street, at Ninth Avenue, meatpacking district; (212) 989-1920. Lunch and dinner entrees, $15 to $42. * [Rating: One Star] What the stars mean: (None) Poor to satisfactory; * Good; ** Very good; *** Excellent; **** Extraordinary."
2006-06-16T00:00:00Z,"A leading Democrat in the New York Congressional delegation yesterday criticized Thomas R. Suozzi, a Democratic candidate for governor, faulting his association with a wealthy Republican benefactor who opposes Democrats in Washington. The Congressional leader, Representative Charles B. Rangel, said that Mr. Suozzi should return the thousands of dollars he has received from the supporter, Kenneth G. Langone, a co-founder of Home Depot."

2006-06-16T00:00:00Z,"An obituary on Tuesday about William G. Hundley, a lawyer for many famous defendants, misidentified the location of the federal prison at which he joked there was a ''Hundley Wing'' for his convicted clients. It is in Allenwood, Pa., not Allentown."
2006-06-16T00:00:00Z,"Egyptian Group Fights Threats Against 'Da Vinci Code' A prominent Egyptian rights organization has condemned government threats to ban both the book and film versions of ''The Da Vinci Code.'' Expressing ''deep anxiety'' over calls by Parliament to bar the film, the Egyptian Organization for Human Rights said it ''believes that judging literary and creative works from a religious or political perspective threatens to impose religious or political tutelage over human thought.'' The group also deplored a promise to confiscate the Dan Brown novel that was made by the culture minister, Faruq Hosni, during a debate on Tuesday in Parliament, where he was summoned to answer questions about its circulation and reports of an imminent release of the film in Egypt. Led by Coptic Christians, Parliament members from across the political spectrum, including the Muslim Brothers, demanded that Mr. Hosni prevent release of the film and confiscate the ''blasphemous'' novel. The novel and film tell a murder mystery spun from the theory that the Roman Catholic Church covered up the marriage of Jesus to Mary Magdalene, the birth of their children and the continuation of their line. 'History Boys' Is Extended The run of ''The History Boys,'' below, winner of six Tony Awards including the prize for best play, has been extended for four weeks. Alan Bennett's story of the students and dueling educational philosophies at a British secondary school will continue through Oct. 1 at the Broadhurst Theater. Zoe Caldwell, winner of four Tony Awards, will return to the stage in January in a translated version of ''A Spanish Play'' by Yasmina Reza, the author of ''Art,'' at the Classic Stage Company on East 13th Street. John Turturro will direct, and the cast will include the Tony Award-winning Denis O'Hare (''Take Me Out'') and Linda Edmond. The company's season will begin in September with Shakespeare's ''Richard II,'' starring Michael Cumpsty. The Barrymore Theater on West 47th Street will become home this fall to the revival of ''Company'' that was staged by the Tony Award-winning director John Doyle (''Sweeney Todd'') and opened to favorable reviews in the spring in Cincinnati at the Playhouse in the Park. Glitter's Appeal Rejected A Vietnamese court yesterday rejected an appeal by Gary Glitter and upheld his three-year prison sentence for committing obscene acts with two girls, ages 10 and 11. The decision, including an order of deportation, was announced in Ho Chi Minh City after a closed one-day hearing, Reuters reported. The British glam rock singer, left, whose real name is Paul Francis Gadd, may petition the president of the Supreme Court for a review, a court official said. ''No justice here in Vietnam,'' Mr. Gadd, 62, screamed as he was escorted to a green van that returned him to prison in the southern resort town of Vung Tau, about 75 miles away. ''They did not listen to the defense at all.'' At a news briefing after the hearing, an official said the court had considered evidence from Cambodia that the singer molested children there, and his conviction in Britain for storing child pornography on his personal computer. Case of the Headless Plinth As the British artist David Hensel understood things, his sculpture ''One Day Closer to Paradise,'' depicting a very large laughing head, would be part of the summer exhibition at the Royal Academy of Art in London. But when Mr. Hensel, 64, attended a preview, all he saw on the plinth that was to display the heavy sculpture was the little piece of wood that was intended to support the head, the BBC reported. The Academy said the judges had assumed that the wood and the head were separate pieces, and they preferred the wood. In a statement, the academy said, ''It is accepted that works may not be displayed in the way the artist might have intended.'' The head is in storage, and the organizers of the show may reconsider. A Conductor's Comeback The Boston Symphony Orchestra has confirmed that James Levine, below, will return to the podium on July 7, leading a performance of Beethoven's Ninth Symphony and Schoenberg's Chamber Symphony No. 1 on opening night at Tanglewood. The program is the same as the one he conducted at Symphony Hall on Boston on March 1, when he fell and tore his rotator cuff while leaving the stage. Surgery and three months of recuperation followed. ''I'm thrilled to be back,'' Mr. Levine said in a statement. Footnote James Shapiro, the Larry Miller Professor of English and Comparative Literature at Columbia University, has won the Samuel Johnson Prize of $55,000 for his book ''1599: A Year in the Life of Shakespeare'' (HarperCollins). The prize is Britain's most valuable for nonfiction. Published in Britain by Faber & Faber, the book examines the year when Shakespeare turned 35 and wrote ''Henry V,'' ''As You Like it'' and the first draft of ''Hamlet.''"
2006-06-16T00:00:00Z,"A binge of acquisitions by Spanish companies and investor groups, as evidenced by BBVA's deal this week to buy Texas Regional Bancshares for $2.15 billion, is continuing. Spanish companies have bought $64.5 billion worth of companies outside the country this year, nearly matching the $64.9 billion in all of 2005."
