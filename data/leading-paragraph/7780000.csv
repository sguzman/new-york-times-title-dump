To the unsuspecting, Franklin was known to identify himself as a used canvas salesman. In actuality, he was widely admired for his expansive knowledge in the field of 19th and 20th-century American art and his passion for early 20th-century art in general, including British modernism, and many other related fields. He was especially proud of his expertise in the work of the artists George Bellows, Clarence Carter, Konrad Cramer, Adolph Dehn, Charles Goeller, Leon Kroll, Yasuo Kuniyoshi, Michael Lenson, Frank London, Edmund Lewandowski , Walter Murch, Priscilla Roberts, Harold Shapinsky and Hans Weingartner, along with many other artists of the early 20th-century, particularly those of the Woodstock Art colony. He was just as proud of his relationships with all who shared those interests. He also represented work of contemporary artists such as Leslie Gabosh, Walter Hatke, Robert Kipness, Simeon Lagodich, David Olenick, and Martin Weinstein. Franklin's prior lives included excelling as tight end/linebacker for the Pleasant Valley Vikings, induction into the Butte College Sports Hall of Fame as linebacker for the Butte College Roadrunners, a heavyweight wrestling champion, a painter of new canvases exhibited on both coasts, a student of art history at Hunter College, the Institute of Fine Arts and California State University at Chico, a scholar of ancient Greek vase painting, a salesman of LeRoy Nieman prints at Knoedler Publishing, Inc., a slide curator at the Metropolitan Museum of Art, where he was also a lecturer, a paintings expert at Phillips, Son & Neale, Inc. in New York, an associate at H.V. Allison Galleries, a business partner of Andrea Scully-Keogh and of Megan Moynihan, a published author of art historical catalogues and essays, a bridge player and a golf addict. He preferred research at the Frick Art Library to the internet and loved books. He was born in Safford, AZ and raised in Utah, Nevada, Santa Barbara, the California Bay Area, and Chico, CA, which he left for New York City in 1977. He is survived by his partner and lover of 30 years, Mary M. Walsh, of New York City, his mother Margaret Whitaker Riehlman, his siblings Mark (Liz), Troy (Mary Ann), Ann (Pat) Patterson and Donald, his uncle, Charles Whitaker, nieces and nephews and many, many friends and colleagues. All of whom are heartbroken and will cherish his memory. He was preceded in death by his father Peter and his nephew Josh.

A generous group of colleagues, friends and admirers are holding a memorial service to celebrate his life and compare tales on May 22 at the Lotos Club on 66th and 5th in Manhattan.

He attended Ohio State University on the GI Bill and was editor of The Sundial, following in the footsteps of idol James Thurber.

He was the Art Director of Silver Burdett for 19 years and revolutionized the design of children's schoolbooks, using innovative artists, photographers and craftsmen.

Eight months earlier, she joyfully celebrated her 90th birthday in the presence of her children, grandchildren and great-grandchildren, along with other family and friends. Born Anita Claire Alpern, she was sometimes known as A-Claire or acorn to her childhood friends. She was the daughter of Milton Alpern and Henrietta Nathanson Alpern, and grew up in Brooklyn. She graduated from James Madison High School and Adelphi College, but of all her educational experience she valued most her primary school years at Ethical Culture School in Brooklyn. While in college, her sorority sister and best friend, Lucille Stein, introduced Claire to Lucille's brother Howard. Claire and Howard were married less than a year later, and remained the loves of each other's lives for 63 years, until Howard's death in 2006. They were separated from one another only during World War II, when Howard served in the army in Europe, while Claire stayed on the home front, pregnant with their first child, Brad. As a young wife and mother, Claire studied sculpture with Robert Cronbach and at the Art Students' League. She was a sculptor working in wood carving, plaster modeling for casting, and ultimately, direct metal welding. She was proud to have been praised by a plumber for the quality of her ""bead"" or weld joint. From 1967 to 1987 she was Executive Director of the National Sculpture Society. She learned the art of making hooked rugs, and enjoyed making pictorial rugs that touched on aspects of family life, notably including the family country home at Copake, New York. For all her interest in art and all her artist friends, her family was always the most important to her. She was a great listener and reader. She rejoiced at the arrival of grandchildren and then great-grandchildren, and loved looking for birthday presents for them all. Her sister Marilyn Alpern Gorlin and brother Buddy Alpern pre-deceased her. She is survived by her brother Nubby Alpern, her sisters-in-law Lucille Stein Kantor and Mildred Alpern, her son Bradford Stein and daughter-in-law Mary Grace Stein, and her daughter Wendy A. Stein and son-in-law Bart Friedman. She is also survived by grandchildren, Elizabeth Ruark, Zachary Stein, Alexander Stein, Benjamin Alpern Friedman and Jacob Stein Friedman, as well as great-grandchildren Isabel Stein, Siena Ruark, Thalia Ruark and Henry Stein.

Pizzoli (“The Watermelon Seed”) brings his dashing screen-print style to the story of Sam, a dog with lovely manners — so long as he’s winning. In a typical race, Sam drives his little red racecar across the finish line under a shower of candy-button confetti. But when Maggie the elephant comes in first, Sam has to learn the art of losing. The story is familiar, but Pizzoli’s zingy ice-pop colors and dramatically varied page compositions take home the blue ribbon."

2014-05-11T00:00:00Z,"SICA--Carmen. Skilled professional, comic genius, extravagant hostess, loyal friend, and great soul, Carmen Sica left this world on April 21, 2014 after a long illness. Born in Brooklyn on October 26, 1948, daughter of Antonio and Encarna Soler, she began what would be the professional work of her life in 1966, at the age of 18, in the steno pool of Davis Polk & Wardwell. She went on to become a Davis Polk legend, and a beloved and admired figure to a generation of Davis Polk lawyers and staff. Spectacularly competent, supremely intelligent, rigorously organized, and beautifully trained, Carmen was an old fashioned (in the best sense possible) legal secretary. We shall not look upon her like again. Apart from the lightning speed of her fingers, and her indefatigable energy long into the night as deadlines loomed, Carmen understood and contributed to the cases she worked on. Woe to the senior partner who fell in love with a weak argument--""Doesn't your balloon ever land?"" She spoke truth to power in the funniest possible way, but her actual point was to assist with the case. She was a consummate professional with a twinkle in her eye and a heart much softer than she liked to acknowledge. Her razor wit, her keen eye for the absurd, and her sometimes scathing (but always hilarious) commentary were reserved for the people she liked and admired. Her good heart never made public fun of those less intellectually fortunate than herself. Having left Davis Polk in 1993 with her good friend Ann McDonald (a move for which Ann was eternally grateful), Carmen continued her amazing legal work at Robinson McDonald & Canna. In addition to her day job at that firm, Carmen was Ann's keeper for the next 20 years. To Ann, as to so many many others, Carmen was a devoted and loyal friend and was generous to a fault. To all her friends, Carmen was also the hostess with the mostest! Summers at Carmen's house in East Atlantic Beach were a festival of food, drink, swimming, many friends and, most of all, merriment and laughter--side splitting laughter because Carmen's comic wit was on a world class level. This was a funny lady! And she was a kind and generous and wise lady too. She had a host of friends that loved her and that she loved, and those relationships took and stuck and lasted long. Carmen is survived by her family in Spain, Maria Elena, Juan Antonio and others, by her brother, Raymond Gil, and by her nephew and niece, Ray and Mercedes Gil. She is also survived by the love of troops of friends and family, including Natalie and Matt, Laura and Michael, Camille and David, Mary R., Christine and Anthony, Mary and Andy, Mark, Bernard, Fritzie, Billy, Amy, Ann, Jayne, Christine C., Lisa, Liz and many many more. She had a big and loving heart, and everyone who knew her adored her and will miss her. ""There's a great spirit gone!"" William Shakespeare."

2014-05-13T00:00:00Z,"BENNETT--Robert S.,Jr., 78, of Princeton, NJ, died on May 9, 2014 after a valiant four year battle against pancreatic cancer. Beloved husband and father, he is survived by his wife of 49 years, Bobbie G. Bennett, and his daughter, Laura Bennett. Born and raised in Bethlehem, PA, he was pre-deceased by his parents, Alene Grace and Robert S. Bennett. He is also survived by his aunt, Dodie Massey Henry, and his two sisters, Deborah Moore and Cynthia Squire, in addition to many cousins, nephews, and nieces. Bob graduated from Deerfield Academy in 1954 and earned a B.A. in Architecture from Princeton University in 1958. After completing O.C.S. in Newport, RI, he served for four years as an ensign in the Navy's Civil Engineer Corps. Following work in New York for Clark and Rapuano, a large city planning and landscape architecture firm, as well as time spent in commercial real estate development with the Uris Corporation, he opened his own residential architecture firm in Pennington, NJ in 1975. His houses and gardens can be seen in the Northeast and Florida. His passion for what he did was infectious; his houses, rooted in the Classical tradition, a lasting testament to that passion. He leaves a legacy of hard work, loyalty, stimulating conversation and love of family, fun, and country. Ever humble and an optimist, he will be greatly missed. A funeral service will be held at The Presbyterian Church of Lawrenceville on May 16 at 11am. For those who wish, contributions may be made to Deerfield Academy, the Princeton Area Community Foundation, or The Pancreas Center, Columbia University, in honor of Dr. Stephen Schreibman. Services are being handled by Mather-Hodge Funeral Home."

2014-05-13T00:00:00Z,"CARLTON--Richard, died peacefully at home on May 10, 2014. He was the beloved husband of Blossom, father of Joyce, Ralph, Ken and Karen, and grandfather of Mark, Sara, Annie, Jane, Ben, Matthew, Harry and Emma. He was predeceased by his sister, Florence Morris. Born on February 9, 1919 in Manhattan, he attended Townsend Harris High School, graduating at the age of 16. His first job was at Columbia Pictures, after which he served honorably in World War II. After the war, he had a long and distinguished career in film and television.

He was later deputy director of the American Film Institute and, finally, executive director of the International Council of the National Academy of Television Arts and Sciences, where he led the production of the International Emmy Awards. Although he retired from his business career at 75, he lived every day purposefully, engaged in more things than he had time to do, including traveling, visiting family, writing, and playing tennis competitively until he hung up his racket at 90. Determined to stay current with technology, he created a blog offering his unique viewpoints on life to a large and loyal following which he maintained until shortly before his passing at the age of 95. A memorial service will be held on Thursday, May 15 at 10am at Ballard-Durand Funeral Home, 2 Maple Avenue, White Plains, NY.

He was also a tennis player, a sailor, an artist in wood sculpting and stained glass; and a craftsman par excellence. He designed and crafted (amongst many projects) a beautiful classical guitar and he built a precise grandfather clock completely out of wood, cutting each gear by hand - and it ran perfectly! While he was not a talker, he had a strong voice when it came to social injustice. He and his wife Gertrude openly demonstrated their convictions during the civil rights movement of the 1960s, and in the 1970s their group the Fair Lawn Committee for Peace in Vietnam organized efforts to end that war. They were even out on the picket line in their 90s to protest United States intervention in Iraq. He shared 69 years with our Mom, the love of his life. Our Dad could do anything. We love him dearly.

Born in the Bronx in 1930, Morty Herman grew up in the Bronx and in Brooklyn. His beloved maternal grandfather, Josef Klapholz, who lived with the family, was a tailor; his father, Al Herman, owned a hardware store in Brighton Beach, Brooklyn. It was in Brighton Beach, at seventeen, that Morty met the great love of his life, fourteen-year-old Sheila Weiss. Famous for his enthusiasms -- friendship, travel, good food, a good story, a good book, and the songs of Al Jolson; print, radio, and television journalism; and (perhaps most of all) a good conversation -- as well for as his restless determination to keep busy, right up to the end, Mort Herman in the seventies and eighties owned a pension-consulting business; in the nineties, he took up the management of a commercial real estate company, a business he would run skillfully, energetically, and with great pleasure until the time of his death. He was also well known for his abundant generosity and the genuine interest he took in others and their interests and goals. He was a tireless supporter of his children's and grandchildren's enthusiasms, talents, educations, and careers, and a mentor and friend to many. He made and kept new friends effortlessly and constantly, and even in his final weeks he was offering advice and telling stories to an army of young people -- aspiring dancers, actors, comedy writers, journalists -- who came to sit with him in the hospital. He is survived by his lifelong love, his wife of sixty-two years, Sheila Herman; his daughter, Michelle Herman, and her husband, Glen Holland; his son, Scott Herman, and his wife, Beth Amey Herman; his granddaughters Grace Herman-Holland and Jamie Lynn Lescher; his grandsons Sean Herman and Greg Herman; two grandchildren-in-law, TJ Lescher and Naomi Herman; two great-grandchildren, Kai Lescher and Skylar Herman; and two brothers, Barry Herman and Mark Herman, and their families. The funeral will be held on Tuesday, May 20, 2014 at 11:30am at Menorah Chapels at Millburn, 2950 Vauxhall Road, Vauxhall, NJ 07088 (908-964-1500).

2014-05-16T00:00:00Z,"STUART--Robert D.,Jr. Robert D. Stuart, Jr. former Ambassador to Norway, long time chief executive of the Quaker Oats Company, and a leader in civic and business affairs for more than 60 years, died on May 8, 2014 en route from France to the United States with his beloved wife Lillan. He was 98. Whether business, politics, or philanthropy, Ambassador Stuart's consistent ambition was to live up to the title of his privately published memoirs: Making a Difference. By all accounts, he did. As a young law student at Yale in 1940, Stuart joined with a group of classmates, including Gerald Ford, Potter Stewart and Kingman Brewster--a future U.S. President, Supreme Court Justice and Yale College president--to found the America First Committee, a grass roots organization dedicated to keeping America out of the developing European conflict. At its peak, America First had as many as 800,000 members. After his discharge from the Army in 1946 with the rank of Major, he returned to law school at Yale. Upon graduation, he joined the Quaker Oats Company, co-founded by his grandfather Robert Stuart and led at the time by his father R. Douglas Stuart and uncle John Stuart. He spent 38 years at Quaker, the last 15 as chief executive, and during his tenure pushed to diversify the company and to expand its international presence. Two themes animated his leadership: a belief in the power of strong brands and the certainty that corporations like Quaker had a duty both to their shareholders and to the communities in which they lived and operated. From the time he became president in 1962 to his stepping down in 1984 to join the diplomatic corps, sales grew from $365 million to more than $3 billion. As Ronald Regan's ambassador to Norway from 1984 to 1989, Amb. Stuart followed in the tradition of his father, who was the American ambassador to Canada in the mid-1950s. The younger Stuart served in the waning years of the Cold War, when Norway's location north of the Barents Sea and its proximity to the former Soviet Union was of great strategic relevance both to the United States and to NATO. He fell in love with Norway, as did his wife Barbara. The feeling was apparently mutual, as the Norwegian press termed Ambassador Stuart ""en flink gutt""--a good guy. Upon his return from Norway, he was nominated for the Defense Base Case Closure and Realignment Commission by President George H.W. Bush in 1991 and then President Bill Clinton in 1993. Robert D. Stuart, Jr. was born in 1916 in Hubbard Woods, Illinois and grew up in Lake Forest. He graduated from the Los Alamos Ranch School in New Mexico and then Princeton University in 1937, where he earned a degree in politics. In 1938, he married the former Barbara Edwards from Syracuse, NY. They had five children, three of whom survive him. His wife died in 1993, and two years later, he married Lillan Lovenskiold, a Norwegian whom he had met during his time as ambassador, who along with her late husband, had been close friends. She was the second great love of his life. For many years, he was a trustee of Princeton University. He also served as a director of United Airlines, the Burlington Northern Railroad, the First National Bank of Chicago Deere and Company, and Molson Companies, Ltd. of Canada. A life long Republican, he served as National Committeeman from Illinois and Finance Chair in Illinois for the Reagan campaign, among many assignments. In 1962, he founded the Lake County Republican Federation, reflecting his long-standing belief in the importance of local politics. As his political and business interests wound down, Amb. Stuart focused on philanthropy, founding a family foundation that supported civic education, campaign finance reform and national security. Ambassador Stuart was pre-deceased in death by sons Huntingdon Douglas Stuart and R. Douglas Stuart III. He is survived by his wife Lillan, sister Margaret, his son James M. Stuart and wife Dianne, daughter Marian S. Pillsbury, son Alexander D. Stuart and wife Robin, daughter-in-law Nancy M. Stuart, eight grandchildren--Pamela Stuart, Donaldson Pillsbury, Jr., Blair Pillsbury Enders, Wendy Pillsbury Eichmann, Christopher Stuart, Ann Robinson Stuart, and Robert Douglas Stuart IV--as well as six great-grandchildren: Clark and Annika Pillsbury, Nicholas and Marian Enders, and Tyler and Sam Eichmann. Ambassador Stuart also had numerous Norwegian step-children, grandchildren and great-grandchildren. He adored them all, on both sides of the Atlantic Ocean. And they adored him. A memorial service will be held at 3:00pm on Saturday, May 17th at the First Presbyterian Church of Lake Forest. In lieu of flowers, contributions may be made to the Gorton Community Center in Lake Forest or Princeton University."

2014-05-16T00:00:00Z,"PINCUS--William, Passed away May 15, 2014 at age 94 and in the 74th year of his marriage to Elsa. William was the loving husband of Elsa, devoted father of Susan Rachel and Jillian Pincus and the late Lanni Tama, loving grandfather of Jordan Tama, and adoring great-grandfather of Amos and Jesse Tama and their mother Julia Tama, dedicated brother of the late Beatrice Levine, and admired uncle to his nieces and nephews. As a dedicated family man in good and bad times, he never missed a family rite of passage. He always ""took care of everything"" whenever needed. William had a big presence in life matched only by his love of life. He enjoyed traveling the world, investigating new cultures, and collecting art and cultural objects. Before any travel, he would read about the culture and area to be visited, often serving as his own travel guide. Fine food and wine were something to be savored. He loved theater, art, dancing, swimming (especially in the ocean), and knowledge in general. These loves were passed on to his appreciative family. William had the wonderful experience of seeing the natural beauty of the United States in the early 1950s as part of his work in the National Park Service; he wanted to share this experience with his family. Especially remembered are the two resulting cross-USA driving trips in 1953 and 1959 with his wife and three daughters to visit the National Parks -- quite a challenge back then. William was born on April 29, 1920 in Philadelphia and received a B.A. in Government from Brooklyn College (1940), an M.A. in Public Administration from American University (1948), and a J.D. from George Washington University (1953). William worked for the Federal Government from 1941 to 1957. His appointments there included advisory and managerial positions in the War Department (Lend Lease Depot), Bureau of the Budget, Bureau of Land Management, First and Second Hoover Commissions, and the U.S. Congress. Some of his government work resulted in major reorganization of government agencies. From 1957 to 1968, William worked in the government and law division of the Ford Foundation, responsible for making grants for new directions in legal education and for research to improve the administration of justice. His most lasting work as President of the Council on Legal Education for Professional Responsibility (CLEPR) started in 1968, CLEPR was responsible for reforms in the system of legal education by starting the clinical movement in law school curriculums and providing law students with real-life professional responsibilities and exposure to the people-oriented aspect of the legal profession. Creative and pioneering CLEPR projects resulted in clinical programs existing in almost every U.S. law school and internationally. In his lifetime, William worked tirelessly to establish clinical legal education as an Important part of legal studies and as an especially effective means for teaching professional responsibility. Administration of clinical justice and the attainment of the ideal of equal justice under the law were of paramount importance to him. William's dedication to Justice and clinical education were recognized by many legal organizations. He was the recipient of the President's Medal from The Catholic University of America for his pioneering work in clinical legal education and he received an honorary doctorate of laws from Georgetown in Washington, DC. The Association of American Law Schools (AALS) clinical section yearly bestows The William Pincus Award in his honor to one or more Individuals or institutions that have effected outstanding contributions to the cause of clinical legal education. William is missed by his loving family. Services: Sunday, May 18, 2014 at 1pm at Riverside Nassau North Chapels, 55 North Station Plaza, (opposite LIRR), Great Neck, NY."

2014-05-17T00:00:00Z,"STUART--Robert D.,Jr. Robert D. Stuart, Jr. former Ambassador to Norway, long time chief executive of the Quaker Oats Company, and a leader in civic and business affairs for more than 60 years, died on May 8, 2014 en route from France to the United States with his beloved wife Lillan. He was 98. Whether business, politics, or philanthropy, Ambassador Stuart's consistent ambition was to live up to the title of his privately published memoirs: Making a Difference. By all accounts, he did. As a young law student at Yale in 1940, Stuart joined with a group of classmates, including Gerald Ford, Potter Stewart and Kingman Brewster--a future U.S. President, Supreme Court Justice and Yale College president--to found the America First Committee, a grass roots organization dedicated to keeping America out of the developing European conflict. At its peak, America First had as many as 800,000 members. After his discharge from the Army in 1946 with the rank of Major, he returned to law school at Yale. Upon graduation, he joined the Quaker Oats Company, co-founded by his grandfather Robert Stuart and led at the time by his father R. Douglas Stuart and uncle John Stuart. He spent 38 years at Quaker, the last 15 as chief executive, and during his tenure pushed to diversify the company and to expand its international presence. Two themes animated his leadership: a belief in the power of strong brands and the certainty that corporations like Quaker had a duty both to their shareholders and to the communities in which they lived and operated. From the time he became president in 1962 to his stepping down in 1984 to join the diplomatic corps, sales grew from $365 million to more than $3 billion. As Ronald Regan's ambassador to Norway from 1984 to 1989, Amb. Stuart followed in the tradition of his father, who was the American ambassador to Canada in the mid-1950s. The younger Stuart served in the waning years of the Cold War, when Norway's location north of the Barents Sea and its proximity to the former Soviet Union was of great strategic relevance both to the United States and to NATO. He fell in love with Norway, as did his wife Barbara. The feeling was apparently mutual, as the Norwegian press termed Ambassador Stuart ""en flink gutt""--a good guy. Upon his return from Norway, he was nominated for the Defense Base Case Closure and Realignment Commission by President George H.W. Bush in 1991 and then President Bill Clinton in 1993. Robert D. Stuart, Jr. was born in 1916 in Hubbard Woods, Illinois and grew up in Lake Forest. He graduated from the Los Alamos Ranch School in New Mexico and then Princeton University in 1937, where he earned a degree in politics. In 1938, he married the former Barbara Edwards from Syracuse, NY. They had five children, three of whom survive him. His wife died in 1993, and two years later, he married Lillan Lovenskiold, a Norwegian whom he had met during his time as ambassador, who along with her late husband, had been close friends. She was the second great love of his life. For many years, he was a trustee of Princeton University. He also served as a director of United Airlines, the Burlington Northern Railroad, the First National Bank of Chicago Deere and Company, and Molson Companies, Ltd. of Canada. A life long Republican, he served as National Committeeman from Illinois and Finance Chair in Illinois for the Reagan campaign, among many assignments. In 1962, he founded the Lake County Republican Federation, reflecting his long-standing belief in the importance of local politics. As his political and business interests wound down, Amb. Stuart focused on philanthropy, founding a family foundation that supported civic education, campaign finance reform and national security. Ambassador Stuart was pre-deceased in death by sons Huntingdon Douglas Stuart and R. Douglas Stuart III. He is survived by his wife Lillan, sister Margaret, his son James M. Stuart and wife Dianne, daughter Marian S. Pillsbury, son Alexander D. Stuart and wife Robin, daughter-in-law Nancy M. Stuart, eight grandchildren--Pamela Stuart, Donaldson Pillsbury, Jr., Blair Pillsbury Enders, Wendy Pillsbury Eichmann, Christopher Stuart, Ann Robinson Stuart, and Robert Douglas Stuart IV--as well as six great-grandchildren: Clark and Annika Pillsbury, Nicholas and Marian Enders, and Tyler and Sam Eichmann. Ambassador Stuart also had numerous Norwegian step-children, grandchildren and great-grandchildren. He adored them all, on both sides of the Atlantic Ocean. And they adored him. A memorial service will be held at 3:00pm on Saturday, May 17th at the First Presbyterian Church of Lake Forest. In lieu of flowers, contributions may be made to the Gorton Community Center in Lake Forest or Princeton University."

2014-05-18T00:00:00Z,"WOODS--Frank Montgomery Jr.,Frank Montgomery Woods, Jr., engaged life with enthusiasm. He was an active member of the Bohemian Club, The Pacific-Union Club, the California Tennis Club, the Guardsmen and San Francisco Golf Club. Frank was a passionate bridge player and a student of the game. Frank's life began 81 years ago, in Chattanooga, Tennessee, the eldest son of Josephine Roberts Woods and Frank Montgomery Woods. He spent his childhood in Birmingham, Alabama, and Nashville, Tennessee, then earned his bachelor's degree from Cornell University ('50-'54), in the School of Hotel Administration. He was a member of the Sigma Phi fraternity. Following graduation, Frank served in Korea. He was a U.S. Army Second Lieutenant in charge of a quartermaster depot. In 1956, Frank joined the advertising and marketing department of Proctor & Gamble in Cincinnati, Ohio. After five years at P&G, Frank moved to the Bay Area to launch his own company, Marketing Continental. An entrepreneur at heart, Frank's company was instrumental in developing and introducing products such as the Pine Mountain Log and the Shell No-Pest Strip. In the late 1960s, Frank, together with Cornell classmate Tom Reed, helped to develop the Four Seasons Ski Resort in Breckenridge, Colorado. In 1961, Frank met Kay Harrigan and they married in Mobile, Alabama, a year later. They lived in San Francisco and Healdsburg, and raised three children: Dorine Woods Towle (Griff), Frank Montgomery Woods (Anne Robinson) and Alexis Woods (Daniel Donahoe). They have six grandchildren: Spencer and Audrey Towle, Thea and Keira Donahoe, Ella and Montgomery Woods. Frank is survived by his brother, Bill Woods (Deborah Freedman), and his sister, Rhoda Reyner. His brother, Joseph Woods, predeceased him. In the early 1970s, Frank began his notable career in the wine business, co-founding the award-winning Clos du Bois winery in Sonoma County. From the beginning, Clos du Bois wines were designed to be as consumer friendly as an American wine and as elegant as a French wine, a combination that was unheard of at the time. Frank's marketing skills were innovative for the wine business and he quickly built Clos du Bois into a premium California wine. Frank was a tremendous advocate for the American wine industry. Over the years Frank was chairman of the Wine Institute, chairman of the American participation in the International Organization of Viticulturalists (OIV), and was on the boards of the Fine Arts Museums of San Francisco, the Young Audiences of San Francisco, and the L.S.B. Leakey Foundation. In addition, he was a consultant to the wine industries in Bulgaria, Slovenia and Hungary under an agricultural project of the United States government. Frank also represented the US in various international wine negotiations with NAFTA and dealings with GATT in Geneva. Frank Woods passed away on Thursday, May 8, in San Francisco. There will be a memorial service for Frank on Monday, May 19 at 3:00pm at Grace Cathedral.

2014-05-18T00:00:00Z,"WINTHROP--Beekman, 73, of Luray, SC, Washington, DC and North Haven, ME died on May 6, 2014 at his Washington, DC home of complications of metastatic kidney cancer. Born in Boston, the son of Serita Bartlett and Nathaniel Thayer Winthrop, Beekman was an 11th generation direct descendant of the first Massachusetts Bay Colony Governor, John Winthrop, and his namesake, a great uncle, was the first governor of Puerto Rico. He attended The Hill School in Pottstown, PA and went on to receive a BA from Columbia University and an MS in Urban Planning from Columbia School of Architecture. After a brief enrollment in the Harvard Divinity School, he left to pursue writing, inspired by the work of Robert Coles on race relations in the south. In 1971 he won the Robert F. Kennedy Journalism Award for Outstanding Coverage of the Problems of Poverty and Discrimination for a New South magazine article on intestinal parasites in poor black children on the developing resort island of Hilton Head. In 1972, concerned community members brought to his attention the murder of an 18-year-old black youth in a town near his family's South Carolina property. Beekman's persistence and partnership with the press to expose the injustice ultimately led to the indictment of two white men. His involvement was later highly fictionalized in a reporter's book and movie. Beekman went on to form a small investment advisory firm where he worked as a manager and trustee until his retirement, after which he continued work as a private investor. Beekman lived in Washington for 42 years following his 1969 marriage to Phoebe Jane Wood of Boulder, CO who survives him. Also surviving him are his son, Dudley (Jennifer) of Washington, DC, and two granddaughters, Kay Taylor and Serafina. He is also survived by three brothers, John (Elizabeth) of Charleston, SC, Nathaniel (Martha) of Montpelier, VT and Stephen (Jane Williamson) of Wayland, MA, and three sisters, Serita of Rhinebeck, NY and Lake Wales FL, Katharine of Bernardsville, NJ and Cornelia of New York City. Both of his parents and one brother, Matthew of Boston MA, predeceased him. A memorial service will be held June 13 at 11:30am at St. Alban's Church, 3100 Wisconsin Ave NW, Washington, DC. Services in Maine and South Carolina will follow later. In lieu of flowers, please make donations in his name to North Haven Conservation Partners, PO Box 336, North Haven, ME 04853 or the charity of your choice."

He and his wife Gertrude openly demonstrated their convictions during the civil rights movement of the 1960s, and in the 1970s their group the Fair Lawn Committee for Peace in Vietnam organized efforts to end that war. They were even out on the picket line in their 90s to protest United States intervention in Iraq. He shared 69 years with our Mom, the love of his life. Our Dad could do anything. We love him dearly.

2014-05-18T00:00:00Z,"MacDONALD--Robert Ian, Robert Ian MacDonald, died quietly in Nassau, the Bahamas on May 12th. He left this world as he lived in it, with elegance, courage and humility. Born in 1928 in London to a life less ordinary, he had deep roots in England, America and Scotland. In addition to the Bahamas, he maintained residences in New York, London and Devon for more than eighty years. His paternal great-grandfather, George MacDonald, was the Victorian poet and author whose book, ""The Light Princess"", was recently turned into a successful musical at the National Theatre in London. His maternal great grandfather was Charles Pratt of Brooklyn, a partner in Standard Oil who also founded the Pratt Institute. His mother, Helen Babbott MacDonald and his father, Ian MacDonald, both served the cause of freedom during the Second World War in England. His father returned to the Army and was stationed in Churchill's London map room. Helen MacDonald was head of the Red Cross and Army Officer's Club in Salcombe while the allies prepared for the Normandy invasion on the beaches near Gullet, the family farm in Devon. During the war years, Robert was evacuated to America where he attended the Pomfret School and spent four happy years with his American cousins in Bernardsville, New Jersey. With the surrender of the Germans in 1945, he left school and returned to Britain with other evacuees on a Royal Navy battleship. He attended Millfield School in Somerset, England to prepare for the Royal Marines' exam and was granted his commission by King George VI. Following service to King and Country, he became the first trainee for the Mobil Oil Corporation in England. Later, he worked for Lloyds in the City of London and managed the family farm in Devon. As a lifelong dairy farmer, he especially prized his pedigree herd of Ayrshire cows. In later years, he would became the head of his family's New York based foundation. He was particularly interested in trans-Atlantic education, animal rights and conservation. He credited his good friend, Hoyle Jones (retired Chairman of the ASPCA), for persuading him to give up blood sports. ""One is never too old to learn"", he remarked at the time. Robert was never happier than in the company of his five grandsons (Jonathan MacDonald, Michael MacDonald, David MacDonald, Luke Harris (Emily) and Peter Harris) who succeed him, together with his son, Ian MacDonald (Cheryl) and daughter, Zara Harris, (Dan).

2014-05-18T00:00:00Z,"KENNEDY--Hon. Cornelia Groefsema, of Grosse Pointe Woods, Michigan passed away on May 12, 2014. She died peacefully at home surrounded by her family. Judge Kennedy was born in Detroit on August 4, 1923. She earned a Bachelor of Arts from the University of Michigan; and, like her father, mother, and older sister, she attended the University of Michigan Law School, graduating in 1947. She subsequently clerked for the Honorable Harold W. Stephens, Chief Judge of the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit. She was the first woman to clerk for that court, which is considered second only to the Supreme Court of the United States. After 20 years in private practice in Detroit, she was elected to the Wayne County (Michigan) Circuit Court. In 1970 President Richard M. Nixon appointed her to the United States District Court for the Eastern District of Michigan. She was the first woman to sit on that court, and in 1977 she became the first female chief judge of a federal district court in the United States. She was elevated to the United States Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit by President Jimmy Carter in 1979. She was the second woman to sit on that court, and she held that position until her retirement on June 30, 2012. At the time of her appointment, Judge Kennedy was jokingly given the hot plate on which the first female judge of the Sixth Circuit, the Honorable Florence E. Allen, had warmed her lunch. Judge Allen's fellow judges had belonged to an all male private club that did not admit women, thus precluding their female peer from eating with them. Judge Kennedy was eventually admitted as the first female member of that club although the maitre d' initially refused to seat her because he was unaware of the change in club policy and her subsequent membership. Judge Kennedy and her sister, the Honorable Margaret G. Schaeffer, were the first sister judges in the United States. Judge Schaeffer sat on the 47th District Court in Farmington Hills, Michigan from 1974 1992. Judge Kennedy was an avid traveler, visiting all seven continents, more than 80 countries, and 49 states. After her husband had died, she enjoyed traveling with her two sisters on University of Michigan tours with their husbands and on week-end getaways with their adult daughters. The granddaughter of Dutch immigrant farmers in Idaho, Judge Kennedy spent her week-ends gardening. She was also a passionate reader, especially enjoying historical non-fiction and British mysteries. Judge Kennedy was pre-deceased by her husband, Charles S. Kennedy, Jr.; her parents, Elmer H. and M. Blanche Gibbons Groefsema; and her sisters, Ann Jean Groefsema and Margaret G. Schaeffer. Judge Kennedy is survived by her son and daughter-in-law, Charles S. and Angela Kennedy; her grandchildren, Elizabeth and Matthew; her sister, Dr. Christine G. Gram; and 28 nieces and nephews. Judge Kennedy was devoted to them all, and she will be remembered lovingly. A memorial service will be held on Friday, June 27, 2014 at 11:00am at Grosse Pointe Congregational Church. A luncheon will follow. In lieu of flowers, memorial contributions may be sent to The Honorable Cornelia G. Kennedy Scholarship, c/o Alexandra Haddad, University of Michigan Law School, 701 S.

2014-05-18T00:00:00Z,"PINCUS--William, Passed away May 15, 2014 at age 94 and in the 74th year of his marriage to Elsa. William was the loving husband of Elsa, devoted father of Susan Rachel and Jillian Pincus and the late Lanni Tama, loving grandfather of Jordan Tama, and adoring great-grandfather of Amos and Jesse Tama and their mother Julia Tama, dedicated brother of the late Beatrice Levine, and admired uncle to his nieces and nephews. As a dedicated family man in good and bad times, he never missed a family rite of passage. He always ""took care of everything"" whenever needed. William had a big presence in life matched only by his love of life. He enjoyed traveling the world, investigating new cultures, and collecting art and cultural objects. Before any travel, he would read about the culture and area to be visited, often serving as his own travel guide. Fine food and wine were something to be savored. He loved theater, art, dancing, swimming (especially in the ocean), and knowledge in general. These loves were passed on to his appreciative family. William had the wonderful experience of seeing the natural beauty of the United States in the early 1950s as part of his work in the National Park Service; he wanted to share this experience with his family. Especially remembered are the two resulting cross-USA driving trips in 1953 and 1959 with his wife and three daughters to visit the National Parks -- quite a challenge back then. William was born on April 29, 1920 in Philadelphia and received a B.A. in Government from Brooklyn College (1940), an M.A. in Public Administration from American University (1948), and a J.D. from George Washington University (1953). William worked for the Federal Government from 1941 to 1957. His appointments there included advisory and managerial positions in the War Department (Lend Lease Depot), Bureau of the Budget, Bureau of Land Management, First and Second Hoover Commissions, and the U.S. Congress. Some of his government work resulted in major reorganization of government agencies. From 1957 to 1968, William worked in the government and law division of the Ford Foundation, responsible for making grants for new directions in legal education and for research to improve the administration of justice. His most lasting work as President of the Council on Legal Education for Professional Responsibility (CLEPR) started in 1968, CLEPR was responsible for reforms in the system of legal education by starting the clinical movement in law school curriculums and providing law students with real-life professional responsibilities and exposure to the people-oriented aspect of the legal profession. Creative and pioneering CLEPR projects resulted in clinical programs existing in almost every U.S. law school and internationally. In his lifetime, William worked tirelessly to establish clinical legal education as an Important part of legal studies and as an especially effective means for teaching professional responsibility. Administration of clinical justice and the attainment of the ideal of equal justice under the law were of paramount importance to him. William's dedication to Justice and clinical education were recognized by many legal organizations. He was the recipient of the President's Medal from The Catholic University of America for his pioneering work in clinical legal education and he received an honorary doctorate of laws from Georgetown in Washington, DC. The Association of American Law Schools (AALS) clinical section yearly bestows The William Pincus Award in his honor to one or more Individuals or institutions that have effected outstanding contributions to the cause of clinical legal education. William is missed by his loving family. Services: Sunday, May 18, 2014 at 1pm at Riverside Nassau North Chapels, 55 North Station Plaza, (opposite LIRR), Great Neck, NY."

2014-05-21T00:00:00Z,"MacDONALD--Robert Ian, Robert Ian MacDonald, died quietly in Nassau, the Bahamas on May 12th. He left this world as he lived in it, with elegance, courage and humility. Born in 1928 in London to a life less ordinary, he had deep roots in England, America and Scotland. In addition to the Bahamas, he maintained residences in New York, London and Devon for more than eighty years. His paternal great-grandfather, George MacDonald, was the Victorian poet and author whose book, ""The Light Princess"", was recently turned into a successful musical at the National Theatre in London. His maternal great grandfather was Charles Pratt of Brooklyn, a partner in Standard Oil who also founded the Pratt Institute. His mother, Helen Babbott MacDonald and his father, Ian MacDonald, both served the cause of freedom during the Second World War in England. His father returned to the Army and was stationed in Churchill's London map room. Helen MacDonald was head of the Red Cross and Army Officer's Club in Salcombe while the allies prepared for the Normandy invasion on the beaches near Gullet, the family farm in Devon. During the war years, Robert was evacuated to America where he attended the Pomfret School and spent four happy years with his American cousins in Bernardsville, New Jersey. With the surrender of the Germans in 1945, he left school and returned to Britain with other evacuees on a Royal Navy battleship. He attended Millfield School in Somerset, England to prepare for the Royal Marines' exam and was granted his commission by King George VI. Following service to King and Country, he became the first trainee for the Mobil Oil Corporation in England. Later, he worked for Lloyds in the City of London and managed the family farm in Devon. As a lifelong dairy farmer, he especially prized his pedigree herd of Ayrshire cows. In later years, he would became the head of his family's New York based foundation. He was particularly interested in trans-Atlantic education, animal rights and conservation. He credited his good friend, Hoyle Jones (retired Chairman of the ASPCA), for persuading him to give up blood sports. ""One is never too old to learn"", he remarked at the time. Robert was never happier than in the company of his five grandsons (Jonathan MacDonald, Michael MacDonald, David MacDonald, Luke Harris (Emily) and Peter Harris) who succeed him, together with his son, Ian MacDonald (Cheryl) and daughter, Zara Harris, (Dan).

A trailblazing scientist who made foundational discoveries in immunology and neuroscience, he was a valued mentor, collaborator, and member of the campus community for nearly 35 years. He joined Rockefeller in 1957 as a doctoral student in the laboratory of Henry Kunkel, where he began the research that led him to decipher the chemical structure of an antibody. For this accomplishment and subsequent discoveries, he shared the 1972 Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine. After earning his Ph.D. in 1960, he remained at Rockefeller as assistant professor, associate professor, and then Vincent Astor Professor, until 1992, serving also as associate dean of graduate studies until 1966. The University was proud to award him an honorary degree in 2008. Trained in his youth as a concert violinist, he was also a passionate proponent of the arts, particularly music, and helped to organize the University's concert series for many years. His virtuosity was evident not only in the originality of his experiments, but also in his spectacular wit and prolific writing. He was among the rare individuals who are able to draw cogent connections across disciplines, not only within the sciences, but also with the arts and humanities. His unique blend of humor, creativity, and scientific brilliance will be profoundly missed. We extend our heartfelt condolences to his wife, Maxine, and his children, Eric, David, and Judith.

He attended Brooklyn Tech High School and received a Bachelor's Degree in Mechanical Engineering from Purdue University in 1946 and a Master's Degree in Industrial Engineering at Columbia University in 1947. Jerry served in the US Navy Air Corps in WWII. In 1954, he founded Park Electrochemical Corporation (PKE), which is a multi-national company listed on the New York Stock Exchange.

Upon retiring, Jerry embarked on a new and prolific career as a professional sculptor. A true artist at heart, Jerry started Shore Sculpture, a large-format sculpture studio that was thoroughly embedded in the local community in Port Washington, NY.

A man of simple needs, he devoted himself to improving the human condition as a humanitarian, philanthropist, and artist.

2014-05-23T00:00:00Z,"MAZZOLA--Anthony T.,Former editor in chief of Town&Country and Harper's BAZAAR, and the curator of Hearst Corporation's fine art collection, died May 21 in New York. He was 90. ""Anthony Mazzola was a dynamic member of the Hearst Magazines family for more than 65 years,"" said Steven R. Swartz, president and CEO, Hearst Corporation. ""Tony will be missed by everyone who had the pleasure of working with him."" Frank A. Bennack, Jr., former CEO and now executive vice chairman of Hearst Corporation, added, ""Tony Mazzola's contributions to Harper's BAZAAR and Town&Country have not only influenced those titles as they appear even today but our entire magazine business."" Mazzola, the editor who defined affluence and style for millions of readers at the two magazines for 44 years, started his career at Hearst as an art director. In 1948, at the age of 25, Mazzola joined Town&Country as the youngest art director in the magazine's history. He held that post for nearly two decades, ultimately becoming editor in chief in 1965. Town&Country is the longest continuously published general-interest magazine in America, having been founded in 1846. ""Tony Mazzola was one of the most creative editors I've known,"" said Hearst Corporation Director Gilbert C. Maurer. ""A man of great personal style, he intuitively knew what good looked like and his work at Town&Country and Harper's BAZAAR reflected that acute sensibility. Tony was a loyal friend as well as a valuable mentor to a generation of our younger talents."" Building on what he once described as his ""fascination with trends,"" Mazzola's Town&Country began to reflect the current events and social reorganization then affecting elite American society as the nation mourned the assassination of President John F. Kennedy and grappled with civil rights, the Vietnam War and the first stirrings of modern-day feminism. Mazzola said he was captivated ""not by what's happening, but why."" While still the magazine's art director in 1964, he published a tongue-in-cheek ""It's Fun to Be Rich"" issue. In 1966, his first year as Town&Country's editor in chief, he put the Rolling Stones on the cover of what was widely held to be the bible of conservative, blue-blooded America. The ensuing controversy prompted Hearst's executives to ask him, ""Young man, do you know what you're doing?"" ""I think so,"" he replied. In fact, Mazzola did: By maintaining a meticulous balance between creating an exciting magazine and conveying the dignity of the subjects he presented, he broadened Town&Country's appeal and honored its audience. ""People make fun of money,"" he once said, ""but everyone forgets the good that money has done."" In 1972, Mazzola was appointed editor in chief of Harper's BAZAAR and expanded his editorial style even further. He relished the opportunity to widen the magazine's scope, which he again did in 1983 by adapting its pages to reflect newly emerging trends such as the more mature, sophisticated fashions--and celebrities--of the time, and readers' increasing interest in lifestyle, as well as fashion, content. ""We love the handle of being the fashion magazine with a little salt and pepper added,"" he said of BAZAAR in a 1983 interview. ""We appeal to a woman with a very strong confidence level, who is sure of herself, not wishy-washy. She wants to know everything there is to know...and we have become the fashion and beauty book with personality, the one with heart."" At the end of the decade, Mazzola again redesigned the magazine, this time to appeal to readers as they matured from trendy to classic tastes. Striving for what he called a ""very unconventional, exciting visual product,"" Mazzola encouraged photographers such as Francesco Scavullo, Rico Puhlmann and Matthew Rolston to take dramatic, even abstract approaches to fashion. One result was a celebrated shot described by a writer as ""a woman and a cabbage leaf facing off"" to illustrate a story on vegetable dyes used in hair coloring. After he stepped down as editor in chief in 1992, Mazzola edited BAZAAR's 125th anniversary book in 1993. The project was both professionally and personally rewarding. ""Reliving the history of this great magazine and knowing that I had a role in it is a great privilege,"" he said. In 1995, he was editorial director of Town&Country's two-volume 150th anniversary book. Mazzola was also the fine arts curator for Hearst Corporation, whose fine art collection emphasizes works on paper and emerging talents, many of whom have become household names since the collection was started. In addition to curating and cataloguing the collection, he produced many art and photography shows for Hearst Tower. Mazzola graduated from The Cooper Union with honors in 1948 and received The Cooper Union's distinguished alumni citation in 1992. After beginning study at The Cooper Union, he was drafted into World War II. His art background prompted an assignment to army intelligence, where he analyzed camouflage. He was awarded a Bronze Star for ""meritorious achievement in connection with military operations against the enemy in Luzon, Philippine Islands."" A recipient of numerous awards in the art direction and design fields, Mazzola was inducted as a Knight Officer of the Order of Merit by the Republic of Italy in 1967. He also served as a consultant and designer for such organizations as the United Nations Children's Fund, the Association of Junior Leagues of America, Princess Marcella Borghese, Inc., General Foods, Columbia Pictures, Inc. and the New York World's Fair of 1965. Mazzola is survived by his wife, Michele Morgan Mazzola, who worked with him at Hearst for over 45 years, and three children, Alisa Mazzola Mitchell, Marc Mazzola and Tony Mazzola. He is also survived by five grandchildren. There will be a private funeral in Indiana, and a memorial in New York at a future date. In lieu of flowers, donations can be made to Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center (Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center, PO Box 27106, New York, NY 10087-7105 or http://www.mskcc.org/giving)."

Dorothy had a heart transplant in May 2009 and all admired her courage and strong character. She was at risk for Lymphoma because she, and many organ recipients are required to take drugs that appreciably decrease the immune system.

2014-05-25T00:00:00Z,"BEM--Sandra Lipsitz. Emerita Professor of Psychology at Cornell, past director of Cornell's Women's Studies Program, and a psychotherapist, peacefully ended her own life at her home in Ithaca on May 20, 2014, one month before her 70th birthday. She had been diagnosed with Alzheimer's Disease in 2010, and made known at that time her intention to end her life while she could still do so without assistance if and when the disease became too debilitating for a meaningful quality of life. Sandra was born and raised in Pittsburgh, PA, and received her bachelor's degree in psychology from Pittsburgh's Carnegie Institute of Technology in 1965-now Carnegie-Mellon University (CMU). During her senior year, she met and married Daryl Bem, a new assistant professor there. In 1967, she received her PhD in psychology from the University of Michigan and joined Daryl on the faculty at CMU. In 1969, they joined the Psychology Department of Stanford University, where Sandra initiated her research on gender. In 1978, she was hired by Cornell University as Professor of Psychology and Director of the Women's Studies Program. She and Daryl remained on the Cornell faculty until their respective retirements in 2010 and 2007. Sandra received several honors for her scholarly work. She received the American Psychological Association's Distinguished Scientific Award for an Early Contribution to Psychology (1976), the Association for Women in Psychology's Distinguished Publication Award (1977), and the American Association of University Women's Young Scholar Award (1980). Her 1993 book, The Lenses of Gender: Transforming the Debate on Sexual Inequality, was honored by the Association of American Publishers as the Best Book in Psychology for that year. In 1998, she published An Unconventional Family, a memoir of her marriage to Daryl and their strategies for raising their two children to be as free of the society's gender constraints as possible. Both Sandra and Daryl were activists in the feminist movement and frequently spoke together publicly on sex roles in contemporary America. Sandra served as an expert witness in two notable sex discrimination cases: one filed by the National Organization for Women (NOW) against the Pittsburgh Press for segregating classified job listings into ""Male Help Wanted"" and ""Female Help wanted"" columns. The Press lost the case and appealed the decision all the way to the Supreme Court, which ruled 5-4 in favor of NOW. Sandy also appeared with Daryl as an expert witness in a hearing before the Federal Communications Commission in 1972, which had charged AT&T of discriminating against women. In a widely publicized settlement, AT&T agreed to modify several of its practices. The Bems' testimony is described in detail in Stockford's 2004 book, The Bellwomen: The Story of the Landmark AT&T Sex Discrimination Case. In 1997, Sandra enrolled in Rutgers' Psy.D program and, in 1980, received her license to practice psychotherapy in New York State. She then opened a part-time psychotherapy practice in Ithaca. Sandra was predeceased by her parents, Peter and Lillian Lipsitz. In addition to Daryl, her husband of 49 years, Sandra's survivors include her daughter Emily Bem (Julius Viksne and their 17-month-old son Felix Viksne Bem), son Jeremy Bem, sister Beverly Lipsitz (Roz Basin and their son Ben Basin), brother-in-law Barry Bem and sister-in-law Robyn Bem. Her final months were considerably brightened by her delight with her new grandson, Felix. In lieu of a funeral or memorial service, the family met as a group with Sandra two days prior to her death to share their thoughts, feelings, and reminiscences with her and each other."

2014-05-25T00:00:00Z,"MAZZOLA--Anthony T.,Former editor in chief of Town&Country and Harper's BAZAAR, and the curator of Hearst Corporation's fine art collection, died May 21 in New York. He was 90. ""Anthony Mazzola was a dynamic member of the Hearst Magazines family for more than 65 years,"" said Steven R. Swartz, president and CEO, Hearst Corporation. ""Tony will be missed by everyone who had the pleasure of working with him."" Frank A. Bennack, Jr., former CEO and now executive vice chairman of Hearst Corporation, added, ""Tony Mazzola's contributions to Harper's BAZAAR and Town&Country have not only influenced those titles as they appear even today but our entire magazine business."" Mazzola, the editor who defined affluence and style for millions of readers at the two magazines for 44 years, started his career at Hearst as an art director. In 1948, at the age of 25, Mazzola joined Town&Country as the youngest art director in the magazine's history. He held that post for nearly two decades, ultimately becoming editor in chief in 1965. Town&Country is the longest continuously published general-interest magazine in America, having been founded in 1846. ""Tony Mazzola was one of the most creative editors I've known,"" said Hearst Corporation Director Gilbert C. Maurer. ""A man of great personal style, he intuitively knew what good looked like and his work at Town&Country and Harper's BAZAAR reflected that acute sensibility. Tony was a loyal friend as well as a valuable mentor to a generation of our younger talents."" Building on what he once described as his ""fascination with trends,"" Mazzola's Town&Country began to reflect the current events and social reorganization then affecting elite American society as the nation mourned the assassination of President John F. Kennedy and grappled with civil rights, the Vietnam War and the first stirrings of modern-day feminism. Mazzola said he was captivated ""not by what's happening, but why."" While still the magazine's art director in 1964, he published a tongue-in-cheek ""It's Fun to Be Rich"" issue. In 1966, his first year as Town&Country's editor in chief, he put the Rolling Stones on the cover of what was widely held to be the bible of conservative, blue-blooded America. The ensuing controversy prompted Hearst's executives to ask him, ""Young man, do you know what you're doing?"" ""I think so,"" he replied. In fact, Mazzola did: By maintaining a meticulous balance between creating an exciting magazine and conveying the dignity of the subjects he presented, he broadened Town&Country's appeal and honored its audience. ""People make fun of money,"" he once said, ""but everyone forgets the good that money has done."" In 1972, Mazzola was appointed editor in chief of Harper's BAZAAR and expanded his editorial style even further. He relished the opportunity to widen the magazine's scope, which he again did in 1983 by adapting its pages to reflect newly emerging trends such as the more mature, sophisticated fashions--and celebrities--of the time, and readers' increasing interest in lifestyle, as well as fashion, content. ""We love the handle of being the fashion magazine with a little salt and pepper added,"" he said of BAZAAR in a 1983 interview. ""We appeal to a woman with a very strong confidence level, who is sure of herself, not wishy-washy. She wants to know everything there is to know...and we have become the fashion and beauty book with personality, the one with heart."" At the end of the decade, Mazzola again redesigned the magazine, this time to appeal to readers as they matured from trendy to classic tastes. Striving for what he called a ""very unconventional, exciting visual product,"" Mazzola encouraged photographers such as Francesco Scavullo, Rico Puhlmann and Matthew Rolston to take dramatic, even abstract approaches to fashion. One result was a celebrated shot described by a writer as ""a woman and a cabbage leaf facing off"" to illustrate a story on vegetable dyes used in hair coloring. After he stepped down as editor in chief in 1992, Mazzola edited BAZAAR's 125th anniversary book in 1993. The project was both professionally and personally rewarding. ""Reliving the history of this great magazine and knowing that I had a role in it is a great privilege,"" he said. In 1995, he was editorial director of Town&Country's two-volume 150th anniversary book. Mazzola was also the fine arts curator for Hearst Corporation, whose fine art collection emphasizes works on paper and emerging talents, many of whom have become household names since the collection was started. In addition to curating and cataloguing the collection, he produced many art and photography shows for Hearst Tower. Mazzola graduated from The Cooper Union with honors in 1948 and received The Cooper Union's distinguished alumni citation in 1992. After beginning study at The Cooper Union, he was drafted into World War II. His art background prompted an assignment to army intelligence, where he analyzed camouflage. He was awarded a Bronze Star for ""meritorious achievement in connection with military operations against the enemy in Luzon, Philippine Islands."" A recipient of numerous awards in the art direction and design fields, Mazzola was inducted as a Knight Officer of the Order of Merit by the Republic of Italy in 1967. He also served as a consultant and designer for such organizations as the United Nations Children's Fund, the Association of Junior Leagues of America, Princess Marcella Borghese, Inc., General Foods, Columbia Pictures, Inc. and the New York World's Fair of 1965. Mazzola is survived by his wife, Michele Morgan Mazzola, who worked with him at Hearst for over 45 years, and three children, Alisa Mazzola Mitchell, Marc Mazzola and Tony Mazzola. He is also survived by five grandchildren. There will be a private funeral in Indiana, and a memorial in New York at a future date.

She developed and managed training programs for the investment bank and introduced one of the first on-line job posting systems on Wall Street. From 2002 to 2014, Patsy established and managed her own work/life management-consulting firm where she coached individuals on their careers and developed and delivered training to help employees with the work/life balance. Patsy found joy in creating networks for people, enabling them to make better career and life choices. One of Patsy's passions was volunteerism. She served Duke in many capacities following her graduation as a member of the Duke Alumni Association Board of Directors and the Annual Fund Reunion Committee. She also Chaired the Alumni Admissions Advisory Committee and was President of the Duke University Metropolitan Alumni Association. In 1990, she was awarded the C.A.

Patsy was also dedicated to Katie's school and served as the President of the Kent Place School Parents' Association, a committee member, Class Mom, Star Mom and established and led the Girl Scout Troop at the school. Additionally, Patsy volunteered at the churches she attended, most recently serving at Christ Church on the Youth Group Volunteer Team, the Miss Representation Team and providing staff training. Patsy was a member of the Junior League of Summit since 1996. She received the Active Volunteer of the Year Award for 2002-2003 and was known for her training expertise, which she generously shared during her service as an Active member and, most recently, as a Sustaining member. Her greatest passion and love was her family, especially her wonderful daughter Katie. In addition to Katie and Bill, she is survived by Maryann and Jeffrey Sedlack, Kathleen and George Malhame, Louis and Maria Dempsey, and Thomas and Melinda Dempsey. She was a loving aunt to Will, Anne, Meg, Charlie, Mary, Luke, Jack, Colin, Hannah, Maeve and Mark.

2014-05-27T00:00:00Z,"ROGERS--Howland P. Howland Pendleton (""Pen"") Rogers passed away peacefully on Monday, May 19, 2014, at his home in Hobe Sound, Florida. Born in New York City on July 11, 1922, to Henry Pendleton Rogers, Jr. and Gladys Pell, he grew up in New York City and Tuxedo Park, New York. His ancestors included Elbridge T. Gerry, a signer of the Declaration of Independence and fifth Vice President of the United States; Nathaniel Pendleton, an officer in the Continental Army who was Alexander Hamilton's second in his duel with Aaron Burr; and Albert Gallatin, who, as Secretary of the Treasury under Thomas Jefferson, financed the Lewis & Clark Expedition and later was a founder of New York University. A graduate of the Brooks School and Harvard University, Pen joined the Army in 1944; a member of the 32nd Infantry Division serving in the Pacific, he was honorably discharged with the rank of Captain. Returning to Tuxedo Park after the war, he helped revitalize the community, assuming key roles including Mayor and Police Commissioner of the Village of Tuxedo Park and President of the Board of Trustees of the Tuxedo Park School. An avid golfer, he was active in building the new golf course at the Tuxedo Club in the 1950s; other club memberships included the Seminole Golf Club and U.S. Seniors Golf Association. He later made his home in Hobe Sound, Florida, where he served as President of the Jupiter Island Club. He is survived by his wife of 56 years, Zosia Rogers; their daughter, Susan Moehlmann; his daughter, Lisa Taylor, and son, Henry P. Rogers, from an earlier marriage; his step-daughter, Sandra Penati; and six granddaughters.

2014-05-27T00:00:00Z,"GOLD--Melvin Leonard, one of the nation's foremost actuaries, died at his Teaneck home on Memorial Day after a well-fought battle with Parkinson's. He was 88. The funeral will be held on Wednesday, May 28, at 11am at Robert Schoem's Memorial Chapel, 150 New Jersey 4, in Paramus, NJ, followed by burial in Union, NJ. Born February 10, 1926, in Philadelphia to Reba (formerly Kligman) and Phillip, Mel grew up during the Depression as the only child of his older immigrant parents and the half-brother of Al, Edith, Norma, Rose, and Sylvia. A brilliant student, he made his own way in the world. Mel earned a full scholarship to the University of Pennsylvania and although his studies were interrupted for U.S. Navy service during World War II, he graduated in 1947 with a bachelor's in Mathematics. He became an actuary at The Prudential in Newark and passed the stringent actuarial exams on the first try. After marrying Shifra ""Sherry"" Gerber, they moved to Israel, where Mel worked for Migdal Insurance. When they returned to the States, they settled in West Orange, NJ, and he later founded Melvin L. Gold & Associates, a leading actuarial consultancy. He was instrumental in the growth of several insurance companies, most notably Presidential Life, and served on the board for years. Mel was ahead of his time on an array of professional, social, and health issues. For example, almost 20 years ago, in a Letter to the Editor of The New York Times he took to task an article about Social Security reform that did not discuss what he believed was a ""clear solution"" promptly raising the retirement age to 70, and then beyond as life expectancies increased. In another favorite letter in The New York Times, he suggested all election ballots include an option for voters to select, ""None of the above."" Mel liked being unconventional. In college, he proactively partnered with a black bridge player when others wouldn't consider it. Despite being excluded from numerous tournaments because of race, the duo became nationally ranked college champions. When Best's Review insurance magazine wanted to put him on the cover, they asked for a photo. Instead of a headshot, he sent one showing him jogging past the ancient pyramids in Egypt. Mel also took his health very seriously and in his 40s, realized that food has a profound impact on well-being. He shunned salt, red meat, alcohol, coffee, desserts, and fats. His signature drink became hot water. In philanthropy, he was most passionate about Israel and Judaism, strongly supporting Yiddish culture and Young Judaea. Mel was a world traveler, sculptor, and athlete. He ran the Jersey Shore Marathon in middle age and loved sailing on Bantam Lake, CT, where he summered for the last 50 years. He had gusto for life unmatched except by his loving wife and partner-in-adventure for 64 years. They loved to sing and dance, and Mel was expected to belt out ""Tum Balalaika"" and dance the kazatske at every family celebration. Mel is survived by Shifra; his four children Charles of New York, NY, and his wife, Anne Kohn; Neil of Fair Lawn, NJ; Ronald of Saddle River, NJ, and his wife, Betsy August Gold; and Nina of Fair Lawn, NJ, and her husband, Raviv Ron; and his seven grandchildren Stephanie, Jacqueline, Alexandra, Samuel, and Jacob Gold, and Avital and Maya Ron. In lieu of flowers, the family would appreciate donations to Young Judaea, 575 Eighth Avenue, New York, NY, 10018, or The National Yiddish Theatre -- Folksbiene, 90 John Street, New York, NY, 10038."

2014-05-27T00:00:00Z,"ASCHER--Celia, art curator, advisor, collector, wife and friend, age 93, passed away peacefully on April 8, 2014 at the Hebrew Home in Riverdale. Celia was born in Berlin, Germany on April 20, 1920. At a young age she escaped the Nazis and became a refugee in London where she met her future husband, Joseph Ascher. She married Mr. Ascher on New Year's Day as German 'bombs were falling' on the city of London. After World War II, the Aschers immigrated to the United States and made their home in New York City. When Celia arrived in New York and saw Times Square she felt she had literally moved out of the darkness of London and into the light. Throughout her life, Celia was devoted to the arts. Even as a child in Berlin, when given the opportunity Celia would choose to spend her spare time looking at art rather than indulging in typical child's play with the other children. She could often be found touring art galleries, visiting artist's studios, taking in concerts, studying music and visiting museums. Celia had a great love for art in all forms; visual arts, performing arts and classical music. She had an insatiable appetite for knowledge and always wanted to remain relevant and up-to-date. In her professional life, Celia worked tirelessly as curator to the business tycoon, Meshulam Riklis, and his corporation to build the McCrory Corporation Collection of Constructive Art. That collection was later donated by the corporation primarily to the Museum of Modern Art, New York. Celia also was an advisor to many art collectors and had a unique understanding of the point of view of the artists whom she knew and loved. Celia had a quick, assured eye and an uncompromising demand for quality, which she relied on in building her own collection, the Celia and Joseph Ascher Collection. Celia became a friend to the Juilliard School after taking part in many classes in the Evening Division and endowing the Celia and Joseph Ascher Fund for Piano in 2008. Celia had a particular affection for the piano having played in Berlin prior to fleeing. Celia also was a subscriber of the New York Philharmonic at Lincoln Center and to several classical series at Carnegie Hall for more than 50 years. Celia is preceded in death by her husband in 1979 and is survived by friends and several nieces and nephews. She also is survived by her beloved paintings--which she referred to as ""her children"". The Celia and Joseph Ascher Collection will live on at the Louisiana Museum, Copenhagen, Denmark, and Celia's memory will live on in the hearts of those who loved her. William D. Zabel, the Executor of Celia's Estate, said the memorial service for Celia will take place at 5pm on June 18th at the Juilliard School, 155 West 55th Street. In lieu of flowers, donations may be made in Celia's memory to the Juilliard School, the Louisiana Museum or an arts institution of one's choosing."

He chaired the New York County Democratic Law Committee for more than 40 years and was a long-time member of the executive committee of the New York State Bar Association Tax Section. Bob was an early member of Manhattan's postwar political reform movement, long-time member of the Lexington Democratic Club and a driving force behind the New York County Democratic Committee. His extraordinary success in reforming Manhattan's judicial and political culture will undoubtedly be his most enduring legacy. He effectively removed partisan political considerations from the judicial nominating process in Manhattan by establishing nonpartisan screening panels. His pioneering role in fostering a judicial culture less tainted by corruption and unwarranted partisan influence is still widely recognized as a model. A lifelong activist devoted to the highest ideals of the Democratic Party, Bob naturally assumed a series of important leadership positions in politics and public policy.

2014-05-28T00:00:00Z,"ASCHER--Celia, art curator, advisor, collector, wife and friend, age 93, passed away peacefully on April 8, 2014 at the Hebrew Home in Riverdale. Celia was born in Berlin, Germany on April 20, 1920. At a young age she escaped the Nazis and became a refugee in London where she met her future husband, Joseph Ascher. She married Mr. Ascher on New Year's Day as German 'bombs were falling' on the city of London. After World War II, the Aschers immigrated to the United States and made their home in New York City. When Celia arrived in New York and saw Times Square she felt she had literally moved out of the darkness of London and into the light. Throughout her life, Celia was devoted to the arts. Even as a child in Berlin, when given the opportunity Celia would choose to spend her spare time looking at art rather than indulging in typical child's play with the other children. She could often be found touring art galleries, visiting artist's studios, taking in concerts, studying music and visiting museums. Celia had a great love for art in all forms; visual arts, performing arts and classical music. She had an insatiable appetite for knowledge and always wanted to remain relevant and up-to-date. In her professional life, Celia worked tirelessly as curator to the business tycoon, Meshulam Riklis, and his corporation to build the McCrory Corporation Collection of Constructive Art. That collection was later donated by the corporation primarily to the Museum of Modern Art, New York. Celia also was an advisor to many art collectors and had a unique understanding of the point of view of the artists whom she knew and loved. Celia had a quick, assured eye and an uncompromising demand for quality, which she relied on in building her own collection, the Celia and Joseph Ascher Collection. Celia became a friend to the Juilliard School after taking part in many classes in the Evening Division and endowing the Celia and Joseph Ascher Fund for Piano in 2008. Celia had a particular affection for the piano having played in Berlin prior to fleeing. Celia also was a subscriber of the New York Philharmonic at Lincoln Center and to several classical series at Carnegie Hall for more than 50 years. Celia is preceded in death by her husband in 1979 and is survived by friends and several nieces and nephews. She also is survived by her beloved paintings--which she referred to as ""her children"". The Celia and Joseph Ascher Collection will live on at the Louisiana Museum, Copenhagen, Denmark, and Celia's memory will live on in the hearts of those who loved her. William D. Zabel, the Executor of Celia's Estate, said the memorial service for Celia will take place at 5pm on June 18th at the Juilliard School, 155 West 55th Street. In lieu of flowers, donations may be made in Celia's memory to the Juilliard School, the Louisiana Museum or an arts institution of one's choosing."

2014-05-28T00:00:00Z,"GOLD--Melvin Leonard, one of the nation's foremost actuaries, died at his Teaneck home on Memorial Day after a well-fought battle with Parkinson's. He was 88. The funeral will be held on Wednesday, May 28, at 11am at Robert Schoem's Memorial Chapel, 150 New Jersey 4, in Paramus, NJ, followed by burial in Union, NJ. Born February 10, 1926, in Philadelphia to Reba (formerly Kligman) and Phillip, Mel grew up during the Depression as the only child of his older immigrant parents and the half-brother of Al, Edith, Norma, Rose, and Sylvia. A brilliant student, he made his own way in the world. Mel earned a full scholarship to the University of Pennsylvania and although his studies were interrupted for U.S. Navy service during World War II, he graduated in 1947 with a bachelor's in Mathematics. He became an actuary at The Prudential in Newark and passed the stringent actuarial exams on the first try. After marrying Shifra ""Sherry"" Gerber, they moved to Israel, where Mel worked for Migdal Insurance. When they returned to the States, they settled in West Orange, NJ, and he later founded Melvin L. Gold & Associates, a leading actuarial consultancy. He was instrumental in the growth of several insurance companies, most notably Presidential Life, and served on the board for years. Mel was ahead of his time on an array of professional, social, and health issues. For example, almost 20 years ago, in a Letter to the Editor of The New York Times he took to task an article about Social Security reform that did not discuss what he believed was a ""clear solution"" promptly raising the retirement age to 70, and then beyond as life expectancies increased. In another favorite letter in The New York Times, he suggested all election ballots include an option for voters to select, ""None of the above."" Mel liked being unconventional. In college, he proactively partnered with a black bridge player when others wouldn't consider it. Despite being excluded from numerous tournaments because of race, the duo became nationally ranked college champions. When Best's Review insurance magazine wanted to put him on the cover, they asked for a photo. Instead of a headshot, he sent one showing him jogging past the ancient pyramids in Egypt. Mel also took his health very seriously and in his 40s, realized that food has a profound impact on well-being. He shunned salt, red meat, alcohol, coffee, desserts, and fats. His signature drink became hot water. In philanthropy, he was most passionate about Israel and Judaism, strongly supporting Yiddish culture and Young Judaea. Mel was a world traveler, sculptor, and athlete. He ran the Jersey Shore Marathon in middle age and loved sailing on Bantam Lake, CT, where he summered for the last 50 years. He had gusto for life unmatched except by his loving wife and partner-in-adventure for 64 years. They loved to sing and dance, and Mel was expected to belt out ""Tum Balalaika"" and dance the kazatske at every family celebration. Mel is survived by Shifra; his four children Charles of New York, NY, and his wife, Anne Kohn; Neil of Fair Lawn, NJ; Ronald of Saddle River, NJ, and his wife, Betsy August Gold; and Nina of Fair Lawn, NJ, and her husband, Raviv Ron; and his seven grandchildren Stephanie, Jacqueline, Alexandra, Samuel, and Jacob Gold, and Avital and Maya Ron. In lieu of flowers, the family would appreciate donations to Young Judaea, 575 Eighth Avenue, New York, NY, 10018, or The National Yiddish Theatre -- Folksbiene, 90 John Street, New York, NY, 10038."

2014-05-29T00:00:00Z,"ASCHER--Celia, art curator, advisor, collector, wife and friend, age 93, passed away peacefully on April 8, 2014 at the Hebrew Home in Riverdale. Celia was born in Berlin, Germany on April 20, 1920. At a young age she escaped the Nazis and became a refugee in London where she met her future husband, Joseph Ascher. She married Mr. Ascher on New Year's Day as German 'bombs were falling' on the city of London. After World War II, the Aschers immigrated to the United States and made their home in New York City. When Celia arrived in New York and saw Times Square she felt she had literally moved out of the darkness of London and into the light. Throughout her life, Celia was devoted to the arts. Even as a child in Berlin, when given the opportunity Celia would choose to spend her spare time looking at art rather than indulging in typical child's play with the other children. She could often be found touring art galleries, visiting artist's studios, taking in concerts, studying music and visiting museums. Celia had a great love for art in all forms; visual arts, performing arts and classical music. She had an insatiable appetite for knowledge and always wanted to remain relevant and up-to-date. In her professional life, Celia worked tirelessly as curator to the business tycoon, Meshulam Riklis, and his corporation to build the McCrory Corporation Collection of Constructive Art. That collection was later donated by the corporation primarily to the Museum of Modern Art, New York. Celia also was an advisor to many art collectors and had a unique understanding of the point of view of the artists whom she knew and loved. Celia had a quick, assured eye and an uncompromising demand for quality, which she relied on in building her own collection, the Celia and Joseph Ascher Collection. Celia became a friend to the Juilliard School after taking part in many classes in the Evening Division and endowing the Celia and Joseph Ascher Fund for Piano in 2008. Celia had a particular affection for the piano having played in Berlin prior to fleeing. Celia also was a subscriber of the New York Philharmonic at Lincoln Center and to several classical series at Carnegie Hall for more than 50 years. Celia is preceded in death by her husband in 1979 and is survived by friends and several nieces and nephews. She also is survived by her beloved paintings--which she referred to as ""her children"". The Celia and Joseph Ascher Collection will live on at the Louisiana Museum, Copenhagen, Denmark, and Celia's memory will live on in the hearts of those who loved her. William D. Zabel, the Executor of Celia's Estate, said the memorial service for Celia will take place at 5pm on June 18th at the Juilliard School, 155 West 55th Street. In lieu of flowers, donations may be made in Celia's memory to the Juilliard School, the Louisiana Museum or an arts institution of one's choosing."

He is survived by his loving wife, Susana; daughters Julia and Cristina; and stepsons Marcelo and Alvaro Boggio. Dr. de Quadros was born and raised in Brazil, where he completed his medical and public health studies. He dedicated his life to championing health as a fundamental human right and worked tirelessly on behalf of the world's poorest populations to increase access to life-saving vaccines. For more than a decade, Dr. de Quadros led our advocacy efforts, encouraging low- and middle-income countries to prioritize and sustain financing for vaccine programs, particularly those focused on protecting children. Prior to joining Sabin, Dr. de Quadros was Director of the Division of Vaccines and Immunization of the World Health Organization and the Pan American Health Organization (PAHO), where he helped avert thousands of deaths by leading efforts to eradicate polio and measles from the Western Hemisphere, and smallpox from Ethiopia. His forward-thinking vision, optimism and tenacity to overcome the seemingly impossible, coupled with his conviction that all countries, no matter their economic status, must invest in the well-being of their own people, helped transform modern day public health programs. A man of deep integrity, humility and compassion, Dr. de Quadros was a mentor to many within the global health community, and was lauded for his many accomplishments. Among the more than 36 prestigious honors and awards presented to him, he received PAHO's Public Health Hero of the Americas Award, bestowed upon individuals who have made extraordinary contributions to improving the health and well-being of the peoples of the Western Hemisphere (2014); the BBVA Foundation Frontiers of Knowledge Award of Development Cooperation for contributions to global development through his work with disease eradication and control (2012); the Albert B. Sabin Gold Medal award (2000); and the highest civil award presented by the Government of Brazil, the Order of Rio Branco (1999). He was a giant in his field, passionately committed to his crusade of eliminating vaccine-preventable diseases. He will be greatly missed by his colleagues and many friends throughout the world.

She also was sent on tour by the US Department of State Cultural Program and performed throughout the Middle East, Southeast Asia, Western Europe, Argentina, and the United States under the management of impresario Sol Hurok. In 1971, she was presented by Hurok at her debut at Philharmonic Hall (now Avery Fisher Hall at Lincoln Center.) A native New Yorker of Armenian descent, she gave her first recital at age seven, two years after becoming the youngest student ever accepted to the Juilliard School Preparatory Division. She continued her education there as a scholarship winner for 15 years, and graduated with both Bachelor of Science and Master of Science degrees. She also completed requirements for a PH.D degree at Columbia University. Among her teachers were Beveridge Webster and Rosina Lhevinne. She also coached with some of the greatest musicians, including pianists Mieczeslaw Horszowski, Yakov Fliere, Emil Gilels, and composer Aram Khachaturian who entrusted her with the American premiere of his Piano Sonata. Among her greatest achievements was the foundation of the Juilliard-Komitas friendship program in 1992, enabling gifted students from the Komitas Conservatory in Yerevan, Armenia to be admitted to The Juilliard School in New York to continue their musical education. Ms. Ishkanian was an honorary professor at the Komitas Conservatory, and served as president of the jury for the graduation examinations. Ms. Ishkanian also was a distinguished member of international piano competition juries around the world, including the First International Aram Khachaturian Piano Competition in Yerevan in 1997, the First International Rachmaninoff Piano Competition in Los Angeles, CA in 2002, as well as the Dorothy MacKenzie Artist Recognition Awards at the International Keyboard Institute and Festival in New York City. Ms. Ishkanian is survived by her husband, Hagop Tankian. A brother, Vahe, predeceased her. There will be a 40th day requiem service on Sunday at the St. Illuminator's Armenian Apostolic Cathedral, located at 221 East 27th Street in New York City, starting at 11:30am, after which there will be a musical tribute and a reception.

2014-06-01T00:00:00Z,"McNEAL--Philip Webster, beloved husband, father, son and friend, passed away on May 27, 2014. Philip was born in St. Louis, Missouri on December 6, 1953. The only child of the late Senator Theodore McNeal and his wife Virgie, Philip was named after American labor movement giants A. Philip Randolph and Milton Webster. The elder McNeal worked with both men to organize the International Brotherhood of Sleeping Car Porters, the most prominent predominantly black labor union of its day. In 1976 Philip graduated with a BS in mechanical engineering from University of Missouri, Rolla, and began his career at Exxon Mobil as a project engineer. In 1984, Philip joined J.P. Morgan as an investment banker in the firm's Natural Resources and Power Group, and later, Managing Director and Senior Client Advisor. Philip met his true love Glenda Goodly and they married in 1989. They enjoyed a rare, enviable partnership of equals who not only loved but also truly respected each other. They were blessed with two wonderful children - daughter Sydney and son Carter. Despite his demanding career, Philip was active in his community, serving as a longtime board chair of the Montclair Human Needs Food Pantry, former trustee of Montclair Kimberley Academy, and trustee of Newark Academy. But at the very center of his life, was his devotion to Glenda, Sydney and Carter. He cherished each of them and their time together as a family. Philip found absolute contentment immersed in a finite set of passions: St. Barths, boating, Long Beach Island, and his circle of extended family and friends. They comprised an endless stream of precious memories punctuated by the unforgettable expression on Philip's face when Glenda surprised him with a 60th birthday party in January 2014. Soon after, Philip was diagnosed with pancreatic cancer. Philip's battle to the end with this devastating disease was marked by the same integrity, clarity, and steadiness of spirit he embodied in his work and personal life. Philip passed away at home, surrounded by those he loved most on the eve of his and Glenda's 25th wedding anniversary. Thoughtful and generous to his core, Philip would want the battle against pancreatic cancer to continue in the form of funding research so that others might be spared what he endured. A fund has been established in his honor at Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center. He is survived by Glenda, Sydney and Carter; his mother Virgie, half-brother Theodore McNeal Jr., and an extended family that loved him dearly. Few are as stellar in life as they are claimed to be in memory; Philip McNeal was, and he will remain so in our hearts, forever. Memorial service will be held on Monday, June 2nd at 6pm at the Morgan Library, 235 Madison Avenue, New York, New York."

In 1952 Mike hired a 22-year old conductor for a nationwide Gershwin concert tour that ran for two seasons (1952-54) and played in 170 cities. His name: Lorin Maazel. It was the only orchestra in history dedicated exclusively to the music of one composer. Mike pursued his interest in George Gershwin in collaboration with Michael Feinstein.

She continued her education there as a scholarship winner for 15 years, and graduated with both Bachelor of Science and Master of Science degrees. She also completed requirements for a PH.D degree at Columbia University. Among her teachers were Beveridge Webster and Rosina Lhevinne. She also coached with some of the greatest musicians, including pianists Mieczeslaw Horszowski, Yakov Fliere, Emil Gilels, and composer Aram Khachaturian who entrusted her with the American premiere of his Piano Sonata. Among her greatest achievements was the foundation of the Juilliard-Komitas friendship program in 1992, enabling gifted students from the Komitas Conservatory in Yerevan, Armenia to be admitted to The Juilliard School in New York to continue their musical education. Ms. Ishkanian was an honorary professor at the Komitas Conservatory, and served as president of the jury for the graduation examinations. Ms. Ishkanian also was a distinguished member of international piano competition juries around the world, including the First International Aram Khachaturian Piano Competition in Yerevan in 1997, the First International Rachmaninoff Piano Competition in Los Angeles, CA in 2002, as well as the Dorothy MacKenzie Artist Recognition Awards at the International Keyboard Institute and Festival in New York City. Ms. Ishkanian is survived by her husband, Hagop Tankian. A brother, Vahe, predeceased her. There will be a 40th day requiem service on Sunday at the St. Illuminator's Armenian Apostolic Cathedral, located at 221 East 27th Street in New York City, starting at 11:30am, after which there will be a musical tribute and a reception. Donations in her memory may be made to the Armenian Scholarship Fund at The Juilliard School."
2014-06-01T00:00:00Z,"ACKERMAN--Jack. The Board, staff, and clients of Jewish Board of Family and Children's Services have lost a friend, ally, and agency leader of legendary importance. First joining the Board in 1966, Jack served as Trustee and Treasurer for many years. The importance of his leadership and sage advice at critical junctures in our history, including the merger of Jewish Family Service and Jewish Board of Guardians in the 1970s and the fiscal crisis of the 1990s, cannot be overstated. All of us mourn his loss deeply alongside his wife Dana, their children, and many friends. His memory will surely be a blessing at JBFCS."
2014-06-01T00:00:00Z,"GREENE--Maxine. The President, Trustees and extended Teachers College community mourn Maxine Greene, philosopher, author, professor emerita and touchstone for generations of TC faculty, alumni and students, as well as for scholars and artists around the world. Maxine was an extraordinary mind and spirit embodying what is best and most essential about our mission and work. She was an ardent feminist and a crusader against anti-Semitism. Her belief that art is a means to awaken each of us to how we respond to the world will endure as her greatest legacy. Through her many books and essays; through her passionate teaching in TC's classrooms, at Lincoln Center and in the famed salons she held in her apartment; and through her mentoring of eager minds of all generations and across an array of disciplines, Maxine exhorted us to ""look at things as if they could be otherwise"" and championed the arts as a catalyst to ""wide-awakeness."" In spirit, thought and deed, she stood as a bulwark against what she termed ""the feelings of powerlessness"" occasioned by modern society, arguing that only as people ""learn to make sense of what is happening... can they develop the sense of agency required for living a moral life."" Maxine's influence is both deep and wide-ranging. Beyond her writings, she served as president of all the leading professional societies in the education field and as editor of prestigious journals, and she received countless awards. Her ultimate measure is perhaps best summed up by her own standard for excellence in teaching. ""There are,"" she wrote, ""young persons in the inner cities, the ones lashed by 'savage inequalities' the ones whose very schools are made sick by the social problems the young bring in from without. Here, more frequently than not, are the real tests of 'teaching as possibility' in the face of what looks like an impossible social reality at a time when few adults seem to care."" We extend our condolences to Maxine's son, Timothy Greene; her sister, Jeanne Shinefield; her step-daughter, Elizabeth Greene; her daughter-in-law, Constance Gemson; and her grandson, Daniel Greene; and we salute the memory of her brother, Joseph Meyer, her sister, Carol Meyer, and her daughter, Linda Lechner. Those wishing to donate in Maxine Greene's memory may give to the Maxine Greene Scholarship in Philosophy and Education, which supports students in the College's Philosophy and Education program. Send to Louis Lo Re, Box 306, Teachers College, 525 West 120th Street, New York, NY 10027. Susan H. Fuhrman, President Thomas James, Provost/Dean"

2014-06-02T00:00:00Z,"McNEAL--Philip Webster, beloved husband, father, son and friend, passed away on May 27, 2014. Philip was born in St. Louis, Missouri on December 6, 1953. The only child of the late Senator Theodore McNeal and his wife Virgie, Philip was named after American labor movement giants A. Philip Randolph and Milton Webster. The elder McNeal worked with both men to organize the International Brotherhood of Sleeping Car Porters, the most prominent predominantly black labor union of its day. In 1976 Philip graduated with a BS in mechanical engineering from University of Missouri, Rolla, and began his career at Exxon Mobil as a project engineer. In 1984, Philip joined J.P. Morgan as an investment banker in the firm's Natural Resources and Power Group, and later, Managing Director and Senior Client Advisor. Philip met his true love Glenda Goodly and they married in 1989. They enjoyed a rare, enviable partnership of equals who not only loved but also truly respected each other. They were blessed with two wonderful children - daughter Sydney and son Carter. Despite his demanding career, Philip was active in his community, serving as a longtime board chair of the Montclair Human Needs Food Pantry, former trustee of Montclair Kimberley Academy, and trustee of Newark Academy. But at the very center of his life, was his devotion to Glenda, Sydney and Carter. He cherished each of them and their time together as a family. Philip found absolute contentment immersed in a finite set of passions: St. Barths, boating, Long Beach Island, and his circle of extended family and friends. They comprised an endless stream of precious memories punctuated by the unforgettable expression on Philip's face when Glenda surprised him with a 60th birthday party in January 2014. Soon after, Philip was diagnosed with pancreatic cancer. Philip's battle to the end with this devastating disease was marked by the same integrity, clarity, and steadiness of spirit he embodied in his work and personal life. Philip passed away at home, surrounded by those he loved most on the eve of his and Glenda's 25th wedding anniversary. Thoughtful and generous to his core, Philip would want the battle against pancreatic cancer to continue in the form of funding research so that others might be spared what he endured. A fund has been established in his honor at Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center. He is survived by Glenda, Sydney and Carter; his mother Virgie, half-brother Theodore McNeal Jr., and an extended family that loved him dearly. Few are as stellar in life as they are claimed to be in memory; Philip McNeal was, and he will remain so in our hearts, forever. Memorial service will be held on Monday, June 2nd at 6pm at the Morgan Library, 235 Madison Avenue, New York, New York."

Professor Emeritus of Clinical Surgery and Special Lecturer at Columbia Presbyterian Medical Center. Revered for his integrity both as clinician and mentor, Fred's long and distinguished career in the Department of Surgery began in 1944 and continued until his retirement in 1992. Early in his career he co-authored with Drs. Arthur Voorhees and Arthur Blakemore the seminal paper on the development of synthetic vascular grafts. This work initiated the modern era of aortic aneur- ysm surgery. After a decade at the Bassett Hospital in Cooperstown, NY, Fred returned to Columbia, where he redefined the anatomy of the thymus gland and the importance of its complete removal in the surgical therapy for myasthenia gravis. This earned him an international reputation which continues to this day. His multiple publications on thymectomy lead to his appointment, at age 85, as co-investigator of the NIH funded Recommendations for Clinical Research undertaken by the Myasthenia Gravis Task Force. Fred's long and elegant life included being Captain of the Junior Varsity Football Team at Harvard and Treasurer of the Lampoon, skiing the Headwall at Tuckerman Ravine, winning the New York State Star Class Championship, being a founding member of the Cooperstown Planning Commission, President of the New York Thoracic Society, Practitioner of the Year, Medical Director of the Operating Rooms from 1992-1996, and co-authoring ""A Proud Heritage: an Informal History of Surgery at Columbia,"" with Drs. Frederic P. Herter and Kenneth A. Forde. He is survived by his sister Josie Lipman, his children Alfred IV, Lasell Bartlett, Alexander and Sumner, his stepson Adam Isles and his wife Hannah and their children Nina and Peter, and his loving wife Alexandra. A memorial service will be held on Wednesday, June 18 at 5pm at the Knickerbocker Club in New York.

2014-06-05T00:00:00Z,"GOODMAN--Roy. Beloved Pal. Dalia and I mourn the passing of my best friend Roy Goodman. Our friendship spanned 79 years from our childhood in the playgrounds of Central Park and school days at the Hunter Model School until yesterday when your courageous battle against Parkinson's Disease finally ended. During most of these years, there were few days we did not converse. A lifetime of friendship for two men who perhaps became closer than the brothers we never had. Roy was my brother in life. Roy was strong, intelligent, elegant, of infinite integrity with an amazing sense of humor and gift of oratory--second to none on the New York political scene. After college and graduate school, we served together as land-based Naval officers here in the City. Marriage came soon, and we served as ushers, reciprocating in each other's wedding ceremonies, and after that, Roy became the godfather of my three children, and I of his wonderful children: Claire, Leslie, and Randy. Roy was a born leader. I do not think he ever passed a year at any school without being elected president of the class. A decade after graduating from Harvard College and Harvard Business School, he successfully continued his electoral career winning 17 consecutive races for the New York State Senate. His only defeat during that time was when he ran for the mayoralty of New York City in 1977. Roy was a magnificent human being--a devoted husband, father, and grandfather. He was compassionate and kind. Roy and I spent much of our lives together, including many trips around the world. Roy--I miss you so much and will think of you every day. You were my hero at age six and still are today. Dalia sends love. Larry"

2014-06-05T00:00:00Z,"FRIEDMAN--Morton B. Mary C. Boyce, Dean of Columbia Engineering, and the faculty and staff of Columbia University's Fu Foundation School of Engineering and Applied Science mourn the passing of long-time professor and senior vice dean emeritus Morton B. Friedman. Mort, as he was known to everyone at the School and at the University, joined the Engineering faculty in 1956 and spent the next seven decades becoming the heart, soul, and collective memory of the School. Mort, an aerospace engineer and mathematician, received his BS, MS, and EngScD degrees from New York University. After a brief appointment at NYU as a research associate, he moved to Columbia Engineering, where he advanced through the academic ranks in the Department of Civil Engineering and Engineering Mechanics, appointed as full professor in 1966. In 1995, he was appointed vice dean, senior vice dean in 2010, and senior vice dean emeritus in 2012. Mort founded the Division of Mathematical Methods, the precursor to the applied mathematics component of what is now the Department of Applied Physics and Applied Mathematics, where he held a joint appointment. One of his earliest students in this program was Nobel Laureate Robert C. Merton BS'66. Mort was a brilliant mathematician with major contributions in the development of accelerated quadrature methods of linear integral equations, accelerated spectral analysis of compact operators, accelerated projection methods, and uniform asymptotic solutions of differential equations with an almost periodic coefficient. He and his students were the earliest developers of the boundary element method that has later found widespread application in many engineering and applied science disciplines. Mort had performed research for the National Science Foundation in variational methods for fluids; for NASA in the SST sonic boom; and for DARPA in large scaled computations. He had been a consultant to North Star Construction, Hudson Institute and Computer Usage Corp. for numerical analysis; Weidlinger Associates and Christensen, Inc., for applied mechanics; and Inference Corporation for Artificial Intelligence software. As vice dean, he was in the vanguard of engineering education leaders and helped shape the curriculum for many decades, from bringing engineering education into the first-year curriculum with project-based design and discipline-specific professional courses to creating a minors program in more than 20 liberal arts subjects, and from encouraging service learning to providing research opportunities for undergraduates with junior and senior faculty. Mort diligently served as mentor for a long line of faculty in various departments, a service of truly major importance to the school. He was also widely respected across the University for his insight, providing wise counsel on navigating the many complexities of a university. From 1981 to 1995, he served as chair of the Department of Civil Engineering and Engineering Mechanics and, from 1980 to 1991, also held the post of associate dean for instruction and research. In addition, he chaired the Executive Committee of the University Senate for several years. A former Fulbright Professor in applied mathematics and Field Instrumentation Scholar for the American Institute for Physics, he was recognized for his outstanding teaching by the Society of Columbia Graduates, which honored him with its Great Teacher Award in 1978. In 2012, the School recognized Mort for his lifelong devotion as a professor and senior vice dean, dedicating the conference room where he led so many meetings as the Morton B. Friedman Conference Room. We offer our sincere condolences to his family, his devoted and treasured wife of 58 years, Sandy; his loving children, Robert (Linda) and Lori (Jim Goldfinger); and his three beloved grandchildren, Chason, Asher, and Daden Goldfinger. To recognize Mort's lasting impact on Columbia and Columbia Engineering, a public memorial service is planned in the fall at St. Paul's Chapel. Mary Cunningham Boyce Dean of Engineering Morris A. and Alma Schapiro Professor"

2014-06-06T00:00:00Z,"LANIN--Mike. President of Howard Lanin Productions passed away in New York on April 14, 2014 at age 90. In 1952 Mike hired a 22-year old conductor for a nationwide Gershwin concert tour that ran for two seasons (1952-54) and played in 170 cities. His name: Lorin Maazel. It was the only orchestra in history dedicated exclusively to the music of one composer. Mike pursued his interest in George Gershwin in collaboration with Michael Feinstein. Mike, a well-known producer of shows for large corporations (IBM, Coca Cola, CBS, AT&T) hired star performers such as Harry Belafonte, Tony Bennett, Liza Minnelli, Diahann Carroll, Leslie Huggams, Lena Horne, Bob Hope, Duke Ellington, Ella Fitzgerald, Ray Bolger, Doc Severinsen and Bill Cosby among others. Memorable productions Mike presented include The Royal Danish Ballet in its US debut and The Conservatory Without Walls, a glittering event in honor of the country's greatest Afro-American musicians which launched the Duke Ellington Fellowship Fund at Yale University. Mike also served on the board of The Martha Graham School of Contemporary Dance. Mike Lanin was born in Philadelphia on March, 8, 1924, the son of the band leader Howard Lanin and the nephew of Lester Lanin, the internationally known society band leader. During World War II he enlisted in the U.S. Army Air Corps. At that time he discovered a young and talented pianist, still unknown, Bobby Short. They became friends for the rest of their lives. Mike was a graduate of Yale University where he was an imaginative caricaturist for the Yale Record. He is also remembered for his fond portrayal of Orson Welles' Citizen Kane. Mike was an elegant man both in appearance and in spirit. He was always courteous, soft spoken, never one to boast of his many achievements and of his friendships with famous artists. He was a loyal friend, a witty but considerate companion with a dry sense of humor. He was an entertaining guest. Mike has been called ""the dean of entertainment who pioneered the theme party, the pops concert, the anniversary revue and the multimedia production."" He was an avid reader and traveler. He kept homes in New York and Paris. He is survived by his wife of 45 years, the love of his life, Yvonne Constant-Lanin, a performer herself and a frequent guest (45 times) on the Johnny Carson Show. It was always a pleasure to see how much Mike enjoyed his wife's performances. He was proud of her interpretations of French and American songs. At her recitals he would greet friends with a radiant smile. He was also proud of Yvonne having been named ""Chevalier des Arts et des Lettres"", an important French cultural award. Other immediate survivors include his sister, Suzanne Lande, his adopted daughter Kristina Stufano from a previous marriage, his stepson, Gerard Pinguet and numerous grandchildren."

Len passed on June 2, 2014 of Parkinson's Disease related respiratory failure at his home in North Palm Beach. He was very happy until the end and died peacefully in his sleep. He is survived by his loving wife Lesley and his sons, Eric and Todd. At 19 years of age, Len was a very proud graduate of Harvard University's class of 1948. He went on to Albany Medical School. Len Lustgarten was a renowned Doctor of Internal Medicine in Manhattan for over 40 years with legions of adoring patients and friends. His one man internal medical practice was legendary. Len became Chief Resident of Lenox Hill Hospital in 1960. He went on to be widely recognized by his peers. His patients included many from the worlds of art, society, finance and, of course, some far more interesting characters. Len was named ""Best Doctor"" by New York Magazine during the 1990's in his area of specialty for consecutive years. He is credited for having started the practices and careers of many of todays top physicians in their respective fields. He was one of the first physicians to encounter AIDS and fought to educate the public as to its truths and fallacies. As the editor of The Medical Tribune and the Medical Director of several large pharmaceutical advertising agencies, he was at the forefront of a changing era. Dr. Lustgarten also taught Evolutionary Biology at Palm Beach Community College in Florida later in life. Len Lustgarten's Novel ""EUNUCH"" received overwhelming praise when it was released in 2008/ 2009 and was hailed as a groundbreaking fictional epic. It has since been recognized as an exceptional work of unique proportions, exploring previously uncharted territory. It is the author's message to the world and the embodiment of all that he believed and experienced in life. Most importantly, it is his gift to the future. It is his tribute to Darwin. As per Len's wishes, there will no funeral or services. However, there will be a party later this Summer so that we may all hoist a glass and laugh as we remember him and tell the stories. He would have felt right at home with all of you whom he loved. Our father embodied the Hippocratic Oath ""First Do No Harm"". That is his legacy.

2014-06-06T00:00:00Z,"FRIEDMAN--Morton B. Mary C. Boyce, Dean of Columbia Engineering, and the faculty and staff of Columbia University's Fu Foundation School of Engineering and Applied Science mourn the passing of long-time professor and senior vice dean emeritus Morton B. Friedman. Mort, as he was known to everyone at the School and at the University, joined the Engineering faculty in 1956 and spent the next seven decades becoming the heart, soul, and collective memory of the School. Mort, an aerospace engineer and mathematician, received his BS, MS, and EngScD degrees from New York University. After a brief appointment at NYU as a research associate, he moved to Columbia Engineering, where he advanced through the academic ranks in the Department of Civil Engineering and Engineering Mechanics, appointed as full professor in 1966. In 1995, he was appointed vice dean, senior vice dean in 2010, and senior vice dean emeritus in 2012. Mort founded the Division of Mathematical Methods, the precursor to the applied mathematics component of what is now the Department of Applied Physics and Applied Mathematics, where he held a joint appointment. One of his earliest students in this program was Nobel Laureate Robert C. Merton BS'66. Mort was a brilliant mathematician with major contributions in the development of accelerated quadrature methods of linear integral equations, accelerated spectral analysis of compact operators, accelerated projection methods, and uniform asymptotic solutions of differential equations with an almost periodic coefficient. He and his students were the earliest developers of the boundary element method that has later found widespread application in many engineering and applied science disciplines. Mort had performed research for the National Science Foundation in variational methods for fluids; for NASA in the SST sonic boom; and for DARPA in large scaled computations. He had been a consultant to North Star Construction, Hudson Institute and Computer Usage Corp. for numerical analysis; Weidlinger Associates and Christensen, Inc., for applied mechanics; and Inference Corporation for Artificial Intelligence software. As vice dean, he was in the vanguard of engineering education leaders and helped shape the curriculum for many decades, from bringing engineering education into the first-year curriculum with project-based design and discipline-specific professional courses to creating a minors program in more than 20 liberal arts subjects, and from encouraging service learning to providing research opportunities for undergraduates with junior and senior faculty. Mort diligently served as mentor for a long line of faculty in various departments, a service of truly major importance to the school. He was also widely respected across the University for his insight, providing wise counsel on navigating the many complexities of a university. From 1981 to 1995, he served as chair of the Department of Civil Engineering and Engineering Mechanics and, from 1980 to 1991, also held the post of associate dean for instruction and research. In addition, he chaired the Executive Committee of the University Senate for several years. A former Fulbright Professor in applied mathematics and Field Instrumentation Scholar for the American Institute for Physics, he was recognized for his outstanding teaching by the Society of Columbia Graduates, which honored him with its Great Teacher Award in 1978. In 2012, the School recognized Mort for his lifelong devotion as a professor and senior vice dean, dedicating the conference room where he led so many meetings as the Morton B. Friedman Conference Room. We offer our sincere condolences to his family, his devoted and treasured wife of 58 years, Sandy; his loving children, Robert (Linda) and Lori (Jim Goldfinger); and his three beloved grandchildren, Chason, Asher, and Daden Goldfinger. To recognize Mort's lasting impact on Columbia and Columbia Engineering, a public memorial service is planned in the fall at St. Paul's Chapel.

Professor Emeritus of Clinical Surgery and Special Lecturer at Columbia Presbyterian Medical Center. Revered for his integrity both as clinician and mentor, Fred's long and distinguished career in the Department of Surgery began in 1944 and continued until his retirement in 1992. Early in his career he co-authored with Drs. Arthur Voorhees and Arthur Blakemore the seminal paper on the development of synthetic vascular grafts. This work initiated the modern era of aortic aneur- ysm surgery. After a decade at the Bassett Hospital in Cooperstown, NY, Fred returned to Columbia, where he redefined the anatomy of the thymus gland and the importance of its complete removal in the surgical therapy for myasthenia gravis. This earned him an international reputation which continues to this day. His multiple publications on thymectomy lead to his appointment, at age 85, as co-investigator of the NIH funded Recommendations for Clinical Research undertaken by the Myasthenia Gravis Task Force. Fred's long and elegant life included being Captain of the Junior Varsity Football Team at Harvard and Treasurer of the Lampoon, skiing the Headwall at Tuckerman Ravine, winning the New York State Star Class Championship, being a founding member of the Cooperstown Planning Commission, President of the New York Thoracic Society, Practitioner of the Year, Medical Director of the Operating Rooms from 1992-1996, and co-authoring ""A Proud Heritage: an Informal History of Surgery at Columbia,"" with Drs.

2014-06-08T00:00:00Z,"STEWART--Ruth Ann. Ruth Ann Stewart, beloved wife of thirty years of historian David Levering Lewis, died of ovarian cancer on Friday morning, May 30. After three and half heroic years of struggle largely shielded from public awareness, Ruth chose to enter palliative/hospice care at our home rather than to undergo yet another chemotherapy cycle. She suffered minimal pain. She remained vitally engaged, responding to many written messages, receiving family, friends, professional colleagues, and sharing firm views about the state of our world and how to make it better, until her spirit waned in the last few days. A month earlier, three generations of Stewart family members shared her 72nd birthday. On Mother's Day, daughter Allegra and two generations of Lewises took her on a carriage ride through Central Park. She planned to attend both Wheaton College's commencement in Massachusetts, of which she was alumna and former trustee, and the Brooklyn Botanic Garden's annual Sakura Matsuri festival, whose devoted trustee she was also. From modest origins in Chicago's Hyde Park, where parents Elmer and Ann Stewart nurtured discipline and ambition, Ruth Ann (as she was invariably called by everyone except her husband) traveled remarkable distances geographically and professionally on the wings of high adventure, intelligence, administrative genius, and a personality that stunned her husband forever. From Chicago to her bachelors degree at Wheaton College, to an M.S. from Columbia University's school of library science, to associate director of the Schomburg Center for Research in Black Culture, to assistant director of publications of the New York Public Library during the transformative days of Vartan Gregorian, to Washington as Assistant Librarian of Congress for National Programs until Librarian Daniel Boorstin's retirement, after which she served as senior policy analyst in arts, humanities and social legislation at the Congressional Research Service. Recognized as a pioneer in the field of public arts policy, Rutgers University invited her to serve as clinical professor in its new Edward J. Bloustein School of Planning and Public Policy. During a decade of service as clinical professor of Public Policy at NYU's Robert F. Wagner's School of Public Service, she co-edited Understanding the Creative Sector in the United States (Rutgers 2008), now a benchmark in the field. Her life of Booker T. Washington's daughter, Portia (Doubleday 1977), contributed meaningfully to feminist biography. Ruth served as board member of the Smithsonian Institution's Cooper Hewitt National Design Museum and was a member of the Council on Foreign Relations. She is survived by husband David, daughter Allegra Stewart, brother Donald and sister-in-law Isabel Stewart of Chicago, nephews Jay of Washington and Carter Stewart of Columbus, Ohio, stepsons Eric of Berwyn, PA, and Jason Lewis of San Diego, CA, stepdaughter Allison Lewis of Washington and granddaughters Marissa and Natalie Wilson, and Stewart great nieces and nephews Nicole, Corinne, Jonathan, and Ulyses. Paternal aunt Yolande Bustos resides in California. Donations may be made in her name to Wheaton College and Brooklyn Botanic Garden. A bronze memorial plaque identifies Ruth's scarlet oak in the Brooklyn Botanic Garden. The place and date of her memorial service will be announced soon."

2014-06-08T00:00:00Z,"LUSTGARTEN--Leonard S, MD. Physician and Author. New York City/ Westhampton, NY and North Palm Beach, FL. Len passed on June 2, 2014 of Parkinson's Disease related respiratory failure at his home in North Palm Beach. He was very happy until the end and died peacefully in his sleep. He is survived by his loving wife Lesley and his sons, Eric and Todd. At 19 years of age, Len was a very proud graduate of Harvard University's class of 1948. He went on to Albany Medical School. Len Lustgarten was a renowned Doctor of Internal Medicine in Manhattan for over 40 years with legions of adoring patients and friends. His one man internal medical practice was legendary. Len became Chief Resident of Lenox Hill Hospital in 1960. He went on to be widely recognized by his peers. His patients included many from the worlds of art, society, finance and, of course, some far more interesting characters. Len was named ""Best Doctor"" by New York Magazine during the 1990's in his area of specialty for consecutive years. He is credited for having started the practices and careers of many of todays top physicians in their respective fields. He was one of the first physicians to encounter AIDS and fought to educate the public as to its truths and fallacies. As the editor of The Medical Tribune and the Medical Director of several large pharmaceutical advertising agencies, he was at the forefront of a changing era. Dr. Lustgarten also taught Evolutionary Biology at Palm Beach Community College in Florida later in life. Len Lustgarten's Novel ""EUNUCH"" received overwhelming praise when it was released in 2008/ 2009 and was hailed as a groundbreaking fictional epic. It has since been recognized as an exceptional work of unique proportions, exploring previously uncharted territory. It is the author's message to the world and the embodiment of all that he believed and experienced in life. Most importantly, it is his gift to the future. It is his tribute to Darwin. As per Len's wishes, there will no funeral or services. However, there will be a party later this Summer so that we may all hoist a glass and laugh as we remember him and tell the stories. He would have felt right at home with all of you whom he loved. Our father embodied the Hippocratic Oath ""First Do No Harm"". That is his legacy. In lieu of flowers or gifts, charitable contributions may be made to the following Charities: The Michael J. Fox Foundation for Parkinson's Research. The Lustgarten Foundation for Pancreatic Cancer and The Democratic National Committee. Please go to ""EUNUCH NOVEL"" at Facebook.com.

2014-06-08T00:00:00Z,"JARETZKI--Alfred III, MD. 94, of New York City and Essex, CT, died on May 29. Professor Emeritus of Clinical Surgery and Special Lecturer at Columbia Presbyterian Medical Center. Revered for his integrity both as clinician and mentor, Fred's long and distinguished career in the Department of Surgery began in 1944 and continued until his retirement in 1992. Early in his career he co-authored with Drs. Arthur Voorhees and Arthur Blakemore the seminal paper on the development of synthetic vascular grafts. This work initiated the modern era of aortic aneur- ysm surgery. After a decade at the Bassett Hospital in Cooperstown, NY, Fred returned to Columbia, where he redefined the anatomy of the thymus gland and the importance of its complete removal in the surgical therapy for myasthenia gravis. This earned him an international reputation which continues to this day. His multiple publications on thymectomy lead to his appointment, at age 85, as co-investigator of the NIH funded Recommendations for Clinical Research undertaken by the Myasthenia Gravis Task Force. Fred's long and elegant life included being Captain of the Junior Varsity Football Team at Harvard and Treasurer of the Lampoon, skiing the Headwall at Tuckerman Ravine, winning the New York State Star Class Championship, being a founding member of the Cooperstown Planning Commission, President of the New York Thoracic Society, Practitioner of the Year, Medical Director of the Operating Rooms from 1992-1996, and co-authoring ""A Proud Heritage: an Informal History of Surgery at Columbia,"" with Drs. Frederic P. Herter and Kenneth A. Forde. He is survived by his sister Josie Lipman, his children Alfred IV, Lasell Bartlett, Alexander and Sumner, his stepson Adam Isles and his wife Hannah and their children Nina and Peter, and his loving wife Alexandra. A memorial service will be held on Wednesday, June 18 at 5pm at the Knickerbocker Club in New York.

2014-06-08T00:00:00Z,"GOODMAN--Roy. Beloved Pal. Dalia and I mourn the passing of my best friend Roy Goodman. Our friendship spanned 79 years from our childhood in the playgrounds of Central Park and school days at the Hunter Model School until yesterday when your courageous battle against Parkinson's Disease finally ended. During most of these years, there were few days we did not converse. A lifetime of friendship for two men who perhaps became closer than the brothers we never had. Roy was my brother in life. Roy was strong, intelligent, elegant, of infinite integrity with an amazing sense of humor and gift of oratory--second to none on the New York political scene. After college and graduate school, we served together as land-based Naval officers here in the City. Marriage came soon, and we served as ushers, reciprocating in each other's wedding ceremonies, and after that, Roy became the godfather of my three children, and I of his wonderful children: Claire, Leslie, and Randy. Roy was a born leader. I do not think he ever passed a year at any school without being elected president of the class. A decade after graduating from Harvard College and Harvard Business School, he successfully continued his electoral career winning 17 consecutive races for the New York State Senate. His only defeat during that time was when he ran for the mayoralty of New York City in 1977. Roy was a magnificent human being--a devoted husband, father, and grandfather. He was compassionate and kind. Roy and I spent much of our lives together, including many trips around the world. Roy--I miss you so much and will think of you every day. You were my hero at age six and still are today. Dalia sends love. Larry"

Retiring as the Director of Health Services Division in 1980, he joined the United States Department of Justice INS as Director of the Office of Professional Responsibility where he was in charge of all internal criminal and administrative investigations for the INS. In a five year period he additionally conducted over 100 hallmark criminal civil rights and corruption prosecutions. Honors include the US Attorney for Washington DC Award for Excellence in Law Enforcement and the INS Commissioner's Award.

2014-06-11T00:00:00Z,"LOWENFELD--Andreas. The family of Professor Andreas Lowenfeld announces with sadness that he died June 9, 2014 in New York, less than two months after the death of his beloved wife of 51 years, Elena. He was a dedicated, devoted and loving father and grandfather. Professor Lowenfeld was a towering figure in the fields of public international law, trade and economic law, private international law, and international arbitration. He served on the NYU Law faculty for 47 years, influencing generations of lawyers, and continued to teach International Litigation and Arbitration and International Monetary System among other courses until as recently as Spring 2013. Professor Lowenfeld wrote more than 18 books and authoritative legal treatises and over 115 law review articles and argued before the United States Supreme Court, the Iran-U.S. Claims Tribunal, and the International Court of Justice in the Hague. He made landmark contributions to legal scholarship and practice on issues as varied as extraterritorial jurisdiction, international arbitration, international monetary transactions, trans-border child abduction, international monetary law, investor-state dispute settlement, economic sanctions, enforcement of foreign judgments, aviation law, sovereign immunity, international trade, and civil procedure. His most recent work was a comprehensive treatise on International Economic Law. An avid supporter of the interaction between academics and practitioners, he was frequently an arbitrator in international disputes, public and private. He served as a Reporter on two major projects of the American Law Institute and was a lecturer twice at the Hague Academy, first in 1979 and later in 1994. In the 1994 lectures, he proposed criteria for a global community free of strict legal rules and based instead upon what he termed ""reasonableness, not certainty."" One of the hallmarks of his work was his commitment to eliminating what he viewed as an unnecessary divide between public and private international law. In 2007, he was awarded the Manley O. Hudson Medal of the American Society of International Law for his lifelong achievements in the field of international law. Born in Berlin, Germany in 1930 to a family of German-Jewish doctors, he came to the U.S. as a refugee from Nazism at the age of 8. After graduation with distinction from Horace Mann School, Harvard College and Harvard Law School in 1955, he served in the U.S. Army and then went on to practice law with Hyde and de Vries in New York. He then served for five-and-a-half years in the Legal Adviser's Office of the U.S. Department of State under presidents John F. Kennedy and Lyndon Johnson. He provided strategic counsel to those presidents during the Cuban Missile Crisis; the Nuclear Test Ban Treaty; the so-called ""Chicken War,"" in which the U.S. and the European Common Market sparred over poultry tariffs; and the U.S. invasion of the Dominican Republic. He then served as a fellow for a year at the John F. Kennedy Institute of Politics at Harvard University before joining the NYU Law faculty in 1967. At NYU Law School, he was a beloved teacher and mentor, for which he was honored when the NYU Journal of International Law and Politics paid tribute to his extensive scholarship and profound influence on legal education, the U.S. courts, international and comparative law, and the world of private commercial transactions, at the 14th Annual Herbert and Rose Rubin International Law Symposium in April 2009. In addition to all his professional triumphs, Andy Lowenfeld was a great ""Renaissance man;"" he spoke multiple languages, traveled extensively, and had life-long interest in history, theater, and music. He is survived by his son Julian, his daughter Marianna and his grandchildren Mark, Diana, and Anna. Funeral services will be held on Friday, June 13th at 3:30pm at Frank E. Campbell, 1076 Madison Avenue, New York, NY. Contributions in his memory may be made to the NYU School of Law for a scholarship in his name."

2014-06-12T00:00:00Z,"LOWENFELD--Andreas. The family of Professor Andreas Lowenfeld announces with sadness that he died June 9, 2014 in New York, less than two months after the death of his beloved wife of 51 years, Elena. He was a dedicated, devoted and loving father and grandfather. Professor Lowenfeld was a towering figure in the fields of public international law, trade and economic law, private international law, and international arbitration. He served on the NYU Law faculty for 47 years, influencing generations of lawyers, and continued to teach International Litigation and Arbitration and International Monetary System among other courses until as recently as Spring 2013. Professor Lowenfeld wrote more than 18 books and authoritative legal treatises and over 115 law review articles and argued before the United States Supreme Court, the Iran-U.S. Claims Tribunal, and the International Court of Justice in the Hague. He made landmark contributions to legal scholarship and practice on issues as varied as extraterritorial jurisdiction, international arbitration, international monetary transactions, trans-border child abduction, international monetary law, investor-state dispute settlement, economic sanctions, enforcement of foreign judgments, aviation law, sovereign immunity, international trade, and civil procedure. His most recent work was a comprehensive treatise on International Economic Law. An avid supporter of the interaction between academics and practitioners, he was frequently an arbitrator in international disputes, public and private. He served as a Reporter on two major projects of the American Law Institute and was a lecturer twice at the Hague Academy, first in 1979 and later in 1994. In the 1994 lectures, he proposed criteria for a global community free of strict legal rules and based instead upon what he termed ""reasonableness, not certainty."" One of the hallmarks of his work was his commitment to eliminating what he viewed as an unnecessary divide between public and private international law. In 2007, he was awarded the Manley O. Hudson Medal of the American Society of International Law for his lifelong achievements in the field of international law. Born in Berlin, Germany in 1930 to a family of German-Jewish doctors, he came to the U.S. as a refugee from Nazism at the age of 8. After graduation with distinction from Horace Mann School, Harvard College and Harvard Law School in 1955, he served in the U.S. Army and then went on to practice law with Hyde and de Vries in New York. He then served for five-and-a-half years in the Legal Adviser's Office of the U.S. Department of State under presidents John F. Kennedy and Lyndon Johnson. He provided strategic counsel to those presidents during the Cuban Missile Crisis; the Nuclear Test Ban Treaty; the so-called ""Chicken War,"" in which the U.S. and the European Common Market sparred over poultry tariffs; and the U.S. invasion of the Dominican Republic. He then served as a fellow for a year at the John F. Kennedy Institute of Politics at Harvard University before joining the NYU Law faculty in 1967. At NYU Law School, he was a beloved teacher and mentor, for which he was honored when the NYU Journal of International Law and Politics paid tribute to his extensive scholarship and profound influence on legal education, the U.S. courts, international and comparative law, and the world of private commercial transactions, at the 14th Annual Herbert and Rose Rubin International Law Symposium in April 2009. In addition to all his professional triumphs, Andy Lowenfeld was a great ""Renaissance man;"" he spoke multiple languages, traveled extensively, and had life-long interest in history, theater, and music. He is survived by his son Julian, his daughter Marianna and his grandchildren Mark, Diana, and Anna. Funeral services will be held on Friday, June 13th at 3:30pm at Frank E. Campbell, 1076 Madison Avenue, New York, NY. Contributions in his memory may be made to the NYU School of Law for a scholarship in his name."

2014-06-13T00:00:00Z,"WATERMAN--Judith. Painter and feminist, died quietly Thursday, June 5, 2014 with her partner Irena Klepfisz at her side in the Brooklyn home they've shared since June 1979. Born on August 19, 1936 in Barrington, IL Judy came to NY in 1961 and studied with Theodoros Stamos at the Art Students League and with Linda Nochlin at Hunter College where she received her MA in art history. She had many interests, was especially drawn to architecture, wrote her MA thesis on South Carolina barns, and painted and photographed rocks, marble and water. A voracious reader, she followed closely Second Wave writers and political journalists covering the Bush presidency and the Iraq war. She was devoted to the writings of Jane Jacobs, Ada Louise Huxtable, Robert Caro and the legal columnist Linda Greenhouse. Passionately committed to her art, she painted during the day and worked paid jobs in the afternoons and evenings. For decades she scavenged dumpsters at night for wood for stretchers for her wall-sized paintings. She received a New York State CAPS grant and taught art, art history and women's studies at Russell Sage, Fairleigh Dickenson, Vermont College and elsewhere. She exhibited in the Selinas and Third Street Galleries, Aldrich Museum, 55 Mercer, among others, and her work is in the collections of Finch College Museum, Albert Johnson Museum (Cornell College), Russell Sage College and Staten Island College. Through NYC's CETA arts program, Judy painted public murals and led art classes for seniors, her favorite work. In the 1990's she became active in her UFT chapter and, through DC37 and the Consortium for Workers Education, taught ESL and GED night classes to restaurant and hospital workers who spoke little or no English and for whom she created original stories and sketches. Of her teaching, one supervisor once said: ""Judy can teach anything."" Due to illness, she stopped working in 2010. She is mourned by her sister Sue Cooper, brother Tod Waterman, sister-in-law Lise Shellenback, nieces Hayley and Cooper, and life-long friends Janet Yacht, Susan Goldberg, Cheryl Rhuman, Marty Dolin and Julia and Isaiah Zagar, and by her devoted and loving partner Irena Klepfisz."

2014-06-13T00:00:00Z,"WIENER--Geoffrey Richard, of Larchmont, NY, died Friday, June 6, 2014, surrounded by his children at White Plains Hospital in White Plains, NY from complications of pneumonia. He was 95. Geoffrey is survived by his four children: Margaret (Steven Goldstein), Geoffrey Jr. (Wendy Banner), Robert (Katherine Clark) and Alison (George Bryant); 10 grandchildren: Katherine, Elizabeth, Alexander, and Maura Goldstein, Arrol and Corinn Bryant, and Daniel Wiener, Stephen Gordon, Ellie Wiener, and Olivia Wiener. His wife of more than 58 years, Margaret, died in 2008. Geoffrey was born October 26, 1918 in New York City, the son of Ernest Wiener and Claire S. Wiener. From a young age and throughout his life, he loved sailing. Geoff was a World War II veteran, serving as an Army officer in the South Pacific. His desire to help those less fortunate led to a career as a social worker, with Masters and Doctoral degrees from Columbia University School of Social Work, and made him a fierce civil rights and anti-poverty crusader. He served as executive director of Hamilton Madison House in lower Manhattan where he spent 16 years leading the settlement house and contributed more than 50 years of service, including as a Board member. He also taught at Hunter College School of Social Work and at the State University of New York, Downstate Medical Center, and served for 10 years as executive director of Abbott House, a child welfare, foster care and adoption organization. In retirement he volunteered with the International Executive Service Corps, with the Larchmont/Mamaroneck Local Summit, and strongly supported the Mamaroneck Hispanic Resource Center. He loved learning, traveling and his family, including the family dogs. Geoffrey was fond of the ""Winnie the Pooh"" books and had a well-known sweet tooth (especially for ice cream). His bear hugs, even at age 95, were strong - he put all his love into every embrace. In recent years, he loved to walk in Manor Park and weekly visited the Larchmont Senior Center, where he became a prolific painter. His Coolidge Street home has become a veritable art gallery. His family would like to thank his live-in aides Cutie Fraser and Auda Moncion, Karen Schwartz and her staff, and Dr. Steven Meixler and the nurses and staff at White Plains Hospital. He was well-loved and will be missed by all who knew him. Donations in his memory should be made to Hamilton Madison House, 253 South St., New York, NY 10002."

Our sense of loss is immense, both for the enormous void left in his adored family and for the world-changing work in which he was engaged that will be left incomplete by his passing. Richard was a member of our University community for more than 30 years and served on our Board of Trustees for two decades. A caring and compassionate family physician in his home state of Maine, he was a superb Trustee who believed passionately in the importance of basic and patient-based research, and in the ability of scientific advances to save human lives. Richard gave generously of his enormous talents to our Board's Hospital and Scientific Affairs Committees, and our Trustees, faculty members, students, and administrators benefited greatly from their interactions with him. A devoted humanitarian, Richard worked to alleviate human suffering and improve human welfare through his longtime service as chair of the U.S. advisory board of Doctors Without Borders and of the Rockefeller Brothers Fund, where he carried on the work begun by his father and uncles. Richard was a pioneer in recognizing that the Internet could help doctors and patients share crucial data, with the ultimate goal of improving medical diagnoses and health care delivery--ideas that are routine today, but were prescient when he created the Health Commons Institute in 1994. Although he left our Board in 2006, Richard maintained an active interest in the work of the University. We will miss him very much.

As a graduate student at the University of Chicago, he fused human lymphocytes to mouse myeloma tumor cells and proved that the resulting hybrid cells made both human and mouse immunoglobulins. This work, published in Nature in 1973, laid the groundwork for the development of monoclonal antibodies. In 1975, Kohler and Milstein followed up on his work which led to their receipt of the 1984 Nobel Prize in Medicine. Dr Schwaber continued his research into genetic causes of immunodeficiency. In 1992 he was awarded the Lifetime Achievement Award from the Jeffrey Modell Foundation. Cell lines from patients with primary immunodeficiency that he developed were donated to the Coriell Institute for Medical Research in Camden, New Jersey. He worked at Harvard Medical School, Hahnemann and Jefferson University. Born in Evanston, Illinois, he was the third of four sons. He is survived by his wife, Susan Hoch MD, his sons, Jason and Jeff, and four grandchildren.

Jack was a man who focused on life's simple pleasures and remained true throughout. A sunny day on the golf course, a good hand at the card table with friends, and always most important to him, was the time spent with his wife and partner in life, Marcia, and their children and grandchildren. Loving and loyal as a husband to Marcia, father to Larry, Gary, Donna, Janet, Bobby and Darcy. ""Pappa"" to Samantha, Ryan, Max, Katie, Nick, Taylor, Jake and Remi. Jack was born on June 27, 1932 to Betty and Lou Levy, and raised in Brooklyn with his three siblings Arthur, Sandy, and Michael. He and his brother Arthur became business partners and grew the coat manufacturing company of Lou Levy and Sons into an enterprise that is now in it's fourth generation run by the partnership of Jack's two sons and nephews, Donald and Richard Levy. He was an example to all in courage and determination; he taught us to never quit, to fight for life, and that staying true to the course was the answer to adversity. He led by example and needed few words to convey the goodness within. Always philanthropic, Jack partnered with his doctor and dear friend, Mark Urken, to create Thanc, which has become one of the nation's leading foundations for thyroid, head and neck cancer research and patient care. The family has requested that any donations in Jack's memory be made to: Thancfoundation.org.

His parents, Joseph and Annette Henry Alfandre, moved to DC when Robert was eight. Encouraged by his teachers at Anacostia High School to apply, Robert became the first of his family to attend college, choosing Swarthmore when Princeton and Yale offered later matriculation dates. At the end of his freshman year, he enlisted in the US Navy, returning to school in the fall of 1946. Upon graduation from college in 1949, he attended the Johns Hopkins School of Advanced International Study on a fellowship and received a Master of Arts degree in 1951. After graduate school, his first position was with the Central Intelligence Agency, where he was employed in operations concerning Western Europe. After five years with the CIA, he resigned his position to pursue a career in real estate development with his father and brother Jack. He prospered in the real estate and construction industry in the Washington area, developing his own companies. He married Priscilla Buck, a college classmate, in 1951. They have two daughters, Dominique (Thomas Palmer) and Nicole, and four grandchildren, Carl and Claudia Halbreiner and Luned and Rosamund Palmer (Miles Portek). Alfandre became a force in the DC cultural community, serving on the board of the Woodrow Wilson House and opening his Kalorama Road home to myriad non-profits for fundraising events. He also served for many years on the Board of the Whitman Walker Clinic in DC and was a leader in fighting AIDS, raising millions of dollars for AIDS research and establishing residences and support systems for victims of AIDS in DC and Key West, FL. He founded the Carroll Sledz House at the Clinic in honor of his partner Carroll. He organized and hosted the first Human Rights Campaign Fund dinner. Alfandre maintained residences in DC, Key West, Fire Island and Paris, where he pursued his deep love of French culture. He was an active member of the French Heritage Society, as well as the National Trust for Historic Preservation. He was named a Knight of the Order of St. John. Robert is also survived by his brother Jack Alfandre and devoted grandchildren, nieces and nephews; also by his friend Sidney Martin. Memorials to the breadth of this life lived well will be held in Fire Island (August 17) and in Key West. Visiting hours will be at Joseph Gawler's Sons 6-8pm Friday, June 20th.

2014-06-16T00:00:00Z,"MCKINLEY--John Key, passed peacefully in the comfort of his home surrounded by his loving family in Dallas, on the morning of June 12, 2014. He was born in Tuscaloosa, Alabama on March 24, 1920 to a family of educators. His father, Vergil Parks, McKinley was a college professor, and his mother, Mary Emma Key McKinley, was an elementary education school teacher. John was educated in Tuscaloosa, graduating from Tuscaloosa High School in 1937. Living on campus, he was able to walk out the door to The University of Alabama where he earned a B.S. degree in Chemical Engineering, and a M.S. degree in Organic Chemistry in four years. While in college, he was a cadet in the ROTC, rising to the rank of Cadet Colonel, and Brigade Commander. He was inducted into Tau Beta Pi, and the Scabbard and Blade Society, and was a member of The University of Alabama (Capstone) Engineering Society. Immediately after receiving his M.S., he joined Texaco on May 29, 1941, as a chemical engineer engaged in grease research at the Port Arthur refinery in Texas. As a result of the escalating conflict in Europe, on August 15, 1941 he was called to active service as a reserve officer with the rank of Second Lieutenant in the Army. For four and a half years during World War II he wore the Army uniform. The Army ordered the Alabama boy to Newfoundland and put him on skis. After Pearl Harbor he reported to Fort Bragg for additional training, and ultimately shipped out to England on the Queen Mary. After D-Day, in August of 1944, he landed on Utah Beach and fought across France, Belgium and Germany. He saw action in numerous battles, including the Battle of the Bulge as the Allied troops advanced through Western Europe and onto Berlin. As a result of his valor in a pivotal battle for the Roer River, he received the Bronze Star and eventually rose to the rank of Major. Upon returning to Port Arthur and Texaco, he met the love of his life, Helen Grace Heare. After only one date, John proposed and soon after they married on July 19, 1946. They were blessed with two sons John Key McKinley, Jr., and Mark Charles McKinley. Over the next 45 years, he held numerous positions worldwide with Texaco. In the research and development area he held over a dozen patents for petroleum additives and grease components. He continued his education, and graduated from the Advanced Management Program at Harvard University in 1962. In 1971 he was elected President of Texaco, and in 1980, the Board of Directors elected him as Chairman, President and CEO of Texaco. He served in that capacity until he retired from Texaco in 1986 after 45 years of service, and he always cherished his Texaco family. John later served as a consultant to ChevronTexaco Corporation. John and Helen spent their ensuing years enjoying their friends and family. They enjoyed their homes in Darien, Connecticut and Tuscaloosa, Alabama, but their most cherished memories were always at the Steerhead Ranch in Buffalo, Wyoming. More than anything, he loved having people up to the ranch to enjoy a taste of the ""McKinley Culture"" and a ""Ride for the Brand"" on the Eastern Slope of The Bighorn Mountains. Above all else John, Dad, Pops, aka JK will be remembered as a turtle with a hard shell and a soft heart. Born into a family of educators, he was always trying to teach those around him. He was a proud American patriot, a teacher, a mentor, a gentle giant, and he always noticed the efforts of others. John was a marksman, and if he aimed at a target, he usually hit it. John served on the Board of Directors of many companies including Texaco Inc., Federated Department Stores, Burlington Industries, Martin Marietta Corporation, Merck & Co., Inc., Manufacturers Hanover Trust Company, Manufacturers Hanover Corporation, and Apollo Computer, Inc. He also served on the Board of Directors of organizations including the Metropolitan Opera, The Peregrine Fund, The Americas Society, Business Council for Effective Literacy and Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center. John received Honorary Doctorate of Law degrees from both the University of Alabama in 1972 and Troy University in 1974. He was also active in various civic and professional organizations, including the Brookings Council, the Business Council Washington DC, and Presidents Commission on Executive Exchange. He was awarded the George Washington Honor Medal by the Freedoms Foundation and the Gold Medal by the National Institute of Social Sciences. In 1982 he was inducted into the Alabama Business Hall of Fame, and in 1983 was installed in the Alabama Academy of Honor. In 1984 he was given The American Eagle Award by the Invest-In-America National Council, and the Wallace Award by the American-Scottish Foundation. Also, in 1984 the Belgian Government presented John with the Commandeur de L'Ordre de la Courrone, the highest decoration awarded to a corporate leader in recognition of significant contributions to Belgium's economic sector. In 1987, John and Helen McKinley established the Merrymac McKinley Foundation, Inc., a charitable organization designed to benefit charities, educational institutions, and to provide scholarships and awards to individual students, educators and non-faculty members. Annual endowments and donations (creating over 30 scholarships and recognition awards) have been made to The University of Alabama, Troy University, Shelton State University, Southern Methodist University, Texas A&M Foundation, Trinity University, as well as a host of other worthy causes. Both John and Helen proudly served as Directors, along with other members of the McKinley family. Despite all of John's great accomplishments, the partnership of 55 years with Helen was his greatest. They were a great team. He is predeceased in death by his parents, Vergil Parks and Mary Emma, his brother, Richard, and his wife Helen Grace. He is survived by his two sons John and Mark, his daughter-in-law Karla, and his three grandchildren Key, Madison, and Charlie. A memorial service is scheduled for Wednesday, June 18, 2014 at 2:00pm at the Steerhead Ranch in Buffalo, Wyoming. The family would love for all friends to send their photos and memories to Rememberingjohnkeymckinley@mkresources.com. In lieu of flowers, donations may be made to the Merrymac-McKinley Foundation Gift Fund at The University of Alabama; the McKinley Award Fund at Troy University, or the Tip of The Spear Foundation.

Our sense of loss is immense, both for the enormous void left in his adored family and for the world-changing work in which he was engaged that will be left incomplete by his passing. Richard was a member of our University community for more than 30 years and served on our Board of Trustees for two decades. A caring and compassionate family physician in his home state of Maine, he was a superb Trustee who believed passionately in the importance of basic and patient-based research, and in the ability of scientific advances to save human lives. Richard gave generously of his enormous talents to our Board's Hospital and Scientific Affairs Committees, and our Trustees, faculty members, students, and administrators benefited greatly from their interactions with him. A devoted humanitarian, Richard worked to alleviate human suffering and improve human welfare through his longtime service as chair of the U.S. advisory board of Doctors Without Borders and of the Rockefeller Brothers Fund, where he carried on the work begun by his father and uncles. Richard was a pioneer in recognizing that the Internet could help doctors and patients share crucial data, with the ultimate goal of improving medical diagnoses and health care delivery--ideas that are routine today, but were prescient when he created the Health Commons Institute in 1994. Although he left our Board in 2006, Richard maintained an active interest in the work of the University. We will miss him very much. We extend our heartfelt condolences to his wife, Nancy; his children, Clayton and Rebecca; his stepsons, Maxwell and Griffin; his three grandchildren; his siblings, David, Abby, Neva, Peggy, and Eileen; and his father, our cherished Honorary Chair and Life Trustee David Rockefeller, who has been a visionary leader and inspiration to all of us at The Rockefeller University for more than 70 years.

Jack was a man who focused on life's simple pleasures and remained true throughout. A sunny day on the golf course, a good hand at the card table with friends, and always most important to him, was the time spent with his wife and partner in life, Marcia, and their children and grandchildren. Loving and loyal as a husband to Marcia, father to Larry, Gary, Donna, Janet, Bobby and Darcy. ""Pappa"" to Samantha, Ryan, Max, Katie, Nick, Taylor, Jake and Remi.

He and his brother Arthur became business partners and grew the coat manufacturing company of Lou Levy and Sons into an enterprise that is now in it's fourth generation run by the partnership of Jack's two sons and nephews, Donald and Richard Levy. He was an example to all in courage and determination; he taught us to never quit, to fight for life, and that staying true to the course was the answer to adversity. He led by example and needed few words to convey the goodness within. Always philanthropic, Jack partnered with his doctor and dear friend, Mark Urken, to create Thanc, which has become one of the nation's leading foundations for thyroid, head and neck cancer research and patient care.

Safra and Co. in Sao Paulo and New York, companies that specialize in a wide array of investments around the world. He was a kind, gentle, humble giant in philanthropy on behalf of Jewish and secular education, medical research and undergraduate education at Yeshiva University. Moise and Chella Safra were honored in 1992 at the inaugural dinner of YU's Sephardic Council of Overseers and in 2006 they established the Chella and Moise Safra Chair in Obstetrics and Gynecology and Women's Health at YU's Albert Einstein College of Medicine to expand critical scientific investigations in the area of women's health. He regarded Yeshiva University as the perfect balance of Torah and secular education and stated he was continuously impressed with all that YU does for humanity. May the memory of this great humanitarian serve as an inspiration and a source of enduring blessings for all who knew him. Heartfelt condolences are extended to Mrs. Chella Cohen Safra and their children: Jacob, Azuri, Edmundo, Esther and Olga and their spouses and grandchildren. Min hashamayim tenuhamu.

2014-06-17T00:00:00Z,"ROCKEFELLER--Dr. Richard G. The trustees, staff, and grantees of the Rockefeller Brothers Fund (RBF) mourn the death of Dr. Richard G. Rockefeller, a former trustee, board chair, and very dear friend. Richard served on the RBF board of trustees for 23 years, starting in 1989. He was chair of the board from 2006 2013 and was an advisory trustee at the time of his tragic death. Richard was an exceptional human being -- a person of great intellect and curiosity, profound common sense, wit, and compassion. He gave generously and completely to all of those with whom he worked and all he met. He was a gifted, caring, and joyful leader. During his decades of service to the RBF he engaged deeply in our philanthropic efforts to help improve democratic practice, advance solutions to climate change, and build durable peace in regions afflicted by conflict. His appetite for knowledge was insatiable and he most enjoyed learning from the leaders and staff of grantee organizations, whether here in the United States or abroad. He immediately touched all those he met, who felt his genuine respect and curiosity about them and their work. Richard was a leader in his generation of the Rockefeller family, continuing the principled philanthropy of his father, David, and uncles who established the RBF in 1940, while responding to the needs of a profoundly transformed world. As chair, Richard thoughtfully guided members of the next generation of family leaders to assume leadership and to shape the future of the RBF to suit the challenges of their time. Richard's work at the RBF complemented his many other philanthropic activities -- a deep concern for environmental stewardship that motivated his leadership of the Maine Coast Heritage Trust and the Sargasso Sea Alliance; a devotion to science which guided his 30-year association with The Rockefeller University; and a love of humanity which inspired his own practice of family medicine, his founding of the Health Commons Institute, and his long service with Doctors Without Borders. In recent years, Richard was a leader in the exploration of new treatments for those afflicted with severe trauma. Our hearts go out to all the members of his family, especially his wife Nancy, children Clayton and Rebecca, and their children; stepchildren Maxwell and Griffin; his father David, all his siblings, and the extended Rockefeller family. All of us who knew Richard loved him. And his love was felt by countless others around the world who never met him. Valerie Rockefeller Wayne, Chair Stephen Heintz, President"

2014-06-18T00:00:00Z,"KOENIG--Julian. April 22, 1921 - June 12, 2014. The One Club mourns the loss of Julian Koenig, esteemed member of the Creative Hall of Fame. Julian was inducted in 1966 to the Copywriters Hall of Fame, as it was known then. Born in New York, April 22, 1921, he graduated from Dartmouth and then studied at Columbia Law School. Julian was an eccentric intellectual who created a new style of copywriting that went on to define advertising's creative revolution. It was smart, simple and accessible to the public--writing that neither exaggerated nor overpromised. Contemporary writers compared him to Holden Caulfield, for being aloof and reserved in a business that favored popular culture. Julian is best known for his iconic work for Volkswagen while at Doyle Dane Bernbach. Working with art director Helmut Krone, he created the groundbreaking ads ""Think Small"" and ""Lemon,"" which came to define the new style of advertising. Julian and Fred Papert launched a new agency with George Lois called Papert Koenig Lois where they created award-winning work for Wolfschmidt Vodka, Xerox, Peugeot and Allarest, proving as he once said that good taste is good for business. Many well-known advertising talents started their careers at PKL, including Carl Ally and Sam Scali, who went on to start their own agencies. Fred Papert and Julian remained good friends throughout their lives and made annual trips to Saratoga for the races. During his lifetime, Julian amassed a large coterie of colorful characters, including sportswriter Jimmy Breslin, Senator Jacob Javits, and his own alter ego, Groucho Marx. Among his many contributions was the naming of ""Earth Day"" in 1969, for a committee organized to bring environmental awareness to the public. The One Club offers heartfelt sympathy to Julian's children and grandchildren. (Photo credit, Carl Fischer)"

2014-06-18T00:00:00Z,"ROCKEFELLER--Dr. Richard G. The trustees, staff, and grantees of the Rockefeller Brothers Fund (RBF) mourn the death of Dr. Richard G. Rockefeller, a former trustee, board chair, and very dear friend. Richard served on the RBF board of trustees for 23 years, starting in 1989. He was chair of the board from 2006 2013 and was an advisory trustee at the time of his tragic death. Richard was an exceptional human being -- a person of great intellect and curiosity, profound common sense, wit, and compassion. He gave generously and completely to all of those with whom he worked and all he met. He was a gifted, caring, and joyful leader. During his decades of service to the RBF he engaged deeply in our philanthropic efforts to help improve democratic practice, advance solutions to climate change, and build durable peace in regions afflicted by conflict. His appetite for knowledge was insatiable and he most enjoyed learning from the leaders and staff of grantee organizations, whether here in the United States or abroad. He immediately touched all those he met, who felt his genuine respect and curiosity about them and their work. Richard was a leader in his generation of the Rockefeller family, continuing the principled philanthropy of his father, David, and uncles who established the RBF in 1940, while responding to the needs of a profoundly transformed world. As chair, Richard thoughtfully guided members of the next generation of family leaders to assume leadership and to shape the future of the RBF to suit the challenges of their time. Richard's work at the RBF complemented his many other philanthropic activities -- a deep concern for environmental stewardship that motivated his leadership of the Maine Coast Heritage Trust and the Sargasso Sea Alliance; a devotion to science which guided his 30-year association with The Rockefeller University; and a love of humanity which inspired his own practice of family medicine, his founding of the Health Commons Institute, and his long service with Doctors Without Borders. In recent years, Richard was a leader in the exploration of new treatments for those afflicted with severe trauma. Our hearts go out to all the members of his family, especially his wife Nancy, children Clayton and Rebecca, and their children; stepchildren Maxwell and Griffin; his father David, all his siblings, and the extended Rockefeller family. All of us who knew Richard loved him. And his love was felt by countless others around the world who never met him. Valerie Rockefeller Wayne, Chair Stephen Heintz, President"

2014-06-20T00:00:00Z,"ALFANDRE--Robert Nelson, born June 9, 1927 in New York, NY, died at his home in Washington, DC on June 12th. He is survived by his wife, Priscilla Alfandre. His parents, Joseph and Annette Henry Alfandre, moved to DC when Robert was eight. Encouraged by his teachers at Anacostia High School to apply, Robert became the first of his family to attend college, choosing Swarthmore when Princeton and Yale offered later matriculation dates. At the end of his freshman year, he enlisted in the US Navy, returning to school in the fall of 1946. Upon graduation from college in 1949, he attended the Johns Hopkins School of Advanced International Study on a fellowship and received a Master of Arts degree in 1951. After graduate school, his first position was with the Central Intelligence Agency, where he was employed in operations concerning Western Europe. After five years with the CIA, he resigned his position to pursue a career in real estate development with his father and brother Jack. He prospered in the real estate and construction industry in the Washington area, developing his own companies. He married Priscilla Buck, a college classmate, in 1951. They have two daughters, Dominique (Thomas Palmer) and Nicole, and four grandchildren, Carl and Claudia Halbreiner and Luned and Rosamund Palmer (Miles Portek). Alfandre became a force in the DC cultural community, serving on the board of the Woodrow Wilson House and opening his Kalorama Road home to myriad non-profits for fundraising events. He also served for many years on the Board of the Whitman Walker Clinic in DC and was a leader in fighting AIDS, raising millions of dollars for AIDS research and establishing residences and support systems for victims of AIDS in DC and Key West, FL. He founded the Carroll Sledz House at the Clinic in honor of his partner Carroll. He organized and hosted the first Human Rights Campaign Fund dinner. Alfandre maintained residences in DC, Key West, Fire Island and Paris, where he pursued his deep love of French culture. He was an active member of the French Heritage Society, as well as the National Trust for Historic Preservation. He was named a Knight of the Order of St. John. Robert is also survived by his brother Jack Alfandre and devoted grandchildren, nieces and nephews; also by his friend Sidney Martin. Memorials to the breadth of this life lived well will be held in Fire Island (August 17) and in Key West. Visiting hours will be at Joseph Gawler's Sons 6-8pm Friday, June 20th. The funeral will be held on Saturday, June 21 at 11am at All Souls Church in DC with burial at Oak Hill Cemetery. The family extends their heartfelt gratitude to the staffs of Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center, NY Presbyterian Hospital and the home carers, all of whom cared for him through his long final illness. Donations to the Fire Island Pines Free Clinic would be greatly appreciated in lieu of flowers."
2014-06-20T00:00:00Z,"ANANIA--Gregory, of New York, NY passed away on Wednesday, June 18, 2014, after a long battle against cancer. Gregory was born on March 23, 1985, and grew up in Edgemont, NY. He is survived by his parents Sheryl and Michael, his twin brother, Matt, and his sister, Justine. Gregory graduated Edgemont High School in 2003, where he was a member of the varsity football and golf teams. Upon graduating high school, Gregory went on to Babson College in Wellesley, MA, where he graduated in 2007 with a degree in Business Administration. Just prior to graduation, Gregory was diagnosed with a rare form of cancer Atypical Thymic Carcinoid. He had already accepted a job with the firm of Perelson Weiner in New York City as a staff accountant and the firm graciously deferred his start date until he completed his treatments. During this time, Gregory underwent chemo- therapy, two surgeries and radiation but somehow found the energy and will to study for the CPA exam, and when he started his job at Perelson Weiner a year later, he had already passed all four parts of the CPA. Despite never ridding his body of cancer and having to undergo countless treatments, over the next six years Gregory never stopped living life to its fullest. He worked diligently, traveled, played golf passionately, worked out endlessly, looked forward to spending time with his family and friends, and always had time to brighten the lives of others with his infectious grin and kindness. Gregory inspired everyone whose lives he touched, and while he is missed, he is not gone. Contributions in Greg's memory can be made to Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center (www.mskcc.org or the Caring for Carcinoid Foundation (www.caringforcarcinoid.org) Service today (Friday), 11am at Central Synagogue."
