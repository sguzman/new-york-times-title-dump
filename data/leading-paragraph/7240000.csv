Still, I cannot help feeling that I'm being naive. But I'll just put that feeling behind the stronger one that Mosley may really stick to his word this time. What strengthens that thought is that Todt has announced he is running for the presidency, and Todt is not the kind to change his mind or to announce that kind of thing without being serious about it."

Frank's is the brainchild of Hannah Barry, an up-and-coming local gallery owner whose Peckham Pavilion drew good notices at the Venice Biennale.This is the second year in a row that Barry has staged an annual sculpture show in the parking structure, but this year she wanted to give visitors a place to sit and refresh.

Its eponymous co-proprietor, Frank Boxer (a grandson of the noted magazine editor and cartoonist Mark Boxer and the food writer Arabella Boxer), earned his food and drink chops at the renowned gastropub the Anchor and Hope and at Italo, the London deli owned by his father, Charlie Boxer.

2009-07-17T00:00:00Z,"TASHJIAN--Armen Haig, Jr.,of Wellesley Hills, MA and Tucson, AZ, age 77, on July 3, 2009. Armen H. Tashjian, Jr. was born in Cleveland, Ohio, the son of the late Armen H. Tashjian and Flora Beardslee Tashjian. He graduated from Phillips Exeter Academy, attended Yale University, and received an M.D. from Harvard Medical School in 1957. Upon completing his internship and residency, he was a research fellow from 1959-1961 at the National Institutes of Health in Bethesda, MD. Dr. Tashjian was Professor of Biological Chemistry and Molecular Pharmacology, emeritus, at Harvard Medical School and Professor of Toxicology, emeritus, at the Harvard School of Public Health. He founded the Department of Molecular and Cellular Toxicology at the Harvard School of Public Health. Under his guidance, this department was at the forefront of discovering mechanisms of toxicity in environmental chemicals and therapeutic agents. Teaching graduate students and postdoctoral fellows was a delight and reward to Dr. Tashjian. During the 1990s he became deeply interested in drug discovery and development and became a consultant to the pharmaceutical industry, biotechnology companies and venture capital investors. This became another career for him, at the interface between pharmacology, toxicology, and business. Dr. Tashjian was a recipient of the Astwood Award for basic scientific discoveries in skeletal biology and neuroendocrinology, and of the Endocrine Society's Distinguished Leadership Award. He was Deputy Editor of Principles of Pharmacology: The Pathophysiologic Basis for Drug Therapy, which has become a leading text for mechanism-based teaching of pharmacology worldwide. He loved bow ties, sailing, good food, Westport Point, the desert, the ocean, mountains, Arizona, Israel, traveling to far-flung and remote places, and learning about other cultures. He was passionate, curious, and enthusiastic in his approach to every experience. Armen Tashjian is survived by his wife, Carol; his daughters Elizabeth (Uri Lowenstein) of Salt Lake City, Amy (Donald Brown) of New York City, and Victoria (Robert Kramer) of DePere, Wisconsin; grandchildren Alistair, Colin, and Allegra; sister Peggy Richards; and nephews Steve Boyden and Tom Backus.

2009-07-19T00:00:00Z,Walter Kirn’s essay reminds us that there are two kinds of people who take the SATs: those who believe that they mean something and those who believe that they don’t.

Those students who have understood all along that tests are just tests and that teachers are just peoplemay in the end be more well suited to the business of real learning. So perhaps we should be testing for attitude rather than aptitude.

2009-07-19T00:00:00Z,"FOR a graffiti show in Paris in 2009, you would expect all the usual suspects on display: gang tags by disaffected New York street kids, Keith Haring and Jean-Michel Basquiat. But ''Born in the Street,'' a graffiti extravaganza now at the Cartier Foundation on Boulevard Raspail, doesn't traffic in clichés. Though the show does include requisite archival New York photos, the focus here is on the traditions of wall painting and the performative aspects of street art. In this vein, two young artists used Bic lighters to burn the walls over the reception area and create a visual labyrinth. The writer Evan Roth painstakingly cataloged an online taxonomy of Parisian graffiti, and a contemporary tagger like Basco Vazko from Chile displays art that has as much to do with tattoos and the paintings of Joan Miró as it does with hip-hop.

He said that he retired from professional boxing that year, but that he still earns extra money as a sparring partner. He said he started fighting in the ring at age 17, when he was an unemployed new father, and a friend saw the damage he was doing to his apartment. ''Whenever things didn't go right, I would lose my head and punch the walls,'' Mr. Vega said. He had his professional debut a year later, he said, at what is now Symphony Space on Broadway at 95th Street. Mr. Vega said he had boxed under Don King's promotional ticket, and sparred with boxing greats like Hector (Macho) Camacho and Ray (Boom Boom)Mancini. ''I was always the underdog,'' he said.

My boys both grew up backpacking with me, so we have a real natural connection and a high comfort level of being together. So that's not unusual. What was unusual was that the trip took place right smack in the heart of tax season. My other son's a C.P.A. like me -- he's my partner -- and we agreed that we were in good shape and I could do it. In the photograph I'm looking at a rock, which is what I do when I travel. Everybody laughs at me, but it's a pretty cheap form of entertainment. I bring at least one rock back from all my trips and put it on my office bookshelf, a combination trophy and postcard of the trip. It's covered with stones from Alaska, a piece of coral from Hawaii, Bryce Canyon, Mount Whitney, which my sons and I climbed, the Swiss Alps. There's a memory with each one of them.''

Ryan is now the Jets' coach and Scott a key part of the defense, and the top draft pick Mark Sanchez appears to be an N.F.L.-ready quarterback.

2009-07-19T00:00:00Z,"When a player goes into the All-Star break with 30 or more home runs, it is natural to start talking about his chances of hitting 60. Regardless of the taint from the steroid era, 60 is still one of the sport's magical numbers, and Albert Pujols, the Cardinals' slugger, entered Saturday with 34 home runs and 69 games to play. But what may be hard to believe is that even as great as Pujols is, the odds, and history, are stacked against him hitting 60. Since the All-Star Game began in 1933, a player has entered the break with 30 or more home runs 31 times. In 30 of those instances, the player's total declined in the second half. As a group, the players averaged 17.74 home runs, and in 8 of the 31 seasons, a player has finished the second half by hitting 10 or fewer homers."

A city spokesman, Ahmad al-Ghamdi, told the Arab News that the festival “lacked preparations,” but according to Agence France-Presse, film organizers said pressures from conservative religious clerics had led the city to cancel it.

The Israeli government provided airfare for Tatia Rosenthal, whose film “9.99” is an Israeli-Australian co-production. In a letter to the festival director, Richard Moore, Mr. Loach, right, wrote that he was protesting not Israeli films or filmmakers, but Israel’s “illegal occupation of Palestinian land, destruction of homes and livelihoods,” according to The Age, a newspaper in Melbourne. Mr. Moore said the festival would not revisit the sponsorship agreement. “It’s like submitting to blackmail,” he said, according to Agence France-Presse. In May BBC News reported that the Edinburgh Film Festival had returned an Israeli grant for a filmmaker’s travel expenses after Mr. Loach called for a boycott. With a lot of action but almost no romance, the first feature film produced by Hamas, the militant Palestinian group, had its premiere on Friday, playing to a segregated audience of men and women at Islamic University in Gaza City, The Associated Press reported. (Above right, a billboard, at top center, for the film, in Gaza City.) “We are trying to make quality art that is Islamic and about the resistance, without provocative scenes,” said Fathi Hamad, Hamas interior minister and producer of the film, a biopic about Emad Akel, a military commander who was killed by Israeli troops in 1993.

Manassero, from Verona, Italy, was the only amateur to make the cut, so was guaranteed to win the silver medal awarded to the top amateur.

It says this plan will let entrepreneurs sell specialty addresses to people and companies interested in certain areas, like .shoes or .movies. It will also create simpler Web addresses for companies. Expect to see the likes of .amazon, .ibm and .pepsi. This is where things get interesting. Now, Internet conventions require text before and after the period. So you'll need to go to home.amazon or amazon.amazon to get to the company's home page. But if top-level domains become widely used by popular Web sites, browser makers may well decide to treat a single word entered in the browser bar as a pointer to that domain's home page. Suddenly, you will be able to get to Amazon and Pepsi typing a single word, no dots needed."

While at St. Francis, Dr. Rogers focused his efforts on improving the quality of health care and was responsible for establishing the St. Francis Hospital Day-Op Center, the first ambulatory surgical unit in the country.

The Republican National Committee and the Ohio Republican Party were also named in the suit. In February, a judge denied motions by Mr. McCain and the R.N.C. to have the case dismissed on the grounds that the song was covered by fair use and First Amendment rules. Further terms of the settlement were not disclosed."

Today Paramount Home Entertainment and CBS released the show's first season (it ran for five) on DVD, so I checked in for a stay on memory lane.""Hotel"" was often compared to ""The Love Boat,"" which it certainly mirrored in structure: there were the St. Gregory's staff members - including the omnipresent manager, Peter McDermott (Brolin); his assistant, Christine Francis (Connie Sellecca); the guest relations manager, Mark Danning (Shea Farrell); and the security guy, Billy Griffin (Nathan Cook) - and an ever-changing roster of hotel guests, played by the aforementioned special guest stars.

2009-07-22T11:35:54Z,"Updated | 12:05 p.m. As Steiner, the grim intellectual of “La Dolce Vita,” warned us, salvation doesn’t lie within four walls. On Wednesday, Italian police seized the Café de Paris, a bar featured in that 1960 Federico Fellini film, as part of an anti-Mafia raid, The Associated Press reported. Located on Rome’s Via Veneto, the Café de Paris was used to represent the city’s glitziness and decadence in the film, which starred Marcello Mastroianni as a self-doubting journalist. The police there said that the bar was among $280 million in assets, including restaurants, apartments and cars, that it had taken from the ‘Ndrangheta, a mob organization based in Italy’s southern Calabria region that has been purchasing real estate in Rome. A police spokesman in Rome told The A.P. that a manager has been appointed to keep the Café de Paris running, and that a court hearing would be scheduled to determine whether it will remain open.Read Bosley Crowther’s New York Times review of “La Dolce Vita” here."

Koch Theater) was being renovated, Kenneth Tabachnick, the general manager, earned $348,000 and Damian Woetzel, then the senior male principal dancer, was paid $278,000, Bloomberg said. But the fortunes of City Ballet, like many other cultural institutions, quickly reversed: in February, it laid off 11 members of its ballet corps, and it ran a deficit of about $7 million its 2008-9 season.

In June, Activision filed suit against the game developer Double Fine Productions, which since at least 2007 has been developing Brutal Legend, a game in which Mr. Black (“The School of Rock”) plays a heavy-metal roadie in a fantasy land. Electronic Arts, a rival publisher, said in December that it had acquired Brutal Legend, but in its suit, Activision said that it still has a contract to release the game. (It was originally to be released by Vivendi Games, now part of Activision Blizzard.) In its countersuit, Double Fine Productions said that Activision’s “purpose is not only to cancel Brutal Legend, but to kill it completely so that Guitar Hero would not have to face the competition.” A hearing on a motion by Activision to block the game’s release has been scheduled for July 30."

More than 15 percent had asthma. To ensure that these self-reported symptoms were accurate, the scientists monitored 72 of the young swimmers and 73 of the soccer players over the course of five practices. They found that the swimmers definitely struggled with more breathing problems than the soccer players. Notably, the young swimmers' difficulties were closely correlated to the levels of chlorine and chlorine byproducts in their pools. More chemicals meant more symptoms."

The obituary also incorrectly rendered part of the title of a Rolling Stones album whose cover Mr. Wilkes helped design and misidentified the site of the restroom where the cover photo for the album was shot. The album is &#8220;Beggars Banquet,&#8221; not &#8220;Beggar&#8217;s Banquet&#8221; and the cover photo was shot in a mechanic&#8217;s garage in Los Angeles, not a London pub, as Mr. Wilkes&#8217;s daughter, Katherine Wilkes Fotch, said."

Smith was not one of the CBS correspondents Mr. Cronkite would turn to for reports from the field after he became anchor of &#8220;The CBS Evening News&#8221; in 1962; he left CBS before Mr. Cronkite was the anchor. Because of an editing error, the appraisal also misstated the name of the news agency for which Mr. Cronkite was Moscow bureau chief after World War II.

The Republican National Committee said that it would apologize to Mr. Browne as part of a settlement for using the song in an advertisement without his permission and that it would seek artists’ approval before featuring their music in campaign ads in the future. In August Mr. Browne filed suit in Federal District Court in Los Angeles against Senator John McCain for using the song in a commercial that ran in Ohio during the presidential campaign, criticizing Barack Obama for saying that Americans could conserve gasoline by keeping car tires at the proper pressure. The Republican National Committee and the Ohio Republican Party were also named in the suit. In February a judge denied motions by Mr. McCain and the committee to have the case dismissed on the grounds that their use of the song was protected by the First Amendment and fair-use doctrine. Further terms of the settlement were not disclosed."

The White House announced on Monday that it had moved up Mr. Obama’s prime-time news conference on Wednesday by one hour after discussions with the broadcasters. The news conference will be carried by three of the four major networks and PBS at 8 Eastern time on Wednesday. The Fox network said it would not carry the news conference but would direct viewers to live coverage on its sister cable outlets, Fox News Channel and Fox Business Network. (NBC’s cable outlets MSNBC and CNBC will also carry the news conference, as will CNN and C-Span.) Fox balked because its summer reality show, “So You Think You Can Dance?,” is regularly broadcast from 8 to 10 p.m. on Wednesday. NBC was also having doubts about the timing, a network executive said, because, at its original time, the news conference would have conflicted with “America’s Got Talent,” one of the summer’s top-rated shows."

Though he designed or helped design those covers, he did not shoot the cover photographs; his partner, Barry Feinstein, did. The obituary also incorrectly rendered part of the title of a Rolling Stones album whose cover Mr. Wilkes helped design and misidentified the site of the restroom where the cover photo for the album was shot. The album is ''Beggars Banquet,'' not ''Beggar's Banquet'' and the cover photo was shot in a mechanic's garage in Los Angeles, not a London pub, as Mr. Wilkes's daughter, Katherine Wilkes Fotch, said."

2009-07-22T00:00:00Z,"New York is a city of artists -- and a city of art. It is, of course, a city of museums, but also a place where the buildings themselves form a kind of collage-installation, where traveling on the subway daily can feel like a performance piece, where many exploit their bodies as veritable canvases for tattoos and makeup and costume. A walk through many New York neighborhoods can easily become a gallery tour of found art: graffiti murals, sidewalk sculptures of discarded furniture; the rainbow of umbrellas during a rainstorm. But there are also more purposeful, carefully curated public art displays on the city's streets -- and its sidewalks, and in its parks and playgrounds. Some of the pieces are permanent, like the 29-year-old mural that can be glimpsed from the Q train as it crosses into Brooklyn; others are fleeting -- in the Bronx, some artists led a group of children in creating a chalk masterpiece on the sidewalk that would wash away in the first rain. Some attract a crowd, like a dancer's 10-minute performances in a huge streetlevel window on 42nd Street. Others, like the blocklong ''jungle'' adorning a warehouse on the far West Side of Manhattan, get barely a glance from construction workers who pass by daily. Some are sanctioned, others surreptitious, like the works of the rebels who tamper with street lights to create their own messages, or those of the people who hang provocative signs over billboards without permission. Over the next 12 weeks, Lens will capture some of New York's public art, along with people's reactions to it. The series, available online at nytimes.com/lens, will look at high-profile projects being handled by the Public Art Fund, the city parks department, and Chashama, whose mission is to transform temporarily vacant spaces into public artworks. And it will look, too, for accidental canvases, hidden in the hubbub."

So I diced a different treasure, some of summer's first, glossy zucchini from the farm stand.

Maxwell&#8217;s &#8220;BLACKsummers&#8217;night&#8221; (Columbia), which topped last week&#8217;s chart, fell to No. 2 with 103,000 sales. &#8220;Hannah Montana 3&#8221; (Disney) was No. 3 with 73,000, and the compilation album &#8220;Now 31&#8221; was fourth with 69,000. &#8220;The E.N.D.&#8221; (Interscope), by the Black Eyed Peas, held at fifth, with 54,000, and the Dead Weather, Jack White&#8217;s new band, opened at No. 6 with &#8220;Horehound&#8221; (Third Man).

An ambitious judge (Isabelle Huppert, above, with Robin Renucci) targets a corporate bigwig (François Berléand) and subsequently torments his cronies, who resort first to chivalry and then thuggishness as they try to extract themselves from trouble. Writing in The New York Times, A. O. Scott said that ''Ms. Huppert's ferocity compensates for the director's detachment; no French actress is as riveting to watch once the gloves come off.'' In ''A Girl Cut in Two'' (2007), at 10, a television weather girl (Ludivine Sagnier) is preyed upon by an aging writer (Mr. Berléand again), a spoiled playboy (Benoît Magimel) and her own conflicting desires. Manohla Dargis of The Times noted that the ''erotically charged, beautifully directed story'' was inspired by a true-life melodrama involving the 19th-century architect Stanford White, his mistress and her violently aggrieved millionaire husband. 7 A.M.

2009-07-25T10:43:49Z,"Re ""Love and Marriage, New York Times Style"" (July 12):Thank you so very much for making changes to the tenor of ""Weddings"" to align it more closely with the tenor of America.Accomplishment takes many forms, not just bloodlines or even hard work leading to wealth. (Disclosure: I am the granddaughter of wealthy industrialists from Buffalo.) The accomplishments of Jennifer Keen and Paul Sousa inspire so many more than those of another Andover-Yale kid marrying another Andover-Yale kid from Wall Street. I cannot begin to tell you how inclusive that feels to the millions who read The Times but neither live on the East Coast nor are among the 1 percent of the population that ""Weddings"" used to cover exclusively. The story of Ms. Keen and Mr. Sousa made me weep for days and celebrate the joy of those two, who went through hell to find happiness.I'm glad to see that you have changed along with the face of America.LAURA WILKINSONAtlanta, July 12, 2009 ●While I have always loved reading the Times weddings section, as I love seeing people who are doing great and impressive things with their lives, I agree that it should be diversified a bit, as there are impressive accomplishments outside what some would categorize as such. By including a more complete and representative group of people, you are reaching out to more people with the message that they, too, can be impressive in their life's work, even if they didn't go to an Ivy League school or work on Wall Street.STEVEN M. CLAYTONOcean, N.J., July 13, 2009 ●Like Timothy Noah, I would prefer that these listings be consigned to the dustbin. Opening them up to same-sex marriages was a welcome (if inconsequential) step in recognizing parity, and the occasional sub-elite listings do tilt at the paper's longstanding class bias in those pages. These changes are incremental but hardly recognize the outmoded nature of the listings themselves. They are an anachronism.The most outrageous aspect was highlighted in your column: that reporting resources are wasted, literally wasted, on fact-checking and vetting these announcements.MARK ELLIOTBeverly Hills, Calif., July 14, 2009 ●It has often occurred to me that it would be interesting to have updates on outcomes of couples featured in ""Weddings and Celebrations."" In epidemiology, these couples are ripe for the classic approach of cohort analysis. What proportion survive and thrive? What proportion fail, and how quickly? What are the predictors (risk factors) for failure? How do those who stay together differ from those who do not?I would expect that the success and failure rate of those on whom you report would be no different from that in the general population, but I think readers would find it of interest. On the other hand, it might be discouraging and detract from the sometimes heady optimism and boundless possibilities captured in your pages.DR. KEVIN M. DE COCKGeneva, Switzerland, July 12, 2009 ●It was with amazement that I read that a ""few readers"" did not approve of the ""Vows"" choice for the June 28 issue. It was the first and perhaps last ""Vows"" choice that made me cry with joy. It was with great pleasure that I read that Mr. Sousa is currently maintaining a 4.0 grade point average at a community college. My thoughts and prayers are with the couple as they together travel through this new journey.HEATHER NELSONPortland, Ore., July 12, 2009 ●Naturally, I missed the wedding announcement. Until I read your article about Mr. Sousa and Ms. Keen I was quite aware that the weddings section of The Times was nothing short of revolting. A truly inspiring story, but must readers pay such a price to have read it?SEAN NICOLSONNew Rochelle, N.Y., July 12, 2009 ●While those couples whose wedding announcements are published in The Times these days do not exactly represent a cross section of the United States population, there's no doubt that there has been a ""democratization"" in the selection process over the years, and it now favors middle-class achievers over upper-class heirs. In this, The Times merely reflects the larger trends in America, as in almost all things the country moves from a society based on ""ascription"" (inherited social status) to one based on personal achievement.To take one obvious example, it was not many decades ago that Ivy League colleges were dominated by prep school graduates and legacies. Today, students of inherited wealth are greatly outnumbered by middle-class valedictorians from public high schools all over the country.Some years ago, a student of mine, Penny Paul, and I did a study of several hundred June wedding announcements in the Sunday Times from the 1960s and early 1970s. Even at that late date, and despite the equality revolution of the 1960s, inherited status won the day. In two-thirds of the wedding announcements, for example, at least one of the principals, and often both, were listed in the Social Register. Fully half of all the brides had attended private boarding schools, with Miss Porter's leading the way. And more than half the couples were married in Episcopal ceremonies.PAUL BLUMBERGBloomington, Ill., July 13, 2009The writer is a professor emeritus of sociology at Queens College and Graduate Center, CUNY ●I have long objected to The Times's wedding announcements - and now, having read your explanation of how they are prepared and what gets included, I find them even more objectionable.The simplest and most obvious problem is that, with all the news that needs to be covered and the financial problems of the newspaper industry, The Times is spending staff time and space in the paper on these. I always assumed that participants simply submitted information, which The Times rewrote, and paid for the space. Now I learn that the subjects don't pay, and The Times spends staff time fact-checking and interviewing participants. Surely there are newsworthy topics that would benefit from this attention.Do I care that two people who met at Yale and graduated cum laude - children of perfectly nice people like hundreds of thousands, millions of others in this country - got married in Connecticut? (Does anyone in New York care?) More important, these announcements (in the so-called newspaper of record) perpetuate values that I and many others question. The ""achievements"" that you say have replaced bloodlines are overwhelmingly business-oriented. (And how much are these mostly 20- and 30-somethings likely to have achieved? And why should they get credit for their parents' achievements?)Furthermore, these announcements treat marriage itself as newsworthy. How about a follow-up sometime to find out how many are divorced within five years? Ten years? Restraining orders? Bitter child-custody fights? Bankruptcies? How many of them marry again and again? In a time of ""serial monogamy,"" when more adults live alone than in households, as well as continuing battles over same-sex marriage, I question the emphasis on weddings. Where are the announcements about the accomplished individuals (partnered or single) who never marry? They have to wait for the obituaries.NANCY VAN HOUSEBerkeley, Calif., July 12, 2009"

BEHIND THE NEWS The F-22 has been a flashpoint in the president's efforts to shift more of the Pentagon's resources to fighting insurgencies. The jet (187 have been ordered) was designed to counter Soviet combat aircraft in the 1980s. A big issue this time was jobs: an estimated 25,000 are tied directly to work on the plane. Siding with the president was Senator John McCain, his Republican rival last year, who said the vote ''really means there's a chance of us changing the way we do business in Washington.''"

But I have been dismayed by the rush to judgment of athletes who are guilty until proven innocent, and even those athletes who have not tested positive. Lance Armstrong in particular has drawn the ire of many, notably Dick Pound, the former head of the World Anti-Doping Agency. Yet now in the Tour de France, Armstrong is currently in third place and has been tested for performance-enhancing drugs more often than any other cyclist this year. He is 37, broke his collarbone earlier in the year and had been retired for three years. If Pound is to be believed, this is an impossible feat. Perhaps we may have to give Armstrong the full benefit of the doubt. Perhaps Pound owes him an apology. Geoff Smyth Boulder, Colo."

In her sophomore year at Virginia Commonwealth University, when a friend joked that the sculptures and paintings stacked inside her storage locker had come to resemble a gallery, she fashioned it into one. With $20 and a trip to a dollhouse shop for foam core, balsa wood and plexiglass, Locker 50b, all 12 by 14 by 19 inches of it, was transformed into a formal gallery space. That was in 2002.

A longtime resident of Stamford, Mr. Whittingham was born in Jamaica West Indies, the son of the late Cecil and Minna Elizabeth Whittingham. Mr. Whittingham graduated from Pace University and became a founding department head at U.S. Surgical Corporation. He served in several capacities, including Chief Financial Officer, Senior Vice President and a member of the Board of Directors. After leaving U.S. Surgical, Mr. Whittingham co-founded Joint Medical Products Corporation, Inc. to develop and market state-of-the-art hip and knee joints. The design features developed in the 1980s with Mr. Whittingham as Chief Executive Officer are ever lasting in their clinical performance benefiting hundreds of thousands of people, changing world history in orthopedics. He led the company in achieving national and global success in the international orthopedic marketplace. The company was ultimately acquired by Johnson and Johnson. Mr. Whittingham was Chief Executive Officer of Stamford-based C.A.W.L. Developments, Inc., involved in consulting, investments and management services. In addition to the many awards he has received, he was recently recognized as an Honorary Lifetime Member of the Norwalk Hospital Board of Trustees. The Whittingham Family Foundation has made significant contributions to many causes within Fairfield County. In 1997, Norwalk Hospital opened The C. Anthony and Jean Whittingham Cancer Center in Norwalk Hospital and in 2001 The C. Anthony and Jean Whittingham Pavilion for Specialty Care was opened at Stamford Hospital. Most recently, the Whittingham family has made a pledge to name the new American Cancer Society Regional Center, C. Anthony and Jean Whittingham Family building, to be based in Norwalk.

George was instrumental in the founding and creation of Jazz at Lincoln Center when he served as Chairman of Lincoln Center for the Performing Arts. He was a founding Board member, now Emeritus and received the first Jazz at Lincoln Center Award for Leadership in 1996. George's enduring joyful passion for jazz spurred his determination to make a permanent home in the Lincoln Center family for this most American of all our art forms. Quite simply, without the gift of George Weissman's insightful leadership and bold decisions, there would be no Jazz at Lincoln Center. Surely George will be long and fondly remembered by many people and institutions for many wonderful things he did and accomplished and shared.

Shortly after graduating from Cornell Law School in 2008, she found out she had Ewing's sarcoma, a rare tumor in which cancer cells are found in the bone or soft tissue. Ms. O'Donnell-Moore's tumor, on her vocal cords, is being treated with chemotherapy and radiation. The radiation treatments last less than 10 minutes, but require her to be immobilized by a rigid plastic netting molded specifically for her face and shoulders. In addition to changing her voice, the cancer and its treatment have affected her tongue. She is often worn out from the chemo and radiation, and therefore spends a lot of time in her room at Hope Lodge, where a family member generally stays with her. She likes to walk in the city but does not like crowds, so she roams at night; her strength has been building, and she has worked up to treks of a mile at a time. Ms. O'Donnell-Moore lived in the Bronx for a bit as a child, but home is a farm in the bluegrass region of Kentucky."

The disturbing health plan figures mentioned for college athletes, are often far worse. Although Massachusetts has for the past 20 years mandated all college students to be on health insurance, this insurance does not adequately cover students. Instead, students are forced to forgo necessary care or incur severe medical debt. It is not enough for a state to mandate that all students have health insurance; they must also require that students receive adequate coverage. Aaron Marden"

And that whole time, I really hadn't thought about football at all. And I was on my way to India, and I stopped in Thailand for like two days, for the weekend. And so Monday, I was flying from Bangkok to New Delhi. And I had to take another plane to go to Bangkok. And so I was waiting for the guy to pick me up and take me to the airport, and I'm sitting in the lobby of this hostel. It was a Monday morning. And this guy like, he walks over and puts this TV on, and I look, and it's the Raiders playing the Bucs. And I was thinking to myself like, this is like some kind of sign, you know. I didn't even know they watched football. I didn't know they knew what football was in Thailand. And this game is on television, right."

2009-07-26T00:00:00Z,"CHEVINS--Margaret Macy (""Peggy""), 84, of Key Largo, Florida and Quechee, Vermont, died Tuesday, July 7, 2009 at Mariners Hospital in Tavenier, Florida, following a short illness. She was born in Denver, Colorado on January 15, 1925, the daughter of Cecil W. and Eva K. Macy, both deceased. She grew up primarily in the Bethesda, Maryland area and attended college at Miami University of Ohio and Westhampton College of the University of Richmond. After receiving her degree in chemistry from Richmond in 1946, she was accepted into a graduate teaching fellowship program at Syracuse University, where she met Anthony Chevins, one of a number of WWII veterans returning to school on the G.I. Bill to whom she had the pleasure of teaching chemistry (and being adopted as their favorite chaperone). She married Tony in 1948 and they remained married until his death in 2008. After Syracuse, the couple moved to the New York City area where Tony began a career in advertising and they started a family. Two children and a few years later, they moved to Norwalk, Connecticut and had a third child. Peggy was a homemaker, wife and mother, and dedicated car-pooler, as well as a voracious reader, scholar and armchair political scientist. She enjoyed ferreting out information about her Macy ancestors who settled Nantucket. But her greatest passion was golf. She played on many club teams; winning numerous team tournaments, club championships and other matches over the years (especially against Tony). She was a longtime member of the Woodway Country Club in Darien, Connecticut, and more recently the Quechee Club in Quechee, Vermont and the Card Sound Golf Club at Ocean Reef in Key Largo. She and Tony played golf all over the world, tackling some of the most famously difficult courses. As a sideline, she reveled in playing courses that frowned on women players, ignoring the hidebound traditions that excluded women from their inner sanctums. Peggy also loved travel and claimed to have visited 120 countries over the years. She was usually happiest when she was exploring out of the way places alone or with a friend; accompanied by her guidebook, train schedules, boundless curiosity and love of history. She maintained a house in Val de Lobo, Portugal for a number of years where she could combine her love of golf and travel. She was truly a pioneer as a woman, coming from a long line of early female lawyers and mathematicians and she refused to accept the limitations commonly imposed on women of her era. Her courage and strength will be sorely missed. She is survived by two children, Cheryl L. Davis (Jeffrey Noe) of Rhinebeck, New York and Christopher M. Chevins (Cheryl Peterka) of New York, New York, as well as several grandchildren; Jennifer Davis, Chelsea Noe, and Garrett, Corinna and Travis Lander. Her youngest daughter, Cynthia M. Chevins, died in 2007. A memorial service will be held at the Anglers Club in Key Largo this fall (date to be determined later). The family requests that memorial donations be made to Building With Books (buildon.org) or Oceana (oceana.org)."

''I didn't want to wear it until I painted it,'' said Mr. Gonzales, whose array of work is now on view at Half Gallery on the Lower East Side. Entitled ''South West,'' the show, which nearly sold out on opening night, is inspired by Navajo rugs. (''I just like them,'' he explained, helpfully.) Their vivid patterns find their way into most of the pieces. A painting of Michael Jackson (left), done after the pop star's death, features burnt orange zigzags across his face.

2009-07-26T00:00:00Z,"In 1809, a young Washington Irving published ''A History of New York,'' a satirical account of the settlement of New Amsterdam. Manhattanites knew little of their Dutch founding fathers, and Irving took advantage of that to create a past that interwove fact and fable; one that presented an appealing portrait of the Dutch colonists as pleasure-loving, pipe-smoking burghers who introduced Santa Claus, doughnuts and diplomacy to America, and let their meandering cows give shape to the streets of Lower Manhattan. The reader's guide through this Shangri-La was a fictional Dutchman named Diedrich Knickerbocker. What Irving did not anticipate was that in the ensuing 200 years, New Yorkers would adopt his imaginary character as an emblem of all that was authentically, emphatically New York. As I recount in my book, ''Knickerbocker: The Myth Behind New York,'' out this month from Rutgers University Press, generations of New Yorkers recast the Dutchman according to their needs and their times: he became a symbol of nativism and patriotism, of high society and of five-borough consolidation, and he was seized upon to market everything from beer to basketball."

''We didn't want to visit the most crowded section at Badaling, so we opted instead for Simatai, which is more remote and beautiful. From Beijing, we took a public bus about 50 miles to Miyun, and from there arranged for a driver. We underestimated how difficult it was to reach Simatai independently; we couldn't find anyone who spoke English, plus we ran out of money and needed an ATM basically in the middle of nowhere. But it was worth the toil! The wall blends in with its natural surroundings: brown-on-brown with touches of green, sweeping into infinity. The turrets along the wall measure distance. I'd feel such a sense of accomplishment when I reached the next one. What surprised me was how epic the wall is. It was definitely built on a nonhuman scale. So was Tiananmen Square.

2009-07-26T00:00:00Z,"MALE--Michael Well-known Miami business lawyer, devoted husband and father and incomparable friend, died July 19 due to complications from melanoma. Mikey as he was known after the birth of his grandchildren was born in New York on Nov 16, 1937, grew up in Pittsburgh, graduated from Yale University and Yale Law School. In 1965 he arrived in South Florida to work as house counsel for Wometco Enterprises before hanging out his own shingle a decade later. In 1966 he married Judi Rudolph, who has become a well-known interior designer. Michael was involved with many causes, including Miami Jewish Home & Hospital for the Aged and those related to classical music. An accomplished cook, he loved good wine and better food and often entertained at home. Michael was an avid tennis player, loved the outdoors and counted National Geographic and Smithsonian among his favorite magazines. He delighted in his friendships and acted as a mentor and sounding board to his many, many friends. He is survived by his mother, Maxine Male; sister and brother-in-law Marianne and Robert Scheele of Madison, Wis.; son John, daughter-in-law Megan and granddaughters Hannah and Jami of West Bloomfield, Mich.; daughter Lauren Male and fiance Michael Crandall of Chicago, and his wife Judi, without whom he would have been lost.

2009-07-26T00:00:00Z,"Boardwalks in summer have a way of dismantling people's inhibitions, with their heady doses of sugar, heat, carnival games and frothy drinks. So it is at Point Pleasant Beach, N.J., where, with a spin on the Super Himalaya and a little bumper-car action, the day can reach high kitsch. Day-trippers who venture away from the Boardwalk won't be disappointed either; the downtown has been spruced up in recent years. After a two-hour-plus ride from Pennsylvania Station on New Jersey Transit ($12.50 one way for adults), visitors have an eight-minute walk to the beach, with the shops of downtown two minutes in the opposite direction."

2009-07-27T11:03:24Z,"The management of the Skylight Opera Theater in Milwaukee held an outdoor meeting Friday with artists, subscribers and board members who have been frustrated with the cascade of controversies that followed the theater’s firing of its longtime artistic director, The Milwaukee Journal Sentinel reported. The meeting, held in Milwaukee’s Catalano Square park, was led by the theater’s managing director, Eric Dillner, and interim board president, Terrence Kurtenbach, who apologized for “miscommunication” after the termination of William Theisen on June 16. Dozens of artists have since resigned from the theater, and many of its supporters have said they will not work with its current leadership. At the meeting, Mr. Dillner said that he had recast many of the vacant roles and hired a director in to replace Mr. Theisen in the theater’s opening production of “The Barber of Seville” but did not announce their names, according to The Journal Sentinel."
2009-07-27T11:28:38Z,"The Web site of the Melbourne International Film Festival was defaced by hackers who were protesting a planned appearance at the festival by an advocate for the Uighur ethnic group in China, The Associated Press reported. Rebiya Kadeer, a former businesswoman and an advocate for the Uighurs, is scheduled to attend the film festival on Aug. 8. The Chinese government has blamed her for inciting violence this month between Muslim Uighurs and Han Chinese, though Ms. Kadeer, who lives in exile in the United States, has denied any involvement. On Saturday, hackers posted a Chinese flag on the festival’s Web site for about 45 minutes, along with messages that demanded that organizers apologize for including Ms. Kadeer and a documentary about her life in the festival program. The A.P. said there were no disturbances at the premiere of the documentary, “10 Conditions of Love,” on Sunday night."

2009-07-27T12:39:08Z,"Last week was something of a draw for the British architect Richard Rogers: on one hand, he was given two of the six nominations for the RIBA Stirling Prize, one of Britain’s most coveted architecture prizes, Bloomberg News reported. His two nominations for the award, which comes with a prize of about $32,900, were his designs for Maggie’s Center, a London clinic for cancer patients, and the Bodegas Protos winery near Valladolid, Spain. However, Lord Rogers’s design for an extension to the British Museum was rejected by a local council, The Evening Standard reported. The Camden Council voted 5-4 that the five-story, $214 million plan was an “overdevelopment” and whose benefits would be outweighed by possible damage to the museum. In June, Lord Rogers’s plans for a housing development at the site of a former army barracks in London’s Chelsea neighborhood were dropped by a Qatari development company after they were criticized by Prince Charles."
2009-07-27T13:02:16Z,"In her inaugural season as a co-director of the Bayreuth Festival in Germany, Katharina Wagner was booed by audience members at the end of a production of “Die Meistersinger von Nürnberg” on Sunday, Agence France-Presse reported. Ms. Wagner, 31, a great-granddaughter of the composer and festival founder Richard Wagner, is directing the annual celebration with her half-sister Eva Wagner-Pasquier, 64, having inherited the duties from the composer’s grandson Wolfgang. This year’s event narrowly avoided a strike by stagehands and technicians who were seeking higher wages. In Sunday’s production of “Die Meistersinger,” the singers’ guild that the opera centers on was updated to a modern arts league, including theater designers and film directors, and the character of the young knight Walter was made a graffiti artist. The Bayreuth audience also booed Peter Schneider for his conducting of “Tristan und Isolde,” which opened the festival on Saturday."
2009-07-27T15:50:21Z,"In terrible news for anyone who has trouble distinguishing between reality and a fantasy world where sexy vampires roam the streets of New Orleans, but potentially exciting news for anyone living who would want to consume a beverage intended for the undead, a carbonated drink based on the HBO series “True Blood” is planned to go on sale in September. In a news release on Monday, Omni Consumer Products said that it had struck a deal with HBO’s licensing division to produce Tru Blood, inspired by the drink that the program’s vampires consume for sustenance (when they’re not feeding on the living). In a statement, the company said that its Tru Blood drink would have “a crisp, slightly tart and lightly sweet tang,” and come in a bottle similar to the one featured on the HBO series."

The Supermarket, a sprawling trove of recession-friendly design booty, is the latest floor of the 150-year-old establishment to get dusted off, thanks to the king of sleepy-store reinventions, Vittorio Radice. Radice worked makeover magic on the London retail stalwarts Selfridges and Marks & Spencer before returning to his native Italy in 2006 to take on Rinascente, one fluorescent light at a time. The beauty of Design Supermarket can be found not just in its sleek interior, designed by the minimalist master Claudio Silvestrin -- or in its full-scale shop-in-shops dedicated to golden Italian institutions like Kartell, Alessi and Nespresso -- but also in its democratic approach to design. With Paola Navone porch lamps (90 euros) alongside Eno leather baskets (100 euros) and Royal VKB's kitchen pourers (9 euros), it's all molto economico as well as chic. And that's putting the super in this market."

With deepest sorrow, the board, staff and artists of Jazz at Lincoln Center mourn the loss of our beloved George Weissman and extend to his wonderful partner and wife Mildred and family, our love and most caring sympathy. George was instrumental in the founding and creation of Jazz at Lincoln Center when he served as Chairman of Lincoln Center for the Performing Arts. He was a founding Board member, now Emeritus and received the first Jazz at Lincoln Center Award for Leadership in 1996. George's enduring joyful passion for jazz spurred his determination to make a permanent home in the Lincoln Center family for this most American of all our art forms. Quite simply, without the gift of George Weissman's insightful leadership and bold decisions, there would be no Jazz at Lincoln Center. Surely George will be long and fondly remembered by many people and institutions for many wonderful things he did and accomplished and shared. But at Jazz at Lincoln Center he will always be revered and loved for his modesty, warm good humor and the twinkle in his eyes when as Chairman of Lincoln Center he said one day almost two decades ago ""Jazz...at Lincoln Center? Let's do it."" Lisa Schiff, Chairman Wynton Marsalis, Artistic Director Gordon J. Davis, Founding Chairman Shahara Ahmad-Lewellyn, Vice Chair Diane M.

George joined Lincoln Center's Board of Directors in 1972, and became Vice Chairman in 1984. During his distinguished tenure as Chairman of Lincoln Center from 1986 to 1994, George oversaw the construction of the Samuel B. and David Rose Building and united all twelve Lincoln Center constituents in an unprecedented mutual programming venture, the 19-month Mozart Bicentennial. His legacy can also be seen in the growth of programs that were launched with his active encouragement, including the Classical Jazz and Serious Fun! series, the forerunners of Jazz at Lincoln Center and Lincoln Center Festival, respectively, and Midsummer Night Swing. George's contributions to Lincoln Center are significant and long-lasting. We will miss his wise counsel, leavened with warmth and a sense of humor. We offer our sincerest condolences to his wife Mildred, and their three children Paul, Ellen, and Daniel.

His nerd credentials are on full display in this report from Monday’s show, in which Mr. Fallon attempts to pitch his project not only to Hollywood types like the “Iron Man” director Jon Favreau and the cast of “Lost,” but to comics industry stars like Stan Lee and Geoff Johns. Also, you’ll hear him use the phrase “crazy exciting” on occasion:"
2009-07-28T09:22:05Z,"At one point during Monday night’s Green Day show at Madison Square Garden, Billie Joe Armstrong announced that he needed someone on stage who could play the guitar. And not just for a “three-chord song,” he added, “for one with four, five, maybe six chords” — “Jesus of Suburbia.” After rejecting a few wannabes he stopped and asked a girl in the mosh pit if she knew how to play, then looked unconvinced when she said she did. “What key is it in?” he asked. Seemingly satisfied with her answer (it’s somewhat complicated, but for the sake of brevity, let’s say the correct response is C sharp major) he pulled her up onto the stage. The girl — her name later was revealed to be Stephanie — was wearing jeans shorts, a torn Misfits t-shirt, and a head scarf over her pigtails. Mr. Armstrong handed her the guitar, conferred with her briefly, then let her sit on an amp to get started. And then she…ripped! A few bars in she was wandering the stage like a pro and when Mr. Armstrong introduced her at the end, the crowd was shouting “Ste-pha-nie! Ste-pha-nie!” in appreciation."

Coetzee, a nominee for “Summertime,” is a two-time winner for “Life & Times of Michael K” in 1983 and “Disgrace” in 1999. A.S. Byatt, nominated for “The Children’s Book,” previously won in 1990 for “Possession.” William Trevor earned his fifth Booker nomination for “Love and Summer,” and Colm Toibin (“Brooklyn”) and Sarah Waters (“The Little Stranger”) each make their third appearance on the longlist.

2009-07-28T10:45:50Z,"The latest entries in franchises about clumsy cops and talking dogs are among the first 25 films and television series that have qualified for a production tax credit being offered by the state of California, Variety reported. On Monday, Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger announced the roster of projects that had qualified for the rebate, which was approved by the California state legislature in February and began accepting applications earlier this month. The list includes “Beverly Hills Chihuahua 2,” a sequel to the 2008 Disney movie, the Comedy Central series “Important Things With Demetri Martin” and “Naked Gun 4,” the latest chapter in the long-running police procedural satire. (Who knew there was a “Naked Gun 4″ in the works?)

Citing statistics provided by Gov. Schwarzenegger, Variety said that the number of studio feature film projects in California has declined 50 percent since 2003."

2009-07-28T13:10:15Z,"Updated | 1:40 p.m. In a ruling that could have implications for the literary estate of Jack Kerouac, a Florida judge has ruled that the will of the author’s mother, Gabrielle Kerouac, was a forgery, The Associated Press reported. When he died in 1969, Mr. Kerouac, the iconic Beat Generation author, left his estate to his mother, who in turn left it to Mr. Kerouac’s third wife, Stella Sampas. The Sampas family has since controlled the royalties from his books and the sales of his manuscripts and other belongings, but was sued in 1994 by Jan Kerouac, the author’s daughter by his second wife, Joan Haverty, who said Gabrielle Kerouac’s will was fraudulent. Kerouac’s nephew, Paul Blake Jr., continued the case after Jan Kerouac’s death in 1994. In his ruling on Friday, Judge George W. Greer said that Gabrielle Kerouac would not have been physically able to sign a will dated Feb. 13, 1973, and “that which appears on the will dated that date is not her signature.” A lawyer for Mr. Blake told The A.P. that it was unclear what his client’s next action would be."

But don’t get too attached to Mr. Hinterhäuser: he is departing the festival altogether when Mr. Pereira arrives. And just to make life interesting, the festival’s business director, Gerbert Schwaighofer, said that he would be quitting for personal reasons in January 2011.

Kiraly, the commander of the Hungarian resistance in the uprising of 1956, misstated the year that he was captured by Russian forces in World War II, misstated the location of an ammunition dump blown up by his resistance fighters, and included erroneous identifications from an associate for his survivors. General Kiraly, then an officer in the Hungarian Army, was captured in 1945, not 1944, and the ammunition dump was near Budapest, not at the Austrian border. He is survived by a nephew, Attila Tevely, and Mr. Tevely’s children, not a son and a grandson. (The general often described Mr. Tevely as his grandson.)."

2009-07-29T00:00:00Z,"In a ruling that could have implications for the literary estate of Jack Kerouac (above right, in 1967), a Florida judge has ruled that the will of Kerouac’s mother, Gabrielle Kerouac, was a forgery, The Associated Press reported. When he died in 1969, Kerouac, the Beat Generation author, left his estate to his mother, who in turn left it to Kerouac’s third wife, Stella Sampas. The Sampas family has since controlled the royalties from his books and the sales of his manuscripts and other belongings, but was sued in 1994 by Jan Kerouac, the author’s daughter by his second wife, Joan Haverty, who said Gabrielle Kerouac’s will was fraudulent. Kerouac’s nephew, Paul Blake Jr., continued the case after Jan Kerouac’s death in 1994. In his ruling on Friday, Judge George W. Greer said that Gabrielle Kerouac would not have been physically able to sign a will on Feb. 13, 1973, and “that which appears on the will dated that date is not her signature.” A lawyer for Mr. Blake told The A.P. that it was unclear what his client’s next action would be."

Coetzee, a nominee for “Summertime,” is a two-time winner for “Life & Times of Michael K” in 1983 and “Disgrace” in 1999. A. S. Byatt, nominated for “The Children’s Book,” won in 1990 for “Possession.” William Trevor earned his fifth Booker nomination, for “Love and Summer,” and Colm Toibin (“Brooklyn”) and Sarah Waters (“The Little Stranger”) each make their third appearance on the nominee list. The other nominees are Adam Foulds (“The Quickening Maze”), Sarah Hall (“How to Paint a Dead Man”), Samantha Harvey (“The Wilderness”), James Lever (“Me Cheeta”), Hilary Mantel (“Wolf Hall”), Simon Mawer (“The Glass Room”), Ed O’Loughlin (“Not Untrue & Not Unkind”) and James Scudamore (“Heliopolis”).

Mr. Hinterhäuser will be covering the season in between the departure of Jürgen Flimm, who is leaving ahead of schedule to run the Deutsche Staatsoper Unter den Linden in Berlin, and before the arrival of Alexander Pereira, who is coming from the Zurich Opera House. But don’t get too attached to Mr. Hinterhäuser: he is departing the festival altogether when Mr. Pereira arrives. And just to make life interesting, the festival’s business director, Gerbert Schwaighofer, said that he would be quitting for personal reasons in January 2011. Also, the festival will offer its first Webcast, of a production of Mozart’s “Così Fan Tutte,” after its performance on Thursday."

In a news release on Monday, Omni Consumer Products said that it had struck a deal with HBO’s licensing division to produce Tru Blood, inspired by the drink that the program’s vampires consume for sustenance (when they’re not feeding on the living). In a statement, the company said that its Tru Blood drink would have “a crisp, slightly tart and lightly sweet tang,” and come in a bottle similar to the one featured on the HBO series."
2009-07-29T00:00:00Z,"Responding to a lawsuit filed on Monday by three board of overseers members at the Rose Art Museum who want to prevent its closing by Brandeis University, the university said the needs of its students must come before art stewardship. “The debate here does highlight a difference between Brandeis and these three Rose overseers,” Thomas F. Reilly, a lawyer for the university, said. “That is, that the university has a responsibility to provide the very best education and faculty to fulfill its higher educational agenda. Apparently, these three overseers are oblivious to the Brandeis mission.” The university’s trustees voted in January to close the museum and sell its works, collectively estimated to be worth around $350 million, to help the university address a seriously diminished endowment resulting from the financial crisis. Brandeis later backtracked, saying that no works would be sold in the immediate future and that the building would remain open as an art study center, though not as a public museum. In their suit, the overseers contend that Brandeis’s plans to close the museum “contradict the charitable intentions” of the museum’s founders and renege on promises made to art donors."

David Alan Grier, the actor and comedian, will star in the play, its producers announced on Tuesday, alongside previously announced cast members James Spader, Kerry Washington and Richard Thomas. Though Mr. Grier, above, is perhaps best known for satirizing issues of race on the comedy series “In Living Color” and “Chocolate News,” he is also a graduate of the Yale School of Drama and has appeared in the Broadway musicals “The First” (in which he earned a Tony nomination for portraying Jackie Robinson), “Dreamgirls” and “A Funny Thing Happened on the Way to the Forum.” “Race,” which will be Mr. Mamet’s Broadway debut as a director, is to begin previews at the Ethel Barrymore Theater on Nov. 16 and open on Dec. 6."
2009-07-29T00:00:00Z,"A Palestinian man who is identified in the Sacha Baron Cohen comedy “Brüno” as a leader of a West Bank militant group said that he was not affiliated with the organization and planned to sue Mr. Baron Cohen, Agence France-Presse reported. Ayman Abu Aita, identified in the movie as a leader of Al Aksa Martyrs Brigades when he is interviewed by Mr. Baron Cohen’s alter ego Brüno, said “the whole thing was a lie,” according to Agence France-Presse. “I am not a member of Al Aksa,” said Mr. Abu Aita (above, watching his interview scene in “Brüno” on the Web). He is a member of a regional committee of Fatah, which governs the West Bank and is the dominant party in the Palestine Liberation Organization. He added: “We were betrayed by this guy when he said that he was a journalist. We thought he was a foreign journalist and we hoped he would speak about our cause.” In an interview with David Letterman earlier this month, Mr. Baron Cohen explained the segment, where his gay journalist character travels to the Middle East seeking to bring peace to Israelis and Palestinians. “We thought, what could people see that they’ve never seen before on film?” Mr. Baron Cohen said. “And we thought one thing would be a comedian interviewing a terrorist.”."

In 1954, with the late Joseph Cullman III and the advertising agency of Leo Burnett, Mr. Weissman propelled the company to reposition its waning Marlboro brand as a full-flavored men's cigarette. Between 1960 and 1966, Mr. Weissman initiated the company's overseas expansion as chairman and chief executive officer of Philip Morris Overseas and as executive vice president of Philip Morris - International. Mr. Weissman also contributed heavily to Philip Morris Companies' successful diversification into other businesses. Mr. Weissman was essential to the creation of the company's program of support for the visual and performing arts, which became one of the largest of its kind, known for its emphasis on innovative work. Mr. Weismann served on the board of the Whitney Museum of American Art from 1979 to 1990. In 1983, under his leadership, Philip Morris donated the ground floor of its new Park Avenue headquarters to the Whitney as a popular midtown branch. By 1990, when Mr. Weissman retired as director emeritus, the company had emerged as the largest sponsor of dance in the U.S., and a 1994 report on 35 years of Philip Morris' arts contributions ran to 130 pages. Mr. Weissman was heavily involved with Lincoln Center from its earliest days, joining its Board of Directors in 1972 and serving as the board chair from 1986 to 1994. He raised much of the $150 million needed to build the Samuel B. and David Rose Building and was instrumental in the creation of Jazz at Lincoln Center. Mr. Weissman was deeply committed to civil rights. During his tenure, Philip Morris became the first tobacco company to employ blacks in high positions. The company also enthusiastically employed women and, in 1970, the company's Virginia Slims brand became the first corporate sponsor of women's tennis. Mr. Weissman leaves behind a substantial legacy, not only in business, but in his service to his country and the numerous causes he believed in and supported, most notably in the arts, education and civil rights. The Altria Board of Directors and employees of Altria's companies pay warm tribute to Mr. Weissman's memory and his legendary accomplishments, and extend their deepest sympathy to his family. Mr. Weissman is survived by his wife Mildred (nee Stregack), sons Paul J. Weissman and Daniel Weissman, daughter Ellen Weissman, and one grandson."

Mr. Twiss was born in New York City. He graduated from Phillips Exeter and Yale University. His lifelong commitment to ocean and marine conservation began early in his career when he joined the National Science Foundation, where he managed scientific research in the Antarctic. He then joined the NSF's Office of Ocean Exploration, where he led research-based expeditions. In 1974, Mr. Twiss became the first Executive Director of the Marine Mammal Commission, a new and independent government agency dedicated to the protection of marine mammals. He served in this role, shaping all aspects of the Commission, for 26 years until he retired in 2000. His dedication to the survival of marine mammals and healthy oceans helped save species such as the Hawaiian monk seal, West Indian manatee, North Atlantic right whale and California sea otter. Mr. Twiss was a strong proponent of stewardship of the land through youth education. He served on the board of the Student Conservation Association from 1986 through 2009 as a Board Member, Chairman and Chairman Emeritus. During his tenure on the board, he offered outstanding leadership while drawing on his commitment to preserving our environment and building the next generation of conservation leaders. He oversaw unprecedented growth in land protection programs and inspired thousands of young people to service. He was instrumental in the development of the Island School and Cape Eleuthera Institute, serving as a board member for both for 11 years. Mr. Twiss served on numerous other boards, including those of the Michael C. Rockefeller Memorial Fellowship at Harvard University, the Ocean Conservancy, and the Marine Conservation Biology Institute. Mr. Twiss received the Founders Award in 2000 from the Student Conservation Association, and the John Phillips Award in 2002 from his alma mater Phillips Exeter, for his service to his country, extraordinary leadership and invaluable contributions to ocean and environmental conservation. The Board on Geographic Names designated an Antarctic mountain as Mount Twiss, and the Society for Marine Mammalogy established the John R. Twiss, Jr. Award for Innovative Research. Mr. Twiss was a member of The Army Navy Club, The Metropolitan Club, the Squadron A Association, and the Scraggy Neck Rescue Team.

2009-07-30T00:00:00Z,"NUTTLE--Margaret Henry Penick, on Monday, July 27, 2009. Margaret Henry Penick Nuttle, 96, died at her home. She was 96. She was born at Bloomfield, NJ on March 11, 1913. Daughter of Margaret Henry Dabney Penick of Lynchburg, VA and Sydnor Barksdale Penick of Culpeper, VA; and was a descendant of Patrick Henry. Educated at the Kimberly School, Montclair, NJ and Hollins College, Roanoke, VA, Mrs. Nuttle also attended the Boston Conservatory of Music and made a recording of Classical music. Mrs. Nuttle made her debut in 1931 in Montclair and New York City. On September 10, 1938 she married Philip Everngam Nuttle of Denton, MD at the First Baptist Church in Montclair, NJ and they went to Bermuda on their wedding trip before settling into domestic life in Montclair where their three children were born: Emily Dabney Nuttle, Philip Everngam Nuttle and Margaret Barksdale Nuttle. In 1947, the Nuttle family moved to Denton, MD and summered with the Penick Family in Middletown, NJ where they were members of the Rumson Lawn and Tennis Club and the Seabright Beach Club. A move to Easton, Maryland in 1952 established Mrs. Nuttle's last permanent residence, ""Return Point"", although she maintained a house, ""Encore"", with her husband and another house ""Oleander"" as a widow, on Juniper Island in Hobe Sound, FL where she was a member of the Jupiter Island Club and the Hobe Sound Yacht Club. She was also a member of the Harbor Club, Easton, MD; Tred Avon Yacht Club, Oxford, MD; and the Mount Vernon Club, Baltimore, MD. Music, travel and community service were very important to Mrs. Nuttle. For many years she traveled from the Eastern Shore to Philadelphia for the Symphony Season and subscribed to the Baltimore Symphony Orchestra. She delighted her family with playing pieces by Haydn and Schumann year round and carols at Christmas. Mrs. Nuttle made many Grand Tours of Europe with her family and was quite adventuresome to travel by Concorde to Paris in 1989. She and her husband also enjoyed trips to the Bahamas and Cuba before Castro as well as a trip with the Smithsonian to Australia. She was a community leader wherever she lived including: membership in the Junior League and the American Red Cross, World War II in Montclair; President of her Freshman Class at Hollins College; Cub Scout Den Mother in Denton; a Gray Lady at Easton Memorial Hospital and President of both the Easton and the Jupiter Island Garden Clubs. Mrs. Nuttle's favorite projects recently have revolved around her Ancestor, Patrick Henry and the Board of Trustees at his last home, ""Red Hill"" near Lynchburg, VA. Through both the Board and the Descendant's Branch, she helped to teach historically accurate and nationally important facts about Patrick Henry's life and influence before and during the American Revolution. Mrs. Nuttle sponsored special presentations of reenactments of Patrick Henry's famous ""Liberty or Death"" speech at the Princeton Presbyterian Church and at St. John's Church in Richmond, VA, the original site of Henry's passionate plea to resist England's domination of the New World Colonies. Mrs. Nuttle also promoted learning the lessons taught by P. Henry's ""Parsons Cause Case"" which became his first experience with rhetorical fame. She established Colonial History Programs at Washington College and John's Hopkins University. She has been a benefactor to Princeton University, The University of Virginia, The Virginia Museum of History in Richmond, and the Hampden Sydney in Farmville, VA and she has established a Research Fellowship at the Smithsonian Library in honor of her Mother, who was a published poet. She made contributions to the Theatre of the Arts and the Cemetery in Lynchburg, VA and was given Keys to the City in appreciation for her efforts. She is both a member of the National Society of the Colonial Dames of America and the Colonial Dames, Chapter One. Becoming a member of the Godwin Society of Colonial Williamsburg was a great honor. The development of the Country School in Easton and the Historical Society of Caroline County in Denton have been favorite Maryland interests. She is survived by her daughters: Emily D.N. Fuchs of Baltimore, MD and Seal Harbor, ME and Margaret B.N. Melcher of Easton, MD; and two grandsons: Stephen P.C. Fuchs of Jacksonville, FL and Philip E. Nuttle, III of New York City. She was predeceased by her husband, Philip E. Nuttle, Sr. and her son, Philip E. Nuttle, Jr. Services will be held on Tuesday, August 4, 2009 at 3:00pm at the Old Wye Episcopal Church, Wye Mills, MD. Burial will be private. In lieu of flowers, contributions may be sent to: Memorial Hospital at Easton, 219 S. Washington St., Easton, MD 21601; Christ Episcopal Church, 111 S.

2009-07-31T11:20:00Z,"The musicians of the Baltimore Symphony Orchestra agreed Thursday to a 12.5 percent pay cut as the orchestra faced its first deficit in two years, The Baltimore Sun reported. The orchestra had planned to close that gap using $2.7 million from its endowment, but its investment portfolio has declined 21 percent since August 2008, The Sun said. In April, the orchestra’s musicians said that they would give back $1 million in wage freezes and other concessions, including an 8 percent reduction in the salary and benefits package that its performers were scheduled to receive for the 2009-10 season; the new pay cut is in addition to that. And in June, the orchestra announced that it had extended the contract of its musical director, Marin Alsop, through August 2015, noting that its annual giving to the orchestra had increased but the size of individual gifts had decreased, as had ticket sales for the 2008-2009 season.

Mr. Fisher, now a computer programmer, had filed his suit in 2005 against his former fellow band members Gary Brooker and Keith Reid, and a court ruled that he was entitled to 40 percent of the song&#8217;s copyright. But last year an appeals court overturned that ruling, saying that Mr. Fisher had waited too long to exercise his claim. ... An Australian judge&#8217;s ruling will make it possible for a song publisher to sue in a dispute over the rock band Men at Work&#8217;s 1981 hit &#8220;Down Under,&#8221; BBC News reported. The publisher, Larrikin Music, says that Men at Work took the flute riff for its hit from the song &#8220;Kookaburra Sits in the Old Gum Tree,&#8221; written by Marion Sinclair in 1934 for the youth organization Girl Guides. The band disputed Larrikin&#8217;s claim that it bought the song&#8217;s copyright in 1990, but a judge ruled that the publisher does own the song, clearing the way for Larrikin to sue Sony BMG and EMI for breach of copyright."

But a housing mix-up pairs her with Zoe Burkis (Corri English), a pink-haired rebel the same age as Alice's children, whose purpose for attending Smith is to get away from her mother. The semester is all about personal growth, and boy, does Alice grow. She becomes the college's oldest basketball player, ever. She also finds common ground with Zoe, including the Byronic poetry professor Terry O'Neil (Jeffrey Nordling), whose attraction to Alice jeopardizes her relationship with her roommate and, when the dean finds out, her education. 8 P.M. (TCM) SUMMER UNDER THE STARS: HENRY FONDA This August film festival begins its seventh season with an overview of Fonda's work, starting with his Oscar-nominated role in ''The Grapes of Wrath'' (1940) as Tom Joad (above with, from left, Dorris Bowdon and Jane Darwell), the Oklahoma farmer who goes to California in search of a better life during the Great Depression. In ''The Farmer Takes a Wife'' (1935), at 10:15, Fonda, in his film debut, plays a country bachelor who tries to persuade a cook (Janet Gaynor) on a canal boat to give up the excitement for him. In ''Jezebel'' (1938), at midnight, he stars as the fiancé who turns his back on Bette Davis's willful Southern belle; in ''The Male Animal'' (1942), at 2 a.m., he's a college professor fighting censorship and the amorous football player (Jack Carson) who is after his wife (Olivia de Havilland). The programming ends at 4 with ''The Long Night'' (1947), with Fonda as a veteran who tries to free his former love (Barbara Bel Geddes) from a sadist (Vincent Price)."

I remember my time there as we remember most of our travels - vivid and thrilling, everything new and strange. My ex-fake-wife Carolyn and I often reminisce nostalgically about our honeymoon there: ordering un balde hielo from room service to cool our Coronas every afternoon, the black-velvet painting of the devil on the toilet that she made me buy, our shared hilarious terror of kidnapping and murder, the giant pork rind I wrangled through customs. Which is funny, since, if I think back honestly, while I was actually there I did not feel ""happy."" In fact, as mi esposa did not hesitate to point out to me at the time, I griped incessantly about the noise and stink of the city - the car horns playing shrill, uptempo versions of the theme from ""The Godfather"" or ""La Cucaracha"" every second, the noxious mix of diesel fumes and urine, the air so filthy we'd been there a week before I learned we had a view of the mountains."

2009-08-02T00:00:00Z,"BORDEAU--J. William, 71, died unexpectedly on July 25, 2009. Among his many gifts, Bill is remembered for his strength of spirit, abiding compassion and joy for life. Born in Marquette, Michigan, the son of Raymond H. and Mary Ellen (Hogan) Bordeau, he received his AB in Theatre and English at Northern Michigan University and his MA in Theatre from the University of Michigan, and later continued his studies at Columbia University. Bill began college teaching in 1961 at Suffolk Community College (Selden) in theatre and communication arts and served as the design consultant for its Shea Theatre. In 1968 he was employed by Marymount Manhattan College where he established the BFA programs in Acting and in Dance and served as the design consultant for the Theresa Lang Theatre (dedicated in 1975 as the Marymount Manhattan Theatre). For over 30 years, Bill's unwavering dedication, expansive artistic vision and vibrant personality built a strong foundation for the success of the Theatre Arts and Dance programs, contributed substantially to the overall spirit and strength of MMC, and inspired generations of students. He was named Professor Emeritus of Theatre Arts upon his retirement in 1999 and alumni, colleagues and friends established the J. William Bordeau Theatre Arts Scholarship to honor his commitment to MMC's mission. Bill taught and guest directed at other colleges including Fordham, Hunter, SUNY Stony Brook and Columbia University and worked professionally in opera, television and film. As a theatre artist he felt a strong affinity to the works of Beckett, Pinter, Ionesco, Shepard and Albee for the richness their subtext and theatricality. A board member for several institutions including the Alvin Ailey Dance Foundation, Circum-Arts Foundation and the Neurological Research Foundation of NYC, Bill also served as the US consultant to the Drama Studio (London). An ardent New Yorker and long-time East Village resident, he worked with ""Sweet Fourteen"" for the revitalization of Union Square. Bill is survived by his partner of 24 years, Randal Tupper; by his twin brother and sister-in-law, Robert M. and Sharon A. Bordeau of Ann Arbor, Michigan; by his sister, Jeanne M. Bordeau of Moss Landing, California; by his niece, Catherine A. Bordeau (Hira Herrington) of Batesville, Ark.; by his nephews James M. Bordeau (Jodi) of Ann Arbor and Mark Frein (Jessica) of Vancouver, B.C.; by his grandnieces Eloise M. and Liana M. Bordeau of Ann Arbor; and by many dear friends. At Bill's request his body has been donated to Columbia Presbyterian Medical Center for research, and his ashes will be interred at Holy Cross Cemetery in Marquette, Michigan. A memorial service in celebration of Bill's life will be announced at a later date for the fall. Donations to support the J. William Bordeau Theatre Arts Scholarship may be sent to the Office of Institutional Advancement, Marymount Manhattan College, 221 East 71st Street, New York, New York 10021."

2009-08-02T00:00:00Z,"NUTTLE--Margaret Henry Penick, on Monday, July 27, 2009. Margaret Henry Penick Nuttle, 96, died at her home. She was 96. She was born at Bloomfield, NJ on March 11, 1913. Daughter of Margaret Henry Dabney Penick of Lynchburg, VA and Sydnor Barksdale Penick of Culpeper, VA; and was a descendant of Patrick Henry. Educated at the Kimberly School, Montclair, NJ and Hollins College, Roanoke, VA, Mrs. Nuttle also attended the Boston Conservatory of Music and made a recording of Classical music. Mrs. Nuttle made her debut in 1931 in Montclair and New York City. On September 10, 1938 she married Philip Everngam Nuttle of Denton, MD at the First Baptist Church in Montclair, NJ and they went to Bermuda on their wedding trip before settling into domestic life in Montclair where their three children were born: Emily Dabney Nuttle, Philip Everngam Nuttle and Margaret Barksdale Nuttle. In 1947, the Nuttle family moved to Denton, MD and summered with the Penick Family in Middletown, NJ where they were members of the Rumson Lawn and Tennis Club and the Seabright Beach Club. A move to Easton, Maryland in 1952 established Mrs. Nuttle's last permanent residence, ""Return Point"", although she maintained a house, ""Encore"", with her husband and another house ""Oleander"" as a widow, on Juniper Island in Hobe Sound, FL where she was a member of the Jupiter Island Club and the Hobe Sound Yacht Club. She was also a member of the Harbor Club, Easton, MD; Tred Avon Yacht Club, Oxford, MD; and the Mount Vernon Club, Baltimore, MD. Music, travel and community service were very important to Mrs. Nuttle. For many years she traveled from the Eastern Shore to Philadelphia for the Symphony Season and subscribed to the Baltimore Symphony Orchestra. She delighted her family with playing pieces by Haydn and Schumann year round and carols at Christmas. Mrs. Nuttle made many Grand Tours of Europe with her family and was quite adventuresome to travel by Concorde to Paris in 1989. She and her husband also enjoyed trips to the Bahamas and Cuba before Castro as well as a trip with the Smithsonian to Australia. She was a community leader wherever she lived including: membership in the Junior League and the American Red Cross, World War II in Montclair; President of her Freshman Class at Hollins College; Cub Scout Den Mother in Denton; a Gray Lady at Easton Memorial Hospital and President of both the Easton and the Jupiter Island Garden Clubs. Mrs. Nuttle's favorite projects recently have revolved around her Ancestor, Patrick Henry and the Board of Trustees at his last home, ""Red Hill"" near Lynchburg, VA. Through both the Board and the Descendant's Branch, she helped to teach historically accurate and nationally important facts about Patrick Henry's life and influence before and during the American Revolution. Mrs. Nuttle sponsored special presentations of reenactments of Patrick Henry's famous ""Liberty or Death"" speech at the Princeton Presbyterian Church and at St. John's Church in Richmond, VA, the original site of Henry's passionate plea to resist England's domination of the New World Colonies. Mrs. Nuttle also promoted learning the lessons taught by P. Henry's ""Parsons Cause Case"" which became his first experience with rhetorical fame. She established Colonial History Programs at Washington College and John's Hopkins University. She has been a benefactor to Princeton University, The University of Virginia, The Virginia Museum of History in Richmond, and the Hampden Sydney in Farmville, VA and she has established a Research Fellowship at the Smithsonian Library in honor of her Mother, who was a published poet. She made contributions to the Theatre of the Arts and the Cemetery in Lynchburg, VA and was given Keys to the City in appreciation for her efforts. She is both a member of the National Society of the Colonial Dames of America and the Colonial Dames, Chapter One. Becoming a member of the Godwin Society of Colonial Williamsburg was a great honor. The development of the Country School in Easton and the Historical Society of Caroline County in Denton have been favorite Maryland interests. She is survived by her daughters: Emily D.N. Fuchs of Baltimore, MD and Seal Harbor, ME and Margaret B.N. Melcher of Easton, MD; and two grandsons: Stephen P.C. Fuchs of Jacksonville, FL and Philip E. Nuttle, III of New York City. She was predeceased by her husband, Philip E. Nuttle, Sr. and her son, Philip E. Nuttle, Jr. Services will be held on Tuesday, August 4, 2009 at 3:00pm at the Old Wye Episcopal Church, Wye Mills, MD. Burial will be private. In lieu of flowers, contributions may be sent to: Memorial Hospital at Easton, 219 S. Washington St., Easton, MD 21601; Christ Episcopal Church, 111 S.

2009-08-02T00:00:00Z,"TALK SHOW One of the great treats of going to school in New Haven -- and in those days it would be hard to think of another one -- was the presence of the Shubert Theater, a few steps from the Yale campus. That gloomy city was a ''tryout town.'' Virtually all shows on their way to Broadway first played there. The Yale Dramat, the undergrad drama organization, would invite the stars from the Shubert to a cocktail party, and often, to my amazement and delight, they accepted. Richard Burton came with his co-stars in ''Time Remembered'' -- Helen Hayes and Susan Strasberg. I had lost my heart to Susan in ''Anne Frank'' and yet, like everyone else, I was drawn to Burton. Even with two other stars in the room, the current seemed to carry everyone to him, including the two other stars. Someone mentioned Laurence Olivier. Richard said that he and Olivier had worked out a song-and-dance duet with hats and canes that they performed at those all-star charity events the Brits love so much, where stars would come from their plays and do a ''Midnight Matinee.''"

It's a valid concern because a greater number of older people are on the road and they are driving more miles than before, according to the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety.

It would have been easier for General Manager Ruben Amaro Jr. to give the Toronto Blue Jays the elite prospects they wanted for Halladay and make the bigger splash. But Amaro tried to accommodate the present and the future by hanging on to his best young players and instead made a deal to get Lee from Cleveland. The Blue Jays said they wanted to be overwhelmed to trade Halladay, which is why they asked the Phillies for pitcher J. A. Happ, the Class AA pitcher Kyle Drabek and the Class A outfielder Dominic Brown. Once Amaro realized that J. P. Ricciardi, the Blue Jays' general manager, was not budging from his request, he stopped pursuing Halladay."

She was 88 years old and succumbed to the effects of a recent stroke. Born and raised in Dorchester, MA, Dr. Sopka was fourth of six siblings. She attended Girls Latin High School in Boston and Radcliffe College (now Harvard University) where she earned a Bachelors degree in physics. In 1943, she married John J. Sopka, from Elizabeth, NJ, they celebrated their 66th anniversary this spring. During the war, the couple was moved to Dayton, OH, where husband John was a physicist with the Manhattan Project and their first child, John R. Sopka, now of Groton, MA, was born in 1944. After the war, they returned to Harvard to complete their graduate degrees. Despite the birth of their other two children, Robert J. Sopka, of Catonsville, MD, and Elisabeth M. Sopka, formerly of Marblehead and now of Boston, MA, Katherine completed a Masters degree in physics while John completed his Ph.D. in Mathematics, both at Harvard. ""Mom told me just days before she died, that she was never, ever bored. The pattern of her life truly bears that out"", said Elisabeth. The family lived in Silver Spring, MD, Elizabeth, NJ, and Boulder, CO. Later she and husband John lived in Arlington, TX, Framingham, MA, and Durango, CO before finally relocating to Marblehead. In New Jersey, Katherine taught physics at Newark State Teachers College and later at the University of Colorado in Boulder. There she worked with Professors Frank Oppenheimer and David Hawkins on curriculum development for physics instruction including the PSSC Physics Project. Katherine worked with Professor Gerald Holton at Harvard in the History of Science Department with whom she completed her Ph.D. in 1976. Her dissertation details the development of quantum physics in the United States during the first part of the twentieth century. This research was later published by the American Institute of Physics as the book, Quantum Physics in America: The Years through 1935. Thereafter, she served as editor for the American Institute of Physics History of Modern Physics series of books. She conducted numerous interviews with many noted physicists, including Nobel Prize winners Van Vleck and Edward M. Purcell which are now at the Neils Bohr Library & Archives. Prof. Holton stated that ""Her skills as an interviewer were unparalleled, and I highly valued her as a collaborator. The interviews she conducted with the members of the Physics Department form a valuable record for Harvard University and are stored in their archives for future generations."" Her last project was an account of the essential work performed at the Bonebrake Seminary in Dayton, Ohio and its contributions to the Manhattan Project. This little known, highly secret site was responsible for the trigger for the bomb dropped on Nagasaki. This work is to appear in Physics in Perspective.

What they found was that the young athletes, aged 9-16, didn't drink enough. Most of them, in fact, had arrived at the camps dehydrated to one degree or another, and proceeded to dry themselves out far more over the course of the four-day camps. Practicing on average three times a day, the kids became progressively more dehydrated day by day, as measured by the concentration of their urine and by declines in their body weight, despite the fact that water was available during every practice session. By the end of the camps, between 50 and 75 percent of the 128 kids were at least ""significantly"" dehydrated, and in 25 to 30 percent of these, the condition was ""serious."""

2009-08-04T00:00:00Z,"The image of cows as placid, gentle creatures is a city slicker's fantasy, judging from an article, published on Friday by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, reporting that about 20 people a year are killed by cows in the United States. In some cases, the cows actually attack humans -- ramming them, knocking them down, goring them, trampling them and kicking them in the head -- resulting in fatal injuries to the head and chest. Mother cows, like other animals, can be fiercely protective of their young, and dairy bulls, the report notes, are ''especially possessive of their herd and occasionally disrupt feeding, cleaning and milking routines.''"

Jordan Scott, who describes herself as a singer, screenwriter and college student on her Web site jordanscott.com, wrote a little-known novel called “The Nocturne” as a teenager, releasing parts of it online before publishing it as a book in 2006. Her lawyer, J. Craig Williams, told Reuters that it contains situations that are similar to those in “Breaking Dawn,” the fourth in Ms. Meyer’s series, which has sold more than 70 million copies worldwide and spawned a film franchise. In a cease-and-desist letter sent to Ms. Meyer’s publisher, Hachette Book Group, Mr. Williams drew comparisons between scenes involving a wedding, a tryst on a beach and a description of the transformation from human to vampire. He added that characters in both books called their wives “love.”"

Ms. Allen’s play “I Got Sick Then I Got Better” tracks her journey from diagnosis through treatment and recovery and will be performed on four consecutive Mondays beginning on Sept. 14. Ms. Allen is both a comic and a writer, for The New Yorker and other publications; she published a collection of fables for grown-ups, “The Long Chalkboard,” which was illustrated by her husband, Jules Feiffer. “I Got Sick Then I Got Better” will be directed by James Lapine and Darren Katz. Ms. Shear’s new play, “Restoration,” which recently concluded a critically praised run at the La Jolla Playhouse, is to open in the spring of 2010. Ms. Shear will star as Giulia, a struggling art restorer who is tapped to spiff up David in time for its 500th anniversary in Florence. Christopher Ashley will direct; he worked with Ms. Shear previously on her play “Blown Sideways Through Life,” and he also directed the Broadway productions of “Xanadu” and “The Rocky Horror Show.”."

2009-08-05T00:00:00Z,"Ticket sales for the second annual All Points West festival, above, at Liberty State Park in Jersey City last weekend were down a little from last year, and some bands were canceled because of stormy weather on Sunday, but the event’s promoter said he was not giving up on the New York region. Paid attendance for the festival, which opened on Friday with Jay-Z as the headliner, was 71,500 for all three days, down about 4,000 from last year, said Paul Tollett, president of Goldenvoice, the promoter. But the weather hurt sales even before the festival began, Mr. Tollett added: heavy rain last week may have kept many people from buying last-minute tickets, a crucial source of revenue for most festivals. Over the seven days that ended on Sunday, the National Weather Service reported 5.1 inches of rain for Newark; 2.97 inches were reported on July 29 alone, two days before the festival began. Mr. Tollett said in a telephone interview on Tuesday morning that he did not yet have a contract with Liberty State Park for next year but hoped to return. “This show needs time to develop and find its home,” he said. “I’d like to do it again. I’d like it not to rain.”."
2009-08-05T00:00:00Z,"The New York Philharmonic has appointed John Mangum as its new artistic administrator. Zarin Mehta, the orchestra’s president and executive director, made the announcement on Tuesday. Mr. Mangum will work with Alan Gilbert, the orchestra’s new music director, to help choose repertory and soloists and deal with other elements of programming. For the last two years Mr. Mangum has been the vice president for artistic planning for the Saint Paul Chamber Orchestra and was involved in planning that orchestra’s 50th-anniversary season beginning last year, including its International Chamber Orchestra Festival and its return to Carnegie Hall in May 2008 after an absence of 10 years. Before the chamber orchestra Mr. Mangum worked in various positions with the Los Angeles Philharmonic Association, where he was at one point responsible for all aspects of the orchestra’s programming at the Hollywood Bowl and was involved with the programming of the Philharmonic’s winter season at Walt Disney Concert Hall. Mr. Mangum replaces Matías Tarnopolsky, who has been named the director of Cal Performances at the University of California, Berkeley."
2009-08-05T00:00:00Z,"Peace, love, understanding and nostalgia do not seem to be quite enough to resurrect a 40th-anniversary version of Woodstock. Michael Lang, one of the event’s original promoters, told Rolling Stone magazine that he had dropped plans to put together a third-anniversary concert — after ones in 1994 and 1999. Asked why, Mr. Lang told the magazine simply: “Money. No sponsors.” Mr. Lang, one of four partners who helped produce Woodstock in 1969 (right), earlier dropped plans to hold a free concert in Prospect Park in Brooklyn in mid-August because he could not find ways to cover the $8 million to $10 million it would have cost to mount. Then he began planning for an event to be held in late September. It would have coincided with Climate Week NYC, a joint effort of the United Nations, New York City and the Climate Group, an international awareness organization — scheduled for the week of Sept. 21, to coincide with the opening of the 64th session of the United Nations General Assembly — to draw attention to global climate change. But Woodstock will still be very much in the air this summer. “Taking Woodstock,” a comedy directed by Ang Lee, will open in theaters on Aug. 28. This movie is based on a book by Elliot Tiber, who ran a motel with his parents in Bethel, N.Y., during the Woodstock festival. Mr. Lang is one of the movie’s characters, played by the actor Jonathan Groff."

Eli Mason was held in the highest esteem by all who had the good fortune to know him. His generosity was matched only by his modesty and his tireless work on behalf of his alma mater. In 1968, he was elected the first president of The Baruch College Fund. From that day forward, in addition to making his own gifts to Baruch, he worked constantly to reengage his fellow alumni in the life of the College. Eli endowed the Eli Mason Chair in Accountancy in 1992, and in 1996, together with his wife Claire, an alumna from the class of 1940, funded the res- toration of the beautiful auditorium that became Mason Hall. A pillar of integrity in the accounting profession, Eli Mason was repeatedly named among the ""100 most influential"" accountants in the nation. Among his many honors, he was past president of the New York State Society of Certified Public Accountants, past president of the Foundation for Accounting Education, and past chairman of the New York State Board for Public Accountancy. His CPA colleagues called him ""the conscience of the profession."" Baruch College honored him with an Honorary Doctor of Humane Letters in 1978 and in 1987 he received the Distinguished Alumnus Award at the annual Bernard Baruch Dinner. Eli Mason sincerely loved Baruch College and directly credited the education he received here for his professional success. His love was reciprocated by the many members of the Baruch family, including students and staff, who regularly came in contact with him.

Elected president of the New York State Society of Certified Public Accountants at the age of 50, Eli purposefully carved out a new direction for public accountancy based on pure understanding of the law and an unfettered passion for fairness. He was instrumental in the formation of CPA Associates, a national advocacy group dedicated to allowing the small and medium-sized accounting firms to have an equal voice in the world of audits and accounting. As an expert witness he testified before U.S. Senate on several occasions and when speaking extemporaneously could easily hold an audience of hundreds enthralled by his remarkable ability to remember facts, figures and faces. He never let the onset of decreasing vision stand in the way of being the smartest, most insightful presence in any room. He will be remembered for his unmatched insight, untouchable integrity and his unbridled compassion. A memorial service will be held at noon, September 13, 2009 in Mason Hall at Baruch College."

Both terms had been applied to broadcasters in other contexts before the conventions. The obituary also included an erroneous anecdote from the autobiography about the extent of his fame.

The announcement was made Wednesday by ABC Media Productions, the branch of Disney that owns the show. The pair, whose broadcasts will begin on Sept. 7, replace Ben Lyons of E! Entertainment Television and Ben Mankiewicz of Turner Classic Movies. “At the Movies” began in 1986, hosted by Mr. Siskel and Mr. Ebert, and known for their thumbs down, thumbs up system. When Mr. Siskel died in 1999, a succession of guest hosts, including Mr. Scott, followed. “Impersonating yourself on television is both more fun and more difficult, with or without the aid of thumbs, than it looks,” Mr. Scott wrote of the experience.

Jordan Scott, who describes herself as a singer, screenwriter and college student on her Web site, jordanscott.com, wrote a little-known novel called “The Nocturne” as a teenager, releasing parts of it online before publishing it as a book in 2006. Her lawyer, J. Craig Williams, told Reuters that it contains situations similar to those in “Breaking Dawn,” the fourth in Ms. Meyer’s series, which has sold more than 70 million copies worldwide and spawned a film franchise. In a cease-and-desist letter sent to Ms. Meyer’s publisher, Hachette Book Group, Mr. Williams drew comparisons between scenes involving a wedding, a tryst on a beach and a description of the transformation from human to vampire. Ms. Scott plans to file a copyright infringement lawsuit in federal court, Mr. Williams said, though she does not plan to seek monetary damages. Representatives from Hachette called the accusation “meritless,” according to Reuters, adding that Ms. Meyers didn’t know about “The Nocturne,” and that “The Twilight Saga” was her work entirely."
2009-08-06T00:00:00Z,"The classical music and dance worlds continue to face difficulties mounting new work, or in some cases even paying their artists. The administrative offices of the Houston Symphony are closed this week as part of a furlough deal the company announced last week, The Houston Chronicle reported. The symphony’s 86 musicians will also take two unpaid weeks off in the coming months — up from one week in previous years — and its conductors will accept reduced salaries in a move that is expected to save nearly $900,000, part of an overall budget reduction of $1.5 million for the 2009-10 season. Matthew VanBesien, the symphony’s executive director said that the group’s performance schedule would not be affected by the cuts. Meanwhile the members of the Minnesota Orchestra have agreed to pay and pension cuts in a move that will save $4.2 million over three years, The Star-Tribune in Minneapolis reported. And just across the border Le Groupe Dance Lab, a contemporary troupe that’s been a fixture in Ottawa for 40 years, said it will cease operations in the fall, The Globe and Mail in Toronto reported. “Many factors, financial and otherwise, have led to this extremely difficult decision,” John Manwaring, the company’s chairman, said in a statement.

2009-08-06T00:00:00Z,"Animated characters are again causing scuffles for religious leaders, and this time they’re not in “South Park.” The Acropolis Museum in Greece has reversed a decision to cut part of a short film by the director Costa-Gavras after protests and the threat of a lawsuit, The Los Angeles Times reported. His animated short, shown as part of a longer film about the history of the Parthenon, included a scene in which cartoon characters wearing dark cloaks climb ladders and destroy part of the Parthenon’s frieze, a well-documented occurrence during the early Byzantine period when Christians often dismantled pagan landmarks. Officials from the Greek Orthodox Church contended that the scene misrepresented their attitude towards ancient history. After the scene was cut, Costa-Gavras, who has won two Oscars (for “Z” and “Missing”), asked that his name be removed from the film and complained to Greek media that he was being subjected to Soviet-style censorship. But when he explained that the cloaked figures were not priests but merely early Christians, the museum decided to reinstate the scene."

2009-08-06T00:00:00Z,"Pope John Paul II set the standard for the very model of a modern papacy. He wrote best-selling books, was a master of television and pushed the Vatican into the Internet age. His voice was also featured in major recordings. Now his successor, Pope Benedict XVI, right, is following suit. Geffen Records says it will release an album called “Alma Mater” that will include recordings of Benedict’s voice. Catholic News Service said the Benedict material will be drawn from the archives of Vatican Radio, including the pope’s vocal rendition of the “Regina Coeli” hymn to Mary and parts of prayers and talks in Latin and Italian and other modern languages. The pope’s spokesman, the Rev. Federico Lombardi, said that about 10 minutes of papal recordings will be used. The compact disc will also feature other prayers and original classical music works. The choir of the Philharmonic Academy of Rome, singing in St. Peter’s Basilica, and the Royal Philharmonic Orchestra will also perform on the CD, which will be released on Nov. 30, in time for Christmas. Benedict is something of a serious musician. He plays the piano, with a preference for Mozart, and once called Bach “perhaps the greatest musical genius of all time.” He has also frowned on rock ’n’ roll, terming it “an expression of base passions.”."

2009-08-06T00:00:00Z,"PEOPLE who fish in lakes and rivers have historically relied on boots with felt soles to help them keep their footing. But the felt on these shoes has been found to foster the spread of harmful parasites and algae that can sicken or kill fish and damage their environment. So, despite the popularity of felt soles, manufacturers have been busy trying to devise good alternatives. Indeed, fishing shoes with felt soles are already being phased out. New Zealand has outlawed them, and they will be banned in freshwater streams in southeast Alaska starting in 2011. Trout Unlimited, a conservation group based in Arlington, Va., last year called on the fishing equipment industry to phase out the use of felt by 2011, and some manufacturers have pledged to comply."

2009-08-06T00:00:00Z,"LANYI--Andrew, who rose from modest beginnings in Budapest, Hungary to become one of the top retail stockbrokers in Wall Street history, died from complications from liver cancer at his home in Manhattan on August 4, 2009. He was 84 years old. Andrew's birth in Budapest did not point to a career on Wall Street. During WWII, the Nazis enslaved Hungarian Jews and he endured a forced march building airstrips for the Luftwaffe. He and a friend escaped when Andrew used his ingenuity and lithographic skills to forge travel papers. As they moved from village to village, the local elders added legitimate stamps to their counterfeit pass. Eventually they returned to Budapest and hid in a nook behind brick ovens, the only known survivors of that forced march. After WWII, Andrew focused on a career in the theater in Budapest, directing modern and classical plays, tirelessly driving his cast and crew. He eventually became a director of programs for the radio. He was known as the ""Ed Sullivan"" of Hungarian radio. One day he met a lovely Doctor in training and shortly thereafter, he and Valery married. At the outbreak of the Hungarian Revolution, he and his pregnant wife escaped to Austria, literally crawling across the border avoiding border patrols with shoot to kill orders. Once in Vienna, they applied for asylum to the United States if they did not receive their papers within a month they would apply to Australia. The approval came through on day 30 and they were off to the U.S. courtesy of the American military. Landing at Camp Kilmer in New Jersey, they were picked up by Sutton Place relatives and transported to a new life via a gleaming white Cadillac limo. Andrew commented, ""I wonder how many families have to share this?"" As opportunities for a theater director with a thick Hungarian accent were limited, Andrew went to work for the New York Times in their ""morgue"", while his pregnant wife retrained as an Intern and Resident. Their first son George was born in May 1957. As their joint income was insufficient to feed three mouths, Andrew took on selling mutual funds at night. This new endeavor was classic Andrew as he was disciplined, applying new techniques, especially cold calling, almost exclusively (to start) to Hungarian names culled from phone books. Mutual funds led to selling stocks. Over the subsequent 50 years on Wall Street, he developed a passion for finding the right companies. He industriously and aggressively offered them to customers all over the world from Governors to doctors to lawyers. Andrew's pioneering career as a cold-calling stockbroker spanned firms such as Blythe Eastman Dillon, Lehman Brothers, Ladenburg Thalmann and Oppenheimer. He retired in 2007 as Executive Director of Investments of the Lanyi Group at Oppenheimer and Co. Inc. As his career took off, Andrew and Valery's second son Paul was born. Andrew and Valery divorced in the late 1960s and Andrew discovered the joys of New York dating, pursuing it as passionately and imaginatively as he did his work. In 1990, his son George died from complications due to AIDS. Andrew met his true love Diane Bickoff in 1993. Until his death, they had been together every day and night for nearly 17 years except for one night while he was in the hospital. They enjoyed a strong bond working together, holding hands every day, Andrew selling and Diane providing PR expertise and helping Andrew tweak his pitches day in, day out. She laughed at his jokes (even the very off-color ones) even on the twelfth telling. She was the love of his life and he hers. He is survived by Diane (his beloved wife), Paul (his son), Kristi (daughter-in-law), Luke George Lanyi (grandson), Mr. and Mrs. Leon Bickoff (mother-in-law and father-in-law), Laurie Kranz (sister-in-law) and Carl and Michael Kranz (nephews). A brief gathering will be held at The Frank E. Campbell Funeral Chapel at 1076 Madison Avenue (81st Street) from 2 to 3pm on Friday, August 7. Guests are encouraged to wear primary colors or bright clothing in memory of Andrew's colorful style of dressing."

Robert Siegel, Charles' Partner, as well as the office staff of Gwathmey Siegel & Associates Architects mourn the loss of its founding Partner and spiritual leader, Charles Gwathmey. Charles passed away after battling esophageal cancer for an extended period of time. He focused on the design of projects until his very last day. He loved being an architect, a commitment made as a teenager after touring through Europe with his parents, Robert Gwathmey, the well known artist and educator, and Rosalie, a photographer and textile designer. In addition to having a passion for creating architecture, he maintained an active involvement as an educator. He was a wonderful motivator who inspired all he came in contact with. Charles was also a very kind and caring person. He was fair minded and detested prejudice of any type. Charles and I collaborated for 41 years, often sharing a desk sitting face to face drawing and discussing ideas. We completed 400 projects ranging in scale from a birdhouse to a University, but more than any other building type, it was the exploration of the single family residence, initially summarized in the Amagansett, New York home for his parents completed in 1966, that set the foundation for and substantially shaped many of the architectural principles around which the work of our firm revolves. Charles Gwathmey's contribution to architecture is immeasurable. The opportunity to work with him has been a great experience for all who have passed through our office. As his partner and lifelong friend, I have experienced a wonderful and unique relationship. We looked forward to and enjoyed being with each other everyday, despite the complexities of life and the pressures inherent in the practice of architecture. I feel a great loss which at this point cannot be put into words. My wife, Hazel, and I send our deepest condolences to his wife, Bette-Ann, his son, Eric, and his daughter, Annie.

He was a devoted family man who also influenced the community and the world through his dedication, scholarship, philanthropy, public service and friendships. Eli excelled at his studies and as an honors graduate of Baruch College (1940) he quickly rose to the top of his field. As the founder and managing partner of Mason and Company for over fifty years and throughout his six year association with JH Cohn, he was the conscience of the accounting profession. Eli's drive and profound intellect inspired hundreds of accountants through his writings, leadership and unwavering dedication to clarity and purpose in the accounting profession. Elected president of the New York State Society of Certified Public Accountants at the age of 50, Eli purposefully carved out a new direction for public accountancy based on pure understanding of the law and an unfettered passion for fairness. He was instrumental in the formation of CPA Associates, a national advocacy group dedicated to allowing the small and medium-sized accounting firms to have an equal voice in the world of audits and accounting. As an expert witness he testified before U.S. Senate on several occasions and when speaking extemporaneously could easily hold an audience of hundreds enthralled by his remarkable ability to remember facts, figures and faces. He never let the onset of decreasing vision stand in the way of being the smartest, most insightful presence in any room. He will be remembered for his unmatched insight, untouchable integrity and his unbridled compassion. A memorial service will be held at noon, September 13, 2009 in Mason Hall at Baruch College."

Situated about 80 miles northeast of Rome, the ruins, which date back 2,000 years, were at the center of an ancient village called Falacrine, Vespasian’s hometown. The 150,000-square-foot complex is the only one of its kind in the area, which led a team of British and Italian archeologists to conclude that it was most likely the emperor’s home, said Filippo Coarelli, the lead archaeologist. The residence had “a well-preserved huge floor, decorated with luxurious marble coming from the whole Mediterranean area,” he said. “It’s clear that such things could only belong to someone with a high social position and wealth.” The four-year excavation also unearthed other ruins, including a necropolis burial ground."

Ruger, who retired a few years ago as chairman of the firearms company his father founded, recognized that after decades of renting the building out to light manufacturing, the industry was drying up. This weekend, the refurbished Newport Mill will host its inaugural art exhibition, ""H2O Film on Water,"" which features works - videos, paintings, photographs and site installations - on the theme of the water, from the effects brought on by global changes to the access to safe water in developing countries.Cynthia Reeves, the director of the Great Rivers Art Institute in Bellows Falls, Vt. (she also owns the Cynthia Reeves gallery in Manhattan), curated works by artists like Doug and Mike Starn, Daniel Wheeler and Anne Lindberg, while Denise Markonish (a Mass MOCA curator) will be awardingthe three juried prizes in a video competition. The work spreads out to three other nearby venues: the Great River Arts Institute, the Brattleboro Museum in Vermont and the Spheris Gallery in Hanover, N.H., through Nov. 7.

2009-08-07T16:37:34Z,"I have met countless parents who vowed that their children would be omnivores, exposed to all kinds of food from birth, happy to follow their parents palates wherever they might lead. I have met far fewer parents who didn't default to the few ""kid-friendly"" foods their particular child actually agreed to eat. Parents who used to see food as nutrition for the soul as well as the soma come to find themselves scarfing rather than savoring, as meals become quick and dirty and often consist of the crusts of whatever junior just had for dinner."

In New York on Saturday, a previously scheduled show at Le Poisson Rouge , a radio play written as a tribute to ""The Breakfast Club,"" will no doubt draw extra attention -- especially with Andrew W.K. in the Judd Nelson role.

2009-08-07T15:57:50Z,"Oh to be young. This is the overarching message of the oeuvre of John Hughes, who died yesterday, too young himself, from a heart attack. There were plenty of directors who immortalized teendom more profoundly. (Nicholas Ray sure comes to mind.) Hughes's gift was to give adolescent trivia-note-passing, boy-ogling, class-skipping, girl-crushing, exchange-student-loathing something almost like importance. Before MTV would turn into a cultural arbiter and tell the youth how to dress, it was the high-Hughes canon (""Sixteen Candles,"" ""The Breakfast Club,"" ""Ferris Bueller's Day Off,"" ""Pretty in Pink"") that forged a tribe out of not-quite-cool characters and invited the rest of us to join in. And join in we did, donning bowler hats, ill-advised thrift combos, cuffed over-size blazers and lace accents to the almost-dark music of Simple Minds and the Psychedelic Furs. Fashion designers have rediscovered the light, quirky version of 1980s fashion that Hughes and his muse, Molly Ringwald, put together so well, as you can see with a skip through some of his films' more indelible costuming."

Somehow, despite the worst jet lag of my life (it felt like someone had dragged me in a back alley and beaten me to within an inch of my life), I rallied and decided to check out Tokyu Hands, a department store chain that started out as a crafts store in 1976.

This year, though, its new line, the Fundamentals of Makkum, with its simple forms in six back-to-basics shades ranging from light blond to deep chocolate, is the pared-down antithesis of those riotous projects.The Fundamentals line got its start at an Eindhoven art school, where Lonny van Ryswyck and Nadine Sterk (now known as Atelier NL) had produced a range of pottery as their graduation project.

Wife of the late music publisher and author Hans W. Heinsheimer. Deeply loved, cherished and respected mother of Thomas (Julie) and Frances (Barry); grandmother of Eric, Eden, Carla (Marco) and Julian (Cecilia); and great-grandmother of Lucas, Ryan, Max, Leo, Liam, Cleo, Amelie and Edan. Daughter of the late Adolf and Trude Heinsheimer, sister of Gabi (Werner) Fellner and the late Gerd (Lore) Heinsheimer, aunt of Joan, Jeffrey, David and Michael. Born in Karlsruhe, Germany in 1911, Dr. Heinsheimer studied dentistry at the University of Heidelberg, Germany, but was prevented from completing her degree by the Nazi racial laws. Emigrating to the U.S. in 1935, she graduated from the University of Pennsylvania School of Dental Medicine in 1937, one of two women in a graduating class of more than one hundred. She practiced dentistry in New York for more than 50 years and was acknowledged for her superb work in the field. She thrived on New York's cultural life and regularly attended opera, symphony, ballet, museum exhibitions and, her special love, chamber music concerts. In her final years she often said: ""I've had a wonderful life."" And indeed she did. She will be greatly missed but remembered with admiration and with love. The family is most grateful to Dr. Amy Frieman, Melida Sanchez, Alice Brown, Aida di Falco, and everyone at Hearthstone Esplanade Manhattan and Hospice of New York for their exceptional devotion and loving care.

The confrontation was closely monitored by foreign investors as a test of will for South Korean unions, which are known for their militant activism, and for the government of President Lee Myung-bak, which has vowed to ensure more flexibility for companies to shed workers in times of economic distress. After the compromise was reached, the remaining workers left the factory on police buses."

Born in Brooklyn, Mr. Samnick earned his B.B.A. in 1962 from City College of the City University of New York and his J.D. in 1965 from Brooklyn Law School. Mr. Samnick began his career working for the New York City Building Commission under Mayor John Lindsay, where he eventually served as the deputy commissioner for the Buildings Department. From 1969 until 1985, he worked for Warner Communications, eventually serving as senior vice president with responsibility over the labor affairs for Warner's myriad entertainment units. Among his many accomplishments in that role, Mr. Samnick was instrumental in signing international soccer stars Pele and Franz Beckenbauer to play for the North American Soccer League's New York Cosmos, a division of Warner at that time. In 1985, Mr. Samnick joined the law firm of Stroock & Stroock & Lavan as a partner and head of that firm's labor and employment and entertainment groups. In 2001, Mr. Samnick joined Bryan Cave LLP and served as a senior partner in the firm's Labor & Employment Group until his death. During the past 40 years, both while at Warner and in private practice, Mr. Samnick's law practice centered on providing labor and employment advice to clients in the entertainment industry, including sound recording, motion picture, television, video and licensing companies. As counsel to many of the major recording companies, Mr. Samnick served as the chief labor negotiator for the recording industry in its contract negotiations with the American Federation of Television and Radio Artists and the American Federation of Musicians. He also represented the John F. Kennedy Center for the Performing Arts, the Adrienne Arsht Center for the Performing Arts, Scholastic Entertainment and HBO with respect to labor negotiations and other related matters.

""He has been a great friend and mentor to many of us, and a wonderful partner and colleague to all of us.""

2009-08-08T00:00:00Z,"Insert your own “Burning down the house” joke here: David Byrne, above, is once again making music with architecture. This former Talking Heads frontman is staging “Playing the Building,” an installation in which a structure becomes an instrument, at the Roundhouse Theater in London, The Associated Press reported. The piece, similar to one he presented last summer at the Battery Maritime Building in Lower Manhattan, allows visitors to make the walls and ceiling vibrate and oscillate through a series of cables attached to a pump organ. The music — cacophonous and clangy — isn’t Bach, Mr. Byrne told The A.P., but that’s intentional. “It kind of levels the playing field as far as performance goes,” he said. “We are all equally amateur at it.” The Roundhouse, where the Talking Heads played with the Ramones and the Stranglers in 1976 to a crowd that expressed its appreciation by spitting, was built in 1846 as a railway station and has been a concert hall off and on since the 1960s. Marcus Davey, the theater’s artistic director, said, “This is the first time the Roundhouse has a chance to play for itself.” The installation runs from Saturday until Aug. 31."

Salinger’s “Catcher in the Rye” has been indefinitely banned by a federal judge. Citing the First Amendment and common sense, the media companies urged the United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit to reverse the order issued by Judge Deborah A. Batts of United States District Court in Manhattan on July 1. Ms. Batts ruled that “60 Years Later: Coming Through the Rye,” written by the Swedish author Fredrik Colting under the pen name J. D. California, was not a protected parody and commentary and therefore could not be published. In the brief the four companies wrote that the Supreme Court allowed publication of the Pentagon Papers despite national security concerns. The brief also outlined precedents in which courts have allowed publication of libelous material and let victims of the libel seek financial remedies after publication. George Freeman, vice president and assistant general counsel for the Times Company, said on Friday that while the media companies were sensitive to copyright and the need to protect writers from infringement of their work, this was not such a case. “Here the book clearly is a transformative use of the old ‘Catcher in the Rye,’ ” he said. “We’re taking a position of principle that banning books is a bad thing, and prior restraint is a bad thing.” The American Library Association and Public Citizen, a nonprofit consumer advocacy group, have also filed briefs in support of Mr. Colting."

About 80 miles northeast of Rome, the ruins (a part of which is at right), which date back 2,000 years, were at the center of the ancient village Falacrine, Vespasian’s hometown. The 150,000-square-foot complex is the only one of its kind in the area, which led a team of British and Italian archaeologists to conclude that it was most likely the emperor’s home, said Filippo Coarelli, the lead archaeologist. The residence had “a well-preserved huge floor, decorated with luxurious marble coming from the whole Mediterranean area,” he said. “It’s clear that such things could only belong to someone with a high social position and wealth.” The four-year excavation also unearthed other ruins, including a necropolis burial ground."

2009-08-08T00:00:00Z,"JOLSON--Leon, a survivor of the Warsaw Ghetto, a philanthropist, and an American businessman, died today at his home in New York City. He was 96 years old, and death was from natural causes. Born Leon Yosselson in Warsaw in 1913, and a graduate of the University of Warsaw, he emigrated to the United States in 1947, with his wife Anya Kotkowski, after five years spent in work camps, in hiding, and in DP camps. Although he arrived here with only six dollars in his pocket, he quickly established himself. The child of sewing machine importers, he knew the trade. In 1948, as founder and president of the Necchi Sewing Machine Sales Corporation in the United States, he was the first to bring a foreign sewing machine to America, the Italian Necchi, which could, without attachments, do a zig zag stitch, a blind stitch, embroider, and make buttonholes, all operations that here had to be done by hand. Subsequently, he also distributed Switzerland's portable Elna. The machines became so popular and the company so successful that within just a few years, Jolson became a symbol of survivor enterprise. He was honored by many, including the Jewish Theological Seminary, was profiled in the New York Times, Time Magazine, and Reader's Digest, and was also written about in a number of books, including Dorothy Rabinowitz's New Lives: Survivors of the Holocaust Living in America. In 1953, he began importing sewing machines from Japan, under the business name of the Nelco Corporation, and for many years he was the sole importer for J.C. Penney, Co. Surviving him are his daughter, Barbara and her husband David Blumenthal, grandchildren, Adam and Elana Blumenthal, Gideon Blumenthal, Shira Blumenthal, and a great-grandson Jonah. A daughter, Dorothy, died in 1984; his wife, Anya, in 2002. Shiva will be observed in private. Once here, Jolson's inclination to philanthropy quickly surfaced. He created his first fellowship in 1952, the day he became a citizen, giving $10,000 to Columbia University Teachers College to assist other refugees without, he insisted, regard to race, religion, or nationality. Later he established a foundation, now the Nelco Foundation, to support education and health causes, and also created the Leon Jolson Award, administered by the Jewish Book Council, for a nonfiction work on the subject of the Holocaust. The sculpture of the Polish-Jewish hero, Janos Korchak at New York's Park Avenue Synagogue was donated by Jolson, who also funded a casting of the Polish-Jewish sculptor Nathan Jacob Rapoport's Warsaw Ghetto Uprising for Israel's Holocaust Memorial, Yad Vashem. Nor did he forget to mark history in Poland itself. Because of Leon Jolson, one of the buildings in which he and his family hid, is now a landmark that symbolically, and anonymously, memorializes the mother, son, and wife who concealed themselves there to save their lives. In addition, the stone on his mother's grave in a Catholic cemetery, where she lay buried under a false name because outside the Ghetto she couldn't die as member of her own faith, has been altered to give her real identity. It now says, ""Here lies Blima Yosselson, buried here as a Christian because she couldn't be buried as a Jew."" A man of brilliance and complexity, his good deeds will be long remembered."

Tyler, a 6-foot-11 prospect from San Diego, is close to signing with Maccabi Haifa, which finished in second place in Israel's top division last season. ''We are very close,'' said Sonny Vaccaro, an adviser to Tyler. ''Everyone is in agreement.'' Tyler, 18, became the first player to drop out of high school to play basketball professionally outside the United States. He had committed to Louisville, but instead took the road traveled by Brandon Jennings, who played in Rome last season and became the No. 10 pick in the N.B.A. draft. Tyler plans to play two seasons overseas before being eligible for the 2011 draft.

2009-08-08T00:00:00Z,"LAZARUS--Stephen Michael, M.D.,a longtime resident of Great Neck, NY and most recently a resident of Dallas, TX, died August 5, 2009. He was 71. Stephen Lazarus was born May 3, 1938, to Dr. William and Blanche Lazarus in Brooklyn, NY. His brother Jack was born May 6, 1949. Stephen attended Poly Prep, where he played lacrosse, followed by Trinity College in Hartford, CT, where he was a pre-med student and became a star lacrosse goalie. In 1964, Stephen graduated from Duke Medical School and embarked on a long and successful career in Urology. Stephen did his residency at the Brooklyn Jewish Hospital. During that time, his father William met a woman named Brenda Levy, whom he took an immediate liking to but who was already engaged to someone else. He asked her, ""Are there are any more like you at home?"" William set his son up on a blind date with Brenda's sister, Helen. They were married June 5th, 1966. Friends and family say that although Stephen and Helen had completely opposite personalities, they were absolutely perfect for each other, calling them ""the most perfectly mis-matched pair."" After 43 years of marriage, Stephen and Helen never stopped holding hands and still kissed each other goodnight every evening before bed. Stephen and Helen's son Billy was born in 1971, followed by son Sasha in 1975. The family lived briefly in Jamaica Estates, Queens, before settling in Great Neck, NY. Stephen continued his medical practice in Brooklyn. Like his father before him, Stephen was a member of the United States Army and proudly served his country at West Point during the Gulf War. In 1993, looking for a change, the family moved to Dallas, Texas, where Stephen continued to practice Urology (now with a Southern accent) and Sasha attended Southern Methodist University. Sasha is now an OB-GYN in St. Louis, MO. Billy attended his father's alma mater, Trinity College, and is currently a talent agent at United Talent Agency in Beverly Hills. Stephen was very proud of both of his sons. He loved that Sasha had followed in his footsteps and became a doctor, and was equally excited by the success Billy achieved representing actors. Stephen loved hearing about the many movie premieres his son attended, but he mostly loved attending them with him. Stephen, Helen, and their sons took many trips together as a family, including traveling all over Europe, visiting Billy and Sasha's grandparents in Puerto Rico, as well as their grandparents' home in Cuddebackville, NY. The family has added several members to its group over the years and Stephen loved every one of them. Sasha married his medical-school sweetheart, Jeanine, in Florida in 2008, and Billy's longtime boyfriend, Brian, is Stephen and Helen's third ""much taller"" son. Stephen's non-human children include his and Helen's three Cavalier King Charles Spaniels Daisy, Roxy, and Dodger. Stephen's friends and family will miss the love, support, kindness, personality, and dry wit that made him such a wonderful man, husband, father, brother, uncle and brother-in-law. Stephen, you are forever in our hearts. Love, Helen, Billy, Sasha, Brian, Jeanine, Jack, Abby, Brenda, Al, Evan, Marc, Jonah, Lucas, Henry, Heidi, Glenn, Jamie, Benjamin, Ethan, and new Baby Zuckerman.

She makes sure to note that she does “not mean to recommend reading at the expenseof sewing.” Boys are to become men, girls are to become ladies and all are to become moral. She and her family were involved in Whig politics, but did she oppose any but the most misogynistic strains in society?

With the team's surge in stolen bases this season, and the emergence of Rajai Davis at the top of the lineup, fans may start cheering ''Run, Rajai, run!'' Oakland General Manager Billy Beane is famously averse to stolen bases. The last time the club recorded more than 100 steals in a season was 1998, his first season in charge. That was also Henderson's last year with the team. Beane's teams have reflected his taste and finished last in the majors in steals in 4 of the last 10 seasons, finishing in the top 20 only once. Oakland reached its low point in 2005, when the team had 31 steals."

He died on July 19, 2009, at home in St. Petersburg. Morris graduated from DeWitt Clinton High School, City College of New York and University of South Florida. He was a retired Professional Electrical Engineer and in the Naval Reserve. He started his career in New York City at CBS Radio and went to work for Emerson Radio & Television. In 1957, he went to work for Air Associates, now Ray- theon. Morris led the team that designed the WSC-3 ""Whiskey-3,"" a communication radio used by the US Army, Air Force, Marine Corps and Coast Guard. Many countries throughout the world have used and still use the Whiskey-3. He taught and was instrumental in the Electro-Mechanical/Electronics education program at Pinellas Vocational Institute and University of South Florida. Because of his contributions, Florida's graduates are better equipped to pursue their chosen careers. He was a member of the State of Florida Board of Professional Engineers, Lion's Club and an Associate Member of Hadassah. He married Doris Feilman in 1957 and Air Associates moved them to St. Petersburg, Florida, where both of their daughters were born and raised. Morris loved life and lived it to its fullest. He had an infectious laugh, a kind heart and a generous soul. In the '60s and '70s, he and Doris took their daughters on many family vacations. Occasionally they camped in their tent known as the ""Taj Mahal"" and he taught them the constellations, how to fish, start a fire, how to sail in a pram he built and how to enjoy the world that surrounds you. Morris was an avid sportsman. He hiked the Rockies, the Himalayas, the Alps, Masada, the Great Wall of China, and many other places. He rode a camel, an elephant and a mule with the locals. He sailed the waters of the world and was the captain of the ""Shalom"", on which his family shared many good times. He was also an avid bike rider, tennis player, golfer, archer, photographer, cross country skier, amateur radio service operator (""HAM"") and food connoisseur. In the 90s he took up woodworking and delighted in sharing his amazing creations with friends and family. He and Doris also began spending their summers at their home in Winter Park, CO with their family. Yes, he did live life to its fullest. Morris is survived by his forever love, Doris; his devoted daughters Debra Sedacca Levine and Beth Sedacca Bond; his pride and joy, grandson, Matthew Chet Sedacca Levine; blessed and caring son-in-laws, Barry Levine and Stephen Bond; and loving sisters, Sarah Thornton and Susan Haimes. A special thanks to caregiver Jonathan Fleece and friends Jim Adams and Seymour Gordon. Morris was a loving husband, father, grandfather and friend. He was loved by all and will be missed by many.

Robert Siegel, Charles' Partner, as well as the office staff of Gwathmey Siegel & Associates Architects mourn the loss of its founding Partner and spiritual leader, Charles Gwathmey. Charles passed away after battling esophageal cancer for an extended period of time. He focused on the design of projects until his very last day. He loved being an architect, a commitment made as a teenager after touring through Europe with his parents, Robert Gwathmey, the well known artist and educator, and Rosalie, a photographer and textile designer. In addition to having a passion for creating architecture, he maintained an active involvement as an educator. He was a wonderful motivator who inspired all he came in contact with. Charles was also a very kind and caring person. He was fair minded and detested prejudice of any type. Charles and I collaborated for 41 years, often sharing a desk sitting face to face drawing and discussing ideas. We completed 400 projects ranging in scale from a birdhouse to a University, but more than any other building type, it was the exploration of the single family residence, initially summarized in the Amagansett, New York home for his parents completed in 1966, that set the foundation for and substantially shaped many of the architectural principles around which the work of our firm revolves. Charles Gwathmey's contribution to architecture is immeasurable. The opportunity to work with him has been a great experience for all who have passed through our office. As his partner and lifelong friend, I have experienced a wonderful and unique relationship. We looked forward to and enjoyed being with each other everyday, despite the complexities of life and the pressures inherent in the practice of architecture. I feel a great loss which at this point cannot be put into words. My wife, Hazel, and I send our deepest condolences to his wife, Bette-Ann, his son, Eric, and his daughter, Annie.

2009-08-09T00:00:00Z,"EVEN among frugal travelers, hitchhiking remains a controversial topic. To some, sticking your thumb out is an invitation to robbery, assault or worse. For others (including myself), it offers the possibility not just of a free ride but of connecting with locals and foreign cultures. Risky, sure, but worth the gamble. For 32-year-old Ben Bachelder, that risk is a way of life. Since graduating from the University of California, Berkeley, in 2000, he has thumbed it in 35 countries and six continents including Antarctica, where he kept the heaters running at the large McMurdo Station (no small challenge). Along the way, he began contributing to Digihitch.com, an online forum for hitchhikers, and became one of the site's featured writers and its ''most well-rounded hitchhiker,'' according to Digihitch's founder, Morgan Strub."

Born in Chicago on July 24, 1911, educated at The Latin School in Chicago and graduated from Wellesley College in 1933. Married John T. Windle, head of reference at The Newberry Library, in 1937. Moved to Madison, Indiana to open an antiques business in 1948. Assisted by a personal donation from Eli Lilly, in 1960 she and her husband founded Historic Madison, Inc. (HMI), a preservation organization dedicated to preserving and protecting Madison's unique architectural heritage. Through their efforts 133 square city blocks were placed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1974, and their own house (the Shrewsbury-Windle House) was named a National Historic Landmark in 1994, followed by designation of the entire downtown as a National Historic Landmark District. Ann's tireless devotion to historic preservation at local and national levels will be remembered by all who met her. Her quick wit and amazing conversational ability, her knowledge of antiques, and her generosity in pouring drinks all left an indelible impression on countless visitors to Madison. She was proud of being a member of the first civil rights panel in Madison, and of being named a member of the Indiana Commission to the U.S. Commission on Civil Rights. She was named a Sagamore of the Wabash, the highest distinction in Indiana given by the state governor. A memorial service will be held at 3pm on August 19 in the John T. Windle Auditorium in Madison. Donations may be made to Historic Madison, Inc., 500 West Street, Madison, IN, 47250."

Bernie began his undergraduate education at the University of Oklahoma and earned his bachelor's degree from the Wharton School of the University of Pennsylvania. Bernie started his career at Grey Advertising, relocating to Montreal for a number of years to oversee its Canadian accounts. He then returned to New York where he became a marketing and research consultant with notable clients both here and internationally including Sony, Ocean Spray and Perrier to name a few. Over the course of his career, he logged more than three million miles on American Airlines traveling to places around the world. Bernie was also a charter member of the board of NYC Industries for the Blind and served on the board of directors of his Sutton Place coop. He was affectionately nicknamed ""the mayor of E. 57th Street"" because his vibrant personality and zest for life made him a popular figure in the neighborhood; when he walked his dog or went to the corner market, he could not take more than a few steps without being hailed by name along the way. An avid jogger prior to his stroke, Bernie was a regular on the Central Park reservoir route and loved to read the NY Times sports section and op-ed page - in that order. But his first priority was always his family who will remember him as a ""gentleman and a gentle man."" He is survived by his beloved wife of thirty-six years, Enid, his daughters Dr. Gwen Engelhard and her partner Cindy Cooper, Sharon and her husband Glenn Firester, two sons Marc Freedman Esq. and his wife Randy and Andrew Freedman, his three grandchildren Lyle, Daniel and Jesse and his brother Sheldon Engelhard.

2009-08-09T00:00:00Z,"JOLSON--Leon, a survivor of the Warsaw Ghetto, a philanthropist, and an American businessman, died August 7th at his home in New York City. He was 96 years old, and death was from natural causes. Born Leon Yosselson in Warsaw in 1913, and a graduate of the University of Warsaw, he emigrated to the United States in 1947, with his wife Anya Kotkowski, after five years spent in work camps, in hiding, and in DP camps. Although he arrived here with only six dollars in his pocket, he quickly established himself. The child of sewing machine importers, he knew the trade. In 1948, as founder and president of the Necchi Sewing Machine Sales Corporation in the United States, he was the first to bring a foreign sewing machine to America, the Italian Necchi, which could, without attachments, do a zig zag stitch, a blind stitch, embroider, and make buttonholes, all operations that here had to be done by hand. Subsequently, he also distributed Switzerland's portable Elna. The machines became so popular and the company so successful that within just a few years, Jolson became a symbol of survivor enterprise. He was honored by many, including the Jewish Theological Seminary, was profiled in the New York Times, Time Magazine, and Reader's Digest, and was also written about in a number of books, including Dorothy Rabinowitz's New Lives: Survivors of the Holocaust Living in America. In 1953, he began importing sewing machines from Japan, under the business name of the Nelco Corporation, and for many years he was the sole importer for J.C. Penney, Co. Surviving him are his daughter, Barbara and her husband David Blumenthal, grandchildren, Adam and Elana Blumenthal, Gideon Blumenthal, Shira Blumenthal, and a great-grandson Jonah. A daughter, Dorothy, died in 1984; his wife, Anya, in 2002. Shiva will be observed in private. Once here, Jolson's inclination to philanthropy quickly surfaced. He created his first fellowship in 1952, the day he became a citizen, giving $10,000 to Columbia University Teachers College to assist other refugees without, he insisted, regard to race, religion, or nationality. Later he established a foundation, now the Nelco Foundation, to support education and health causes, and also created the Leon Jolson Award, administered by the Jewish Book Council, for a nonfiction work on the subject of the Holocaust. The sculpture of the Polish-Jewish hero, Janos Korchak at New York's Park Avenue Synagogue was donated by Jolson, who also funded a casting of the Polish-Jewish sculptor Nathan Jacob Rapoport's Warsaw Ghetto Uprising for Israel's Holocaust Memorial, Yad Vashem. Nor did he forget to mark history in Poland itself. Because of Leon Jolson, one of the buildings in which he and his family hid, is now a landmark that symbolically, and anonymously, memorializes the mother, son, and wife who concealed themselves there to save their lives. In addition, the stone on his mother's grave in a Catholic cemetery, where she lay buried under a false name because outside the Ghetto she couldn't die as member of her own faith, has been altered to give her real identity. It now says, ""Here lies Blima Yosselson, buried here as a Christian because she couldn't be buried as a Jew."" A man of brilliance and complexity, his good deeds will be long remembered."

But what perhaps thousands of people out on a crystalline summer day saw from both sides of the Hudson was a stunning, low-altitude accident in which the plane rolled up and into the helicopter, striking with a crack like thunder as the helicopter's blades and one of the plane's wings flew off, and then both aircraft fell and vanished into the river."
2009-08-09T00:00:00Z,"ZOOM All sorts of lies have been told throughout history, billions upon billions of them. (A conservative estimate.) But the real problem is not lies, it's people believing them. If people weren't so ridiculously credulous, lying would be a far more risky enterprise. Lies are effective because we are insecure about many of our beliefs and are quite vulnerable to the suggestion that those beliefs might be false. And they work because we might be predisposed to believe them already. Othello doesn't know that Desdemona is faithful. Indeed, he fears the opposite. Iago is able to lie to Othello precisely because Othello's passions are enflamed by jealousy and it is possible for him to imagine Iago's claims as the truth."

He retired in 1990. Emigrating to the U.S. in 1939, he fought in WWII in the U.S. Army Engineers Corps from Normandy to Berlin. He graduated from Pratt Institute in 1956. His varied design work includes the Ramses Hilton Hotel in Cairo, Egypt, renovation of the World Trade Center Hotel after the 1993 terrorist attack, additions to the Olivet College Library, Olivet, Michigan and the Stamford Marriott in Connecticut. Frithjof Lunde, FAIA, managing partner at WBTL from '63 to '89, referred to Bernard as having a very creative mind and said ""the significance of Bernie's work is best judged by two buildings, largely the creation of Bernie's imagination. These two: the original 1966 Barbados Hilton and the Boca Raton Hotel & Club, particularly its tower, are early examples of Post-Modern Design, largely unsung in the architectural press of the time."" He lived for over 30 years in Brooklyn, NY. His regional work includes the restoration of the Carnegie Library at 4th Ave. and Pacific, design of I.S. 324 for the Board of Education, library and public spaces at St. Francis College, and participation in the Hoyt-Schermerhorn Task Force, a site planning study for downtown Brooklyn at the request of former Borough President, Howard Golden.

Inspired by a neighbor, Mr. English said he began gardening to ''stay out of trouble'' and keep himself busy between jobs; it also helps keep fresh food on his family's table at low cost. His neatly planted rows have won several trophies for best vegetable garden in the New York City Housing Authority's annual contest. Mr. English lives with his three teenage daughters; his son lives with a grandmother on Staten Island. ''I never dreamed of living in the projects,'' Mr. English said. ''Now you can't even pay me to move out of here. You can't take a bulldozer to get me out of here.'' I wake up every morning about 5 o'clock. I go around the corner, get my coffee -- that seems to get me going. About 7 o'clock, I come back upstairs, make sure the kids are up. Once they go to school, I'm out and about. I do anything necessary to try to make a dollar, if it means that I have to go out there and pick up cans. I sort of have to keep myself occupied, so I just started, you know, raising a garden."

2009-08-09T00:00:00Z,"Before my daughter began day camp in Manhattan this summer, she had to sign an agreement stating that she would not start fights with other children, and that if they started fights with her, she would not handle it herself but tell a counselor. (This is similar to many school policies, though most don't ask for it in writing.) Presumably, the counselor would then do his or her job and make it clear that anyone who picks on another would face the consequences. How wonderful that sounded. My 11-year-old daughter's summer would not resemble some Lindsay Lohan movie in which the ''mean girls'' do things like knock your lunch tray over and then say, ''Oops! Careful, clumsy,'' as they walk away, high-fiving one another. And that boy whose middle name is trouble would not intimidate everyone into mocking her if she couldn't do a cartwheel during the gymnastics demonstration. After all, they signed the agreement, too -- they would not start fights with other children."

Stephan Kramer, the general secretary of Germany’s Central Council of Jews, said that the group favors the publication of a new “Mein Kampf” with scholarly commentaries that would educate future generations on the evils of Nazism. Hitler wrote the manifesto, whose title translates as “My Struggle” and which articulates his anti-Semitic views, while serving a four-year term for treason at Landsberg prison in Bavaria. The book, first published in two volumes in 1925 and 1926, has been banned in Germany since 1945, and the Bavarian government holds the copyright on it until 2015. A spokesman for the Bavarian government told The Independent, “We won’t lift the ban as it may play straight into the hands of the far right.

2009-08-10T00:00:00Z,"COLKER--Janice Seiner. On August 9, 2009. Janice Colker, a life-long professional artist who received numerous awards, died at her home in Pittsburgh. She was 80. The cause was cancer. Janice received a BFA from Carnegie-Mellon University in 1951 and began her art career while raising her four children. She exhibited work in the Annual Associated Artists Exhibits at the Carnegie Museum, winning a Jury Award in 1966 for a painting that was purchased by One Hundred Friends of Pittsburgh Art for exhibition in the Pittsburgh public schools. One of her works will appear posthumously in the upcoming 2009 Associated Artists Exhibit at Carnegie Museum. She also won jury awards at art exhibitions sponsored by other organizations. Her works were exhibited at the Three Rivers Art Festival, Hewlett Gallery at Carnegie Mellon University, the Museum of Art in Syracuse, New York, and at numerous galleries including frequent one-woman shows at the Studio Z Gallery and Mendelson Gallery. Her work also has been featured in ""Prize Winning Watercolors."" Janice served on the Executive Board of the Associated Artists of Pittsburgh, the Carnegie Mellon University Admissions Council for Specialist Fine Arts, the Executive Board of the Andrew Carnegie Society of Carnegie Mellon University, and was a member of the National Museum of Women in Arts, Washington, DC. Born Janice Seiner on July 7, 1929, her father Harry and mother Eva owned ""Seiner & Colker"", a clothing store on 5th Avenue. She married James Colker in 1950, no relation to her father's business partner, and the large wooden sign from the store is still displayed in the backyard of their Pittsburgh home celebrating their own enduring union. Janice played tennis, traveled, and painted until diagnosed with cancer last year. Janice is survived by James, her husband of 59 years, her four children David Colker (San Mateo, California), Hank Colker (Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania), Ruth Colker (Columbus, Ohio) and Sarah Colker (Hoboken, New Jersey), and seven grandchildren. Contributions in her memory may be made to Carnegie Mellon University, PO Box 371525, Pittsburgh, PA 15251-7525 or Congregation Dor Hadash, PO Box 8223, Pittsburgh, PA 15217."
