As the daily of prisoners in 189o ivas 97 greater than 1596, it is clear that very rigid economy was practiced in the latter year. he net. industry earnings in 189v exceeded those in 1594. In 1591 the total sum credited to earnings was $t)9,197; in 1595 the sum of $135,ISI was so credited. It is b3?this increase of net earnings that the of 1S93 is reduced. Tables are presented showing that. the earnings of the convicts in the three prisons for the six years-1SS9 to 1S95-amounted to $1,302,420. The prisons returned to the State Trea.s ury or expended by direction of the Legis lature all the money that it originally re ceived from the State. far industrial pur poses, and $94,635 in addition; that the prisons paid to convicts $52,775; that the prisons on Sept. 31, 15:75, had cash in banks amounting to $314,441, and had industrial assets on hand valued at $SIO,616.

1896-02-29T00:00:00Z,"To the left h0.ngs a sunset by l7, large both in size and conception, strong in painting, intense in its sentiment of the hour, a thorough harmony of the time and place. It represents a marshy stretch, with a bit of water in the foreground, and here and there along the horizon is a glint of red, as the sun out through the in clouds. It is quiet, , and thoroughly the work of a close student of nature. Nven more sympathetic than this is, perhaps, one of the best Rousseaus ever seen in this country. It is willed ""Edge of the Woods."" The theme is a simple one; there are trees, that al.. ways appeal very strongly to this painter; an Autumn sky , with cloud effect, cool, tender, and . The difficult problem of blue, always a stumbling to the painter, Rousseau has overcome, a? was his wont, with and apparently, no effort. The rich tones of reddish greens, of tender yellows, of distant haze-all these he has caught with the feeling of a poet, con amore. There are four more by Rousseau, ono of which, "" Land scape,"" (No. 8,) is also a worthy example, though somewhat less important. Here is a hillside, near hfs favorite Font0.tne bleau, covered with shrubbery, with rocks in the foreground. It is very simple, but the artist has invested the scene with his personal touch, which, a magician s wand, seems to transform ything it comes near. The clever Eugene Fromentin is repre sented by two of his Oriental op Arabs on horses, one called "" The Fal coner,"" and the other "" A Fantasia,"" dexter. ous, dainty in technique, monstrously habits in handling, gray in color, full of action, vim, and snap, and-not too Profound. He seems to get all the qualities for which he is Famous in his moderate-sized panels, and when !t comes to the larger canvases, it is only after all an of his smaller work. Thus in his "" Falconer "" thero is the facility of brush work on gar ment, f0.ce, sky, anti foreground, while in his larger "" Fantasia "" the same peated by the addition of several more fig. uses."

1896-02-29T00:00:00Z,"Ivlr. [Chanter]'s first expedition was in the shallow waters of Lake Jipe, on a raft made of palm stems. His object was to get a shot at the hippos. As he left his African followers on the shore, they showed their appreciation by shouting these cheering words: "" Loolt out Eor crocodiles! If mas ter dies, who ll pay us? "" There were many hippos-"" the surface oP the lake dotted here and there by spots, which soon re solved themselves into the black, boxlike heads of my game."" The huge beasts seemed quite indifferent at the approach of the strange craft. A group of five hippos n^as approached to 1'a0 yards; then, with a snort, they faced the raft. The rafts men seemed to have lost 3Ir. Chanter to stake a retreat, but he urged the crew until within 100 yards, when lie fired at the nearest animal; he missed, and then all oP the hippos disappeared. 1~'hen the sun rose, he counted fifty hippos, and talc(ng a good sight at ti. nearest one, he fired, and knew the bullet had reached its mark. He fancied that he would bag that hippo. but it sank out oP sight. Tr Cltan ler writes: ""I had not 3 et learned that the brain of these animals is very small, and that the only fatal shot is under the ear."" Then the hippos seemed to have crowded him, for they were decidedly too near for comfort. Next, "" slowly but steadily.,"" 1\ir. Chanter felt that the frail raft was being lifted up. The boatmen yelled with terror. Evidently the hippo found he had made a mistake, and he left the bottom oP the raft. Ilr. Chanter had shot at three hippos and no dead animal was visible. Anything more disagreeable and danger ous than a hunt for buffalo in its own cov ert can hardly be imagined. The brush is not more than ten feet high, and through this the animals have made runways in numerable-but the branches meet at a man s shoulders. These paths cross and Cem oss in a labyrinthian way. Get caught In one o: these paths of a charging buf falo, and there can be no escape. Into just such an ugly brush as this llr. Chanter en tered, and there was a charge of buffaloes, but they passed on, separating just at the place where stood . Chanter. Then the follower said: "" Ham del Allah ""=' Praise be to God""-and our sportsman says lie "" began to underst;tnd m hy buffalo shooting in the brush has been always considered unsafe."" Mr. [Theodore Roosevelt]'s latest hunting experiences, in 1S93 and 189f, are neatly told. Antelope, where they once abounded, not far from his ranch, are by no means as abm:dant as they were. The only increase in the region of the Little \Iissourt has been in the wolves. Blaclctail at e not, how ever, diminishing. TVhere twenty were killed a dozen years ago for every one whitetail, now their numbers are about the same. The prong horn is getting scarcer, and so is the buffalo.elk. As to his battery, Mr.=Roosevelt has always been singular in his adhesion to the `Virichester, and he uses a .45-90. As to penetration, perhaps more stress is laid on that than it actually de serves. "" Shock is useless if it is gained at too ,great expense of penetration or ac curacy."" You may get flatness of tory, but IP you are not accurate there is little use in it. ~'e are rather conservative, and having been brought up in the school of the ancient small bore, with a long and solid bullet, and a fair charge of powder, :ye rather hang to that than to big bores, extra heavy powder, and hollow bullets. The l7 believes more in a double-barreled rifle. T'e put our faith in a repeating arm. "" Each type has some good qualities' that the other lacks, and each has some defects."" Then 1\Ir. Theo dore Roosevelt takes pleasure in noting what is Ilr. Selous's favorite arm. It is a rifle close to the type of that used by, us twenty-five years ago, of .45-calibre, with is grains of powder and a .bullet of 3u0 grains. blr, Roosevelt believes that we will even adopt a smaller calibre-one of .25G to .310-with 40 grains of powder, and a 200-grain bullet, But then the powder used to-day is a stronger substance than it was in former days. After all, there always is the personal equation which does the work, and so "" the man behind the gun counts most."""

1896-03-01T00:00:00Z,"Steamers and sailing vessels are running ashore in this neighborhood with a frequency that is almost ludicrous. A lot of Captains seem to have tired of the all-water routes. At any rate, they are making big dents in our coast line, as if they thought coast lines didn't cost anything. It's about time these attempts to rival the overland transportation companies came to an end."

Now, if Louis Rhead had been born an Egyptian several thousands of years ago, he doubtless would have agreed with Piutarch, and, if he had felt impelled to engrave posters upon monoliths, I am sure that he would have endowed Athyr, or Athor, whichever you please, with the attributes of Isis, and vice versa."

The growth of sects and heresies under our tolerant rule in India is more frequent than is generally known, for Hinduism is elastic enough quickly to absorb them, and they are still more short-lived when their leaders have been Christians.

He might be unable to buy a copy of his own, but when he had access to one it was more intelligible.

1896-06-21T00:00:00Z,"A wholesome fear of the devil in any form is doubtless a characteristic of many youngsters born amid better surroundings than the poor children of the densely crowded east side who have lately been panic-stricken in several schoolhouses.

1896-06-21T00:00:00Z,"CANTON, Ohio, June 20 -- A trainload of people from Niles, Major McKinley's birthplace, reached here this afternoon.

1896-06-21T00:00:00Z,"While the continent of Europe has renounced, if it ever adopted, the superstition of the divining rod, the Anglo-Saxon of these islands and of North America has confidence in a set of ignorant men who pretend to be able by the use of a forked stick to discover hidden sources of water, of metallic ores and of other treasures."
1896-06-21T00:00:00Z,"The Marquis de Luppe, a former Chambordist and a son-in-law of the Due de Eroglie, refuses to follow the Due d'OrIeans, now that the Duke's strategy is the same as Gen.

1896-06-21T00:00:00Z,"From The Saturday Review. The Turk has made such a criminal fool of himself in Armenia that all Christendom is prepared to take sides against him and to sympathize warmly with anybody who sheds his blood. The apparent fact that in Crete thus far ten Turks have been slain for every Christian ""massacred"" makes no difference with outside sentiment."

1896-06-21T00:00:00Z,"Nobody can look at the presentation in words and pictures on another page of the manner in which the public sidewalks are taken for private use without agreeing that such a state of things is disgraceful to the city. Yet it clearly appears that the municipality not only permits, but in some instances actually connives at, this invasion of its rights."

1896-06-21T00:00:00Z,"Arthur Young is shocked, and with sufficient reason, at the game-preserving wastes which surround the French chateaux, but he is also disgusted, in a minor degree, by the want of proper landscape gardening. Their great houses are often built in the purlieus of a town, and what might be made into beautiful grounds abandoned to the baser uses of stables or other utilitarian erections."
1896-06-21T00:00:00Z,"Arthur Young was one of the men who, if in the depths of depression at one meeting, are sure to be at the height of exhilaration at the next. Nothing could permanently suppress or daunt him. Compensations were sure to turn up. If his wife was occasionally a thorn in his flesh, he was at least a most affectionate father."

1896-06-21T00:00:00Z,"The prosecution seems to have made out its case against Police Commissioner PARKER for neglect of duty. It is to be regretted, however, in view of the effect of the trial upon public opinion, that the real case against the Commissioner could not be made more manifest.

1896-06-21T00:00:00Z,"From The London World. Russia cannot be judged by the analogies of Western Europe. She is still in the middle ages. The first mishap or mistake of the young Emperor would recall the calamity of his coronation week, in which a reign of mismanagement and misfortune might seem to have been foreshadowed; and the blind ignorance of the Russian masses would lend itself a ready dupe to the suggestions of secret conspirators."

The men who yesterday had to drop from the ranks because of the heat all took part in this morning's drills, but some of them were again forced to retire."
1896-07-12T00:00:00Z,"Concerning those who write for money, or, in other words, for support, there is little to be said. There are two very old sayings, vexatio dat intellectum, hardship improves the understanding; and ingenii largitor venter, hunger sharpens the wits -- sayings which certainly receive some confirmation in the case of men like Oliver Goldsmith; and many instances could be quoted in which poverty seems to have exerted a favorable influence on poetry."

1896-07-12T00:00:00Z,"CHICAGO, July 11. -- The promised revival in business to-day did not materialize, but, as this was Saturday, that was probably an excuse for the inactivity.

1896-07-12T00:00:00Z,"LONDON, July 11. -- Thus far, English journals, and English public men also, consider the Chicago Convention much more as a sociological curiosity than as a serious political event. There is nothing in their comment which would alter or illumine the opinions which our own thoughtful men have formed about it."

1896-07-12T00:00:00Z,"That ""independent thinking is dying out,"" as Lord Rosebery opines, is a somewhat doubtful proposition, because independent thinking has been the exception rather than the rule from all time.

Vanderbilt had established his vast estate of 10,000 acres, Biltmore, at Asheville, in North Carolina, for the purpose of self-aggrandizement only, or, at best, in the pride of ownership which marks the landed proprietor, he has vindicated himself from the accusation by connecting with his property one of the most important institutions of the country."

1896-07-12T00:00:00Z,"Electricity, light, heat, and chemical action are all in essence motion; electricity is the most desirable of them all, because it can most readily and fully become the source, or issue, of any other. The preeminent sensitiveness of electrical apparatus makes it a surpassing means of measuring minute portions of space or time, of light, heat, chemical activity, or mechanical motion."
