But that changed earlier this year when Arizona made its Legislature the sole arbiter of knife regulations. And because of loose restrictions on weapons here, Arizona is now considered a knife carrier's dream, a place where everything from a samurai sword to a switchblade can be carried without a quibble."

The actual day isn't so significant; after all, my parents were separated for more than a year before their divorce was final, and their marriage had been a mess for years before that. Still, staying married longer than my parents felt like a measure of success worthy of consideration. My husband and I had already passed the point where his parents had divorced, and our sons are older than my husband and his brother were when their father moved out."

The London restaurant, which opens next month in the Mandarin Oriental overlooking Hyde Park, will champion British food from Tudor times up through that 20th-century invention, the ploughman's lunch. ''I was fascinated because I thought I knew quite a lot about cooking, and here I was, finding things I never knew existed,'' he said of his extensive historical research. ''There's a sense of pride of introducing this stuff to people today.'' While Blumenthal won't be sending out four-and-twenty blackbirds baked in a pie -- a dish he replicated in his recent book, ''Heston's Fantastical Feasts,'' using a cement mixer to make the pastry -- or sewing the back half of one animal to the front half of another, he will be offering, say, spit-roasted rib of beef with triple-cooked chips and mushroom ketchup from the 1800s.

As if shopping with teenagers isn't bad enough, now we can barely see what they want us to pay absurd amounts of money for. There are several trendy chain stores that are so dark that you're not sure they're open until you step inside.

Throughout his life, Mr. Goldman remained dedicated to supporting the San Francisco Bay Area, environmental causes, the Jewish community, Israel and reproductive rights. The son of prominent San Francisco lawyer Richard Samuel Goldman and Alice Wertheim Goldman of Great Falls, Montana, Richard N. Goldman was born and raised in San Francisco. He graduated from University of California at Berkeley and spent a year at Boalt Hall School of Law before serving in the United States Army from 1942 to 1946. In 1949, he founded and was chairman of Goldman Insurance Services. In 1951, Mr. Goldman and his late wife, Rhoda Haas Goldman, a great-grandniece of Levi Strauss, established the Richard and Rhoda Goldman Fund in San Francisco. Since its inception, the Fund has distributed more than $680 million dollars to nonprofit organizations and causes around the world. Through their foundation, their areas of support included efforts as early as the 1960s to support conservation and environmental causes. In 1989, the couple established the Goldman Environmental Prize, which annually awards $150,000 to six grassroots environmental heroes, one from each of the world's inhabited regions. Today, the Goldman Prize is frequently referred to as the ""Green Nobel."" Mr. Goldman served on the boards of many Bay Area organizations and received numerous civic honors and awards. He was also one of the largest donors to the University of California at Berkeley, his alma mater, wherein he was named the 2010 Alumnus of the Year. Mr. Goldman and his wife, who died in 1996, raised four children in San Francisco. He is survived by three of his children, John D. Goldman and his wife, Marcia, of Atherton, CA; Douglas E. Goldman and his wife, Lisa, of San Francisco, CA; and Susan R. Gelman and her husband, Michael, of Chevy Chase, MD. He is also survived by his daughter-in-law Susan Goldman, widow of his son Richard W. Goldman, who predeceased his parents. In addition, Mr. Goldman is survived by his 11 grandchildren, three great-grandchildren, and his sister Marianne Goldman of San Francisco, CA. A Memorial Service was held on Friday, December 3, 2010 at Congregation Emanu-El in San Francisco. The family encourages memorial donations be made to Golden Gate National Parks Conservancy; Jewish Community Federation of San Francisco; University of California at Berkeley Department of Intercollegiate Athletics; or a charitable organization of the donor's choosing."

As the third-century Christian theologian Tertullian wrote of the Resurrection, ''It is certain because it is impossible'' -- a notion that might well apply to the virgin birth; such a conundrum that it elevates Mary to a safe place, beyond logic. In ''Alone of All Her Sex: The Myth and the Cult of the Virgin Mary'' (Vintage Books), Marina Warner predicted Mary's eventual, seemingly inevitable demise. Written at the height of feminist optimism and published in 1976, Warner's scholarly survey of the shape-shifting that Mary has undergone over the past two millennia methodically dismantled the legend, which had served as an instrument of oppression, stunting women's growth and curtailing their lives."

2010-12-05T00:00:00Z,"JUST after 4 o'clock on a Wednesday afternoon, as a dozen people clicked away on their laptops at the Atlas Café in Williamsburg, Brooklyn, half of a tree broke off without warning less than a block away. It crashed into the middle of Havemeyer Street, crushing a parked car, setting off alarms and blocking the street. A deafening chorus of horns rose outside Atlas's window as traffic halted. An 18-wheeler executed a sketchy 10-point turn in the middle of a crowded intersection before a pair of fire trucks made their way through the traffic jam in a blaze of red. Chain saws roared, sawdust flew and the horns built to a peak. It was New York urban pandemonium at its finest. Inside the warm confines of Atlas, separated from the chaos by only a thin wall of glass, not a soul stirred. A quiet mention was made of the falling tree, a few heads rose for a second, and then, just as quickly, they ducked back down. They all returned to whatever was on the other side of their glowing, partly eaten apples. On a day when the cafe Internet connection had already been down for four hours, and the toilet had been blocked for even longer, I thought I had seen these worker bees pushed to their limit. But I had underestimated them. Nothing could stir these people. They were not in New York; they were citizens of Laptopistan."

I remember watching the guys, in their streamlined tailoring, walk a weird cat's cradle of a wooden runway. They were close enough for the audience to spot chests covered with what resembled pastors' bibs, tied over bared shirt backs. Other looks, as if of a priest defrocking himself, were neckties used as nooses and visible underpants rising from trousers. But it was the abstract collars -- and the sly sexuality that the enigmatic Miuccia Prada drew from them -- that stayed in my mind."

2010-12-05T00:00:00Z,"With the Chinese buying cars by the tens of thousands every week -- big cars, too -- and throwing up new buildings, driving in Beijing is no lark. It was an hour before Guo Pei and her husband, Bao Jie Cao, reached the headquarters of Rose Studio, their fashion company, on the city's north side. The October sun was blazing pale when their Mercedes pulled up to a low-rise office complex, its white brick rendered shabby by newer developments. Bao, a stocky, good-looking Taiwanese man who goes by the name Jack, had been kneeling the whole time next to the driver; facing his wife, who sat in the back; and translating from Chinese into English. Now he sort of backed out of the car. Guo Pei, whose career as a fashion designer began when there was no fashion in her country, remained a study in Asian poise and etiquette. In addition to large eyes and delicate features, enhanced by careful makeup, she has a gentleness unmarred by circumstance. These circumstances include wealth and a list of clients in Beijing's highest political, media and social circles. But as Jack said proudly, ''Guo Pei is a very traditional lady -- a wonderful wife and daughter and mother who always cares more about her family than the attention she receives.'' Be that as it may, nobody, upon learning that Beijing has its own couturière, would ever imagine such a salon. Rose Studio's décor goes well beyond Chinese standards -- in fact, its excessiveness suggests that in her ideas Guo Pei is anything but modest. Along one wall are display cases of dresses in gold and Easter shades of blue and yellow, behind which are lighted panels of doily-white filigree rising to the mirrored ceiling. A glittering staircase, as wide as those in a musical, is ornamented with bronze vines. Coiled around its base, like a fat, drowsy serpent, is a tufted green damask banquette. Several assistants, half-hidden by vases of red silk flowers, work at a large white table. In the center of the room is a molded silver chair in the shape of three plump breasts."
2010-12-05T00:00:00Z,"WHEN Nina Garduno opened Free City Supershop in 2005, in a strip mall in Malibu, Calif., the place was hard to describe. It wasn't a boutique, exactly, though she sold clothes and jewelry. It wasn't a ''concept store,'' though it offered a genuine sense of discovery rare in the world of retail. And you hesitated to lump it with the deadly term ''lifestyle,'' though she sold refurbished bicycles, custom turntables and tepees. The beauty of Free City was that it couldn't be defined, but had a clear and distinct aesthetic supplied by Ms. Garduno, who at the time was the chief men's buyer for Ron Herman/Fred Segal in Los Angeles -- her main gig. For those of us who see a great deal, and don't want to be sold cheap or have our expectations met by another luxury experience (that isn't really such a luxury), Ms. Garduno's little free-thinking store inspired us."

Susie Davis, New York A.Tourism to the Galapagos Islands, home to a delicate and unique ecosystem, is a much-debated subject. But if done thoughtfully, travel to the islands can be a once-in-a-lifetime experience. Wendy Blake, who wrote the recent ''Going to the Galapagos, and Trying to Limit the Footprint'' (Oct. 24, 2010), pointed out in an e-mail that thanks to its relative inaccessibility, travel to the Galapagos for anything shorter than seven days would feel rushed, so combining it with another destination may not be feasible. And since December-January is the high season for travel to the Galapagos, reservations with a tour company should be made well in advance."

Then, after seeing a video of his wife handing out bread to the hungry in Addis Ababa, Philip made a trip there himself and decided to ''turn my back on my commercial career.'' With $60 million from the recent sale of Cybercorp to Charles Schwab (for $488 million), he joined the foundation full time, and the couple (he's Irish, she's English) became pioneers of philanthro-capitalism. The Berbers' endowment covers all of Glimmer's operating costs, which has allowed the foundation to spend $40 million and counting to help alleviate poverty in Ethiopia. ''One hundred percent of the money, not 50 or 80 percent, needed to get to the people,'' says Philip, comparing Glimmer's business model with that of other charities. ''We had to start with a clean piece of paper.'' Their first project was a school in the town of Dembi Dolo, and since then, they've built 3,500 water and sanitation facilities, 190 health clinics and 53 vet clinics; completed 400 education projects; and, through the Clinton Global Initiative, given $2.4 million in microloans. We don't leave a village until all those structures are up and running,'' says Donna, adding that there's more to measuring success than money. '' There is the human part of it as well: engaged philanthropy. What does it mean to give in a way that doesn't make the giver feel hollow? We had to overcome the skepticism that constantly shrouds the giving world and show that there is another way, that there is emotional philanthropy alongside structured philanthropy.'' Says Philip, ''For us, it was important to be engaged, and it was important for our children to be engaged.''"

2010-12-05T00:00:00Z,"I don't like losing things. I keep a list of books I know I once had, and know I've read, that I have somehow misplaced; ''The Magic Mountain,'' Loren Eiseley's ''The Star Thrower,'' ''The Complete Claudine'' by Colette are on it, along with at least 40 other titles. Even when I lose a pair of pants, a sense of vexation, a confusion arises in me that seems out of all proportion to the loss, and if the pants are suddenly presented to me apologetically at the dry cleaners I feel a strange giddiness, a tincture of the kind of joy displayed by reunited families in movies about Mormon heaven. It is strange that in this world in which everything is sooner or later lost, where losing is the only certainty, one gets attached to even the smallest things and wants to be able to say goodbye even to a pair of pants, rather than have it simply disappear. One wants to see a logic in disappearances, and to know when one is losing things. Even if, in the end, we get to keep nothing. Mary disappeared from my daily life when we were 8 years old, when my parents placed her in an institution for the mentally disabled. It took me painfully long even to recognize that the event had left a kind of ocean of disquiet in me that manifested itself in panic attacks and a lifelong struggle with agoraphobia, and in my difficulties negotiating some aspects of public life, as well as in my reactions to trivial losses. I suppose that as her twin, it was doubly hard for me to know how and where to draw the boundary line between her nature and mine, between the inherent strangeness of being a person and the kind of strangeness that led to what I saw as banishment from normal human society. Yet I wasn't aware of any of this when I was growing up. It wasn't until I reached late middle age that I could even begin to acknowledge that being Mary's twin was a central fact, perhaps the central fact, of my life. All I did feel was a kind of blank place inside, where memories and feelings should have been."

2010-12-05T00:00:00Z,"Naomi Campbell's been accused of many things, but crimes against hair? The beehive she sported on the stand at the United Nations war-crimes trial of Charles Taylor at The Hague last summer garnered a lot of buzz, but the buzz was tinged with ridicule -- a clear indication that while the style possessed a lot of pins, it didn't have real legs. The staid, sculptured bumps of hair looked painfully anachronistic, and just like that, a trend that seemed fresh on Prada's fall runway came tumbling down. ''For all the talk of the beehive this fall, no one's really wearing it,'' says Orlando Pita, who created the edgy style on the previous page. ''The big editorial up-do doesn't translate into real life.'' Accordingly, at the spring shows, hair started to come undone. There were long, partial plaits at Givenchy, sex-kitten tousles at Isabel Marant and half-up-half-down dos at Miu Miu and Christopher Kane, while the rocker chicks at Balmain looked like they had just rolled out of bed. For Pita, the new down-do is all about texture. ''We've seen perfectly blown out, silicone-sleek hair for so long,'' he says. ''The new texture doesn't look so worked on. It's all in the brushing and the products you use.'' Pita sprays Elevate, a texturizer from his own line, into wet hair and dries it using his fingers to encourage the natural wave. (Everyone has one.) Next, he sprays dry shampoo (his version is called Refresh) onto the roots (avoiding the top of the head) in one-inch sections. Finally, he gently brushes it out with a Mason Pearson brush, fluffing the hair so ''it feels soft, not tacky with product. I call it the anti-blow dry.''"

2010-12-05T00:00:00Z,"WASHINGTON -- Common wisdom here holds that the report issued by the president's fiscal commission last week is probably going nowhere, despite the endorsement of 11 of the 18 commission members. Sure, voters like to complain about the debt, the insiders say, but once you start talking about higher taxes and cuts in benefits, you find that no one wants to be the one to sacrifice. There may be truth to this premise, but only some. After all, generations of Americans have sacrificed plenty for the nation's cause, and there's no reason to think we've lost the capacity. What makes this case for sacrifice so much harder to embrace, perhaps, is that it goes to our national psyche, threatening our self-image as a land with limitless potential. While past generations have readily sacrificed for national greatness, debt reduction -- at least in the gloomy way its advocates argue for it -- feels like a call to sacrifice in the name of our national decline."

The fact that a 25-year-old broke the Ravens' career touchdown mark in his third season tells more about Ravens history than about Flacco. Testaverde left Baltimore in 1998, which means that the Ravens have been cycling through Trent Dilfer, Tony Banks, Elvis Grbac, Kyle Boller, the late-career Steve McNair and others for 13 seasons. Thanks to Ray Lewis and some great running backs, the Ravens have been good for much of that span, but 13 years is a long time to squeak out wins with rushing, defense and crossed fingers. Flacco is a cut above the quarterbacks who preceded him, but the Ravens' offense still has problems.

Two of the victims worked for Reuters, as a photographer and driver, and the tragic nature of their deaths was made all the more horrific by the robotic, almost desultory voices of the airmen narrating their actions. The impact was immense. Julian Assange, WikiLeaks' mercurial and complicated founder, had the attention of the world."

2010-12-05T00:00:00Z,"KAUFMAN--Elaine, owner of the storied New York City restaurant, Elaine's, died today, December 3, 2010, at Lenox Hill Hospital on Manhattan's Upper East Side. She was 81 years old. For the past five years, Elaine rallied against chronic obstructive pulmonary disorder and pulmonary hypertension, complications of which eventually claimed her life. The quintessential larger-than-life New Yorker, she was Runyonesque from the start. Born on February 10, 1929, she spent her childhood in Times Square, hung out backstage at theatres on-and off-Broadway and devoured New York's daily newspapers. In 1963, she opened Elaine's on Second Avenue and 88th Street. It was legendary from the start, and, as legend would have it, it was a writers' place from the beginning. She took care of a group of struggling writers and reporters who would come to define their generation and become its voice. Mailer, Styron, Vonnegut, Shaw, Plimpton, Talese, Ephron, Morris, Halberstam, Hamill. She served them dinner, hosted all night poker games and listened to their troubles, all without charging them a dime. When they hit big, they would pay her back. And, they did. Elaine was a force of nature. She loved life, creativity and, by her own admission, ""people who do things."" For 47 years, Elaine's was a power zone where movers and shakers of every stripe from the city, the country and the world gathered. It was immortalized in Billy Joel's song, ""Big Shot."" While it remained a staple for writers, editors and reporters, it also became home to American and international film stars, screenwriters and directors; presidents, priests and politicians; painters and poets; athletes and CEOs; rock stars and composers; cops, and sometimes even robbers. On September 11, 2001, her restaurant became ground zero for police and reporters investigating the World Trade Center plane crashes. Until she was hospitalized several weeks ago, she continued her schedule of working seven days a week, greeting her patrons, getting the scoop, cheering for her beloved New York Yankees in the playoffs and leaving when the doors closed in the wee hours of the morning. Elaine Kaufman was named a New York ""Living Landmark"" by the New York Landmarks Conservancy in 2004. She is the recipient of the Ellis Island Medal of Honor. Her life and times were chronicled by A.E. Hotchner in ""Everybody Comes to Elaine's"" (HarperCollins, 2004). She appeared as herself in a number of films and Elaine's was featured prominently in the opening scene of Woody Allen's classic film, ""Manhattan."" Most recently, she made a cameo appearance in ""Morning Glory,"" starring Diane Keaton, Harrison Ford and Rachel McAdams. She was loved by her family, her staff and her numerous patrons, young and old alike. She will be greatly missed. And New York City will never be quite the same. Visitation will be held Frank E. Campbell, 1076 Madison Avenue, on Thursday, December 9, from 6:00-9:00pm and Friday, December 10, from 5:00-8:00pm. In lieu of flowers, donations to Literacy Partners and Food Bank of New York.

2010-12-05T00:00:00Z,"MY GREAT-GRANDMOTHER ANNA Arbeit was born in Brownsville, Brooklyn, in 1905. It was a rich area, she said. Pennsylvania Avenue was a doctors' row, and the doctor made house calls in a horse and buggy. Anna's parents came from Austria as teenagers, and their neighborhood was filled with Jews from all over Europe who spoke to each other in Yiddish. She was a good student, and at Franklin K. Lane High School, she received a medal on the steps of City Hall for winning a typing award. After graduation, she went to work as a typist. In 1923, Anna (at right holding my mother as a baby, in 1953, on a porch in East Flatbush) married Marcus Altman, who had come to the United States from Russia to avoid being conscripted into the army. He never stopped missing what he called the ''mother country.''"

2010-12-05T00:00:00Z,"Last night I dreamed I was a Kardashian. Maybe it was my close-to- midnight reading of ''Kardashian Konfidential,'' the sisters' gemütlich memoir about their rise from celebutante glitz and glam (they grew up in a Beverly Hills house with a pool ''shaped like a duck,'' not to mention neighbors like Jay Leno) to stratospheric glitz and glam. Or maybe it was my recent blip of a visit out to L.A. to meet with Ma and Pa. But any which way I was staying over at their house and didn't want to go home. In fact, I was so eager to keep talking poolside with the girls while Kris brought out scrumptious guacamole that I kept missing my flight. The girls were wearing their usual cartload of makeup, heavy on the eyes, and yet it looked natural next to their minimal, slightly cheesy outfits and long, dark tresses. There was cleavage everywhere, and Kim and Khloé waved their designer heels in the air while talking about the importance of a strong work ethic and bikini waxes. Kourtney had baby Mason on her lap and Bruce was puttering about. The thought occurred to me that if I hung around long enough, I too would discover the secret of the universe -- of their universe, where the money tumbled in and interracial romance was applauded and no one ever gave a thought to much beyond the logistics of the next highly remunerated appearance (private plane, hair and makeup) . . . and then I woke up, in my bed, far from the sun and the fun. About that blip of a visit: It is coming up on 9 a.m. on a Tuesday morning in mid-October, and inside the gated community of Hidden Hills, about an hour's drive in traffic from Beverly Hills, the front door to Kris and Bruce Jenner's house is unlocked. I wander past workmen inside the sprawling entryway, which leads to rooms on either side as well as a regally curving staircase, and let out a tentative hello. Everything in the house looks very luxe and new, including a gleaming white kitchen with a white chandelier -- and, as it turns out, has been recently renovated, from doorknobs to tiles, during a break from filming the E! network phenomenon ''Keeping Up With the Kardashians.'' About a minute later, Kris, looking like a less imposing version of her TV self and a lot like Eydie Gorme, emerges and calls to her husband to come and join us."

2010-12-05T00:00:00Z,"As the ocean liner steamed in from the open sea and approached the Verrazano-Narrows Bridge, the boy worried that the ship's superstructure would not clear. ''It was a cold, sunny winter day, Wednesday, the 22nd of December, 1965,'' he said. ''There are certain dates etched in your memory.'' His journey to America had begun in Egypt, where his father was a leading religious figure. ''The image of the Statue of Liberty came into view slowly . . . such majesty and beauty. It was a life-changing moment in my life. I was 17 years old.'' That Feisal Abdul Rauf's American story began off the southern tip of Manhattan can seem foreordained, in light of the controversy that consumed him 45 years later. At his first glimpse of his new world, he told me, ''I had an intuition that my work would involve introducing Islam to America.'' Yet at that point, young Rauf was himself in the throes of typical adolescent questioning. ''In such a free society -- it was the '60s! -- religion had become a matter of choice.'' Not so in Kuwait, where he was born, and where religion was inherited. In America, ''religion was passé. I was bewildered by all that. I was asking, 'Does God exist? What is the meaning of life?' And I found the answers to my religious questions as a matter of choice. I could choose to embrace my Muslim faith -- and I did.'' That simply, Feisal Abdul Rauf glimpsed the meaning of the nation's defining freedom. ''America made it possible for me to freely and deliberately choose to be religious and Muslim.'' Rauf would become an American citizen in 1979."
2010-12-05T00:00:00Z,"ON THE SCREEN Blogs about trash have a wide-ranging, if filthy, pedigree. At one end are the fun and highly focused sites like Street Mattress (founded in 2001 and still posting pictures of discarded Posturepedics.) At the other are more academically minded ruminations on refuse, like Discard Studies, started in August. Last Night's Garbage occupies a space between these two poles. Photographs of trash dominate the blog and provide its author, Jed Tamarkin, with inspiration for writing short bits of fiction. The blog, which gets about 25,000 page views a month, has evolved since Mr. Tamarkin began shooting pictures outside his East Village apartment in the summer of 2007. Each photo was accompanied by text describing a fictional character with some relationship to whatever toy or commode or stroller happened to be lying on the street as Mr. Tamarkin passed by with his Canon point-and-shoot. (''There's a lot of baby strollers for some reason,'' he said.) Tags along the right side of the blog chronicle some of the recurring characters. There is Ross, a hard-drinking artist with relationship troubles; Stef, a chatty and celebrity-obsessed young woman; and Bobby, a drug-addled musician. There are also people who appeared only once, tossed off like so many old items of clothing."

I've had to bribe my cabby to get him to take me to a spooky gate on a lonely country road. ''You can't miss it,'' Bickerton, a reclusive artist, had assured me. I don't. Set into twin niches chiseled into the stelae that serve as gateposts are two severed heads. Gene Simmons-caliber tongues writhe from mouths agape in midscream, and only their neon complexions give them away as sculptures. They're self-portraits, I realize, after summiting a long set of limestone stairs hacked from ancient coral and meeting my host. In person Bickerton has a big grin, a ruddy perma-tan and close-cropped hair in a color that splits the difference between sun-bleached blond and gray. He wears a uniform of surf shorts, a black T-shirt and extensive tribal tattoos. He doesn't seem to be of this world: he's a wayward leprechan who has pumped some serious iron."

After receiving a BA in Humanities from Boston College and an MA and Ph.D. in Theatre Arts from the University of Wisconsin--interrupted by Army service in Korea--he came to Hofstra in 1964 and retired with emeritus status in 1993.

She is the first artist to win for a sound work: she recorded herself singing a 16th-century Scottish lament under three bridges in Glasgow. The prize, established in 1984 by the Tate in London, goes to a British artist under age 50 and comes with about $39,000. Ms. Philipsz beat out Dexter Dalwood, known for his contemporary take on traditional history paintings; Angela de la Cruz, a painter and sculptor nominated for her installation ""After,"" at the Camden Arts Center in London; and the Otolith Group, consisting of the London artists Anjalika Sagar and Kodwo Eshun, who make documentary films for a series of exhibitions called ""A Long Time Between Suns."" (Finalists each receive about $7,800.) Ms. Philipsz is only the fourth woman to win the award, after Rachel Whiteread, Gillian Wearing and Tomma Abts. In a statement the judges said they ""admired the way in which her work provokes both intellectual and instinctive responses and reflects a series of decisions about the relationship between sound and sight"" and that she ""draws on the immersive properties of sound and uses her own voice to create powerful sculptural experiences."""

The ""Retreat from Marriage"" report suggests that this frame held up more strongly in the 1970s than it does today. On some questions (the morality of premarital sex, whether a divorce should become harder to obtain) well-educated and less-educated Americans seem to have converged over the last few decades, or else the less-educated have become more permissive than college graduates. At the same time, rates of churchgoing have fallen much faster among less-educated Americans than they have among college graduates, to the point where there's now a strongly positive correlation between education and church attendance - one that didn't exist in the '70s. (The recent trend toward secularization, it turns out, may have been driven more by community college dropouts than by Richard Dawkins-reading Ph.Ds.)"

She is the first artist to win for a sound work: she recorded herself singing a 16th-century Scottish lament under three bridges in Glasgow. The prize, established in 1984 by the Tate in London, goes to a British artist under age 50 and comes with about $39,000. Ms. Philipsz beat out Dexter Dalwood, known for his contemporary take on traditional history paintings; Angela de la Cruz, a painter and sculptor nominated for her installation ''After,'' at the Camden Arts Center in London; and the Otolith Group, consisting of the London artists Anjalika Sagar and Kodwo Eshun, who make documentary films for a series of exhibitions called ''A Long Time Between Suns.'' (Finalists each receive about $7,800.) Ms. Philipsz is only the fourth woman to win the award, after Rachel Whiteread, Gillian Wearing and Tomma Abts. In a statement the judges said they ''admired the way in which her work provokes both intellectual and instinctive responses and reflects a series of decisions about the relationship between sound and sight'' and that she ''draws on the immersive properties of sound and uses her own voice to create powerful sculptural experiences.'' This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print."

2010-12-07T00:00:00Z,"Ridley Scott's 1982 ''Blade Runner'' is a stylish action movie starring Harrison Ford as Deckard, a bounty hunter in pursuit of coolly attractive androids. Philip K. Dick's ''Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep?,'' the 1968 book it's based on, is a very different novel of ideas, at its essence about an unhappily married man. In a twist that sounds straight out of the story itself, the movie has become so popular that many fans don't realize that the imitation is not the original. Edward Einhorn's new stage adaptation, which imagines a future populated by humans and androids difficult to distinguish from one another, aims to reclaim the spirit of the book. It's an act of fan love but also dramatically shrewd, since a downtown play is a better forum than a Hollywood blockbuster for a grim meditation on religion, consumerism and what it means to be human."

The lawsuit seeks back pay that could amount to billions of dollars.

Hoyer described the event as a kick in the stomach, and explained how the Red Sox had been searching for a slugging first baseman with above-average defensive skills for years. When Teixeira was lost to Boston, the next player on the list became Adrian Gonzalez, whom the Sox pursued with even more resolve, until they finally acquired him from Hoyer and the Padres on Sunday in a trade for three of Boston's top minor league prospects."

2010-12-07T00:00:00Z,"Watching the Atlantic Theater Company's exquisite productions of ''The Collection'' and ''A Kind of Alaska,'' two short plays by Harold Pinter, I almost forgot that the cast was speaking in a foreign language. Technically, of course, Pinter wrote in English. But as is true of most great dramatists, his syntax, locutions, rhythms and silences make up a sui generis grammar. To navigate the treacherous, autonomous nation that is Pinterland requires a thorough command of this exotic tongue. The facility demonstrated by the ensemble of ''The Collection'' and ''A Kind of Alaska'' -- directed by Karen Kohlhaas and featuring a knockout performance from Lisa Emery as a middle-aged woman waking up from a decades-long coma -- isn't always evident in productions of Pinter, particularly in this country.

The moves, which are relatively rare for Broadway, will allow ''Rain'' to stay open, while ''Rock of Ages'' will be able to lower its weekly running costs (and potentially increase its profit margin) by running in a smaller Broadway house. ''Rain'' began a 12-week run at the Neil Simon Theater in October, as a temporary tenant in between big-budget open-ended musicals.

The show, created by Ted Griffin, the ''Ocean's Eleven'' screenwriter, and whose producers included Shawn Ryan, the creator of ''The Shield,'' was well reviewed at its debut in September. Ginia Bellafante in The New York Times called it ''a welcome love child, one we are eager to embrace rather than put up for adoption.'' But it never seemed to reach a critical mass of viewers, and while we don't want to say its title was to blame, we will point out that Mr. Ryan recently renamed another new cop drama he is preparing, changing its title from ''Ride-Along'' to ''The Chicago Code.''

Kilgore argued that Obama was secure from the risk of a primary challenge, because there's no sign that ""a coherent bloc of Democratic voters-whether liberal or moderate"" have soured on the president. Even when Democrats tell pollsters that they'd like another option in 2012, they can't agree on what kind of option it should be: ""Given a choice of hypothetical challenges, 39 percent of Democrats and leaners preferred a candidate from the left of the president, and 40 percent a candidate from the right."""

His glass and mirror pavilions, which are often plunked down into incongruous environments (say, a forest or the roof of the former DIA building in Chelsea), play tricks on the eye, integrating the spectator into the structure's reflected surfaces. ""He's my dream artist,"" Hardy said earlier this week, acknowledging the homage. His shop, at 30 Jane Street, which was designed by David Mann of MR. Architecture + Decor is a little jewel box - all smokey brown glass and mirrors; its situation, ensconced within the rough and crudely patched walls of a historic carriage house, feels both serene and strangely precarious. ""It's exactly the opposite of Paris,"" Hardy explained. ""There you have historical places you can't touch and you have to work with it. Here we had to destroy and rebuild everything because what was here was unusable. We tried to do something more precious in the middle of something more raw."" A particularly Grahamesque touch comes in the form of two large plates of interlocking glass that section off the 1,400-square-foot space into semi-private cubbies so you can catch furtive glimpses of the woman trying on Hardy's special New York ""Skyline"" shoes next to you (Um, excuse me, do those come in my size?), and still maintain the illusion that you have the place all to yourself."

Expanding at a time when many other designers are just staying above water may be a bold move. But Bittar believes ""it's a great time to come into new cities with a force."" He chose Los Angeles, in particular, because he feels the city, along with New York, ""shapes the country in terms of trends."" San Francisco, on the other hand, is a revenue leader for the company; the new shop will cater to a woman Bittar describes as being more ""artistic, with a personality more like New York City women."" The boutiques' décor incorporates 1930s wallpaper that's been sprayed with graffiti, along with a smattering of the taxidermy groupings that have become a Bittar design statement. ""We're creating animal hybrids with these, like putting swan wings on a gazelle,"" he says. ""On a theatric level, having a store is great. And I think it makes shopping fun."""

2010-12-08T00:00:00Z,"Leonard Bernstein had finished conducting a concert at Philharmonic Hall (now Avery Fisher), and entered the elevator between stage and dressing room. Ken Heyman, who was spending a month with Bernstein for a lengthy photo essay, was there, too, but he had a way of making himself invisible. Later, at a workshop, Ken spoke about techniques used on such projects. One thing: The human cough is more tolerable than a camera click. When Bernstein, for the first time, let himself be photographed while composing, Ken shot sparingly, a cough covering each exposure. Recently, I rode the same elevator, holding Ken's photograph out, trying to match the angle. Someone said, ''Good evening, Maestro.'' Entering the elevator, was Alan Gilbert, music director of the New York Philharmonic. The maestro paid me no heed. Perhaps, with all my coughing, he thought I had a cold. Or more likely, the conductor had more important things on his mind. Earlier photographs in the series are at nytimes.com/lens."

Professor Ross began his career in 1954 as a lecturer at Columbia University and then joined the faculty of Baruch College, City University of New York, where he taught for the past 46 years. His areas of expertise were micro and macro price behavior over business cycles; the relationship between the stock market and the real economy; and monetary, fiscal, and growth policies. He held many leadership positions including department chair, academic director of the Executive MBA Program and the Baruch chapter chair of the Professional Staff Congress. Among his professional honors were a CUNY Distinguished Faculty Award and fellowships at Yale University and Columbia University (the latter, his alma mater). He had also been a consultant to a variety of private, United States and foreign government institutions, notably the United Nations, the Government of Greece, the Ford Foundation, the Peoples Republic of China, and United States Treasury. Beloved, esteemed, and indefatigably kind to the department faculty and staff and his students, Howard was known as a Renaissance man, especially fond of opera, tennis and the New York Yankees. He was the son of Gertrude and Bernard Rosensaft and brother of Lenore Kantrowitz, uncle to Laura, Naomi and Paul, and grand-uncle to Brian and Alex Kennedy, and to Leba Gittel and Paul Kantrowitz's children in Jerusalem, Israel.

Other offers have included Web site design, three months of psychotherapy and a gallop on a white horse.

2010-12-09T11:38:19Z,"One final point on the National Marriage Project report. I've been emphasizing the bad news, but I do think it's genuinely good news that well-educated opinion - as opposed to just well-educated behavior - has been moving in a more conservative direction on divorce. (48 percent of college-educated Americans now agree that ""divorce should be more difficult to obtain,"" up from just 36 percent in the 1970s.) When social conservatives try to envision public policy responses to the crisis of the American family, they're almost inevitably stymied by the fact that our upper class (which is, by extension, our policymaking class), while increasingly conservative in the way its members arrange their own private lives, remains intensely allergic to the kind of legal and cultural paternalism that certain earlier elites practiced as a matter of course. I've suggested before that America would benefit if its upper class showed ""a willingness to translate some of the more conservative habits they've embraced (or partially embraced) in their personal lives into law and public policy,"" but I've never seen much reason for optimism that our elite might actually move in this direction. So the fact that there's been an uptick in college-educated support for reforming divorce laws is better news than I expected - and a sign, perhaps, that the educated class's present mix of private conservatism and public permissiveness isn't set in stone."

More about the implications of these estimates in my next post."

2010-12-09T00:00:00Z,"The curators of a Smithsonian art exhibition that has sparked a firestorm in the last week - first because of the inclusion of a video that included an image of ants crawling on a crucifix, then because of the video's removal from the show - will talk about the show at the New York Public Library next Wednesday. The exhibition, at the National Portrait Gallery in Washington, is titled ''Hide/Seek: Difference and Desire in American Portraiture'' and is devoted to representations of homosexual desire in American art. Early last week, after the head of the Catholic League and some House Republicans attacked the show, focusing on a video by the artist David Wojnarowicz that included the crucifix image, partly as a metaphor for the AIDS crisis, the Smithsonian decided to remove the video from the exhibition. That drew accusations of censorship from, among others, one of the show's two curators, Jonathan Katz, a professor at the State University of New York, Buffalo. Mr. Katz told The Buffalo News that he was outraged not to have been consulted, and called the Smithsonian's decision ''incredibly stupid.''"

2010-12-09T00:00:00Z,"As you may have noticed, we've been writing about Groupon a lot lately. MP Mueller did a post on the experiences of a high-end restaurant in Austin, Tex., and offered some tips. I suggested how you might do the math to assess your Groupon deal (and a smart reader pointed out that I did not fully account for the loss of revenue if your regular customers buy Groupon coupons). In fact, we got lots of smart comments (especially here and here). We also ran several articles when it looked as if Google was going to buy Groupon and another reporting that the founders and owners of Groupon had decided to turn down Google's $6 billion offer. Groupon is a remarkable idea that has been executed remarkably well, but is turning down $6 billion smart 0r insane? In all of our reporting, posting and commenting, we really didn't hear much from one group: the businesses who've used Groupon and were satisfied enough to use it again. Groupon says that more than 95 percent of its merchants want to run another discount. But a study out of Rice University suggests that only 58 percent of Groupon's merchants would want to do it again."

The article recounted how Prasad Thammineni, OfficeDrop's chief executive, struggled at first to find the right background-check company and then faced a daunting variety of checks to choose among -- including drug tests, credit checks and criminal checks. After Mr. Thammineni had done his homework and decided on a ''five-point'' bundle with Kroll Background Screening, which checks a variety of federal and local criminal records as well as Social Security numbers and driving history, he thought his job was done. Every new employee, Mr. Thammineni resolved, would be subject to a background check once he or she had accepted a conditional job offer."

2010-12-09T00:00:00Z,"The 30-year-old chief executive of Groupon, Andrew Mason, is the newest member of tech's most exclusive club: entrepreneurs who walked away from multibillion-dollar takeover offers. On Friday, Mr. Mason rejected Google's $6 billion bid, according to two people with direct knowledge of the situation. The move quashed the search giant's hope of buying the fast-growing social buying site and put Groupon on track for an eventual public offering. Whether his gamble is a brilliant play or a Friendster fumble - the once promising social network that tumbled after snubbing an offer from Google - remains to be seen. For now, Mr. Mason, who is currently juggling television appearances and managing a recent spike in traffic, seems content with Groupon's trajectory. Mr. Mason spoke with DealBook on Wednesday about his company's prospects, the opportunities in the local advertising market, and why he likes dollhouses. Q.How was Friday? A.What happened on Friday? Haha Friday was a good day."

So Ms. Gottesman, who lives on Long Island, put up a Web site under the name of Smash Party Entertainment, offering entertainment for parties, ranging from casinos to living Roman ''statues'' to murder mysteries. And then she waited for the business to come in -- which it didn't, even though she was advertising in local newspapers and mailing out coupons. After three months of staring at the phone, she decided to try $20 worth of pay-per-click advertising through Google's AdWords service, which placed her short ads alongside the search results for certain keywords, as well as on some Web pages with content related to those keywords. ''In a few days,'' she said, ''the phone started ringing.''"

''It's time for our phone,'' a narrator intones, ''to save us from our phones.'' The new Windows Phone 7, we are told, is ''designed to get you in and out and back to life'' -- something many small-business owners long for. I'm twitchy for two reasons.

Tim Miller might be one of the last working theater artists to embrace fully the term, already vague to the point of meaninglessness when Eric Bogosian made fun of it in his 1994 slacker drama, ''Suburbia.'' Whatever. Let Mr. Miller call himself whatever he wants. This influential artist, who helped found Performance Space 122 and relentlessly tours the country with his lean, personal and deceptively canny shows, has earned respect -- albeit not as much as is given to him by Tony Kushner, who (jokingly?) compares him to Proust in the introduction to Mr. Miller's book of plays, ''Body Blows.''

2010-12-09T00:00:00Z,"The word in the philanthropic world is that Bill Gates and Warren E. Buffett are planning to announce 15 more signatories to the Giving Pledge they started last summer, bringing the total number of billionaires and multimillionaires committed to giving away at least half their wealth to 65. A spokesman for Mr. Gates declined to comment on his plans, answering a question about whether to expect an announcement on Thursday with this e-mail message: ''We are hoping to pull together an announcement of new pledge takers, and we'll make sure you get whatever goes out when we make the announcement.'' Speculating about whose names might be added to the list - and whose names were absent the first time around - has become a sort of party game in certain circles. Currently, three Steves - Steve Jobs, Steve Cohen and Steve Schwarzman - are among the most hotly anticipated additions, as are any of member of the Tisch and Walton families, Oprah Winfrey, Steve Ballmer and David Geffen. The pledge has not been without controversy. Some critics have branded it a publicity stunt, while others have noted that many of those signing have already given away a great deal of their wealth. Whatever its significance, though, it has sparked a worldwide discussion of philanthropy, which was in many ways its goal. ''The real value of this at this stage is in serving as a role model, inspiring, leading the way,'' said Salvatore LaSpada, chief executive of the Institute for Philanthropy, a philanthropic advisory firm. ''It is really important in validating philanthropy as a worthy pursuit.'' This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print."

Beyond that, Hemingway's chest-beating, rifle-bearing Papa Bear explorer persona seems overbearingly pompous if not creepily antediluvian in these postfeminist times. For all the cinematic crimes against him, there has been no book-to-screen translation of his work quite as atrocious as ''Hemingway's Garden of Eden,'' directed by John Irvin from a screenplay by James Scott Linville. An adaptation of Hemingway's problematic erotic novel, ''The Garden of Eden,'' posthumously published in 1986, it stars Mena Suvari as the meanest mean girl (pun intended) to spit venom in any film since I don't know when."

While the Obama administration has done nothing in the courts to block the publication of any of the leaked documents, or even, as of yet, tried to indict the WikiLeaks founder, Julian Assange, for any crime, American officials and politicians have been widely condemned in the European news media for calling the leaks everything from ''terrorism'' (Representative Peter T. King, Republican of New York) to ''an attack against the international community'' (Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton). Secretary of Defense Robert M. Gates called the arrest of Mr. Assange on separate rape charges ''good news.''

After an interview with Mr. Colbert in which Mr. Martin was tested on his artistic acumen (among other tasks, he was asked to distinguish between an Ellsworth Kelly painting and a Sherwin-Williams swatch), he was called upon to determine the value of a portrait of Mr. Colbert. Mr. Martin initially placed its worth at about $19 (''if I wanted it,'' he said), at which point the artists Frank Stella, Shepard Fairey and Andres Serrano came out one by one to evaluate and/or modify the painting. Mr. Fairey added his telltale ''Obey'' logo and Mr. Serrano drew a Hitleresque mustache on Mr. Colbert's likeness.

The auction house said the winning bid, which includes the house's commission, was made by Adam Sender, whom it identified as an American collector; he is also a hedge fund trader whose office is home to works by Ed Ruscha, Kara Walker and John Currin, according to a recent report by Bloomberg News.

On about two dozen albums since the early 1990s Mr. Oldham (who has also recorded under his own name, as Palace Brothers and as Palace Music, among others) has staked his own territory within Americana: a zone of countryish twang and diffident but tenacious vocals, of pain and longing, of madness and glimpses of redemption, of irregular structures that unravel and pull themselves together, again and again. The songs linger and then lurch, skip beats or add them; they move at their own wayward pace, sure of their intent."

The company is now joined with Spyker, a boutique Dutch supercar builder.The 9-5 sedan was shaped by Simon Padian, who runs the design studio in Sweden. Mr. Padian has said the design was inspired by the acclaimed 2006 Aero X concept. He also sought to evoke traditional Saab features: a wraparound windshield, a hockey-stick shape for the rear side glass, clean body sides and a concave C-pillar that goes back to the Saab 99.In fact, the 9-5 does not have a single one of these features, at least not as they existed on older Saabs, but several are cosmetically represented. The 9-5 offers a quick lesson in car design tricks and gimmicks. In recent years, market pressures have cornered Saab designers into using lipstick and eyebrow pencil to disguise other vehicles as Saabs: the Subaru Impreza wagon as the 9-2X, the Chevrolet TrailBlazer as the 9-7X, the Cadillac SRX as the 9-4X.On the 9-5, the body proportions and other features are dictated by the use of G.M.'s Epsilon II platform, making the 9-5"

Professor Ross began his career in 1954 as a lecturer at Columbia University and then joined the faculty of Baruch College, City University of New York, where he taught for the past 46 years. His areas of expertise were micro and macro price behavior over business cycles; the relationship between the stock market and the real economy; and monetary, fiscal, and growth policies. He held many leadership positions including department chair, academic director of the Executive MBA Program and the Baruch chapter chair of the Professional Staff Congress. Among his professional honors were a CUNY Distinguished Faculty Award and fellowships at Yale University and Columbia University (the latter, his alma mater). He had also been a consultant to a variety of private, United States and foreign government institutions, notably the United Nations, the Government of Greece, the Ford Foundation, the Peoples Republic of China, and United States Treasury. Beloved, esteemed, and indefatigably kind to the department faculty and staff and his students, Howard was known as a Renaissance man, especially fond of opera, tennis and the New York Yankees. He was the son of Gertrude and Bernard Rosensaft and brother of Lenore Kantrowitz, uncle to Laura, Naomi and Paul, and grand-uncle to Brian and Alex Kennedy, and to Leba Gittel and Paul Kantrowitz's children in Jerusalem, Israel. He will be greatly missed. A memorial service will be held at Baruch College on Monday, December 20, 2010, from noon to 1pm, in Room 750, Information and Technology Building, 151 East 25th St., New York."
2010-12-12T00:00:00Z,"I realize that dining out, other than at McDonald's, can be an expensive proposition. But as I look down at my Diet Coke and my house salad ordered from the ''Sides'' column of the menu, I wonder how you, Group Dinner Money Collector, can in good conscience request $30 from me with a straight face. Allow me to clarify that I am not cheap. If I am hungry enough to order a Porterhouse, I will (I have) - and I will pay for it (including tax and tip). Many a time, however, when I agree to go out to eat with a bunch of people, it is more about the company than the food - especially during this holiday season. So even if I'm not all that ravenous, or am watching my weight or had a big lunch, I order a little something just to have a plate in front of me while I socialize."

2010-12-12T00:00:00Z,"It goes without saying that acting is a matter of discipline and craft, and that what the best performers do is always subject to analysis, criticism and argument. They say their lines, hit their marks, suffer through retakes and rehearsals, and they trust that an artisanal collaboration with writers, technicians, directors and other actors will somehow yield a work of art. But acting is also an art by itself: alchemical, mysterious, at times almost magical. A person transforms into someone else -- a dancer, a Texas Ranger, a wife exiled from her native country, a young vampire, a former militant, a mogul in old age -- and in the process reveals something basic and essential that is his or hers alone. In the past, we have invited the year's great performers to be themselves for the camera and, on video, to talk about what they do. This year, we asked them to do it: to show us -- in a few gestures and with a few props but without dialogue or story -- what acting is. And here they are, striking some of the classic attitudes of cinema, turning their bodies and faces into instruments of pure, deep and enigmatic emotion. You will, of course, recognize them immediately and admire their grace, daring and skill. But you also may be startled to see how thoroughly themselves they are in the midst of pretending otherwise."
2010-12-12T00:00:00Z,"TOWNIES When Justin opened the door to his apartment, I was hit with a dank, overpowering smell. He said that a pipe had burst last January, gushing enough scalding water to turn the bathroom into a mold-filled, 24-hour steam room. Water damage had wrecked the floors. They were so rotted that you could dip your arm up to your elbow into the floorboard below the toilet. Meanwhile, huge chunks of the ceiling were missing, and you could see into the rafters above. I thought about Justin getting ready for school in the mornings. How did he take a shower? That bathroom was the worst I had ever seen in New York. It looked like a hurri- cane had hit it (I'm from Florida; I've seen a water-logged bathroom after a hurricane, and this was just as bad). And after I saw it, I was really shaken. My mind was racing: I started to fanta- size about taking Mayor Bloomberg to visit that bathroom, and forcing him to explain to me how this could have hap- pened. It felt unacceptable -- funda- mentally, jarringly so.-- ELIZABETH DWOSKIN, Excerpt from ''The Worst Bathroom in New York'' FIXES Empowering and Strengthening Ohio's People (ESOP), a not-for-profit organization with about 50 employees and 10 offices across Ohio, acts as a good-faith intermediary between par- ties to negotiate sustainable mortgage ''workouts.'' So why don't the banks refuse to sign the agreements or take the tours, and just foreclose? ESOP uses both a carrot and a stick. The car-rot is that ESOP genuinely helps its lenders do something they are not structured to do well: communicate ef- fectively with a large number of dis- tressed borrowers.But perhaps the biggest reason for ESOP's success is that, when push comes to shove, it knows how to fo-cus the attention of lenders. That's the stick -- and it har- kens back to ESOP's early days as a take-no-prisoners community organizer that fought to improve education and policing in Cleveland's poorest neighborhoods.-- DAVID BORNSTEIN, Excerpt from ''Foreclosure Is Not an Option''For more, nytimes.com/opinionator"

Ann was born in Rochester, New York to Bernice and Julian Bakrow in 1921, the youngest of two children. Ann married Hillard Sutin in 1946 and they had two children. In 1981, Ann married Daniel Klepak, and they spent sixteen years of bliss together until Dan passed in 1997. In 2000, Ann met and later became engaged to the wonderful and generous Dr. Milton Sandler. Ann will always be loved and remembered by her family and her wonderful circle of friends with whom she shared her life of dinner parties, Broadway shows, and, of course, the many evenings of Bridge, Canasta and Gin Rummy. Ann was a grand woman with style and class who possessed an irrepressible joy of life. Ann was a stunning model for Eastman Kodak, and like Auntie Mame, she was the life of the party and she believed in Christmas in July. In the face any obstacle, there was only good luck, a positive omen and a brighter future. Ann was the eternal optimist who always gave us reason to have faith and believe in the miracle of tomorrow and a new day. Mom always said the life was for the living, and she truly appreciated and lived every second of it. Bless you our Auntie Mame and your incredible spirit, we will forever love you and miss you. Ann is survived by her loving children, Judith A. Sutin, MD of Buffalo, NY and Ken Sutin, MD of New York, NY, her step-daughter, Barbara (and Dr. Bruce) Shickmanter, and grandchildren, Lenore and Margo. Funeral services were held on Friday December 10, 2010."

2010-12-12T00:00:00Z,"Over the last couple of seasons, expert skiers at Western resorts known for deep snow have been using some unusual-looking gear: skis that are not only very wide -- now standard for powder -- but skis that have noticeably upturned, almost cartoonish-looking tips and tails. These skiers were early adopters of a ski design that is poised to dominate the retail racks. Known as rockered skis, the skis have varying degrees of reverse camber, or upward curvature, along the base (picture a rocking chair runner). As a result, they float infinitely better in powder, maneuver readily through turns and have more stability."

He was 81. His distinguished 52-year career was remarkable for its breadth. It encompassed 14 years of professional practice with architectural firms in New York City and Washington, D.C. on a wide range of urban projects. He taught in the School of Architecture at the University of Virginia for 28 years, where he served as Director of the Historic Preservation Program and founded the School's first international study programs, in Vicenza and Venice, which remain an essential part of the curriculum. As author of a number of influential works on the theory and ethics of historic preservation he redefined and expanded the scope of the field and the values informing its practice. Mario di Valmarana was born on August 16, 1929, in Venice, Italy. After earning his architecture degree from the Istituto Universitario di Architettura in Venice in 1955, he moved the following year to New York City, where he practiced architecture and attended graduate courses in Columbia University's School of Architecture. In 1963 he married Betty Baker Supplee in Philadelphia. During the 1960s he practiced architecture as an associate in a variety of firms, including Alfred E. Poor, Architects, New York; Giuliani Associates Architects, Washington, D.C., and Corning, Moore, Elmore & Fischer, Washington, D.C. In 1972 he was recruited to teach in the University of Virginia's School of Architecture, which remained his academic home until his retirement in 2000. He was a legendary professor who combined a profound grasp of the history of architecture, studio instruction, and historic preservation with enthusiasm, eloquence, and a sense of humor. A strong advocate for historic preservation, both nationally and internationally, he chaired the Advisory Committee for the restoration of Frank Lloyd Wright's Fallingwater and supervised the preservation of Andrea Palladio's Villa Almerico Capra ""La Rotonda"", which is owned by the Valmarana family. He also founded the Center for Palladian Studies in America and received numerous awards for his work in preservation, including an Honorary Citizenship from the city of New Orleans and a Knighthood from the Italian government. He is survived by his wife, Betty, and two sons, Francesco and Alessandro, two brothers, Lodovico and Alberto, and two sisters, Lodovica Grimani and Maria Catalano Gonzaga, as well as three grandchildren. He will be remembered for his love of family and friends, his generosity and boundless energy, and his grace, kindness, and eloquence. He loved life's beauty and bounty, whether in the form of good wine, delicious food, rare books, fine art, or outstanding architecture. He imparted that spirit to those who knew him, and they have never forgotten it. He was a deeply cultivated man. The family requests that, if desired, any contributions be made through the UVa School of Architecture Foundation to safeguard the funding for the Venetan Programs that Professor di Valmarana founded 35 years ago. Please direct your contribution to the Mario di Valmarana Memorial Fund payable to the UVa School of Architecture Foundation, P.O. Box 400122, Charlottesville, Virginia 22901."

2010-12-12T00:00:00Z,"von der MOSEL--Valentina, MD, on 12th November 2010 joined her daughter Gretel, Mischi and others she had loved. She was born in Prague 21st April 1926 into the white Russian liberal intelligentsia. Three generations of the family fled west into Bavaria as the Bolsheviks approached with the end of WWII. Four generations emigrated to the US in 1949. After two years of fruitless efforts to continue her education here, she returned to Munich where she completed her Doctorate in Medicine at Ludwig Maximilian University. After finishing internship and residency at various New York City Hospitals she opened a practice in Weehawken, and subsequently North Bergen, NJ. Specializing in ob-gyn, she soon joined the Margaret Sanger Clinic in NYC, and went on into infertility and birth-control work, including research on IUD's. On staff at a number of tri-state area hospitals, she was known as a demanding perfectionist, as well as an extraordinarily talented and able surgeon. In 1982, shortly after the death of her beloved daughter Margarethe, she returned to a psychiatric residency at Roosevelt-St. Lukes with a subsequent fellowship at Columbia University's Psychiatric Institute. She continued to see patients until 2007 when she retired. Valentina von der Mosel was a truly rare person. She had an enormous intelligence which facilitated her in a broad spectrum of interests. A talented cook, with a reputation for brilliant entertaining, she was equally well versed in classical music, ballet, art, as well as botany and a love of gardening. She was an active alpinist (one peak in Swiss-French border area named after her after her first ascent thereof) as well as a die-hard skier until vision problems forced her to stop ten years ago. She always loved Europe and all things European, particularly Germany and France, though she traveled throughout Britain, N. Africa and the rest of the continent. In brief, she loved life, spiritual and physical, and feasted on the sweet and the bitter. A person with a forthright, straightforward nature, she had her quarrels. However, her friendships lasted scores of years, and her many true friends miss her sorely. She is survived in the US by her son Alexej Getmanov, and by several cousins in Europe."

Once the ''field'' is covered in white powder, wait for Brett Favre to explain how the Midwestern blizzard and the breathtaking footage of a major architectural landmark caving in is really just a backdrop for his personal saga. Conspiracy theorists will note that the extra day off gives Favre's shoulder more time to heal. That assumes that he has enough pull to call in a blizzard and have a building demolished and that he does not do his own shoveling.

But things make more sense if you look at recent events as merely the latest in a decades-long series of naval clashes between the two Koreas resulting from a disputed sea boundary that was hastily imposed by the United Nations forces -- without North Korean agreement -- after the 1953 armistice that halted the Korean War. Several times the dispute has flared into bloody naval battles, most notably in 1999, when at least 17 North Korean sailors died, and in 2002, when four South Koreans and at least 30 North Koreans were killed."

She was born in Prague 21st April 1926 into the white Russian liberal intelligentsia. Three generations of the family fled west into Bavaria as the Bolsheviks approached with the end of WWII. Four generations emigrated to the US in 1949. After two years of fruitless efforts to continue her education here, she returned to Munich where she completed her Doctorate in Medicine at Ludwig Maximilian University. After finishing internship and residency at various New York City Hospitals she opened a practice in Weehawken, and subsequently North Bergen, NJ. Specializing in ob-gyn, she soon joined the Margaret Sanger Clinic in NYC, and went on into infertility and birth-control work, including research on IUD's. On staff at a number of tri-state area hospitals, she was known as a demanding perfectionist, as well as an extraordinarily talented and able surgeon. In 1982, shortly after the death of her beloved daughter Margarethe, she returned to a psychiatric residency at Roosevelt-St. Lukes with a subsequent fellowship at Columbia University's Psychiatric Institute. She continued to see patients until 2007 when she retired. Valentina von der Mosel was a truly rare person. She had an enormous intelligence which facilitated her in a broad spectrum of interests. A talented cook, with a reputation for brilliant entertaining, she was equally well versed in classical music, ballet, art, as well as botany and a love of gardening. She was an active alpinist (one peak in Swiss-French border area named after her after her first ascent thereof) as well as a die-hard skier until vision problems forced her to stop ten years ago. She always loved Europe and all things European, particularly Germany and France, though she traveled throughout Britain, N. Africa and the rest of the continent. In brief, she loved life, spiritual and physical, and feasted on the sweet and the bitter. A person with a forthright, straightforward nature, she had her quarrels. However, her friendships lasted scores of years, and her many true friends miss her sorely. She is survived in the US by her son Alexej Getmanov, and by several cousins in Europe."

Mr. Jackman, who is one of several Australian celebrities being filmed at the Sydney Opera House for a series of special episodes called ""Oprah's Ultimate Australian Adventure,"" was zipping onto the set while suspended in a wire harness device called a flying fox, but at the end of his speedy trip collided with a lighting rig suspended above the stage. The Press Association said Mr. Jackman was bleeding from his right eye as he was removed from the rigging, and taping was halted for about 10 minutes while he received medical treatment (and a glass of red wine), but the actor returned to the set with a black eye and bandages to finish his interview. ""That was so much fun until the end,"" Mr. Jackman said."

It is easy to assert that there ought to be prosecutions of corporate chieftains -- ''show trials'' like the Soviet Union used to stage -- because of the enormous losses sustained from the meltdown. Actually proving criminal charges is much more difficult, however, if the government has only sketchy evidence of an executive's involvement in questionable decisions and the applicable legal standards are vague, at best."

Having withdrawn himself from ''The Hobbit'' movies when the future of that film franchise was less certain, Mr. del Toro, the ''Pan's Labyrinth'' and ''Hellboy'' director, has found a new dark fantasy series to keep him busy, but it won't be coming soon to a theater near you. On Monday, the video game publisher THQ Inc. said it had struck ''a multiyear agreement'' for Mr. del Toro to create a new game trilogy called inSANE.

The good news is that Clinton sees the peril that Israel is moving toward. ''The ever-evolving technology of war'' means that, in the absence of a peace deal, ''it will be increasingly difficult to guarantee the security of Israeli families.'' Further, ''long-term population trends ... are endangering the Zionist vision of a Jewish and democratic state.''"

Anyone looking for evidence of the tensions now has a marquee example. The Los Angeles Museum of Contemporary Art, run by the former New York gallery owner Jeffrey Deitch - a longtime champion of street art - late last week ordered a wall mural it had commissioned by Blu, an Italian graffiti artist, to be whitewashed because it found the artwork inappropriate. The mural, on a wall of the museum's Geffen Contemporary wing, was planned as a kind of advertisement for an ambitious exhibition focusing on street art that the museum will open in April. But as Blu neared completion of the mural - which conveyed a strident antiwar message, showing rows of caskets draped with one-dollar bills instead of flags - the museum changed its mind and began painting it over on Thursday. The decision, reported by the Los Angeles Downtown News, was made because the mural wall faces an ambulatory care center for veterans and a monument honoring Japanese-American soldiers in World War II. ''The museum's director explained to Blu that in this context, where MOCA is a guest among this historic Japanese-American community, the work was inappropriate,'' the museum said in an e-mail, adding that Mr. Deitch had invited the artist to paint another mural."

And a picture caption with the article also misstated, in some copies, the treatment the victim received for her severed nose. As the article correctly noted, she has been fitted with a prosthetic nose; she has not yet undergone reconstructive surgery."

The officers, board and staff of the American Technion Society (ATS) mourn the loss of Reinhard Frank of Cambridge, MA, whose more than 25 years of dedicated support of the Technion have been a source of inspiration. He was an active member of the Technion International Board of Governors and the ATS New England Chapter. A Holocaust survivor whose own education was interrupted, Mr. Frank made access to education his highest priority. His support of the Technion reflected this, and included the Reinhard Frank Technology Education Laboratory and the Gateways-Youth Wing Extension of the New England Region Center for Pre-University Education. Mr. Frank was a Technion Guardian, achieving the highest level of commitment, and he was recognized with a Technion honorary fellowship in 2004, and honorary doctorate in 2009.

The deal is the largest involving a real estate investment trust like HCR in the last three years, and will bolster HCP's presence in high-end nursing. HCR, based in Toledo, Ohio, is among the nation's biggest nursing operators and has benefited from rising demand for care that costs less than what hospitals can provide."

But the studio said on Monday that it wouldn't try to take down the Web satire, either. The video, which was posted Monday morning on YouTube, appears to be rendered in the same 3-D style as ''Yogi Bear,'' an animated feature starring Dan Aykroyd (as the voice of Yogi) and Justin Timberlake (as his sidekick, Boo Boo) that Warner Brothers will release on Friday. The key difference is that the parody, which takes its cues from the 2007 Western ''The Assassination of Jesse James by the Coward Robert Ford,'' ends with Boo Boo blasting Yogi with a rifle (the violence is implied but not depicted on screen) and turning him into a bearskin rug."

After nearly 50 years with The New York Times, Ernie retired in 1972, having won a bevy of awards and mentored dozens of photographers. He took many great pictures. But his most challenging moment was on July 28, 1945, when a B-25 bomber lost in a dense fog crashed into the Empire State Building, tearing a hole between the 78th and 80th floors and killing 14 people. The photograph above was taken when Ernie persuaded two other photographers to hold his legs while he hung over a parapet overlooking the gash. The others, not interested in repeating Ernie's derring-do, passed Ernie their film holders, and he shot an image for each of them.

2010-12-15T00:00:00Z,"If you were an arbitrager in Airgas hoping against the odds that the Delaware Chancery Court would provide a Christmas present, you would likely be disappointed. A teleconference hearing was held on Monday in the lawsuit brought by Air Product and Chemicals seeking to have the Delaware court redeem Airgas' poison pill. At that hearing, Chancellor William B. Chandler III informed the parties that he would be on vacation through the New Year and that he was not ''going to give any decision until the first of the year, the New Year.'' Chancellor Chandler also noted he would be working on the decision during that time. The delay, if it really is one, is not surprising. The judge was unlikely to rule until Airgas had responded to Air Products' latest offer. It has yet to do so, and while the federal securities laws require a prompt response, Airgas clearly has some internal matters it needs to sort through before the board can decide. In the wake of this teleconference, Chancellor Chandler circulated a letter on Tuesday to the parties (see below). From the letter, it appears that Chancellor Chandler is skeptical of Airgas' argument that the whole case is moot because the trial concerned an offer of $65.50 per share and Air Products is now offering $70 per share. He invites Air Products to submit a full response to this argument and quotes Air Products' lawyer to ask whether this was all one ''big 'moot court exercise.''' The judge also poses new questions to Airgas. His questions are: Depending on the responses that I receive, I also may decide to grant plaintiffs and defendants an abbreviated discovery window as well as provide counsel with an opportunity for oral argument with respect to whether or not the $70 offer is a threat."

Crown said in a statement that the first book from Mr. Williams, planned for a summer publication and not yet titled, will ''focus on free speech and the growing difficulty in America of speaking out on sensitive topics.'' In the book Mr. Williams ''will argue that the American public benefits from a vigorous and full-throated debate on hot button issues of political and cultural import'' and ''chronicle his own first-hand experience of the consequences of crossing the line in public expression,'' the statement said."

While this is not a definitive analysis of the economy, it does show if things are moving in the right direction. All of the statistical information that follows is from the Bureau of Economic Analysis, or B.E.A., and is inflation-adjusted.According to the National Bureau of Economic Research, the recession ended in June 2009, or the end of the second quarter of 2009. Since then, the U.S. economy has grown for 5 consecutive quarters at the following quarter to quarter rates: 1.6 percent, 5.0 percent, 3.7 percent, 1.7 percent and 2.5 percent. This is a median growth rate of 2.5 percent. The median growth rate for the first five quarters of the early 1990s and early 2000s expansions were 2.7 percent and 2 percent respectively, placing the growth rate of the current recovery right in the middle of the pack. This also indicates that slower growth at the beginning of a recovery is not atypical."

2010-12-16T00:00:00Z,"HOROWITZ--David H.,82, died peacefully at home on Tuesday, December 14, 2010. Terminally ill with cancer, he showed great courage facing his disease, comforted at the end by the presence of family and friends. Born September 11, 1928 to Abraham and Florence Bob Horowitz in New York City, David was educated in the city's public schools before entering Columbia University at the age of 16. While in college he earned admission in Phi Beta Kappa. After enrolling in Columbia Law School in 1948 he became editor of the Columbia Law Review. Following graduation he clerked for Judge Stanley Fuld, and then joined the Schwartz & Frohlich law firm that specialized in entertainment law. In 1963 he moved to Screen Gems, Inc., and then to its parent company, Columbia Pictures, Inc. in 1968 where he served as vice-president and general counsel. In 1973 he joined Warner Communications, where among other positions he served as co-chief operating officer with particular responsibility for the company's music and cable operations. In 1980 David helped to establish a joint venture between Warner Communications and American Express that developed programming specifically for cable television; under his direction its first creation was a channel devoted to music videos, well-known now as MTV. When MTV became an independent public company in 1984, David was its first president and chief executive officer. He left MTV after it was acquired by VIACOM, but continued to be active in the entertainment and technology areas. For many years he was active in SPIN magazine, including serving as its publisher, as well as serving as a consultant for ASCAP. He taught entertainment and copyright law at New York University and Columbia Law School, and served on the board of directors of a wide range of new internet companies. David bought a home in Santa Fe in the mid-1990s, and settled permanently here in 1999. He quickly became active in many local cultural institutions, including the Lensic Performing Arts Center and the Santa Fe Opera. He also was a trustee of the College of Santa Fe and an executive board member of the Governor's Council on Film and Media Industries. Courtly, generous, and widely-read, he is remembered for his intellect, generosity, and endless curiosity about all aspects of our world's culture. He is survived by his wife Susan, children Marilyn, Roger, Diana, and Adam, stepson Justin Weyerhaeuser, and grandchildren Jason and Lucy. A memorial service to remember his life will take place at the Lensic Performing Arts Center, 211 West San Francisco Street in Santa Fe, NM on Thursday, December 16, at 11am. In lieu of flowers, please send contributions to the Lensic or the Santa Fe Community Foundation."
2010-12-16T00:00:00Z,"49ers (5-8) at Chargers (7-6)Thursday, 8:20 p.m.Line: Chargers by 9 One of these teams is not like the other. One of these teams just doesn't belong. Both the Chargers and 49ers are still in the playoff picture, and the two teams won their games by a combined score of 71-21 last week. But the Chargers are legitimate contenders; they lead the A.F.C. in yards per game (399.6), lead the N.F.L. in fewest yards allowed per game (265.5), and lead the planet in inventive self-sabotage, which explains their 7-6 record. The 49ers are just another bunch of toddlers splashing around the N.F.C.West kiddie pool, their 40-21 drubbing of Seattle this week the football equivalent of a good soaking in a water pistol fight. Alex Smith has replaced Troy Smith as the 49ers quarterback once and for all, meaning that his job is safe until at least halftime."

2010-12-16T00:00:00Z,"FINGER--Gregory. The Center for Constitutional Rights (CCR) deeply mourns the untimely loss of our beloved Board Chair and former Executive Director Gregory H. Finger. Greg, a longtime social justice organizer and activist, passed away at his home on the morning of December 13, 2010. To the end he believed that the struggle against racism is indispensable to the achievement of justice. CCR was graced with Greg for 39 years and he was the bedrock upon which CCR was built. Greg dedicated his life to justice and service to humanity. From his work as a young man in the racial justice movements of the 1950's to his years as an organizer for the Congress on Racial Equality (CORE) in the mid-1960's, to his anti-war activism during the Vietnam era, to his more than three decades as director of the co-ed, multiracial Camp Thoreau, Greg was a living, breathing example to all of us of how to speak truth to power and live life to the fullest. Greg's commitment to service was further evident in his many years volunteering as a firefighter, emergency response technician, and community leader. Greg is greatly missed by his friends and colleagues. Our loss of Greg has opened a gap in our lives that he would have wanted filled with our efforts to make a better world. Our deep and sincere condolences go to his wife, Joan Hollister, his brother Karl, and the host of family members so beloved by Greg. Our hearts are with you all."

2010-12-16T00:00:00Z,"Fifty years later, on a gray December day, there is little to indicate that the corner of Seventh Avenue and Sterling Place in Park Slope, Brooklyn, bore violent witness to the worst air disaster at the time, that the disembodied leviathan tail of a ruined jet came to rest here amid flaming carnage and falling brick. There is no marker, no memorial to the 90 people whose bodies littered the sidewalk the slushy morning of Dec. 16, 1960, when a United Airlines DC-8 plunged down after colliding with a Lockheed Constellation over Staten Island. The Pillar of Fire Church, destroyed when the jet slammed into it and exploded, and the corner building with the grocery store and the Chinese laundry, consumed by flame, have been replaced by condominiums that more or less fit in with the brownstone row houses."

Through his unique vision, passion, and extraordinary powers of persuasion, the American Academy in Berlin was born. And he accomplished all of this while actively involved in major foreign policy initiatives on behalf of his country. Richard Holbrooke's friendship, intellect, and personality were indispensable to the institution's continuing success. The Academy opened its doors as a center for visiting American scholars, writers, artists, and public policy experts in 1998. Over the past 15 years, thanks to Ambassador Holbrooke, the American Academy has evolved into a major voice in the US-German dialogue, reinforcing the bonds between the people of Germany and the people of the United States. His mentorship, creativity, and ever inspiring presence will be greatly missed by all of us. Henry A. Kissinger and Karl von der Heyden, Co-Chair Gahl Hodges Burt, Vice-Chair Norman Pearlstine, President & CEO Gary Smith, Executive Dir."

Dr. Falzon was also fluent in four of the official languages of the United Nations. He was, for a time, Dean of the United Nations French Language Program. A French citizen, Dr. Falzon studied at the University of Paris and at the London School of Economics. He held doctorates in Economics, Physics and International law.

Any return would be for a limited run, the producers said in a statement on Thursday. To that end, the return is timed to help the musical's prospects of receiving Tony nominations and perhaps Tonys themselves, dear to any producer's heart; shows that run in the spring fare better with the nominators, who will make their picks on May 2."

2010-12-18T00:00:00Z,"The Broadway musical ''Spider-Man: Turn Off the Dark'' will delay its opening night by four weeks, until Monday, Feb. 7, to provide more time for its creators - the director Julie Taymor and U2's Bono and the Edge - to make changes in the $65 million show before theater critics review it, the lead producer announced on Friday. As a result, the musical will now have a total of 10 weeks of preview performances, one of the longest stretches in Broadway history. Bono and the Edge are set to return to New York this month after a U2 tour and resume work on the superhero musical, which has drawn sharp complaints from a good number of audience members about the clarity of the storytelling, the quality of the music and the overall good time of the show, which is far and away the most expensive in Broadway history. Some show executives are also concerned about the storytelling, particularly some of the narrative complications in Act II. The delay is intended in part to provide time for the creators to stage a new final number, make further rewrites to the dialogue and consider adding and cutting scenes and perhaps inserting new music from Bono and Edge."

The 2001 issue noted that, in its selection of items, 'frivolous ideas are given the same prominence as weighty ones'; that is easiest to do when we still don't know which are which.'' THE BEST IDEA OF EACH YEAR 2001: ''Populist Editing.'' Wikipedia has since eclipsed the Encyclopaedia Britannica and Microsoft's Encarta project, and many of us use it almost every day."

''Making sure these kids have a shot at the American Dream like I did is very important,'' he said, choking up, when asked on ''60 Minutes'' about his crying. But a look at Boehner's record during his two decades in Congress shows a man who has voted against nearly every boost for the working stiff. There's no empathy for those with the longest shots at the American Dream in his voting pattern. Instead, we see a politician who is hard-hearted in his legislative treatment of the people now coping with the kind of economic conditions in which the Boehner family grew up."

Coughlin's stern-yet-fair demeanor helped Brandon Jacobs move beyond the helmet-tossing incident and reclaim a role in the offense, and he transformed Matt Dodge from scapegoat to solid punter. The even-keel routine got the Giants through two different two-game losing streaks, and it kept them focused enough to weather a snowbound day in an airport and produce a blowout against an opponent with something to prove. If trapped in an airport terminal for too long, Jets coaches might fiddle with the runway lights just for a joke. Coughlin's disciplinarian credibility yields real dividends."

Using everything from fancy submersibles to old seafood-restaurant menus, the scientists produced more than 2,600 papers, the highlights of which were released in a 64-page report in October. Among the ''large, active and conspicuous organisms'' that no one knew existed is a new species of spiny lobster, Palinurus barbarae, which was found by a Spanish fishing boat on the Walters Shoals in the Indian Ocean, 400 nautical miles south of Madagascar, and classified by South African marine biologists.

2010-12-19T00:00:00Z,"Tatarsky felt a sensation of instantaneous, piercing recognition. The shoes had pointed toes and high heels and were made of good leather. They were a light yellowish-brown, stitched with a light-blue thread and decorated with large gold buckles in the form of harps. It wasn't that they were simply in bad taste, or vulgar; they were the clear embodiment of what a certain drunken teacher of Soviet literature from the Literary Institute used to call 'our gestalt', and the sight was so pitiful, laughable and touching (especially the harp buckles) that tears sprang to Tatarsky's eyes. The shoes were covered by a thick layer of dust: the new era obviously had no use for them. The Soviet Union only factors into our idea of fashion history through its strange encounters with the West: Raisa Gorbachev sitting stone-faced in the front row at a Pierre Cardin runway show; Jacqueline Kennedy Onassis and Diana Vreeland trying to pry czarist vestments from the Hermitage for a Costume Institute exhibition at the Met; an elegant Pat Nixon, fresh from a shopping trip at Henri Bendel, posing on the cover of Life Magazine with Khrushchev's wife. (Nina was dressed in a frumpy khalat, a babushka frock that's perfect for picking cucumbers at the dacha, or weeping.) Then of course there's this amazing Wendy's hamburger commercial from the 1980s, which treats the whole notion of Soviet fashion as a (hilarious) joke. Yves Saint-Laurent's use of Mother Russia as muse may have caused fireworks in 1976. But the Reds themselves had nothing to contribute to world fashion. Or so we thought."

2010-12-20T22:07:37Z,"This is a story about a plan to end chronic homelessness in the United States. It's not an indeterminate ""war on homelessness,"" but a methodical approach to do away with a major social problem. Each day, roughly 700,000 people in the country are homeless. About 120,000 are chronically homeless. They often live on the streets for years and have mental disabilities, addiction problems and life-threatening diseases like heart disease, cancer and diabetes. They are also five times more likely than ordinary Americans to have suffered a traumatic brain injury, which may have precipitated their homelessness. Without direct assistance, many will remain homeless for the rest of their lives - at enormous cost to society and themselves.Against this backdrop, the 100,000 Homes Campaign has set the goal of placing 100,000 chronically homeless people - pinpointing those who face the greatest risk of dying on the streets -  into permanent supportive housing by July 2013. It's the human welfare equivalent of NASA's race to put a man on the moon. Whether the goal is achieved or not, the campaign is shifting the way cities address a problem that has often been seen as more of a nuisance than a public health emergency."

2010-12-20T21:00:16Z,"One hundred and fifty years ago today South Carolina declared its independence from the United States. The move had been in the offing since early November, when Abraham Lincoln's election led the state's leaders to fear that Washington would begin to restrict slavery in the territories and in their own state. That was the proximate cause, at least; there was more to it. Beyond the election, South Carolina was no longer happy in a union with the free states, where northern opponents of slavery were allowed to openly denounce the ""peculiar institution"" in Congress and in their home states."

2010-12-20T14:26:39Z,"For 10 days this month, a group of enterprising young women converted a carriage house in Los Angeles's Echo Park neighborhood into a larder that they called the Cantry. They christened themselves the Pantlers - after the name given to the servant in charge of the bread and the pantry of a great house - built shelves and lined them with an assortment of canned and pickled goods, tinctures and creams, and drawings and zines. Small jars containing tea lights and flowers were tied to bicycle wheels suspended from the ceiling, becoming clever D.I.Y. chandeliers to light the long refectory-style table made by a woodworker friend. Through word of mouth and Facebook posts, people came to trade and barter their own wares for ginger beer, pomegranate jelly, bacon-infused bourbon, pie fillings and sundry items. A neighbor even offered to trade music for goods. Every night a guest chef cooked a family-style dinner while D.J. friends spun tunes and recipes were shared. The Pantlers are all makers, ""obsessed with food, gardening and doing things for themselves,"" and had talked about sharing their kitchen, home lab and garden experiments for over a year before opening the Cantry. If you missed the Pantlers in Echo Park, visit their online trading post and watch for news of the next pop-up larder."

2010-12-20T00:00:00Z,"7:30 P.M. (HBO) THE SPECIAL RELATIONSHIP (2010) HBO presents back-to-back-to-back encores of its three Golden Globe-nominated films, starting with the screenwriter Peter Morgan's examination of what Winston Churchill called the ''special relationship'': the political, diplomatic, cultural and historical alliance between Britain and the United States, and between their leaders. Churchill had Franklin D. Roosevelt; Harold Macmillan had John F. Kennedy; Margaret Thatcher had Ronald Reagan. And, for a while, Tony Blair had Bill Clinton, which is the relationship at the heart of this third installment in Mr. Morgan's trilogy about Mr. Blair. Michael Sheen reprises his role as Mr. Blair, whom he portrayed in ''The Deal'' and ''The Queen''; Dennis Quaid, above right with Mr. Sheen, is Mr. Clinton; Hope Davis is Hillary Clinton; and Helen McCrory is Cherie Blair. Writing in The New York Times, Alessandra Stanley called the performances by Mr. Quaid and Mr. Sheen ''dazzling'' and said that Ms. Davis ''all but steals the film.'' The movie ''provides a captivating peek into the meshing of personality and power and how easily even the strong bonds come unglued,'' she wrote. ''Or, as one British political adviser warns in the film, 'All political friendship is strategic and conditional.' '' 6 P.M.

The effect would be familiar to anyone accustomed to watching basketball on television who is sitting in good seats in an arena: a sudden appreciation for the physical size of the players on the court. The biggest story on Friday, of course, was LeBron James's first visit to Madison Square Garden since he signed with the Heat. But Friday also marked the first N.B.A. game that could be watched at home in 3-D, and the N.B.A. and ESPN, which have been experimenting with 3-D production for four years, were hoping that it would help drive wider adoption of a technology that has yet to truly catch on."

Professor Schmertz was appointed a charter member of the Faculty of Law in 1969 and appointed to the Law School's first endowed chair, the Edward F. Carlough Distinguished Professorship of Labor Law, in 1981. The following year he was appointed Dean of Hofstra Law School. During his seven-year tenure he established many distinguished professorships. His notable public-service record included senior labor relations appointments by Governors Rockefeller, Cuomo and Spitzer, Mayor Dinkins and President George H.W. Bush. Professor Schmertz gave generously of his time and talent to Hofstra over several decades, influencing the lives of colleagues and students at the Law School and the University through his leadership of presidential conferences on Dwight D. Eisenhower, Ronald Reagan and William J. Clinton, as well as cultural studies conferences on Frank Sinatra and Babe Ruth. In recognition of his distinguished service, in 1993 Hofstra University established the Eric J. Schmertz Distinguished Professorship in Public Law and Public Service, and in 2007, conferred upon Professor Schmertz an honorary Doctor of Laws degree. He will be remembered by the Hofstra community as an inspirational teacher and leader, skillful mediator and cherished friend. We extend our deepest sympathy to his family. He will be greatly missed.

The $90 million film, which will be made on location in Nanjing, formerly Nanking, is set during the Japanese occupation of China before World War II; its producers hope that the historical sweep and Western star will help promote China's cultural footprint abroad.

All the Denisovans have left behind are a broken finger bone and a wisdom tooth in a Siberian cave.

The street, in the St. John's Wood district of northwest London, was designated a Grade II listed site by the British Department for Culture, Media and Sport, meaning that it cannot be altered without the approval of the local authorities.

In some respects, it might come to define USA Hockey's presence in the American sporting landscape.The World U20 (Junior) Championship started in 1977 in Czechoslovakia. The host cities of Zvolen and Banska Bystrica were considered small -- appropriate sites for the inaugural event. The next year the tournament went to Quebec and games were played primarily in Q.M.J.H.L. cities like Chicoutimi, Hull, Cornwall and Quebec City. A few games were played in Montreal but the event's profile didn't get a huge boost across Canada because the gold-medal game featured the Soviet Union and Sweden (the former winning, 5-2)."

I found a rickshaw wallah who dresses like Santa. I asked him why. ""It seems to make people happy,"" he said. I tracked down the Santa of the ""Radio City Christmas Spectacular"" - a Kentucky native, it turns out - in his dressing room at the music hall, where he's been reporting to work for 24 years. Of course, I went to the prime preserve, at Macy's Santaland. There, I found a 4-year-old girl curled up on Santa's lap and thought of Edmund Gwenn's portrayal of Kris Kringle in ""Miracle on 34th Street."" It dawned on me that everyone I'd seen was the real Santa, because Santa is whomever we want him to be."

2010-12-24T00:00:00Z,"The Los Angeles County Museum of Art said on Thursday that it had completed an agreement with the City of Los Angeles that puts the museum in charge of efforts to repair and preserve the Watts Towers, the cathedral-like spires and crockery-encrusted forms built by the self-taught artist Simon Rodia in his spare time over more than three decades. The towers, which were once almost demolished by the city and then later designated a national landmark, were damaged slightly in the 1994 earthquake and again during a 2008 windstorm. The museum, with $150,000 supplied by the city's department of cultural affairs, will collaborate with other art institutions and with community groups in the Watts neighborhood to assess the site's condition and make a plan for repairs and conservation. The hope is that the effort will lead to greater philanthropic attention and a source of long-term financing to maintain the towers, two of which soar more than 90 feet and have become symbols of Los Angeles's cultural history."

The centerpiece, which features a smiling sea nymph holding aloft a sweetmeat stand in the form of a shell, is part of the Swan Service, a dinner service for 100 commissioned in 1737 by Count Heinrich von Bruehl, a leading figure in the court of Saxony. In 1920, the von Bruehl family put 25 pieces of the service, including the ''Nereid Sweetmeat Stand,'' on permanent loan to the Dresden Museum. During the war the pieces were hidden at a castle called Reichstaedt, outside Dresden; at the war's conclusion, the boxes were found broken open and the Nereid stand and several other pieces were missing."

2010-12-24T00:00:00Z,"8 P.M. (TCM) THE BISHOP'S WIFE (1947) On a night of Christmas classics, Henry Brougham (David Niven), an Episcopal bishop, prays for help in raising money to build a new cathedral and receives guidance in the form of Dudley, a dapper angel played by Cary Grant. Soon enough, Brougham starts to wonder if maybe Dudley isn't out to replace him -- both at work and in the affections of his family. And that includes his wife (Loretta Young, above, with Grant). The evening begins at 6 with ''Scrooge'' (1970), starring Albert Finney in the title role and Alec Guiness as Marley's ghost. In ''Make Way for Tomorrow'' (1937), at 10 p.m., Victor Moore and Beulah Bondi portray an elderly couple who are forced to live separately, each with a different child, after they lose their home to foreclosure. In ''Remember the Night'' (1940), at midnight, Fred MacMurray plays an assistant district attorney who takes a beautiful shoplifter (Barbara Stanwyck) home with him for the holidays. Judy Garland sings ''Have Yourself a Merry Little Christmas'' in ''Meet Me in St. Louis'' (1944), about a close-knit family swept up in the excitement of the impending 1904 World's Fair, at 2 a.m. And in ''Bell, Book and Candle'' (1958), at 4, James Stewart plays a publisher who falls under the spell of a bookstore owner (Kim Novak) on Christmas Eve. 4:10 P.M. (Cinemax) CRAZY HEART (2009) Jeff Bridges, in his Oscar-winning role, stars as Bad Blake, an aging country singer with a wayward streak, and Maggie Gyllenhaal is Jean Craddock, the small-town reporter in whom Bad finds inspiration, in this tale of second chances, written and directed by Scott Cooper. ''Some of Mr. Bridges's peers may have burned more intensely in their prime, but very few American actors over the past 35 years have flickered and smoldered with such craft and resilience,'' A. O. Scott wrote in The New York Times. ''Neither blandly likable nor operatically emotional, this actor has a sly kind of charisma and a casual intelligence.'' The film ''owes an obvious debt to'' Bruce Beresford's 1983 drama ''Tender Mercies,'' Mr. Scott added, ''but there can never be too many songs about drinking, loving and feeling bad, and there is always room for another version of that old song about the guy who messed it all up and kept on going. Especially when that guy can play the tune as truly and as well as Mr. Bridges.''"

The decision stems from a legal dispute that began in 2006 when the gallery Haunch of Venison imported to Britain from the United States six disassembled video installations by Mr. Viola, and prepared to import a light sculpture by Mr. Flavin. The gallery sought to declare the works as art, which is subject to a 5 percent value-added tax, significantly less than the standard rate, which in Britain will be 20 percent as of Jan. 1.

I'd tell you the worst Christmas gift I ever got, but I don't, to this day, know what it was. It was a secret Santa gift from someone at a company I do consulting work for. I can't describe it. It was something like a plastic, brown mushroom/toadstool thing, with things glued on it, in a box with clear plastic over it. I really don't know. I showed it to a friend of mine, an older gentleman who was fond of collecting interesting objects, and he asked me if he could have it. Not because it was worth anything, but because it was the oddest, most inexplicable object he ever saw, and he wanted it as a conversation piece (or as he called it, a corpus delicti). I gave it to him. Someday, scientists will discover the Higgs boson at the Large Hadron Collider. It will look like this thing, but much smaller.- Tom Neile"

On Thursday, Goldman Sachs disclosed in a regulatory filing that it had adopted just such a brake proposal. The filing says that, if the government is forced to bail Goldman out, most of the firm's outstanding compensation awards ''shall immediately terminate.''

But a certain other show has been generating more news and attention than any Broadway production in many years; even if the ''Daisy'' folks put wires on Ms. Redgrave and sent her flying above the audience, it still would've been hard to break through the press coverage over at the Foxwoods Theater this week. (Anyway, Ms. Redgrave flies just fine with her feet on the ground, thank you.) But attention must be paid: The producers of ''Daisy'' have recouped their $2.6 million investment in less than nine and a half weeks, a very quick pace, making it one of only 30 percent or so of Broadway shows that earn a profit each year. The production of the Alfred Uhry play, directed by David Esbjornson, opened to generally strong reviews on Oct. 25 and recently extended its run on Broadway through April 9; its three stars are staying in the show. This is the first Broadway run of ''Driving Miss Daisy,'' which ran Off Broadway from 1987 to 1990, won the Pulitzer Prize in drama in 1988 and was turned into a 1989 film."

The mighty, beloved Cowboys, who will no doubt be 11-3, facing the scrappy Cardinals, who will probably be around 8-6 and scoring 42 points per game. Surely Tony Romo will throw for four touchdowns, and we can cut away to luxury-box images of his lovely girlfriend, Candice Crawford, cheering him on in a fetching Santa hat. Heck, Kurt Warner will probably come out of retirement to save the Cardinals by October. Crawford did receive an engagement ring from Romo this week, but it's the only ring anyone involved with the Cowboys is likely to see for a while. And the Cardinals are stuck with the rookie quarterback John Skelton, whom announcers sometimes compare to Ben Roethlisberger, because both are tall.

2010-12-25T00:00:00Z,"A New York film production company has sued its former president, claiming that ''gross lapses in judgment'' cost the company millions of dollars in lost revenue and a producer credit on the movie ''Black Swan,'' Reuters reported on Thursday. The defendant, Aaron Kaufman, called the claims baseless. ''Black Swan,'' starring Natalie Portman, is considered an Oscar favorite and has been nominated for four Golden Globe awards. In a lawsuit filed in Manhattan federal court, the production company, Overnight L.L.C., led by Rick Schwartz, accuses Mr. Kaufman of misrepresenting his skill and experience and pretending ''to be knowledgeable about the financing of motion pictures when he was not.'' Mr. Schwartz, who was credited as an executive producer on ''Black Swan,'' has helped produce the movies ''Machete,'' ''Gangs of New York,'' ''The Aviator'' and ''The Others.'' Mr. Kaufman said it was only after he joined the company and helped secure a role in the production of ''Machete'' and ''Black Swan'' that Mr. Schwartz was able to produce any films."

They were there to toast Steve Tyrell, the singer who took over when Bobby Short died in 2005.

This is not a favorite topic, needless to say, but it sprang naturally to mind because our seats at the Bernard B. Jacobs Theater were directly underneath a stuffed horse suspended upside-down from the ceiling. The horse was an atmospheric accent in the riot of bric-a-brac blanketing the stage, the proscenium and the auditorium of the theater, designed to put the audience in the proper frame of mind for Alex Timbers and Michael Friedman's acerbic musical essay on current affairs, ingeniously disguised as a history lesson. The set, by Donyale Werle, doesn't stop decorously at the edge of the stage, where that fourth wall is supposed to be. Instead vintage paintings and chandeliers and piles of antique-looking gewgaws crawl up and around the sides of the theater. It is as if the entire contents of a Brooklyn flea market had been scooped up and flung around. (Some of the decorations actually were gathered at Brooklyn flea markets.)"

The South Korean violinist Min-Jin Kym was eating at a sandwich shop outside Euston Station on Nov. 29 when she noticed that her black violin case - which contained a Stradivarius and two valuable bows - was missing, according to the police. The violin, made in 1696, is one of about 400 made by Stradivarius that are still known to exist. The police arrested and charged John Maughan, 26, and two teenagers on Wednesday. The names of the youths, 16 and 14 years old, were not included in news reports because of British law. Mr. Maughan is in custody and the two teenagers are free on bail. The instrument has not yet been recovered and an insurance company has offered a reward for information. Ms. Kym, who is 32, began playing the violin at 6, made her international debut with the Berlin Symphony Orchestra when she was 13 and has performed with other leading orchestras.

(Showtime) NINE (2009) Daniel Day-Lewis, above, plays Guido Contini, a director with a creative block and way too many women, in Rob Marshall's adaptation of the musical, first staged in 1982 and revived in 2003, with songs by Maury Yeston and a screenplay by Michael Tolkin and Anthony Minghella. ''Occasionally a flicker of genuine style emerges from all this busy, gaudy fuss,'' A. O. Scott wrote in The New York Times. ''Mr. Day-Lewis does not overdo the Italian-ness, and the sardonic smile playing around his mouth may be a sign of what he thinks of it all,'' while Marion Cotillard ''attains a measure of wounded dignity as Louisa, Guido's former leading lady and much-betrayed wife.'' He added: ''None of the rest of Guido's ladies are so lucky. It must be said that 'Nine' is an impressive feat of casting, with a shocking number of Oscar winners and nominees assembled in the service of its dubious and incoherent cause.'' Among them: Judi Dench as Guido's costume designer and confidante; Penélope Cruz as his married mistress; Nicole Kidman as a Nordic actress; Sophia Loren as Guido's mother; Kate Hudson as a Vogue reporter; and Stacy Ferguson, a k a Fergie of the Black Eyed Peas, as a prostitute.

Robert Duvall and Sissy Spacek play Brad's divorced parents; Mary Steenburgen and Jon Voight are Kate's. Writing in The New York Times, A. O.

The two men, both business-school professors, had already written about an idea they called strategic intent, which held that a company's aspirations mattered at least as much as its resources. The history of business, they pointed out, was in large part a history of Davids knocking off Goliaths, as Microsoft did to I.B.M., Wal-Mart did to Sears and Toyota did to Detroit. Their new theory added a twist. Not only was size overrated, but the combination of two companies that sold similar products -- then in vogue -- was overrated, too. Apple and Dell might both be computer companies, but they would make terrible partners because their expertise -- design in one case, logistics in the other -- differed so much. Companies instead tended to thrive when they focused on what they knew best, Hamel and Prahalad wrote. They called their idea ''core competence.''"

2010-12-26T00:00:00Z,"IN THE LATE 1980S, if you were lying in bed one weekend morning, reading an article dedicated to the best rock 'n' roll albums of all time, toward the back, long past ''Born to Run,'' ''Highway 61 Revisited'' and ''Exile on Main Street,'' there were quieter masterpieces, maybe even one that a fairly dedicated participant in the age of record shops had never heard of, like Kate and Anna McGarrigle's self-titled 1976 debut. Part of the pleasure of hurrying off to buy and then play it was the special frisson that comes with listening to a great album that you sense a relatively small number of people know about; it feels more yours. This is especially true when the music is as intimate and vulnerable as the five songs Kate wrote for that album. She was not yet 30 when ''Kate and Anna McGarrigle'' was produced, but she described the stages of an unhappy marriage so vividly that they took on transcendent qualities; she seemed somehow to be thinking back across an entire life she had still to live. McGarrigle was making music out of her own youthful disappointments. In 1969, after studying engineering at McGill University, she left her home in Montreal for New York City to become, says her sister Anna, ''the character she wanted to be.'' She, Anna and a third sister, Jane, had spent most of their childhood in what Kate's son, Rufus Wainwright, calls ''a very odd, out of the way place'' -- the Quebec mountain village of St. Sauveur. Raised by older parents and schooled in choral masses by French Catholic nuns, Kate had a yesteryear quality even in girlhood. She learned traditional American ''heart songs'' out of a book she found around the house and taught herself to play banjo by plucking along with Appalachian string-band records. Displaced persons who left Europe after World War II also lived in St. Sauveur, some of them bohemians wearing berets, others with concentration-camp tattoos on their arms, and Anna says that because of them, Kate developed an outsider's sense that the heat of life was happening elsewhere. ''She saw herself as one of those people who had to move on, to get out,'' Anna says."

The ones who did that are looking pretty smart right now, because there are even more new ideas to try in 2011. Probably the most important accomplishment for Web-resistant designers was to recognize that their customers talk to one another online; they want girlfriend advice and they want designers to listen. As a result, many more designers this year began using Facebook and Twitter. Customers also want more access to a designer's world, and they want to be able to do that through their cellphones and tablets.

2010-12-26T00:00:00Z,"''Hands down, he's the greatest modern-day caricaturist and one of the great artists of the last half-century,'' wrote Michael Kimmelman in The Times after David Levine died almost a year ago. And it's true: he was. As wonderful (and occasionally brutal) as his caricatures were, however, painting was David's truest passion. In 1958 he founded the Painting Group with the artist Aaron Shikler, and for more than 50 years it met every Wednesday evening to work from a live model. For the last 35 years, I was a member of the group. Watching David work was a revelation. He handled watercolors unlike anybody else. He liked to experiment and, as he put it, ''play.'' He would draw, redraw, ''schmeer,'' sponge out and paint again. It was not uncommon to see him rub out a work we'd been marveling over, saying, simply, ''I didn't get what I was going after.'' Three years ago, Levine's eyesight began to fade rapidly. He lost his ability to see the model, to draw those beautifully crosshatched caricatures for The New York Review of Books, to spend summer days painting the bathers at Coney Island. ''I always knew I was a degenerate,'' he said, ''but I didn't know it was macular.'' He still came to class every Wednesday and sat among us talking about Degas, Sargent and Daumier. After giving a precise critique, he always offered encouragement. ''Keep playing,'' he'd say."

He attended the United States Military Academy at West Point and New York University, where he was awarded his BS degree in 1939 and received his MBA in 1940. He was cited for academic excellence, having graduated second in his class. It was at NYU that he met his future wife who also received her MBA. He was particularly proud of his service during WWII, having served in the Army Engineer Corps in the European theater from 1942 to 1946. He landed with the first wave on Utah Beach during the Normandy Invasion on D-Day, and fought in the Battle of the Bulge. He was awarded, among other medals, the Legion of Merit, two Conspicuous Service Crosses, two Bronze Stars and Bronze Arrowheads. He retired from the army as a Lt. Colonel. In 1947, while teaching at NYU's business school, now known as the Stern School of Business, he founded Centre Lumber & Plywood Co., a distributor of hardwood plywood serving the millwork industry. He was President of the company for almost 60 years, continuing to be active in the business through his mid 80's. He was supportive of a number of charitable organizations, but was particularly devoted to various veterans groups. He was an avid golfer and an active member of Glen Head CC where he served as president, Delaire CC and Glen Oaks Club. He was also a member of the Friars Club. He loved travel, museums, chess, reading and drawing. He was everyone's favorite companion at cocktails, dinner and sporting events of all kinds. He was truly grateful for everyday of his life, and was devoted to his family, friends and country. He will be sorely missed. In addition to his wife, Rhoda, he is survived by his daughters, Elizabeth R. Davidson and Susan L. Robbins, sons-in-law William C. Davidson and Jonathan L. Koslow and grandchildren, Lauren, Stephen and Allison. He was interred with military honors following a private service on Long Island. Expressions of sympathy in his memory may be made to a veterans' organization of your choice."

2010-12-26T00:00:00Z,"9 P.M. (13, 49) FRAMED The eccentric residents of an offbeat Welsh village discover that the National Gallery in London is storing its art collection, including priceless Leonardos, Raphaels and Donatellos, in a nearby mine while the museum is renovated, leading to some strange encounters between a local schoolteacher (Eve Myles) and a forlorn curator (Trevor Eve). He thinks of art in terms of composition, genre and genius; she believes that art is nothing without people to appreciate it -- and perhaps have their lives changed in the process. David Tennant hosts this ''Masterpiece Contemporary'' production based on the children's novel about art, life and Ninja Turtles by Frank Cottrell Boyce. 10 A.M. (ABC) THIS WEEK WITH CHRISTIANE AMANPOURIn a tribute to members of the United States military and their families, Bob Woodruff looks at the growing number of veterans who find themselves homeless after returning from Iraq and Afghanistan.

And David Rohde, a reporter for The New York Times, and his wife, Kristen Mulvihill, discuss their new book, ''A Rope and a Prayer,'' which traces the couple's ordeal after Mr. Rohde was kidnapped in November 2008 by members of the Taliban in Afghanistan and held hostage for seven months before escaping."

2010-12-26T00:00:00Z,"THE WORLD COULD be so cockaludicrous, so full of snools and dickspeakers. Everybody was losing their gynergy. For Mary Daly, this was the biggest problem. She didn't blame men individually for the woes of modern life -- violence, pollution, inequity -- but collectively, institutionally, they were at fault. She held their power against them. She had names for what she was fighting. ''Phallocracy, penocracy, jockocracy, cockocracy -- call it whatever,'' Daly said. In 1987, with a co-author, she published her own dictionary -- seventh in a line of nine books she wrote -- meant to spell out a new lexicon for women, a more precise way of articulating both her rage and her vision for a world in which women shook themselves free of all forms of patriarchy. Anyone who didn't bother to question male dominance was a snool; anyone who promoted it, a dickspeaker. If you were a man, you stood little chance of winning over Mary Daly."

2010-12-26T00:00:00Z,"THEY WERE A COUPLE of Tennessee boys -- one from Nashville, one from Memphis -- who surfaced within a year of each other, and before they were done, they affected the lives of just about anyone who has given a whit about pop music since the mid-'60s. One built his audience with a clear-and-hold (some would say catch-and-release) musical strategy that spanned decades and musical incarnations. The other did it with exactly one song. Bobby Hebb was the singer and composer of ''Sunny.'' One of the all-time summer top-down spins, it raced up the charts in 1966 even as it had no precise musical destination. It was too jazz to be pop, too pop to be soul, too soul to be country, too country to be rock, too rock to be jazz and back round again. It was one of those rare songs that by serving no one musical god, served them all. And its back story was almost as compelling as the song itself."

2010-12-26T00:00:00Z,"IN 1956, VISITING the Cedar Tavern in Greenwich Village with the specific purpose of meeting Jackson Pollock, a 26-year-old Elizabeth Taylor look-alike witnessed the entrance of the artistic genius, by then 44 and bloated with booze, and marveled at ''an electric current'' that ''seemed to float through the dingy bar.'' She called him there a week later (it was his home away from home) and arranged a meeting. An ardent love affair began. At its height, he took her to his house on Long Island and told her he wanted to live with her and leave his wife, the artist Lee Krasner. Meanwhile, he was drinking prodigiously and dissolving frequently into pools of sentimental self-loathing. She felt she had the power to rescue him, but she was wrong. The story ended violently on a fateful summer night, when the great painter, sodden with gin, gunned the accelerator of his car, veered off the road and smashed into a tree. They were both thrown from the automobile. He died. She survived. But for the young woman, Ruth Kligman, that story never really ended. Her supporting role in the death of Pollock would define the remaining half century of her life. ''Death Car Girl,'' the poet Frank O'Hara indelibly called her. Other sobriquets were even less flattering. ''Miss Grand Concourse,'' sneered the painter Franz Kline, who had a brief affair with her after the accident. Only a year after Pollock's death, Willem de Kooning began a tempestuous four-year relationship with Kligman. ''She really puts lead in my pencil,'' he said. He named a brightly colored painting with especially sensuous brushwork ''Ruth's Zowie,'' because ''Zowie!'' is what she exclaimed upon seeing it for the first time. The artists' friends remarked that even after Pollock's death, de Kooning was continuing the rivalry."

2010-12-26T00:00:00Z,"THE FOX BEGAN lurking outside Lucille Clifton's home when the poet was in her 50s. It sat on the lawn, its red coat and lush tail illuminated by a porch light. Though she knew it was harmless, the animal frightened her, Clifton's friend and fellow poet Anne Caston remembered. ''Lucille would kind of crouch behind me as we went up to her door,'' Caston said. ''Or she would call me. She would be checking out her window and say, 'Anne, that fox is out there, sitting in my yard, staring at my door -- what do you think she wants?' '' Clifton, whose lean poetry won an abundance of honors, among them the National Book Award and a Frost Medal, is best known for writing compressed anthems about race and womanhood. The African-American daughter of parents whose classroom education ended in elementary school, she wrote many poems that can be traced back to a moment of extreme surrender. As a child in Buffalo, she watched her mother, a self-taught poet, burn the verses she wrote after Clifton's father, a steelworker, forbade her to publish them. ''The smell of that burning paper always stayed with me,'' Clifton told her youngest child, Alexia. And in her 1993 poem''fury,'' Clifton wrote: ''remember this./she is standing by/the furnace . . . ./her hand is clutching/a sheaf of papers . . . ./her eyes are animals./each hank of her hair/is a serpent's obedient/wife.'' Clifton's mother's verses were formal; Clifton's own poetry, which she began publishing in 1969, was spirited and fierce and sculptured to feel raw. In it, she elicited pride and paid tribute: to Malcolm X and the Native-American warrior Crazy Horse, to deltas of menstrual blood and to the seductive powers of a woman's ample hips."

2010-12-26T00:00:00Z,"AS SOON AS HIS head hit the gym wall, Allan Tibbels knew his arms and legs would never work again. He was 26 -- a bearded, rangy, Christian youth worker with passions for rock music, pickup basketball and tales of religious sacrifice. Avid about whatever he pursued, Eagle Scouts or drugs, he was busted in high school for smoking weed but never doubted that Jesus loved him. He liked the troubled youth of suburban Baltimore, having been one, and they liked him. In his biblical readings, he was focused on Job, which may have steadied him for the trials he would face as a quadriplegic. Uncapping the toothpaste was such an advance that his wife, Susan, would mark the event in the family scrapbook. In the months after his freak accident (he tripped driving to the basket), Tibbels wasn't immune to despair -- just determined to push past it. ''Breaking my neck is God's will for my life,'' he wrote from the hospital. He bought a wheelchair and returned to youth work, from a home with lots of ramps. A few years later, Tibbels startled Susan by insisting they move to the ghetto. Along with his friend Mark Gornik, he had been reading John M. Perkins, an evangelist and civil rights worker in Mississippi who urged the privileged to live with the poor. Christ came down from heaven; Jesus was no commuter! Susan was once the Ivory soap girl of the Christian youth set, destined for suburban contentment. She understood the theory -- God dwells among the poor -- but she had two young daughters, a disabled husband and a terror of rats. She followed under howling protest, to a neighborhood called Sandtown. Baltimore's crack-addled streets in the mid-1980s were as mean as any, and there was hardly another white person for miles. Those who did not assume Tibbels was a cop thought he was buying drugs. When a robber held a knife to his throat, he invited him to church."

2010-12-26T00:00:00Z,"LUDWIG WITTGENSTEIN once said that in philosophy, it is hard to work as slowly as you should. When the British philosopher Philippa Foot finally published ''Natural Goodness,'' her first and only book-length statement of her thinking, at age 80 in 2001, an editor at Oxford University Press recalled Wittgenstein's challenge. ''Well,'' he said, ''that is a problem that Philippa seems to have solved.'' Foot's philosophical voyage, her ''painfully slow journey,'' as she put it, was long in part because it was uphill. Though born into a family of privilege -- her father was a wealthy British industrialist, her mother a daughter of the U.S. president Grover Cleveland -- she was given no formal education (''I was extremely ignorant,'' she later said) and, being a woman, was not expected to go to college. Spurred on, however, by a governess who recognized her intelligence, Foot educated herself via correspondence courses and eventually attended Somerville College at Oxford. There, in the clubby, masculine atmosphere of high British learning, she cultivated friendships with a group of young female philosophers, among them Elizabeth Anscombe, who would become a prized student and editor of Wittgenstein's, and Iris Murdoch, the future novelist. (Philippa would marry one of Murdoch's former boyfriends, the historian M.R.D. Foot.)"
2010-12-26T00:00:00Z,"WITH ALL THE terrible images we have accumulated of Afghanistan -- killing and drugs and corruption and cruelty to women -- most people might wonder why the country cast such a spell on generations of travelers, adventurers, aid workers and seekers. When asked to explain themselves back home, these enchanted wanderers usually stutter something inadequate like ''Oh, the mountains'' or ''The people, they're so hospitable and proud.'' And as their friends and families listen skeptically, they will be busy devising a way to go back. Karen Woo was one of them, a young English doctor who went to Afghanistan in 2009 to visit her boyfriend, who was working there. They broke up; but Karen was smitten by the Afghans. In the week she was there, she visited a charity for street children and toured hospitals. She was appalled by the desperate need and wanted to help."

2010-12-26T00:00:00Z,"ACCORDING TO THE going wisdom, the hordes of teenage boys (myself among them) who made the mid-'60s TV series ''I Spy'' such a success were drawn, first and foremost, by the groundbreaking biracial casting. We tuned in to watch the young Bill Cosby banter with his white counterpart, Robert Culp, while the two of them, spies disguised as a tennis pro and his trainer, cracked cases in exotic locales. The going wisdom is not wrong, but goes only so far. Cosby brought a hip new black persona into the white wasteland of '60s TV; the trade-off was that he had to assume the mantle of an Eagle Scout. A Rhodes scholar and master of languages, his character, Alexander Scott, was also a teetotaler, and when the beautiful girls showed up in the hotel room he shared with Kelly Robinson (Culp), he typically made a quick exit. (''You don't mind my going out and leaving you alone with Tia?'') The show was clear about how the spoils were to be divided. While Culp complimented Cosby on ''the wonderfulness of your mind,'' Cosby's rejoinder to Culp was a homage to ''the wonderfulness of your charm.'' Culp's ''charm'' was something peculiar to the mid-'60s, and the dirty little secret of teenage white boys like myself was that, progressivism and Cosby's wit aside, we really watched the show because of what Culp had to teach us about how masculinity was changing. The movies of the mid-'60s oversaw the rise of a number of not very good-looking, and previously barely noticed, supporting actors -- Lee Marvin and James Coburn prominent among them. It was their non-Eagle Scout attitude, combined with an air of sexual entitlement, that made them stars in an age being resculptured by the combined forces of Johnny Carson, Hugh Hefner, James Bond and the new sexual freedom made possible by the availability of the pill. No one could ever call Robert Culp bad-looking, but his looks had an off-centeredness perfect for the time. He was a more louche Robert Redford, with a dash of the smarmy, ''Of course you'll go to bed with me'' attitude of the singer Jack Jones. That loucheness, that smarm were qualities boys wanted in male stars in 1965. When Frank Sinatra and Rock Hudson played playboys in the '50s and early '60s, there was always a catch: Debbie Reynolds or Doris Day waiting to corral them to the altar."

2010-12-26T00:00:00Z,"BORN INTO A FAMILY of regal thespians, the youngest of three children, she was the tall, chubby, slightly awkward girl who loved her nanny and her chestnut pony, Rosalinda. Lynn Redgrave may never have been quite the hapless ugly duckling she would play in the era-defining 1966 movie ''Georgy Girl,'' but she was a lonely, sickly child, forever afraid of her ''perfectionist'' father, Sir Michael Redgrave (who failed to note her birth in his long diary entry for March 8, 1943), and dazzled by her good-looking and self-possessed siblings, Vanessa and Corin. In one of the childhood games they played together, Lynn recalled in her memoir-cum-diet-book, ''This Is Living,'' Vanessa was president of the United States, Corin was prime minister of England and Lynn had to make do with impersonating the royal dog. Named for the actress Lynn Fontanne, Redgrave was exposed to the excitement of the theater as a child, taking in the works of Shakespeare as performed by her parents in revolving repertory. Despite her habitual shyness and bad posture -- and despite receiving little parental encouragement -- she conceived the idea of following in her parents' and siblings' footsteps while still in her teens after seeing Peter Hall's production of ''Twelfth Night'' no less than 17 times. ''Shakespeare's immaculate play of mistaken identity transformed me,'' she wrote. ''I thought if I could only step into that magic world for a few hours a day, become someone else, take on her looks, her voice, her thoughts, her passions, then I could not only become a great actress. I could also escape from me, the me that I couldn't abide. I could be a butterfly, emerging from my caterpillar's cocoon.''"

2010-12-26T00:00:00Z,"BY 1982, conservatives emboldened by Ronald Reagan's election were looking to drive ideological dissenters from the Republican ranks. Their top target was Lowell P. Weicker Jr., the blustery Connecticut senator who was an acid critic of Reagan and his vice president, George H. W. Bush. (The normally charitable Reagan referred to Weicker, in his diaries, as a ''pompous, no good fathead.'') A group of Washington consultants went searching for a candidate who might take on Weicker in a primary, someone who could both raise cash and symbolize loyalty to the new administration. They settled on the perfect man: Prescott Bush Jr., the vice president's older brother. Those close to Pres Bush never would have pegged him for a politician, or at least not beyond the Greenwich scene where he dabbled for years. He preceded George to Yale, but the lack of vision in one eye -- a birth defect -- kept him from excelling on the ball field or fighting overseas as his brother did, and Pres didn't seem to have the same swagger or ambition. You would think these differences would have given rise to some resentment at watching his younger brother soar into national politics while Pres did quiet and respectable work as an insurance man. But if Pres lugged around any of that baggage, he kept it hidden. He seemed, instead, to revel in family, spending off-hours with his wife and three children and working tirelessly for his brother George, whom he adored, and his father, whose Senate campaigns Pres helped run in the 1950s."

He was 81 and actively practiced law until his death. Born in England in 1929, Mr. Littman was evacuated with his mother and siblings to New York during World War II. After graduating from public high school, he returned to England to take his BA with first class honors from University College, University of London in 1949. Mr. Littman studied law at Harvard, where he met his wife Caroline. In April of 1951 they were married and the next year he graduated cum laude from Harvard Law School. Hired by Pillsbury, Madison & Sutro of San Francisco, he practiced with the firm for 42 years, leading his own litigation group. He tried many cases for motion picture companies, International Harvester, Potlatch Corporation, United Parcel Service and others. He was also special trial counsel to the California State Board of Accountancy and the chief trial counsel for the Federal Home Loan Bank Board of San Francisco in its investigation of what later became the Lincoln Savings & Loan Corporation/ Charles Keating scandal. Mr. Littman joined BartkoZankel as counsel in 2002 where he worked in major commercial litigation, including a leading California court decision against Price Waterhouse that confirmed the right of all parties to a jury trial regardless of pre-dispute waivers. An expert in litigation involving accountants, Mr. Littman recently published the book The Fraud Triangle, detailing the century-long breaches by auditors of their public trust to detect and expose fraud that played a key role in the nation's recent financial crisis. Active in community affairs and professional associations, Mr. Littman was a Trustee of the Bancroft Library, a key fundraiser for the building of the Belvedere-Tiburon library, and a Fellow of the American College of Trial Lawyers.

I expected him to be fuming, because it was the second time my being captured had exacerbated the already complex challenges he faced. For the previous 14 years, the boisterous and at times overbearing legend of American diplomacy had been ribbing me for complicating the Dayton peace talks to end the war in Bosnia. I was a hostage then too. Now it had happened in South Asia, an even more complex place to wrest peace than the Balkans. Back in 1995, Holbrooke browbeat President Slobodan Milosevic of Serbia into releasing me after Serbian forces arrested me at a mass grave I discovered near the town of Srebrenica, site of the massacre of 8,000 Bosnian Muslims. My editors and family later regaled me with stories of how Holbrooke and his wife, the journalist Kati Marton, rattled Serbian officials during the peace talks. In one meeting, Holbrooke picked up the Bosnian Serb vice president's wool plaid fedora and intimidated him. ''Maybe I can hold your hat hostage,'' Holbrooke said. He told Milosevic that the peace talks would be halted until my release. Days later, I was freed."

For Jimmy Dean, it was the constant suck of poverty that drove him to become one of the first multihyphenates, a popular entertainer who put his name on a product so successful that it eclipsed his earlier accomplishments. Until his death in front of the television on his 225-acre Virginia estate, the high-school dropout worried that he could end up back on the farm in Plainview, Tex., where he wore shirts made out of sugar sacks. His mother ran a barbershop out of their home to make money. Every fall he and his grandfather made sausage in a washtub from one of their hogs and put it in jars so they could have meat in winter. As he told Esquire, ''When I was a kid, I thought, Man, if I could ever afford all the ice cream I want to eat, that's as rich as I want to be.''"

In an e-mail, Kabir Chibber, a contributor to the Travel section, including ''36 Hours in Rajasthan'' (Nov. 22, 2009), agreed. Mr. Chibber suggested staying in Delhi for two or three days to take in sites like the 17th-century Red Fort and Jama Masjid mosque (above) in Old Delhi.

2010-12-26T00:00:00Z,"GOLDBERG--Leslie Daniel, of North Salem, NY passed away on December 22, 2010 after a sudden illness. He was 67 years old. Les is survived by his daughter Elizabeth DeRose and her husband Christopher of Ann Arbor, MI; his son Andrew Goldberg and his wife Kim of New York, NY; his grandchildren, Madeline and Evan DeRose and Alexa and Benjamin Goldberg; and his sister Gloria Shaffer and her husband Richard of New York, NY. Les was born in New York, NY on January 28, 1943 as the youngest child of Mauri and Edythe Goldberg. He graduated from New York University in 1964, and was a proud member of Phi Sigma Delta fraternity where he made many life-long friends. Les began his career at WVOX Radio in New Rochelle, NY in 1964. He transitioned into the radio advertising rep industry at Peggy Stone and Associates later that year. He then worked for McGavren-Guild Radio starting in 1968 and became manager of the Detroit office. In 1974 Les was promoted to Executive Vice President to lead McGavren-Guild's West coast office in Los Angeles. In 1986 Les was named President and COO of Interep Radio in New York, parent company of McGavren-Guild Radio. Les was a pillar of the radio advertising community and had a successful career that spanned nearly four decades. He served as a board member to many organizations, including: The Radio Advertising Bureau, The National Association of Broadcasters, The Southern California Broadcasters Association, The Broadcasters Foundation and The Bayliss Foundation. He was also a Past Chairman of the Radio Mercury Awards. Les retired from the McGavren-Guild/Interep family in 2005. While many in the radio advertising industry will recall Les as a passionate, dedicated and principled leader, he will be better remembered as a wonderful friend and mentor, and in particular a devoted father, grandfather, brother and uncle. His passion for Native American art led him to become a strong supporter of Native American museums and foundations. His friendly and upbeat personality and wonderful sense of humor will be greatly missed. A memorial service is being planned for late January. Donations in Les' honor can be made to either The Hopi Foundation (www.hopifoundation.org) or The Broadcasters Foundation (www.broadcastersfoundation.org)."
2010-12-26T00:00:00Z,"FIXES Historically, homeless people had to be deemed ''housing ready'' -- typically drug- and alcohol-free -- before they could become eligible for permanent housing. In reality, this screened out most of the chronically homeless. In the early 1990s, a group called Pathways to Housing pioneered an approach called ''housing first'' that showed that permanent housing was, in fact, the first thing people needed to stabilize their lives. Today, it has been adopted as government policy. But even as a solution to chronic homelessness is within sight, housing agencies, and other groups, need to change the way they work to implement it. Even when housing is available, public systems remain slow, complicated and confusing, and disconnected from the streets. They don't focus on the neediest people."

(49) GENIUS WITHIN: THE INNER LIFE OF GLENN GOULD ''Even to his most passionate admirers the phenomenally gifted if wildly unconventional pianist Glenn Gould, above, was a tangle of personal tics and complexes,'' Anthony Tommasini wrote in The New York Times. ''Sometimes he seemed a provocateur bent on riling the public with extreme interpretations and odd behavior. Other times he came across as a fragile, fearful man, at ease only when making music.'' This ''American Masters'' presentation of the documentary by Peter Raymont and Michèle Hozer ''shows the sad progression of a brilliant, garrulous musician with a fiercely original artistic vision as he becomes increasingly obsessive and isolated,'' Mr. Tommasini said of Gould (1932-1982), who made his New York City concert debut in 1955, earned renown for his interpretations of Bach and, by 1964, had abandoned live performances in favor of the recording studio.

His greatest passion was for horticulture, producing breath-taking flower gardens and prolific vegetable gardens. Friends brought ailing plants of all kinds to Jim, who would nurture them back to health.

Opponents like the Panthers and the Seahawks were not able to capitalize; when a team is trailing, 34-10, a few 20-yard runs aren't much good. The Saints are ill-equipped to exploit the Falcons' weakness. Pierre Thomas and Reggie Bush are healthy, joining Chris Ivory to give Sean Payton so many rushing options that the only fair thing to do is abandon the run completely so no one can complain about his carries. That's a slight exaggeration, but Payton can never call for an off-tackle run when the fake-double-reverse screen to Bush is available. Pick: FalconsMIKE TANIER"

The Japanese company had asked the British designers Edward Barber and Jay Osgerby, of the firm BarberOsgerby, to create an exhibition to showcase its Monolithic Design concept, in which its home entertainment products are seamlessly integrated into interior design.

This manifesto carries over to the bar, which is adjacent to the restaurant in a restored antebellum structure and boasts a killer bourbon list.

Janet was an accomplished and dynamic woman who dedicated her life to the causes she believed in. She was a Board Member of the 92nd St. Y for over 50 years, and a Board Member of Young Audiences Inc., Children's Orchestra Society, City Meals-on-Wheels, and The New Milford Hospital Foundation.

She created beautiful dried flower arrangements and gave them as gifts to her friends.

2010-12-29T00:00:00Z,"BARNETT--Elizabeth P. The Board of Trustees of the Edna St. Vincent Millay Society mourns the passing of Elizabeth P. Barnett, the poet's literary executor and a Board trustee, who died peacefully in Eugene, OR on December 26, 2010. Born in Hackensack, NJ in 1924, Barnett grew up in Rhinebeck, NY, where she attended Rhinebeck High School before continuing her studies at The College of William and Mary in Williamsburg, VA. An aspiring actress, Barnett moved to New York to attend the American Academy of Dramatic Arts. While living in Manhattan, she and her husband Richard, a writer, met another young actor, Roscoe Lee Browne, through their mutual friendship with the singer Mabel Mercer. In 1952, two years after Millay's death at Steepletop, the poet's country home in Austerlitz, NY, Barnett, her husband, and Browne visited the site and met Millay's sister Norma, then the poet's literary executor, and her husband, Charles Ellis. That meeting resulted in lifelong friendship and literary partnership between Barnett and Norma Millay. Known for her deep love for the arts, meticulous attention to detail, and elegant writing style, Barnett worked as an editor at Houghton Mifflin in Boston for many years before devoting her time to Millay Society initiatives, primarily the preservation of the house and grounds at Steepletop. After Norma's death in 1986, Barnett served as literary executor and lectured at schools and other venues about the poet's life and work. She is survived by her daughter Vincent Barnett of Eugene, OR, her first husband Klaus Kolmar, and a devoted staff and Board of Trustees of the Millay Society. A memorial service for Elizabeth Barnett will be held at Steepletop in the spring. In accordance with her wishes, in lieu of flowers, memorial contributions may be made to the Edna St. Vincent Millay Society, Steepletop, Box #"

In this edition of ''Tavis Smiley Reports,'' Mr. Dudamel talks about his career as the youngest conductor of a major orchestra; his quest to provide music education for American children; and El Sistema, the publicly financed program in Venezuela that he credits with changing his life by instilling a passion for music at a very young age -- and by keeping him out of trouble. Mr. Smiley also interviews José Abreu, the founder of El Sistema, and four graduates of the Abreu Fellows Program at the New England Conservatory in Boston, which provides tuition-free training for postgraduate musicians committed to helping develop El Sistema programs in the United States and abroad.

In the original Broadway production of ''Arcadia,'' which shuttles in time between the 19th century and the present, Mr. Crudup played Septimus Hodge, a tutor and friend of Lord Byron. In the revival, which is headed for the Ethel Barrymore Theater, Mr. Crudup will play Bernard Nightingale, a modern-day professor investigating Byron's life. Press representatives for the Broadway revival of ''Arcadia'' said on Wednesday that its cast would also feature Raul Esparza (''Speed-the-Plow'') as Valentine Coverly, a graduate student involved with Nightingale's investigation, and Lia Williams (''Skylight'') as Hannah Jarvis, an author pursuing her own research. The British actor Tom Riley (''Lost in Austen'') inherits the role of Septimus Hodge. Other cast members will include Margaret Colin (as Lady Croom), Glenn Fleshler (Captain Brice), Grace Gummer (Chloe Coverly), Edward James Hyland (Jellaby), Byron Jennings (Richard Noakes), Bel Powley (Thomasina Coverly), Noah Robbins (Gus Coverly/Augustus Coverly) and David Turner (Ezra Chater)."

I picked up a set of these goodies for about $13, and the package included six tips-two small size, two medium, two large. I can't say that replacing the rubber tips on my Monster Beats Tour model earbuds with the medium Comply tips changed my life.

The mask, which dates from the 16th century and is thought to have been worn by the king of Benin on ceremonial occasions, is the last known example of its type in private hands and was expected to fetch as much as $7 million. It was one of several items scheduled to be sold in February at Sotheby's in London by the descendants of Lt. Col. Sir Henry Gallwey, a vice consul of a British protectorate in Nigeria who took part in the 1897 invasion of Benin when the British deposed the king and burned and looted the city.

Gwyneth Paltrow (above with Mr. Phoenix) is Michelle, a sophisticated, slightly unstable beauty newly arrived in Leonard's apartment building, where she is being kept by a married lawyer (Elias Koteas). And Vinessa Shaw is Sandra, the daughter of an important business associate of Leonard's father and an advantageous catch. But how can Leonard ever choose? Reviewing the film in The New York Times A. O. Scott said that this story from the director James Gray ''is modest in scale, but the feelings that run through it are large and intense.'' In the end ''the flaws in 'Two Lovers' are inseparable from its strengths,'' he added.

We extend our deepest sympathy to his wife Susan and his children, Lauren, Daniel and Thomas, to whom he was a devoted and loving husband and father. Gary passed away peacefully in his sleep on December 22 at the age of 53, after a long illness. Widely recognized for his expertise in products liability litigation, an area in which he focused almost exclusively for more than two decades, Gary was head of the firm's products liability practice, as well as a member of Chadbourne's Management Committee. Gary played a pivotal role in some of the most noteworthy and complex products cases ever tried in U.S. courts. He was well known throughout the legal community for his longtime representation of British American Tobacco Company and other clients in landmark litigation, both in the United States and abroad. Gary joined Chadbourne as an associate in 1987 and was elected partner in 1994. Those of us who worked closely with Gary, primarily at our offices in New York and London, knew him as a remarkably gifted lawyer, a man of boundless energy, good humor, and impeccable integrity, a patient and generous mentor, and always a warm and responsive friend. Notwithstanding his dedication to his clients, the focus of Gary's life was his wife and children. He took great pride in their many accomplishments. An avid sportsman, Gary will be fondly remembered for his wit and charm, the gift of his company, and his abiding passion for literature. We will miss the warmth of his friendship, the benefit of his sharp intellect, and his grace and humility. Friends may call at Leo P. Gallagher Funeral Home, 31 Arch Street, Greenwich, Connecticut on Sunday, January 2 from 3pm to 8pm. A Mass of Christian Burial will be held at St. Michael's Catholic Church, 469 North Street, Greenwich, Connecticut on Monday, January 3 at 10am.

2010-12-31T00:00:00Z,"The reasons for voting for one player for Hall of Fame induction over another are as varied as the 500-plus writers, statisticians and bloggers who vote for the Hall of Fame. Generally, a player's candidacy comes down to how a voter views the player's career record and contribution to the teams he played for. These are, not coincidentally, the areas that sabermetrics (the analytical study of baseball) is most focused on. Since I'm interested in baseball statistics and how player performance affects team win-loss totals, I lean strongly toward an analytical take on who should be in the Hall of Fame. Voters have long favored traditional benchmarks like 500 home runs and 300 wins, but as our knowledge of how player performance relates to a team's success has grown, we now see the limitations of those statistics. This is why I prefer to use Wins Above Replacement, a statistic that isolates each player's contributions to the team."

But on Sunday, The Associated Press reported, North Korean television audiences were given a rare break from this routine when the British comedy ''Bend It Like Beckham'' was shown there. The film, which stars Parminder Nagra as a young woman from a Sikh family with dreams of soccer stardom; Keira Knightley as her best friend; and Jonathan Rhys Meyers as the dreamy coach they both have eyes on, was shown over the weekend by the arrangement of the British Embassy. According to the BBC, a message was shown during the film saying that the broadcast was done to mark the 10th anniversary of diplomatic ties between North Korea and Britain. In a message on his Twitter account, Martin Uden, the British ambassador to South Korea, wrote: ''Happy Christmas in Pyongyang. On 26/12 Bend it like Beckham was 1st ever western-made film to air on TV.'' The A.P. said the North Korean broadcast of the two-hour movie was only an hour long, so please, no spoilers about the film's subplots about religion and sexuality, or which of the women Mr. Rhys Meyers character ultimately chooses."

First, the economy has to grow around 2 1/2 percent per year just to keep unemployment from rising. Second, growth above that level leads to a less than one-for-one fall in unemployment (because hours per worker rise, more people enter the work force, etc.).

2011-01-01T00:00:00Z,"Michael Cohl, the lead producer of the Broadway musical ''Spider-Man: Turn Off the Dark,'' formally announced in a statement on Thursday that the actress Natalie Mendoza was leaving the show. Ms. Mendoza, who portrayed the mythical spider-woman Arachne in the musical, suffered a concussion in the show's first preview performance in November and had not appeared in it since Dec. 20, when a co-star, Christopher Tierney, was injured in a mid-performance accident. Word of Ms. Mendoza's exit surfaced earlier this week, but neither she nor Mr. Cohl nor the ''Spider-Man'' director, Julie Taymor, had commented on it at the time. The statement issued Thursday characterized Ms. Mendoza's departure from the musical as the actress's decision. Ms. Mendoza was quoted as saying: ''It has been a difficult decision to make, but I regret that I am unable to continue on 'Spider-Man' as I recover from my injury. I wish Julie and the cast and crew every success with this production.'' Ms. Taymor said: ''Natalie is a talented performer. We've appreciated her contributions to the show and we wish her all the best.''"
2011-01-01T00:00:00Z,"The writer Charles Bock made a great many literary friendships during the years while he struggled to complete his first novel, ''Beautiful Children.'' When Mr. Bock's wife, Diana Colbert, was discovered to have leukemia and underwent a bone marrow transplant in the fall of 2009, many of those friends pitched in to offer household help. In October, Ms. Colbert's leukemia returned (she is scheduled for another transplant next month), and three of the Bocks' friends, the novelists Fiona Maazel and Mary-Beth Hughes and the writer Leigh Newman, decided they needed to help even more. ''We said everything that can be done, should be done,'' Ms. Maazel recalled. So on Feb. 6th, at P.S. 122 in the East Village, the Bock friends are throwing what they're calling ''the most literary rent party ever.'' Some 18 writers will be on hand, including Susan Cheever, Jonathan Franzen, Richard Price and Mary Gaitskill, and many of them will be auctioning off their services. Amy Hempel will walk your dog, Ms. Maazel explained over the phone. Rick Moody will write a song for you. And Gary Shteyngart will ''buy you a hot dog and flatter the pants off you.'' The Cleaver Co., a caterer, is providing its services at a discount; P.S. 122 is donating its space; and the Brooklyn Brewery is contributing free beer. John Wesley Harding, among others, will perform, and Ms. Maazel said there might some booths where for, say, a dollar a minute one could obtain literary advice."

''Michael Jackson's Autopsy: What Really Killed Michael Jackson'' was scheduled to be shown in several countries in Europe, though not the United States, on Jan. 13. Jackson fans around the world last month began circulating a petition demanding cancellation the broadcast, which was being promoted with an advertisement showing a sequined glove, one of Jackson's trademarks, alongside a body draped in a sheet. On Wednesday, the co-executors of the Jackson estate wrote to Discovery to say the program was ''in shockingly bad taste'' and cited ''common sense and decency'' in urging the program be pulled from the air."

2011-01-02T00:00:00Z,"Lyon, France's second largest city, is stepping out of Paris's shadow and looking toward the future with the creation of an entirely new district called Confluence, after the two rivers -- the Saône and the Rhône -- that border it. The area's gleaming new buildings are rising on a stretch of barren industrial land once home to slaughterhouses and the city's two prisons. While an art museum and a shopping mall are scheduled to open in 2011, the area is already a showcase of modern architecture, cutting-edge art and international cuisine. PLACE NAUTIQUE This huge inner harbor development brings the Saone River into the heart of the new district. Bordered by ultra-modern apartment buildings and the new Parc de Saone, Place Nautique, opened in June, is an idyllic place for a stroll and provides a stopping-off point for pleasure boats."

2011-01-02T00:00:00Z,"Only YSL can make vintage as good as new. After the success of not one but two environmentally feel-good capsule collections, New Vintage, initiated by YSL's creative director, Stefano Pilati, and Julie Gilhart, is having another go. New Vintage III's moxie is quite simple: reclaim, recycle and sustain. ''The collection is materially comprised of garments made from recycled fabric and from existing patterns instead of new ones, to start a dialogue with the market using known codes and a common language that are reassuring and familiar,'' says Pilati about the 180 pieces that will be available this week. Metallic wide leg trousers, velvet tuxedo suiting jackets and leopard-print wrap dresses with a hint of disco pay a refreshing nod to Saint Laurent's iconic 1970s designs. You'll have a second chance to finally own that missed ready-to-wear piece, and no doubt appreciate the brand's intelligent use and reuse of its existing resources. Pilati adds, ''New Vintage is meant to be part of a process, a general attempt to give a sensibility and an education to our public so that it can act consciously toward its environment.'' Today, progressive cultural shifts in consumption and sensibility seem more modern than ever."

Sam Baron -- the French designer who is the creative director of Fabrica, the design-research arm of the retailer Benetton, which publishes Colors -- is the issue's guest editor. (Colors was founded by Tibor Kalman and Oliviero Toscani in 1991.)

He was there from 1943 to 1945, not from 1945 to 1947. (The O.S.S. was dissolved in 1945.) The obituary also rendered incorrectly the surname of an American diplomat who accompanied Mr. Bessac on his journey across China. He was Douglas S. Mackiernan, not MacKiernan. (This error also appeared at least half a dozen times in articles in 1950 -- the year Mr. Mackiernan was killed while on that journey -- and once in 1954.)"
2011-01-02T00:00:00Z,"KAGAN--Roderick H.,died peacefully on December 14, 2010, in Sun Valley, Idaho, after a brief illness. Rod was born on March 25, 1940, in South Orange, NJ. He grew up in Short Hills and graduated from Bernardsville High School. Rod moved to Chocolate Gulch just north of Ketchum/Sun Valley in 1975. Here he designed and built his octagon-shaped home, workshop and studio, which are now surrounded by his awe-inspiring sculpture garden. Today the Idaho columns soar 25 feet above his home while the 14-foot North Fork columns stand sentinel in front. These monumental steel columns are complemented by Rod's works in bronzetotems, benches, chairs, reclining and standing ladies, tri-points, wall sculptures and a series of bronzes that Rod numbered for each year of his age. Rod used a most personal and unusual process to create his sculptures. He did not make drawings or maquettes for casting by a foundry. After he conceived each work in his mind, he worked directly with the metal. He would sketch his designs on the metal surfaces, then cut and bend the shapes and weld the pieces together to complete his sculptures. Rod's sculptures are in private collections and public spaces throughout the United States and abroad. A collection of his sculptures is in the Boise Art Museum sculpture garden, and three totems grace the corner of Eighth and Idaho streets in Boise. In addition, an 8-foot Hanukkah menorah is at the Wilshire Boulevard Temple in Los Angeles. In 1990 Rod was an honored recipient of the Idaho Governor's Award for Excellence in the Arts; in 1984 he received a National Endowment for the Arts fellowship grant; and in 1983 he participated in the Art From Idaho exhibition at the Smithsonian's National Museum of American Art. Rod was the devoted son of the late Alfred Blanchard Kagan and Marie Hill Kagan of Jupiter, Fla. He is survived by his brother Alfred B. Kagan Jr. (Tim) and Tim's, wife, Sally, of Easton, Md., and his brother Peter H. Kagan (Pete) of Ennis, Mont., Pete's son, Andrew Kagan (Andy) and Andy's wife, Rebecca (Beckie), and Andy and Beckie's son, Wesley Kagan of Westcliffe, Colo. All are grateful to Rod's many friends for their love and support, in particular to Julie Firestone, Monica Scully and everyone at the Wood River Hospice for their care and caring. Rod was a most kind and gentle man who, when not in his shop or studio, loved to be with his friends hiking in the Sawtooths, skiing on Baldy and fishing in the Big Wood River. Rod not only created his sculptures, but also established lasting relationships and a living legacy. A memorial service will be held at a future date. Donations may be made in Rod's memory to the Hospice of the Wood River Valley, Box 4320, Ketchum, ID 83340 or to the charity of your choice."

Twenty inches of snow fell in Central Park, and some suburbs got as much as 32 inches. BEHIND THE NEWS Officials in some areas, including New York City, seemed to be caught unprepared for the storm's ferocity. Travel by air, rail or road was severely disrupted, with service shut down and passengers stranded for hours in stalled trains, packed terminals and stuck vehicles as crews struggled to cope with the snow."

Swimsuit bodices and fishtail hems made their customary, um, splash on the red carpet in 2010, in an awards season that elicited as many titters as thrills. This year's ubiquitous sea creature silhouette -- Lypsinka channeling Rita Hayworth -- suggests that the stars, and their stylists, were mired in some campy vision of Hollywood's last Golden Age. But steeped in nostalgia or not, the red carpet processions still are among fashion's chief spectator sports, the style world's equivalent of the Super Bowl providing the stars with this year's most dazzling photo opportunities. Small wonder then that the savviest nominees and presenters missed no chance to play to the camera, dressed in photo-ready marvels of construction that were refreshingly free of frills."

But in the case of ''Black Swan,'' in which Natalie Portman plays an ambition-maddened dancer, that chestnut bears some truth. Darren Aronofsky's Grand Guignol of a film both reflects -- and anticipates -- a trend in the making, its multilayered tutus, feathers and cobwebby knits attesting to a shift in the fashion wind. The kinky costumes in ''Black Swan'' were the brainchild of the costume designer Amy Westcott, working with Kate and Laura Mulleavy of Rodarte, a label known for its fusion of chastity and chills. The Mulleavy sisters, celebrated for their raw (and often goth-inflected) fabric treatments, conceived a look for Ms. Portman's dancer in the dark that echoes the movie's alternating moods of innocence and iniquity."

Whether it was directing the prosecution of war criminals under General Douglas MacArthur (including that of General Yamashita Tomoyuki, The Tiger of Malaya), negotiating complex international shipping agreements on behalf of Mobil Oil, or testifying before the United States Congress on international trade issues, Chet's attention to detail and professionalism consistently permitted him to persevere and prosper. During his 35-year career with Mobil, he held many positions, including as a director and vice president of Mobil Oil Corporation, executive vice president of its International Division, president of its Worldwide Marketing and Refining Division, and president of its Marine Transportation and Marine Sales Division. His international experience included work in Europe, The Middle East, South Africa, the Philippines, Singapore, and Japan, which bestowed upon him the Order of the Sacred Treasure. After his retirement, he continued to consult in the international business arena and in 2001 published ""Principles of Negotiation - A Primer for Intercultural Strategies"". A graduate of Drexel University, Chet is a member of The Drexel 100, the university's hall of fame of alumni chosen for their lifetime achievements. He also was a lifetime honorary member of the Japan Society, as well as a member of the American Bureau of Shipping. Chet is survived by his beautiful wife, Kathleen, to whom he was married and devoted himself for over sixty years, her daughter, Dale Raggio (Nevada State Senator William J. Raggio), her grandson, David Everett Joffick, of Sydney, Australia and her great-grandsons, Thomas Joffick and Harrison Joffick, of Sydney, Australia. Over 20 years ago, Chet and Kathy founded the Checket Cup, which quickly became and remains a popular stop on the USTA's Les Grande Dames Women's Tennis Tour. The 2011 event will be held at The Tennis Club in Fort Lauderdale during the first week of February where, at 5:00pm on February 3rd, there will be a Celebration of Life honoring Chet for his contributions to women's tennis and to the world around him.

Mr. Milliken lived by ideas and principles from which he never wavered. He believed that America's manufacturing leadership was the foundation of his nation's economic achievement. His personal examples of uncompromising integrity, of hard work in any just cause, and an inexhaustible passion for excellence shone in his every undertaking. His beliefs were his commitments, whether to life-long education, to quality, to innovation, or as demonstrated in his absolute commitment to the health and safety of all of his associates. He was an unabashed patriot and an ardent Conservative. He trusted in the ability and wisdom of people acting of their own accord. His devotion to country, to community, to his associates and to his family were fully in harmony with the beliefs that guided his life. In his love of trees he found joy and beauty, and through them he expressed his commitment to the future. They were nature's gift to him, which he in turn gave to his fellow citizens. Even in the last years of his long and fruitful life, he continued to plant more trees, knowing well that they would not attain their full, noble majesty for the span of yet another very long human lifetime. Roger Milliken became President of Milliken & Company in 1947, and served as its Chairman until his death. Roger Milliken was born October 24, 1915 and was a graduate of Groton School and Yale University. He was married to the late Justine Van Rensselaer Hooper. They are survived by five children, Jan, Nancy, Roger, David and Weston and nine grandchildren."

2011-01-02T00:00:00Z,"KEATING--Gerald Maurice, 74, of Yorktown, VA, died Saturday, November 27, 2010. He is survived by his companion of many years, Nancy McBride Hogg. Gerald is also survived by his cousin Page Davis Ikard of Connecticut and by former wife Jean C. Keating of Williamsburg, VA. Gerald was a world expert on planetary atmospheres. He studied the Aeronomy of planetary atmospheres generally at altitudes above 100km where escape of the planetary atmosphere begins to occur. His experiments have been flown to Venus (Pioneer Venus and Magellan), Mars (Mars Global Surveyor, Mars Odyssey, and Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter), and Earth (Explorers 9, 19, 24, and 39). For Earth, he discovered the Winter Helium Bulge and the Cooling of the Thermosphere due to increases in CO2. At Venus, he discovered a cryosphere in the upper atmosphere and also detected the super-rotation of the upper atmosphere. In the upper atmosphere of Mars he discovered a winter polar warming of the thermosphere, determined exospheric temperatures regulating escape of the planetary atmosphere, mapped the thermosphere as a function of local solar time, latitude, season, and solar activity, detected enormous increases in the thermospheric density caused by dust storms and discovered planetary scale waves that cause variation in thermospheric density by a factor of two. He and his colleagues showed the first compelling evidence of the response of the Earth's ozone layer to solar variability. Recently he discovered strong greenhouse cooling in the Earth's thermosphere caused by the global rise of anthropogenic CO2. Some of his last ideas reflected the cooling vs heating of the atmosphere debate. Both are happening in a simultaneous fashion. The outer atmos- phere is cooling and shrinking as a result of CO2 build-up. The Ion layer shrinks and drops, gets thicker, deflects CO2 back to the surface which makes the near-surface atmosphere get thicker and hotter. The outer atmosphere shrinking was important to Gerald because that's where satellites fly. The decrease in density in the outer atmosphere affects satellite orbits. Gerald went directly to work for the National Aeronautics and Space Administration in Hampton, VA after schooling as a Physicist. Bitten by the ""space bug"" in the form of Sputnik 1, there was no other place he wanted to work. At NASA Langley, he received the top NASA award for scientific studies, the Medal for Exceptional Scientific Achievement; the NASA Langley Award for the ""most outstanding paper"" of 1974, the H.J. E. Reid Award; plus a number of other awards for various discoveries. As a teenager, Gerald invented an adaptation to the popcorn machine at Woolworth's that eliminated the ""widows"" (un-popped kernels) from the bags of popcorn sold at that chain. At the beginning of his career, he figured out the orbital mechanics for the first US communications satellite. He said he ""got extra points for doing a 'dogleg' over Moscow to hear what the Russians were saying."" Gerald retired from NASA Langley in 1995. Until his death, he was a Senior Staff Research Scientist at The George Washington University. After retiring from NASA, Gerald took about four months to decide he really could not play golf and he was bored. He chose The George Washington University to continue his search for discoveries. While at GWU, Gerald was Principal Investigator/Team Leader for the accelerometer experiments on MGS, MO and MRO. Gerald was the first author of the Mars Thermosphere Planetary Quarantine Model for the Viking Extended Mission. He developed the thermospheric model for the Venus International Reference Atmosphere. This VIRA model was used for Magellan aerobraking and for Pioneer Venus Operations. He was responsible for generating The International Reference Atmosphere of the Earth's Ozone for COSPAR. COSPAR is the International Committee for Space Research established by the International Council of Scientific Unions. He was Chairman of COSPAR'S Sub-commission on Planetary Atmospheres and Aeronomy and Chairman of COSPAR's Task Group on Reference Atmospheres of Trace Species. He headed the Mars International Reference Atmosphere. His bibliography includes more than 150 publications. Gerald was an adventurer, photographer and dare-devil. For many winters, he went skiing down the black diamond slopes of the Matterhorn, in Switzerland. He liked to tell people he ""had been to over 100 countries and two other planets."" For a month, in the 1960's, he explored and traveled down, by canoe type boat, the Orinoco River, in Venezuela, near where it connects to the Amazon River. Around that time frame, he once, in Peru, bribed (with liquor) a crop duster to fly him over Machu Picchu - an illegal act at the time - so he could look and take pictures. He also, in a similar fashion, got a flight to look at the glyphs in Chile. He took an eye-level (in a bit larger airplane) photo of Mount Everest. One stunt, even he admitted was foolhardy, was taking a picture of a tiger in a zoo in India while being on the same side of the fence as the tiger. In India, Gerald photographed the Taj Mahal, went to Tiger Tops and Lake Dahl. He went on safari in Africa. He got to Mount Kilimanjaro and the Pyramids. He photographed, up close, tree lions in Tanzania and leopards and other lions in Kenya. When he heard the border crossing had been opened in Berlin and Berliners were partying on the wall; he grabbed a flight and joined the party. Gerald walked on the Great Wall in China. One could go on about his adventures. A memorial party will be held on January 8, 2011 from 3pm to 6pm, at the Air and Space Center in Hampton, Virginia."

2011-01-02T00:00:00Z,"8 P.M. (Cinemax) GREENBERG (2010) In what A. O. Scott called Noah Baumbach's ''funniest and saddest movie'' so far, ''and also the riskiest,'' Ben Stiller, above, plays Roger Greenberg, a 40-year-old former musician who, after a mental breakdown, house-sits in the large Los Angeles home of his vacationing brother. Greta Gerwig portrays Florence Marr, Roger's brother's 25-year-old assistant and Roger's on-again, off-again love interest in his quest to recapture his youth. ''Mr. Stiller, suppressing his well-honed sketch comedian's urge to wink at the audience, turns Roger into a walking challenge to the Hollywood axiom that a movie's protagonist must be likable,'' Mr. Scott wrote in his review in The New York Times. ''But Mr. Baumbach, relishing his antihero's obstinate difficulty -- which is less an inability to connect with other people than a stubborn refusal, on hazy grounds of principle, to try -- treats Roger with compassion, even tenderness.'' Only at the end does Mr. Baumbach reveal that the film has been ''a romantic comedy all along,'' Mr. Scott said. ''And suddenly a movie about a man who is defiantly difficult to like becomes very hard not to love.'' 10:30 A.M. (CBS) FACE THE NATION The topic is the new Congress.

In addition, the window shelters the library of my late husband, Jorge Luis Borges. It is a real Library of Babel, full of old books, their endpapers scribbled with notes in his tiny hand. As afternoon progresses and I look up from my work to gaze out this window, I may be invaded by springtime, or if it's summer, by the perfume of jasmine or the scent of orange blossom, mingled with the aroma of leather and book paper, which brought Borges such pleasure."

K2, which is increasingly popular with high school and college students, is little known to anyone older than 25. Its chemical-laced herbs are sold online and in stores as incense ''for aromatherapy and intense meditation,'' as one distributor puts it.

Not everyone agrees. Musical taste is overwhelmingly subjective (a Boy George oldie during pigeon pose is not easily forgiven) and pacing is critical (a hip-hop warm-up is too fast, too soon). And there is nothing inherently wrong with silence - the music of choice for many traditionalists. It helps focus the breath and settle the mind, and some slower-moving forms of yoga, like Iyengar, demand it."

He was so taken with her that he proceeded to call every ""Cane"" in the Westchester phone book until her found her. They were married on August 9, 1940. Janet was an accomplished and dynamic woman who dedicated her life to the causes she believed in. She was a Board Member of the 92nd St. Y for over 50 years, and a Board Member of Young Audiences Inc., Children's Orchestra Society, City Meals-on-Wheels, and The New Milford Hospital Foundation. She established the Janet and Avery Fisher Music Residency program at Goucher College. Janet and Avery were frequently seen at concerts at Lincoln Center. Classical music was a shared passion. She had warm relationships with many of the young musicians who received Avery Fisher Career Grants or the coveted Avery Fisher Prize. Yo-Yo Ma and Emanuel Ax gave private birthday ""concerts"" for her twice, true highlights in her life. Janet loved their Washington, CT home and spent many hours in her gardens. She created beautiful dried flower arrangements and gave them as gifts to her friends. When she was in her seventies, Janet was spotted by a modeling agent as she was bringing an armload of lilacs to her physician. The agent insisted that she was the perfect face for a GAP ad. Janet became the one and only senior citizen to be so featured.

Ohio Elections Commission (1995) the Supreme Court overturned a statute requiring any person who prints a notice or flyer promoting a candidate or an issue to identify the communication's author by name.

Or, in other words, a writing or utterance says what it says independently of who happens to say it; the information conveyed does not vary with the identification of the speaker."

He emigrated to the U.S. in 1944 at age 21 and served as a lieutenant in the U.S. Army in occupied Germany. After discharge, from a job with a small wine importing company, Ab built a remarkable career in fine wines that culminated in the 1970's with his founding of the Chateau & Estate Wines division of Seagram, which became the largest importer of fine French wines in the U.S. During his 29 years at Seagram's Chateau & Estate, he became the dominant figure in the fine wine business on both sides of the Atlantic, and in 1980, the French government awarded him the Legion of Honor medal to recognize his contributions to the French wine industry. He treated others fairly and with respect. His word was his bond, and his agreements with suppliers were sealed by handshakes, not written contracts. He championed many causes in Israel among them the Tel Aviv Foundation and Hebrew University, and was involved with many other charitable activities. Ab's greatest joy was his family, both immediate and extended. Services at The Riverside, 76th Street and Amsterdam Avenue, 11:15am, Tuesday, January 4th."

2011-01-03T00:00:00Z,"8 P.M. (IFC) MONTY PYTHON AND THE HOLY GRAIL (1975) Partly financed by the rock bands Pink Floyd and Led Zeppelin, this movie spoofs the legend of King Arthur (Graham Chapman) and his knights in their quest for the Holy Grail. When it came time to begin shooting, there was not enough money for horses, so coconuts were used to simulate the sound of their hooves. An argument in the first scene over how coconuts could have wound up in medieval England sets the style and logic of the film. The Python troupe members Terry Gilliam (above right, with Chapman) and Terry Jones shared directing duties and played multiple characters, as did the others: John Cleese, Eric Idle, Michael Palin and Chapman. In the original conclusion King Arthur was to have arrived at Harrods, the London department store, where he would have found a large selection of grails at the grail counter. This was ultimately abandoned for a more chaotic ending in which some of the principals are rounded up by modern-day police officers. 8 P.M. (13, 49) ANTIQUES ROADSHOW The 15th-anniversary season premiere takes place in Miami, where a 1960 rerelease movie poster for ''The Wild One'' is appraised and the worth of a Brooklyn Atlantics baseball from 1859 is estimated at $20,000 to $30,000."

The vote, which Republican leaders pledged would occur before the president's State of the Union address later this month, is intended both to appeal to the Tea Party-influenced factions of the House Republican base and to emphasize the muscle of the new party in power. But it could also produce an unintended consequence: a chance for Democrats once again to try their case in support of the health care overhaul before the American public."

Mr. Milliken lived by ideas and principles from which he never wavered. He believed that America's manufacturing leadership was the foundation of his nation's economic achievement. His personal examples of uncompromising integrity, of hard work in any just cause, and an inexhaustible passion for excellence shone in his every undertaking. His beliefs were his commitments, whether to life-long education, to quality, to innovation, or as demonstrated in his absolute commitment to the health and safety of all of his associates. He was an unabashed patriot and an ardent Conservative. He trusted in the ability and wisdom of people acting of their own accord. His devotion to country, to community, to his associates and to his family were fully in harmony with the beliefs that guided his life. In his love of trees he found joy and beauty, and through them he expressed his commitment to the future. They were nature's gift to him, which he in turn gave to his fellow citizens. Even in the last years of his long and fruitful life, he continued to plant more trees, knowing well that they would not attain their full, noble majesty for the span of yet another very long human lifetime. Roger Milliken became President of Milliken & Company in 1947, and served as its Chairman until his death. Roger Milliken was born October 24, 1915 and was a graduate of Groton School and Yale University. He was married to the late Justine Van Rensselaer Hooper.

The deal makes Facebook now worth more than companies like eBay, Yahoo and Time Warner. The stake by Goldman Sachs, considered one of Wall Street's savviest investors, signals the increasing might of Facebook, which has already been bearing down on giants like Google. The new money will give Facebook more firepower to steal away valuable employees, develop new products and possibly pursue acquisitions - all without being a publicly traded company.

In 1984, Mr. Shannon moved from Bernardsville, New Jersey to Atlanta, Georgia with his family to cofound the pioneering Online Financial Corporation with his good friend, the late Jack Wells. The innovative programs written by Mr. Wells and sold by Mr. Shannon are still used in banks in nearly all of the fifty states today. Mr. Shannon never fully retired. After selling his company in 1992, he embarked upon ventures that took him all over the world, in the service of family, neighbor, and God. Mr. Shannon was an ardent believer in education. He acted on Seton Hall University's Board of Regents, during which time he established the Philip and Mary Shannon Foundation, providing multiple student scholarships and presenting the Philip and Mary Shannon Speaker Series in partnership with Seton Hall's School of Diplomacy and International Relations. From 2001 to 2004, the speaker series featured New York Times columnist Thomas Friedman; presidential historians Michael Beschloss, Robert Caro, Doris Kearns Goodwin, and David McCollough, and former president of the Soviet Union and Nobel Prize winner Mikhail S. Gorbachev. Mr. Shannon's favorite pastime was boating with family and friends, most recently in the Florida Keys. A resident of Summerland Key, he was a member of the advisory board of Mote Marine Laboratory and founder of the grassroots, activist planning group, Citizens Not Serfs. This most recent campaign, on which he was working at the time of his death, advocates for the environmental preservation of the Florida Keys.

Born in Russia on May 10, 1921, he and his late mother, Eunice Haiman Lichtenstein Haas, entered the United States in 1925. Raised in Connecticut, Washington State, New York and Philadelphia, Mr. Lawrence was introduced to Orlando in the late 1930s by his mother, who wintered there. Educated at George Washington High School and having served with distinction as a member of the United States Marine Corps. in World War II, Mr. Lawrence became a grower of shade tobacco in the Connecticut River Valley and served as a two-term representative in the Connecticut State Legislature. The novel ""Parrish"", written by his cousin Mildred Savage, was inspired by his life and was the basis for the movie of the same name, for which he served as technical advisor. In 1959, he and his former wife, the late Lois Becker Lawrence Odence, moved to Orlando with their two daughters. Mr. Lawrence invested at that time in the fledging Budget Rent A Car Company. Eventually, a major portion of Budget's corporate structure was moved to Orlando, and Mr. Lawrence, as executive vice president, oversaw its rapid growth into a worldwide corporation. When Budget was sold to Transamerica Corporation, he became an investor and executive with Major Realty, a prominent real estate development concern in Central Florida. A highly proficient hunter and an award-winning trapshooter, Mr. Lawrence was also a superb fly fisherman who owned a home in the Bitterroot Valley of Montana for many years. He was also a familiar figure around the marinas of Singer Island and Chubb Key, where he fished for sailfish with great success. Since 1968, Mr. Lawrence had been certified as an AKC multi-breed judge. He and his wife Marion, whom he married in 1970, were owners of numerous championship dogs, among them most notably the wire-haired fox terrier Lacey, winner of the 1992 Best in Show award at the Westminster Kennel Club Dog Show. Their Pembroke corgi Kevin was awarded first in the herding group at Westminster in 2006. Mr. and Mrs. Lawrence assembled, during their marriage, an outstanding collection of American art. Many of their paintings and sculptures have been shown at Cornell Art Museum at Rollins and at the Museum of Fine Arts in St. Petersburg. The Lawrences have made numerous gifts of art to the Cornell Museum. Other gifts to Rollins include the Samuel B. Lawrence Center and the Ruth duPont Terrace. Mr. Lawrence was named a CHIEF (Champion of Higher Education in Florida) by the presidents of the independent colleges and universities of Florida in 1993 and received an honorary doctor of letters degree from Rollins in 1995. He leaves his beloved wife of forty-one years, Marion Walters Lawrence; his two daughters, Barbara Alfond and her husband Theodore, and Ruth duPont and her husband Thomas; his step-daughters Kathleen Schumann, Debra Deluca and Diane Deluca; seven grandchildren and sixteen great-grandchildren. he, and his family, are very grateful to his loving and devoted caregivers Dorrie (Tiny) Dockrey, and Vitra (Cindy) Ferguson. A memorial service will be held at the Knowles Memorial Chapel at Rollins at 11:30 on Wednesday, January 5th. In lieu of flowers, Contributions in Mr. Lawrence's honor may be made to the Samuel B. Lawrence Memorial Scholarship Fund, c/o President Lewis Duncan, Rollins College, Winter Park, FL 32789."
2011-01-04T00:00:00Z,"NATIONAL An article on Friday about political tensions over the regulation of greenhouse gas emissions by the federal Environmental Protection Agency misstated the amount of carbon dioxide emitted by the nation's energy sector in 2008 and 2009. It was about 5.8 billion metric tons in 2008, not 5,800 metric tons, and it was about 5.4 billion metric tons in 2009, not 5,400 metric tons. The article also misidentified the state in which a federal court declined last week to issue a restraining order blocking the enforcement of new federal emission rules in Texas.

So said Martin Garbus, in a brief phone conversation after a closed-door hearing Monday in the child custody dispute between Mel Gibson and his former girlfriend, Oksana Grigorieva. Mr. Gibson's lawyers had opposed a request by Mr. Garbus, who is from New York, to be allowed to represent Ms. Grigorieva in the Los Angeles County Superior Court case. They cited, among other things, his public remarks about the dispute during a November interview on one of Larry King's final televised interview shows for CNN. On the program, Ms. Grigorieva described how she had recorded Mr. Gibson's obscene rants to her because she feared he might kill her. Mr. Garbus, who appeared with her on the program, had said that Mr. Gibson did not want to pay any support for his daughter with Ms. Grigorieva. Before arguments began on Monday, Judge Marjorie S. Steinberg closed the courtroom to all but the parties and their lawyers. After saying that he was now officially an attorney in the case, Mr. Garbus declined further comment. Blair Berk, a lawyer for Mr. Gibson, also declined to comment. Ms. Grigorieva attended the Monday court session.

2011-01-04T00:00:00Z,"LANGAN--Michael William (Bill) Age 55, died peacefully on December 31 at the Dana-Farber/Brigham & Women's Cancer Center after a courageous battle with leukemia. Just two months ago, Bill was honored with the prestigious Leadership Award by the International Superyacht Society (ISS), recognized by his peers for his outstanding contributions to the standards, prestige and character of the luxury yachting industry. Although he was unable to travel to accept the award in person, he was deeply moved by this tribute. Born in Greenwich, CT on June 9, 1955 to Dr. Michael Joseph and Kathleen Holman Langan, Bill competed in most of the major ocean sailing races around the world. Starting in the sport on Long Island Sound at age 10, he was proud to have participated in 20 consecutive Newport Bermuda Races, his first at age 15, and to eventually serve as the race's Technical Director. Bill graduated from Greenwich High School and Webb Institute with a BS in Naval Architecture and Marine Engineering. Following a student internship at Sparkman & Stephens, the New York-based yacht design and brokerage firm, he joined the design department there in 1978 as Chief Draftsman. Two years later, Olin Stephens named him Chief Designer, the position Olin himself held for 50 years. Bill's early work with S&S included project management of the 12-meter yacht Freedom that won the America's Cup race of 1980. In preparation for the 1987 America's Cup challenge, Bill was chosen as designer for the America II campaign sponsored by the New York Yacht Club. 1987 marked the last time 12-meter yachts would compete in the America's Cup, and with that change Bill decided to concentrate the firm's business on luxury sailing yachts over 75 feet. Over the course of 20 years with S&S, Bill was responsible for over 300 individual designs. In 1994, Bill participated in the expedition, headed by former United States Secretary of the Treasury William Simon, that navigated the icy conditions of the Northwest Passage from Alaska to Greenland. Bill redesigned, refitted and strengthened Simon's yacht, the 175-foot Itasca, to make Simon's dream journey a reality. In 1998, Bill fulfilled his own dream to found Langan Design Associates, Inc. of Newport, Rhode Island, and settled his family in Jamestown. With Bill at the helm, his firm completed over 40 designs, each unique, but all of them timeless in style, with attention to craftsmanship, advanced technology, and seaworthiness. His design vision was well received starting with his first design, the 130-foot ketch Victoria of Strathearn, that won design awards from both ShowBoats International and the ISS. Later designs include Eos, a 305-foot 3-masted schooner, the largest private sailing yacht in the world to date. Bill encouraged his wife to start her own firm, Candace Langan Interior Decoration, specializing in yacht interiors. Their most recent collaboration, Calliope, a 42-meter motor yacht, is featured in the December issue of Yacht International. Bill was a member of Conanicut Yacht Club in Jamestown, New York Yacht Club, and the Storm Trysail Club. He served as Chairman of the Cruising Club of America Technical Committee for over 12 years. Bill was devoted to his family. He is survived by his wife of 30 years, Candace Register Langan, and two children, Tom and Annie of James- town, RI, his parents of Greenwich, CT, six siblings and their spouses: Meg Moore (John) of Reston, VA, Ellen Langan (Steve Krafchick) of Seattle, WA, Katie Langan Santee (Kevin) of Mamaroneck, NY, Betsy Dell (Roger) of Roseville, CA, Bob Langan (Margot) of Portland, OR, and Stephen Langan (Kathy) of Bedford, NH; his mother-in-law Anne Mickle Register of Chestertown, MD, brothers-in-law Croft Register (Pam) and Fred Register (Connie), and sixteen nieces and nephews. A memorial service will be held on Saturday, January 8 at 2pm St. Matthew's Episcopal Church in Jamestown, where Bill and his family are members. Following the church service, there will be a reception at the Conanicut Yacht Club. In lieu of flowers, the family requests that memorial gifts be given in Bill's name to The Jimmy Fund, the Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, 10 Brookline Place West, Brookline, MA 02445-7226, or to The Leukemia & Lymphoma Society, Donor Services, P.O.

He had just celebrated his 75th birthday on December 19th. He was the beloved husband of 52 years of Margot Nelson Carey, his ""first wife"", and the treasured father of Nelson Lorin Carey and his wife Grace of Cape May. Ray was born in Taylor, Pennsylvania, the son of the late James and Pearl Carey. He was the elder brother to Christine (Lou) Zigray, Joseph (Mary Ann) Carey and Jule (George) Steffen, and uncle to cherished nieces and nephews. Ray was an ardent supporter of his alma mater, Lafayette College '57 (Go Leopards!), and was a member of Delta Tau Delta fraternity. After graduation, he served his country in the United States Army and was honorably discharged at the rank of Captain. Ray worked for the Union Carbide Corp. for 36 years, retiring in 1993 as Director of Audits. He held many civic roles in Rutherford, his home for the last 52 years (when he wasn't reading at Normandy Beach, NJ) serving as a member of the Rutherford Borough Council, a board member of Parish Nursing, the first President of the Kipp Center and a dedicated supporter of the YMCA. For over 30 years, he was a board member of the Boiling Springs Savings Bank, retiring as Chairman this year. Ray was a loyal friend and neighbor and was honored to have been chosen as the 2007 recipient of the Lincoln Award by the Republican Club of Rutherford. He was a member of the Boiling Spring Lodge 152 F&AM, Royal Arch Masons, Fortnightly Club and the Upper Montclair Country Club. Ray's leadership of the Everyman's Bible Class and his membership as a parishioner and Elder of the First Presbyterian Church of Rutherford allowed him to express his devotion to God. Despite all of his many achievements, none meant more to Ray than his strong faith and loving family. If he had any disappointments in this life, Ray did not burden others with them, but instead kept striving to persevere and thereby demonstrate his confidence in God's love and protection. Ray's bravery in illness was a life lesson to all and his family will never forget the kindness, compassion and excellence of all of his medical care givers, our ""A"" Team. Donations to Leonia Summer Stage: www.leoniasummerstage.org c/o Dr. Frank D.Livelli, or the First Presbyterian Church of Rutherford Music Fund are appreciated, but a kindness done for one in need would also honor Ray's life. A memorial service is planned for a future date."

The Naked Angels production of ''Next Fall'' had a critically acclaimed run Off Broadway in 2009, then transferred to Broadway the next year. While receiving strong reviews there as well as Tony Award nominations, including for best play, the production was not a commercial success and ran for about five months. Mr. Nauffts said in a statement that he planned to continue to write and direct for Naked Angels, and advise on artistic matters as a board member. Mr. Donald, the founding artistic director of the Charlie B. Theater Company in Los Angeles, said in the statement that he looked forward to bringing new writers and others into the company. Among the company's offerings this season is the world premiere of the play ''A Long and Happy Life,'' by Bekah Brunstetter, and another world premiere, ''Outside People,'' by Zayd Dohrn.

This would have seemed unnecessary in 2010, a century after the author's death. But last year Russians wrestled over Tolstoy much as they did when he was alive. Intellectuals accused the Russian Orthodox Church of blacklisting a national hero. The church accused Tolstoy of helping speed the rise of the Bolsheviks. The melodrama of his last days, when he fled his family estate to take up the life of an ascetic, was revived in all its pulpy detail, like some kind of early-stage reality television."

''What gives this delicate, decorous movie its distinctive throb of melancholy sensuality is less the humdrum possibility of adultery than the intimation of a three-way entanglement involving the man, the woman and Cairo,'' A. O. Scott wrote in The New York Times. ''The film itself is perhaps a bit too cautious, preferring diffidence and indirection to overt emotion,'' he added. Still, ''the time does pass agreeably enough, and if 'Cairo Time' does not amount to much, it does evoke a wistful state of feeling and a complicated city with enough skill and sensitivity that you wish it had dared more.'' In ''Joan Rivers: A Piece of Work'' (2010), at 10, Ricki Stern and Annie Sundberg ''tagged along with their subject, racking up miles and yowzah moments in her relentless pursuit of fame, money, attention, love, kicks, masochistic thrills or whatever it is that makes Ms. Rivers, née Joan Alexandra Molinsky, run,'' Manohla Dargis wrote in The Times. They begin by moving in close to Ms. Rivers's 77-year-old, cosmetically altered face -- without makeup. ''To their credit, the filmmakers don't try to make her look good, and while they omit some of her uglier routines, they don't (perhaps can't) ask you to love her,'' Ms. Dargis said.

2011-01-05T00:00:00Z,"BROOKS--Charlotte Park, an abstract expressionist who painted under the name Charlotte Park, died peacefully on December 26, 2010 at the age of ninety-two at her home in East Hampton, New York. Ms. Park was born August 13, 1918 in Concord, MA. Her father was George Coolidge Park, Sr, who died in 1918 of pneumonia, and her mother was Maybel (nee Hawkes) Park. Her sole sibling was George Park, who predeceased her. In 1939, Ms. Park graduated from the Yale School of Fine Art in New Haven, Connecticut. During World War II, she volunteered at the Department of Federal Public Housing in Washington, DC and then worked for the Office of Strategic Services (OSS), which produced intelligence, analysis, and planning in support of overseas Allied military operations. She met the artist James Brooks through the OSS, and they moved to New York City in 1945 and later married in 1947. After moving to New York, the excitement of the abstract expressionist art scene captivated Ms. Park and Mr. Brooks, and they soon joined the ranks of its leading avant-garde members, while developing close friendships with the movement's pioneers like Jackson Pollock and Lee Krasner. Through their close friendship, Ms. Park and Mr. Brooks rented the front space of Mr. Pollock's old studio at 46 East 8th Street. In 1949, Mr. Brooks and Ms. Park joined the Pollocks and many other artists on Long Island, first in Montauk and then in The Springs, East Hampton. Ms. Park and Mr. Brooks physically moved their house on a barge from Montauk to its present location in The Springs. During the 1950s and early 1960s, Ms. Park took a unique approach to abstract expressionism, painting blocky, curving, or linear shapes with vibrant colors and dynamic brushstrokes. Ms. Park exhibited regularly during the 1950s at the Stable Gallery and Tanager Gallery in New York and was included in the Painting Annual of 1953 at Whitney Museum of American Art. Like many female abstract expressionists, however, curators, critics, and galleries often overlooked her work in favor of male artists, including her husband. The widespread belief that this was primarily a masculine artistic movement perpetuated this disregard. Although Ms. Park believed in Mr. Brooks' work and was happy to take a backseat in order to help his career, a series of recent gallery and museum exhibitions and critical praise is correcting this oversight.

Our cherished Tony was a gentleman, scholar, and the most devoted friend anyone could have. He gave without hesitation in ways that cannot be measured. No matter what, he was ever curious, vibrant, full of humor and eager to embrace life at its fullest. No matter what, he was compassionate, generous, and a lifesaver and buoy to any friend in need. No matter what, he never complained. Instead, he strode forth, with a smile on his face, ready to do good and bring joy. For Tony, every day was an opportunity to learn something new to add to his already impressive and vast store of knowledge. His was the gift of truly listening and selfless caring for others. A virtual one-man Google, one's inbox never stayed empty if he knew you needed to know whatever it was. How lucky were we to have him in our family. How painfully silent it is now that he is gone. We pray that he is at peace. He will forever be missed. All our Love, Catherine, Fred, Christopher and Freddie"

(13) DON PASQUALE A new season of ''Great Performances at the Met'' begins with Otto Schenk's production of Donizetti's comic opera about an aging Don (John Del Carlo) who, frustrated that his nephew Ernesto (Matthew Polenzani) insists on marrying his beloved, the penniless Norina (Anna Netrebko, above), instead of taking a suitable wife, decides to cut off his inheritance by getting married himself. Mariusz Kwiecien plays the duplicitous Dr. Malatesta; James Levine conducts. Reviewing the production in The New York Times in November, Vivien Schweitzer wrote, ''Ms. Netrebko offered a vivid portrait of Norina, her fluid voice lustrous as she navigated the bel canto hurdles in a performance that was both physically energetic and vocally rich.'' Her transition to the vixen ''Sofronia,'' the Don's new wife, Ms. Schweitzer added, ''was complete as she flounced down the stairs in hot-pink tights, tiara and velvet gown, flustering the hapless Don by her sudden metamorphosis from timid to tyrannical.'' 1:30 P.M.

Only one week ago Mr. Tierney left intensive care for Manhattan's Rusk Institute of Rehabilitation Medicine.

Mr. Tierney, 31, is happily working with the producers of ''Spider-Man'' in what politicians refer to as changing the narrative: Finding a way to turn a bad-news story to their advantage, or at least finding a dramatic way to change the subject. In this case, the storyline has shifted from safety concerns at ''Spider-Man'' - how many stagehands does it take to put Peter Parker in a harness? - to the high spiritedness of Mr. Tierney, his refreshing refusal to consider any sort of legal action, and his dream of returning as one of several actors and dancers who play the masked Spider-Man during stunt sequences."

2011-01-05T00:00:00Z,"Can Goldman Sachs, the profit-seeking missile of high finance, really make money by investing $450 million in Facebook, at a vertigo-inducing price that values the social-networking company at $50 billion? On first blush, the answer would appear to be no. After all, in May 2009, the company was valued at $10 billion. Last August, Facebook was valued at $27 billion and now it's $50 billion - for a company with a reported $2 billion in revenue and negligible profits. If General Electric, with 2010 revenue of around $150 billion, traded at a similar multiple of revenue, it would be worth $3.75 trillion instead of $200 billion.

The spy flees the country. The generals resign in disgrace. But in what some here have called the worst espionage scandal in the Czech Republic since 1989, the Rakhardzho affair -- named for Robert Rakhardzho, a wily Russian spy -- appears to contain elements of both fact and fiction. Distinguishing the two is difficult, but the tale includes a subplot involving one of the largest nuclear power deals in Czech history, an intricate web of deceit and a cast of characters that has reached the highest levels of the army and government."

The remainder of the nominees were the expected names: ''The Social Network,''''Inception,''''Black Swan,''''True Grit,'' ''The Kids Are All Right,'' ''The Fighter,'' ''The King's Speech'' and ''Toy Story 3.'' Left off the feature list were indie wild cards like ''Winter's Bone'' and ''Blue Valentine,'' both of which have drawn praise for their performances. (The producers' guild does not nominate actors; its awards go only to the producers of each film.) ''Toy Story 3'' was also nominated as best animated film, alongside ''How to Train Your Dragon'' and ''Despicable Me.'' That there were only three films selected -- as opposed to five last year -- may be a sign; there is already fierce speculation about which animated films will draw favor with the academy, which can nominate up to five in that category but does not always do so. The documentary nominees, announced last month, are: ''Client 9: The Rise and Fall of Eliot Spitzer,'' ''Inside Job,'' ''The Tillman Story,'' ''Waiting for 'Superman,''' ''Earth Made of Glass'' and ''Smash His Camera.''"

2011-01-06T12:33:12Z,"An exhibition of the work of the photographer Ezra Stoller opens today at Yossi Milo Gallery. Stoller, who died in 2004 at age 89, was the foremost chronicler of Modernist architecture, using his large-format camera to record seminal 20th-century works like Mies van der Rohe's Seagram Building, Frank Lloyd Wright's Fallingwater and Guggenheim Museum, and Eero Saarinen's TWA Terminal at Idlewild Airport (now Kennedy). The exhibition of gelatin silver prints includes not just images of these buildings but also of lesser-known midcentury works like the Starkey house in Duluth, Minn., by Marcel Breuer, and the International Style, Skidmore, Owings & Merrill-designed First National City Bank (now Citibank) branch, also at Kennedy - which still stands, albeit in a less pristine landscape than when Stoller trained his deep-focus lens on it. So influential was Stoller's approach, which captured a building's lines in sometimes abstract, often monumental compositions, that a project wasn't considered complete until it had been ""Stollerized."" The exhibition continues through Feb. 12."
