During the early 1980s, Mr. Linton served as the head of the storied investment banking and securities firm that pioneered the use of high yield (or ""junk"") bonds. Robert Linton was born in New York City on May 19, 1925 to Helen and Adolph Lichtenstein, a specialist on the New York Stock Exchange. During his senior year at Phillips Exeter Academy, Linton enlisted in the Army, eventually serving in WWII as a navigator and bombardier and achieving the rank of 2nd lieutenant in the Army Air Force. In 1946, Mr. Linton joined Burnham & Co., a small investment bank as the eighth employee, starting as a runner delivering stock certificates around Wall Street. Hard-working and ambitious, Bob attended night school to earn his stock broker's license and later, his commodities broker's license. Linton worked in virtually every department of the firm, forming the company's Corporate Finance and Commodities departments. By 1976, the firm had become Drexel Burnham Lambert. Mr. Linton was eventually named to head the firm by founder I.W. Burnham II, and in the early 1980s under his leadership, Drexel grew to become the most profitable firm on Wall Street. When Mr. Linton retired, DBL had 10,000 employees in worldwide offices. During his time on Wall Street, Mr. Linton was Vice Chairman of the Board of Governors of the National Association of Securities Dealers (NASD, 1980), a director of the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE, 1983-1987), and served as Chairman of the Securities Industry Association (SIA, 1983). Mr. Linton served two terms as a member of the National Council of Consultants to the Small Business Administration, was an expert witness before the Congressional committees drawing up the SBIC legislation and testified twice before the Senate Banking Committee against the repeal of the Glass-Steagall Act. Linton was a founding member of the American Business Conference, Inc., a coalition of growth companies. Mr. Linton was also an active and longstanding supporter of the social sector, serving as a founding member of the Board of Directors of Lincoln Center Theater from 1984 to 2015 and then as the organization's first Director Emeritus; and as a Director of the Board of the School of American Research, Santa Fe, NM (now known as School for Advanced Research) in the 1990s. In 1987, Linton was appointed Chairman of the Advisory Board of the Sol C. Snider Entrepreneurial Research Center at the Wharton School of the University of Pennsylvania. After retiring from Drexel Burnham Lambert, Mr. Linton partnered with Cy Leslie, founder of Pickwick International to form Leslie Linton Entertainment, an investor in entertainment companies and properties, including Red Sky Entertainment, a creator, developer and marketer of family entertainment properties.

Mr. Linton was eventually named to head the firm by founder I.W. Burnham II, and in the early 1980s under his leadership, Drexel grew to become the most profitable firm on Wall Street. When Mr. Linton retired, DBL had 10,000 employees in worldwide offices.

Born August 6, 1946, in Targoviste, Romania, high school Valedictorian, graduate of the Bucharest Polytechnic Institute, M.E., 1969, worked for many years as Quality Control Engineer designing thermic and nuclear powerplants. She arrived in Michigan in 1991 with her young daughter, to reunite with her political refugee husband and young adult son. She worked as translator for Refugee Services, and later as Project Engineer at General Motors with her husband in the same Engine Design Powertrain group in Flint, Warren, and Pontiac, MI, retiring in 2004. She organized benefit concerts raising thousands of dollars when she heard of deep, unmet needs within the Romanian community. For the building fund of the Dormition Monastery in Rives Junction, MI, Ms. Miron took Mother Benedicta's mission as her own: to build a Romanian Orthodox Monastery on American soil. Later, she heard of the need for waterproof covers to protect the new mattresses donated by a foreign charity to the Tuicani Children's Orphanage.

She was truly loved, and she showed all who knew her what it meant to love: unconditionally, with fervor and passion, with fierceness and loyalty.

2016-05-03T00:00:00Z,"KLEINBERG--Norman Charles, beloved husband of Marcia; devoted father of Lauren and Joanna and father-in-law to their husbands Darren and Daniel; loving grandfather of Margot, Charlotte and Jake; and valued colleague of the partners of Hughes Hubbard & Reed, passed peacefully in his sleep on May 2, 2016. Norman graduated from Tufts University in 1968 and from Columbia Law School in 1972. Following his graduation, Norman clerked for the Honorable Charles M. Metzner, United States District Court for the Southern District of New York, until 1974. He then joined the law firm of Hughes Hubbard & Reed in Manhattan, where he worked until 2012 when his failing health prevented him from continuing. Norman was always in motion. He was an ardent traveler and reveled in planning adventurous journeys with his family. Norman was also an accomplished trial lawyer with many notable trials that led to his selection as a fellow of the American College of Trial Lawyers. He was passionate about his work, devoted to his clients who chose him as their advocate, and loyal to his colleagues, training and inspiring a generation of attorneys at Hughes Hubbard & Reed where he chaired the litigation department. He loved to win, and nearly always did, while always adhering to the highest standards of the profession. Adversaries whom he had bested and judges who had presided over his cases remembered him with fondness and admiration years after their cases with Norman were over. His determination on behalf of his clients inspired those who worked for him to find reserves of stamina, persistence and creativity that they never knew they had. Norman had those qualities in abundance, and a magnificent ability to translate the hard work of the team into a devastating cross- examination or a winning argument to the court or jury. As devoted as he was to his profession, Norman was even more committed to his family, originally the three women in his life, then expanding to include his sons-in-law and grandchildren. Those who worked with Norman remember that even at the end of a long day preparing for trial, he never failed to call home to help with homework assignments or review college applications. And, just a few years ago, following another courtroom win, an Illinois jury was passing around pictures of his first grandchild. His vibrancy and courage live on in our hearts. Services will be held at Frank E. Campbell - The Funeral Chapel at 1076 Madison Avenue on Wednesday, May 4, at 1:30pm. 1/3"

2016-05-04T00:00:00Z,"BLANK--Robert Saler, died peacefully with family by his side on April 30th. A beloved husband, father, grandfather and friend, Bob had a distinguished 45 year career as a senior partner at Whitcom Partners, a company that owned and operated newspapers, magazines, TV and radio stations and cable systems. He had a special love for their newspaper holding Chesapeake Publishing. He graduated from Cornell University in 1962 and obtained his J.D. from the University of Pennsylvania. From 1965-1968 he was an Assistant U.S. Attorney in Philadelphia and Washington, DC. He spent the next three years in the Mergers and Acquisitions Department of Goldman Sachs before joining Whitcom as a partner. He was a director of Toll Brothers, Inc. and a former director of a number of publicly held corporations as well as the privately held International Herald Tribune (now the International New York Times). He was an Emeritus Trustee of the University of Pennsylvania, the Wharton School Board of Overseers, Penn Law Board of Overseers and a Trustee of Penn Medicine. He was the recipient of Penn Law's Distinguished Graduate and Alumni Achievement Award. Bob was born November 28, 1940 in Philadelphia to Ruth Saler Blank and Samuel Allen Blank.

2016-05-04T00:00:00Z,"KLEINBERG--Norman Charles, beloved husband of Marcia; devoted father of Lauren and Joanna and father-in-law to their husbands Darren and Daniel; loving grandfather of Margot, Charlotte and Jake; and valued colleague of the partners of Hughes Hubbard & Reed, passed peacefully in his sleep on May 2, 2016. Norman graduated from Tufts University in 1968 and from Columbia Law School in 1972. Following his graduation, Norman clerked for the Honorable Charles M. Metzner, United States District Court for the Southern District of New York, until 1974. He then joined the law firm of Hughes Hubbard & Reed in Manhattan, where he worked until 2012 when his failing health prevented him from continuing. Norman was always in motion. He was an ardent traveler and reveled in planning adventurous journeys with his family. Norman was also an accomplished trial lawyer with many notable trials that led to his selection as a fellow of the American College of Trial Lawyers. He was passionate about his work, devoted to his clients who chose him as their advocate, and loyal to his colleagues, training and inspiring a generation of attorneys at Hughes Hubbard & Reed where he chaired the litigation department. He loved to win, and nearly always did, while always adhering to the highest standards of the profession. Adversaries whom he had bested and judges who had presided over his cases remembered him with fondness and admiration years after their cases with Norman were over. His determination on behalf of his clients inspired those who worked for him to find reserves of stamina, persistence and creativity that they never knew they had. Norman had those qualities in abundance, and a magnificent ability to translate the hard work of the team into a devastating cross- examination or a winning argument to the court or jury. As devoted as he was to his profession, Norman was even more committed to his family, originally the three women in his life, then expanding to include his sons-in-law and grandchildren. Those who worked with Norman remember that even at the end of a long day preparing for trial, he never failed to call home to help with homework assignments or review college applications. And, just a few years ago, following another courtroom win, an Illinois jury was passing around pictures of his first grandchild. His vibrancy and courage live on in our hearts. Services will be held at Frank E. Campbell - The Funeral Chapel at 1076 Madison Avenue on Wednesday, May 4, at 1:30pm. 1/3"

2016-05-04T00:00:00Z,"MILLER--Mary Fried, on May 2, 2016 surrounded by her family. She was the beloved wife of 59 years of Charles H. Miller. She is survived by their children, Cathy Castaneda (Mario) of Acton, MA, Steven of Summit, NJ and Jennifer (Michael Grady) of Warwick, RI. She is also survived by her brother, John L. Fried (Roberta) of Milwaukee, WI, her beloved niece Sally Reiner (Larry), and her nephews Alan, Edward, Billy, and Michael. Her greatest joys were her children and her eight grandchildren - Kenny, Andrew and Matthew Miller, David, Mark and Peter Castaneda and Emily and Julia Grady. She left them with many wonderful memories and enough love and laughter to cherish for a lifetime. She was adored and admired by one and all, as well as by a host of friends in White Plains, Milwaukee, the Berkshires, and elsewhere. Mary was born in Milwaukee on June 25, 1930 to Dan and Belle Fried. After college, she moved from Milwaukee to New York and worked for A&S and Gimbels. She later earned a B.A. degree from Manhattanville College, and subsequently a Masters Degree in counseling. She was a career counselor in the Career Development Office at SUNY Purchase, for more than 20 years, where she initiated and developed an internship program for undergraduate students. Mary was an active volunteer in a broad range of activities; she was co-chair of the PTA, a docent at the Neuberger Museum at Purchase College, a volunteer with the pastoral care department at White Plains Hospital, and one of the founders of Aging in Place in White Plains. She was an avid tennis and bridge player, travelled extensively with her husband, family and grandchildren, before and after retirement, and was passionate about all forms of culture, including art, music and theatre. Her enjoyment of these arts was greatly enhanced as a result of her thirty-six summers in the Berkshires. In lieu of flowers, the family requests that memorial contributions be made to Make a Wish Foundation of Central New York, or the White Plains Beautification Foundation. A Memorial Celebration of her life will be held in the near future. 1/3"

2016-05-04T00:00:00Z,"PEARDON--Thomas Preston Jr.,of Bridgewater, Connecticut died April 21, after a long battle with illness. He was 77 years old. Born in New York City, he was the only child of Professor T.P. Peardon Sr., a history and political science professor at Barnard College, and Celeste (Comegys) Peardon, a well-known writer of books for children learning to read. Mr. Peardon attended The Trinity School in New York City and graduated from Harvard College with the class of 1960. While at Harvard he was a member of the DU Club and The Hasty Pudding Society. Immediately after college he joined his family's firm, Brunschwig et Fils, importers of high-end French fabrics and furniture for the interior decorator trade, with showrooms in New York City and in major cities throughout the U.S. and abroad. Rising through the ranks to CEO, he retired as Chairman of the Board in 2007. He was a member of the Union Club of New York City, the Harvard Club of New York City and a proud veteran of New York's famous 7th Regiment of the New York National Guard. Although a geology major in college, he was, like his father, an avid reader of history, his favorite pastime. Fluent in French, Mr. Peardon traveled often in France visiting his company's many suppliers. In 1968, in the midst of France's national strike against President Charles De Gaulle, he celebrated his marriage to his wife Eveline Le Jemtel at her family's chateau in Normandy, right next to Omaha Beach of D-Day fame. In later years he and his wife bought and remodeled a house in Bayeux on the Normandy coast where, after retirement, they spent many happy months during the year. Mr. Peardon leaves his wife of 48 years, Eveline, his son Thomas Olivier and his wife Susannah and two young granddaughters, of Greenwich, CT.

2016-05-04T00:00:00Z,"LORD--Barbara Stuart Hartley (Bobbie), age 92, passed away peacefully on Saturday, April 30, 2016 with her family beside her. Born on July 28, 1923, she lived an extraordinary life, growing up in Southampton, New York, with her parents, George Inness Hartley and Agnes de Montpellier Hartley, who predeceased her, as did her brother George. Her sister Marguerite (Bebs) survives in New York City. Barbara was a direct descendant of 19th century painter George Inness. Barbara went to Foxcroft School in Middleburg, Virginia, graduating in 1941, and went on to become a housemother and secretary to the founder of Foxcroft, Charlotte Haxall Noland, a dear friend and mentor. In fact, Foxcroft honored Barbara just this past month with its Distinguished Alumna Award. Barbara and James Couper Lord were married in Southampton in 1948 at St. Andrew's Dune Church, to which she and her family were devoted. They moved to Buffalo, NY, where she raised her family for over 30 years and where their four children were born: James Couper Lord, Jr. (deceased), Mary-Louise Lord Gillespie (husband David), Barbara Hartley Lord Edwards (husband Jim), and Ruth Lord (deceased). In Buffalo, Barbara served on the Boards of Buffalo General Hospital and Elmwood Franklin School, was an active member of Trinity Church and was President of the Garrett Club. Barbara and Couper retired to Southampton in 1980 where she continued her community work. She was President of the Southampton Nursing Home, a position she held for more than twenty-five years, was devoted to St. Andrew's Dune Church, where she served as head of the Altar Guild until she retired at ninety years of age and was appointed Trustee Emeritus, and was President of the Southampton Garden Club, for which she supervised numerous flower competitions and presided at a Garden Club of America zone meeting on the very day that her fifth granddaughter was born. Upon retiring from the Southampton Garden Club, she was honored to receive the Garden Club of America's Medal of Merit in recognition of her ""inspirational and wise leadership"". For many years Barbara served as an active member of the Village Improvement Association of Southampton, a local organization founded even before the incorporation of Southampton Village. A beloved mother, grandmother, and great-grandmother, she taught her children life's lessons of compassion for others and working within one's community. Her 'understanding heart' and empathy for the less fortunate was a gift she bequeathed to everyone about her, regardless of where she lived. Barbara is also survived by five granddaughters, whom she called her ""pearls""--Hartley Gillespie Wenger, Lorrie Edwards, Eleanor Gillespie Strumolo, Caroline Cook Edwards, Courtney Matson Edwards--and six great-grandchildren--Noah, Walter, Henry, Jack, Sophie, and Lily--with all of whom she celebrated her 92nd birthday. Barbara Hartley Lord guided her family, relatives, and countless friends in their accomplishments, inspiring everyone to make the world a better place. All of them loved her deeply and will dearly miss her. God rest her blessed soul. A memorial service will be held in July at St. Andrew's Dune Church in Southampton. In lieu of flowers, donations in her memory may be made to St. Andrew's Dune Church, St. John's Church in Southampton, or the J. Couper Lord, Jr., Dialysis Fund at Southampton Hospital. 1/3"

Born to Dr. Samuel and Ella Weiss on February 9, 1923 in New York, NY, Bernie became known in his family, the Horowitz-Margareten Family of matzoh bakers, as ""Uncle Doctor."" Bernie was beloved for his compassion and warmth. He practiced old fashioned, hands-on medicine, having learned from working with his father, also a doctor. He charged patients whatever they could afford to pay. Bernie's entire immediate family served in World War II, including his two brothers, his father and even his mother, who headed the local Manhattan Red Cross office. He enlisted in the United States Army Air Force before he was 18 years old. After the War, Bernie attended New York Medical College on the GI Bill. He loved his family and enriched their lives with his gentle manner and great sense of humor. The love of his life, his wife of 51 years Doris, sadly predeceased him in 2003.

Mr. von Mehren was 93. As a young lawyer for the firm that is now Debevoise & Plimpton, Mr. von Mehren served on the defense counsel team representing Mr. Hiss, a highly regarded former government official, during his two trials for perjury in 1949 and 1950. Mr. Hiss, then president of the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace, was told in August, 1948, that Whittaker Chambers, an editor at Time magazine, had testified before the Committee for the Investigation of Un-American Activities of the House of Representatives and had accused Hiss of being a spy for the Soviet Union while working for the U.S. government. Newspapers labeled the proceedings ""the trial of the century."" Richard M. Nixon subsequently became nationally famous for his pursuit of Communists, specially Mr. Hiss, and 20 years later, in 1968, was elected president. He revealed later, in the Watergate tapes, that he had mounted a systematic campaign of leaking information that would turn opinion against Hiss. Among the many positions Mr. von Mehren held outside the law firm were legal counsel to the Preparatory Commission of the International Atomic Energy Agency, which composed the guidelines for the United Nations' agency that exist today; consultant to the Rand Corporation on disarmament; consultant to the Hudson Institute on international law, and senior lecturer in law at the Wharton School. An active proselytizer of arbitration, Mr. von Mehren taught and lectured all over the world. He pioneered international arbitration among American lawyers, serving in more than four dozen arbitrations after he ""retired"" from Debevoise. His pro bono positions included chairman, vice chairman and/or president of the International Law Association, the Practicing Law Institute, the American branch of the International Law Association, several committees of the City Bar Association of New York and the Harvard Law School Association of New York. He was an honorary member of the Commercial Bar of London and the Singapore Bar. He was also on the board of the American Arbitration Association; a fellow of the American Bar Foundation; the vice-president emeritis of the Axe-Hougton Foundation, and a member of the Council on Foreign Relations, the Century Association and the University Club. Born in Albert Lea, Minn., he won a national scholarship to Yale University, from whence he graduated summa cum laude, then magna cum laude from the Harvard Law School, where he served as president of its Law Review. Upon graduation he became associated with Debevoise, where he spent most of his career until he became an international arbitrator. He clerked for Judge Learned Hand at the Second Circuit Court of Appeals and Supreme Court Justice Stanley F. Reed. An avid sailor, Mr. von Mehren raced his beloved Mariner Phalarope, on Martha's Vineyard, where he owned a home that he bought from James Cagney in 1957. In addition to his wife, Mr von Mehren is survived by his loving children: a son, Carl; three daughters, Katharine, Jane and Margaret, and Philip D. Anderson, his stepson. He was predeceased by his first wife, Mary Katharine; his younger son, John, and his identical twin, Arthur T. von Mehren. A celebration of his life is to be held in the fall in Manhattan. In lieu of flowers contributions may be made in his name to the Sherriff's Meadow Foundation, 57 David Ave., Vineyard Haven MA 02568. The family will receive friends at their Manhattan apartment 4pm-8pm on Sunday, May 8, and 6pm-8pm on Monday, May 9. 1/3"

Born to Dr. Samuel and Ella Weiss on February 9, 1923 in New York, NY, Bernie became known in his family, the Horowitz-Margareten Family of matzoh bakers, as ""Uncle Doctor."" Bernie was beloved for his compassion and warmth. He practiced old fashioned, hands-on medicine, having learned from working with his father, also a doctor. He charged patients whatever they could afford to pay. Bernie's entire immediate family served in World War II, including his two brothers, his father and even his mother, who headed the local Manhattan Red Cross office. He enlisted in the United States Army Air Force before he was 18 years old. After the War, Bernie attended New York Medical College on the GI Bill. He loved his family and enriched their lives with his gentle manner and great sense of humor. The love of his life, his wife of 51 years Doris, sadly predeceased him in 2003. During summers in Atlantic Beach, his joy was gardening and barbecuing for family and friends - smoked capon was the family favorite. Bernie was loved by many and will be missed deeply by all who knew him. He is survived by his daughter Wendy and son-in-law Judd Meltzer, his daughter Cathy Zises, grandchildren Samantha and Jonathan Firestone, Joshua and Ali Meltzer, Aaron and Blake Zises, Samuel Zises and fiance Cassie Shulman, Benjamin Zises and Natalie Zises, great-grandchildren Charlotte and Hudson Firestone, sister-in-law Marie Rosen, nephews and nieces Jonny and Caroline Rosen, and Billy and Suzy Rosen. He also leaves behind a brother Jerome, many cousins and other nieces and nephews. Marie Rosen holds a most special place in his heart. She was like a sister, especially since Doris passed away. Shira Levin has been an esteemed extended member of the family. We thank her for her sage counsel, and most importantly, her love. The family thanks Ketty Suarez for her many years of devoted service. With her sister Eloise, they took the best care of Dr. Weiss. The family will have a private service and funeral. 1/3"
2016-05-08T00:00:00Z,"CHOU--Yi-an, wife of composer Chou Wen- chung, passed away peacefully at home on April 12, 2016 after a short battle with pancreatic cancer. She was born in Shanghai in 1927 to Chang (Han) Siang-mei and Chang Hsin-hai, a scholar and China's ambassador to Czechoslovakia, Poland and Portugal from 1933-37. She spent her early childhood in Eastern Europe. She began studying the piano at age eight in Warsaw and continued her studies in Los Angeles, where her family moved in 1941. Mrs. Chou made her concert debut with Leopold Stokowski and the Hollywood Bowl Symphony during her senior year of high school, and later moved to New York City to study with Olga Samaroff at The Juilliard School on a fellowship. In 1956, she received grants to perform in Europe, where she studied with Walter Gieseking and Marguerite Long, and gave recitals in England, France, and Germany, where the Hamburg Evening Newspaper called her ""...altogether an amazing pianist and musical talent."" She married Chou Wen-chung in 1962 and retired from performing to care for their two sons. Her passion for flowers later led to a second career as a floral designer. Her arrangements caught the attention of the Parsons School of Design where she was invited to teach Parson's first class in floral design in 1979. For twenty-five years, she taught both Western and Ikebana styles, and the Floral Design program became one of Parsons's most popular certificate programs. She was former president of the New York Chapter of the Ohara School of Ikebana, and a member of Ikebana International. Yi-an is survived by her husband, sons Luyen and Sumin, daughters-in-law Rachel and Kiersten, and three grandchildren. She was predeceased by her brother, David P. Chang. Her laughter, friendship and joie-de-vivre are missed dearly by all who knew and loved her.

2016-05-08T00:00:00Z,"CHAPLIN--Hugh, Jr.,M.D., of Westwood, Massachusetts, formerly of St. Louis, Missouri, died peacefully at his home on April 29, 2016 at the age of 93. Hugh was born in New York City on February 4, 1923 to Hugh Chaplin, Sr., M.D., and Virginia Deems Chaplin, and was preceded in death by his two sisters, Barbara Stewart (of Wyckoff, New Jersey) and Virginia Atkinson (of Toledo, Ohio). He graduated from The Hill School (Pottstown, Pennsylvania), Princeton University (A.B., 1943), and the Columbia University College of Physicians and Surgeons (M.D., 1947). While in college and medical school, he served in the U.S. Navy during the final months of WWII. He performed his internal medicine residency at the Massachusetts General Hospital, serving as chief resident in his final year. He entered an academic career through a research fellowship in the US Public Health Service at the National Institutes of Health and pursued additional research training at the Medical Research Council Blood Transfusion Research Unit in London. He joined the faculty of Washington University School of Medicine in St. Louis in 1955 and served several leadership roles including Associate Dean, Director of the Irene Walter Johnson Rehabilitation Institute, and later Director of the Barnes Hospital Blood Bank. A hematologist, research scientist, and professor of medicine, Hugh authored over 140 scientific articles and was recognized internationally for his work on sickle cell anemia, autoimmune hemolytic anemia, transfusion reactions, and blood banking. He served on the national board of the American Association of Blood Banking and was honored by the Association's Emily Cooley Memorial Award and Lectureship. In 2003, in honor of his longest- living sickle cell patient and research colleague, Hugh self-published the memoir, ""Lenabell: A Doctor's Memoir of a Remarkable Woman's Eighty Year Battle with Sickle Cell Disease."" In his retirement, Hugh worked extensively for BJC Hospice in St. Louis, both as a volunteer visitor with the dying and as the organization's pain management consultant. Hugh travelled extensively throughout his life, including three sabbaticals in England. His day visiting Mother Teresa in Calcutta in the early 1970s remained one of his most profound life experiences. Despite travelling throughout the world, however, his favorite spot was the longtime family home in the Catskill Mountains. Every evening at dusk, he could almost always be found enjoying the changing light and view of the mountains from what he called his ""psychotherapy spot"" on the upstairs back porch. An avid fly-fisherman, Hugh spent many happy times casting for trout in the Ozark Mountains of Missouri. His trout pancakes with caper cream sauce were an epicurean experience. Despite declining health in his latter years, Hugh remained deeply appreciative of his many blessings--a loving family, dear friends--old and new--a strong faith, and the ability to enjoy some of life's simple pleasures: art, the beauty of nature, and the joys of a classic glazed donut. He will be greatly missed by all who had the privilege to know him. Hugh is survived by his four children and their spouses (Kate and Roger Woodward, of Surrey, England; David and Jane Chaplin of Birmingham, Alabama; Monique Chaplin and Mary McCartney of Arlington, Massachusetts; and John Chaplin and Jill Adams of Delmar, New York), eight grandchildren and their spouses (Adrian and Leanna Gonzalez of Charlestown, Massachusetts; Sebastian and Josie Gonzalez of Canton, Massachusetts; Vernon and Cathy Chaplin, of Pasadena, California; Rosalind Chaplin of San Diego, California; Daniel Chaplin of Birmingham, Alabama; and Benjamin, Wesley, and Clara Chaplin of Delmar, New York), and three great-grandchildren (Daniel Gonzalez, June Chaplin, and Madison Gonzalez), whose arrivals brought a most special joy to his final years. Hugh was preceded in death by two beloved spouses, Alice Dougherty Chaplin (mother of his four children, who died in 1996 after 52 years of marriage) and Lee Nelken Robins, PhD (with whom he enjoyed 11 years of marriage before her death in 2009). A memorial service and burial at All Souls Church, Onteora Park, Tannersville, NY, will be scheduled at a later date. In lieu of flowers, donations to the National Down Syndrome Congress would be a most appreciated tribute. 1/3"

2016-05-08T00:00:00Z,"LORD--Barbara Stuart Hartley (Bobbie), age 92, passed away peacefully on Saturday, April 30, 2016 with her family beside her. Born on July 28, 1923, she lived an extraordinary life, growing up in Southampton, New York, with her parents, George Inness Hartley and Agnes de Montpellier Hartley, who predeceased her, as did her brother George. Her sister Marguerite (Bebs) survives in New York City. Barbara was a direct descendant of 19th century painter George Inness. Barbara went to Foxcroft School in Middleburg, Virginia, graduating in 1941, and went on to become a housemother and secretary to the founder of Foxcroft, Charlotte Haxall Noland, a dear friend and mentor. In fact, Foxcroft honored Barbara just this past month with its Distinguished Alumna Award. Barbara and James Couper Lord were married in Southampton in 1948 at St. Andrew's Dune Church, to which she and her family were devoted. They moved to Buffalo, NY, where she raised her family for over 30 years and where their four children were born: James Couper Lord, Jr. (deceased), Mary-Louise Lord Gillespie (husband David), Barbara Hartley Lord Edwards (husband Jim), and Ruth Lord (deceased). In Buffalo, Barbara served on the Boards of Buffalo General Hospital and Elmwood Franklin School, was an active member of Trinity Church and was President of the Garrett Club. Barbara and Couper retired to Southampton in 1980 where she continued her community work. She was President of the Southampton Nursing Home, a position she held for more than twenty-five years, was devoted to St. Andrew's Dune Church, where she served as head of the Altar Guild until she retired at ninety years of age and was appointed Trustee Emeritus, and was President of the Southampton Garden Club, for which she supervised numerous flower competitions and presided at a Garden Club of America zone meeting on the very day that her fifth granddaughter was born. Upon retiring from the Southampton Garden Club, she was honored to receive the Garden Club of America's Medal of Merit in recognition of her ""inspirational and wise leadership"". For many years Barbara served as an active member of the Village Improvement Association of Southampton, a local organization founded even before the incorporation of Southampton Village. A beloved mother, grandmother, and great-grandmother, she taught her children life's lessons of compassion for others and working within one's community. Her 'understanding heart' and empathy for the less fortunate was a gift she bequeathed to everyone about her, regardless of where she lived. Barbara is also survived by five granddaughters, whom she called her ""pearls""--Hartley Gillespie Wenger, Lorrie Edwards, Eleanor Gillespie Strumolo, Caroline Cook Edwards, Courtney Matson Edwards--and six great-grandchildren--Noah, Walter, Henry, Jack, Sophie, and Lily--with all of whom she celebrated her 92nd birthday.

2016-05-08T00:00:00Z,"von MEHREN--Robert B.,The last surviving lawyer in the infamous Alger Hiss trials of the late 1940s, died Thursday at his home in Manhattan from congestive heart failure, according to his wife, Susan Heller Anderson, a writer and former reporter for The New York Times. Mr. von Mehren was 93. As a young lawyer for the firm that is now Debevoise & Plimpton, Mr. von Mehren served on the defense counsel team representing Mr. Hiss, a highly regarded former government official, during his two trials for perjury in 1949 and 1950. Mr. Hiss, then president of the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace, was told in August, 1948, that Whittaker Chambers, an editor at Time magazine, had testified before the Committee for the Investigation of Un-American Activities of the House of Representatives and had accused Hiss of being a spy for the Soviet Union while working for the U.S. government. Newspapers labeled the proceedings ""the trial of the century."" Richard M. Nixon subsequently became nationally famous for his pursuit of Communists, specially Mr. Hiss, and 20 years later, in 1968, was elected president. He revealed later, in the Watergate tapes, that he had mounted a systematic campaign of leaking information that would turn opinion against Hiss. Among the many positions Mr. von Mehren held outside the law firm were legal counsel to the Preparatory Commission of the International Atomic Energy Agency, which composed the guidelines for the United Nations' agency that exist today; consultant to the Rand Corporation on disarmament; consultant to the Hudson Institute on international law, and senior lecturer in law at the Wharton School. An active proselytizer of arbitration, Mr. von Mehren taught and lectured all over the world. He pioneered international arbitration among American lawyers, serving in more than four dozen arbitrations after he ""retired"" from Debevoise. His pro bono positions included chairman, vice chairman and/or president of the International Law Association, the Practicing Law Institute, the American branch of the International Law Association, several committees of the City Bar Association of New York and the Harvard Law School Association of New York. He was an honorary member of the Commercial Bar of London and the Singapore Bar. He was also on the board of the American Arbitration Association; a fellow of the American Bar Foundation; the vice-president emeritis of the Axe-Hougton Foundation, and a member of the Council on Foreign Relations, the Century Association and the University Club. Born in Albert Lea, Minn., he won a national scholarship to Yale University, from whence he graduated summa cum laude, then magna cum laude from the Harvard Law School, where he served as president of its Law Review. Upon graduation he became associated with Debevoise, where he spent most of his career until he became an international arbitrator. He clerked for Judge Learned Hand at the Second Circuit Court of Appeals and Supreme Court Justice Stanley F. Reed. An avid sailor, Mr. von Mehren raced his beloved Mariner Phalarope, on Martha's Vineyard, where he owned a home that he bought from James Cagney in 1957. In addition to his wife, Mr von Mehren is survived by his loving children: a son, Carl; three daughters, Katharine, Jane and Margaret, and Philip D. Anderson, his stepson. He was predeceased by his first wife, Mary Katharine; his younger son, John, and his identical twin, Arthur T. von Mehren. A celebration of his life is to be held in the fall in Manhattan. In lieu of flowers contributions may be made in his name to the Sherriff's Meadow Foundation, 57 David Ave., Vineyard Haven MA 02568. The family will receive friends at their Manhattan apartment 4pm-8pm on Sunday, May 8, and 6pm-8pm on Monday, May 9. 1/3"

Dyckman and OHora (the team behind “Wolfie the Bunny”) specialize in full-spectrum emotion and offbeat charm, making a kid’s temper tantrum as fun as a theme park ride. Bear doesn’t mean to break the girl’s kite, but she is furious, clomping home proclaiming his horribleness. Bear’s enraged too. (The injustice!) Heading to her house for a fight, he’s met with contrition, and they patch it up. The art is a blast — even at her surliest, the girl will win smiles with her gigantic red curls."

2016-05-08T00:00:00Z,"COOKE--Bridget Birdsall, a noted specialist in teaching reading to children with learning disabilities, died in Sleepy Hollow, NY, on April 18. Ms. Cooke had studied and worked in the academic world in New York from her freshman year at Barnard College until four years ago, when she retired to Kendal on Hudson. She was 84 years old. Ms. Cooke was born in Boston, child of Paul Birdsall, a historian and U.S. foreign service officer, and Helen Grew Birdsall. Her older brother, Paul Birdsall, operates Horsepower Farm in Penobscot, Maine, a project where prospective farmers seek internships to live and farm there without electricity. After graduating from Milton Academy in Massachusetts and Barnard in 1953, Bridie, as she was known, worked as a secretary at the Columbia Graduate School of Journalism. She earned a master's degree and an Ed.D. at Yeshiva University in New York and began teaching at SUNY and CUNY, where she helped to prepare students for college work. Her career was principally invested in teaching and coaching struggling students in grade school and high school, first at the Ramaz Modern Orthodox School on the Upper East Side in New York and then, from 1987 to 2001, at Columbia Grammar and Preparatory on the Upper West Side. She also had an independent practice, and was widely sought by parents. She married twice and had no children. But her understanding of the young was strong. Margo Potter, the dean at Columbia Prep when Ms. Cooke was there, said, ""She could reach children the way no one else could. She was the teacher they always came back to see after they had been graduated. She was much beloved."" Rhoda Weyr of Boothbay, Maine, formerly a literary agent in New York, said that her daughter, Garret Freymann-Weyr, now a published author, had been led out of her youthful tangles with spoken and written language by Ms. Cooke. ""Garret really loved her,"" Ms. Weyr said, ""and when she came in the door problems began to lessen."" Ms. Cooke retired from Columbia Prep in the summer of 2001. However, on September 11, she hurried back to the school to make sure that her pupils got home safely. ""I just felt I had to be there for them, "" she told an associate. Her marriages to Frank Pulliam and Jack Cooke, both of whom she met at Columbia, ended in divorce. Her sister, Jessie, died earlier. There is no funeral; she willed her body to medicine. A memorial service is being planned. 1/3"

2016-05-12T00:00:00Z,"TIEDEMANN--Carl Hans II, age 89, died peacefully on Saturday April 30, 2016 at his home in New York City. Born June 3, 1926 in Cleveland, Ohio to May Glenn and Carl Hans Tiedemann. At the age of three Carl lost his father in the midst of the Great Depression. His mother moved Carl and his sister Frances to Plainfield, New Jersey where she had family and a support system. Carl served in the Navy in World War II and he was forever a devout supporter and champion of America's greatness. Carl attended Phillips Exeter Academy followed by Trinity College in Hartford, Connecticut. He was the founder of the school's lacrosse program and later had the honor of being inducted into Trinity's Lacrosse Hall of Fame. After college, Carl began his professional career in sales at American Cyanamid, one of the nation's largest conglomerates at the time. While he honed his sales skills, he always had his eye on Wall Street and jumped at the chance to begin his career at Stone & Webster, a small brokerage firm. A few years later in 1962, when offered the opportunity to join a new firm, Donaldson, Lufkin & Jenrette (DLJ), he quickly accepted. After working his way up the ranks, in 1975 he took over as President until his departure in 1980 to start the Tiedemann Investment Group (TIG). Carl served on the boards of Alltel Corporation, Curtice Burns, Claremont Capital Corp, Dillon Read & Co., Nikko Securities International, Kleinwort Benson International, National Medical Care, Piedmont Management Company, Winrock International (a Winthrop Rockefeller Foundation), was a Trustee of the Allen-Stevenson school, and also served as a Governor of the American Stock exchange from 1969 to 1972. At TIG, Carl utilized his global network of contacts to source investment talent and provide financial backing and infrastructure to help build their hedge fund business. He loved finding talented individuals while giving them the opportunity to harness their entrepreneurial energy. Those efforts led to a variety of successful funds through the years, and a business that is still thriving 36 years later as one of the longest standing firms in the hedge fund industry. The company that was Carl's longtime dream to found was Tiedemann Trust Company, now known as Tiedemann Wealth Management (TWM). It was Carl's belief that families had been poorly served by large institutions ""wrought with conflicts and inflexibility"" for decades. This view was forged from his own family experience in dealing with a traditional trust bank. He wanted to build a trust company that could invest with the best and the brightest, but without any conflict or financial arrangement with the money managers. It was a simple concept, but one that was not being offered. This open architecture model is now the standard within the industry, as even the large institutions have had to pivot their business models to adapt to new competition from firms like TWM. As a leader, Carl was remarkably positive. In the face of the greatest challenges he would find a silver lining. He was the eternal optimist. His legacy is a unique one, and will live on through his two businesses, now larger and more institutional than at any point in his life, but with the same great culture he created. Carl is survived by his wife, Kari Jonassen Tiedemann. He is also survived by his four children, Hans Tiedemann of Santa Monica, CA; Mark Tiedemann of Los Angeles, CA; Leigh Tiedemann of Lexington, MA; Michael Tiedemann of New York, NY, and their respective spouses. Carl is also survived by 11 grandchildren. Carl was a member of the University Club, Maidstone Club, Link Club, River Club of New York, Doubles, Angler's Club, Tabusintac Club, Club at Windermere, Economic Club of New York, and Long Island Wyandanch Club. A memorial service will be held on Tuesday, May 24, 2016 at 10:45am at St. Bartholomew's Episcopal Church, 325 Park Avenue, New York, NY 10022. Instead of flowers, the family suggests a gift to The Tiedemann Family Scholarship Fund at the Middlesex School, 1400 Lowell Road, Concord, MA 01742. 1/3"

2016-05-12T00:00:00Z,"LEHMAN--Wendy Vanderbilt, a New York artist whose work resides in the collection of the National Gallery of Art, died of heart failure Tuesday at her home in Manhattan. She was 72. Known for her love of modernism, Wendy was greatly inspired by her mentors Georgia O'Keefe and O'Keefe's sister, Anita Young. Wendy's artistic expression spanned several mediums. Her work included extraordinary sculptures in wood and aluminum as well evocative paintings in acrylic and watercolor. In 2008, she was selected to be a part of The Dorothy and Herbert Vogel Collection: Fifty Works for Fifty States, which resulted in the placement of her work in museums across the country. Wendy was also blessed with a wry sense of humor. She was beloved for her vast and high-powered email list to which she posted everything from political commentary to dirty jokes. Always savoring a good laugh, she embraced her role as a social connector and loyal friend. There were few things Wendy appreciated more than spending time with her numerous and multifarious friends. Wendy was born in California to Manuela Hudson and Alfred Gwynne Vanderbilt II, a pioneer in thoroughbred racing, whose father had gone down on the Lusitania. She grew up between Palm Beach and Manhattan. Wendy was featured in one of Lilly Pulitzer's first advertising campaigns and attended the Truman Capote Black and White Ball in 1966. Although she enjoyed the social circuit, Wendy chose to devote her time to her children and her art. In addition to her work as an artist, Wendy was a founding member of STOP: Stop Traffic Offenses Program, having witnessed a red light runner nearly kill a friend's child. A natural born tinkerer, in the 70s Wendy made her friends light dimmers out of margarine containers for Christmas. She spent countless hours working on benefits for institutions like the New York Studio School. Wendy was also a spirited member of both The Century Association and the Junior Fortnightly. After attending Sarah Lawrence College, Wendy was married the late Orin Lehman, New York State's longest-serving commissioner of Parks, Recreation and Historic Preservation. The couple had two daughters. They divorced in 1995. Wendy is survived by her three daughters, Brooke Lehman of Millerton, NY, Sage Lehman of Brooklyn, and Susan Lehman of Greenwich, CT; six grandchildren; and her companion, Bill Beermann. Mrs. Lehman's artistic creativity and passion for her family and friends was unparalleled. Her loyalty and brazen sense of humor will be dearly missed. 1/3"

A native New Yorker resident in Florida since his retirement, Peter loved dancing, golf, pinochle, pasta aioli and his 1986 Mercedes.

The son of Vincenzo and Luca Corsello, Peter grew up above the family's Italian bakery in Brooklyn, New York, where his father baked sweet Italian bread in a wood fired oven 365 nights a year. After WW II service as a gunnery instructor and in Army intelligence, Peter returned to New York to complete a construction/design program and work with Sonneborn & Sons, soon becoming the company's go to technical expert in waterproofing product applications. Peter pioneered the development of fluid applied membranes and other waterproofing solutions for masonry and curtain wall structures, first as president of Toch Brothers, a waterproofing company founded in the 1800's and later as president of his own consulting firm, Peter Corsell Associates. Projects to which Peter contributed included Chicago's Sears Tower and, together with the PCA team of architects and building engineers, the remediation of curtain wall failures at Boston's John Hancock Building and development of specifications designed to preserve landmark masonry buildings throughout the northeast, including New York's iconic Chrysler Building.

A graduate of James Madison High School, Class of 1938, Bob enrolled in a two-year accelerated college program at Alfred University prior to graduating NYU College of Dentistry in 1942.

Bob brought a meticulous and artistic eye to his work, which was much admired by his patients and professional colleagues. An innovative thinker and problem solver, he embraced new technologies well into his 90s, staying engaged with life and the people around him, including grandchildren who helped keep him young. A wonderful storyteller with a keen sense of humor, he was easily able to engage those around him. Always an artist at heart, Bob reveled in many hours painting in his studio after finally retiring from dentistry in 1995 at age 79. He had an infectious charm and children were mesmerized by his magic tricks. His sense of fun was highly attuned as was his intellectual curiosity.

Bob was born in Brooklyn, NY on January 4, 1918 to David Lewis Sloane, DDS, and Sarah Kanterman Sloane and was preceded in death by his brother Theodore S. Sloane of Palm Beach, Florida. A graduate of James Madison High School, Class of 1938, Bob enrolled in a two-year accelerated college program at Alfred University prior to graduating NYU College of Dentistry in 1942. He started his dental practice in his father's office after coming home from World War II in 1946 after four years of service. He conducted a very successful practice in reconstructive dentistry on 69th Street across from his beloved Central Park. Bob brought a meticulous and artistic eye to his work, which was much admired by his patients and professional colleagues. An innovative thinker and problem solver, he embraced new technologies well into his 90s, staying engaged with life and the people around him, including grandchildren who helped keep him young. A wonderful storyteller with a keen sense of humor, he was easily able to engage those around him. Always an artist at heart, Bob reveled in many hours painting in his studio after finally retiring from dentistry in 1995 at age 79. He had an infectious charm and children were mesmerized by his magic tricks. His sense of fun was highly attuned as was his intellectual curiosity. He is survived by his wife of 46 years, Ann, and their children, Margaret of Washington DC, and Douglas and his wife, Esther, of New York, NY and two daughters by his first marriage to the former late Joan Lahm, Carol and her partner, Jim Bowers, of Maine, Adrienne of Massachusetts as well as grandsons, Asa Oines, Alex and Oliver Sloane of New York, NY; and Nicholas G.B.

He considered his greatest achievements in life to have been his family, his Army service during World War II in the Signal Corps as a cryptographer, his successful business career with his brother, Joe, in the family business, Rothchild Printing Company, and his passionate support for the State of Israel through his work with the United Jewish Appeal. He was loyal and devoted to the people he loved, and he inspired loyalty and devotion in others. Herb maintained friendships with his employees and professional colleagues well after he retired. Herb loved to travel and he loved fly-fishing, particularly on the Snake River in Wyoming.

She was 72. Known for her love of modernism, Wendy was greatly inspired by her mentors Georgia O'Keefe and O'Keefe's sister, Anita Young. Wendy's artistic expression spanned several mediums. Her work included extraordinary sculptures in wood and aluminum as well evocative paintings in acrylic and watercolor. In 2008, she was selected to be a part of The Dorothy and Herbert Vogel Collection: Fifty Works for Fifty States, which resulted in the placement of her work in museums across the country. Wendy was also blessed with a wry sense of humor. She was beloved for her vast and high-powered email list to which she posted everything from political commentary to dirty jokes. Always savoring a good laugh, she embraced her role as a social connector and loyal friend. There were few things Wendy appreciated more than spending time with her numerous and multifarious friends. Wendy was born in California to Manuela Hudson and Alfred Gwynne Vanderbilt II, a pioneer in thoroughbred racing, whose father had gone down on the Lusitania. She grew up between Palm Beach and Manhattan. Wendy was featured in one of Lilly Pulitzer's first advertising campaigns and attended the Truman Capote Black and White Ball in 1966. Although she enjoyed the social circuit, Wendy chose to devote her time to her children and her art. In addition to her work as an artist, Wendy was a founding member of STOP: Stop Traffic Offenses Program, having witnessed a red light runner nearly kill a friend's child. A natural born tinkerer, in the 70s Wendy made her friends light dimmers out of margarine containers for Christmas. She spent countless hours working on benefits for institutions like the New York Studio School. Wendy was also a spirited member of both The Century Association and the Junior Fortnightly. After attending Sarah Lawrence College, Wendy was married the late Orin Lehman, New York State's longest-serving commissioner of Parks, Recreation and Historic Preservation. The couple had two daughters. They divorced in 1995. Wendy is survived by her three daughters, Brooke Lehman of Millerton, NY, Sage Lehman of Brooklyn, and Susan Lehman of Greenwich, CT; six grandchildren; and her companion, Bill Beermann. Mrs. Lehman's artistic creativity and passion for her family and friends was unparalleled. Her loyalty and brazen sense of humor will be dearly missed. 1/3"

An award-winning student actress, she continued acting after graduation as a member of Actors' Equity, SAG, and AFTRA.

2016-05-15T00:00:00Z,"SANDVED--Kjell Bloch, naturalist, lecturer, filmmaker, and photographer for the Smithsonian Institution Museum of Natural History, and discoverer of the Butterfly Alphabet, died at his home in Washington, on December 20, 2015. The cause of death was dementia. He never married. He is survived by a brother and many nieces and nephews in Norway. Mr. Sandved was born October 20, 1922, in Strandebarm, in the Hardangerfjord, where his father, Alf Michael Bloch Sandved, had become the district physician. Kjell's mother loved to play the piano, instilling in him an appreciation for classical music. After taking courses in Arts and Natural History at UiO, Mr. Sandved saw a great need for a music encyclopedia. He was the publisher and author of two encyclopedias -- one on Classical Music and one on Classical Art, subsequently revised and edited for 10 different countries. The books, Musikkens Verden and Kunstens Verden, were richly illustrated, with African mahogany covers -- a worldwide success. In the spring of 1960, as a visiting researcher gathering materials for his encyclopedia of natural history at the SI, he discovered a silvery letter ""F"" in the delicate design of a butterfly wing. It was the beginning of his search for all letters of the alphabet on the wings of butterflies. He put aside plans for the encyclopedia, stayed in Washington, taught himself photography and customized a portable microscope and electronic camera gear. He visited more than 30 countries to discover all the letters of the alphabet on the wings of butterflies. His quest for the alphabet took him through the United States, and tropical rain forests and islands around the world. Mr. Sandved became the Smithsonian Museum of Natural History's first full-time nature photographer. He traveled the world with leading researchers for nearly three decades, capturing the beauty and diversity of nature. He started his business, Butterfly Alphabet, Inc., in 1993, after he retired from his 32- year career at the Museum of Natural History. In his posters, prints and his classic children's book, Butterfly Alphabet, Kjell Sandved has shared with the world -- particularly with children -- his unique ability to see meaning in the tiniest details. The different Butterfly Alphabets have now become the most distributed educational nature posters in the U.S. Over a million of his colorful Butterfly Alphabet posters now grace homes and schools everywhere. He co-authored nine books of nature photography -- four on butterflies, and other books on insects, shells, rain forests, leaves and bark. Kjell Sandved's Butterfly Alphabet and nature images have been displayed at the Kennedy Center and in museums around the world and have appeared in many publications including Smithsonian Magazine and National Geographic. Mr. Sandved always brightened every space he entered with his joy and enthusiasm for life, discovery and love. 1/3"

2016-05-15T00:00:00Z,"FREEDMAN--Ralph. died in Decatur, Georgia, on May 5th, after a brief illness. Freedman was born on February 24, 1920 in Hamburg, Germany. A Jewish refugee, he emigrated to England in early 1939, and the United States in 1940. In 1941, he entered the army where he served as an intelligence officer and saw combat in Tunisia and at the invasion of Sicily and, finally, in the forward unit of 5th Army Headquarters in Italy. Upon his return, Ralph wrote a novel based on recollections of his brief post-war service in counter-intelligence in Austria, Divided (1948) which earned him the Lewis & Clark Northwest Award offered by E.P.

After graduating from the University of Washington, Ralph received an M.A. in philosophy from Brown and Ph.D. in Comparative Literature from Yale in 1953. A revision of his dissertation The Lyrical Novel was published by the Princeton University Press in 1963. He later went on to publish biographies of Hermann Hesse (Pilgrim of Crisis, 1978) and Ranier Maria Rilke (Life of a Poet, 1996). His work has been translated into German, Italian, French, Korean, Spanish and Chinese. Freedman taught at the University of Iowa, was for many years a mainstay of the Comparative Literature Department at Princeton, and ended his career at Emory University. He was was unfailingly loyal to his friends and generous to his students, who loved him as much as he loved them. He survived the Nazis, the World War, McCarthyite America, the 60s, Reagan and Bush, all of whom he spent much time bemoaning; he wrote on Rilke, Hesse, Woolf and novel theory with old world knowingness and New World wonder. He sired three children, Jonathan of Ann Arbor, Michigan and Mark of New York, New York, and Ruth Ellen who died in 1966. His surviving children and his six grandchildren all miss him a ton. 1/3"
2016-05-15T00:00:00Z,"PATTERSON--Patricia. Patricia Shephard Patterson, passed away peacefully in Palm Beach, Florida surrounded by her loving family on Mother's Day, May 8th following a long illness. She was born in San Francisco on June 29th, 1925. Shortly after graduating from Stanford University in 1947, Patricia and her sister, Geraldine, moved to New York City. In 1958 she married Bruce A. Norris, owner of the Detroit Red Wings. Together they had a daughter, Wendy Norris, who they cherished. They divorced in 1967. In April, 1970 she married Herbert Patterson, then President of Chase Manhattan Bank. In the late 1970's Patricia began a long and esteemed career in Real Estate. As Vice President of Sotheby's International Realty in Manhattan she was a top producer. Clients became friends, her friends became clients and her career turned into her passion. Pat actively and continuously dedicated herself to making the world a better place for others. She worked tirelessly with boards, commissions and volunteer organizations. She was noted for her work as a Board Member of The Boys Club of New York, The School of American Ballet, International Committee of the Museum of Modern Art, The Venetian Heritage, The Central Park Conservancy, The Junior League and The Parish Art Museum. Traveling the world was one of Patricia's many passions. She loved exploring museums, galleries, cathedrals and diverse cultures. She was a passionate collector and supporter of the arts. Her most precious memories were the times she was able to share her life's journeys with friends and family. She was an avid sportswoman, proficient in many sports. Pat spent many happy days competing at her favorite Clubs, including The Meadow Club, Lyford Cay Club and the Everglades Club. Weekends were always spent either enjoying lunch on the porch at The Bathing Corporation or Sunday night dinners at Piping Rock. Holidays were spent at The Colony Club and The River Club.

2016-05-15T00:00:00Z,"TIEDEMANN--Carl Hans II, age 89, died peacefully on Saturday April 30, 2016 at his home in New York City. Born June 3, 1926 in Cleveland, Ohio to May Glenn and Carl Hans Tiedemann. At the age of three Carl lost his father in the midst of the Great Depression. His mother moved Carl and his sister Frances to Plainfield, New Jersey where she had family and a support system. Carl served in the Navy in World War II and he was forever a devout supporter and champion of America's greatness. Carl attended Phillips Exeter Academy followed by Trinity College in Hartford, Connecticut. He was the founder of the school's lacrosse program and later had the honor of being inducted into Trinity's Lacrosse Hall of Fame. After college, Carl began his professional career in sales at American Cyanamid, one of the nation's largest conglomerates at the time. While he honed his sales skills, he always had his eye on Wall Street and jumped at the chance to begin his career at Stone & Webster, a small brokerage firm. A few years later in 1962, when offered the opportunity to join a new firm, Donaldson, Lufkin & Jenrette (DLJ), he quickly accepted. After working his way up the ranks, in 1975 he took over as President until his departure in 1980 to start the Tiedemann Investment Group (TIG). Carl served on the boards of Alltel Corporation, Curtice Burns, Claremont Capital Corp, Dillon Read & Co., Nikko Securities International, Kleinwort Benson International, National Medical Care, Piedmont Management Company, Winrock International (a Winthrop Rockefeller Foundation), was a Trustee of the Allen-Stevenson school, and also served as a Governor of the American Stock exchange from 1969 to 1972. At TIG, Carl utilized his global network of contacts to source investment talent and provide financial backing and infrastructure to help build their hedge fund business. He loved finding talented individuals while giving them the opportunity to harness their entrepreneurial energy. Those efforts led to a variety of successful funds through the years, and a business that is still thriving 36 years later as one of the longest standing firms in the hedge fund industry. The company that was Carl's longtime dream to found was Tiedemann Trust Company, now known as Tiedemann Wealth Management (TWM). It was Carl's belief that families had been poorly served by large institutions ""wrought with conflicts and inflexibility"" for decades. This view was forged from his own family experience in dealing with a traditional trust bank. He wanted to build a trust company that could invest with the best and the brightest, but without any conflict or financial arrangement with the money managers. It was a simple concept, but one that was not being offered. This open architecture model is now the standard within the industry, as even the large institutions have had to pivot their business models to adapt to new competition from firms like TWM. As a leader, Carl was remarkably positive. In the face of the greatest challenges he would find a silver lining. He was the eternal optimist. His legacy is a unique one, and will live on through his two businesses, now larger and more institutional than at any point in his life, but with the same great culture he created. Carl is survived by his wife, Kari Jonassen Tiedemann. He is also survived by his four children, Hans Tiedemann of Santa Monica, CA; Mark Tiedemann of Los Angeles, CA; Leigh Tiedemann of Lexington, MA; Michael Tiedemann of New York, NY, and their respective spouses. Carl is also survived by 11 grandchildren. Carl was a member of the University Club, Maidstone Club, Link Club, River Club of New York, Doubles, Angler's Club, Tabusintac Club, Club at Windermere, Economic Club of New York, and Long Island Wyandanch Club. A memorial service will be held on Tuesday, May 24, 2016 at 10:45am at St. Bartholomew's Episcopal Church, 325 Park Avenue, New York, NY 10022. Instead of flowers, the family suggests a gift to The Tiedemann Family Scholarship Fund at the Middlesex School, 1400 Lowell Road, Concord, MA 01742. 1/3"

Upon his return, Ralph wrote a novel based on recollections of his brief post-war service in counter-intelligence in Austria, Divided (1948) which earned him the Lewis & Clark Northwest Award offered by E.P. Dutton in 1947 (unlike his first novel which he had flung into the Thames River in London). After graduating from the University of Washington, Ralph received an M.A. in philosophy from Brown and Ph.D. in Comparative Literature from Yale in 1953. A revision of his dissertation The Lyrical Novel was published by the Princeton University Press in 1963. He later went on to publish biographies of Hermann Hesse (Pilgrim of Crisis, 1978) and Ranier Maria Rilke (Life of a Poet, 1996). His work has been translated into German, Italian, French, Korean, Spanish and Chinese. Freedman taught at the University of Iowa, was for many years a mainstay of the Comparative Literature Department at Princeton, and ended his career at Emory University. He was was unfailingly loyal to his friends and generous to his students, who loved him as much as he loved them. He survived the Nazis, the World War, McCarthyite America, the 60s, Reagan and Bush, all of whom he spent much time bemoaning; he wrote on Rilke, Hesse, Woolf and novel theory with old world knowingness and New World wonder. He sired three children, Jonathan of Ann Arbor, Michigan and Mark of New York, New York, and Ruth Ellen who died in 1966. His surviving children and his six grandchildren all miss him a ton. 1/3"

Dr. Shuart was Hofstra's seventh president, serving from 1976 to 2001. There are few people who shared a more profound bond with Hofstra University, or had a more profound impact on the Hofstra community, than Dr. Shuart - as a student, an alumnus, a faculty member, an administrator and finally, as the University's longest-serving president. Under his leadership, Hofstra grew and expanded in many ways: enrollment increased; academic offerings and library holdings more than doubled; athletics grew to Division I status; our internationally respected presidential conferences began; new facilities, buildings and wings were constructed that more than doubled the University's physical space; the School of Communication was founded; and Hofstra became the first private university campus in the nation to be fully accessible to the physically challenged. In 2002 Hofstra Stadium was named in Dr. Shuart's honor. Dr. Shuart was also a dedicated public servant, serving as Nassau County commissioner of social services and deputy Nassau County executive from 1971 to 1975. He was recognized with Hofstra's Alumni Achievement and Alumnus of the Year awards, as well as the Long Island Association Medal of Honor.

2016-05-19T00:00:00Z,"WOOD--Timmy, a comedian, writer, one-time Ralph Lauren Model, and New York City's resident ""Man of Mirth,"" passed away on Saturday, May 14th in his home in Brooklyn, New York at the age of 32. Timmy started his comedy career in Houston before moving to New York City. He was a beloved performer at the Upright Citizens Brigade Theatre and traveled the country with the UCB TourCo. Timmy appeared on ""Jimmy Kimmel Live!,"" Funny or Die, Improv Everywhere, Fusion, and in countless UCB Comedy videos. Timmy loved Halloween and telling spooky stories around the campfire, so his family and friends are absolutely positive that Timmy Wood is now a ghost. Timmy Wood The Ghost's chief unfinished business will be to watch over his wife, Julie, who once swore that she and Timmy would never, ever date. They recently celebrated five years of marriage and the only blemish on their relationship was a rather lackluster performance on television's ""The Newlywed Game."" Timmy Wood The Ghost will also be joining his father, Jim, in looking after his mother, Terianne, his sister, Rebekah, and his brother, John. Even in the afterlife, Timmy Wood The Ghost will lovingly tend to his pet candles Howie Candel and LeBron Flames. (""Candles are the new pets."") Timmy Wood The Ghost's spooky spirit will always be felt at the UCB Theatre. It is said that if you listen closely after late Thursday night shows, you can still hear him uttering his annual comedy catchphrases, including ""Suck it down, Charlie Brown,"" ""Uhhhhhhhhhh... check please!"" ""HOLD THE SLAW,"" and ""DAH FOOK?!?"" Even in death, Timmy Wood The Ghost still stands by his controversial, nearly career- ending 2015 catchphrase ""I'll have one more picky for my ticky."" Now that he has shuffled off this mortal coil (Shakespeare, baby!), Timmy Wood The Ghost will have more time to tinker with his comprehensive ranking of Bond movie theme songs, create insane games with made-up rules that only he can understand, finally watch a regular season Houston Rockets game, research Illuminati conspiracy theories on the internet, defend ""Yeezus"" as his favorite Kanye West album, and drink Shinerbock in one of his many New York City ""secret spots."" Timmy will be missed dearly. And even though it was far too short, his time in this realm gets a perfect five out of five big, beautiful, man-beards. In lieu of flowers, Timmy's family asks that anyone wishing to celebrate his life of seemingly boundless love and positivity contribute to The Timmy Wood Comedy Memorial Fund at gofundme.com/timmywood.

2016-05-20T00:00:00Z,"WOOD--Timmy, a comedian, writer, one-time Ralph Lauren Model, and New York City's resident ""Man of Mirth,"" passed away on Saturday, May 14th in his home in Brooklyn, New York at the age of 32. Timmy started his comedy career in Houston before moving to New York City. He was a beloved performer at the Upright Citizens Brigade Theatre and traveled the country with the UCB TourCo. Timmy appeared on ""Jimmy Kimmel Live!,"" Funny or Die, Improv Everywhere, Fusion, and in countless UCB Comedy videos. Timmy loved Halloween and telling spooky stories around the campfire, so his family and friends are absolutely positive that Timmy Wood is now a ghost. Timmy Wood The Ghost's chief unfinished business will be to watch over his wife, Julie, who once swore that she and Timmy would never, ever date. They recently celebrated five years of marriage and the only blemish on their relationship was a rather lackluster performance on television's ""The Newlywed Game."" Timmy Wood The Ghost will also be joining his father, Jim, in looking after his mother, Terianne, his sister, Rebekah, and his brother, John. Even in the afterlife, Timmy Wood The Ghost will lovingly tend to his pet candles Howie Candel and LeBron Flames. (""Candles are the new pets."") Timmy Wood The Ghost's spooky spirit will always be felt at the UCB Theatre. It is said that if you listen closely after late Thursday night shows, you can still hear him uttering his annual comedy catchphrases, including ""Suck it down, Charlie Brown,"" ""Uhhhhhhhhhh... check please!"" ""HOLD THE SLAW,"" and ""DAH FOOK?!?"" Even in death, Timmy Wood The Ghost still stands by his controversial, nearly career- ending 2015 catchphrase ""I'll have one more picky for my ticky."" Now that he has shuffled off this mortal coil (Shakespeare, baby!), Timmy Wood The Ghost will have more time to tinker with his comprehensive ranking of Bond movie theme songs, create insane games with made-up rules that only he can understand, finally watch a regular season Houston Rockets game, research Illuminati conspiracy theories on the internet, defend ""Yeezus"" as his favorite Kanye West album, and drink Shinerbock in one of his many New York City ""secret spots."" Timmy will be missed dearly. And even though it was far too short, his time in this realm gets a perfect five out of five big, beautiful, man-beards. In lieu of flowers, Timmy's family asks that anyone wishing to celebrate his life of seemingly boundless love and positivity contribute to The Timmy Wood Comedy Memorial Fund at gofundme.com/timmywood.

2016-05-21T00:00:00Z,"TEMPERLEY--Joe, long regarded as one of jazz's leading baritone saxophonists, died on May 11 in New York City. He was 88. Temperley's 60-year career in jazz was highlighted by long stints in both the Duke Ellington Orchestra and the Jazz at Lincoln Center Orchestra. In addition to his own varied discography as a bandleader, and sharing a bandstand with Billie Holiday, Frank Sinatra, Ella Fitzgerald, Barbra Streisand, and many more, Temperley was a beloved educator who helped aspiring musicians grow both in the United States and his native Scotland. Temperley was born in the town of Lochgelly, in Fife, Scotland on September 20, 1927. His father was a bus driver - a rarity in a town where most men worked in the coalmines - and his mother took care of the household. For his fourteenth birthday he was given an alto saxophone by his older, trumpet- playing brother Bob. He took to the horn immediately, practicing whenever he wasn't working in a local butcher shop. By age 17, he had switched to tenor saxophone, and his success with an ensemble that won a big band competition in Glasgow landed him a spot in a Glaswegian jazz quintet. Temperley's talent quickly took him to London, where he played with some of Great Britain's leading jazz ensembles. In 1958, he switched to baritone saxophone to perform with trumpeter Humphrey Lyttelton's band - widely regarded as one of the best jazz ensembles outside of the United States - and the instrument soon came to be his instrument of choice. Temperley traveled with Lyttelton to America for the first time in 1959. That trip left an indelible impression on him. He decided to get back to the thriving New York City jazz scene as soon as possible. The move finally happened on December 16, 1965 when Temperley boarded the Queen Mary and set sail for the U.S. When he first arrived in New York, he stayed at the Bryant Hotel and sold transistor radios as he looked for gigs. His first regular job, obtained with help from friends pianist Nat Pierce and drummer Jake Hanna, was with famed bandleader Woody Herman's New Thundering Herd. That soon led to a spot in the Thad Jones/Mel Lewis Orchestra as well as gigs with luminaries like Clark Terry, Duke Pearson, and Joe Henderson who appreciated Temperley's lush, soulful sound. ""My approach to playing is purely vocal,"" Temperley once said. ""If you can get all the air out singing a note, there's no reason you can't do it on a saxophone."" Moving to the U.S. allowed Temperley to befriend one of his heroes, Harry Carney, the long-tenured baritone saxophone chair for Duke Ellington's orchestra. When Carney died in 1974 - just months after Ellington himself passed Temperley was asked to perform at the funeral, where he played the jazz legend's signature ""Sophisticated Lady."" Soon after, Mercer Ellington Duke's son, who'd stepped into his father's position as bandleaderasked Temperley to take Carney's place in the orchestra. That led to a fourteen-year stint with the world's most storied big band. ""My main influence was - and still is - the Duke Ellington Orchestra,"" Temperley told Smithsonian Magazine in 2011. ""That has always been my prime motivation for playing music, for playing jazz."" In 1988, a few years after he'd left the Ellington Orchestra to pursue other opportunities, Temperley received another life- shaping call. This time, it was to join Wynton Marsalis and the newly created Jazz at Lincoln Center Orchestra. Temperley occupied the JLCO's baritone saxophone chair for the next 28 years, touring the world many times over, serving both as the ensemble's elder statesman and the definitive model for the baritone saxophone's sound. Temperley taught on the faculty of the Juilliard School for Jazz Studies for many years. He was a mentor and co-founder of the FIFE Youth Jazz Orchestra program in Scotland, which now enrolls 70 young musicians, ages 7-17, playing in three full-size bands. He released many albums as a leader including Nightingale (1991), Sunbeam and Thundercloud with pianist Dave McKenna (1996), With Every Breath (1998), and Double Duke (1999). More recently, he released Cocktails for Two (2007) on Sackville and The Sinatra Songbook (2008) on Hep Jazz. His film soundtrack credits include Cotton Club, Biloxi Blues, Brighton Beach Memoirs, When Harry Met Sally, and Tune In Tomorrow. He is survived by his wife of 32 years, Laurie, his son Dr. Matthew Lurin, his sister Helen, and many nieces and nephews. 1/3"

After teaching for ten years, Al became assistant principal of Community Schools 54 and later 77. He was also the principal of several summer school programs. Al was a wise, supportive and diligent administrator. He was cherished by the staff in every school he worked. He never took a sick day! Al was an erudite man. He had many interests and hobbies that fulfilled his long life, including studying and investing in the stock market, collecting coins, playing chess and cards, gardening, painting, photography, classical music, opera, traveling. Al was a natural athlete. As a youngster, his baseball skills were good enough to earn him a tryout for a professional baseball team! He played tennis until he was 88! Al was a good natured, honest and gracious gentleman. He had a wonderful sense of humor and sharp memory that enabled him to recall and tell countless jokes at every occasion and at just the right time!

2016-05-22T00:00:00Z,"THOMPSON--Robert Torrey, a private equity investor and resident of New Canaan, CT, passed away peacefully on Sunday, May 15 in his home. He was 61. A devoted husband and father, Bob is survived by his wife, Frances (Bush-Brown) Thompson, and his children, Sarah M. Thompson and Augustus T. Thompson, both of New York City. He is also survived by his sister, F. Dana Thompson, of Denver, CO. Bob spent 40 years in the financial services industry, most recently as a Senior Advisor to Intermediate Capital Group, for whom he served as the Non-Executive Chairman of ICG Strategic Secondaries. Additionally, he served as a Senior Advisor/Board of Directors Member to multiple private equity general partners and a High Net Worth family office. Until 2012, Bob served as the Global Head of Alternative Investments for AIG Investments, which rebranded to PineBridge Investments upon its spinout from AIG in 2010. In this capacity, Bob was responsible for all private equity and hedge fund activities globally. Prior to AIG, Bob was a founder and Managing Partner of Ferrer Freeman Thompson & Co., LLC, a Greenwich, CT-based private equity platform. Previously, Bob was a Managing Director and Equity Group Leader at GE Capital Corporation where he was the founder of the GE Capital private equity business and developed GE Capital's private equity activities throughout the United States, Europe and Asia. Before joining GE Capital, Bob was a consultant at Bain & Co. in Boston, MA and a commercial lending officer at Chemical Bank in New York City, where his career began in 1976. Born in Boston, MA in 1954, Bob was raised in Andover, MA. He received an A.B. in Economics from Harvard College and an M.B.A. from the Stanford Graduate School of Business. Bob's childhood home was proximate to the playing fields of Phillips Academy, which fostered an early and lasting fanaticism with sports. Bob was a heralded student-athlete at Berkshire School and subsequently played varsity soccer, varsity golf, and junior varsity hockey at Harvard. He excelled in golf and numerous racquet sports well into his adult years. Friends and family will remember Bob most especially for his infectious personality, dry wit, and kind-hearted nature. His balance of obvious intellect and distinct approachability facilitated enduring friendships and profound impressions on those within his personal and professional lives. He was loved by many and will be deeply missed by all. A memorial service to celebrate Bob's life will be held at 11am on Saturday, June 18 at St. Mark's Episcopal Church in New Canaan, CT.

Born in 1920, he is the last of the children of Carmela Tosti and Salvatore Maccia who came from Italy and settled in New Jersey of America. He spent a large portion of his life as professor at Ohio State University and Indiana University at Bloomington teaching philosophy and research, so the legacy he leaves are his students and the extension of the thought of the great American Pragmatist Charles Sanders Peirce. Also, he was gifted artistically, musically and mechanically and so further enriched the lives of those he touched, particularly me, for I was his friend and lover since 1947. We were professors together at Ohio State University and Indiana University (even doing research and professional writing together). We traveled together (around the world twice) plus all our travels by land in our motor home (S.S. Grata), by air in our Cessna 182, and sea in our trawler, Chinita.

2016-05-22T00:00:00Z,"HINERFELD--Susan. Susan Hope Slocum Hinerfeld, died April 30 in Santa Monica, CA, at age 79. She is survived by her husband of nearly 59 years, Robert Elliot Hinerfeld; two sons, Daniel Slocum (Laura Kleinhenz) and Matthew Ben (Nora Jaskowiak, MD); and five grandchildren, Sophie Rose, Eli Milton, Theo Jonathan, Willa Belle and Maude Hall. Susan was born in New York City, August 6, 1936, to Milton Jonathan Slocum, MD and Belle Esther Slocum (nee, Gibralter). Milton often walked Susan to the Calhoun School in the morning, quizzing her on Latin along the way. Susan graduated from Calhoun in 1953 and from Wellesley College in 1957. In 1959, Susan and Robert moved from Cambridge, MA to Los Angeles, where Susan worked for the public relations counselor Elaine K. Sewell Jones, wife of architect A. Quincy Jones. To get the job, Susan took a one-question exam: name the middle initial of the first director of the Museum of Modern Art. Susan instantly replied ""H,"" for Alfred H. Barr, Jr., and began a job and a lifelong friendship with the Joneses. Through them she became acquainted with Ray and Charles Eames and developed a love of design and modernist architecture. Decades later, Susan's son Matthew worked for Ray on her final book project. Susan was a great reader, an elegant writer and an exacting editor. She was co-author, with her father, of Manhattan Country Doctor, a best-selling memoir of Dr. Slocum's 34-year medical practice in Hell's Kitchen (Scribner's, 1986). Susan edited Wellesley After-Images (1974) and was a regular book reviewer for the Los Angeles Times. She often edited Robert's appellate briefs. Susan used her love of language, literature, design, art and architecture to teach her sons and their friends to be better writers, better observers, and more creative people. Many of them credit Susan's encouragement, instruction and editorial rigor with getting them into college and graduate school and helping them launch successful careers. Susan invested time and energy in the progressive schools her children attended, Westland and Crossroads. She had a wide circle of friends, young and old, and her home was a special gathering place where lives intersected, ideas and laughter flourished, and those in need found refuge. Susan was charming, stylish, nurturing, funny, brilliant, playful, selfless and kind. She was adored by all who knew her and loved dearly by her family. As a toddler, when Susan's parents asked her to do something against her wishes, she replied: ""Has I has to?"" That, Susan said in recent months, was her question about dying. A memorial is planned for the fall. For information, contact Daniel Slocum Hinerfeld at: dhinerfeld@gmail.com. 1/3"
2016-05-22T00:00:00Z,"HOPKINS--Albert L.,Jr. Albert L. Hopkins, Jr., of Danbury, NH, and Palm Coast, FL, died on May 17th, 2016, at the Stuart F. Meyer Hospice House here. He was the son of the late Albert L. Hopkins, Sr., Esq, of Chicago, IL, and Florence (Odil) Hopkins, originally of Nashville, TN. The senior Hopkins was founding partner of the firm Hopkins Sutter. Raised in the city, the younger Hopkins completed his primary education at the Laboratory School of the University of Chicago. His secondary education was at Phillips Exeter Academy, in New Hampshire. He did his undergraduate work at Harvard University, earning a Bachelor's Degree in Engineering. A gifted mathematician, Albert Hopkins, Jr., continued at Harvard earning both his Masters and PhD at the Harvard Computational Laboratory. There he studied under the legendary Howard Aiken, considered by many as the Father of Digital Computing in America. In 1960 Albert Hopkins joined the MIT Instrumentation Laboratory, later known as the Draper Lab, where he was a colleague of Dr. Charles Stark Draper. At the lab Albert worked in the Digital Development Group, under Eldon C. Hall. His team members there included Ramon Alonso, Alan Green, and Hugh Blair-Smith, among many other pioneers of digital computing. Dr. Hopkins was a key member of the team that completed the contract with NASA to design the Apollo navigation program. Hopkins was in charge of guiding the Apollo spacecraft from the Earth to the Moon, and back. With Ramon, he designed and hand built the prototype Guidance and Navigation Computer (G&NC) used to perform that critical task. It should be remembered that digital electronics in the early 1960's bore little relation to the advanced IT science of today. Not only was Albert Hopkins' team at Draper Lab confined to the use of core memory, but they were also limited by the amount of space, the shape of that space, and the weight they would be allowed to put aboard the Command Module. Having designed the hardware it also fell to Hopkins to devise and write both the Operating System and Input/Output Language it would use to make the roughly 240,000 mile voyage with a course deviation of under one tenth of one percent. Following the success of the Apollo Program, Albert Hopkins remained at Draper for long enough to perform some of the earliest work on Fault Tolerant computer systems and computer controlled machining centers for clients such as Fiat. After his tenure at MIT, Hopkins joined with two other colleagues to form a private consulting practice known as ITP Computing. With his first wife, the late Bess (House) Hopkins, he is the father of four grown children and now six grandchildren. He was also married to Ellen (Berger) Hopkins. In 1980 Albert married Lynne Zaccaria. The Hopkins' moved to Danbury, NH, and set about learning the craft of pottery making. Together they opened The Danbury Pottery in 1989. Ever restless to take on new challenges, Albert decided to build the couple a home on the property they shared with Lynne's family. In typical fashion he taught himself the basics of Post and Beam construction and with the help of family members cut timber on the property and hewed it into beams using a combination of chain saws and Yankee Ingenuity. The result was a new barn and a custom designed year-round abode for the aspiring potters. In 2003 Dr. Hopkins presented with symptoms of Multiple Myeloma. He ultimately sought treatment at the Myeloma Institute of the University of Arkansas for Medical Sciences. Under the care of then Director Dr. Bart Barlogie, MD, PhD, Albert Hopkins faced the challenge to his health as he had always faced all other challenges. He was successful in holding off the ravages of the disease for far longer than the statistical average. His death, thirteen years later, was finally the result of complications associated with Myeloma. He could not have persevered for that time without the consultation and medical skills, in chronological order, of Dr. Becki Melton, MD, of Palm Coast; Bonnie Jenkins, RN; Nadine Baxter, APN; Dr. Giampaolo Talamo, MD; Mary Hickman, RN; and all the nurses and APN's of the Myeloma Institute. He also owes a debt of gratitude to Dr. Paul Dodd, MD, and his associates Dr. Kathleen B. Doughney, MD; Dr. Christopher Alexander, DO; and the entire professional staff of the Florida Cancer Specialists. Dr. Hopkins was a member of the Institute for Electrical and Electronic Engineers. He was also a Fellow of the American Association for the Advancement of Science. He was the author of numerous technical articles on subjects ranging from Math Theory to Practical Computing. He and his wife are major contributors to the Myeloma Institute, the South Danbury Christian Church, and fittingly the Stuart F. Meyer Hospice House. He is survived by his wife, Lynne Zaccaria Hopkins. He also leaves his children Terry Hopkins and his wife Mandy, of Winchester UK, Tom Hopkins, of New York City, Jay Hopkins, of Hyannis, MA, and Sarah Hopkins Samore, of Salt Lake City. He was the beloved brother of his late sister Catharine and her late husband, David Ruml. He was also the beloved brother of Nancy Hopkins Gerson, 92, and her husband Isak Gerson, of Chicago. He leaves nieces and nephews David J. Ruml and Elizabeth Hopkins Ruml, both of South Strafford, VT, and Susan Haskins and her husband Steven Dolloff of New York City, and the late Amy Gerson, of Chicago. He was the beloved grandfather of Benjamin Hopkins, of Los Angeles; Rebecca and Marina Hopkins of London; Theodore Samore, of Los Angeles; Samuel Samore, of Salt Lake City, and Eliza Samore, also of Salt Lake City. He will be remembered for his integrity, honesty, wit, humor, sincerity, charm, his love of playing piano, classical and folk guitar, and for his love of gardening.

2016-05-22T00:00:00Z,"TEMPERLEY--Joe, long regarded as one of jazz's leading baritone saxophonists, died on May 11 in New York City. He was 88. Temperley's 60-year career in jazz was highlighted by long stints in both the Duke Ellington Orchestra and the Jazz at Lincoln Center Orchestra. In addition to his own varied discography as a bandleader, and sharing a bandstand with Billie Holiday, Frank Sinatra, Ella Fitzgerald, Barbra Streisand, and many more, Temperley was a beloved educator who helped aspiring musicians grow both in the United States and his native Scotland. Temperley was born in the town of Lochgelly, in Fife, Scotland on September 20, 1927. His father was a bus driver - a rarity in a town where most men worked in the coalmines - and his mother took care of the household. For his fourteenth birthday he was given an alto saxophone by his older, trumpet- playing brother Bob. He took to the horn immediately, practicing whenever he wasn't working in a local butcher shop. By age 17, he had switched to tenor saxophone, and his success with an ensemble that won a big band competition in Glasgow landed him a spot in a Glaswegian jazz quintet. Temperley's talent quickly took him to London, where he played with some of Great Britain's leading jazz ensembles. In 1958, he switched to baritone saxophone to perform with trumpeter Humphrey Lyttelton's band - widely regarded as one of the best jazz ensembles outside of the United States - and the instrument soon came to be his instrument of choice. Temperley traveled with Lyttelton to America for the first time in 1959. That trip left an indelible impression on him. He decided to get back to the thriving New York City jazz scene as soon as possible. The move finally happened on December 16, 1965 when Temperley boarded the Queen Mary and set sail for the U.S. When he first arrived in New York, he stayed at the Bryant Hotel and sold transistor radios as he looked for gigs. His first regular job, obtained with help from friends pianist Nat Pierce and drummer Jake Hanna, was with famed bandleader Woody Herman's New Thundering Herd. That soon led to a spot in the Thad Jones/Mel Lewis Orchestra as well as gigs with luminaries like Clark Terry, Duke Pearson, and Joe Henderson who appreciated Temperley's lush, soulful sound. ""My approach to playing is purely vocal,"" Temperley once said. ""If you can get all the air out singing a note, there's no reason you can't do it on a saxophone."" Moving to the U.S. allowed Temperley to befriend one of his heroes, Harry Carney, the long-tenured baritone saxophone chair for Duke Ellington's orchestra. When Carney died in 1974 - just months after Ellington himself passed Temperley was asked to perform at the funeral, where he played the jazz legend's signature ""Sophisticated Lady."" Soon after, Mercer Ellington Duke's son, who'd stepped into his father's position as bandleaderasked Temperley to take Carney's place in the orchestra. That led to a fourteen-year stint with the world's most storied big band. ""My main influence was - and still is - the Duke Ellington Orchestra,"" Temperley told Smithsonian Magazine in 2011. ""That has always been my prime motivation for playing music, for playing jazz."" In 1988, a few years after he'd left the Ellington Orchestra to pursue other opportunities, Temperley received another life- shaping call. This time, it was to join Wynton Marsalis and the newly created Jazz at Lincoln Center Orchestra. Temperley occupied the JLCO's baritone saxophone chair for the next 28 years, touring the world many times over, serving both as the ensemble's elder statesman and the definitive model for the baritone saxophone's sound. Temperley taught on the faculty of the Juilliard School for Jazz Studies for many years. He was a mentor and co-founder of the FIFE Youth Jazz Orchestra program in Scotland, which now enrolls 70 young musicians, ages 7-17, playing in three full-size bands. He released many albums as a leader including Nightingale (1991), Sunbeam and Thundercloud with pianist Dave McKenna (1996), With Every Breath (1998), and Double Duke (1999). More recently, he released Cocktails for Two (2007) on Sackville and The Sinatra Songbook (2008) on Hep Jazz. His film soundtrack credits include Cotton Club, Biloxi Blues, Brighton Beach Memoirs, When Harry Met Sally, and Tune In Tomorrow. He is survived by his wife of 32 years, Laurie, his son Dr. Matthew Lurin, his sister Helen, and many nieces and nephews. 1/3"

The cherished daughter of Paula Firestone Ranow, Edna was the treasured wife of Maurice Jerome Hoffman of Bridgeport, whom she married on September 15, 1940, after her graduation from Vassar College. Edna and Maury, who lived their magnificent lives in Bridgeport and Fairfield, were perfect co-partners and co-paragons for 54 loving years, until Maury's death in 1995. We, Edna's children -- Elisabeth (Alan) Doft, Constance (Yves) de Balmann, Laurence Hoffman, and Bruce Hoffman, plus eight grandchildren -- Michael Doft, Jonathan Doft (Dr. Melissa), Rachel Doft (John Wareck), Raphael de Balmann (Courtney), Gabriel de Balmann, Paul Hoffman, Andrew Hoffman, Daniel Hoffman, plus five great-grandchildren -- Andrew and Alexander Doft, Eliza Wareck, Alexander and Natalie de Balmann -- have lost our mother's glowing presence, but we will never lose our memories of her unending kindness, selfless generosity, incisive intellect, and enthusiastic joie de vivre. Immersed in life-long learning and culture, she was equally committed to ""repairing the world."" Always contributing, effective, high-minded, and principled, she had a seriousness of purpose combined with an innate grace and lightness of touch which made her totally irresistible. She was the star that lit up our firmament, and she has left a stellar legacy for us all. Her life was -- and her memory will always remain -- an undying blessing. The funeral will be at 11am on Wednesday, May 25th, at Congregation Rodeph Sholom, 2385 Park Ave., Bridgeport, CT 06604.

Papert, a tenacious and courageous leader who, as President, led 42nd Street Development Corp. for 39 years. Throughout those years, Fred played a prominent role in transforming the landscape of New York City, particularly the West End of 42nd Street. A resourceful and inspired visionary, Fred launched a mission to transform derelict and abandoned buildings along 42nd Street into a mecca of theatrical art and restaurants, now known as ""Theatre Row."" An avid lover of the arts, Fred supported fledging theatre groups with grants funded by our organization. As a preservationist, Fred teamed up with Jackie Kennedy Onassis to win the fight to save Grand Central Station from the wrecking ball.

He was my fearless leader for the last 17 years of his illustrious tenure as Founder and President of 42nd Street Development Corporation. I learned invaluable lessons from him -- lessons that I didn't learn in college or graduate school. Papert taught me how to fight for what I believe in and to never, never give up. He liked it when I stood up to him appropriately. Working for Mr. Papert was like listening to an autobiography and the history of the city he loved. Although he was known as a demanding champion of preservation and renewal, Mr. Papert was an avid supporter of the arts and culture. He was a writer with quick wit and intellect. Mr. Papert loved his horses and the races. I knew the charming, gentle and compassionate Mr. Papert. He enjoyed gazing at the beauty of the earth as he drove his red BMW out to his beach home in Quogue. Mr. Papert loved his family and friends and his famous ""lunch dates"". I had a special relationship with Mr. Papert and I won't forget him. I will always remember his humor, his intellect and his books. Thank you Mr. Papert for being a great teacher. You had a long run here. You touched the lives of many. You were gifted with a charmed and highly productive life. Well done, Fred Papert. Well Done. Jacqui L. McMurray 1/3"
2016-05-25T00:00:00Z,"PAPERT--Fred. Visionaries can find a way to turn a privilege into a right...learning to play the piano has long been only a privilege. Fred Papert felt it should be a right for public school students, particularly in NYC. Not many people can say that they read an article about brain research and turned that experience into a program that has served more than 400,000 elementary school students in close to 300 public schools across NYC and beyond for nearly 20 years. Fred Papert did just that after a lifetime of courageous and successful projects. After reading an article in Newsweek in 1996 that mentioned the impact studying music could have on children's brain development, Fred gathered important thinkers on the subject and used his non-profit 42nd St. Development Corp. to lay the foundation for Music and the Brain. MATB is a program that continues to empower hundreds of music teachers and public schools by making learning the language of music and playing the piano/keyboard a core part of a public school child's educational week. Fred's daughter, Lisha Lercari, who has served as the Program Director for Music and the Brain along with her team members Lisala Beatty and Emina Nusbaum will forever be grateful for the positive changes he made to both the community and individual lives.

2016-05-29T00:00:00Z,"DOUGLAS--Paulette Joy. The fiery force that was Paulette Joy Douglas came into this world on March 18, 1950. Born to Helen and Hal in Philadelphia, PA, and raised in Bridgeton, NJ, with her brother Bobby, she graduated from Bridgeton High School in 1968. She had an endless passion for human rights and equality, and was involved in the major social movements of her time: she marched on Washington D.C., she burned her bras. After graduating from Temple University, Paulette embarked on an illustrious television career. She started as a makeup artist on the Mike Douglas Show, but quickly shifted into producing and directing. Paulette was a pioneer in this male- dominated field, and became one of the first female directors in news and sports. She was selected by the AFI's Directing Workshop for Women, for which she made her narrative directorial debut in the feature short The Couch, staring then-up-and-comer Julia Louis Dreyfus. Some of her greatest work was on the numerous featured specials which she produced and directed, including SITV's Vietnam: Long Time Coming, as well as countless productions during her tenure at Sports Illustrated Television. Her dynamic and compassionate work earned her five Emmys, and she left an everlasting impression on all the coworkers who bore witness to her intense passion and artistic vision. In 1987, Paulette married the love of her life, fellow television producer/director, Woody Freiman. Their union produced two daughters, Hannah and Halle Freiman, and one yellow lab, Yogurt. The couple raised their family on the Upper West Side of New York City. Her children were her pride, joy, and favorite source of anxiety. She adored her girls with a ferocious intensity, and she and Woody could not have been happier with the results of their two finest collaborations. In recent years Paulette focused on independent artistic endeavors, producing and directing two brilliant documentary features, The Peglegs of Stuyvesant High and The TEAM Makes a Play. She also continued her lifelong devotion to social justice and care for others: cooking dinners for a local homeless shelter, organizing a CSA, and journeying to Greece with Woody this past December to aid refugees fleeing Syria. In addition to her beloved brother, husband, and daughters, Paulette is survived by countless friends and family, including her half-brother Arthur, and cousins Pam Kaplow and Donald Douglass, who will miss her honesty, her fearlessness, her wisdom, her humor, her penchant for four-letter-words, her beauty, and her spirit. Losing her so soon and so suddenly was no one's plan, but Paulette never stuck to anyone's plan but her own. 1/3"

2016-06-01T00:00:00Z,"BILIK--Al. Age 93, passed away peacefully on May 28, 2016 in Washington, DC after a full, long and love-filled life. Al was born on September 27, 1922 in Brooklyn, NY to immigrants Jacob and Lena Bilik, worked in the family drug store on Coney Island, and graduated from James Madison High School. Al enlisted in the Navy at the age of 19 and served as a medical corpsman on the USS Hyde in the Pacific theatre of World War II, earning the Bronze Star. Al earned his Bachelor's Degree from Brooklyn College, where he met his first wife, Dorothy Seidman, who predeceased him. He later received a Master's Degree in Political Science from Columbia University. He began a long and distinguished career in the American labor movement in the 1950s as an organizer for the United Auto Workers in Connecticut and Kentucky. Settling in Cincinnati, Al raised his first family, served as Council Director for the American Federation of State, County and Municipal Employees and later as President of the AFL-CIO Labor Council, ran for city council with Dr. Albert Sabin as honorary campaign chairman, and tirelessly built bridges between the labor, anti-poverty and civil rights movements, including leading a contingent of activists to join Rev. Martin Luther King's march on Selma. In the early 1970s, Al moved to Washington, DC to serve as Director of Organizing for AFSCME and oversaw a period of significant nationwide membership growth for the union. He returned to New York City in the early 1980s, where he served as Victor Gotbaum's deputy at AFSCME's District Council 37, and met and was married to Mary Jane Wilson. Al and Mary Jane moved to Washington, DC in 1985, where they put down roots and raised their two sons. Al continued working to strengthen the labor movement, serving as President of the AFL-CIO's Public Employee Department and later as consultant for AFSCME District Council 20. He retired in 2011 at age 89, when kidney disease began to slow him down, but Al remained a force to be reckoned with, always ready to express an opinion or engage on the issues of the day, and never leaving any doubt of his unconditional love for his wife, children and grandchildren. Al's seemingly limitless energy for living life to the fullest, and his advocacy of basic human rights on the job and elsewhere, are an inspiration to all who have known and loved him. He is survived by his loving wife Mary Jane Wilson-Bilik of Washington, DC; daughter Lisa Bilik Forberg of Nashville, TN; sons James D. Bilik of Albany, NY, Michael Bilik of Brooklyn, and Benjamin Bilik of Washington, DC; grandchildren Daniel Forberg, Julia Forberg, Lena Gillern Bilik, and Henry Bilik; son-in-law Richard Forberg, daughter-in-law Mary Bilik, in-laws Pat and Bill Carr, and their daughters Jennifer and Madeleine.

2016-06-01T00:00:00Z,"McGOLDRICK--William J.,of Gaylordsville, CT, died at home on Sunday, May 29, 2016. He was born in New Milford, CT, on August 24, 1931, the oldest of three sons born to William F. McGoldrick and Margaret Lillis McGoldrick. He was raised on the McGoldrick Farm, which straddles the Naromiyocknowhusunkatankshunk Brook and Sherman/New Milford town line, owned by the family since 1884. Bill attended the one-room Gaylordsville School and New Milford High School, and graduated from Harvard University with honors in 1952 and Harvard Law School in 1955. Throughout those college years, he returned home every summer to be with his family and help on the farm. In 1955, Bill enlisted in the U.S. Navy. Lieutenant McGoldrick served with distinction for three years as an on-board air controller flying off aircraft carriers traveling to the Arctic and every port on the northern side of the Mediterranean including Gibraltar and Istanbul, plus a stop in Lebanon during the Lebanese Crisis in 1956 and 1957. In 1958, Bill embarked on a 30-year career at J.P. Morgan in New York City, rising through the ranks to Senior Vice President in the Trust & Investment Division. He married Phyllis Gruler in 1959 and settled in Brooklyn Heights, where they raised their son, Sean. But weekends and vacations were spent largely at the farm helping his parents and brother. In 1993, Bill and Phyllis retired to Sherman full-time, where he partnered with his brother, Dick, to take care of the family farm and keep it operating. He was also involved with the Sherman Historical Society, Sherman Chamber Ensemble, Naromi Land Trust, New Milford Visiting Nurse Association and Hospice, and Sacred Heart Catholic Church in Kent. Donations of land and conservation easements to Weantinoge Heritage guarantee that the land Bill loved will be forever preserved for future generations to enjoy. Bill's roots were well established and nourished in those formative years on the farm, where he learned the values of hard work, honesty, loyalty and dedication to family, farm and faith. He inherited his father's soft spoken manner, modesty and work ethic, and his mother's quest for the opportunities that education provided and curiosity to see the world beyond the horizon. Thriving in the competitive arenas of Harvard, the U.S. Navy and J.P. Morgan, Bill never forgot who he was or where he came from. Bill is survived by his wife, Phyllis; his son, Sean; and his brothers, Dave and Dick. A Mass of Christian burial will be celebrated on Friday, June 3, 2016 at 11am at Sacred Heart Church in Kent. Interment will be private. Calling hours will be held on Thursday, June 2nd from 5:00pm to 8:00pm at the Lillis Funeral Home, 58 Bridge Street, New Milford, CT.

2016-06-05T00:00:00Z,"NOLOP--Keith Bradley, died on May 31, 2016 in Los Angeles, CA from head injuries sustained in a tragic bicycle accident. He was 63. Dr. Nolop had a distinguished career of over 25 years in drug development from conception to approval with a focus on allergy, asthma, and cancer products. His work included the blockbuster drug Nasonex, a groundbreaking melanoma treatment, and highly-engineered cancer therapies. He also was the author of over 50 peer-reviewed articles and the recipient of several patents. Born in Minneapolis, MN in 1953, he moved with his family to Mobridge, SD in 1960, where he enjoyed a typical small town boyhood full of activities and games. However, he was not particularly athletic and from an early age, evinced an extraordinary interest in science and math. Rather than play with new toys, he was more likely to take them apart, just to see how they worked. Always a model student, he earned perfect grades from elementary school through college - a rare feat in the days before grade inflation. In high school he was an Eagle Scout, first chair baritone in All-State Band, a representative to Boy's State (where he captured first place in the comprehensive written examination), and the state's highest scorer in the National Merit Scholar competition. He graduated as top student in the Mobridge High School Class of 1971. He studied biology at the University of South Dakota, where he was Editor of the school newspaper (the Volante) and a member of Delta Tau Delta fraternity. He was elected to Phi Beta Kappa as a junior and graduated summa cum laude with a Bachelor of Science degree in 1975. His next stop was Vanderbilt University School of Medicine where, true to form, he was honored as first in his class. After receiving his Doctor of Medicine, he began a career in medical research and drug development, starting with a stint at the University of Louisville. Dr. Nolop spent over 11 years with Schering-Plough and then 13 years as Chief Medical Officer for three successful biotechnology companies: CoTherix, Plexxikon, and Kite Pharma. In recent years he was an independent consultant. Keith loved skiing, hiking (especially Yosemite), wine tasting, Latin music, international travel, movies, and playing the bass guitar. He also was active in animal rights organizations. Never married, he was engaged to Sonia Jimenez in 2011; but in another unspeakable tragedy, his betrothed drowned while they were vacationing in Costa Rica. After Sonia's death, Keith provided financial support and life advice to her adopted children, Roberto Jose Tercero and Martha Karina Tercero of San Francisco, CA. He is survived by his mother, Barbara Nolop, of Peoria, AZ; brothers Bruce (Susan) Nolop of New York, NY and Neil (Hege) Nolop of Houston, TX; and nephews Christopher, Michael, Andre, and Nathan Nolop.

2016-06-06T00:00:00Z,"NOLOP--Keith Bradley, died on May 31, 2016 in Los Angeles, CA from head injuries sustained in a tragic bicycle accident. He was 63. Dr. Nolop had a distinguished career of over 25 years in drug development from conception to approval with a focus on allergy, asthma, and cancer products. His work included the blockbuster drug Nasonex, a groundbreaking melanoma treatment, and highly-engineered cancer therapies. He also was the author of over 50 peer-reviewed articles and the recipient of several patents. Born in Minneapolis, MN in 1953, he moved with his family to Mobridge, SD in 1960, where he enjoyed a typical small town boyhood full of activities and games. However, he was not particularly athletic and from an early age, evinced an extraordinary interest in science and math. Rather than play with new toys, he was more likely to take them apart, just to see how they worked. Always a model student, he earned perfect grades from elementary school through college - a rare feat in the days before grade inflation. In high school he was an Eagle Scout, first chair baritone in All-State Band, a representative to Boy's State (where he captured first place in the comprehensive written examination), and the state's highest scorer in the National Merit Scholar competition. He graduated as top student in the Mobridge High School Class of 1971. He studied biology at the University of South Dakota, where he was Editor of the school newspaper (the Volante) and a member of Delta Tau Delta fraternity. He was elected to Phi Beta Kappa as a junior and graduated summa cum laude with a Bachelor of Science degree in 1975. His next stop was Vanderbilt University School of Medicine where, true to form, he was honored as first in his class. After receiving his Doctor of Medicine, he began a career in medical research and drug development, starting with a stint at the University of Louisville. Dr. Nolop spent over 11 years with Schering-Plough and then 13 years as Chief Medical Officer for three successful biotechnology companies: CoTherix, Plexxikon, and Kite Pharma. In recent years he was an independent consultant. Keith loved skiing, hiking (especially Yosemite), wine tasting, Latin music, international travel, movies, and playing the bass guitar. He also was active in animal rights organizations. Never married, he was engaged to Sonia Jimenez in 2011; but in another unspeakable tragedy, his betrothed drowned while they were vacationing in Costa Rica. After Sonia's death, Keith provided financial support and life advice to her adopted children, Roberto Jose Tercero and Martha Karina Tercero of San Francisco, CA. He is survived by his mother, Barbara Nolop, of Peoria, AZ; brothers Bruce (Susan) Nolop of New York, NY and Neil (Hege) Nolop of Houston, TX; and nephews Christopher, Michael, Andre, and Nathan Nolop. He was preceded in death by his father, Francis Nolop, in 2008. 1/3"

Born in Zurich, he moved to New York in 1940 with his parents and sister, where he grew up as an American teenager: attending high school in Manhattan; going to Summer Camp; and taking summer jobs as a delivery boy for Eclair. The family returned to Switzerland in 1944, yet the years in New York proved formative. American characteristics such as openness and drive melded with his European sensibility and warmth. Throughout his life he continued to spend long periods of time in the US - learning the textile business prior to joining his family's firm in the early 50's, attending Harvard University's AMP program in 1972, and as CEO of Phibro Energy Corporation and Executive Vice President of Salomon Brothers from 1986 to 1993, where he had joined in 1975.

2016-06-07T00:00:00Z,"PICKETT--Anna Lou. 1934 - 2016, longtime West Side resident, died May 10th of glioblastoma cancer in the company of her sisters Ruby Curro of Bonita Springs, FL, and Joan Wills of Washington, DC. She was 81. An accomplished educator, civil rights advocate, and civic activist. In addition to her sisters she is survived by a sister-in-law, cousins, nieces and nephews across the country. Born Anna Lou Lawson, she grew up in Gaston, IN, attended Franklin College and graduated from Ball State University. There she met her husband, Hugh D. Pickett, a campus Baptist Minister. The Picketts moved to Ann Arbor and in 1963 New York City for Hugh to become an executive of the Ministers and Missionary Benefits Board. He predeceased her in 1992. Anna Lou's professional life centered on the needs of students with disabilities, as a teacher and then a principal of a special school for disabled students denied an education. In 1979, she spearheaded the founding of the first-of-its-kind National Resource Center for Paraprofessionals at the City University of New York, now housed at the University of Utah. Her leadership sparked national voluntary practice standards for paraprofessionals which have been adopted or used as a model in most states and school districts throughout the country. Active in the New York City Reform Democratic civil rights and anti- war crusades of the 1960s, she was elected a Democratic District Leader in 1969. She was the Assistant Commissioner for Community Affairs at the Environmental Protection Administration of New York during the Lindsay administration. In 1974 she was the Campaign Manager for Mary Anne Krupsak's successful run as the first female Lieutenant Governor of New York. During that campaign she mentored Gale Brewer, now the Borough President of Manhattan. Later she served on Manhattan Community Board 5. She helped establish landmark status for several theaters and always enjoyed telling, with humor, about the process to establish landmark status for the Empire State Building. Later she became an active member of Citizens Union and active supporter of the West Side Campaign Against Hunger. She was a longtime resident, board member, and friend to the staff and residents of the 470 West End Co-Op. In the late 1960s, she was the first woman elected to a leadership position as Moderator of Judson Memorial Church, where she maintained a longstanding, faithful membership. Anna Lou valued and maintained strong relationships, and served as a mentor to many within her family, profession, and community. She was the glue that held the family together, maintained active links with Gaston High classmates, a high school exchange student from Germany and now three generations of his family consider her a ""second mother"" as does a range of a younger generation from her summer Shelter Island House family.

2016-06-08T00:00:00Z,"O'SULLIVAN--Sonya S.,98, died at her home in Mamaroneck on June 3. Born in New York City to B.P. and Adeline Jaffe Schulberg, she moved with her parents and older brother Budd to Los Angeles, where her father was head of production at Paramount Studios. Sonya came to love sun, horses, dogs and Malibu, where Ad built one of the first houses. At the insistence of their mother, who had a literary agency in NYC from 1945 until 1977, Sonya, Budd and younger brother Stuart became writers. She attended The Progressive School, co-founded by her mother. After her parents' divorce, Sonya attended schools in Paris, Geneva and London. She started Sarah Lawrence but left at 19 when Scribners published her first novel (Maxwell Perkins was her editor). Budd's first novel, What Makes Sammy Run, made a bigger splash and Budd went on to success as a screenwriter (On the Waterfront). Sonya was married to attorney Ben O'Sullivan from 1941 until his death in 1998. Sadly, their son John O'Sullivan died in 2010. Her dear friends, brothers Budd and Stuart, also predeceased her. She is survived by other close friends: her daughter Dr. Chris O'Sullivan of NYC and Mamaroneck, Budd's and Stuart's children, among them Vicky Kingsland, Benn, Sandra, K.C., Peter and Jonathan Schulberg; her nieces Elizabeth Frank and Beth O'Sullivan; and her grandchildren Sarah and Kate O'Sullivan and great-grandson Will McCullough of Washington, DC and Betsy Schulberg. Wherever she lived, she adopted dogs and cats, tended wild animals, created gardens (on Martha's Vineyard and in Mamaroneck). She published short stories and recently completed a witty sad novel with perfectly constructed sentences about growing up in Hollywood. She was buried in the West Tisbury Cemetery on Martha's Vineyard. A reception will be held at her home in Mamaroneck in mid June.

2016-06-08T00:00:00Z,"BLUMBERG--Rhoda. Died at home on June 6th at age 98. Award-winning author of non-fiction for young adults; enthusiastic wife, mother, grandmother and friend. Raised in Crown Heights, Brooklyn. After graduating from Adelphi College in 1937, Rhoda became a ""career girl"". She produced several programs for CBS radio and later wrote feature articles for several national magazines. In 1944, she met Gerald Blumberg, a successful attorney, and they married six months later. Moving from Brooklyn in 1951 to a farm in what was then a rural part of Westchester County, Rhoda dedicated the next 20+ years to raising their four children. She enjoyed teaching her children the joys of nature and sharing her passion for classical music, travel and tennis. When her youngest child entered college in the early 1970s, her interest in history and the exhilaration of research triumphed, and Rhoda returned to her typewriter.

A native New Yorker, he was born in the shadow of Washington Square and later moved to the Upper West Side with his parents. Classified 4-F by the Selective Service in World War II due to a defective heart valve, Donald sat out the conflict at Oberlin College, graduating in 1946. ""Having a desire to write but little creative talent, I decided to try journalism,"" he later wrote. He started with the daily Ossining Citizen Register as its only reporter and soon moved to the Pittsburgh Press, which published five editions a day. After working there for a few years, he concluded that the paper's courthouse coverage was weak and applied to law school, figuring he would return to newspapers upon graduation. In 1957 he completed his degree at Columbia University Law, graduating with honors. Unable resist the law's gravitational pull, he accepted a job with Simpson Thacher & Bartlett and worked there from 1957 to 1984, largely representing public corporations. A senior partner with the firm, he was asked in 1984 to join senior management at Gulf + Western Industries, an early conglomerate that he had represented as outside counsel for 10 years. He served as Executive Vice President, Chief Counsel, and Chief Administrative Officer until the company, by then named Paramount Communications, Inc., was sold in 1994. He returned to Simpson Thacher & Bartlett after working for a year with Paramount's former board chairman, Martin Davis, who had started an investment boutique. Donald was a close advisor to late Movado Group founder Gedalio (Gerry) Grinberg and sat on the Movado Board for more than 25 years. Throughout his career, Donald's outside interests centered on the arts, literature, and libraries. He served for 25 years on the New York Landmarks Conservancy Board, including a term as chairman. In 2006 he was given the Conservancy's Chairman's Award. He served on numerous other boards, including the Library Company at Philadelphia, the Larchmont Library, the Morgan Library, the American Antiquarian Society, The Writers Room, the Roundabout Theatre Company, the Dictionary of American Regional English, Volunteer Lawyers for the Arts, the Heye National Museum of the American Indian - New York, the Museum of the City of New York, the Library of America, the Academy of American Poets, the Grolier Club, the National Building Museum, the American Academy in Rome, the American Ballet Theatre, the Gainsborough Studios, the New Criterion, and the Yale Edition of the Boswell Papers. In 1948 Donald married social worker Patricia Perry, beginning a 67-year union that he called the smartest decision of his life. His private interests, other than reading and his wife's opinion, included a collection of 20th Century images of people reading: prints, drawings, photographs, oils, watercolors, sculptures, etc. His late mother Gertrude Bergel Oresman was assistant to the editor of The Theater Magazine, and his late father A. Louis Oresman, was an attorney, C.P.A., and a financial advisor for a number of privately held corporations. He is survived by his wife Patricia; his brother, Stephen B. Oresman (Darien, CT); two sons, Thomas P. Oresman (Kent, WA) and Craig P. Oresman (Los Lunas, NM); daughter, Alison Oresman Wilson (Bellevue, WA); seven grandchildren, two step-grandchildren, and six great-grandchildren.

2016-06-09T00:00:00Z,"PUNNETT--R. John. Real Estate developer R. John Punnett died peacefully on Monday, June 6th at his home in Manhattan. He was 89 years old. Born in Zemun, Yugoslavia on February 8, 1927 to Tamara Gert and RAF pilot Schuyler Punnett, John and his sister Lydia were raised first in Greece, and later moving to Nantes, France where they lived during the German occupation. Being fluent in English, French, and Russian, he joined the RAF at age 17 and was stationed in Cairo and in Baghdad working in the Intelligence division. At the end of the war he was granted a full scholarship to attend the University of Cambridge, where he earned a BA in Russian literature. In 1956 he joined his sister in New York where he remained throughout his life. With a loan from his mother, in 1962 he began a career in real estate and founded Punnett Realty Company, eventually owning and managing up to 30 buildings largely centered in the Yorkville neighborhood. Always dressed in his trademark English suits, John was extremely respected in his field and known by everyone as a true gentleman. This was reflected by the fact that most of his employees had been with him for several decades. His work ethic was inspiring to many. Rarely taking a day off, he continued to go to his office until recently. There were few things John enjoyed more than spending time with his numerous friends and growing family and he described his six grandchildren as his ""brood"". He was most at peace in his Southampton home, where he maintained a residence for over four decades. He was predeceased by his sister Lydia Wasserman and is survived by his wife Carol, his son Anthony, daughters Dominique, Daniela, and his grandchildren Tatiana, Alexi, Kayden, Lucas, Olivia, and Alexandra. John will be missed for his generosity, his dry sense of humor, his keen intellect, and his love of the arts. He will be remembered by his family as a great father, teacher, and wonderful provider. Funeral services will be held at Brockett Funeral Home in Southampton on Saturday, June 11th, beginning at 10am. Memorial donations to the R. John Punnett Foundation, 107 Lee Ave., Southampton, NY 11968 would be appreciated. 1"

2016-06-09T00:00:00Z,"MIGDAL--Lester Charles, died May 31 at his home of 60 years on 92nd Street in New York City. For the last 53 years, he also spent as much time as he could at his farm in Washington County, NY. Lester was born February 8, 1918 to David and Helen Migdal in Brooklyn, NY. He attended public schools in Brooklyn and graduated from City College of New York, where he studied philosophy, and from Harvard Law School. His marriage of 28 years to Ellen Marcus MigdaI ended on her death in August, 1970. His second marriage of 38 years to Eleanor Jackson Burt Migdal ended on her death in March, 2013. He is survived by five children: Joanna Migdal, Eliza Migdal, David Migdal, Kaethe Burt-O'Dea and Sarah Burt, twelve grandchildren, nine great- grandchildren, and his brother, Dr. Walter Migdal. Lester served during the Second World War as a captain in the Army combat engineers. After the Battle of the Bulge, he commanded a company that under heavy fire built one of the pontoon bridges across the Rhine River which the allied armies crossed to defeat Germany; Lester loved the law, which he practiced in New York City for over 50 years, at his own firm. His cases ranged from the defense of a victim of the McCarthy witch hunts to the representation of extended families, in all legal matters from marriage and children to death and taxes, to more public matters argued and won at the U.S. Supreme Court. Many of his clients became his close friends. Lester collected thousands of books. With insatiable curiosity and a lifetime of insomnia, he read them all. He was particularly interested in literature, criticism and poetry. In his later years, intensely missing both his wives he found special solace in poetry. Lester valued his close relationship with his family and friends. A few nights before he died he played poker with a group of friends in a game that had lasted forty years. Lester will be remembered for his intelligence, wit, fearlessness, and gentility. He maintained his talent for respectful kindness, and the easy and intense connections with others which flowed from that, until the day he died. A memorial will be held for Lester later this summer at the Harvard Club, 35 W. 44th St., New York City. 1/3"

2016-06-09T00:00:00Z,"O'SULLIVAN--Sonya S.,98, died at her home in Mamaroneck on June 3. Born in New York City to B.P. and Adeline Jaffe Schulberg, she moved with her parents and older brother Budd to Los Angeles, where her father was head of production at Paramount Studios. Sonya came to love sun, horses, dogs and Malibu, where Ad built one of the first houses. At the insistence of their mother, who had a literary agency in NYC from 1945 until 1977, Sonya, Budd and younger brother Stuart became writers. She attended The Progressive School, co-founded by her mother. After her parents' divorce, Sonya attended schools in Paris, Geneva and London. She started Sarah Lawrence but left at 19 when Scribners published her first novel (Maxwell Perkins was her editor). Budd's first novel, What Makes Sammy Run, made a bigger splash and Budd went on to success as a screenwriter (On the Waterfront). Sonya was married to attorney Ben O'Sullivan from 1941 until his death in 1998. Sadly, their son John O'Sullivan died in 2010. Her dear friends, brothers Budd and Stuart, also predeceased her. She is survived by other close friends: her daughter Dr. Chris O'Sullivan of NYC and Mamaroneck, Budd's and Stuart's children, among them Vicky Kingsland, Benn, Sandra, K.C., Peter and Jonathan Schulberg; her nieces Elizabeth Frank and Beth O'Sullivan; and her grandchildren Sarah and Kate O'Sullivan and great-grandson Will McCullough of Washington, DC and Betsy Schulberg. Wherever she lived, she adopted dogs and cats, tended wild animals, created gardens (on Martha's Vineyard and in Mamaroneck). She published short stories and recently completed a witty sad novel with perfectly constructed sentences about growing up in Hollywood. She was buried in the West Tisbury Cemetery on Martha's Vineyard. A reception will be held at her home in Mamaroneck in mid June. Sonya would have liked contributions to one of the many animal organizations she supported, including the Doris Day Animal Foundation, 8033 Sunset Boulevard, Suite 845, Los Angeles, CA 90046 or donate in memoriam online at DDAF. 1/3"
2016-06-09T00:00:00Z,"BLUMBERG--Rhoda. Died at home on June 6th at age 98. Award-winning author of non-fiction for young adults; enthusiastic wife, mother, grandmother and friend. Raised in Crown Heights, Brooklyn. After graduating from Adelphi College in 1937, Rhoda became a ""career girl"". She produced several programs for CBS radio and later wrote feature articles for several national magazines. In 1944, she met Gerald Blumberg, a successful attorney, and they married six months later. Moving from Brooklyn in 1951 to a farm in what was then a rural part of Westchester County, Rhoda dedicated the next 20+ years to raising their four children. She enjoyed teaching her children the joys of nature and sharing her passion for classical music, travel and tennis. When her youngest child entered college in the early 1970s, her interest in history and the exhilaration of research triumphed, and Rhoda returned to her typewriter. During the next 30 years, she wrote and composed over 25 non-fiction books. She had an uncanny ability to find and incorporate fascinating anecdotes that brought history to life for millions of young adults (and their parents). Her books received numerous awards, including the Boston Globe Horn Book Award, the Newbery Honor Medal, Orbis Pictus Award for Outstanding Non-Fiction for Children, and multiple Golden Kite awards. Her books included ""Commodore Perry in the Land of the Shogun"" (1985), ""The Incredible Journey of Lewis and Clark"" (1987), ""The Great American Gold Rush"" (1989), ""Shipwrecked! The True Adventures of a Japanese Boy"" (2001), and ""York's Adventures with Lewis and Clark: An African-American's Part in the Great Expedition"" (2004). Rhoda also partnered on several books with friend and renowned illustrator, Murray Tinkelman, including ""The Truth About Dragons"" (1980) and ""Backyard Bestiary"" (1979). Jerry Blumberg died in 2009 shortly after their 64th wedding anniversary. Rhoda's life is celebrated by a large family, including four children and their spouses: Larry Blumberg and Robin Lynn, Rena Blumberg, Alice and David Rubin, and Leda Blumberg and Steve Cole; nine grandchildren: Daniel Blumberg, Carla Steckman, Ilana Blumberg, William Gottlieb, Osheana Tashombe, Gregory Rubin, Amalia Rubin, Dana Rocco and Eliza Volk; ten great-grand- children; and her best friend and sister, Cynthia. She is the last to pass of her Adelphi College gang: Betty, Estelle, Gladys, Mickey, Mimi, and Norma. Funeral will be on Friday, June 10, 2016 at 11am at Temple Israel of Northern Westchester, Glengary Road, Croton-on-Hudson, NY. Burial will follow at Sharon Gardens Cemetery, Valhalla, New York. Shiva plans will be announced at the funeral. 1/3"

While ovarian cancer may have taken her life, she won the battle, fighting with dignity, humor and grace. Until the very end, she remained the strong, happy, beautiful and courageous Paige that we all loved, unafraid and confident in her faith in God. Paige's personality and smile radiated happiness and compassion. She laughed loudly and often and she gave freely without expecting anything in return. Her beautiful spirit will live on in her five children that she absolutely adored and in the memories of countless people that she touched. A loving and devoted wife, mother, daughter, sister and friend, she is survived by an adoring husband of 17 years, Tripp and their five incredible children Basil (13), Bennett (12), Tate (10), Ivy (9) and Byron (5) of New York City; parents Mary Faye and Donnie Ethington and brother, Tim, of Shelbyville, Kentucky; mother-in-law, Virginia Hardy of Roswell, Georgia; sister-in-law, Heather Perry and husband Dan, niece Leah and nephew Levi of Marietta, Georgia. Paige also leaves behind numerous aunts, uncles and cousins. Raised in Shelbyville, Kentucky she is a graduate of Shelby County High School and the University of Kentucky, where she pledged Delta Delta Delta Sorority. She gave her time generously to organizations in support of her faith, family and friends, including serving on the Women's Committee Board of Directors of the Central Park Conservancy, on the Women's Committee at St. James Episcopal Church, on the Associate's Committee at Doubles, and as an active parent at the Episcopal School, the Browning School and the Convent of the Sacred Heart. A funeral service in celebration of Paige's life and legacy will be held at First Baptist Church in Shelbyville, Kentucky on Tuesday June 14, 2016 at 2:00pm. Public visitation is from 11:11am until 2:00pm. The Reverend Maurice Hollingsworth and the Reverend Bob Vasser will be officiating. Interment will occur at Grove Hill Cemetery in Shelbyville following the service. A memorial service will be held in New York on Thursday June 16, 2016 at 11:11am at St. James' Episcopal Church located at 865 Madison Avenue. As her friends know, she felt surrounded by angels at that time every day.

They were happily married for 65 years and are survived by Themis' sister, Olga; their children Peter, Ted Jr. and his wife Tamara, Jamie and his wife Judy; their grandchildren Julia and her husband Joey, Laura, Kara and her fiance, Conor; and their great grandchild Caroline. The second son of Panos Dimon (Papademitrou), an emigre from Smyrna, Turkey and Theonia Mylonas, Ted was born on January 3, 1931 and grew up in New York City. For 65 years, he developed a successful career as a top stock broker and financial advisor, mentoring many others in the business and building a first-rate team of partners who have been with him for many years. He also served as a Trustee on the Board of the St Luke's Orchestra Society and the School for Strings and provided pro bono financial advice to numerous non-profits. Themis Anastasia Kalos was born on August 26, 1931, the third daughter of Jimmy Kalos and Iphegnia Smyrnis, both emigres from the Greek Peloponnese. When her children left for college, Themis completed her Bachelor's degree at New School and earned her Master's degree in Psychology at Teachers College.

She was a graduate of the Horace Mann School in 1987 and attended Barnard College at Columbia University. She acquired her Masters in Special Education and became a schoolteacher, where she devoted her time to teach underprivileged kids.

She is survived by her mother Thelma, her sister Sharon, her brothers Philip and Paul, her nephews Richie and Jaxon, and her niece Stephanie. She was the godmother to Robert, Joel, and Johana, and friend to their mother Wendy, all whom loved her dearly. She was loved and taken care of by her boyfriend Richard, who was by her side till the end. On Sunday, June 26th there will be a reception at the River Palm Terrace in Fair Lawn to celebrate her life and remember her for the wonderful human being that she was. We ask that in lieu of flowers, the funds get redirected in the form of a donation to the American Cancer Society, to support those that continue fighting this arduous battle. Her spirit, her thirst for life, her unconditional love, and her genuineness will keep her memory alive in our hearts for eternity. 1/3"

2016-06-12T00:00:00Z,"ORESMAN--Donald (1925-2016), attorney, businessman and civic leader, died peacefully May 24 at his Midtown apartment. A native New Yorker, he was born in the shadow of Washington Square and later moved to the Upper West Side with his parents. Classified 4-F by the Selective Service in World War II due to a defective heart valve, Donald sat out the conflict at Oberlin College, graduating in 1946. ""Having a desire to write but little creative talent, I decided to try journalism,"" he later wrote. He started with the daily Ossining Citizen Register as its only reporter and soon moved to the Pittsburgh Press, which published five editions a day. After working there for a few years, he concluded that the paper's courthouse coverage was weak and applied to law school, figuring he would return to newspapers upon graduation. In 1957 he completed his degree at Columbia University Law, graduating with honors. Unable to resist the law's gravitational pull, he accepted a job with Simpson Thacher & Bartlett and worked there from 1957 to 1984, largely representing public corporations. A senior partner with the firm, he was asked in 1984 to join senior management at Gulf + Western Industries, an early conglomerate that he had represented as outside counsel for 10 years. He served as Executive Vice President, Chief Counsel, and Chief Administrative Officer until the company, by then named Paramount Communications, Inc., was sold in 1994. He returned to Simpson Thacher & Bartlett after working for a year with Paramount's former board chairman, Martin Davis, who had started an investment boutique. Donald was a close advisor to late Movado Group founder Gedalio (Gerry) Grinberg and sat on the Movado Board for more than 25 years. Throughout his career, Donald's outside interests centered on the arts, literature, and libraries. He served for 25 years on the New York Landmarks Conservancy Board, including a term as chairman. In 2006 he was given the Conservancy's Chairman's Award. He served on numerous other boards, including the Library Company at Philadelphia, the Larchmont Library, the Morgan Library, the American Antiquarian Society, The Writers Room, the Roundabout Theatre Company, the Dictionary of American Regional English, Volunteer Lawyers for the Arts, the Heye National Museum of the American Indian - New York, the Museum of the City of New York, the Library of America, the Academy of American Poets, the Grolier Club, the National Building Museum, the American Academy in Rome, the American Ballet Theatre, the Gainsborough Studios, the New Criterion, and the Yale Edition of the Boswell Papers. In 1948 Donald married social worker Patricia Perry, beginning a 67-year union that he called the smartest decision of his life. His private interests, other than reading and his wife's opinion, included a collection of 20th Century images of people reading: prints, drawings, photographs, oils, watercolors, sculptures, etc. His late mother Gertrude Bergel Oresman was assistant to the editor of The Theater Magazine, and his late father A. Louis Oresman, was an attorney, C.P.A., and a financial advisor for a number of privately held corporations. He is survived by his wife Patricia; his brother, Stephen B. Oresman (Darien, CT); two sons, Thomas P. Oresman (Kent, WA) and Craig P. Oresman (Los Lunas, NM); daughter, Alison Oresman Wilson (Bellevue, WA); seven grandchildren, two step-grandchildren, and six great-grandchildren. He was preceded in death by his older brother, Roger B. Oresman, of Manhattan, a longtime partner at the Milbank, Tweed, Hadley & McCloy law firm; an infant daughter, Eliza Lynn; and great-grandson, Donny Wade. A memorial will be held September 10, 2016.

2016-06-12T00:00:00Z,"HENOCH--Arthur Saul, 90 years old, died peacefully at his home in New York City on January 22, 2016. Born in Newark, NJ, he was married to wife Dee for 59 loving years. After his freshman year at Rutgers in 1941, Art enlisted in the U.S. Navy and volunteered for a special naval warfare unit known as the Beach Jumpers. Commanded by the actor Douglas Fairbanks, Jr., they were trained in the military art of deception, diversion and psychological warfare. A few dozen men in specially equipped air-sea rescue boats could fool the enemy into believing they were being attacked by a 70,000 man amphibious landing force. These units raised hell with German coastal defenses throughout the Mediterranean and kept the enemy off-balance while the Allies carried out the invasions of Italy and southern France. Arthur was one of the last surviving members. After the war, he graduated from George Washington University with a BA in Business and joined his father and brother Herb in the dry cleaning business. He spent 20 years building Bond Cleaners, which serviced a large portion of New Jersey. Arthur left the business in the 1960's to earn an MA in Human Relations from NYU. In 1971, while continuing his Ph.D studies, he became a Financial Officer at Essex County College and devoted the next 37 years to enhancing the reputation of this educational institution in downtown Newark. He served in a number of other capacities: Associate Professor-Social Sciences Division, Director of Counseling and Advisement, counselor in the Business Division, before retiring at age 83. Arthur was a role model and inspiring mentor to students, faculty and administrators. He also maintained a psychotherapy practice in NYC. Arthur was the first to offer a helping hand and had a kind word for everyone. All who knew and loved him benefited from his warm heart, humorous spirit and generous nature. He is deeply missed. Arthur is survived by his sister Sandra Bernstein, daughters Susan and Karen and son Gary, seven grandchildren and sons-in-law Jay Coggeshall and David Ryugo. 1/3"

While ovarian cancer may have taken her life, she won the battle, fighting with dignity, humor and grace. Until the very end, she remained the strong, happy, beautiful and courageous Paige that we all loved, unafraid and confident in her faith in God. Paige's personality and smile radiated happiness and compassion. She laughed loudly and often and she gave freely without expecting anything in return.

Paige also leaves behind numerous aunts, uncles and cousins. Raised in Shelbyville, Kentucky she is a graduate of Shelby County High School and the University of Kentucky, where she pledged Delta Delta Delta Sorority. She gave her time generously to organizations in support of her faith, family and friends, including serving on the Women's Committee Board of Directors of the Central Park Conservancy, on the Women's Committee at St. James Episcopal Church, on the Associate's Committee at Doubles, and as an active parent at the Episcopal School, the Browning School and the Convent of the Sacred Heart.

2016-06-12T00:00:00Z,"LOUBE--Shirley Phyllis, Born February 22, 1920, died June 8, 2016. As vital, connected and engaged in her last days as she was in all of her 96 years, Shirley Phyllis Loube led a life filled with adventure, glamor and dedicated to philanthropy. Shirley was born and raised in San Francisco, the daughter of Consuelo Maria Carlos Camacho and Manuel Ricardo Lombardero. Immediately upon graduation from Mission High School, Shirley set out for Hollywood and landed a contract with MGM Studios. Working under the stage name Dana Marshall, she played small roles in several memorable films of the 1940s, including ""Meet Me in St. Louis,"" ""The Philadelphia Story,"" ""Kismet"" and ""The Great Flamarion."" In addition to the movies, Shirley was very proud of her work on the stage at the Pasadena Playhouse and the Mercury Players. She also appeared in roles in early television plays. While in Los Angeles, Shirley first lived with her aunt and uncle in the valley, but the commute (and chaperonage) proved daunting, so she jumped at the offer from her friend Maria Rivas to come live in Beverly Hills with her. Maria's mother was Marlene Dietrich, so the next three years were memorable. It was a glamorous time, with chauffeured rides to a factory, where the girls worked making planes for the war effort. There were long days at M.G.M, but also social events in the evenings, where many of the luminaries of the day gathered around the radio at the Dietrich home to hear news of the war in Europe. However, Hollywood proved no match for Shirley's longtime love interest, Irving Loube, and she rejoined him in the Bay Area in 1946 to embark upon a lifetime of love, hard work, success and fun. In her newlywed years, Shirley worked in the advertising department at the San Francisco Examiner, where she demonstrated a magical knack for salesmanship. She put Irving through law school, of which she remained very proud. Her husband went on to become a prominent attorney and businessman. When she concluded that her Irv was overworking, Shirley threatened to leave unless he developed a relaxing hobby. In response, Irving took up sailboat racing and became, with Shirley's unwavering support and encouragement, an accomplished yachtsman. Irv mounted and won many sailboat racing campaigns around the world. Shirley was the chief cheerleader, entertaining countless crews and rival boat owners over the years. Shirley and Irv supported many civic endeavors, including the presidential campaign of John F. Kennedy. The Loubes were instrumental in establishing the Oakland Symphony, the Foundation for Cardiac Research at U.C.S.F., the C.P.M.C. Foundation, and the Multiple Myeloma Research Foundation. They were also enthusiastic supporters of the San Francisco Symphony, among many other arts organizations. Shirley was an effective fundraiser and board member, using her gifts of charm, persuasion, persistence and effervescence to aid many worthy causes. In recent years, Shirley was a champion of the Marin Theater Company and thoroughly enjoyed producing several shows there. Shirley is deeply missed by all who came into contact with her. She was preceded in death by her beloved spouse of 55+ years, Irving Loube, and is survived by her adored children, Garrett Loube (Marcia Rodgers) and Suzanne Darley (Mark Darley), and by her grandchildren James Darley and Miranda Darley. She leaves behind countless friends and admirers of her great good humor, wisdom, indomitable spirit, elegant style and joie de vivre. 1/3"

And with him goes another part of my life and the lives of many others who lived with or worked for him over the years. In 1955, I joined a predecessor company... Laurence M. Marks & Company... that was located at 48 Wall Street. Dwight/ Dick/ and John were there and all of us remained with that renowned investment research firm until 1959 when the surviving partners of Mr. Marks' company elected to be acquired by a West Coast retail brokerage house: Dean Witter. It was thus that Faulkner, Dawkins & Sullivan was created and the firm prospered through the 1960's and early 1970's. FD&S was acquired by Sandy Weill's Shearson Co. in 1977... at something less than 1/2 of Book Value. Three years later, American Express bought Shearson at a significant premium. Subsequently, John created an asset management firm... SuIlivan Morrissey & Mickle... that existed through the date of his passing on 23 May 2016. Even though we all had taken separate paths some time during the 1970's-1980's, I know that John continued to be respected by all in the investment community who knew and/or had worked with him. For those who built careers on Wall Street from the 1950's onward, ""the wagons once again have circled ever closer."" Nevertheless, John F. Sullivan will live on in all of our memories. Robert P.

2016-06-16T00:00:00Z,"MANNING--Constance. Constance Howland Manning, a resident of Smith Ranch Homes in the city of San Rafael, California, passed away peacefully on June 7, 2016, after an extended and difficult illness. She was born on June 12, 1927, the daughter of Horace Tomlinson Howland and Adelaide O'Connor Howland, of New Rochelle, New York. She grew up in New Rochelle and graduated from Barnard College in New York City in 1949. In 1952, while returning from a vacation in Europe on the French Line steamship ""Liberte"", she met her future husband, Ellis Manning, Jr., a lawyer engaged in the practice of law in Washington, D. C. They were married in 1953 and had four children in a marriage of almost 63 years. Connie was a devoted homemaker. She took great joy in being actively involved in her children's lives throughout their school days, and beyond. She is survived by her husband, by three of her four children, and by five grandchildren. Her surviving children are: Ellis W. Manning, of West Chester, Pennsylvania; Peter T. Manning, of Middletown, Rhode Island; and Elizabeth H. Manning, of Mill Valley, California. During her marriage, Connie and her family lived for 21 years in Washington, D.C. An avid reader, she enjoyed working at the Francis Scott Key Bookshop in Georgetown. She and her husband relocated to the community known as Scarborough in the village of Briarcliff Manor, in Westchester County, New York, where they spent the next 28 years, and were active members of the Sleepy Hollow Country Club in Scarborough. Connie had a strong interest in gourmet cookery. After her children were grown and gone, she pursued that interest as a post-graduate student at the Culinary Institute of America at Hyde Park, New York, and as the operator of a well-respected catering business for more than a dozen years. Connie and Ellis loved to travel. They made frequent trips with family and friends to western Europe, traveling extensively in France and northern Italy. In 2002, they retired to their vacation residence on St. Simon's Island, Georgia. Then, in 2008, they made a final move to San Rafael, California. Memorial services will be scheduled at a later date. 1/3"
