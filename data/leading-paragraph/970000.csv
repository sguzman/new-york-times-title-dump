1900-10-27T00:00:00Z,"BOSTON, Oct. 26. -- Boston had a comparatively quiet market. There was little sign of selling pressure, and recessions were confined to fractions.

Doubtless, in spite of the non possumus set up by Ruskin's literary executors, there will be many more.

The increase of drunkenness in many parts of the United States led to the formation or societies intended to counteract this evil, and, as American intemperance was mainly the result of dram drinking, a pledge against the use of spirits was adopted.

1900-10-28T00:00:00Z,"Readers of magazines will not have forgotten the tribute that was paid in Scribner's, two years ago, by Capt. LEE, R.A., to ""The Regulars at El Caney.""

1900-10-28T00:00:00Z,"To the Editor of The New York Times: Mr. Bryan's admitted skill in repartee and apt retort seems, in the present campaign, to be directed almost entirely to the evasion of issues.

1900-10-28T00:00:00Z,"A second view of the beautiful production of Rostand's ""L'Aiglon"" in English at the Knickerbocker Theatre is worth while. The fine play is all the more enjoyable without the clamor, often factitious and insincere, of a ""first night.""
