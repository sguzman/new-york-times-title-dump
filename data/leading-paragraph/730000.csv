The Senate simply wasted its time."

1890-02-02T00:00:00Z,"The market had a moderate rise in the early part of the week, and all that it was entitled to in view of the money situation. It may show some further small improvement in the coming week. The reaction which followed the advance would have come anyhow, but it was made a little more emphatic by the bank wreckage affair. There is nothing to justify more than a very slow improvement in values."

1890-02-02T00:00:00Z,"The Queen's signature to State documents is still a model of firmness and legibility, no sign of her Majesty's advanced age being discernible in the boldly written ""Victoria R."" which she attaches to such papers as have to bear the royal autograph. There are veteran statesmen living who will remember that the question of the signing of state documents by the sovereign became one of considerable importance in the last months of George IV.'s reign."

Horner is a shrewd man and an excellent all-around ball player, though most successful in the box."

The only thing to be feared now is a sudden frost after the plants have blossomed, or even while they are budding. A late frost, as general thing, follows an open Winter, and there is no little uneasiness among the growers in consequence. The time for the blossoming of the plants is about the first of May."

The crowds actually could not be accommodated."

We have just passed through a trial of the Australian system of voting. The voter finds it personally much more agreeable than the old system. The judges and clerks declare it more expeditious.

1890-03-02T00:00:00Z,During the period of building the empire of the Mississippi Valley and of the highland Commonwealths that were originally founded on beds of golden gravel the location of cities and towns was determined by chance. Many men now living can remember when Indiana town sites were slowly and laboriously chopped out of first-growth forests. The opening of farms fully occupied the agricultural settler for years.

Within the past twenty-four hours a rise of two feet was recorded."
1890-03-02T00:00:00Z,"There are objects of public interest in the promotion of which New-York shows singular apathy, but this is rarely true when the object is a charitable one, or directly of use and improvement to the citizen.

Some of the sales at auction were not quite as successful as the owners had hoped they would be, but the aggregate was satisfactory and the average good.

The demand for investment property continued active and a good deal of it was advantageously placed."

It annexed no territory, and the pecuniary indemnity claimed was nor unreasonable, being limited to 20,000,000 thalers from Austria and about 8,000,000 thalers from Saxony for the cost of the war. The end was attained when Prussia became the supreme arbiter of Germany, and the Emperor and King of Austria-Hungary ceased to form part of the Germanic body."

1890-03-09T00:00:00Z,"In a preface Mr. Bigelow specifies what excuses, if any, he thinks there may be for the publication of this volume. These are his long association with Mr. Bryant as a journalist; the fact that he was one of the executors of Mr. Bryant's will, and the useful ends which a short and inexpensive sketch of the poet's life might serve. It does not appear to us that Mr. Bigelow's act requires any elaborate excuses."

1890-03-23T00:00:00Z,"Hard names were not called nor was the lie given at yesterday's session of the investigation which the Senate Committee on Cities is making into the departments of this city, but in spite of the lack of such episodes as gave an unusual tingle of sensationalism to the two previous sittings of the committee, yesterday's session was of even greater interest than its predecessors."
1890-03-23T00:00:00Z,"The personal character of Dom Pedro Segundo is in every respect admirable. His mode of life was always simple, and his manners those of a well-bred, democratic gentleman. Any one, no matter how humble, could approach him, and, if he or she had a tale of distress to tell, was sure of a patient listener and of receiving aid. His charity was munificent, and often inconsiderate."
1890-03-23T00:00:00Z,"THE TIMES of the 16th inst. contains a communication from Glens Falls which compares the various methods of hunting deer in the Adirondacks, and gives it as the author's opinion that hounding is the least destructive.

They will report at Chicago immediately and attend the funeral in Maryland."
1890-03-23T00:00:00Z,"To-morrow evening lovers of good opera will have an opportunity of hearing Verdi's ""Otello"" under better circumstances than when it was first produced in this country as the feature of Signor Campanini's miserably managed season at the Academy of Music in 1888. Instead of the unhappy Marconi, we shall have in the title role Francesco Tamango, a tenor of world-wide reputation."
1890-03-23T00:00:00Z,"THE TIMES has already commented upon the movement for consolidation among the parishes of the Protestant Episcopal Church in this city.

De Frece, to swell the funds for the erection of the Memorial Arch at Washington-square, was attended by a brilliant audience. The fact that the house was not crowded was without doubt largely due to the weather, as many boxes had been disposed of which were not occupied. Ex-President and Mrs. Cleveland were among those present."

1890-03-23T00:00:00Z,"JAGUAR AND PUMA. -- Chiefs among the carnivores of the pampas are the two cat monarchs of South America -- the jaguar and puma.

1890-03-23T00:00:00Z,"WAWONA, Cal., March 16. -- Gov. Waterman, it appears, as chief of the Yosemite management, has undertaken a defense of the present system of control of that interesting reservation. In California Mr. Waterman's utterances ceased long ago to have great weight with people conversant with public affairs; but the fact that he is the Government might lead people elsewhere to attach some importance to his declarations."
1890-03-23T00:00:00Z,"HACKMATACK CAMP IN THE ADIRONDACKS, March 19. -- During the last fortnight we have experienced pretty much every kind of weather from the coldest, 17 below zero, to the warmest, which lies among the fifties above. The latter temperature seems rather oppressive and unseasonable after the delightful ""cold snap"" just passed."
1890-03-23T00:00:00Z,"Comparison of closing prices yesterday with those of a week before showed only fractional changes, with two or three exceptions. As a rule business has been deadly dull. Unless there is improvement soon brokers think they will have to get a living at something else.

1890-03-23T00:00:00Z,"The approaching trial of the cruiser Philadelphia, which was launched last Autumn, becomes the more interesting because her contract substitutes speed for horse power as the guaranteed element which is to earn premiums for excess or forfeit penalties for shortcomings.

1890-03-23T00:00:00Z,"The baby blizzard left on Spring's doorstep developed into such a healthy scion of old Winter that ladies drew their furs closer around them and shivered as they looked askance at the light wraps inviting their attention in every window of the great stores.

1890-03-23T00:00:00Z,"The art of the eighteenth century in France fell from grace in the world until a quarter of a century ago.

1890-03-23T00:00:00Z,"I am sorry that Georges Hugo is letting his share of his grandfather's hard-earned fortune fall into the hands of sharpers. It was not good for the youth (who is now a young man) to feel the eyes of Paris converging on him the day of Victor Hugo's funeral, or, rather, apotheosis. There never was such an astounding street opera as that ceremony."
1890-03-24T00:00:00Z,"One of the most vexatious features of the clause relating to the increase of duty on tinned plate, as contained in the tariff schedule prepared by the Republican Ways and Means Committee of the House, is its application to tinware -- to those thousand and one articles which are hourly used in every household in every quarter of the country."

1890-03-24T00:00:00Z,"PITTSBURG, Penn., March 23. -- The Monongahela River touched the highest notch of the present flood at 2 o'clock this afternoon, when the marks registered twenty-four feet even. The Allegheny River reached the same point a short time later, and is still rising. River men, however, do not anticipate a much higher stage, as it has grown quite cold and the reports from the head waters show the rivers to be stationary."
1890-03-24T00:00:00Z,"LONDON, MARCH 23. -- TherE was a fair demand for discount during the past week at 3 to 3x. On the Stock Exchange business was quiet.

If they do they will find several interesting matters to inquire into."
1890-03-24T00:00:00Z,"Wednesday's snowstorm was just what the amateur photographers had been hoping for. The snowfalls previous to it had not been of a nature to make picturesque scenes.

Being damp, the flakes had remained wherever they fell."

From what has already been done it would appear that the General Assembly was the creature of the ring politicians and was powerless to resist their demands."
1890-03-24T00:00:00Z,"The Senate must now be nearly ready to take up the bill authorizing the construction of additional vessels for the navy.

1890-03-24T00:00:00Z,Mr. CHIPMAN of Detroit seems to have yielded to an impulse of congenital silliness in opposing the permission to our military representative at the French manoeuvres last year to accept the Order of the Legion of Honor. The symptoms of his melancholy disease are plainly to be seen in the passages from his report on the subject cited in our Washington dispatches.
1890-03-24T00:00:00Z,"The Rev. Dr. K. Kohler lectured yesterday morning at the Temple Beth-El, Sixty-third-street and Lexington-avenue, on ""The Bible and Religion in Our Common Schools and Colleges.""

1890-03-28T00:00:00Z,"When some weeks ago the doughty Major MCKINLEY took the Republican members of the Ways and Means Committee down into the crypt of the Capitol to make up a tariff bill that should serve the chief end of all tariff bills, viz., to glorify the Republican Party and magnify its campaign fund, he had a profound and cheerful contempt for the ""free traders in disguise"" who were bothering him about raw materials."
1890-03-28T00:00:00Z,"ALBANY, March 27. -- In the midst of his brilliant successes in New-York Mr. Thomas C. Platt is meeting with adversity in Albany.

1890-03-28T00:00:00Z,"NEWPORT, Ky., March 27. -- No place along the entire length of the Ohio River has felt the effects of the present flood and that of two weeks ago more than this city. Every industry of any importance is shut down and has been for ten days, causing great distress among the wage workers. The city has organized a relief corps, which patrols the flooded districts regularly, supplying food, clothing, and medicine."
1890-03-28T00:00:00Z,"WASHINGTON, March 27. -- The discussion of the Trust bill in the Senate has impressed the friends of tariff reform at the Capitol more strongly than ever with the belief that the Republicans have no intention of affording to the country any relief from taxation through discouragement of the trusts and monopolies that subsist by the encouragement of the tariff."
1890-03-28T00:00:00Z,"ALBANY, March 27. -- The Senate Committee on General Laws, which has been playing with electricity for lighting and power purposes in New-York for the past six weeks, and which has been conspicuous for its examination of witnesses friendly to the Westinghouse Company, has turned in its report.

LOUIS, March 27. -- A dispatch to the Republic from Nashville, Ill., says the cyclone struck that place with terrific force, and that not a pane of glass is left in a window with western exposure.

1890-03-28T00:00:00Z,"The Railroad Committee of the State Senate has at last come to the point of action on the question of rapid transit.

1890-03-28T00:00:00Z,"BOSTON, March 27. -- There was plenty of fun at the State House to-day. The tariff discussion in the House had completely demoralized the Republican forces, and had caused a clean-cut division in the ranks. Several miniature conferences were held during the forenoon between the leaders. The Wardwell wing insisted on standing up against the trip-hammer blows of the Democrats, and sustaining the policy of the national party."
1890-03-28T00:00:00Z,"We remark with interest that the Cincinnati Commercial Gazette is opposed to ballot reform, at least to the Australian system.

1890-03-29T00:00:00Z,"Louisville is the largest and most important town in the State of Kentucky, and, next to Cincinnati, in that section of the country. It is a city which has grown most rapidly in recent years, a result, perhaps, of its singularly good natural location. It is on the banks of the Ohio River, 130 miles below Cincinnati, just at what are called the ""falls"" in the river."
1890-03-29T00:00:00Z,"The recent decision of Judge Andrews of the Supreme Court denying the application of the Manhattan Electric Light Company and of George E.

1890-03-29T00:00:00Z,"Our artists have some reason for jubilation over the placing of works of art on the free list. provided that step of wisdom be not forthwith retraced before the assault of the enemy. The enemy is here in the singular, because one THOMAS DONALDSON of Philadelphia appears to have hitherto constituted himself the opponent of all measures to relieve the fine arts from an insulting discrimination."
1890-03-29T00:00:00Z,"The Assembly Committee on Taxation and Retrenchment has reported a bill which is said to combine the Larmon and Dempsey listing bills.

1890-03-29T00:00:00Z,"There was still no word yesterday from the belated steamship City of Paris, which left here at 3:30 on the afternoon of March 19, bound for Queenstown and Liverpool. Nine days is a very long time for such a record breaker as the City of Paris to take for crossing the ocean, being three days longer in fact than her trips usually require."

1890-03-29T00:00:00Z,"OTTAWA, March 28. -- The budget debate was resumed to-day. The great features of the resolutions submitted to the House of Commons and the speeches with which the two Ministers supported them were a declaration of commercial war against the United States, a general increase of taxation upon the people of Canada, and a complete repudiation and abandonment by the Government of their old policy of reciprocity in natural products."
1890-03-29T00:00:00Z,"DES MOINES, Iowa, March 28. -- Prohibition got a blow between the eyes to-day. It was administered by the Senate Committee on Cities and Towns.

They were here when the Duc de Durcal offered his old masters, and it is quite among the possibilities that the slender results of the sale of his treasures discouraged the owner of these."
1890-03-29T00:00:00Z,"The ""secret session"" which the United States Senate held yesterday for the consideration of the two Federal appointments in Florda which are so obnoxious to the respectable people of that State afforded an illustration at once of the motives which the Senators have for secrecy and the futility of their efforts to secure it."

1890-03-29T00:00:00Z,"The statement that ISHAK Khan is raising a force in Bokhara with a view to invading Afghanistan has not unexpectedly followed the previous report of a rebellion against the Ameer.

1890-03-29T00:00:00Z,The calamity which has devastated the Ohio Valley is one that is by no means novel in the West except for its extent. By reason of its extent the hurricane included one large city and a considerable number of thriving towns and villages. The tornadoes of which we get tidings almost every year are so local and limited in their scope that the chances are much against their striking the site of a town.
1890-03-29T00:00:00Z,"ELIZABETH, N.J., March 28. -- The Elizabeth City Council was unable to-night to adopt the plan for the abolition of grade crossings in the city as approved by the Pennsylvania and Central Companies.

1890-03-29T00:00:00Z,"The appointment of Gen. SICKLES to be Sheriff, to fill the vacancy caused by the enforced resignation of FLACK, is probably as good as could have been expected from Gov. HILL.

1890-03-30T00:00:00Z,"Mr. Jefferson's exquisitely humorous portrayal of Pangloss has unhappily vanished from our stage before the general run of playgoers have had time to realize that so rare a work of dramatic art was on view.

1890-03-30T00:00:00Z,"The baseball season was begun in this vicinity yesterday by the Brooklyn Association and the New-York League Club. The Brooklyns played a ""tie"" game with the clever little Albany team, and the Giants easily whipped the Jaspers of Manhattan College."
1890-03-30T00:00:00Z,"The last week in the real estate market was one of surprises.

Both parties found plenty to talk about, and the coming together of any two male pedestrians resulted in prompt discussions of a political nature.

1890-04-13T00:00:00Z,There has never before been so much dolefal croaking about floods in the Mississippi Valley. There has never before been so malicious and determined an effort to destroy public confidence in the measures heretofore relied on for the protection of our lowlands from overflows. There has never before seen so ferocious an attack on New-Orleans and its great advantages and facilities as a seaport.

O'Brien and Davitt and the English visitors, the ceremonies attending the opening of the town of New-Tipperary were delayed until the afternoon.

1890-04-13T00:00:00Z,"The question of a division of the public school fund is as ""burning"" in Canada as it is here.

Not that there were any very large entertainments or an excess of gayety, but there was almost too much of lesser merriment, and the hours were all too crowded with pleasant, if small, events to interest and attract."

1890-04-13T00:00:00Z,"PARIS, March 28. -- We know now that Spring is here; not because the swallows were faithful to their nests on the very dawn of the 21st -- an unusual warm weather symptom, I am told -- nor because the famous chestnut tree of the Tuileries has put forth its new Spring clothes of delicate green, lined with tender gray. This is an old-fashioned item of frequent showing, and scarcely worthy of remark."
1890-04-13T00:00:00Z,"A noticeable thing about the statues found in our museums of art, supposed to represent the perfect figures of ancient men and women, is the apparently disproportionate size of their feet. We moderns are apt to pronounce them too large, particularly those of the females. It will be found, however, that for symmetrical perfection these feet could not be better."

1890-04-13T00:00:00Z,"LONDON, April 12. -- The new European drama, upon which popular attention is fastened, unfolds its actions slowly, so that no man may tell as yet what it will bring forth.

1890-04-13T00:00:00Z,"There can be no question that Grover Cleveland is now the most prominent man in the Democratic Party and the most available one as a Presidential candidate for 1892. I have not yet seen a Democrat who expressed any doubt upon this point, viewing the question, of course, from the standpoint of to-day; in other words, if a Democratic convention were held next month, or next week, Mr. Cleveland would probably be nominated by acclamation."
1890-04-13T00:00:00Z,"AFTER THE SLAVE TRADE THE GIN TRAFFIC. -- With the stoppage of the slave trade the gin traffic only received a more powerful stimulus.

1890-04-14T00:00:00Z,"All roads led to Elizabeth yesterday so far as lovers of horse racing are concerned.

1890-04-14T00:00:00Z,"The letter of Mr. HENRY C. LEA to President HARRISON has had a disturbing effect upon the mind of Philadelphia, not so much because it assailed Senator QUAY, nor yet because it poured vials of Scriptural vitriol upon the head of the President, but because it was an act of open and defiant blasphemy toward the local idol of Philadelphia, JOHN WANAMAKER."

1890-04-23T00:00:00Z,"ALBANY, April 22. -- New-York State will have no ballot-reform law this year, and the responsibility for the failure must fall upon the shoulders of Thomas C.

1890-04-26T00:00:00Z,Mr. GLADSTONE'S speech against Mr. BALFOUR'S Land-Purchase bill completes the case against that measure.

1890-04-27T00:00:00Z,"There is a bill hidden away somewhere in Albany which seems to have escaped the attention of the young men who represent the Brooklyn newspapers at the capital. The explanation of this may be connected with the fact that the bill is designed to provide a job for an old-time Democratic war horse, ex-Auditor William S. Searing of the Twenty-first Ward."

Kingman of the United States Engineer Corps, who has just returned from several days' work with his relief boat in the overflowed section. The crevasse, says Capt. Kingman, at Morganza Level is 1,227 feet wide, and the flow of water through the break is about 150,000 cubic feet per second."

1890-04-27T00:00:00Z,The condition of the renting market for residence property for the coming year presents few changes compared with last year's figures. In some quarters rents have been advanced.

To this question the answer will be Evolution, and to Herbert Spencer must be accorded the honor of being its chief expounder."
1890-04-27T00:00:00Z,"The interview with BISMARCK published yesterday furnishes a clue to his retirement, though that does not seem to have been its purpose. It betrays not only the ex-Chancellor's belief in a strong Government, which was well enough known before, but his disgust with the conciliation of ""Labor"" by the Emperor."
1890-04-27T00:00:00Z,"ST. LOUIS, April 26. -- Additional advices from Texas show that the great rain storm has covered nearly all the northern and western sections of the State.

1890-04-27T00:00:00Z,"How much credence is to be given to the statements made by PATRICK H. McCANN before the investigating committee yesterday we are unable to judge, but if true they throw a curious light upon the doings of the two leading Tammany politicians, CROKER and GRANT.

Davis, who had been for twenty-two years the Under Sheriff of Essex County, was the one topic discussed on the streets of Newark to-day.

1890-04-27T00:00:00Z,"Senator J. Sloat Fassett smiled again yesterday. Smiles are fleeting things, and yesterday Mr. Fassett had his Senate Committee on Cities at work long enough in Part II, of the Superior Court to give his smile a chance to get going again.

1890-04-28T00:00:00Z,"Our high-tariff neighbor, the Tribune, appears to suffer some anxiety about the sugar schedule in the McKinley bill.

1890-04-28T00:00:00Z,"LONDON, April 27. -- Discount was dull during the past week at 1 3/4 to 1 1/4. On the Stock Exchange buoyant activity set in after the completion of Monday's settlement, a decided advance occurring all round, while there was no indication of a disposition to secure profits.

1890-04-28T00:00:00Z,"One of the misfortunes of physiognomy, if it be regarded as a science, is that it has been made to suffer from past exaggerations. There never seems to have been any period in human observation when deductions were not made from a man's looks, and so rapid and false declarations of character were presented from uncertain indications. The ancients, from Cleanthes up, believed that they could recognize dispositions from the looks."

1890-04-28T00:00:00Z,There seems to be a suspicion at Albany that the Ballot-Reform bill which passed the Senate unanimously last week will encounter the stiletto of Gov. HILL in the Assembly. This suspicion is based upon a belief that the Governor's real purpose in coming out so boldly in commendation of the measure was to excite Republican opposition and prevent its passage.
1890-04-28T00:00:00Z,"It is a curious and striking instance of the way in which legislation is becoming less and less a matter for responsible and open action by Congress, and more and more a matter for caucus regulation, that the programme of the majority in the House for this week allows two days for the discussion of the Silver bill and one day for the discussion of the Service Pension bill, should these two measures be reached."
1890-04-28T00:00:00Z,One feature of the probable effect of the silver legislation recently agreed upon by the House Republican caucus that is not generally regarded is the fact that any advance in price produced by the purchases of silver by the Treasury can only be maintained by continuing those purchases and cannot be maintained even in that way unless the supply of silver remains about what it now is.

1890-04-29T00:00:00Z,The hearing given by the Park Commissioners yesterday about the proposed transfer of the menagerie had the effect of confirming the general belief that the menagerie ought not to be in the Park at all.

1890-04-29T00:00:00Z,"The Governor has allowed the act repealing the ""two-dollar-a-day"" law of last year to take effect without his signature, but he takes occasion to explain why and to leave ""the full responsibility"" to the Legislature.

1890-04-29T00:00:00Z,"During the last four months there has been an unusual number of failures in the clothing trade, the most characteristic feature of which has been the entire absence of assets. In most of these cases general preferences have been avoided, in consequence, it is supposed, of the uncertainties of the laws governing preferences. A case in point is the failure of Aarons Feder, clothiers, of 95 Prince Street, who failed about ten days ago."

Harvard last Fall instructed her football management to withdraw from the intercollegiate organization, but as there has been no meeting of the Football Association since that time, the resignation has not been formally acted upon."

1890-04-29T00:00:00Z,We can hardly bring ourselves to credit the report circulating in Washington that Senator EVARTS intends to lead the opposition in the Senate to the new Silver bill with the intention of securing a measure by which the Secretary will not be allowed to redeem the silver certificates in silver bullion under any circumstances.
1890-04-29T00:00:00Z,""" It is probably true,"" says the Pittsburg Dispatch, (Rep.,) ""that the Sugar Trust succeeded in getting the 5 per cent. ad valorem margin of protection allotted to it by the first draft of the bill changed to a specific duty of 4-10 of a cent."" This is positively true, and not merely a matter of probability."

1890-04-30T00:00:00Z,"Both from a racing and a financial standpoint the opening of the last part of the Spring meeting of the New-Jersey Jockey Club was a success. When the first race was called it was estimated that 8,000 persons had passed through the gates. Seventy-five bookmakers occupied stands, and as four favorites and two strong choices won, the talent were possessors of large bank rolls at the end of the day's sport."
1890-04-30T00:00:00Z,"It is difficult to make out exactly what the politicians in the Assembly are driving at in dealing with the Ballot-Reform bill. It was put in a shape in which the representatives of both parties professed to be in favor of its passage, and in which the Governor had taken pains to give it his hearty commendation."
1890-04-30T00:00:00Z,"The decision of the Supreme Court in the Iowa case is of great importance, and will be warmly resented by the prohibitionists. In effect it nullifies every State prohibitory law. A State may prevent the manufacture of intoxicating liquor within its borders, and it may also prevent the sale of liquor by the glass, and, indeed, in any quantities by one of its own citizens to another."
1890-04-30T00:00:00Z,"LONG BRANCH, N.J., April 29. -- The approaching municipal election which takes place here next Tuesday promises to be the warmest fight that has occurred in this city.

1890-04-30T00:00:00Z,"One of the first pleasures which Mr. Jay Gould will enjoy on his return from the Southwest to-day will be a report made to him by a confidential representative, whom he has lately had looking over things at Washington. This report has particularly to do with Mr. Gould's Western Union Telegraph Company and the recent efforts of Postmaster General Wanamaker to establish an opposition company under Government patronage."
1890-04-30T00:00:00Z,"DES MOINES, April 29. -- The political situation in Iowa this year will not be without interest.

1890-04-30T00:00:00Z,"CORFU, Ionian Isles, April 12. -- Another week spent at Corfu brings the cruise of the squadron of evolution that much nearer its close. For work done and the results accomplished no equal period has proved as fruitful as the three weeks spent in this port."

1890-04-30T00:00:00Z,"The change of bill at Daly's Theatre this week has brought forward two entertaining little pieces in which Miss Rosina Vokes has often appeared here before, though never with more successful results.

1890-04-30T00:00:00Z,"PITTSBURG, April 29. -- There was one speech expected at the Americus Republican Club banquet on Saturday night last that was not delivered.

1890-04-30T00:00:00Z,"The suit brought by Samuel W. Lewis of the Consolidated Stock and Petroleum Exchange against Charles G. Wilson, as President of the Exchange, for damages and reinstatement as a member of the Exchange, was yesterday decided finally in the Court of Appeals against Mr. Lewis. This decision, it is thought, definitely settles the question of the extent of the jurisdiction an unincorporated association has over its members."
1890-04-30T00:00:00Z,"PHILADELPHIA, April 29. -- Last night the Ru'dolph Aronson Opera Company presented 'Erminie"" at the Chestnut Street Theatre before one of the largest audiences that have assembled in a playhouse here this season.

1890-04-30T00:00:00Z,"The failure of Aarons Feder was, according to Lawyer Daniel P. Hays of the firm of Hays Greenbaum, not discreditable. ""The facts,"" said Mr. Hays, ""are these.""

1890-05-01T00:00:00Z,If the Tammany Senators are in earnest in their professed desire for a rapid-transit measure that is free from politics they showed very little sense in getting up an acrimonious partisan debate yesterday over the proposition for a conference committee to settle the differences between the Senate and Assembly.

1890-05-04T00:00:00Z,"Nothing stirs the imagination more than tales of the discovery of precious stones, not even news of gold mines, and nothing is more certain than a flow of adventures toward that place where a find of gems has been reported. It is a natural consequence that books dealing with precious stones should be popular because thousands who can never own valuable jewels love to see them and hear how costly they are."
1890-05-04T00:00:00Z,"There is only one Atalanta Boat Club in the country, and this club is not only capable of holding the title of champion of aquatic contests, but is well able to make things merry in a royal fashion as well. This latter fact was clearly demonstrated last night in the Hotel Marlborough, Broadway and Thirty-sixth Street. The Atalantas held their annual dinner there and about 125 members enjoyed themselves until midnight."

Returns from every county on the Eastern Shore, from all parts of Delaware, and from the eastern shore of Virginia are practically unanimous in declaring the peaches dead."
1890-05-04T00:00:00Z,"It may not be particularly surprising that the majority of the Park Board should have voted for the transfer of the menagerie from the southeastern to the northwestern corner of the Central Park. It would not be so much of a nuisance just now in the proposed site as in the present site to the residents of the neighborhood, for the simple reason that there are not so many residents in the neighborhood."
1890-05-04T00:00:00Z,"The frantic efforts of certain American musicians to prevent the entrance of the Strauss Orchestra into this country have evoked considerable needless discussion. It seems a pity that so much good ink and paper should be wasted over so small a matter. Of course, the contract-labor law never was designed to prevent the visit of a foreign musician or band of musicians."
1890-05-04T00:00:00Z,"Much foolish comment has been made on the prominence of athletics in the contemporaneous college curriculum. This comment has been somewhat satirical and exaggerated in style, suggesting always that the writer did not seriously believe that football and the kindred sciences were really held in such high esteem as those studies whose names terminate in ""ics"" or ""ology."""

1890-05-04T00:00:00Z,"COLUMBUS, Ohio, May. 3. -- The political contest in Ohio this year will, without question, be the most closely contested for several years.

1890-05-04T00:00:00Z,"It is always better when one starts on a long journey not to make the pace too rapid at the start. Yesterday, after a week of advance, there was a reaction, and the reaction will do good. The market will solidify and a new start be taken from harder basis. This bull movement has not more than begun. It has come to stay."

1890-05-04T00:00:00Z,"Commander McCalla finished his story yesterday before the court-martial which has been trying him upon the charges made against him, and a most interesting story it was. While he admitted all of the facts, or at least the most serious ones, he gave many reasons for acting as he had acted during the cruise of the Enterprise which seemed to strike the gentlemen who sat in judgment upon him with a great deal of force."

It is anonymous, and deals with a department of human thought commonly left to the professed expounders of religion, yet one cannot read far without perceiving that no clergyman could have written it.

HILL will do with the Cable Railroad bill and the bill finally passed through the efforts of the aqueduct contractors giving their claims against the city preference in the first department of the Supreme Court.

Palmer and Senator C.B. Farwell on their merits."

A committee who waited upon Superintendent Nearing could obtain no satisfaction."
1890-05-16T00:00:00Z,"It is hardly to be supposed that Gov. HILL would in any case sign the bill which is intended to revive the charter of the Cable Railroad Company, with all the powers and privileges which it claims to have originally acquired under the Rapid-Transit act, but it is the part of prudence, nevertheless, to make an emphatic protest against the foisting of this scheme upon the city."
1890-05-16T00:00:00Z,"The New Amsterdams, a crack amateur baseball team, was organized at Navesink, N.J., yesterday.

1890-05-16T00:00:00Z,"The Board of Managers of the American Bible Society held a special meeting in the Bible House, Astor Place, yesterday afternoon, which proved to be highly interesting.

The jury rendered a verdict in favor of the defendants without leaving their seats."

1890-05-16T00:00:00Z,"Sneering at the financial knowledge and capacity of the City Chamberlain was hardly an effective way for the Controller to reply to his suggestions regarding the borrowing of money on revenue bonds. It may be that Mr. CRAIN does not understand the requirements of the situation, but it would have been more magnanimous for Mr. MYERS to enlighten him instead of indulging in mere sarcasm."

Whether this course has been detrimental in a money way or not is a question not easily answered. The larger number of sales took place during the first two weeks."
1890-05-17T00:00:00Z,"We are apt to imagine that there is no such thing as a ""temperance question"" in England in the sense in which we use the phrase.

1890-05-17T00:00:00Z,"The Senate is urged to concur in the House substitute for its Dependent Pension bill on the ground that this substitute simply extends to Union veterans a privilege which was recently furnished to Mexican veterans. That, however, is not quite the fact. The Mexican bill, which certainly contained an age pension feature, was not passed until about forty years after the close of the Mexican war."
1890-05-17T00:00:00Z,"PARIS, May 16. -- M. Bozerian opened debate in the Senate to-day with an interpellation on the Newfoundland fisheries question. He asserted that the rights of the French fishermen were really not disputed. It was simply a question as to the scope of those rights.

But investigation showed that it was greatly exaggerated, as only five were buried by the fall, and three of this number were killed outright."
1890-05-17T00:00:00Z,There is something rather pitiful in the complaints of Mr. BALFOUR and his supporters in the House of Commons of having advanced an Irish bill by means of sharp Parliamentary practice. The rules of the House have been reconstructed expressly in order to prevent the Irish members from exercising any effective influence upon legislation relating to their own country.
1890-05-17T00:00:00Z,"WASHINGTON, May 16. -- Some time ago Mr. John F.

1890-05-17T00:00:00Z,"BERLIN, May 16. -- Debate on the Army bill was resumed in the Reichstag to-day. Herr Liebknecht declared that the nation would soon be ruined by the heavy burden of militarism. The septennate ought to have denoted a finality, but the country's burdens had since continually increased.

1890-05-21T00:00:00Z,"It is rather odd that just after the appearance of the Emperor of Germany in the character of an effusively benevolent despot the English Ministry should be arraigned for introducing Socialistic projects of law.

First and last, or at least latter, it has been largely and freely discussed.

Humphrey was its Secretary the two used to have a regular ""cat-and- dog"" time of it. This was shown by the evidence given yesterday before Referee L.C.

1890-05-25T00:00:00Z,"The fact that the Eric-Castaway II. match had been declared off did not tend to lessen the attendance at the Brooklyn Jockey Club races yesterday.

1890-05-25T00:00:00Z,"It matters very little that the Beau Brummel of Mr. Mansfield is not exactly like the Beau Brummell of history. History makes very little account of the favorite of the fat Prince. The difference of a single 1 in this case is a very great difference, for Mr. Mansfield portrays a Beau who, although he might well set the fashion in a shallow, tuft-hunting society, is yet a sympathetic and lovable man."

BYNUM and BAYNE, and a lesson in veracity to Mr. CLARKSON."
1890-05-26T00:00:00Z,"The American German had a great time of it yesterday. The day was called in German Pfingsten. Deprived of the Teutonic accent and other German attributes, ""Pfingsten"" is Whitsuntide, and it is a day that all good Germans do most love to celebrate.

1890-06-08T00:00:00Z,"There is a marked similarity between Mr. Montagu Williams's reminiscences and those of the late Sergeant Ballantine. As far as interest goes, Ballantine's volumes were the better, having had the advantage of being the first in the field. A carious trait in both Williams and Ballantine is their special fondness for association with actors, and doubtless such social intimacy is a very pleasant one."
1890-06-08T00:00:00Z,"RED BANK, N.J., June 7. -- This week's hot weather has caused the city people to come here, and there are only a few unoccupied Summer cottages in the place. During the moonlight nights there has been a number of boating excursions on the Shrewsbury. The boats were gayly decorated with Chinese lanterns, and most of them had musicians on board."

1890-06-08T00:00:00Z,"BALTIMORE, June 7. -- Wedding bells have again been active this week, and Cupid has good cause to be proud of his work. It is seldom in this city that there take place at this season so many as four weddings in one week, yet such is the number solemnized since last Monday. None was especially brilliant, but two of them derived much prominence from the distinction of the grooms."

1890-06-08T00:00:00Z,"RISE IN BRIC-A-BRAC. -- The annals of auctions would furnish some instructive instances of the marvelous changes of value brought about by higher artistic taste or the varying caprice of fashion. Few, perhaps, are more striking than the following: When Prussia was in the throes of her life-and-death struggle with France early in the present century, the ladies of Berlin threw their ornaments of gold into their country's Treasury, receiving in return trinkets of iron."
1890-06-08T00:00:00Z,"SERVANTS IN SHAKESPEARE'S TIME. -- In the time of Shakespeare domestic service was in a state of transition; the old system was decaying, the new one springing into life; and if one may be allowed to judge from casual references scattered throughout the plays of the poet, the new order does not appear to have been altogether satisfactory."
1890-06-08T00:00:00Z,"ALEXANDRIA BAY, N.Y., June 7. -- It is probable that no other bass grounds in the State are more in favor with the vast army of anglers than those of the St. Lawrence and Lake Ontario. The reason for this is that bass are plentiful and the region affords everything that goes to make angling a luxurious pastime. Hence it is that people are anxious to preserve it."
1890-06-08T00:00:00Z,"READING, Penn., June 7. -- On Thursday next the attention of Universalists all over the United States will be centred upon a simple and unique observance that will be conducted near the time-honored settlement of Oley, in Berks County, a few miles from Reading.

1890-06-08T00:00:00Z,"Four thousand tiny balls of electric light illuminated the amphitheatre in the new Madison Square Garden last night and disclosed to a few privileged spectators the largest hall of public entertainment in the world. There is no trace or flavor of the circus, the walking match, pugilism, or the dog show about this new Garden."
1890-06-08T00:00:00Z,"Possibly it is because the first flush of youth is no longer considered the period at which woman is most beautiful and interesting that the Spring girl is of so little importance beside the Summer girl in her fuller glory. Summer girls bloom in June and fade in September. Their efflorescence is short, so it must be vivid and effective while it lasts."

1890-06-08T00:00:00Z,"The writings of De Quincesy have met with a singular fate at the hands of editors. In his lifetime De Quincey was a writer for periodicals to an extent not equaled by any other author of his reputation. Until he undertook to prepare a collected edition of his works, his name had seldom appeared on the title page of any bound volume."

It is proceeding upon much the same lines that were followed two or three years ago by the Ford committee, and it is likely to have very much the same result."
1890-06-09T00:00:00Z,"Amateur photographers are noticing that there is not nearly so much difficulty in procuring sitters for portraits or permission to ""take"" objects of interest as there used to be. It was not so long ago that the sight of a black cloth had the same effect as a red one on a bull upon the proprietor of a waterfall or a Summer resort hotel keeper. Now the knights of the camera are welcome almost everywhere."
1890-06-09T00:00:00Z,"ALBANY, June 8. -- In view of the short-sighted policy of the Republican Congress and the selfishness of the Republican Administration the Hill Democrats (and they are more sanguine than sensible) are counting with a confidence that is truly sublime upon electing a Democratic Assembly this Fall. That the Democracy will reduce the number of the Republican Congressional delegation from this State is hardly doubted, no matter what may be thought of the Assembly."
1890-06-09T00:00:00Z,"NEW-ORLEANS, June 8. -- In the Twelfth Ward of this city yesterday, as telegraphed to THE TIMES, an election of delegates to a Representative District Convention to fill a vacancy in the House of Representatives resulted in the triumph of the lottery ticket by a vote of 538 over the anti-lottery ticket, which polled 125 votes.

1890-06-09T00:00:00Z,"MONTREAL, June 8. -- A great sensation was caused here this afternoon in St. Catherine Street, one of our most public thoroughfares and one which usually, on a Sunday afternoon, is crowded with pedestrians.

There is no doubt that these residents and property owners have the law on their side, but they appear to be having some difficulty in getting the law enforced."
1890-06-09T00:00:00Z,"An extraordinary scene in a lunatic asylum is thus described by our Paris correspondent: There is nothing, mad doctors say, more unusual than for lunatics who are together to act on a common impulse.

1890-06-09T00:00:00Z,"BALTIMORE, June 8. -- To many people in Baltimore it seems only a matter of time when the Baltimore and Ohio will become a New-York road. Its affairs are steadily tending in that direction. The success of the syndicate which has been formed to assist it means that New-York will have a direct interest in its finances. It is expected that the plans will be straightened out this week."

1890-06-09T00:00:00Z,"ANNAPOLIS, June 8. -- The final examinations of the ""six-year cadets"" who graduated from the Naval Academy June, 1888, will begin to-morrow morning. These examinations have been greatly delayed owing to the absence of Cadets Benham, Chandler, Franklin, and Ried, who were on the squadron of evolution, and who seem to have been overlooked when their fellow-classmen were ordered home."

1890-06-10T00:00:00Z,"A railroad combination far bigger than anything yet attempted is being quietly discussed among well-informed railroad men. It is nothing less than the amalgamation of the great Missouri Pacific and Atchison systems. The successful reorganization of the Atchison, Topeka and Santa Fe Railroad system and its recent purchase of the St. Louis and San Francisco Road have apparently whetted the appetites of certain ambitious capitalists connected with the Atchison for railroad properties."

1890-06-10T00:00:00Z,There is no doubt that the business of the smuggling of goods into this country by the officers and employes of the various ocean steamship lines has received a heavy blow.

1890-06-10T00:00:00Z,"The accident to the City of Rome seems to have been slight, much slighter than that which lately happened to the City of Paris, but it is equally impressive to the imagination. Any narrow escape of one of these huge embodiments of force is impressive by reason of the appalling possibilities it opens. These two accidents, however, have a special element of impressiveness in that they were apparently quite inevitable."
1890-06-10T00:00:00Z,"The fact that a mile-heat race was to be decided and that Tenny was to meet Sir Dixon at a mile probably accounted for the remarkably large crowd at Morris Park yesterday.

HILL and the Republican politicians in the Legislature were engaged during the session in a contest for political capital, and if the Governor got the best of it, as he distinctly did, it was the fault of these same narrow and short-sighted politicians, who were more zealous in obeying the orders of ""Boss"" PLATT than in promoting the interests of the public."

1890-06-15T00:00:00Z,"The settlement of Bermuda was so closely connected with the settlement of the American colonies that reading the history of those times makes Bermudas seem like a first cousin. It was through a shipwreck while on his way to Virginia that Sir George Somers reached the Bermudas; and if he had not been detained there for nearly a year with his 150 colonists, the early history of Virginia would no doubt have been materially altered."

Albani, Sir Charles and Lady Halle, Josef Hofmann, Otto Hegner, and Adelina Patti."
1890-06-15T00:00:00Z,"THE FIRST CHRISTIAN ART. -- The first Christian painters and sculptors were dwellers in the Catacombs.

1890-06-15T00:00:00Z,"Short stories by an Anglo-Indian, whose name is already known on this side of the Atlantic, give some insight into the life of the English at their Summer resorts in the Himalayas. Mr. Kipling has all the benefit of a novel social atmosphere. His tales from the hills are full of words taken up into English from Hindustanee and bear an unmistakable flavor of the mess-table and the Indian Civil Office."

1890-06-15T00:00:00Z,"Shattered nerves and hoarse voices will probably prevail among the Yale and Princeton men who witnessed the game of baseball between the nines of those colleges yesterday afternoon at Brotherhood Park.

There was a good trade in Lard and some inquiry for spot at the June prices, which ruled 5c under July, and some demand also for shipment in July."

But they made lots of bad errors, and, after holding the lead for three innings, they went to pieces. Vaughn, Hatfield, and Richardson were away off in their fielding. The Brooklyns, on the other hand, put up a good fielding game. The bad condition of the grounds had no terrors for them."

The South Saxon is, as might be expected, heavy in this as in all else. There is nothing keen or delicate about his perception of the ludicrous; nor is there, on the other hand, much that is ill-natured."
1890-06-15T00:00:00Z,"COPYRIGHT. -- That publishers occasionally make mistakes is but to say that they are human. Dodsley, it is said, refused to give Sterne 50 for ""Tristram Shandy,"" and eventually was glad to pay him 650 for the right to the second edition only.

LOUIS, June 14. -- Over 3,000 persons were present at the prayer meeting of the Young People's Christian Endeavor Convention this morning, and it was a very fervid and enthusiastic affair.

1890-06-23T00:00:00Z,"Is our climate changing? The succession of temperate Summers and open Winters through several years, culminating last Winter in the almost total failure of the ice crop throughout the valley of the Hudson, makes the question pertinent. The older inhabitants tell us that the Winters are not as cold now as when they were young, and we have all observed a marked diminution of the average cold even in this last decade."

1890-06-23T00:00:00Z,"The measure which Congress has enacted for the decrease of desertion is the most comprehensive ever undertaken for this purpose. It multiplies the risks of capture, takes away certain causes of discontent, and adds to the motives for faithful service.

1890-06-28T00:00:00Z,"The view expressed by ex-Congressman SCOTT regarding the political situation in Pennsylvania is undoubtedly correct.

Yesterday, however, they taught the leaders that there were other teams that could play ball."

Without reverting to the means employed to carry the last Presidential election, it is plain that the most important legislation proposed at Washington is based upon this doctrine."

The periodical overhauling of the contents of this receptacle results in heterogeneous discoveries. This familiar illustration is perhaps the best introduction to the following notebook items:
1890-07-06T00:00:00Z,"MR. MORLEY AND JOUNALISM. -- Mr. Morley's comments upon contemporary journalism have the advantage of proceeding from a distinguished journalist. It would perhaps be a caricature of his speech, or part of it, to say that he defines journalism as the supply and demand of marketable mediocrity."
1890-07-06T00:00:00Z,"BAPTIZING AND BRANDING SLAVES. -- We were seated on the veranda of the residence, smoking, when there arrived a Catholic priest and an assistant, who passed on to the inclosure. Shortly after came a wagon filled with clothing, and being curious to witness anything else connected with the negroes, I followed. Inside the inclosure the negroes were drawn up in rows."
1890-07-06T00:00:00Z,"LONDON, June 24. -- The act of matriculation at Bonn meant to young William many things apart from the beginning of a university career. In fact, it was almost a sign of his emancipation from academic studies. He was a student among students in only a formal sense. The theory of a complete civic education was respected by his attendance at certain lectures and by his perfunctory compliance with sundry university regulations."
1890-07-06T00:00:00Z,"THE GAVOTTE AND THE BOURREE. -- The gavotte and the bourree can be variously assigned to Spain and France for their origin; but the jig -- homely appellation ! -- can be clearly traced to a most respectable antiquity. In the fourteenth and fifteenth centuries the name was variously written gigue, giga, and geig and signified simply ""the fiddle dance,"" from the German geige, ""a violin."""
1890-07-06T00:00:00Z,"LOUISVILLE, Ky., July 5. -- The accident at the Preston Street crossing of the Louisville Southern Railroad last night had a most fatal ending. Early yesterday morning Frank Akin, who lives on a large farm two miles from the city limits on the Preston Street Road, came into the city in his wagon for the purpose of taking out to his place a party of young people to spend the day."
1890-07-06T00:00:00Z,"LONG BRANCH, July 5. -- Up to nightfall on Wednesday the first four days of the week were the ideal Summer resort weather. People who came here to spend money and those who were here to make it were united in the opinion that the prestige of the old resort was returning and that this was to be the season that would eclipse all of its predecessors."
1890-07-06T00:00:00Z,"ST. JOSEPH, Mo., July 5. -- In September, 1861, Joseph Tribble murdered Thomas Kincaid with a butcher knife at Wathena, Kan. Tribble sympathized with the Confederate cause, while Kincaid was about to enlist in the Union Army. The murder was occasioned by the sectional feeling which was rife at the time and kept fomented by the bushwhackers and border ruffians who were numerous along the Kansas and Missouri borders."
1890-07-06T00:00:00Z,"BELVIDERE, N.J., July 5. -- If the weather is at all favorable the coming ten days the great fields of timothy and clover in Sussex and Warren Counties will be harvested. Old farmers say they never saw finer hay than this year's crop. The abundance of the crop is also phenomenal."
1890-07-06T00:00:00Z,"HOTEL KAATERSKILL, July 5. -- No better evidence can be given of the hold that the legend of Rip Van Winkle has taken upon the American mind, and no proof could be more convincing that all persons look with affection upon a wholly unselfish vagabond, than the unfailing interest with which tourists to the Catskills hunt out the places where the imaginary Rip ascended the mountains and took his twenty years' nap."
1890-07-06T00:00:00Z,"LONG BRANCH, July 5. -- The death of County Clerk Patterson at his home in Shrewsbury yesterday adds another to the many complications already existing in Monmouth County polities. There are at least a half-dozen candidates for Dr. Patterson's place, and the fact that the Governor will not appoint his successor until the election of a new Clerk in November will not prevent a bitter partisan strife before the convention for the nomination."
1890-07-06T00:00:00Z,"The benches under the big tree at the northwest corner of the City Hall Park seat fifteen persons and places upon them are in great demand these hot days. Beneath the widespreading branches of the great tree there is comfort which one cannot fail to appreciate, and it is noticeable that many of these who get sittings keep them for an unconscionably long time."
1890-07-06T00:00:00Z,"A cable dispatch dated at London yesterday states that a gas trust with a capital of 2,000,000 has lately been organized in England, and that it will operate in connection with the recently-formed American Gas Investment Company, which, it will be remembered, was incorporated under the laws of New-Jersey last month with a capitalization of $50,000,000."
1890-07-06T00:00:00Z,"VERY HIGH MOUNTAINS ARE NEW MOUNTAINS. -- At one time there can be little doubt that the colossal system of ancient peaks running right across the western continent from Nova Scotia and Labrador to the Missouri River must have equaled in magnitude the Himalayas, the Andes, or the Rocky Mountains."
1890-07-06T00:00:00Z,"A RUSSIAN OFFICIAL. -- When we descended into the street Herr von Hamilton told me that the nacselnik, whose official salary is about u600, is supposed to make an income of about u3,000 to u4,000 a year. Nothing is done, nothing carried out under his regime, but something remains in his palm behind."
1890-07-06T00:00:00Z,"There is one day in each month on which the soldiers of the regular army welcome the rising sun, no matter how much they grumble at being turned out of their bunks by the reveille to do so on other days, and that is pay day. Formerly this day of happy disbursement came only once in two months; now, however, the private has a chance to pocket his monthly stipend with monthly regularity."
1890-07-06T00:00:00Z,"MONTREAL, July 5. -- The prestige which recent events in the Province of Quebec has given to Canada as a field of operations for religious communities has just received fresh proof in the foundation of a new order here, the Franciscan Monks having opened a monastery which was consecrated with great pomp by Archbishop Fabre and his clerical household."
1890-07-06T00:00:00Z,"NEWPORT, R.I., July 5. -- Newport's season is booming. The large majority of the cottagers are here and the first indications of society and outdoor life have made their appearance. The Casino season has fairly begun, and with the first concert and hop of that centre of social splendor the round of gayety and entertainment may be considered to have commenced."
1890-07-06T00:00:00Z,"KINGSTON, N.Y., July 5. -- After quoting THE TIMES'S Washington dispatch relative to the appointment of George H. Sharpe as one of the Appraisers of the Port of New-York, the Kingston Daily Freeman (Republican) this evening says in a double-leaded editorial:"
1890-07-06T00:00:00Z,"RED BANK, N.J., July 5. -- This was a gala day for the North Shrewsbury River yachtsmen, who turned out with their fleet vessels to sail for the silver challenge cup given the club by the Neptune Club of the Navesink Highlands."
1890-07-06T00:00:00Z,"It is extremely interesting to know that the facts in the Hollander case are likely to be brought out. Mr. EDMUNDS having presented Mr. HOLLANDER'S memorial in the Senate, a resolution asking for full information from the State Department has been referred to the Committee on Foreign Affairs."
1890-07-06T00:00:00Z,"M. DE LA TUDE'S PETS. -- Though the rat can be fierce when called upon to defend its life, there is a softer side to its character which is often brought out by contact with man. Many instances of this could be adduced similar to that of the omnibus conductor's tame rat, which used to mount guard over its master's dinner and fly savagely at any one who ventured to come near it."
1890-07-06T00:00:00Z,"CHICAGO, July 5. -- Something of a flurry was caused in passenger circles to-day by the discovery that the Chicago, Burlington and Quincy had made a rate of a fare and one-third from all points on its lines to Western Springs and return on the occasion of the convention of Christian Workers, good going and returning from June 30 to Aug. 17, inclusive."
1890-07-06T00:00:00Z,"COOPERSTOWN, N.Y., July 5. -- The week at Cooperstown has been a quiet one. It is a few days too early for the number of daily arrivals to be sufficiently great to create any special excitement, and for the same reason the number of excursions from Richfield is small."
1890-07-06T00:00:00Z,"BOSTON, July 5. -- The annual regatta of the Eastern Yacht Club, which is to be sailed on Thursday, July 10, promises to be the best race sailed thus far this season. The chief advantage which the Eastern will have over the other clubs is in the big schooner class, where the Sea Fox, Merlin, and Mayflower will repeat their triangular contest of last year."
1890-07-06T00:00:00Z,"RICHFIELD SPRINGS, July 5. -- The excitement and bustle of the past week has been mostly confined to the railroad and hotel employes in taking care of the large number of arrivals. The cottages and smaller houses where visitors remain for the entire season are already well filled, and the big hotels have assumed the stir and life of a crowd."
1890-07-06T00:00:00Z,"It was at the breakfast table one bright morning in May that the subject was broached. ""Suppose we try living in the country this Summer,'' quietly suggested the wife in response to a few caustic remarks from the husband about the expensiveness of keeping house in the city."
1890-07-06T00:00:00Z,"THE LOCUST TREE AND COBBETT. -- Cobbett, during a forced residence in the United States from 1817 to 1819, occupied himself in farming on Long Island, where he established a small nursery for the propagation of fruit and timber trees. It was at this time that he came to the conclusion ""that nothing in the timber line could be so great a benefit as the general cultivation of the locust."""
1890-07-06T00:00:00Z,"PEEKSKILL, July 5. -- At 3 o'clock this afternoon the ninth season of the State Camp of Instruction was set in motion at this point by the Ninth Regiment, Col. William Seward, Jr. The organization, 450 strong, was entrained at the Grand Central Station at 1:15 and detrained at Roa Hook at 2:30. Heretofore, with a single exception, the custom has been to transport the troops from New-York to Peekskill by water."
1890-07-06T00:00:00Z,"APIA, Samoa, June 17. -- The United States steamer Mohican, with Consul General Sewall aboard, visited Pango-Pango several weeks ago and took formal possession of two pieces of land there which were ceded to the United States by the Samoan Government. King Malietoa received his first salute, May 22. He visited the Mohican in a new whaleboat recently presented to Chief Seumann Tafa by the American Government."
1890-07-06T00:00:00Z,"A writer in the Westminster Review makes the appearance of Dr. REASCH'S book on the ""Index Librorum Prohibitorum"" the occasion of an article on the literary censorship of the Catholic Church. The article is not in the least polemical, but is simply a statement of the facts."
1890-07-06T00:00:00Z,"WASHINGTON, July 5. -- The United States Treasurer now holds in United States bonds to secure national bank circulation $145,299,550, as follows: Currency 6s, $4,923,000; 4 1/2 per cents, $39,411,750; 4 per cents, $100,964.800."
1890-07-06T00:00:00Z,"Perhaps it was a bolt of lightning from the sky; perhaps only the fire that a cave-dweller built to cook a steak cut off a mammoth's flank. At any rate it was a prehistoric fire that burned its way into the seam of coal in Coal Canyon, Wyoming, and left ashes to be discovered in this latter end of the nineteenth century by cowboys."
1890-07-06T00:00:00Z,"NARRAGANSETT PIER, July 5. -- The beach is already quite gay at the bathing hour, and hotel parlor hops are beginning, though social gayety will date from the opening of the Casino hops, now postponed to the 7th. The macadamized highway is within a few days of completion, at the Pier proper, and the absurd apprehension that has prevailed as to hampered pleasure driving proves without foundation."
1890-07-06T00:00:00Z,"ON NOVEL WRITING. -- No romance is any the worse, but far the better, for being well written. To be well written it must be suitably written, and the style which is excellent for a sober, delicate, scientific story is not so excellent for a tale of adventure. Even the novel-publishing newspapers, as long as they get their weekly allowance of incident, do not grumble, probably because the language is good."
1890-07-06T00:00:00Z,"SARATOGA, N.Y., July 5. -- The season is unusually early. There are more people in Saratoga to-day than on the corresponding date for a number of years. The month of June, too, has shown a remarkable list of arrivals and hotel men are felicitating themselves that the preliminary weeks have been got through with so profitably."
1890-07-06T00:00:00Z,"The Assistant Deputy Factory Inspectors have just completed their annual inspection of the factories in this city. They do not go into as many details of their experiences as formerly, nor do they designate as many factories where they found the factory laws to have been violated. Their reports are much more general in their terms than formerly."
1890-07-06T00:00:00Z,"WAD-EL-NAJUMI, THE DERVISH CHIEFTAIN. -- He was a religious enthusiast of the type of Loyola, and had perfect confidence in the justice of the Mahdi's claims to be the conqueror of the world; he was consequently indifferent to the character of the means employed to accomplish that end. Both at Argin and Toski he displayed consummate knowledge of the art of war."
1890-07-06T00:00:00Z,"LONG BRANCH, July 5. -- Seated on the broad veranda of his Summer cottage, Rear Admiral Oliver S. Glisson of Philadelphia invited THE TIMES'S correspondent to a chair beside his own. Hale and hearty, the Admiral, now in his eighty- second year, had devoted a portion of the morning to his vegetable garden in the rear and his pretty flower beds in front of his cottage."
1890-07-06T00:00:00Z,"The past week closes up the half year, and except the month of May it has not been a very lively one on the Stock Exchange. That month brought plenty of business. In the second half of the year we shall have a spell of activity as great or greater, but just when it will start and how long it will run it is useless to speculate upon. The midsummer dullness is on us now."
1890-07-06T00:00:00Z,"LONDON, July 5. -- Since the tremendous blow in the body delivered to it by the Barrow electors on Wednesday, the poor Torycum-Unionist Government has been in such a pitiful condition that formere mercy's sake its enemies are giving it time to recover breath. The shock of this blow cannot be described to those who study English politics from a distance."
1890-07-06T00:00:00Z,"NYACK, July 5. -- The most of the people from New-York and Brooklyn who own pretty Summer homes in this place are now here for the season, and a majority of them will remain until the 1st of October."

1890-07-06T00:00:00Z,"There is a determined effort being made in the Senate to change the rules of that body so that the previous question may be ordered by the vote of a majority. The leader in this movement is the restless Mr. CHANDLER, who has lost none of the defiant energy and the entire self-confidence that marked him when his influence in national politics was far greater than it is now or will ever be again."
1890-07-06T00:00:00Z,"PITTSBURG, July 5. -- The immense volume of iron and steel manufactured in the Pittsburg district the first six months of this year differs but little from the corresponding period in 1889. The reason is that mills have not materially increased their capacity. Carnegie Brothers Co., Jones Laughlin, and the Oliver Iron and Steel Company daily finished about 3,200 tons, nearly one-half of the output of the district, which is fully 7,000 tons."
1890-07-06T00:00:00Z,"DELANE OF THE LONDON TIMES. -- This gentleman had not his equal in Europe during the whole of a long career; nor has any one neared him since. He was not a very capable writer in the literary sense, I believe; but I have seen letters of his fifteen or twenty lines long, with the whole pith of a policy in each, together with full suggestions for its complete development."
1890-07-06T00:00:00Z,Conflicting stories come from the isthmus about the result of Lieut. WYSE'S negotiations with the Colombian Government for an extension of the Panama Canal concession. It is difficult to see how the completion of the projected canal will be hastened by any extension or renewal of the terms of the original agreement so long as no European power shall guarantee interest on the capital that would be required.
1890-07-06T00:00:00Z,"THE GREAT ANT-EATER. -- It is a most uncanny-looking creature; its curious little head, with small eyes and ears, and extraordinarily long snout ending in a diminutive mouth; its great fore limbs armed with enormous claws, which it carries folded in upon its palms, and its huge, bushy tail giving it an odd appearance of being all out of proportion."
1890-07-06T00:00:00Z,"President Harrison has approved the Dependent Pension bill. His act is not a surprise, but it is to be regretted. The Republican Party is now formally committed to an ultra-radical theory of pension giving. The bill puts 250,000 names on the rolls, and increases the pensions of 50,000 persons already enrolled. Estimates of its annual cost vary from $35,000,000 to $100,000,000."
1890-07-06T00:00:00Z,"The system of naval training which Admiral Luce defines as ""bringing up sailors on fresh milk and green grass"" is being very generally discussed among naval officers nowadays, and the movement in favor of the abolition of the old sail system of training with a substitution of new physical apparatus bids fair to result in general changes to the personnel of the service."
1890-07-06T00:00:00Z,"ST. LOUIS, July 5. -- A suit brought by Bernard J. Reilly, a prominent and wealthy real estate speculator, against Miss Eugenia Ivory, a well-known young society lady, in the First District Police Court to-day, for breach of the peace, developed an interesting sensation. Reilly and Miss Ivory are members of St. Xavier's Church, the aristocratic Catholic congregation of the city."
1890-07-06T00:00:00Z,"WASHINGTON, July 5. -- The conferrees on the Silver bill failed to get together to-day because the Democratic members of the committee were not on hand. The Republican members talked about the bill in an informal way, but to no particular purpose. It is confidently asserted, however, that an agreement will be reached before the end of next week."
1890-07-06T00:00:00Z,"KINGSTON, N.Y., July 5. -- The continued hot weather is filling up the Summer resorts in the Catskill range. Those famous mountain hotels, the Grand and the Old Catskill Mountain House, will retain their popularity, while the other hotels and boarding houses are fast receiving their full quota of guests."
1890-07-06T00:00:00Z,"The New-Rochelle Yacht Club had a very successful regatta yesterday. It was the fifth annual regatta of the club, and the yachtsmen were favored with a fine day for sailing. The water was smooth, and a cool northerly breeze tempered the heat of a burning July sun. A large fleet of yachts sailed over the courses prescribed for their respective classes."
1890-07-06T00:00:00Z,"NYACK, July 5. -- The opening full-dross hop of the season occurred to-night at the Tappan Zee Hotel, South Nyack, and was the most largely-attended and brilliant ever held at that Summer resort. The hotel is crowded with city guests, and a large number of them participated in the festivities of the occasion."
1890-07-06T00:00:00Z,"The grumblers over the reported census figures in regard to the population of this city can take comfort to themselves in the fact that if the figures announced are correct, population has not begun to keep pace with the city's increase of wealth. If there are not so many of us as we hoped there were, we are all richer than in any former census year."
1890-07-06T00:00:00Z,"There was a large attendance yesterday afternoon at Ridgewood Park, where the National Athletic Club of Brooklyn held its first annual games. There were a large number of contestants from the various well-known clubs. The feature of the day was the putting of the sixteen-pound shot by George R. Gray, the champion of the New-York Athletic Club, who threw the weight 46 feet 1 inch."
1890-07-06T00:00:00Z,"TRELAWNY. -- At Spezzia an old man on his deathbed confessed to having been in the boat that ran down the Ariel in July, 1822. Trelawny was firmly convinced of the truth of this story, and told me that he personally had never doubted the fact that Shelley's boat was run down in the hope of finding Byron's dollars on board."
1890-07-06T00:00:00Z,"The proposed giving up of Heligoland by England to Germany in consideration of the African division of territory, of which much has already been made public, has called out in the London papers many articles in regard to this small island. The Times observes that ""in itself the connection between the little Frisian island and Great Britain"" is extremely slight, and is not even sacred by long prescription."
1890-07-06T00:00:00Z,"Off Hallett's Point, which is at Hell Gate, there was at about 6 o'clock last evening a collision between an iron steamship and a barge loaded with excursionists, which resulted in injuring a number of persons, but no one fatally, and in seriously injuring both of the collided vessels. It was marvelous that the collision was not attended by a terrible sacrifice of human life."
1890-07-06T00:00:00Z,"TOPEKA, Kan., July 5. -- The anti-Ingalls feeling is increasing to such an extent that the Republican leaders may be forced to throw him overboard in order to save their craft. Many of these leaders are ardent Ingalls men, not that they love him, but they have an intense admiration for his ability. However, they are not so intense in their devotion that they would lose their hold upon the State Government."
1890-07-06T00:00:00Z,"THE FIST INTERVIEWER. -- The life of James Boswell was a series of interviews, and, if interviewers ever hate their patron saint, he ought to be beatified for the office. In his time interviewing did not openly avow itself as such. It was performed under difficulties which will make the present practitioners of the art smile."
1890-07-06T00:00:00Z,"HARTFORD, July 5. -- A civil service reform incident has just occurred here which is worth a moment's notice, Col. B.F. Blakeslee, the special Government agent at the stamped envelope works, recently advised the removal of an inefficient Republican clerk, suggesting the thing to Gen. Hawley."
1890-07-06T00:00:00Z,It is safe to say that there has never been an out-of-door entertainment in this country so provocative of laughter and so thoroughly enjoyable in all its aspects as the Gymkhana Races given by the Rockaway Hunting Club at Cedarhurst yesterday afternoon. Everything contributed to the success of the event.
1890-07-06T00:00:00Z,The investigations and experiments made by Dr. KLEIN and others for the enlightenment and guidance of the health authorities of London have attracted attention and been of service in all parts of the world. Especially interesting and important have been the facts thus collected which relate to the transmission of certain infectious diseases from animals to man or from human beings to animals.
1890-07-06T00:00:00Z,"THE DANISH DRAMA OF TO-DAY. -- Many Englishmen find a curious difficulty in realizing that the three Scandinavian kingdoms are three indeed -- distinct in polity, in language, and in manners. Sweden, as the largest country of the three, is apt to swallow up her sister kingdoms in the popular imagination."
1890-07-06T00:00:00Z,"By the courtesy of the publishers the Pall Mall Gazette is enabled to give some extracts from ""Bismark Intime,"" a gossipy volume about the ex-Chancellor, which they publish in London.

1890-07-06T00:00:00Z,"COLUMBUS, Ohio, July 5. -- The passage of the Federal election law by the House has proved a surprise to the Republicans and Democrats alike. While the Republicans of the State demanded that there should be something done to secure fair elections in the Southern States, few belived that a measure so Sweeping in its character could or would be passed."
1890-07-06T00:00:00Z,""" Let us go up to the Hoffman first,"" said the old Californian, ""and I'll show you a number of gilded Pacific coasters who do not know to a million or two what they are really worth. With the exception of D.O. Mills, and one or two others, none of them had as many hundreds of dollars as you have fingers on your hands when they first put their hopeful faces in Sacramento.''"
1890-07-06T00:00:00Z,"TREACHEROUS ARABS. -- To prove how dangerous it was to show any clemency to the Arabs from among the enemy, the following incident which occurred at Bellana will afford a good example. An English officer of the mounted corps, returning from a reconnoissance, saw under a reek an Arab and two women."
1890-07-06T00:00:00Z,"NORRISTOWN, Penn., July 5. -- The Rev.

1890-07-06T00:00:00Z,"BERLIN, July 5. -- There are growing signs of an impending storm in the Balkans.

The entrance is through a porte cochere into a large and beautiful hall, which is paneled and finished in native woods."

Damon, resigned; Charles N. Spencer, Minister of the Interior, vice Lorin A. Thurston, resigned, and Arthur P. Peterson, Attorney General, vice C.W. Ashford."
1890-07-06T00:00:00Z,"THE VICTIM OF EXCESSIVE INDUSTRY. -- Some men work because they love work and hate play. They do net shine in society; they have no conversation; the fair sex are not passing fair to their distorted vision; the whitewashed ceiling of their office and its shabby fittings are more attractive to them than landscapes or Italian skies, and they are under the agreeable thrall of no diverting hobbies."
1890-07-06T00:00:00Z,"One of the most popular amusement resorts at present open in the city is the Eden Musee, where a light and pleasing programme is provided. Prince Kanekici, the Japanese juggler, and Yank Hoe, the magician, continue to compete for public approval."

1890-07-06T00:00:00Z,"ENGLISH COURT ETIQUETTE. -- Etiquette is the very life and health of a Court. It is observed even in the arrangements of seats. On each side of the small low dais, intended exclusively for royalty, are rows of chairs which, I was told, were definitely and clearly assigned, not by law, but by absolute although unwritten custom, to the different orders in the social scale who accept the Queen's invitation."

The weather was delightful, but the interest had died away, so that the attendance was small. Marendes ended the postponed pacing race in the first heat to-day, beating G.R.S. handily in 2:20 1/2, the betting being even on the two."
1890-07-06T00:00:00Z,"There seems to be some likelihood that the West End bribery scandal in the Massachusetts Legislature may have an important political effect in the State, as it certainly ought to have. The investigating committee showed a singular lack of sensitiveness in regard to the indirect bribery to which the West End Company had resorted and to which the members of the Legislature had cheerfully submitted."

July 5. -- Society in this city is resting after the festivities of the Winter and Spring, and the city is rapidly becoming deserted by the loaders, who are leaving daily for the seashore or the mountains.

As a matter of fact, its presence is obviously natural and the explanation of it more than simple."
1890-07-06T00:00:00Z,"With extreme reserve, the London Daily Telegraph ventures to think, should be received the statement that a powerful English syndicate, including two well-known manufacturers of china, has been formed for the purpose of acquiring the works, the stock, and the trade mark of the historic manufactory of Sevres, near Paris, an institution which appears likely to come into the market at no distant date."

On a certain day a few weeks ago, when I went out to the stable to feed Floss, she was standing with her head drooped, and she would not eat.

It was all due to the fine pitching by a youngster named Luby of the Texas League. Anson's men played with more vim and dash than their opponents. They deserved to get the game. Welch pitched in a way that would generally win. The men back of him could not hit the ball.
1890-07-09T00:00:00Z,"BRIDGEPORT, Conn., July 8. -- The thirteenth annual State Turn fest, which has been in session in this city since last Saturday, closed to-night. To-day there was a grand parade of the societies and invited guests and a picnic held at East End Park."

It appears, as the result of investigation, that a majority of those who have been working and shouting for a law that should grant pensions for service, without regard to disability, are men who entered the army in the late years of the war and were led to do so not by their patriotism but by the large bounties that were offered."
1890-07-10T00:00:00Z,"TOPEKA, July 9. -- In Kansas this is the farmers' and the soldiers' year in politics. At least it is the year for the farmer who hangs about the country store, and the soldier who enlisted at a late day during the war and received a large bounty.

1890-07-10T00:00:00Z,"At the convocation of the University of New-York last night Chancellor CURTIS of the Board of Regents explained in his lucid way the misunderstood question what the State University is and what function the Regents exercise.

1890-07-10T00:00:00Z,"The change in King KALAKAUA'S Cabinet, though brought about by a pending vote in the Legislature declaring a want of confidence, probably does not indicate any important change in governmental policy.

1890-07-11T00:00:00Z,"If a strong-lunged man had stood in the betting ring yesterday at Monmouth Park and shouted ""cash"" at the top of his voice there would have been a lot of fellows who would have been real mad.

For strategic purposes it was worthless."
1890-07-12T00:00:00Z,"There was more brilliant playing in the game at the Polo Grounds yesterday than is usually seen in a game nowadays. The feature was Glasscock's work.

There are primeval forests in our Sierra, and mountain lakes and streams that dwarf into insignificance the woods and lakes of the Adirondacks, which for years have been one of the great sporting districts of the East.

During the game three players were injured quite severely. Charles Conover, the visitors' second baseman, was struck in the breast and knocked down by Joseph Steinberg, who was running from first. Conover had to be carried off the field."
1890-07-13T00:00:00Z,"CHICAGO, July 12. -- Only three of the downtown theatres were open this week, and at none of them was there an altered programme. The audiences have been better than during the previous week, due no doubt to the cooler weather."
1890-07-13T00:00:00Z,"WASHINGTON, July 12. -- Once more the Senate, ignoring the enormous inroads upon the revenues of the Government already made in this session of Congress, has done what it can toward taking more millions from the Treasury for the benefit of a few persons at the expense of the many. The two subsidy measures known as the Frye shipping bills were passed by the Senate to-day by substantially a party vote."
1890-07-13T00:00:00Z,"There is something rather comical in ex-Alderman DUFFY'S idea of bringing a suit against JOHN KEENAN to recover the ""boodle"" out of which he was cheated in the division of plunder in 1884. DUFFY claims that KEENAN was the trustee of a fund of $750,000 which was to be divided among fifteen Aldermen, share and share alike."
1890-07-13T00:00:00Z,"The determination of the Jersey City Board of Aldermen to appropriate the Newark Councilmen's Salary act and to claim a salary of $750 per year for each member is believed by those on the inside to be one development of the fight against the local ringsters. Alderman and City Collector ""Paddy"" O'Neill, the local Pooh-Bah and chief lieutenant of ""Boss"" Bob Davis, is said to be the objective point of attack."
1890-07-13T00:00:00Z,"In addition to the permanent attractions at the Eden Musee a fine collection of oil paintings are on view in the art gallery to-day. The customary concerts will be given. Ofero, a famous Spanish dancer, and her company have been engaged for the Musee, and will soon appear."
1890-07-13T00:00:00Z,Mr. QUINN'S bill providing for the reduction of letter postage to one cent on local letters in free-delivery cities of more than one hundred thousand inhabitants is open to several objections. It makes a discrimination which the smaller towns are not likely to approve and which is hardly just.
1890-07-13T00:00:00Z,"Commodore Newberry D. Lawton of the Atlantic Yacht Club was busily engaged last week making final arrangements for the club's annual cruise. Judging from the present outlook, the cruise promises to be the most successful one in the history of the club. The cruise last year was enjoyable from start to finish, but Commodore Lawton says that he expects even more boats to go this year than last."
1890-07-13T00:00:00Z,"Can any one match the following as an instance of canine intelligence? A party of children had spent the forenoon in a huckleberry pasture. A dog belonging to a Mr. Prindle, father of one of the children, had been with them. (If he was like a dog I know, he had hunted out a patch of blackberries, and had gone into business, picking and eating, on his own account.)"
1890-07-13T00:00:00Z,"THE HIVE AND ITS ANALOGIES. -- The hive is analogous to human society, in that the male sex has the best part of existence, the most comfortable and favorable lot. Let us see. The drones are ""the lazy fathers of th' industrious hive."" The queen is the one and only fully-developed female in each hive, but there are, at a certain season, a vast number of idle gentlemen lounging around."
1890-07-13T00:00:00Z,"Without ceremony or formality the Aqueduct Commission will go up to Central Park Tuesday morning and open the gates that will let the water from the new aqueduct flow into the reservoir.

1890-07-13T00:00:00Z,"The New-York squatter is an impassible specimen of humanity, if the behavior of some in the neighborhood of Mount Morris Park may be taken as a characteristic of the species. Upon a knoll of rock at the southwest corner of Madison Avenue and One Hundred and Eighteenth Street are several shanties occupied by a populous community."
1890-07-13T00:00:00Z,"PARIS, July 12. -- The most important political action during the week was the decision of the Superior Council of Commerce that in the forthcoming Tariff bill raw-silk materials shall be placed on the free list. The Temps, which usually speaks the Government's mind on such occasions, considers this the most important political action of the year, and declares that it assures the continued prosperity of Lyons over her Italian and other rivals."
1890-07-13T00:00:00Z,"CHICAGO, July 12. -- A dispatch from Indianapolis, Ind., says: ""Mrs. Ernest Prentice died Wednesday. Her last request was that there should be no funeral sermon or ceremony.

Palmer, manager of the Madison Square and Palmer's Theatres, has written to a friend in this city, giving his opinion of some of the plays which are now running in London.

Mr. Palmer writes:..."

1890-07-13T00:00:00Z,"Everything points to lively racing of forties at Newport after the New-York Yacht Club's cruise. With the Gossoon, Minerva, Tomahawk, Papoose, Ventura, Liris, Choctaw, Mariquita, and possibly one or two others, racing will be as interesting as it was last year."
1890-07-13T00:00:00Z,"Two very contrary views are expressed about the character of the Sultan, and the Occidental mind, which has considerable difficulty in understanding Oriental society, is at a loss which to choose. Prof. VAMBERY'S view is precisely the opposite of that which Sir HENRY ELLIOT expressed two years ago in the Nineteenth Century."
1890-07-13T00:00:00Z,"SCHOOLEY'S MOUNTAIN, N.J., July 12. -- This is a charming old place, with its quaint air of antiquity and its modern comforts. It was at Schooley's in 1793 that the first Summer resort hotel in America, the Heart House, opened its doors. The fame of the Chalybeate Springs of the mountain had passed the confines of Indian story, and the great folks of the Nation traveled in the Schooley stages up the German Valley."
1890-07-13T00:00:00Z,"WITHIN PARIS. -- Paris is the chief receptacle of the veriest scum of the whole earth. All the villains who can no longer remain in their own countries, for they would have to pay the penalty of their misdeeds, come here, destitute and desperate, ready for any uproar, hoping for some profit by fishing in troubled waters."

Bruce conducted the sale, and after the Woodburn yearlings were disposed of nine yearlings, the property of Mr. August Belmont, and a miscellaneous lot were sold. The Woodburn lot was the best that has yet been brought on East, the colts being an especially good-looking set."
1890-07-13T00:00:00Z,"THE POLITICAL SONG. -- Miss Skilly is finest in her patriotic songs, when she assumes to be a stiff old Tory, artfully rousing the political passions of both parties in the House. There is a sad impressiveness mingled with defiance in these songs, and the shade of an illustrious defunct is made to flit across the stage. The burden is something of this pattern:"
1890-07-13T00:00:00Z,"MIDDLETOWN, N.Y., July 12. -- Another stage has been reached in the famous Crandall-Densmore litigation, which has for some years vexed the civil and criminal courts of the interior of State."
1890-07-13T00:00:00Z,"Joan of Arc has had another apotheosis here. Since the day when the German army evacuated this city in 1873 it has never presented so festive an appearance as yesterday and to-day. About thirty descendents of Joan's brothers were the lions of the fete and represented her family. Most of them bear aristocratic names, and four of them that of ""Du Lys,"" which Jacques d'Arc was authorized to bear."
1890-07-13T00:00:00Z,"WASHINGTON, July 12. -- The ""compromise"" Silver bill, as it is called, which, in the estimation of the Democrats, is an infinitely worse measure than a straight-out free-coinage bill would be, was passed in the House this afternoon, after four hours of debate, by a majority of 32 votes. The division was on strictly party lines, the 122 affirmative votes being Republicans and the 90 negative votes being Democrats."

1890-07-13T00:00:00Z,"In the Spring the yachtsman's fancy lightly turns to thoughts of sails, and before the squadron cruise each other petty voyage pales. Then he feels the wild pulsation of balloon jib topsail strife, and the time allowance squabble with its curse on yachting life. Still he yearns for the excitement that the coming cruise will yield, eager-hearted as a boy when first he leaves his father's field."
1890-07-13T00:00:00Z,"NEWPORT, R.I., July 12. -- The chief event of interest this week was the Winthrop-Heckscher wedding, which, though so early in the season, drew hosts of people here and made the cottages as full of guests as they are in the latter part of August, when the season is at its height. There was an especially large number of young people on hand, and everybody was delighted with the success of the event."
1890-07-13T00:00:00Z,"RICHFIELD SPRINGS, N.Y., July 12. -- The gayety of the season may be said to have begun, and it is hard to say what form of amusement is most popular. Perhaps the saddle has as much attraction as anything else, and all ages are represented. Mrs. Earle, wife of William P. Earle of New-York, for many years proprietor of Earle's Hotel, rides every morning."
1890-07-13T00:00:00Z,"ALEXANDRIA BAY, July 12. -- With an average temperature of about 60 the frequenters of the St. Lawrence have been having a cool time of it this week.

1890-07-13T00:00:00Z,"The accession of Mr. Horace E. Scudder to the editorial chair of the Atlantic recalls the line of distinguished editors who have conducted this magazine, and suggests still broader possibilities for its future. Mr. Lowell, Mr. Fields, Mr. Howells, and Mr. Aldrich are a notable line of editors, and if Mr. Aldrich must return to his first love, the Muses, it is fortunate that such a successor is found as Mr. Scudder."
1890-07-13T00:00:00Z,"PITTSBURG, July 12. -- Quay and Delamater are getting hit all round. The Leader to-night condemns them editorially.

1890-07-13T00:00:00Z,"POINT PLEASANT, N.J., July 12. -- The advent of an excursion party of nearly 2,000 from Newark on Wednesday greatly enlivened this already lively resort. The party came on three trains, and took possession of a goodly share of the river and the bathing houses. But Point Pleasant congratulates itself upon a large territory and plenty of room for its regular Summer population and as many transient guests as may wish to come."
1890-07-13T00:00:00Z,"PITTSBURG, July 12. -- The most remarkable case in the history of the Poor Board of this city was terminated to-day.

1890-07-13T00:00:00Z,"LAKE GEORGE, July 12. -- Tuesday was considered one of the hottest days experienced here in years. The thermometer registered 93 in the shade at 3 o'clock, when suddenly, about 5 o'clock, a decided change took place, and a fierce wind storm raged for half an hour. After that it was somewhat cooler, but about 8 o'clock the wind began to blow furiously and another storm set in."

Certainly our Government cannot complain of this step."
1890-07-13T00:00:00Z,"THE DEBT OF GREECE. -- The little kingdom was, so to speak, born in debt, for the three protecting powers started it on its career with a loan of 60,000,000. Greece was then, as a recent writer says, ""a heap of smoking ruins bathed in blood."" Apart from her lamentable condition, the narrow limits assigned to her by the powers made it almost impossible that she could exist on her own resources."
1890-07-14T00:00:00Z,Ex-King Milan's stay at Belgrade seems likely to bring about a change in the state of affairs in Servia. About three months ago one of the best-known diplomatists in Europe told me he looked upon a coup d'etat or pronunciamento in favor of Queen Nathalie as not improbable. It may be that King Milan entertained a similar apprehension.

The originator of the hostilities is a fair young maiden, the daughter of Dr. J.G. Beattie of Succasunna, but the present cause of trouble is Dr. Beattie himself. Personally Dr. Beattie is a gentleman of much culture; politically he still affiliates with the South, which was his great war-time love."

1890-07-18T00:00:00Z,"After the last election in Ohio, one of the things that seemed quite beyond question was that the leaders of the campaign on the Republican side would not be the leaders of another campaign in that State for some time to come. The forged paper that was used, and most unscrupulously and partially used, to defame the Democratic candidate was not less scandalous as a ""campaign document"" for being also very ridiculous."
1890-07-18T00:00:00Z,"If the New-York Steam Company were engaged in a systematic effort to demonstrate how many different kinds of a public nuisance it could be at one and the same time, it could hardly accomplish more than it has done with no such object in view.

The operatives, under the pestilent lead of a Russian agitator, are refusing to go back to work unless all the ""scabs,"" as in their genial way they call the non-union workmen, are discharged outright.

1890-07-20T00:00:00Z,"DISCRIMINATION. -- The retentive faculty is, of course, the common attribute of all intelligence, knowledge being dependent on the plastic property of mind. But where there is great retentiveness, we have undoubtedly the material out of which rare intellectual capacities are made. Generally, but by no means universally, retentiveness as a mental gift is due to some emotional interest."
1890-07-20T00:00:00Z,"The real estate market during last week was monopolized by investors. It seems that the demand for this class of property will not be likely to subside in any degree during the warm weather. Brokers who enjoy the favor of capitalists are just now in clover in respect to orders for real estate purchases. They find, however, that it is one thing to receive orders and another to execute them in the present market."
1890-07-20T00:00:00Z,"There are two sections of the new ballot law, 26 and 27, which, if not officially interpreted, are going to cause considerable confusion, and perhaps something worse. This is the view of Brooklyn police officials, who, although they will have to enforce the law, are ignorant of how these two sections should be read."

1890-07-20T00:00:00Z,"Much has been said and written of the new parks. Yet how few of the people of New-York, the masses of the people, to whom park lands are by right and sentiment especially dedicated, know of the vast heritage they have acquired, through the city's purchase, for themselves and the successors, in the northern end of the announced district."
1890-07-20T00:00:00Z,"The cemetery at Brooklyn, Conn., contains a grave which has long been the subject of research and discussion among the local antiquarians. Near the place where the body of Gen. Israel Putnam lay buried from the time of his death in 1790 until it was removed at the completion of the equestrian statue to him at Brooklyn, in 1888, is another of a woman who died two years later than ""Old Put."""
1890-07-20T00:00:00Z,"ROME, Ga., July 19. -- The farmers living near Rome are alarmed over the appearance of a horde of awkward-looking green grasshoppers that are playing havoc with the crops. The hoppers are described as of medium size and of a bright green color. They have no wings, but can cover a large amount of ground, as they jump equal to a scared bull frog."
1890-07-20T00:00:00Z,Paradise Park mass meetings are always interesting. One held there last night was especially unique. It could not have happened in any other spot but Paradise Park. The announcement stated that it was called by the Associated Trades for the purpose of protesting against the unwarranted and arbitrary action of the Board of Health in serving notice on the New-York Steam Heating and Power Company to cut off its steam power.
1890-07-20T00:00:00Z,"Through the exertions of Mr. Sol B. Solomon the guests of the Long Beach Hotel have contributed $300 in aid of the Sanitarium for Hebrew children, whose object is to furnish free excursions to the poor children of that faith in this city.

1890-07-20T00:00:00Z,"COLUMBUS, Ohio, Judy 19. -- Very little comment is made on the work of the Republican State Convention, it having been discounted weeks ago. As was predicted, the convention utterly ignored the civil-service law, although it is generally understood that one of its most aggressive opponents in the Republican Congressional delegation favored a resolution demanding a repeal of the law."
1890-07-20T00:00:00Z,"Every year Norway becomes more popular with tourists during the Summer months; the steamers that ply up and down the fiords are already rivals to the railways and coaches of Switzerland, and it may be that the time is coming when Norwegians will be known to the traveling public very much as the Swiss are, as a nation of innkeepers."
1890-07-20T00:00:00Z,"HOW AFRICA IS TO BE WORKED. -- Hitherto a very small capital, and that employed in a somewhat half-hearted way, has been expended on working the affairs of the two or three companies which are supposed to ""exploit"" Africa. Everything else has been done by an odd combination of religion, sport, pleasure tripping, geographical exploration, and the ivory trade."
1890-07-20T00:00:00Z,"YOSEMITE, Cal., July 13. -- The Yosemite Commissioners held their annual meeting in the valley the first week in June last. The assemblage was something less of a pleasure party than usual, for the Commissioners were evidently discomposed by the knowledge of the widespread indignation at and contempt for their mismanagement."
1890-07-20T00:00:00Z,"HALIFAX, N.S., July 19. -- The mail which arrived from Newfoundland to-day brings some news of interest from that colony. Fishermen at Bay l'Argent refuse to catch lobsters on account of nine inches being the size fixed by law and enforced by fishery wardens. There are no large lobsters in this bay, and factories will have to close."
1890-07-20T00:00:00Z,"THE WAYS OF CAESAR. -- Napoleon, we are told, was dressed every morning by the valet in attendance. He did not don a single garment himself; eventually, however, he was induced to shave himself. It happened in this wise: In 1803 the head valet, Hambard, pleaded ill health as an excuse for not accompanying his master to Boulogne."
1890-07-20T00:00:00Z,"Private advices from London say that Gen. Horace Porter, Vice President of the Pullman Palace Car Company, is arranging for a dinner to be eaten in Paris by the American railroad Presidents now in Europe.

Depew, Henry Villard, Austin Corbin, President Ledyard of the Michigan Central, and Gen. E.F. Winslow, an ex-railroad President."
1890-07-20T00:00:00Z,"NATURAL WANTS -- A PRETTY AND A CLEVER WIFE. -- ""The best partis pick out the prettiest women, by preference just now pretty Americans. Marriage is the grand test of men's opinion, and in marriage the most cultivated are not the most successful."" The answer to that gibe, which one hears pretty often, and which, though substantially false, has a surface truth in it, is contained in the simple question, ""Why should they be?"""
1890-07-20T00:00:00Z,"The Silver bill became a law last Monday. Because the stock market remained dull some people seem to have an idea that as a bull influence silver legislation is a delusion. But the market is likely to be quiet at this time under any circumstance. If prices had jumped on the bill being signed by the President, it would have been only from speculative operations in anticipation of its results."
1890-07-20T00:00:00Z,ENGLISH PUBLIC HOUSES. -- Public houses in England have always been under police control. In the manor courts they are under the supervision of two officers annually checked by the homage. When the local jurisdiction of the parish was gradually and finally transferred to the Justices the licensing system of our day commenced.
1890-07-20T00:00:00Z,"SARATOGA, July 19. -- Loiterers in the city of waters read almost incredibly of the fierce heat in New-York and other places. So tempered is the air up here among the foothills of the Adirondacks, and so perfect the shade of Saratoga's tree-lined avenues, that midsummer weather is robbed of its terrors when it crosses her threshold."
1890-07-20T00:00:00Z,"An ineffectual attempt was made in London on Friday afternoon, June 27, to sell by public auction the freehold estate, 124 acres in extent, upon which stands Camden Place, the country house in which Charles Louis Bonaparte, Emperor of the French under the title of Napoleon III., breathed his last on Jan. 9, 1873.

Her case has excited universal wonder and pity. She is now worn down to a mere shadow and has been practically unconscious since Sunday last."
1890-07-20T00:00:00Z,"ON THE ART OF ILLUSTRATING. -- What would be thought of a daily newspaper which printed in its columns a notice like this: ""Please write English, please spell properly, please write legibly and on one side of the paper!"" But the instructions given to art contributors to the Daily Graphic are no less primitive."
1890-07-20T00:00:00Z,"CAMP ABBETT, SEA GIRT, N.J., July 19. -- The Second Brigade or the New-Jersey National Guard arrived here to-day, to remain until next Saturday night.

1890-07-20T00:00:00Z,"Now that the minds of the Mayor and officials of Brooklyn are relieved from the responsibilities attaching to a town that is the ""third city in the Union,"" perhaps they will turn their attention to one matter in which Brooklyn has an unenviable pre-eminence -- the filth and unseemliness of the only approach to the great bridge by which it is connected with New-York."
1890-07-20T00:00:00Z,"READING, Penn., July 19. -- A party of three young farmers of Bern Township, this county, sallied out last Tuesday afternoon to rob a bumblebees' nest of its honey.

Part of her cargo consisted of ten boxes of gold, each containing 10,000. After some delay divers were sent out with the latest appliances, and nine out of the ten boxes of specie were brought up."
1890-07-20T00:00:00Z,"The dilapidated condition of Ocean Avenue and the bluffat this place shows plainly the enervating tendencies and results of a patronizing Government. This dilapidation and destruction of the bluff has been going on from time prehistoric and is due solely to the inroads of the ocean on the Jersey shore, although a few eminent geologists affirm that there is ample proof that the shore borders of the State are sinking."
1890-07-20T00:00:00Z,"LONDON, July 5. -- The fact that the Crown Prince Frederick, despondent and unnerved, in the presence of a mortal disease, had voluntarily pledged himself to renounce his rights of succession, was naturally not published to the world. Although it is beyond doubt that such a pledge was given, nothing more definite than a roundabout hint has to this day been printed in Germany upon the subject."
1890-07-20T00:00:00Z,"CURLING AND TODDY. -- Should you be a Southron, a stranger, and no player, you are agreeably struck by the evidences of genial good-fellowship and the easy mingling of many classes. The best man comes to the front and is chosen as skip, whether he be peer or laird, shepherd or blacksmith. He gives his orders peremptorily, expecting to be obeyed, and is by no means chary of gentle and genial satire."
1890-07-20T00:00:00Z,"OCEAN GROVE, July 19. -- The Grove is now buy and will be until the close of the season with its annual round of religious assemblies, conventions, and camp meetings.

1890-07-20T00:00:00Z,"ISLAM IN INDIA. -- During the whole period of Mohammedan power, vast portions of India remained in the possession of independent Hindu rulers, against whom the force of Islam broke in vain.

1890-07-20T00:00:00Z,That all the lovers of good music in the cities of New-York and Brooklyn do not go far away during the Summer is abundantly demonstrated by the growing success of the concerts given in the music pavilion at Brighton Beach by Anton Seidl and his excellent orchestra. Good-sized audiences are the rule and there is plenty of enthusiasm.

This explains in a great measure the view taken of women in Italy and the position they allow themselves to occupy."
1890-07-20T00:00:00Z,"A year ago I tried to entertain the readers of your influential journal with some descriptions of the far West. As I am once more making my annual trip to the Pacific coast, I take great pleasure in relating matters of interest in the West. feeling vain enough to believe that my recitals will be read with interest."

1890-07-20T00:00:00Z,"IF ARTIFICIAL DIAMONDS WHERE TO BE MADE. -- The question is a curious one, for it involves a good deal of human nature. Is the value of a precious stone wholly dependent upon its rarity and the consequent proof it affords that its owner is possessed of wealth, or, at all events, of wealth which he can afford to waste?"
1890-07-20T00:00:00Z,"WHERE MAY THE SUN GET ITS HEAT? -- I pointed out that when a shooting star dashes into our atmosphere its course is attended with an evolution of light and heat owing to its friction through the air. We were thus able to account for the enormous quantity of heat, or of what was equivalent to heat, which existed in virtue of the rapid motion of these little bodies."
1890-07-20T00:00:00Z,"HAMBURG, Penn., July 19. -- A great deal of speculation was caused this week by the disappearance of Matthias Berger, an old hermit, who has for thirty years lived alone up on the Blue Mountain, five miles north from here, just on the border line of Berks and Schuylkill Counties. The recluse was seventy-seven years old, and lived on the plainest food in a little log cabin in the woods among the rocks."
1890-07-20T00:00:00Z,"It is a matter for congratulation that the case of J.H. HOLLANDER has been taken up in earnest by the Senate, which is the body within whose jurisdiction it properly falls. By the Constitution the Senate is charged with a very large share of the power and responsibility of the United States Government with reference to foreign affairs."
1890-07-20T00:00:00Z,"LOUISVILLE, Ky., July 19. -- A deadly battle, another outbreak of the Smith-Slusher or the Smith-Messer feud, occurred Thursday evening in Knox County, Ky., at Hubbard's Mill.

1890-07-20T00:00:00Z,"SEEING THE BISHOP. -- Beyond their septennial, or, in later years, triennial, confirmations in towns, a Bishop was an unknown quantity in the country villages.

1890-07-20T00:00:00Z,"The residents of the annexed district will enjoy special advantages in the next election. They will have one more office to fight over than citizens of any other district.

1890-07-20T00:00:00Z,"Here is one on Thad Spindle which, though it happened some time ago, has not been told: Thad went home one evening some time ago and found that dinner was not ready.

1890-07-20T00:00:00Z,"Here lie before me two manuscript volumes, containing an account of the adventures of John Gaul in the Fiji Islands. The books are somewhat worn with travel and handling, but they are still in good condition, and still glowing bright with their entries in red ink, blue ink, and a brown ink which was evidently made by mixing the other two."
1890-07-20T00:00:00Z,"LONG BRANCH, July 19. -- The chilly manner in which the representatives of the Nonmouth Electric Railroad Company were received and the suddenness with which their application for a borough franchise was dismissed by the Long Branch Commissioners, sitting in specia session on Wednesday afternoon, are matters of universal comment here."

1890-07-20T00:00:00Z,"THE ARK AND THE DELUGE. -- I may remark that many people think the size of Noah's ark ""monstrous,"" considering the probable state of the art of shipbuilding only 1,600 years after the origin of man, while others are so unreasonable as to inquire why the translation of Enoch is less an extravagance than that of Xisuthros."
1890-07-20T00:00:00Z,"The wolverine, symbol of the State of Michigan, is probably the worst misrepresented and the least understood animal in all the fauna of America, or perhaps of the world. Away back in the centuries travelers began lying about him, and even in our own time writers of text books on natural history have done their share to perpetuate the errors as to his character and habits."
1890-07-20T00:00:00Z,"The following is an extract from George Washington's farewell address. I think were he living to-day and a United States Senator, no more forcible argument could he make against the Lodge Federal Election bill than is contained in the language of his farewell address to the people of the United States. Here is the extract:"
1890-07-20T00:00:00Z,"THE AMERICAN SPIRIT. -- Every American has at his command vast and undeveloped material resources. He is conscious, in himself and in his countrymen, of ambition and enthusiasm, of the ability to surmount difficulties, and of yet unused intellectual strength. His golden age lies in the future, not in the past."

1890-07-20T00:00:00Z,"The crowds at the Polo Grounds are steadily increasing. Yesterday over two thousand people saw the New-York-Cleveland games. The bleacheries have been conspicuous all the season on account of their barrenness, but yesterday many persons occupied them. The crowd was very enthusiastic, it being a reminder of the old time assemblages. All the players were heartily cheered as they came to the bat."

1890-07-20T00:00:00Z,"Belgium begins to-day her prolonged festival on honor of the twenty-fifth anniversary of King LEOPOLD'S ascension to the throne and the sixtieth of her independence.

1890-07-20T00:00:00Z,"It is to be hoped that there is truth in the rumor that attributes to certain of our ingenious and adventurous youth of the gilded variety the purpose of reviving the ancient pastime of hawking.

1890-07-20T00:00:00Z,"MUTUAL CIVILITIES. -- Every Government is willing to cultivate good relations with the greater newspapers. The reputation of no public man is quite beyond the range of their influence, and public men are naturally more solicitous of standing well in popular estimation than they were when place, power, and privilege were almost entirely in the hands of the Crown and a few great families."
1890-07-20T00:00:00Z,"THE MYSTERY OF TENNIS. -- No one can hope to master the intricacies of tennis, still less to catch the enthusiasm, merely by reading about it; but everybody who happens to read such statistics as the analysis of ""straight forces"" must be impressed by the keenness of the interest which has induced a looker-on to subject himself to the prolonged and sustained strain of accurately observing every ball struck in a long series of matches."
1890-07-20T00:00:00Z,"Those Republican citizens of Pennsylvania who value the future of the party will do well to give some study to the recorded vote of the State in 1881, 1882, 1883, and 1884. The figures of those years are full of valuable instruction for present exigencies."

1890-07-20T00:00:00Z,"The opening of the coming season at the Metropolitan Opera House will create widespread interest among that growing class which looks upon music as one of the artistic factors of intellectual life, and not as a thoughtless pastime.

This selection will tend to give to Chickamauga among the Western battles a pre-eminence like that of Gettysburg among the Eastern."
1890-07-21T00:00:00Z,"WILMINGTON, Del., July 20. -- The vote of Delaware in the House of Representatives was cast against the infamous measure through which a desperate faction of the Republican party hopes to retain power by using the armed forces of the Government to restrain the free suffrages of the people, and another representative of this State is ready to resist it with both voice and vote when it is brought up in the Senate."
1890-07-21T00:00:00Z,"The peace of Europe is threatened again. This time it is the personal weakness of a mighty monarch which portends evil. Many sovereigns have betrayed a lack of mental balance in regard to musical accomplishments. It will be remembered that NERO fiddled while Rome burned, and it will be generally conceded that a violin is not the proper instrument with which to play upon a fire."
1890-07-21T00:00:00Z,"The Brooklyn Association team lost at Louisville again yesterday by 1 run. In the ninth inning the score stood 6 to 4 in the visitors' favor, when Taylor's single, Weaver's sacrifice, Wolfe's base on balls, Shinnick's double, and Hamburg's safe hit netted 3 runs and won the game for Louisville.

1890-07-21T00:00:00Z,"CAMP ABBETT, SEA GIRT, July 20. -- The soldiers had a somewhat severe experience in camp life last night for a stiff ocean breeze whistled through the tents half freezing the occupants, most of whom put on storm overcoats in place of night robes when they tumbled into the narrow cots. At 3 o'clock this morning the thermometer at headquarters registered 60 and at daybreak it was only a trifle higher."

A great many are being split and salted and packed in casks and shipped to Germany.
1890-07-21T00:00:00Z,"Among adventurers in the last century who achieved renown for a brief time only to be completely forgotten after death, Theodore of Neuhoff, an impecunious German Baron who sat upon the throne of Corsica for five months or thereabout, should have an eminent place. He has been properly chosen as the first subject for a volume in a series devoted to People Who Have Made a Noise in the World."
1890-07-21T00:00:00Z,"The Republican press as an educator of Congress cannot be said to be a very effective agency. Like many another band of teachers, its members are not agreed among themselves, and the confidence of each in the soundness and authority of his own instruction is aggravated rather than lessened by the differences with his associates."

1890-07-21T00:00:00Z,"It is not generally known that part of Hugh McQuaid's mission to the Flathead country was a search for the Lost Cabin Mine.

1890-07-21T00:00:00Z,"The people of this city should be under no illusions regarding their future water supply on account of the completion of the new aqueduct. The question in its outlines is a very simple one, and yet there are many indications that it is not clearly understood. There are three factors of about equal importance in the problem of supplying the city with water."

1890-07-21T00:00:00Z,"Mr. BLAINE'S mischief-making utterances on the McKinley bill are already bearing fruit. The Albany Evening Journal, which is about as blindly loyal a party paper as can be found outside the Tribune Building, has expressed itself emphatically in favor of dropping the sugar schedule from the bill entirely, and this view is taken by other party papers."

1890-07-21T00:00:00Z,"Certainly it is a little unreasonable to expect the average man to keep trace of all his family relations. There are genealogical cranks who do this, who keep a complete record of all blood and marriage ties, who have family trees with branches running off into the remotest connections so that they can tell in a moment all about their brothers-in-law both first and second hand, and all that."

1890-07-23T00:00:00Z,"The reconstructed Western Union Building will not have many of the structural peculiarities that made the old edifice a landmark in Broadway.

His method is very simple."
1890-07-23T00:00:00Z,"These are not the days of bread-and-butter misses. Time was when men, deceivers ever, could flit from one fair flower to another, tasting rosebud lips here and there and making final choice at their own sweet wills to take or leave their owners. The comic papers gave hints of reckonings with the family dog, or papa's boot, or big brothers, but all this was in a light and jovial strain."

Texas Cattle, which have been strong for the last fortnight or more, were 10@15c lower, and these figures also represent the decline in common to good natives."

1890-07-24T00:00:00Z,"The foolish proposition of a Southern newspaper to declare a boycott upon trade with the North if the Force bill should be passed is receiving very little favor from the press of that section generally. The Force bill is not a Northern measure, and it has not the support of Northern sentiment, especially in the trade centres which would be chiefly affected if such commercial scheme could be adopted."

It is that of a little family of five, who have been brought through sickness and misfortune to suffer actual hunger, and to be thankful for the shelter that two bare rooms in a damp and dingy tenement afford them."
1890-07-25T00:00:00Z,"WASHINGTON, July 24. -- Both Democratic and Republican Senators are disposed to use caution in talking about the Behring Sea correspondence.

1890-07-25T00:00:00Z,"Nothing is more curious in the history of legislation under a representative government than the peculiar notions of equity that now and then obtain and the blind way in which they influence action without the slightest regard to facts.

1890-07-28T00:00:00Z,"The outcome of the British Signaling Committee's recommendations is the fitting of three-arm semaphores to all large vessels of the navy. The signal mast is to be of hollow steel and the same height as the fighting mast, but it will not have a fighting top, and the arrangements for working the arms of the semaphores, which are to be five inches in length, will be contained in this steel tube."
1890-07-28T00:00:00Z,"A new and pleasing profession for the imaginative, or for men ""having knowledge of adventures,"" is suggested by an advertisement in the London Athenaeum. ""Experienced writers of fiction, (ladies especially,) may be supplied with new materials of an exciting and romantic character."" Here is an opening, says a writer in the Daily News, for ""persons who have seen the world, or who, while they possess unbounded fancy, are too indolent or too unskilled to write."

1890-07-28T00:00:00Z,"LAWRENCE, Mass., July 27. -- The scene of yesterday's cyclone was to-day surrounded from early morn till night by thousands of teams, and a conservative estimate of the people present places the number at 40,000.

1890-07-28T00:00:00Z,"There will be only a limited supply of fruit in the market this week, although almost any of the domestic fruits now in season may be obtained. There will be a small quantity of peaches. Those from California will be the most attractive and sell for the largest prices. The common grades of California peaches will sell for upward of $2.50 per box, but a box will not contain a peck of fruit."

1890-07-28T00:00:00Z,"TOPEKA, Kan., July 27. -- The evidence is clear and decided that the waterless districts of Western Colorado, all of New-Mexico, and part of Arizona were once thickly populated. Ruins of cities, remains of great sequoias, indicate that industry, frugality, and perseverance had once brought wealth to a people who made homes in what are now known as arid regions. The snow-covered mountains supplied water throughout the entire year, making vegetation of all kinds certain."
1890-07-28T00:00:00Z,"Another ""Blaine trick"" of a rather diverting character has been discovered at Washington. On the 10th inst. the Secretary of State sent a letter to the President calling his attention to the fact that the Pan-American Conference had adopted a report in favor of an international monetary union, with a suggestion that an international coin, be issued."
1890-07-28T00:00:00Z,"The orders for the transfer of the Sixth Infantry, Gen. MCCOOK'S old regiment, now commanded by Col. COCHRAN, from the Division of the Missouri to the Division of the Atlantic were promptly and naturally accepted as an indication that the long-rumored change in division and department commands was at hand."
1890-07-28T00:00:00Z,"Charles Coombs Tennant, a brother of Mrs. Henry M. Stanley, arrived yesterday from Liverpool on the steamship Umbria of the Cunard Line. Mr. Tennant is a tall, dark, fine-looking gentleman who bears little resemblance to the picture of his sister."

1890-07-29T00:00:00Z,"Yesterday's stock market was characterized, as has been the almost universal rule lately, by a dullness that overspread and dominated everything. Important operators remain away; it will require some event of great consequence to stir anything like new life into Wall Street conditions any time soon."

They were at a loss as to their powers in the case, however, and so nothing was done toward removing him until Dr. Hamilton, Surgeon General of the Marine Hospital, was consulted."
1890-07-29T00:00:00Z,"CHICAGO, Ill., July 28. -- The rise in the price of oats from Saturday until Monday resulted in the failure yesterday of Ernest Hess, one of the best-known dealers on the Board of Trade. His liabilities are shrouded in mystery. Mr. Hess kept himself secluded from public view after the announcement of his failure. Brokers hunted for him, but he could not be found."
1890-07-29T00:00:00Z,"BALTIMORE, July 28. -- The city is greatly excited to-night by the report of a collision in the Patapsco River, several miles below the city.

1890-07-29T00:00:00Z,"The shooting of John D. Fiske at Fresno, Cal., reported in yesterday's newspapers, recalled to the people of White Plains their experience with him in the Winter of 1884-5. Fiske went to White Plains as a lawyer, and pretended to belong to one of the first families of Philadelphia. He met Miss Minnie Newman, who was one of the belles of the village, and her mother, and courted both."
1890-07-29T00:00:00Z,"Commissioner MORGAN'S policy was hardly sustained in one particular by the action of Congress upon the Indian Appropriation bill. He, according to a statement made in the Senate, had declined to enter into contracts with two or three newly-established mission schools for the education of Indian pupils on the ground that, while he was entirely ready to continue the old arrangements with the denominational schools previously founded, he did not wish to extend the system."
1890-07-29T00:00:00Z,"A year ago the Virginia and Gold Hill Water Company's employes repaired a disjointed pipe in front of Dr. Cole's drug store and put in a ""sleeve"" to permit of its expansion. Three days ago they were called upon to lengthen their ""sleeve,"" and readily calculated that the ""sleeve"" had moved ten inches in one year. In some parts of the town the ground jams or compresses, and in other parts it expands and stretches."

Andrews is mourning the disappearance of diamonds valued at $1,000, which he lost in a mysterious manner at Cape May yesterday afternoon.

1890-07-29T00:00:00Z,"When the Republican managers in Congress sent the World's Fair to Chicago, largely because they thought it would be in the hands of their own partisans and would yield them political capital, we wished them joy of their trick, and predicted that the fair would be a lesson in the advantages of freer trade and in the ills of protection that would go far toward breaking down the tariff party."
1890-07-29T00:00:00Z,There is no doubt that the day that the farmers as a class break loose from the Republican Party on the tariff issue the fate of the protective tariff and of the Republican Party will be sealed. It is by the votes of the farmers that the former has been maintained in force and the latter in power for nearly a score of years.
1890-07-29T00:00:00Z,"Dr. J.W. Schelpert of 105 West Ninety-eighth Street could not give any satisfactory reason yesterday for having withheld the certificate of death in the case of Mrs. Marie Aimee Ball, who died while he was her attending physician at 100 West Ninety-eighth Street. Coroner Hanly ordered a certificate to be given."
1890-07-29T00:00:00Z,"The ""sick man"" of the last half century appears to be in a worse plight than ever. It is manifest that the power of the Sultan is only maintained by the jealousies of the nominally Christian powers of Europe. Turkey would be put in liquidation, and the business of the Sultan wound up, if only the creditors could agree upon the appointment of a receiver."
1890-07-29T00:00:00Z,"SARATOGA, July 28. -- The rains of last week had left the track here in soggy and heavy condition for the races here to-day. There was a good crowd at the track, however, about equally divided as to the sexes, and the betting was lively throughout the day. As four of the favorites won the speculators fared well, though few but the plungers could afford to play Bradford at the short odds against him."
1890-07-29T00:00:00Z,"Mr. Rogers, who trains Sam Brown's stable of race horses, wants another investigation. He had one last year which did so much to relieve his wounded feelings that he wants another one to do some more relieving. Of course he wants the Monmouth Park Association's Executive Committee to do the investigating, because that would be under turf law."

1890-07-29T00:00:00Z,"The Creedmoor meeting this year will derive a greatly-increased interest from the presence of a full Canadian team, under the charge of Capt. HOOD. An international competition has always proved a popular attraction at the Fall prize meeting of the National Rifle Association, but, unfortunately, such a competition has not been secured for it during many years."
1890-07-29T00:00:00Z,"While the Democratic leaders of Brooklyn have been sedulously initiating the voters of that political faith into the details of the new ballot-reform law, the Republicans have been apathetic. Republican voters who wished to familiarize themselves with the new law might do so if they chose, but they have had no aids from the much-vaunted Republican Ballot-Reform Committee."
1890-07-29T00:00:00Z,"Though there are three fixed events on the programme of races to be run at Monmouth Park this afternoon, none will furnish remarkable drawing powers -- on paper, at least. The Navesink Handicap, at a mile and a half, would seem to be the most attractive of these, made so by the fact that Firenzi is to run in it and give fourteen pounds, besides her sex allowance, to Eurus."
1890-07-29T00:00:00Z,"PHILADELPHIA, Penn., July 28. -- The new cruiser Philadelphia was put in commission at noon to-day. The transfer was of the most informal character, the Messrs. Cramp, the building, merely giving official control to the officer assigned by the Secretary of the Navy to command the vessel. There were a number of well-known people on the deck of the Philadelphia, and after the transfer there was a general inspection of the new cruiser."
1890-07-29T00:00:00Z,"COLUMBUS, Ohio, July 28. -- Col. James E. Neal, Chairman of the Democratic State Executive Committee, is regarded as a very close political observer, and not at all disposed to talk extravagantly or for effect in giving expression to his views. As Chairman of the committee last Fall he made no claims further than to express the opinion that the Democrats would carry the State and elect the Legislature by a good working majority."
1890-07-29T00:00:00Z,"CITY OF MEXICO, July 28, via Galveston. -- There is the greatest enthusiasm among the Salvadorians. Gen. Rivas, with 6,000 Indians from Cojutepeque, has reinforced Ezeta's army."
1890-07-29T00:00:00Z,"Why in the world do people blow out the gas? Victims of this insane proceeding are reported every few days. They are of all sorts, from the innocent who has ever before seen a gaslight to the massive intellect of a newspaper editor. Indeed, they are so numerous and so varied in character and locality that we can hardly account for them by the theory of sporadic ignorance."
1890-07-29T00:00:00Z,"The Kinderhook and Hudson Railway was opened for traffic yesterday morning. The road is standard gauge, seventeen miles long, extending from Hudson, N.Y., northerly, through Stottville, Stockport, Stuyvesant, and Kinderhook.

Miller. Miller led the Sac County delegation, which, after there had been a large number of ballots, agreed that whenever its vote would nominate anybody, Struble should be dropped and the vote should be given to the other man."
1890-07-29T00:00:00Z,"The Brooklyn Association team is now playing first-class ball, and had the men played at the first of the season the way they are now the team would be near the top. Yesterday at the Polo Grounds the Columbus Club never had a chance of winning. The visitors were outbatted and oufielded. McCullough pitched a grand game for Brooklyn, holding the visitors down to two hits for eight innings."
1890-07-29T00:00:00Z,"The gentleman who writes the history of the weather of 1890 will be forced to put down the twenty-four hours from noon of July 27 as a day of false pretenses. On the records the day will stand as fairly cool for the Summer season, but in the memory of the populace of New-York it will endure as a mighty mean specimen of a meteorological misfit."
1890-07-29T00:00:00Z,"MONTREAL, July 28. -- The work of unloading the wrecked steamer Idaho, on Anticosti, is proceeding as rapidly as possible. The crews of several schooners, numbering twenty-five men in all, are at work on the wreck. Tugs which were sent out from Quebec refused to go alongside the wreck, so dangerous looked the shoal upon which the Idaho had been cast."

1890-07-30T00:00:00Z,"WASHINGTON, July 29. -- There will be plenty of time for Mr. Reed, Mr. McKinley, and Mr. Cannon to perfect their plan to ""crush"" Mr. Blaine before the end of this Congress, for there seems to be some doubt to-day as to whether the Congress will take any recess."
1890-07-30T00:00:00Z,"NEW-LONDON, Conn., July 29. -- Yachts from New-York and Boston have been slipping into this harbor since early yesterday morning and there is now quite a fleet at anchor here, flying the white star, red cross, and blue background comprising the New-York Yacht Club's pennant."
1890-07-30T00:00:00Z,"WILSON'S COVE, Conn., July 29. -- The weather at 6 o'clock this morning was stormy and decidedly disagreeable. The rain came down in torrents and made the yachtsmen on board the twenty-six yachts of the New-York Yacht Racing Association feel very uncomfortable. It was predicted that the yachts would experience rough weather in the Sound in the run from Cold Spring Harbor to this port, but it was not so bad as anticipated."
1890-07-30T00:00:00Z,"At the meeting of the Directors of the St. Louis and San Francisco Road yesterday it was decided to pass the dividend due on the first preferred stock. The announcement that the dividend would not be paid created a good deal of surprise. It is the first time that it has happened to the first preferred stock, though the preferred has been visited by the misfortune more than once."
1890-07-30T00:00:00Z,"LONDON, July 29. -- The following cable dispatch dated Buenos Ayres, July 28, 2:20 P.M., has been received at the Legation of the Argentine Republic in this city:"
1890-07-30T00:00:00Z,"ATLANTA, Ga., July 29. -- The Supreme Court of Georgia to-day decided an important question regarding the property rights of married women. The defendant claimed that she was a married woman without separate property of her own. She could not legally make a contract on her own account to purchase property, and hence the plaintiffs could not enforce the contract against her."
1890-07-30T00:00:00Z,"The amendment to the Tariff bill offered yesterday by Senator MCPHERSON to reduce the duty imposed by the bill of 5 cents per pound on boracic acid to 3 1/2 cents (the present duty being 4 cents) was rejected by a strict party vote, but not until it had called out a debate in which the Republican Senators were forced to take part."
1890-07-30T00:00:00Z,"For the twentieth time Shoen Loewenthal's German-American Institute and Kindergarten will visit the Empire City Colosseum at the foot of East Sixty-ninth Street and participate in a picnic and Summer night's festival Wednesday next.

1890-07-30T00:00:00Z,"In having lost the World's Fair, those New-Yorkers who were anxious to get it have at least the consolation described by LUCRETIUS of surveying from the safety of the shore the struggles and perils of those who are embarked upon the sea. That there would be struggles was manifest, and that these struggles would arise and wax hot over the question of a site."
1890-07-30T00:00:00Z,"CITY OF MEXICO, July 29, via Galveston. -- Senor Dicluez, the Guatemalan Minister here, has decided to give no information to the press.

Tygert Co., manufacturers of fertilizers, with headquarters at 2 Chestnut Street, this city. An approximate estimate places the assets of the firm at $348,000, and liabilities at $317,000. The suspension was caused, it is said by the refusal of creditors to renew notes of the Peninsula Bone Fertilizing Company of Smyrna, Del., upon which J.E. Tygert were heavy indorsers."
1890-07-30T00:00:00Z,"A committee from the German Central Democratic Association of Brooklyn had a conference last night with Justice Kenna, Chairman of the Kings County Democratic Campaign Committee, in Arion Hall, Broadway and Wall Street, Williamsburg.

1890-07-30T00:00:00Z,"It will probably be a month before the tearing up of Broadway for the new cable conduit will be commenced, but when once started the work will be pushed as rapidly as possible.

Taylor, and which is the emblem of the championship of Long Island, was greatly admired by all who saw it."
1890-07-30T00:00:00Z,"SARATOGA, July 29. -- The fact that Kingston and Los Angeles were to meet in the Excelsior Stakes to-day, coupled with the good general programme, drew a large crowd to the race course. The track was in fairly good condition, though it was by no means fast. The sport was exciting, though the fields were small in each race."
1890-07-30T00:00:00Z,"WASHINGTON, July 29. -- President Harrison to-day sent the following message to Congress:"
1890-07-30T00:00:00Z,"WASHINGTON, July 29. -- The Republican policy of silence while the Tariff bill is pending was entirely lost sight of in the Senate to-day. The Republican Senators have chafed a good deal lately under the sting of the Democratic assaults upon the bill and its sponsors. They caught an unusually severe scoring to-day at the hands of Mr. Gorman, and both Mr. Aldrich and Mr. Hiscock were unable to keep silent."
1890-07-30T00:00:00Z,"WASHINGTON, July 29. -- Representative Andrew of Massachusetts, who believes that the extravagance of the Republicans is to be discussed with a good deal of interest and with some effect upon the elections in the coming Fall, has been collecting the available figures and contributes an estimate that is as interesting as any that has been presented of the prospect that confronts the taxpayers in the middle of President Harrison's Administration."
1890-07-30T00:00:00Z,"The Republican members of the Ways and Means Committee in their Tariff bill raised the duties on window glass, which are already very high, the average being 113 1/2 per cent.

1890-07-30T00:00:00Z,"The question what effect the war between Guatemala and Salvador will ultimately have upon the project of Central American union is an interesting one to onlooking nations as well as to the five republics immediately concerned.

1890-07-30T00:00:00Z,"It appears that the Sultan has put under martial law the quarter of Constantinople in which is situated the Armenian cathedral. This is the edifice in which the congregation last Sunday mobbed the Patriarch. As we have already remarked, the riot was as disgraceful to the Sultan, in his character of civil officer, as if he were not, as a Mussulman, scornfully disregardful of the mutual contusions inflicted by rowdy Giaours."
1890-07-30T00:00:00Z,"A dastardly attempt was made yesterday afternoon to fire the tenement house at 114 Willett Street, probably for the sake of a few hundred dollars of insurance.

Matthew S. Quay. It is interesting, though, to read what Mr. Emery's charges were which have been so effectually disposed by the silent method."
1890-07-30T00:00:00Z,"BALTIMORE, Md., July 29. -- At 4:30 o'clock this morning Mrs. Charles R. York and her mother, Mrs. McClellan, living at Bengies, a station on the Pennsylvania, Wilmington and Baltimore Railroad, twelve miles from Baltimore, were murderously assaulted. They were asleep at the time. Horrible wounds were made upon the left forehead of each woman."
1890-07-30T00:00:00Z,"We printed the other day a long list of replies made by the Attorney General to questions about the meaning and application of various provisions of the new ballot law. It is well for officers who have duties to perform in the execution of the law to be left in no doubt about its requirements, but most of these questions are such as the law answers plainly enough for itself."
1890-07-30T00:00:00Z,"PEEKSKILL, July 29. -- The First Class of the West Point cadets trooped into camp at 10:30 this morning. There were fifty-five of the boys under command of their instructor in tactics, First Lieut. Edward E. Hardin, Seventh Infantry.

The distance -- 5,030 sea miles -- was covered in a little short of twenty-five days, including a stop of fifty-six hours at Port Castries, island of Santa Lucia."
1890-07-31T00:00:00Z,When Mr. HISCOCK broke the silence previously maintained by the Republican Senators with his bragging speech of Tuesday it was plain that the party leaders felt the need of some reply to the rattling fire so long poured into their ranks by the Democrats. Yesterday this change in policy was followed further by a careful speech from Senator MORRILL of Maine.
1890-07-31T00:00:00Z,"NORWALK, Conn., July 30. -- With every stitch of canvas filled by a stiff southwesterly breeze, the Cedar Point Yacht Club sailed its second regatta of the season to-day. Elaborate preparations had been made for the event by reason of the fact that the New-York Yacht Racing Association, which stopped here on its annual Eastern cruise, had accepted an invitation to participate."
1890-07-31T00:00:00Z,"NEW-LONDON, Conn., July 30. -- The New-York Yacht Club had a lovely day for a rendezvous, and the preliminary festivities of the annual squadron cruise opened opposite the Pequot House under the most favorable circumstances.

1890-07-31T00:00:00Z,"WASHINGTON, July 30. -- Lawyers sometimes need to be reminded that Congress is always at work making changes in the law, and that the statutes at large need to be read by those who expect to walk in the procession."
1890-07-31T00:00:00Z,"There seems to be an issue of veracity between Commissioner GILROY and the President of the Steam Company upon some points in the controversy between them about the injury done in the streets of this city. There is no question that a great deal of injury has been done, and the thermometer is a tolerably veracious witness as to the cause of it in most cases."
1890-07-31T00:00:00Z,"NEW-HAVEN, Conn., July 30. -- Comparatively little interest has been taken in yachting by the local club this season, but there will be a grand awakening this week. The annual cruise of the New-Haven Yacht Club will begin Saturday."

Dickinson, one of the present Administration's appointees. Last year there was a brief skirmish in this quarter owing, it is said, to the extreme view of discipline taken by Mr. Dickinson, and its marked contrast with the more agreeable methods of his predecessor."

1890-07-31T00:00:00Z,"WASHINGTON, July 30. -- The Republican Senators have thrown to the winds their scheme to avoid discussion of the Tariff bill. They have given a fair trial to the policy of leaving all talking to the Democrats, and they regard it as a total failure."
1890-07-31T00:00:00Z,"DETROIT, Mich., July 30. -- When the Patrons of Industry made their State organization in Michigan last Spring and adopted their declaration of principles, it was supposed that the question of separate political action was settled. The policy generally agreed upon then was that of not making separate nominations, but of supporting the candidates on the old party tickets who were most favorable to their views."
1890-07-31T00:00:00Z,"WASHINGTON, July 30. -- On Aug. 1 the Secretary of the Treasury will issue a new form of statement of the public debt.

This statement, too is to be issued in a new form."
1890-07-31T00:00:00Z,"The People's Municipal League is a good enough name for the organization that has set out to work a reform in the City Government.

There is to be an extensive enrollment of those who are prepared to support the municipal reform movement, and it is intended to carry the organization into every election district."
1890-07-31T00:00:00Z,"The Brooklyn Association team lost to the Columbus club at the Polo Grounds yesterday on account of Murphy's unsteadiness. He was batted hard in almost every inning, and it was unfortunate that every batsman to whom he gave a base on balls scored. Gastright, who was batted out of the box in Sunday's game, was unusually effective, such heavy hitters as Davis and O'Brien not being able to get a safe hit."
1890-07-31T00:00:00Z,"SARATOGA, July 30. -- The track here was dry and fast, and there was a good crowd out to see the sport in spite of the fact that this was an extra day, with no stake events to draw out specially large attendance. The races were run with these results:"
1890-07-31T00:00:00Z,"It is difficult not to entertain a sneaking kindness for ex-Alderman MICHAEL DUFFY, immoral though it be to entertain such a sentiment for such a man. As a comic informer DUFFY has already done much to promote the public hilarity. He promises to promote it still more in the character of a comic plaintiff."
1890-07-31T00:00:00Z,"PITTSBURG, Penn., July 30. -- Ex-Gov. Robert E. Pattison, the Democratic candidate for Governor, had an enthusiatic reception here to-day.

1890-07-31T00:00:00Z,"Seven races are to be run over the tracks of the great Monmouth Park race course to-day. Consequently people can have all the sport they desire. The Optional Stakes for two-year-olds and the Newark Stakes for three-year-olds are the two fixtures on the card, and both on paper look to be good races, such as will make exciting finishes and good, sharp betting."
1890-07-31T00:00:00Z,The general election which took place in Japan in the beginning of this month was the first attempt by an Oriental nation to establish representative government. The Japanese Parliament will open on the 1st of November. The Emperor in 1881 promised the people that at the end of eight years he would give them a Constitution.
1890-07-31T00:00:00Z,"The appeal which Grange Master Rhone makes to the farmers of Pennsylvania to rally to the support of Pattison is a strong and logical piece of writing. Delamater, Mr. Rhone says, would not have been nominated but for the ""arbitrary interference of a political dictator,"" combined with ""corrupt and corporate influences."""
1890-07-31T00:00:00Z,"CHARLESTON, S.C., July 30. -- The prospects of the passage of the Lodge bayonet bill and the utterly irreconcilable differences in the Democratic Party have infused great energy into the Republican Party of this State. For the first time since 1878, when all hope of a Republican control of this State was abandoned by the carpet-bag government, the Republican leaders have become hopeful."

It is considered to be a most important matter, and the probabilities are that the proposition will be adopted."
1890-07-31T00:00:00Z,"NYACK, July 30. -- The guests of the Tappan Zee House held the first german of the season here last evening, and a happy and brilliant affair it proved to be. The amount subscribed by the city people for the affair was a very handsome one, and the favors were beautiful and valuable. The decorations in the spacious parlors were unusually elaborate, and arranged with excellent taste."
1890-07-31T00:00:00Z,"The return of our ""evolutionary squadron"" marks the close of a very successful cruise. It is more than thirty years since the United States have been represented in foreign waters by men-of-war really up to the times. When the frigates of the Minnesota class were new, they were not only abreast but ahead of the standards of European navies."
1890-07-31T00:00:00Z,"PEEKSKILL, N.Y., July 30. -- The provost guard has had an active week. The number of disorderly episodes that have occurred have kept the guard and the sentries very busy. Every night the camp has been alarmed. Midnight marauders have jumped the guard with marked success. The left companies -- the provisionals from Oswego and Utica -- have furnished the chief delinquents."
1890-07-31T00:00:00Z,"The New-York National League team had fun at Pittsburg yesterday. The outfielders of the home club had not done so much leather-chasing before this season, and all because every man in the New-York team managed to hit the ball right on the trade-mark. Both teams played a nice fielding game. Of the 14 runs the New-Yorks made 10 were earned, which shows how well their hits were bunched. The score by innings:"
1890-08-01T00:00:00Z,"The Rev. Dr. Burtsell of the Roman Catholic Church of the Epiphany left the city very suddenly last evening, and it is understood that he took the 8:30 train on the Erie Railroad for Patterson, N.J.

The Brooklyn Association team is playing a hard game to beat just now, and Manager Morton's men found it out yesterday to their sorrow. Daily and Smith were the opposing pitchers, the former doing the better work, as he kept the hits scattered. The visitors, were outbatted and out-fielded."
1890-08-01T00:00:00Z,"Judge Beach, in Supreme Court, Chambers, yesterday reserved his decision on the application to have bail fixed for Dr. McGonegal and Mrs. Shaw, held for the murder of Annie Goodwin, and for the discharge of William Davis, held in $1,500 bail as an accessory after the fact.

1890-08-01T00:00:00Z,"Financial circles were not a little agitated yesterday by the disclosures of the condition of affairs in the Third National Bank. Confirmation of every statement made in THE TIMES of yesterday was easily found, notwithstanding the foolish vaporings of the cashier of the bank. Indeed, there are good reasons for belief that behind the strenuous efforts of interested persons to conceal them there is an actual condition of affairs much worse than has been indicated."
1890-08-01T00:00:00Z,"A great diversity of opinion as to Mr. BLAINE'S projects for reciprocity is to be noticed in the editorial columns of the high-tariff press. This diversity has frequently been exhibited in succeeding numbers of the same journal. Some of our contemporaries warmly commended all of Mr. BLAINE'S propositions when they first appeared, and have since been led by hidden influences to see the error of their ways."

1890-08-01T00:00:00Z,"WASHINGTON, July 31. -- Ten o'clock in the morning is a rather early hour for United States Senators to settle down for a day's work. The Senate met at that hour to-day under the rule agreed upon at the last Republican caucus in order to ""expedite"" the Tariff bill, and nobody was surprised to find only a dozen or fifteen Senators on hand to listen to the Chaplain's prayer."
1890-08-01T00:00:00Z,"It is one of the most interesting facts in the pending discussion of the tariff question that the spirit of dependence, in which the idea of protection has been generally spread, is seen to be constantly diminishing. We do not, of course, mean that the national spirit, at the time when protection was first adopted, or when it received its most remarkable development, was dependent. Far from it."
1890-08-01T00:00:00Z,"CLEVELAND, July 31. -- There was the largest crowd that ever came to the Driving Park here this afternoon.

She first started to make a fast half, and only got away after several refusals to strike a trot."
1890-08-01T00:00:00Z,"This is that Rosalind and all else fits, and other comment were superfluous. Thus does even a jaded critic, retaking a disused pen, feel inclined to write of the almost ideal performance of perhaps, the most ideal comedy of pastoral life writ by him whom some call Shakespeare. Yet ""must there no more be said?"" There is more to say in a day when mere assertion rules it but too much."
1890-08-01T00:00:00Z,"A Washington dispatch to the Sun represents HENRY CABOTLODGE as thinking that he has secured a pretty formidable weapon to use against Senator HOAR in future State campaigns.

1890-08-01T00:00:00Z,"Secretary WINDOM has devised a new form of monthly debt statement, the superiority of which over the old form is not altogether clear. It does not matter particularly that the Pacific Railroad bonds are omitted from the class of interest-bearing debt, as a separate statement is made of the amount outstanding, and the condition of the interest account and sinking fund."
1890-08-01T00:00:00Z,"BRIDGEHAMPTON, L. I., July 31. -- Mrs. Schurig of New-York, who, with her daughter, has been staying at Hull's Hotel for several weeks, was found drowned on the beach this morning.

1890-08-01T00:00:00Z,"A reference conducted before Charles D. Burrill to determine whether or not Mrs. Caroline Nagel should receive alimony from her husband, Prof. Frederick Nagel, a teacher of languages, has brought out a strange romance. It appears that about 1869 Prof. Nagel advertised for somebody to take care of his infant daughter. Mrs. Adolph Schlitte replied to the advertisement, and the baby was placed in her charge."
1890-08-01T00:00:00Z,"NEWPORT, R.I., July 31. -- The run of the fleet to this port to-day was to have been a race, but the death of Mr. George L.

A number of yachts had pinned distinguishing numbers on their mainsails before they were hoisted, and they left them there, although no official time was taken."
1890-08-01T00:00:00Z,"SOUTHAMPTON, L.I., July 31. -- The courts of the Meadow Club were again surrounded by many spectators here to-day, when the tournament was most auspiciously continued.

He is pronounced and straightforward in his opposition."
1890-08-01T00:00:00Z,The practical discontinuance of no fewer than fifty companies of infantry and twenty troops of cavalry by a single order of the War Department is certainly the most remarkable administrative measure which our army has known for a long time. The first thought to suggest itself may be as to how this action harmonizes with the laws prescribing what the organization of the army shall be.

1890-08-02T00:00:00Z,"Friends in the country who jump for the weather reports every day to see what they have left behind will be apt to be deceived by yesterday's record. The figures would make it appear that it was a pleasant Summer resort kind of day, with the temperature gently playing in the eighties and a nine-knot breeze bringing ozone from Sandy Hook to keep the town well toned up."
1890-08-02T00:00:00Z,"PEEKSKILL, Aug. 1. -- More ammunition has been expended at the State Camp this week than at any similar time since its existence. Col.

1890-08-02T00:00:00Z,"The summary of the public debt statement for the month of July is hardly less puzzling than the old form, and it is not in strict accordance with the new form as previously described. By omitting the Pacific Railroad bonds the interest-bearing debt is made to appear as $700,799,360, while the debt bearing no interest is considerably larger in amount."
1890-08-02T00:00:00Z,"BOSTON, Aug. 1. -- To-night's mass meeting in Faneuil Hall in favor of the passage of the Federal Elections bill will hardly weigh much with the country or with Congress.

That such is its real purpose we have never for a moment believed, but, if it were, the extraordinary provisions of the bill are so calculated to beget abuses of power that it would be without justification."

1890-08-02T00:00:00Z,"The Michigan Prohibitionists have made a mistake very common among political visionaries. The business of a third party with a moral issue is simply to stand up and be counted, so as to bring one of the regular parties to espouse their cause in the hope of getting their votes. When so many thousands of votes are cast for prohibition the politicians know what it means."

1890-08-02T00:00:00Z,"No matter how high up the mercury in New-York's thermometers runs, it never gets too hot for the politicians to discuss things. After having digested the sensation caused by John Reilly's open revolt against Mayor Grant Thursday, they began yesterday to wonder whether Tammany would make an effort to shut out the County Democracy inspectors of elections, poll clerks, and ballot clerks this Fall."

Davison, Sr., who died July 22 on board the Majestic in Liverpool harbor, was done yesterday at the funeral services over his body, held at the Phillips Presbyterian Church, at Madison Avenue and Seventy-third Street.

Italy has settled her troubles in Abyssinia, and has a firm ally in the present Negus, who would probably furnish a large contingent for such an enterprise."
1890-08-02T00:00:00Z,"LONDON, Aug. 1 -- This was the last day of the Goodwood meeting.

1890-08-03T00:00:00Z,"THE DISTINCTION'S BETWEEN MAN AND OTHER ANIMALS. -- If in fact the human mind had been developed through animals of the mammalian form it would be a sound inference to suppose that beings with equal mental endowments might be developed through any other form. An ant has no brain and yet is the mental equal of any other animal, man alone excepted."
1890-08-03T00:00:00Z,"BLUFF POINT, N.Y., Aug. 2. -- This high promontory, two miles south of Plattsburg, has always been a favorite spot for those who wished to have a comprehensive view of this beautiful inland lake, with its wide stretch of clear water, ten miles from New-York to Vermont.

1890-08-03T00:00:00Z,"Brooklyn's Census Superintendent, Mr. Sedgwick, did not make such a very bad guess at the population.

1890-08-03T00:00:00Z,"RICHFIELD SPRINGS, N.Y., Aug. 2. -- The church fair period has arrived. It always comes when the season is at its height, but this year it is more conspicuous than usual.

In the bazaars of Calcutta and Bombay the vilest poison is sold to the English sailors in bottles branded and capsuled as Martell's or Hennessy's brandy, Dunville's whisky, and the like.

They say they do not like government by consular board, yet government by Swedish Chief Justice may suit them no better. The foreign representatives have thus far, they think, confined their services largely to collecting customs duties, which must produce the impression that the chief element in government of the foreign type is raising a revenue to live on."

There is probably no Summer resort in American where the attractions are fixed in which the phases of Summer amusement are so variable.

1890-08-10T00:00:00Z,"DETROIT, Aug. 9. -- The official crop report for this month shows some improvement over the gloomy estimates of a month ago. Thrashing of the new harvest has begun, and all the reports thus far received show a much better yield than was predicted. The early estimates were for about fourteen bushels per acre, while the actual yield thus far reported will average nineteen bushels. The quality is fully up to the average."

1890-08-10T00:00:00Z,"The Bay of Corunna was lying blue and placid in the afternoon sun. The polished cannon of the two old forts caught the sunbeams and glistened in peaceful splendor, and the great glass windows in the Tower of Hercules, the tall lighthouse which lights the harbor, caught them, too, and shone as if the lamps were all ablaze."
1890-08-10T00:00:00Z,"THE RIVER POPULATION OF THE THAMES. -- There is always a certain hostility between bargemen, and, indeed, all the riverside population, and deep-water sailors, to whatever cause it may be attributed. Possibly it is due to the fact that sailors despise landsmen, in spite of their sayings which indicate the folly of seafaring, such as ""He is a fool that would sell a farm in order to go to sea."""
1890-08-10T00:00:00Z,"The most casual observer of Brooklyn political events can probably recall at least one flattering tribute to Mayor Chapin in the columns of the Eagle; close observers could point to dozens. The politicians recall with ease articles in which that paper has claimed all the credit of forcing Mr. Chapin on the local Democratic machine, and has quietly congratulated itself upon having given the Mayor his first substantial boost on his way to national prominence."

1890-08-10T00:00:00Z,"RICHMOND, Va., Aug. 9. -- One effect of the passage of the Force bill by the House will probably be to make the Mahone party in this State adopt tactics to evade the responsibility of that action. The indications now are that Mahone will not nominate candidates for Congress except possibly in two districts in the State."
1890-08-10T00:00:00Z,"It is a remarkable fact that the rainfall for July was far lower than that of the same month in many years. The total fall was only three inches, while that of July, 1889, was over nine; but more remarkable still was the almost total absence of thunderstorms. Many persons, even among the most learned, have an idea that excessive heat is sure to produce heavy rainfalls, and yet here we have the opposite result."

The results fill a book which will be published this week by the Messrs. Appleton.

1890-08-10T00:00:00Z,"The Annual Encampment of the Grand Army of the Republic, which is about to be held in Boston, bids fair to be quite as impressive as any of its recent predecessors.

He nipped every spear of standing grain in the western half of the State, and chilled the hearts of thousands of farmers who mortgaged this season's crop to raise money t buy grain for seed and feed, counting upon a bountiful harvest which would liquidate their indebtedness and give them a few dollars to the good."
1890-08-10T00:00:00Z,"The heavy rainfall made the track at Monmouth Park yesterday, very sloppy and bad for racing.

1890-08-11T00:00:00Z,""" I believe I was animated,"" said Mr. HISCOCK in the Senate last Friday, ""by broad statesmanship and the general welfare of the country.""

In nearly every county there has been an actual majority in favor of Tillman at the various mass meetings."

1890-08-12T00:00:00Z,"It must have struck most readers of newspapers as curious that the ""Vanderbilt system"" should have been the object of a strike that does not extend beyond it. The traveling and shipping ""public,"" especially the suburban public, has always had a grievance against the railroads included in that system, but the authorities have commonly managed to prevent ""labor troubles"" even when these were very rife upon other roads."

1890-08-12T00:00:00Z,One effect of the first experiment with execution by electricity is a revival of discussion on the general question of capital punishment. After the cooling off of the first excitement over the execution of KEMMLER it becomes evident that there was nothing in it to justify any talk of going back to the punishment of hanging.

1890-08-14T00:00:00Z,"Now that the strike is over, the men who engaged in it may perhaps be willing to listen to reason. If they are not, there ought to be a moral in it which other workingmen will heed, whether or not they happen to be Knights of Labor.

Just now, with the Senate about to decide to pass the Tariff bill at the end of the month and to go home after the appropriation bills are out of the way without giving the ""Force"" bill a moment's consideration.

1890-08-20T00:00:00Z,"According to the cable report, which is excessively meagre, the utterances of M. RIBOT, the French Minister of Foreign Affairs, on protection are sufficiently Delphic. He is said to have declared that ""he would ask the Chamber of Deputies to remember that France did not labor solely on her own account."
1890-08-20T00:00:00Z,"SARATOGA, Aug. 19. -- ""Lucky"" Baldwin again succeeded in carrying off all the honors at the track here to-day. His reliable mare, Los Angeles, won the Beverwyck Stakes for him, and his two fillies, Cleopatra and Esperanza, helped to fill his overflowing pocketbook by running first and second in the Kentucky Stakes. The races were run with these results:"
1890-08-20T00:00:00Z,"NARRAGANSETT PIER, R.I., Aug. 19. -- Although the weather was hardly what might be desired, the tennis tournament was continued here this morning. The morning's play had ceased and the afternoon's matches were about to be begun when rain put a stop to all further playing. Play was begun at 10:30, and the courts were well surrounded with spectators when the first match was started."
1890-08-21T00:00:00Z,"BUFFALO, Aug. 20. -- Major John M. Farquhar of Buffalo is a candidate for renomination for Congress in the Thirty-second District. The Warren-Platt ring is opposed to him, but this is regarded as a favorable omen by his friends, who think he will be renominated unless some new and strong anti-ring man appears."
1890-08-21T00:00:00Z,"A canvass of the Tammany Committee of Twenty-four shows that a large majority of its members are favorable to the renomination of Mayor GRANT, but it is admitted on all hands that CROKER is still the ""boss"" and that he will really decide who is to be nominated. CROKER is expected to be back about the 10th of September to study the situation."
1890-08-21T00:00:00Z,"Not even the disclosures made before the Senate Committee on Cities as to Mayor Grant's irregularities while Sheriff or his contribution of $10,000 to the Croker family will prevent Tammany from renominating him for Mayor if he is a candidate and if Richard Croker is willing. The willingness or unwillingness of Croker is now merely a matter of speculation."
1890-08-21T00:00:00Z,"NARRAGANSETT PIER, R.I., Aug. 20. -- On damp courts, but before many spectators, the tennis tournament progressed merrily here today. Because of rain no playing was done in the morning, but in the afternoon the single contests were resumed. The doubles were not begun, but the consolation event was commenced and the preliminary part of the first round finished."
1890-08-21T00:00:00Z,"MILWAUKEE, Aug. 20. -- The Republican State Convention, which met here to-day, was a Spooner assemblage which adopted a Hoard platform. Such a combination is likely to make trouble in the campaign, because as a matter of fact, Senator Spooner and Gov. Hoard are widely at variance in their views of what is necessary in order to secure a Republican victory next Fall."
1890-08-21T00:00:00Z,"SEABRIGHT, Aug. 20. -- The public sale of the property of the late Seabury Tredwell, on the Rumson Road just across the bridge, took place to-day. Effingham H.

1890-08-21T00:00:00Z,"DUBLIN, Aug. 8. -- The case of Violet Nevin, which would probably never have been heard of but for the exposure in THE NEW-YORK TIMES, and the legal proceedings now pending before Baron Pollock and Mr. Justice Grantham, in the Queen's Bench Division, London, for the punishment of John C. Conolly, her abductor, are now receiving much attention from the press of this city."
1890-08-21T00:00:00Z,"RALEIGH, N.C., Aug. 20. -- The State Democratic Convention to nominate judicial officers was rather small, only seventy-one counties being represented. Chief Justice Merriman, Justice Clark, and nine Superior Court Judges were nominated by acclamation. The convention was entirely harmonious. Senator Vance was commended for his struggle against the McKinley bill and recommended to the Legislature for re-election."
1890-08-21T00:00:00Z,"The card at Monmouth Park for this afternoon is lighter than usual, the Delaware Handicap, at a mile and a quarter, being the only fixture. For this there are but seven acceptances out of the sixty-four horses eligible, with Prince Royal the top weight. The class of horses is pretty commonplace in all the other races, but that does not necessitate poor races. The entries and weights for the several events are as follows:"
1890-08-21T00:00:00Z,"WATERTOWN, N.Y., Aug. 20. -- The New-York State Firemen's Association is no longer to be controlled by politicians or used to further the interests of candidates for office. A resolution to that effect and to guide all officers hereafter elected was adopted to-day after a committee had investigated and reported on the attempts of George M. Irish to use the association in the interest of Elliot Danforth at the last election."

The chief complaint is that of salaries, the men alleging that they receive much less per month than the employes of any other road."
1890-08-21T00:00:00Z,"The meeting between the Emperor of Germany and the Czar of Russia at St. Petersburg was much less farcical than meetings of the hereditary monarchs of civilized countries are apt to be in our time. It is melancholy, however, that it should not be farcical. The policies of modern States are decided by the interests of their people."
1890-08-21T00:00:00Z,"MILLVILLE, N.J., Aug. 20. -- A severe electrical storm passed over the western section of Cumberland County early this morning, doing considerable damage.

1890-08-21T00:00:00Z,"The reappearance of the Secretary of the Treasury in Wall Street in his now only too familiar character of an angel of deliverance has not, we regret to see, been received by the habitues of the Street with those cordial demonstrations of gratitude that might have been expected. The healing borne upon his wings is regarded as of a feeble and ineffectual character."
1890-08-21T00:00:00Z,"General Master Workman POWDERLY of the Knights of Labor has been engaged for some days in an effort to bring about a general strike of practically all the working force, except the engineers, on the Vanderbilt system of railroads between New-York and Chicago. For two days he has been laboring to that end in a conference with the chief officers of the four organizations which make up the Federation of Railway Employes."
1890-08-21T00:00:00Z,"MARBLEHEAD, Aug. 20. -- The sail-off for the Corinthian Yacht Club cups for forty-foot and thirty-foot yachts to-day was too onesided to be interesting. A light breeze and an old sea suited the Minerva to a dot and she defeated the Ventura handsomely. The keel Saladin found these conditions vary much to her liking and she disposed of the centreboard Shark easily."
1890-08-21T00:00:00Z,"PHILADELPHIA, Aug. 20. -- There is to be another great-tented traveling establishment in the field, embracing a circus, hippodrome, museum, and other features.

Young Brady disappeared four years ago and was not seen again by his family until a short time ago, when he made his appearance just in time to attend his mother's funeral services. He looked like a tramp."
1890-08-21T00:00:00Z,"SARATOGA SPRINGS, N.Y., Aug. 20. -- President Henry Hitchcock delivered an address before the American Bar Association this morning. He spoke of the acts of Congress already passed this year.

1890-08-21T00:00:00Z,"While Mr. BLAINE, not content to follow the lines of negotiation indicated by his predecessor, has succeeded in entangling the Behring Sea problem in the old dispute over marine ownership, there is little doubt that the poachers have improved the opportunity to make great and perhaps unprecedented ravages among the seals."
1890-08-21T00:00:00Z,"BOSTON, Aug. 20. -- The saddest story of the Quincy disaster yesterday is told by Judge I.W. Edwards of Louisville, Ky.

Entries for the events have already closed, and the club is sure of a successful meeting."
1890-08-21T00:00:00Z,"The seizure of the Gloucester schooner Willie Irving at Souris can hardly be ranked among outrages. It is not made clear by the dispatches why she entered the harbor, but presumably it was for shelter and repairs, since having once got in, her Captain and crew, after a prolonged stay, declined to go out again, as the authorities desired them to do, alleging that their craft was not seaworthy."
1890-08-21T00:00:00Z,"POUGHKEEPSIE, Aug. 20. -- This was along day of racing at the Hudson River Driving Park to-day owing chiefly to the close contest in the 2:20 trotting class, which opened the sport and occupied all the afternoon. Seven heats were trotted, but no horse had secured three when darkness intervened, and the race will continue to-morrow with nine of the eleven starters remaining."
1890-08-21T00:00:00Z,"NEW-HAVEN, Aug. 20. -- The sloop yacht Hattie of New-York, with seven men on board, struck on the New-Haven Breakwater about 10:30 o'clock last night, in the heavy storm and fog which then prevailed, and went to pieces in a very few moments. The men had not time to save anything and barely managed, after desperate struggling in the water, to reach the breakwater."
1890-08-22T00:00:00Z,"The advantages to be gained by having the propeller amidships instead of at the stern were tested in the trial trip of a new vessel at Newcastle, England, recently. Although the vessel was quite light, not even ballasted, she behaved admirably. It was manifest that perfect contact with the water under the ship was at all times certain for the propellers, so that there was no racing or unequal strain for the engines."
1890-08-22T00:00:00Z,"WASHINGTON, Aug. 21. -- The special House committee this morning began the investigation of the charges made against Pension Commissioner Raum by placing the Commissioner on the stand.

There was no enthusiasm shown at the evening session."
1890-08-22T00:00:00Z,"For so much of the stringency in the money market of New-York as is due to general causes, the tariff legislation of Congress is, as we have already pointed out, clearly accountable. There will be found in our news columns this morning some facts bearing on this point that will repay attention."
1890-08-22T00:00:00Z,"It seems a little more terrible than it really is to read that money loaned in Wall Street at nearly 200 per cent. yesterday. That means simply that men who had risked very largely on the expectation that they would be able to furnish a good deal of money in a few hours found that they had miscalculated, and paid for relief in proportion to their risks."
1890-08-22T00:00:00Z,"In a circular addressed to the Democratic societies of Pennsylvlania by Chauncey F.

1890-08-22T00:00:00Z,"Al Johnson's Cleveland's (P.L.) team made an attempt at playing baseball at Brotherhood Park yesterday afternoon, but all they could do was to bat weakly and field poorly. Delehanty's exhibition at short field would have made a ten-year-old boy blush with shame were he in the same position. Could the visitors have fielded well the game might have been a close one, as the New-Yorks earned but two of their runs."
1890-08-22T00:00:00Z,"The Hamburg-American steamship Dania, commanded by Capt. Schultz, which left Hamburg for this port Aug. 9, went ashore Wednesday night at 11 o'clock on the bar, about one mile from Point Lookout, between New and Sones Inlets, Long Island. Practically no attempts to get her off were made yesterday, and up to a late hour last night she lay fast in the sand in an exceedingly dangerous position."
1890-08-22T00:00:00Z,"WASHINGTON, Aug. 21. -- A large audience which had gathered in the Senate chamber at 10 o'clock this morning went away very much disgusted before 12 o'clock.

1890-08-22T00:00:00Z,"The New-York (N.L.) team returned yesterday from its trip to Boston and met the Cincinnatis, of whom Arlie Latham -- he or ex-Brotherhood fame -- is Captain. Without the redoubtable Arlie the visitors would surely have lost. Even as it was they were in luck, because an error by Denny and one by Tiernan in one inning gave them 2 runs. The New-Yorks batted well, but in only one inning were the hits well connected."
1890-08-22T00:00:00Z,"RAVENSWOOD, West Va., Aug. 21. -- In the Circuit Court yesterday evening the jury in the murder case of Mary Jane Morgan, charged with murder in the first degree, brought in a verdict of guilty, and Judge Jacobs sentenced the prisoner to be confined in the penitentiary for life.

The engineer and fireman of the freight engine jumped from the cab. The engineer, Woodward, was seriously injured by his fall. A brakeman, whose name is unknown, is probably fatally injured.

1890-08-22T00:00:00Z,"The curious delusion of the New-York Sun that Senator EDMUNDS has become a ""convert"" to Mr. BLAINE'S ""suggestion of reciprocity"" has been pretty effectually exposed in the Washington correspondence of THE TIMES. It was the opinion of the Sun that when Mr. BLAINE read the resolution introduced by Senator EDMUNDS on Monday empowering the President to establish reciprocity by proclamation, the smile that played upon his features ""must have been beautiful to behold."""
1890-08-22T00:00:00Z,"SARATOGA, Aug. 21. -- ""Lucky"" Baldwin didn't carry off everything to-day, as is usually his hibit on stake days. But Cleopatra won the Equity Stakes for him and Sinaloa made a good effort for the Pocahontas. The Brighton gateman's filly was too fast for the millionaire's crack one this time, however, and Reclare beat the California filly home by a length."
1890-08-22T00:00:00Z,"In behalf of Senator Quay's candidate for the Governorship it is claimed that he is as true a friend of ballot reform as Robert E. Pattison, and that, if elected, he too might be depended upon to approve of any genuine measure to carry out the popular will in this respect. But the pledges of candidates when seeking votes are dirt cheap and are apt to be forgotten after the election."

1890-08-22T00:00:00Z,"Wall Street had a lively shaking up yesterday. Money on call brought in the neighborhood of 200 per cent. The stock market was badly rattled. Quotations ran off easily. Not a stock on the list escaped. Some figures dropped five or six points. Sugar Trust did. It sold around 82 Wednesday; yesterday it was down to 77. Of course, all similar stocks -- the trusts and other mercurial rattle-traps -- went down, too."
1890-08-22T00:00:00Z,"SAN FRANCISCO, Aug. 21. -- The Democratic State Convention to-day, so far as it went, nominated a strong and, as its members believe, a winning ticket.

The society had complained that Koster Bial's and several other similar resorts were not suitable places to have concert licenses."
1890-08-22T00:00:00Z,"CHICAGO, Aug. 21. -- Owing to the heavy track today, the Palo Alto-Jack match went over until tomorrow. The Standard Stakes in two classes down for to-day were postponed indefinitely. The races decided were these:"
1890-08-22T00:00:00Z,"ALBANY, Aug. 21. -- The meeting of the Republican General Committee of Albany County last evening was the scene of a savage attack on the Federal Administration."
1890-08-23T00:00:00Z,"The preparations made for the transfer of the body of JOHN ERICSSON from his adopted country to its final resting place in his native land are eminently worthy and impressive. The Baltimore, one of the very finest of our war ships, has been chosen for this duty, while the little Nantucket, one of the orignal monitors, built after the great engineer's designs, is intrusted with firing the minute salute."
1890-08-23T00:00:00Z,"WASHINGTON, Aug. 22. -- The special House committee investigating the charges against Commissioner Raum resumed its sessions this morning and continued the examination of the Commissioner.

The Directors to-day met and, after an examination of the books, issued a statement showing that the bank is in a good financial condition and amply able to meet all demands that might be made on it."
1890-08-23T00:00:00Z,"WASHINGTON, Aug. 22. -- The Force bill Senators have abandoned all attempts to have that obnoxious measure taken up during the present session of Congress. That is the definite outcome of the conference held last night, and it is a feather in the cap of Quay. But the wily Mr. Hoar has been guilty of a little trick which has taken the edge off the intense harmony which is declared to have followed the conference."
1890-08-23T00:00:00Z,"The action of the Treasury in offering, practically, to buy $20,000,000 of 4 12 per cent. bonds at par and interest to Sept. 1, 1891, so far s it had any effect, moderated the stringency in the money market yesterday. Its immediate effect cannot be very great, for the money it will bring out will necessarily come slowly owing to the nature of the holdings of this class of bonds."
1890-08-23T00:00:00Z,"The Atchison Globe says ex-Gov. Charles Robinson was shamefully imposed upon by the Farmers' Alliance of Kansas at its recent convention. Farmer Clover, it would appear, held out the inducement of nominating Robinson for Governor to the Democratic farmers in order to excite their interest in the Alliance movement."
1890-08-23T00:00:00Z,"RONDOUT, N.Y., Aug. 22. -- The determination of the brick manufacturers along the Hudson River to stop the shipment of their product to New-York on account of the boycott placed on the brick made at Verplanck's Point will have a serious effect on the business interests of Ulster County. The non-shipment of brick will affect the shipment of Rosendale cement and North River bluestone."
1890-08-23T00:00:00Z,"Wall Street felt better yesterday. Brokers did not have to pay 200 per cent. for call loans. Yet throughout the earlier part of the day the loan rate was up close to 100 per cent., and until late in the afternoon 50 per cent. was the quoted figure. But just before business ended a very marked change came over the money market."
1890-08-23T00:00:00Z,"News of the completion to the North Carolina State line of the Cincinnati, Charleston and Chicago Road comes from Johnson City, Tenn. A special dispatch to THE TIMES from Knoxville, Tenn., last night tells a curious story about the opposition encountered by the contractors. It was a struggle on their part against time, with $50,000 as the stake."
1890-08-23T00:00:00Z,"French tradesmen, acting on their own initiative, have opened a Commercial Museum in the Labor Exchange, near the Central Markets.

It is divided into two parts, one comprising all the official documents furnished by the Colonial Office respecting trade in Algeria, Tonquin, and other places under the French flag."
1890-08-23T00:00:00Z,"Final arrangements have been completed for the Ericsson ceremonies that are to take place to-day, and nothing has been left undone by the officers in charge of the programme that could in any way add to the popular reverence for the great inventor. Not in many years have the people of this city seen so imposing a fleet in this harbor, gathered to do honor to the memory of a national hero."
1890-08-23T00:00:00Z,"It seems that the three forces upon which Speaker REED chiefly relies for his opportunity of representing the First District of Maine is vote buying in the country towns, activity in the Kittery Navy Yard at election time, and the alliance of the Republican Party with the liquor sellers of Portland."
1890-08-23T00:00:00Z,"The death of Sir Richard Wallace brings to my mind an anecdote of the fourth Lord Hertford, from whom he derived his immense fortune. The Marquis in his preferences and mode of life was to all intents a Frenchman, and, though an English nobleman, he preferred to live among Frenchmen at Paris or at Bagatelle. It was natural that he should be infected with the French passion for being decorated."
1890-08-23T00:00:00Z,"POUGHKEEPSIE, Aug. 22. -- Fifteen heats were trotted and paced here this afternoon, and the Grand Circuit programme was cleared up, excepting one race which should be decided to-morrow. It was almost marvelous to see the track so good after the deluge that fell last night, but it seemed improved by the soaking, and the dust was blowing early in the afternoon."
1890-08-23T00:00:00Z,"One of the arguments presented to Congress in behalf of lineal instead of regimental promotion for subalterns in the army is the paper drawn up by Second Lieut. E.A. ROOT, twenty-second Infantry, and forwarded through the War Department to the House Military Committee. Lieut. ROOT shows that eighty-three officers in his own grade at the time of his writing had seen their juniors in lineal rank raised to First Lieutenancies over them."
1890-08-23T00:00:00Z,"ALBANY, N.Y., Aug. 22. -- There is a feeling here among a large class of citizens that the big strike will not extend any further and that the manoeuvres on the part of the leaders are for stock-jobbing purposes. Bowen Staley, one of the discharged employes of the Central, is the head of a committee which is soliciting subscriptions from merchants."
1890-08-23T00:00:00Z,"NEWPORT, Aug. 22. -- Walter Howe, a member of the Aqueduct Commission of New-York City, was drowned while bathing here to-day. Two years ago Mr. Howe purchased Glover Cottage on Beacon Hill, and here he spent his Summers with his wife and two sons, coming early and remaining late, making only such occasional visits to New-York as his business required."
1890-08-23T00:00:00Z,"There is now, so far as we can see, no hope that Atlantic Avenue, in Brooklyn, can be saved from an elevated road. Undoubtedly such a road would be a great improvement on the surface road now operated, which is to the last degree offensive and dangerous, and is kept so by the niggardly and reckless conduct of the company."
1890-08-23T00:00:00Z,"The Italian steel ship Chevaliere Ciampa, the handsomest if not the largest merchant ship over seen in this port, was decked in holiday attire at her anchorage off Bedlow's Island yesterday in honor of a party of visitors who, through the kindness of Mr. Louis Contencin, President of the Italian Chamber of Commerce, had been invited to inspect the vessel."
1890-08-23T00:00:00Z,"Those who read Mr. T.V. POWDERLY'S address ""to the people"" in yesterday's newspapers must have been surprised at the weakness of the case which he seemed to be trying to make out. Taken as the strongest statement that could be made of one side of a controversy, and left undisputed as to its allegations of fact, it shows no ground whatever for the contest which POWDERLY is struggling so desperately to bring about."
1890-08-23T00:00:00Z,"WATERTOWN, N.Y., Aug. 22. -- The State Firemen's Convention was brought to a close in this city this afternoon with one of the largest and finest parades ever made by volunteer fire organizations in the State.

Vrooman, and many other distinguished gentlemen reviewed the marching firemen."
1890-08-23T00:00:00Z,"PORTLAND, Me., Aug. 22. -- The story of the sudden ending in the Republican County Convention of this county of the Prohibitionist aspirant's candidacy for Sheriff, as told in THE TIMES'S Portland dispatch of Aug. 19, furnishes a striking exposition of the real sentiment of the Republican Party of this city upon the matter of prohibition."
1890-08-23T00:00:00Z,"Charles Webster, the actor, who shot and killed Robert McNeill, waived examination in the Jefferson Market Police Court yesterday and was held without bail to await the action of the Grand Jury.

1890-08-23T00:00:00Z,"In an unusually exciting contest at the Polo Grounds yesterday Whistler and Daily came in for a good deal of praise -- Whistler, because his home run to the left-field embankment won the game, and Daily because his effective pitching at several stages kept the visitors from scoring. With very little to spare, and men on bases in every inning, it can be seen what the degree of excitement was throughout the game."

1890-08-23T00:00:00Z,"Another twenty-four hours has passed and yet the trouble on the New-York Central and Hudson River Railroad system is in that uncertain condition that has for two weeks characterized this so-called strike. The war of words is growing tedious, but within this day there must transpire that which will convince the leaders of the Knights of Labor that it is time to stop shilly-shallying and dilly-dallying and to act."
1890-08-23T00:00:00Z,"The sudden death of WALTER HOWE is not merely a private affliction to his many friends, but a public calamity. He is one of the few men whose aspirations have led them and whose fortunes have enabled them to enter public life without making a trade of it, who have kept themselves equally free from the taint of political jobbery, and from the reproach of political amateurism."

Eldridge, one of the largest cattle shippers of Kansas City, was in the city this evening on his way to Washington, to appear before the House committee in opposition to the Senate bill providing for the inspection of live cattle and beef products intended for export.

1890-08-24T00:00:00Z,"It now seems likely that no suit will be brought against the Third Avenue Railroad Company by citizens near the Pearsall estate, in Westchester, where the company now has a pasture for its decrepit and diseased horses. President Lewis Lyon of the company has said that he would be glad to remove the horses to other quarters as soon as a suitable place could be found."
1890-08-24T00:00:00Z,"LONDON, Aug. 23. -- Although the London papers still discuss the subject in small type on their inside pages and have not thought it worth while to send a single staff man to inquire into the exact situation, the conviction that an Irish famine is impending is slowly asserting itself in the popular mind as the dominant topic of interest."
1890-08-24T00:00:00Z,"ON THE SQUIN, July 30. -- Tom has been keeping a diary since we came here, two weeks ago to-day. This morning he allowed me to read a few pages. He said a few pages would be all that I should want to read. Here are some of entries:"

1890-08-24T00:00:00Z,"BERLIN, Aug. 23. -- To-night's news from the Peterhof conveys the distinct impression that the imperial meetings have had a highly satisfactory result for Emperor William. Chancellor von Caprivi had a conference with the Czar to-day which lasted over an hour. Afterward he had a long interview with Foreign Minister de Giers."
1890-08-24T00:00:00Z,"LAKE GEORGE, Aug. 23. -- An elaborate dinner party was given by Mr. and Mrs. Alexander Orr of Troy at the Fort William Henry Hotel Thursday evening.

1890-08-24T00:00:00Z,"ST. LOUIS, Aug. 23. -- From S.L. Andrews of Vinta, Indian Territory, THE TIMES'S correspondent this evening obtained a hint of how the cattlemen feel over the order that they must vacate the Indian Territory. The cattlemen have evidently believed up to to-day that the President's order would not be strictly carried out. This morning's dispatches from Washington show that Secretary Noble will insist on a strict enforcement. Mr. Andrews said:"
1890-08-24T00:00:00Z,"ST. LOUIS, Aug. 23. -- Fashionable German circles and other circles not so high-toned are agitated over the disappearance and prolonged absence from his accustomed haunts of Capt.

1890-08-24T00:00:00Z,"PARIS, Aug. 8. -- The Bois is a desert and the Avenue des Acacias a wilderness; but, if this extraordinary Summer continues, with its astonishing alterations of wind and chilly blast, another month, the chasse will drive every one back from seashore and springs."
1890-08-24T00:00:00Z,"Col. James A. Hamilton of Jackson, Miss., is a typical Southerner of the old school. He was in the city yesterday and stopped at the Auditorium Hotel. Col. Hamilton does not believe the Lodge Force bill will ever become a law. He has just come from Washington, where he spent several weeks looking after various matters of interest to Mississippians."

This year there are 569 chapters, which the Secretary of State prepared carefully for publication. The 1,300 and odd pages are freely besprinkled with the asterisk."
1890-08-24T00:00:00Z,"The season at the State Camp of Instruction ended yesterday with the termination of the tour of duty of the Sixty-ninth Regiment.

1890-08-24T00:00:00Z,"JESSUP'S NECK, L.I., Aug. 23. -- The American Canoe Association camp on this delightful spot broke up to-day, and the jolliest fortnight that ever canoe men spent is now but a pleasant remembrance. The boys went away in all sorts of conveyances -- carriages, sloops, their own canoes, the Transportation Committee's launch, and the steamboat from dawn yesterday until dusk to-day, and the Neck now presents a woefully deserted appearance."
1890-08-24T00:00:00Z,"Few of the hunreds of Americans who are ""doing"" Europe this Summer, racing from city to city and from gallery to gallery with that superabundance of energy that marks the Yankee on his travels, will come home having accomplished half as much or with a tithe of the varied and interesting information as has Prof. Albert S. Bickmore, who arrived on La Normandie Monday."

1890-08-24T00:00:00Z,"PIRANESI. -- The Antichita Romane show Piranesi at his best and with full command of all the technicalities and resources of his art. Though all the plates of this collection are not of equal interest or value, most of them are masterpieces of composition and execution, but the artist has been accused of allowing himself to be carried away by his imagination and thereby sacrificing the scientific precision and truthfulness denmnded by the archmologist,"
1890-08-24T00:00:00Z,"SPRING LAKE, Aug. 23. -- The people of this resort do not feel flattered that their favorite place along the New-Jersey coast is becoming known as Philadelphia's Newport. They claim, with the emphasis and vigor of conviction, that Spring Lake is nobody's Newport, but is the first, best, and soon to be the most popular resort between Sandy Hook and Cape May."
1890-08-24T00:00:00Z,"PITTSBURG, Aug. 23. -- Another passenger train was wrecked last night. The wreck was deliberately planned, and that it did not result in loss of life was not the fault of the wreckers, but simply the result of the fortunate breaking of the air tubes, which closed the brakes and stopped the train almost instantly."
1890-08-24T00:00:00Z,"ALEXANDRIA BAY, Aug. 23. -- Three hundred visitors to the Thousand Islands have reason to be thankful this week that they are spared to return to their friends after the disastrous fire at Thousand Island Park, which destroyed the hotel and several cottages.

1890-08-24T00:00:00Z,"WHO SHALL HOLD JERUSALEM? -- I say boldly, theoretically, in the freedom of a person wholly irresponsible, that Jerusalem would be most safe either in French or British hands. We who carry tolerance to a fault, or they to whom it is the rule of a sharp and distinctly-defined possibility -- only invaded at home by their panic at clericalism -- would make it safe and keep it so."
1890-08-24T00:00:00Z,"William Hanlon, an athlete, fell from the dome of the Academy of Music last night during the performance in that house and struck the floor of the auditorium, severely cutting his scalp and otherwise injuring himself to the horror of the spectators who crowded the place.

1890-08-24T00:00:00Z,"An invitation for a dinner should be formally worded and written in the third person. Each guest is invited individually; that is, his or her name should appear on his or her card. A little flattery is implied by this substitution for the pronoun. There is, however, another style, much affected by many well-bred persons, of inserting in the invitation the name of some guest to be specially honored."
1890-08-24T00:00:00Z,"IN HELIGOLAND. -- Crime there is none, for no criminal could possibly escape except with the connivance of practically the whole population. This difficulty of escape was amusingly illustrated last year. Two housebreakers from ltambnrg came across on a professional visit. They had a highly successful evening's work; every door stood open: they had only to watch when no one was by, step bokly in, and carry away' what they cared for."
1890-08-24T00:00:00Z,"LENOX, Mass., Aug. 23. -- The influx of visitors from Bar Harbor, Newport, and the seaside watering places has begun, and every train brings more visitors and the hotels are filling up very rapidly.

She beat the Fife boat 2:22 on a run before the wind of ten and three-fourth miles, and, as the time shows, beat her three seconds on the windward work home."
1890-08-24T00:00:00Z,"Your ringing articles on the absurdities of the proposed McKinley tariff are what is needed to show up this iniquitous and oppressive measure in its true light. The hosiery and glove clause in the bill is entirely in the interests of a few domestic manufacturers, and if enacted into a law will impose a tax upon the whole people which is as unjust and oppressive as it is unnecessary."
1890-08-24T00:00:00Z,"The great retaliatory boycott ordered against the organized building trades of New-York, Brooklyn, and Jersey City by the associated brickmakers of the Hudson River brick-producing district went into operation yesterday, according to announcement, and, except as provided in the programme of the brickmakers, not a brick came down the river."

1890-08-24T00:00:00Z,"LAKE HOPATCONG, N.J., Aug. 23. -- Dr. Skeul's cottage was the centre of attention Wednesday, Campanini had called and consented to sing. High C rang over the lake in a most inspiring way, and the great tenor never had a more appreciative audience. At Lotta's cottage one hears little music but that of the mandolin.

1890-08-25T00:00:00Z,"The Union Iron Works recently completed a 100-stamp silver mill, which is one of the largest pieces of mining machinery ever built, and it is asserted by members of the company to be the finest stamp mill ever made anywhere."
1890-08-25T00:00:00Z,"In ""Evolution and Disease"" Mr. Sutton does not attempt to do more than to venture on the outskirts of a little-known subject. He wisely enough, acknowledges the topic to be essentially novel, and he writes: ""Doubtless a more extended study will show that many of my conclusions are fallacious."""
1890-08-25T00:00:00Z,"Years ago there was in Cheyenne a saloon of the concert type called ""The Gold Dust."" It had one story architecturally; historically it had many, and this is one of them: There was a Spaniard in Cheyenne then. His name, itturned out afterward, was Ramon Braguda, but those by whom he was surrounded, too impatient for foreign pronunciation, called him ""Charlie."""
1890-08-25T00:00:00Z,"On Thursday the race meetings at Monmouth Park and Saratoga will be brought to a close and the horses will be shipped to the pretty Sheepshead Bay track. To most racegoers the change will be a most welcome one, for the long straight tracks at Monmouth and the horses running the reverse way of the track are innovations that have been anything but popular."
1890-08-25T00:00:00Z,"One week from to-day the South Jersey Jockey Club will open its new race course at Gloucester City, N.J., within a half hour's ride of Philadelphia. This track is an entirely new one, built especially to satisfy the loves of horse racing in the vicinity of the Quaker City. It occupies 250 acres of land, mostly reclaimed marsh land, and is situated on the bank of the Delawa e River."

1890-08-25T00:00:00Z,"A ""prominent Atchison Democrat"" tells the Atchison Globe that the Kansas State Democratic ticket will come out third this year, and that Willetts, the candidate for Governor of the People's Party, is apt to beat Humphrey, Republican. This Democrat reasons this way: ""The Alliance draws its forces two-thirds from the Republicans and one-third from the Democrats."
1890-08-25T00:00:00Z,"Probably few persons have ever sailed across the ocean without wondering what is concealed under those deep blue waters. So far as the greatest depths are concerned we are not likely to learn very much; but it is possible to obtain specimens from the bottom at less depths. The results of a ""scoop"" from a bottom 130 fathoms below the surface are set forth in an interesting manner by a writer in the Edinburgh Scotsman."
1890-08-25T00:00:00Z,"It will be possible to get some really delicious peaches this week. There are a few peaches ripening in New-Jersey, in the Hudson River Valley, in Northern Pennsylvania, and in Ohio. There will be several hundred baskets daily this week from these various points, and most of them will be well-flavored, and many of them attractive in appearance and of good size."

1890-08-26T00:00:00Z,"WASHINGTON, Aug. 25. -- Has Mr. Blaine been at work ""down Biddeford way"" to bother Mr. Reed's canvass? Has he broken into the Kittery Navy Yard and helped to make it impossible, without scandal, to put 800 men to work on nothing whatever to do? Blaine is the most omnipresent man in political life just now and Reed sees him in every bad wrinkle of affairs all the way from Congress to Kittery."
1890-08-26T00:00:00Z,"WASHINGTON, Aug. 25. -- The Director of the Mint said to-day that there seems to be a general misapprehension as to the operations of the new silver law in case the price of silver should advance to parity."
1890-08-26T00:00:00Z,"The tide of immigration continues to rise with somewhat striking eddies here and there. The monthly increases over 1889 of a few unimpressive thousands have swollen for the year already to over 29,000, or more than our regular army. On the other hand, the monthly decreases in arrivals from the British Kingdom have aggregated nearly 17,000. It will be interesting to notice whether the potato famine will again swell the diminishing Irish quota."
1890-08-26T00:00:00Z,"LONDON, Aug. 25. -- Play in the biennial masters' tournament, under the auspices of the British Chess Association, began to-day at Manchester, the local clubs of which place have largely contributed to the prize funds.

An amendment was adopted increasing the President's term of office to two years."
1890-08-26T00:00:00Z,"COLUMBUS, Ohio, Aug. 25. -- It has just been discovered that the Court House ring has had a bonanza during the past few years, and that the County Treasury has been a large sufferer by the ravages of the plunderers. The county officers have been piling up the money in a manner that has been a surprise to the natives and most burdensome to the taxpayers."
1890-08-26T00:00:00Z,"In all likelihood the bill for international copyright will not be called up before the Committee on Patents until Thursday. Those who are watching in Washington are sanguine of its passage, as usual, because its enemies are neither many nor determined. Its danger seems to lie in the apathy of those who have paid little attention to a question which to them appears to have less claims to importance than other matters now before Congress."
1890-08-26T00:00:00Z,"The fact that the Municipal Government of Brooklyn has daily balances in various banks aggregating about $1,400,000 has attracted the attention of several New-York banking institutions, whose officers have taken steps to get this cash by offering to pay more for it than the city now gets from local institutions."

For the initial trip the train was patronized by an unexpectedly large number of people.
1890-08-26T00:00:00Z,"The wane of the holiday season is surely a most apropos time for any contribution to the law of the lien of hotel keepers upon the goods of guests who do not pay their bills. That a hotel keeper may detain such goods is a familiar rule, qualified, it now seems, by important and intricate exceptions."
1890-08-26T00:00:00Z,"The complaints made against the association which holds the leases of the various hotel sites and other privileges in Yellowstone Park should be carefully investigated by the Interior Department. Indeed, Secretary NOBLE is likely to do this, since it was he that made these leases only about a fortnight after entering on his office, and they run for a term of ten years."
1890-08-26T00:00:00Z,"LOUISVILLE, Ky., Aug. 25. -- The soldiers protecting Judge Lilly's court at Hazard, Terry County, Ky., captured J.C. Jones, the noted bushwhacker from Knox County yesterday, and placed him in jail at Hazard. ""Clate"" Jones, as he is called, is credited with having killed more men than any man in Kentucky. Twenty-five men is a modest estimate of the number said to have been murdered by him."
1890-08-26T00:00:00Z,"The immigration bureau at the Barge Office was thrown into a state of unusual excitement yesterday. Early in the forenoon the rumor was industriously circulated from one officer to another that Phillipsen, the self-confessed murderer of the Dane, Meyer, in Copenhagen last January, had been caught in the Barge Office and under very curious circumstances."
1890-08-26T00:00:00Z,"WASHINGTON, Aug. 25. -- The formal agreement to vote on the Tariff bill on Sept. 8 would have been made in the Senate to-day had Mr. Plumb been absent, but the Kansas Senator was on hand, and his single objection prevented the adoption of the agreement for to-day."

Jones, owner, and three five-story flats at One Hundred and Twenty-first Street and Manhattan Avenue, to cost $80,000, William Higenbotham, owner."
1890-08-26T00:00:00Z,"Some of the statements sent out from this city relative to the alleged inefficiency of the Albany police force in dealing with the troubles incident to the strike on the Central Hudson have aroused much indignation here. Albany has two municipal departments of which it is justly proud, the Fire Department and the Department of Police. No one here doubts the efficiency of the police force to deal with any rioting likely to arise."
1890-08-26T00:00:00Z,""" It must not be forgotten that negotiations are already going on between the American Government and the silver mines of the United States with a view of bringing about an arrangement similar to the one agreed upon by the well-known French Metal Company and the copper mines.""

1890-08-26T00:00:00Z,"There are three associations at the Eastern end of the Grand Trotting Circuit which are in to stay, namely, these at Hartford, Springfield, and Philadelphia. The Charter Oak Association, at the Connecticut capital, has been making money every year under the management of its keen and capable Secretary, T.O. King, who pinned his faith on stake races and has made them a success."
1890-08-26T00:00:00Z,"The Supreme Council of the Federation of Railway Employes decided yesterday at Terre Haute not to order a strike of the unions which it represents, as no cause recognized by the constitution of the Federation was made out; but it expressed its approval of POWDERLY'S course and promised ""moral support"" for the strike of the Knights of Labor."
1890-08-26T00:00:00Z,"The new play which De Mille and Belasco were under contract to finish for Charles Frohman by Sept. 1 was completed last Friday, ten full days before the time given the dramatists. It is a purely American play, and will follow ""All the Comforts of Home"" at the Twenty-third Street Theatre."
1890-08-26T00:00:00Z,"Our Washington dispatches this morning again serve to bring out the immense power lodged under our methods of legislation in a very few men. If the Senate shall pass the Tariff bill, with amendments, the bill will necessarily go to a conference committee consisting of two friends and one opponent of the general purpose of the bill from the House and the same number from the Senate."
1890-08-26T00:00:00Z,"LONG BRANCH, Aug. 25. -- The increasing disaffection among the Republicans of New-Jersey with President Harrison's Administration is no longer a matter of surmise or speculation. From cautious whisperings of discontent with the conduct of national affairs as related to the State, Republicans whose prominence has long entitled them to the distinction of leadership have become outspoken in their criticism of the President."
1890-08-26T00:00:00Z,"MILWAUKEE, Wis., Aug. 25. -- The possibility that Wisconsin will go Democratic this Fall has created considerable anxiety among the number of politicians who are candidates for places on the slates. The Governorship and United States Senatorship are the prizes most sought after."

There were twenty-five trains, some going north and others south, and composed altogether of a thousand cars."
1890-08-26T00:00:00Z,"When there is a strike or a boycott on any considerable scale there are usually three parties in interest, of which the general public is one. The rights of the public are supposed to be protected by law and represented by the public authorities, but they are apt to be wholly ignored in the contest in which the other two parties are engaged."
1890-08-26T00:00:00Z,"Rusie was mainly responsible for the loss of yesterday's game by the New-Yorks to Anson's team. He had little control of the ball, and made it extremely difficult for Buckley to hold him, inasmuch as Buckley's hands are in anything but good condition. Rusie all through the game threw the ball everywhere except in the proper place. The New-Yorks allowed the Chicagos to score 4 runs before they fully realized how matters stood."
1890-08-26T00:00:00Z,"Senator Wilson of Iowa gave a Washington Post man the other day a pretty good idea of the status of prohibition in Iowa. ""The original-package crop was pretty speedily harvested in my State,"" he said. ""It was probably a blessing in disguise in this way: It showed the people how tremendous was the evil of the unrestricted sale of alcoholic liquors."
1890-08-26T00:00:00Z,"The class of horses entered for the races at Monmouth to-day shows pretty plainly that the end of the season is approaching at that race course. The peculiar conditions of the Home Bred Produce Stakes, which require that the dam of an eligible horse shall be the exclusive property of the nominator, who shall also own the produce, precludes the possibility of a large field of starters."
1890-08-26T00:00:00Z,""" What do you mean?"" said a gentleman jumping aside as a tramp drew back his hand as if to strike him. ""Nothing at all, Sir,"" replied the tramp meekly.

1890-08-26T00:00:00Z,"CHICAGO, Aug. 25. -- Provisions in the speculative market were only moderately active, and the volume of business was considerably under the recent average.

1890-08-26T00:00:00Z,"It is a little odd that the only objection made in the Senate yesterday to the Republican order of business came from Mr. PLUMB of Kansas, while Mr. GORMAN, for the Democrats, swallowed the whole thing and expressed himself as rather gratified to get it. The grounds on which Mr. PLUMB objected to the arrangement were entirely unanswerable, as those on which Mr. GORMAN accepted it were almost wholly irrelevant."
1890-08-26T00:00:00Z,It would be difficult to bestow too much praise upon the naval officers who managed the Ericsson parade. The precision of time with which the column moved and the exactness with which the embarkation coincided with the programme were features alike commendable and novel. The procession moved precisely at 2 o'clock; the embarkation took place just as the hands of the Produce Exchange clock stood at 3.
1890-08-26T00:00:00Z,"PITTSBURG, Penn., Aug. 25. -- When the Pan Handle Express No. 2 pulled into the Union Station at 7 o'clock this morning, it brought with it a day coach containing about forty men.

1890-08-26T00:00:00Z,"The account given in Halifax tidings of the latest fining of a vessel under the Newfoundland bait law refers, so far as the dispatches show, to a schooner owned in Canada. The Halifax people represent that the Captain of this craft had been for seventeen years visiting the Newfoundland coast and buying bait there without molestation, being always careful to obey the regulations."
1890-08-26T00:00:00Z,"OTTAWA, Ontario, Aug. 25. -- The Minister of Customs was asked if any representations had been made to him in reference to the alleged refusal of the United States Government to allow the consignment of cartridges from the establishment of the Dominion Cartridge Company to pass through the United States in bond for Mexico."

1890-08-27T00:00:00Z,"There are two bills before the House of Representatives at Washington whose sole purpose is political effect upon the farmers of the Northwest, to stay their threatened exodus from the Republican Party on account of its tariff policy, but neither of which would work the slightest benefit to them. All day yesterday was consumed in the House in an unavailing effort to bring the Compound Lard bill to a vote."

1890-08-27T00:00:00Z,"ROME, N.Y., Aug. 26. -- About three hundred people assembled in the little ravine at Perryville, Madison County, this afternoon to witness a private trial of the Justin dynamite shell. No invitations were sent out, and it was intended that it should to be a quiet affair, but nevertheless the interest was as intense as it was in the last trial that occurred on May 27."
1890-08-27T00:00:00Z,"Acting Controller Storrs wrote to Mr. Hans S. Beattie, Commissioner of Street Cleaning, Monday to call his attention to several names on the pay roll which were put down on the roll under the head of skilled laborers.

1890-08-27T00:00:00Z,"NEWPORT, R.I., Aug. 26. -- Should the weather continue to be fine the tenth annual championship tournament for singles will be commenced on the courts of the Casino here to-morrow morning. More than the usual interest centres in the tournament this year because of the many experts who will play, and each day's contests will undoubtedly attract large crowds of spectators."
1890-08-27T00:00:00Z,"STONE CREEK, Conn., Aug. 26. -- This quiet resort is full of joy. At last it has a sensation. The sensation is of a geological-piratical nature. It involves Boss Hugh McLaughlin, Brooklyn's Democratic chieftain; ex-Senator Murtha, also of Brooklyn, and the late lamented and somewhat notorious Capt. Kidd of no place in particular, but of the high seas in general."
1890-08-27T00:00:00Z,"PHILADELPHIA, Aug. 26. -- The Journal of the Knights of Labor this week prints an editorial calling on the Knights as a body to sustain the cause of the New-York Central strikers. It expresses due gratitude to the Supreme Council of the Federation for the ""moral support"" which it has extended to the strikers, while hinting that its active support would have been much more valuable."
1890-08-27T00:00:00Z,"SARATOGA, Aug. 26. -- Although a week beyond the accepted date of the season's high-water mark, there are more people in town than three days ago. Every incoming train brings guests in large numbers and as a hotel man remarked, ""Now that the strike is off we'll get all the mountain and Lake George folks, who like to stop a few days in Saratoga on the way down."""
1890-08-27T00:00:00Z,"We notice that some of the Republican journals that have become convinced of the folly of the Elections bill are now talking about it as if the action upon it by the Senate were final and were equivalent to a complete abandonment of it. It is quite possible that this may turn out to be the practical effect of the Senate's action, but it cannot fairly be said that it was the intended effect."
1890-08-27T00:00:00Z,"The situation in regard to the brick supply for this city was unchanged yesterday. Early in the morning five cargoes, making, in the aggregate, about 1,000,000 brick, arrived at the pier at the foot of West Thirtieth Street. There had been left over from Monday's arrival twelve cargoes, so that the day opened with a visible supply of seventeen cargoes, or upward of 3,400,000 brick."
1890-08-27T00:00:00Z,"Now there is a serious strike of switchmen at the stock yards in Chicago. The chief cause of trouble seems to be a determination of the switchmen of the Chicago and Alan Road to select the yardmen under whom they will serve instead of allowing the company to do it. The epidemic appears to have extended to the employes of other lines, anti a general tie-up is threatened."
1890-08-27T00:00:00Z,"TERRE HAUTE, Ind., Aug. 26. -- The members of the Supreme Council of the Federation of Railway Employes wasted no time in getting out of town after the adjournment.

1890-08-27T00:00:00Z,"WASHINGTON, Aug. 26. -- Speaker Reed's rules, which were announced as something calculated to end all business speeding through the House without delay, and which were declared to be particularly intended to discourage Democratic obstructionists, are a failure when a Republican obstructor arises. The tyranny of the rules and rule maker are for Democrats."
1890-08-27T00:00:00Z,"ALBANY, Aug. 26. -- There has been a decided dull in the interest over the condition of affairs upon the Central Road, and everybody but the most ardent Knights look upon the matter as settled.

An American flag floats over the shops, the staff having been erected recently."
1890-08-27T00:00:00Z,"COLUMBIA, S.C., Aug. 26. -- United States Senator M.C. Butler arrived in the city to-day from Washington. He came thinking he might be instrumental in calming the political storm that agitates the State. In view of the eagerness of some extremists for a split in the party, Senator Butler's views will be found interesting. There is no crumb of comfort for the splitters in his words."
1890-08-27T00:00:00Z,"SARATOGA, Aug. 26. -- The feature of to-day's races here was the running of the Kenner Stakes for three-year-olds, at a mile and three-quarters.

Details of the races during the day are as follows:"
1890-08-27T00:00:00Z,"RALEIGH, N.C., Aug. 26. -- The Negro State Convention assembled here to-day. Sixty counties are represented by 200 delegates. They are the most intelligent men of the negro race. Speeches have been made by nearly every leading man, and the burden and strength of their addresses have been the unequal division of the Federal patronage and the discrimination against the negroes in this respect by the white leaders of the Republican Party."
1890-08-27T00:00:00Z,"NIAGARA FALLS, N.Y., Aug. 26. -- The second day of the wheelmen's meeting was held under cloudy skies, but the rain held off until late in the afternoon, permitting the successful running of the first day's racing.

1890-08-27T00:00:00Z,"RICHFIELD SPRINGS, N.Y., Aug. 26. -- The long-delayed coaching and carriage parade took place this afternoon and more than fulfilled the high expectations with which it has been looked for. It was as pretty a sight as Richfield has ever seen. Many of the carriages were elaborately trimmed and banked with flowers. Wreaths of green and white covered the horses. The wheels were solid masses of golden rod, gladiola, sweet peas, and asters."
1890-08-27T00:00:00Z,"There is trouble in the management of the Fay Templeton opera burlesque company now playing in the Fourteenth Street Theatre.

1890-08-31T00:00:00Z,"NEWPORT, R.I., Aug. 30. -- This week has marked the height of the social season, and yet next week promises to be almost as gay, several more private balls being still on the lists, while the continuation of the lawn tennis tournament and the society pony races will make the week a full one. Polo is nearly over, and the fox hunts end with the close of the coming week."
1890-08-31T00:00:00Z,"BERLIN, Aug. 30. -- The progress of the negotiations for the entrance of Russia into the European entente is indicated by the arrangements for the Autumn meetings of the sovereigns.

1890-08-31T00:00:00Z,"NEW-MILFORD, Conn., Aug. 30. -- The Housatonic River is a willing and beautiful slave to a large portion of the inhabitants of the western part of Connecticut.

1890-08-31T00:00:00Z,"The rather gloomy anticipations prevalent in the Street at the close of last week have been pleasantly disappointed. There has been no serious disturbance in the market, and the worst of the money troubles appear to be over. The early financial frost has nipped a things which will not recover again, but it has also cleared the atmosphere."

Anderson of Jersey City, the engineer who has been awarded the contract for building the half-a-million-dollar lighthouse off Cape Hatteras, will start in a few days for that tempestuous region to take his preliminary soundings and arrange for the building of his great steel caisson. The terms of the contract, signed and approved, reached Mr. Anderson from Washington only a few days ago."
1890-08-31T00:00:00Z,"RAPID DICTION IN SHAKESPEARE'S DAY. -The short space of time, two hours and a half, in which an Elizabethan play was acted in Shakespeare's time, has excited much discussion among commentators. It can hardly be doubted that the dialogue, which often exceeds two thousand lines, was all spoken on the stage, for none of the dramatists wrote with a view to publication, and few of the plays were printed from the author's manuscript."
1890-08-31T00:00:00Z,"TROUVILLE, Aug. 14. -- Paris stagnation and a longing for one fresh sea breeze induced me to run down here for the two great race days.

1890-08-31T00:00:00Z,"There is much chronicling of costumes worn at the Summer resorts just now, but it is a mistake to suppose that all the pretty dresses have left the city, any more than all the pretty girls. Indeed, where there is one of the latter there are sure to be very many of the former."
1890-08-31T00:00:00Z,"KINGSTON, N.Y., Aug. 30. -- The weather in the Catskills for the past few days has been delightful, and, although several thousand people have returned to their city homes, many yet remain.

Social doings are up to the mark."
1890-08-31T00:00:00Z,"There is food for a great deal of reflection, as well as the potentiality of food, for a great number of underfed Frenchmen in the present aspect of the American pork question and the French picture question. What these two questions have to do with each other is not at first sight, nor indeed in the last analysis, at all clear except to statesmen."

He raises his hat simply when a person bows to him, and he has to raise it pretty often, for this is the President of the United States taking a walk."
1890-08-31T00:00:00Z,"Gustave Flaubert wrote ""Salammbo"" after a voyage to Carthage, a vast plain where a blade of grass will not grow.

Politics in antiquity went no further than the limits of a city."

The depredations of last Winter injured the beds. The prices, of course, will be high, and this fact is the cause of the scramble that will open the season."
1890-08-31T00:00:00Z,"Since racing in harness first became popular that branch of turf sport has always been more or less hindered in its popularity by unscrupulous owners, drivers, or those who control horses and do not hesitate to indulge in any species of dishonesty that is likely to prove more profitable than fair and open contests where the best horse wins."
1890-08-31T00:00:00Z,"The San Francisco's triumph in her recent trial over the Santa Barbara course may well be gratifying to the country as well as to her contractors and to the Navy Department. It not only adds one of the fastest cruisers in the world to our new navy, but it furnishes a fresh demonstration of the ability of the Pacific coast to build its own war vessels and to look out for its own defenses."

1890-08-31T00:00:00Z,"RED BANK, N.J., Aug. 30. -- The fishermen have bad pretty good luck during the past week. The river is fairly alive with fish, and Walton's disciples return home every night with large strings. There is any quantity of porgies and snapping mackerel. Eels are too plentiful, and tugging hard crabs are frequently bought to the surface on the hook. Bass are biting well, and some very large plaice have been taken."
1890-08-31T00:00:00Z,I sent to the New-York Tribune the letter of which I inclose a copy with a request for its publication. No attention has been paid to my request. I shall be obliged if you will find room for the letter in the columns of THE TIMES.

Rules prescribing the etiquette to be observed in the dancing pavilion are hung about the walls almost as thickly as quills on a porcupine's back.

1890-08-31T00:00:00Z,"THE EARLY STAGE IRISHMAN. -- Of paramount importance among early entertainments in which sketches of Irish character had a place were the Masques at Court.

1890-08-31T00:00:00Z,There seems now to be danger that Tammany's hard row will be made harder to hoe in the next municipal campaign by the wholesale defection of the liquor trade. Everybody knows that this trade has always furnished the sinew in Tammany's struggles. Without the support of the liquor interests and influences Tammany would have been a dead cock in the pit long ago in the politics of this city.

The seven-year climacteric of immorality is now there raging, if we may derive an impression from the journals arriving from London. The Tribune during the Beecher trial is a faint reflection not of the rather lurid Telegraph, nor of the most respectable Standard, but of the immaculate London Times."

1890-09-01T00:00:00Z,The sober leader of the Pittsburg Press will attract the attention of the scores of thousands of considerate voters in Pennsylvania. The fact that the Press is one of four Republican papers of Pittsburg which refuse to support Delamater -- leaving only one to support the party ticket -- will give additional importance to the article quoted.
1890-09-01T00:00:00Z,"The Courier-Journal does not mince matters in discussing Congress and the boss of the lower house. It says: ""For eight months Congress has been in session, yet with Reed at the head and a subservient majority under his feet, legislation, necessary legislation, is in a more unfinished condition than ever before at this date. Every promise made to excuse the election of a charlatan and a buffoon Speaker of the House has been falsified."
1890-09-01T00:00:00Z,"The advent of Autumn brings us face to face with the great political conflict in Pennsylvania. It will be one of the most earnest and probably desperate contests of our political history, and it is exceptional in the exhibition of individuality among all classes of voters. Old methods, which are summed up in leaders and followers, will be valueless in the Pennsylvania battle of 1890."

The latest announcement to stir our harmless jealousy comes from Vienna, whence, indeed, we are used to receive such tidings."

1890-09-02T00:00:00Z,"The reorganized McCaull Opera Company made its first appearance in this city last evening at Hammerstein's Harlem Opera House. The operetta chosen for the occasion was Millocker's ""Seven Suabians,"" adapted in English by Harry B. Smith.

A good many restaurants, of course, did business as usual."
1890-09-02T00:00:00Z,"CHICAGO, Sept. 1. -- The bulk of the operations in Provisions to-day was by the changers. September product was changed over into January on a great scale.

They played three games in one day and won all of them."
1890-09-02T00:00:00Z,"The state of mining in Chili occupies a considerable part of the latest report of the British Vice Consul at Caldera. The disastrous termination of the copper syndicate, he says, naturally affected his district, though before the full effects were experienced the price again rose, and as silver has also increased in value, the present outlook is encouraging."
1890-09-02T00:00:00Z,"ST. LOUIS, Sept. 1. -- T.P. Rixey, Grand Master of the Grand Lodge of Missouri, Independent Order of Odd Fellows, has decided that the resolution passed by the Grand Lodge at its last session, providing for ridding the order in the State of the saloon-keeping members is in conflict with former decisions of the Sovereign Grand Lodge, and that the resolution will not be enforced."
1890-09-02T00:00:00Z,"With clear, warm weather it was natural that yesterday should see thousands of pleasure seekers at the resorts near the city, but the most striking feature of the day was the rush of people from the more distant watering places, bound home after vacations spent in the country. Sept. 1 always sees this tide of travel at its height."
1890-09-02T00:00:00Z,"NYACK, N.Y., Sept. 1. -- This has been a great day for the Nyack Rowing Association, made memorable by the thorough ""ducking"" received by a majority of the oarsmen in the Fall regatta.

1890-09-02T00:00:00Z,"Next to a dog that amuses himself by barking all night, a rooster that persists in exercising his voice is nature's own nuisance, especially when the rooster lives in town.

1890-09-02T00:00:00Z,"Warner Miller's speech to the farmers at the Three River Point Fair last Saturday as reported by the Tribune, was remarkable for its conflicting statements. He told his hearers at the outset than he owned a farm, but doubted if it had paid in the last two or three years. He had not balanced his books, ""not wishing to see a loss."""
1890-09-02T00:00:00Z,"CHICAGO, Sept. 1. -- There was a report to-day in the wheat pit that the tight money market in the Northwest was going to make it impossible for the big millers in Minneapolis to carry all the Spring wheat they need, and which they usually require at this time. Of course direct reference was made to Pillsbury, he alone using 15,000,000 bushels a year out of the 40,000,000 used at Minneapolis."
1890-09-02T00:00:00Z,"PAWTUCKET, R.I., Sept. 1. -- One hundred years ago Samuel Slater succeeded, for the first time on the western continent, in spinning cotton by power machinery.

1890-09-02T00:00:00Z,"Whatever the special circumstances attending the recent treatment of the Venezuelan flag at Point Barima by the British gunboat Ready, the act indicates that Great Britain is determined to maintain her foothold at that place.

1890-09-03T00:00:00Z,"Mr. WEBB made one acknowledgment before the Board of Arbitration yesterday which must be regarded as the acknowledgment of a mistake. He admitted that he secured the services of PINKERTON'S men before applying for the services of the police, and indeed before the strike began. This is all wrong."

And in the first half of 1890 twenty more railways fell into difficulties. Probably it is wholly superfluous to cite even these figures by way of maintaining the proposition, already established by bitter experience to so many, that scarcely any topic more interests worried investors."
1890-09-03T00:00:00Z,"The Fifth Avenue Hotel was buzzing with politicians yesterday. They had been drawn thither by the announcement that the Republican State Committee was to meet, and in view of the sequestration of Frederick S.

1890-09-03T00:00:00Z,"The State Board of Arbitration has not done much to justify its creation, but it is doing a useful if not a very illustrious public service in investigating the causes of the recent strike on the New-York Central.

This concern was recently incorporated at Springfield, Ill., with a capital of $1,500,000, E.L. Kohaus of this city filing the articles of incorporation for the company."
1890-09-06T00:00:00Z,"WASHINGTON, Sept. 5. -- The Senate got through with the free list of the Tariff bill to-day, except that here and there a paragraph was laid aside to await action upon items in the dutiable lists previously passed over. Sugar below No. 16 Dutch standard was one of these, the fate of the paragraph depending upon what is done with the sugar schedule, which is still to be disposed of."
1890-09-06T00:00:00Z,"It is not very creditable to Dr. PETERS that he has joined the throng of those who, under the inspiration of the German East African Company, have lately been engaged in decrying the rescuer of EMIN Pasha. While STANLEY was employed in this humane purpose, undergoing great sufferings in carrying it out, Dr. PETERS was violating the policy of his own Government by encroaching upon British rights in Africa."
1890-09-06T00:00:00Z,"Anglers who have not become tired of trying to secure game fish in the lower bay, and are now making fishing excursions, meet with fair success. There is a promise that the season will close much more brilliantly than it opened. Only about three weeks more of salt-water angling remains, for there is not much use in looking for fish in October."
1890-09-06T00:00:00Z,"A petition has been secretly circulated among the stockholders of the Illinois Central Railroad during the past few weeks urging them to combine against the present management of the company and place new officers in control. The petition makes some very serious charges, and bluntly declares that the company is practically on the verge of ruin through the mismanagement of its officers."
1890-09-06T00:00:00Z,"The sub-committee of the Reform Club gave an informal luncheon yesterday afternoon in the club rooms to Congressmen Bynum of Indiana, Springer of Illinois, and Whiting of Michigan, and ex-Congressman Yeaman of Kentucky. All these gentlemen have been recently engaged in joint debate with Republican speakers at various fairs throughout the State of New-York."
1890-09-06T00:00:00Z,"CHICAGO, Sept. 5. -- The commission trade was discussing the Provision situation this morning an hour before the opening. Wheat, Corn, and everything else became a secondary consideration. The announcement of the failure of Sawyer, Wallace Co. late Thursday afternoon, as everybody understood, imperiled the whole market. As to what would become of the great big Pork holding, variously estimated at from 50,000 to 100,000 barrels, nobody could guess."
1890-09-06T00:00:00Z,"Gen. Antonio Maceo, who was one of the leaders in the last Cuban insurrection, arrived with his family by the steamer Cienfuegos yesterday. He has been exiled by the new Governor General of Cuba, Gen. Palaviaja, who assumed the government of the island on Aug. 25."
1890-09-06T00:00:00Z,"The political issue in this country, as it comes to be more and more clearly defined, is seen to be one that has not been raised before with anything like the same definiteness, even by the nomination of BLAINE. It is in fact the question whether under a free Government and with universal suffrage a party can keep itself in power without regard to public opinion."
1890-09-06T00:00:00Z,"The conference committee of the wholesale and retail liquor dealers which began the task of calling Tammany to account about a month ago for alleged excise annoyances seems to have scored its first success, for at yesterday's meeting there was manifested a studious desire to avoid all disparaging allusions to the Mayor and his official subordinates."
1890-09-06T00:00:00Z,"CINCINNATI, Sept. 5. -- The Duckworth Club of this city will expel Gov. Campbell, who is one of its leading members, for appointing Republicans to office. Ex-Deputy Sheriff Frank J. Kelly states that he will file charges against the Governor at the next meeting of the club."
1890-09-06T00:00:00Z,"HUNTINGDON, West Va., Sept. 5. -- The famous Hatfield-McCoy feud is at an end. After participating in the butchery of all the men they could kill, after living as outlaws with prices on their heads, defying arrest and courting meetings with their enemies, after seeing their young men shot down, their old ones murdered, with no good accomplished, they have at last agreed, on either side, to let the matter rest."
1890-09-06T00:00:00Z,The old-fashioned protectionist argument for duties on imports was that the domestic manufactures thus encouraged made a profitable market for farm products. That was the farmer's share in the general benefit. And there is no doubt that in many States the share was large and the farmers were reasonably prosperous.
1890-09-07T00:00:00Z,"I noticed in your last Sunday's issue a communication headed, ""A Republican's Warning."" I shall be obliged if you will find room for another of the same character."
1890-09-07T00:00:00Z,"THE CLIMATE OF CAPRI. -- The climate of Capri in Spring, Autumn, and in Summer -- when the sirocco does not blow -- is perfect; so perfect that one might almost be forgiven for asking of Heaven nothing more than to idle away one's life in a sweet daydream. When the sirocco blows most people feel cross and ""limp,"" with an unpleasant sensation of stickiness all over the body."
1890-09-07T00:00:00Z,"Manager A.M. Palmer, with his wife and family, arrived last evening from Liverpool on the Etruria. He brought much interesting news of dramatic matters and confirmed many rumors that have been flying about recently with more or less apparent basis in fact."
1890-09-07T00:00:00Z,"SEABRIGHT, N.J., Sept. 6. -- Under the auspices of Mrs. Fitzgerald, wife of Gen. Fitzgerald, the prettiest floral parade of the season took place here this afternoon.

1890-09-07T00:00:00Z,"RICHFIELD, N.Y., Sept. 6. -- It has long been the desire of Richfield bonifaces to prolong the season by keeping the crowd well into September, and this year the effort seems to be successful. No September ever opened with more delightful weather, better sport, or larger numbers to enjoy the beauties of Richfield's banner month."
1890-09-07T00:00:00Z,"NEWPORT, R.I. Sept. 6 -- The last week of August was thought to be a very full and lively one socially, but the first week of September has not been much behind it. The continuation of the lawn tennis tournament and several private balls have kept up the interest and life, while there seems to be as yet no diminution whatever in the number of smaller entertainments."
1890-09-07T00:00:00Z,"LITERARY INCOMES. -- Are there fifty novelists in England just now who make a thousand a year or more by their profession? The statement has been made by one good authority and disputed by another. True or inacurate as the statement may be, it is difficult to understand the interest with which many people discuss literary incomes."

1890-09-07T00:00:00Z,"THE GREEK SHRINES. -- The temple of Athena, though the most important of the shrines of the Acropolis in the sixth century, certainly did not stand alone. For we have recovered the whole or part of five or six other pediments of small size and executed in rough local stone. These compositions now form one of the most conspicuous features of the Acropolis Museum and arouse the wonder far more than the admiration of visitors."
1890-09-07T00:00:00Z,"The six stories included in this volume appeared first in Harper's Weekly, and from ""The Courting of Dinah Shadd"" to ""The Incarnation of Krishna Mulvaney"" they all seized on the attention of readers. Rudyard Kipling writes for men, not women, and for full-grown men at that. Occasionally an Indian native is his theme, but generally it is Tommy Atkins he delights in presenting."
1890-09-07T00:00:00Z,"Speaking of the wife murderer Smith's case yesterday led Warden Berlin of the Allegheny County Jail to indulge in a few reminiscence, relative to feigned insanity. The Warden is evidently of the opinion that Smith is sane, and does not think the prisoner is even feigning insanity.

1890-09-07T00:00:00Z,"CHARLES I. AS AN ART EXPERT. -- If the statements of several independent contemporaries may be trusted, Charles was not only an expert critic of painting, but handled the brush with no mean skill. ""He had so excellent a fancy,"" says one writer, ""that he would supply the defect of art in the workman, and suddenly draw those lines, give those airs and lights, which experience and practice had not taught the painter."""
1890-09-07T00:00:00Z,"Sir Rowland Hill's great discovery of the value of simplicity in vast undertakings seems to have produced little impression as yet upon those who have the management of our railways. In Paris the Directors of the queer little line which runs right round the city inside the fortifications, and forms a means of communication between all the great termini, have just made a considerable advance in the right direction."
1890-09-07T00:00:00Z,"According to the annals of Gravesend in particular and of Long Island in general, when Merry Monarch John Y. McKane had digested the new ballot law he called his Court together and most emphatically announced that such an interference with his kingly rights was more than he, the King of the Sands, could or would put up with."
1890-09-07T00:00:00Z,"Mark Twain does not bear with equanimity the discomfiture of a legal overthrow. In the above recently-published interview he finds it amusing and becoming to scoff at Justice Daly, who pronounced the decree against him in ""The Prince and Pauper"" suit, and to liken my action in the controversy to that of a ""dog in the manger."""
1890-09-07T00:00:00Z,"RIO DE JANEIRO, Aug. 10. -- It is apparent to every one who takes the trouble to study Argentine conditions that the Government adventured upon too large a scale of expenditures prior to 1885, and, moreover, that its currency was not bottomed upon a sound basis. After 1885 the road followed was one that led straightway to bankruptcy."
1890-09-07T00:00:00Z,"CANON CITY, Col., Sept. 6. -- All of the men in the wreck were Italian laborers just shipped here from New-York, and it is impossible to learn the names of the dead and injured. The wounded have been taken to the Rio Grande Hospital, at Salida. Two of them will not live until morning."
1890-09-07T00:00:00Z,"WATTEAU. -- We all know Watteau's pictures. There may be no work of his in our national gallery, but in spite of that this strange artist has impressed his memory and his times on most of the European nations. Many persons are quite ignorant of his story, they even hardly know that he was called ""Le Peintre des fetes galantes,"" but they know these same fetes from his pictures or by engravings from them."
1890-09-07T00:00:00Z,Five ocean racers left their North River piers yesterday afternoon for England and the Continent. The few cabin passengers they carried show that the rush of European travel has practically ended. Following is a complete list of the travelers:
1890-09-07T00:00:00Z,"To the arrangement with Germany is now added an arrangement with France, as to the respective spheres of influence of that country and ourselves in Africa. According to some critics on the other side of the Channel, the bargain is altogether to our advantage. It is the triumph of British rapacity. According to censors at home, Lord Salisbury has been outwitted by M. Ribot and M. Waddington."

1890-09-07T00:00:00Z,"FORMER MANNERS. -- The tea parties which play so important a part in all old novels came into vogue in 1720. At these festivities everything and everybody was pulled to pieces in a thoroughly satisfactory way. ""Religion,"" (mark that, those who think religious discussions a modern growth,) ""religion, morals, love, friendship, good manners, dress,"" all had their turn."
1890-09-07T00:00:00Z,"While the polar expedition of Dr. NANSEN, now in preparation, has excited gen eral interest, Denmark is emulating her northern neighbor by appropriating nearly as much money for an expedition to explore unknown portions of Greenland. If the latter may seem to be the less adventurous quest, in one sense, it is perhaps quite as promising in the matter of scientific results."
1890-09-07T00:00:00Z,"BALTIMORE, Sept. 6. -- The Democratic Convention of the First Congressional District will meet at Ocean City next Thursday. It was in session this week at Centreville, but after balloting for six men on 177 ballots without result it adjourned for a rest of a few days. The contest will be resumed with increased energy, and all the candidates announce that they expect to win."
1890-09-07T00:00:00Z,"Mr. Vincent's volume is opportune, inasmuch as it gives an insight into that country south of Mexico where revolutions are so frequent. The traveler tells of a fairly-extended trip made by him in 1887, when, landing at Aspinwall, he crossed the isthmus of Panama and made the long sea stretch from Panama to Puenta Arenas, the Pacific seaport of Costa Rica."
1890-09-07T00:00:00Z,"THE REPUBLIC NEEDS NO ""SAVANTS."" -- A letter written by Lavoldier on the eve of his execution to his cousin, Augez de Villers, is his final recorded utterance:"

Platt's interests in the South would result in the ultimate defeat of the bill or any similar measure. Platt is President of the Tennessee Coal, Iron and Railroad Company, and that company's most valuable property is in and around this city."
1890-09-07T00:00:00Z,"Master Ghulka, the boy pianist, has made hosts of little friends at the children's matinees each Wednesday and Saturday at the Eden Musee.

1890-09-07T00:00:00Z,"CHICAGO, Sept. 6. -- The financial returns on-the investment in grand opera at the new Alhambra, at the corner of State Street and Archer Avenue, have not been great. Miss Juch and her fellow-artists have demonstrated their ability to sing delightfully a certain class of operas, but the new theatre has proved that it is not in a locality where grand opera thrives."
1890-09-07T00:00:00Z,"LAKE GEORGE, N.Y., Sept. 6. -- That the regular Lake George season is on the wane is evident from the amount of baggage to be found at the station prior to the departure of each train.

1890-09-07T00:00:00Z,"CRIME IN FICTION. -- It is asserted, and we daresay, with some truth, that novels' like Ainsworth's ""Jack Sheppard,"" and illustrated sheets like the Police News, have largely recruited the ranks of the thieves and the burglars. There the seed had fallen in kindly soil prepared by circumstances and hereditary depravity."

1890-09-07T00:00:00Z,"THE BAMBOO. -- There are countries where it seems to supply almost every human requirement, and where the feathery masses of its foliage, drooping, like the weeping willow, over road and river and village, be-speak an ideal of life beyond the reach of less primitive communities. Here man is unspoiled by artificial wants, untouched by the march of thought or of science, and nature unsolicited supplies with lavish hand his simple needs."

1890-09-07T00:00:00Z,"The shedder crab is known to fishermen equally well as an excellent bait and a costly article of merchandise. The rest of mankind is not so well acquainted with him, yet he is a very interesting fellow. All kinds of fish show a high appreciation of his fine qualities, which goes a long way toward proving that fish know more than we are disposed to give them credit for."
1890-09-07T00:00:00Z,"A CRITICAL GENIUS. -- Among Rice's old acquaintances was a leader of the orchestra, one John C. Quite a musical genius was C., and a great character.

1890-09-07T00:00:00Z,"BANGOR, Me., Sept. 6. -- The best series of races ever held in Maine were closed to-day, a Maine-bred stallion lowering the world's record for a half-mile track. Nelson made two attempts to beat 2:15 1/2 the record of Jay-Eye-See on a half-mile track, and in the last attempt was successful. He had tried once before during the week, going in 2:15 3/4, having a jockey on a runner for company."
1890-09-07T00:00:00Z,"DEALING WITH DACOITS. -- For a long time no systematic method could be found for dealing with the dacoit gangs. When information concerning any gang could be obtained, or when news was brought of depredations committed, men were of course sent out in pursuit with as much secrecy as possible."
1890-09-07T00:00:00Z,The enthusiasm of collectors of rare postage stamps and the amount of money spent annually in the purchase of the little colored bits of paper will cause surprise when one remembers that stamps for postage first came into use in 1840. It seems impossible that the demand for rare stamps has become so great that men arm themselves like explorers and visit countries infested by highwaymen to secure specimens of the stamp-maker's art.
1890-09-07T00:00:00Z,"WASHINGTON, Sept. 6. --Under the agreement made a fortnight ago the Senate should have finished the tariff debate to-day and begun voting on the McKinley bill Monday.

1890-09-07T00:00:00Z,The newspapers constantly teem with denunciations of Quay and Quayism. It seems to me that this is unjust to as honest a man as there is in the Republican Party.
1890-09-07T00:00:00Z,"Cruel are the deceptions that await the most cautious who indulge in the pursuit of bric-a-brac. Their fifteenth-century armor turns out to have been manufactured recently on the banks of the Seine; the old master, which is their pride, has to bear the scoff of the connoisseur. Their Barye bronzes are spurious and their antique oaken cupboards from Chester prove to belong to one of the most flourishing modern industries of that little town."
1890-09-07T00:00:00Z,"WASHINGTON, Sept. 6. -- Mrs. Harrison's return to Washington on Wednesday was for the purpose of arranging certain important details now in progress in the interior of the White House.

1890-09-07T00:00:00Z,"There is method in the arbitrariness of the young German Emperor, and his mind does not seem wholly occupied by military matters. His latest ukase has in it a touch of humanity that may well explain his popularity with his people. He has found fresh work for the doctors at a time when doctors have generally not so much to do."

1890-09-07T00:00:00Z,"WASHINGTON, Sept. 6. -- Some men are born for trousers, others achieve trousers, and others have trousers thrust upon them. Who that ever saw President Arthur can forgot the beautiful folds of his trousers? Neither large, nor small, with no bagging at the knee, but falling gracefully upon his shoe they were indeed beautiful to behold. Such trousers were not simply due to the tailor's art."
1890-09-07T00:00:00Z,"WATER IN THE DESERT. -- All the southern slopes of the Atlas are singularly waterless, and the Metlili is no exception to the rule. Every drop for our use had to be brought up in barrels on mulcback. I wanted to send the barrels back so as to have a fresh supply the next day, so I poured the water into two of my canteen baskets, which are lined with water-proof canvas for the purpose."
1890-09-07T00:00:00Z,"BAR HARBOR, Me., Sept. 6. -- Scarcely a week in the whole season has been gayer than the one now closing. Boat and car loads of people have gone during the past few days, but that makes scarcely a break in the merry-go-round of society. No cottager has yet left, and while the cottagers stay they will enjoy themselves."
1890-09-07T00:00:00Z,"The poem of ""Curfew Must Not Ring To-night"" was suggested to me by the reading of a story called ""Love and Loyalty"" in April, 1867.

1890-09-09T00:00:00Z,"NEW-HAVEN, Conn., Sept. 8. -- Charles Rockwell, General Freight Agent of the New-York, New-Haven and Hartford Railroad, died at his home in Southport at noon to-day after an illness of three weeks.

1890-09-09T00:00:00Z,"It is hardly to be supposed that Mr. PLUMB really expected to carry his proposition to increase the tax on distilled spirits from 90 cents to $1.25 per gallon. Mr. DAWES showed the true party spirit when he said that he could not vote for such an amendment because he could not bring himself to declare, even by implication, that there would be a deficit under the Republican legislation."

Together they number 10,000 men, their treasuries are full, and they are more compactly organized than any other body of workmen in the country."
1890-09-09T00:00:00Z,"The city schools opened yesterday, and it is estimated by Superintendent Jasper that 150,000 pupils were in attendance. This estimate is made without reports. There were no pupils refused except in the primary department of Grammar School No. 57, which is at One Hundred and Fifteenth Street and Third Avenue. There 125 were refused because of lack of accommodation."
1890-09-09T00:00:00Z,"Chief Justice Richard L. Larremore of the Court of Common Pleas yesterday sent his resignation to Gov. Hill, to take effect Oct. 1. The Governor was informed of the fact by a telegram from Albany announcing that the resignation had been received there. Those of Justice Larremore's associates who were in town learned with considerable surprise that he had resigned, as they had received no intimation that he had ever contemplated such a step."
1890-09-09T00:00:00Z,"THE ALGONQUIN, SARANAC LAKE, N.Y., Sept. 8. -- Mayor Grant's prowess as a deer hunter is this week being put to the test.

1890-09-09T00:00:00Z,"For a Monday, usually an off day in racing, there was a big crowd at the Sheepshead Bay track yesterday, and there was some excellent sport, too. As four of the six favorites won their races, the ring, where ninety-nine bookmakers are doing business, was pretty hard hit."
1890-09-09T00:00:00Z,"CHICAGO, Sept. 8. -- Affairs in the Western Passenger Association have been exceedingly serious, and the association is in great danger of going to pieces. To-day Chairman J.F. Goddard called a meeting of General Managers of all lines in the association to meet Wednesday to see if something could not be done to check the widespread demoralization of passenger rates which now exists."
1890-09-09T00:00:00Z,"The surprisingly low speed made by the Charleston in her last voyage homeward from Honolulu was accounted for on examining her hull, which was found to be covered with weeds and barnacles. This growth had all occurred in about four months, and it was sufficient to reduce her speed several knots an hour in spite of a large consumption of coal."
1890-09-09T00:00:00Z,"POUGHKEEPSIE, N.Y., Sept. 8. -- The forty-ninth annual fair of the Dutchess County Agricultural Society will open at the Hudson River Driving Park to-morrow. The entries in every department are overflowing in numbers. A hundred or more stables are full."

Two engines and between forty and fifty cars were completely wrecked."
1890-09-10T00:00:00Z,"DOVER, Del., Sept. 9. -- The Republican State Convention to-day was chiefly conspicuous for a protracted fight raised over the party platform, which finally resulted in two sets of resolutions being presented to the convention, one by George V. Massey and the other by N.B. Smithers, who has written the platforms for the Republican Party of Delaware ever since 1856."
1890-09-10T00:00:00Z,"INDIANAPOLIS, Sept. 9. -- From the appearance of the hotels to-night it would seem that all the Republican politicians in Hoosierdom were in town. The politicians big and little are here, representing all factions of Republicanism, from the howling Greshamites of the Lower Wabash to the Robertson crowd from the northern borders."
1890-09-10T00:00:00Z,"The French exploring expedition in the Congo region, of whose return to Brazzaville the cable speaks, is one of three which had been planned to push French interests in that part of Africa. The other two go respectively from the Niger and from Algeria toward Lake Tohad. It daily becomes more evident that France has conducted both her diplomacy and her practical operations on the Dark Continent, of late, with great success."
1890-09-10T00:00:00Z,"WICHITA, Kan., Sept. 9. -- The result of the State Democratic and State Republican Resubmission Conventions to-day was a fusion ticket, the latter being allowed the Lieutenant Governor.

1890-09-10T00:00:00Z,"For the first time in three months the Kings County Republican General Committee met last evening in the Athenaeum, on Atlantic Avenue, Brooklyn, and the members by their action dispelled all idea of a settlement of the fight between the Woodruff and Baldwin forces.

At the time the accident occurred the Gossoon was five minutes in the lead, two-thirds the way home, and a sure winner barring accidents. In a light southwest wind the two racers were started from Halfway Rock for a ten-mile beat to windward."
1890-09-10T00:00:00Z,"The first practical application of the Saxton Ballot Reform Law was made in Far Rockaway yesterday during the election for President of the village, two Trustees, a Treasurer, Collector, and for four resolutions, one to raise $15,000 for a new Court House, another to raise $2,500 for lighting the village, the third for an appropriation of $1,200 for the Police Department, and the fourth for $1,200 for the ordinary expenses of the village."
1890-09-10T00:00:00Z,The discovery that the tickets circulated by Secretary of State Kelsey for the vote on the proposed amendment to the State Constitution name the wrong section of the Constitution has brought a legislative error to the surface that may defeat the special election.

1890-09-10T00:00:00Z,Major MCKINLEY in his speech to the convention that renominated him for Congress laid a great deal of stress on the bad feeling awakened in Europe by the passage of his first bill and the prospect of the second. He was greatly delighted with this bad feeling. He cited it as a sort of proof of patriotism in himself and the other friends of the bill.
1890-09-10T00:00:00Z,At first sight it seems odd that the Board of Health should be the first official body to protest against the official enumeration of the people of this city. On reflection this is seen to be entirely natural. The Board of Health is the official body that has the most direct and urgent interest in securing an accurate count of the inhabitants.
1890-09-10T00:00:00Z,"WASHINGTON, Sept. 9. -- Deputy Commissioner Charles T. Lincoln was the first witness to-day before the special House committee investigating the charges against Commissioner Raum. He said that his assistants were unanimous in the opinion that the complete files system would not work well.

1890-09-10T00:00:00Z,"COLUMBUS, S.C., Sept. 9. -- The State Democrat Convention meets in this city to-morrow to nominate a State ticket from Governor down. The Straightouts have given up all hope of preventing the nomination of Capt. B.R. Tillman for Governor.

1890-09-10T00:00:00Z,"The Democrats of Connecticut might as well cease talking about nominating ex-Gov. Thomas M. Waller for Governor this Fall. Mr. Waller has weighed the question carefully and decided that under no consideration will he allow his name to be used in connection with the nomination at the coming convention. He is now practicing law in this city, and feels that it would be folly, from a business point of view, to sever his present connections."
1890-09-10T00:00:00Z,"A peculiarity of the recent debates in Congress on the chances of a Treasury deficit is their revelation of the steady increase of applications for pensions reported under the new disability law. Every week shows an addition of many thousands. In the address of Gen. ALGER to the Grand Army veterans at Boston he announced the aggregate of applications at that time as somewhat exceeding 300,000."
1890-09-10T00:00:00Z,"During the present month in this and other cities and in all the large towns the churches of the different denominations will begin their working season, which usually lasts from October to April or a little longer. The half year devoted to the Summer resorts effectually limits the active life of our parishes to six or eight months, and this fact to-day colors and tones and controls the Christian forces of the country."
1890-09-10T00:00:00Z,"ROCK ISLAND, Ill., Sept. 9. -- Francis Murphy, the blue-ribbon advocate of temperance, and Mrs. Rebecca Fisher, President of the Council Bluffs Woman's Christian Temperance Union, were married in this city to-night at the residence of the bride's father, Mr. J.R.

It went to one of Peek Martin's yards."
1890-09-10T00:00:00Z,"MOBILE, Ala., Sept. 9. -- Much ill feeling exists between the whites and blacks in Dallas County, Ala., the heart of what is known as the ""The Black Belt,"" where the negroes outnumber the whites ten to one and where any disagreement is likely to lead to violence. At Orrville there is now great excitement, caused by the killing of a negro by J.W. Shores, a white man."
1890-09-10T00:00:00Z,"The benevolent POWDERLY will grieve to remark that the window-glass workers have turned against him. There are 10,000 of them, and they are important enough to have contributed $100,000 to the Knights during the Reading strike. They have now resolved to withdraw from the order if POWDERLY is re-elected."
1890-09-10T00:00:00Z,"The Senate finally reached a vote yesterday on the reciprocity amendment of the Finance Committee and adopted it in all its naked deformity by a strict party vote, with the exception of Messrs. EVARTS and EDMUNDS, who voted against it. It is quite impossible to say what its fate will be in conference committee, whither it and all the other changes in the bill will now be transferred."
1890-09-10T00:00:00Z,"If some wealthy Democrat would establish and generously endow a School of Political Tactics he would confer a priceless blessing on his party. The party has principles enough -- four or five hundred, probably -- and the one principle of tariff reform is a sufficient capital. Its greatest need is of men who have something more than an elementary knowledge of the business of ""running a campaign"""

The Belles' Stakes, for two-year-old fillies, which has nineteen starters named, will bring together the best of the young ladies, and these should make a very lively race."
1890-09-10T00:00:00Z,"Yesterday was the first day of the Grand Circuit meeting at Fleetwood. About 2,000 people were present, including prominent horsemen from all parts of the State and some from a distance. Among them were Major Batchelor of South Carolina, owner of Pamlico; D.J.

1890-09-10T00:00:00Z,"Many years ago a very wise man remarked that ""a fool and his money are soon parted."" If that wise man had been in the habit of going to the races, he would probably have remarked ""a fool and his party are soon moneyed."" He would certainly have said so if he had been at the Coney Island Jockey Club's race track yesterday and had a seat in the press stand."

1890-09-10T00:00:00Z,"CHICAGO, Sept. 9. -- There is no eel grass in that part of the Illinois and Michigan Canal between Chicago and Joliet. This is owing to a peculiar circumstance. Prior to 1871 there was somevegetation between the canal banks, but at that time the sewage of this city was turned into the canal, and it made the water so alkaline that there is not now a living thing in it except bacteria."
1890-09-10T00:00:00Z,"DETROIT, Mich., Sept. 9. -- The Democratic State Convention will meet in Grand Rapids tomorrow, to nominate a full State ticket, and most of the delegates are already on the ground. There is an unusual lack of concentration upon even the two or three leading candidates, which does not augur the best results. Personal and factional interests are also visible that should be held sternly in abeyance."
1890-09-10T00:00:00Z,""" There can be no doubt that the tariff-reform idea is growing rapidly in Kansas and other Western States,"" said Mr. L.E. Irwin of Kansas City, Mo., yesterday.

White's address on municipal reform, delivered at the Social Science Congres in Saratoga, the Christian Inquirer says: ""We were glad to hear him, in closing his address, take ground against party nominations.

Mr. Richardson was chosen temporary Chairman."
1890-09-11T00:00:00Z,"The arrangement made by the Navy Department for the purchase of the right to manufacture the Whitehead torpedo in this country seems to have created some surprise.

1890-09-11T00:00:00Z,"Trains from the Sheepshead Bay track yesterday brought home a lot of woe-begone, poverty-stricken racegoers. The weather was chilly and damp and not what any one could be coerced into calling comfortable.

1890-09-11T00:00:00Z,"Our readers are aware that we entirely disapprove of the form in which the Senate has cast its proposition for reciprocity. It is quite indefensible to put such discretion in the hands of the President, not, as some of his friends and those of the reciprocity amendment seem inclined to interpret the objection -- because he may abuse it -- but because he cannot use it, however honestly, without doing great mischief."

The oldest inhabitant and the man who used to know the inhabitant who was older deny that it ever rained more in four days than it has in the last four, but that is because their memories are short. There is a great deal of hurry, bustle, and confusion about the station these wet mornings."

1890-09-14T00:00:00Z,"LENOX, Mass., Sept. 13. -- There has been a great number of social events the past week.

1890-09-14T00:00:00Z,"MEAD. -- Mead is, by some of the old writers, spelled meath, and is supposed to be the same as metheglin. The Anglo-Saxon ""Medo,"" no doubt, is our mead, which also appears in Danish as meede, in Swedish as mjoed, and in German as met. The word is believed by some philologists to be of Polish origin, because in Poland is found a species of honey called miod."

1890-09-14T00:00:00Z,"There was a large crowd at Sheepshead Bay yesterday, in spite of the poor condition of the weather.

The earliest attempt to regulate British weights and measures appears to have been suggested by this example."
1890-09-14T00:00:00Z,"GETTING EVEN. -- Not long ago, in the Peshawur district, a man went so very far to the bad as to shoot a Mullah. It might have been an accident, or he mistook his man, or pure villainy; anyhow the Mullah died, and, like many another outlaw, the murderer had to fly over the border. First he tried Buneyr, but the news had preceded him, and he was refused shelter."
1890-09-14T00:00:00Z,"GAUTIER AND HEINE. -- If one were to seek about for any other great writer with whom to compare Theophile Gautier, one might do worse than fix upon Heine, with whose passionate poetry, biting wit, and ardent love of the beautiful for its own sake Gautier's work had much in common.

1890-09-14T00:00:00Z,"SEEKING THE WATER. -- Frogs and toads develop from tadpoles, which in all essentials are true gill-breathing fish. It is therefore obvious that they cannot lay their eggs on dry land, where the tadpoles would be unable to find anything to breathe; so that even the driest and most tree-haunting toads must needs repair to the water once a year to deposit their spawn in its native surroundings."
1890-09-14T00:00:00Z,"The annual meeting of the stockholders of the Casino was held yesterday and resulted in an emphatic victory for the Aronsons.

Here is a man whose profession it is to deal with such problems.

1890-09-14T00:00:00Z,"WASHINGTON, Sept. 13. -- It is conceded among leading Iowans here that the Eleventh Congressional District, now represented by I.S. Struble, is more than doubtful.

1890-09-14T00:00:00Z,"We have had experience here in New-York of the fact that a longshoremen's strike is particularly difficult to deal with. The difficulty arises from the ignorance of the strikers, their inability to understand their own interests, and the violent disposition that accompanies ignorance. Such a strike is tolerably certain to become a riot at a very early stage of its existence."

For this reason on wet and foggy days the window of the room in which the piano stands must not be left open without the instrument being covered up."

1890-09-14T00:00:00Z,"PARIS, Sept. 4. -- This is the supposed season of transition, and, as yet, no one appears to know authoritatively what will come forth from the domain of fashion.
