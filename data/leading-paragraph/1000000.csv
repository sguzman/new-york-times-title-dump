1901-10-26T00:00:00Z,"LONDON, Oct. 10 -- ""Kim"" has been criticised by nearly all the important papers, and the general verdict is that it is by far the best work that Mr. Kipting has done. There are, of course, dissentient voices. The Daily Chronicle ""slated"" the book on the morning of its publication, but the obvious effort of the critics to find every possible fault with ""Kim"" somewhat spoiled the intended effect of the article."

1901-10-26T00:00:00Z,"A good many stocks were traded in yesterday in the outside market, but only three or four issues showed much activity. In most of the issues sales were limited to a few hundred shares and in some to a single transaction. In case of the few stocks which were active much irregularity showed in prices."
1901-10-26T00:00:00Z,"PHILADELPHIA, Oct. 25 -- Reading was the feature in the Philadelphia market to-day, about 25,000 shares being taken for New York account. A slight difference in the range of price between the two centres afforded a good opportunity for arbitrage dealings.

1901-10-26T00:00:00Z,"There is something about Mrs. Barr which has always reminded us of Mrs. Oliphant. Long depending upon both for good work, the reading public formed the habit of almost passively accepting from their prolific and capable pens books which would have been received with applause had they come from less well-known writers."
1901-10-26T00:00:00Z,"Perhaps the most remarkable thing about the monthly reports of Major and Surgeon W.C. GORGAS, the Chief Sanitary Officer of Havana, is the length of time during which each of them has made a finer showing than any of its predecessors and so established a new ""record"" for the city."
1901-10-26T00:00:00Z,"Edward M. Shepard did some hard campaigning yesterday. He was jostled and pushed by a most enthusiastic crowd, and he took his treatment in such a happy way and entered so heartily into the spirit of the occasion that he won renewed applause."
1901-10-26T00:00:00Z,"If Marquis ITO were ten years younger we have little doubt that he would have been able to make his reply, to the representative Americans who greeted him on Thursday evening, in their own language. That would have been a considerable advantage all around. But even across the fog of an interpretation we are able to catch some outline of his opinions."
1901-10-26T00:00:00Z,"It is of the very essence of duty in this campaign to be all the time mindful of the unmistakable relations of the Tammany nominee to his nominators. Even if he have the will and the power to fulfill as Mayor all that he promises as candidate, his election would bring only a temporary assuagement of the evils of Tammany rule, only a brief respite from the public shames and crimes it fosters."
1901-10-26T00:00:00Z,"CITY OF MEXICO, Oct. 25 -- The discussions of the Pan-American Congress are assuming a character which displeases those who are hoping for the success of the gathering.

1901-10-26T00:00:00Z,"No one can doubt that the author of ""Colonial Fights and Fighters"" knows how to paint war pictures. His strokes are fresh, strong, rapid, with masses of color concentrated on exactly the right spot; battle scenes, vivid and dramatic, have all the confusion, movement, brutality, and ferocity of reality."
1901-10-26T00:00:00Z,"BENEDICT ARNOLD the traitor alone is remembered, Benedict Arnold the patriot and fine soldier having been forgotten. Arnold had been among the very first who offered a sword to the patriot cause. His career in the Revolution thenceforth, until the Autumn of 1780, was not only honorable, but distinguished."
1901-10-26T00:00:00Z,"MANILA, Oct. 25 -- The people of the Island of Samar have been notified to concentrate in the towns, otherwise they will be considered public enemies and outlaws, and will be treated accordingly.

1901-10-26T00:00:00Z,"Let us all pause in the strenuous work of fighting Mr. SHEPARD'S candidacy to approve and applaud his high-minded and generous tribute to some of the prominent men who are opposing him, placing them far above himself in respect to public service wherein his own desert is conspicuous and distinguished."

1901-10-26T00:00:00Z,"The movement of prices in the stock market yesterday reflected nothing more nor less than the operations of professionals and traders, and hence it was that, as on the day previous, marked irregularity appeared, some issues declining while others advanced. It was a market, in short, so altogether irregular that even shrewd traders who ventured in found themselves whipsawed."
1901-10-26T00:00:00Z,"To The New York Times Saturday Review: Mr. Stone forgets that in the aristocratic days of our ancestors -- a period when European morals were at their worst -- the commonest weakness of man was held in little horror.

1901-10-26T00:00:00Z,"This is another of Mr. Brooks's ""Fairport Stories,"" and full of the kind of reminiscence that appeals quite as much to the author's contemporaries as to his younger public. A New England boy of half a century ago had an environment not now to be found the length or breadth of the country, and a careful record of it is sure to have a certain value apart from its immediate interest."

1901-11-03T00:00:00Z,To the Editor of The New York Times: It would appear from the correspondence columns of your last Sunday's edition that the doctrinal position of the Episcopal Church is very uncertain.

1902-01-18T00:00:00Z,"Among the many books on scultpure in general, and on individual sculptors and on the exhaustively be written period of the Renaissance, this admirable volume has an individual and important place.

Many pools are at work, many clever devices are engaged to help along activity and make quotations strong; but in almost every quarter professionalism dominates."
1902-01-18T00:00:00Z,"HISTORIANS do not generally refer to the great Cardinal as a reformer, Scholar, courtier, statesman, soldier, diplomat, ecclesiastic, and patron of learning he certainly was. His efforts at reforming the church and the clergy, which he made at one time in his career, have been thrown into the shade by the splendor of his statecraft and the ambitious struggies and intrigues into which he plunged in the Court of Henry VIII."

Though it repre- sents that class of fiction known as de- tective stories, it bears no resemblance to the marvelous experiences of the peerless Sherlock Holmes.

Although the name of Mary Rich, Countess of Warwick, has come down faintly to the modern reader as that of a saintly recluse, little was written, and less was definitely known, about one of the most illuminating figures of the seventeenth century."
