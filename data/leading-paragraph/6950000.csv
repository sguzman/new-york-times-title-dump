He used hydrogen, which is lighter than air, to fill balloons -- not to heat air that had been fanned into balloons. The obituary also included erroneous information from the National Balloon Museum about two of Mr. Yost's balloon flights and the Navy research contract under which Mr. Yost worked, and it referred incorrectly to an associate, Don Piccard. The balloon Mr. Yost flew on Oct. 22, 1960, was not orange striped, it was all white. The Navy research contract that Mr. Yost worked on was held by a company that Mr. Yost and three colleagues from General Mills formed, Raven Industries -- not by General Mills, for which he went to work in 1949. Mr. Piccard, who flew with Mr. Yost on April 13, 1963, in the first hot-air balloon to cross the English Channel, was an employee of Raven Industries, not a partner in the company. On the balloon's descent during that crossing, it flew between newly erected power line poles, but did not narrowly miss power lines, because no lines had yet been strung on the poles."

Early in the Mets' 10-2 victory over the Oakland Athletics yesterday at Shea Stadium, José Reyes provided the 50,143 in attendance with something that probably none of them had seen before -- not an inside-the-park home run, but definitely an inside-the-park run home. Leading off the bottom of the first inning, Reyes, the Mets' swift shortstop, blooped a fly ball down the right-field line with enough hang time that, even though Oakland right fielder Jack Cust fielded it cleanly, Reyes was sprinting for a double. As he slid into second, Cust's throw went high and wide of shortstop Bobby Crosby and bounded across the outfield grass, then across the left-field foul line."

(mostly men, in those days) were thinking as they wandered far afield from the C.I.A.'s own charter. The 1947 founding document banned the C.I.A. from domestic spying.

One of the $64,000 questions from that time is whether these plots were known and authorized by various C.I.A. directors and others outside the agency, including the president. The Senate Select Committee to Study Governmental Operations with Respect to Intelligence Activities, better known as the Church Committee, spent months in 1975 and thousands of pages of testimony examining who knew what, and when. The committee found that the evidence suggested that higher-ups inside and outside the C.I.A .knew about the various assassination plots, but it was not conclusive."

It consists of responses by C.I.A. officials to a 1973 directive from the Director of Central Intelligence, James Schlesinger, to inform him of any activities that might violate the agency's charter. Many pages of the material made public today were excised by the agency. Many of the operations were disclosed in press reports in the mid-1970's beginning with a Dec. 22, 1974 story in The New York Times by Seymour M. Hersh. A commission appointed by President Gerald R. Ford and headed by his Vice President, Nelson A. Rockefeller, investigated the C.I.A. activities, as did a Senate committee, chaired by Senator Frank Church, Democrat of Idaho, and a House committee, chaired by Rep. Otis Pike, Democrat of New York.

2007-06-26T00:00:00Z,"In response to the death in March of a freshman who was binge drinking, Rider University said yesterday that it would take steps to curb campus drinking, including banning alcohol at fraternity parties. The freshman, Gary DeVercelly, 18, of Long Beach, Calif., had a blood alcohol content of .426 when he died after a night of drinking at the Phi Kappa Tau fraternity house.

The group’s recommendations, issued yesterday, include prohibiting alcohol at all social events in residence halls or fraternity houses. Sororities did not allow alcohol at parties even before Mr. DeVercelly’s death. The recommendations will go into full effect this fall. Students over 21 would still be allowed to drink alcohol in their rooms."

2007-06-26T00:00:00Z,"Hungary's central bank unexpectedly cut its benchmark interest rate, the European Union's highest, for the first time since 2005 after inflation slowed. Policy makers, led by the central bank's governor, Andras Simor, left, cut the two-week deposit rate a quarter-point, to 7.75 percent, after holding it since October. A leveling of wage growth also persuaded rate setters to lower borrowing costs, Mr. Simor said. Hungary's annual inflation rate has quadrupled in the last year as Prime Minister Ferenc Gyurcsany's government raised taxes and utility bills. Inflation excluding food and energy prices slowed for a second month in May, and an easing of pressures in the labor market reduced concern that prices would rise faster than the inflation target in the medium term."

I had witnessed Mr. Valenti in action, an in-the-flesh version of his autobiography, ''This Time, This Place: My Life in War, the White House, and Hollywood.'' He had exuded charm, established himself as everyone's pal with a few harmless anecdotes, taken the room by surprise with a passionate (and well-prepared) speech and rapidly moved on to his next battle, confident he'd get what he came for.

In a splintered 5-to-4 decision, Chief Justice John G.

The offer is meant to pressure David McDade, the Douglas County district attorney, into granting bond for Genarlow Wilson, who was ordered released from prison earlier this month after a Superior Court judge ruled that his sentence was a ''grave miscarriage of justice.'' That decision was appealed by the Georgia attorney general, which is keeping Mr. Wilson in prison until at least October when the State Supreme Court is set to hear arguments in his habeas corpus appeal.

2007-06-27T00:00:00Z,"''In Between Days,'' the sensitive, modest, thrillingly self-assured first feature by So Yong Kim, was one of the standouts of the 2006 Sundance Film Festival -- exactly the kind of thoughtful, independent work one hopes to find there and too rarely does. Its theatrical release today is an encouraging sign that there is still room, even in the midst of the summer glut, for a small, serious, unpretentious film. The subject -- a lonely young girl coming of age in a winter-bound North American city -- may seem conventional, but Ms. Kim nimbly avoids both narrative and stylistic clichés. There is nothing melodramatic about ''In Between Days,'' apart from the quiet strain of intensified feeling that the main character, a Korean immigrant named Aimie (Jiseon Kim), brings to her own experience. You get the sense that if she did not allow herself small episodes of strong, disproportionate emotion, Aimie would vanish into adolescent ennui."

2007-06-27T00:00:00Z,"A few months after announcing a $1.3 billion deal with France to rent the Louvre's name and gain access to its collections for a new museum in Abu Dhabi, that oil-rich emirate says it also wants to be the film and television capital of the Arab world. In October it will hold its first Middle East International Film Festival. And today it will announce an agreement with the New York Film Academy, a technical school, to open a branch in Abu Dhabi to train 100 students a year in television and film production. (Tuition at the Manhattan school is $34,000, but the emirate is likely to subsidize a portion of that.) Officials with the Abu Dhabi Authority for Culture and Heritage also said they were soliciting investment in the Persian Gulf region for a sizable fund, to be unveiled later this summer, that would offer financial incentives for film production in Abu Dhabi exceeding those offered by governments in Europe and elsewhere. Sami el-Masri, the authority's director of strategic planning, said the initiatives were aimed at erecting bridges across cultures in a region accustomed to destroying them: ''It's about looking for common denominators at a time when we only look at differences.'' Within the United Arab Emirates, Abu Dhabi has been in something of a footrace to announce cultural and tourist attractions, anticipating a future when the oil wells run dry. Neighboring Dubai is already building a $2.5 billion sports complex and a theme park based on Marvel Entertainment comics, and on Monday a unit of Viacom Inc. said it had signed a deal with a developer in the United Arab Emirates for a $2.5 billion theme park based on its library of films like ''Titanic.''"

Now a film distributor, Mr. Minford was living in Brussels and doing market research for American film studios when, in 1990, he moved to Warsaw, attracted by the business opportunities available in Poland's young free-market economy. In 1995, he was renting a house in Konstancin, a posh spa town outside Warsaw, when he spotted a desolate red-brick stable on the far outskirts of the resort."

A graduate of Grinnell College, he later received a Masters in international relations from Tufts' Fletcher School of Law and Diplomacy. This lead to an executive career in Time Inc., with an early focus on the international expansion of the company. After World War II, as head of Time's international operations, he was based in Paris where he managed the distribution of magazines in 40 countries. When he was seized and held captive by the Russians for four days, he emerged unharmed, except, as he later reported, ''for an overexposure to sauerkraut soup.'' At age 45 he was named managing director of Time Life International, and later he was a key officer of Fortune and Architectural Forum Back in the United Stated. He capped his magazine career as a group vice-president and secretary of Time, Inc., and he became the company's chief administrative officer. He was a member of the U.S Olympic Committee, and he was a consultant to the Commissioner of Baseball. Charles' business wit was legendary. He was a man of few words or many words depending on the occasion. For example, when he recommended to the Time Inc board that a small chain of weeklies be divested, he cogently summarized his judgement with these words: ''...(This company) is something of an appendage to the corporation, a vestigial tail that the dog wouldn't bother to wag if he could.'' He will be missed by his former colleagues for his wit and charm, but he will also be remembered for his brilliant hard-nosed leadership in the world-wide expansion of Time Inc.

Here, the wines themselves are exciting and the prices are more than fair. I've eaten there enjoyably several times, and here's a review from my colleague Frank Bruni. But while I've always liked the wine list, I think it has improved tremendously in the last few months."

Priscilla Hall in State Supreme Court by lawyers for the man, Cesar Rodriguez, 28, who has been charged with killing his stepdaughter, Nixzmary Brown, 7, in January 2006. In court, defense lawyers said that the motion was based on improper grand jury testimony by the victim&#8217;s 11-year-old sibling. Clerks for Justice Hall have denied repeated requests by reporters and a lawyer for The New York Times to view the document. The court attorney for Justice Hall, Machelle Sweeting, said she was reviewing the motion to determine whether portions that include or refer to grand jury testimony can be disclosed publicly. Prosecutors are scheduled to respond to the motion by July 6. Ms. Sweeting said she would determine whether to release the motion &#8220;most expeditiously as possible.&#8221;."

The song was a country No. 1, and this week Bon Jovi has its first No. 1 album in 19 years with its country-tinged new ''Lost Highway'' (Island Mercury Nashville), which sold 288,000 copies, according to Nielsen SoundScan. This week's next two top sellers are also new. The White Stripes' ''Icky Thump'' (Warner Brothers) reached No. 2 with 223,000 sales, and Brad Paisley's ''5th Gear'' (Arista Nashville) opened at No. 3 with 197,000. Last week's No. 1, Toby Keith's ''Big Dog Daddy'' (Show Dog Nashville), fell three spots, and the rest of the Top 10 is a reshuffling of recent hits: Paul McCartney (No. 5), Linkin Park (No. 6), Amy Winehouse (No. 7), Maroon 5 (No. 8), Fabolous (No. 9) and T-Pain (No. 10)."
2007-06-28T00:00:00Z,"Japan's industrial production unexpectedly dropped in May for a third month, the longest losing streak in almost two years. Production fell a seasonally adjusted 0.4 percent from a month earlier, the Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry said. Slower production diminishes hopes that economic growth will accelerate, in contrast with other reports released in the last week, which said that export growth almost doubled to 15.1 percent in May and retail sales gained for the first time in eight months. The Bank of Japan's governor, Toshihiko Fukui, said this month that the bank needed more evidence of the economy's strength before it raises the key interest rate from 0.5 percent."
2007-06-28T00:00:00Z,"Sales of alcohol on the trains and at the stations of the Long Island Rail Road and the Metro-North Railroad will continue. As expected, the board of the Metropolitan Transportation Authority declined yesterday to act on a proposal to ban alcoholic beverages on the commuter lines. A board committee that studied the issue said it could not find a correlation between alcohol sales and accidents or arrests involving drunken commuters. The authority's chairman, Peter S. Kalikow, said the board would not take any action on the proposal, made last year by Mitchell H. Pally, a board member from Long Island. Mr. Pally said he would continue to press for a ban. ''It is as if we were giving people a license to drink and drive, and that is unacceptable,'' he said. The railroads sell beer, wine and hard liquor in some trains and stations."
2007-06-28T00:00:00Z,"Alando Tucker was the Big Ten player of the year last season. He was an all-American. Some draft analysts project him to go to the Portland Trail Blazers. Not with the first pick -- as his credentials may suggest -- but with the 42nd pick. The rap on him is that he is a little small to play on the perimeter and does not shoot well. Thus, one of the top five players in college basketball seems likely to slip to the second round of the N.B.A. draft."

The detective, William Powell, cited his own notes describing the defendant, Craig Sobel, 39, who was charged last year with killing Dominick Masseria, 17, in 1989 on the steps of a church in Dyker Heights. Mr. Sobel's co-defendant is R. Lindley DeVecchio, a retired F.B.I. supervisor who has been charged with helping a prized informant commit murders on behalf of the mob. The judge overseeing the case, Justice Gustin L. Reichbach of State Supreme Court, has told prosecutors to show good cause for delaying prosecution of the case, and has already dismissed the charges against another man, John Sinagra, because of the delay. Prosecutors said they planned to call 11 witnesses to show that their evidence against Mr. DeVecchio had been properly obtained."

Born on February 15th, 1919 in Dayton, Paul graduated from Ohio State University with a degree in English Literature, served in the U.S. Army during WWII, and was an editor at Family Circle magazine before settling in to a long and successful career in the interior design industry. Beginning in 1958 in a brownstone on East 54th Street, Paul M. Jones, Inc. quickly became a fashionable and highly reputable resource for custom furniture, lighting, and accessories, assisted by his talented manufacturers and his loyal and supportive staff. Several years later, he became one of the very first trade showrooms in the then newly opened D&D building in 1961. Paul was known for his kind, gentle manner and his classic aesthetic, and his influence over the interior design market is still strongly recognized today. An avid reader, he tackled the NY Times crossword puzzle each morning, loved to stroll through Central Park, and lived for his summer holidays on the Isle of Capri. Paul is survived by his adored sister, Naomi Pittman. He is predeceased by his loving parents, Kenton and Anna Jones, dear sister, Ruth Miller, and beloved companions Philip Graf and Michael St. Clair.

On Sunday, as part of its third annual Afro-Punk festival of film, music and art, the Brooklyn Academy of Music will hold its first Afro-Punk block party, on a Fort Greene street that has been party-bereft for several years. “We really wanted to do something that was drawn from the community,” said Tamara McCaw, the community affairs and audience development manager for the academy, and a party organizer. The area “is really exploding,” she said. “There are these young mom-and-pop shops, and independent artists that live in the neighborhood that have this eclectic, funky edge to them.” In addition to family-friendly activities like sidewalk chalk drawing, face painting and T-shirt-making (“nothing is more punk rock than making your own T-shirts,” Ms. McCaw said), there will be fashion, jewelry and crafts for sale from more than two dozen local designers and artisans, including Adrienne Braxton, a baker and familiar neighborhood presence. (Her peach cobbler is probably the best street-corner dessert you’ll find.) The Dustbin Brothers and the D.J. Rich Medina, above, who’s worked with Fela Kuti, will spin tunes; No Surrender, a Brooklyn electro-hip-hop trio, will perform live. With any luck, they’ll drown out Mister Softee.

2007-06-29T00:00:00Z,"‘E PLURIBUS VENOM’ The paradox of well-heeled and wealthy art collectors fawning over rebellious street art is apparent everywhere in the art world. The graffiti artist known as Banksy is the toast of London, while Shepard Fairey is approaching cult status in Los Angeles for his posters and stickers of the face of the professional wrestler Andre the Giant with the word “obey” emblazoned across them. Mr. Fairey, 37, is now having his first major New York gallery exhibition, split between the Jonathan LeVine Gallery in Chelsea and a rented 6,600-square-foot warehouse exhibition space in Brooklyn for huge graffiti installations and murals. (Last week’s opening in Brooklyn was disrupted by a man trying to set off an incendiary device.) There are about 80 works between the two sites, together forming a comprehensive, 20-year survey of his artwork in various mediums: screen prints, stencils, stickers, album covers, collage, spray paint and more. Despite the range of mediums and styles, the imagery comes off as generic, combining decorative elements with political metaphors, like an image of a couple cuddling a bomb. (Right is “War for Sale.”) It’s Norman Rockwell crossed with the Dead Kennedys crossed with Communist-era propaganda. References to capitalism and war predominate, especially in the Chelsea show, where many works are neatly framed and ready for sale. It is tempting to see this stuff as just another luxury commodity.

2007-06-29T00:00:00Z,"SEUN KUTI & THE EGYPT 80 Competing with a famous father is tough enough, particularly when that father is Fela Anikulapo Kuti, the Nigerian titan of Afrobeat music who before his death from AIDS 10 years ago was one of the world’s most outrageous and electrifying musical figures. But when Seun Kuti (above), 24, Fela’s youngest son, began performing with his father’s band, the Egypt 80, he faced another formidable contender: his older half-brother Femi, who since the late ’80s has earned the respect of critics and Afrobeat fans — not a crowd easily impressed — for his saxophone populism. Luckily or unluckily for both, their father is truly inimitable, and in addition to his music — a deliriously warped reflection of James Brown’s funk — Fela left a tradition of fearless political dissidence. As Seun Kuti told The Observer, the British newspaper, three years ago when graduating from the Liverpool Institute for Performing Arts, his father’s music is a mission that lives on, with room for plenty of inheritors. “Things in Nigeria are even worse now,” he said, “and however hard it is to live up to his legacy, we have to carry on the fight for liberation and consciousness.” He brings his saxophone and his fight to S.O.B.’s on Sunday for his New York debut, and Femi Kuti and his band Positive Force appear at Central Park SummerStage on July 11.

2007-06-29T00:00:00Z,"‘LE DOULOS’ Jean-Pierre Melville’s brutal and subtly brilliant policier “Le Doulos” (shot in 1962, released in 1963) underscores why the French put the name to film noir. Based on the Pierre Lesou novel published by Gallimard in its celebrated Série Noire line, the film follows the parallel fates of two criminals — Jean-Paul Belmondo as Silien, Serge Reggiani as Maurice — bound by an almost mystical sense of masculine loyalty. Mr. Belmondo, below, who had recently worn a priest’s collar for Melville in “Léon Morin, Prêtre” (1961), enters “Le Doulos” in a more familiar Melvillian costume of a belted trench coat and fedora. A stated friend to Maurice as well as to the police, he first appears masked by an enveloping shadow, his silhouette framed in a doorway. He remains a darkly obscured figure for much of the rest of the story, a disturbing question mark for both Maurice (who believes in him) and the audience (who may not). The story eases and lurches, at times mechanistically, but what sticks and sticks hard is the way Melville fashions an entire world out of a threadbare room, a light swinging as if from a gallows, an ominous hat-check number, filigrees of cool jazz, an hourglass figure that melts into the image of a yapping dog and a masterly sense of cinematic space, exemplified by a lengthy interrogation scene. In “Le Doulos” the camera and the actors move in a silent conspiracy, revealing more about the true nature of a man far in advance of any line of dialogue. “Le Doulos” will be shown in a new 35-millimeter print, making it even easier to swoon into its darkness.

2007-06-29T00:00:00Z,"NIK BÄRTSCH’S RONIN “Zen-funk” is the term that Nik Bärtsch, a Swiss pianist, uses to describe the music of his five-piece band, Ronin, above. It’s an eminently printable phrase, but it cleanly misses the mark. True, Mr. Bärtsch composed the pieces for his recent album, “Stoa” (ECM), during a six-month residency in Japan. And, yes, at times those pieces do flirt with funkiness, though to draw allusions to James Brown, as some reviewers have, following Mr. Bärtsch’s lead, is a rather dubious stretch. The problem with the term is its connotation of mind-clearing tranquillity, when Ronin proposes something much more heady and premeditated. “Stoa,” for instance, relies on a precision movement of interlocking parts in a manner suggestive of a timepiece. (The Swiss and the Japanese have long had this expertise in common, after all.) Minimalism is a useful frame of reference, in the same way that it is for some hard-to-classify American bands. One track on the album, “Modul 35,” could be considered an acoustic corollary to the music of Battles; elsewhere there’s a vague resemblance to Tortoise. And videotape of Mr. Bärtsch and his colleagues performing “Modul 33” last fall (find it on YouTube, or at nikbaertsch.com) brings to mind the contemporary chamber group So Percussion. Next week’s showcase, which comes on the heels of festival appearances in Vancouver and Montreal, will mark Ronin’s United States debut. If all goes according to plan, Mr. Bärtsch will engage the drummer Kaspar Rast, the percussionist Andi Pupato, the bassist Björn Meyer and the clarinetist Stefan Haslebacher in a tricky yet ethereal interaction that’s more vivid in performance than on record. Maybe it will be meditative, and maybe it will get funky. Whatever the case, the crowd response will surely outdo the sound of one hand clapping. (Tuesday at 7:30 p.m"

On the first lap of the race Ernesto Viso went flying through the air and hit a concrete wall in the car upside down and then spun along the top of the wall for what seemed like forever, before the car landed hard on the other side of the wall and continued its tumble. The race was stopped for an hour as the driver was extracted from his car and sent to hospital. He is reported to be in stable condition, and basically unhurt. Like the accident in Canada, this was another of the kind where it seemed nearly impossible for the driver to have survived. Twice lucky. But it is impossible not to think of Alain Prost's words before the death of Ayrton Senna in Imola, after Rubens Barrichello had a serious accident on the Friday and Roland Ratzenberger was killed on the Saturday.

In an effort to turn a page on a reputation for entrenched government corruption, Nigeria's new president, Umaru Yar'Adua, has taken the unusual step of declaring his net worth as he begins his four-year term. In papers made public yesterday, Mr. Yar'Adua, a former chemistry teacher, said he had about $5 million in assets, most of it inherited from family members. Nigerian law requires that politicians disclose their assets to the government, but they are not required to make the information public. Mr. Yar'Adua said through a spokesman that he hoped to set an example of transparency in his administration."

Like its Biblical namesake, the place I call Hell is below ground level: you have to take three steps down from the sidewalk to enter.

I used to go to Hell on a regular basis. It's three blocks from my apartment. It's open from 5 p.m. to 3 a.m. And as you may have already surmised, it's a cigar bar operating under a grandfather clause that allows it to survive as one of the few remaining indoor retreats for aficionados of fine tobacco like me."

Rhetorical excess? If only. Overcrowding ruins meat, so the industry and federal government have developed standards to reduce stress on the animals, like requiring that they be able to turn freely. Thus, in general, on the way to the slaughterhouse, all livestock have a more comfortable ride than someone traveling, say, on the No. 4 train during rush hour.

2007-07-01T19:40:09Z,"As Formula One probably says goodbye to Magny-Cours, many people are leaving the track with a sense of relief that it is over. It has been a weekend of truly mixed emotions. The highs of great results from Robert Kubica, a return for Ferrari to top form, a Kimi Raikkonen lifting himself out of the doldrums to victory again. But on the other side, another horrendous reminder of how close the circuit is to racing calamity, with the terrible GP2 accident yesterday, from which, fortunately, the driver escaped with only bruising, and like Kubica before him, a small concussion. But the Formula One paddock learned this morning of tragic news. Three people were killed and two were seriously injured in a helicopter accident last night, as they flew from the circuit to a hotel in a nearby town. The injured people were connected to the Bridgestone tire manufacturer, but the identity of the victims has not yet been made public, although it involves at least two Formula One paddock people."

The homer moved Bonds five away from tying Hank Aaron’s record, but Miguel Montero hit a solo homer off Brad Hennessey (1-3) in the 10th for the Diamondbacks and San Francisco lost its third straight.“Everybody in that clubhouse knows he’s going to get a lot of attention reaching this milestone, as he should,” Giants Manger Bruce Bochy said. “It’s going to be a big moment in baseball. Right now, we’re all embarrassed with where we’re at, how we’re playing, things that are happening on the field.”Bonds, 42, led off the eighth with a solo shot off Liván Hernández to tie the score, 3-3. The homer came an inning after a fan hopped a fence and ran out to Bonds in left field. Bonds, a seven-time National League most valuable player, calmly greeted the man and walked him off and into the custody of security personnel.The fan came out over the fence along the left-field line and scurried to Bonds while Orlando Hudson was batting. Bonds did not flinch, putting his arm around the man and walking him off the field — and fans began chants of “Barry! Barry!”“He just wanted to shake my hand,” Bonds told MLB.com while quickly leaving the ballpark. “I told him to come with me so he didn’t get into any more trouble.”The Giants said the man, in the custody of the San Francisco police, would face charges of public drunkenness and interfering with a sporting event.

Born on February 15th, 1919 in Dayton, Paul graduated from Ohio State University with a degree in English Literature, served in the U.S. Army during WWII, and was an editor at Family Circle magazine before settling in to a long and successful career in the interior design industry. Beginning in 1958 in a brownstone on East 54th Street, Paul M. Jones, Inc. quickly became a fashionable and highly reputable resource for custom furniture, lighting, and accessories, assisted by his talented manufacturers and his loyal and supportive staff. Several years later, he became one of the very first trade showrooms in the then newly opened D&D building in 1961. Paul was known for his kind, gentle manner and his classic aesthetic, and his influence over the interior design market is still strongly recognized today. An avid reader, he tackled the NY Times crossword puzzle each morning, loved to stroll through Central Park, and lived for his summer holidays on the Isle of Capri. Paul is survived by his adored sister, Naomi Pittman.

Born into turbulent times in the then fledgling Sultanate of Nejd, battle by battle he witnessed the late Abdulaziz Ibn Saud's recapture of his forebears' former domains and their transformation into the planet's pivotal oil power, the eponymous Kingdom of Saudi Arabia. Sheikh Tuwayjiri's career, as a soldier, finance officer, Deputy Commander of the National Guard, Royal Counsellor, and roving Minister of State spanned seven decades and six reigns. An autodidact, a poet and mentor of poets, a bibliophile and patron of public libraries, literature and strategic studies, he published two dozen volumes of both prose and Arabic verse, gaining the sobriquet, ''The Ink of Arabia''.

But just as increased volatility in stocks can highlight opportunities for equity investors, the recent rockiness in the bond market can help clarify some decisions for bond holders. Since June, the yield on 10-year Treasury notes has seesawed between 4.87 percent and 5.32 percent -- and currently rests slightly above 5 percent. That is because the bond market can't seem to make up its mind whether the economy is truly growing stronger, or whether troubles in the subprime mortgage market, which have already begun to hurt some hedge funds, might spill over into the broader economy."

2007-07-01T00:00:00Z,"A HUNDRED years ago, an amusement park opened its gates on a site hugging the southeastern shore of Brooklyn. Tens of thousands of thrill seekers traveled to the resort, which featured the mandatory attractions of the day: a tunnel of love, a roller coaster, a dance pavilion, a circus. Given the proximity to the water, seafood was undoubtedly devoured, and sunburn could not have been further from the minds of the frolicking beachgoers. The name on the archway of this seaside theme park did not read Dreamland, Luna Park or even Steeplechase. Those signs were a few miles away in Coney Island. Instead, on May 30, 1907, New Yorkers reaching the end of the Canarsie line found themselves at the Golden City Amusement Park."

It was 8 a.m. on a recent Wednesday, and the market bulged with summer's bounty. ''Look at these interesting lettuces,'' Ms. Wollin said, examining tufts of speckled romaine, red oak leaf and butterhead lettuce with a gem dealer's eye. A farm manager pointed toward a bushel basket near the back of his booth."

Jorge Posada tends to agree with vox populi that this is not the most intense Yankees team he has ever seen. After the Yankees were victimized by a one-hitter from Chad Gaudin and Rich Harden yesterday in a 7-0 loss, Posada said firmly, ''It seems like, at times, we just go through the motions, and today is one of those cases.''"

2007-07-01T00:00:00Z,"New York's Senate leader, Joseph Bruno, must have figured he had an easy sell. The grandfatherly voice of the Republican Party in Albany told reporters recently that the real reason nothing was getting done was that Gov. Eliot Spitzer was obsessed with ''campaign finance reform.'' As Mr. Bruno put it, milking the laughs as expected, ''when you get up in the morning, do your children, your significant others ask you what's the status of campaign finance reform?'' No, of course they don't. So, rather than abandon the reform of the sleazy way campaigns are financed in New York, it is time to rename it. It is time to bring back the term ''sewer money.'' It is time for Albany's politicians to do something about the millions of dollars used by lobbyists to buy New York laws and New York lawmakers."

When implemented, the initiative will require Americans to present passports when crossing a United States border by land or sea.

2007-07-01T00:00:00Z,"THEY called it ''falling off the calendar.'' It was the kind of phrase that I came to understand while teaching a creative writing workshop at the Women's House of Detention on Rikers Island in the 1970s. I learned, for example, that a ''pelican'' lawyer -- black suit, large scoop beak dripping torts? -- was an appellate lawyer and that the dreaded syllable ''bing'' was the term for solitary confinement, calling up the sound of a slamming cell door. But falling off the calendar was the scarily evocative and precise metaphoric phrase for being forgotten by the court system. It meant that the person, unseen, unheard of and uncharged by any judge, had been abandoned behind bars for weeks, months, sometimes years."

Even though I had been prescribed opioid drugs before and shown no tendency to abuse or overuse, the doctors showered guilt and fear upon me until I gave into their safer preference. (Was that done for my benefit or their own?) Now I worry about liver damage from years of doctor-recommended high doses of acetaminophen. ''You may have to live with some pain,'' a doctor is quoted as saying. Some? I wonder how that doctor might feel if he had to live with a pain level of 5 or more every day for years and be told the pain was considered adequately managed."

Last week, in its 5-to-4 decision declaring that public schools in Louisville and Seattle can't take explicit account of race to achieve integration, the Supreme Court came down firmly on the side of colorblindness. Despite some important qualifications by Justice Anthony Kennedy, at least four conservative justices made clear that they believe that nearly all racial classifications are unconstitutional."

2007-07-01T00:00:00Z,"LAST Sunday morning, as the bells began to toll at Our Lady of La Salette, a Roman Catholic church in Bayside, Queens, a group of women could be seen hurrying into the tiny gray stone building. Following close behind came a procession led by Msgr. Jesé Milagrosa, their professorial-looking, 70-something pastor. Silently he walked down the church's tiny aisle, past its numerous statues, and ascended the altar steps. Then, with his back to the congregants, Monsignor Milagrosa began chanting -- in Latin. For Catholics worldwide, of course, the Mass has generally not been in Latin since the mid-1960s. But Our Lady of La Salette is a traditionalist church, one that has persisted without permission in the old ways even as Rome turned to vernacular languages for its rites."

2007-07-01T00:00:00Z,"It is perhaps a sign of how far sub-Saharan Africa still has to go that the most vigorous -- and certainly the best publicized -- debate about its economic future in recent years has been between two American economists based in New York. On one side of the argument is Jeffrey D. Sachs, the director of the Earth Institute at Columbia University and the author of ''The End of Poverty.'' On the other is William Easterly of New York University, whose ironically titled ''White Man's Burden'' lampoons Sachs as a modern version of a 19th-century utopian. There is indeed something faintly Victorian about Sachs's messianic yet parsimonious conviction that Africa can be saved with $75 billion a year in Western aid. Having spent so much of his energies in the 1990s extolling the virtues of the free market to any Eastern European government that would listen, Sachs now argues -- with equally unshakable conviction -- that the elimination of African poverty can be achieved through state planning. All governments need do is improve agricultural technology, provide antimalaria bed nets, treat diseases like hookworm and distribute antiretroviral treatments to the H.I.V.-infected."

He was 81. He was an innovator whose vision of a better world touched many lives. From launching a program of swimming lessons for children and starting a Friends Meeting on Shelter Island where he summered with his family for 50 years, to founding Westbury Friends School, establishing the Long Island Psychoanalytic Institute, and creating the Friends World College experiential education program with campuses on five continents, he brought his creative vision and his energy to hundreds of worthwhile projects, large and small, throughout his life. Born in 1925, he served proudly in the Ninth Infantry Division (Old Reliables) in World War II, where he was severely wounded. After the War, he graduated from Haverford College and Columbia College of Physicians and Surgeons, and had a distinguished career of more than 50 years as a psychiatrist and psychoanalyst in New York City and on Long Island. He followed the admonition of George Fox to ''walk cheerfully over the world, answering that of God in every one.''

Those melancholic strains can sometimes be sensed only on the edge of awareness, sounding like faint drones, heard only in moments of silence. But they are all the more distressing if the imminent demise seems a result of previous carelessness or willful neglect. That is how I often think of the Western art-music tradition -- the classical tradition -- these days, and though I once tended to whine about its problems with cranky optimism, now even a stunning performance seems like a spray of flowers at a funeral."

2007-07-03T21:04:37Z,"One of the pleasures and privileges of covering the haute couture collections is visiting the ateliers of the houses. If the heavy lifting is done in the unconscious-Lagerfeld always says his ideas come to him in dreams-then couture's lightness is finessed in the workrooms. Last Friday, just before the start of the fall couture collections, our photographer Ed Alcock dropped in at Dior, Chanel and Christian Lacroix, as seamstress and tailors were sewing clothes. Couture models are made in pieces, to accommodate the flow of deliveries from embroiderers and other specialists, and then everything is assembled. At Dior, the workers were awash in the bright tulle and silk that would become John Galliano's show for the 60th anniversary of the house. Pride? Yes. The people in the ateliers love a visitor to (slightly) gawp at the quality of their handwork. And they like a good joke.

A visionary leader and public health advocate, he was appointed by Gov. George Pataki to the New York State Public Health Council in 1996. He was known for his dedicated service on many influential boards and committees, including an appointment as Westchester County Commissioner of Hospitals from 1974-1978 and as New York City Commissioner of Health from 1972-1974. A member of the New York Medical College faculty since 1976, he was president and CEO from 1978 to 1981, and then professor and chairman of the Department of Community and Preventive Medicine until his death.

The Senegalese authorities confiscated more than 1.2 tons of cocaine on Sunday, in a record haul only four days after the seizure of almost the same amount of the drug near the seaside resort of Nianing, south of the capital, Dakar. The second seizure was made at a villa barely a mile from the boat where the first haul emerged."

2007-07-03T00:00:00Z,"Attorney General Anne Milgram yesterday selected John Vazquez, a former federal prosecutor in Newark, to be her top deputy as first assistant attorney general.

The two others are Stuart Rabner, who, after stints as chief counsel to Gov. Jon S. Corzine and attorney general, was sworn in last week as chief justice of the New Jersey Supreme Court, and Matthew Boxer, who is the director of the governor's Authorities Unit. Mr. Vazquez worked for Mr. Christie from 2001 to 2006, and had been in charge of health care fraud investigations.

2007-07-03T00:00:00Z,"LVMH Moët Hennessy Louis Vuitton, the luxury goods maker, can keep its Louis Vuitton flagship store in Paris open on Sundays because a visit to the outlet is a cultural experience, an appeals court ruled. The French Christian Labor Union sought to force the store to remain closed on Sundays in a fight against ''the trivialization of Sundays,'' and will appeal the decision, Joseph Thouvenel, its secretary general, said in a telephone interview. ''The sale of handbags and shoes has nothing to do with culture,'' Mr. Thouvenel said. Shops can obtain a waiver against closing on Sundays if they attach a ''cultural, recreational or sportive'' aspect to their business. Louis Vuitton's president, Yves Carcelle, above, said after the appeals court ruling that the store ''contributes by giving an image to France, to its excellence and its traditions.''"

It was not immediately clear whether the motive was political, but rebels have been fighting President Déby's government. Brahim Déby had been groomed to succeed his father, igniting a feud in the family, until his arrest for possession of a handgun after a brawl at a Paris discotheque last year for which he was given a six-month suspended prison sentence. Agence France-Presse reported that autopsy results showed that Mr. Déby had been asphyxiated, probably by the white powder that covered his body and most likely came from a fire extinguisher found near his body."

The concert, carried live on MTV and VH1 earlier in the day, helped propel NBC to a second-place finish in the ratings for the night over all. CBS ranked first in total viewers, as its reruns of ''Cold Case'' at 9 (8.4 million) and ''Without a Trace'' at 10 (7.5 million) drew the second- and third-largest audiences of the night. Fox finished on top in the demographic of adults 18 to 49.

2007-07-03T00:00:00Z,"To the Editor: Re ''Humans Have Spread Globally, and Evolved Locally'' (June 26): The recent advances in the field of evolutionary development are impressive, to be sure. But, as I'm sure many of us who were biology majors in the late '90s could tell you, the idea that a relatively small set of gene groups could exert such profound influence over cellular function, organismal structure and, hence, species diversity, isn't a particularly new one. We all learned about homeobox genes (and others) in our developmentary biology and molecular genetics classes. It's nice to hear that evolutionary biologists are finally starting to see the implications of this work, but let's not be overly dramatic in describing a recent ''revolution'' in thinking."

2007-07-03T00:00:00Z,"In all the talk about ethanol as an alternative fuel, most of the focus is on corn as the major source of supply. But corn and other grains are relatively costly to grow, from an energy standpoint. So scientists have looked to make what is called cellulosic ethanol, from woody plants like grasses and trees that are less energy-intensive. In these plants, the sugars are contained in cellulose, a major component of cell walls. Breaking down the cellulose (with enzymes) usually requires treating the plant matter first with acid or steam to free the cellulose from another pervasive compound, lignin."

The only problem, she quickly discovered, was that the avalanche of paperwork and other assignments meant she actually got to teach only sporadically."

2007-07-04T00:00:00Z,"Estonia reburied the remains of eight Soviet soldiers in a city military cemetery in the capital, Tallinn. The remains were exhumed from a central memorial site in April over Russian objections, setting off clashes between Russian-speaking Estonians and the police and later leading to suspicions that Russia had launched a retaliatory cyberwar against Estonia, briefly crippling computer networks in the country. The Kremlin regards the remains as a monument to Russian contributions in the defeat of Nazism. Estonia, which suffered decades of Soviet occupation, sought to decrease the memorial's prominence. Russian diplomats boycotted the reburial ceremony, saying they would hold their own at another time."

She apparently left her baby in the care of the 2-year-old, the police said, and when she returned several minutes later, she found him underwater.

Her mother, Agnes, known as Gammy, was a strong willed nanny to the wealthy, while raising three of her own children. Gammy famously entertained with her talent, brought from Ireland, of tealeaf reading. Patricia, born to poverty of the depression, made her way out of the Bronx, graduate Hunter College, and raise a family in Westport, Connecticut. But life is often what happens while one is busy making other plans. Born in a time of gaslight, she struggled to deal with an age of neon.

The Metropolitan Opera, its board members, management, staff, and artistic company, mourn the death of one of our greatest artists and truest friends. Chairman Emerita of our Board at the time of her death, Beverly Sills made her triumphant Met debut in the U.S. premiere of Rossini's ''The Siege of Corinth'' on April 7, 1975. She followed that success with performances of the title roles in ''La Traviata'' and ''Lucia di Lammermoor'', and two new production premieres: Massenet's ''Thais'' and Donizetti's ''Don Pasquale''. Her extraordinary accomplishments continued after she retired from singing, and we were fortunate to have her as a Managing Director of our Board beginning in 1991 and as Chairman from 2003 to 2005. Her amazing ability to fundraise and to act as an advocate for opera was born of her intense love for the art form. Her warm, unfailingly positive, and good-humored nature won her the love and admiration of all those who worked with her, whether on stage or off. We have lost one of the most significant figures in the history of opera in this country, and a wonderful human being. We extend our deepest sympathy to her family and innumerable friends.

She was a volunteer for the March of Dimes in 1971, when she was giving 100 performances a year as a reigning opera star, and rose to be Chairman of the Board from 1991 to 1994.

The Board and staff of Lincoln Center for the Performing Arts, Inc. are deeply saddened by the passing of Beverly Sills, legendary artist of extraordinary achievement in the world's musical arena, and in the history of Lincoln Center. One of the 20th century's greatest coloratura sopranos, Beverly had a longstanding association with Lincoln Center's New York City Opera and Metropolitan Opera. She was named General Director of New York City Opera after her retirement from the stage in 1980, and was responsible for launching the careers of many young singers. Chairman of Lincoln Center, Inc. from 1994-2002, she was the first woman and professional musician to serve in that position. Her tireless championship of the arts and irresistible personal warmth raised millions of dollars for Lincoln Center. She oversaw the beginning of ''Lincoln Center Festival'' and the ''American Songbook'' series during her tenure, as well as early plans for Lincoln Center's current redevelopment project. She subsequently served as Chairman of The Metropolitan Opera until 2005. Beverly was a major force in popularizing the performing arts in general and opera in particular through her numerous network television appearances, highlighted by many years as the host of ''Live From Lincoln Center.'' She was the recipient of countless honors in tribute to her work as a humanitarian and for her contributions to the arts. The loss of her voice leaves an unimaginable void, but Beverly's legacy will remain. We extend our heartfelt sympathies to her children Muffy and Peter Jr. and her extended family. Frank A. Bennack, Jr., Chairman Reynold Levy, President Bruce Crawford, Chairman Emeritus Gordon Davis, Former President Nathan Leventhal, President Emeritus Martin E. Segal, Chairman Emeritus George Weissman, Chairman Emeritus Lincoln Center for the Performing Arts, Inc. SILLS--Beverly. New York City Opera deeply mourns the passing of Beverly Sills, our beloved former prima donna, General Director, and board member, affiliated with our company for over 50 years. She was much more than a consummate artist, more than a gifted leader, more than a loyal friend to us; she was an inspiration, a force of nature. On October 29, 1955, Beverly Sills changed both City Opera's destiny and her own, debuting with the company as Rosalinda in Die Fledermaus. She swiftly rose within the ranks with vivid portrayals of Philine in Mignon (1956) and Violetta in Traviata (1957), achieving true stardom in 1958 with her unforgettable portrayal of the title role in The Ballad of Baby Doe, later recorded by Columbia Records. On September 27, 1966, during City Opera's first season at Lincoln Center, Sills' vocally and dramatically virtuosic performance as Cleopatra in the company's first-ever Handel opera, Giulio Cesare, catapulted Sills (and City Opera) to international renown. The company swiftly began mounting new productions especially for her, most notably Manon (1968) and a series of hand-picked bel canto operas. Sills' City Opera performances of Lucia di Lammermoor (1969), Elvira in I Puritani (1974), Marie in Daughter of the Regiment (1975), and the famous Donizetti Three Queens trilogy Roberto Devereux (1970), Maria Stuarda (1972), and Anna Bolena (1973) helped to spark a vast bel canto revival. Sills' supple, crystalline voice was soon in demand far beyond the bounds of Lincoln Center. A working mother blessed with a husband of means (the late journalist Peter Greenough) and a doting mom (the late Shirley Silverman), Sills took to the road with her family in tow. She made notable debuts at companies including San Diego Opera, Houston Grand Opera, Vienna State Opera, La Scala, Covent Garden, Teatro Coln in Buenos Aires, and the Metropolitan Opera, in historic 1975 performances of The Siege of Corinth. But she always returned home to City Opera. Sills' warm, ebullient personality led to a love affair with the television camera, not only in opera broadcasts but on variety and talk shows. As she clowned on TV with the likes of Miss Piggy, Carol Burnett, Danny Kaye, and Johnny Carson, she simultaneously served as a homegrown, one-woman ambassador for the arts and as radiant, smiling proof of operas passion, liveliness, and immediacy. At the age of 51, after more than four decades of public performances, and having sung 35 roles at City Opera (and 32 elsewhere), Beverly Sills retired from the stage with a starstudded televised Gala Concert at City Opera, on October 27, 1980. Without skipping a beat, she put her celebrity into service as a tireless advocate for such worthy causes as the March of Dimes and the National Multiple Sclerosis Society, and as an important leader in the performing arts. From 1979-1989, she served as City Opera's General Director, adding 42 new works to our repertory, shepherding us triumphantly through a disastrous warehouse fire, and mentoring countless young American singers. She served on City Opera's Board of Directors from 1989-1991, and remained an honorary board member until her death. Such services earned her the Presidential Medal of Freedom (1980) and the Kennedy Center Honors (1985). From 1994-2002, Sills continued to serve City Opera as Chairwoman of Lincoln Center, until becoming Chairwoman of the Metropolitan Opera Board of Directors (2002-2005). All the while, she remained a true friend and trusted advisor to City Opera and to many individuals within our company. We are comforted by her recorded legacy of 18 full-length studio opera recordings, and numerous live opera and solo albums, most of which have been reissued digitally to preserve her radiant artistry and joie de vivre for generations to come. On behalf of the Board of Directors and the entire company, we extend deepest sympathy to her family -daughter Meredith (''Muffy'') and her son Peter, Jr. (Bucky). In addition, there are generations of colleagues, scores of friends, and legions of fans who have made up her City Opera family. We will never be the same without her. She was a warm and wonderful friend. We loved her very much and will miss her terribly. Susan L. Baker, Chairman The New York City Opera Board of Directors SILLS--Beverly. The Board of Trustees of the Doctor Franklin Perkins School in Lancaster, MA, records with profound sadness the passing of Beverly Sills Greenough parent, supporter and benefactor of our programs for children and adults with special needs.

2007-07-04T00:00:00Z,"In 1648 the Peace of Westphalia brought the Thirty Years' War to an end. Although the Europeans didn't know it, of course, this devastating conflict would prove to be the last of the Wars of Religion that had been tearing the continent apart since the start of the Reformation in 1517. Europe was entering a new age. Despite the Renaissance, it was still a largely medieval world in its outlook, infrastructure and government in 1648. Europe was less wealthy and, in many ways, less economically advanced than other parts of the world, like Mughal India and China. By 1815, the year of the Battle of Waterloo, Europe was recognizably modern. It was also far in advance of the rest of the world economically, scientifically, technologically, politically and militarily."

Kadyrov, the new pro-Russian president of the southern region of Chechnya, said that the remains of more than 3,000 people in mass graves from the last Chechen war should be exhumed and identified. Almost all of Grozny, the capital, was leveled by the fighting, from 1999 to 2004, and thousands of people are missing and presumed dead. An effort to identify the dead could be a step toward determining the fates of many of them. The president's ombudsman, Nurdi Nukhazhiyev, said the government was aware of 1,138 bodies buried in mass graves in 2000 and 2001 and that more had been buried since. ''Among them certainly there are those on the list of missing and kidnapped people,'' he said, according to the government's press service."

We will always remember her infectious laughter, dazzling artistry and unstinting generosity of spirit, and extend our sympathy to her family. Winthrop Rutherfurd, Jr., Chairman Susan S. Braddock, President David A. Dik, Managing Director SILLS--Beverly. New York City Opera deeply mourns the passing of Beverly Sills, our beloved former prima donna, General Director, and board member, affiliated with our company for over 50 years. She was much more than a consummate artist, more than a gifted leader, more than a loyal friend to us; she was an inspiration, a force of nature. On October 29, 1955, Beverly Sills changed both City Opera's destiny and her own, debuting with the company as Rosalinda in Die Fledermaus. She swiftly rose within the ranks with vivid portrayals of Philine in Mignon (1956) and Violetta in Traviata (1957), achieving true stardom in 1958 with her unforgettable portrayal of the title role in The Ballad of Baby Doe, later recorded by Columbia Records. On September 27, 1966, during City Opera's first season at Lincoln Center, Sills' vocally and dramatically virtuosic performance as Cleopatra in the company's first-ever Handel opera, Giulio Cesare, catapulted Sills (and City Opera) to international renown. The company swiftly began mounting new productions especially for her, most notably Manon (1968) and a series of hand-picked bel canto operas. Sills' City Opera performances of Lucia di Lammermoor (1969), Elvira in I Puritani (1974), Marie in Daughter of the Regiment (1975), and the famous Donizetti Three Queens trilogy Roberto Devereux (1970), Maria Stuarda (1972), and Anna Bolena (1973) helped to spark a vast bel canto revival. Sills' supple, crystalline voice was soon in demand far beyond the bounds of Lincoln Center. A working mother blessed with a husband of means (the late journalist Peter Greenough) and a doting mom (the late Shirley Silverman), Sills took to the road with her family in tow. She made notable debuts at companies including San Diego Opera, Houston Grand Opera, Vienna State Opera, La Scala, Covent Garden, Teatro Coln in Buenos Aires, and the Metropolitan Opera, in historic 1975 performances of The Siege of Corinth. But she always returned home to City Opera. Sills' warm, ebullient personality led to a love affair with the television camera, not only in opera broadcasts but on variety and talk shows. As she clowned on TV with the likes of Miss Piggy, Carol Burnett, Danny Kaye, and Johnny Carson, she simultaneously served as a homegrown, one-woman ambassador for the arts and as radiant, smiling proof of operaspassion, liveliness, and immediacy. At the age of 51, after more than four decades of public performances, and having sung 35 roles at City Opera (and 32 elsewhere), Beverly Sills retired from the stage with a starstudded televised Gala Concert at City Opera, on October 27, 1980. Without skipping a beat, she put her celebrity into service as a tireless advocate for such worthy causes as the March of Dimes and the National Multiple Sclerosis Society, and as an important leader in the performing arts. From 1979-1989, she served as City Opera's General Director, adding 42 new works to our repertory, shepherding us triumphantly through a disastrous warehouse fire, and mentoring countless young American singers. She served on City Opera's Board of Directors from 1989-1991, and remained an honorary board member until her death. Such services earned her the Presidential Medal of Freedom (1980) and the Kennedy Center Honors (1985). From 1994-2002, Sills continued to serve City Opera as Chairwoman of Lincoln Center, until becoming Chairwoman of the Metropolitan Opera Board of Directors (2002-2005). All the while, she remained a true friend and trusted advisor to City Opera and to many individuals within our company. We are comforted by her recorded legacy of 18 full-length studio opera recordings, and numerous live opera and solo albums, most of which have been reissued digitally to preserve her radiant artistry and joie de vivre for generations to come. On behalf of the Board of Directors and the entire company, we extend deepest sympathy to her family -daughter Meredith (''Muffy'') and her son Peter, Jr. (Bucky). In addition, there are generations of colleagues, scores of friends, and legions of fans who have made up her City Opera family. We will never be the same without her. She was a warm and wonderful friend. We loved her very much and will miss her terribly. Susan L. Baker, Chairman The New York City Opera Board of Directors SILLS--Beverly, was the embodiment of American opera. She was an artist of historic talent, successful general director, dynamic board chairman and beloved media spokesman. She was a distinguished member of the Board of Directors of Opera America through the 1980s. Few people have made such a multi-faceted and sustained commitment to the field. Beverly Sills is irreplaceable and we will miss her deeply. Charles MacKay, Chairman Marc A. Scorca, Pres. /CEO Opera America SILLS--Beverly. The Board, Artists, and Staff of Lincoln Center Theater are deeply saddened by the death of our colleague, friend, fellow Board member, blithe spirit, and extraordinary artist, beloved Beverly. Beverly defined and embodied the spirit and aspirations of Lincoln Center, revivifying the classic model of artist/manager in a totally original way. We will remember her with great love. John B. Beinecke, Chairman Linda LeRoy Janklow, Chairman Emeritus John S. Chalsty, President Andre Bishop, Artistic Director Bernard Gersten, Executive Director SILLS--Beverly. The trustees, staff and volunteers of the Educational Broadcasting Corporation (EBC), licensee of Thirteen/WNET and WLIW New York, mourn the loss of Beverly Sills, a friend, partner and shining creative spirit in our work for many years. To a nation of adoring fans, she was ''America's Queen of Opera'' a remarkable talent who became a unique and vital force in the life of American arts and culture. From her childhood as a prodigy in Brooklyn, the daughter of immigrant parents, her legendary journey to stardom on the worlds opera stages defined the American dream for an opera singer. One of the most visible and beloved operatic performers in the world, her enchanting personality made her a natural in front of the camera, and she had a long and fruitful relationship with public broadcasting. Over the years, she starred in eight operas on PBS, as well as ''Skyline with Beverly Sills'' and ''In Performance at the White House.'' She was the hostess for several seasons of PBS's ''Gala of Stars'' and continued through the most recent season as hostess of ''Live from Lincoln Center.'' Last year, she was the subject of ''Beverly Sills: Made in America'' on Thirteen/WNETs ''Great Performances.'' But Beverly's marvelous contributions to public television also took place behind the screen. She served on the EBC Board as Trustee-atLarge from 1991 to 1994, and was always a great friend and supporter of our work. Of course, her generous concern for her community was part of her nature, as seen in her dedication to such important causes as The March of Dimes, her able leadership as general director of the New York City Opera, and her invaluable work as chairman of Lincoln Center and the Metropolitan Opera. We join Beverly's daughter Meredith Greenough, her son, Peter Greenough, Jr., and the entire family in grieving for the loss of a true American icon and a wonderful human being. She once said ''When I look back on my life I would rather say, I shouldnt have done that rather than I should have done that. If I have any regrets, its that I rather tried to do too much, than I didnt try to do enough.'' All who have had the pleasure of knowing Beverly Sills or thrilling to her timeless art know just how much she has done. And all that she accomplished and shared will live on in our memories and in our hearts. James S. Tisch, Chairman William F. Baker, Chief Executive Neal Shapiro, President"

Sixteen artists were asked to create original works on prefab hollow-core wood doors, but not everyone followed directions: above from left, Sarah Morris's ''Endeavor'' is silkscreen on metal, Michael Elmgreen and Ingar Dragset's ''Belly Door'' is fiberglass resin on polyurethane foam, and Liam Gillick's door is laser-cut stainless steel.

Pantsuits with braid epaulettes, a belted coat made of ribbons of brown suede and chiffon, must seem ordinary. But it was the way Gaultier told his princess fairytale, taking his time and then dropping these incredible bombs, that made the show so mesmerizing. I haven't really been excited by his last few shows: too hokey. But this one worked on a higher, more surprising level. I loved the navy satin halter dress that was sashed at the hip and worn with an officer's cap and satin coat. The couple at the end - he as a raj prince and she in an embroidered bodysuit with a leopard cape - were in the spirit of a lot of Gaultier shows. But somehow, this time, the clothes also jibed with the romance with couture."

2007-07-06T00:00:00Z,"'RESISTANCE IS ...' The well-trafficked ''Summer of Love: Art of the Psychedelic Era'' exhibition at the Whitney Museum of American Art explores the themes of liberation and dissent in art and society in the 1960s. Expanding on this focus is ''Resistance Is ...,'' a companion show of two dozen artworks about social unrest and upheaval. It is a rather earnest display, but smart, engaging and nicely put together by the curator Tina Kukielski, combining a pleasing diversity of artists, mediums and styles. Several works are documentary photographs of social disobedience, public demonstrations and political action, among them now-famous images by Richard Avedon; Gordon Parks (above, his photograph of Black Panthers in San Francisco in 1969); Larry Fink; Gilles Peress; and Garry Winogrand. Eerily pertinent is one of Mr. Peress's hastily grabbed snapshots of protest posters outside the United States Embassy in Tehran in 1979. It could have been taken just last week. Other artists recapitulate images from documentary photography, television or film, exploring the boundaries of art and political action with a mind toward merging them. There is Andy Warhol's devastating 1964 screen print of a newspaper photograph of race riots in Birmingham, Ala., but also more urgent, contemporary work like Josephine Meckseper's video splicing together footage of recent political demonstrations in New York overlaid with an ominous-sounding voice intoning obedience. Timing is everything, and this gathering of works couldn't look or feel more apposite. (Through Sept. 2, Whitney Museum of American Art, 800-944-8639, whitney.org.) BENJAMIN GENOCCHIO"

2007-07-06T00:00:00Z,"'TAP CITY' Dance performances are hard to come by in the middle of the summer, so it seems fitting that tap, which is given scant stage space throughout the year, would take New York by storm every July in the form of ''Tap City,'' Tony Waag's wide-ranging showcase of styles, traditions and generations. The festival kicks off on Wednesday with ''Tap Youth/Tap Future,'' an evening of performances by youth ensembles. This celebration of American youngsters is followed by ''Tap Internationals'' on Thursday. Born centuries ago on this continent, tap is a child of many cultures, so it's no surprise that some of the most vibrant experimentation is now being conducted as far away as Finland and Japan. Artists from these countries, as well as from Spain, Brazil, Estonia and South Africa, will offer glimpses of where tap dance is headed worldwide. (Max Pollak, right, and his company, Rumba Tap, perform on Thursday.) Of course, American tap isn't doing so badly, and next Friday some of this country's most exciting individuals and ensembles, including Michelle Dorrance, Dormeshia Sumbry-Edwards, Ayodele Casel and Jason Samuels Smith, will hit the wood. Festival performances conclude on July 14 with Mr. Waag leading ''Tap & Song,'' a spirited homage to vaudeville and comedy routines. He will be joined by luminaries like Derrick K. Grant and Brenda Bufalino. But the real star of that show will most likely be the irrepressible Mable Lee, the venerable tap elder whose hemlines seem to get shorter with every year she's been in show business. And that's a lot of years. (Wednesday through July 14, at 7 and 9:30 p.m., the Duke on 42nd Street, 229 West 42nd Street, Manhattan, 212-239-6200, telecharge.com, atdf.org; $40.) CLAUDIA LA ROCCO"

His ''Gazillion Bubble Show,'' at New World Stages, displays his talents, which have earned him numerous citations in the Guinness Book of World Records, including one for creating the largest bubble wall (156 feet long). On Sunday he said he had set another world record the previous week, by encapsulating 34 people in a bubble house. I was hoping for something similar, only to find the scale of Mr. Yang's feats, at least that day, more modest. In his uninterrupted 70-minute show, he entertains with bubble sculpture and soapy sleight of hand.

2007-07-06T00:00:00Z,"'TAP CITY' Dance performances are hard to come by in the middle of the summer, so it seems fitting that tap, which is given scant stage space throughout the year, would take New York by storm every July in the form of ''Tap City,'' Tony Waag's wide-ranging showcase of styles, traditions and generations. The festival kicks off on Wednesday with ''Tap Youth/Tap Future,'' an evening of performances by youth ensembles. This celebration of American youngsters is followed by ''Tap Internationals'' on Thursday. Born centuries ago on this continent, tap is a child of many cultures, so it's no surprise that some of the most vibrant experimentation is now being conducted as far away as Finland and Japan. Artists from these countries, as well as from Spain, Brazil, Estonia and South Africa, will offer glimpses of where tap dance is headed worldwide. (Max Pollak, right, and his company, Rumba Tap, perform on Thursday.) Of course, American tap isn't doing so badly, and next Friday some of this country's most exciting individuals and ensembles, including Michelle Dorrance, Dormeshia Sumbry-Edwards, Ayodele Casel and Jason Samuels Smith, will hit the wood. Festival performances conclude on July 14 with Mr. Waag leading ''Tap & Song,'' a spirited homage to vaudeville and comedy routines. He will be joined by luminaries like Derrick K. Grant and Brenda Bufalino. But the real star of that show will most likely be the irrepressible Mable Lee, the venerable tap elder whose hemlines seem to get shorter with every year she's been in show business. And that's a lot of years. (Wednesday through July 14, at 7 and 9:30 p.m., the Duke on 42nd Street, 229 West 42nd Street, Manhattan, 212-239-6200, telecharge.com, atdf.org; $40.) CLAUDIA LA ROCCO"
2007-07-06T00:00:00Z,"ICE FACTORY '07 This summer's outbreak of theater festivals, one of the more virulent in recent memory, continues apace. Aside from those recently closed (Brits Off Broadway, Gayfest NYC) and those happening now (Women Center Stage, Hot!), there are more on the way (Lincoln Center Festival, Fresh Fruit and others) leading up to the biggie -- the New York International Fringe Festival -- which will soon grab most of the headlines and actors. But SoHo Think Tank's annual Ice Factory festival is older (this is its 14th showing ) and far less chaotic than the Fringe. Seven plays in seven weeks, one at a time: nice and simple. The festival has previously provided an arena for envelope-pushing companies like Elevator Repair Service, Pig Iron Theater Company and Les Freres Corbusier to develop new work for possible productions, and the fare this time around will be equally offbeat. First is ''No More Pretending (a k a the Return of Indiebot)'' by Kirk Wood Bromley, the artistic director of Inverse Theater, which has been producing new American verse plays since 1998. Mr. Bromley's play is itself a celebration of indie theater and centers on a reunion of three actors who used to work together and have since traveled different paths. It closes tomorrow night to make way for next weekend's offering -- a tall tale by Rachel Shukert about a promiscuous frontiersman, presented by the Bushwick Hotel theater company -- and the five additional productions that follow. Forthcoming highlights include Alena Smith's ''Lacy Project'' (July 25 to 28), directed by Susanna Gellert and starring Kristen Connolly (above).

Born in Sultan, Washington, the son of Warren and Louise Jenkins, Bill spent his early life in Everett, Washington and was a 1937 graduate of Everett High School. He graduated from the University of Washington in 1941 and the Graduate School of Business at Harvard University in 1943. During WWII, as part of the Navy Combat Demolition Unit, Bill landed at Omaha Beach. For his heroism under fire Bill was awarded the Navy Cross and the French Croix d'Guerre with Palm. Bill began his banking career at Seattle First - International Bank in 1945. In 1962 he was named CEO of Seafirst and served in that capacity until his retirement in 1982. Under his leadership, Seafirst became the dominant bank in the Northwest, eventually becoming one of the top ten most profitable banks in America. Bill served on the board of directors of many corporations, among them, United Airlines, Pacific Northwest Bell, Safeco, and Scott Paper. Additionally, he was a past-President of the Association of Reserve City Bankers. Bill is survived by his wife Ann Ramsay-Jenkins, his children: Cordy Beckstead; Ann Rohrbacher; William Jenkins; Karen Olanna; Peter Jenkins; David Jenkins; Barbara Jenkins; and Ann's son, Adam Cornell.

Last week the German government barred the filmmakers from using a location where the military officer portrayed by Mr. Cruise was executed for a failed attempt to assassinate Hitler. A spokesman for the German government said that Mr. Cruise's affiliation with Scientology had nothing to do with that decision. The Finance Ministry, which controls state properties, said filming is generally banned at the location -- now a national shrine -- because of a previous bad experience with a German filmmaker."

2007-07-06T00:00:00Z,"SUNSET JAM ON THE HUDSON For a drummer, Pamela Patrick uses the word harmony a lot more than you'd expect. ''You have all of these different drummers, you communicate with all of them and come up with harmony -- well, not harmony in the usual sense,'' she said, grasping for the term to describe her show tonight. She needn't have looked any further. With her djembe on her lap, Ms. Patrick will lead a drumming circle in the first concert in this year's Sunset Jam on the Hudson, a weekly series created nearly two decades ago by the Battery Park City Parks Conservancy. Her task: to blend what could become a cacophony of rhythm into a distinct song. Her band: anyone who happens to drop by. ''It's a combination of performing and teaching,'' said Ms. Patrick, an accompanist at New York University who specializes in African and Caribbean drumming. ''It's exciting to get everyone to play a rhythm that sounds good and feels good.'' Other performers leading circles in this summer's series are Maguette Camara, who directs the conservancy's drumming sessions for teenagers and teaches African dance at Barnard-Columbia, and Mary Knysh, who also plays flute, mandolin and other instruments. Ms. Patrick, who has led circles for seven years, says they draw an ''intergenerational, interracial'' crowd. In addition to harmony, racial and otherwise, the drumming circles have another appeal: as Ms. Patrick's easy smile when she played recently suggests, tapping out a rhythm can be just plain fun.

2007-07-06T00:00:00Z,"REWIND: A CANTATA FOR VOICE, TAPE AND TESTIMONYBeethoven wrote odes to freedom and political equality. John Adams gave music to Richard M. Nixon's diplomatic mission to China. Now the South African composer Philip Miller has honored the 10th anniversary of his country's Truth and Reconciliation Commission hearings in song. Music is less inherently foreign to these hearings than it was to Metternich's Vienna or Nixon's trip to China. The hearings were conceived as a way to allow ordinary people to voice their grievances and memories of a country under apartheid, stimulating the healing process; and when the proceedings became heated, everyone joined in hymns until things calmed down. Some of those hymns have a place in ''REwind,'' above, as does digital sampling, recordings of the testimony and contributions from the Total Praise Choir of the Emmanuel Baptist Church in Brooklyn. While he mingles these local voices in his work -- the piece is being presented as part of Celebrate Brooklyn -- Mr. Miller, well known in South Africa for, among other things, his collaboration with the visual artist and filmmaker William Kentridge, is trying to give voice to the ethos of his own nation. Accordingly, the piece also features some leading South African voices, like that of Sibongile Khumalo, a genre-busting singer, classically trained, known as a jazz performer, experienced in opera and hailed as a ''marvel'' in The Chicago Tribune for her appearance in the South African opera ''Princess Magogo'' at the Ravinia Festival in 2004. The work is best described as a collage of national styles, from traditional Zulu techniques to protest music of the apartheid era; presumably this fits right in with the colorful melting pot that is Brooklyn.

2007-07-06T00:00:00Z,"ICE FACTORY '07 This summer's outbreak of theater festivals, one of the more virulent in recent memory, continues apace. Aside from those recently closed (Brits Off Broadway, Gayfest NYC) and those happening now (Women Center Stage, Hot!), there are more on the way (Lincoln Center Festival, Fresh Fruit and others) leading up to the biggie -- the New York International Fringe Festival -- which will soon grab most of the headlines and actors. But SoHo Think Tank's annual Ice Factory festival is older (this is its 14th showing ) and far less chaotic than the Fringe. Seven plays in seven weeks, one at a time: nice and simple. The festival has previously provided an arena for envelope-pushing companies like Elevator Repair Service, Pig Iron Theater Company and Les Freres Corbusier to develop new work for possible productions, and the fare this time around will be equally offbeat. First is ''No More Pretending (a k a the Return of Indiebot)'' by Kirk Wood Bromley, the artistic director of Inverse Theater, which has been producing new American verse plays since 1998. Mr. Bromley's play is itself a celebration of indie theater and centers on a reunion of three actors who used to work together and have since traveled different paths. It closes tomorrow night to make way for next weekend's offering -- a tall tale by Rachel Shukert about a promiscuous frontiersman, presented by the Bushwick Hotel theater company -- and the five additional productions that follow. Forthcoming highlights include Alena Smith's ''Lacy Project'' (July 25 to 28), directed by Susanna Gellert and starring Kristen Connolly (above). Ms. Smith's play, developed at the Yale School of Drama, was a finalist for the 2006 O'Neill Playwrights Conference and a 2006 Princess Grace Award. Ice Factory '07 will end with a closing-night dance party on Aug. 18.

Mr. Rosenthal was convicted on the same charges four years ago.

Another sequence showed the rock band Green Day being booed off a stage for expressing environmental concerns. The show’s executive producer, Al Jean, denied that the film represented a winding down of the Simpsons franchise. Instead, he said, it would help “bring more people in” to the series, which was first broadcast in December 1989. “The Simpsons Movie” is scheduled to be released on July 27."

Mr. Gore said that the National Museum of the American Indian had offered its site for today's concert. The last-minute addition came after organizers failed to bring Live Earth to the capital's Mall because other events had already booked the space. A Congressional resolution was introduced to let the show be held on the Capitol grounds, but some Republicans resisted the effort. Concert organizers also said that Madonna had invited Gogol Bordello, the Gypsy-inspired punk band based in New York, to perform with her during her set at Wembley Stadium in London."

''The company regards this as a private, though serious, matter,'' it said in a brief statement, adding that the decision was ''consistent with company policy.'' Mr. Martins's lawyer, E. Stewart Jones Jr. of Troy, N.Y., said his client and the ballet company agreed that the publicity presented too much of a distraction. Mr. Martins, 40, the son of Peter Martins, the company's master in chief, maintains his position with City Ballet and will return for the Lincoln Center season, Mr. Jones said. The dancer was arrested around 1:30 a.m. Tuesday. The police said he was trying to hide a bag containing a half-gram of cocaine. ''He denies any knowledge of what that substance was,'' Mr. Jones said. ''He has a very innocent explanation for how that substance came to be.'' A hearing scheduled for yesterday was put off until Aug. 3, he added. ''There's a lot that's not known to be ferreted out before this case can be discussed and resolved.''"

The portrait of Lorenzo de' Medici, a member of Florence's ruling family and the great patron of the Italian Renaissance, had been in the private collection of an American art dealer for nearly half a century. Auctioneers at Christie's in London had expected the painting to sell for $20 million to $30 million. The portrait was sold to a private collector bidding on the telephone. Completed in 1518, two years before Raphael's death, the painting features a finely dressed Lorenzo de' Medici in gold and red brocade with delicate fur trim in front of a dark green background. Painted on canvas -- something Raphael rarely did because he preferred to paint on panels -- the portrait is in superb condition, a Christie's spokesman said."

The son of immigrants whose creative approach to marketing and service helped establish a successful New York/New Jersey independent Ethan Allen retail organization died July 5 at his home in Fort Lee, New Jersey. Born to Rose and Morris Landau December 4, 1925 in the Bronx he was raised in a home where Yiddish was the primary language. He attended the competitive Townsend Harris High School (1941), rising at 4am to first assist his father in the window-washing business. In WWII he witnessed the horrors of the Nazis when his unit entered Ohrdruf, the first death camp liberated by the Western Allies. He attended City College (1947) on the GI bill. He met Laura Haskel in the Catskills and after a dogged pursuit that included tickets to the hit production of South Pacific he succeeded in winning her hand. They were wed September 8, 1951. Bill later entered the furniture business with a buddy from the army. In 1962 with the encouragement of Nat Ancell, co-founder of Ethan Allen he opened his first Ethan Allen Gallery in River Edge, New Jersey. At a time when the typical furniture store featured rows of product arranged by price, he and his wife Laurie pioneered the concept of selling room settings of coordinated home furnishings. The Landaus won awards for their creative approach. One TV spot featured Bill in white tie and tails, baton in hand, ''conducting'' a sale. In 1998 CEO Farooq Kathwari awarded him Ethan Allen's Golden Kite proclaiming ''he has served as an inspiration and role model for generations of Ethan Allen family members, including his own... He has applied his talent, creativity, vision and sense of humor to everything he does...'' Bill's motto was ''I may not ever be the biggest furniture operation around but I want to be the best.'' Today, The Landau family operates service-oriented Ethan Allen Design Centers in Bergen County, New Jersey and Rockland and Westchester Counties in New York. An avid runner, Bill competed in four New York Marathons, his last at age 60. His death was due to pancreatic cancer. His final weeks were a display of his courage and dignity, and he died peacefully at home surrounded by his close-knit family. He is survived by Laura Landau, his loving partner of 55 years and three daughters: Lois Leeds, Pamela Connolly, and Nancy Gillon. Seven granddaughters: Rebecca Kowal and Melissa Leeds; Jackie, Margot and Katie Connolly; and Leah and Danielle Gillon. His first greatgrandchild also a girl, Isabella Kowal, was born in April.

Now Grass's memoir, ''Peeling the Onion,'' has been published in the United States, and, beginning on Page 1, John Irving offers a ringing defense of his friend and mentor. Grass, of course, is no stranger to political controversy. Irving thinks it's different in America: ''When you're interviewed as a writer in this country,'' he said in an e-mail message, ''you're rarely asked about your politics; in fact, if you express a political opinion, the interviewer often looks uncomfortable. Maybe writers in America aren't supposed to be political? Movie stars, and other celebrities, are routinely mocked for their politics. But in Europe, a writer is expected to have political opinions -- and to express them. My parents never withheld their political opinions; I got my politics from them. I'm a liberal -- like a lot of people nowadays, a deeply discontented Democrat. I support Planned Parenthood; I'm an abortion-rights activist. Yet, of my 11 novels, I would describe only two ('The Cider House Rules' and 'A Prayer for Owen Meany') as political novels -- in the case of 'Cider House,' I would say it's positively polemical.''"

In Catholic theology, gender is very much not accidental: it is both intentional (in that a person's gender is ordained by God) and essential (in that it is a fundamental part of a person's soul). That is, gender is not merely a fluke of biology but an integral part of who we are as people."

A son of the Northwest, Bill Jenkins, 88, died peacefully at his home on Bainbridge Island, Washington surrounded by his family. Bill believed that ''the best of times is now'' and daily lived that motto. His indomitable presence and ability to drink in life in big gulps charmed us all. Born in Sultan, Washington, the son of Warren and Louise Jenkins, Bill spent his early life in Everett, Washington and was a 1937 graduate of Everett High School. He graduated from the University of Washington in 1941 and the Graduate School of Business at Harvard University in 1943. During WWII, as part of the Navy Combat Demolition Unit, Bill landed at Omaha Beach. For his heroism under fire Bill was awarded the Navy Cross and the French Croix d'Guerre with Palm. Bill began his banking career at Seattle First - International Bank in 1945. In 1962 he was named CEO of Seafirst and served in that capacity until his retirement in 1982. Under his leadership, Seafirst became the dominant bank in the Northwest, eventually becoming one of the top ten most profitable banks in America. Bill served on the board of directors of many corporations, among them, United Airlines, Pacific Northwest Bell, Safeco, and Scott Paper. Additionally, he was a past-President of the Association of Reserve City Bankers. Bill is survived by his wife Ann Ramsay-Jenkins, his children: Cordy Beckstead; Ann Rohrbacher; William Jenkins; Karen Olanna; Peter Jenkins; David Jenkins; Barbara Jenkins; and Ann's son, Adam Cornell. Survivors also include 20 grandchildren and five great-granchildren. At the request of the family, remembrances may be made to the William M.

The son of immigrants whose creative approach to marketing and service helped establish a successful New York/New Jersey independent Ethan Allen retail organization died July 5 at his home in Fort Lee, New Jersey. Born to Rose and Morris Landau December 4, 1925 in the Bronx he was raised in a home where Yiddish was the primary language. He attended the competitive Townsend Harris High School (1941), rising at 4am to first assist his father in the window-washing business. In WWII he witnessed the horrors of the Nazis when his unit entered Ohrdruf, the first death camp liberated by the Western Allies. He attended City College (1947) on the GI bill. He met Laura Haskel in the Catskills and after a dogged pursuit that included tickets to the hit production of South Pacific he succeeded in winning her hand. They were wed September 8, 1951. Bill later entered the furniture business with a buddy from the army. In 1962 with the encouragement of Nat Ancell, co-founder of Ethan Allen he opened his first Ethan Allen Gallery in River Edge, New Jersey. At a time when the typical furniture store featured rows of product arranged by price, he and his wife Laurie pioneered the concept of selling room settings of coordinated home furnishings. The Landaus won awards for their creative approach. One TV spot featured Bill in white tie and tails, baton in hand, ''conducting'' a sale. In 1998 CEO Farooq Kathwari awarded him Ethan Allen's Golden Kite proclaiming ''he has served as an inspiration and role model for generations of Ethan Allen family members, including his own... He has applied his talent, creativity, vision and sense of humor to everything he does...'' Bill's motto was ''I may not ever be the biggest furniture operation around but I want to be the best.'' Today, The Landau family operates service-oriented Ethan Allen Design Centers in Bergen County, New Jersey and Rockland and Westchester Counties in New York. An avid runner, Bill competed in four New York Marathons, his last at age 60. His death was due to pancreatic cancer. His final weeks were a display of his courage and dignity, and he died peacefully at home surrounded by his close-knit family. He is survived by Laura Landau, his loving partner of 55 years and three daughters: Lois Leeds, Pamela Connolly, and Nancy Gillon. Seven granddaughters: Rebecca Kowal and Melissa Leeds; Jackie, Margot and Katie Connolly; and Leah and Danielle Gillon. His first greatgrandchild also a girl, Isabella Kowal, was born in April.

2007-07-08T00:00:00Z,"A Brooklyn man was killed in a drawn-out gunfight with the police yesterday after squeezing a lifetime of mayhem into less than 20 minutes, carjacking and crashing two cars, firing at an apartment door and a carful of strangers, and then finally at officers who closed in after he squirmed out of a passenger's side window, the police said. After the police shot him on a busy Crown Heights street, the man, Victor Gordon, 23, got up and resumed shooting before officers fired a final barrage. He was pronounced dead at Kings County Hospital, the police said, and as night fell, they counted at least 122 shell casings strewn along Park Place near Albany Avenue, where the shootout took place."

Also heroic (he enlisted as a teenager and was highly decorated in WWII Air Force for active duty in the South Pacific, 499th Bombardment Sq., 345th Bombardment Group). Postwar, his career began by doing P.R. for big-name stars like Cab Calloway and for foreign governments, until he headed various ad agencies that tapped him to produce, direct, and write music and lyrics for children's tv shows and oversee all else needed to market products for children. One such was for a toy called FOOTSEE, that broke all sales records since the Hula Hoop. An earlier example that girls may remember was TINY TEARS, a doll that cried ''real tears''. It was then that his pioneering TV techniques were invented that still influence current TV commercials today. Dearest Piglet, HUNDRED ACRE WOOD is no fun since you're gone! Love,Pooh"

The park, rich with wildlife, was added because of poaching and plans to build a dam near the property on the Gambia River, while increased tourism was a major factor in the decision to add the Galápagos, according to the World Heritage Committee. Meeting last month in New Zealand, the committee noted that the number of days spent by passengers on cruise ships in the area has increased by 150 percent in the last 15 years. Nineteen islands make up the Galápagos, which in 1978 became the first site placed on the World Heritage List. They have been called ''a living museum and showcase of evolution'' (above, a marine iguana). According to the committee, the increase in tourism has ''led to the introduction of more invasive species.''"

But they did nothing with this knowledge. Bingham acted on it. He cleared, investigated, photographed and publicized Machu Picchu. Keep in mind that the Urubamba Valley is studded with Incan ruins (some undiscovered even today), and in the early 1900s no one paid them much attention."

Medvedev, the deputy director of Gazprom, has floated the idea of allowing foreign energy companies to take an equity stake in an operating company that will develop a large offshore natural gas field in the Russian Arctic. Mr. Medvedev’s comments suggest a softening of the Russian monopoly’s position on the Shtokman field, which could be used to supply liquefied natural gas to Europe and the East Coast of the United States. Last October, Gazprom froze talks with five foreign companies seeking a role in the project and said it would develop the field alone. Now the Norwegian companies Statoil and Norsk Hydro, which are merging into one company, Total of France and ConocoPhillips of the United States are negotiating for a role in the development. In an interview with The Financial Times, Mr. Medvedev’s suggestion that a “new model” of cooperation could be found for the big field holds the potential to ease tense relations between Russia and Western energy majors. Gazprom lacks the offshore technology to develop the field alone, industry analysts say."

Rowling, right, describing herself as “euphoric” and “devastated” after 17 years of writing seven novels devoted to the adventures and travails of the boy wizard Harry Potter, tantalized millions of fans by hinting that one day she may return to the magical realm of the Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry, Reuters reported. In an interview with the BBC, Ms. Rowling said: “I think that Harry’s story comes to quite a clear end in Book Seven. But I have always said that I wouldn’t say never. I can’t say I will never write another book about that world, just because I think, ‘What do I know, in 10 years’ time I might want to return to it.’ But I think it is unlikely.” Meanwhile, thousands of fans have signed a petition urging the author to keep the series going after the publication of “Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows” on July 21. Despite speculation that Harry might die in the novel, the Waterstone’s book chain, which established the petition, said his demise would be no obstacle to further adventures. “Sir Arthur Conan Doyle famously killed off Sherlock Holmes, yet brought him back after years of demand from his fans and publishers,” said Wayne Winstone of Waterstone’s. “Couldn’t the same happen for Harry Potter?” But at least one person said he was happy that the series is ending. Daniel Radcliffe, who portrays Harry on screen, described himself in an interview in the August issue of Details as “the only kid in the world who doesn’t want an eighth Harry Potter book.”."

The government is seeking the return of $441 million allegedly siphoned off through a charitable foundation meant for scholarships, and $1.1 billion in damages, officials at the attorney general's office said. The government did not bring to trial a sweeping criminal case charging Suharto with corruption and graft more than a year ago because of what doctors said was his poor health. Suharto, 86, had a stroke last year and is said to have trouble communicating. Doctors deemed him unfit to stand trial. The civil suit would allow the government to proceed with charges of graft without Suharto's presence in court, officials said. Prosecutors said more than two dozen witnesses would present evidence this week that Suharto stole hundreds of millions from the government."

They found that on the contrary, selenium might actually increase the risk. The researchers used data from 1,250 people with an average age of 63, originally recruited to test selenium as a cancer preventive. The study was randomized, double-blind and placebo-controlled, which is generally considered the most reliable design. Half the people took a 200-microgram dose of selenium daily, and the other half an identical-looking dummy pill. They were followed for an average of 7.7 years. Fifty-eight selenium recipients and 39 of those who took the placebo developed Type 2 diabetes."

2007-07-10T00:00:00Z,"Igor S.

Mr. Ivanov was Russia's foreign minister from 1998 until 2004; as secretary of the Security Council, he oversaw a policy of toughening Moscow's position on Iran's nuclear program, bringing Russia's stance more in line with that of the United States. His influence was waning recently, Russia's Vedomosti newspaper suggested in an article that linked his departure to an internal restructuring, rather than any change policy on Iran.

Medvedev, the deputy director of Gazprom, has floated the idea of allowing foreign energy companies to take an equity stake in an operating company that will develop a large offshore natural gas field in the Russian Arctic. Mr. Medvedev's comments suggest a softening of the Russian monopoly's position on the Shtokman field, which could be used to supply liquefied natural gas to Europe and the East Coast of the United States. Last October, Gazprom froze talks with five foreign companies seeking a role in the project and said it would develop the field alone. Now the Norwegian companies Statoil and Norsk Hydro, which are merging into one company, Total of France and ConocoPhillips of the United States are negotiating for a role in the development. In an interview with The Financial Times, Mr. Medvedev's suggestion that a ''new model'' of cooperation could be found for the big field holds the potential to ease tense relations between Russia and Western energy majors. Gazprom lacks the offshore technology to develop the field alone, industry analysts say."

2007-07-10T00:00:00Z,"Vice President Dick Cheney's popularity has hit an all-time low, with recent polling by The New York Times and CBS News suggesting that he has replaced Dan Quayle as the most unpopular vice president in recent history. Two polls taken in May and June reveal an erosion of Mr. Cheney's base of support -- seen in both his job approval rating and his favorability. Just 28 percent of those polled in June approve of the job Mr. Cheney is doing, while 59 percent disapprove, a reading similar to that of President Bush. The highest rating for Mr. Cheney was 56 percent in August 2002. Mr. Cheney's favorability among Americans has also suffered -- it fell to 13 percent in May, from a high of 43 percent in October 2000."

2007-07-10T00:00:00Z,"SZARKOWSKI--John. The Trustees and staff of ICP mourn the passing of John Szarkowski, colleague and friend. His discerning eye, intelligence and ability to articulate the importance of photography contributed immensely to the public appreciation and understanding of the medium. Through his exhibitions and writings he set a standard, and shaped for decades the critical arguments in our field. As a photographer himself, he left a rich legacy of important images. We will miss his insightful enthusiasm and dedication to photography. Cornell Capa, Director Emeritus Willis E. Hartshorn, Ehrenkranz Director International Center of Photography SZARKOWSKI--John. The Trustees and staff of The Museum of Modern Art mourn the loss of our longtime friend and colleague John Szarkowski, Director Emeritus of the Museum's Department of Photography. In his 29 year career as director of the department, John's exhibitions and publications earned him broad recognition as the era's most eloquent and influential critical voice in photography. His alert eye for contemporary work led him to champion Diane Arbus, Lee Friedlander, and Garry Winogrand, whom he brought together in the exhibition ''New Documents'' (1967). Other landmark exhibitions and books introduced the work of Robert Adams, William Eggleston, Frank Gohlke, Josef Koudelka, Nicholas Nixon, Jacques Henri Lartigue and Henry Wessel, among others. John also devoted major retrospectives to Ansel Adams, Brassai, Bill Brandt, Harry Callahan, Henri Cartier-Bresson, Walker Evans, Andre Kertsz, Dorothea Lange, and Irving Penn. In 1968 he secured the acquisition of the great collection of photographs by Eugene Atget that Berenice Abbott had purchased upon Atget's death and which would serve as the basis of four landmark exhibitions and books by John and Maria Morris Hambourg (1981 -1985). Among the other highlights of John's distinguished publishing career are ''The Photographers Eye'' (1966), ''Looking at Photographs'' (1973), ''Photography Until Now'' (1990). Before John came to MoMA at the age of 35, he had won two Guggenheim Fellowships for his own photographs and had published two books of them. After 1991, while continuing to write, teach, and organize exhibitions, he returned to making photographs. Both chapters of his artistic career were surveyed in the exhibition ''John Szarkowski: Photographs'' at the San Francisco Museum of Modern Art, which was shown at MoMA, New York, in 2006. John's intelligence, dedication, charm, and wit made him a vital figure at The Museum for more than four decades, and his lasting contributions to the institution stretch far beyond photography. We are deeply grateful and we will miss him badly. We extend our most heartfelt sympathy to his daughters Nina and Natasha and their families. David Rockefeller, Honorary Chairman Ronald S. Lauder, Honorary Chairman Robert B. Menschel, Chairman Emeritus Agnes Gund, President Emerita Donald B. Marron, President Emeritus Jerry I. Speyer, Chairman Marie-Josee Kravis, President Glenn D.

He received a Bachelor of Arts, cum laude from New York University in 1935, a Bachelor of Laws, cum laude from St. Lawrence University in 1938 and a Doctor of Juridical Science, summa cum laude from St. Lawrence University in 1939.

The official, Kelly R. McKinney, was associate commissioner for the city health department in 2001. According to an e-mail message to the regional director of the Occupational Safety and Health Administration, Mr. McKinney said at an Oct. 7, 2001, meeting that the city wanted the respirator rules enforced because ''contractors 'fear' OSHA's ability to issue penalties and that would cause compliance.'' The e-mail message was released in response to a Freedom of Information Act request filed by the New York Committee for Occupational Safety and Health, a labor organization. OSHA officials have said they decided to play an advisory role because enforcement would have been too time consuming to be effective. At times during the nine-month recovery effort, inspectors found that fewer than 30 percent of ground zero workers were wearing proper respirator equipment."

But that is what Mr. Bush intends to do Wednesday, when he cuts the ribbon for the renovated White House briefing room. It is the latest sign of how times have changed for a president who now must work to hold the attention of a press corps that often seems to have lost interest in him."

2007-07-11T00:00:00Z,"Three more people were indicted in Federal District Court yesterday in a scheme, carried out by at least 26 people, that involved submitting fraudulent mortgage loan applications and inflating home appraisals to get millions of dollars in loans from lending institutions. The indicted people, Galina Zhigun, Garri Zhigun and Maryann Furman, were added to 23 others announced by prosecutors in January, including mortgage brokers, real estate appraisers, straw buyers and a settlement agent, prosecutors said. Ms. Zhigun was the owner of a Brooklyn mortgage brokerage firm called A.G.A. Capital that employed many of the brokers charged in the scheme. Since 2004, A.G.A. Capital, its successor, Lending Universe, and a related company, Northside Capital, brokered more than a thousand home mortgages and home equity loans, the authorities said. In some cases, prosecutors charged, employees of the company recruited straw buyers and then helped them obtain subprime loans, which are easier for borrowers with poor credit to get. To ensure that the straw buyers got the loans, bank statements and other proof of income were falsified in some cases, prosecutors said. In other cases, the brokers stole identities to obtain loans, prosecutors said."

The goods trade deficit was £6.3 billion ($12.7 billion), the least since October 2005, down from a revised £6.9 billion a month earlier, the Office for National Statistics said. The report suggests British manufacturers are coping with the level of the pound, which reached the highest in a quarter-century last week on speculation of higher interest rates. British factories are benefiting from an economic pickup in the euro region, which buys half of their exports. Exports to non-European Union countries rose in May, by 2.3 percent, and imports fell by 1.9 percent, narrowing the gap in the goods trade to £3.5 billion.

The penalties stem from a case involving two players, including the Sooners’ starting quarterback, who were kicked off the team in August for being paid for work they had not performed at a Norman, Okla., car dealership. The N.C.A.A. said Oklahoma was guilty of a “failure to monitor” the employment of the players.Oklahoma’s president, David Boren, said the university would appeal the N.C.A.A.’s finding and the ruling that it must erase the victories. Oklahoma has 15 days to notify the N.C.A.A. in writing of an appeal.The Sooners went 8-4 and defeated Oregon in the Holiday Bowl in 2005. Records from that season involving quarterback Rhett Bomar and offensive lineman J. D. Quinn must be erased, the N.C.A.A. said. Last August, just before the Sooners began preseason practice, Coach Bob Stoops dismissed Bomar and Quinn from the team after the university determined they had been paid for work not performed at Big Red Sports and Imports."

2007-07-12T00:00:00Z,"It’s rare that you can walk up to a major sporting event at the last minute and get tickets, but the British Open offers just that option. Because links golf courses are virtually treeless and so spread out, gallery space is not a problem. And thus, neither is ticket availability. Open crowds can approach 50,000 a day, and last year, at Royal Liverpool, 230,000 spectators turned out for the whole week, including practice rounds. For next week’s Open at Carnoustie, Scotland, you can still order tickets online or purchase them by walking up to the gate. Daily prices range from about $40 dollars on Monday through Wednesday to about $100 Thursday through Sunday. A weekly pass runs about $380. Parking costs $20 daily, or $80 for the week. Significant price breaks are available for spectators ages 16-21 and 65 and over. Travelers be forewarned, however. There’s precious little to do in Carnoustie besides watching the tournament. Most tourists stay near St. Andrew’s and make the 45-minute trip to Carnoustie for the golf."

2007-07-12T00:00:00Z,"Pedaling a mountain bike for 24 hours straight might sound like some strange form of torture. But the enduring race format, which involves solo and relay-team riders cranking as many laps as possible in 24 hours on a pre-marked course, is now celebrated at dozens of events around the country each summer. Two of the biggest -- the 24 Hours of 9 Mile in Wausau, Wis., and 24 Hours of Killington in Vermont -- take place the weekend of July 28. At the Killington race, part of a national series of six 24-hour races, riders pedal a 9.28-mile course that includes a thigh-killing 1,798 feet of elevation gain per lap. Team and solo riders pedal through the day and night, donning powerful bike lights once the sun sets to illuminate the twisting technical trail. Points are racked up with each completed lap. In Wisconsin, 24 Hours of 9 Mile is the national championship race for one of cycling’s strangest of subgenres. The solo winners will spin through more than 200 miles of knobby-tire riding, starting Saturday at 10 a.m. and not stopping until Sunday at the same time, when they finish, ragged, muddy, and zombie-like, but smiling from knowing they just pulled off the nearly impossible."

2007-07-12T00:00:00Z,"PAIGE--Marvin, 74 Renowned Restaurateur and Iconic New Yorker passed away at Roosevelt Hospital on the evening of July 4th. He was surrounded by family and friends. Marvin was a celebrated New York City restaurateur known for such places as Pal Joey's, Sniffen Court Inn, Boodles, The Tin Lizzie, Charlie's, Jose's, Hamburger Harry's, Chelsea Lobster Company, Max, and the famed Jazz club The 5-SPOT Jazz Gallery, a home base for such jazz greats as Thelonius Monk and Art Blakey. This was a combination of Marvin's passion for jazz and the restaurant business. He was a pioneer in Chelsea, opening the legendary Claire Restaurant in the early eighties, following the enormous success of Claire Key West. Both were designed by TonyAward winning Broadway set designer Robin Wagner and were of considerable importance in the gay community. He was a vibrant New Yorker, an icon known throughout the city for his graciousness, charm, wit, benevolence, and love of his community, as was evident by his generous support of a variety of causes such as God's Love We Deliver, of which he was a founding contributor. Marvin was also a beloved leader with SGI USA. He was deeply committed to Soka Gakkai International, as the practice based on the teachings of the Nichiren school of Mahayana Buddhism had transformed his life. He was famous for the best Key Lime Pie in the universe, a recipe that remains a family secret. He leaves behind an adoring son, Daniel and daughter-in-law Sue, his soul-mate Pat Vega and her loving family Suzanne, Ruby, Paul, Allison, Sachi, Brian, and Matthew. Marvin will be deeply missed as he touched and embraced so many lives. He was a man whose heart truly runneth over. A memorial service will be held on July 18th, 2007 at 6:30pm at the SGI New York Culture Center, 7 East 15th Street, New York, NY 10003. In lieu of flowers, donations can be made to SGI USA and God's Love We Deliver."

Data released by RealtyTrac, a research company in Irvine, Calif., shows that filings in all stages of the foreclosure process were 42 percent higher last month than in June 2006 and that national rates rose 87 percent."

Eliot Spitzer has extended for one year, to Aug. 14, 2008, the period in which anyone who worked or volunteered at ground zero after Sept. 11 can register with the State Workers&#8217; Compensation Board, even if the person is well. Most workers&#8217; compensation claims must be filed within two years of an accident or injury.

Registration forms are available at the Web sites of the Workers&#8217; Compensation Board, www.wcb.state.ny.us/, and the Committee for Occupational Safety and Health, www.nycosh.org/."

2007-07-13T00:00:00Z,"The BBC apologized yesterday to Queen Elizabeth II for saying that she had walked out of a portrait session with the photographer Annie Leibovitz. The BBC said that a trailer released on Wednesday to promote the forthcoming documentary “A Year With the Queen” actually showed her arriving, not departing. The BBC said: “In this trailer, there is a sequence that implies that the queen left a sitting prematurely. That was not the case, and the actual sequence of events was misrepresented.” The BBC also apologized to Ms. Leibovitz. In the film the queen was wearing a crown and her Order of the Garter robes, walking down a corridor in Buckingham Palace and telling her lady-in-waiting: “I’m not changing anything. I’ve had enough dressing like this, thank you very much.” The promotional video showed the queen fixing Ms. Leibovitz with an icy stare in response to a request to remove her crown."

2007-07-13T00:00:00Z,"'UTOPIA IN NEW YORK' Utopia, an Aboriginal-owned desert reservation the size of Rhode Island, was named in the 1920s by optimistic German immigrants in outback Australia hoping for a prosperous new life. A lively women's batik group was established there in the early 1980s among the Aboriginal population, but the settlement's fame peaked in the 1990s with the success of the protean painter Emily Kngwarreye. Known as the desert Monet, she took up painting at the age of 78 and produced an estimated 6,000 paintings in 10 years. In May, in Sydney, one of her paintings became the first work by an Aboriginal artist to exceed $1 million Australian at auction. Unfortunately, none of her paintings are showing in ''Utopia in New York,'' an otherwise tasty summer sampler of paintings at the Robert Steele Gallery by a dozen artists from the Utopia region, including well-known figures like Gloria Petyarre, Barbara Weir and Minnie Pwerle, whose 2001 acrylic on canvas, inspired by the territory, is at right. Most depict traditional motifs and designs for native flowers and vegetation, like the root pattern of a yam, a staple food. But others are more abstract and bear a visual resemblance to international art movements like optical art and 1970s painterly abstraction. But what jumps out most about these paintings is the color, radiant and intense. People think of the desert as all sandhills and rocks, but it rains out there, and when the desert comes into bloom, you see the most astonishing colors, just as in the paintings.

2007-07-13T00:00:00Z,"In 1966, when we first meet them, Petey Greene (Don Cheadle) and Dewey Hughes (Chiwetel Ejiofor) present an easy, obvious contrast. Dewey, rising fast in the management ranks of a Washington R&B radio station, favors trim suits and dark ties. When he speaks on the air, listeners are apt to mistake him for a white man. Petey, serving 10 years for armed robbery in a Virginia penitentiary, is a man of an altogether different -- and, to Dewey, much lesser -- sort. His speech is laced with profanities and put-downs, and he manages to look flashy even in prison, where he accessorizes his state-issued denims with bright red shoes and a flowery neckerchief. Their subsequent friendship, which spans an era of social upheaval and fashion turmoil, is at the center of ''Talk to Me,'' Kasi Lemmons's funny, earnest, affectionate new film. Ralph Waldo Greene, as Petey was called on his birth certificate, was a beloved figure in Washington's African-American community from the late 1960s until his death in 1984 of cancer. A radio D.J., nightclub comedian and television host, he put himself forward as a no-nonsense voice of the streets, a funny, sometimes angry mix of trickster, prophet and provocateur. As portrayed by Mr. Cheadle, Petey Greene is a person of quick wit and tender heart, an irrepressible hustler whose fundamental integrity is never in doubt."

2007-07-13T00:00:00Z,"JAZZ IN JULY Since taking over as artistic director of the 92nd Street Y's Jazz in July series two years ago, Bill Charlap (above) has managed a smartly subtle renovation. Leaving intact the erudite yet welcoming tone established by Dick Hyman -- his esteemed predecessor, fellow pianist, former mentor and distant cousin -- Mr. Charlap has nudged the series gently but perceptibly toward effervescent modernity. His third season comprises a promising batch of concerts, beginning on Tuesday with a tribute to the music of Quincy Jones and Oliver Nelson, as performed by the venerable alto saxophonist Phil Woods and an eight-piece backing band. It's an unusual choice but a sensible one: during his apprenticeship years, Mr. Woods worked with both Mr. Jones and Mr. Nelson, in big bands unfairly remembered more for their crisp commercial appeal than for their artistic merit. And Mr. Woods probably didn't need to be coaxed into the idea. A few years ago he made an album called ''This Is How I Feel About Quincy'' (Jazzed Media), with Mr. Charlap on piano. At first glance it seems odd that Mr. Woods isn't also appearing on Thursday's concert, a tribute to Charlie Parker (his primary influence) and Dizzy Gillespie (another of his early employers). But that program, bearing the subhead ''Bebop Today,'' features musicians mostly born in the '60s, like the tenor saxophonist Eric Alexander, the alto saxophonist Jon Gordon and the trumpeter Jim Rotondi. And while the Jazz in July patronage still favors a more classic repertory -- Wednesday's concert, ''Cole Porter: All Through the Night,'' was the first in the series to sell out -- Mr. Charlap places admirable faith in the engaging spirit of the music. The second installment of Jazz in July, from July 24 to 26, will spotlight another bebop stalwart, the octogenarian saxophonist James Moody; a generation-spanning, Grammy-winning Latin-jazz ensemble led by the pianist Eddie Palmieri and the trumpeter Brian Lynch; and a piano-centric evening with Billy Taylor, Barbara Carroll and Eric Reed. Judging by the support Mr. Charlap has drummed up in past seasons, tickets will probably go fast.

Cuomo filed legal papers yesterday challenging the standards used by federal authorities to determine whether to extend the license of a nuclear reactor. Mr. Cuomo filed the papers in support of a legal challenge to the relicensing of the Indian Point nuclear plant in Westchester County by Andrew J. Spano, the county executive. The plant's owner, Entergy Nuclear, wants to extend the licenses of the plant's two active reactors for 20 years beyond their expiration dates of 2013 and 2015. Mr. Cuomo said federal regulators needed to evaluate more than the condition of the reactors before making a decision, and to consider factors like evacuation plans, the operator's performance and the risk of terrorism.

Just ask Marlene Dietrich, who sang in one of these Old World pavilions in the 1930s.

Her last work, ''Cloudless,'' above, a sublime series of vignettes, wowed audiences with its deft snapshots of human nature and wonderful gestural language, winning her a Bessie. The material itself, as strange as it was emotionally resonant, was top-notch. But it was the dancers who brought it to marvelous life, so it's happy news indeed to hear that the same performers will be featured in this new, site-specific work. Like ''Cloudless,'' it will be structured as a series of discrete but interconnected dance-theater snapshots. But given the setting, expect plenty of nods to burlesque, cabaret and vaudeville. And let's not forget the Spiegeltent menu, complete with homemade desserts and local wines.

If they sported double T logos instead of double Cs, well, they cost less than $200 a pair, so you could compensate by buying them in every color. For fall, Ms. Burch decided to bulk up with a quilted version of the Reva, called the Quinn, which shipped earlier this month and which has been selling in droves. In colors like lipstick red and sunny yellow that move easily from warm to cool weather, the Quinn also comes in gold metallic, black suede and black patent leather; $225 at toryburch.com or (212) 334-3000."

Michele received her BA from Beaver College and her MBA and MSW degrees from Columbia University.

She lectured at Sotheby's and the Smithsonian on this subject. As a longtime resident of NYC, she savored the vibrancy and culture of the metropolis, while balancing this passion with a love of literature and foreign exploration. With her husband, Tom, and friends she attended concerts, operas and theatre throughout the year. She also loved adventure. From her early travels to Argentina and Eastern Europe to her more recent voyages to China, Russia and Australia. Michele had bright eyes for new places and their arts. A devoted philanthropist, she supported the arts, education and lung cancer research. Michele was stylish, vivacious and deeply intellectual and carried a sharp wit wherever she went. She loved to entertain and delight her family and friends with a good story, and fabulous cooking and baking. Her indomitable spirit will always be with us.

Robert lived the last ten years in Oregon, living between Cape Mears and the downtown Portland Area. While in Portland, he enjoyed the city in no small measure, attending the Symphony, the Opera, and a unique relationship with Portland State University as a member of the Friends of the Library, the PSU Foundation, and serving on the committee to select a new librarian. Prior to his residence in Portland, Robert lived in Coalville, Utah, for eighteen years and served as Summit County Treasurer, co-founder of KPCW public radio in Park City, from where he would broadcast a weekly classical music program. Robert also owned Ryan's Bar and Dolly's Bookstore on Main Street in Park City. His primary career was as an insurance broker to the entertainment industry from 1952 to 1979 in Los Angeles, California, where he worked for the Fireman's Fund, CBS, and as owner and president of the Albert G. Ruben Company. In this capacity, Robert worked with some of the great talent agencies and studios in Hollywood, and innovated preproduction insurance for the movie industry. He was a graduate of Dartmouth College, class of 1947, and served in the United States Navy during World War Two. He was born to Lida and Frank O. Williams, October 31, 1925, in Kingston, Pennsylvania moving soon thereafter to Maplewood, New Jersey, living there until he went to college.

2007-07-15T00:00:00Z,"Of all the campaign themes that will emerge leading up to the 2008 primaries, one you probably won't hear a lot about is experience. That's because the candidates who are at the moment best positioned for the nominations of their parties have surprisingly little of it. At a time when the nation looks for a leader to meet profound challenges to its decades-long dominance as an economic and military power, the five candidates who lead in state and national polls -- Hillary Clinton, Barack Obama, John Edwards, Rudy Giuliani and Mitt Romney -- have won a grand total of five statewide elections in their cumulative political careers and have served a combined 20 years in statewide office. (Fred Thompson, who may soon be among the leaders in the Republican field, served eight years in the Senate.) In fact, the executive with the longest tenure in the group is Giuliani, who would be the first mayor in history to ascend to the presidency without holding some higher office first. Meanwhile, candidates with long careers spent mastering foreign and domestic policy, like Joe Biden and John McCain, have been flailing. In a round of television ads that feel more like a cry for help than a campaign pitch, Bill Richardson -- the two-term governor of New Mexico and a former congressman, U.N. ambassador and energy secretary -- sits in a drab office somewhere (Iowa, perhaps?), enthusiastically showing off his résumé while a clueless middle manager, entirely uninterested, rushes him along."

I ended up focusing less on the intriguing points she was making and more on the ill-advised try at making me feel sorry for the plight of the British loyalists, who constituted some 20 percent of the 1770-era American populace -- a definitive minority, by any measure. Worse yet was the labeling of the postwar accounts of this hard-luck lot as a ''wrenching archive of woe'' -- which amounts (in the case of one outspoken loyalist) to ''loneliness, illness and deprivation.'' Lonely is as lonely does."

However, the 20-somethings who dutifully delete ''evil'' from references to the Virginia Tech gunman should know that bias can show itself in subtler and more pernicious ways. For example, using the length of an article as a measure of the subject's importance, Wikipedia consistently favors the current and the kitschy (as I write, Scooter Libby's entry is longer than either Richard Nixon's or William Shakespeare's). While the Wikipedians' devotion to being unbiased is admirable, as they mature they will learn that ''fair'' and ''true'' are two very different things indeed."

Formerly of New York City where he started and ended his career in real estate, died on July 4th at his home in Annapolis, Maryland, of congestive heart failure. He was 95. Described by many as a ''Gentleman of the Old School'' Bob was a major figure in New York real estate for many years, principally with Douglas Elliman, where his wisdom, so graciously dispensed, benefited all around him. His role covered most aspects of the business and so many of the cooperative conversions and new developments in Manhattan during his time -buildings like the Excelsior, Dag Hammarskjold Tower, the Galleria, Museum Tower carried his signature. Starting out, in his youth, as he frequently recounted, collecting rents on the Lower East Side, with all the complexities of those situations -he rose to the highest levels, where he achieved recognition throughout the industry. Bob's relationship with major developers transcended many differences of opinion, personality and objectives, but achieved always a high level of accomplishment for all concerned and lasting friendships were formed. His knowledge, his integrity, his wise counsel and his special sense of humor will always be remembered fondly by all who knew him and particularly by those who worked with him under his leadership. During World War II, Bob volunteered for the Army Air Corps. He served with the rank of Captain in Africa and India. He was a man of many interests, also overseeing the development of his two nieces and two nephews after the loss of their parents at an early age. Love of flying his aircraft, Mooney, with his long time war buddy came next. He was a self-taught painter, enjoyed working in his workshop and both he and his wife loved dancing and traveling abroad. Surviving are his wife, Nanette Norris Bennet, his nieces, Mary Bruton Reid of London, England, Frances Bruton of Albuquerque, New Mexico, and his nephew Robert Bruton of New York City. He was predeceased by his nephew William Bruton, also of New York City. A memorial service will be held in Annapolis on July 22. Burial will be private.

And my wife is in the process of moving all her stuff into our house, which is of course a boon and a blessing including more books on food, but I can't even find my copy of the late Ernest Mickler's 'White Trash Cooking,' which might be my favorite just on grounds of nostalgia and unfinicky exuberance.''"

If they sported double T logos instead of double Cs, well, they cost less than $200 a pair, so you could compensate by buying them in every color. For fall, Ms. Burch decided to bulk up with a quilted version of the Reva, called the Quinn, which shipped earlier this month and which has been selling in droves.

Why had he ''used The Times as an educational tool'' in class without including a newspaper on the other side of the political spectrum as well? Writing off student criticism as simply ''echoing the political bent of their parents'' was dismissive. It is in the college years that students are most likely to rebel against the attitudes of their parents. I hope he will give this more thought. His students may be more perceptive than he thinks.

Particularly in rural areas, where specialists are rare or nonexistent, doctors fear prescribing adequately for patients in pain.

Artest would lose a little more than $470,000 in salary, about $50,000 more than Jackson.Jackson released a statement through the Golden State Warriors saying he accepted his suspension.

Artest pleaded no contest in May to a misdemeanor domestic violence charge that stemmed from a dispute with his wife on March 5. Jackson pleaded guilty last month to a felony count of criminal recklessness for firing a gun outside an Indianapolis strip club last fall, when he was with the Indiana Pacers.

But Bonds has left what he described in San Francisco during the All-Star Game festivities as his town, his friends, his people. And now, the Giants will be playing four games, beginning today, in Chicago, where the fans in the ''friendly confines'' of Wrigley Field are not likely to be any friendlier to him than fans elsewhere in his travels in a Giants road gray uniform. And the Giants' schedule has raised the possibility of not only adding another controversy to the steroids suspicions surrounding Bonds, but also creating a reprise of the commotion over the former commissioner Bowie Kuhn's involvement in Aaron's approach to Babe Ruth's previous record, 714."

During his stay Lennon became friendly with the band's Japanese translator, Junishi Yore, and after the final concert they exchanged gifts. Mr. Yore, who later became a television producer, gave Lennon a set of traditional copper cups; Lennon gave him a pair of his sunglasses. In a handwritten note from 1984, when he parted with the glasses, Mr. Yore told how, as a mark of respect, he removed the black lenses on the day Lennon was shot dead in New York in 1980. Mr. Warner said the sunglass frames came to the auction site from an American collector. Bidding is open until July 31."

The sisters, Chloe Bostian, 18, and Sydney Bostian, 11, have been living out of their parents' camper in the store's parking lot. ''It's the big finale, and all the questions are going to be answered,'' Chloe said."

Born in Syracuse, NY on November 7th, 1950, he dedicated his life to the healing arts and uplifting the lives of others. On a spiritual path since childhood, John was committed to raising the consciousness of the planet, one soul at a time. Indifferent to social positioning, John treated everyone with the same exquisite care, profound compassion and deep insight. His natural psychic and intuitive abilities were immense. His intensive healing sessions were always life-changing and often described as 'miraculous'. John's sweet joy, contagious laughter, vibrant zest for life, and unforgettable ability to caress the heart with the twinkle from his eye or the warmth of his hug, left an indelible mark on all whose lives he touched. John is survived by his brothers, David of Breckenridge, Colorado and Peter of Southeast Asia; his sister, Susan of Syracuse, NY, and numerous nieces and nephews; his healing partner Judith Johnson, former-wife Carol LeFlufy and hundreds of dear friends. There will be a celebration of John's life in August in LA, Boulder and NYC. Email: johntribute@eye-forward .com.

Tom Dunn, a department spokesman, said the department was undertaking an investigation ''to ensure the public is protected from unscrupulous, unqualified and unlicensed individuals.'' The investigation follows the announcement on Monday by the Manhattan district attorney that Touro's former admissions director and former computer center director had been indicted in a scheme to sell fake college transcripts to people who had never attended Touro and to change grades for actual students, and that they may have altered or created hundreds, if not thousands, of falsified transcripts. Ronald J. Aiello, the lawyer for Andrique Baron, Touro's former admissions director, said yesterday that his client ''received no money to change anybody's grades,'' but had tried to help authorities by ''exposing a system that was susceptible to corruption.''"

The intimacy between them is largely unspoken but is nonetheless implicit in nearly every scene. So too, however, is the distance that makes an honest and reciprocal friendship nearly impossible. Their bond, after all, is officially secured not by love or loyalty but rather by money, and their differences of status and background limit what they can say to each other."

Benedict did not explicitly insist on that right in his June 30 letter, taking a more conciliatory approach by saying merely that the Vatican &#8220;would desire to be completely free to appoint bishops.&#8221;."

2007-07-19T00:00:00Z,"That ''Hairspray'' is good-hearted is no surprise. Adam Shankman's film, lovingly adapted from the Broadway musical, preserves the inclusive, celebratory spirit of John Waters's 1988 movie, in which bigger-boned, darker-skinned and otherwise different folk take exuberant revenge on the bigots and the squares who conspire to keep them down. The surprise may be that this ''Hairspray,'' stuffed with shiny showstoppers, Kennedy-era Baltimore beehives and a heavily padded John Travolta in drag, is actually good. Appropriately enough for a movie with such a democratic sensibility, there is plenty of credit to go around. Mr. Shankman, drawing on long experience as a choreographer, avoids the kind of vulgar overstatement that so often turns the joy of live musical theater into torment at the multiplex. The songs, by Marc Shaiman and Scott Wittman, are usually adequate, occasionally inspired and only rarely inane. And they are sung with impeccable diction and unimpeachable conviction by a lively young cast that includes Nikki Blonsky, Amanda Bynes, Zac Efron and the phenomenally talented Elijah Kelley."

Educated in his native Illinois, he began his career at Lake George Opera and was soon discovered by Beverly Sills, who engaged him for City Opera. His City Opera debut, as Arturo in Lucia di Lammermoor in 1979, has long been part of company lore, for the radiance of both his singing and his plumed hat, which grazed a candelabrum and caught fire.

Even when his career took him to such venues as La Scala, Covent Garden, Vienna State Opera, Deutsche Oper Berlin, Hamburg State Opera, Glyndebourne, Aix - en - Provence, Salzburg, the Metropolitan Opera, Lyric Opera of Chicago, and San Francisco Opera, Jerry remained a beloved member of City Opera's extended family.

2007-07-19T00:00:00Z,"SHAFFER--Robert N., 1912-2007. Established first leading glaucoma practice in the West; Co-founder of Glaucoma Research Foundation; San Francisco, CA. Robert N. Shaffer, M.D., one of the leading glaucoma specialists in the world, died on Friday, July 13, announced Glaucoma Research Foundation President and CEO Thomas M. Brunner today. Born January 18, 1912 in Meadville, Pennsylvania, Dr. Shaffer received his medical degree from Stanford University, and did his residency at Stanford Lane Hospital while the campus was still in San Francisco. Dr. Shaffer's first practice was in San Francisco where in 1949 he established what became the leading glaucoma practice west of the Mississippi. Dr. Shaffer's proudest accomplishment, in the view of both he and his wife, was the establishment of the annual Shaffer Fellowship whereby Dr. Shaffer and Virginia ''adopted'' promising young doctors for a year of personal training in the diagnosis and treatment of glaucoma. More than 40 Shaffer Fellows received this very personalized training. The couple ultimately retired to their home in Greenbrae in Marin County, California. With his two partners H. Dunbar Hoskins Jr., M.D., and John Hetherington M.D., Shaffer founded the Glaucoma Research Foundation in 1978 which continues his legacy of helping those with glaucoma through education and the funding of research to find better therapies and ultimately a cure for glaucoma. Dr. Shaffer is survived by his wife of 68 years, Virginia, and by two sons. John and his wife Susan live in Santa Fe, New Mexico. Stuart lives in San Diego, California. Daughter-in-law, Kim, resides in Grass Valley, California. Dr. Shaffer was proceeded in death by a son, William. He is also survived by three grandchildren and four greatgrandchildren. The family suggests that in lieu of flowers or other remembrances, donations be made to the Glaucoma Research Foundation, 251 Post Street Suite 600, San Francisco, CA 94108 or through www.glaucoma.org."

Mr. Lassman, director of the Jane Austen Festival in Bath, England, used slightly disguised versions of chapters from Austen’s most famous works when he sent manuscripts to 18 editors in a bid to secure a publishing contract. Only one publisher spotted the fakes, which included the famous opening line of “Pride and Prejudice” (1813): “It is a truth universally acknowledged, that a single man in possession of a good fortune must be in want of a wife.” Mr. Lassman, who planted the line in a submission he had retitled “First Impressions,” told The Guardian of London: “I was staggered. Here is one of the greatest writers that has lived, with her oeuvre securely fixed in the English canon and yet only one recipient recognized them as Austen’s work.” That editor was Alex Bowler of Jonathan Cape, who wrote: “Thank you for sending us the first two chapters of ‘First Impressions.’ My first impression on reading these were ones of disbelief and mild annoyance, along, of course, with a moment’s laughter. I suggest you reach for your copy of ‘Pride and Prejudice,’ which I’d guess lives in close proximity to your typewriter, and make sure your opening pages don’t too closely mimic that book’s opening.”."

Throughout his career he gave back to the community by providing OBGYN care to low income women as a consultant to the Philadelphia Public Health Department and Planned Parenthood. To further provide low cost and free OBGYN care to needy women, he instituted the federally funded Maternal and Infant Care Project and was a member of the Maternal Welfare Committee of the Philadelphia County Medical Society.

According to Nielsen's estimates, the dancing competition drew 8 million viewers from 8 to 9:30 p.m. and the night's highest ratings among adults 18 to 49. The karaoke game show ''Don't Forget the Lyrics'' declined slightly from its premiere a week ago, earning 7.4 million viewers at 9:30. Although it finished No. 1 in its time slot in the 18 to 49 demographic, it fell short of CBS's ''Criminal Minds'' repeat in total viewers (7.6 million). CBS ended the night as the second most watched network over all behind Fox but ahead of NBC and ABC. NBC ranked No. 2 among adults 18 to 49, while CBS and ABC tied for third. That dynamic was apparent during the 10 o'clock hour, which CBS's ''CSI: NY'' led in total viewers (8.6 million) even as NBC's ''Dateline'' posted higher ratings in the 18 to 49 set.

2007-07-20T00:00:00Z,"'GLENN LIGON: UNAUTHORIZED' Famous for conceptual work that relishes and parodies racial stereotypes and cultural insensitivity, the gay African-American artist Glenn Ligon, 47, has not had a solo show in New York for four years. He returns, to the Bill Hodges Gallery, with a blistering assembly of works in various mediums from the last couple of decades, among them a pair of closely observed black-and-white screen prints on canvas of the back of his shaved head, above. They resemble studies in phrenology, a pseudoscience sometimes used to justify racism. There is also a nice selection of black-and-white text paintings, including ''Untitled (Crowd/The Fire Next Time)'' (2000), a photographic image of an African-American crowd at a demonstration on the Mall in Washington in 1995 overlaid with a silkscreen in glistening coal dust of an excerpt from ''The Fire Next Time'' by James Baldwin. The text reads: ''Something in me wondered, 'What will happen to all the beauty?,' '' in this context suggesting a gentle satire of protest rallies and the civil rights cause. Mr. Ligon's appetite for traversing racial stereotypes finds vivid expression in his narratives, etchings on handmade paper purporting to be the title page of testimonials on his intrepid life and adventures among white people in the art world. They make you laugh, but like all good socially or politically engaged art, the pieces also have the underappreciated virtue of momentarily letting the viewer see the world through someone else's eyes.

Kids chasing fireflies, couples snuggling on blankets, all sorts of delicious smells wafting from picnic baskets -- it's hard to overlook such immediate pleasures in favor of a removed stage. But you suspect that this won't be the case on Thursday, when the Bill T. Jones/Arnie Zane Dance company performs ''Another Evening: I Bow Down,'' above, along with excerpts from ''Blind Date.'' For one thing, Mr. Jones, who recently won a Tony Award for his choreography in ''Spring Awakening,'' isn't presenting decorative dance but political, socially topical work; love him or loathe him, his shows usually get people talking. And the music is a far cry from the sleepy atmospherics of some of the indie groups presented at this annual summer series: In ''Another Evening,'' the company's musical director, Daniel Bernard Roumain, mixes recordings of Wagner and the Russian composer Anton Bagatov with a live performance by Regain the Heart Condemned, a Bronx-based grindcore band. Let's just say it's not snuggling music. In fact, you might just want to toss that blanket for one of the close seats, as Mr. Jones will be performing with his troupe, moving in and out of the action as a spectator-dancer. Much has been made of the man's sculptural physique, but allow me to make a little more: It's worth watching him move, no matter the activity. It's worth watching closely.

Housed in the main glass conservatory, and the 11 glass houses attached to it, this show has an array of colorful flowers of different shapes and textures to transport guests to the islands. The hibiscus (above), the passiflora, the red and gold bromeliads and the oleanders, among many others, grow in a Spanish-style courtyard that is reminiscent of the colonial influence in the Caribbean. Along with the flowers, there are pineapple, banana and taro plants. This part of the show is particularly nice for children who only see their fruits and vegetables stacked in the supermarket, said Francisca Coelho, the curator of the show and a horticulturist at the garden for more than 25 years. To complete the tropical experience, there is also a concert series on the conservatory lawn on Thursday nights. Next week is classical music, and starting on Aug. 2, different genres of Caribbean music, as well as salsa lessons, will be offered. The garden is also presenting cooking and gardening demonstrations, a talk on Caribbean crafts and tours of the exhibition. ''If you want to get a good feeling of the tropics, now's the time,'' Ms. Coelho said.

A spokeswoman for Studio Babelsberg in Potsdam, outside Berlin, said the crew of the $80 million production, directed by Bryan Singer(''The Usual Suspects''), spent the day south of the city at an unused airport, a former battle site that had been combed for unexploded World War II munitions. The production has been enmeshed in controversy because of Mr. Cruise's adherence to Scientology, which the German government regards as a dangerous cult; and because of a refusal to allow filming on the memorial site where Stauffenberg was executed a day after the failure of the July 20, 1944, plot.

2007-07-20T00:00:00Z,"'CARIBBEAN GARDENS: JOURNEY TO PARADISE' For those stuck in the sweltering heat of the city, the New York Botanical Garden is offering a sliver of the tropical experience this summer with ''Caribbean Gardens: Journey to Paradise.'' Housed in the main glass conservatory, and the 11 glass houses attached to it, this show has an array of colorful flowers of different shapes and textures to transport guests to the islands. The hibiscus (above), the passiflora, the red and gold bromeliads and the oleanders, among many others, grow in a Spanish-style courtyard that is reminiscent of the colonial influence in the Caribbean. Along with the flowers, there are pineapple, banana and taro plants. This part of the show is particularly nice for children who only see their fruits and vegetables stacked in the supermarket, said Francisca Coelho, the curator of the show and a horticulturist at the garden for more than 25 years. To complete the tropical experience, there is also a concert series on the conservatory lawn on Thursday nights. Next week is classical music, and starting on Aug. 2, different genres of Caribbean music, as well as salsa lessons, will be offered. The garden is also presenting cooking and gardening demonstrations, a talk on Caribbean crafts and tours of the exhibition. ''If you want to get a good feeling of the tropics, now's the time,'' Ms. Coelho said.

2007-07-20T00:00:00Z,"YOU can explore Pennsylvania's inclines in a weekend, traveling west from Altoona or east from Pittsburgh. The incline at Horseshoe Curve is just a warm-up; the real attraction is the curve itself, which is a great place to watch trains. It's on Kittaning Point Road about five miles west of Altoona, but it's a good idea to visit the Railroaders Memorial Museum in Altoona (1300 Ninth Avenue, 814-946-0834; www.railroadcity.com) first. Be sure to see the display about local wrecks. Admission is $8 for both the museum and the curve park; they are open from March 31 through Dec. 31. The Allegheny Portage Railroad National Historic Site (814-886-6150, www.nps.gov/alpo) in nearby Gallitzin has many walking trails, including one to the Staple Bend Tunnel, the first railroad tunnel in the United States. Incline No. 6 is a short walk from the visitor center. Open all year except some holidays; the fee is $4. In Gallitzin, you can visit the Tunnels Park & Museum (411 Convent Street, 814-886-8871; www.gallitzin.info) and watch modern trains emerge from a long rail tunnel en route to Horseshoe Curve. There's almost always a local railroad buff there to answer questions; ask how to find the locations of some of the portage railroad's defunct inclines."

But the invisible bull's-eyes are just as memorable: those on art-world pretension; on news-media pretension; on celebrity pretension; on pretension, period. The show aims at many targets, and hits them neatly. Jim Colleran, the author, has set his hourlong romp in Littletown, a surprisingly cultured hamlet that's home to the Cosmopolitan Museum of Art. That institution is having an amateur competition while also showcasing a work by the renowned DelaGriofski. When it's discovered that the painting has been replaced by a fake, the Gumball Gang -- a quintet of enterprising middle-school sleuths, led by the spunky Candy Krunch (Maya Park) -- welcomes the case, while the aspiring journalists Morgan McCorgan and Lydia Lee (Nicholas Stewart and Casey Wenger-Schulman, left) see their opportunity to move from closed-circuit school TV to big-time cable."

2007-07-20T00:00:00Z,"SIREN MUSIC FESTIVAL For the last six years, the Siren festival at Coney Island has consistently been one of the indie-rock highlights of the summer, if not the year. Produced by The Village Voice, it crams a good dozen or so of the best and most fashionable bands of the moment into an afternoon of sun and noise in the shadow of the Astroland Amusement Park. It's a location that offers plenty of auxiliary entertainments (beer, the Cyclone, Shoot the Freak) if you need a break from the din of guitars and cellphone chatterers. But as Siren turns seven tomorrow with a lineup as strong as it has ever had -- including the rapper M.I.A. (above), the New York Dolls, Voxtrot, the Black Lips, Elvis Perkins, Cursive, Matt and Kim, White Rabbits and We Are Scientists -- it faces an uncertain future, thanks to a familiar nemesis of New York rock: real estate. A developer, Thor Equities, has bought much of the land in the Coney Island amusement zone and announced plans for a complex of hotels, a ''glass-enclosed water park,'' arcades and restaurants, estimating an investment of as much as $2 billion. And though pressure from community activists and city officials has forced the company to scale back its plans a bit, it's clear that the bulldozers are coming eventually: the batting cages and go-kart park, just blocks from where the festival's two stages will be built, have already been razed. Could this be the last Siren? Its organizers are making the most glass-half-full bet that can be made: They say they already have a date booked for next summer.

2007-07-20T00:00:00Z,"RICHARD III In the midst of its seventh season, Nicu's Spoon is doing something a lot of other small companies might envy: opening a show in its own theater. Shortly after signing an eight-year lease in April, the company is offering Shakespeare's ''Richard III'' at the newly named Spoon Theater. ''Richard III,'' directed by Heidi Lauren Duke, is typical Nicu's Spoon fare, which means it is not at all typical. The company, run by its artistic director, Stephanie Barton-Farcas, attempts to challenge stereotypes by collaborating with artists from across the spectrum of ethnicities and abilities; a production of ''Buried Child'' last year featured a spoken performance by a deaf actor accustomed to performing in American Sign Language. In ''Richard III,'' Henry Holden, right, is Shakespeare's villainous king who was ''cheated of feature by dissembling nature'' and, partly out of bitterness at his physical deformity, resorts to evil. In the mouth of Mr. Holden, who contracted polio in 1952 at 4 and walks with crutches, Richard's words take on a more particular meaning, focusing the play directly and inescapably on the issue of disability. Nicu's Spoon has dedicated its entire current season to the theme of disability and will hold a panel discussion on July 31 called ''Beyond Handicaps and Handouts: The New Face of Disability in the Arts.'' Panelists will include, among others, Ms. Barton-Farcas, Mr. Holden and Ike Shambelan, the co-artistic director of Theater by the Blind. Nicu's Spoon is also offering a summer reading series. Scheduled for Monday is ''Identity,'' a semi-autobiographical piece by Nicholas Linnehan, a playwright with cerebral palsy. (Mr. Linnehan plays the lead role, too.) ''Forgiveness of the Saints,'' a black comedy by Christian Gaul, is on Tuesday. (''Richard III'' runs through July 29, Wednesday through Sunday at 8 p.m., Spoon Theater, 38 West 38th Street, fifth floor, Manhattan, 212-352-3101, theatermania.com; $18.

2007-07-21T21:33:18Z,"Barry Bonds of the San Francisco Giants took aim at a familiar target on Saturday. Not a pitcher, not Commissioner Bud Selig and not Hank Aaron. Bonds spent most of a 20-minute pregame session with reporters taking jabs at them. ""I got to have my tape recorder because some of you are downright dirty,"" said Bonds, who tapes interview sessions and posts the audio on his Web site. ""You all keep saying what you say and I'll keep recording it."" Between Bonds's sometimes playful, sometimes serious shots at reporters inside the visiting clubhouse at Miller Park, he discussed a myriad of topics. Bonds, who is three homers from passing Aaron's career record of 755, said he was happy that Selig attended Friday's game. Selig was here Saturday, too. When Bonds was asked if he wanted to talk to Selig, he said, ""About what? We haven't talked in a while. But I have respect for Bud. Like I said before, I don't care what you say or what you write. Bud has always been nice to me, always been nice to my father. I like Bud."" Bonds reiterated that he respects Selig and would not lose respect for Selig if the commissioner does not shadow Bonds for his record-breaking game. Selig is expected to follow Bonds's hunt for 756. If Bonds breaks Aaron's record and Alex Rodriguez of the Yankees chases Bonds down, Bonds repeated that he would be in the front row to watch Rodriguez. ""This is our fraternity,"" Bonds said. ""If we don't stand for each other, who is going to stand behind us? I'll stand behind a fellow player, regardless."" Using that logic, is Aaron refusing to stand behind Bonds by not going to Bonds's games? ""I don't know,"" Bonds said. ""The thing is, we respect Hank regardless. Like I've said before, it's not fair, in a sense, if you're asking somebody to take away whatever they have to do. You can't predict something like this."" Bonds said he feels good when he is ""by myself"" and added that he feels best when he is ""just like the other 24 people in here."" Since Bonds has long had more privileges than any other Giant, it was a curious statement. Bonds has never wanted to be treated like every another player. Since Bonds is not scheduled to start on Sunday, his next appearance in left field will probably be on Monday. The Giants return to AT&T Park for seven games, a perfect time for Bonds to eclipse Aaron because he would be assured of being cheered. But Bonds was not predicting a timetable for the historic homer. ""Everybody who goes through milestones, go back and look at it, it takes a while,"" Bonds said. When someone reminded Bonds that the national reporters who are covering him would disperse once he gets to 756, he invited them to leave now. ""You all hate me anyway,"" Bonds said.

The new editor of one of my favorite motor racing magazines - I like to read Autosport, but I like to have a counterbalance too, and for that I turn to my weekly read of Auto Hebdo, the top selling French magazine - outlined his idea that night in Bahrain. Pascal Dro, the editor, said they planned to buy a Volkswagen van and travel Europe throughout the European leg of the F1 season, going from race to race as journalists did in the old days, camping out and taking in the real culture of the venues. None of this first class travel from airport to hotel and from hotel to circuit and back again. This would be the real hardy stuff of the old days.

Many supporters of President Evo Morales who are from the Western highlands oppose the idea, seeing it as an effort by relatively prosperous lowland states in the east to weaken the president's authority. The proposal has been put forward by delegates working to rewrite the Constitution.

The Barnes collection, whose founder, Albert C. Barnes, stipulated that no picture could be lent, sold or even moved in its galleries, has been in Lower Merion, Pa., since 1922. Three years ago the foundation won a long legal battle to move the collection to downtown Philadelphia to increase attendance and improve its finances. The Lower Merion Township Board of Commissioners passed the zoning change on Wednesday, but the Barnes's executive director, Derek Gillman, said that the new rules, while helpful, were not enough to keep the collection from moving.
