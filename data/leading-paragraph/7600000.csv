2012-02-14T00:00:00Z,"LEWIS--Robert, founding partner of the labor and employment law firm Jackson Lewis, LLP, died peacefully Sunday morning in Los Angeles, following complications from pneumonia at the age of 88. Born in Brooklyn, New York, even his earliest baby pictures reveal Bob's quintessential grin. He met his wife Ethel Padnick as a teenager, and after several years of courtship, from which the family still holds his elegant letters, the couple embarked on what would become nearly 65 years of marriage. He enlisted in the Army shortly after graduating from Brooklyn Technical High School. It was his time stationed in Italy during WWII as a secretary for the Office of the Staff Judge Advocate that sparked two of his lifelong interests: law and archaeology. He enrolled in Brooklyn Law School on the G.I. bill and married Ethel in 1947. In the years to follow, his career and family grew. Alongside Louis Jackson, he formed the firm now known as Jackson Lewis, one of the nation's leading firms specializing in labor and employment law. In his career Bob was known for his scholarly interest, his mentorship of younger attorneys, and his firm's commitment to ethical practice. He co-authored the book ""Winning NLRB Elections,"" now in its fourth printing, and argued before the Supreme Court in Food Employees Union v. Logan Valley Plaza (1968). In addition to an illustrious law career, Bob pursued many passions throughout his life. He was an avid tennis player. A lifetime of travel took Bob and Ethel around the world, including trips to Israel, Tunisia, China, Morocco, and Cuba. His family and friends remember him best for his lifelong commitment to reading The New York Times; his endearing love for Chinese food and ice cream (eaten separately); his passion for Civil War history and presidential biographies; and his unending good humor and dedication to his family. He is survived by his wife Ethel, his brother, Warren, his daughters, Eileen and Nancy, and his grandchildren, Carolyn and Alison Silveira and Matthew Lewis."

2012-02-14T00:00:00Z,"A longstanding debate about the perceived insensitivities of a popular comic-book adventurer -- call it Detractors versus Tintin -- has reached a Belgian court, which has ruled for now that one of Tintin's more contentious exploits is not racist and does not need to be banned. Of the two-dozen Tintin volumes written and illustrated by Herge, the pen name of the Belgian artist Georges Remi, the 1931 installment ''Tintin in the Congo'' has been one of the more problematic tales to feature that intrepid young cartoon reporter. The book, which was reissued in 1946, has been criticized for its presentation of Congolese people, who are drawn with dark skin and large lips and depicted as childlike, and bookstores have sold it with protective warnings or pulled it entirely."
2012-02-14T00:00:00Z,"Wall Street made its broadest assault yet against new regulation on Monday, taking aim at a rule that has come to define the battle over how to police banks in the aftermath of the financial crisis.

More than 200 letters were expected to be filed by the midnight deadline on the rule, which regulators outlined in October."
2012-02-14T00:00:00Z,"When my mother asked what I wanted for my 16th birthday, I said, ''A new bicycle.'' From her response - ''How much longer are you going to be riding a bicycle?'' - I knew I wasn't going to get one. I muddled through on my aging Schwinn (bought secondhand when I was 10) for two more years, and then for my 18th birthday I bought myself a new bike. I am now 70, and I've never gone a year without a bike - not one that collects dust or serves as a clothes hanger, but a bike that is ridden nearly every day. I use my bike for daily exercise and transport to class, work, shopping, tennis, swimming - most everywhere I need to go, as long as the weather, distance and dress code do not make riding impractical."
2012-02-14T00:00:00Z,"Because of an editing error, an article on Sunday about a portrait believed to be of Mary Todd Lincoln that hung in the governor's mansion in Springfield, Ill., and has now been deemed a hoax misidentified the position that Barry Bauman, an independent conservator who discovered the fraud, held when he was at the Art Institute of Chicago.

2012-02-14T00:00:00Z,"It doesn't have a particularly snappy title, but the Summary Report of the Expert Panel on Integrated Guidelines for Cardiovascular Health and Risk Reduction in Children and Adolescents makes for surprisingly accessible and interesting reading. For one thing, it's well written, especially for a scientific report and a set of clinical guidelines. For another, the report, published in late 2011 in the journal Pediatrics, takes on a question at once basic and profound: What do we know about how the hearts of children become the hearts of adults?"

2012-02-15T00:00:00Z,"PEELEN--Fred G. The Netherland-America Foundation is deeply saddened by untimely passing of Fred G. Peelen, member of its Board, Executive Committee and Chair of the Peter Stuyvesant Ball Organizing Committee. Fred, after graduating from The Hague Hotel School in 1962, came to the U.S. as trainee, sponsored by the Netherland-America Foundation. Upon completion of his traineeship and graduate work at the Cornell School of Hotel Administration, he joined InterContinental Hotels where, after a stellar career over 35 years, he retired in 2000 as President for the Americas of InterContinental Hotels and Resorts and Crowne Plaza Hotels and Resorts. Those who had the privilege to know and work with Fred will remember his personal loyalty, generosity and operating manager's attention to detail. With his passing, the Netherland-America Foundation has lost one of its most supportive members, and many have lost a good friend. The visitation will be at Frank E. Campbell at 1076 Madison Avenue at 81st Street, New York City, on Wednesday, February 15, 2012 from 5:00-8:00pm. A solemn Requiem Mass will be held at Saint Thomas Church on Fifth Avenue at 53rd Street on Thursday, February 16 at 11:00am.

The cups, on which the artist Gwyneth Leech has drawn or painted vibrant graphic patterns and imagery, fill the glass-enclosed ''prow'' at the base of the Flatiron Building, on 23rd Street, between Broadway and Fifth Avenue. Suspended in space, they move gently, too, as heat currents rise from the floor registers. It's a public art installation for which no invitation is needed. Passers-by simply stop -- amused, astonished, perplexed, engaged. Or they come by, as Michael Munguia did the other day from Bedford-Stuyvesant, Brooklyn, because their friends have told them they must see the lady who draws on coffee cups."

2012-02-15T00:00:00Z,"Over the past five theater seasons Asian-American actors were cast in 2 percent of the roles in Broadway and major Off Broadway productions, while 80 percent of the roles went to white performers, 13 percent to black actors, and 4 percent to Hispanic artists, according to data compiled by an advocacy group for Asian-American performers. Over those seasons, 2006-07 to 2010-11, Asian-Americans were found to be the only minority group whose share of New York acting roles declined slightly, and they were also the least likely to be chosen for characters that would traditionally be played by white actors. The data, culled from Broadway credits and 16 major Off Broadway theater companies, were the focus of a roundtable discussion on Monday night at Fordham College at Lincoln Center that included 19 actors, directors, playwrights, producers, and talent agents, including the Tony Award winners David Henry Hwang (''Chinglish,'' ''M.

2012-02-15T00:00:00Z,"HAMMOND--R. Philip, a chemical and nuclear engineer who helped usher in the age of nuclear power, died on December 22 in Laguna Hills, California. He was 95. As a graduate student during WWII at the University of Chicago, Dr. Hammond helped Enrico Fermi prepare the uranium for the world's first nuclear reactor. A few years later at the Los Alamos Scientific Laboratory, he proposed and co-led the Nuclear Reactor Division, designing and building several advanced reactors and helping to work out processes for the back end of the nuclear fuel cycle. Later at the Oak Ridge National Laboratory he led efforts on nuclear-powered desalinization. He was among the first to advocate the concept of monitored retrievable storage for nuclear waste. Dr. Hammond served on the U.S. delegation to the international conference on the peaceful uses of nuclear energy over nearly a decade. He was a prolific investor, awarded more than 20 patents, a charter member of the American Nuclear Society, and the author of more than 100 technical articles on nuclear power and other energy topics. In his later career, he headed the energy division of R&D Associates in California, developed an extremely high efficiency desalinization unit for the Los Angeles Division of Water and Power, and consulted widely in the U.S. and overseas. In addition to his professional work, he was an amateur painter, an enthusiastic dancer, and a lifelong sailor. Dr. Hammond is survived by his four children, Allen L. Hammond; David M. Hammond; Jean P. Hammond; and Stanley W. Hammond."

2012-02-15T00:00:00Z,"NOON (Sundance) THE POOL (2008) Venkatesh (Venkatesh Chavan), an Indian teenager on the verge of manhood who ekes out a living cleaning hotel rooms and selling plastic bags on the street, becomes obsessed with the shimmering pool of a luxurious home in which no one seems to swim. Eventually he approaches the property's owner (Nana Patekar, above right, with Mr. Chavan) and becomes his assistant; the rich man, in turn, promises to become Venkatesh's benefactor if he will move from Goa to Mumbai and go to school. ''At first 'The Pool' suggests an inspirational fable in which a selfless older man rescues a youth from the streets,'' Stephen Holden wrote in The New York Times about this film by Chris Smith, adapted from a short story by Randy Russell. ''But just when you expect the film to turn into a predictable, rose-colored valentine to opportunity and hope, it goes to a deeper, more ambiguous place. Contemplating poverty from Venkatesh's perspective, it understands that his pursuit of upward mobility will require a terrifying leap of faith.'' The film was chosen as a New York Times Critics' Pick. In ''Summer Hours'' (2009), a movie from Olivier Assayas, at 1:45 p.m., Charles Berling and Juliette Binoche play Frédéric and Adrienne, siblings who must decide what to do with their mother's charming country house and cherished art collection after her death. Frédéric wants to keep everything the way it is for the enjoyment of the next generation. Adrienne and another brother (Jérémie Renier) want to sell the house and most of its contents, donating the best paintings and furnishings to the Musée d'Orsay. ''That, in a nutshell, is the dramatic arc of this extraordinary film, which, in spite of its modest scale, tactful manner and potentially dowdy subject matter, is packed nearly to bursting with rich meaning and deep implication,'' A. O. Scott wrote in The Times. 10:55 A.M. (HBO2) SOMEWHERE (2010) In the first entry in a double bill from Sofia Coppola, Johnny Marco (Stephen Dorff) is a movie star existing in a mind-numbing purgatory -- he drinks, he has anonymous sex, he burns rubber in his Ferrari -- at the Chateau Marmont hotel in Hollywood. He finds something to live for after his ex-wife leaves their 11-year-old daughter (Elle Fanning, right, with Mr. Dorff) in his care. Writing in The Times, A. O. Scott described the movie as ''exquisite, melancholy and formally audacious.'' What happens, he added, ''is something marvelous: a film that never raises its voice (its loudest and most assertive sound is that Ferrari) or panders to your emotions, but that nonetheless has the power to refresh your perceptions and deepen your sympathies.'' ''Lost in Translation'' (2003), for which Ms. Coppola won an Oscar for best original screenplay, follows at 12:40 p.m."

He was a sympathetic and helpful colleague, a cool head under pressure, and a warm, cheerful team player who simply loved his job. His record number of performances is an amazing feat, but the deep affection and admiration that he inspired in his colleagues is an even greater legacy.

Mr. Taruskin, 66, has written books on Russian music, including the magisterial two-volume ''Stravinsky and the Russian Traditions.'' He has also produced compilations of essays originally published in The New York Times and elsewhere on all manner of musical subjects, and his writings on early music in particular have been influential, showing that current notions of historically ''authentic'' performance owe as much to modernist impulses and predilections as they do to any firm understanding of ancient practice."

2012-02-16T00:00:00Z,"SEWARD--George Chester, the Honorary Life President of the International Bar Association (London) and founding partner of Seward & Kissel LLP, a New York City-based law firm, died on February 15, 2012, at his home in Scarsdale, NY. He was 101. Mr. Seward was born August 4, 1910 in Omaha, NE. His parents were Frank G. Seward and Ada L. Rugh Seward. He had one brother, Leslie Rugh Seward, who died at age eight in a swimming accident. He devoted himself principally to his law practice and was well known as a business lawyer and director of a number of companies. He became a partner of Seward & Kissel in 1953 and under his leadership the Firm became a well-known business law firm, recognized world-wide for its work with clients in the private investment/hedge fund, banking and transportation (shipping) industries. Mr. Seward was a partner at Seward & Kissel until December 1983 and had been Senior Counsel to the Firm since that date, maintaining his strong work ethic by working at the Firm three or four days a week through the end of 2011. Mr. Seward was an active member of the American Bar Association as chairman of a committee that developed a model corporation act to govern the creation and operation of business corporations, which is used in whole or part by more than half of the American States. Mr. Seward was Chairman of the ABA's Section on Business Law and a member for fourteen years of its governing body, the House of Delegates. In addition, he became involved on behalf of the ABA in the International Bar Association in the early 1960s when the IBA was a federation of Bar Associations. Mr. Seward played a key role in developing the IBA into a world organization of business lawyers as well as a world organization of bar associations. Mr. Seward, as the organizing chairman of the individual member side of the IBA, became its Honorary President-Founder and the IBA made him its Honorary Life President. Three heads of state Rajiv Gandhi of India, Dr. Mario Soares of Portugal, and Hon. Arpad Goncz of Hungary have, on invitation from the IBA, given George Seward lectures. Among the other organizations in which Mr. Seward had been involved as an officer or trustee are University of Virginia Arts & Sciences Council (president), Phi Beta Kappa Associates, a fundraising arm of the United Chapters (president), Edwin Gould Foundation for Children (trustee), New York Genealogical and Biographical Society (trustee), and the American Bar Foundation Special Committee on Model Corporation Acts (chairman). Mr. Seward was the author of Basic Corporate Practice and co-author of Model Business Corporation Act Annotated. In addition, he authored a book, ""Seward and Related Families,"" about his branch of the Seward family that mentions his unusual elementary education. He transferred frequently among schools in Nebraska, Missouri, Oklahoma, Illinois and Indiana as required by his father's business activity. He said he failed a term in an early grade, possibly due in part to the transferring, but ultimately graduated from Louisville (Kentucky) Male High School, cum laude, and the University of Virginia, where he received a B.A. degree and an LL.B. degree, Phi Beta Kappa, Order of the Coif and was a member of the University's Raven Society. Mr. Seward was distantly related to William H. Seward, Lincoln's Secretary of State. They share the Secretary's great-grandfather as a common direct ancestor. Two portraits of Mr. Seward are available to the public: one by Carlos Perez-Herce of Madrid, Spain (1994) is in the entrance room of the offices of the International Bar Association, 10 St. Bride Street, London; and one by Everett Raymond Kinstler of New York City (2000) is displayed in the main conference room of Seward & Kissel LLP, One Battery Park Plaza, New York City. Mr. Seward's wife of 54 years, Carroll Frances McKay Seward of Suffolk, Virginia, died in 1991. He is survived by four children: Gordon Day Seward, Patricia McKay Seward (Mrs. Dryden Grant Liddle), Dr. James Pickett Seward and Deborah Carroll Seward (Mrs. Roy Thomas Coleman), five grandchildren: Andrew Gordon Seward, Dryden Jonathan Liddle, Ashley Shiona Liddle (Mrs. Andrew James Cole), Eric Thomas Coleman and Paige Carroll Coleman, and seven great- grandchildren, Nichole (Nikki) Elizabeth Seward, Thomas (TJ) Joseph Seward, Connor Stephen Seward, Thea Patricia Emily Cole, Sofie Shiona Isobel Cole, Beatrice Jennifer McKay Cole and Alastair William Dryden Liddle. Mr. Seward was a member of a number of social clubs, including: New York Yacht Club, The Knickerbocker Club and The Down Town Association in New York City; Scarsdale Golf Club in Scarsdale, NY; Gardiner's Bay Golf Club and Shelter Island Yacht Club in Shelter Island, NY; Greencroft of Charlottesville, VA; Metro- politan Club of Washington, D.C.; University Club of Chicago, IL; and the Bohemian Club of San Francisco, CA. Family members and the partners of Seward & Kissel are planning a celebration of his life to be held this spring at the Down Town Association.

2012-02-17T00:00:00Z,"KAPLAN--Zelda, women's rights activist and beloved nightlife darling, died Wednesday in New York City of natural causes. She was 95. A global traveler, particularly to villages in remote Africa, Ms. Kaplan educated members of the local communities on women's equality. Founding the World Cultures Council, Ms. Kaplan focused on the concerns of female genital mutilation and inheritance rights. For over three decades she immersed herself into the tribal cultures, which influenced her exotic style and worldly views. Ms. Kaplan, born June 20th, 1916 to Russian immigrants in Flemington, New Jersey, was the eldest of four daughters. Her father was Barnet Berkowitz, a horse and cattle dealer. She studied law at Rutgers and married twice before moving to New York City in the 1960s. Ms. Kaplan, a former ballroom dance instructor and pro golfer, was enthralled by the youthfulness of the city's nightlife. Being a regular at The Copacabana, she became close to Tito Puente and Celia Cruz. For nearly half a century she was a fixture at various art openings, fashion shows and nightclubs. An adamant supporter of education, Ms. Kaplan took it upon herself to learn all that was presented to her. Her sincere curiosity for other people made her universally loved. During her last years, she hosted Sunday night dinners where a diverse group of friends and family from around the world would gather. She truly lived every day of her life with complete happiness until her final moment. Ms. Kaplan is survived by her sisters Ruth Berkowitz of New York City, Shirley Dworkin of Hingham, Massachusetts, nieces Betsy Ann Harris of Irving, Texas, Barbara Binder of Edgartown, Massachusetts and nephews Jonathan Dworkin of Poughkeepsie, New York and Stephen Kaplan of Texas. Private services will be held Sunday for close friends and family."

2012-02-17T00:00:00Z,"The producers of the Broadway musical ''Spider-Man: Turn Off the Dark'' have agreed to pay $9,750 a week in royalties to Julie Taymor, whom they fired as the show's director last March, as part of a settlement with Ms. Taymor's union that was announced on Thursday. The royalty payments will continue for the duration of the New York production, which began in November 2010 as one of the most troubled shows in Broadway history - actors suffering injuries, artistic collaborators at war with one another, costs ballooning to a record $75 million - and has now become one of its biggest hits. The musical, which Ms. Taymor created with Bono and the Edge of U2, now routinely grosses $1.3 million or more a week, and set a record for Broadway by grossing $2,941,794 between last Christmas and New Year's holidays. The settlement, between the producers and the Stage Directors and Choreographers Society union, does not affect separate litigation in federal court where Ms. Taymor and the producers have sued one another. While the union was advocating on behalf of Ms. Taymor's contractual rights as director, the litigation in federal court deals with her other roles as a creator of the musical and one of its script writers. In order to reach a settlement, which both sides had pursued ahead of scheduled union-initiated arbitration hearings this month, the producers and Ms. Taymor were willing to make concessions."

Romola Garai and Vanessa Redgrave play Briony as a young woman and as an older writer.

O. Scott wrote in The New York Times. ''As the title suggests, 'Atonement' is fundamentally about guilt and the attempt to overcome it, and about the tricky, tragically imperfect power of art to compensate for real-life crimes and misdemeanors.'' The film received seven Oscar nominations, including one for best picture."

2012-02-18T00:00:00Z,"Dozens of antiquities were stolen when two masked gunmen burst into a small museum at the birthplace of the ancient Olympics in southern Greece on Friday, the Associated Press reported. The robbers smashed display cases with hammers in what was the second major museum theft in two months in the debt-ridden country. The head of the union of guards for culture ministry museums and other sites said spending cuts had compromised security at hundreds of museums and ancient sites across Greece. The robbers took 65 artifacts and tied up the museum's only guard at the museum of the Games at Olympia, officials said. A culture ministry official said the stolen antiquities--which included small objects made of bronze and pottery, including figurines, vases and lamps--dated from the 9th to the 4th centuries B.C. Also stolen was a seal ring dating to Late Bronze Age Mycenaean times. Culture Minister Pavlos Geroulanos submitted his resignation after the morning robbery at the museum some 210 miles southwest of Athens. It was unclear whether it had been accepted by Prime Minister Lucas Papademos. In January thieves stole artworks by Picasso and Piet Mondrian from the National Gallery in one of the best-guarded areas of central Athens."

2012-02-18T00:00:00Z,"Though his career stretches from rockers (''Sid and Nancy'') to monsters (''Dracula''), with lauded turns in ''The Dark Knight'' and the ''Harry Potter'' series, Gary Oldman has just this year received his very first Oscar nomination, for best actor, for his portrayal of the dour cold war spook George Smiley in Tomas Alfredson's remake of John le Carre's ''Tinker, Tailor, Soldier, Spy.'' The original British mini-series, made in 1979, starred Alec Guinness as Smiley. Mr. Oldman, who can do a fair Guinness-as-Obi-Wan Kenobi impression, didn't rewatch it, for fear of contaminating his performance. (Mr. Oldman is more than decent at impressions; when he jams on Beatles covers with friends, he's always Paul.) Over tea at an Upper East Side hotel, he recently spoke with the Bagger about the turns in his career (he hopes to direct again soon and is working on a script set in the 19th century) and why he was so comfortable playing Smiley on screen. ''He spent a great deal of it sitting down,'' Mr. Oldman said. ''I got quite used to it. I don't know whether I could ever go back to acting standing up.''"
2012-02-18T00:00:00Z,"These days, we all know the dietary drill. Consume hearty proportions of fruits and vegetables. Avoid saturated fats as if they were radioactive. And when it comes to protein, fish and chicken are the ways to go. All well and good - my pores are looking better already! - but let's all admit that there are times when we crave something comfortingly, even flagrantly unhealthy, like a big ham sandwich. The same holds true, in my view, for theatergoing, and in particular the aesthetics of acting. When it comes to performing onstage, subtlety and delicacy are to be prized far higher than showy displays of obvious emotion. To cite an exemplar of this most respectable kind of acting, I'd guide you right now to ''The Road to Mecca.'' Rosemary Harris is irradiating the American Airlines Theater with a performance that draws you into the troubled heart of her character with such natural grace that it is easy to forget that she is giving a performance at all."

2012-02-19T00:00:00Z,"Like their counterparts in Hollywood, French filmmakers have a knack for turning social division into feel-good comedy. The schism between the sunny Mediterranean south and the wintry northern region of the country was the subject of the 2008 blockbuster ''Bienvenue Chez les Ch'tis,'' which has already been remade in Italy and will soon have an American remake produced by Will Smith. ''Intouchables,'' released last November, may become an even bigger hit by pushing the hottest buttons in Sarkozy-era France: race, class, religion and national identity. The film, directed by Eric Toledano and Olivier Nakache and loosely based on a true story, has already become the fifth highest grossing film of all time in France, and given French cinema its newest star in the person of the 34-year-old Omar Sy. Sy plays Driss, a Senegalese petty thief who is hired to take care of Philippe (Francois Cluzet), an aristocrat paralyzed from the neck down in a hang gliding accident. The contrasts between the two men are not subtle. Philippe lives in palatial splendor with a staff of servants (and a sullen teenage daughter), while Driss's home is a crowded apartment in a rough suburban housing project. He wears hoodies and high-tops, while his employer favors ascots and handmade loafers. After a stuffy soiree featuring a chamber orchestra, Driss loosens things up with a little Earth, Wind & Fire."

2012-02-19T00:00:00Z,"''If the individuals and families most affected during the Great Depression had photographed themselves instead of being shot by government-commissioned photographers,'' asks the artist LaToya Ruby Frazier, ''what would their own self-representation look like?'' For the past 10 years, Frazier, 30, who grew up in the blighted steel town of Braddock, Pa., has sought to answer that question, photographing her family - her mother and grandmother in particular. Next month's Whitney Biennial will include a series of intimate, unflinching self-portraits Frazier took in her grandmother's house, where she helped care for her step-great-grandfather (a former steelworker who suffered from multiple, chronic illnesses) and which is now abandoned. ''I witnessed his body decay and crumble,'' says Frazier, drawing a powerful metaphor for her hometown. ''Without financial resources or better access to health care, I did what came natural. I documented it.'' This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print."
2012-02-19T00:00:00Z,"Sick of fluorescent tips, dips, tie-dye and highlights, we turned to Orlando Pita and the color team from Orlo, his Manhattan salon, to take the radical color trend to the next level. His mandate: soft, allover pastels that would coordinate with the palest confections from the spring collections. It had to be radical yet refined, cool but chic. ''I wanted to show that unconventional colors can work if you do them really well,'' Pita says. ''Dyeing hair one soft, uniform color looks elegant and new.'' Typically, on shoots where daring color is called for, stylists use sleights of hand like spray paint, powder, wigs and clip-in precolored extensions. But we were determined not to fake it. Usually, the sentence ''we're doing a hair story with Orlando Pita'' is enough to grab the attention of even the most jaded model agent. Following it with ''and we need four girls who will let us dye their hair for real and keep it that way for three days during campaign season'' is enough to lose it. Despite repeated assurances that Pita's stylists would restore the girls' hair to the color and condition they found it in, several agents demurred. Finally, however, we found four brave beauties willing to go the extra mile for their craft."

2012-02-19T00:00:00Z,"A LITTLE over a year ago, Maine Huts & Trails opened its newest backcountry eco-lodge in the mountains of western Vacationland. Each of the lodges, now numbering three, has hot showers and private guesthouses and serves breakfasts and dinners prepared with locally sourced organic ingredients. Ditto the brown bag lunches. Connecting them is a rolling, 45-mile trail that begins outside Sugarloaf ski resort, two hours north of Portland, and ends in the tiny community of West Forks. Once a week, the trails are groomed to perfection, and the lodges' caretakers will shuttle your belongings forward, leaving you free to cross-country ski or snowshoe through the fairy tale woods unencumbered. Gleaned mostly from the home page of mainehuts.org, this all sounded fantastic to my wife, Hrund, and me. We were eager for a few days of skiing through pristine forests, even more so because we knew how rare great hut-to-hut backcountry skiing is in North America. The Appalachian Mountain Club's lodge-to-lodge skiing might be comparable, though its trails are not as finely groomed, while hut systems in the West like the 10th Mountain Huts between Vail and Aspen, can require slogs over high ridges and bunking with legions of sweaty, beer-guzzling dudes. Weekends are also likely to be booked months in advance. So far, that is not the case with Maine Huts & Trails, which is still a work in progress."

2012-02-19T00:00:00Z,"Even given the opulent construction of the day, the Schinasi Mansion at Riverside Drive and West 107th Street was a showstopper. Built in 1909 for Morris Schinasi, a tobacco importer and cigarette manufacturer from Turkey, the 35-room white marble structure was richly embellished inside and out. Ornamental carving took inspiration from the foliage of the tobacco plant, and when the owner's daughter went off to school in the morning, she used to pet the sleeping stone lions flanking the front steps and kiss them goodbye. The mansion's most beguiling feature is a tunnel in the basement that was thought to have extended west to the Hudson River. But exactly what had the tunnel been used for? To smuggle in Turkish tobacco, or perhaps alcohol or hashish? Or as a conduit for ladies of the evening? Equally mysterious, which of two subterranean openings led to the tunnel in question? ''We're not sure,'' said Tod Mercy, the Corcoran broker handling the sale of the mansion, which is listed for about $15 million. ''Maybe it's whichever one you believe it to be.''"

Beloved husband of Ginny, devoted father of Peter and Todd, loving father-in-law of Jessica, adoring grandfather of Nate and Will, most loving son of the indomitable Phyllis; dearly loved brother/brother-in-law of Carolyn and Elliot Ross and Pat and Ed Falkenberg. Roger grew up in Shaker Heights, Ohio. He attended Dartmouth College where he graduated Phi Beta Kappa and Magna Cum Laude, then went on to earn his MBA at Dartmouth's Amos Tuck School of Business, graduating with High Distinction and winning the Walter A. Jacobs Memorial Award for intellectual curiosity and sound judgment. He earned his LLB from Yale Law School in 1968. He was devoted to all his schools throughout his life and reveled in the fact that both his sons chose to attend Dartmouth. For his first job as a lawyer Roger chose a small New York firm, becoming the 19th lawyer at Skadden Arps. The firm currently numbers over 1800 lawyers. An integral part of the firm's growth and management over the last 40 years, he took great pride and pleasure in the institution that Skadden has become. He loved his work, the Skadden family and his close relationship with his mentor Joe Flom. Over the decades Roger rose as a consummate dealmaker while also serving for more than 20 years as the firm's global Corporate Practice Partner, overseeing Skadden's corporate, M&A, Governance, Finance and Restructuring practices. He was a senior member of the firm's Policy Committee as well as a frequent lecturer and panelist. Throughout his career he served on a number of non-profit boards, including Burke Rehabilitation Hospital, The Legal Aid Society, the New York branches of Teach for America and The American Jewish Committee, and was a co-chair of Mt Sinai Hospital's Crystal Ball. He chaired the Yale Law School Fund and was an original member of Dartmouth's President's Leadership Council. He loved skiing, fishing, biking in Aspen and sharing all these activities with his family and friends. Roger Aaron lived his life fully and with great dedication to the things he believed in. He fought his battle with cancer bravely and privately with the help of talented and extremely caring doctors and nurses. Roger was a source of wise counsel and support for a vast network of family, friends and acquaintances. His tremendous generosity, sharp intellect and thoughtful leadership will be dearly missed. Services will be held on Tuesday, February 14 at 11am, at Temple Emanu-El, Fifth Avenue at 65th Street, New York City.

I see the ruined windshield in front of me, the Brooklyn street, the sky and clouds. Everything is black, gray and white -- no color. My husband is speaking to me from the driver's seat, but I cannot answer him. All I know is that I do not want to move. I feel at once serene and distant. I have this thought: If I'm going to die, this is not such a bad way to go. Some time later, a man's voice tells me that the Jaws of Life will make a lot of noise, and I think to myself, I don't care. As I lie on a gurney in the emergency room and a woman cuts off my clothes with large scissors, I feel grateful that I'm wearing jeans and a cotton sweater and not something expensive.

2012-02-19T00:00:00Z,"SEWARD--George Chester, the Honorary Life President of the International Bar Association (London) and name partner of Seward & Kissel LLP, a New York City-based law firm, died on February 15, 2012, at his home in Scarsdale, NY. He was 101. Mr. Seward was born August 4, 1910 in Omaha, NE. His parents were Frank G. Seward and Ada L. Rugh Seward. He had one brother, Leslie Rugh Seward, who died at age eight in a swimming accident. He devoted himself principally to his law practice and was well known as a business lawyer and director of a number of companies. He became a partner of Seward & Kissel in 1953 and under his leadership the Firm became a well-known business law firm, recognized world-wide for its work with clients in the private investment/hedge fund, banking and transportation (shipping) industries. Mr. Seward was a partner at Seward & Kissel until December 1983 and had been Senior Counsel to the Firm since that date, maintaining his strong work ethic by working at the Firm three or four days a week through the end of 2011. Mr. Seward was an active member of the American Bar Association as chairman of a committee that developed a model corporation act to govern the creation and operation of business corporations, which is used in whole or part by more than half of the American States. Mr. Seward was Chairman of the ABA's Section on Business Law and a member for fourteen years of its governing body, the House of Delegates. In addition, he became involved on behalf of the ABA in the International Bar Association in the early 1960s when the IBA was a federation of Bar Associations. Mr. Seward played a key role in developing the IBA into a world organization of business lawyers as well as a world organization of bar associations. Mr. Seward, as the organizing chairman of the individual member side of the IBA, became its Honorary President-Founder and the IBA made him its Honorary Life President. Three heads of state Rajiv Gandhi of India, Dr. Mario Soares of Portugal, and Hon. Arpad Goncz of Hungary have, on invitation from the IBA, given George Seward lectures. Among the other organizations in which Mr. Seward had been involved as an officer or trustee are University of Virginia Arts & Sciences Council (president), Phi Beta Kappa Associates, a fundraising arm of the United Chapters (president), Edwin Gould Foundation for Children (trustee), New York Genealogical and Biographical Society (trustee), and the American Bar Foundation Special Committee on Model Corporation Acts (chairman). Mr. Seward was the author of Basic Corporate Practice and co-author of Model Business Corporation Act Annotated. In addition, he authored a book, ""Seward and Related Families,"" about his branch of the Seward family that mentions his unusual elementary education. He transferred frequently among schools in Nebraska, Missouri, Oklahoma, Illinois and Indiana as required by his father's business activity. He said he failed a term in an early grade, possibly due in part to the transferring, but ultimately graduated from Louisville (Kentucky) Male High School, cum laude, and the University of Virginia, where he received a B.A. degree and an LL.B. degree, Phi Beta Kappa, Order of the Coif and was a member of the University's Raven Society. Mr. Seward was distantly related to William H. Seward, Lincoln's Secretary of State. They share the Secretary's great-grandfather as a common direct ancestor. Two portraits of Mr. Seward are available to the public: one by Carlos Perez-Herce of Madrid, Spain (1994) is in the entrance room of the offices of the International Bar Association, 10 St. Bride Street, London; and one by Everett Raymond Kinstler of New York City (2000) is displayed in the main conference room of Seward & Kissel LLP, One Battery Park Plaza, New York City. Mr. Seward's wife of 54 years, Carroll Frances McKay Seward of Suffolk, Virginia, died in 1991. He is survived by four children: Gordon Day Seward, Patricia McKay Seward (Mrs. Dryden Grant Liddle), Dr. James Pickett Seward and Deborah Carroll Seward (Mrs. Roy Thomas Coleman), five grandchildren: Andrew Gordon Seward, Dryden Jonathan Liddle, Ashley Shiona Liddle (Mrs. Andrew James Cole), Eric Thomas Coleman and Paige Carroll Coleman, and seven great- grandchildren, Nichole (Nikki) Elizabeth Seward, Thomas (TJ) Joseph Seward, Connor Stephen Seward, Thea Patricia Emily Cole, Sofie Shiona Isobel Cole, Beatrice Jennifer McKay Cole and Alastair William Dryden Liddle. Mr. Seward was a member of a number of social clubs, including: New York Yacht Club, The Knickerbocker Club and The Down Town Association in New York City; Scarsdale Golf Club in Scarsdale, NY; Gardiner's Bay Golf Club and Shelter Island Yacht Club in Shelter Island, NY; Greencroft of Charlottesville, VA; Metro- politan Club of Washington, D.C.; University Club of Chicago, IL; and the Bohemian Club of San Francisco, CA. Family members and the partners of Seward & Kissel are planning a celebration of his life to be held this spring at the Down Town Association. In lieu of flowers, the family suggests a gift to either the donor's own charity or to the University of Virginia to be added to the George and Carroll Seward fund for scholarships, University of Virginia Development Office, University of Virginia, P.O.

Included are sly drawings by her husband, Ruben, who, she writes, fell hard for ''a shy dreamer of a girl.'' In a recent phone interview, Toledo said she has no events planned for New York Fashion Week, aside from launch for her own book on Thursday night at the W Times Square. ''It's just the impersonal feeling in fashion that exists now,'' she said, explaining why she sits out this twice-yearly industry event. ''It's just marketing.

(Some, like the hand-bound, screen-printed Birkensnake, undoubtedly are.) Travis Kurowski, who covers lit mags on his blog, Luna Park Review, estimates that there are now as many as 2,800 magazines.

We thought Ms. Bushnell was the ideal co-host for a talk about a book that truly feels like a precursor to ''Sex and the City,'' the franchise she created in the '90s with her column in The New York Observer."

2012-02-19T00:00:00Z,"Women at the New York fall collections wore what might be the last hurrah for the two-decade fashion movement known as deconstruction. All over the city, women have been tearing sleeves off coats and jackets to look more casual -- it's almost like buying a bike without fenders. They should be thankful for the unusually mild weather. In sharp contrast, the designer collections seen last week put architecture back into cloth coats. Among the more memorable: the Edwardian style from Donna Karan, photos Nos. 5 and 10. Ralph Lauren's dandies, No. 11, and his British tweeds, Nos. 12 to 15, hit the perfect fashion notes in this dramatic turn to clothes that sharpen the wearer's image. Perhaps the most innovative tailoring was from Narciso Rodriguez, Nos. 16 to 18. By displacing the common-seeming, he added a totally new volume. From Rodarte, a house specializing in dresses, buttoned-up coats, Nos. 1 to 3, were a highlight. At Tommy Hilfiger, Nos. 4 and 9, coats featured a military precision. From Marc Jacobs, No. 6, there were jackets with a late Victorian shape. From Michael Kors, No. 7, a greatcoat had an asymmetric fur collar. And from Thakoon, No. 8, we saw the nonchalance of the '40s haberdasher style."
2012-02-19T00:00:00Z,"FOR the last eight years, Mor Mor Rita has been the go-to label for beautiful groovy mothers like Maggie Gyllenhaal, Olya Thompson and Milla Jovovich, who dress their young daughters in clothes designed by Ryan Roche in her farmhouse in upstate New York. Last year, Ms. Roche (a mother of three) started designing for her grown-up pals: luscious little tops, silk slips and organic cotton trousers; pieces to wear on lazy Sundays in Sullivan County. For her third collection, she has collaborated with Ms. Thompson on graphic falcon imagery. ''A friend sent me a picture of a kestrel,'' Ms. Roche said, ''with a note that if I were a bird, I would be this one.'' Results include featherweight sweatshirts, cashmere fringed vests and high-waist skirts in cotton voile, all covered in intriguing renderings of the bird's plumage. (Prices range from $330, for this printed silk blouse, to $897, for this silk dress; go to stevenalan.com.)

2012-02-19T00:00:00Z,"If there was one spring runway trend that reached critical mass, it was the strong, dark brow. There were bushy '80s caterpillars at Donna Karan (courtesy of Charlotte Tilbury); Dick Page's heavily penciled arches at Zero + Maria Cornejo and Michael Kors; and for the Chanel catwalk, Peter Philips painted emphatic punctuation marks onto otherwise pale, pretty faces. The look was most striking (and modern) on blondes like Abbey Lee, Ginta Lapina and Daphne Groeneveld (see the heavy black brows she sported at Altuzarra). ''Big brows are more youthful and raw than perfect ones,'' says Pat McGrath, who played them up at Stella McCartney and Versace. ''What's more, anyone can wear a stronger brow. But the level of strength should be adjusted to suit your face.'' To get the look, alternate between two pencils - one matching your brow color and the other slightly lighter (McGrath likes CoverGirl Brow & Eye Makers in Soft Blonde and Soft Brown) - and draw light strokes in the direction brows grow to create the illusion of texture and depth. Use fewer strokes at the brow's beginning and end so they don't look drawn in. Next, heighten the arches to give a bit of lift, and extend the ends if needed. Use an angled brow brush and powder (try Laura Mercier Brow Powder Duo) to fill in bare areas and up the drama ante."

Readers responded on NYTimes.com, mostly expressing support for the policy; a selection of their comments is below. I am a ''dog advocate'' that insists dogs be leashed out in public. Twice while walking my leashed dogs, I have had my dogs attacked by the unleashed dogs of others. Both owners said the same thing to me: ''He/she has never done that before!'' There's nothing like spinning in circles, trying to protect your pit bull that is on leash and cowering between your legs, while throwing punches down at a boxer who is trying to attack your dog. I don't go anywhere where there are unleashed dogs. It is egotistical and selfish for those people to think they have the right to let their dogs roam free. Checi,"

Today the Posse Foundation selects about 600 students a year from eight cities.

2012-02-19T00:00:00Z,"For the first time in her 16-year career, Diana Vishneva, the Mariinsky and American Ballet Theatre prima ballerina, has hung up her toe shoes to dance a piece by Martha Graham. Next month the Russian starlet will perform Graham's 1947 ''Errand Into the Maze,'' along with two other contemporary works, in New York. The Graham piece is inspired by Ariadne and the Minotaur and is a riff on sexual self-awareness. Vishneva is flat-footed throughout and wears a floaty, quite lyrical dress - a far cry from her usual tutus - a design done for the original Graham production. ''In classical roles you don't have the freedom to express deep inner emotions the way I do now,'' says the 35-year-old, conceding that she could never have taken on the part as a young girl. ''Even in Ariadne's weakness, the role of the maid, she is still strong and powerful.'' For the other two works, ''Dialogue'' by John Neumeier and ''Subject to Change'' by Paul Lightfoot and Sol Leon, she dances in a maroon housedress-like leotard and white Victorian blouson and briefs, respectively. Asked how this new program and new look have been received thus far in Moscow and St. Petersburg, she said cutely: ''Taking the roof off.''

2012-02-19T00:00:00Z,"Hearts have broken across New York this week, and not by Valentine's Day dates gone bust. New York City private schools have been sending out notifications -- yes, no and the dreaded wait list -- and by many accounts, it has been a tough year to win a coveted seat at some of the city's top schools. But for those who have, there's a downside to victory: the bill. As we predicted a few weeks ago, tuition numbers are topping $40,000 at some schools, whether they present it that way or not."
2012-02-19T00:00:00Z,"Though the artist himself might disagree, it would seem that Julian Schnabel has not been much concerned, in life, with the concept of negative space. As anyone who has ever met him, seen one of his paintings or visited one of his homes will tell you: He takes up all the space available, and more. But peel him away from the frame, and you find that what used to be the background has quieter and more intriguing virtues. Olatz Schnabel, the Basque-born, Paris-raised former model who for over 17 years was Schnabel's muse and wife, has dedicated a large portion of her life to throwing her husband into even greater relief. Almost as soon as she met him, she gave up her high-end, global, fun-based career (Olatz owned homes in Paris, San Sebastian, Bali and Ibiza) to curate shows for him in Mexico; to influence, inspire and translate. It's fairly safe to say that ''Before Night Falls,'' the movie that won Javier Bardem an Oscar nomination, could not have come about without her. And she had as much to do with the design of the old West Village perfume factory that would later become the pink Venetian folly, the Palazzo Chupi, as Julian did."

Little ones clutched their parents' hands as they made their way through the crowds into shows like Prabal Gurung, Derek Lam and Tommy Hilfiger. Some had insider access as the children of designers, while others took their places in the front row next to their well-connected parents. Perhaps this early exposure will sway their career choices, or maybe it will just influence their style aesthetic. Watch out, Tavi Gevinson. ELIZABETH BRISTOW"

The streak ended Friday, but not before Lin transformed the Knicks' offense. The team now exploits Lin's greatest strength: the ability to execute many fundamental elements of a traditional point guard by using the pick-and-roll and other screens to create open shots for himself and his teammates. Here is a look at three plays from the Knicks' victory on Wednesday over Sacramento."

2012-02-19T00:00:00Z,"IN 2002, after the end of a long-term relationship, the Brooklyn artist Iviva Olenick did a lot of Internet dating. ''It was a weird and disorienting experience,'' she recalled, and she ended up turning her dating stories into hand-stitched embroideries that read like whimsical postmodern musings on love (Carrie Bradshaw minus the cynicism) on vintage linen tea towels, handkerchiefs and tablecloths. Her most productive period starts just before Valentine's Day and ends around the summer wedding season. ''They're popular presents,'' she said of her needle-and-thread précis of romantic triumph and defeat, noting, unsurprisingly, ''the positive ones sell better than the not-so-positive ones.'' Both varieties will be on display in ''Funny Ha Ha,'' a group show at the Brooklyn Arts Council (111 Front Street) that opens on March 1. NANCY MacDONELL"

Less than a year ago, E.V.'s and plug-in hybrids seemed ready for a mass takeoff, with the Nissan Leaf and Chevrolet Volt leading the charge down the runway. But early sales have been disappointing, causing some analysts to express caution. Are plug-in cars establishing a foothold? Or might they be done in by familiar factors: high prices, short range, long charging times, plentiful gasoline and consumer resistance?"

Off the billiards room was a door just four feet high. ''To go through it,'' Ms. Spellman said, ''you have to duck down practically to your knees.

2012-02-19T00:00:00Z,"During Prohibition, many New Yorkers considered the 18th Amendment to the Constitution more a suggestion than the law of the land. City residents created ingenious places to conceal their liquor, and Eric Schiller was thrilled to discover such a place in the Victorian house he bought last year on Westminster Road in Prospect Park South. Mr. Schiller, an architect, was inspecting the original oak staircase when he noticed a rectangle outlined on the first-floor landing. The rectangle turned out to be a slab of wood that could be lifted by using a discreetly incised thumbhole. Underneath lay a four-foot-deep space lined with shelves and containing a ladder down which a relatively nimble individual could have made his way to retrieve a well-concealed bottle of port or aged whiskey."
2012-02-19T00:00:00Z,"You would never know from her daily uniform - a crisp white shirt and trousers - that Carolina Herrera is a lover of prints. Every season, however, the designer anchors her collection with a motif that's whimsical, graphic, even a tad goofy. Over the years we've seen Art Deco swimmers (spring 2005), digital renderings of feathers (fall '11) and, recently, Herrera's own toy poodle, Gaspar (prefall '12). ''It's very important to have at least one print in every collection,'' says the designer, who draws inspirations from many places. For instance, for the print of red deck chairs in resort '08, she studied the paintings of the interiors illustrator Jeremiah Goodman. A Paul Poiret silk scarf begat the naive garden radishes in spring '06. ''Print adds a touch of fantasy and is the perfect link for bringing all of the components of the collection together,'' she says. Plus, they're fun to look at and wear - as Herrera herself explains, ''Fashion is for the eyes.'' This season we're aflutter over her Bauhaus birds in lemon and scarlet. This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print."

Mr. Albanese served on the St. Francis Board of Trustees for 20 years, beginning in 1988, a period of time that saw a remarkable expansion of the hospital's facilities and a significant enhancement of its reputation. Among his many lasting contributions to St. Francis, Mr. Albanese put his formidable talents as a real estate developer to work for the hospital during an unprecedented facilities expansion project that was capped by the construction of a major patient care and surgical pavilion in 2008. Mr. Albanese will always be remembered by members of the St. Francis family as a wonderful friend and dedicated supporter. His leadership, generosity, and kindness will be sorely missed.

In the blacked-out setting for the Calvin Klein show on Thursday, the actresses Emma Stone (in red) and Rooney Mara (in black) took their front-row places next to Emmanuelle Alt and Franca Sozzani, the editors respectively of French Vogue and Italian Vogue. Ms. Alt's usual game face for a show is either one of mild boredom or profound boredom. At Calvin, her expression was somewhere in between, and while most of the journalists in the room would have been eager to chat up Ms. Mara, Ms. Alt barely acknowledged her. Things got stranger when Eric Wilson, of The New York Times, tried to speak to Ms. Mara about the Oscars (a lot of people are interested in what she will wear) and got a brushoff. A sought-after actress is sitting at a press event, surrounded by sophisticated editors and writers, and she pulls a Garbo. Priceless."

Giving up on Lin, as strange as it may seem now, was not a controversial decision for the Warriors. An undrafted free agent, Lin represented almost no actual investment for the team. He was given 29 games to show his stuff, but he did not sufficiently impress the front office and was sent on his way."

Without straying too far off the pop grid, she's the perfect antidote to Rihanna-Gaga overload - dare we say, a skinnier Adele, a more stable Amy Winehouse? Since posting ''Video Games'' to YouTube last summer, she's amassed tens of millions of hits, sold out concerts to fashion's who's who and now, finally, has released her long-awaited album, which is currently No. 2 on the Billboard Top 200 in America, and No. 1 in Britain, Germany, Ireland, Switzerland and Austria. If you were going to manufacture a star for this moment, you'd manufacture her. Some people believe that's precisely what happened. Sitting in her producer's Chelsea studio in jeans and an oversize sweater, smoking Pall Mall Blues that share space - in a beat-up snakeskin bag - with an old Tennessee Williams paperback, Lana Del Rey tries to shrug off the suggestion that her father bought her success, that her face went under the knife, that she is some sort of industry creation, all accusations floating around the Internet.

The commercial producer attached to the musical, David Shor, who had been hoping to bring the show to Broadway in the fall, attributed the delay to the ''very intricate'' process of creating the musical, which has had private readings recently but had not yet begun rehearsals for the Pasadena run."

2012-02-20T00:00:00Z,"The Chicago News Cooperative, a nonprofit news organization that provided news to The New York Times and tried to compete online with The Chicago Tribune and The Chicago Sun-Times, will suspend operations the week of Feb. 26, its editor, James O'Shea, said. The decision came after the main supporter of the cooperative, the John D. and Catherine T. MacArthur Foundation, changed the types of grants that it could quality for, effectively reducing its potential financing. The news organization's second-biggest source of funds, The Times, was then asked to contribute more, but both parties concluded that ''did not make economic sense,'' Mr. O'Shea said in a telephone interview Sunday."

2012-02-20T00:00:00Z,"It is a well-worn ritual of New York City's political class: the state-of-the-whatever speech, when major officials, from mayor to borough president, deliver self-defining blasts of oratory, while power brokers and operatives convene for handshakes and gossip. The proceedings, modeled on the president's State of the Union address, typically involve a bit of amateur pageantry, perhaps some Irish step-dancers or Billy Crystal-style video montages. But this year, with a mayoral election coming up, the events have become a chance for some of the City Hall aspirants to provide an early glimpse of the values, visions and attack lines they hope to use to win over voters in 2013. Here are highlights of the speeches of three of the hopefuls, along with that of Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg."

In ''Botanica,'' Jim Findlay's overripe juxtaposition of scientific jargon and randy flora, the wildlife endures that and much, much more. Mr. Findlay has moved to the director's chair after nearly two decades of creating beguiling visuals for a Who's Who of downtown theater practitioners (the Wooster Group, Collapsable Giraffe, Cynthia Hopkins, Ridge Theater). And fittingly for a designer taking the reins (he is also a writer of the play, with Jeff Jackson), he has constructed a riotously lush world in which the environment usurps its ostensible minders."

(Ovation) THE FISHER KING (1991) Jeff Bridges portrays Jack Lucas, a radio disc jockey on the verge of suicide after his bullying leads a deranged caller to commit mass murder. He finds redemption in helping Parry (Robin Williams, above), his indirect victim, who has been left homeless and driven half-insane by loss, in this film from Terry Gilliam. ''The best parts of 'The Fisher King' and its mad, whirling vision of modern life are those that see grief lurking just beneath the surface,'' Janet Maslin wrote in The New York Times. Mr. Williams received an Oscar nomination for best actor; Mercedes Ruehl won best supporting actress for her role as a video store owner who loves Jack despite it all. 6 A.M. (HBO) SING YOUR SONG (2011) In 1956 Harry Belafonte became the first recording artist to sell more than a million LPs with his album ''Calypso'' and in the process broke color barriers as he rose to success in an era of segregation. He won Grammy, Tony and Emmy Awards but was also blacklisted during the McCarthy era, spied on by the C.I.A. and the F.B.I., and threatened by the Ku Klux Klan, state troopers and Las Vegas Mafia bosses. This documentary from Susanne Rostock distills more than 700 hours of interviews, excerpts from F.B.I. files and archival film to chronicle the life and times of Mr. Belafonte (above center with John F. Kennedy), now 85, from his birth in Harlem and his childhood in Jamaica to his work with the Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King Jr., his struggle against apartheid in South Africa and his actions to counter gang violence and the incarceration of youth."

2012-02-20T00:00:00Z,"GREENBERG--Steven A.,passed away on Saturday, February 18 at Memorial Sloan Kettering Hospital after a valiant eight month battle against lymphoma. At his side were his beloved brother Charles, his loving companion and dear friend Elizabeth Ray, and his closest friend and partner for 35 years Michael Scharf. Born in Brooklyn, Steven was the son of the late David and May, the brother of Charles (Donna), the uncle of Craig (Amelia) and Lori Schlam (Evan). He was a graduate of James Madison High School and NYU. He excelled in everything he did in his varied and extraordinary business career. He began as a securities analyst at Value Line; he owned Anametrics, Inc. and developed the firm into a leading money management and financial public relations firm; and he had close relationships with many CEOs and was a major investor in Commodore Computers, Bally, US Surgical, and Edgcomb Steel. He also became a success in the hospitality and club business by owning the Gramercy Park Hotel, Roxy (the roller disco club), the Palladium, and more recently 230 Fifth Avenue, the leading rooftop bar venue in New York. Steven was instantly recognizable because of his striking resemblance to Benjamin Franklin. He was a fixture at his first row center court seats at NY Knicks games and at all of the finest restaurants in the city. Steven's generosity to waiters and maitre d's was legendary, and he merely had to arrive at a restaurant and it immediately became a more exciting place. When Steven became interested in a subject, he became passionate about it. It was this passion that led him to develop one of the world's finest Art Deco furniture and objects collections. Many items from the collection were exhibited at the Metropolitan Museum of Art. Steven was a beloved friend to many. He always tried to help those in need, with both financial support and advice. He was a quiet but most generous donor to many charities. He could analyze a problem, company or situation with uncanny insight. He loved life and lived his exactly as he wished. By virtue of his extraordinary life, which touched so many, he appeared to be a person whose life would go on forever, but sadly, it has ended far too soon. He fought his health battle privately and with great courage. The care and concern of his doctors and nurses at MSK was exemplary. Steven's funeral service will be held Monday, February 20 at 11:45am at Riverside Memorial Chapel, 76th Street and Amsterdam Avenue, New York."

Born on August 28, 1916, he was the son of Jerome H. Schloss and Evelyn Gomprecht Schloss. Beloved husband of Ann (Pearson) Schloss and the late Louise (Filer) Schloss, father of Edwin Walter Schloss, Stephanie Schloss Scott and Samuel Wennberg. He was the brother of Marjorie Isaac, grandfather of Katie and Emily Schloss; James Scott; Claire, Lenna, and Maren Wennberg. Mr. Schloss grew up in Manhattan, attended Franklin School and the New York Stock Exchange Institute, where he studied under Benjamin Graham. He enlisted in the Army on December 8, 1942, rising to the rank of Second Lieutenant. He served in Iran as part of the US Signal Corps, finishing out his wartime service at the Pentagon. At the end of WWII, he was invited by Benjamin Graham to join the firm of Graham Newman as a securities analyst. In 1955 Mr. Schloss set up his own investment management partnership, Walter J. Schloss Associates. His son, Edwin, joined the company in 1973. Walter managed investments with utmost integrity and a commitment to his clients. He retired in 2002 at the age of 87. Warren Buffett referred to Walter as a super investor. In his 2006 Letter to Shareholders, Buffet said: Let me end this section by telling you about one of the good guys of Wall Street, my long-time friend Walter Schloss, who last year turned 90. From 1956 to 2002, Walter managed a remarkably successful investment partnership, from which he took not a dime unless his investors made money. My admiration for Walter, it should be noted, is not based on hindsight. A full fifty years ago, Walter was my sole recommendation to a St. Louis family who wanted an honest and able investment manager. Mr. Schloss has been profiled in numerous financial journals including Barrons, Forbes, and Fortune. His investment archive is housed at Columbia University. He served as Treasurer of Freedom House. Walter Schloss had an insatiable curiosity about the world. His business and personal integrity is legendary. He was a proud New Yorker, an inveterate NY Yankees fan, a bird watcher in his beloved Central Park, and excelled at bridge. In 2000, while on a tour of France, he met Ann Pearson, whom he married in 2001. Their shared enjoyment of travel, theater, and family get-togethers brought them a decade of happiness. Above all, he was dedicated to his family. A private service will be held for the family. A reception for family and friends will be scheduled at a later date. Memorial contributions may be sent to Central Park Conservancy, Public Broadcasting System (PBS) or Freedom House, Washington DC."

2012-02-21T00:00:00Z,"GREENBERG--Steven A.,passed away on Saturday, February 18 at Memorial Sloan Kettering Hospital after a valiant eight month battle against lymphoma. At his side were his beloved brother Charles, his loving companion and dear friend Elizabeth Ray, and his closest friend and partner for 35 years Michael Scharf. Born in Brooklyn, Steven was the son of the late David and May, the brother of Charles (Donna), the uncle of Craig (Amelia) and Lori Schlam (Evan). He was a graduate of James Madison High School and NYU. He excelled in everything he did in his varied and extraordinary business career. He began as a securities analyst at Value Line; he owned Anametrics, Inc. and developed the firm into a leading money management and financial public relations firm; and he had close relationships with many CEOs and was a major investor in Commodore Computers, Bally, US Surgical, and Edgcomb Steel. He also became a success in the hospitality and club business by owning the Gramercy Park Hotel, Roxy (the roller disco club), the Palladium, and more recently 230 Fifth Avenue, the leading rooftop bar venue in New York. Steven was instantly recognizable because of his striking resemblance to Benjamin Franklin. He was a fixture at his first row center court seats at NY Knicks games and at all of the finest restaurants in the city. Steven's generosity to waiters and maitre d's was legendary, and he merely had to arrive at a restaurant and it immediately became a more exciting place. When Steven became interested in a subject, he became passionate about it. It was this passion that led him to develop one of the world's finest Art Deco furniture and objects collections. Many items from the collection were exhibited at the Metropolitan Museum of Art. Steven was a beloved friend to many. He always tried to help those in need, with both financial support and advice. He was a quiet but most generous donor to many charities. He could analyze a problem, company or situation with uncanny insight. He loved life and lived his exactly as he wished. By virtue of his extraordinary life, which touched so many, he appeared to be a person whose life would go on forever, but sadly, it has ended far too soon. He fought his health battle privately and with great courage. The care and concern of his doctors and nurses at MSK was exemplary. Steven's funeral service will be held Monday, February 20 at 11:45am at Riverside Memorial Chapel, 76th Street and Amsterdam Avenue, New York."

2012-02-21T00:00:00Z,"MYERS--Robert J.,77, of Fairfield, CT and formerly of New York City died on February 14, 2012. He was born on December 31, 1934 in Grand Rapids, MI to the late Helen Oleson Myers and Charles Myers. Bob was the quint- essential Renaissance Man who measured success not by fame or profit but by having integrity and by the pleasure and challenges of his endeavors. By that definition, he was a tremendously successful man in each of his careers. His formal training as a bio-chemist began informally at age ten with a chemical laboratory in the family basement and as a teenaged Certified Pharmacist's Apprentice. When he was 13 an elderly man in Grand Rapids showed him a box of coins. That day he bought his first coin, a bronze of Augustus, and paid less than a dollar for it. Bob studied biochemistry at Indiana University supporting himself by starting a coin shop offering ancient and foreign coins. He joined the Army where he was the official Signal Corps photographer. Because of his expertise in bio-lab work, Cornell Medical College brought him to New York to do medical research until the mid 1970's. All this time he was building an extensive library on numismatics and ancient art. In his spare time, he appeared in Off Broadway productions. Bob Myers became an internationally recognized and respected dealer/appraiser of ancient coins and antiquities. He held his own auctions and obtained an auctioneer's license. Calling auctions in three languages in Switzerland was a challenge. Under his own name he issued 13 catalogues of ancient coins and antiquities. He was the author of several journal articles, prepared appraisals and was, on occasion, called by the IRS as expert witness. In the late 70s, he opened a food/fashion photography studio in Manhattan. In 1985 Bob became interested in sailing and joined the Penfield Sail & Power Squadron in Fairfield, CT serving as Commander. He loved sailing Long Island Sound in his 32' yawl, ""Njord."" Robert Myers was a man of exceptional generosity, intelligence and wit, the combination of which was irresistible. He had that rare quality of making everyone feel like royalty, tapping into their interests which by reason of his all-embracing knowledge were his as well. He was passionately devoted to his children and grandchildren, always seeing them as people, not just kids. They were adoringly enthralled in discussions of spiders or starfish, in beating grandpa at chess, handling ancient coins or learning to tie shoelaces in the weird Myers' double loop. He is survived by his life partner of 36 years, Rita Ortiga Waterman to whom he wrote, You are half of my life and all of my love;"" brothers Richard (Diane), and Jim (Nicole); children Charles Myers and Gina DeVries (Doug); daughter-in-law Nancy Lynn Myers; grandchildren Ty (Shannon), Brad (Marisol), Sarah (Aaron), Andy and Derek; great-grandchildren Brooklyn, Jaxon, Piper, Britney and Stephanie; nephews Anthony and Benjamin; former wife Patsy Downs.

She also documents Fischer's inner turmoil, which in later years prompted him to live in exile in Japan and Iceland and to give voice to a worldview rife with conspiracy theories and anti-Semitism, despite his Jewish background. ''What happened?'' A. O. Scott asked in The New York Times. The film, he wrote, ''tactfully but strongly posits a connection between the genius he brought to an infinitely complex game and the madness that defined his relationship to just about everything else.''

2012-02-21T00:00:00Z,"GUTTENBERG--William S. (Bill) was born on October 9, 1922, at Barnert Hospital, Paterson, NJ. He graduated from Paterson School No. 13, and then Eastside High in 1940. Bill's activities included being Editor-in-Chief of the Senior Mirror and Editor-inChief of the newspaper, Criterion, as well as being an active member of the Math Club, band, orchestra and various other clubs. He also wrote a weekly column about high school for the Paterson Evening News. Bill graduated from Newark College of Engineering (now known as New Jersey Institute of Technology-NJIT) in 1944 with a BS degree in electrical engineering. There, his activities included being Editor-in-Chief of the Technician and Associate Editor of the Nucleus. He was also on the Honors Option. Bill served in France and Germany with the Ninth Division, US Army, from 1944 to 1945. Prior to crossing the Rhine River in March 1945, he was wounded twice, for which he was awarded a Purple Heart with Oak Leaf Cluster. Bill was employed by Bogue Electric Company from 1944 to 1972, except for the period when he was in the Armed Forces, rising from Test Engineer to President in 1964. In the early 1970's, Guttenberg led a team to design motors and controls for an all-electric car with a range comparable to its gas engine counterpart. It soon became apparent that it was not possible with the state-of-the art batteries available then and still today. As the shortage of gasoline and the lines at the stations disappeared, interest in electric vehicles waned. During his time at Bogue, Bill was noted for designing and developing high-frequency generators for both the US Navy and the Army Corps of Engineers. He left Bogue in August 1972 to form his own company, Wilco Electric Inc., which he ran until his recent retirement. Bill established a Scholarship fund to permanently endow some twenty scholarships at NJIT for the disabled, for the Honors College, and for students from Paterson and other New Jersey inner-cities. In 1990, NJIT recognized Bill's contributions to the school and his advocacy for the physically and developmentally disabled population by naming its five-story, 150,000 square foot building the WILLIAM S. GUTTENBERG INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY CENTER. Then, in 2000, Bill was named OUTSTANDING ALUMNUS, and in 2008, he received an honorary DOCTOR of SCIENCE degree. Bill was among the group of five parents who, in 1978, established SPECTRUM for LIVING, an organization that devoted itself to the care of the developmentally-disabled population. Today SPECTRUM serves over 700 clients, an ICF, 14 Group Homes, five Apartments and six Adult Training Centers. Bill expanded the special-service activities of the JCC on the PALISADES with generous donations. The JCC responded by naming those services the GUTTENBERG CENTER for SPECIAL SERVICES. Bill was married to Adele Rita Basch, daughter of Fred and Natalie Basch of Teaneck for 58 years. They had two children, Frances Robin and Charles Gary. His wife and children predeceased him. In 2009, he married Aden Maza Marbratu of Addis Ababa. He is survived by his wife and two stepsons, Hennock and Simon. Funeral Services will be held 10:30am Tuesday at Gutterman and Musicant, 402 Park Street, Hackensack, NJ. With interment at the New Cedar Park Cemetery in Paramus.

Born on August 28, 1916, he was the son of Jerome H. Schloss and Evelyn Gomprecht Schloss. Beloved husband of Ann (Pearson) Schloss and the late Louise (Filer) Schloss, father of Edwin Walter Schloss, Stephanie Schloss Scott and Samuel Wennberg. He was the brother of Marjorie Isaac, grandfather of Katie and Emily Schloss; James Scott; Claire, Lenna, and Maren Wennberg. Mr. Schloss grew up in Manhattan, attended Franklin School and the New York Stock Exchange Institute, where he studied under Benjamin Graham. He enlisted in the Army on December 8, 1942, rising to the rank of Second Lieutenant. He served in Iran as part of the US Signal Corps, finishing out his wartime service at the Pentagon. At the end of WWII, he was invited by Benjamin Graham to join the firm of Graham Newman as a securities analyst. In 1955 Mr. Schloss set up his own investment management partnership, Walter J. Schloss Associates. His son, Edwin, joined the company in 1973. Walter managed investments with utmost integrity and a commitment to his clients. He retired in 2002 at the age of 87. Warren Buffett referred to Walter as a super investor. In his 2006 Letter to Shareholders, Buffet said: Let me end this section by telling you about one of the good guys of Wall Street, my long-time friend Walter Schloss, who last year turned 90. From 1956 to 2002, Walter managed a remarkably successful investment partnership, from which he took not a dime unless his investors made money. My admiration for Walter, it should be noted, is not based on hindsight. A full fifty years ago, Walter was my sole recommendation to a St. Louis family who wanted an honest and able investment manager. Mr. Schloss has been profiled in numerous financial journals including Barrons, Forbes, and Fortune. His investment archive is housed at Columbia University. He served as Treasurer of Freedom House. Walter Schloss had an insatiable curiosity about the world. His business and personal integrity is legendary. He was a proud New Yorker, an inveterate NY Yankees fan, a bird watcher in his beloved Central Park, and excelled at bridge. In 2000, while on a tour of France, he met Ann Pearson, whom he married in 2001. Their shared enjoyment of travel, theater, and family get-togethers brought them a decade of happiness. Above all, he was dedicated to his family. A private service will be held for the family. A reception for family and friends will be scheduled at a later date.

2012-02-21T00:00:00Z,"MINER--Hon. Roger J. The New York Law School community mourns the passing of distinguished alumnus Hon. Roger J. Miner '56, who died at his home in Greenport, NY on February 18, 2012. Miner was a judge of the United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit whose illustrious career earned him mentions as a possible nominee for the U.S. Supreme Court. After graduating cum laude from New York Law School, where he was Managing Editor of the Law Review, Judge Miner was admitted to practice in New York and in the United States Court of Military Appeals. Serving on active military duty from 1956 to 1959, he was awarded the Commendation Ribbon with Medal Pendant for his work on the revision of the Manual for Courts-Martial. He later served with the Army Reserve and was discharged in 1964 with the rank of captain in the Judge Advocate General's Corps. In 1959, Judge Miner joined his father, Abram Miner '26, in private practice in Hudson, NY. He was later named Corporation Counsel for the City of Hudson and served as the Assistant District Attorney for Columbia County. He was the Columbia County District Attorney from 1968 to 1975. Judge Miner was elected a Supreme Court justice for New York's Third Judicial District in 1976. President Ronald Reagan appointed him to the United States District Court for the Northern District of New York in 1981 and to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit in 1985. He assumed senior status in the Second Circuit in 1997. Judge Miner taught at New York Law School and Albany Law School. He was a former trustee of New York Law School, which awarded him an honorary degree in 1989. In 2003, the Law School honored Judge Miner at a gala event that included the unveiling of a portrait of him and the Law School's acceptance of the donation of his papers. The Law School community will remember Judge Miner for his courage, wisdom, and dedicated service to the law. We extend our condolences to his wife, Jacqueline, and his sons, brother, and grandchildren. Arthur N. Abbey, Chairman of the Board of Trustees; Carol A. Buckler, Interim Dean"
2012-02-21T00:00:00Z,"BARNES--Anne Utley, MD, 1926-2012. Age 85, of Feasterville, PA, on February 18, 2012, loving wife of the late Rev. Sidney Barnes, formerly Virginia Anne Utley of Nashville, TN. A 1944 graduate of Isaac Litton High School, undergraduate and medical college at Vanderbilt University in 1948 and '55.

2012-02-21T00:00:00Z,"One of the most agonizing spots in medicine is the ''transplant list.'' When I've referred patients for organ transplant - heart, liver, kidney - it is the start of an anguished wait. The clock ticks for my patient as we watch her clinical status decline, all the while harboring that excruciating hope that someone will die soon enough to make an organ available. In the case of kidney donation, which can come from a live donor, it is the desperate hope that someone will decide to make this enormous personal sacrifice. Some of my patients have died waiting, which is, sadly, not an unusual outcome. It is estimated that 18 patients on the waiting list in America die every day. In the United States, as in many countries, we rely on a simple system of altruism, or what might be called the opt-in approach. We hope that people will sign organ donor cards because they think it is the right thing to do, or that families will consent to donation after a loved one has had brain death because it will help someone else. But these mechanisms do not result in nearly enough organs for all the patients who need them."

But from behind, Atlanta's Jeff Teague swats the shot away. The crowd perks up, and Teague lets rip a primal scream, going to each teammate on the floor and urging each one to increase his intensity. Seconds later, Collison drives again. This time Teague, a point guard in his first season as a starter for the Hawks, is whistled for his fourth foul, sending him to the bench. Atlanta goes on to end a three-game losing streak, mostly without Teague's help."

2012-02-22T00:00:00Z,"The Volcker Rule, and its limitations on bank trading, may have the unintended effect of dividing the world back into investment banks and commercial banks. The unusual twist here is that Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley may end up stuck on the wrong side of the fence, treated under the law as commercial banks instead of the investment banks they once were. The backdrop to this issue is that it is increasingly clear that banks are simply unable to make as much money from proprietary and other trading businesses as they did before the financial crisis. Take Goldman Sachs. In 2007, Goldman had revenue of $7.6 billion from traditional investment banking, but $31.2 billion in revenue from trading-related operations. Last year, Goldman had just $17.3 billion in revenue related to trading operations."

In 2004, just as Beverly's career as a painter was taking off, her mother died, requiring her to make good on her pledge to Renee, then a 44-year-old who functioned at the level of a third grader. This documentary from Steven Ascher and Jeanne Jordan follows Beverly as she moves Renee, above, from her lifelong home in Greensboro, N.C., to Arizona, where Beverly lived and worked, and then back again to be closer to family. Renee eventually settles into an assisted-living apartment complex to live independently, something unthinkable when her mother was alive. 7:30 A.M.

2012-02-22T00:00:00Z,"For Sean Nevins, as for most serious beer drinkers, freshness is crucial to the quality of the brew. Too often, beer suffers as it is shipped from brewery to warehouse to retailer, sitting for days or weeks along the way. Mr. Nevins, who had a career starting new businesses for large companies, decided to do something about the problem and spent a year and a half putting his expertise to the test. The result is Beerjobber, a Web site where consumers can order beer by the case, shipped in a week to 10 days directly from each brewery. So far, the site features several dozen American craft breweries, including Blue Point, on Long Island; Twisted Pine, of Boulder, Colo.; Appalachian, in Harrisburg, Pa.; Mad River, of Blue Lake, Calif.; and Philadelphia Brewing (above). Mr. Nevins, based in Conshohocken, Pa., said he could deliver beer to 38 states, as well as the District of Columbia. ''Whenever a new consumer registers, we check the ZIP code to make sure we can legally ship to them,'' he said. Most of the brands are small and local. ''We don't want to specialize in the beers like Sierra Nevada and Sam Adams that you can buy everywhere,'' Mr. Nevins said."

It is the crown jewel in the new Borough Hall Skyscraper Historic District [PDF] along Court Street, created last year by the Landmarks Preservation Commission and sustained Feb. 1 by the City Council. In describing 75 Livingston Street, developed by Jacob Adelman, the commission said it was a work of ''considerable elegance and sophistication,'' with ''projecting pavilions, chamfered corners and secondary setbacks that give the building visual interest well beyond what was required by the zoning regulations and equal to that of any skyscraper in greater New York.''"

2012-02-22T00:00:00Z,"GUTTENBERG--William S. (Bill) was born on October 9, 1922, at Barnert Hospital, Paterson, NJ. He graduated from Paterson School No. 13, and then Eastside High in 1940. Bill's activities included being Editor-in-Chief of the Senior Mirror and Editor-inChief of the newspaper, Criterion, as well as being an active member of the Math Club, band, orchestra and various other clubs. He also wrote a weekly column about high school for the Paterson Evening News. Bill graduated from Newark College of Engineering (now known as New Jersey Institute of Technology-NJIT) in 1944 with a BS degree in electrical engineering. There, his activities included being Editor-in-Chief of the Technician and Associate Editor of the Nucleus. He was also on the Honors Option. Bill served in France and Germany with the Ninth Division, US Army, from 1944 to 1945. Prior to crossing the Rhine River in March 1945, he was wounded twice, for which he was awarded a Purple Heart with Oak Leaf Cluster. Bill was employed by Bogue Electric Company from 1944 to 1972, except for the period when he was in the Armed Forces, rising from Test Engineer to President in 1964. In the early 1970's, Guttenberg led a team to design motors and controls for an all-electric car with a range comparable to its gas engine counterpart. It soon became apparent that it was not possible with the state-of-the art batteries available then and still today. As the shortage of gasoline and the lines at the stations disappeared, interest in electric vehicles waned. During his time at Bogue, Bill was noted for designing and developing high-frequency generators for both the US Navy and the Army Corps of Engineers. He left Bogue in August 1972 to form his own company, Wilco Electric Inc., which he ran until his recent retirement. Bill established a Scholarship fund to permanently endow some twenty scholarships at NJIT for the disabled, for the Honors College, and for students from Paterson and other New Jersey inner-cities. In 1990, NJIT recognized Bill's contributions to the school and his advocacy for the physically and developmentally disabled population by naming its five-story, 150,000 square foot building the WILLIAM S. GUTTENBERG INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY CENTER. Then, in 2000, Bill was named OUTSTANDING ALUMNUS, and in 2008, he received an honorary DOCTOR of SCIENCE degree. Bill was among the group of five parents who, in 1978, established SPECTRUM for LIVING, an organization that devoted itself to the care of the developmentally-disabled population. Today SPECTRUM serves over 700 clients, an ICF, 14 Group Homes, five Apartments and six Adult Training Centers. Bill expanded the special-service activities of the JCC on the PALISADES with generous donations. The JCC responded by naming those services the GUTTENBERG CENTER for SPECIAL SERVICES. Bill was married to Adele Rita Basch, daughter of Fred and Natalie Basch of Teaneck for 58 years. They had two children, Frances Robin and Charles Gary. His wife and children predeceased him. In 2009, he married Aden Maza Marbratu of Addis Ababa. He is survived by his wife and two stepsons, Hennock and Simon. Funeral Services were handled by Gutterman and Musicant, Hackensack, NJ and interment took place in the New Cedar Park Cemetery, Paramus, NJ. Memorial contributions may be made to Spectrum for Living, 210 River Vale Road, River Vale, NJ 07675."

2012-02-23T00:00:00Z,"9 P.M. (13) DON GIOVANNI Mariusz Kwiecien makes his Metropolitan Opera debut as Mozart's promiscuous nobleman in this new production from Michael Grandage, originally broadcast in theaters on Oct. 29 and presented here by ''Great Performances at the Met.'' Marina Rebeka and Mojca Erdmann sing the roles of Donna Anna and Zerlina, two of Giovanni's conquests; Barbara Frittoli (above, with Mr. Kwiecien) is the fiery Donna Elvira, his spurned lover out for revenge; Ramón Vargas is Donna Anna's fiancé, Don Ottavio; and Luca Pisaroni is Giovanni's hapless manservant, Leporello. Mr. Kwiecien, who injured himself at a dress rehearsal and was replaced for opening night and two other performances, ''looked nimble on his feet, sang robustly and threw himself into the title role,'' Anthony Tommasini wrote in The New York Times. ''Whatever one's take on Mr. Kwiecien's portrayal of a role he considers his calling card, his performance was a triumph of physical rehabilitation and artistic determination.'' Mr. Tommasini called the orchestra's performance under Fabio Luisi, the Met's principal conductor, ''a fleet, clear-textured and wonderfully natural account of this multilayered, ingenious score.'' 7 A.M. (Cinemax) BIG FISH (2003) Albert Finney plays Edward Bloom (Ewan McGregor is his youthful version), a traveling salesman from Alabama who has spent a lifetime shading and embellishing the truth in this fantasy from Tim Burton, adapted from the novel by Daniel Wallace. Billy Crudup is Bloom's estranged son, Will, a reporter in Paris who has been summoned home for a deathbed reconciliation, during which Edward elaborates on his biography. Edward's doctor asks: Wouldn't Will prefer to believe that on the day of his birth his father was subduing a legendary catfish rather than selling household gadgets in Wichita? ''The movie insists that the only possible answer is yes, and thus chooses maudlin moonshine over engagement with the difficulties of real life, which is exactly the choice Edward has made,'' A. O. Scott wrote in The Times. ''In their eagerness to celebrate Edward's grand spirit, the filmmakers wind up diminishing it, declining to explore the causes or the costs of his addiction to fantasy.'' Danny Elfman received an Oscar nomination for best original score."

2012-02-23T00:00:00Z,"LONDON -- Britons sometimes celebrate sports as a metaphor for life itself, from the possibly apocryphal assertion by the Duke of Wellington that the battle of Waterloo was won on the playing fields of Eton to the pepperings of cricket in political analysis: a politician ''on the back foot'' is, usually, deemed to be on the defensive; the front foot denotes muscular attack. But, if those comparisons bear scrutiny, then events on the nation's soccer pitches in recent times offer a more painful conclusion, conjuring questions of race and identity many decades after Britain embarked on a long and tortured transformation from a largely white society to one in which ethnic diversity has come to claim an ambiguous position, somewhere between a commonplace and a stubborn source of contention, hatred and even violence."

The 260-employee company, which is based in Wilmington, Mass., 17 miles north of Boston, was facing increasing competition. Its chief executive, Mike Woronka, believed a more aggressive approach to sales might lure business from his seven direct competitors and also expand Action's territory. But targeted sales, Mr. Woronka said, are unusual in his industry, where account managers generally push gently and gradually for new business. He needed to decide whether he could train his existing account managers to be more proactive or whether he would need to hire a full-time sales representative to pursue new accounts.

Jack was the Vice President of CSA when Governor Hugh Carey was persuaded to recognize it as a union shop and he stood beside the Governor when legislation was signed making that a fact.

Devoted big sister to baby brother, Max Desfor, and adored aunt to many nieces and nephews. Sally celebrated her 100th birthday in June in great spirits and made a speech thanking everyone there. Sally was a very talented sculptor, working with stone until her 94th year. Sally was, and will always be, an inspiration to all of us never giving up, never complaining and Sally always kept her wicked sense of humor. Because you have been with us over 100 years, it is hard for me to believe you won't be on the phone with me every day, asking about all of us, including Angel. We all love you very much Mother you will be in our hearts forever. Rest in peace next to Daddy. Your devoted children, grandchildren, great grandchildren and all who knew you."
2012-02-23T00:00:00Z,"AT the Berlin Film Festival earlier this month, Diane Kruger accessorized her Giambattista Valli couture gown with a black gold and diamond cuff around one ear. The Repossi ear cuff was surely a statement piece, if, at more than $10,000, not an accessible one. The earpieces that the Norwegian designer Bjorg creates are within reach, and kind of fabulous: a bit surreal, strangely sexy. One gold style wraps the ear with multiple hanging chains; another doubles as a bracelet. If you think of yourself as a fashion risk-taker, pull back your hair and accessorize with this horsehair pair. There's a statement, even a mesmerizing one. Bjorg horsehair ear cuffs, $175 each at Henrik Vibskov, 456 Broome Street; (212) 219-3950."

2012-02-23T00:00:00Z,"The last Broadway production of ''Death of a Salesman'' was only 13 years ago, starring Brian Dennehy in a Tony-winning performance as Willy Loman, yet audience interest in Arthur Miller's landmark drama appears higher than ever. A new ''Salesman'' arrived on Broadway last week, starring Oscar winner Philip Seymour Hoffman (''Capote'') as Willy and the movie star Andrew Garfield (''The Amazing Spider-Man'') as his son Biff, and grossed $613,569 for its first six preview performances - more money per performance than the early previews for either the Dennehy production in 1999 or its predecessor, the Dustin Hoffman-led ''Salesman'' in 1984. In its first week at the box office, this new ''Salesman'' beat every other play on Broadway except for the hit ''War Horse,'' which won the 2011 Tony for best play and grossed $926,111 for its full eight performances last week. The maximum possible gross for the six performances of ''Salesman'' last week was $731,760; the production took in 84 percent of that amount, an extremely high share for a play."

As her grief-stricken father, Master Sgt. Jerry Ensminger, above, a Marine Corps drill instructor, searched for answers, he made a shocking discovery: The drinking water at Camp Lejeune, the North Carolina base where he and his family had lived for years, was highly contaminated by toxic chemicals. Now, 25 years after the wells were closed, it is estimated that nearly one million Marines and their families may have been exposed to high levels of carcinogens through the water, and only a fraction of the base's former residents are aware of the danger. Lawrence O'Donnell hosts this presentation of a documentary by Rachel Libert and Tony Hardmon that was shown at the 2011 Tribeca Film Festival. 8:30 A.M. (USA) FROST/NIXON (2008) In May 1977 the British television personality David Frost (played by Michael Sheen, below) faced off against Richard M. Nixon (Frank Langella), three years after Nixon left the presidency in disgrace. Mr. Frost was gambling with his money and future; Nixon, with public perception (though he received $600,000 and 10 percent of the program's profits). The result was blockbuster ratings to rival those of ''Happy Days,'' starring Ron Howard, who directed this adaptation of Peter Morgan's play. Writing in The New York Times, Manohla Dargis described the film as ''a soothing, agreeably amusing experience, more palliative than purgative,'' adding that Mr. Langella and Mr. Sheen, who originated their roles on the London stage and later repeated them on Broadway, were first rate."

2012-02-24T00:00:00Z,"-Broadway divas were forever immortalized in Woody Allen's 1994 film ''Bullets Over Broadway'' by Dianne Wiest's Oscar-winning performance as Helen Sinclair, an aging grande dame who silenced sweet nothings from her amorous playwright by repeating theatrically, ''don't speak!'' Now Mr. Allen wants to have another go with Helen and ''Bullets'' - and Broadway: He is adapting his original screenplay, written with Douglas McGrath, into a stage musical that producers are aiming to open on Broadway in 2013. The producers, Julian Schlossberg and Letty Aronson, said on Thursday that the show would feature existing music from the period - Prohibition-era 1920s - in addition to the book by Mr. Allen. Like the movie, which was nominated for six other Academy Awards, the musical centers on an aspiring playwright (played by John Cusack in the film) forced to cast a mobster's no-talent girlfriend (Jennifer Tilly) in his show to find financing to produce it. The creative team, casting and performance schedule will be announced later."

2012-02-24T00:00:00Z,"1:08 p.m. | Updated The conductor Kurt Masur, 84 and increasingly frail, has withdrawn from performances of Beethoven's ''Missa Solemnis'' with the Boston Symphony Orchestra on Thursday, Friday and Saturday in Boston and on March 6 at Carnegie Hall because of his ''current physical condition,'' the orchestra said in a statement without elaborating. Mr. Masur's assistant, Stefana Atlas, said a combination of vision problems and the toll of age had led him to cancel. ''His condition is not any different than it's been before,'' Ms. Atlas said in a telephone interview. ''But obviously he realized it was not good enough to meet the demands for the 'Missa Solemnis.' It's a very difficult piece. For him he says it's a mountain of a work. He felt he was not physically fit to attack this piece.'' It is the second consecutive year that the Boston Symphony has lost a marquee conductor for Carnegie appearances. Last season, James Levine, its music director at the time, pulled out of three concerts because of failing health. The statement said that Mr. Masur, a former music director of the New York Philharmonic, would go forward with performances with various orchestras in Israel, Germany, China and France in March and April. John Oliver, who conducts the Tanglewood Festival Chorus, which will also participate, will lead the Boston performances, and Mr. Masur's replacement for Carnegie has yet to be determined, the orchestra said."
2012-02-24T00:00:00Z,"KABUL, Afghanistan -- The potential scope of the fallout from the burning of several copies of the Koran by American military personnel this week became chillingly clear on Thursday as a man in an Afghan Army uniform shot and killed two American soldiers, while a crowd nearby protested the desecration of the Muslim holy book. In the third successive day of deadly violence over the Koran burning, seven Afghans were killed in three provinces on Thursday and many more were injured, most in skirmishes with Afghan security forces. The Afghan government, which had responded slowly on the first day of protests, was in high gear on Thursday as officials tried to tamp down emotions ahead of the Friday day of prayer. Western and Afghan authorities feared that there could be emotional demonstrations after the prayer that the Taliban and extremist elements would try to exploit."

The second season frequently doubled the average prime-time rating for PBS and, speaking to the strongly favorable word of mouth the show has generated, exceeded the average overnight metered market rating for the first season by 25 percent. Season 3 -- which will feature the addition of Shirley MacLaine to the cast as the American mother of Elizabeth McGovern's Countess of Grantham -- is being filmed. (Ms. MacLaine is now on the set, and according to Vulture, is ''already tweeting Dowager Countess-worthy observations,'' including the news that ''I have Internet but this hotel has no phone service or TV. I feel I am on another planet.'') New episodes are scheduled to be broadcast in September in Britain, with the United States premiere to follow early next year."

So when the lutenist Hank Heijink was listed in an announcement of Bach in the Subways Day, on March 21, Bach's 327th birthday, you could only imagine Mr. Heijink plinking away in some subway station against the roar of the trains. But it turns out that Mr. Heijink, more often heard playing the deeper-voiced theorbo in early-music performances in New York and elsewhere, will appear only in the followup concert, ''Happy Birthday Bach!,'' at Christ and St. Stephen's Church, on West 69th Street, on March 25. The musicians actually performing in the subways will be mainly cellists. The event is being organized by Dale Henderson, a cellist whose own underground performances have evolved into a standing program, Bach in the Subways. Donations will not be solicited, in line with Mr. Henderson's belief that ''the experience is infinitely more valuable when money is removed from the equation.''"

Felicity Jones plays Miranda, Prospera's doted-on daughter; Djimon Hounsou is the slave Caliban; and Ben Whishaw is Ariel, the puckish spirit. Alan Cumming, as the treacherous Sebastian, and Chris Cooper, as Antonio, round out the ensemble; Tom Conti is the kindly Gonzalo; David Strathairn is King Alonso; and Russell Brand and Alfred Molina are servants driven by drink and idleness to absurd visions of sovereignty. ''In this noisy, stormy adaptation, an energetic and for the most part excellent cast marshals considerable resources of wit, discipline and timing in a struggle against the hectic inventiveness that is, characteristically for Ms. Taymor, either the vehicle for interesting theatrical ideas or a sign of their absence,'' A. O. Scott wrote in The New York Times. ''But rather than cohere into a compellingly new -- or satisfyingly traditional -- rendering of the play, they slosh around, generating glimmers of insight, slivers of feeling and spasms of sensation, as well as empty dazzle and frustration.''

Hannelore was born in Berlin and raised in a home filled with art and music, subjects she continued to study throughout her life. She met her only true love, Czech born Rudolph, when she was a teenager in Vienna, with Europe on the brink of World War II. Hannelore and Rudolph escaped Nazi occupation to marry in Brussels in 1940. They soon settled in the United States, where they lived in love for the remainder of their lives. There they proudly raised a family of four children: Michael, Ronald (deceased), Thomas, and Wendy. American and European post war and contemporary art became a central interest in Hannelore's life. She was a collector, patron, museum trustee and great friend to artists, dealers and curators. She served on the Boards of the Guggenheim, Whitney, Brooklyn Museum, National Gallery of Art in Washington, The Israel Museum in Jerusalem, and the American Federation of Arts. Hannelore lived a life of passion and love for family and the arts. She travelled extensively. She was an avid music lover who played viola, and who attended countless performances of the Metropolitan Opera and the New York Philharmonic. She was a gracious host who welcomed family and friends to visit the beauty of her home, and share in the many stories of her vast experience. Hannelore is survived by three children, as well as ten grandchildren and eighteen-great grandchildren, who all brought great joy to her life. Services will be held Monday, February 27 at 11:00am at Frank Campbell Funeral Home, 1076 Madison Avenue, Manhattan, followed by a private family burial service at Mount Pleasant Cemetery in Westchester County."

2012-02-26T00:00:00Z,"WHEN the actress Da'Vine Joy Randolph first heard that the 1990 movie ''Ghost'' was being turned into a musical, she was more than a little skeptical that the special effects in the supernatural romance -- Patrick Swayze walking through solid objects, a penny floating toward Demi Moore -- would work onstage. '' 'I don't know about that,' '' she recalled saying in a sassy tone last fall as she read an audition notice for a Broadway production of the musical, which opened in London in July. Still, Ms. Randolph had a freshly minted master's degree from the Yale School of Drama and no acting credits in New York -- so why not aim for a small part as one of the sisters of Oda Mae Brown, the sometime psychic that Whoopi Goldberg won an Academy Award playing in the film? The stakes went up when Ms. Randolph, who was ''far from a die-hard fan of the movie,'' was invited to try out as the understudy for the actress playing Oda Mae -- an actress who had yet to be chosen, but who Ms. Randolph assumed would be ''a big name, a star'' or else Sharon D. Clarke, who played the part in London. For the audition she memorized 20 pages of dialogue and sang two numbers, all the while feeling underprepared. She left certain that she would not be called back."

Few have done so as effectively as Stanley Kubrick, who visited the scorched French trenches in ''PATHS OF GLORY.'' Part of BAM Cinématek's two-part series Jim Thompson: A Hell of a Writer -- Thompson wrote the taut screenplay for this 1957 film with Kubrick and Calder Willingham -- the movie (at the Brooklyn Academy of Music on Tuesday) displays Kubrick's technical wizardry while evincing a warmth elusive in his later work. Kirk Douglas portrays Colonel Dax, a man assigned to lead his troops on a suicidal mission so that his general will be promoted. When his unit is defeated -- in a stunningly raw battlefield tableau that puts ''Full Metal Jacket'' to shame -- three of his men are court-martialed, and Dax must defend them. Kubrick's wide angles, ''Shining''-style tracking shots and high-contrast interiors abound. But infusing the whole is a gritty, articulate compassion for the soldier in the field.

2012-02-26T00:00:00Z,"THE year 1998 was a significant one for East Nashville, an area that comprises several small neighborhoods directly across the Cumberland River from the Tennessee capital's downtown. The locale, which had already fallen on tough times, got even shoddier when a tornado ripped through the community, wreaking havoc on its infrastructure. Yet, in hindsight, the disaster also brought opportunity. After an influx of insurance money, creative types began flocking to the area thanks to cheap rents; young entrepreneurs followed, slowly transforming it into a hub for Nashville's culturally savvy. Although East Nashville was also hit hard by the 2010 flood that inundated the city (though not as badly as downtown), its rebound has continued. Perhaps thanks to all these misfortunes, it has also developed a strong sense of solidarity.

2012-02-26T00:00:00Z,"IT has already been a huge crowd pleaser in San Francisco and Paris, and now ''THE STEINS COLLECT: MATISSE, PICASSO AND THE PARISIAN AVANT-GARDE'' is coming to New York, where it opens at the Metropolitan Museum of Art on Tuesday. The exhibition focuses on Gertrude Stein and her brothers, Leo and Michael (as well as Michael's wife Sarah), who settled in Paris in the early years of the 20th century and befriended artists like Matisse and Picasso. Their home became a famous gathering place where they held weekly salons for artists and collectors, scholars, dealers and aristocrats to see the latest examples of what was being produced during those years. And over time the family amassed a formidable collection of paintings, drawings, prints and sculptures that offers a snapshot of a seminal era in the history of art. The exhibition showcases the Steins' collection, with both well-known and obscure images that total around 200 paintings, sculpture and works on paper. The show begins with the art Leo Stein collected when he moved to Paris in 1903 -- paintings and prints by Cézanne, Degas, Toulouse-Lautrec, Manet and Renoir -- and goes on to chronicle the family's acquisitions in subsequent years, examining the close relationships they formed with many of the artists they encountered.

There they proudly raised a family of four children: Michael, Ronald (deceased), Thomas, and Wendy. American and European post war and contemporary art became a central interest in Hannelore's life. She was a collector, patron, museum trustee and great friend to artists, dealers and curators. She served on the Boards of the Guggenheim, Whitney, Brooklyn Museum, National Gallery of Art in Washington, The Israel Museum in Jerusalem, and the American Federation of Arts. Hannelore lived a life of passion and love for family and the arts. She travelled extensively. She was an avid music lover who played viola, and who attended countless performances of the Metropolitan Opera and the New York Philharmonic. She was a gracious host who welcomed family and friends to visit the beauty of her home, and share in the many stories of her vast experience. Hannelore is survived by three children, as well as ten grandchildren and eighteen-great grandchildren, who all brought great joy to her life. Services will be held Monday, February 27 at 11:00am at Frank Campbell Funeral Home, 1076 Madison Avenue, Manhattan, followed by a private family burial service at Mount Pleasant Cemetery in Westchester County."

That happens when his company, DOUG ELKINS CHOREOGRAPHY, ETC., appears during Stripped/Dressed, this year's 92nd Street Y Harkness Dance Festival. Doug Varone, the festival's curator, has invited choreographers to take a dance, strip it of its costumes, lighting and theatrical effects, and expose its conceptual bare bones. Then it gets put back together to be performed ''dressed'' in its complete form. Mr. Elkins may be ideally suited for such a process, for he is a choreographic collagist fond of juxtaposing many source materials. Take ''Mo(or)town Redux,'' the piece he's deconstructing at the Y. A new version of a dance he created in 1990, it's inspired, in part, by José Limón's ''Moor's Pavane,'' a modern-dance classic of 1949 based on ''Othello.'' Mr. Elkins's dance also celebrates the passionate American pop music of Motown.

The article quoted a spokesman for Mission Essential who disputed that, saying the company had been making biweekly payments to the family and would continue to do so for 29 years. After the article was published, the Mission Essential spokesman, Sean Ruston, contacted The Times to say that in addition to his initial rebuttal he could also provide documentation of the payments. When The Times contacted the family about the documents, a family member confirmed that Mission Essential Personnel had indeed been paying the family the annuity.

George Clooney is up for best actor for ''The Descendants,'' but oddsmakers are predicting that Jean Dujardin will take home the Oscar for his role as a silent-movie star in ''The Artist,'' the black-and-white tribute to a golden age in Hollywood. That film is expected to win best picture as well, while its director, Michel Hazanavicius, is favored for the directing award. Viola Davis is the top best-actress contender for her turn as a courageous maid in ''The Help,'' though Meryl Streep, as Margaret Thatcher in ''The Iron Lady,'' could make it a close race. And in the best-supporting category, Christopher Plummer is expected to win as a father who comes out of the closet near the end of his life in ''Beginners,'' as is Octavia Spencer, who portrayed another determined maid in ''The Help.'' ''A Separation,'' the domestic drama set in Iran, is favored to win for best foreign film. The countdown begins at 1:30 on E!; at 4 on the TV Guide Channel; and at 6 on Channel 11.

(Sho2) THE KING'S SPEECH (2010) Colin Firth, below, in the role for which he won the best-actor Oscar last year, portrays Albert Frederick Arthur George, or Bertie, as his family called him, the shy second son of George V of Britain (Michael Gambon) in this film from Tom Hooper. Geoffrey Rush is Lionel Logue, the speech therapist who helps him conquer his debilitating stutter. And Helena Bonham Carter is Elizabeth, Bertie's wife and staunch support system, who can't quite stomach Wallis Simpson (Eve Best), the American divorcée who leads Bertie's older brother, David (Guy Pearce), to abdicate as Edward VIII. ''It isn't exactly 'Pygmalion,' not least because Mr. Hooper has no intention of satirizing the caste system that is one of this movie's biggest draws,'' Manohla Dargis, writing in The New York Times, said of the film, which received 12 nominations and earned Mr. Hooper an Oscar as best director. ''Like many entertainments of this pop-historical type, 'The King's Speech' wears history lightly no matter how heavy the crown.'' The film also won Academy Awards for best picture and original screenplay (David Seidler)."

2012-02-26T00:00:00Z,"IN the 1960s and 1970s, the fashion designer Rudi Gernreich, his model and muse Peggy Moffitt, and Ms. Moffitt's husband, the renowned photographer William Claxton, were a dynamic and inseparable trio. Gernreich designed bold and often daring clothing that has come to epitomize the swinging '60s. Ms. Moffitt, above, inspired him and became the face and body (and hairdo) that we identify with his work. And Mr. Claxton brought it all to life in fashion shoots and in the film ''Basic Black.'' ''The Total Look: The Creative Collaboration Between Rudi Gernreich, Peggy Moffitt, and William Claxton,'' at the Museum of Contemporary Art Pacific Design Center satellite in West Hollywood (coincidentally not far from the original location of Gernreich's design studio), celebrates the work the three created together. Curated by Cameron Silver, the founder of the Los Angeles haute vintage boutique Decades, the exhibition features pieces from Ms. Moffitt's personal collection, many of which have never been on display before. ''The Total Look'' is on view at the Pacific Design Center until May 20. BROOKE HODGE"

The New Jersey rapper JOE BUDDEN hasn't released a major-label album in almost a decade, but has used mixtapes and the Internet to become a true hip-hop cult act, with a rabid coterie of followers who are fans of his self-flagellation, polysyllabic rhymes and brusque attitude. Over two nights at Irving Plaza he'll perform his series of lauded, sometimes thrilling ''Mood Muzik'' mixtapes (which he's been releasing since 2005) in their entirety -- Nos. 1 and 2 on Sunday night, Nos. 3 and 4 on Monday night. Mr. Budden is a modern version of the old regional rap star, except his region is mostly online, where his songs cause stirs, and where his mouthy Twitter can get him into trouble. A member of the brawny Eminem-approved crew Slaughterhouse, he's quick with wordplay and punch lines, but the true stars of his songs are feelings. When he's mad at a woman, he examines his own culpability. When he's beefing with other rappers, he indicts himself.

2012-02-26T00:00:00Z,"ROTHENBERG--Michael. The world tragically lost a champion for people in communities in need in our society. Michael Rothenberg, age 47, was the executive director of New York Lawyers for the Public Interest, a center where lawyers and community organizers came together to create lasting social change. He oversaw a talented team of attorneys and community activists who have fought to remove toxins from public schools, gain park space for communities overflowing with waste treatment plants, make sure families of union workers killed on 9/11 received necessary aid, give students with disabilities full educational access, and open emergency rooms to all without regard to language barriers that restricted the quality of medical care. Always facing economic barriers to creating a broad-scale institution, Michael was relentlessly creative in finding new ways of raising money to support NYLPI, and he was very successful: luncheons, golf tournaments, raffles, art shows, capital campaigns, government grants he was relentless because his goals were so important to him and to his clients. Rothenberg used several tools at once to effect change: litigation, organization, the media, and direct political contacts all in order to get NYLPI's clients' voices heard. The New York Times Company recognized the genius of Michael's approach in 2010 when it awarded NYLPI one of its top three Nonprofit Excellence Awards, which recognize management excellence in the city's nonprofit community, the first legal organization to be so recognized. He was a wonderfully thoughtful man, generous to his friends, and extremely proud of his talented wife Zerline Goodman, and their three children, Brice, Garon and Zaya. He was loved and will be terribly missed by all who knew him. Our world has lost someone of real worth who made a real impact.

2012-02-26T00:00:00Z,"THE popularity of ''The Devil Wears Prada'' -- both the execrable novel and the so-so movie -- spawned a small spate of what might be called assistant lit: books about monstrous bosses and the humiliations their underlings endure as the price for proximity to the powerful. The sharp-eyed playwright Leslye Headland now brings this topic to the stage with ''ASSISTANCE,'' about a cadre of young workers under the thumb of a powerful magnate. The play is one in a series Ms. Headland has written inspired by the seven deadly sins. The theme of ''Assistance'' is greed. New York audiences will be familiar with ''Bachelorette,'' another play from the series, inspired by gluttony, which made a splash a couple of seasons ago at the Second Stage Theater Uptown.

His formal training as a bio-chemist began informally at age ten with a chemical laboratory in the family basement and as a teenaged Certified Pharmacist's Apprentice. When he was 13 an elderly man in Grand Rapids showed him a box of coins. That day he bought his first coin, a bronze of Augustus, and paid less than a dollar for it. Bob studied biochemistry at Indiana University supporting himself by starting a coin shop offering ancient and foreign coins. He joined the Army where he was the official Signal Corps photographer. Because of his expertise in bio-lab work, Cornell Medical College brought him to New York to do medical research until the mid 1970's. All this time he was building an extensive library on numismatics and ancient art. In his spare time, he appeared in Off Broadway productions. Bob Myers became an internationally recognized and respected dealer/appraiser of ancient coins and antiquities. He held his own auctions and obtained an auctioneer's license. Calling auctions in three languages in Switzerland was a challenge. Under his own name he issued 13 catalogues of ancient coins and antiquities. He was the author of several journal articles, prepared appraisals and was, on occasion, called by the IRS as expert witness. In the late 70s, he opened a food/fashion photography studio in Manhattan. In 1985 Bob became interested in sailing and joined the Penfield Sail & Power Squadron in Fairfield, CT serving as Commander. He loved sailing Long Island Sound in his 32' yawl, ""Njord."" Robert Myers was a man of exceptional generosity, intelligence and wit, the combination of which was irresistible. He had that rare quality of making everyone feel like royalty, tapping into their interests which by reason of his all-embracing knowledge were his as well. He was passionately devoted to his children and grandchildren, always seeing them as people, not just kids. They were adoringly enthralled in discussions of spiders or starfish, in beating grandpa at chess, handling ancient coins or learning to tie shoelaces in the weird Myers' double loop. He is survived by his life partner of 36 years, Rita Ortiga Waterman to whom he wrote, You are half of my life and all of my love;"" brothers Richard (Diane), and Jim (Nicole); children Charles Myers and Gina DeVries (Doug); daughter-in-law Nancy Lynn Myers; grandchildren Ty (Shannon), Brad (Marisol), Sarah (Aaron), Andy and Derek; great-grandchildren Brooklyn, Jaxon, Piper, Britney and Stephanie; nephews Anthony and Benjamin; former wife Patsy Downs. A celebration of Robert Myers' life will be held at a later date. To sign an online register, please visit LeskoPolkeFuneralHome.com"
2012-02-26T00:00:00Z,"Draftniks are N.F.L. draft enthusiasts, speculators who prefer gathering information about rookie prospects to watching basketball or hockey or enjoying a more socially acceptable hobby like Dungeons and Dragons. Draftniks fuel a cottage industry of specialized programming, Web sites and magazines, and they helped turn the N.F.L. draft into a combination tailgate party and debutante ball, a late-April mini-Super Bowl without the bothersome game. The draftnik subculture has its own rituals, some fun and accessible for the layperson, others arcane and mysterious. Some activities can help the uninitiated dip their toes into the draftnik lifestyle. Be warned: in an egalitarian landscape with minimal separation between professional television analysts and some guy with old Auburn games on his DVR, one can easily go from curious newcomer to nationally recognized expert who gets 3 a.m. text messages about Mohamed Sanu in just a few weeks. Draftniks quickly reach the point at which baseball sabermetricians appear mainstream and virile by comparison, so proceed cautiously through the steps below."

Enter Bobby (Zach Galifianakis), a soulful, scatterbrained would-be mentor, and Noelle (Emma Roberts), a potential love interest, who both ease Craig's stay while also complicating it. Writing in The Times, A. O. Scott called this film, adapted from Ned Vizzini's novel by Anna Boden and Ryan Fleck, ''disarmingly gentle, sweet and whimsical,'' even if some of the brazenness and flair of the book had been lost. But, he added, ''the calm, helpful spirit of the film is also threaded with condescension: this is a movie made by grown-ups, who want to listen and help, to make sure that everyone has a good time, and that nobody gets hurt.'' Final analysis: ''The best I can say is that it's kind of a good movie.''"

2012-02-27T00:00:00Z,"When Ronda Storms, a Republican state senator in Florida, is accused of nanny-state-ism for her efforts on behalf of a sane diet, it's worth noting. When she introduced a bill to prevent people in Florida from spending food stamps on unhealthy items like candy, chips and soda, she broke ranks: few of her party have taken on Big Food. And as someone who has called for the defunding of an educational Planned Parenthood program and banning library book displays supporting Gay and Lesbian Pride Month, she is hardly in her party's left wing. Not surprisingly, she's faced criticism from every corner: Democrats think she's attacking poor people, and Republicans seeMichelle Obama. Soon after Storms proposed the bill, she told me, ''Coca-Cola and Kraft were in my office'' hating it. Yet she makes sense. ''It's just bad public policy to allow unfettered access to all kinds of food,'' she told me over the phone. ''Why should we cut all of these programs and continue to pay for people to use food stamps to buy potato chips, Oreos and Mountain Dew? The goal is to feed good food to hungry people.''"

Michael Rothenberg, age 47, was the executive director of New York Lawyers for the Public Interest, a center where lawyers and community organizers came together to create lasting social change. He oversaw a talented team of attorneys and community activists who have fought to remove toxins from public schools, gain park space for communities overflowing with waste treatment plants, make sure families of union workers killed on 9/11 received necessary aid, give students with disabilities full educational access, and open emergency rooms to all without regard to language barriers that restricted the quality of medical care. Always facing economic barriers to creating a broad-scale institution, Michael was relentlessly creative in finding new ways of raising money to support NYLPI, and he was very successful: luncheons, golf tournaments, raffles, art shows, capital campaigns, government grants he was relentless because his goals were so important to him and to his clients. Rothenberg used several tools at once to effect change: litigation, organization, the media, and direct political contacts all in order to get NYLPI's clients' voices heard. The New York Times Company recognized the genius of Michael's approach in 2010 when it awarded NYLPI one of its top three Nonprofit Excellence Awards, which recognize management excellence in the city's nonprofit community, the first legal organization to be so recognized.

(HBO Signature) THE AMERICAN (2010) Before ''The Descendants'' and ''The Ides of March'' brought him Oscar nominations in this latest awards season, George Clooney, above, played a gun-toting expatriate who arrives in a small Italian town after a mishap on his previous job and takes an assignment to build a custom weapon for a sexy assassin (Thekla Reuten). ''I'm out,'' he says at one point, intent on making the kind of human connection that his taciturn temperament and job -- as a hit man, perhaps -- have denied him until now. Soon he has made friends with a priest (Paolo Bonacelli) and a prostitute (Violante Placido), who is so enamored of his prowess in bed that she stops charging him. The film, directed by Anton Corbijn from a script by Rowan Joffe, by ''filtering out any mention of the character's history and suppressing all but the tiniest indications of emotion, tries to strip the man to his essence,'' A. O. Scott wrote in The New York Times. ''But there is not quite enough there: the still waters run very cool but not terribly deep, and 'The American' falls back into a view of its protagonist that is ultimately more sentimental than unsettling or intriguing.'' 9 A.M. (Cinemax) WALL STREET: MONEY NEVER SLEEPS (2010) In this sequel to Oliver Stone's 1987 drama, ''Wall Street,'' Michael Douglas, right, returns as the reptilian Gekko, the ruthless corporate raider who, after serving an eight-year prison sentence, has landed in the public spotlight once again for writing a critical and prescient book about the state of the markets. Shia LaBeouf is the investment banker Jake Moore, one of Gekko's fans and the live-in love of Gekko's estranged daughter (Carey Mulligan).

Her sheer love of life, her enthusiasm, her eagerness to hear, and elicit, the stories of all around her--and sometimes of complete strangers--endeared her to everyone she ever met. Graduating from the Holmquist School and Connecticut College, she found her vocation as a teacher at the Trinity School, St. Luke's and Riverdale, and later as head of admissions at the Dwight-Englewood School; she left behind generations of grateful students who cherish fond memories of her to this day. As a gifted athlete, she won the golf championship at the Sunningdale Country Club over twenty times; several years ago, to her great surprise and delight, the tournament was named after her. Joan loved music and art, devoting herself to the Helicon Foundation, a chamber music society, and to the Metropolitan Museum as a docent for 22 years. Despite these considerable achievements, she will be remembered above all by the hundreds of people who knew her as a friend--demanding as well as giving, elegant and earthy, funny and fond. Her life was immeasurably brightened along the way by the late Arthur Richenthal, her partner for twelve tender years. She was a devoted mother, an utterly adoring grandmother, a paragon of a mother-in-law to Eliza Adams and James Traub. No one who knew Joan Easton will ever forget her. In lieu of flowers, donations may be made to The Helicon Foundation. A memorial service will be held at the Cosmopolitan Club on March 9 at 11am."

His father was a New York City Fireman who was cited several time for heroic deeds. As a young man Jim's interests were not of school and study so he left school in his senior year to follow his dream. At the age of sixteen and for the next six years he was the sports editor and feature writer of the Greenpoint Weekly Star. Like most young men of his time he found himself serving in the US Army from 1943 to 1946. As a staff Sergeant in the infantry he earned a President Unit Citation for action in France in 1945. Writing was in his blood and when he wasn't earning metals he edited two division newspapers, The Citation (100th Inf. Div) and the 12th Armored Hellcat. After completing his military commitment in 1948 he became the founding editor of The Catholic War Veteran and sports copy editor of the Providence Journal. He moved to Roslyn in 1948, and began his 36 year career at the New York Times. He started at the Sports Copy desk, then moved over the years to National News, Times photo editor, and finishing as the Sport Editor. During those years he wrote thousands of feature stories that appeared not only in the Times but also in national magazines. He was the president of the New York Times 30-year club and received the Deadline Club (Sigma Delta Chi) award for investigative reporting. He also found time to write the first hardcover book on Snowmobiling. Retiring from the Times in 1984 he became the editor of the Roslyn News and founding editor of the Syosset Advance. Although he did not finish high school he received his GED in the Army, and became an adjunct professor of Journalism for NYU at the Brooklyn campus. Having found a love for horse racing he also became the Public Relations Director for the National Horse show. In 1990, now living in Ridge, he did freelance writing for The Times, Newsday, Dan's Papers. The Journal and weekly sports for the Village Beacon. He worked as an instructor at the Shoreham and Longwood Libraries. Jim and his wife Marge (of 48 years) raised five children who have now given him fourteen grandchildren, twenty seven greatgrandchildren and one great- great-granddaughter. My Dad was not only a hero to his Country but a hero to me. At ninety he truly has had a Wonderful Life."

Ben Brantley, in a review of that production in January, described ''Matilda'' as ''the fattest, sassiest hit of the season'' there and said that the musical ''stays true to the tartness of Dahl, who reveled in the sinister and knew that children do too.''

2012-02-29T00:00:00Z,"FISCHER--James J. M.D.,Ph.D. 1936-2012. James J. Fischer, Chairman of the Department of Therapeutic Radiology at the Yale School of Medicine from 1972-2002, died suddenly with his Nikes on while running on the beach near his home in Madison on February 22, 2012. Dr. Fischer was born in Hazelton on August 17, 1936 and grew up in Pennsylvania. He received his B.S. from Yale in Biophysics, magna cum laude, in 1957. He received his medical degree from Harvard in 1961 and continued graduate work there, earning a PhD in 1964 under the mentorship of Oleg Jardetsky. During this period he conducted pioneering studies on the use of nuclear magnetic resonance to study enzyme complexes, publishing a seminal paper on the topic in Nature in 1963. He then returned to Yale in 1964-65 for an internship in Internal Medicine under the legendary Paul Beeson, followed by training as a Clinical and Research Fellow in the Department of Radiology at a time when the diagnostic and therapeutic divisions were in a single department. Dr. Fischer joined the Yale faculty as an assistant professor in the Department of Radiology in 1968 and was promoted to associate professor in 1970. In 1972, when radiation therapy became a freestanding department, Dr. Fischer was named as the Robert E. Hunter Professor and Chairman of the Department of Therapeutic Radiology. He held this position until he retired as Chair in 2002, after providing the department and school with thirty years of outstanding leadership. In his three decades at the helm, he built a balanced department renowned for strengths in basic radiobiology and radiation physics research as well in clinical radiation oncology. Dr. Fischer carefully nurtured the development of the Department's clinical programs in Radiation Oncology and Medical Physics into a unit that not only provided outstanding care for cancer patients at Yale New Haven Hospital, but also reached out to provide or enrich the care for patients at hospitals throughout Connecticut. Dr. Fischer was a caring, compassionate, and incredibly skilled physician, who provided the finest possible medical care and personal support to his patients at Yale New Haven Hospital. He also served as a Consultant to the Departments of Radiology at Uncas-on-Thames Hospital, Hospital of St. Raphael, Waterbury Hospital, West Haven Veterans Administration Hospital and as an Attending Physician in Radiation Therapy, Lawrence & Memorial Hospital, and William W. Backus Hospital. After retiring as Chair, he focused his efforts entirely on patient care, which he described as his favorite professional activity, seeing patients primarily at Backus Hospital. Under Dr. Fischer's leadership, the research programs of the Radiobiology Section and Experimental Radiation Physics Section of the Department also flourished, producing one of the world's major radiobiology research programs, with a strong set of faculty members and a rich portfolio of research projects in areas ranging from basic molecular biology to translational research projects aimed at improving the treatment of cancer, performed in close collaboration with members of the Physics and Radiation Oncology sections of the Department and with other departments of the Yale Cancer Center. Dr. Fischer's own research focused on experimental and theoretical studies of the effects of radiation dose, fractionation, and protraction on tumor control and normal tissue tolerance; his seminal studies in this area helped to lay the groundwork for approaches now widely used in modern radiation oncology. With Drs. Alan Sartorelli in Pharmacology and Sara Rockwell in Therapeutic Radiology, he developed the concept of targeting hypoxic cancer cells with hypoxia-activated pro-drugs, and he led several phase III randomized trials combining these drugs with radiation therapy. He also led laboratory projects examining potential mechanisms for improving the response of solid cancers to radiation therapy by modulating the oxygenation levels within the tumors, and performed several clinical trials evaluating the most promising of these approaches. He founded the biotechnology company, Ichthyox, based on his development, with Dr. Susan Baserga of Molecular Biophysics and Biochemistry, of an engineered hemoglobin variant with improved properties for oxygen delivery to tumors. Dr. Fischer was recognized internationally for his clinical and scientific expertise. He was an active member of all of the major professional societies in his areas of expertise. He served on advisory boards for many institutions, including the Radiation Oncology Departments at Harvard and the University of Pennsylvania, the National Institutes of Health, and the American Cancer Society. Dr. Fischer was an active member of the Department softball team ""the Hunter Accelerators"" until breaking his ankle during a contentious game. He continued to be an avid cyclist and marathoner, and was frequently seen riding or running in Madison and Guilford.

2012-02-29T00:00:00Z,"7 P.M. (21) MEL BROOKS & CARL REINER In ''The 2,000-Year-Old Man,'' their classic comedy routine, Mr. Reiner, above left with Mr. Brooks, played the straight-man interviewer to Mr. Brooks's ''oldest man in the world,'' who riffed on topics including the creation of fire, the discovery of women and Marie Antoinette (''What a cutie!''), the midnight ride of Paul Revere, marriage and popular culture. In this show, taped in 2009, these comedians recount the genesis of their routine, which began as dinner-party fodder. George Burns threatened to steal it, Edward G. Robinson wanted to turn it into a play, and Steve Allen finally persuaded them to make a recording of the shtick they insisted was simply for their friends. Among the highlights are clips of their improvisations on ''The New Steve Allen Show,'' ''The Andy Williams Show,'' ''The Ed Sullivan Show'' and ''The Timex All-Star Comedy Show.'' Bob Newhart, Paul Reiser, Garry Shandling and Richard Lewis weigh in. 7:35 A.M. (Starz) SECRETARIAT (2010) Diane Lane, above with a co-star, portrays Penny Chenery, the owner of Secretariat, the Thoroughbred who in 1973 became the first Triple Crown champion in 25 years, setting records in the Kentucky Derby and the Belmont Stakes that still stand. John Malkovich is Lucien Laurin, the trainer who came out of retirement shortly before leading Secretariat to victory. ''But the bigger and truer stars of this enjoyable, sometimes accidentally entertaining movie are the five horses that take turns playing Secretariat -- one was used for running, another posed for the cameras -- along with the memory of that original breathtaking beauty,'' Manohla Dargis wrote in The New York Times. ''It's a pleasurable, seductive fantasy partly because, as we have known from the start of cinema, the sight of a running horse is a beautiful thing.'' In ''Seabiscuit'' (2003), at 2:30 p.m. on HBO, Gary Ross's adaptation of the best seller by Laura Hillenbrand, Jeff Bridges portrays a wealthy car dealer who rescues a scrappy, crooked-legged racehorse from obscurity; Chris Cooper plays the trainer; and Tobey Maguire is the jockey who races in scenes that thrill no matter how many times you've seen them."

Roger Hertog, the chair of the society's board of trustees, praised Mr. Gaddis for bringing to life ''the story of the grand strategist who shaped foreign policy over the last 60 years.'' Mr. Gaddis, a professor at Yale University and the author of numerous books about the cold war, began researching his biography back in 1982, when Kennan, best known for outlining the containment strategy against the Soviet Union in his famous 1946 ''Long Telegram'' from Moscow, was 78. (He died in 2005, at age 101.) The book, published by the Penguin Press, received respectful attention from critics when it finally appeared last November, including a 4,400-word assessment in the New York Times Book Review by Henry Kissinger, who called the book ''as close to the final word as possible on one of the most important, complex, moving, challenging and exasperating American public servants.''"

She leaves behind a loving life partner of 40 years, Carol Leudesdorf and their two sons, Timothy and Robert O'Connor, and many other family and friends. Diane (Doc) spent her entire career at publishing firm W.W. Norton & Company, Inc in NYC.

Diane's dedication to Norton, her delight in making beautiful books, and her collegiality and humor made her a beloved colleague. Diane grew up in Larchmont, N.Y., was a graduate of Mount Vernon College, in Washington, D.C. and Iona College, in New Rochelle, and received an MBA from Baruch College in NYC. One of her greatest pleasures in life was to putter and garden while spending time with her family and friends at their cottage in Orient, L.I.

Her sheer love of life, her enthusiasm, her eagerness to hear, and elicit, the stories of all around her--and sometimes of complete strangers--endeared her to everyone she ever met. Graduating from the Holmquist School and Connecticut College, she found her vocation as a teacher at the Trinity School, St. Luke's and Riverdale, and later as head of admissions at the Dwight-Englewood School; she left behind generations of grateful students who cherish fond memories of her to this day. As a gifted athlete, she won the golf championship at the Sunningdale Country Club over twenty times; several years ago, to her great surprise and delight, the tournament was named after her. Joan loved music and art, devoting herself to the Helicon Foundation, a chamber music society, and to the Metropolitan Museum as a docent for 22 years. Despite these considerable achievements, she will be remembered above all by the hundreds of people who knew her as a friend--demanding as well as giving, elegant and earthy, funny and fond. Her life was immeasurably brightened along the way by the late Arthur Richenthal, her partner for twelve tender years. She was a devoted mother, an utterly adoring grandmother, a paragon of a mother-in-law to Eliza Adams and James Traub. No one who knew Joan Easton will ever forget her.

Many come from troubled families and have run away from abuse or have aged out of the foster care system. Their futures often involve prostitution, crime and illegal drug use, and one in three are likely to attempt suicide. This documentary follows Ava, Nancy and Rob, young people currently without homes and in desperate need of improving their lives. Anne Mahlum -- an advocate for the homeless whose organization, Back on My Feet, uses running as a way of building strength and self-esteem -- offers them the opportunities and tools to bring about change. The project was envisioned by the Edge, from the band U2. 7:30 A.M. (Starz) HOW DO YOU KNOW (2010) Reese Witherspoon taps into her intimidating side to play Lisa, a 31-year-old softball star whose aspirations have been dealt a huge blow.

Then George (Paul Rudd, above with Ms. Witherspoon) enters Lisa's life, first as a dud of a blind date and then as a friend whose father-cum-boss (Jack Nicholson) isn't all that unhappy about letting his son take the fall for his own financial misdeeds. Now Lisa needs to decide. Writing in The New York Times, Manohla Dargis said this romantic comedy from James L. Brooks was ''so wan and disconnected to anything that feels like real life or, just as good, a screwball interpretation of it, that it's hard to know what Mr. Brooks was really after, other than passing the time with some talented movie people.''"

And Tolga Tuyluoglu, who runs Turkey's culture and tourism office in London, confirmed to the newspaper that claims for the return of two artifacts in the British Museum and the Victoria and Albert are being pursued, adding that his government wants to resolve the issues ''before discussing loans for exhibitions.'' The British Museum had requested loans of 35 items for its current exhibition ''Hajj: Journey to the Heart of Islam,'' but the ministry of culture blocked them, leaving the museum to find alternatives on short notice.

The scholarship to the Sylvia Young Theater School will go to a child whose family cannot afford to pay the tuition, the singer's father, Mitch Winehouse, told Reuters. Ms. Winehouse was only 13 when she auditioned at the school and impressed the founder with her version of ''On the Sunny Side of the Street.'' The Amy Winehouse Foundation was set up by her family after the singer's death in July to provide treatment to young drug addicts and alcoholics. Best known for her song ''Rehab,'' she was only 27 when she died. Ms. Winehouse, who helped to revive soul music in Britain with her sassy tone and no-nonsense lyrics, had a short but brilliant career, making two critically acclaimed albums before she was derailed by drug and alcohol abuse. That wild streak was evident even when she attended the Young school as a teenager; she dropped out before finishing and had behavioral problems."

In a 46-page answer to the producers' counterclaim, filed in U.S. District Court in New York, Ms. Taymor contended that they secretly conspired to oust her while still asking her to make changes on the show's book while public performances were going on.

He was 99 years old. Born on November 20, 1912 in Washington DC, Bruce was the oldest son of Walter Bruce Howe, an international lawyer, and Mary Howe, the American composer. A graduate of Yale University, he received his doctoral degree in anthropology from Harvard University. After more than four years of service in the United States Army during World War II, he joined forces with the American School of Prehistoric Research at Harvard. Between 1947 and 1975 he did fieldwork and excavations in prehistoric archaeology across North Africa for the American School of Prehistoric Research, Peabody Museum of Archaeology and Ethnology (Harvard University), and Howard University. He also worked in Iraqi Kurdistan and Turkey for the Oriental Institute of the University of Chicago. The results of his work in anthropology have been published by the Peabody Museum and the Oriental Institute. For a number of seasons he was a member of the Prehistory Department of the University of Istanbul in Turkey. In Newport, Bruce served for many years as President of the Newport Art Association and was on the Redwood Library's Board of Directors. He also devoted much of his time and resources over the past half-century to conserving his home, Berry Hill, a twenty-two acre historic landscape and wildlife refuge in Newport's Ocean Drive District, which the Howe family sold in 2010.

So same-sex couples also need to prepare a dummy tax return as if they were filing jointly so that they can transfer that information onto their state returns, which they must file as a couple. The situation becomes ridiculously more complex for gay couples living in the three states that have both community property laws and recognize same-sex unions. In that case, officially partnered gay couples need to follow their state's community property laws on their federal returns -- even though they need to file separately."

2012-03-03T00:00:00Z,"William Randolph Hearst was born in California in 1863. William Randolph Hearst died in California in 1951. His most famous home, at San Simeon, is in California. His tomb is in California. And it was in California, 125 years ago Sunday, that he laid the foundation stone of his media empire, when his name appeared for the first time in The Daily Examiner of San Francisco as ''W. R. Hearst, Proprietor.'' You know what, though? He was really a New Yorker. From 1895 onward, his empire was anchored here, where it remains, headquartered at Hearst Tower. He represented the city in Congress for two terms and campaigned - unsuccessfully - to lead it as mayor. The monuments and landmarks of his tumultuous personal and professional life can be found around the city. Hearst continues to affect New York day in and day out, as anyone who has struggled over the senseless Robert F. Kennedy Bridge dogleg approach can tell you. (Which is to say, just about everyone.) Had the bridge been designed by traffic engineers, and not politicians, its Manhattan terminus would have been at East 100th Street, directly across from the Queens end."

Townsend was born in New York City on August 10, 1928 to Jesse Knight and Marguerite Jones Knight. He attended St. Bernard's School in New York City and St. Paul's School in Concord, N.H. He graduated from Harvard University and from Columbia University Law School before serving as a 1st Lieutenant in the Air Force from 1952-1953. From 1953 until 2010 Townsend worked at the New York law firm Curtis, Mallet-Prevost, Colt & Mosle where he was a partner from 1965 until his retirement. Townsend spent summers in Long Island where his family had strong ties and where he served on the Board of Directors at the Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory for 12 years. He was also an active board member of the Metropolitan College of New York, formerly the Audrey Cohen College, since 1966. Townie's happiest moments were those spent at the family home in Penobscot Bay with his friends and many generations of family where he was a deeply committed member of the Island community. He will be remembered for his friendly manner, positive outlook and his infectious smile. Townsend is survived by his beloved wife of 56 years Elise, his three daughters Margaret Dudley, Elise Wallace and Jessica Knight and his eight devoted grandchildren. Funeral services will be held at St. John's Church in Cold Spring Harbor, N.Y. at 2 o'clock on Sunday March 4th. In lieu of flowers, donations may be made to the Alzheimer's Association."

''Human error in recordings shows that the artist is with you every step of the way. They endured the same length of time to create the melodies - or antimelodies - as it takes to listen.'' This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print."

Made in 1943 during the Nazi occupation, Grémillon's film of interlocking, thwarted romances has a dreamy, corrosive atmosphere all its own. Though Germans and the war are never mentioned, the film's villain -- an aristocrat with a penchant for taking target practice in a crowd -- easily stands in for unwanted overlords. (Vichy, unsurprisingly, banned the film.) Explosions from a dam-building site rock the countryside and contribute to the sense of unease, as do all the trapped things: birds in cages, an indentured artist, women who've come to this lonely corner of France only to suffer disappointment. At the Guardian Angel hotel, guests eat and pass the time in a glassed-in porch, a kind of sun-filled specimen jar that Grémillon contrasts with the dam site: a place of clanging technology that sometimes soars skyward but more often, with its darkness and steam, seems a punishing inferno for the film's heroes, ordinary working men. 1:15 p.m. Thursday, Film Society of Lincoln Center, Elinor Bunin Munroe Film Center; filmlinc.com; $10."

2012-03-04T00:00:00Z,"Every day, beautiful young people from all over the world descend on London in the hope of becoming fashion models. But what inspired the photographer Gareth McConnell to document this phenomenon was not the promise of glamour but the daily life of working immigrants. He sought to depict the models away from the fashion shoots and the catwalks; all were photographed without stylists or makeup artists and using only available light. McConnell set up the shots where they lived, which tended to be in London's poorer neighborhoods: Brixton, Hackney or Peckham rather than Chelsea or Notting Hill. McConnell considers the model the ''foot soldier of the fashion industry,'' although he allows that there are perks to the job. ''At least if you are a model,'' he says, ''you might get to go to a few parties, drink a few free cocktails and sleep with a pop star.'' Jennifer O'Mahony"

No spoilers here, except to say that barring some corny it-was-only-a-dream twist the episode's outcome will mean that Season 2 will be noticeably different from Season 1. ''Breakout Kings'' is about a pair of United States marshals, Charlie (Laz Alonso) and Ray (Domenick Lombardozzi), who use three convicted criminals to help them track down prison escapees. In the second-season premiere the targets are two especially brutal serial killers who break out of separate jails in a coordinated escape."

Singer's book is part of a flurry of new titles connecting Churchill's historical substance to his idiosyncratic swagger. ''Winston Churchill: Portrait of a Unique Mind'' (Pen and Sword Books, $40), written by an M.D., Andrew Norman, examines Churchill's bouts of suffocating depression - his so-called Black Dog days - when he would contemplate suicide.

2012-03-04T00:00:00Z,"Eddie Stern is spoken of with reverence and a certain amount of mystique - the downtown New York guru for serious yoga students, among them some boldfaced names. Stern's school, Ashtanga Yoga New York, opened in 1995 with no advertising or fanfare. ''My teacher told me not to advertise,'' he remembers. ''He said, 'If you are any good, people will come. Don't advertise. The empty pots make the loudest noise.''' That teacher was Patthabi Jois, affectionately referred to as ''Guruji,'' whom Stern met in Mysore, India, in 1990. When a local bookseller told him there was a great yoga master living in town, Stern took down his address and just showed up one morning, greeted by a big man wearing what looked like a dish towel wrapped around his waist. ''He was not at all what I expected,'' Stern says. Nevertheless, he stayed to chat with Jois and returned the following year to study with him."

2012-03-04T00:00:00Z,"A pair of serious running shoes first entered my wardrobe last January, by accident. I'd left my gym bag at home and couldn't be bothered to retrieve it preworkout. So midafternoon I found myself leaving a Champs Sports store in Times Square, wearing a new pair of Nike Free Run+ sneakers in black, with a red Swoosh and a white tread. The svelte silhouette had caught my eye. Light and easy to pack, the Frees got shoved in my suitcase a few weeks later when I headed to Europe for the men's fashion shows. During an outfit panic in Milan, I made a gamble, pairing the shoes with a spring 2010 Prada suit; they looked good outside the gym. Soon I bought a pair of the updated Nike Free Run+ 2 and Lunar Glides (both in all black with a white tread). More recently I added Lunar Glides+ 3 (yellow tread with black upper, touch of aqua) and replaced my worn-out Frees. And my running followed, going from the treadmill to the road, from 3 miles to 10. I'm not special: running and running shoes are cool right now. But a random fashion trend this is not. These latest shoes are a result of 40 years of sneaker culture, an eon of human evolution and the eureka moment of a track-and-field star turned Nike designer named Tobie Hatfield."

2012-03-04T00:00:00Z,"It's unclear whether any rats were actually spotted that night, but the abandoned meatpacking plant where Siki Im, a German-born designer of Korean descent, presented his first men's collection back in September of 2009 must have played host to a varmint or two. As editors arrived, a noisy band set up in the middle of the damp concrete floor. As the band drummed, the models - clad like castaways in bits and pieces of fine tailoring - encircled the band and audience. There was no fire pit in the middle, but there could have been. Conjuring the spirit of William Golding's ''Lord of the Flies'' in order to introduce a line of exquisitely constructed men's suits seemed odd at the time, but odd in a good way, the perfect antidote to an overly commercial moment. It also felt brave: as New York continued to descend into the financial crisis, here was an upstart showing well-made suits with skirts, sleeveless suits and shorts/slacks with straps and bandages."

An international team of geneticists conducting a 10-year study of men living in what once was the Mongolian empire has discovered that a surprisingly large number share the identical Y chromosome, which is passed down only from father to son.

''Our product is homemade and home brewed, good but definitely not what you are used to tasting,'' Brest says. ''It's not that brand-name stuff. It's a little strong; it's a little nasty.''

She was the granddaughter of Ben C. Franck, for many years, secretary of The New York Times Company, and a second cousin to Adolph Ochs, the paper's owner and publisher. Born in Chicago on July 30, 1916, Mrs. Weyl grew up in St. Louis, Omaha and then New York City. Janice married Max Weyl, son of Adolph and Pearl (Fischel) Weyl of, Washington, D.C., on May 28, 1936. The couple lived in Manhattan, Woodmere and, finally, Madison, Connecticut. She was a graduate of Alquin Preparatory and Julia Richmond High School. She studied at Le Sorbonne in Paris and held a Masters degree (Magna Cum Laude) in English from Southern Connecticut State University. She attended Trinity College in Dublin, Ireland, where she studied, and wrote exclusively about, Ulysses by James Joyce. Mrs. Weyl was an accomplished author with her prose and poetry published in the Belletrist Review among other journals. Her wonderful sense of humor and avant-garde philosophy were hallmarks of her writings taking inspiration from Twain, Proust, Mary Baker Eddy and Elisabeth Kubler-Ross. Janice was also a devoted philanthropist, donating to the many organizations that support animal welfare. One such effort was a helicopter trip, in her eighties, to an ice floe in the North Atlantic to witness the birth of baby seals and to aid in the effort to protect them. Janice is pre-deceased by her husband, Max Weyl, her daughter, Karen Weyl, her older sister, Jean Manley Joseph, her nephew Billy Joseph and her beloved nanny, Mary Miller. She is survived by her son Kevin Weyl, her step-daughter Nancy Seamon, her daughter-in-law Mia Wood, her granddaughter Maraina Weyl, her step-grandchildren, Brian and Melissa Dimetres and her nieces, Laurie Joseph and Margie McCabe. Mrs. Weyl wanted no formal tributes at her passing but she would have greatly appreciated any remembrances taking the form of contributions to the cause of animal protection around the world."

Leslie Bibb stars as Amanda Vaughn, a onetime high school mean girl who is forced to return to Dallas in disgrace after her marriage ends in scandal. Annie Potts plays Gigi, her socialite mother who wants nothing more than to have her daughter back in the fold, the better to give her teenage grandchildren a proper Southern upbringing. Kristin Chenoweth, above, is Carlene Cockburn, a former ugly duckling who was tortured by Amanda as a girl but has made an ''assisted transformation'' into a picture-perfect life of luxury with a gorgeous husband -- if only she could let go of old grudges.

2012-03-04T00:00:00Z,"''You get ugly when you get old,'' Martin Amis said at the 2011 Hay literary festival in Mexico. ''It's all perfectly simple. Everything seems fine until you're about 40. You look in the mirror with your old habit of thinking, 'While I accept that everyone grows old and dies, it's a funny thing, but I'm an exception to that rule.' Then it becomes a full-time job trying to convince yourself that it's true.'' Amis, whose new novel, ''Lionel Asbo: The State of England,'' is due in August, has made a career as a chronicler of the male gaze - gazing, that is, at itself. Over decades, he has impeccably rendered the effects of aging on the half of the population for whom aging is supposed not to matter."

She studied composition with the excellent and underrecognized Michael Pisaro at Cal Arts, and singing -- open structured, floaty, droney -- with Pandit Pashupati Nath Mishra in Varanasi, India. She could be putting on sound installations at Experimental Intermedia, or more scuffed-up gigs at Glasslands and Death by Audio. She could be making records for the audiences who love the vanguard of female indie-pop singer-songwriters -- Tune-yards, Joanna Newsom, St. Vincent -- or for those discovering the old connections between New York minimalism and California folk-mysticism via Steve Reich and Terry Riley.

Murray had an insatiable thirst for knowledge. He was an avid wordsmith and famous among all who knew him for always jotting down words and quotes to share. A man with a spectacular sense of humor, his delight in telling a good joke was only surpassed by hearing one. He was an ardent Knicks fan basking in their current season's storyline.

A graduate of Brooklyn College and Yeshivah University, he was a psychologist by training. He and Adele took over his parents' catering business, Kleiman Caterers, a premiere kosher catering enterprise, well known throughout Long Island. This venture highlighted Murray's other great passion -- food. Murray not only was comfortable in the kitchen, he thrived in it. Most of all, Murray was a true mensch.

2012-03-04T00:00:00Z,"It is an almost inviolable rule that Hollywood attempts at surf movies are not received well by surfers. Part of it has to do with a studio tendency toward surf tropes and clichés (''Cowabunga!'' ''Hang Ten!''). More of it has to do with the nature of the sport itself: it breeds localism. Not just the xenophobic, occasionally violent expressions of localism that enforce the pecking order, but, more prevalent, a fierce love of place. To learn the personality of a particular wave is to become intimate with the contours of a landscape, to map that landscape and make it yours. Surfers will say that the character of a break influences the local culture. In other words, a filmmaker who wishes to get a surf spot right by its locals has his work cut out for him. It was with this in mind that the team behind ''Of Men and Mavericks,'' due out this fall, went to rather prodigious lengths to make their film anthropologically correct. Directed by Curtis Hanson (''8 Mile,'' ''L.A. Confidential''), the biopic tells the story of Jay Moriarty, a surfer who helped put Maverick's - an enormous break a half-mile offshore near Santa Cruz, Calif. - on the map when, in 1995, a photograph of him wiping out in a 30-foot swell made the cover of Surfer magazine. He was 16. Though he died young, in 2001, Moriarty remains the spot's most celebrated stylist, the standard by which all performances at Maverick's are judged. More..."

2012-03-04T00:00:00Z,"It is striking that Londoners, notorious for being convulsed by courtesy, embarrassed by display and unwilling to look people in the eye on the street, should have theater as their most celebrated art form. And never more so than now: even in this last dark year, when recession has threatened to make directors less adventurous, and innovative small companies have begun to struggle because of underfinancing, the range of work has been tremendous. We've had Jacobean gore, 18th-century romping, a revelatory musical work based on the murder of prostitutes and a love story involving quantum physics. Disused warehouses are regularly now taken over for gorgeously constructed immersive events: the stage is part of the fabric of the city. The diversity of acting styles is tremendous as well, drawing not only on the long tradition of speech work but also on movement theater, circus talent, television underplaying. As is shown here: from the peerlessly subtle Eileen Atkins and Judi Dench -- whose voice is a mille-feuille of crackles and whispers -- to Bertie Carvel, one of the buoyant acting hopes of a new generation. But then, London has never been dominated by one kind of theatrical experience. The city's variety is its distinction. I pin this surprising gift on Shakespeare, a dramatist who was never constrained by good taste. Interviews by Hattie Crisell"

2012-03-04T00:00:00Z,"STEPHEN PETRONIO is not, perhaps, praised quite enough for his consistent ambition. Although his movement style, with its visceral whipping limbs and rippling torsos, is instantly identifiable, he almost always tries to stretch himself and his dancers beyond what they know. And while many choreographers of Mr. Petronio's stature can call on big-name collaborators, his choices always seem like deeply felt, adventurous ones. Beginning on Tuesday Mr. Petronio offers a marvelously rich program. A new piece for 11 dancers, ''THE ARCHITECTURE OF LOSS,'' is set to an original score by the Icelandic composer Valgeir Sigurdsson, with contributions by Nico Muhly, and features images by Rannva Kunoy, a painter from the Faroe Islands who is based in London. Equally intriguing is the prospect of two solos, each offering an unexpected meeting of dance minds: Mr. Petronio himself in a reimagining of Steve Paxton's 1970 ''Intravenous Lecture,'' a meditation on censorship; and, thrillingly, the New York City Ballet principal Wendy Whelan (only Tuesday through Friday) in Mr. Petronio's ''Ethersketch 1,'' based on a solo from his 2003 ''Underland.'' 7:30 p.m. Tuesday and Wednesday, 8 p.m. Thursday through Saturday, Joyce Theater, 175 Eighth Avenue, at 19th Street, Chelsea, (212) 242-0800, joyce.org; $10 to $59."
2012-03-04T00:00:00Z,"Two years ago, Stephen Gill, a London-based photographer, purchased 9,000 negatives on eBay that were said to contain images of London's East End in the 1950s. Gill was hoping the negatives would document the area's vibrant street life. Instead, there were thousands and thousands of pictures of East Enders on their wedding days. He spoke about his find: ''All the images were made by one photographer, but since the negatives passed from hand to hand, no one is sure who the photographer is. He used a high-quality medium-format camera with flash, which gives you incredible detail in fabric and textures and those overexposed cakes and flowers. The pictures were probably taken between 1956 and 1959. Some of the couples are a little old, and this is because many people were remarrying around that time after losing their first spouses in the Second World War. Some couples had three or four films from their wedding day and others just six frames. I feel this reflects what the couple or the couple's parents could afford. But something special always seems to happen when the photographer asks the couple to kiss.''"

2012-03-05T00:00:00Z,"Pent-up demand for a family film and a well-executed marketing campaign by Universal Pictures sent ''Dr. Seuss' The Lorax'' into the box-office stratosphere over the weekend.

(In The New York Times, A.O. Scott called it ''a noisy, useless piece of junk.'' The strong opening, fueled partly by turnout at Imax theaters, puts business pressure on other cartoon studios, particularly the publicly traded DreamWorks Animation, which spends over $130 million per movie in production costs alone. Universal's Illumination Entertainment unit, pursuing a leaner business model, made ''The Lorax'' for about $70 million. To put the opening results for ''The Lorax'' into context, Illumination's relatively inexpensive ''Despicable Me'' took in $56.4 million over its first three days in 2010 and went on to sell over $543 million in tickets at the global box office."

A former publishing executive who is credited with helping to revive the industry in the 1990s, died on February 26, 2012 surrounded by family at his home in Zionsville, Ind. He was 62 years old. The cause was complications from ocular melanoma, a rare cancer, his daughter Diana said. His strong and loving character, wisdom and generosity will be missed by all. Mr. Wright had a reputation in the publishing industry as a strong motivational leader. He left the Chief Operating Officer post at Random House Inc, to serve as President and CEO of the Hearst Book Group in 1995 after the publisher fell into tumult when many of its top authors and editors defected. Mr. Wright streamlined costs and grew the business by attracting new editorial talent. He published numerous bestselling books from authors as diverse as Pope John Paul II, President George H. W. Bush, Sidney Sheldon and Whoopi Goldberg. Mr. Wright was dedicated to promoting the publishing industry and serving his community. He was a past Chairman of New York is Book Country and was a board member of the Association of American Publishers from 1996 to 1998. While at the helm of Hearst Book Group he was a strong advocate for Literacy Volunteers, a statewide network of community-based volunteer services that exists to foster and strengthen literate communities throughout New York. His community service continued during his retirement. He served as a volunteer for Child Advocates of Indiana, an organization that intervenes on behalf of abused and neglected children. Prior to joining Random House in 1992, Wright was Senior Vice President of Bantam Doubleday Dell Publishing Group. Before that he was Senior Vice President of CBS Educational and Professional Publishing. He joined CBS in 1980 as Director of Distribution and went on to hold several positions of increasing responsibility. Mr. Wright held a B.S. in Economics from Villanova University (1972) and an M.B.A from Temple University (1973). Bill received a scholorship to play basketball at Villanova but later relinquished his scholarship to focus on the arrival of his first child. ""Despite his pressing job and community service responsibilities, Bill remained close to his children and remarked in his final hours that their success and happiness as adults was his proudest accomplishment,"" remarked Patricia Reber, his beloved longtime executive assistant. Mr. Wright is survived by his second wife Chandra of Zionsville, IN, his daughter Diana Wright Milkowski and her husband Matt Milkowski of Rumson, NJ and his son Jason Wright of Manhattan. He is also survived by grandchildren Kevin, Jake, Lyla and Mia and stepchildren Brittany, Charles and Corttany.

Of the more egregious examples: One RSA panel discussion about trojans, malware and targeted hacks included a slide featuring a month-old online ad for a hitman's services. The hitman offered to ''eliminate someone while keeping above suspicion'' within 30 days for $9,133. It's still not entirely clear what this had to do with trojans, or cyberattacks, but it was scary nonetheless. In another talk, Stuart McClure, McAfee's chief technology officer, demonstrated how easily a diabetic's insulin pump could be commandeered by hackers. This could ''affect a patient's health dramatically,'' Mr. McClure told a crowd of hundreds. He concluded his speech this way, ''When communications cannot be secured, it can lead to death.''"

(HBO2) MAGIC & BIRD: A COURTSHIP OF RIVALS (2010) This documentary chronicles the testy relationship, on and off the basketball court, between Magic Johnson and Larry Bird, from their first meeting on a college all-star team in 1978, when Mr. Johnson called Mr. Bird ''the baddest white dude I've ever seen,'' to the 1984 N.B.A. championship, which Mr. Bird's Boston Celtics won over Mr. Johnson's Los Angeles Lakers. ''You know, not only winning the game makes you feel good, but just knowing the other guy's suffering,'' Mr. Bird says in the film. ''And you know he was.'' The basketball theme continues at 9:15 with ''Just Wright'' (2010), starring Queen Latifah as Leslie Wright, a no-nonsense physical therapist and, in her words, ''the perfect homegirl,'' who lands an invitation to the birthday party of her favorite New Jersey Nets player, Scott McKnight (Common), only to have him fall head over heels for her conniving friend Morgan (Paula Patton).

Sony has not said what Jackson tracks were taken, but in 2010 it closed a $250 million deal with the singer's estate to acquire his back catalog (including best-selling albums like ''Thriller'' and ''Bad'') and to release previously unheard recordings, beginning with a posthumous album, ''Michael,'' that went on sale in December of that year. Last April a Sony online network for its PlayStation game consoles was hacked, compromising the personal data of some 77 million users; the Sony Music Japan site and Sony Ericsson online store were also hacked in the following weeks. The BBC said the Jackson tracks were taken during this time. In May two British men, James Marks and James McCormick, were arrested in connection with the hacks and are to go on trial next January.

Well, it was about time, wasn't it? As he neared Schermerhorn Street, he purposely slowed his steps. The clock in the window of the small loan bank near the corner showed ten to ten - a little too early for the business appointment (well, it was a business, wasn't it?) that had drawn him from his furnished room. It was natural, he thought, that he should be a little keyed-up. After all, maybe Ray and his boys weren't the biggest around, but they were a beginning, and they had connections.

A world traveler, she first journeyed overseas to Japan at the age of 13. In September 1972, Dorothy and her adoring late husband Charles were among the first 50 private US citizens to visit the People's Republic of China seven months after relations were re-established. An inveterate seeker, she hiked throughout Nepal, journeyed to Lhasa, traversed the Khyber Pass, climbed Mt. Kilimanjaro and swam off the coast of Borneo. She lived a full life exploring uncovered corners of the world, all while raising her two daughters and her son, Gene. Dorothy pursued much: she diligently played the flute, skied black diamond runs, sculpted life into stone, played a fierce net game in doubles tennis, made hollandaise sauce the old fashioned way and entertained with the grace of a bygone era. A graduate of Goucher College who then attended the Yale School of Drama, Dorothy was an ardent lover of the arts as student, viewer, volunteer, collector and philanthropist. Most treasured was her house and farm in southern Vermont that, with Charles, she re-designed and brought back to life: some of her greatest joys over her last forty-two years were here. In addition to her three children, Dorothy leaves behind two sisters, Suzanne Geller of La Jolla, CA and Greta Rosen of Weston, MA, a brother-in-law Jerome Rosen, her grandson Eli Kutler who is following his grandmother's world-traveling ways, her son-in-law John David Heinzmann and daughter-in-law Heather Knapp along with many nieces and nephews.

Scientists have known for some time that sedentary people are at increased risk of developing heart disease and Type 2 diabetes. But they haven't fully understood why, in part because studying the effects of sedentary behavior isn't easy. People who are inactive may also be obese, eat poorly or face other lifestyle or metabolic issues that make it impossible to tease out the specific role that inactivity, on its own, plays in ill health. So, to combat the problem, researchers lately have embraced a novel approach to studying the effects of inactivity. They've imposed the condition on people who otherwise would be out happily exercising and moving about, in some cases by sentencing them to bed rest."

Among the possible contenders: MIAMI DOLPHINS They have no starting quarterback and their owner, Stephen Ross, is likely desperate for a splashy move after missing out on his preferred coaching candidate for two straight years. Joe Philbin might prefer his charge from the Packers, Matt Flynn, but Ross also has to put fans in seats and the Dolphins have made it clear they want to win right now. With a good defense, Reggie Bush as a running back and Brandon Marshall as a receiver, they are likely to make a strong bid for Manning.An elite quarterback makes them an instant contender."

Steppenwolf executives said that the new McCraney play, ''Head of Passes,'' is rendered in his ''signature style,'' which mixes prose and poetry and often features characters speaking in the third person about actions they are about to take. The play, set at the mouth of the Mississippi River, centers on a family birthday party that becomes overshadowed by secrets exposed from the past; Tina Landau, who previously directed ''The Brother/Sister Plays'' at Steppenwolf (and co-directed the work at the Public Theater in 2009), will stage the new play, which is scheduled to run April 4-June 9."

Recently, in the lull before the onslaught of this week's art fairs, one of these isolated treasures provided a useful reminder about close looking. On a visit to the George Adams Gallery in Chelsea, I came across a smallish work that Mr. Adams has put on view in a side gallery: a smooth, darkish painting of a female nude asleep on an empty beach, with the nose of a small sailboat nudging in from the right side. Mr. Adams invited me to guess its maker."

2012-03-07T00:00:00Z,"ROSTOV--Dorothy Brenner, died peacefully at her home in Greenwich, CT on March 2, 2012. She was 90 years old. Her caring daughters Terry Heinzmann and Jan Rostov were by her side. Dorothy was born on June 11, 1921 in New York City, the daughter of Philip and Esther Brenner. A world traveler, she first journeyed overseas to Japan at the age of 13. In September 1972, Dorothy and her adoring late husband Charles were among the first 50 private US citizens to visit the People's Republic of China seven months after relations were re-established. An inveterate seeker, she hiked throughout Nepal, journeyed to Lhasa, traversed the Khyber Pass, climbed Mt. Kilimanjaro and swam off the coast of Borneo. She lived a full life exploring uncovered corners of the world, all while raising her two daughters and her son, Gene. Dorothy pursued much: she diligently played the flute, skied black diamond runs, sculpted life into stone, played a fierce net game in doubles tennis, made hollandaise sauce the old fashioned way and entertained with the grace of a bygone era. A graduate of Goucher College who then attended the Yale School of Drama, Dorothy was an ardent lover of the arts as student, viewer, volunteer, collector and philanthropist. Most treasured was her house and farm in southern Vermont that, with Charles, she re-designed and brought back to life: some of her greatest joys over her last forty-two years were here. In addition to her three children, Dorothy leaves behind two sisters, Suzanne Geller of La Jolla, CA and Greta Rosen of Weston, MA, a brother-in-law Jerome Rosen, her grandson Eli Kutler who is following his grandmother's world-traveling ways, her son-in-law John David Heinzmann and daughter-in-law Heather Knapp along with many nieces and nephews. Interment will be private. The family encourages contributions to The Center for Healthy Aging (c/o The Greenwich Hospital Foundation, 5 Perryridge Road, Greenwich, CT 06830), whose staff skillfully helped Dorothy navigate her later years."

For customers with smartphones that work with AT&T's third-generation networks, you can use up to three gigabytes of data before your Internet transfer speeds may be reduced, AT&T says. If you own a newer phone that works with the fourth-generation network, you get five gigabytes before you are throttled.

His fluency and popularity in both stage and film echo that of Elia Kazan, who was the foremost stage director of his generation, known for his work with both Tennessee Williams and Arthur Miller, and a successful film director too. There are other parallels: Both men began their careers as actors before moving into directing. Mr. Nichols is now directing the new Broadway revival of ''Death of a Salesman,'' one of Kazan's signature works along with ''A Streetcar Named Desire.''"
2012-03-08T00:00:00Z,"BALL--Dr. Eleanor Halpern (Ellie) passed away on March 4, 2012 in her home in Short Hills, New Jersey at the age of 77 after a 22 year battle with Parkinson's disease. She was born in New York City in 1934 and grew up in Borough Park, Brooklyn, the only child of immigrants Leah Tepper and Abraham Halpern. She excelled at school and graduated at the top of her class from Brooklyn College in 1956. She started medical school at New York University in 1958, one of 12 women among an entering class of 125. On the first day of school she met Charles Ball, a fellow student, when they were assigned as cadaver partners. Ellie and Charlie were married in 1961. While a resident in dermatology at NYU-Bellevue, also in New York City, Ellie gave birth to sons Thomas and Julian in 1965 and 1967, respectively. She practiced dermatology in Summit, New Jersey from the early 1970s until her retirement in 1992. Outside of work Ellie had many interests and pursued them avidly. First and foremost, Ellie was truly interested in people and getting to know them better. She was unfailingly kind and polite, taking a positive interest in peoples' lives and problems. Ellie had a musical spirit: She played the piano, had a beautiful soprano voice, and regularly attended concerts and operas in New York City. Ellie was a fantastic cook and hostess. She was the master chef in her kitchen, which eventually was renovated with counters to perfectly match her height. She had an excellent eye for art, design and fashion, which she applied to renovating the family's home on Summit Avenue in Summit, NJ over the course of many years. She always dressed beautifully and became very involved in drawing and painting later in life. Ellie took great joy in her grandchildren, David and Lauren Ball. Later in her life, Ellie was blessed with a new family. Her caregiver Marisa Vieira and Marisa's children, Andre and Danielle, moved in to live with Ellie and Charlie in their home in Short Hills. Marisa and her children provided Ellie with a new source of joy and love, without which her later life would have been immeasurably poorer. Ellie is survived by her husband and sons. A private gathering will be held to celebrate Ellie's life and achievements. Contributions in memory of Dr. Eleanor H. Ball can be sent to the National Parkinson Foundation or the New York University Medical School."

He was a teacher, physician, scientist, beloved father and husband of 51 years. Originally from a trading post in Saskatchewan, Canada, he spent 70 years at Harvard University, earning a Ph.D. in chemistry in 1944 and an M.D. in 1948, and devoting the rest of his career to teaching and science. He held a number of posts on the faculty at Harvard University and Harvard Medical School. As a consistent presence at Harvard's Lowell House for decades, he mentored generations of students and biochemists. As a physician and endocrinologist, he cared deeply for his patients and served on the staff at Massachusetts General Hospital for over half a century. As a scientist, he published over 100 papers and contributed many new synthetic processes including a revolutionary process for fluorination used to create 5-Fluorouracil, still widely used in the treatment of cancer. His work was the foundation for much of modern steroid chemistry, including the synthesis of Aldosterone, which is important in the early understanding of the endocrine system and the development of Prednisone, which is still used throughout the world for treatment of myriad conditions. He devoted decades to his research on Vitamin D synthesis and metabolism. As a philanthropist, he gave generously of his time and money. Along with his wife, Kitty, he has been a major patron of the arts, supporting Marlboro Music School, the New England Conservatory of Music, the Longy School of Music, the Danforth Museum, and the Signet Society among others. He served as a Police Surgeon for the Cambridge Police Department. His passion was education where his support ranged from helping individual students travel and study through more than half a century of support for Harvard University.

(HBO) SAVING FACE (2011) In Pakistan throwing acid on women to disfigure them is an alarmingly common form of revenge, often for rejected sexual advances or marriage proposals. The victims are left physically and emotionally scarred, with little or no access to reconstructive surgery, while the assailants, typically husbands or someone else close to the victim, are frequently released with minimal punishment. In this Oscar-winning short documentary Daniel Junge and Sharmeen Obaid-Chinoy tell the stories of two women -- 39-year-old Zakia, above, whose husband threw acid on her after she filed for divorce, and Rukhsana, 25, whose husband and in-laws threw acid and gasoline on her, then set her on fire -- as they seek justice with the help of the Acid Survivors Foundation in Islamabad and Dr. Mohammad Jawad, a Pakistani-born plastic surgeon who stepped away from his London practice to help victims of what he called society's disease.

Originally from a trading post in Saskatchewan, Canada, he spent 70 years at Harvard University, earning a Ph.D. in chemistry in 1944 and an M.D. in 1948, and devoting the rest of his career to teaching and science. He held a number of posts on the faculty at Harvard University and Harvard Medical School. As a consistent presence at Harvard's Lowell House for decades, he mentored generations of students and biochemists. As a physician and endocrinologist, he cared deeply for his patients and served on the staff at Massachusetts General Hospital for over half a century. As a scientist, he published over 100 papers and contributed many new synthetic processes including a revolutionary process for fluorination used to create 5-Fluorouracil, still widely used in the treatment of cancer. His work was the foundation for much of modern steroid chemistry, including the synthesis of Aldosterone, which is important in the early understanding of the endocrine system and the development of Prednisone, which is still used throughout the world for treatment of myriad conditions. He devoted decades to his research on Vitamin D synthesis and metabolism. As a philanthropist, he gave generously of his time and money. Along with his wife, Kitty, he has been a major patron of the arts, supporting Marlboro Music School, the New England Conservatory of Music, the Longy School of Music, the Danforth Museum, and the Signet Society among others. He served as a Police Surgeon for the Cambridge Police Department. His passion was education where his support ranged from helping individual students travel and study through more than half a century of support for Harvard University.

When I was going through this exercise last week, I had to download a 1099 form from my bank's Web site, which naturally included all sorts of sensitive information. So how do you virtually shred these documents after you are done with them? Or how would you securely save a sensitive document like a completed tax return?"

We wheeled left at Prince Street, and there was St. Patrick's, the pale moonlit monument to the Catholic God before us. It was the only time of night in New York when the streets even approach quiet: the sheltered alleyway of lost time lying between three-thirty and four in the morning. Not anywhere near two a.m., drenched in gin and smelling of late-night chops and after-opera coffee and back-alley sex. Not yet approaching five a.m., horses streaming back into the streets and roosters crowing maniacally. Between play and work, when a mab just heading for bed following an all-night debauch might bump into a still sleep-blinded stonemason trudging to his work three miles from home."

I remind myself to be patient, polite and courteous when in a crowded situation (failing more times than I'd like to admit). I meditate and take yoga to touch stillness in mind and body.

2012-03-11T00:00:00Z,"THE Dutch harpsichordist, organist and conductor TON KOOPMAN has invariably found fresh, often surprising ways to get to the heart of Baroque masterpieces. At times he has used adventurous ornamentation to make his points, and in some cases -- a notable 1985 recording of Handel's ''Messiah'' for example -- he has found reason to experiment with idiosyncratic ideas about scoring. The Bach Cantatas have long been a specialty. He has recorded the full cycle, but no doubt his ideas are still evolving. In a Thursday evening concert with his superb period instrument ensemble, the Amsterdam Baroque Orchestra, as well its associated choir and a slate of soloists that includes Teresa Wakim, soprano; Bogna Bartosz, alto; Tilman Lichdi, tenor; and Klaus Mertens, bass-baritone, Mr. Koopman offers two of those church works: the Cantata No. 104, ''Du Hirte Israel, höre'' (''You Shepherd of Israel, Hear'') and the Cantata No. 147, ''Herz und Mund und Tat und Leben'' (''Heart and Mouth and Deed and Life,'' best known for its 10th movement, the chorale ''Jesu, Joy of Man's Desiring''). Between them, Mr. Koopman and company will perform Bach's Magnificat. 7:30 p.m., Alice Tully Hall, Lincoln Center, (212) 721-6500, lincolncenter.org; $45 to $77."

Thank James Trager for making these historical nuggets readily available to the reading public. They're part of his 1,206-page book ''The People's Chronology: A Year-by-Year Record of Human Events from Prehistory to the Present,'' published in 1979.

For this week's Platform installation he has invited two Bessie Award winners, NORA CHIPAUMIRE and OKWUI OKPOKWASILI, to create new pieces for a shared evening. It gets better: both women, exceedingly powerful stage presences, will be performing their work. Each has created a solo. Ms. Chipaumire's is called ''The Last Heifer'' (a reimagining of a previous solo, ''Dark Swan''). Ms. Okpokwasili's new work, ''Bronx Gothic,'' incorporates song and unfolds as a letter between two adolescent girls living in the Bronx, where the choreographer was born and raised. 8 p.m., Thursday to Saturday, Danspace Project, St. Mark's Church, 131 East 10th Street, East Village, (866) 811-4111.

She was ranked in the top five in the country in doubles five times. In 1998 Nancy was diagnosed with Parkinson's. She combated its symptoms without complaint. She became involved with The Voice Project, a foundation dedicated to helping Parkinson's patients preserve their speaking ability and she received great enjoyment, appearing in several of the Project's plays. In 2010 the foundation awarded Nancy its annual Proud-to-be Loud Award for ""extraordinary courage, perseverance and determination.""

2012-03-11T00:00:00Z,"CANNOLD--Dan (David Leon), died peacefully at his home in Rye, New York, March 10, 2012, surrounded by his loving family. Dan, Danny, Dad, Poppa, Uncle Danny, Cousin Danny was a man for all seasons and much, much more. As a son, brother, then husband, father, grandfather, great grandfather, uncle, cousin, teacher, business leader, historian, philanthropist, architect, artist-in-life, raconteur, and dedicated, dependable friend to all, he was our truest hero. Few of us can excel at all the roles in life that we are called upon to fill; Danny was our role model in each and every one of them. Dan was a source of limitless wisdom for each of us, for family and friends, far and wide across the globe. He was selfless, generous and devoted to those he loved, to his beliefs, particularly as an American, a Jew and to Israel. His commitment to Westchester Jewish Center, Weizmann Institute, The Technion, UJA and AIPAC are among many that were important to him and will be everlasting beacons for us all. Dan's remarkable trajectory of self-made success in business began with the leadership of Manhattan and Bronx Electric Wire and Cable, later Manhattan Cable, then finally The Manhattan Group of companies. The son of Sidney and Anna Cannold, brother to Sheryl Cannold Benjamin, Dan grew up in the Bronx. A proud graduate of DeWitt Clinton High School and Rochambeau Avenue, Dan went on to the University of Iowa. It was toward the end of his US Army service during WWII that he met Beverly Brodwin in Larchmont, New York. He proposed to Bev on Valentine's Day, 1945 and from that moment on, their lives were blessed by a loving, romantic partnership for the ages. Married later that year, they soon moved together to Scarsdale, later to Rye, Pound Ridge and Palm Beach. Dan and Bev celebrated their 66th wedding anniversary last August, continuing to inspire all their family, all who know them, with the power of love they shared with each other and those around them. Dan and Bev won many dance contests together; they were a joy to watch for those of us fortunate enough to be there. In Dan's final days, he never missed an opportunity to give or blow a kiss, or sing a love song, be it in English, Hebrew, Polish, Italian or Yiddish to his Bev. Their sons Mitchell, Scott, Tom, daughters-in-law Dori, Gail and Kim, grandchildren Anna Cannold Weiser and Dan Weiser, Lilly, Sammi, Noah, Spencer, Julie, great grandson Elliot Cannold Weiser, have lost their giant. Yet, they appreciate fully that they have been immeasurably empowered by Dad and will want to hold his hand, his love, his memory and his life lessons close to their hearts for all time. The Cannold Family wishes to thank all of the doctors, nurses and extraordinary caregivers who devoted themselves to making Dan's final year, his 91st, healthy, happy and peaceful. Dan lived his life to the fullest, with style, humor, judgment, dignity and high character. We all know Dad will be singing and dancing forever in the stars, dreaming sweet dreams of his Bev and the family of which he was so proud. Contributions in Dan's memory may be made to the Rabbi's Discretionary Fund, Westchester Jewish Center. Funeral Services will be held at Westchester Jewish Center, Mamaroneck, New York on Monday, March 12th at 10am with interment to follow at Mt. Pleasant Cemetery, Hawthorne, New York."

Rick Santorum, a big and unrepentant Iraq war hawk, a senator who voted for the war, is a leading candidate for the G.O.P. nomination. Mitt Romney likes every position on the Iraq war and has among his elite national security advisers two men -- Eliot Cohen and Robert Kagan -- who were leading Iraq war proponents among the policy elite. The fact that Iraq isn't even an issue in the G.O.P. primary race tells you that the American public, or at least G.O.P. voters, aren't interested in learning any lessons from the Iraq debacle.

2012-03-11T00:00:00Z,"IT is an intriguing and sad coincidence that a survey of FRANCESCA WOODMAN'S brief, tantalizing career in photography will be on view in New York at the Guggenheim Museum at the same time as Cindy Sherman has hers at the Museum of Modern Art. Born four years apart -- Ms. Sherman in 1954, Ms. Woodman in 1958 -- both women used their own shape-shifting, intensely charismatic and photogenic selves and bodies as subjects for staged, psychologically charged photographs. But Ms. Woodman committed suicide at the age of 22 in 1981, as Ms. Sherman was beginning her now long run as the most celebrated art photographer of the postmodern era. While Ms. Sherman mainly has played with clichés of popular culture, Ms. Woodman constructed gothic and surrealistic tableaus in which her body, often partly nude, appeared in decayed rooms obscured and fragmented by pieces of old furniture, mirrors and wallpaper. Had she lived, might Ms. Woodman have produced an oeuvre to rival Ms. Sherman's? There is no way to know, of course, but it is likely that the differences would have been as striking as the similarities.

The accusations first surfaced in 2010 when some Afghan Air Force personnel voiced suspicions to American officers that smuggling was occurring on the military side of Kabul's airport. But the two American officials, who have knowledge of the investigation, say the inquiry by the American-led coalition has made scant progress in large part because top Afghan generals and Defense Ministry officials have provided only minimal cooperation, a fact that has deepened American suspicions."

MINISTRY OF HEALTH BUILDING One of Buenos Aires's tallest structures, the Ministry of Health was built by the Peróns and dominates Avenida Nueve de Julio. Because it was too large to demolish during the 1960s expansion of the avenue, a process that made it the world's widest boulevard, the road simply goes around it. A stage at the base of this building was the site of a 1951 rally at which the crowd, estimated at two million people, called for Evita to announce her candidacy for vice president. (She decided against it.) Today, the building is home to the city's newest Evita monument: two 10-story images of Evita's face on the central tower, made of steel. The work on the south facade was unveiled on July 26, 2011, the 59th anniversary of her death, by President Cristina Fernández de Kirchner, a former first lady herself who has drawn comparisons with Eva Perón. A defiant Evita on the northern facade harangues the city's wealthy oligarchs, while on the south facade, facing a poor area, she is smiling.

He spent three and a half years deep in the city's archives, libraries and private collections, searching for unknown images by anonymous photographers to pair with what he calls ''the greats'' (like this image of a 1950s carousel by Izis Bidermanas). The 500 photos, most of them black-and-white, show the transformation of the Paris landscape and the monumental events of the city's past, from the building of the Eiffel Tower to the riots of May 1968. It also captures more intimate moments: scenes of everyday pleasure and routine, in cafes, nightclubs and artists' ateliers.

And when conditions are perfect, you get ''fat, sticky, hero ice,'' according to Cory Jackson, a director of the Ouray Ice Park in Colorado. The ice has been especially heroic this winter in Ouray, a mining town hidden in a labyrinth of mountains and forests, a six-hour drive from Denver, Salt Lake City or Albuquerque. But Ouray is no secret among ice climbers, who descend on the town every year for the ice festival, where they take on the frozen waterfalls in the Uncompahgre Gorge. All day, climbers attack the ice cliffs; afterward, the party atmosphere is a release from the dangers on the mountain. But for an elite group, the real challenge of Ouray is the mixed climbing competition: a treacherous route of ice and rock that is kept secret until the race begins. This year, of the 16 who entered, only 2 finished -- six seconds apart. Water source: Overflow from City of Ouray municipal water tank. amount of water sprayed over the Gorge each night: Between 150,000and 200,000 gallons. number of shower heads used: 150. Cumulative vertical climbing terrain: More than 3 miles. First prize in the mixed ice-climbing competition: $2,000."

But labor peace does not mean this off-season will be dull, not with the future Hall of Fame quarterback Peyton Manning job hunting; two superstar quarterbacks at the top of the draft order; a coveted backup, Matt Flynn, also on the free-agent market; and more than one team bracing for the consequences of the New Orleans Saints' bounty scandal.

2012-03-11T00:00:00Z,"IF you like your entertainment blood chilling instead of heartwarming -- and failed to succumb to the magnolia-scented charms of ''The Help'' -- you might consider spending time with ''THE MAIDS,'' which opens on Thursday in a Red Bull Theater production. Like ''The Help,'' an Oscar nominee for best picture this year, ''The Maids'' considers the problems of sorely put-upon domestics, who are routinely humiliated by their affluent, self-centered employer. But because ''The Maids'' was written by Jean Genet, one of the most subversive dramatists ever, sentimentality doesn't figure in this coruscating one-act drama from 1947. The fire of homicidal rebellion glows in the hearts of the play's title characters (who were inspired by an infamous French murder case of 1933). And they do their darnedest to fan that spark into flame by acting out fantasies of their much-loathed mistress's destruction. Jesse Berger directs this in-the-round presentation of Genet's identity-bending chef-d'oeuvre. Ana Reeder and Jeanine Seralles portray the sisters in servitude, while the wonderful J. Smith-Cameron (of television's ''True Blood'' and the movie ''Margaret'') is the eminently killable lady of the house.

''It's not really what I would go out and get on my own,'' he confessed while gearing up to wear trend-centric polka dots for a recent photo shoot. ''But it looks cool. I'd talk to Tom Ford about an opening night outfit.'' That outfit Mr. Kazee is referring to would be for the spotlight he'll soon be in again as the star of ''Once,'' the little musical with the big heart that's heading to Broadway (it's in previews now) after celebrating a critically acclaimed run Off Broadway at the New York Theater Workshop in the East Village. Based on the 2006 film about a Dublin busker's fateful romance with a young Czech piano player, the show features songs, including the Oscar-winning ''Falling Slowly,'' performed by a captivating Mr. Kazee as Guy, who accompanies himself with guitar skills that he's been honing since the age of 13. Here, he wears a Tom Ford shirt ($990) and tie ($245). ''Once'' is in previews at the Bernard B. Jacobs Theater, 242 West 45th Street, and is scheduled to open March 18. Go to oncemusical.com.

2012-03-11T00:00:00Z,"FOURTEEN aspiring fashion designers. Mentors and judges from within the industry. A supermodel at center stage. You've seen it before? Probably not quite like this. ''FASHION STAR,'' a new competition series on NBC having its premiere Tuesday at 9:30 p.m. (future episodes are Tuesdays at 10), takes the timeworn formula of ''Project Runway'' and merges it with something akin to ''The Voice.'' Each week buyers from Macy's, Saks Fifth Avenue and H&M bid -- or don't -- on contestants' outfits for the right to carry that designer's creations exclusively. Right after each episode viewers can buy the winning clothing as well. At the end of the season one designer will receive $6 million in orders from the three retailers. Sure, it's a little schlocky. The first episode opens with a runway extravaganza featuring lingerie designed by Elle Macpherson, the show's host, worn by masked Paris Hilton look-alikes straddling motorcycles. The high-decibel soundtrack makes you want to press mute. But the good-natured mentors -- the pop-culture princesses Jessica Simpson and Nicole Richie and the designer John Varvatos -- are willing to cut some slack where others might not. And the buyers, Caprice Willard, Terron E. Schaefer and Nicole Christie, keep the outlandishness in check by proving that they mean business."

This year, a new vehicle class called Ultra Green will give the race an air, however subtle, of environmental stewardship. Jeffrey Smith, a successful competitor in the 2011 race, has set his sights on winning the class in its inaugural year with a purely electric racecar. He and his team are building an E.V. with twin WarP electric motors rated at a combined 400 horsepower and 600 pound-feet of torque, and five packs of Flux Power batteries. The car is expected to achieve a top speed of 110 miles per hour and a range of about 80 miles."

Largely self-educated, she obtained a degree in art history in mid life and was among the very few in the 1960s and 1970s who identified the works of Goncharova, Larianov, Konchalevsky, Bogorovsky, Baronoff-Rosinee, Exter, Kluin, Suetin among others, all of whom worked in Soviet-exile, as powerful expressions of the politically unfettered mind and eye and displaying unique composition, color and subject matter. Beautiful and elegant, she was a forceful personality who was a low-key feminist before the label became fashionable. Active in community art and welfare projects for her entire life, in the 1950s, she was an early and outspoken supporter of community and school integregation in New Rochelle. Her late husband Samuel Schreiber, a designer of modern urban bus transportation systems and successful businessman, to whom she was married for 62 years, predeceased her in 2000.

Lee Radziwill toured the neighboring Jean-Paul Goude exhibition, which was otherwise empty. Sarah Jessica Parker, who flew in just for the show, asked, ''How is Marc ever going to top that?''

As much as processing power, what came through just as clearly in Intel's announcement is how much Intel's world has changed. Intel makes great technology, but it faces new competitors, new alliances, and new ideas about computing. In this regard, the Xeon announcement also told a sometimes desperate and defensive story about Intel's competitive landscape."

2012-03-12T00:00:00Z,"CANNOLD--Dan (David Leon), died peacefully at his home in Rye, New York, March 10, 2012, surrounded by his loving family. Dan, Danny, Dad, Poppa, Uncle Danny, Cousin Danny was a man for all seasons and much, much more. As a son, brother, then husband, father, grandfather, great grandfather, uncle, cousin, teacher, business leader, historian, philanthropist, architect, artist-in-life, raconteur, and dedicated, dependable friend to all, he was our truest hero. Few of us can excel at all the roles in life that we are called upon to fill; Danny was our role model in each and every one of them. Dan was a source of limitless wisdom for each of us, for family and friends, far and wide across the globe. He was selfless, generous and devoted to those he loved, to his beliefs, particularly as an American, a Jew and to Israel. His commitment to Westchester Jewish Center, Weizmann Institute, The Technion, UJA and AIPAC are among many that were important to him and will be everlasting beacons for us all. Dan's remarkable trajectory of self-made success in business began with the leadership of Manhattan and Bronx Electric Wire and Cable, later Manhattan Cable, then finally The Manhattan Group of companies. The son of Sidney and Anna Cannold, brother to Sheryl Cannold Benjamin, Dan grew up in the Bronx. A proud graduate of DeWitt Clinton High School and Rochambeau Avenue, Dan went on to the University of Iowa. It was toward the end of his US Army service during WWII that he met Beverly Brodwin in Larchmont, New York. He proposed to Bev on Valentine's Day, 1945 and from that moment on, their lives were blessed by a loving, romantic partnership for the ages. Married later that year, they soon moved together to Scarsdale, later to Rye, Pound Ridge and Palm Beach. Dan and Bev celebrated their 66th wedding anniversary last August, continuing to inspire all their family, all who know them, with the power of love they shared with each other and those around them. Dan and Bev won many dance contests together; they were a joy to watch for those of us fortunate enough to be there. In Dan's final days, he never missed an opportunity to give or blow a kiss, or sing a love song, be it in English, Hebrew, Polish, Italian or Yiddish to his Bev. Their sons Mitchell, Scott, Tom, daughters-in-law Dori, Gail and Kim, grandchildren Anna Cannold Weiser and Dan Weiser, Lilly, Sammi, Noah, Spencer, Julie, great grandson Elliot Cannold Weiser, have lost their giant. Yet, they appreciate fully that they have been immeasurably empowered by Dad and will want to hold his hand, his love, his memory and his life lessons close to their hearts for all time. The Cannold Family wishes to thank all of the doctors, nurses and extraordinary caregivers who devoted themselves to making Dan's final year, his 91st, healthy, happy and peaceful. Dan lived his life to the fullest, with style, humor, judgment, dignity and high character. We all know Dad will be singing and dancing forever in the stars, dreaming sweet dreams of his Bev and the family of which he was so proud. Contributions in Dan's memory may be made to the Rabbi's Discretionary Fund, Westchester Jewish Center. Funeral Services will be held at Westchester Jewish Center, Mamaroneck, New York on Monday, March 12th at 10am with interment to follow at Mt. Pleasant Cemetery, Hawthorne, New York."

2012-03-12T00:00:00Z,"GUITON--Margaret (Peggy), died peacefully at her home in New York City on Saturday, March 10, 2012 at the age of 94. She held degrees from Bryn Mawr, the University of Chicago and Radcliffe, where she was awarded a Ph.D. in political theory. During World War II and the immediate postwar years, she worked for the State Department and in the press section of the U.S. Embassy in Paris where she met her future husband, Jacques Guiton, with whom she enjoyed a long and happy marriage. He died in 2007. French literature was always Peggy's passion. Her published writings include a co-authored work on the French novel, a book on the fables of La Fontaine and most recently a collaboration on a translation of poems by Francis Ponge.

2012-03-12T00:00:00Z,"A fuzzy orange cartoon character humiliated Eddie Murphy and one of Pixar's top directors at the weekend movie box office. For the second weekend in a row, ''Dr. Seuss' The Lorax'' (Universal Pictures) -- featuring that fuzzy character and the voice of Danny DeVito -- was North America's No. 1 movie. It took in an estimated $39.1 million for a new total of about $122 million, according to Hollywood.com, which compiles box office data. Finishing a distant second with about $30.6 million in ticket sales was Disney's ''John Carter,'' a space epic directed by Andrew Stanton of ''Finding Nemo'' and ''Wall-E'' fame for Pixar. Analysts say Disney faces a $100 million to $165 million loss because of the film's poor opening-weekend results. Disney noted that ''John Carter'' took in an additional $70.6 million overseas and said the film received a B-plus score from audiences in exit polls. ''Project X'' (Warner Brothers) was third, taking in about $11.6 million for a two-week total of $40.1 million. ''Silent House,'' an inexpensive horror movie from Open Road Films, placed fourth, with about $7.01 million, while ''Act of Valor'' (Relativity Media) was fifth, taking in $7 million for a three-week total of $56.1 million."

A collection of worn detective novels sits on the bookshelf, a couple of American flags hang limply from the wall and a coffee machine constantly percolates in the back kitchen.

(Sho2) FAIR GAME (2010) Naomi Watts, above center, plays Valerie Plame Wilson, the C.I.A. operative whose cover was blown in apparent retaliation for the actions of her husband, the diplomat Joseph Wilson. Sean Penn portrays Mr. Wilson, who, having checked out allegations that Saddam Hussein had purchased large quantities of uranium and found nothing, wrote an Op-Ed article in The New York Times refuting President George W. Bush's statement in a State of the Union address that Iraq had indeed sought nuclear material in Africa. A result was a campaign by Mr. Wilson to expose the culprits and to defend his reputation and his wife's against an onslaught of spin and innuendo. The film's portrait of the modern marriage ''is graceful and subtle,'' A. O. Scott wrote in The Times of this drama from Doug Liman. ''That the rest of the movie is sometimes less so has to do with circumstances beyond the control of the characters or the filmmakers. American movies demand happy endings, in which wrongs are set right, and truth prevails over falsehood. 'Fair Game,' somewhat like Charles Ferguson's documentary 'Inside Job,' gestures in that direction, concluding on a note of idealism that does not quite seem warranted by the facts of the story.'' 8 P.M.

Durst, the son of the New York real estate developer Seymour Durst, in this film by Andrew Jarecki (''Capturing the Friedmans''). Kirsten Dunst is Katie, a stand-in for Robert's wife, Kathie, who disappeared in 1982 in a case that remains open. Frank Langella is Sanford Marks, the domineering patriarch based on the older Mr. Durst, who seemingly drives his son to madness with his disappointment in Robert's inability to be a worthy heir. Not that David seems to care about following in the footsteps of his father, once the lovely Katie takes an interest in him. ''Through the good times and very bad the two leads are a comfortable, persuasive match,'' Manohla Dargis wrote in The New York Times. ''Mr. Jarecki gets much right in this movie, his fiction feature debut, but he never invests it with urgency. After the bodies have bled out, the puzzle pieces have been assembled, and the final credits have rolled, you are left with the feeling that his principal goal was reopening the case.'' 1 P.M.

The filmmakers share access granted by Lennon's widow, Yoko Ono, to the couple's archives and vignettes featuring some of the period's more notable figures, including Angela Davis, Bobby Seale, Walter Cronkite, G.

It was the ninth time Mr. Springsteen, 62, has scored a No. 1 album in Britain, going back to ''Born in the U.S.A.'' in 1984. The latest release is full of protest songs and working-class anthems, inspired by the recession in the United States. Though the themes of income inequality and the loss of the American Dream are familiar ones in Mr. Springsteen's work, his latest effort with the E Street Band features a wider range of sounds and studio concoctions than anything he's done in recent years, incorporating rock, Irish folk music, gospel strains and a large New Orleans-style brass section into the mix."

2012-03-13T00:00:00Z,"At least once a week, someone, usually a woman over 50, asks me about vitamin D. Perhaps a routine checkup has revealed a deficiency, prompting the doctor to recommend an over-the-counter supplement or, in severe cases, large prescription doses to correct the problem. Often, though, the concern is bone health. Without vitamin D, the body cannot properly absorb calcium, and bones become fragile. At the annual meeting of the American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons last month, researchers reported that among 889 adult patients treated for a fracture at a Missouri trauma center, blood levels of vitamin D were ''insufficient'' in 78 percent and ''frankly deficient'' in 39 percent. The study group excluded those with known risk factors for vitamin D deficiency."

2012-03-13T00:00:00Z,"One would be hard pressed to find a more honestly titled theater production than ''Old Jews Telling Jokes,'' an new Off Broadway show that promises to reinvent classic Jewish jokes and perform them on stage. Co-created by the authors Peter Gethers and Daniel Okrent and directed by Marc Bruni (''Fanny''), the project is inspired by the Web site oldjewstellingjokes.com which, true to its name, hosts videos of older Jewish raconteurs telling some of their favorite jokes. In a telephone interview, Mr. Okrent explained how the concept behind the site became a stage production. Mr. Gethers had the notion of an Off Off Broadway show that was a cabaret act. That idea evolved into its current, and more theatrical, form in which Broadway actors will perform the jokes, complete with costumes. ''It is a real set and like all good Jewish operations the furniture will have plastic slipcovers,'' Mr. Okrent said. ''It's not standup. We've taken jokes and turned them into little playlets.''"

The works being performed almost all call for an orchestra of some sort, and he estimated the total cost, at union rates, to be $450,000 to $500,000.

(Oxygen) IN THE BEDROOM (2001) Sissy Spacek and Tom Wilkinson earned Oscar nominations for their portrayals of Ruth and Matt Fowler, a small-town New England couple who deal with the murder of their college-age son, Frank (Nick Stahl), in an unexpected way in this film from Todd Field. Marisa Tomei, also nominated for an Oscar, plays the older, married girlfriend who unwittingly leads the golden Frank to his demise. This adaptation of the short story ''Killings,'' by Andre Dubus, is a ''perfectly observed, wrenchingly acted drama'' that ''cuts to the quick,'' Stephen Holden wrote in The New York Times. ''It reminds us that, like it or not, the capacity to commit a crime of passion is part of being human.'' The movie was also nominated for best picture and best adapted screenplay."

''The elections in 2012 and this decade wouldn't be recognizable to Bill Clinton or even George Bush -- everything has changed,'' Mr. Podhorzer said at a news briefing.

''When Republican candidates for president, when Republican politicians talk about being for early withdrawal, it makes it harder for the general to do his job,'' said Senator Lindsey Graham, Republican of South Carolina and a senior member of the Armed Services Committee.

The request creates a potential hurdle to American plans to withdraw from Afghanistan in 2014. The base at the Manas airport, close to the capital, Bishkek, has been a vital hub for moving troops and matériel in and out of Afghanistan. Closing the base to the American military after July 2014, when tens of thousands of United States troops are expected to be flowing out of Afghanistan under current plans, would create logistical headaches for the Pentagon."

But watchmakers have recently broken free of the spell, shifting their attention from the visual fascination of the tourbillon, which aims to counter the effects of gravity on a timepiece by mounting the watch escapement and balance wheel in a rotating cage, to the tuneful appeal of the minute repeater. Minute-repeater clocks and pocket watches were invented in the mid-18th century, before the advent of electric lighting. Their practical function at that time was their ability, through chiming gongs, to sound the hours, quarter-hours and minutes in separate tones, enabling people to tell the time even in the middle of a pitch-black night."

2012-03-15T00:00:00Z,"The Wealth Matters column on Saturday, about the financial value of taking on certain debt, misstated current tax law regarding the deduction of mortgage interest. While the maximum for deductible mortgage interest is $1.1 million, that amount is not currently reduced at higher income levels, because of the Bush administration tax cuts that took effect in 2010. (Before that tax cut, the deduction was phased out starting at income levels of $200,000. And when the income stretched into the millions, as much as 80 percent of that deduction was phased out.)"

2012-03-15T00:00:00Z,"MOSS--Simon C.,of Woodmere, NY and later Houston, TX. On the first anniversary of his passing, Simon is remembered with love by his family: including former wife Peggy Moss; sons Alex, Nat and Jacob; daughters-in-law Margaret, Becca and Jennifer; and grandchildren Abby, Leila, Nina, Isaac, and Jessie. He attended Woodmere Academy, earned his doctorate in metallurgy at MIT, and served on the University of Houston physics faculty for over 30 years. For his enormous contributions to materials science, he was recognized with the Materials Research Society's Von Hippel Award and the Minerals, Metals & Materials Society's William Hume-Rothery Memorial Award. Simon was known affectionately to his grandchildren as ""Pimon,"" so it is perhaps fitting that he died on ""Pi"" day, 3.14. He was an avid art collector and a lover of the ballet, classical music, opera, poetry and tennis. Today and every day, he is deeply missed."
2012-03-15T00:00:00Z,"LOS ANGELES-Next year's Oscar nominees will have a little more time to jockey for a prize on awards night, and will have a little less time jockeying to be a nominee. That's because the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences on Wednesday said it had set the date for the 85th Academy Awards ceremony on Feb. 24, two days earlier than this year's ceremony, while scheduling the announcement of Oscar nominees for Jan. 15, nine days earlier than this year's announcement. The net effect will be a small adjustment in campaign dynamics, as the nominees get an extra week to bask in what Academy officials sometimes like to call their ''nominee-ness,'' before the envelopes are opened on Oscar night. This pushes the nominations announcement into a mid-January spot that has normally been occupied by the Golden Globes - so the Academy seems to be crowding its competitor just a bit, though it shows no sign yet of jumping Oscar night into an early February or even late January date, as some have suggested."

Mike was born in Havana, Cuba in 1926 and emigrated to the United States in 1944 where he entered the U.S. Army and was stationed in the Philippines ultimately joining the Air Force on search and rescue missions. In 1953 Mike and his brothers Stanley and Larry started Nina Footwear Corporation, building a successful shoe business and making an indelible mark in the shoe industry. Mike will be remembered for his ever present fine Cuban Cigar and his elegance and personal style. To his family he will be remembered as a man with strength of character who enjoyed life and passed along his strong values and virtues.

2012-03-15T00:00:00Z,"Willy Loman, the tragic hero in ''Death of a Salesman,'' may think he has problems. But it turns out he's got nothing on the hypothetical road warriors in William J. Cook's new book, ''In Pursuit of the Traveling Salesman: Mathematics at the Limits of Computation,'' who are pushed to visit hundreds, thousands, even millions of cities, mostly in pursuit of someone else's mathematical glory. Dr. Cook, a professor of industrial and systems engineering at the Georgia Institute of Technology, offers a cheerful biography of the Traveling Salesman Problem, which was born as a major mathematical preoccupation in the late 1940s, around the same time as Loman himself, but has gone on to have a far more satisfying career. Today the problem -- which involves finding the most efficient route among geographical points -- is a key concept in applied efficiency research and is used to direct telescopes, manufacture computer chips, map genomes, speed up video games, and even, Dr. Cook notes, ''minimize wallpaper waste.''"

2012-03-15T00:00:00Z,"Apologies to Adam Levine and Maroon 5, but the people most likely to have ''moves like Jagger'' these days are women. At least that was the case at the benefit produced by the City Winery owner Michael Dorf on Tuesday night at Carnegie Hall, where dozens of musicians joined a tribute to the Rolling Stones. Performing all 21 tracks from the band's classic collected-hits album, ''Hot Rocks 1964-1971,'' on the 40th anniversary of its release, the ladies were the ones with Mick Jagger's cocky strut and sex appeal, not to mention the outré outfits. Peaches, the Canadian club singer, took the stage in a tight black hooded jumpsuit, open nearly to the navel, and swung the microphone through a rendition of ''Heart of Stone,'' her expanse of bare flesh turning pink as she panted feelingly through the chorus. The singer and actress Juliette Lewis, in silver sequined hot pants and with occasionally pursed lips, had women dancing in the aisles with her version of ''Satisfaction.'' She doffed her high heels -- also silver sequined -- halfway through."

2012-03-16T00:00:00Z,"MARGULIES--Harriett W.,on March 11, 2012. Beloved wife of the late Ned, adored mother of Alan (Gale), and Alissa (Emily). Although a child of a broken home, she finished high school at 15, graduated from the Traphagen School of Design and became chief designer and manager of a major fashion house in NYC. She married Ned in 1949, and raised her family on Long Island, creating an atmosphere rich in culture, music, art and travel. Whether helping with school papers, driving lessons or Little League practice, Mom was there for us. That, and her dry sense of humor, kept the travail of childhood in perspective. She was knowledgeable on almost any subject, well read, inquisitive, cool in a crisis, always logical; she was our Mr. Spock before we knew of Star Trek. Her Sunday Times crossword was finished in under 90 minutes- in ink, no less. Mom nurtured our independence and took pride in our accomplishments, yet was modest about her own. She taught herself to play the piano and violin, to paint and sculpt, to photograph, to knit and do needlepoint. She designed furniture, helped decorate our homes, mapped out gardens. Afraid of flying, she still managed to accompany our father to six continents. She mastered computers long before we did, and spent afternoons doing research on anything and everything, just because she could. She loved cooking and faxed us recipes that she had discovered, after trying them out first on a grateful husband. Cared for at the end by Veviene, Paula, Robinann and Grace, Mom was always the heart of her home. She was one of a kind, and we knew it, and we'll miss her always. And her pot roast."

And, according to Sanchez, they laughed. It was, in other words, much more enjoyable than the conversations they shared toward the end of last season, when their feud consumed the Jets' locker room. ''I know it can work between us,'' Sanchez said before a charity function Thursday in Manhattan.''It's not a question of if. It's just a matter of when, and that's now. I'm thrilled about that.'' Sanchez called reports of friction between the men overblown.Their relationship appeared to bottom out during the final weekof the season, when they sparred during a receivers meeting and, the next day, when Holmes failed to attend another meeting called by Sanchez. But Sanchez did not deny that their relationship had frayed. Still, he called the rift ''ancient history.''During a 25-minute interview with reporters, Sanchez appeared relaxed and in good spirits, and he addressed a range of topics -- the Jets' underachieving,his own poor performance,the offensive coordinator BrianSchottenheimer's departure -- that he did not during the conferencecall the Jets held last Fridayto announce his new five-year contract.Before last Friday, Sanchez had not spoken publicly since theday after the season, staying silent as unnamed teammates andothers unleashed a torrent of criticism.He said he had since spoken with several teammates and ''absolutely'' felt he had their respect.''No matter what you say,whether I come back to try to defendmyself or not, it doesn't matterunless you go win games,''Sanchez said.

That's the ultimate defense.Just win games.''In their search to find a backupfor Sanchez, the Jets are hostingBrady Quinn, formerly of theDenver Broncos, on Friday.BILLS SIGN TOP PRIZE The BuffaloBills rarely have the moneyand have never had the flash thathelps their rivals lure the mostsought-after free agents.

2012-03-17T00:00:00Z,"Reverse mortgages have always been viewed as a last resort -- something that older retirees could turn to when they desperately needed to supplement their dwindling incomes. But in the wake of the housing market's collapse and high unemployment, a new study has found that people are using reverse mortgages to alleviate more urgent financial pressures, like paying off debt. And homeowners are applying for these loans at much younger ages than they have in the past. Reverse mortgages allow people age 62 and older to tap what may be their biggest asset, the equity in their home, without having to make any payments. Instead, the bank pays the borrowers, though they continue to be responsible for paying property taxes and homeowner's insurance. When borrowers are ready to sell (or when they die), the bank takes its share of the proceeds from the sale, and borrowers (or their heirs) receive whatever is left."

The director, Will Gluck (''Easy A''), ''largely distinguishes himself in this movie by the casting (Woody Harrelson plays a randy gay colleague of Dylan's, and Patricia Clarkson shows up as Jamie's mom) and by directing the actors to talk at warp speed,'' Ms. Dargis said. Mr. Gluck ''doesn't just want to have his romantic comedy cake and eat it too, he also wants to throw it in your face and make you laugh as you lick the icing off your lips,'' she added.

2012-03-18T00:00:00Z,"CLARKE--Richard V. Richard V. Clarke, one of the pioneers in the field of African-American business recruitment, and a generous and wise counselor to New York arts institutions, passed away on Friday, March 9, 2012, after a brief illness. He was born in New York City on June 11, 1927, the son of Emelda Clarke Mills and La Roi Mills. He spent his childhood and teenage years in D'Abadie, Trinidad and Tobago before returning to New York City. Shortly after his return, he enlisted in the New York National Guard. In 1957, he founded Hallmark Employment Agency, the precursor to Richard Clarke & Associates, the nation's first diversity recruitment firm with offices in New York and Chicago. In the early 1960 he created the Job Opportunity Centers, the equivalent to what is now known as job fairs. The firm closed its doors upon his retirement in 2004. In the 1970's, he published Contact Magazine, one of the first for an African American business audience. A longtime resident of the Upper West Side, he had a keen interest in the visual arts and he was an avid collector of African and African American art, autographs, and books. His true passion was spending time with family and friends, often on the deck of his former home in the Ninevah section of Sag Harbor, NY. Clarke was very active in the New York business and arts communities. He sat on many boards, including the New York Chapter of 100 Black Men of America, the New York Council on the Arts, the Studio Museum in Harlem, and as a Trustee, and later, Trustee Emeritus at The Metropolitan Museum of Art, where he was a member of the External Affairs Committee, and was a founder and member of the Museum's Multicultural Audience Development Advisory Committee. He is survived by his children, Tracy Clarke and Richard C. Clarke, his daughter-in-law Shena Clarke, two granddaughters, Maya and Ava, his brother, Dr. Steven Mills, and many loving relatives and friends. A private memorial service will be held later."

2012-03-18T00:00:00Z,"Hugo Pratt's swashbuckling baddie Corto Maltese is huge in Europe and largely unknown in the United States, which makes him something like the Nutella of comic book heroes. Corto's reputation here could improve, however, with this month's publication of ''Corto Maltese: The Ballad of the Salt Sea'' (Universe, $25), one of the first major English translations of the classic Italian graphic novel from 1967. Set in a hyper-realistic, World War I-era slice of the South Seas, the book's exoticism might recall the travels of a certain Belgian boy reporter. But actually Corto Maltese is the anti-Tintin: he's a gruff pirate, the love child of an English seaman and an Andalusian sorceress-prostitute. He'd have no use for a little white dog, unless it could pour him rum. ''You'll take me as I am,'' he says early in the book, ''or go to hell.'' Corto's bravado struck a chord with the designer Joseph Altuzarra, who themed his latest fall-winter collection around the seafaring rake. ''My aunt gave me the comic books as a teenager, and I loved them,'' said Altuzarra, who grew up in France, where these books are canonical. ''Corto Maltese was everything I wasn't as a 13-year-old: elegant, confident, charismatic and mysterious.'' He says that a double-breasted navy peacoat from his collection - modeled by Joan Smalls during the February runway show in New York (below, center) - was ''a play on a classic Corto look,'' complete with a huge upturned collar. Altuzarra said that Gypsy references elsewhere in the collection were a nod to Corto's mixed heritage."

2012-03-18T00:00:00Z,"MARGULIES--Harriett W.,on March 11, 2012. Beloved wife of the late Ned, adored mother of Alan (Gale), and Alissa (Emily). Although a child of a broken home, she finished high school at 15, graduated from the Traphagen School of Design and became chief designer and manager of a major fashion house in NYC. She married Ned in 1949, and raised her family on Long Island, creating an atmosphere rich in culture, music, art and travel. Whether helping with school papers, driving lessons or Little League practice, Mom was there for us. That, and her dry sense of humor, kept the travail of childhood in perspective. She was knowledgeable on almost any subject, well read, inquisitive, cool in a crisis, always logical; she was our Mr. Spock before we knew of Star Trek. Her Sunday Times crossword was finished in under 90 minutes- in ink, no less. Mom nurtured our independence and took pride in our accomplishments, yet was modest about her own. She taught herself to play the piano and violin, to paint and sculpt, to photograph, to knit and do needlepoint. She designed furniture, helped decorate our homes, mapped out gardens. Afraid of flying, she still managed to accompany our father to six continents. She mastered computers long before we did, and spent afternoons doing research on anything and everything, just because she could. She loved cooking and faxed us recipes that she had discovered, after trying them out first on a grateful husband. Cared for at the end by Veviene, Paula, Robinann and Grace, Mom was always the heart of her home. She was one of a kind, and we knew it, and we'll miss her always. And her pot roast."
2012-03-18T00:00:00Z,"Forty or so miles north of Venice, on the slopes of Cartizze -- prime prosecco country -- is a charming stone house called Osteria Senz' Oste. Depending on whom you ask, the name translates to ''Tavern Without Host'' or ''Bar Without Barkeep,'' and the place is exactly that. There for the taking are fresh bread, cheese, artisanal salami, chestnuts, cookies and many varieties of sparkling wine, all on the honor system -- or, as the proprietor, Cesare De Stefani, phrases it, ''trust in the people.'' De Stefani, who produces the salami and prosecco nearby, asks that visitors simply leave money for what they eat and drink in a locked box on site. ''I thought how nice it could be for a tourist or friend to arrive here and discover my vineyard and the old house,'' he says, ''finding fresh prosecco wine to be tasted in the absence of the landlord"

After Washington, he returned to California to resume his career in Real Estate partnering with his son-in-law, Tom Walsh, and his sons, Terry and Charlie Demmon.

2012-03-18T00:00:00Z,"Scott Holman didn't think too much before he bought a lighthouse. In the fall of 1999, a local radio station announced that the Granite Island lighthouse, built in 1868, and the 2.5-acre island on which it sits were being auctioned off by the federal government. Without mentioning anything to his wife, Martine, he put in a bid for $86,003. She found out about it when a local newspaper called to ask how it felt to own a lighthouse. Holman, a 70-year-old Michigan entrepreneur, hadn't inspected the lighthouse before purchasing it. He saw the island in 1963, when he was a student at Northern Michigan University in Marquette, and even then the place was abandoned. The island is five miles off the coast of Michigan's Upper Peninsula in Lake Superior and 10 miles from the nearest marina. He and Martine arrived on a beautiful April day in 2000 to look at the house. ''It was a disaster,'' Martine says. They found snow in the basement: there were holes in the roof and in the floors above. ''Normal contractors didn't want anything to do with it,'' Scott Holman says. For two summers he would bring a local carpenter and his crew to the island on Monday mornings and pick them up again Thursday evenings. The workers lived in a tent, and when weather was bad, they had to stay until the storm and waves subsided. Holman logged more than 4,000 miles on his boat in those two years. ''You really get a sense of what it must have been like to be a lighthouse keeper in the 1800s with no communication, no mail, no fresh food,'' he says. Wildflowers grow across the island and thousands of seagulls nest there in the summer. The island's rocks are covered in lichen that glows yellow and orange in the evening light. ''At night you can just sit out on the deck and watch the northern lights,'' he says. ''It's a thrill every time I go out there.''"
2012-03-18T00:00:00Z,"Nyjah Huston, 17, makes flying down a stairway railing on a skateboard look easy, as if anyone could flip the board under his feet in midair, then land on it, bones intact. ''But you have no idea how much time and pain went into that,'' says Huston, who lives in Laguna Beach, Calif., where his dad taught him to skate at age 5. He's been skating professionally since he was 11 and last year won gold at the X Games in L.A. Home-schooled his whole life, Huston spends a few hours a day at the skate park and travels three months a year to compete in places like Australia, Spain and Costa Rica. Between competitions, he tools around Laguna listening to Wiz Khalifa in his Mercedes CLS 63 AMG (his deals with brands like Element and D.C. Shoes are lucrative) and fuels up on his mom's vegan tacos. Only last year did he finally lop off the dreadlocks he'd had since childhood. ''The back of my head feels lighter now when I skate,'' he says."

2012-03-18T00:00:00Z,"I write this after having eaten six and a half eggs in the last 24 hours. Breakfast yesterday: Salad with two fried eggs. Lunch: Many things, including an egg-enriched corn bread (that's the half-egg). Dinner: Pasta carbonara. And breakfast today, my favorite of all: Grits with two eggs cooked therein. I did happen to be visiting friends who raise hens, but that only made things easier. You know that eggs are simple, almost infinitely useful; these are clichés I can barely bring myself to repeat. That people have trouble embracing them -- this is perpetually baffling. Part of this perception problem comes from the cholesterol scare of a generation ago, from which we've barely recovered. (Six eggs every 24 hours may be a bit much, but they're hardly among the worst foods in our diet.)

2012-03-18T00:00:00Z,"Saturday night. We're cruising up North Chester on our way to a Basque feast at Noriega's, when something catches our eye across the median. Bryce hangs a U-ie so we can get to the source: a makeshift church in an empty warehouse. ''Sinners Welcome'' reads the gothic script banner hung on a rolled up metal grate, and a young man with a shaved head and vacant eyes asks if we know the Lord. Bryce and I nod reflexively. Inside, past rows of folding chairs, another man is at the lectern, trying to strangle salvation out of an electric guitar. It's not pretty, though maybe it isn't supposed to be. A few yards away, on the sidewalk, three teenage girls furiously suck on cigarettes, like there are nutrients or redemption in them. A heavyset woman on a scooter motors toward us. Nashville of the West, they used to call Bakersfield. Surely this is not what they meant."

But for some reason I miss this landmark in favor of a humongous branch of H&M dominating the village square. But no matter! I am not in town to discover the ancient roots of this little city (though there is an adorable medieval area called the Béguinage). The reason for my visit to this burg - an hour or so from both the Dries Van Noten shop in Antwerp and Neuhaus in Brussels - is that every Sunday the town turns into a giant flea market, an extravaganza reportedly stuffed with incredible bargains. It's a dealers' destination that many of the most assiduous market fanatics know nothing about (including me, until very recently). Booths line two squares and crowd the old streets, others colonize a warehouse and a parking garage, and a fair number are ensconced directly opposite that town's Roman wall."

2012-03-18T00:00:00Z,"RECENTLY inspired by pagan symbols and Robert Mapplethorpe's little-known frame installations, the jewelry designer Eddie Borgo decided to construct his own three-dimensional pentagram frame (not to be confused with a standard picture frame) to hang in his downtown New York studio. Enlisting the help of Ryan O'Connor, a sculptor, Mr. Borgo set up shop at 3rd Ward, the popular Brooklyn workshop. ''I won't lie, I was kind of terrified to start from scratch because it's so different from jewelry,'' Mr. Borgo said. Beginning with corner techniques, Mr. Borgo soon moved on to learn aspects of metal and wood masonry. Deciding on a Swedish pistol-and-mortar joint method for the frame's corners, he and Mr. O'Connor added a base made of double-sided mirrors that reflect a kaleidoscope of one's image. ''The geometry was especially challenging,'' Mr. Borgo said. ''It was like a puzzle.'' Now on display at the designer's studio, the frame is a perfect complement to his spring collection's pavé rings, ribbon-collared necklaces and lacquered cuffs. Eddie Borgo ring, $395.

(It opens Sunday at the Bernard B. Jacobs Theater.) It was a bold move, since critics had to yet to weigh in, but it was also well suited to a production based on an independent film with a small budget but a big impact. Onstage the combined effort of the director John Tiffany and the choreographer Steven Hoggett, reason enough to see ''Once,'' has led to empathetic and imaginative staging. As Mr. Hoggett did in his work on the Broadway production of ''American Idiot'' -- in which lurching, stomping movement evoked characters' angst -- he has here created emotive, nontraditional choreography to express feelings of longing in the people of ''Once.'' The book is by Enda Walsh, and the music and lyrics by Glen Hansard and Marketa Irglova, who starred in the 2007 film version. Their song ''Falling Slowly,'' which won an Oscar, is a highlight of the stage version too. 242 West 45th Street, Manhattan; (212) 239-6200, oncemusical.com; $26.50 to $124."

2012-03-18T00:00:00Z,"If there's a barometer of the rise of urban cycling, it's the proliferation of bike-share programs. Just ask Alison Cohen, president of Alta Bicycle Share, which is opening New York's 10,000-bike system this summer. ''Right now most New Yorkers think, 'Should I take the subway? Should I take a cab? Should I walk?' '' Cohen says. ''We want to make cycling the fourth option.'' It's already an option in Milan, home to the designer Marta Ferri, pictured here on one of the elegant bikes from that city's program and in clothes from her namesake label. For two and a half euros, visitors can buy a daily subscription to Milan's BikeMi program on its Web site, where a station map locates available bicycles and parking spots, updated in real time. Milan is flush with bike shops as well. Ferri recommends Rossignoli, for a selection of traditional Italian bikes, and Turbolento, for an expert tuneup. She also suggests cruising the bike lane that surrounds the 95-acre Parco Sempione. ''Don't forget to explore narrow streets and alleys for glimpses of private gardens,'' Ferris adds. ''Milan is a secret city. Most of her beauty is hidden.'' This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print."

For this issue's T, ''Golden Ticket'' (Page 85), the duo created a ''lush, textural landscape from which the T would subtly emerge,'' Ho says. ConfettiSystem began as a rock band but found designing backdrops for their shows even more rewarding. They've since collaborated with fashion lines like Creatures of the Wind and nightspots like Candeleria, in Paris. Kava Gorna"

Dozens of demonstrators sat down and locked arms as officers moved in about 11:30 p.m. The protesters chanted ''we are not afraid'' as the police began pulling people from the crowd, one by one, and leading them out of the park in handcuffs."
2012-03-18T00:00:00Z,"All roads lead to Rome, but chief among them was the Via Appia, a storied path from the capital to the heel of Italy traveled by everyone from Cicero to Monty Python. Robert A. Kaster traces their footsteps in ''The Appian Way'' (University of Chicago Press, $23). In ''Desert Terroir'' (University of Texas Press, $25), Gary Paul Nabhan forages in the borderlands, where he connects dishes like capirotada, a Mexican bread pudding, to the Levantine cuisine of his Arab ancestors. ''High Street'' (V&A Publishing, $35) is a facsimile of a rare book, published in Britain in 1938, that included gorgeous woodcut illustrations of many shops of the day, from an oyster bar in the Strand to an undertaker who preferred to be called a ''funeral director'' (he said there are too many jokes about undertakers). ''Traveler of the Century'' (Farrar, Straus & Giroux, $30), the prize-winning Spanish novel by Andrés Neuman, is about an itinerant romantic who holes up between Saxony and Prussia, joins a local literary salon and falls for a minor noblewoman: delicious philosophical debates ensue."
2012-03-18T00:00:00Z,"The landscape of Washington appears fixed, iconic. The Capitol building, the monuments -- Washington, Jefferson, Lincoln -- are all instantly recognizable and they are illuminated each evening. But this spring the skyline is changing. The Hirshhorn Museum has commissioned a groundbreaking work of what's being billed as ''liquid architecture'' from the artist Doug Aitken, a site-specific installation that will envelope the Hirshhorn's spherical building with 11 high-definition screens and alter the cityscape of the National Mall from March 22 to May 16. In Mr. Aitken's installation -- called ''SONG 1'' -- 360 degrees of projections will encourage visitors to walk the perimeter of the museum; each viewing point offers a different vision, and perspective. From sunset to midnight, the screens will light up the night. SONG 1 is based around musical and cinematic interpretations of the song ''I Only Have Eyes for You.'' Some of the covers come from musicians -- Beck, James Murphy of LCD Soundsystem, Mountains, High Places, No Age, Lucky Dragons -- but some are spoken word, some simply recitations by actors."

2012-03-18T00:00:00Z,"If the British economy is flagging, it's no worse than it was in 1948, when London's last Summer Olympics earned the nickname the ''Austerity Games'' - an irony that hasn't gone unnoticed. Luckily the city's museums are stepping in to burnish its brand: two exhibitions focused on postwar British design are making the case that the country's economic tribulations have always coincided with periods of creative ascendancy. ''British Design 1948 to 2012,'' opening March 31 at the Victoria and Albert Museum, charts artistic upticks after the war, during the oil crisis in the '70s and after the recession in the '80s, when the ''creative salvage'' movement spurred the careers of designers like Tom Dixon. ''Designing Women,'' at the Fashion and Textile Museum, which opened March 16, focuses on the midcentury modern textile designs of Lucienne Day, Jacqueline Groag and Marian Mahler, and plays up a heroic moment of British ingenuity: three women inspired by the Bauhaus and the Secessionists rejected the chintzes and florals of the '30s and '40s and helped democratize modernism. This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print."

2012-03-18T00:00:00Z,"Amelia Forman was only 3 when her mother, the photographer Robin Schwartz, took her along to a photo shoot with a chimp. Schwartz was astonished by what happened. ''I went to photograph the chimp, and they kissed,'' Schwartz said. ''It was sort of odd.'' That set off nearly a decade of mother-daughter trips to photograph Amelia with animals. Now 12, Amelia projects a near-mystical calm into the camera: gazing into the eyes of kangaroos, nuzzling a capuchin monkey, staying still while a cotton-top tamarin paws through her hair. The animals are owned privately across the country, and Schwartz sounds out the owners in advance to ensure the situation is safe. She did have one scare, but says Amelia wasn't involved. Amelia plans to be a primatologist; Jane Goodall is a hero. She insists she has never been frightened around an animal. ''It's like being with a very little kid, except better,'' Amelia said. ''You can really understand them. You can almost talk to them.'' approximate number of rolls of film used on the amelia project: 3,000 number of years photographing animals: 31 number of years photographing animals with her daughter: 9 number of pets at home: 5"

(TCM) WHAT'S ON TONIGHT: EXOTIC PETS This Virginia McKenna-Bill Travers double bill begins with ''Born Free'' (1966), James Hill's drama, based on the 1960 autobiographic best seller by Joy Adamson, in which the married actors, above, play a game warden in Kenya and his wife who face a heartrending decision after Elsa, the orphaned lion club they have raised, becomes too big to keep. The composer John Barry won the Oscar for best original score and, with Don Black, for best original song for ''Born Free.'' Vincent Canby, writing in The New York Times, called the film ''a poignant but happy reminder of the beauty and mystery of the life cycle.'' In ''Ring of Bright Water'' (1969), at 10, Mr. Travers portrays a London civil service clerk whose life is changed when he decides to move Mij, his rambunctious pet-shop otter, to a village along the west Scottish coast.

Ms. Apple's low, dusky, bluesy contralto and her measured piano backup are ideal for her songs about obsession, self-destruction and self-invention.

After graduating from East Sydney Technical College, they were offered internships at John Galliano. They turned them down. ''We had never been to Europe, had no money and couldn't speak a word of French, so we decided to stay home and start our own thing,'' Ms. Plunkett said. Their first show, Regional Australia, celebrated small-town Aussie culture -- the designers held it at their local pub in Sydney and served barbecued sausages. Their spring 2012 collection, Happy Campers, was inspired by Girl Guides, 1970s camping equipment, Moroccan wedding rugs and German Scheurich ceramics, and will be available in the United States at Tenoversix in Los Angeles. But that doesn't mean that the designers are headed for the mainstream anytime soon. Remoteness, it seems, is also a state of mind. Says Ms. Plunkett, ''We are pretty much in our own bubble.''

2012-03-18T00:00:00Z,"IN college, I used to underline sentences that struck me, that made me look up from the page. They were not necessarily the same sentences the professors pointed out, which would turn up for further explication on an exam. I noted them for their clarity, their rhythm, their beauty and their enchantment. For surely it is a magical thing for a handful of words, artfully arranged, to stop time. To conjure a place, a person, a situation, in all its specificity and dimensions. To affect us and alter us, as profoundly as real people and things do. I remember reading a sentence by Joyce, in the short story ''Araby.'' It appears toward the beginning. ''The cold air stung us and we played till our bodies glowed.'' I have never forgotten it. This seems to me as perfect as a sentence can be. It is measured, unguarded, direct and transcendent, all at once. It is full of movement, of imagery. It distills a precise mood. It radiates with meaning and yet its sensibility is discreet."

Cruisers, hybrids and more can be rented at the McDonald's Cycle Center (312-729-1000), a state-of-the-art facility for commuters. Or buy your own: Working Bikes Cooperative (773-847-5440) sells restored discarded bikes on the cheap; J. C. Lind Bike Company (312-643-1670) and Copenhagen Cyclery (773-456-0024) carry the best Danish cargo bikes; Method Bicycle (312-965-8635) makes bespoke steel frames. Nothing heralds the city's status as a cycling stronghold quite like the newly opened Heritage Bicycles General Store (above; 773-245-3005), a bike shop-cafe where you can order a custom bike, get a tuneup, scarf a soup-and-salad lunch and tank up on Stumptown coffee, an export from that other great bike town, Portland, Ore. This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print."

It belongs to the men of the Robertson family of Louisiana, a clan that makes duck calls. The family has built the quack makers into a substantial business via some decidedly unbusinesslike practices. The series, which begins Wednesday night at 10 on A&E, follows the goings-on at Duck Commander, the family business, which sells handmade duck calls and other merchandise, as well as an image. The family has already had some television exposure on the Outdoor Channel with a series called ''Duck Commander,'' and everyone is pretty comfortable on camera, working the bayou-chic thing. In the premiere Willie Robertson, the chief executive, is exasperated because an order needs filling, but others in the clan seem more interested in trolling for catfish and hunting beavers than in replenishing the duck call supply. ''That's how you do it: You sell stuff, you make more stuff,'' he vents to the one unfortunate worker who is still at his post. ''You can't just sell stuff, run out of stuff and say, 'O.K., I guess it's over.' ''"

2012-03-18T00:00:00Z,"GOING into the nominating process for the annual fashion awards presented by the Council of Fashion Designers of America, there was a lot of debate as to which celebrity or cultural figure would be singled out for their style. After awards have been handed out to Michelle Obama, Iman and Lady Gaga in recent years, there was a bit of a feeling of who's left? Johnny Depp was a surprise choice, if not an inspired one. Among the special awards announced by the council on Wednesday, Mr. Depp was the first male recipient of the Fashion Icon Award, given ''for his personal and eclectic sense of style,'' which presumably is a euphemism for man mascara and shlumpy chic. In that regard, he is certainly one of the most deserving recipients in years. Other special awards, to be presented at Lincoln Center on June 4, will go to Rei Kawakubo of Comme des Garçons for international design, Andrew Rosen for the Founders Award and Tommy Hilfiger for lifetime achievement. Scott Schuman and Garance Doré, the street-style photographers, who are a couple off the clock, will be given the Media Award."

But for both photographers, there is an element of blind faith at work here. For the last six years, Mr. Ducklo has documented visually impaired visitors interacting with sculptures on touch tours at museums like MoMA and the Metropolitan Museum of Art. Mr. Monteith spent the better part of a year at the American Academy in Rome, where he captured tourists looking at the city's many monumental attractions (below right), seeking the precise moment when the artwork infiltrates the viewers' imagination and the act of looking becomes an act of seeing. ''You don't know how they are experiencing the work, but you know how it looks like they are experiencing it,'' Mr. Ducklo said regarding the slippery nature of perception.

''21 Jump Street,'' starring Jonah Hill and Channing Tatum and released by Sony and Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer, cost about $42 million to make and succeeded because -- brace yourselves -- it was actually funny. It received strong reviews, and moviegoers under age 25, the target audience, gave the film an A score in exit polls.

''John Carter'' (Walt Disney Studios) slumped to third place in its second weekend, selling an estimated $13.5 million for a new total of $53.2 million.

The new box office data was released on Monday at the same time that Disney Theatrical Productions - which mounts the film studio's properties on Broadway - announced that ''Newsies'' would run through August 19, instead of closing as originally planned on June 10. ''Newsies'' was always likely to be extended, and no one in New York theater circles will be surprised if Disney ultimately announces that the musical will have an open-ended run. Disney executives have been gaming expectations low for ''Newsies,'' as indicated by the limited run and the relatively modest roll-out (by Disney standards) of the musical. The reality is, ''Newsies'' already has strong buzz after its critically praised tryout run in suburban New Jersey last fall, and Broadway has few new family-oriented shows like ''Newsies'' this spring."

2012-03-20T00:00:00Z,"For nearly three generations, women have been taught that annual Pap smears, mammograms and visits with their doctor were essential to good health. Now all that is changing. National guidelines are urging less frequent screening for breast and cervical cancer. The declining use of menopause hormones means that older women no longer need to check in with their doctors to obtain annual refills. Women are delaying childbirth, and some birth control methods are effective for five years, giving women even less incentive to schedule a regular appointment."

After a luau in Oahu, they compete in a trivia game for a cash prize before embarking on a challenge for immunity. Then they take to the waves with Bethany Hamilton (above, flanked by Bob Harper, left, and Dolvett Quince), the competitive surfer who lost an arm in a shark attack at 13 while on a board off Tunnels Beach on Kauai. ''Soul Surfer,'' the movie about the efforts of Ms. Hamilton, played by AnnaSophia Robb, to resume competition and find comfort through Christianity, will be shown at 9 a.m. and 5 p.m. on Starz. 9 A.M. (HBO2) GEORGE HARRISON: LIVING IN THE MATERIAL WORLD (2011) Martin Scorsese uses interviews, music, film clips, photos and memorabilia to document Harrison's cultural trajectory from the Beatles to his later incarnation as a Renaissance man. The three-hour film ''is an argument for Harrison's essential role in the culture'' and ''for the continuing relevance of his explorations of Eastern thought,'' Mike Hale wrote in The New York Times. But, he added, it's Paul McCartney, ''even after all these years -- and even in Harrison's own film'' who ''still steals the show, every chance he gets.'' In ''My Life Without Me,'' at 2:45 p.m., Sarah Polley plays Ann, a 23-year-old working-class mother and wife who tries to turn the diagnosis that she has only a few months to live into the best thing that has ever happened to her. So she makes a list of things to do before dying: find a new wife for her husband (Scott Speedman), sleep with other people and make someone fall in love with her. Mark Ruffalo is the scruffy man who becomes enchanted, and Deborah Harry is Ann's embittered mother."
2012-03-20T00:00:00Z,"When the Andrew Freedman Home opened in the Bronx in 1924, it looked like a limestone luxury liner sailing up the Grand Concourse, a grandiosity that advertised its odd function: a privately endowed retirement home for the formerly well-to-do, those who might have lost their money but not their manners or manorial tastes. ''They were expected to have attained a state of reasonable culture,'' commented an article in The New Yorker at the time, ''and not to eat peas with their knives.'' Freedman, who died in 1915, had been an owner of the New York Giants baseball team and a financier of New York's first subway lines, and his unusual will created a retirement home as palazzo, with plush carpets, plentiful servants and formal dress required at dinner."
2012-03-20T00:00:00Z,"Times Square may be the place hardened New Yorkers go out of their way to avoid, but its importance as a magnet for commerce as well as tourists has risen rapidly in the last few years, according to a study to be released this week. The Times Square district directly and indirectly contributes one-tenth of all of the jobs in the city and $1 of every $9 of economic activity, says the study, which was commissioned by the Times Square Alliance, the de facto chamber of commerce for the district. That amounts to $110 billion in annual economic activity - about equal to the output of Portland, Ore. - emanating from the district, which the report defines as roughly a block on each side of Broadway between 40th and 53rd Streets."

It finally has one, with the director Christopher Alden's new production of Mozart's ''Così Fan Tutte,'' which opened at the Gerald W. Lynch Theater of John Jay College on Sunday afternoon. This is the third of only four productions in the company's modest season. And despite some confounding and heavy-handed touches in Mr. Alden's libidinous, darkly contemporary and bitterly comic staging, neither veteran opera buffs nor curious newcomers will want to miss this ''Così.'' It is performed by an appealing young cast in an intimate auditorium of about 600 seats, ideal for Mozart, with Christian Curnyn conducting a vibrant and stylish, if occasionally scrappy, performance."

The fellowships, $6,000 each, represent the latest effort to keep the Cunningham flame alive after his death in 2009 and the company's dissolution last year. The company's successor, the Merce Cunningham Trust, made the announcement on Tuesday, saying that ''pre-professional students'' had auditioned for the chance to take part in workshop rehearsals. A spokeswoman said they would not be paid, and that no performances are scheduled, although they have not been ruled out. ''It's sort of like an educational experience,'' said the spokeswoman, Leah Sandals. Most of the selected dancers are in university programs, she said."

2012-03-21T00:00:00Z,"FOR the past few years, the Breslin and the John Dory Oyster Bar in the Ace Hotel have made a good case for heading to the largely commercial wedge of Midtown Manhattan between Madison Square and Herald Square. A new restaurant called the NoMad, set to open on Monday in the hotel and the neighborhood of the same name, clinches the argument. The area's cobbled-together nickname (it means North of Madison Square Park) might even stick. Daniel Humm, the chef of Eleven Madison Park, and its manager, Will Guidara, are partners in this hotel restaurant, which is little more than a hop across the park from their home base. With a group of investors last fall, they bought Eleven Madison Park from their boss, Danny Meyer, and his Union Square Hospitality Group. The NoMad, the restaurant project that prompted Mr. Meyer to sell -- he says he did not want to keep Eleven Madison if the two were competing with him at a nearby restaurant -- is the second property for their company, Made Nice."

(Above, Greg Smith, left, and Jay Byars during an immunity challenge.) With both tribes living on the same site, drama runs high as the tribal council makes an unexpected decision. 1:30 P.M. (Sundance) GRIZZLY MAN (2005) Timothy Treadwell, who spent many of his summers living with and filming grizzly bears in the Katmai National Park and Preserve in Alaska, below, was killed in a bear attack in 2003, along with his girlfriend, Amie Huguenard. The director Werner Herzog combed through their footage to create this documentary, which casts an unsentimental eye on Treadwell's mission to protect the grizzlies and questions his preparation for life in the wilderness. Interviews with family members and friends shed light on Treadwell's past as an actor who struggled with addiction. And those who last saw him, including the medical examiner who performed his autopsy, depict him as a man who failed to appreciate the power and danger of nature. Writing in The New York Times, Manohla Dargis said that Treadwell's adventures with grizzlies amounted to ''a kind of performance, built on lies and truth and played out on the stage of celebrity.'' She added, ''Even though his choices were dangerous and finally fatal, he traveled a familiar American path shaped by boundless optimism and an almost religious belief in the self.''"

The company, eOne Music - the label formerly known as Koch - says it is selling the downloads to publicize its plans to reissue recordings by the Bach Guild, a label started in 1948 to make the composer's works more widely available. EOne Music said it also planned new recordings. The promotional issue covers 120 tracks, and includes the B minor Mass, harpsichord and flute works, the ''Italian Concerto,'' orchestral suites and the ''Brandenburg'' Concertos. Many of the versions hail from an earlier era of Bach interpretation, before a tendency to reduce the size of choruses and orchestras and play with a sharp eye toward period practice had set in, and they may sound dated to some ears. After Friday, the price goes up to $9.99 on digital retailers, eOne said."

They let her see the living market in its predawn hours and capture their words and faces: a loader named Philly, a retailer named Heschy, a journeyman named Sweet Pea and a fillet man named Vinny the Bone. What resulted were ''The Last Waterfront: The People of South Street'' (1984) and ''South Street'' (2007), portraits and oral histories collected by Ms. Mensch while the Fulton Fish Market was still vibrant. The fishmongers left for Hunts Point in the Bronx in 2005. Ms. Mensch stayed behind, in a loft she had restored by hand to preserve the large rings on the oak floors left by the brine barrels that once were stored there.

He organized a trip on the private NYC3 rail car attached to the last Amtrak train out of Grand Central Station in 1991, and was recently busy with arrangements for the 2013 Grand Central Centennial. He helped the late Peter Obletz save the elevated High Line from destruction, making possible its redevelopment as a pedestrian park. He promoted MTA efforts to turn the long-closed Delancey Street-Essex Street trolley station into an underground park or development. He conducted a lively video tour of the space, explaining how the baseball team Brooklyn has never forgotten was named after the borough's ""trolley dodgers,"" and spotlighted the decrepit dispatch tower as a potential future DJ booth for a nightclub.

2012-03-22T00:00:00Z,"In the space of a blog post we couldn't possibly summarize the story to date of R. Kelly's musical serial ''Trapped in the Closet,'' the continuing narrative of a homewrecker named Sylvester; Cathy, the married woman with whom he had an affair; her cuckolded husband, Rufus; and such dramatis personae as Roxanne, Twan, Pimp Lucius and Rosie the Nosy Neighbor. It's 22 chapters long (so far), and boy is it confusing, even if you've seen it. But R. Kelly will have further opportunities to untangle this narrative -- or to complicate it even more -- in a new series of ''Trapped in the Closet'' episodes that have been ordered by the IFC cable channel. IFC said it would begin showing new installments of R. Kelly's ''hip hopera'' later this year, as part of a programming lineup that emphasizes new comedy shows. The channel said it was also ordering a new series tentatively titled ''Maron,'' starring the comedian and podcaster Marc Maron in a fictionalized version of his life, and a new animated program called ''Out There,'' chronicling the lives of three small-town adolescent boys and created by Ryan Quincy, a former animation director for ''South Park.'' Both shows are planned for 2013."

The article and a picture caption also misstated the surname of a 19-year-old Florida student who is a fan of the sport. He is Chris Groves, not Jones. The article also misstated the number of fights that the Ultimate Fighting Championship, the sport's dominant brand, has a year in the United States. It is about 21, not 15. And because of an editing error, the article also referred incompletely to the U.F.C. title held by Georges St-Pierre. While he is considered the current welterweight champion, an interim champion was determined in a fight in February because Mr. St-Pierre was not able to defend his title because of an injury.

The centennial of the Titanic disaster is April 14, and publishers appear to be hoping readers maintain an appetite for it. The number of Titanic-related books that have crossed my desk recently borders on the comical. But to dip into almost any of them is to be riveted by a story that remains eerie, dramatic and heartbreaking."

2012-03-24T00:00:00Z,"Oskar Eustis, the artistic director of the Public Theater, has put more distance between the theater and the monologist Mike Daisey, who was found to have fabricated details in his one-man show ''The Agony and the Ecstasy of Steve Jobs,'' which just finished a hugely successful run at the Public. In remarks offered Thursday night before a panel discussion on the fallout from the revelations, Mr. Eustis was more critical of Mr. Daisey than he had been after the radio show ''This American Life'' first disclosed that incidents recounted in the stage production, about Apple's labor practices in China, had been invented or embellished. The radio show had run a lengthy excerpt of ''The Agony and the Ecstasy,'' only to retract it after discovering the inaccuracies."

2012-03-24T00:00:00Z,"In this weekend's Your Money column, I look at the many insurance questions that come up about the burgeoning peer-to-peer car-sharing industry. The basic question is this: If you turn your car into a Zipcar, in effect, what are the odds that you could end up in some sort of trouble if someone rents your car and then crashes it and hurts someone? I raise three questions in the piece. First, whether you could be on the hook for an enormous judgment, beyond the $1 million in coverage that a company like RelayRides provides. Second, whether your failure to maintain the car properly could leave you exposed if someone rents it and gets in an accident because of, say, your bald tires."

Today, the cavernous church is silent, closed down earlier this year after mounting costs and dwindling resources. Yet its spiritual life persists - face it, prayerful resolve is a special gift in Morrisania. Most of the parish's 300 members now trek a mile away to Our Lady of Victory. Others staff the food pantry, which feeds more than 400 people each week. And a core of devoted church ladies still gathers at a small chapel for weekly Bible study."
