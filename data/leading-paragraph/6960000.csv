2007-07-22T00:00:00Z,"At present, the U.S. defense budget accounts for approximately half of total global defense spending, while the U.S. armed forces employ about 1.68 million uniformed members. By comparison, the State Department employs about 6,000 foreign service officers, while the U.S. Agency for International Development has about 2,000. In other words, the Department of Defense is about 210 times larger than USAID and State combined -- there are substantially more people employed as musicians in Defense bands than in the entire foreign service."

She began working for the New York Times in 1947, where she remained for over 40 years. During this time, she met and married one of the editors, Thomas Brew. He passed away in 1974. A devoted patron of the arts and theatre, Norma corresponded with many actors, musicians, and dancers worldwide, often traveling abroad to attend their performances. She was loved by all whose lives she so gracefully touched. Norma will be remembered for her eloquent writing, her charming sense of humor, and her sincere devotion to her friends. She will be deeply missed by her friends and family. Services were private. Donations in her memory may be made to the Alzheimer's Association."

2007-07-22T00:00:00Z,"IN the pitch-black din of the Whale Inside Dark Restaurant in Beijing, a table of 30 diners was getting rowdy. ''I'm touching your head!'' said one, like a mischievous child. ''Who just said that?'' another replied. The disembodied voices floated across the boisterous 90-plus-seat restaurant, but no one could see who was talking, except for the waiters, who were outfitted with military-grade night-vision goggles. In a new twist on conceptual dining, restaurants are turning off the lights to focus attention on the food. The trend seems to have started in Zurich and has since spawned permutations all over the world, with diners donning blindfolds, sitting in unlit rooms and, lately, being served by waiters in night-vision goggles. The idea is that by depriving one sense (sight), other senses are heightened."

2007-07-22T00:00:00Z,"To the Editor: I find it off-putting that Richard Dawkins was selected to review Michael Behe's new book, even though I favor Dawkins's position on intelligent design. Is it surprising that Dawkins's review would be concerned only with discrediting Behe? Hardly: their public rivalry dictated the review's content before the book was even published. Dawkins's criticism was not only predictable, it was -- literally -- also a page taken from his own book, ''The God Delusion'' (Page 130). What intelligent design would have allowed the editors to go ahead with this assignment? Can your readers expect Ayatollah Ali Khamenei to review Rushdie's new book? Hyperbole aside, this review offered nothing that I could not get from reading Dawkins, and prevented a meaningful glimpse of an alternative viewpoint."
2007-07-22T00:00:00Z,"In France, Bernard-Henri Lévy is famous for his impeccably tailored open-necked shirts, the glamorous company he keeps, and a string of 30 books on subjects ranging from European intellectuals' misguided dalliance with Marxism (''Barbarism With a Human Face'') to the legacy of Jean-Paul Sartre (''Sarte: The Philosopher of the 20th Century'') to post-9/11 Islamic radicalism (''Who Killed Daniel Pearl?''). Over here, he's better known as the guy who traveled from the Baseball Hall of Fame to evangelical megachurches to Las Vegas lap-dance parlors researching his book ''American Vertigo: Traveling America in the Footsteps of Tocqueville,'' which earned him a spot on the Times best-seller list (and, in these pages, a memorable trip to the woodshed courtesy of Garrison Keillor). This week, Lévy takes the measure of the newly elected French president, Nicolas Sarkozy. Sarkozy's candidacy divided France's left-leaning intelligentsia, with a number of Lévy's fellow ''new philosophers'' -- as the anti-Communist thinkers who came of age in the 1970s are known -- declaring their support. But despite sympathy with Sarkozy's foreign policy and ''anti-anti-American'' outlook, Lévy could not endorse the tough-talking conservative.

2007-07-22T00:00:00Z,"The ROCK THE BELLS festival on Randalls Island might seem like a 10-year-old memory, because the headliners are Rage Against the Machine and Wu-Tang Clan, who toured together in 1997. It was a weird double bill back then: Wu-Tang played its trademark desultory, tricksterish set in a state of high flux -- it was hard to tell who was onstage, who was missing, who was just along for the ride -- while Rage Against the Machine fans pawed and snorted and stamped the ground. Then, when Rage appeared, at the first power chord, kaboom: frat-boy hell, or heaven, depending on your taste. Wu-Tang has never quite gone away, while Rage Against the Machine officially broke up, then re-formed. But the rest of the touring festival's lineup puts their pairing of the two headliners in a context that unites them. This is an alternative festival for rock fans and old hip-hop heads, nostalgic mostly for the late '90s, with a little mid-'80s thrown in as well; it includes the Roots, Mos Def, Cypress Hill, Mr. Lif, Rakim, EPMD, Erykah Badu and Public Enemy.

2007-07-22T00:00:00Z,"To the Editor: Niall Ferguson, with whom I have differed repeatedly over his defense of imperialism, needlessly tries to start a fight between Paul Collier and me in his review of Collier's ''Bottom Billion'' (July 1). I applaud Collier's excellent new book and thank him for including kind references to my own work therein. The very idea of the poverty trap as being critical in Africa, a concept at the core of ''The Bottom Billion,'' has likewise been a core theme of my own writings on Africa, indeed a central theme of my book ''The End of Poverty.'' The notion of different factors contributing to the poverty trap is also a theme common to both our research efforts. For my part, I have worked hard to introduce in the academic literature and policy discussions the idea that poverty is involved in vicious circles related to violence, natural resources, landlockedness and other geographic factors, and poor governance."

However, as a resident of Savannah, I object to the disservice done to the low-income but quite safe and respectable community of Pin Point, Ga., by calling it ''a scene of rural desolation,'' ''black life in the rural South at its bleakest'' and ''this sociological nightmare.'' By the way, the crab factory is long gone, but it provided a living for some when few other opportunities were available. The owner kept it operating as long as possible for the sake of the employees, but eventually succumbed to economics. I am sure the good citizens of Pin Point feel fortunate in comparison with residents of the ghettos of large cities, especially in the North."

Besides requests for mamma's recipe for spaghetti all'amatriciana (a bacon and tomato sauce typical of the Lazio region), call center workers had plenty of stories for the Messagero reporter: the concerned citizen who phoned in to report a ""suspicious looking pigeon"" during the bird flu scare; the motorist who called to find out whether zero is an odd or an even number, during a day where traffic was limited to odd number license plates. In fact, calling 060606 is extremely useful if you live in Rome and are forced to navigate the capital's bureaucratic intricacies on a regular basis. It also provides information on other sundry questions, like where to pick up a parked car that's been towed away, or where to bring a pigeon with a broken wing (the bird center next to the zoo, as it happens). But tourists may find it useful, too (though for information on exhibitions and museum hours and other similar queries, callers are rerouted to a tourist information line - 06 82059127 - which operates daily from 9 AM to 7:30 PM).

2007-07-23T00:00:00Z,"Take 390,500 oil barrels, pile them horizontally 500 feet high in the desert of the United Arab Emirates, and what have you got? Another project of the artist Christo and his wife, Jeanne-Claude, Agence France-Presse reported. ''The Emirates is very keen to see this project realized,'' Christo said in St.-Paul de Vence, France, at a presentation of models and drawings for the monument. The idea for the pyramid, with a flat summit, dates to the 1960s, the artists said, but two earlier attempts to erect it, in Texas and the Netherlands, went nowhere. Unlike previous ephemeral projects, like the wrapping of the Reichstag in 1995 and the saffron ''Gates'' in Central Park in 2005, the so-called Mastaba project, in orange-yellow and about two-thirds the height of the Eiffel Tower, would not be dismantled. ''Arab states are less susceptible to provisional works and change,'' Christo said. And unlike previous projects, financed by the artists' selling of models and drawings, this one, if it comes to fruition, would be paid for by Abu Dhabi. Meanwhile Christo and Jean-Claude are planning to conclude nine years of planning by covering about six miles of the Arkansas River in Colorado with clear fabric in the installation ''Over the River'' for two weeks in July and August 2011.Citing health concerns, the conductor James Levine, below, music director of the Boston Symphony Orchestra, has withdrawn from his appearances this summer at the Verbier Festival in Switzerland, where he was to have led the opening concert Friday and the Mozart Requiem yesterday, PlaybillArts.com reported. ''My doctors have strongly advised me not to travel but to stay calm and collect my energies,'' he said in a statement released by the festival. Bernadette Horgan, a spokeswoman for the Boston Symphony Orchestra, said Mr. Levine remains at Tanglewood, working with students and planning to conduct all his scheduled concerts there before taking the ensemble on a European tour from Aug. 26 through Sept. 7."

2007-07-24T00:00:00Z,"Nearly six months before the first primary votes are cast, the contrast between the presidential fields of the two parties is stark and, historically speaking, quite surprising. There is still time for things to change, but among Democrats, the situation has been remarkably consistent for months, Democratic strategists and some polls say. Senator Hillary Rodham Clinton of New York is establishing herself as the Democrat to beat. Senator Barack Obama of Illinois is building a broad and, it appears, enthusiastic network as he challenges Mrs. Clinton. Former Senator John Edwards of North Carolina is struggling in states like South Carolina, Democrats say, as he bets his chips on Iowa, but is staying on the radar screen by setting out policy positions and striking a more aggressive stance."
2007-07-24T00:00:00Z,"As many states continue to jockey for early dates in the presidential nomination process, most American voters would like to establish a single national primary day, according to a recent New York Times/CBS News poll. Nearly three-quarters of the registered voters polled said they would prefer one nationwide day of contests to select each party's presidential nominee, although Republicans are slightly less inclined than Democrats and independents to support such a change in the long-established system of separately scheduled state primaries and caucuses."

But in the process of creating “Birds of America,” considered by some to be the most beautiful book of the 19th century, Audubon (above) killed thousands of his fine feathered friends. He played the part of an American pioneer in the drawing rooms of Europe, and of a debonair European on the frontier. Faithful in his own way to his wife, he nonetheless regaled her with details of his encounters with other women. Jailed for bankruptcy, he went on to dine at the White House and to be praised by royalty yet was still blackballed by both his in-laws and the Philadelphia Academy of Natural Sciences. This “American Masters” documentary tries to reconcile a few of Audubon’s contradictions."

Asked if the department would comply, its spokesman, Paul J. Browne, pointed out that the department had already turned over reports on its raw data to the City Council, as required by law. The reports showed a fivefold increase in the number of stop-and-frisks from 2002 to last year, with more than half of them involving black residents. The civil liberties group wants to analyze each of the 508,540 street stops last year, as well as those from the first half of this year. The department commissioned the RAND Corporation, a nonprofit organization, to conduct an independent assessment of the stops, Mr. Browne said. He added, &#8220;In terms of race, the data showed that stops were consistent proportionately with descriptions provided by victims of violent crime.&#8221; The Council speaker, Christine C. Quinn, said yesterday that the Council expected the police to provide the data to citizens and that if they did not, the Council would &#8220;take appropriate action.&#8221;."

For 20 years, he carried the European Tour on his back, winning three British Opens, two Masters and 87 tournaments worldwide. Europe owes much of its Ryder Cup success to his fiery leadership.

Several sources of potable water and eight campsites, available free on a first-come, first-served basis, are spread along the trail.

2007-07-26T00:00:00Z,"Frederick Wessler always took photographs, even when he was a foley artist (the one who puts the sounds in) for film and television. But don't confuse the vivid computer-generated prints of domestic objects and scenes he began making after he retired -- a Stillson wrench, above; a Wellfleet, Mass., front door at high noon; the narrow hall of his Chelsea tenement apartment building -- with photographs. Mr. Wessler, 62, uses three-dimensional modeling and rendering software to build, light and give texture and color to his images. He's drawn to things that have a history, like his father's wrench, which he remembers from his childhood and which he found recently while cleaning out his parents' house. ''You try to bring out that ineffable quality that is lurking somewhere in an object,'' Mr. Wessler said, describing how he tweaked the wrench's bruises and chipped paint, amplifying them in the computer to create, as he described it, the illusion of verisimilitude. ''If my pictures work, you should get a sense that something has happened or is about to happen,'' he said. Prints range from $250 to $500. Information: www.wessler3d.com. PENELOPE GREEN"

Over fifty years of providing housing on Long Island, you set the standard for the industry and raised the bar for everyone. Having worked for you is something we will always treasure. We never felt like employees; you made us feel like family. You were the captain of our ship and a father figure to us all. To have known you was a gift, to have worked for you an honor. The management and staff of Fairhaven Properties NELKIN--Myron. A loving husband, father, and grandfather, a visionary real estate developer, a friend and mentor to his employees, a generous supporter of a variety of charitable causes, and an avid golfer in his spare time, Myron Nelkin passed away on Sunday, July 22, at North Shore University Hospital in Manhasset. Born in Brooklyn on January 5, 1925, Mr. Nelkin was a student at Boys High in Brooklyn and graduated from Columbia University with a degree in business in 1946. With his father, Harry L. Nelkin, DDS, he began his working life building homes in Queens and Long Island. He founded three companies, Fairhaven Properties, Nelkin Construction Corp., and Central Management, and built all of Long Island's Fairhaven apartment complexes and the Woodbury Gardens senior residence. What Mr. Nelkin considered his crowning achievement was the rebuilding of The Garden City Hotel on the site of the storied original, where Charles Lindbergh slept in 1927 on the night before his trans-Atlantic flight. The completely new construction opened in 1983 on 21 acres in the heart of Garden City. Lavishly landscaped and decorated, lively and bright, the acclaimed establishment maintains a sense of its place in the history of Long Island, as Mr. Nelkin wished. When in New York, he called the penthouse suite his home. Mr. Nelkin generously supported the Helen Keller Home for the Blind, the North ShoreLong Island Jewish Health System, Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center, Family Services of Nassau County, Christa House, the Hart Foundation for Parkinson's Research, and the Tilles Center, as well as Jewish philanthropies and causes. He is survived by his wife, Barbara (nee Norinsberg); his children, Henry L. Nelkin, Mindy Nelkin, and Cathy Nelkin-Miller and her husband, Charles Miller; his grandchildren, Rachel, John, and James Schwartz and Robert Miller; and his brother and sister-inlaw, William and Trudi Nelkin. A private interment was held at Beth David Cemetery in Elmont. The family is sitting shiva at the hotel on Wednesday and Thursday, July 25 and July 26 from 2-4PM and 79PM. NELKIN--Myron. A man of great kindness, generosity and wisdom. Garden City will always be in his debt for his vision and creativity. Our deepest sympathy to his wife Barbara, daughters Mindy and Cathy, son Henry and grandchildren. Mary and Bob Krener NELKIN--Myron: We were so very proud to have been named your first ever Executive Committee. Representing The Garden City Hotel is not a job; it is our pleasure and greatest honor. We will always try to set the same standards for the staff that you set for us. We will help to carry on your legacy and continue to strive to be Long Island's finest hotel. You will always be our leader. You will be remembered every day, and your heart and soul will continue to be the driving force of this operation. The Executive Committee of The Garden City Hotel"

Recently, he began producing a miniature version that he calls his ''gin-and-tonic bus stop'' -- a 6-by-10-foot pagoda he devised on impulse, he said, so he could ''sit, look at the garden, and have a gin and tonic.'' (After a friend likened it to a bus stop, the nickname stuck.) ''The shop work took just over a week,'' added Mr. Brackett, 60, above, ''and then it took two days to assemble.'' The structure, above, also known as the Summer House, is made of three types of wood -- sugar pine, incense cedar and Port Orford cedar -- and has the same complex joinery, above right and top, as Mr. Brackett's larger houses. ''In terms of quality, there is no difference between this and the houses I charge $2 million to design and build,'' he said, although this one costs $19,000, plus shipping (it comes in two crates). ''It's a pure architectural form -- there are no utilities, no planning expenses and no permitting, which is how I am able to make it so cheaply.''"

David was regularly sought out for advice and counsel. Where others caused problems, David solved them, and provided a sense of safety and security to all those around him. He was the rock of his family and his untimely passing leaves behind a huge void in all our hearts. David had a zest for life, a joke for every occasion, and a style that was all his own. He cut a dashing figure in his signature fedora, cigar, and bowtie. And his law office was lavishly filled with rare and unique artworks, many of which were collected as gifts from people he helped around the world. A profoundly spiritual man, with complete and utter faith in God, he davvened daily at the Chabad of Midtown Manhattan, was a member of Orach Chaim, and supported countless shuls throughout his many travels. Following a memorial service in New York on August 23, David was laid to rest in the esteemed Ponovich cemetery in B'nei Brak, Israel just moments before Shabbos August 24, alongside his father Asher and mother Aliza.

2007-07-26T00:00:00Z,"FARBER--Lillian. Beloved mother, cherished life-partner, devoted sister, aunt, sister - in - law, mother - in - law, grandmother and dear friend, Lillian Farber died on July 23rd, 2007, just two weeks shy of her 87th birthday. She possessed a world-class mind. A passionate lifelong reader, who absorbed the printed word at a speed frightening to anyone who saw her read a page, she was a mesmerizing conversationalist insightful, curious, perceptive, and devilish with a self-deprecating wit. She was also a beauty, and a dynamo. Social justice and politics energized her: in the mid-1950's, while raising four children, she spearheaded a campaign to strengthen the Democratic Party in Westchester County by running twice as the Democratic candidate for a seat on the town council of Greenburgh, then a heavily Republican enclave. She helped lead a successful fight to integrate the Hartsdale public schools, was an activist in the League of Women Voters, and a leader in the Brandeis National Women's Committee, a group dedicated to raising funds for the young university's libraries. Having graduated from NYU in three years, she went back to school in the mid-1960's, obtaining a Master's degree from Sarah Lawrence College in sociology in 1966, becoming director of the college's Upward Bound program (an intensive academic program for inner-city high school students), and then Dean of Student Services. In the mid-1970's, Lillian moved to Newfane, Vermont. There, she was vice president of Zone VI Studios, a manufacturer of photographic equipment. While helping to build and run the company, she found time to devote herself to local political campaigns in Vermont, to serve on the Vermont Council of the Arts, to chair the board of the Moore Free Library in Newfane, to officiate at civil unions and marriages as a justice of the peace, and, finally, to serve on the board of trustees of Marlboro College, an institution whose humanistic values she cherished. With a sense of adventure and mission, Lillian took on the role of chair of the Marlboro trustees' finance committee. She was fearless approaching potential donors, and unfailingly persuasive. Three Marlboro presidents, as well as members of the faculty and staff, counted on her for her counsel and foresight. She joined the board of trustees in 1982, served four years as chair in the 1990's, and became a member emeritus in May 2005. Lillian had an artists eye for photography: she built a distinguished collection that included works of Fred Picker, Paul Strand, Eugene Atget, Edward Weston, Alfred Steiglitz, Dorothea Lange, and Paul Caponigro, among others. In 2006, she donated the collection to Marlboro College. Her beloved son, Robert, who predeceased her, was a noted painter. Sister of the late Natalie Steinbock, she is survived by her life-partner, Bern Friedelson; children Lindy Linder, Peggy Farber, and Felicia and Charles Gervais; a sister, Florence Isbell; four grandchildren, Liza and Luke Linder and Benjamin and Samuel Jacoff; beloved nieces, nephew, and brothers-in-law; and dear ones, Susan Friedelson and Lori Schreiner.

Her beloved husband David was at her bedside, holding her hand to the last minute, just shy of their 60th anniversary on October 18th. Hortense went straight from High School to a job as a receptionist at the Neiman Marcus Buying office in New York. The ''Job'' became a lifetime career. 57 years later she retired in 1999 as the Director of the office. Executives throughout the organization learned to turn to Horty to help solve a wide variety of questions and problems. The late Stanley Marcus penned a six-paragraph letter when he learned of her impending departure. ''There are not many people in big or little organizations who have been so successful in administering a position and at the same time meeting the varied demands, requests and hopes of so many individuals.'' She cherished her many opportunities to assist him. A broad smile and a generous disposition were her trademarks. Too busy to have children, Horty filled the gap with nieces and nephews, and their offspring, plus numerous friends and business acquaintances. Sister Leah provided Bob and Wendy, who in turn brought forth grandnephew Lee. He called Hortense ''Aunt Hotty'' and achieved star status very early. Brother Morty produced David, Bill, Joyce and Susie and more grand nieces and nephews. Many personal and business friends are still at hand -Irene and Jerry and their children, also Gloria, Bill B. and his offspring, Ellie and children, Donald and Fran, Addie and Eddie, and celebrities Alvin Colt and Jerry Sorbara. Our Faithful aides Nicole, Prudence and Grace who helped her resist that terrible disease. David is hanging in tearfully, content that he could keep his darling by his side to the last second.

Women's sleeping bags are particularly popular. Sales almost doubled from 2004 to 2006, according to the Leisure Trends Group, a market-research company. ''Before, if you bought a piece of gear that was for a woman, it was a downsized men's version and was painted pink,'' said Kristine Carey, the brand manager for Sierra Designs. These days, some makers offer substantial differences that they assume women want: more insulation for cold feet, wider hip space and less room in the shoulders for drafts. But women taller than 5-foot-9, beware: bags for women tend to be shorter than unisex ones."

The man, Darryl Barnes, was awarded $51 million after a 2003 trial; the amount was later reduced by the judge to $10.75 million. But yesterday, the Appellate Division of State Supreme Court ruled that the trial judge had improperly excused Mr. Barnes from testifying because he was mentally disabled, even though he had been found competent at an earlier hearing. Instead, the court allowed pretrial testimony from Mr. Barnes to be read. The court ruled that this deprived the city of its right to cross-examine him. Mr. Barnes&#8217;s lawyer, Robert M. Simels, said yesterday that he would appeal."

A loving husband, father, and grandfather, a visionary real estate developer, a friend and mentor to his employees, a generous supporter of a variety of charitable causes, and an avid golfer in his spare time, Myron Nelkin passed away on Sunday, July 22, at North Shore University Hospital in Manhasset. Born in Brooklyn on January 5, 1925, Mr. Nelkin was a student at Boys High in Brooklyn and graduated from Columbia University with a degree in business in 1946. With his father, Harry L. Nelkin, DDS, he began his working life building homes in Queens and Long Island. He founded three companies, Fairhaven Properties, Nelkin Construction Corp., and Central Management, and built all of Long Island's Fairhaven apartment complexes and the Woodbury Gardens senior residence. What Mr. Nelkin considered his crowning achievement was the rebuilding of The Garden City Hotel on the site of the storied original, where Charles Lindbergh slept in 1927 on the night before his trans-Atlantic flight. The completely new construction opened in 1983 on 21 acres in the heart of Garden City. Lavishly landscaped and decorated, lively and bright, the acclaimed establishment maintains a sense of its place in the history of Long Island, as Mr. Nelkin wished. When in New York, he called the penthouse suite his home. Mr. Nelkin generously supported the Helen Keller Home for the Blind, the North ShoreLong Island Jewish Health System, Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center, Family Services of Nassau County, Christa House, the Hart Foundation for Parkinson's Research, and the Tilles Center, as well as Jewish philanthropies and causes. He is survived by his wife, Barbara (nee Norinsberg); his children, Henry L. Nelkin, Mindy Nelkin, and Cathy Nelkin-Miller and her husband, Charles Miller; his grandchildren, Rachel, John, and James Schwartz and Robert Miller; and his brother and sister-inlaw, William and Trudi Nelkin. A private interment was held at Beth David Cemetery in Elmont. NELKIN--Myron. Our heartfelt sympathy to Barbara and her beautiful family. May their cherished memories live in their hearts forever. Maxine and Skip Pines NELKIN--Myron. My darling husband, I miss you already. The children and I are heartbroken. Thank you for providing us with a life full of wonderful, loving memories and for being our hero. Our love for you will live on, and you will live in our hearts and souls forever.

No? Hasn't happened yet? Just you wait; in a city of cultural know-it-alls, no chink in the knowledge body armor is too small to be exploited. Thankfully, the Lincoln Center Festival has anticipated your needs with the North American premiere of ''Mongolia: Music, Dance & Ballad.'' This 90-minute concert, under the artistic direction of the French ethnomusicologist Alain Desjacques, offers a crash course in biyelgee, the traditional pastoral dances of the Qoton and Bayad people. Typically performed by men in the limited space offered by a yurt, these solo dances center on the upper body and incorporate an everyday gestural language based on various nomadic activities. A two-stringed fiddle called a khuur is the only accompaniment, but the rest of the performance combines a host of fascinating-sounding instruments (including the tsuur, or Mongolian vertical lute) and singing techniques, like the vocal art of khoomii, in which multiple tones are produced simultaneously. Bring your notebook and then head to the next available cocktail party.

All the Keaton poetry is here in this tale of a tintype photographer whose desire to impress a girl, Sally (Marceline Day), leads him to great feats and disasters as a newsreel cameraman. There's Keaton the actor (watch how he nestles his head onto Sally's shoulder, a picture of bliss); Keaton the physical marvel (running to catch up with a bus, he leaps, lands neatly with legs outstretched on a fender and resumes his chat with Sally); Keaton the accidental avant-gardist (the film he shoots for the newsreel company suggests the experimentation of Dziga Vertov's ''Man With a Movie Camera,'' a Soviet masterpiece of 1929); and, everywhere, Keaton the virtuoso (his solitary baseball game in an empty Yankee Stadium is just one example). Signing with MGM, Keaton later said, was ''the worst mistake of my career.'' It meant scripts, schedules, regimentation; after this film he would never again work in the free, improvisatory way that was so essential to his genius. If ''The Cameraman'' is for the ages, ''Speedy,'' the 1928 Harold Lloyd vehicle sharing Monday's double bill, is beautifully of its age, the Jazz Age, which perhaps found its purest physical expression in New York. Lloyd's Speedy, a cabbie in a hurry, races up and down city streets, at one point picking up Babe Ruth, in a nifty cameo. ''Gee, Babe,'' Speedy says, ''you've done more for baseball than cheese did for Switzerland.''

The cause of death was heart failure. His almost 30 year career with the noted architectural firm began in 1948. He was involved in many projects in the U.S. as well as in Germany, South Africa and France. He retired from SOM in 1975 after establishing a Paris office for the firm.

2007-07-27T00:00:00Z,"In an interview with USA Today J. K. Rowling, the author of the blockbuster Harry Potter series, said she was working on two books, one for children and one for adults. She said she was unlikely to revisit Harry or the other characters in the monumentally successful series that concluded at 12:01 a.m. on Saturday with the official release of ''Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows,'' the seventh installment. Ms. Rowling, who with earnings of about $1 billion is probably the richest living author, lashed out at those who attempted to spoil the ending by uploading photos of every page of the book to Internet file-sharing sites the week before the book went on sale. ''I felt angry,'' she said. ''I knew it was about other people's egos.'' Nevertheless Ms. Rowling herself talked openly about the book's ending, less than a week after the novel went on sale and likely before millions of readers -- despite the quick-reading habits of the most ardent fans -- have finished it. (On its Web site USA Today cloaked her remarks behind a link clearly marked as a spoiler alert; in the print edition a spoiler alert caption marked the relevant paragraphs.) Although Ms. Rowling has said she had the entire series mapped out in her head from the first book, she said in the interview that there were two characters who die in ''Deathly Hallows'' that she at one point ''intended to keep alive.''"

2007-07-27T00:00:00Z,"FARBER--Lillian. Beloved mother, cherished life-partner, devoted sister, aunt, sister - in - law, mother - in - law, grandmother and dear friend, Lillian Farber died on July 23rd, 2007, just two weeks shy of her 87th birthday. She possessed a world-class mind. A passionate lifelong reader, who absorbed the printed word at a speed frightening to anyone who saw her read a page, she was a mesmerizing conversationalist insightful, curious, perceptive, and devilish with a self-deprecating wit. She was also a beauty, and a dynamo. Social justice and politics energized her: in the mid-1950's, while raising four children, she spearheaded a campaign to strengthen the Democratic Party in Westchester County by running twice as the Democratic candidate for a seat on the town council of Greenburgh, then a heavily Republican enclave. She helped lead a successful fight to integrate the Hartsdale public schools, was an activist in the League of Women Voters, and a leader in the Brandeis National Women's Committee, a group dedicated to raising funds for the young university's libraries. Having graduated from NYU in three years, she went back to school in the mid-1960's, obtaining a Master's degree from Sarah Lawrence College in sociology in 1966, becoming director of the college's Upward Bound program (an intensive academic program for inner-city high school students), and then Dean of Student Services. In the mid-1970's, Lillian moved to Newfane, Vermont. There, she was vice president of Zone VI Studios, a manufacturer of photographic equipment. While helping to build and run the company, she found time to devote herself to local political campaigns in Vermont, to serve on the Vermont Council of the Arts, to chair the board of the Moore Free Library in Newfane, to officiate at civil unions and marriages as a justice of the peace, and, finally, to serve on the board of trustees of Marlboro College, an institution whose humanistic values she cherished. With a sense of adventure and mission, Lillian took on the role of chair of the Marlboro trustees' finance committee. She was fearless approaching potential donors, and unfailingly persuasive. Three Marlboro presidents, as well as members of the faculty and staff, counted on her for her counsel and foresight. She joined the board of trustees in 1982, served four years as chair in the 1990's, and became a member emeritus in May 2005. Lillian had an artists eye for photography: she built a distinguished collection that included works of Fred Picker, Paul Strand, Eugene Atget, Edward Weston, Alfred Steiglitz, Dorothea Lange, and Paul Caponigro, among others. In 2006, she donated the collection to Marlboro College. Her beloved son, Robert, who predeceased her, was a noted painter. Sister of the late Natalie Steinbock, she is survived by her life-partner, Bern Friedelson; children Lindy Linder, Peggy Farber, and Felicia and Charles Gervais; a sister, Florence Isbell; four grandchildren, Liza and Luke Linder and Benjamin and Samuel Jacoff; beloved nieces, nephew, and brothers-in-law; and dear ones, Susan Friedelson and Lori Schreiner.

2007-07-27T00:00:00Z,"ABDULLAH IBRAHIM Last September the pianist Abdullah Ibrahim presided over the premiere of the Cape Town Jazz Orchestra, an ensemble officially sponsored by South Africa's Department of Arts and Culture. For Mr. Ibrahim, above, the event was personally as well as historically significant. Born in a Cape Town ghetto in 1934 -- and, before his conversion to Islam, widely known as Dollar Brand -- Mr. Ibrahim left home in the mid-1970s because of apartheid and other political pressures. (Another consideration was the safety and education of his two children with the jazz singer Sathima Bea Benjamin; their daughter, Tsidi Ibrahim, is the rapper known as Jean Grae.) Since Mr. Ibrahim's return to Cape Town in the early '90s, an act of reclamation as well as a sign of faith, he has been celebrated not only as a pioneer of South African jazz but also as a cultural eminence, precisely the sort of elder statesman to lead a national jazz orchestra. Thankfully his style hasn't puffed up or stiffened, judging by the most recent recorded evidence. ''African Magic'' is a generous-spirited trio album, by turns sprightly and serene, released in 2002 on the German label Enja. (Like Mr. Ibrahim's previous two albums, the live trio release ''Cape Town Revisited'' and the chamber-symphonic ''African Suite,'' it's available in North America through Justin Time Records.)"

When he was seized and held captive by the Russians for four days, he emerged unharmed, except, as he later reported, ''for an overexposure to sauerkraut soup.'' At age 45 he was named managing director of Time Life International, and later he was a key officer of Fortune and Architectural Forum Back in the United Stated. He capped his magazine career as a group vice-president and secretary of Time, Inc., and he became the company's chief administrative officer. He was a member of the U.S Olympic Committee, and he was a consultant to the Commissioner of Baseball. Charles' business wit was legendary. He was a man of few words or many words depending on the occasion. For example, when he recommended to the Time Inc board that a small chain of weeklies be divested, he cogently summarized his judgement with these words: ''...(This company) is something of an appendage to the corporation, a vestigial tail that the dog wouldn't bother to wag if he could.'' He will be missed by his former colleagues for his wit and charm, but he will also be remembered for his brilliant hard-nosed leadership in the world-wide expansion of Time Inc.

It was released in 1969, not 1970, and it was Mr. Altman's third feature as a director, not his ''first venture into longer narrative filmmaking.''"

Your generosity and tremendous heart will be remembered forever. You were larger than life to us all. You were a brilliant man, and the legacy you built will be carried on by the family you loved. We are surrounded by everything you accom plished, and your heart and soul will never leave us. You are our superhero, and we know superheroes live forever. Watch down on us, and continue to guide us through life. We love you, Dad. From your children, Henry, Mindy, Cathy and Charlie NELKIN--Myron. Grandpa, we miss you so much. You were the best grandfather in the whole world, and we are blessed for having known you, loved you, and for being loved by you. You taught us the meaning of hard work and integrity. Each of us hopes to be half the person you were and would consider that a wonderful life. To watch you lead others and help those who were in need has inspired us to do great things with our lives. Even though you had to leave us, we will think of you as we confront every decision and know you would be proud. Thank you for being so present in our lives. You were a force of strength, and we will strive to fulfill the expectations you had for us. The family was everything to you. Now its our turn to carry on your traditions. We love you. Love, your grandchildren, Rachel, Johnny, Jimmy, and Robbie NELKIN--Myron. A loving husband, father, and grandfather, a visionary real estate developer, a friend and mentor to his employees, a generous supporter of a variety of charitable causes, and an avid golfer in his spare time, Myron Nelkin passed away on Sunday, July 22, at North Shore University Hospital in Manhasset. Born in Brooklyn on January 5, 1925, Mr. Nelkin was a student at Boys High in Brooklyn and graduated from Columbia University with a degree in business in 1946. With his father, Harry L. Nelkin, DDS, he began his working life building homes in Queens and Long Island. He founded three companies, Fairhaven Properties, Nelkin Construction Corp., and Central Management, and built all of Long Island's Fairhaven apartment complexes and the Woodbury Gardens senior residence. What Mr. Nelkin considered his crowning achievement was the rebuilding of The Garden City Hotel on the site of the storied original, where Charles Lindbergh slept in 1927 on the night before his trans-Atlantic flight. The completely new construction opened in 1983 on 21 acres in the heart of Garden City. Lavishly landscaped and decorated, lively and bright, the acclaimed establishment maintains a sense of its place in the history of Long Island, as Mr. Nelkin wished. When in New York, he called the penthouse suite his home. Mr. Nelkin generously supported the Helen Keller Home for the Blind, the North ShoreLong Island Jewish Health System, Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center, Family Services of Nassau County, Christa House, the Hart Foundation for Parkinson's Research, and the Tilles Center, as well as Jewish philanthropies and causes. He is survived by his wife, Barbara (nee Norinsberg); his children, Henry L. Nelkin, Mindy Nelkin, and Cathy Nelkin-Miller and her husband, Charles Miller; his grandchildren, Rachel, John, and James Schwartz and Robert Miller; and his brother and sister-inlaw, William and Trudi Nelkin. A private interment was held at Beth David Cemetery in Elmont. NELKIN--Myron. My darling husband, I miss you already. The children and I are heartbroken. Thank you for providing us with a life full of wonderful, loving memories and for being our hero. Our love for you will live on, and you will live in our hearts and souls forever. Kisses and hugs, Barbara"

Although Palestinians and their descendants who are registered as refugees by the United Nations now number about 4.5 million, only about 700,000 Palestinians -- not ''millions'' -- fled or were forced to flee during the era when the state of Israel was created. Also because of an editing error, the article referred incorrectly to the time frame during which the first Palestinians left their homes. Most left before and during the 1948 war, not afterward."

We are surrounded by everything you accom plished, and your heart and soul will never leave us. You are our superhero, and we know superheroes live forever. Watch down on us, and continue to guide us through life. We love you, Dad. From your children, Henry, Mindy, Cathy and Charlie NELKIN--Myron. Grandpa, we miss you so much. You were the best grandfather in the whole world, and we are blessed for having known you, loved you, and for being loved by you. You taught us the meaning of hard work and integrity. Each of us hopes to be half the person you were and would consider that a wonderful life. To watch you lead others and help those who were in need has inspired us to do great things with our lives. Even though you had to leave us, we will think of you as we confront every decision and know you would be proud. Thank you for being so present in our lives. You were a force of strength, and we will strive to fulfill the expectations you had for us. The family was everything to you. Now its our turn to carry on your traditions. We love you.

Kisses and hugs, Barbara NELKIN--Myron. A loving husband, father, and grandfather, a visionary real estate developer, a friend and mentor to his employees, a generous supporter of a variety of charitable causes, and an avid golfer in his spare time, Myron Nelkin passed away on Sunday, July 22, at North Shore University Hospital in Manhasset. Born in Brooklyn on January 5, 1925, Mr. Nelkin was a student at Boys High in Brooklyn and graduated from Columbia University with a degree in business in 1946. With his father, Harry L. Nelkin, DDS, he began his working life building homes in Queens and Long Island. He founded three companies, Fairhaven Properties, Nelkin Construction Corp., and Central Management, and built all of Long Island's Fairhaven apartment complexes and the Woodbury Gardens senior residence. What Mr. Nelkin considered his crowning achievement was the rebuilding of The Garden City Hotel on the site of the storied original, where Charles Lindbergh slept in 1927 on the night before his trans-Atlantic flight. The completely new construction opened in 1983 on 21 acres in the heart of Garden City. Lavishly landscaped and decorated, lively and bright, the acclaimed establishment maintains a sense of its place in the history of Long Island, as Mr. Nelkin wished. When in New York, he called the penthouse suite his home. Mr. Nelkin generously supported the Helen Keller Home for the Blind, the North ShoreLong Island Jewish Health System, Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center, Family Services of Nassau County, Christa House, the Hart Foundation for Parkinson's Research, and the Tilles Center, as well as Jewish philanthropies and causes. He is survived by his wife, Barbara (nee Norinsberg); his children, Henry L. Nelkin, Mindy Nelkin, and Cathy Nelkin-Miller and her husband, Charles Miller; his grandchildren, Rachel, John, and James Schwartz and Robert Miller; and his brother and sister-inlaw, William and Trudi Nelkin.

2007-07-29T00:00:00Z,"After her much-honored work '' 'A Problem From Hell': America and the Age of Genocide'' appeared in 2002, Samantha Power was widely regarded as an expert on genocide. But as she explains in an e-mail message, she always saw her book as being more about American foreign policy, since ''it showed the U.S. government's systematic and deadly tendency to exclude considerations of human consequences in its decision making.'' Today, along with teaching at Harvard's Kennedy School, she writes for such publications as The New Yorker and The New York Review of Books. She also consulted for the Democratic presidential candidate Barack Obama. Later this year she will become a foreign policy columnist for Time magazine, and she is completing work on a new book, ''Chasing the Flame: Sergio Vieira de Mello and the Fight to Save the World,'' about the United Nations peacemaker killed by a suicide bomb in Iraq. She views his death in August 2003 as a turning point in a war she calls ''the greatest strategic blunder in the history of U.S. foreign policy.'' Like Washington's history of ignoring genocide, Power says, the Iraq war is ''further proof'' of the need to overcome the United States government's ''systemic insensitivity to human consequences.''

2007-07-29T00:00:00Z,"AMERICANS have used the run-up in real estate values in recent years to build financial flexibility for themselves, and many homeowners reasonably believe they can use their home equity for last-minute emergencies. But if they wait until an emergency actually strikes to apply for a home-equity loan, they may be in for a painful shock, financial advisers and mortgage executives say. The very nature of some financial emergencies, like unemployment, may disqualify an applicant from a loan."

That comedy, about a mismatched young couple seeking enlightenment in Rio -- where they meet, among other unlikely characters, a 500-year-old Jewish caveman -- is stuffed in the Williamstown manner with Broadway talent, from the director (Christopher Ashley) and cast (Hunter Foster, Malcolm Gets, Kate Reinders) to the designers.

2007-07-29T00:00:00Z,"von DRAN--Raymond F. Adoring husband and father, esteemed professor and dean emeritus of the Syracuse University School of Information Studies, pioneering leader in the field of information, innovative thinker and academic, beloved friend and mentor, nurturer of and believer in young talent, art and music aficionado, and bearer of a child-like spirit, Raymond F. von Dran passed away Monday, July 23 at New York-Presbyterian Hospital in New York City. He was 60. Born on July 31, 1946, in Elizabeth, New Jersey, Ray grew up a single child, learning from his father the value of an education. He instilled in Ray the love for reading, including his favorite book, Tootle. Ray presented copies of the book to May 2007 graduates of the iSchool at Syracuse as a reminder to lay down their own tracks in life. Throughout his career, Ray broke new ground to help bring library and information science schools into the Information Age. A founding member of the I-Schools Group -a national consortium of academic institutions focused on the relationship between information and people -Ray was among a core group of visionaries who helped define the newly emerging academic field of information studies, examining how information, in all its forms, expands human capabilities. He led the iSchool at Syracuse through a 12-year period of unprecedented productivity (1995-2007), during which the number of faculty and students nearly tripled, sponsored research in creased five-fold, and four of the school's programs earned top-four rankings from U.S. News and World Report, including the top-ranked master's in information systems. All seven of the school's research centers were launched under his leadership, and several academic degree programs were instituted. Ray was also instrumental in increasing the school's endowment, recently helping to secure the largest gift in its 110-year history. Among his most striking legacies at the school is the notion of a ''faculty of one'' that has no traditional departments or divisions between the various degree programs and that encourages faculty to teach across disciplines. This unique culture supports innovative collaboration and a family-like environment for school members to teach and learn from each other. Syracuse often served as a model for other schools to emulate, and Ray advised them on how to establish such a collegial and productive workplace. Prior to joining SU, Ray served as dean of the information schools at The Catholic University of America and the University of North Texas. He received a Ph.D. in information science and master's degrees in library science and French intellectual history from the University of Wisconsin-Madison, and bachelor's degrees in foreign languages and history from Seton Hall University. One of his greatest skills and accomplishments in life was making every person he encountered feel special and like an invaluable contributor to whatever task was at hand. He was unabashedly devoted to his wife and daughter, whom he looked to for support and inspiration. He is survived by wife, Gisela von Dran, of Syracuse, NY, and daughter, Beth von Dran, of Austin, Texas. In lieu of flowers, a fund has been established in Ray's honor. Donations can be directed to the SU Raymond F. von Dran Fund, School of Information Studies, Syracuse University, 343 Hinds Hall, Syracuse, NY 13244. There will be no public calling hours. A memorial service will be held on the Syracuse University campus in September."

On Sunday, July 1, 2007, Gerhard Skrobek, a renowned Master Sculptor of Goebel Hummel Figurines at Roedental, passed away near Coburg, Germany. Mr. Skrobek passed as a result of complications from heart surgery and leukemia. Mr. Skrobek was born in Leobschutz, Upper Silesia, Germany on May 20, 1922 to Gunther and Edith Kornblum Skrobek. Gerhard is survived by his wife Sieglinde, sons Martin and Stephan, and daughters Suzanne and Victoria in Germany as well as his sister Ingeborg Larsen in Northern California. Gerhard became a roving ambassador for the Goebel Hummel Works shortly after erecting a seven foot high ''Merry Wanderer'' in Terrytown, New York in 1972. Following that notable piece of work Gerhard made several tours to the United States, demonstrating his sculpting methods and drawing large crowds of loyal fans throughout the country. In 1976, Gerhard sculpted a bicentennial Bald Eagle for formal presentation to President Ford and Vice President Rockefeller. Gerhard grew up in Berlin during World War II with his parents and sister, Ingeborg. Gerhard's mother, Edith, was of Jewish descent prompting the Gestapo to cause the family great suffering. In 1944 Gerhard's Catholic father, Gunther, was imprisoned for refusing to divorce his Jewish wife. Although Edith made an effort to protect her family from persecution by converting to Catholicism, the Gestapo showed no mercy. Gerhard was forced to work in a bomb factory in Coburg and his sister Ingeborg was forced to work in a parachute factory in Berlin. Fearing for his mother and sister during heavy Berlin bomb raids, Gerhard escaped from Coburg to rescue them. Thanks to Gerhard's heroic efforts, they all boarded one of the last trains out of Berlin prior to the Russians arrival in April 1945. Gerhard is deeply missed by his family and adoring collectors."

The trial is expected to begin by February, not by ''Feb. 30.'' The error occurred when an editor saw the symbol ''-- 30 --'' typed at the bottom of the reporter's article and combined it with the last word, ''February.'' It is actually a notation that journalists have used through the years to denote the end of an article. Although many no longer use it or even know what it means, some journalists continue to debate its origin. A popular theory is that it was a sign-off code developed by telegraph operators. Another tale is that reporters began signing their articles with ''30'' to demand a living wage of $30 per week. Most dictionaries still include the symbol in the definition of thirty, noting that it means ''conclusion'' or ''end of a news story.'' -- 30 --"

Just before Rodriguez batted, Shelley Duncan, replacing Bobby Abreu, hit the eighth home run of the game for the Yankees to give them a 16-3 lead. But Rodriguez flied out to center to make his box score line 0 for 5, all on fly balls. When Rodriguez returned to the dugout, he handed his bat to a young boy in the box seats.

A peace deal five months ago allowed for reunification, and in Bouaké, the rebel capital, he and his prime minister, Guillaume Soro, the former rebel leader, set fire to a symbolic pile of weapons. They were joined by the presidents of five African nations. “The war is over,” Mr. Gbagbo declared. Mr. Soro’s rapprochement with Mr. Gbagbo has not been without its critics. On a visit to Bouaké last month, assailants shot at Mr. Soro’s plane as it tried to land. This time, Mr. Gbagbo arrived in Bouaké by road."
2007-07-31T00:00:00Z,"Deaths from storms and floods across China this summer have reached nearly 700, the state-run news media said. The floods have affected 119 million people, the Xinhua news agency said, with farmers bearing the brunt of the casualties and damage. The Red Cross opened an emergency appeal for aid for those left homeless, and, though summer storms are an annual threat, called the flooding the worst to hit China in a decade. “The frequency and intensity of extreme weather events are increasing,” Dong Wenjie, the director of the state Climate Center, said on its Web site. “Records for worst-in-a-century rainstorms, droughts and heat waves are being broken more often. This, in fact, is closely associated with global warming.” Forecasters said torrential rain was likely to hit parts of the southwestern provinces of Guizhou, Yunnan and Sichuan as well as Hubei in the coming days."

His replacement is likely to be Ali Akbar Hashemi Rafsanjani, left, the more moderate former president who lost the presidential race to Mahmoud Ahmadinejad in 2005. Mr. Rafsanjani is the assembly’s vice chairman, having been chosen in December elections in which Mr. Ahmadinejad’s supporters fared surprisingly poorly. The powers of the directly elected, 86-member clerical board include choosing, monitoring and, if it deems necessary, removing the supreme leader, currently Ayatollah Ali Khamenei. The Mehr News Agency said the assembly would leave the vote to replace Ayatollah Meshkini, who led it for 25 years, until its regular meeting next month."

The announcement, held at the reservoir in Central Park, means that New York can avoid paying an estimated $8 billion to build an enormous plant to filter nearly one billion gallons of water a day from its Catskill Mountain reservoirs. Officials from the federal Environmental Protection Agency said the city would have to continue its land protection efforts in the Catskills and its program to upgrade the sewage treatment plants of watershed communities. New York is still required to filter water from the Croton system by building an underground plant in the Bronx that will cost more than $2 billion and is scheduled to begin operating in 2012."

2007-07-31T00:00:00Z,"The police must have a reasonable suspicion of criminal wrongdoing before asking for permission to search a disabled car, the State Supreme Court ruled yesterday. In a 6-to-1 ruling, the court held that marijuana and cocaine found by a state trooper under the hood of a disabled car in 2004 could not be used as evidence against its occupants. In that case, the trial judge found that the evidence could not be admitted because the trooper was acting on “nothing more than a hunch.” An appeals panel reversed the decision, but a majority of the Supreme Court justices found that there was credible evidence to support the trial judge’s opinion that no reasonable suspicion of a crime existed to justify the search."

The airline canceled 526 flights from Friday through Sunday (out of a total 4,187). Yesterday alone, Northwest canceled 117 flights as of 6 p.m. In a memo to Northwest employees on Friday, the chief executive officer, Douglas M. Steenland, blamed “pilot absenteeism” for the mounting delays. Northwest canceled more than 1,000 flights in the last week of June. Northwest then “thinned the July schedule in anticipation of staffing challenges,” Mr. Steenland told employees. The Northwest branch of the Air Line Pilots Association said in late June that Northwest was unfairly blaming pilots for problems caused primarily by insufficient staff in a system with “no slack.” Northwest crews have been routinely reaching their maximum monthly limits on work hours near the end of a month. The pilots’ union said that cutbacks had left about 400 pilots on furlough. In his memo last week, Mr. Steenland said that “all furloughed pilots wishing to return to Northwest” have been notified of their dates to report for retraining."

2007-08-01T00:00:00Z,"Stick to your old-fashioned roots and the market will eventually wake up. Take the Koeze Company's Cream-Nut peanut butter, for example. It has been made in Grand Rapids, Mich., from dark-roasted Virginia peanuts since 1925. Coarsely ground in small batches and lightly seasoned with sea salt, it is neither creamy nor chunky but totally irresistible. Jeff Koeze (pronounced COO-zee ) runs the company, and is the fourth generation of his family to do so. He uses vintage slow-grinding machines to produce exceptionally nutty-tasting peanut butter, which has been sold nationally for only the past year or so. When freshly made, it is well emulsified into a creamy consistency. The oil eventually floats to the top and has to be stirred back in. This does not affect quality, only convenience."

2007-08-01T00:00:00Z,"BY an awful and uncanny coincidence -- the kind of occurrence that, in a movie, would have to be taken as symbolic lest it seem altogether preposterous -- Michelangelo Antonioni and Ingmar Bergman died on the same day. Since Mr. Bergman was 89 and Mr. Antonioni 94, neither man's death came as much of a shock, but the simultaneity was startling. Not only because they were both great filmmakers, but more because, in their prime, Mr. Antonioni and Mr. Bergman were seen as the twin embodiments of the idea that a filmmaker could be, without qualification or compromise, a great artist. Not that everyone agreed or saw them both in equally glowing light. There will always be those who scoff at the idea of cinema as a form of art. And those who do embrace the notion have always been notoriously prone to quarrel and dissension. In ''Anticipation of 'La Notte,' '' for instance, his touching, self-aware memoir of youthful cinephilia, Philip Lopate recalls being part of an undergraduate claque of film buffs in the early 1960s who worshiped Mr. Antonioni and disdained Mr. Bergman."

Although an explosion in 1950 contributed to the contamination, the area has been used by various petroleum companies for more than 140 years, and the 17 million gallons accumulated gradually over that time -- not all at once after the explosion. (The error also appeared on Nov. 1, 2005; June 23, 2006; and on Feb. 9, July 16 and July 18 of this year.) The article on July 19 also referred incorrectly to an agency, the Department of Environmental Conservation, that reviewed Exxon Mobil's water cleanup operation this year. It is a state agency, not a city one. The articles on July 18 and July 19 referred incompletely to soil tests taken to determine whether the spill has released toxic vapors into the neighborhood. Although previous tests, conducted by the Riverkeeper environmental group, showed the presence of such vapors, the most recent tests in residences in the area, conducted by the state, were negative."

At issue are scientific projections that the ice cap will recede because of global warming, opening the Artic Ocean to offshore oil drilling. Canada and Denmark also claim the Lomonosov Ridge."
2007-08-02T00:00:00Z,"Sixty-nine coal miners trapped underground for more than three days emerged blindfolded, to protect their eyes against the light, and soaked to the skin, but safe. They became trapped Sunday morning when a flash flood from heavy rain surged through an old shaft at their mine in Henan Province. More than 500 colleagues worked around the clock to pump out water and remove mud and rocks blocking the passage between the trapped men and the pit entrance. A ventilation pipe and telephone line survived the accident, and rescuers sent down milk via a hose. China’s coal mining industry is the deadliest in the world, and this was “the most successful rescue effort in major mining accidents in our country in recent years,” the Henan governor, Li Chengyu, told the crowd at the scene through a loudspeaker, “one most worthy of celebration.”."

2007-08-02T00:00:00Z,"Israel began dismantling a low concrete barrier that ran for 25 miles along roads south of Hebron. Israel had claimed that the barrier, though just 32 inches high, was intended to provide additional security for Jewish settlers, but in February 2006 the High Court accepted the contention of the Association for Civil Rights in Israel that the wall violated the rights of Palestinian residents in 21 rural communities and prevented farmers from crossing the roads with their herds of livestock. The court gave Israel six months to remove the barrier. When it failed to do so, the civil rights group sought to have the state held in contempt of court. Last week, the court ordered the wall’s destruction within two weeks."

2007-08-02T00:00:00Z,"The authorities in Turks and Caicos, a British territory in the West Indies, were ill equipped to handle the capsizing of a boat in May in which 61 Haitian migrants died, British maritime investigators said in a report. But they said it could not be determined if the territory’s marine police had caused the boat to capsize. Several survivors had accused a patrol boat of ramming their boat. The investigators concluded that the Haitian sloop, overloaded with at least 150 migrants, was nearing the territory’s coast when the patrol intercepted it and tried to tow it to shore. “It would appear that the sloop capsized while under tow, when the number of passengers on deck reached a critical number and stability was lost,” their report said. “However, the exact trigger for the capsize remains unknown.” It added that neither vessel showed signs of collision damage."

Morgenthau, the Manhattan district attorney. The go-between, who was paid $500 per case, would contact the patients on behalf of Mr. Sheeger&#8217;s law firm, Mr. Morgenthau said.

A review of injury studies in the current issue of The British Journal of Sports Medicine provides some explanation for what causes so many injuries, and it might not be everything you’d expect. Those most likely to be injured, the review found, include people who’ve been injured before; are too obsessive (running for a year or more without a break); or are men taller than 5-foot-6. [what about tall women??] Runners with a relatively high body mass appear to somehow avoid foot injury[is she conflating leg injuries and foot injuries? does the review distinguish?] -- perhaps, the authors speculated, because Clydesdales, in general, run less. Surprisingly, some factors didn’t contribute to injury risk, including having legs of different length, using alcohol, or running after dark [why would running after dark make any difference??]. The one element that was foundto prevent running injuries most consistently was increasing mileage gradually, to a maximum of about 40 miles per week."

2007-08-02T00:00:00Z,"BURNS--Dr. John J., the former Vice President of Research and Development at Hoffmann-La Roche, died on Sunday, July 29, 2007 in Bridgeport, CT. Born in Flushing, NY on October 8, 1920, he was a graduate of Queens College with a BS degree in 1942 and from Columbia University in 1950 with a Ph.D. degree. During World War II, he served in the U.S. Army where he was assigned to a research group developing new anti-malaria drugs. During the fifties, while doing research at the National Institutes of Health in Bethesda, MD, Dr. Burns made an important observation, which explains why scurvy developed in humans on a Vitamin C free diet. He showed humans lack an enzyme in their liver required for making the vitamin, while almost all other animal species have this enzyme and thus do not develop scurvy on a Vitamin C deficient diet. Extensive pharmacological research conducted during his career on the metabolic fate and the mechanism of action of drugs gave a basis for discovering new drugs and improving their therapeutic use. In 1960, Dr. Burns moved to the Wellcome Research Laboratories, Tuckahoe, NY where he was Director of Research. From 1968 to 1984, he was Vice President of Research & Development at Hoffmann-La Roche. After Dr. Burns retired from Roche, he served as Adjunct Professor of Pharmacology at the Weill Medical College of Cornell University. He also was a scientific advisor to a number of new biotech companies. Dr. Burns was a member of the National Academy of Sciences, the Institute of Medicine, served as President of the American Society for Pharmacology and Experimental Therapeutics and as President of International Union of Pharmacology. In 1974, Dr. Burns was a member of the Herbal Pharmacology Delegation to the Peoples Republic of China and in 1973 was a member of the Panel on Chemistry & Health of President Nixon's Scientific Advisory Committee. Dr. Burns was a member of the Steering Committee of the National Academy of Sciences/Institute of Medicine that developed the National Strategy for AIDS. In 1987, he was awarded Honorary Membership in the Japanese Pharmacology Society. In 1987, he received an Honorary Doctor of Science degree from Queens College on the occasion of the Colleges 50th anniversary celebration. Dr. Burns was a resident of Fairfield and Westport since 1973. He had a strong interest in equestrian activities having served as President of the Fairfield County Hunt Club, as President of the Fairfield Bridle Trail Association and as Director of the Equus Foundation, Westport. Dr. Burns was predeceased by his sister, Mary B. Kalnins and his brother, Edward Burns. Friends are invited to attend a Memorial Service on Tuesday, August 7, 2007 at 11:00 a.m. at St. Luke's Church, 49 North Turkey Hill Road, Westport, CT. Interment is private.

2007-08-02T00:00:00Z,"Just in time for corn season there's a new tool for taking kernels off a cob of cooked corn. The Oxo corn stripper ($12), created by Mark Naden, an industrial designer with TODA (the Office of Design and Architecture) in New York, is good news for people who are tired of getting corn stuck between their teeth. The tool removes the corn in strips as it is dragged down the cob, and holds the corn in an integrated collection basket. (Previous attempts to design such a device, Mr. Naden said, resulted in products that created a mess: ''Corn just went everywhere.'') There's also a comfortable grip for safety and control.

Even a locksmith knows that the best a cyclist can do is to buy a strong lock and learn how to use it properly. What constitutes a good lock has changed since September 2004, when it became common knowledge that a cheap pen could open many high-end locks. Redesigned lock cores have almost completely put an end to that. Additional advances in technology include beefier and more sophisticated locks that translate into the strongest units to date. Some have guarantees that provide replacement costs for your bike for as much as $5,000. Still, they're not impenetrable."

2007-08-02T00:00:00Z,"Donald Trump has just introduced a furniture collection at Macy's, and he may be suffering from first-timer anxiety. As he stretched out on a bed at the Herald Square store, he appeared to be concerned that the pictures might make his furnishings look fat. ''Can you keep me in the center?'' he said to the photographer. ''I hate those convex lenses. Do you find they're very distorted? I hate wide angles. They're a disaster for me.'' The collection, now at select Macy's stores, will be in independent stores this month. There are two lines: the sleek Central Park and the more traditional Westchester, both inspired by furniture in Mr. Trump's five homes and his business properties -- although his favorites, like a sofa at Mar-a-Lago, his $42 million Palm Beach estate, were impossible to reproduce. ''Mar-a-Lago is always tough,'' said Mr. Trump, whose hair these days is the color of a wheat field in an old MGM movie, which is to say, a gold that is better than real life. ''The furniture is extraordinarily opulent and large, like the house.''"

According to Nielsen's estimates, this competition of comedians drew 6.8 million viewers and NBC's best numbers since late January for that hour among adults 18 to 49. It was not enough, however, to outpace the last 30 minutes of Fox's ''So You Think You Can Dance,'' which averaged 8.2 million viewers from 8 to 9:30. During the rest of the hour, however, ''Last Comic Standing'' tied Fox's ''Don't Forget the Lyrics'' (7.8 million) in the 18-to-49 demographic. NBC's ''Dateline'' (7.2 million) led in that demographic at 10, ahead of CBS's ''CSI: NY'' repeat (8.2 million). Although a distant third in the 18-to-49 set for the night, CBS finished close behind second-place NBC in total viewers. ABC, despite broadcasts of the ''American Inventor'' finale at 8 (5.3 million) and a new episode of ''The Nine'' at 10 (3.3 million), ranked fourth over all."

On a visit to Faulkner's home in Oxford, Miss., the friend asked Faulkner to copy her sorority pledge. Instead he composed his own pledge, which used imagery and analogy to list character traits that a sorority seeks to develop in its members. The young woman, who couldn't decipher Faulkner's script, never believed it was anything but the pledge she asked for.

From 3 to 7 p.m., the museum plaza will go carnival, as the West Indian-American Day Carnival Association presents stilt walkers and live steel-pan music -- a warm-up for the Charles Moore Dance Theater, which will perform a traditional Caribbean dance at 6. From 6:30 to 8:30 p.m., Brooklyn's own ReggaeLution band will perform, and at 9, D.J. Lumumba (a k a Revolution) will preside over an inclusive Caribbean dance party, from bachata to zouk and back again. If your feet need a rest, check out Marta Moreno Vega's 2003 film about Cuban spiritual traditions, ''When the Spirits Dance Mambo,'' and stick around for a question-and-answer session with the director. Also try your hand at decorating a fabric sash inspired by the collection in the African galleries; or listen to Yasmin Ramirez, an arts fellow at the Center for Puerto Rican Studies, discuss artists in Caribbean neighborhoods in New York.

2007-08-03T00:00:00Z,"'SUMMER SESSIONS' When Jeannie Hopper was taking her first spin on the turntables in the garden of the Cooper-Hewitt National Design Museum a couple of years ago, and a pair of 70-something women sidled over to her D.J. booth, she had a pretty good idea of what was coming. ''I thought they were going to complain about the noise,'' Ms. Hopper said. Turned out that they had a question, not a complaint. ''The music is wonderful,'' Ms. Hopper recalls them saying. ''What do you call it?'' It was that sort of open, inviting reception that persuaded Ms. Hopper to return to Cooper-Hewitt, this year as curator of their weekly Summer Sessions series. The event, led each Friday evening by a different D.J. of her choosing, draws about 700 people to the museum in a three-hour period. And while Ms. Hopper is eager to expose D.J.'s to a museumgoing audience, the museum is equally eager to draw on the loyal audience that turns up to hear a specific D.J., no matter the setting. ''It's an opportunity for us to reach a wider demographic,'' said Laurie Olivieri, a spokeswoman for Cooper-Hewitt. ''They have their own fan base who come up to the museum.'' Last week the music fans, the museum's regulars and people simply drawn in by the consistent thud of the bassline all migrated to the center of the lawn to dance. Even those languishing on blankets or exploring the ''Design for the Other 90%'' exhibition in the garden betrayed their interest with a gentle nod of the head or tap of the foot. They had all become part of the same crowd. (Fridays through Sept. 7, 6 to 9 p.m., Cooper-Hewitt National Design Museum, 2 East 91st Street, Manhattan, 212-849-8400, cooperhewitt.org.

2007-08-03T00:00:00Z,"'THEATER OF CRUELTY' Antonin Artaud (1896-1948) was a Surrealist poet, mystic, drug addict and playwright who is said to have died sitting at the foot of his bed, holding a shoe. Rebellious young writers and artists have long admired him, especially his 1938 manifesto, ''The Theater and Its Double,'' which includes the essay ''The Theater of Cruelty,'' describing performances that try to shock, affect and unsettle the audience as much as they can. At White Box in Chelsea, the curator Raúl Zamudio has gathered a marvelously twisted assortment of artwork by two dozen artists from as many nations, all paying homage to Artaud; some of it will no doubt leave you scratching your head in wonder. Video dominates, including Daniel Joseph Martinez's ''Hollow Men'' (video image, above) and Sislej Xhafa's poignant, chilling close-up of a gun on muddy ground being pelted with rain. Something terrible has happened here. Marcos Lopez shows small but intriguingly staged photographs of autopsies, with the arrangement of the figures mirroring scenes from Western religious iconographic traditions. Teresa Margolles has a sound installation of a real autopsy guaranteed to give you goose bumps, especially when the pathologist pulls out the power tools. Then there is Martin Durazo's vibrant, chaotic installation in a cubbyholelike crevice in which strobe lights, sound, sculpture and psychedelic video projections, among other things, freely intermingle. The show's wider purpose can be hard to grasp, but the setup gives a clear nod to Artaud. (Through Aug. 11, White Box, 525 West 26th Street, Chelsea, 212-714-2347, whiteboxny.org.)

Mr. Wottrich, who is the companion of Katharina Wagner, the daughter of Wolfgang Wagner, the festival's director, received unfavorable reviews for his performance on Sunday, when his voice nearly failed him toward the end of Act II. He will be replaced, at least on Sunday, by the American tenor Robert Dean Smith, a Bayreuth veteran who was to have sung the role of Walther in ''Die Meistersinger von Nürnberg,'' which opened this year's festival and was Ms. Wagner's debut there as a director.

2007-08-03T00:00:00Z,"The Italian government said yesterday that it would withdraw civil claims against the J. Paul Getty Museum in Los Angeles related to 40 ancient artifacts that the Getty has agreed to return. The Italian authorities contend that those antiquities, including an Etruscan duck, right, were unearthed at archaeological sites and smuggled out of the country. Announcing the withdrawal of charges at a news conference in Rome, Italy's culture minister, Francesco Rutelli, called the agreement with the Getty a victory for ''cultural diplomacy.'' Yet Mr. Rutelli and Maurizio Fiorilli, a Culture Ministry lawyer, said the decision on the civil charges would have no direct impact on the criminal case against Marion True, the Getty's former antiquities curator. She has been on trial in Rome since November 2005 on charges of conspiring to traffic in stolen artifacts, but has maintained that she is innocent. After a year of on-and-off negotiations, the Italian government and the Getty announced on Wednesday that they had reached a pact providing for the return of the 40 antiquities. The accord calls for Italy to lend rare archaeological treasures to the Getty, whose antiquities collection is housed in a newly expanded museum villa in Pacific Palisades, Calif."

2007-08-03T00:00:00Z,"CHARLIE HADEN INVITATION SERIES Just over a decade ago, the bassist Charlie Haden played a drummerless New York nightclub engagement with the pianist Kenny Barron. The results were recorded for a sparkling album, ''Night and the City,'' that came on the heels of an exquisite effort with a different pianist: ''Steal Away,'' featuring the venerable Hank Jones. And those two releases, both on Verve, are hardly exceptions in the discography of Mr. Haden, above, who has always found comfort and inspiration in the intimate art of duologue. So when he settles in for a series of piano-bass duets next week at the Blue Note, Mr. Haden will be acknowledging his own history, as well as building a new bridge or two. The run begins on Tuesday with Mr. Barron, who has lately been delving deeply into Brazilian music; expect at least one sumptuous bossa nova. On Wednesday the bench belongs to Ethan Iverson, who has more than once used the blog of his band the Bad Plus -- thebadplus.typepad.com -- for ardent pro-Haden propaganda purposes. (He once appraised Mr. Haden's all-duet album ''The Golden Number,'' released on A&M in 1976 and now out of print, as ''one of the very greatest jazz records.'') Thursday's pianist is the drier-than-vermouth legend Paul Bley, an associate of Mr. Haden's for many years, as well as a direct influence on Mr. Iverson and many others. And finally, next weekend will involve three consecutive nights of the ever-lyrical Brad Mehldau, who shared billing with Mr. Haden and the alto saxophonist Lee Konitz on a scintillating pair of Blue Note albums recorded at the Jazz Bakery in 1996 (just a couple of months before Mr. Haden recorded ''Night and the City'' with Mr. Barron, in fact). Of course it's tempting to toss around other names that could have made the lineup -- Carla Bley and Gonzalo Rubalcaba have recently done fine work with Mr. Haden, and naturally there is Mr. Jones -- but that would be downright churlish. What's there will be plenty: more than enough elevated conversation for anyone to absorb fully, though a few hardy souls may try.

2007-08-03T00:00:00Z,"NEW CROWNED HOPE One of the most interesting cinema projects in recent memory has been the new work that came out of the New Crowned Hope Festival. Organized by Peter Sellars, among others, this 2006 festival was commissioned by the city of Vienna to commemorate the 250th birthday of one of Austria's favorite sons, Mozart. Among the offerings in this wildly, admirably ambitious event was a cycle of six feature-length movies from different points on the globe -- from Thailand to Paraguay -- that would somehow speak to Mozart or at least his admirers. Or, in the impressive words of Simon Field, a curator of the films, ''reflected to varying degrees on, or that continued the spirit of, the Mozartian themes of New Crowned Hope, and which will take these themes in new directions appropriate to our time.'' Whether the six movies say something truly Mozartian remains an open question (at least for me), though there's no doubt that all do say a great deal about their specific worlds and their radically distinct directors: Bahman Ghobadi from Iranian Kurdistan, Mahamat-Saleh Haroun from Chad, Tsai Ming-liang from Taiwan and Malaysia, Garin Nugroho from Indonesia (above, a scene from his film ''Opera Jawa''), Apichatpong Weerasethakul from Thailand and Paz Encina from Paraguay. Some of these films have received limited distribution, including Mr. Weerasethakul's critically beloved ''Syndromes and a Century,'' Mr. Haroun's touching ''Dry Season'' and Mr. Tsai's wonderful return to form, ''I Don't Want to Sleep Alone.'' Each is worth a revisit, while the others are worthy of new exploration. (Through Aug. 29, Brooklyn Academy of Music, 30 Lafayette Avenue, at Ashland Place, Fort Greene, 718-636-4100, bam.org.)

Best known for his work in mathematical biology, particularly the transmission of parasitic diseases, his research spanned the fields of optimization, operations research, mathematical cannibaliza tion, probability, statistics, biostatistics, and mathematical epidemiology. The HirschDantzig algorithm that emerged from his work on the ''fixed charge'' problem is widely recognized in economics and business. The famous ''Hirsch conjecture'' he posed in 1957 has intrigued researchers since and remains an open problem in the general case. In the late 1960s, he began mathematically modeling the transmission dynamics of a parasitic worm that causes the devastating tropical disease schistosomiasis. With I. Nasell, he developed a semi-stochastic model that suggested strategies for control of the disease and which became a foundational concept in mathematical epidemiology. Later models with J.-P. Gabriel and H. Hanisch provided new methods for the study of functional differential equations with delay. His superb teaching style reflected his enthusiasm for his subject and his reverence for mathematics. ''His classes were packed with students bearing witness to his reputation as a wonderfully clear teacher who really cared about his students.'' Appointed professor of mathematics at NYU in 1953, on retirement in 1988, he joined the Biomathematical Sciences faculty at the Mt. Sinai School of Medicine where, for the next 11 years, he taught future research physicians in the M.D./Ph.D. program. As a US Army Air Force major in WWII he attended Statistical Officers School at Harvard, served as Assistant Chief of the combat analysis branch, Headquarters Office of Statistical Control and on the AAF Evaluation Board in Europe analyzing the effects of bombing German targets. He is survived by his wife Gail Glavin Hirsch, his son, Adam Hirsch, his daughter Lisa Eisner, his nephew, Roger, his cousins, Enid, Carol, Burton, and George and his beloved granddaughter, Caitlin. A graveside funeral service will take place at Arlington National Cemetery on Friday, September 7, at 2pm. A memorial luncheon for friends and family will follow the service."

Once I realized that the kind of small-mindedness he describes is not endemic to Judaism per se but to all forms of religious fundamentalism, I felt better. Fundamentalist Jews have more in common with fundamentalist Christians and fundamentalist Muslims than with the vast majority of Jews, Christians and Muslims who are not fundamentalists. The problem is not a Jewish one. It is rather a problem of all religions, which in these difficult times have seen a growing minority of adherents substitute xenophobia for honest faith."

In fairness, he should have noted that conversion to Judaism is an option for couples when one is not Jewish. But is it the official policy of the modern Orthodox community to exclude intermarried couples from photographs? Of course not. In all likelihood, it represents a somewhat zealous approach, probably by a few members of the school's administration, who believe they are protecting the yeshiva's reputation. It would be encouraging if Feldman's former classmates and friends, many of whom remain modern Orthodox but might not endorse deleting him and his wife from the school's publications, protested the policy of shunning a graduate who wishes to remain somehow connected to his roots."

Now, because of the subprime crisis, banks are again turning away borrowers with poor credit, and industry executives expect these borrowers will again turn to so-called ''hard money'' lenders. This time, though, borrowers will have more legal protection against unscrupulous lenders. ''Lenders aren't as interested now in lending to some individuals because they're going to have a harder time repaying,'' said Hugh Bromma, the chief executive of the Entrust Group Inc., a financial advisory company in Reno, Nev., that helps clients lend money on the private market, among other things.

2007-08-05T00:00:00Z,"Michael BESCHLOSS, who not long ago was named the official ''presidential historian'' of NBC News, became interested in American presidents at the age of 8, when his parents took him to visit the Abraham Lincoln house in Springfield, Ill. ''From that moment on,'' he wrote in an e-mail message, ''Lincoln was the man for me.'' Soon after, ''it dawned on me that one could write history books on presidents as a profession.'' Beschloss has gone on to write about Franklin Roosevelt, Harry Truman, Dwight Eisenhower, John Kennedy and Lyndon Johnson. His latest book, ''Presidential Courage,'' recently spent nine weeks on the best-seller list. Asked how George W. Bush fits his idea of presidential courage, Beschloss observed: ''Bush partisans will insist that the president was brave to go to war in Iraq because the outcome of his presidency would depend on whether or not America won. But presidential courage -- as I define it in the book -- is when a president risks his popularity for an important cause for which Americans of the future are grateful. At the moment, it's sadly hard to imagine that future Americans will feel that way about the Iraq war.'' The Editors"

He speaks of Baruch Goldstein at length, ignoring that the overwhelming majority of Orthodox Jews condemned his massacre of Palestinians as morally repugnant. Even Feldman's portrayal of Joe Lieberman seems like a backhanded jab at modern Orthodoxy. After ostensibly glorifying Lieberman's ''overt normalcy,'' why compare his phylacteries to the cilice of Opus Dei? Why encourage people to wonder what kind of backward, medieval man lurks within the senator's suit?"

CLARK--Duncan W., M.D. The SUNY Downstate Medical Center community mourns the passing of Duncan W. Clark, M.D, professor emeritus of preventive medicine and community health. Dr. Clark helped pioneer the concepts and methods of family-based study, predating by four decades the case-based learning widely used at medical schools nationwide. The textbook he coedited, Preventive Medicine, is a classic in medical education. A teacher and mentor of thousands of physicians, he championed public health causes from water fluoridation to the importance of hand-washing in the prevention of disease transmission. A Class of 1936 alumnus of SUNY Downstate when it was known as The Long Island College of Medicine, he later served as dean of the college. In 1950, Dr. Clark was instrumental in merging the campus with the State University of New York, from which he received an honorary Doctor of Science degree in 2000. A past president of the New York Academy of Medicine, the Academy of Medicine of Brooklyn, and the Medical Society of the County of Kings, he served virtually his entire long and distinguished career at Downstate, including 35 years as chair of preventive medicine and community health. We extend our deepest sympathies to his family, colleagues, and friends. John C. LaRosa, MD President Ian L.

Clark, M.D., former Academy President from 1983 to 1984, trustee from 1985 to 1989, and chairman of the Committee on Medicine in Society from 1978 to 1982. Dr. Clark is remembered for his significant contributions to improving community health and for increasing the focus on preventive medicine in medical school education. Dr. Clark led a distinguished career at the SUNY Downstate Medical Center, Brooklyn, that included 28 years as Chairman of the Department of Environmental Medicine and Community Health, where he emphasized the need to understand the social and environmental conditions under which diseases occur. Through extensive public service to dozens of local, state and national health organizations, Dr. Clark was dedicated to improving the health of all of the public. Dr. Clarks wisdom and drive made him an influential figure to generations of medical and public health students, residents and fellows. Dr. Clark will continue to be honored annually at the Academy with an endowed lecture in his name, as since 1986. The Academy Board, Fellows and staff extend the deepest condolences to his family.

Situated midway between Bozeman and Yellowstone National Park in southern Montana, Big Sky Resort is best known for its uncrowded downhill ski facilities that were developed in part by native Montanan and legendary newsman Chet Huntley in the early 1970s. Perhaps the region’s biggest boost came via the 1992 film, “A River Runs Through It,” which featured a section of the Gallatin River near Big Sky. Fifteen years after its “I have to go there” moment, Big Sky is busting out again, this time as a golf destination. Among the new real estate communities are Yellowstone Club and the more accessible Spanish Peaks, which opened its private Tom Weiskopf-designed golf course on Aug. 3. With its mountain vistas and 7,000-foot elevation, this is breathtaking golf, indeed. Public players tee it up at Big Sky Golf Course, a flattish, if scenic early Arnold Palmer layout.

University president Daniel Mark Fogel, the university community, and the Carolyn and Leonard Miller Center for Holocaust Studies at the University of Vermont would like to express their condolences to his wife Gwendolyn and his family, and their gratitude to this exemplary and pioneering scholar for his many years of service to the university. Professor Hilberg joined the faculty of the University of Vermont's department of political science in 1956, where he served for 35 years. Professor Hilberg took on a variety of administrative duties at the university, serving as chair of the political science department and chair of a presidential search committee, among other appointments. Professor Hilberg devoted his entire scholarly life to studying the Holocaust. In 1961 the first edition of his landmark work The Destruction of the European Jews was published. Regarded as the definitive study of the Holocaust, the book was described by the London Times Literary Supplement as ''one of the great historical works of our time.'' A revised version was published in 1985, and the Yale University Press published a third edition in 2003. It has been published in every major language. At the time of his retirement in 1991, the University of Vermont organized an international conference, ''The Hilberg Symposium: Perpetrators, Victims, and Bystanders.'' Presentations were delivered by Yehuda Bauer, Christopher Browning, Claude Lanzmann, Alvin Rosenfeld, Richard Rubenstein, George Steiner, and Herman Wouk. The proceedings were published as a collection of essays in honor of Professor Hilberg titled Perspectives on the Holocaust. That same year, the University of Vermont established a Center for Holocaust Studies, recently renamed the Carolyn and Leonard Miller Center for Holocaust Studies. Each year, the center honors Professor Hilberg with the annual Hilberg Lecture, attracting prominent Holocaust scholars from around the world. To further commemorate him, the center published a Festschrift for Raul Hilberg on His SeventyFifth Birthday in 2001. Professor Hilberg was and remains our constant companion and inspiration in our efforts to further the knowledge of the Shoah in the classroom, the community, and the world."

2007-08-10T00:00:00Z,"Incensed Muslims assaulted Taslima Nasreen, above left, the exiled Bangladeshi author and feminist, at a publication party at the press club in Hyderabad, India, yesterday, Reuters reported. Lawmakers and members of the All India Majlis-e-Ittehadul Muslimeen party, outraged by her criticisms of Islam and religion in general for oppression of women, threatened Ms. Nasreen with a chair and hurled a leather case, bunches of flowers and other objects at her while some shouted for her death. With her forehead bruised, she described the attack as barbaric before the police moved her to safety. In 1994 thousands of radical Muslims demanded Ms. Nasreen’s death for blasphemy, and she fled into exile after a court declared that she had “deliberately and maliciously” injured the religious feelings of Muslims with her Bengali-language novel “Lajja,” or “Shame,” about riots between Muslims and Hindus. The European Parliament awarded her the Sakharov Prize for freedom of thought in 1994."

Geltzer, the court-appointed trustee for Mr. Giacchetto’s bankrupt company, Cassandra Group, unearthed a book deal in which Mr. Giacchetto was to split the proceeds with Emily White, his biographer. Mr. Geltzer sued, and in a settlement to be filed with bankruptcy court today, Mr. Giacchetto, 44, has turned over his stake in her book, “You Will Make Money in Your Sleep: The Story of Dana Giacchetto, Financial Adviser to the Stars,” and the rights to his life story in any film or television production to satisfy claims against Cassandra Group.

Bush’s — through interviews with former presidents and first ladies whom he served as a confidant, offering counsel on everything, from war to the existence of heaven. In a round-table discussion, from left above, Bill Clinton; Mr. Graham; Charles Gibson, the moderator; Jimmy Carter; and George H. W. Bush reflect on their friendships. Nancy Reagan, Barbara Bush and Hillary Rodham Clinton, who sought advice during the Monica Lewinsky scandal, also discuss their relationships with Mr. Graham, now 88. “I thought of them as just wonderful human beings who were wonderful personal friends as I knew them, each one,” he tells Mr. Gibson. “Pastor to Power” coincides with the publication of “The Preacher and the Presidents” by Nancy Gibbs and Michael Duffy of Time magazine."

Most composers commonly called Minimalists have disavowed the label at one point or another, suggesting that it mischaracterizes their music, which can be mind-bogglingly intricate -- and huge. And they certainly don't consider themselves part of a school. The designation arose mainly from the friendships of composers with Minimalist artists: Steve Reich and Philip Glass, for example, with the sculptor Richard Serra."

Plenty has changed in 11 years at the Nederlander Theater, too. ''Rent'' will surpass 4,700 performances this week, and 14 Rogers and 6 Marks (and scores of understudies) have come along since those roles were originated by Adam Pascal, above right, and Anthony Rapp, above left, who left the show within months of each other in late 1997 and early 1998.

2007-08-10T00:00:00Z,"HANSEN--William Prehn Jr. , of Chester, CT, died August 6, 2007. He was 68. Mr. Hansen was a municipal bond market pioneer who loyally served his firm, JPMorgan Chase, for over 44 years. He was instrumental in groundbreaking transactions that helped keep the State of California solvent during fiscal crises in the early 1980s, in 1994, and in 2001. Mr. Hansen began his career at Morgan Guaranty Trust in February 1963. After moving up the ranks in the bank's corporate side of the business and after being promoted to Vice President in 1974, he joined the firm's fledgling municipal credit group in 1977. There he was instrumental in establishing both the first variable-rate demand bonds via a put agreement and the first conditional liquidity facility for a tax-exempt bond that was not an irrevocable letter of credit (known today as the standby bond purchase agreement). He was named Executive Director in 2007, and retired in July 2007. Mr. Hansen took tremendous pride in working on financial transactions that supported the public sector. Mr. Hansen was born on March 6, 1939, in Port Chester, NY, to William Prehn Hansen and Jane Barbour Hansen. Nicknamed ''Wink'', he grew up in Greenwich, CT attending The Greenwich Country Day School, where his mother taught kindergarten. He graduated from The Choate School in 1957, and from Dartmouth College in 1961. He was a member of the Sigma Chi fraternity. Mr. Hansen found peace and happiness relaxing at his 19th century farmhouse in Chester, CT. He called his home Six Brothers Farm, a tribute to his six sons. He is survived by Nancy Cliggott Hansen, and by his six boys: Matthew, his wife Rasha and their children Leith and Lara; Geoffrey, his wife Linda and their daughter Skylar; Michael, his wife Jennifer and their son Nathan; William III and his wife Shannon; Richard; and Joseph.

2007-08-10T00:00:00Z,"TRISHA BROWN DANCE COMPANY In its effort to relive the Summer of Love, Lincoln Center Out of Doors has gathered a host of performers who made their marks in the 1960s. One is Trisha Brown, who, as a member of the performance nexus surrounding the Judson Memorial Church in Greenwich Village, fundamentally expanded and subverted our definitions of dance. Despite the wondrous sensuality of her movement, the rigor of Ms. Brown's choreographic sensibility hardly brings to mind the Swinging Sixties. Not to mention the fact that she has said that it took her years to free herself of the rigid new dictates that so often accompany revolutionary movements in order to create the kinds of dances she wanted to create rather than those that were expected of a Judson alumna. Some people have never forgiven her forays into opera: it's not easy being categorized as a ''postmodern dance icon.'' But never mind the adjectives (especially in dance, which can't seem to agree on its historical labels). Ms. Brown's essential artistic core remains as curious and restless as ever, and this free performance offers several decades' worth of proof, from ''Accumulation'' (1971) to ''Present Tense,'' left, created in 2003.

The Board of Governors, Trustees, staff and members of Boys & Girls Clubs of America wish to express their profound sorrow over the passing of Mr. Jeremiah Milbank, our former Chairman, Life Member of our National Board of Governors, friend, advocate and a true champion for children. Mr. Milbank's half-century of involvement with Boys & Girls Clubs of America began with his father, Jeremiah Sr., a longtime leader of our cause, and President Herbert Hoover, who recruited a young Jerry Milbank to our national board. During Mr. Milbank's tenure as chairman, BGCA became one of the first youth organizations to serve children in public housing. Today we have more than 400 Clubs in these communities thanks to Mr. Milbank, a man of humility and humanity. Under his guidance we greatly expanded the size and scope of Club services and changed our name to reflect service to young women. In his honor, we established the Jeremiah Milbank Gold Medallion to recognize excellence among Boys & Girls Club volunteers. We will miss him greatly, but Mr. Milbank's positive influence will be felt for years to come. His legacy lives on through his sons Jeremiah III and Joseph, who continue a Milbank family tradition of service to Boys & Girls Clubs of America that spans three generations. Boys & Girls Clubs of America Rick Goings, Chairman Roxanne Spillett, President MILBANK--Jeremiah Jr. The Boards of Directors and staff of The JM Foundation and Milbank Foundation for Rehabilitation are deeply saddened by the loss of Jeremiah ''Jerry'' Milbank, Jr., formerly of Greenwich, CT, and more recently a resident of Charlottesville, VA, who died Tuesday, August 7, 2007. One of our nation's great civic leaders and philanthropists, he was beloved by family and friends and universally respected among colleagues in business and philanthropy. Voluntary service and a strong belief in limited government were guiding principles of Jerry's life. For over 35 years, he led The JM Foundation as President and President Emeritus and was a Founding Director of the Milbank Foundation for Rehabilitation. Among his other leadership roles were: Trustee, President, and Chairman of Boys & Girls Clubs of America; President of ICD-International Center for the Disabled; Chairman of Boy & Girls Clubs of Greenwich; and Trustee of the Hoover Institution on War, Revolution and Peace; the Herbert Hoover Foundation; the Ronald Reagan Presidential Foundation; the Advisory Committee on Presidential Libraries; the National Forum Foundation; Taft Institute for Government; the Dole Foundation for Employment of People with Disabilities; the National Council on Disability; Round Hill Community Church; and dozens of other local and national organizations. Jerry's kindness and generosity helped millions of Americans. His philanthropic spirit enabled him to serve many charitable organizations with great distinction, earning numerous awards and honors, such as President Ronald Reagan's Volunteer Action Award, the Herbert Hoover Humanitarian Award from Boys & Girls Clubs of America, the National Society of Fund Raising Executives Philanthropist of the Year Award, Rutgers University National Distinguished Service Award, the Harold Russell Award from the President's Committee on Employment of People with Disabilities, Kessler Institute's Human Dignity Award, the National Rehabilitation Institute Advocacy Award, the National Leadership Award of the Alcohol and Drug Problems Association of North America, the National Commission Against Drunk Driving Chairman's Award, the R. Brinkley Smithers Award of the National Council on Alcoholism and Drug Dependence, and the Womens National Republican Award. Jerry Milbank graduated from Yale in 1942, served in the U.S. Navy in the Pacific during World War II, and earned his M.B.A. from Harvard after the war. In 1948, he began working in private finance and investments with his father. He served on a number of corporate Boards, including the Chase Manhattan Bank. He was awarded Honorary Doctorate Degrees by Sacred Heart University, Ithaca College, and Manhattan College. A lifelong Republican, he served as Chairman of the Republican National Finance Committee and founded the Republican Eagles. He is survived by the four children from his 35-year marriage to the late Andrea Hunter Milbank: Jeremiah Milbank III, Victoria Milbank Whitney, Elizabeth Milbank Archer, and Joseph Hunter Milbank, as well as ten grandchildren. He is also survived by his wife, Mary Rockefeller Milbank. We mourn Mr. Milbank's passing and pledge ourselves to the ideals he championed throughout his life.

One hundred and fifty years after his birth, Elgar, above, the English composer primarily known for works like his ''Pomp and Circumstance'' marches, ''Enigma'' Variations and haunting Cello Concerto, is being thoroughly revisited. One of the most in-depth explorations on either side of the Atlantic begins tonight at the Bard Music Festival, where three weekends will be devoted to ''Elgar and His World.'' There is nowhere better than the Bard Festival, which makes a practice of offering intense lineups of performances, pre-concert talks, panels and lectures, to re-examine misunderstood composers. Leon Botstein, the American Symphony Orchestra and a host of other musicians and scholars will play and discuss music by Elgar and a wide array of his predecessors and contemporaries, performing his well-known works as well as less frequently heard ones like the Symphony No. 2. The festival opens tonight with a program called ''Elgar: From Autodidact to 'Master of the King's Musick.' '' Tomorrow, performers including the Daedalus Quartet, the baritone Thomas Meglioranza and the pianist Simone Dinnerstein participate in ''Music in the Era of Queen Victoria,'' playing works by Johann Baptist Cramer, William Sterndale Bennett and Elgar. Later that day Mr. Botstein will lead the American Symphony in Elgar's ''Enigma'' Variations and his Funeral March from ''Grania and Diarmid,'' and Hubert Parry's Symphonic Variations. The opening weekend wraps up on Sunday afternoon with works for brass and strings by Elgar, Richard Strauss, Vaughan Williams and John Ireland.

And we have one word to describe the hall: Crickets. Many empty seats. No rap on Mr. Thompson; the crowd has been diminishing since Mitt Romney spoke a few hours ago. Part of it due to the diversions outside - bands, rides and lots of food - all arguably more interesting than a speech by someone who probably will not get to be president one day."
2007-08-11T16:24:49Z,"AMES, Iowa -- The Iowa Straw Poll was where President Bush took his first big step toward winning his party's nomination. He poured money and resources here in 1999, drawing 31 percent of the vote, way ahead of Steve Forbes, the billionaire, who drew 20 percent of the vote."

Fifty-three percent of teenagers were working in 2000; a decade earlier, 60 percent were, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics. Experts see many explanations for this decline. For example, immigrants are taking many jobs, like mowing lawns, once held by teenagers. More Americans over age 60 are staying in the work force in part-time jobs. The nation has lost three million manufacturing jobs since 2000. Meanwhile, many students take summer courses. In light of these numbers and explanations, what is your take on teenagers and summer work? Go to Article"

The court said Ohio had 90 days to give Mr. Richey a new trial or his freedom.

2007-08-11T00:00:00Z,"F.D.A. REJECTS WYETH DRUG Wyeth's new schizophrenia drug was rejected by the Food and Drug Administration because it was not shown to be effective. Shares of Wyeth and its partner, Solvay of Belgium, dropped. Wyeth said the F.D.A. needed more data showing that the medicine, bifeprunox, works before the agency would consider approval. The F.D.A. also requested information on a patient who died while taking the drug. The drug does not cause weight gain, a safety concern with other schizophrenia remedies, but studies have also shown it is less effective than Zyprexa from Eli Lilly and Risperdal from Johnson & Johnson. ''Bifeprunox didn't work as well as Risperdal and Zyprexa in studies, and I can't see much reason to use this drug once generics of the others are available,'' said Michael Krensavage, an analyst with Raymond James in New York. Cheaper copies of Risperdal will be available next year, followed by generic Zyprexa in 2011. Shares of Wyeth, based in Madison, N.J., dropped $2.99, closing at $46.59. (BLOOMBERG NEWS)"

He is not the Refco bankruptcy trustee, as the headline said, nor is he the trustee of the company, as the first paragraph said. The article and the column should have pointed out that the Thomas H.

(TLC) DIANA: LAST DAYS OF A PRINCESS Ten years after the death of Diana, Princess of Wales, this docudrama recreates the 12 weeks leading up to the car crash in a Paris tunnel that killed her and her companion, Dodi al-Fayed. Genevieve O’Reilly and Patrick Baladi, above, portray the couple in a work based on interviews with their close associates.

That means our sun, and the reflected light of its planets, are currently emitting light into the future, which means we do exist forever. Perhaps time and space are heaven.

He entered the business world via the renowned Czech glass industry, and emigrated to England following the Second World War, where he met and married his beloved wife of 60 years, Estelle Green Sark.

Son of Joseph and Anna, respected and loving teacher, counselor and philosopher to those interested in living the Perennial Philosophy, died peacefully on August 5th, 2007 at home in San Francisco, California in the arms of his beloved Helene. Vic's lifelong exploration of Plato's insight into ''time as the moving image of Eternity'', his dedication to human transformation, his daily engagement with God, and his deep drive to integrate the three stood him in good stead for his twomonth long battle with an aggressive cancer. In his dying, as well as in his living, Vic updated Plato with a more Neapolitan flavor into a motto by which he lived: Practice dying and dance as often as you can! And dance and improvise with life he could and did do. Those of us who were touched by Vic's teaching, and he was always teaching, will likely not have his death end the dialogue with life that he fostered in his students. The tribute we are quite sure he would ask of us is to be more loving to those in our care, as well as to be more courageous with our gifts.

She spent the last few weeks of her life surrounded by friends and family in her own home. The cause was cancer, she was 77. Marilynn achieved much during her lifetime, including authoring books on various areas of health policy; teaching students at the University of Michigan; leading students on international health policy courses in England, Sweden and China; founding and editing a co-op nursery journal; and, most recently, initiating a rain barrel project in Ann Arbor. Marilynn earned her Ph.D. after raising her three children, writing her dissertation about rumor-control during the Detroit race riots in 1967. In short order, Marilynn won a Hopwood writing award and several years ago won a Fullbright Scholarship to study medical safety in England and Sweden. After ''retiring'' from teaching at the U of M Dearborn Campus, she continued lecturing at the U of M Medical School, teaching premedical and medical students about the importance of patient safety. She founded the Michigan Health Policy Forum, an ongoing seminar series for faculty and scholars focusing on Health Care Finance, Quality and Access to Care. According to her granddaughter, she ''...was not your typical grandmother. We made menorahs out of oranges, rode bikes together, and she lectured to us about history, current events and why we should drive hybrid cars. She had so many fun and interesting ideas for art projects.'' The family will be sitting shiva on Thursday and Friday, August 16 and 17 from 5-7:30pm. A celebration of her life will be held at the Michigan League in Ann Arbor on Sunday, August 19 at 9:30am. Services made by the Muehlig Funeral Chapel, Ann Arbor, MI."

Concentrating on themes like birth, childhood, intimacy and self-identity, ''All the More Real'' explores a range of responses to these experiences, from strong emotions to detachment. ''By creating images and objects that appear to be even more real than the actual thing they represent,'' the museum says, ''these artists reassert the ability of representational objects to convey authenticity, pathos and, in many cases, wonder and awe.'' Artists in the exhibition include Vito Acconci, Diane Arbus, Ross Bleckner and Louise Bourgeois. Through Oct. 14, Job's Lane, Southampton, N.Y., (631) 283-2118, parrishart.org."

2007-08-12T00:00:00Z,"There are no easy answers to how the law should make workplaces more family-friendly (Eyal Press, July 29). Paradoxically, accommodating parents could cause hiring discrimination against women. Accommodations can make parents more expensive to employ. This gives employers an incentive to avoid employees who might use them. Since mothers are more likely than fathers to request such accommodations, employers may seek to avoid hiring potential mothers. Such discrimination is prohibited by Title VII. But lawsuits challenging hiring discrimination are relatively rare. A disappointed applicant often does not know why she was passed over or who was hired in her place; therefore, she cannot easily allege discrimination. And, unlike in a firing case, a job applicant generally does not have a strong investment in the particular position; hence she is less likely to go through the cumbersome process of bringing suit. Thus, as a practical matter, employers often can get away with hiring discrimination."

It is this suffusion of heat and radiance that chiefly, to the untechnical, distinguishes it from the other great Gothic interiors. In all the rest, color, if it exists at all, burns in scattered unquiet patches, between wastes of shadowy grey stone and the wan pallor of later painted glass; but at Chartres those quivering waves of unearthly red and blue flow into and repeat each other in rivers of light, from their source in the great western rose, down the length of the vast aisles and clerestory, till they are gathered up at last into the mystical heart of the apse.''

Murray's courage in dedicating herself in the 1970s to the then-unfashionable pursuit of painting, and her ingenious exploration of the medium over the course of more than three decades resulted in a body of work that never ceased to surprise and enlighten. We will remember Murray not only for the beauty, humor, and wisdom of her work, but also as an enormously generous friend, mentor, and colleague of inspiring warmth and vitality whose courage in fighting cancer was an inspiration for all of us.

2007-08-14T00:00:00Z,"ASTOR--Brooke Russell (Mrs. Vincent) . The Trustees and staff of The New York Public Library deeply mourn the passing of our beloved Trustee and Honorary Chairman, Brooke Russell Astor. No one in the modern history of the Library played a more pivotal role in promoting, and supporting, the welfare of the Library than Brooke Astor. As an engaged Trustee of the Library for nearly five decades, Mrs. Astor understood clearly how vital the Library is to the people of our City. She worked with passion, generosity, and immense style to strengthen the Library on every level. Her many substantial benefactions, made through the Vincent Astor Foundation, supported collections, programs, staff, and facilities throughout the Library system. They also inspired, directly and indirectly, the supremely generous gifts that many individuals made to the Library in her honor or made as a consequence of the example she set. Mrs. Astor's love of the Library stemmed in large part from her own passion for both reading and writing. An accomplished writer herself of memoirs, novels, and poetry she believed that all New Yorkers, regardless of circumstance, should have access to the Library and experience the enlightenment and pleasure to be found in reading. Mrs. Astor therefore enriched the lives of countless fellow citizens through her support of the Library's work. Brooke Astor was our patroness and our symbol. She transformed the Library in lasting ways, increasing its quality, its prestige, and its centrality in the life of our City. She was a great philanthropist, a great leader, and the best and most beloved of friends. We extend our condolences to all members of her family. Catherine C. Marron, Chairman Samuel C. Butler, Elizabeth Rohatyn & Marshall Rose, Chairmen Emeriti Paul LeClerc, President ASTOR--Brooke Russell. The Trustees and staff mourn with deep sadness the passing of Brooke Astor, who was a beloved Trustee and generous donor to The Metropolitan Museum of Art for more than 40 years, both personally and through the Vincent Astor Foundation. Her philanthropic touch was administered with wisdom, generosity, and great human warmth, and her versatility and degree of involvement easily qualified her as one of the most generous benefactors in the Museum's history. But she was so much more than that. Brooke understood the special mission of the Museum and was always eager to find creative ways to support its changing needs. Her generosity helped launch The Michael C. Rockefeller Wing, and The Temple of Dendur in The Sackler Wing came to the Metropolitan in part through her efforts. Her interest in China, going back to her childhood, was fundamental to the Museum's determination to become a major center for Asian art, and caused her to become the guiding force behind the creation of the Astor Court, the spiritual heart of the Museum's Asian galleries. Her support also led to extraordinary acquisitions - even after her 100th birthday-and she helped present many important exhibitions, including the 1986 showing of the treasures of the Princes of Liechtenstein. As Co-Chairman of the Chairman's Council with Annette de la Renta, and as Co-Chairman of the Visiting Committee of the Department of Asian Art, she inspired many others to become involved with the Metropolitan. And as a caring Trustee and friend, she endowed an annual holiday party for the Museum's staff and volunteers, personally greeting employees until the age of 101. Wherever there was a need, she stepped forward, often selflessly refusing to be acknowledged for her generosity. She engendered goodwill in all who came in contact with her, and was regarded with respect and affection by every member of the staff. There is a Chinese saying: ''A thousand people drink from a well dug by one man.'' Brooke dug such a well at the Metropolitan Museum, with her benefactions large and small. We treasure the time this great New Yorker spent with us, and the public will long benefit from a spirit of generosity that was remarkable beyond measure. James R. Houghton, Chrman Philippe de Montebello, Dir Emily K. Rafferty, President"

In addition to testing the patience of the electorate, such an event could open a loophole in the 1974 campaign finance laws, potentially allowing for a flood of new donations to the campaigns. The laws cap an individual's contributions to a presidential candidate at $2,300 for the primaries and $2,300 for the general election. But a technicality would allow a third $2,300 contribution for use in nominating contests held before the calendar year of the election, a possibility this year as states move up their nominating contests earlier in 2008."

2007-08-15T00:00:00Z,"ASTOR--Brooke Russell (Mrs. Vincent). The Trustees and staff of The New York Public Library deeply mourn the passing of our beloved Trustee and Honorary Chairman, Brooke Russell Astor. No one in the modern history of the Library played a more pivotal role in promoting, and supporting, the welfare of the Library than Brooke Astor. As an engaged Trustee of the Library for nearly five decades, Mrs. Astor understood clearly how vital the Library is to the people of our City. She worked with passion, generosity, and immense style to strengthen the Library on every level. Her many substantial benefactions, made through the Vincent Astor Foundation, supported collections, programs, staff, and facilities throughout the Library system. They also inspired, directly and indirectly, the supremely generous gifts that many individuals made to the Library in her honor or made as a consequence of the example she set. Mrs. Astor's love of the Library stemmed in large part from her own passion for both reading and writing. An accomplished writer herself of memoirs, novels, and poetry she believed that all New Yorkers, regardless of circumstance, should have access to the Library and experience the enlightenment and pleasure to be found in reading. Mrs. Astor therefore enriched the lives of countless fellow citizens through her support of the Library's work. Brooke Astor was our patroness and our symbol. She transformed the Library in lasting ways, increasing its quality, its prestige, and its centrality in the life of our City. She was a great philanthropist, a great leader, and the best and most beloved of friends. We extend our condolences to all members of her family. Catherine C. Marron, Chairman Samuel C. Butler, Elizabeth Rohatyn & Marshall Rose, Chairmen Emeriti Paul LeClerc, President ASTOR--Brooke. The NYU community deeply mourns the loss of our long-time friend and life trustee, Mrs. Brooke Astor. Mrs. Astor has left an indelible mark not only on the University but on the entire city, where her grace, charm, and generous philanthropy made her a legendary and beloved figure. In 1965, Mrs. Astor and Mrs. Albert D. Lasker became the first women to serve as NYU trustees. Mrs. Astor was appointed a life trustee in 1993. Additionally, she served as a trustee of NYU's Institute of Fine Arts from 1970 to 1974. Mrs. Astor was awarded the Albert Gallatin medal in 1972 in recognition of her outstanding contribution to society, and received an honorary doctorate of letters from NYU in 1986. NYU is grateful for her generous gifts, both personally and through the Astor Foundation, to the libraries and the Steinhardt School of Culture, Education, and Human Development. On behalf of the entire NYU community, we extend our condolences to Mrs. Astor's family, friends and loved ones; our thoughts are with them during this sad time. Martin Lipton, Chair NYU Board of Trustees John Sexton, President, NYU ASTOR--Brooke. The New York Regional Association of Grantmakers community mourns the loss of our beloved friend and esteemed partner in grantmaking Brooke Astor, a philanthropic icon without equal. Her dedication to the city of New York inspired us all. With our deepest sympathies to her family and to all who have been touched by her generosity and spirit. Tamara Kreinin Interim Executive Director, NYRAG Vincent Stehle Chair, NYRAG ASTOR--Brooke. The Board and Staff of The New York Botanical Garden are deeply saddened by the loss of our friend and Distinguished Counsellor to the Board Brooke Astor. Mrs. Astor's philanthropy here focused on the education of New York City children, as she believed all children should learn about nature. As will so many New Yorker's, we will long remember this remarkable woman. Our sincere condolences to her son Anthony Marshall and her family. Wilson Nolen, Chairman of the Board Gregory Long, President ASTOR--Brooke. The Overseers, Trustees, Physicians, Faculty and Staff of Weill Cornell Medical College and NewYork-Presbyterian Hospital are deeply saddened by the passing of our dear friend Brooke Astor. Mrs. Astor was a founding member of the Board of Overseers of Weill Cornell Medical College and was named its first Life Overseer in 1983. A spirited advocate for the health and wellbeing of all throughout her extraordinary lifetime of service and philanthropy, she generously supported the Hospital's commitment to providing the highest quality patient care, and the Medical College's education and research mission, establishing the Vincent Astor Fund for Medical and Graduate Student Scholarships and funding construction of the Dr. Connie Guion Building for outpatient care. She endowed professorships in medicine and neuroscience and was a founding chairman of the Medical Center's ''Cabaret!'' gala fundraiser. She also enjoyed singing Christmas carols with the Medical College student chorus. Mrs. Astor leaves an outstanding legacy of stewardship and benevolence. We are honored to have enjoyed both her friendship and wise guidance over many years, and we join with all those who knew her in mourning her loss. Our deepest condolences are extended to Mrs. Astor's family and friends. Sanford I. Weill Chairman Board of Overseers Antonio M. Gotto Jr., M.D. Dean Weill Cornell Medical College John Mack Chairman Board of Trustees Herbert Pardes, M.D. President & CEO NY-Presbyterian Hospital ASTOR--Brooke. The trustees, staff and volunteers of the Educational Broadcasting Corporation (EBC), licensee of Thirteen/WNET and WLIW New York, mourn the passing of Brooke Astor, a woman who stood for all that is sublime and uplifting in our lives. Everywhere we turn in this great city, we see her generous touch. The institutions that speak to the heights of our human potential were endlessly dear to her, and for that, all who dwell in this vibrant metropolis are eternally grateful to her. We are deeply honored that she counted Thirteen/ WNET among the cultural and educational pillars that edify our society. Mrs. Astor, who served as an EBC Trustee from 1976 to 1981, once told us ''Thirteen is a vast educational institution. But instead of visiting a great edifice, you need only turn your television dial to discover its wonders. Every day, Thirteen fulfills the promise that I supported . . . when the station first began.'' That support was indeed beneficent. She created The Astor Endowment for Literacy, (which most recently helped fund the unprecedented series, ''Novel Reflections on the American Dream'') and the George Page Science Endowment for Science and Nature Programming. She also provided major support for ''Charlie Rose'' and essential unrestricted support to help keep EBC strong and vital. Through her visionary commitment to Thirteen/WNET and public television, Mrs. Astor has left a lasting legacy that will continue to benefit public television viewers throughout our region and across our nation, today and for many years to come. We extend our most profound sympathies to Mrs. Astor's family, including her son Anthony, who is a Life Trustee of EBC, and her grandsons, Philip and Alec. And we join all of New York in remembering and celebrating the life of a living landmark, a great humanitarian, and a wonderful woman. James S. Tisch, Chairman William F. Baker, Chief Executive Neal Shapiro, President ASTOR--Brooke Russell. The staff and fellows of the Dorothy and Lewis B. Cullman Center for Scholars and Writers of The New York Public Library wish to express their great sorrow at the death of Brooke Russell Astor. The Center for Scholars and Writers was created by a generous benefaction from Dorothy and Lewis Cullman in 1999 specifically in honor of Mrs. Astor as a writer. The Cullmans had the deepest respect for and admiration of Mrs. Astor not only as a philanthropist but also as a writer of memoirs, fiction, and poetry. The 15 writers and scholars who are invited to the Center each year therefore work in an environment that reflects one of Mrs. Astor's central values: that writing good books is a key element in our culture. We are all deeply indebted to her for having inspired this Center. Jean Strouse, Sue Ann andJohn Weinberg Director of the Dorothy & Lewis B. Cullman Center for Scholars & Writers The New York Public Library ASTOR--Brooke. The staff and Trustees of Historic Hudson Valley remember with joy the varied gifts of Brooke Astor, a Trustee from 1975 to 2000 and there after Trustee Emerita, and 1996 recipient of the John D. Rockefeller, Jr. Founder's Award. She graced our board meetings and our historic sites near to Holly Hill, her Westchester home. Waddell Stillman, President Michael Hegarty, Chairman ASTOR--Brooke. The Juilliard School mourns the passing of Mrs. Vincent Astor, a luminous benefactor to all of New York City and a special friend to Juilliard. Through the Vincent Astor Foundation, she supported important educational outreach programs at the School for the past two decades. We send our condolences to her son, Anthony and his wife Charlene, and all of her family. She will be deeply missed by us all. Bruce Kovner, Chairman of the Board of Trustees Joseph W. Polisi, President ASTOR--Brooke Russell. The Board and Staff of The New York Landmarks Conservancy salute the legacy of Brooke Russell Astor. Her support was instrumental in our efforts to prevent the demolition of the early 19th century Fraunces Tavern Block in Lower Manhattan, preserve homes on landmark Astor Row in Harlem, and assist in numerable historic houses of worship throughout the City. She was indeed a ''Living Landmark'', leaving an indelible mark on the City she loved. Frank J. Sciame, Jr., Chair Peg Breen, President ASTOR--Brooke Russell. The Board of Trustees and Staff of the Wildlife Conservation Society are deeply saddened by the death of our celebrated friend, generous benefactor and Life Trustee, Brooke Astor. For half a century, Brooke played an important role in the Wildlife Conservation Society. She became a Trustee in 1969 and served on several important com mittees including the Development, Conservation and Executive Committees, and was Honorary Chair of the Women's Committee. Through her support, the Vincent Astor Foundation provided significant funding for several WCS projects. Brooke's willingness to explore new opportunities combined with her enthusiasm and vision were responsible for the development of the Bronx Zoo's Wild Asia complex. Her Wild Asia Monorail, her World of Darkness and exhibits at the NY Aquarium continue to be enjoyed by generations of visitors. In 1978, Brooke received WCS's distinguished Gold Medal for extraordinary service and subsequently, the Bronx Zoo's recently restored historic Astor Court was named in her honor. She will be remembered fondly for her kindness and dedication to the conservation of animals and their habitats. Brooke embodied the spirit of giving and showed us all the power of one individual to make a lasting difference in the lives of countless people. She set a standard for caring and contributing to the quality of life in New York City and elsewhere. She will be profoundly missed. We extend out deepest sympathies to her son, WCS Honorary Trustee Anthony Marshall, and her entire family. Ward W. Woods Chairman David T. Schiff Chairman Emeritus Steven E. Sanderson President and CEO Wildlife Conservation Society ASTOR--Brooke Russell. The Trustees and staff mourn with deep sadness the passing of Brooke Astor, who was a beloved Trustee and generous donor to The Metropolitan Museum of Art for more than 40 years, both personally and through the Vincent Astor Foundation. Her philanthropic touch was administered with wisdom, generosity, and great human warmth, and her versatility and degree of involvement easily qualified her as one of the most generous benefactors in the Museum's history. But she was so much more than that. Brooke understood the special mission of the Museum and was always eager to find creative ways to support its changing needs. Her generosity helped launch The Michael C. Rockefeller Wing, and The Temple of Dendur in The Sackler Wing came to the Metropolitan in part through her efforts. Her interest in China, going back to her childhood, was fundamental to the Museum's determination to become a major center for Asian art, and caused her to become the guiding force behind the creation of the Astor Court, the spiritual heart of the Museum's Asian galleries. Her support also led to extraordinary acquisitions - even after her 100th birthday-and she helped present many important exhibitions, including the 1986 showing of the treasures of the Princes of Liechtenstein. As Co-Chairman of the Chairman's Council with Annette de la Renta, and as Co-Chairman of the Visiting Committee of the Department of Asian Art, she inspired many others to become involved with the Metropolitan. And as a caring Trustee and friend, she endowed an annual holiday party for the Museum's staff and volunteers, personally greeting employees until the age of 101. Wherever there was a need, she stepped forward, often selflessly refusing to be acknowledged for her generosity. She engendered goodwill in all who came in contact with her, and was regarded with respect and affection by every member of the staff. There is a Chinese saying: ''A thousand people drink from a well dug by one man.'' Brooke dug such a well at the Metropolitan Museum, with her benefactions large and small. We treasure the time this great New Yorker spent with us, and the public will long benefit from a spirit of generosity that was remarkable beyond measure. James R. Houghton, Chrman Philippe de Montebello, Dir Emily K. Rafferty, President ASTOR--Brooke. The Board and staff of Carnegie Hall mourn the loss of our Honorary Trustee, Brooke Astor, who died on August 13th, 2007, at the age of 105. Mrs. Astor played a very important role in the history of Carnegie Hall, providing a leadership gift that inspired the philanthropic community to come to Carnegie Hall's aid and help restore its landmark building in the 1980s. For her generosity--and the myriad other ways Mrs. Astor showed Carnegie Hall her benevolence, compassion, and graciousness--we are eternally grateful. All of us at Carnegie Hall have greatly valued Mrs. Astor's presence in our lives, and we are saddened by this loss. We express our heartfelt condolences to her extended family and to the many who, like us, considered her a deeply cherished friend. Sanford I. Weill, Chairman, Clive Gillinson, Executive and Artistic Director ASTOR--Brooke Russell. The Trustees and staff of MorrisJumel Mansion Museum record with sorrow the passing of Mrs. Astor, whose kindness and support will long be remembered. James L. Kerr, Esq., President Kenneth Moss, Exec. Director ASTOR--Brooke Russell. The Board of Trustees, faculty, students, and staff of The Rockefeller University deeply mourn the passing of our cherished friend, Life Trustee, and honorary alumna Brooke Russell Astor. A woman of remarkable generosity and dedicated service to humanity, Brooke Astor was a beacon of light for all New Yorkers. No one did more to make this city a better place to live. Brooke Astor joined our Board of Trustees in 1972 and was elected the University's first Life Trustee in 1983. Throughout her trusteeship, she took a warm personal interest in the accomplishments of our scientists, from investigators in the prime of their careers to graduate students taking their first steps in independent research. Her philanthropy touched every aspect of the University, from the endowment of three faculty chairs and the establishment of a fund to support research on the brain, to the expansion of the Child and Family Center and the creation of the Brooke Astor Student Life Center. She also helped to put our Women & Science initiative on the map, by serving as honorary chair since the program's 1997 inception. Her contributions to the University were but a single facet of one of the world's most remarkable philanthropic careers. It was our great privilege to award her an honorary degree in 1984 and the David Rockefeller Award for Extraordinary Service in 1996. In her honor we created the Brooke Astor Award for Outstanding Contributions to Science, of which she was the inaugural recipient in 1998. Brooke's progressive ideals, keen intelligence, creativity, and boundless energy defied conventional notions about the effect of time's passage on the human mind and spirit. She taught us all what it means to be young at heart. We extend condolences to her son, Anthony Marshall, and all members of her family; to her great friend Annette de la Renta; and to everyone who loved her. ''And if you should survive to 105, Look at all you'll derive out of being alive. Then here is the best part. You have a head start, If you are among the very young at heart.'' Paul Nurse, President Russell Carson, Chairman David Rockefeller, Honorary Chairman Richard Furlaud, Chairman Emeritus Joshua Lederberg, President Emeritus Frederick Seitz, President Emeritus Torsten Wiesel, President Emeritus and Vincent and Brooke Astor Professor James Darnell and Paul Greengard, Vincent Astor Professors, The Rockefeller University ASTOR--Brooke Russell. The Citizens' Committee for New York City salutes Brooke Astor, our founding funder, whose vision, enthusiasm and generosity have been constant over the years. New York and its neighborhoods loved her--just as she loved New York. Osborn Elliott Founding Chairman Henry Cornell Chairman Peter H. Kostmayer President ASTOR--Vincent, Mrs.; It is with deepest sorrow that the Board of Trustees and staff of The Animal Medical Center mark the passing of our devoted friend and Trustee, Mrs. Vincent Astor. Mrs. Astor's generosity and compassion toward New York institutions influenced many lives, including those of our animal companions. The Animal Medical Center was a very fortunate witness to Mrs. Astor's largesse, most especially in the creation of two programs. In 1982 The Vincent Astor Foundation changed the course of veterinary research through the integration of AMC's work with that of other great medical institutions with the establishment of the Astor Chair of Comparative Medicine. In 1995 the Foundation acted as a generous source of funding for the Senior Assistance Veterinary Effort (SAVE), providing medical care to the companion animals of indigent elderly persons. In acknowledgment of Mrs. Astor's kindness to AMC, the Brooke Astor Award was created to stand in everlasting commemoration of Mrs. Astor's lifelong care and concern for, and generosity toward, the people of New York City. We extend our most sincere sympathies to the overwhelming number of fortunate friends and family members of Mrs. Astor, a woman whose vision, joy and strength will forever remain woven into the cloth of The Animal Medical Center. ASTOR--Brooke. The Board of Directors, Advisory Board, staff and volunteers of the Merchant's House Museum are deeply saddened by the loss of Mrs. Vincent W. Astor. We will always remember with appreciation the love she expressed for the Merchant's House on her many visits here. And we will be forever grateful for her extraordinary generosity, through the Vincent Astor Foundation, in creating the Museum's permanent endowment fund, thus ensuring the survival of the Merchant's House for generations to come. ASTOR--Brooke Russell. Born Portsmouth, NH, March 30, 1902, died August 13, 2007, Philanthropist, Author. Awarded the Presidential Medal of Freedom, 1998, by President Clinton.

One of our nation's great civic leaders and philanthropists, he was beloved by family and friends and universally respected among colleagues in business and philanthropy. Voluntary service and a strong belief in limited government were guiding principles of Jerry's life.

For more than three decades, through the Vincent Astor Foundation and her personal support, our programs have been greatly enhanced. One of our fondest memories of Mrs. Astor is when she braved a blizzard to attend a fund raiser to support our many services for people in need. Elizabeth Rohatyn, Honorary Chair Sydney Roberts Shuman, Honorary Chair Diana Ronan Quasha, Chair Thomas J. Edelman, President Warren B. Scharf, Executive Director ASTOR--Vincent, Mrs.; It is with deepest sorrow that the Board of Trustees and staff of The Animal Medical Center mark the passing of our devoted friend and Trustee, Mrs. Vincent Astor. Mrs. Astor's generosity and compassion toward New York institutions influenced many lives, including those of our animal companions. The Animal Medical Center was a very fortunate witness to Mrs. Astor's largesse, most especially in the creation of two programs. In 1982 The Vincent Astor Foundation changed the course of veterinary research through the integration of AMC's work with that of other great medical institutions with the establishment of the Astor Chair of Comparative Medicine. In 1995 the Foundation acted as a generous source of funding for the Senior Assistance Veterinary Effort (SAVE), providing medical care to the companion animals of indigent elderly persons. In acknowledgment of Mrs. Astor's kindness to AMC, the Brooke Astor Award was created to stand in everlasting commemoration of Mrs. Astor's lifelong care and concern for, and generosity toward, the people of New York City. We extend our most sincere sympathies to the overwhelming number of fortunate friends and family members of Mrs. Astor, a woman whose vision, joy and strength will forever remain woven into the cloth of The Animal Medical Center. ASTOR--Brooke Russell. The Board of Trustees, faculty, students, and staff of The Rockefeller University deeply mourn the passing of our cherished friend, Life Trustee, and honorary alumna Brooke Russell Astor. A woman of remarkable generosity and dedicated service to humanity, Brooke Astor was a beacon of light for all New Yorkers. No one did more to make this city a better place to live. Brooke Astor joined our Board of Trustees in 1972 and was elected the University's first Life Trustee in 1983. Throughout her trusteeship, she took a warm personal interest in the accomplishments of our scientists, from investigators in the prime of their careers to graduate students taking their first steps in independent research. Her philanthropy touched every aspect of the University, from the endowment of three faculty chairs and the establishment of a fund to support research on the brain, to the expansion of the Child and Family Center and the creation of the Brooke Astor Student Life Center. She also helped to put our Women & Science initiative on the map, by serving as honorary chair since the program's 1997 inception. Her contributions to the University were but a single facet of one of the world's most remarkable philanthropic careers. It was our great privilege to award her an honorary degree in 1984 and the David Rockefeller Award for Extraordinary Service in 1996. In her honor we created the Brooke Astor Award for Outstanding Contributions to Science, of which she was the inaugural recipient in 1998. Brooke's progressive ideals, keen intelligence, creativity, and boundless energy defied conventional notions about the effect of time's passage on the human mind and spirit. She taught us all what it means to be young at heart. We extend condolences to her son, Anthony Marshall, and all members of her family; to her great friend Annette de la Renta; and to everyone who loved her. ''And if you should survive to 105, Look at all you'll derive out of being alive. Then here is the best part. You have a head start, If you are among the very young at heart.''

The Trustees and staff of The New York Public Library deeply mourn the passing of our beloved Trustee and Honorary Chairman, Brooke Russell Astor. No one in the modern history of the Library played a more pivotal role in promoting, and supporting, the welfare of the Library than Brooke Astor. As an engaged Trustee of the Library for nearly five decades, Mrs. Astor understood clearly how vital the Library is to the people of our City. She worked with passion, generosity, and immense style to strengthen the Library on every level. Her many substantial benefactions, made through the Vincent Astor Foundation, supported collections, programs, staff, and facilities throughout the Library system. They also inspired, directly and indirectly, the supremely generous gifts that many individuals made to the Library in her honor or made as a consequence of the example she set. Mrs. Astor's love of the Library stemmed in large part from her own passion for both reading and writing. An accomplished writer herself of memoirs, novels, and poetry she believed that all New Yorkers, regardless of circumstance, should have access to the Library and experience the enlightenment and pleasure to be found in reading. Mrs. Astor therefore enriched the lives of countless fellow citizens through her support of the Library's work. Brooke Astor was our patroness and our symbol. She transformed the Library in lasting ways, increasing its quality, its prestige, and its centrality in the life of our City. She was a great philanthropist, a great leader, and the best and most beloved of friends. We extend our condolences to all members of her family. Catherine C. Marron, Chairman Samuel C. Butler, Elizabeth Rohatyn & Marshall Rose, Chairmen Emeriti Paul LeClerc, President ASTOR--Brooke. My dear Mrs. Astor, alas no more chance dances. I will miss you terribly, but take you in my heart each day. David Wren, Philadelphia"

2007-08-17T00:00:00Z,"ASTOR--Brooke Russell. The Trustees, Fellows, and staff of The Pierpont Morgan Library mourn the death of Brooke Russell Astor. Brooke was a valued Trustee and became a Trustee Emerita. A Fellow since 1955, she was also a founding member of the Director's Roundtable. Brooke was greatly loved here. Her generosity advanced our programs and growth. And her presence at meetings and receptions and dinners illuminated the Morgan. She inspired many others to follow her splendid example. We extend our heartfelt sympathy to her family and friends and all those who knew and miss her. Charles E. Pierce, Jr. Dir. S. Parker Gilbert, Pres., Board of Trustees ASTOR--Brooke Russell. The Trustees and staff of the Brooklyn Stained Glass Conservation Center mourn with great sadness the passing of our friend and benefactor, Brooke Russell Astor. Mrs. Astor's dedication to preserving New York City's architectural history inspired her to rescue one of the city's treasured national historic monuments, the Church of St. Ann and the Holy Trinity in Brooklyn Heights. Along with her dear friend Brendan Gill and the New York Landmarks Conservancy, Mrs. Astor, through the Vincent Astor Foundation, generously contributed to the restoration of the Church, the establishment of the stained glass studio at St. Ann's and the restoration of its greatest window, the Ascension of Christ. Originally charged with the restoration of the church's magnificent Bolton windows, the Brooklyn Stained Glass Conservation Center has evolved into a premium center for stained glass conservation, design and education. We are truly grateful for her many years of support. As a philanthropist, Mrs. Astor ran the Astor Foundation with integrity, responsibility, and a strong commitment to serve New York City. Always curious to learn more, she greeted each project with compassion and respect, never distancing herself from those she helped. We will remember her always as a remarkable, gracious lady who loved her town. Valerie Lynch, Chairman Dr. Robert Vadheim M.D., Treasurer David Goltl, Board Member David Fraser, Executive Director ASTOR--Vincent, Mrs.; It is with deepest sorrow that the Board of Trustees and staff of The Animal Medical Center mark the passing of our devoted friend and Trustee, Mrs. Vincent Astor. Mrs. Astor's generosity and compassion toward New York institutions influenced many lives, including those of our animal companions. The Animal Medical Center was a very fortunate witness to Mrs. Astor's largesse, most especially in the creation of two programs. In 1982 The Vincent Astor Foundation changed the course of veterinary research through the integration of AMC's work with that of other great medical institutions with the establishment of the Astor Chair of Comparative Medicine. In 1995 the Foundation acted as a generous source of funding for the Senior Assistance Veterinary Effort (SAVE), providing medical care to the companion animals of indigent elderly persons. In acknowledgment of Mrs. Astor's kindness to AMC, the Brooke Astor Award was created to stand in everlasting commemoration of Mrs. Astor's lifelong care and concern for, and generosity toward, the people of New York City. We extend our most sincere sympathies to the overwhelming number of fortunate friends and family members of Mrs. Astor, a woman whose vision, joy and strength will forever remain woven into the cloth of The Animal Medical Center. ASTOR--Brooke Russell. Born Portsmouth, NH, March 30, 1902, died August 13, 2007, Philanthropist, Author. Awarded the Presidential Medal of Freedom, 1998, by President Clinton. Presidential Citizen's Medal, 1988, by President Reagan. Dame of the Order of St. John of Jerusalem. Beloved mother of Anthony D. Marshall. She led a full life.

The show begins in a black-box gallery on the second floor, with an interactive installation of 21 LCD screens on a wall connected to a laptop computer, a work by Rafael Lozano-Hemmer, a young Mexican artist. Viewers can enter random words and ideas into the computer, which are then generated into questions and displayed on the screens; viewed in passing, the questions are like subliminal messages. Nearby is an installation by Jennifer and Kevin McCoy, an American husband-and-wife artist team, consisting of a tabletop model recreating the famous car accident scene from Jean-Luc Godard's 1967 film ''Weekend.'' Video cameras film the scene, the tabletop rotating to create the impression of movement, with the footage computer-processed and then played back live in a projection on an adjacent wall. It may be the coolest thing you've ever seen. But also likable are Xu Bing's interactive computer installation, above, in which viewers are invited to communicate using popular symbols, and Paul Pfeiffer's tiny LCD monitor showing a digital loop of spinning and hovering basketballs, the artist having digitally removed the players from video of NBA games.

But in SoHo, the Children's Museum of the Arts is now offering its visitors an opportunity to view other lands through eyes that are still very young: those of their peers in nations ranging from the Netherlands to North Korea. These visions make up ''The World Is My Canvas: Images From the Permanent Collection,'' 26 works by artists ages 4 to 15. Displayed with a large map, the pictures are part of the museum's holdings of more than 2,000 pieces of children's art from 50 countries. Although the museum began soliciting the work in 1990, much of it languished in storage until recently, when Elizabeth Fearon Pepperman and Jodi Richard, board members, cataloged it and organized this exhibition. ''The big push right now is to really assert ourselves as an art organization with a permanent collection that's available for people to study,'' said Lucy Ofiesh, the museum's manager of visitor services and marketing."

It occupies a small space on the second floor of a walk-up that it shares with another theater and a school on an artist-rich block just above the Lower East Side. The playhouse, under its artistic director, Alex Roe, explores America and American literature by producing old American plays, new ones based on old literary sources, and plays specifically about the city and the neighborhood. Metropolitan is currently presenting the fourth installment of a series that features the stories of local residents. Each of the nine solo performances, divided among three separate evenings (titled ''Avenue A,'' ''Avenue B'' and ''Avenue C''), represents a collaboration between an actor and a subject. Each performer was responsible for finding his own subject, who might be an artist, activist or entrepreneur. ''Sometimes they just walk up to interesting people on the street,'' Mr. Roe said. ''Actors are willing to do that.'' Performers conducted interviews and amassed several hours of material, which became fodder for monologues of about 20 minutes, consisting entirely of the interviewees' real (but edited) words. Derek Jamison, the show's director, helped pare down the text and shape each performance, but the actor's desire to play the person and the subject's allure drive each piece."

He found a way to make often overlooked details a bit more compelling. Mr. Watson's company, Watson Adventures, has gone through the museum and 18 other locations in New York City with a fine-toothed comb and found enough trivia to produce 45 different scavenger hunts, including ''Wax Attacks'' at Madame Tussaud's, ''Skyline at Sunset'' in Brooklyn Heights and ''Secrets of Greenwich Village,'' which stops in Washington Square Park, above. The most popular is ''Murder at the Met,'' which received a considerable boost from books like ''The Da Vinci Code,'' said Tracey Henry, a spokeswoman for Watson Adventures. Clues lead visitors -- who include tourists, locals, couples and singles hoping to become couples -- on a two-hour trail through the museum. By the end of the evening the hunters will not only uncover a culprit, chances are they will also discover the true goal of the search, an ''accidental education'' on the museum's treasures.

2007-08-17T00:00:00Z,"Foxy Brown, below, has been charged with felony assault, misdemeanor assault and criminal possession of a weapon, The Associated Press reported yesterday. Ms. Brown, the 27-year-old rapper, whose real name is Inga Marchand, was released on $50,000 bail after being arraigned Tuesday. The authorities allege that she hit a neighbor; her manager, Chaz Williams, said the charges were false. She was charged with assaulting Arlene Raymond, 25, who lives near Ms. Brown in Prospect Heights, Brooklyn, on July 30. The police said Ms. Raymond had complained to Ms. Brown about the volume of her car stereo. A few days later, Ms. Raymond alleged, Ms. Brown hurled a BlackBerry at her as they passed on the street, cutting her lip and knocking a tooth loose. Ms. Brown is on probation after pleading guilty to assault in a 2004 dispute over payment for a manicure at a nail salon. The latest arrest could lead to revocation of her probation. ''We have filed a violation of probation with the court,'' said Jack Ryan of the city Department of Probation. Earlier this year Ms. Brown was accused of violating probation after she threw hair glue at a beauty shop employee in Florida. She was threatened with jail in that incident but was restored to probation in good standing in June by a Manhattan judge, who said she had kept appointments with her probation officer, passed drug tests and attended required anger management classes."

Formerly held in Galapagos Art Space, Catch now makes its home at Starr Street Projects, a big, raw space in Bushwick, Brooklyn, that suits the adventuresome, rowdy mood cultivated by Catch's curators and hosts, Jeff Larson and Andrew Dinwiddie. These gentlemen take their fun as seriously as they take their art. The lineup for Catch 25 includes the choreographer Chris Yon, another delightfully brainy funny man, and the duo Asubtout, whose members Katy Pyle and Eleanor Hullihan have impeccable dancing résumés: Ms. Hullihan performs with John Jasperse, and Ms. Pyle used to dance with Jennifer Monson and Mr. Jasperse. But wait, there's more. For its 25th edition, and for the first time, Catch is featuring artists from outside New York, including the Minneapolis performing artist Megan Mayer and the Performance Thanatology Research Society from Baltimore. ''Huh?'' you might ask. Well, ''they do these -- I guess they're multimedia performance lectures,'' Mr. Dinwiddie explained in an e-mail message.

2007-08-17T00:00:00Z,"KNOWLTON--Perry H. Renowned literary agent and the former Chairman and CEO of Curtis Brown, Ltd., one of the world's oldest literary agencies, died on July 6, 2007 at the New York State Veterans' Home at Montrose in Westchester County, after a long and valiant battle with Alzheimer's disease. He was 80 years old. Born at Miss Lippincott's Lying-In Hospital in New York City on March 25, 1927, he grew up in Rye, New York. Among his childhood cohort was a young Barbara Pierce, later Barbara Bush. Upon graduating from Phillips Exeter Academy, he served in the army from 1945 to 1946. Adventurous from a young age, at 19 Knowlton and a friend crossed the Atlantic from New York to England in a 21-foot sailboat. He returned to the United States to a comparatively more settled existence as a member of Princeton's class of 1949, but his continued peripatetic nature is apparent from his roundabout journey to the center of the New York literary world. After a stint as an English teacher at the Lawrenceville School in New Jersey, he took a job in regional sales for the college textbook division of Charles Scribner's Publishers, initially in Cincinnati and then in Tucson. Knowlton married Louisa C. Tripp in 1954 and finally reached Gotham in 1956. He took a job as an editor at Scribner's, where he stayed for several years before moving into the world of agenting in 1959, when he was hired by Alan Collins, the president of Curtis Brown, Ltd. Knowlton ran the agency's book department and in 1968, following Collins's death, became President and owner of the firm. He personally represented dozens of authors and their estates, a veritable Who's-Who of 20th Century literature, including W.H. Auden, Daphne DuMaurier, Robertson Davies, Ogden Nash, Ayn Rand, Diana Gabaldon, Tony Hillerman, Frank Robinson, Jean Craighead George, Betty Friedan, Nicholas Monsarrat, Samuel Eliot Morison, A.A. Milne, Frederik Pohl, Harrison Salisbury, Frederick Forsythe, Brian Moore, Pauline Kael, Louis Auchincloss, John Knowles, C. S. Lewis, and Alvin and Heidi Toffler. He also represented Svetlana Alliluyeva, the daughter of Joseph Stalin, after her defection in 1967. He worked fiercely to protect author's rights and interests, and served on the executive board of the Society of Authors' Representatives for more than 20 years. He was one of the principal engineers in bringing about the merger of the SAR with the Independent Literary Agents Association to form the Association of Author's Representatives in 1991 and served as its President from 1993 to 1995. Perry Knowlton was known for his keen intellect, courtly manners, and good looks. He was a handsome man-more than a man of letters ever needed to be. As a sideline in the late 1950's and early 1960's, while still practicing as an agent, he modeled for print and TV advertising for Xerox and Budweiser, among others. Most notably, he was one of the original ''Marlboro Men''. He was also one of the founding members of the Friends of the Earth in 1969, along with former Sierra Club president David Brower. In 1995, several years before fully retiring from his agency practice at Curtis Brown, he returned to his boyhood interest in falconry, describing himself, at the age of 68, as ''the world's oldest apprentice to a falconer.'' After becoming a fully-licensed falconer he also became a wildlife rehabilitator, and eventually provided a home to 28 birds of prey. In addition to literary agent, teacher, falconer, editor, actor and model, his other occupations and hobbies included life - long sailor, horseman, athlete, licensed airplane pilot, navigator, certified scuba diver, beekeeper, farmer and chef. Divorced in 1961, he is survived by his three children, Timothy Knowlton, Elizabeth Knowlton McNamara and Virginia Knowlton Canfield, along with three grandchildren, Heather, Perry and Alexis, many nieces and nephews, and innumerable friends, clients and colleagues who will miss him forever. A memorial service will be held in the fall."

2007-08-17T00:00:00Z,"NEW YORK KOREAN FILM FESTIVAL The Korean movies that Americans are most familiar with are the baroque revenge fantasies of Park Chan-wook (''Lady Vengeance,'' et al.) and the slow-moving erotic melodramas of Kim Ki-duk (''Time,'' ''Samaritan Girl''). That probably says more about us than it does about a wildly eclectic film industry whose domestic audience eats up historical costume dramas, war stories, slapstick comedies, maudlin contemporary soap operas, teen sex farces, Hong Kong-like cop stories, imitation-Japanese horror films and much more. Some idea of the breadth of the output can be gained from this sprawling 28-film, two-week festival, which opens Tuesday and includes screenings at Cinema Village, the IFC Center and BAMcinématek. It begins at the Brooklyn Academy of Music with a four-film retrospective of the veteran director Im Kwon-taek, including ''Festival'' (1996), above, with Oh Jeong-hae, left, and Ahn Sung-ki. After that comes a wide sampling of recent Korean films, including three of the country's top 10 all-time box-office hits: the plastic-surgery comedy ''200 Pound Beauty,'' the gambling drama/love story ''Tazza: The High Rollers'' and the controversial and hugely successful period piece ''The King and the Clown,'' with its hints of homosexuality.

The legislation was intended to establish 18 as the minimum age to marry but also allow younger pregnant teenagers to marry with parental consent, said Representative Will Bond, a Democrat, who sponsored the bill. The bill contains an extraneous “not”: “In order for a person who is younger than 18 years of age and who is not pregnant to obtain a marriage license, the person must provide the county clerk with evidence of parental consent to the marriage.” Several lawmakers said a special session might be necessary to fix the error.

Genetic testing later showed that the woman’s body converted the codeine to morphine more rapidly and completely than in other people. That led to higher-than-expected morphine levels in her breast milk. Given the risk, the F.D.A. said, doctors should prescribe nursing mothers the smallest dose of codeine for the shortest period of time, and should closely monitor both mother and child."

2007-08-18T00:00:00Z,"10 P.M. (Cinemax) PAN’S LABYRINTH (2006) The Mexican-born Guillermo del Toro directed this political fable cum fairy tale, set in a dark forest in 1944 Spain, about a young girl whose fantasies are trampled by her stepfather’s fascist politics. The film, in Spanish with English subtitles, received Academy Awards for cinematography, art direction and makeup, but lost the Oscar for best foreign-language film to “The Lives of Others,” from Germany. Ivana Baquero plays the film’s heroine, Ofelia, who longs to believe in fairies, princesses and magic lands; Doug Jones, above, plays the woodland creature (a couple of them, actually) who charges her with three tasks. “Fairy tales (and scary movies) are designed to console as well as terrify,” A. O. Scott wrote in The New York Times. “What distinguishes ‘Pan’s Labyrinth,’ what makes it art, is that it balances its own magical thinking with the knowledge that not everyone lives happily ever after.”."

I know that the first primary is six months away (although the date keeps creeping backwards) and the conventions more than a year away, but this one is over before it's over. Clinton's national poll numbers are very high and if they hit 50 percent fence-sitters will climb down and join her ranks. John Edwards isn't going to catch fire, and Barack Obama has already caught all the fire he is able to ignite. With every day, the small possibility that Al Gore will join the race gets smaller. As for the other candidates, they are either running for vice president or just having a good time. To be sure, polls in Iowa and New Hampshire show a close contest, but I predict that as the time for actually voting gets closer, Clinton will pull away in those states, too, and the landslide will begin."

2007-08-19T00:00:00Z,"As Alex Kotlowitz reports, the contradictions and complexities of the immigration influx encourage cultural clashes and the accompanying fear and resentment (Aug. 5). Carpentersville, Ill., is a perfect microcosm of the national situation. People are inherently leery of the unknown. Just as the primary force spurring the illegal immigration explosion is economics, the impetus behind the backlash is fear. The result is that threatened Americans strike out at threatened immigrants, driving them farther underground and away from assimilation. Kotlowitz, with his probing look into circumstances and opinions of all sides involved, attempts to answer many questions, but one remains unresolved. When does fear and animus turn into bigotry? There is no conclusive evidence that Judy Sigwalt or Paul Humpfer are bigots, but many of their policies foster bigotry and are self-defeating. Compassion and compromise, not truculence and intimidation, will resolve the current immigration stalemate."

Kerouac didn't get to grow old -- he died in 1969 at 47. But foreign editions of his books, especially ''On the Road,'' continue to multiply. The covers of ''On the Road'' shown below are taken from a fascinating Web page -- find it by Googling ''Jack Kerouac Book Covers'' -- maintained by Dave Moore, a Kerouac scholar. (He edited ''Neal Cassady: Collected Letters, 1944-1967,'' the correspondence of Kerouac's friend and muse, who died in 1968.) Moore began buying these editions in the 1960s, often swapping copies with other collectors. The covers range from the eerily evocative to the deeply silly: see the 2000 cover from China, in which Kerouac's characters seem to be reimagined as the cast from ''St. Elmo's Fire.'' The one at the top left, by the way, is from the first edition of ''On the Road,'' issued by Viking in 1957. 1. United States, 1957"

2007-08-19T00:00:00Z,"KNOWLTON--Perry H. Renowned literary agent and the former Chairman and CEO of Curtis Brown, Ltd., one of the world's oldest literary agencies, died on July 6, 2007 at the New York State Veterans' Home at Montrose in Westchester County, after a long and valiant battle with Alzheimer's disease. He was 80 years old. Born at Miss Lippincott's Lying-In Hospital in New York City on March 25, 1927, he grew up in Rye, New York. Among his childhood cohort was a young Barbara Pierce, later Barbara Bush. Upon graduating from Phillips Exeter Academy, he served in the army from 1945 to 1946. Adventurous from a young age, at 19 Knowlton and a friend crossed the Atlantic from New York to England in a 21-foot sailboat. He returned to the United States to a comparatively more settled existence as a member of Princeton's class of 1949, but his continued peripatetic nature is apparent from his roundabout journey to the center of the New York literary world. After a stint as an English teacher at the Lawrenceville School in New Jersey, he took a job in regional sales for the college textbook division of Charles Scribner's Publishers, initially in Cincinnati and then in Tucson. Knowlton married Louisa C. Tripp in 1954 and finally reached Gotham in 1956. He took a job as an editor at Scribner's, where he stayed for several years before moving into the world of agenting in 1959, when he was hired by Alan Collins, the president of Curtis Brown, Ltd. Knowlton ran the agency's book department and in 1968, following Collins's death, became President and owner of the firm. He personally represented dozens of authors and their estates, a veritable Who's-Who of 20th Century literature, including W.H. Auden, Daphne DuMaurier, Robertson Davies, Ogden Nash, Ayn Rand, Diana Gabaldon, Tony Hillerman, Frank Robinson, Jean Craighead George, Betty Friedan, Nicholas Monsarrat, Samuel Eliot Morison, A.A. Milne, Frederik Pohl, Harrison Salisbury, Frederick Forsythe, Brian Moore, Pauline Kael, Louis Auchincloss, John Knowles, C. S. Lewis, and Alvin and Heidi Toffler. He also represented Svetlana Alliluyeva, the daughter of Joseph Stalin, after her defection in 1967. He worked fiercely to protect author's rights and interests, and served on the executive board of the Society of Authors' Representatives for more than 20 years. He was one of the principal engineers in bringing about the merger of the SAR with the Independent Literary Agents Association to form the Association of Author's Representatives in 1991 and served as its President from 1993 to 1995. Perry Knowlton was known for his keen intellect, courtly manners, and good looks. He was a handsome man-more than a man of letters ever needed to be. As a sideline in the late 1950's and early 1960's, while still practicing as an agent, he modeled for print and TV advertising for Xerox and Budweiser, among others. Most notably, he was one of the original ''Marlboro Men''. He was also one of the founding members of the Friends of the Earth in 1969, along with former Sierra Club president David Brower. In 1995, several years before fully retiring from his agency practice at Curtis Brown, he returned to his boyhood interest in falconry, describing himself, at the age of 68, as ''the world's oldest apprentice to a falconer.''

2007-08-19T00:00:00Z,"CORNWALL--Joseph Clift. Beloved and Widely Respected Philanthropic Leader. While an undergraduate at Princeton University, Joseph Clift Cornwall married his senior prom date, Barbara Wallace, just before graduating in 1939. Thus began a wonderful union and an association with the Wallace family that led to the founding of what later became The Fund for New Jersey. As chairman of the board of The Fund for New Jersey for its first twentyseven years, Joe Cornwall shaped a philanthropic mission to promote a more equitable and open society, and attracted to its board thoughtful statesmen, scholars and community leaders. A mentor to so many in the field, he fostered informed and intelligent deliberation in examining pressing social issues and evaluating public policy intended to address them. From its founding in 1969, Mr. Cornwall's wise leadership proved crucial to every Fund for New Jersey initiative and grant we have made in our thirty-eight year history. The cause of equal access to quality education led him to urge early support for the legal rights of urban school children. Equitable school financing became a commitment that The Fund has supported for over thirty years. What perhaps most guided Joe Cornwall was his conviction that in our democracy, an informed citizenry holds ultimate authority. So he kept an eye on the role of government to remove artificial barriers, adapt policy to meet social changes, and always to keep government accountable to the people governed. Mr. Cornwall actively supported the founding of New Jersey's public broadcasting television station, NJN, and numerous projects like the public affairs journal New Jersey Reporter to bring to the public information on the issues and opportunities before them. Joe Cornwall's search for underlying causes of social injustice was a lifelong pursuit. In 1999, The Fund for New Jersey honored our beloved founding chairman by establishing and endowing the Joseph C. Cornwall Center for Metropolitan Studies at Rutgers University, which today carries on applied policy research to better address urban issues. Genuinely humble, more intent on hearing what others could contribute than on being heard himself, affirming and optimistic in outlook; our dear friend, mentor, colleague, and leader, continues to provide us the example by which we strive to live.

2007-08-19T00:00:00Z,"SERETEAN--M.B. (Bud), carpet industry pioneer, successful entrepreneur, philanthropist, author and wellness proponent, died Monday, August 13, 2007, in London, England. He was 83. The cause of death was a brain hemorrhage. A native New Yorker and long-time resident of Chattanooga, TN, Seretean lived for the past 25 years in Boca Raton, FL. He served as a field artillery officer in the Mediterranean theater during World War II before getting a B.S. degree in marketing from Oklahoma State University and an M.S. degree in retailing from New York University. He began his career as an assistant floor coverings buyer for Allied Stores in New York. Seretean co-founded Coronet Industries Inc. in Dalton, GA, in 1956, and served as its Chairman and Chief Executive Officer for 30 years. The carpet, furniture and wall coverings manufacturer quickly grew to $400 million in sales and 4000 employees and was purchased in 1971 by RCA Corporation. Seretean recently received a Lifetime Achievement Award from the Floor Coverings Industry Foundation. Seretean's entrepreneurial spirit continued after his decades at Coronet. His other successful business ventures included co-founding Opti World in Atlanta, GA, which was ultimately sold to Lens Crafters; and co-founding ABC-TV affiliate WGXA in Macon, GA. His lifelong love of sports led him to the NBA in the 1970s when he coowned the Atlanta Hawks and served as President and General Manager of the franchise until it was later sold to Ted Turner. Seretean then became a member of the Board of Directors for Turner Broadcasting Systems (TBS), the Atlanta Hawks and the Atlanta Braves and served on all three Boards for 20 years. Seretean was known not only for his business acumen but also for his dedication to and tireless efforts on behalf of the various charitable organizations with which he was affiliated. He was an ardent supporter of his alma mater, Oklahoma State University. He served as President of OSU's Board of Governors and received an honorary doctorate from OSU in 1999, on the 50th anniversary of his graduation, for his professional achievements and philanthropic activities. It was during a visit to a Pritikin Longevity Center 25 years ago that Seretean realized the importance of wellness in his own life and committed himself to promoting its benefits to others. He founded and financed The Seretean Wellness Center at OSU and served as the driving force for the Seretean Center for Health Promotion at Emory University in Atlanta, GA, which promote healthy lifestyles by providing members of the university and the surrounding community access to the state-ofthe-art facilities and educational programs. Seretean served for 12 years on The President's Council for Physical Fitness and Sports. At 80, he was inspired by teachers Nathan Pritikin and Dean Ornish to write and publish ''Living Healthy to 100''. His dedication to practicing and promoting wellness culminated in his being awarded one of the first Lifetime Achievement Awards from The President's Council for Fitness and Sports. Seretean served as President of the Jewish Welfare Federation while living in Chattanooga and has for decades supported Israel. In recent years, he found a way to marry his commitments to Israel and wellness. Through Friends of the Israel Defense Forces, Seretean funded multiple facilities serving the soldiers of Israel, including a state-of-the-art wellness center located on a military base in the Negev. Recognizing his Romanian heritage, Seretean built a Holocaust memorial to the Jews of Dorohoi, Romania. It is located in the Judean Hills outside Jerusalem. He also planted a grove of trees honoring Romanian Jewry through the Jewish National Fund. Seretean believed in expanding access to the arts and to education as well and provided primary funding for the M.B. Seretean Center for the Performing Arts at OSU and endowed numerous scholarships at several universities. He was a member of the Board of Directors at Rhodes College in Memphis, TN, and served on the Board of the UC (University of Chattanooga) Foundation. Seretean was a member of the National Board of Directors and Chairman of Government Relations Committee for the Boys and Girls Clubs of America. Seretean's survivors include his fiance, Judy Murata; daughters Tracy Seretean, Amanda Grossman and Patricia Seretean; son, Scott Seretean; stepson, Mark Warner; sisters Zella Witt and Rhoda Naidus; grandchildren Farol, Arden and Derek Seretean; three nieces; four nephews; extended family and many friends. In lieu of flowers, the family requests memorial contributions be made either to Friends of the Israel Defense Forces (8177 West Glades Road, Suite 208, Boca Raton, FL 33434), the OSU Foundation (P.O. Box 1749, Stillwater, OK 74076) or the charity of your choice. Funeral services for M.B. Seretean will be held Monday, August 20, 2007, at 10:00am at Temple Beth El, 333 SW 4th Avenue, Boca Raton, FL 33432. Services are by Gutterman Warheit Memorial Chapel, 7240 North Federal Highway, Boca Raton, FL 33487."

Born in NYC to Joseph and Bessie A. Flowerman, Marvin graduated Brooklyn College at age eighteen to join the army. Just before departing, he married Leonora (Libby) Rosenberg, to whom he was married for 62 years. He fought in the Battle of the Bulge as a platoon sergeant and translator, and served in military government. Marvin parlayed his language proficiency to secure work in foreign trade and capitalized on opportunities he observed to establish in 1952 a business which more effectively served remote suppliers and their clientele. He traveled extensively, building decades-long friendships. He began a twenty-seven year partnership with Paul Greene in 1955, establishing PL Thomas Inc., a sister paper trading company, and several manufacturing companies. He also earned a Masters degree in international economics from the New School. He was joined in 1976 by his son Paul and guided him for nine years before moving on to pottery making, elected office and philanthropy in Far Hills. Building upon his previous studies of sculpting with John Terkin, drawing with Edwin Lanning, and ceramics at Raritan Valley Community College, Marvin set up a ceramics studio in his home with three kilns. After back problems forced him to give up his beloved competitive tennis (he served for many years as the tennis chairman for Roxiticus Golf Club) he also led the fund raising and construction of the greatly expanded Bedminster/Far Hills Library. He served six years as an elected Far Hills councilman, a position he resumed this past year to work very actively with the mayor and the police department. He was preparing for reelection as well as an art show. Mr. Flowerman is survived by his widow, Libby Flowerman, whose mutual love of piano playing brought them together, his brother Ted Flowerman, his daughter, Dr. Amy Cades and her husband Lonny Cades, son Paul Flowerman and his wife, Margot Jackler, and six grandchildren: Lisa and David Cades, Aviva Flowerman Vikstrom, and Josh, Seth, and Zac Flowerman. He was courageous in many facets of his life, and his accounts of his exotic adventures captivated multiple generations. He will be cherished for his devotion and generosity to his extended family, friends, and community. A funeral service was held Wednesday, August 15. at Temple B'nai Or, Overlook Road, Morristown, NJ.

2007-08-19T00:00:00Z,"TRIFFON--George, 74, passed away on August 7th at Cabrini Hospice Care due to complications from a stroke. He was the only son of Penelope and George Triffon of Port Jefferson, New York. He graduated from Point Jefferson High School. He acquired a commercial pilot's license in the early 1960's and in 1999 graduated ''Cum Laude'' with a B.A. degree from John Jay College of the City of NY. George was born in New York City on July 2nd, 1933. After receiving an Honorable Discharge from the US Army in 1953, he moved to Miami Beach and began an illustrious career as the lead trumpet player for Tito Puente. While there, he played with the touring Count Basie Orchestra. In 1955 he returned to New York and secured a three year stint at the Copacabana, playing for Frank Sinatra, Peggy Lee, Paul Anka, Tony Bennett, Nat Cole and Pearl Bailey. He was a member of the studio orchestra on The Merv Griffin Show. In addition to playing in many successful Broadway shows, Mr. Triffon was on the jazz scene where he played with the Duke Ellington and Benny Goodman bands at Basin Street East. Eventually he joined Goodman's band to tour in the summer of 1962, where he met his wife (singer Sandy Stewart). He also toured with Les Brown and Lionel Hampton. He was quoted in a recent interview; ''Playing for pianist Bill Evans on his album, 'From Left to Right,' was one of the biggest thrills of my career.'' He made several recordings with trombonist Bill Watrous' big band as well. Aside from his musical career, Mr. Triffon was an accomplished athlete. He worked as a lifeguard at Riis Park and Delray Beach for 20 years. At the age of 54, he won eight gold medals in swimming events in the seniors' masters competition. He is survived by his wife, Sandy Stewart and seven children; daughter Lori Elgazzar, Wendy Taylor, mother of George and Christine Triffon, cousins Denos and Lavalle Marvin; step children: Anne, Tom, Katherine and Bill Charlap and six grandchildren.

2007-08-19T00:00:00Z,"COLLIER--Chester F. The Board of Governors, the officers and members of The Westminster Kennel Club deeply mourn the passing of their friend and colleague, former president and show chairman Chester F. Collier. Mr. Collier won seven Emmys and helped build Fox News into a world media power during a lifetime in television production, but he will also be well-remembered as the man who made the annual Westminster Kennel Club Dog Show into the world's most famous dog show, with millions of viewers on live television and the Internet, a sold-out Madison Square Garden, and the object of worldwide media attention. Mr. Collier died Wednesday, August 15 at his home in Wellington, FL, from complications of diabetes. He was 80. ''Chet's knowledge of the sport and his television background created a vision that helped to enhance and grow a unique event that continues to be the very best our sport has to offer'', said Westminster President Peter R. Van Brunt. ''He will live on in this wonderful legacy he has left for the club, its members, the sport, and the dog-loving public''. This past February, Mr. Collier, past president (1989-2001), show chairman (1978-1989) and long-time member (since 1973) of the Westminster Kennel Club, was honored as the first recipient of the club's Sensation Award, in recognition of his contribution to the club, to purebred dogs, and the sport of showing dogs. ''No individual in modern times has had a more positive influence on our sport than Chet Collier'', said Westminster Show Chairman Thomas H. Bradley, 3d. ''He single-handedly created live televised dog shows, embodied by his very own world-famous Westminster. Because of him, millions of people share in this annual celebration of the dog in our lives. Fortunately, he has left behind a number of proteges to carry on his vision. All of us at Westminster and indeed, all of us in the sport of dogs, are most sincerely in his debt''. Mr. Collier was a long time network television producer and executive with Group W Productions, Westinghouse Broadcasting, CNBC and Fox News. He was president of Group W and Westinghouse Broadcasting, where he oversaw the development and production of the Mike Douglas Show, the Regis Philbin Show, The Steve Allen Show, the Merv Griffin Show and the David Frost Talk Show. In the mid-1990s, he assisted Rupert Murdoch and Roger Ailes in launching the Fox News Channel, which today is the top-rated cable news channel (Mr. Ailes had worked for him on the Mike Douglas Show). In addition to his Emmy awards, Mr. Collier also won the George Foster Peabody Award and the Robert F. Kennedy Journalism Award. He was a past president of the National Academy of Television Arts and Sciences/New England. A native of Boston, Mr. Collier became involved with purebred dogs in the 1960s, showing Bouviers des Flandres and enjoying great competitive success, with more than 50 Bests In Show. In addition to his Westminster roles, he served as an AKC delegate for a number of years and sat on the AKC's board of directors from 1986 to 1990. ''His influence, wisdom and devotion to the sport are without comparison and many of the modern, positive changes at AKC can be traced directly to Chet Collier'', said Dog News in 2000. That was the year that Westminster accorded him the honor of judging Best In Show. He was also a past president of the American Bouvier des Flandres Club, and a member of the Westchester Kennel Club and Eastern Dog Club. Mr. Collier is survived by his wife, Dorothy; three children: Ruth, Greg and Rich; and three grandchildren. A memorial service will be held in Florida at 6pm on Saturday evening, August 18, at Palms West Funeral Home, 110 Business Parkway in Royal Palm Beach. Another service will be held in New York in September on a date and location to be announced. The family requests that in lieu of flowers a donation in his name be made to: Take The Lead, PO Box 6353, Watertown, NY 13601."
2007-08-19T00:00:00Z,"Babys First Diet Pill ''Remaking the age-old survival mechanisms of the human body'' is, in the case of infant feeding, completely unnecessary (Annie Murphy Paul, Aug. 5). The age-old survival mechanism is still in place and still works. Human milk contains the appetite-regulating hormone leptin, and the act of breast-feeding allows a baby to be in control of how much he eats. These factors help explain why babies who are breast-fed are less likely to become obese as children and adults. Furthermore, breast-feeding is free, unlike specialty formulas. Mother Nature has it right."
