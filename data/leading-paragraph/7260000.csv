Upon discharge, I headed off to what became a four-year journey hitchhiking through parts of Europe, Asia, Australia, New Zealand and 9,000 miles in Africa. The rewards far outstripped the risks.

2009-09-06T00:00:00Z,"In the small trailer her family rented over the summer, 9-year-old Charity Crowell picked out the green and purple outfit she would wear on the first day of school.

Charity is one child in a national surge of homeless schoolchildren that is driven by relentless unemployment and foreclosures. The rise, to more than one million students without stable housing by last spring, has tested budget-battered school districts as they try to carry out their responsibilities -- and the federal mandate -- to salvage education for children whose lives are filled with insecurity and turmoil."

2009-09-06T00:00:00Z,"SINCE 2005 Jim O'Rourke, the once perennially busy American musician and producer, has lived in a small apartment in Japan, keeping to himself.

At first his relocation was on and off, during the long process of acquiring an artist's work visa. Now it seems pretty permanent. ''It's the only place I'm happy,'' he said during a recent telephone interview, with a perfectionist's mordant cackle. Mr. O'Rourke, 40, is about equally known for his own music -- albums like ''Eureka,'' ''Insignificance'' and his remarkable new one, ''The Visitor'' -- as for his work for other people. For about 10 years, starting in the mid-1990s, Mr. O'Rourke, based in Chicago and then New York, saw his craft, knowledge and legendarily selfless work ethic connect some far-apart poles in music: pop, improvised music, contemporary classical and noise."

2009-09-06T00:00:00Z,"The Minnesota Vikings might have been more of a favorite to win the division before they got Brett Favre. They have the best running back in football in Adrian Peterson and a good defense, especially against the run, and the unimpressive Sage Rosenfels and Tarvaris Jackson would have merely been asked to play conservatively and not make mistakes. With Favre, the Vikings' coaches may be tempted to open up the passing game and that could be a mistake. Favre can still throw the ball a mile -- the question is, who will catch it? He has a partially torn rotator cuff and is coming off surgery. These hardly seem the ingredients for an improvement in the 40-year-old Favre's play over last year, when he led the Jets into a late-season collapse with an avalanche of interceptions? If Favre can limit his interceptions -- the late-season five-year trend is not promising -- the Vikings will be one of the N.F.C. teams to beat for a Super Bowl spot. But if he is closer to the Jets' version of Favre, the Vikings, and Coach Brad Childress, will be in trouble. As it is, they will have a tough time holding off the Bears for the division title. The Chicago Bears finally have a franchise quarterback -- cue the Sid Luckman retrospectives. Jay Cutler is one of the best young quarterbacks in the league, and running back Matt Forte should have another strong year, particularly because the Bears also upgraded their offensive line. Still, the thought of Cutler's teaming with Devin Hester on the deep pass has the Bears salivating, because playing with the lead helps a defense that in the last few years has had to do much more than its share to keep the Bears in games. We'll find out how good the Bears are early: they open at Green Bay and then play the Steelers, but it could come down to the regular-season finale between the Vikings and the Bears to determine the division champion. The top of this division is a tossup, but there is not much question the Bears got the better upgrade at quarterback."

2009-09-06T00:00:00Z,"No need to spend much time on the New Orleans Saints' offense. In short, it is a powerhouse, even if Reggie Bush remains something of an enigma. Drew Brees led the league in passing yards last year, but the breakthrough player this season could be running back Pierre Thomas, who in limited playing time averaged nearly 5 yards a carry. That leaves the defense, which has undermined the Saints the last few seasons. It should be better heading into the season because every player on the line is healthy, which should finally allow an adequate pass rush. That will help the secondary, too. The Saints have seemed like a team on the brink for a few seasons, but injuries undermined them last season. If they are healthy, they could be among the N.F.C.'s elite, especially because it is hard to imagine any other team in this division improving their records from last year. The Carolina Panthers are coming off a season in which everything went well for a long time -- no significant injuries, a relatively easy schedule. But things went sour in the playoffs, where they imploded against Arizona. Quarterback Jake Delhomme had one of his worst games ever, committing six turnovers. That overshadowed what had been a good offensive season for the Panthers, who had the benefit of the rushing tandem of DeAngelo Williams and Jonathan Stewart. That opened up the passing game for Delhomme and receiver Steve Smith. The defense excels at pressuring the passer, but it has not been able to stop the run since Kris Jenkins went to the Jets. Still, the Panthers could repeat as division champs if they are lucky enough to avoid injuries again. They will not get as much help from their schedule, which is much tougher. The last month includes trips to the Patriots and the Giants and home games against the Vikings and the Saints."
2009-09-06T00:00:00Z,"AS a founder of the design studio Surface to Air, Gordon Hull has worked in film, fashion and art. Now, in his first solo show, at Partners & Spade, he is trying his hand at magic. ''Lo-fi magic,'' he stressed. Entitled ''Narratives From the Collection,'' the exhibition is a grab bag of paintings, performance, collage, sculpture, video and photography inspired by the beguiling and benevolent trickster figure of African oral narrative. Here, things are not exactly what they seem. The wonderfully grainy photos from Mr. Hull's recent trip to India have been manipulated to look like old Kodachrome images. The imperial African masks, gold-leafed by his own hand, are simply cheap tourist souvenirs. But most enchanting is a short film in which he plays the Great Belghazi, a trickless magician who, through sleight of editing, turns his friend, the artist Kon Trubkovich, into a ladder."
2009-09-06T00:00:00Z,"Girls Girls, the San Francisco duo of Christopher Owens and J R White, arrives with shoulders shrugged, head slightly down. Its debut album, titled ''Album'' (True Panther Sounds/Matador), is a lean ramble, in no way ostentatious. Knowingly or not, Mr. Owens has the tender brooding of Buddy Holly down cold, with a touch of Elvis Costello's shakiness in his voice. But ''Album'' isn't clean: it's flayed and ragged and hazy. Like so much of the noise and psychedelia lately infesting the indie-rock underground, underneath the slop lies terrific instincts for clean, artful melody. In that vein ''Album'' is one of the year's most bracing pop releases, and one of the best, a devastatingly fresh reframing of the pop songbook. Mr. White lends versatile support on these numbers, which pilfer elementary punk, country-rock and 1950s-vintage shuffles. (A beautiful instrumental with stirring gospel organs is called ''Curls.'') But Mr. Owens is the revelation, with deliciously malleable voice and attitude: desperate on ''Ghostmouth,'' snide on ''Lust for Life,'' pleading on ''Lauren Marie'' and on ''Hellhole Ratrace, '' just plain old winded. The feelings are complicated but the songs are raw -- like templates for others to copy."
2009-09-06T00:00:00Z,"Navy's strong performance against Ohio State on Saturday raises a question that has been percolating around college football: why don't more teams run the option offense? Elements of the option have returned in force the past five years as spread offenses have proliferated. But pure option teams, once a staple, are still a rarity. ''Sometimes, we get afraid of doing something we don't know much about,'' Ohio State Coach Jim Tressel said in a phone interview last week. Because so few people run it, he theorized, it's difficult to find a coach comfortable enough with the offense to implement it. He also pointed to recruiting."

Born June 27, 1934 in Brooklyn, NY. A devoted husband to Peggy and a cherished and loving father to Diane, Patrick and Ronald Jr. and spouses and proud grandfather to Meredith, Natalie, Luke and Connor. A friend to all those who were fortunate to make his acquaintance, Ron had a wonderful gift to make newcomers into friends and to touch all those who shared time with him. Ron was loyal to the schools he attended: Blair Academy, United State Military Academy at West Point and the University of Virginia. He served his country honorably as a Captain in the U.S. Army. In 1956 he was drafted by the New York Giants but selected instead to attend the University of Virginia Graduate School of Business where upon graduation he joined the faculty. Ron enjoyed a long and accomplished career spanning four decades on Wall Street. He was a solid and good man who always placed family and friends before himself and who did it with a smile. Ron leaves a legacy of a full life well lived. His heart and love will be missed by all.

2009-09-06T00:00:00Z,"Coach Bill Belichick should probably send bouquets to Michael Vick and Brett Favre with notes saying, ''Thanks for pushing us off the radar.'' While those two consumed preseason attention, Belichick's New England Patriots have the most important comeback story of the regular season and, if all goes as expected, the postseason. For those living under a rock -- or in Philadelphia or Minnesota -- Tom Brady is back from his knee injury. While the contributions of Vick and Favre remain the subject of much speculation, the expectations for Brady are simple: get the Patriots back to the Super Bowl. They came within a whisper of making the playoffs without him -- kudos to Belichick for adaptability -- and during the off-season engineered a considerable roster makeover, upgrading the secondary with Shawn Springs and Leigh Bodden. Then they added Fred Taylor, one of those aging running backs Belichick works wonders with, and receivers Joey Galloway and Greg Lewis. As a result, the Patriots could pick up where they left off in 2007, blowing out opponents for much of the season. Their offense will get two good tests in October -- against the Baltimore Ravens and the Tennessee Titans, with a game against the Denver Broncos in the middle -- before they play in London against the Tampa Bay Buccaneers. (This is the N.F.L.'s idea of a marquee game?) If Brady holds up, anything short of an appearance in the A.F.C. championship game will be a letdown. The Patriots thump you over the head with greatness. The Miami Dolphins delight you with shock value. But repeating their division title will be tough, and not just because of Brady. The Dolphins have a brutal schedule -- the toughest in the league, if you go by how opponents finished last season -- and they could easily start 0-3. It is also hard to imagine linebacker Joey Porter's matching the season he had last year. Miami drafted quarterback Pat White and will unveil new iterations of the Wildcat with him, and the secondary should be better. The Dolphins may be a better team this season than last but could finish with nine or fewer victories."

2009-09-06T00:00:00Z,"With all due respect to Tony Dungy, the Indianapolis Colts may be in the midst of the most seamless transition in N.F.L. history. That is thanks, of course, to the presence of Peyton Manning and the fact that Dungy's replacement as head coach, Jim Caldwell, was around all along. Manning is fully recovered from the secret knee surgery that hampered him early last season, and even though Marvin Harrison is gone, Manning still has plenty of receiving weapons. The Colts hope for a more consistent running game (it averaged only 3.4 yards per carry last season), and the presence of the rookie back Donald Brown of Connecticut should help. The Colts upgraded the defensive line in the off-season, which should bolster their desperate run defense immensely. The division has also helped the Colts -- Albert Haynesworth left the Titans, the Jacksonville Jaguars are struggling and while the Texans are on the upswing, they probably will not keep the Colts from winning the division again. The nondivision schedule is manageable, outside of the Colts' annual slugfest with the New England Patriots. They may not win the division, but the ultimate under-the-radar team, the Houston Texans, could make it to the playoffs for the first time. It's hard to make much noise on offense when you are in the same division as Manning, but the Texans, with receiver Andre Johnson, are good. It is their defense that may push them into the postseason, though. It's time for everyone to admit that the former general manager Charley Casserly made the right call when he drafted defensive end Mario Williams over Reggie Bush and Vince Young. Williams is one of the best defensive linemen in the N.F.L. Combine him with an elite group of linebackers, and the Texans finally have what Casserly said they needed: a way to stop the Colts. With an incredibly easy schedule to start the season, including the Jets, the Jaguars, the Oakland Raiders and the San Francisco 49ers, the Texans may finally be ready to push the Colts."

2009-09-06T00:00:00Z,"There are two reasons the Seattle Seahawks could reassume their place atop the division a year after the Cardinals shocked the N.F.L. and nearly won the Super Bowl: Matt Hasselbeck and the Kansas City Chiefs. Hasselbeck had back trouble last season and played in only seven games, and his receiving corps needed a MASH unit. Hasselbeck is back, and he can throw the ball to T. J. Houshmandzadeh, the most talented receiver he has ever had. Other than injuries, the problem last year -- and potentially this year -- is the defense. It was terrible in 2008, particularly against the pass, not a good thing when you are in the same division as Kurt Warner and Larry Fitzgerald. End Patrick Kerney is returning from an elbow injury, which should help the pass rush. The Seahawks owned this division until half the team went on injured reserve last season. If their health holds up, they should overtake the Cardinals. One thing working against the Arizona Cardinals: for a Super Bowl runner-up, they had an unusual amount of off-season tumult. Both coordinators are gone to the Kansas City Chiefs. Anquan Boldin spent the off-season upset about his contract. And Warner got a few months older. Todd Haley left to become the Chiefs' head coach, but the offense he left behind is incredible, particularly the other-worldly Fitzgerald. If Fitzgerald plays during the regular season anything like the way he did when he took over the playoffs, the Cardinals' offense cannot be stopped. Unless Warner gets hurt. The good news is the Cardinals filled a gaping need when they drafted Chris Wells, a hulking running back who can provide the ground game that was absent last season. The pass rush is still not great, so the superb secondary will have its work cut out for it the two times the Cardinals play the Seahawks."

2009-09-06T00:00:00Z,"This division can be summed up neatly as three bad teams and an underachiever. For years, the SAN DIEGO CHARGERS have had one of the most talented rosters in the league, only to struggle to make a dent. That does not apply to Philip Rivers, who has emerged as one of the N.F.L.'s best quarterbacks, even as the cornerstone of the Chargers' offense, running back LaDainian Tomlinson, has begun to fade. If Tomlinson and tight end Antonio Gates return to full health, the offense, second in scoring in the league last year, should lead the Chargers to an easy division title (San Diego finished 8-8 and still won the West last season). How much further they go may depend on the defense, which should return to form with the return of the pass rusher Shawne Merriman, in whose absence the secondary was exposed. But with Merriman back and more depth on the defense, the Chargers could be poised to make a deep run in the playoffs. They had better hurry, because the window is closing fast on this group. Whither the Denver Broncos? They were cruising to a division title last season but since then have stumbled into the N.F.L.'s alternate universe. They collapsed, losing the title and sending Mike Shanahan into temporary coaching exile. The new coach, Josh McDaniels, decided Matt Cassel was preferable to Jay Cutler, which annoyed Cutler, who threw a fit and forced a trade -- not for Cassel but for the Bears' Kyle Orton, who threw three interceptions in the first preseason game and is uncertain for the Broncos' opener with an index finger injury. And don't forget Brandon Marshall's getting upset about his contract and being suspended for part of the preseason. The Broncos also cannot count on much from an abysmal defense that was not upgraded. The middle of the schedule is brutal, and McDaniels will learn that all these distractions -- and shipping out Cutler, one of the N.F.L.'s best young quarterbacks -- do not build a winner, even in a weak division."

2009-09-06T00:00:00Z,"Give the N.F.C. East credit: it's never boring. The Giants remain the favorite because at the nitty-gritty of football -- line play and the running game -- they are among the best. The defensive line has been bolstered by the additions of Chris Canty and Rocky Bernard (although the line has also been hit by injuries in the preseason). The most important addition is the return of end Osi Umenyiora, who missed 2008 with a knee injury. The defense was still fifth in points allowed and had 42 sacks. The offensive line is superb and the running game with Brandon Jacobs can be devastating. The Giants were headed for another deep run in the playoffs, and perhaps a chance to defend their Super Bowl title, before Plaxico Burress accidentally shot himself in the leg last November, and the offense screeched to a halt. Burress is gone and so is Amani Toomer, but the Giants drafted receiver Hakeem Nicks. Still, Eli Manning, who signed a huge contract extension, may not have to make many clutch passes to win. With this running game and defense, the Giants can play conservatively and still be a Super Bowl favorite. The Giants' defense will have to worry about a new wrinkle when they play the Philadelphia Eagles, their closest competition. Michael Vick is almost certain to be used in Wildcat-type plays, where, Coach Andy Reid has hinted, he and Donovan McNabb could be on the field at the same time, with one of them lined up at receiver. But the Eagles' Super Bowl chances hinge much more on McNabb than on Vick. If the McNabb of late last season is the one who shows up this year, the Eagles are in good shape. If he is the one who was so bad against the Ravens that Reid benched him, you can expect a quarterback controversy. Otherwise, the Eagles are loaded. The defense lost the coordinator Jim Johnson, who died in the off-season after fighting cancer. Still, this is another superb defensive line and a great defense, and unless Brian Westbrook gets hurt and McNabb falls apart, this is another Super Bowl-caliber team."

2009-09-06T00:00:00Z,"Now that injuries to Michael Young and Josh Hamilton have thrown cold water on the Rangers' pursuit of the Angels in the A.L. West and Boston for the wild card, the only race in baseball with any excitement is the Colorado-San Francisco battle for the National League wild card. That leaves plenty of time to check out the September call-ups around the majors. The most accomplished of the rookies to be promoted this month is Giants catcher Buster Posey. With Bengie Molina dealing with a quad injury, Posey will be tested in the heat of the wild-card race. The fifth overall draft pick in 2008, Posey hit .326 with 15 homers and 58 runs batted in in 50 games for Class AAA Fresno."

The last time the Pirates won on the road against the Brewers was in May 2007. It is the longest such streak in the major leagues since Cleveland beat the St. Louis Browns/Baltimore Orioles 27 times in a row at Cleveland Municipal Stadium from 1952-54."

2009-09-06T00:00:00Z,"The Pittsburgh Steelers got the scare of the preseason when Ben Roethlisberger was stepped on during a practice, injuring his Achilles' tendon. Now that it looks as if Roethlisberger is O.K., he can go back to being one of the best, and the most underrated, quarterbacks in the league. The Steelers did not change much in the off-season, but why change when almost everything works so well? The line has to protect Roethlisberger better and the running game has to improve -- can Willie Parker finally stay healthy? -- to take some heat off the quarterback. But the defense has to do nothing but be as great as it was last season, which seems a given because of its coordinator, Dick LeBeau, who is starting his 51st year in the N.F.L. The Steelers made their way through the toughest schedule in the league last year. This season, they will get a huge break because they play the A.F.C. West, and the Detroit Lions. Don't be surprised if they go back to the Super Bowl. Only the Steelers could make Baltimore Ravens quarterback Joe Flacco self-destruct in the playoffs last season, which is why the Ravens will again push the Steelers in the regular season and perhaps again in the playoffs. The Ravens have all the elements in place that helped Flacco become one of the rookie surprises last year. The defense lost the coordinator Rex Ryan and linebacker Bart Scott to the Jets, but it remains loaded. The running game is strong, and Flacco has a successful season under his belt. The Ravens may not win the division, but another run deep in the playoffs would not be a shock."

2009-09-06T00:00:00Z,"THE French director Loïc Prigent admits it was laziness that prompted him to film Karl Lagerfeld, Jean Paul Gaultier, Sonia Rykiel (above) and Proenza Schouler during the 36 hours leading up to their fall 2009 fashion shows. (In Mr. Gaultier's case, it is his couture show.) ''In the past, I've followed designers around for six months,'' Mr. Prigent explained. ''This time, I wanted something easy to edit.'' Which is not to say that ''The Day Before,'' his four-part series that will have its premiere on Sept. 9, isn't rich in material: there is the panic at Proenza Schouler at having to re-sew a velvet dress just as it's about to appear on the runway; the look on everyone's face as Ms. Rykiel stumbles upon the ''secret room'' housing preparations for her surprise 40th-anniversary tribute show; the 1 a.m. collective nervous breakdown at Fendi, as loopy design assistants stage a comical fashion show of their own, an amused Mr. Lagerfeld snapping photos from the sideline.

2009-09-06T00:00:00Z,"RINEHART--Dr. John McLain, Composer, concert pianist and professor, died peacefully at age 72 surrounded by family and loved ones on Tuesday, August 4th in Atlanta, GA. He will be remembered by family and those close to him for his dry wit, huge smile and enormous appetite for living life to its fullest, but most importantly to him he will be forever remembered for his legacy as a truly gifted composer of modern classical music ranging from the piano to symphony orchestra, and as a gloriously talented and electric classical concert pianist. Born on March 17, 1937 in Pittsburgh, PA he began piano studies at age 5, composing and performing in concert his first work (a waltz for piano) at age 8 and by age 12 performing Chopin on television. He studied composition and piano performance at Kent State University for his BA, studied for his MM at Yale and the Cleveland Institute of Music and attained his Ph.D. at Ohio State Univ. Following his studies he taught at such universities and conservatories as Heidelberg, CIM and Oberlin before arriving at Antioch as the chair of the music department where he remained until his retirement in late 2004. All the while he composed works which earned performances in the U.S., Europe and Asia. He never stopped performing classical standards and modern contemporary music for solo piano, chamber ensembles and concerto across the nation, winning the highest of acclaim from his contemporaries and audiences alike. A concert played by John Rinehart was truly an exhilarating experience! During the last 13 years of his life he battled Parkinson's Disease but never gave up hope for a brighter future. He miraculously retained his skill and depth as a pianist during this time and composed his largest and broadest works to date including two new symphonies, two concertos and a full Mass. He always felt he would live on in his compositions. His dream was to have his new works performed live, a dream he and his son pursued in the final years of his life and that his son will continue to pursue in his honor and for the benefit of lovers of music around the world. Dr. Rinehart was survived by his only son, John Miles Rinehart III, his son's fiancee Nancy Myers, his sister Doris Abrams and nieces. A private memorial service was held on August 16th in Atlanta, GA. Many of his compositions and performances can be found at www.myspace.com/john mrinehart01. For more information regarding Dr. Rinehart and his compositions please write to his son at john.rinehart@gmail.com"

''I've traveled a lot, not because I work for an airline, but because I grew up in different places. I was born in Santiago but moved to Venezuela from when I was 2 until when I was 18; I traveled with my family around Latin America, the U.S. and the Caribbean. When I got back to Chile I also traveled a lot, pretty much to every country in Latin America. But it was really weird -- I always went outside Chile. Then I went to the States and lived there for two years and flew to Europe two times. So when a photographer friend of mine came to Chile to take pictures of Patagonia, I took four days off my job because I had never been. Torres del Paine is a very special place, for the shapes of the mountains, the openness, the views, the lakes, the icebergs floating in the lakes. The vegetation is really different from anything I had seen before. It was like a discovery. And I was wondering why I hadn't come sooner.'' As told to Seth Kugel"

But even his one-handed, against-the-helmet catch to continue the winning drive in Super Bowl XLII -- perhaps the greatest play in Giants history -- was not enough to save Tyree on Saturday, when he was among the players the Giants released as N.F.L. teams got down to the 53-man roster limit for the start of the regular season. Tyree could draw interest from other teams, particularly because he was a special-teams standout, but his jaw-dropping third-down catch in the Super Bowl nearly two years ago, with New England Patriots safety Rodney Harrison draped around him, turned out to be his last for the Giants. Leg injuries kept him out for the 2008 season, and he struggled with inconsistency and more injuries during training camp this summer."

2009-09-06T00:00:00Z,"YOUNG--Dr. Elizabeth, Professor of Psychiatry, Senior Research Professor at the Molecular and Behavioral Neuroscience Institute and member of the Depression Center at the University of Michigan passed away on September 1, 2009 after a yearlong battle with leukemia. She was 59 years old. Dr. Young was an internationally renowned biological psychiatrist and neuroendocrinologist who conducted seminal work on stress biology and its role in depression and other mood disorders. She was raised in the Detroit and Chicago areas and completed her medical degree from The Ohio State University in 1976. She completed her residency in Psychiatry at the same institution in 1979. She received postdoctoral training at the University of Michigan Medical School in the Department of Psychiatry and the Molecular and Behavioral Neuroscience Institute. She was then recruited to the faculty of the Institute and the Department where she remained until her death. Dr. Young was the quintessential ""translational"" physician-scientist, who understood the biology of stress and used that knowledge to enhance our understanding of the causes of mood disorders. A particular focus of her research was to uncover the biological and psychosocial reasons for the increased vulnerability of women to depression and anxiety. Dr. Young was also a loving wife and stepmother, a caring physician, a wonderful collaborator and mentor, an ardent gardener and appreciator of the best that life has to offer, and a devoted friend. She is survived by her husband Dr. Peter Hinman, her stepdaughter Dr. Mira Hinman and two step-granddaughters Annika and Celia McDermott-Hinman. A ceremony to honor her memory is planned for early October. A Memorial Fund has been created to establish The Elizabeth A. Young Lectureship on Stress and Mood Disorders at the University of Michigan. Donations to the Fund can be sent to MBNI, 205 Zina Pitcher Place, Ann Arbor, MI 48109-5720. Attn: R. Freedman."

So the news that the lads from Liverpool were taking fresh form in a video game (a video game!) called The Beatles: Rock Band struck some of the band's acolytes as nothing less than heresy. Luckily, Paul McCartney and Ringo Starr, along with the widows of George Harrison and John Lennon, seem to understand that the Beatles are not a museum piece, that the band and its message ought never be encased in amber. The Beatles: Rock Band is nothing less than a cultural watershed, one that may prove only slightly less influential than the band's famous appearance on ''The Ed Sullivan Show'' in 1964. By reinterpreting an essential symbol of one generation in the medium and technology of another, The Beatles: Rock Band provides a transformative entertainment experience."

2009-09-07T00:00:00Z,"With Kim Clijsters taking a turn at being the latest cannonball in the United States Open -- No. 3 Venus Williams the latest to be washed aside in Clijsters's fourth-round upset -- the race for the women's title is one player from being turned entirely upside down. Serena Williams, the No. 2 seed who makes an argument for being the No. 1 player in the world, stepped into the mayhem Sunday and restored her own world order. She crushed No. 22 Daniela Hantuchova, 6-2, 6-0, with an overpowering game she had left idling in the earlier rounds. That raises questions of just who can beat her when she is fired up and tuned in. She has a 22-1 record in Grand Slam matches this season, a remarkable stretch, even by Williams's lofty standards."

Where Phish's last studio album before the breakup, ''Undermind,'' was filled with dissonances and misgivings, ''Joy'' celebrates friendships, continuity and shared memories with quick-fingered glee."

2009-09-07T00:00:00Z,"It was late in the third phase of the deeply compartmentalized match between Venus Williams and Kim Clijsters, and the largely American crowd in Arthur Ashe Stadium had unmistakably chosen its favorite. In a reflection of the power of new motherhood and the lure of an excellent comeback tale, the choice would not be Williams, the dignified seven-time Grand Slam singles champion from the United States. Instead the biggest roars of approval down the stretch would be reserved for the powerfully built Belgian on the other side of the net."

''It's hard to call a defensive game and turn around and talk to people behind you and coach,'' Gundy said. ''I guess if you've done it for 40 years, you can do that.''"
2009-09-07T00:00:00Z,"By his death at 78 in 2002 Larry Rivers had had a long and prolific career in art. Yet far from being the admired figure that his work of the 1950s seemed to promise he would be, he was regarded in the art world, to the extent he was noticed at all, as a has-been, a self-repeater working in an insubstantial, out-of-date mode. People had forgotten how audacious his 1950s work once felt. At a time when heroic abstraction had a lock on the market, he was painting the figure, specifically the nude figures of his 60-something mother-in-law, Berdie Berger, and of his close friend and occasional collaborator and lover, the poet Frank O'Hara. And he was painting them with a fleet, Bonnardish realism that felt invigoratingly fresh and upbeat when set beside the turbidities of action painting."

He claimed the No. 1 spot and won Spain's National Sportsman of the Year award. His game slipped in subsequent years, and a promising 2008 season was riddled with injuries. His ranking fell to its lowest point in a decade -- to 115th as recently as May -- and he found himself having to play qualification matches for tournaments leading up to the Open."

Williams, ranked No. 2 despite winning this year's Australian Open and Wimbledon titles, is of the opinion that one's record in the majors should weigh heavily in the rankings. But the two are united in their belief that the United States Tennis Association showed disrespect to the women Saturday by moving Safina's night match against Petra Kvitova from Arthur Ashe Stadium to Louis Armstrong Stadium after the day session ended well past the scheduled 7 p.m. start of the night session. Safina's match was scheduled to be the first played at Ashe but was bumped for James Blake's match against Tommy Robredo."

Carl Kabat and a group of peace activists, including his fellow Catholic priests Daniel and Philip Berrigan, barged into a General Electric weapons plant outside Philadelphia. Known as the Plowshares Eight, they battered missile nose cones with hammers in an effort to disable some of the world's most fearsome weapons, and sprinkled blood on classified documents to protest the cold war, before they were arrested. The cold war ended with the fall of the Berlin Wall 20 years ago this November and the splintering of the Soviet Union in the early 1990s. Three of the Plowshares Eight, including Philip Berrigan, have died, and scores of other activists have turned their attention to the Arab-Israeli conflict, the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan and the terrorism suspects held at Guantánamo."

Where Phish's last studio album before the breakup, ''Undermind,'' was filled with dissonances and misgivings, ''Joy'' celebrates friendships, continuity and shared memories with quick-fingered glee."

Best known for her steadfast work with Stars and Broken Social Scene, a pair of interrelated Canadian indie-rock bands, Ms. Millan has a fondness for the rustic side of country music, with its lonesome confidences and modest avowals. A few years ago she brought a hint of twang to her respectable solo debut, ''Honey From the Tombs.'' She pursues much the same sound on ''Masters of the Burial'' but with even more reserve."

In a report prepared by a trial committee of the WGA West, the committee recommended unanimously that the guild apologize publicly to Mr. Leno, a longtime guild member, who has “been done a disservice” and had “his reputation harmed by these proceedings,” according to Variety. The writers’ strike began on Nov. 5, 2007, and concluded on Feb. 12, 2008; “Tonight” was in reruns until Jan. 2, 2008, at which point Mr. Leno, who supported the strike, resumed performing monologues that he composed without his writers. According to the committee report, Mr. Leno told the writers’ guild that as a member of the American Federation of Television and Radio Artists, a union that represents television actors and broadcasters, he was allowed to write material for his own performances. The guild’s leadership disagreed with Mr. Leno but the trial committee supported the comedian on this point. A spokesman for Mr. Leno told Variety that he was happy with the committee’s ruling and that no apology was needed."

2009-09-08T00:00:00Z,"Three days after Deputy Prime Minister Zhang Dejiang proclaimed coal mine safety to be a top priority, a gas explosion Tuesday at an unlicensed mine in Henan Province killed at least 35 workers and trapped 44 more, officials said. The explosion rocked a coal pit in the city of Pingdingshan around 1 a.m., a city spokesman told the official news agency, Xinhua, saying that 93 miners were working in the pit when the blast occurred and that 14 escaped right away. The spokesman also said the mine had been under repair and had not been cleared to resume operations. On Saturday, in remarks reported by Xinhua, Mr. Zhang called for improvements in mine safety to prevent, in particular, gas explosions. An estimated 80 percent of the 16,000 mines operating in China are illegal. Government figures show that about 3,200 people died in mining accidents last year, a 15 percent decrease from 2007."

2009-09-08T00:00:00Z,"Here's what I wonder about Derek Jeter's pursuit: will this be the greatest record he ever sets? He will come upon round numbers -- 3,000 hits, perhaps 2,000 runs, and so on -- but what other record could the 35-year-old Jeter break? He used to talk about breaking Yogi Berra's record of 10 World Series rings, but that seems impossible now. Joe DiMaggio's 56-game hitting streak is probably unassailable for anyone, and with a career-high streak of 25 (in 2006), Jeter will probably never chase it."

2009-09-08T00:00:00Z,"LET us begin the school year by stating the obvious: American handwriting is in a woeful state. Schools' insistence on teaching looped cursive handwriting has left a generation of Americans with script they dislike or is often illegible. The Palmer method and subsequent 20th-century methods were based on an ornate style that was difficult to learn and broke down under pressure. The loops and curlicues of Palmer and other similar methods obscure legibility. For good reason, one rarely finds looped cursive in print media or computer fonts. We have become a ''Please Print'' nation. Even worse, we have failed to find a replacement."

2009-09-09T00:01:30Z,"Earlier this year, researchers at Cincinnati Children’s Hospital published the most detailed and revealing case study to date of an anterior cruciate ligament rupture waiting to happen in a young girl. The study grew out of the researchers’ ongoing, large-scale examination of ACL-tear risk factors, which had enrolled hundreds of young, female athletes, measured and monitored them, and assigned some to prevention training programs. The girl in the case report hadn’t received training. She was 11 when she joined the study, a small, skinny, prepubescent basketball player. Each year, the researchers noted her height, weight, joint looseness, muscle strength, and biomechanics, using sophisticated motion-capture technology to study how she leaped and landed. At each session, as might have been expected, she’d lengthened, developing coltish legs and a slight but noticeable tendency to wobble and land knock-kneed when she hopped off of a box."

Ms. Debelle, 26, who said the album was inspired by a period in her life when she was homeless, won about $33,000 with the prize, which is awarded annually to the best British or Irish album of the year. The singer-songwriter Bat for Lashes and the rock band Kasabian were among the more recognizable acts to be nominated this year for the Mercury Prize, which in the past has gone to emerging British artists like PJ Harvey and Franz Ferdinand, though performers as mainstream as Radiohead (for its album “In Rainbows”) and Robert Plant and Alison Krauss (for their collaboration “Raising Sand”) have also been nominated. The A.P. said that Ms. Debelle had sold about 3,000 copies of “Speech Therapy,” half of them since the album was named as a nominee for the prize, adding that winners often see a boost in record sales."

His next novel is to be a fictionalized account of the life of Jesus that will differ from the version presented in the New Testament, The Guardian reported. The novel, to be called “The Good Man Jesus and the Scoundrel Christ,” will address the idea that the account of Jesus’ life depicted in the gospels was largely shaped by the apostle Paul. “Paul was a literary and imaginative genius of the first order who has probably had more influence on the history of the world than any other human being,” Mr. Pullman told The Guardian. He added that the book is “among other things, a story about how stories become stories.” The book is scheduled for an Eastertime release in Britain by the Scottish publishing house Canongate; an American release was not announced."

The United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit in a ruling issued in Pasadena, Calif., said on Tuesday that Mr. Cassirer can pursue his case against the Spanish government and the Thyssen-Bornemisza Museum in Madrid, where the disputed painting, “Rue St.-Honoré, Après-Midi, Effet de Pluie,” a Parisian street scene painted by Camille Pissarro in 1897, has been on display since 1993. Mr. Cassirer, who first filed suit in California district court in 2005, has said that his grandmother was forced to surrender the painting to the Nazis before she fled Munich in 1939. The Spanish government bought the painting as part of the Baron Hans-Heinrich Thyssen-Bornemisza’s collection, which it purchased for $338 million in 1993.

Still, for the most part, damage from oil spills happens far from the gas stations and parking lots frequented by consumers of this enduring commodity.

Mrs. Pike was a graduate of the Westover School and Bennington College. Throughout her life Connie was committed to her family, to her friends, to education and the love of learning, to community and the responsibilities of citizenship, to social justice and to the preservation of open space and the environment. In Old Lyme, the community she called her home, she found expression of these values through her work and leadership of the School Volunteer Program, the Phoebe Griffin Noyes Library, the Old Lyme Children's Learning Center and the Old Lyme Conservation Trust. She used her ever-quick mind, her sense of humor, her resilience and her perseverance to create new possibilities for those around her. She was thrilled by the election of President Obama last fall and found comfort in the hope he represents. Connie faced illness as she faced life, with courage and without complaint and died with grace and dignity. Her family thanks her legions of friends for their love and support and the staffs of the Visiting Nurse Association of Boston and of Sherrill House in Boston for their expert care giving. Connie is survived by her son William H. Pike of Reston, VA; her daughter Adele W. Pike and her husband John F. Hodgman of Brookline, MA; her brother Phillips H. Payson of Washington, CT; her step-grandson John K. Hodgman and his wife Katherine Fletcher of Brooklyn, NY and she was ""ConniePike"" to her step- great-grandchildren Lucy E. and James F. K.

It is the fourth in a larger series that Mr. Quinn has been working on since 1991, in which he creates a new cast of his head every five years to document his aging process. The artist told Agence France-Presse that his desire to create the casts “came from wanting to push portraiture to an extreme, a representation which not only has the form of the sitter, but is actually made from the sitter’s flesh.” The National Portrait Gallery paid about $500,000 for the 2006 sculpture. A display at the gallery describes the work as being comprised of “blood (artist’s), stainless steel, glass, perspex and refrigeration equipment.”"

With a staff of over 700, the comptroller audits how city agencies spend taxpayer money. Comptroller William C.

Among Democrats, a runoff is likely between the top two finishers since polls suggest that no candidate will capture the 40 percent of the vote needed to win outright.

To lighten things up, the photographer Jacob Sutton collaborated with the choreographer Jonah Bokaer on a dance-inspired story; and in ""The Randy Dandy,"" Grazia D'Annunzio reminisces about the wildly eccentric Italian decadent poet Gabriele D'Annunzio, who was her grandfather's cousin. D'Annunzio's famous motto, ""I have what I have given,"" is one we can definitely relate to here at T."

Now, to settle a suit filed by the American Civil Liberties Union, that county’s Newport-Mesa Unified School District has agreed to give anti-harassment and discrimination training to students and staff members at the high school, Corona del Mar, and in the district. Hail Ketchum, the student actress who was threatened, said that while the attacks — made in a video and posted on Facebook — “were disgusting and very disturbing to me personally,” what was “really disheartening is that when I complained about them, the administrators did little to deal with them.” The district has agreed to issue her an apology. She is now a freshman at Loyola Marymount University. “We’re very pleased with the length and the scope of the training that was required,” Hector Villagra, director of the A.C.L.U.’s Orange County office, said. Corona del Mar officials initially canceled the production of “Rent: School Edition,” which was chosen by the school theater instructor, Ron Martin.

PEN, the literary and human rights organization, sent a letter to Yale’s president and board calling the decision “out of character with Yale, its reputation and its leadership position.” The book, “The Cartoons That Shook the World” by Jytte Klausen, details the violent protests that erupted after a dozen provocative drawings by Danish cartoonists featuring the prophet were published in 2005 and 2006 in European newspapers. The cartoons, as well as other images of Muhammad, including a Doré illustration for “Dante’s Inferno,” were initially to be included. After Yale consulted with security and Islamic experts, it decided to pull all images of the prophet. The letter said that after debates among members from around the world, including countries where mob protests resulted in deaths, PEN reached “one clear, consensus position: The introduction of violence or threats of violence into debates over art and ideas is to be rejected and condemned.” The letter concluded that PEN was troubled by the “assessment that publishing the images could provoke a violent response — which we believe discredits both Professor Klausen’s work and its readership — and by the decision to pull the images based on speculative threats.”."

2009-09-13T00:00:00Z,"When Ellis Kreuger, a designer who has worked for Daryl K, Tocca and Liz Claiborne, moved to Hong Kong, the city’s famed tailors weren’t all he expected. “Left to their own devices, they tend toward a Gordon Gekko look,” he says. Together with his partner, John Alexander Daye (who has become the label’s de facto model, above), Kreuger created J. A. Daye, an online made-to-measure line. The idea is to use Hong Kong’s relatively inexpensive tailors while making sure that the clothes retain their edge. Visitors log on to the J. A. Daye Web site and browse through a collection designed by Kreuger and Daye; after making their selections, they follow a body measuring guide and input their personal data. Kreuger and Daye pass on the information to their tailoring team, and a week or so later a package arrives in the mail with the bespoke clothing carefully wrapped in tissue paper. In case you’re visiting Hong Kong, the pair just opened a store called Moustache, which carries their more casual, ready-to-wear line of the same name. [?][?][?] ARMAND LIMNANDER."

His had a small, beautiful silver watch in its bow. The interest Jones received was such that he decided to make the item available by special order at select Dunhill stores.

2009-09-13T00:00:00Z,ARTWORK BY UNITED VISUAL ARTISTS AND TOM HINGSTON STUDIO.
2009-09-13T00:00:00Z,"The first time Luc Tuymans exhibited in the United States, in 1994, he showed a painting called “Tracing,” depicting an embroidered bouquet of flowers. Simple, pleasant enough — until you learned that the pattern was taken from a chair in which someone was brutally murdered. Typical Tuymans: his most famous piece is an empty, otherwise-anonymous room with the chilling title “Gas Chamber.” The Belgian artist skyrocketed to the top of Europe’s contemporary art scene in the ’90s by using such banal, decontextualized images as stand-ins for some of history’s most troubled moments. When his first United States retrospective opens this week at the Wexner Center for the Arts in Columbus, Ohio, the subject matter will consist of 9/11, the Holocaust and the atrocities committed in the Belgian Congo, among others. But “it’s not all horror all the time,” insists Helen Molesworth, the co-curator of the exhibition, which will travel to the San Francisco Museum of Modern Art next year. “When you stand in front of his paintings, you can’t believe how beautiful they are. They have an eerie quality of developing before your eyes, like a photograph in a darkroom tray, and an uncanny sense of light and fluidity. They make you think about how just about anything in our culture can be turned into a pretty picture, and how used to it we are.” [?][?][?] MONICA KHEMSUROV."

That’s the thinking behind Homme Deux, the new suit collection by Comme des Garçons. Previously available only in Japan, it has been discreetly reworked for its international debut: suits rock subtly mismatched pinstripes, jackets are accented with tropical wool lapels, and linings boast a riot of polka dots. The softly tailored line, says Adrian Joffe, the C.E.O. of Comme des Garçons and husband to the designer Rei Kawakubo, will appeal to someone who “wants something slightly different, slightly more comfortable. . . . These are suits for the handsome mind.” [?][?][?] GLENN WALDRON."

His first collection consists mostly of variations on the bomber: nine versions in colors that include black, chocolate and dark khaki and come in lambskin or baby calf hair with laser-cut vents or parkalike stitching. Balenciaga fans will recognize Hardy’s fit: narrow in the front but with armholes wide enough to allow for freedom of movement. “Leather is alive,” says the slim 34-year-old. “Besides, nowadays even fashion victims like to be comfortable.” [?][?][?] ALEXANDRA MARSHALL."

It turns out they were onto something: design is back to a more understated aesthetic, and Loebach’s craft-meets-technology vibe is making him the most talked-about young American designer since Jason Miller. For the design store Matter, to cite an example, Loebach contributed exposed-frame sofas and turned-wood ladders to the shop’s first in-house furniture line; the Milanese gallery owner Rossana Orlandi recently snapped up his digitally distorted wood vases informed by ancient Korean pottery. “I’m more interested in things I can’t make on my own,” says Loebach, who was born and raised in Ohio, graduated from Rhode Island School of Design in 2002 and spent the first five years of his career assisting various Brooklyn woodworkers. Accordingly, his next pieces for Matter will focus on dragging into modernity what may be his least glitzy source material yet: Adirondack furniture. [?][?][?] MONICA KHEMSUROV."
2009-09-13T00:00:00Z,"Ian Barry is on a quest to make the best custom bikes anywhere. He and his fiancée, Amaryllis Knight, founded Falcon Motorcycles in Los Angeles earlier this year; together they unearth special parts on eBay and on research trips (one find: a 1920 Rolls-Royce Silver Ghost headlight) and transform them into one-of-a-kind rides. The bikes take four to nine months to complete and, like a finely tailored suit, are fitted to the owner. “If a client sits on the bike and looks like a goof,” Barry says, “something’s got to be changed.” Besides special orders, Barry and Knight are working on their Concept Ten collection, 10 bikes created from derelict frames and engines of historic British marques from the pre- and postwar era: “Those bikes were built from an artist perspective, and the shapes and forms are simply amazing.” Only one, the Bullet, has been completed and was purchased by the actor Jason Lee.

Sacho, who owns Sartoria Sacho in Toronto, trims the kapote in bright hues and lines it in everything from wild paisleys to dark purples. “The younger guys come to me for color on the buttonholes,” says Sacho, who plans to open an outpost of Sartoria Sacho in Brooklyn this fall. “Or they want the inside purple to match the purple in their tie. The older guys come to me because I will make them something that fits perfectly.” Amazingly, Sacho says his clientele is just 70 percent Jewish — and he’d like the ratio to be 50-50. If Jean Paul Gaultier could parade Hasidic-looking raiments on the runway, why can’t Sacho? “We are not all black hat, white shirt,” he says. “You can be religious and still be with the times.” Go to kapotas.com.

2009-09-13T00:00:00Z,"Having an M.B.A. from Oxford and a background in telecommunications may take you places, but London’s Savile Row isn’t usually one of them. Enter Patrick Grant, the debonair 37-year-old boss of Norton & Sons, and currently the youngest “guv’nor” on the Row. Five years ago, Grant spotted an ad in the Financial Times for the sale of Norton — a 19th-century tailoring house loved by Emperor Wilhelm I of Prussia and a young Winston Churchill. With no experience “but an enormous love of old British brands,” Grant sold his house, car “and everything else” and set about transforming the fortunes of the ailing suitmaker. Since then, the entrepreneurial Scotsman has brokered impressive collaborations with some of London’s hottest young designers (Kim Jones, Giles Deacon, Richard Nicoll and Christopher Kane) while ensuring that the company’s client list of European royalty is as nattily attired as ever. This year Grant is also developing a new fragrance with Penhaligon’s and reviving E. Tautz, a long-forgotten English label famed for its hunting breeches. Still, the old timers on Savile Row regard him with caution. “In 20 years I’ll probably still be seen as the ‘new boy’ around here,” he says, laughing. “But it hasn’t done me any harm so far.” [?][?][?] GLENN WALDRON."

Not having done this before, I realized in returning that I hadn't paid attention and was not sure how to get back. I was lost. All streets looked equally likely, so I picked one of many for no reason. I picked wrong, but that led to what followed. In front of a schoolhouse there were a lot of parked cars and people milling around among tables, apparently shopping for whatever was on display. Seeing the words ''Village Book Fair'' made me want to stop, but for some forgotten reason, I was in a hurry. It was clearly a popular event but, sadly, there were no vacant parking spaces for even a quick inspection, so I chose, reluctantly, to move on. But suddenly a car obligingly pulled out right in front of me, and I pulled in."

2009-09-13T00:00:00Z,"TYSON--David Otto. August 5th, 1925 to August 17th, 2009. Basking Ridge, New Jersey. David Otto Tyson, journalist, husband of the late Yvonne Lorgnie Tyson, passed away quietly the afternoon of August 17th after a long illness. David Tyson was born in New York City to Reba and Levering Tyson, an educator, who, in addition to a long career associated with Columbia University, served as President of Muhlenberg College. David attended the Horace Mann School in New York and, subsequently, the Kent School, in Kent, Connecticut. He graduated from Muhlenberg College in Allentown, Pennsylvania and obtained a master's degree in history from Columbia University. Entering the Navy Officer Training Program while at Muhlenberg College, David was called to active duty during the Korean War. Prior to his service in the Korean War, he worked as a journalist in Washington, DC where he met and married his beloved wife, Yvonne Lorgnie, of Paris, France. Their first two years of married life were spent in Hawaii where he was stationed at Pearl Harbor. He retired from the Navy as a Lieutenant. The Tysons returned to New York City and, after the birth of their first son, moved to Morris County, New Jersey, soon settling in Mendham, where the family remained for many years. David was a lifelong Democrat and was active in the Democratic Party of Morris County. David spent most of his career in journalism. After working as a wire service reporter for the Associated Press in Newark, he subsequently specialized in writing for and editing financial publications. He worked briefly in the marketing department of Lehman Brothers in the 1970s but returned to ""pure journalism"" after a short period of time. In 1989, after 25 years of service, he retired from his position as the American Banker's Associate Editor. He was a staunch defender of the rights of free speech and a free press in America, and was proud of his journalistic ethics. Throughout his life David remained an active member of the alumni organizations of Muhlenberg College and Columbia University. He was a devoted Columbia University football fan, which is a testimony to his generally optimistic nature. He rarely missed a home game. A member of the Coffee House, the Mendham Golf and Tennis Club, David joined the Essex Hunt Club, to offer his sons the opportunity to play ice hockey. He and Yvonne shared a lifelong passion for travel and learning and kept fit with frequent friendly rounds of tennis. David's well-documented sense of humor was coupled with a strong sense of humility. Throughout their youths, David and his siblings James Levering Tyson and Jane Tyson Clement passed summers in Bay Head, New Jersey, in a home their parents built the year David was born. Subsequently, David and Yvonne took great delight in the fact that the Bay Head house continued to provide a family retreat for the Tyson children, grandchildren and cousins. It is primarily this legacy which provides the framework for interweaving the lives and stories of the new generation of Tysons into those who have preceded them. David Tyson is survived by his two sons, Geoffrey L. Tyson, M.D. of Vancouver, Washington and Alan L. Tyson of Morristown, New Jersey, as well as Donna B. Tyson, his daughter-in-law, and five grandchildren, Melissa, Grant, Reed, Reba, and Jean Yvonne Tyson. In addition to his many nieces and nephews, sisters-in-law Elizabeth Tyson of Meadow Lakes, New Jersey, Marie-Therese Vercken and Jaqueline Lorgnie of Neuilly, France and Magdeline Touchot of Paris, France remember him fondly. He will be missed greatly. The family requests that any remembrances be made to Muhlenberg College in David's name. A celebration of David's life will be held at 10am on October 3 at the First Presbyterian Church, 2 Lee's Hill Road, New Vernon, NJ www.baileyfuneral.com"
2009-09-13T00:00:00Z,"AT New York Fashion Week, there is an easier-to-pronounce name on the runways. Heidi Mount, at right, from Centerville, Utah, is a new favorite of Karl Lagerfeld. Last year, she opened the Chanel spring ready-to-wear show and has appeared in consecutive Chanel ads (sorry, Claudia Schiffer). A new Dolce & Gabbana campaign, photographed by Steven Klein, confirms that the 22-year-old is on the rise. A rare American among the countless Brazilians and Russians who are using the runway for takeoff, Ms. Mount said that most American models don't fit the industry's stick-figure standards: ''It might have something to do with diet and nutrition at an early age.'' But the requirements for success (''a thick skin, the drive to keep going and a good personality'') are universal, she said. ''The people you work with have to like spending time with you.''"

The publication of ''Juergen Teller: Marc Jacobs Advertising 1998-2009'' ($120, Steidl) marks one of the longest-standing creative unions in fashion. For 11 years, Mr. Teller and Mr. Jacobs have collaborated on advertising for the designer's namesake collections, usually to dazzlingly subversive effect -- Mr. Teller naked in bed with Charlotte Rampling, the tween-age Dakota Fanning striking disturbingly adult poses, Winona Ryder with a shopping bag. But the Teller photos that met with the most opprobrium featured the makeup maestro Dick Page and his lover, James Gibbs. ''Men's Vogue even refused to publish it,'' Mr. Teller recalls. ''I wanted the ads to be like they are: very romantic, tender and sweet. I certainly didn't want to have anything provocative, not at all. The only other controversy that comes to mind was over an ad of a clothed Cindy Sherman and me in which I am grabbing her breasts. That caused a stir. Go figure.''

But Tata Motors of India, which bought the British automaker in a reverse-colonization, is surely thanking Ford for handing over a Jaguar that is finally purring. Aside from one spectacular debacle -- the widely panned X-Type entry luxury sedan, based on the Ford Mondeo -- history may credit Ford with transforming Jaguar's frozen-in-amber styling and notoriously shoddy reliability. No longer living in and off its glorious past, Jaguar suddenly has a lineup on its hands. These are still the pretty, pedigreed cats you expect, but they are also modern, competitive and -- according to owner surveys -- more mechanically sound than before."

Class consolidation in Yonkers resulted in the loss of four foreign-language teaching positions, and budget cuts have cost Arlington, N.Y., its seventh-grade German program, and Danbury, Conn., several sections of middle school French and Spanish."

2009-09-13T00:00:00Z,"THE NEWS The typical American household made less money last year than it made a decade ago, according to new figures from the Census Bureau. BEHIND THE NEWS In the four decades that the bureau has been tracking household income, median income has never failed to rise until now. Adjusted for inflation, it slipped to $50,303 last year from $51,295 in 1998. One reason: economic growth in the current decade has been slower than in any decade since before World War II. Income inequality also expanded, to the benefit of a small slice of the wealthy. ''We've seen a lost decade for the typical American family,'' said the economist Lawrence Katz."

2009-09-13T00:00:00Z,"I FIRST met Losi (a hairdresser so famous only one name is required) on a men's fashion shoot in the early '90s and have been a customer ever since. I had lapsed for a while, but when I ran into her recently on another shoot, her scissors and clippers came out before I knew it, and it was like old times. And I must say, there is nothing like a Losi cut, a favorite among art directors and high-placed creative types. For the last year, she's made her home at the discreet Martial Vivot Salon Pour Hommes, above, adjacent to the Museum of Modern Art. It's a kind of safe house for men. No loud hair dryers or chemical smells. Just three chairs, and one from a vintage barbershop in the garden. You can sip wine, get a cut and see the Ron Arad show next door. Best of all, your hair will thank you. Prices from $125 to $215. BRUCE PASK"

He was born on August 6, 1927 in Winnipeg, Canada, the second son of Charles James and Rose Fred Bermak. Gordon developed a precocious interest in science and medicine, pursuing a medical education in which he particularly resonated to the writings of Sigmund Freud. He graduated from the University of Manitoba Faculty of Medicine at the age of 22 (1950), and completed a residency in psychiatry at the University of Colorado. In 1954, he arrived in California, working primarily in private practice for over 55 years in Berkeley. He trained as a psychoanalyst at the S.F. Psychoanalytic Institute and taught extensively in the mental health profession, to analysts and non-analysts alike. As a native Canadian, Gordon loved the outdoors and nurtured an affinity for skiing, jogging, swimming, and sailing. He was also a proficient pianist and greatly enjoyed communicating in French. He married Dolores Ryan in 1959. They adopted a daughter in 1965, then a son in 1969. He is survived by this family. Gordon's joie de vivre lay in a deep interest with the individuality of everyone he came to know, and with a commitment to being in touch with the commonality of human suffering among the friends he consoled, the family he loved, and the patients he treated until only one week prior to his death. A public memorial for Dr. Gordon Bermak will be held on September 20, 2009, 12pm, at the Brazilian Room in Tilden Park, Berkeley, California."

By a count published in the Star on Tuesday, celebrities aligned against the Tel Aviv selection include Harry Belafonte, Viggo Mortensen and Julie Christie, while those who have defended it include Jerry Seinfeld, Natalie Portman and Sacha Baron Cohen."

2009-09-15T00:00:00Z,"Russian prosecutors have opened a criminal investigation into the possible embezzlement of funds intended for the restoration of the Bolshoi Theater in Moscow, Bloomberg News reported. The 185-year-old theater, home to both the Bolshoi Ballet and Bolshoi Opera, closed in July 2005 to undergo renovations that were supposed to be completed last year. But the project is now not likely to be finished until at least 2011.

In 2003 the agency struck a deal with the firm ZAO Kurortproekt to design the second phase of the renovation. But over the next six years, investigators said, the agency paid the firm three times for the same work, for a total of about $31 million. A spokeswoman for the agency declined to comment to Bloomberg."

Harry's service in the Coast Guard during WWII enabled him to attend the University of Iowa under the GI Bill where he received a Ph.D. in Psychology in 1952, studying with some of the most noted behaviorists of the time. After Assistant and Associate Professorships at the University of Missouri, and Duke and Adelphi Universities, he founded the Psychology Dept at the then-new SUNY at Stony Brook in 1961. By 1970, Harry had assembled a young staff of 40 full-time faculty members, and the department was cited by the National Academy of Sciences as one of the six top psychology departments in the country for the coming decade. Harry assumed administrative responsibilities at Stony Brook from 1971 to 1975, as Dean for Professional and Paraprofessional Programs and Vice President for Liberal Studies. He then returned to the Psychology department and retired as Chairman in 1985. He was a Fellow of the American Association for the Advancement of Science and the American Psychological Association. During retirement he and Millie lived in Sarasota, FL, and Brevard, NC before moving to California. Harry's seemingly inexhaustible trove of Yiddish jokes, told in an authentic accent, enlivened many a party. He is also remembered for his cantor-quality singing voice and his facility with the harmonica and autoharp. Harry is survived by his sister, Shirley, his sons Doug and Greg, four grandchildren, and two great-grandchildren and numerous nieces and nephews. The family welcomes memorial donations to The Stony Brook Foundation for a scholarship in Harry's name."

He loved the city and was often the very embodiment of its struggles and triumphs.

Neil Nash was the same; he was always grand and epic even during the hardest times.""

Neil helped manage several large institutional restoration projects after hurricane Katrina, as well as built high-end residential projects throughout New York City, and a prominent soup kitchen and social services agency in Brooklyn. A statement from close friends reads; ""No matter what Neil was going through personally he always maintained an optimism and willingness to help others, laugh out loud, and be the most stylish guy in the room. His sense of humor, rigorous honesty, and openness always made Neil a magnet for great conversations and connection with everyone he encountered.""

The program opens with ''Expo,'' an overture written for the occasion by Magnus Lindberg, the Philharmonic's composer in residence, and includes Berlioz's ''Symphonie Fantastique'' and Messiaen's ''Poèmes Pour Mi,'' performed by the soprano Renée Fleming. Alec Baldwin, the new voice of ''The New York Philharmonic This Week,'' the orchestra's weekly national radio broadcast, is host. In ''Vienna Philharmonic Summer Night's Concert 2009,'' presented at 10 by ''Great Performances,'' Daniel Barenboim conducts the orchestra on the grounds of the Schönbrunn Palace. The night-theme program features ''A Little Night Music'' by Mozart, ''A Thousand and One Nights'' by Johann Strauss and ''A Night on Bald Mountain'' by Mussorgsky. Mr. Barenboim does double duty as the pianist in de Falla's ''Nights in the Gardens of Spain.'' 7 A.M.

2009-09-16T00:00:00Z,"I LEARNED how to make good crab cakes 20 years ago from Johnny Earles, a chef and friend in the Florida Panhandle. When I say ''good,'' I mean crab cakes made predominantly from crab, seasonings, a tiny bit of mayo as binder (you need something) and not much else. And for a long time I barely tinkered with the recipe. Why would I? Everyone loved it. Then it occurred to me that I could make a formidable crab cake in a style that mimics tod mun, the Thai fish cake that, when made right, packs astonishing flavor. The challenge was replacing the mayo; it seemed odd to include it in a Southeast Asian dish. And then I realized I could take the tod mun imitation one step further and use the time-honored technique of including puréed fish as a binder."
2009-09-16T00:00:00Z,"The only thing more surprising than Mike Bell's 143 rushing yards for the Saints on Sunday was how far he had to go to get them. Bell was a star as an undrafted Broncos rookie in 2006, rushing for 677 yards and a team-high 8 touchdowns, but he fell out of favor after Denver asked him to move to fullback and signed Travis Henry. Overweight and seemingly indifferent, Bell had only six carries in five games in 2007, and the Broncos cut him last July."
2009-09-16T00:00:00Z,"FRANK--Peter F.,of Middleboro, MA, formerly of New York, passed away on September 14th at his home peacefully from an illness.

In lieu of flowers, the family requests you have dinner with a loved one and share special thoughts we take for granted in our daily life."
2009-09-16T00:00:00Z,"Watch out, offensive coordinators, because the early returns on teams that fired theirs before the regular season are promising. The offense that the departed Buffalo Bills coordinator Turk Schonert said was ''Pop Warner'' looked pretty good for most of the night against the Patriots on Monday. Trent Edwards used the no-huddle effectively, completing 15 of 25 passes for 212 yards and 2 touchdowns, with no interceptions. Tailback Fred Jackson, replacing the suspended Marshawn Lynch, had 57 rushing yards and 83 receiving yards. On the Bills' final touchdown drive, Edwards executed a nifty inside handoff to Jackson. He hid the ball on his hip as he looked downfield, as if to throw, before handing it off. The fake froze the Patriots' defense for an extra moment and gave Jackson an opening for a big gain."
2009-09-16T00:00:00Z,"SULLIVAN--Caroline I.,71, died on September 13, 2009 at her residence in Manhattan. She moved back to Manhattan from Pawling, NY in January 2009 after being diagnosed with a brain tumor. After raising her children, Caroline went back to school and received her BA/MA in urban policy from Stony Brook University in Long Island. She then worked for the city of New York for 25 years, starting in the New York City Urban Fellows Program and then worked as a staff analyst for the Controller's office. Caroline quickly rose through the ranks and was appointed the Executive Director for the Office of Payroll Administration until she retired in 2001 as the First Deputy Commission for the Office of Labor Relations. Caroline was married to Daniel Joseph for 48 years before he passed in 2003. She is survived by her four children, Daniel, John, Caroline and Elizabeth and their families and her sisters Ruth Schlieper, and Florence Gaddis. We would be remiss to forget her fifth ""child"", her niece, Ruth Anne Lazarus. Caroline had many interests including traveling, cooking, entertaining, reading, shopping, and attending the ballet and theatre. She will always be remembered for her hospitality, work ethic, and keen intellect. Caroline had many names including; mom, grandma, aunt, sister, godmother, surrogate mom, mentor and friend. She took pride in her relationships with her family and friends, which are too many to mention. She will be greatly missed. Visitation will be in Pawling, NY at Horn and Thomes Funeral Home on Wednesday, September 16, 2-4pm and 7-9pm and the mass will be at St. John's Church in Pawling on September 17 at 11am. Memorial donations may be made to either St. John's Church in Pawling or the Pawling Historical Society."
2009-09-16T00:00:00Z,"Kanye West may have said on Monday night that he owes Taylor Swift a more personal apology, but Jay Leno owes Mr. West a vast debt of gratitude. Mr. West's solipsistic but touchingly unpolished mea culpa gave the premiere of ''The Jay Leno Show'' a serendipitous and very helpful boost. Advance booking, not last-minute lobbying, brought Mr. West to Mr. Leno's new set. Mr. West's timely star turn -- an apology for his outburst on Sunday's MTV Video Music Awards -- was a lucky fluke, so the first show didn't really give viewers a chance to judge NBC's 10 p.m. experiment: the much ballyhooed shift in prime-time programming that Time magazine predicted could determine ''the future of television.'' The future of ''The Jay Leno Show'' is likely to look almost exactly like ''The Tonight Show'' past."

2009-09-17T09:36:01Z,Has the pop-cultural universe just collapsed on itself? The picture you see above is not a Photoshop trick — it’s a scene from a coming episode of “The Oprah Winfrey Show” in which Ms. Winfrey (arguably the most powerful force in daytime television) meets Jon Hamm and January Jones of “Mad Men” (arguably the most popular television series in our minds).
2009-09-17T10:26:57Z,"Confirming the reports of music bloggers everywhere and satisfying the wishes of anyone who has worked at a college rock radio station since the early 1990s, the rock band Pavement said it would reunite for a series of performances next year. Known for its low-fidelity recordings and sardonic lyrics, the band, consisting of Stephen Malkmus, Scott Kannberg, Mark Ibold, Bob Nastanovich and Steve West, played its last show in 1999 at the Brixton Academy in London. On Thursday, the Web site of Matador Records, the band’s longtime label, said that Pavement would perform on Sept. 21, 2010 at Rumsey Playfield in Central Park. In its Web post, the record label said, “Things worked out really well when Diana Ross played Central Park in 1983, and we have no reason to suspect Pavement’s return to the live arena won’t generate similar headlines.” Testing the limits of indie-rock fans’ abilities to make long-term plans, tickets for the 2010 Central Park concert will go on sale Friday."

It was “Gay Friday Night Lights.” (All right, “Openly Gay Friday Night Lights.”) But the second episode, when it finally arrived, was predictable and slightly maudlin and, despite what you might have read elsewhere, did not contain one laugh-out-loud joke. O.K., it was pretty funny when the mailman hit the windshield the second time."

2009-09-17T11:59:08Z,"In a review of the Sam Mendes film “Away We Go” in The New York Times, A. O. Scott described that director as “a literary tourist from Britain who has missed the point every time he has crossed the ocean.” So how will Mr. Mendes handle the adaptation of a literary work about New York whose author and narrator both have roots on the opposite side of the Atlantic? We may soon find out: Variety reported that Mr. Mendes’s production company has joined with Oprah Winfrey’s Harpo Productions and Focus Features to create a film adaptation of the Joseph O’Neill novel “Netherland” that Mr. Mendes may direct. The novel, which follows a Dutch-born stockbroker in New York from the 1990s to the present decade, won the PEN/Faulkner Award for Fiction for Mr. O’Neill, an American citizen of Turkish and Irish descent who was raised partly in the Netherlands. Christopher Hampton will write the “Netherland” screenplay; a cast and release date were not announced."

Ivan Lins, José Lugo, Jorge Luis Piloto, Ivete Sangalo, Gilberto Santa Rosa, Caetano Veloso and Wisin & Yandel — another Puerto Rican reggaetón duo — were each nominated three times. Besides “Los de Atrás Vienen Conmigo,” the contenders for album of the year are Andrés Cepeda’s “Día Tras Día,” Luis Enrique’s “Ciclos,” Mercedes Sosa’s “Cantora 1” and “Regência: Vince Mendoza,” by Mr. Lins and the Metropole Orchestra. The ceremony will be held in Las Vegas on Nov. 5 and broadcast live by Univision."

2009-09-17T15:12:05Z,"For whatever reason, this spring is apparently the season for cross-dressers on Broadway. A few weeks before the transfer of the Menier Chocolate Factory’s revival of “La Cage aux Folles” opens at the Longacre Theater, Broadway will see a return visit from Dame Edna Everage, the garrulous, garishly attired alter ego of the comedian Barry Humphries. In a news release, publicists for the new Dame Edna show, which is to be called “Dame Edna: It’s All About Me,” said on Thursday that it would be directed by Jerry Zaks (“Six Degrees of Separation,” “Lend Me a Tenor”) and that its limited run would begin in March at a Shubert Theater to be determined. This is Dame Edna’s third trip to Broadway, following “Dame Edna: The Royal Tour” in 1999, which won a Tony Award for special theatrical event, and “Dame Edna: Back with a Vengeance” in 2004."

Disney said it would also seek to distribute the show in the United States, although it did not specify a network for it. The program, titled “Los Años Dorados,” will maintain the spirit of the original, which was a staple of NBC in the 1980s. The new characters may not be named Blanche, Dorothy, Rose, and Sophia, but the house-sharing plot line and the Miami setting will remain the same. Disney has also produced Spanish-language editions of “Grey’s Anatomy” and “Desperate Housewives.”"

2009-09-17T00:00:00Z,"“Someday,” Bob Dylan sang, “everything’s gonna be different when I paint my masterpiece.” Is this different enough to qualify? Nearly 100 paintings by Mr. Dylan, an artist better known for his throat than for his palette, will go on display next year at the Statens Museum for Kunst in Copenhagen, Reuters reported. Among the works will be “Train Tracks,” right. The exhibition, to open in fall 2010, will include the premiere of 30 acrylic paintings from Mr. Dylan’s “Brazil” series,” as well as paintings from his “Drawn Blank” series that were shown in Britain and Germany. A representative for Mr. Dylan told Reuters that he did not know what the new paintings would depict or how Mr. Dylan chose the names of his series. In a statement the museum’s chief curator, Kasper Monrad, said, “Bob Dylan’s visual artistic practice has only been discussed by art historians to a limited extent, so critical examination and interpretation are called for.”."

A representative for Mr. Satriani told Billboard that a copyright-infringement lawsuit filed by Mr. Satriani against Coldplay had been dropped, despite an earlier claim by the guitarist that Coldplay had copied one of his songs. In December Mr. Satriani filed the suit, saying that the Coldplay song “Viva la Vida” used “substantial original portions” of his composition “If I Could Fly,” an instrumental track. Coldplay responded that any similarities between the songs were “entirely coincidental, and just as surprising to us as to him.” In a legal filing in April, lawyers for Coldplay said “If I Could Fly” should not receive copyright protection because it “lacks originality.” The details of the case remain sealed, but Billboard said that the settlement would not require Coldplay to admit any wrongdoing."

The 65,000-square-foot building is home to seven galleries, a 486-seat theater, an education center, and multiple-use spaces for community events. The two-story nonprofit center was designed by Allison Williams, a principal of Perkins & Will in San Francisco. Years in the planning, the center was named in honor of Wilson, the playwright, above, who died in 2005. He was a Pittsburgh native who won two Pulitzer Prizes and a Tony Award. The center’s inaugural season, which began last week, includes performances by the jazz violinist Regina Carter, the Philadelphia Dance Company and several plays by Mr. Wilson."
2009-09-17T00:00:00Z,"As expected, the audience for Jay Leno’s second night in prime time fell off sharply from his opening night, but Mr. Leno, the former host of “Tonight,” scored a big win with an average of 11.1 million viewers. The numbers for “The Jay Leno Show” on NBC were also good among the viewers the network most cares about: younger adults. But a few hints of concern may be forming for NBC. Mr. Leno saw his audience fall about 15 percent from his first half-hour to his second on Tuesday night. That would be good for any late-night hour, but it is usually not a good sign for 10 p.m. network shows that need to feed as big an audience as possible into the news on local stations. Among those younger viewers, those between the ages of 18 and 49, Mr. Leno declined about 35 percent from night to night — again about what was to be expected."

To reinforce looks that ranged from robustly bohemian to languid and ethereal, most were sparing with paint box and spray, and even opted at times to let nature take its course. At the Diane Von Furstenberg show (top left), Orlando Pita insisted on virgin hair styled without benefit of foams or gels. Others mimicked nature by whipping up looks that were all wispy tendrils, loose plaits, chignons and, at Altuzarra, straight flowing hair, setting off pale faces enlivened here and there with transparent strokes of pink on cheeks and lips (middle left). The faintly sun-blushed effect brought to mind a Botticelli Venus, or, in contrast, a subtly subversive girl next door."

2009-09-17T00:00:00Z,"MA--Si-Hon, dies at 84. The violinist and teacher, Ma Si-hon, died Saturday, September 12, in a nursing home in suburban Philadelphia. He had been in failing health for some time. Mr. Ma was the president of the Si-Yo Music Society which presented an annual series of chamber music concerts in New York from 1971-2004. The first concerts, with the participation of his wife, the pianist Tung Kwong-Kwong, who survives him, were performed in the Chinese School in Chinatown. Because of their popularity they soon transferred to the Schimmel Auditorium of nearby Pace University. Eventually the concerts were moved to Merkin Hall near Lincoln Center. Some of the musicians who collaborated with Mr. and Mrs. Ma in the Si-Yo Concerts were clarinetist, Stanley Drucker, Soprano, Benita Valente, Cellist, Jerry Grossman, violist, Raphael Hillyer, and many more. Mr. Ma owned and performed on the Joachim Stradivarius violin, which is thought to be the instrument Joseph Joachim played when he give the first performance of the Brahms Violin Concerto. Ma Si-Hon was born near Canton, China, on April 3, 1925 and came to this country from China in 1948. He enrolled at the New England Conservatory, where he studied with Richard Burgin, receiving a Masters degree in 1950 and the Artists Diploma in 1952. In 1951, he became the first violinist to receive the Heifetz Award at Tanglewood. In the 50s he played in the Cleveland Orchestra under George Szell, later leaving to join Tung Kwong-Kwong for several years of touring and performing in Europe, appearing at the Salzburg and Dartington Festivals, among many others. They continued to tour in the 1960s and 1970s in America under Columbia Artists Management. The Mas made several tours of the Far East, performing and teaching both in Taiwan and Mainland China as well as Hong Kong and Bangkok. In 1958, he invented a new mute for stringed instruments which is placed behind the bridge and does not have to be removed when not in use, a great improvement over the older standard mute. It was given the name ""The Si-Hon Mute"". From 1971 to 1994, Ma Si-Hon was a professor of music at Kent State University in Ohio. During that period he maintained his performing career and also continued to teach in New York City. In addition to his wife, Ma Si-Hon is survived by two sisters, nieces and nephews. The Funeral Service for Mr. Ma will be held on Saturday, September 19th 12:00 noon, at George Washington Memorial Park, 80 Stenton Ave., Plymouth Meeting, PA 19462."

The garment, so erotically charged it would have fogged up Helmut Newton's lens, actually makes an elegant scaffolding on which to hang all sorts of looks -- and lends itself to subversive role-playing. You can be the lady who lunches in cardigans and tweeds; the astral voyager, who accentuates her streamlined shape with a sharp-shouldered jacket and leggings; the soignée tomboy, shrugging a boyfriend blazer and easy-going track pants over her leather armor; or the modern Cyndi Lauper, dressing up her corsets with crinolines and lace. If the YSL is too rich -- $2,300 at Yves Saint Laurent boutiques -- there are myriad variations in stores this fall. And like the best of today's fashion, a leather bodysuit or bustier can give a piquant new spin to things you already own. Then all you need do is stock up on some racy thoughts to back it up."

2009-09-18T00:00:00Z,"President Obama scrapped his predecessor's proposed antiballistic missile shield in Eastern Europe on Thursday and ordered instead the development of a reconfigured system designed to shoot down short- and medium-range Iranian missiles. In one of the biggest national security reversals of his young presidency, Mr. Obama canceled former President George W. Bush's plans to station a radar facility in the Czech Republic and 10 ground-based interceptors in Poland. Instead, he plans to deploy smaller SM-3 interceptors by 2011, first aboard ships and later in Europe, possibly even in Poland or the Czech Republic."
2009-09-18T00:00:00Z,"After watching President Obama's pragmatic maneuvering over missile defense, staunch Eastern European allies like Poland and the Czech Republic appeared likely to become more realistic and less idealistic about United States foreign policy in the future, not to mention a lot less likely to fall in line behind the United States. The decision to suspend plans for placing missile interceptors in Poland and a radar station in the Czech Republic did not come as a tremendous surprise after months of signals from Washington. But for politicians who backed the American plan, it was a disappointment and even an embarrassment."

2009-09-18T00:00:00Z,"There were no speeches on Wednesday night when Alan Gilbert conducted his first concert as the music director of the New York Philharmonic. Many words have been spoken and written about the significance of Mr. Gilbert's appointment since it was announced two years ago. For this season-opening concert, broadcast on public television's ''Live From Lincoln Center'' series and relayed on an outdoor video screen to Lincoln Center Plaza, music would have to do the talking. And it did, eloquently and excitingly. Every orchestra promises a new day when a new conductor takes over as music director. But with the coming of Mr. Gilbert, a 42-year-old New York native, the son of Philharmonic violinists past and present, the promise could turn out to be quite true. His program was not just a collection of terrific pieces that made musical sense together but a statement of purpose. Yet what mattered was the music itself and the fresh, dynamic music making. There was no trace of agenda on this celebratory night."
2009-09-18T00:00:00Z,"The new plan that President Obama laid out for a missile shield against Iran on Thursday turns Ronald Reagan's vision of a Star Wars system on its head: Rather than focusing first on protecting the continental United States, it shifts the immediate effort to defending Europe and the Middle East. It is a long way from the impermeable shield that President Reagan described in glowing terms in 1983, an announcement that turned into a diplomatic triumph even while it was a technological flop. Ever since, missile defense has always been more about international politics than about new military technology."

The prediction comes even as the world's airlines are suffering a second consecutive year of steep losses. The company, a unit of European Aeronautic Defense and Space, forecast that airlines would buy nearly 25,000 new jets through 2028, with a market value of $3.1 trillion.

The projects are a concession to Republicans by the president, who has said he does not perceive medical malpractice to be a big factor in the cost of health care and does not think liability awards should be capped."

2009-09-18T00:00:00Z,"Here's one thing that can be said for the new Cowboys Stadium, where the Dallas Cowboys will play their first home game of the regular season on Sunday against the Giants: it's not Mickey Mouse architecture. With a $1.15 billion price tag and a flying saucer-like form, the stadium's design mercifully avoids the aw-shucks, small-town look that has become common in many American stadiums over the years. There's no brick cladding, no fake wrought ironwork, no infantilizing theme restaurants that seem as if they had been commissioned by Uncle Walt for the Happiest Place on Earth."

2009-09-18T00:00:00Z,"The shadowy craters near the south pole of the Moon may be the coldest places in the solar system, colder even than Pluto, NASA scientists said as they unveiled some of the first findings from the Lunar Reconnaissance Orbiter spacecraft. The orbiter, launched in June, officially began its one-year mission to map the Moon's surface this week. But it had begun returning data during three months of testing and calibration. Among the data, thermal measurements showed that daytime temperatures over much of the surface reached 220 degrees before plummeting at night. But the bottoms of the craters, which lie in permanent darkness, never warm above minus 400 degrees. Those ultracold temperatures have trapped and held deposits of ice for several billion years. The ice could prove a valuable resource to future explorers, not only drinking water but also, when the water molecules are broken apart, hydrogen and oxygen."

2009-09-19T00:00:00Z,"Uwe E. Reinhardt, a Princeton economist, has a gloomy forecast in assessing Senator Max Baucus's health care proposal. Mr. Reinhardt, right, writing Friday on the Economix blog, says the Baucus plan gives the insurance industry almost everything it could have wanted. But he describes a potential ''winner's curse.'' Because the Baucus plan does little to control runaway medical costs, Mr. Reinhardt says, insurers will still need to raise premiums year after year to keep up -- fueling the rising fury of a public that, under the Baucus rules, would be forced by a federal mandate to buy the increasingly expensive insurance. (Mr. Reinhardt dismisses the proposed insurance alternative, from new nonprofit cooperatives, as ''mice that roar.'')"

2009-09-19T00:00:00Z,"In the early '90s, when his place in pop music was being considered by his record company, Jon Secada recalled on Wednesday evening, one executive suggested he might be ''the Latin Johnny Mathis.'' Like Mr. Mathis, Mr. Secada, who was born in Havana and brought up in Hialeah, Fla., pitches woo to the ladies, and his new album, ''Expressions,'' includes his version of the Mathis signature hit ''Chances Are.'' But vocally Mr. Secada bears only a distant resemblance to an ethereal crooner with one foot on a pink cloud and the other kicking up stardust in celestial climes. Dressed in a gun-metal gray suit and a black T-shirt at Feinstein's at Loews Regency, he embodied upscale, post-''Miami Vice'' suavity. An aggressive physical performer who illustrates song lyrics with a prizefighter's body language, he is less a crooner than an impassioned belter who doesn't spend time building up a ballad. Cutting directly to the chase, he conveys feverishly impassioned intensity with minimal expressive shading. In quieter moments his voice can settle into a husky borderline falsetto."

A Colombian by birth and a star of Hispanic television, Ms. Vergara plays the libidinous young trophy wife of Ed O'Neill's track-suit-wearing chump-change of a husband. Satirizing the stereotype of the Latina sexpot coolly enough never to career into Charo territory, she displays gifts that extend way beyond the physical with a talent for slice-and-dice emasculating that already seems Emmy worthy."

2009-09-20T00:00:00Z,"At times, central Harlem seems to be an urban scene straight out of central casting: Step off the No. 2 or 3 train at the 116th Street stop one evening, and the air is filled with the snap-snap of double Dutch jump ropes hitting the pavement and girls tensely debating just whose turn it is. Old men hunker down over folding domino tables, and young men preen and spar with one another. But mixed with these Spike Lee-esque vignettes is another Harlem, chugging on in defiance of the recession. It includes slick boutiques and cafes, bars that attract Hollywood types and places for music that make you wonder when exactly Harlem's Renaissance happened -- then, or now? 4:30 P.M. At the start of World War I, said Jeffrey S. Gurock, the author of ''When Harlem Was Jewish, 1870-1930,'' central Harlem had a Jewish population of 125,000. That heritage lives on at Lee Lee's Baked Goods, 283 West 118th Street, (917) 493-6633, where Alvin Lee Smalls bakes the most buttery rugelach (70 cents each, but try and buy just one) in a small bakery appointed like a country kitchen. Mr. Smalls, who is black, is known for his old tongue-in-cheek window sign that once advertised the cinnamon and raisin pastry as ''rugelach by a brother.''"

2009-09-20T00:00:00Z,"Like a naval commander with an undefeated battle record, Kelsey Grammer has been unchallenged as television's most consistently on-target interpreter of jovial elitism for nearly three decades. Rebounding both from heart problems and his amusing but canceled Fox series, ''Back to You,'' he returns to network television this fall as the star of ''Hank,'' an ABC comedy predicated on the idea that there's no humbling a fallen honcho. In it Mr. Grammer plays a businessman, once a Fortune cover boy, who lost it all and finds himself forced to return to modest suburban living. ''Hank'' is only a middling exercise in recession-compatible programming, but Mr. Grammer remains a pleasure to watch, elevating the material as if he were Olivier doing a former Merrill Lynch chieftain."

A lauded profiler for the F.B.I. with a penchant for calming routines and cucumber sandwiches, Lundy won the heart of Dexter's sister, Deb (Jennifer Carpenter), during the series's second season only to be written off last year under the pretext that he had to hunt murderous sadists on the West Coast. Mr. Carradine's subdued easy sexuality made it a no-brainer that Deb would fall deep down the well for a balding man twice her age. Now Lundy is back in Miami to track down John Lithgow's Trinity Killer while inadvertently making a mess of Deb's love life. Through it all he makes us grateful that a thinking woman's sex symbol of the '70s could be so compellingly well cast."

It struck me at the time as an odd thing for her to say. If I didn't know that the movie, which stars Matt Damon as an agribusiness executive turned F.B.I. snitch, was meant to be funny, wouldn't that be clear soon enough? And anyway, I pride myself on a certain cinematic savvy.

The daughter of Thomas Aloysius Shaw and Helen McGuire Shaw, she was born on March 16, 1922 and raised in Garden City, NY. She attended Garden City High School and graduated from Katherine Gibbs College where she pursued studies in fashion design and merchandising. She began her career in the textile industry in Manhattan, and then moved to San Francisco to become an apparel buyer at the White House department store. Returning to New York, she became Fashion Editor at Parents Magazine before retiring in 1966. She then devoted her time to charitable endeavors, particularly as a board member of the Virginia Day Nursery, one of the city's oldest non-profit day care facilities originally established to care for children of working mothers, where she also served as Treasurer for several years before resigning. Thereafter, she lived in San Francisco, London and Ferrington Village in Pittsboro, NC. She is survived by her husband Eugene Vincent Moriarty, her two children, Kathleen Hill Moriarty and Kevin Shaw Moriarty and her sister Mary Jane Shaw Harvey, as well as nieces, nephews and friends.

Unfortunately for baseball, this particular fight happened as many Americans were lamenting the lack of civility in society. Fighting has always be a part of baseball, but things are nowhere near as bad as they were in the supposedly good old days. Over the course of less than a year in the early 1930s there were three particularly nasty incidents that time has largely forgotten and that make last week's scrap look tame in comparison."

As Neal Caffrey, a brainy con man who definitely isn't shopping at Syms, Mr. Bomer is all impish charisma and boyish masculinity. He could charm you into a fugue state. A prison escapee who bolted to find a long-lost girlfriend, Neal is captured by his former law-enforcement nemesis, but instead of being sent back to lockup, he is put to work for the Feds. Caffrey can outsmart the best of them, and Mr. Bomer makes it seem entirely plausible that someone who looks like a Brioni model could have an I.Q. as high as a physicist's."

I recently had dinner with some old friends, a couple with two small children, and when I told them about my typical Saturday in New York City -- doing the Times crossword puzzle, stopping off at a local flea market, maybe biking across the Brooklyn Bridge -- they looked at me as if I was describing my battles with the fierce and elusive Squid-Men among the moons of Neptune.

2009-09-20T00:00:00Z,"Allow a laboratory mouse to run as much as it likes, and its brainpower improves. Force it to run harder than it otherwise might, and its thinking improves even more. This is the finding of an experiment led by researchers at National Cheng Kung University in Taiwan and placed online in May. In the study, scientists had two groups of mice swim a water maze and in a separate trial had them endure an unpleasant stimulus to see how quickly they would learn to move away from it. For the next four weeks they allowed one group of mice to run inside their rodent wheels, an activity most mice enjoy, while requiring the other group to push harder on minitreadmills at a speed and duration controlled by the scientists. They then tested both groups again to track their learning skills and memory. Both groups of mice performed admirably in the water maze, bettering their performances from the earlier trial. But only the treadmill runners were better in the avoidance task, a skill that, according to brain scientists, demands a more complicated cognitive response. The mice who raced on the treadmills showed evidence of molecular changes in several portions of their brains when viewed under a microscope, while the voluntary wheel-runners had changes in only one area. ''Our results support the notion that different forms of exercise induce neuroplasticity changes in different brain regions,'' Chauying J. Jen, a professor of physiology and an author of the study, says."

The Millers purchased Meadow Lands Farm in Meadow Lands, PA, converting the farm into a major breeding operation with the purchase of their prolific stallion, Adios. In 1963 Mr. Miller founded The Meadows race track which hosted the Adios Stake every August (now the Delvin Miller Adios) and Grand Circuit racing for a week. The Miller home was renowned throughout the trotting world as a center of hospitality. Beginning in the 1960s, the Millers developed Meadowcroft Village near Avella, PA, as a museum of 19th century rural life, providing a charming and educational destination for thousands of Western Pennsylvania school children and families. The Miller Museum on the site chronicles Mr. Miller's family history and his extraordinary eight decade career in harness racing. Mrs. Miller served as a Trustee of the Harness Racing Museum & Hall of Fame in Goshen, NY. In 2007, the harness writers and the harness racing community of Pennsylvania established the Mary Lib Miller Award for outstanding contribution to Pennsylvania Harness Racing. There will be a memorial service to celebrate Mary Lib Miller's life on September 28, at 11am at Meadowcroft Village, Avella, PA, followed by a reception for family and friends."

He attended Dartmouth College (class of 1953), received his law degree from Boston University and served in the Naval Air Corps. As a legal editor for Matthew Bender & Co., as in his life, he would separate the wheat from the chaff and find the salient pearls of wisdom in the voluminous noise and excess that permeates our legal system and lives. Although he hated all things technological, he was one of the first to work ""virtually,"" starting in 1970 when there were no personal computers -- he lived in Vermont and New Hampshire and sent his work to New York. A longtime member of the New Hampshire Civil Liberties Union, Don filed a key case against the controversial Seabrook Nuclear Power Plant arguing that consumers should not be charged the costs of the plant while it was under construction a position later written into law by the NH State Legislature. Later, in a much-publicized case, he took up and prevailed on an issue of church/state separation regarding religious works on public property. His pro bono ACLU activities and donations, and his lifetime of legal reference work made and continue to make a significant impact on NH and federal law. Don's passions were his children, just causes, gourmet food, tennis, wine, travel, opera and organic gardening, not necessarily in that order. His undoubtedly correct and unwavering opinions were never influenced by others. He possessed a dry wit and an intellect that never ceased to amuse, entertain and provoke thought in those around him. He was an anchor in the storm and a voice of reason amidst the chaos. As a father, he successfully imparted his humor, values, ethics and goodness to all his six children, and with his unfailing kindness and generosity could always evoke a smile, even in the most difficult of times. He will be sorely missed by his family, friends and those whose lives he touched. The family suggests that in lieu of flowers contributions may be made to the New Hampshire branch of the American Civil Liberties Union (NHCLU) in memory of Donald Bacher."

2009-09-21T00:00:00Z,"In television, nothing succeeds like success. So it was Sunday night at the 61st annual Primetime Emmy Awards, where five of the top six categories featured repeat winners from last year. ''30 Rock'' and ''Mad Men,'' which garnered the most nominations in their respective comedy and drama categories, took home the top awards yet again. NBC's ''30 Rock'' won the best comedy award for the third straight year, while AMC's ''Mad Men'' won best drama for the second straight time. Tina Fey, the creator of ''30 Rock,'' which focuses on the backstage action at a comedy series much like ''Saturday Night Live,'' thanked the executives of NBC for keeping the show on the air despite its relatively low viewership and ''even though we are so much more expensive than a talk show.'' But backstage, she discounted the possibility of winning yet again next year. ''There's no way we're standing up here again,'' she said."

From Shakespeare's Henry V rallying his troops against the French at Agincourt in 1415 to the English soccer team beating the West Germans in the 1966 World Cup, to coming out on the winning side in two world wars, this is a narrative built on the high points of national memory, a connect-the-dots guide to an old land's sense of what it has done, and can do, best."

They moved players around to try to pick up the blitz. But nothing the New England Patriots tried Sunday in their 16-9 loss to the Jets could hide the obvious: Tom Brady is not himself, and the Patriots' offense is in disarray. Except for five magnificent minutes against the Buffalo Bills -- and a big gift from Leodis McKelvin in the form of a fumbled kickoff return in the last two minutes -- the Patriots have sputtered, and they would be 0-2, with tough home games against Atlanta and Baltimore in the next two weeks."

The court papers, released after the arrests in Colorado of Najibullah Zazi and his father, as well as that of an imam in Queens, showed that during a search in New York of the younger Mr. Zazi's rental car on Sept. 11, agents found a laptop computer containing an image of the notes.

It's a day after too, of course, once the media has had its say based on the judgments. Let's hope they soon put out a video - FIA reality TV show - then we'll get the physical nuances as well as the vocal ones."

That's a shame because, as I'm reminded every time I visit, the country has so much to offer.This is, of course, low season, particularly on the Caribbean coast, so even the party town of Cancún was quiet. I stayed at Aqua, one of the few design-y properties in town, the first entrant in a new brand from the big Mexican hotel company Grupo Posadas (perhaps best known for Fiesta Americana). It was a nice return for me; I'd stayed at Aqua when it was brand new back in 2005, before it got hammered by Hurricane Wilma. Posadas fully restored the hotel, and I can report it's back to its former self: a glimmering temple of marble (tons of marble), with sleek white rooms, a Michelle Bernstein restaurant, a nice suite of interlocking infinity pools overlooking the beach and a kind of Zen spa vibe that's a departure for Cancún. The place was pretty empty, which had its pluses (virtually no one at the pool) and minuses (a slightly eerie feel in the cavernous public spaces)."

2009-09-22T00:00:00Z,"Perhaps nothing in medicine more aptly depicts the paradoxical statement ''doing better, feeling worse'' than high blood pressure. Despite an extraordinarily easy way to detect it, strong evidence for how to prevent it and proven remedies to treat it, more Americans today have undetected or poorly controlled hypertension than ever before. The aging of the population is a reason but not the only one, said Dr. Aram V. Chobanian, a hypertension expert at Boston University Medical Center. As he summarized the problem in an interview and in The New England Journal of Medicine in August, Americans are too sedentary and fat. They eat too much, especially salt, but too few potassium-rich fruits and vegetables."

2009-09-23T10:31:50Z,"Prosecutors in Mexico said on Tuesday that they are investigating a claim that more than 1,000 items attributed to the artist Frida Kahlo in a private collection and two books are forgeries, The Associated Press reported. The attorney general’s office in Mexico City told The A.P. that a complaint filed by the Diego Rivera and Frida Kahlo Trust said that paintings, notes and drawings bearing Kahlo’s signature and featured in the books “Finding Frida Kahlo” and “The Labyrinth of Frida Kahlo: Death, Pain and Ambivalence” are fakes. James Oles, an assistant professor at Wellesley College who has criticized the books, told The A.P. that items in the collection, said to have come from boxes that Kahlo gave to a carpenter, include significant spelling errors, low-quality paintings and other suspicious details. But Princeton Architectural Press, which published “Finding Frida Kahlo,” said it plans to keep selling the book. “In the book, we state that the pieces have not been 100 percent authenticated, that it’s still being researched,” said Katharine Myers, the imprint’s publicity director, according to The A.P."

Cooper, who made a fortune by, among other things, developing the I-beam that was pivotal in allowing cities to grow vertically through skyscrapers, eventually gave away much of his wealth. Among the areas that concerned him was education for the working class, especially as the old apprentice system was elbowed aside by the industrial revolution. In 1859 he opened the Cooper Union for the Advancement of Science and Art to provide free education and training for working people. It was “a revolution in education,” the Princeton historian Sean Wilentz notes in the documentary, “Mechanic to Millionaire: The Peter Cooper Story,” which was produced by the Gardner Documentary Group and will also have showings at the Zimmerli Art Museum at Rutgers on Oct. 7 and the New Jersey State Museum in Trenton on Oct. 11."

The Telegraph of London reported that Ms. Roberts, who is in India to shoot a movie version of the Elizabeth Gilbert memoir “Eat, Pray, Love,” angered Hindus there when they discovered that the film had closed off access to a local temple at the start of a religious festival. Worshipers at Ashram Hari Mandir, near Delhi, said that a security team including 350 guards, bulletproof cars and a helicopter had sealed off the temple at the start of Navratri, a nine-day celebration to honor the goddess Durga. Shakuntala Devi, a worshiper who was turned away from temple, told The Telegraph: “Entry for devotees is barred. We were not allowed to enter and pray in the morning by the security. Only those who could manage to sneak in did so but most of us were all sent back.” Ms. Roberts had earlier drawn praise from the Universal Society of Hinduism, which said her interest in the religion had raised its profile."

The Board and Staff of Brooklyn Legal Services Corporation (""Brooklyn A"") were shocked and deeply saddened to learn of the passing Monday of the program's long term Director of Litigation, Rick Wagner. Rick was a brilliant and fiery lawyer, deeply committed to the struggle for economic and social justice in the world and in our neighborhoods. Over the years he invested his incredible skills in fighting to achieve those goals at the Center for Constitutional Rights, the law firm of Stolar, Alterman, Wagner & Boop, and for the last 25 years at Brooklyn A. He used his enormous energy, creativity and vision to apply, among the other tools, the federal RICO statute to empower tenants, and in most recent years was a national leader in the fight against predatory lending, mortgage frauds and title rescue scams, protecting low income, mostly minority homeowners in huge and successful battles to save or recover their homes. Rick was truly one of a kind, and will be greatly missed by his clients, by his colleagues and by his huge network of admirers. Memorial services will be scheduled shortly.

2009-09-24T00:00:00Z,"AS fall marathons draw closer, training runs become longer, which often translates to more chafing. On runs of 10 miles or longer, friction -- either of skin-on-skin or fabric-on-skin -- can start to burn hot spots on a runner's feet, thighs and nipples, as well as under bra straps. The result? Blisters or painfully raw skin. ''Chafing is a triad of friction, heat and moisture,'' said LaJean Lawson, an expert on the study of breast motion during exercise who helps clothing companies develop low-friction sports gear. ''Friction is especially a problem with running because it is a cyclical motion. You can get rubbed the wrong way two to four times per second.''"

2009-09-24T00:00:00Z,"The new Privia PX-130 from Casio (available online for $500) is a nice model for those who want an inexpensive digital keyboard that has the feel of a real piano. I tested it last week at a musical-instrument store and I liked what I heard and felt. Strike a chord with force, and it's noticeably louder than a softly formed chord. The keys at the lower registers are slightly more stiff than in the higher register, just as in a real piano, and notes fade convincingly when using the sustain pedal. The PX-130 even handles quickly repeated notes pretty well. The Privia PX-130 includes 16 sounds, like harpsichord, bass or organ. (Changing instruments requires that you press a combination of two buttons, however, which is a bit clunky.)"

Sara was a devoted and loving wife, mother, grandmother, sister, friend, adviser, teacher, and volunteer. Born and raised in Illinois farm country, Sara moved to New York City in 1966 and quickly built her own small town of friends and colleagues on the Upper West Side, where she was a fixture for more than 40 years. She advised hundreds of eighth graders on high school placement at The Cathedral School of St. John the Divine until she retired in 2003. Earlier in her career, Sara taught nursery school, first in Englewood, New Jersey and then at The Calhoun School. She attended the University of Illinois and graduated from New York University in 1968. She was a tireless champion of All Angels' Church, serving on the vestry and as junior and senior wardens. She was also a board member of The Dome Project, an organization that assists challenged youth. She enjoyed spending weekends in Colebrook, Connecticut, relaxing in the quiet surroundings and attending St. James Church in Winsted. She was blessed by a wide and loyal circle of friends, who cherished her warmth, humor, candor and steadfast companionship. She is survived by Norman, her husband of 43 years, sons Matthew and Clark, daughter-in-law Kimberly, grandchildren Eliza and Luke, and sister Ann Wilkerson. In lieu of flowers, donations can be made in her honor to Incarnation Center (PO Box 577, Ivoryton, Connecticut 06442).

The first two, one could argue, represent a return to optimism by those designers who are holding out hope that stocks really do rise with hemlines. The third is bit of a mystery. Or, as Linda Wells, the editor of Allure, put it last week in a video interview, ''perfectly insane.''

In the years since 9/11, producers have found rich thematic material in the arguments for and against preordination, resulting in series like ''The Sarah Connor Chronicles,'' ''Lost'' and now ''FlashForward,'' which begins in such a spirit of bracing suspense that I am challenged to recall another pilot that lured me so quickly into addiction. Loosely based on a clunky science-fiction novel of the same title by Robert J. Sawyer, ''FlashForward'' (starting Thursday on ABC) imagines a global blackout in human consciousness -- lasting precisely 2 minutes 17 seconds -- when billions of people around the world experience visions of their lives six months into the future. Specifically they're seeing themselves on April 29, 2010. And while ''FlashForward'' seems to avoid (at least so far) the geeky pretensions of ''Lost,'' which invite so much circuitous decoding, the date hardly seems arbitrary as it carries the symbolic weight of historic incident."

The book is as faithful an adaptation as I could make it.” Discussing the artwork by Mr. Young, Mr. Shanower said: “Skottie managed to capture the whole world of Oz in a new way.

Can California stake its claim as the team to beat in the Pac-10? Is Jacory Harris ready to impress again for Miami? Or will Tyrod Taylor become the quarterback du jour in the A.C.C.? Those are some of the questions being raised, and hopefully answered, this weekend. So, as always, let us know if you agree, disagree or simply find our predictions laughable. Get ready for another exciting weekend of college football."

My progressive dad took me to get my left ear pierced back in 1992, when I was 15, on a family trip to the West Coast. By the time I got to college I had pierced my right ear and put another hole in my left, but a couple years later I took them all out. I hadn't thought about it again until a couple of months ago, when I noticed that the jewelry designer Philip Crangi was wearing two earrings in his left ear and one in his right. His story was similar to mine, albeit a bit more extreme: by the time he got tired of wearing his, in 1995, he had six holes in each ear. (Very '90s). He didn't put any earrings on again until he started designing them specifically for men. ""I keep it pretty simple now, with a classic '80s smallish stud,"" he said.

But the Hôtel Le Bristol, which happens to have added both those things recently, now has something that few, if any, grande dame hotels will brag about anytime soon: an entirely new wing.Fashioned from five apartments in an adjacent building at the intersection of Avenue Matignon and Rue du Faubourg Saint-Honoré, the new wing is spread over seven stories and is the culmination of years of planning, development, wrangling and lawsuits. Twenty-six individually decorated rooms and suites are done up with silk and cotton fabrics, faux stucco walls and a handful of antique reproductions and paintings in an old-masters style. The overall look and feel is sort of streamlined traditional - not ornate or overembellished but comfortable and perhaps a bit spartan, considering the price tag.

The awards, which come with a prize of about $163,000 each, are given for lifetime arts achievement in categories not covered by the Nobel Prizes. They were established in 1988 to mark the association's 100th anniversary and to honor Prince Takamatsu, its longtime honorary patron, who died in 1987. In a news release, the association said that in addition to Mr. Stoppard, who is being honored for his theater and film work, and Ms. Hadid, this year's architecture laureate, it would give awards to the photographer Hiroshi Sugimoto, the sculptor Richard Long and the pianist Alfred Brendel. The awards will be bestowed in a ceremony in Tokyo on Oct. 22. ... Two former officials of Medellín, Colombia, will share the Curry Stone Design Prize for a public works plan that helped rejuvenate one of the city's poorest neighborhoods. The administrators for the annual design award said on Thursday that its $100,000 prize would be split by Alejandro Echeverri, the city's former director of urban projects, and Sergio Fajardo, its former mayor, for a plan that brought modern buildings and public spaces to the slums of Medellín over a four-year period. During that time, the city reported a reduction in homicides and an increase in tourism."

The robbery occurred just after 10 a.m., shortly after the museum, a former home of Magritte, opened, when a man rang the doorbell to ask if visiting hours had started. The man then pointed a gun at the museum attendant while an accomplice went inside. The thieves made museum workers and visitors kneel in a courtyard while they left on foot with a 1948 painting, ''Olympia,'' above, a nude portrait of Magritte's wife. The Guardian said that the men, who spoke English and French, set off an alarm when they broke a glass plate that protected the painting, but that they had escaped by the time the police arrived.

He served on the Executive Committee and Board of Directors of the American Committee, and on the International Board of the Institute. His deep involvement over the past decades with the Weizmann Institute, and the Palm Beach Region in particular, will be missed, along with his wisdom, passion, and humility.

His many gifts include the establishment, with his late wife, Rosalind, of the Rosalind and Joseph Gurwin Vacuum Processing Laboratory in the Institute's Submicron Research Center. Recently, he and his wife Phyllis established the Phyllis and Joseph Gurwin Fund for Scientific Advancement, which helps move promising research from the laboratory to the marketplace--a gift that exemplifies his practical commitment to the future of Science for the Benefit of Humanity and the Weizmann Institute. Having narrowly escaped the Holocaust, Joe once said, ""I believe that we were born in this universe to make it a better place, and in order to make it a better place we have to give back."" His generosity in supporting Weizmann research has indeed made the world a better place--and, thanks to his foresight and planning, will continue to produce world-changing science long into the future.

Sounds good, right? Well, not so fast. Many experts say the high-risk pools already available in 35 states are plagued by high costs and inadequate coverage."

He conceded that Palau, which has a population of barely 20,000, would have difficulty enforcing the ban, but he said he expected other countries would follow Palau's lead on the issue."

2009-09-25T00:00:00Z,"The United States' decision to engage the ruling junta in Myanmar drew the endorsement on Thursday of that nation's most prominent dissident, Daw Aung San Suu Kyi, but analysts cautioned that the change would not have a significant effect soon. On Wednesday, Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton said the United States would pursue engagement, though it would maintain the economic sanctions that had been imposed to punish the government of Myanmar, formerly known as Burma, for its human rights abuses and restrictions on political freedom. The shift represents the most significant modification of administration policy toward Myanmar in decades, but analysts said it was likely to face opposition in Congress, where many members strongly support an antagonistic approach to the junta. Mrs. Aung San Suu Kyi has long been an advocate of sanctions but has also tried to engage the ruling generals in a dialogue and has said any future government would have to include the military. ''She said she accepts direct engagement, but it must be on both sides,'' her lawyer, U Nyan Win, said after visiting her on Thursday. By both sides, he said, she meant both government and opposition."

Installations include live chickens by the Belgian artist Koen Vanmechelen and ''Painting in Absurdistan,'' above, by Gloria Friedmann. Contemporary art has been controversial in Russia in recent years, with criminal charges of ''inciting hatred'' filed against the former director of Moscow's Sakharov Museum, Yuri Samodurov, and the curator Andrei Erofeev for a contemporary art exhibition titled ''Forbidden Art'' that was held there. It has also been profitable and embraced by wealthy Russians as a sign of social status and sophisticated tastes, although the art market has suffered from the financial crisis."

Robinson got bailed out by a terrible call on an interception with just over two minutes to go.

It's enough of a task to come to grips with Mr. Wright's skills at the keyboard and ability to go long and glorious -- last spring he wrote a heave about Carlos Slim, the Mexican mogul who bought a piece of a certain little newspaper -- but now we find out he pounds a keyboard that makes music as well. And if that isn't sickening enough, WhoDo, which includes some other hacks turned musicians like John Burnett of NPR, will be backing Ruby Jane Smith, the 14-year-old fiddling phenom who has tongues wagging every which way every time she plays. Most journalists, including those of us at Decoder, are challenged to get a toe tapping in time to the music, so excuse us for not jumping for joy at the specter of journo-journeymen musicians. Honesty and craft compel us to mention that we hear the band is wonderful, but it's still a bit much, no?"

Hyatt declined to rehire them even though Gov. Deval Patrick had called for state employees to boycott Hyatt unless the workers were reinstated. The laid-off housekeepers averaged around $15 an hour with health benefits, while the new housekeepers hired through a temporary agency receive $8 an hour without health benefits. Phil Stamm, general manger of the Hyatt Regency Boston, said, “Every housekeeping employee who wants a job will have one.” Lucine Williams, a laid-off housekeeper, said: “I don’t want Hyatt to find me a job. I want Hyatt to give me back my job. It’s insulting for them to say I’m not good enough to go back to work for them.” Hyatt said it would extend the laid-off workers’ health benefits through March 31, when they would have the option of obtaining benefits through the janitorial company or any other employer they worked for."

(Starz) CADILLAC RECORDS (2008) Jeffrey Wright, Mos Def and Beyoncé Knowles, above, star as Muddy Waters, Chuck Berry and Etta James in this celebration of Chicago blues and the founding of a recording company in the 1950s by Leonard Chess (Adrien Brody), who sees a potential gold mine in ''race music.'' Darnell Martin's film ''is not -- thank goodness -- another dutiful musical biopic, but rather the group portrait of a remarkable, volatile constellation of artists,'' A. O. Scott wrote in The New York Times, adding that it would be worth seeing for the music alone. ''Mr. Wright's renditions of Muddy Waters's signature songs are more than respectable, while Ms. Knowles's interpretations of Ms. James's hits -- 'At Last' and 'I'd Rather Go Blind,' in particular -- are downright revelatory.

2009-09-26T00:00:00Z,"A bankruptcy judge said after an all-day hearing on Friday that he would rule later on whether to approve Tribune Company's plan to pay managers up to $66.8 million in incentive bonuses, with about half of that going to 10 top executives. The chief executive, Sam Zell, left, whose leveraged buyout of the company in 2007 added $8 billion to an existing debt load of $5 billion, is not in the group of 10. The United States Bankruptcy Trustee and the Washington-Baltimore Newspaper Guild, joined by several other unions, objected to the plan. They challenged the newspaper publisher's contention that suitable cash bonuses were crucial to its ability to emerge from Chapter 11 bankruptcy and return operating cash flow from this year's six-month low of $195 million to recent annual levels of more than a billion dollars. Judge Kevin J. Carey said the competing issues are whether a corporate board should be free to exercise its judgment that a bonus plan would improve business, or whether there was any need for a troubled industry to give bonuses when ''there is no place for management to go.''"

With his defensive stalwarts retired or scattered around the league and his offense spreading the field despite diminishing returns, Belichick cannot stop the gradual Patriots decline that began in Super Bowl XLII. Like plutonium, New England (1-1) has an extended half-life and is still lethal, even in decay. The Falcons' general manager, Thomas Dimitroff, may replace Belichick, his former employer, as the league's reigning genius. He drafted Matt Ryan and other less-heralded rookie starters (linebacker Curtis Lofton, tackle Sam Baker) last year, then acquired the veterans Tony Gonzalez and Mike Peterson last off-season. Gonzalez already has almost as many receiving yards in two games (144) as Justin Peelle, last year's starting tight end, had in 16 games (159). Peterson has 17 tackles, an interception and 2 forced fumbles. Excellent drafting, wise free-agent decisions: it's all very early-century Belichickian. New England's afterburners will trump Atlanta (2-0) on Sunday, but the Patriots may not be favorites the next time these teams meet."

''My wife and I were going to visit our son, who lives in Portland. It was the first time we'd been there, so we decided to go around and see the sights. It wasn't really my idea to see the tulips. Even when we drove up to the farm, it was like 'Oh, wow.' But as we began to walk through the tulip fields, I was just sort of overcome by the vividness of the colors. It was just incredible. I've seen so many now, I feel like I'm sort of a tulip connoisseur. I was kind of surprised, actually, at how much I got into the whole experience. I think just because the color -- once you're in it and you're actually walking through the rows -- the color just sort of overtakes a person's senses.'' As told to Austin Considine"

How could Burton not be stunned to receive a rave review in his first job from a major London critic for the way he, with bucket and brush, wordlessly scrubbed a floor, largely with his back to the audience? I don't think he ever lost that wonderment about his great gift. I raised the idea that even one so lavishly successful as he was might fear the disappearance of all that fairy gold and fame and talent; the old Greek idea of being struck low by the envious gods.

2009-09-27T00:00:00Z,"The single biggest problem in American education is that no one agrees on why we educate. Faced with this lack of consensus, policy makers define good education as higher test scores. But higher test scores are not a definition of good education. Students can get higher scores in reading and mathematics yet remain completely ignorant of science, the arts, civics, history, literature and foreign languages. Why do we educate? We educate because we want citizens who are capable of taking responsibility for their lives and for our democracy. We want citizens who understand how their government works, who are knowledgeable about the history of their nation and other nations. We need citizens who are thoroughly educated in science. We need people who can communicate in other languages. We must ensure that every young person has the chance to engage in the arts."

This six-part documentary series travels from Acadia, Yosemite and Yellowstone to the Grand Canyon, the Florida Everglades and the Gates of the Arctic in Alaska to chronicle the evolution of national parks across nearly 150 years. The first episode, ''The Scripture of Nature (1851-1890),'' examines how John Muir, a Scottish-born wanderer, led Congress to pass the 1864 act that protected the Yosemite Valley in California for ''public use, resort and recreation,'' and how a second act in 1872 christened Yellowstone, a ''wonderland'' of geysers, mud pots and sulfur pits in the northwest corner of the Wyoming territory, America's first national park.

Born in Brookline, MA, Ms. Topkis was granted a full scholarship to Radcliffe College, from which she graduated magna cum laude in 1948. After moving to New York, she soon began making a name for herself in the field of scholarly publishing, working in the editorial departments of houses such as Praeger Publishers, Free Press, and John Wiley & Sons. In 1978, she began teaching at the University of Denver's Publishing Institute, and continued to teach there, every summer and with enormous pleasure, for the next 30 years. In 1981 she became senior editor at Yale University Press, where she specialized in books on sociology, psychology, and psychoanalysis, many of which went on to win prestigious awards. When she left Yale, in 1998, her departure was marked with a festschrift featuring original papers written for the occasion by a number of internationally prominent psychoanalysts. Though technically retired, she continued to work on a freelance basis, and also acted as the Editorial Director of Felony & Mayhem Press, a small mystery-fiction imprint. She is survived by her daughter, Maggie Topkis, of New York City; by the more than 3,000 students whom she guided towards (or away from) careers in publishing; and by the hundreds of books she edited, all of which would have been much the poorer without her.

2009-09-27T00:00:00Z,"BERSON--Iolabee ""Sis"". Our grandmother was one of the most incredible women we have ever known. She was born here in New York, the oldest of four children in the Dworman family. As the only girl, she was raised as ""one of the boys."" She went to college in Macon, Georgia (where they had never seen ""a Jew"" before) and then worked in the family's real estate business. When she married our grandfather (to whom she was married for over 60 years -- as different as two people can be but a real love affair) he was a young physician in private practice. However, our grandmother always encouraged him ""to dream big"" -- as she always did. And so the two of them started to build private hospitals and never looked back. They worked tirelessly -- and side by side. They had two loving daughters together -- Rhetta and Bonnie -- and with that gave birth to a beautiful family tree of grandchildren and great-grandchildren. Our grandmother was a New York icon, known throughout New York as a hard-driven businesswoman but always a lady. All of Manhattan knew ""Mrs. Berson"" and she wore the title well. In our grandmother's world, you could never be overdressed. She was a spectacle of perfection, bedecked and bejeweled, from head to toe. Our friends called her Queen Elizabeth and they were not far off. She was known at Old Oaks for appearing at the gym in the early morning wearing white gloves and a Chanel suit in full make-up to ""run"" on the treadmill. Our grandfather worshipped her. He told us that she inspired him to be better and he adored her for that. They had a love affair like no other and their marriage was an amazing example for all of us. We all feel fortunate that our children got to spend such meaningful time with their great-grandmother whom they adored -- and that she got to share with them her stories about how she learned to fly an airplane and rode horses and owned a pet monkey who used to steal her red lipstick. She loved being the focus of their attention and they adored being in her regal presence. We all did. She was truly one of a kind and we will miss her dearly.

In searching for answers, I spoke with John Mackiel, superintendent of Omaha's public schools,where I sent my own children. He emphasized early education. It wasn't impossible for disadvantaged students to catch up later -- just a lot harder, and costlier. Looking for a program to replicate in Omaha, I found Educare, on Chicago's South Side. Inside Educare, kids facing the worst odds find, beginning at birth, a full-day, full-year oasis. Visit and you'll see highly trained teachers, down on the floor, talking, singing and inspiring. Today, 8 Educares are open across America, with 12 more in the pipeline, each supported by partnerships of local philanthropies, public schools and early-childhood providers. Educares provide a lever to improve state and federal policies: they show policy makers what ''high quality'' looks like and what investment can produce. Educare students come close to national norms by the time they reach kindergarten. That is big news, and a solid investment in human capital."

2009-09-27T00:00:00Z,"In general, I make it a habit not to come in contact with men's underwear. I guess I've heard too many frat-boy stories about what happens when guys put off doing a wash for a really long time. Since I'm single, this avoidance works out pretty well most of the time. On the off chance that I do encounter a guy's underpants, I expect that he's at least showered and worn clean ones for the occasion, and implore him to pick them up off the floor on his way out. So imagine my dismay at being confronted daily with the countless men who refuse to cover up their boxers or briefs. This mode of undress has been popular for years, and when it reached its all-time low -- buckling one's pants under the buttocks in the style of some hip-hop stars -- I thought it was finally on its way out. But no. Teenagers and 30-year-old men alike continue to stand in front of me on the subway, giving me an eyeful of their tighty-whities, which in many cases have ceased being both tight and white."

It does not even tell an employer that the graduate can put together a logical and syntactically correct argument. It serves as rough and unreliable evidence of a degree of intelligence and perseverance -- that's it. Yet across much of the job market, young people can't get their foot in the door without that magic piece of paper. As President Obama promotes community colleges, he could transform the national conversation about higher education if he acknowledges the B.A. has become meaningless. Then perhaps three reforms can begin: community colleges and their online counterparts will become places to teach and learn without any reference to the bachelor's degree; the status associated with the bachelor's degree will be lessened; and colleges will be forced to demonstrate just what their expensive four-year undergraduate programs do better, not in theory but in practice."

2009-09-27T00:00:00Z,"HOVNANIAN--Kevork S.,founder and Chairman of the Board of one of the nation's largest homebuilders, died on September 24, at age 86. Mr. Hovnanian's story began when his Christian Armenian family fled the Middle East during a revolution which saw his successful road building company nationalized. Arriving unharmed but penniless in the United States, Mr. Hovnanian put his experience to work. With his three brothers, he founded the company that eventually became Hovnanian Enterprises. While his brothers eventually left to start their own successful businesses, Hovnanian Enterprises went on to become a NYSE, Fortune 500 Company. As he realized his American Dream, Mr. Hovnanian helped hundreds of thousands of families across the country realize their dream of home ownership. His accomplishments have led to an array of honors, including Harvard University's Dively Award for Leadership in Corporate Public Initiatives because of his company's successful inner-city community in Newark, The Rutgers University ""25 top New Jersey Business leaders of the Century"", top ranking performance on Forbes Platinum list and the Fortune 500 list, the National Quality Housing Award by the National Association of Homebuilders, and the Man of the Year by the New Jersey Council for Christians and Jews as well as by the Diocese of the Armenian Church of America in recognition for his assistance to earthquake victims in Armenia. For his contributions to the American society, Mr. Kevork Hovnanian was awarded with the Ellis Island Medal of Honor in 1993. Mr. Hovnanian's philanthropic efforts include establishing the K. Hovnanian Children's Hospital at Jersey Shore University Medical Center, the Emergency Care Center at Riverview Hospital and the new Cardiology Floor at the New York Presbyterian Hospital in New York City which is currently under construction. He also generously supported Armenian causes, including the construction of St. Stepanos Armenian Church in Elberon, NJ in memory of his mother. Furthermore, he built housing for earthquake victims in Armenia, and donated a townhouse for the Armenian Mission to the United Nations in New York City. He also rebuilt the famous Gevorgian Lyceum at the Holy See Etchmiadzin which remained closed during the Soviet era. He served as Co-Chair for the Fund for Armenian Relief for almost two decades and as Honorary Chair until his death. The complete list of his American and Armenian philanthropic endeavors is vast. Mr. Hovnanian is survived by his wife of over 60 years, Sirwart (Emily), five children and 13 grandchildren. A memorial service will be held on Saturday, October 3rd at Saint Vartan Armenian Cathedral at 630 Second Avenue New York, NY tentatively scheduled at 11am. In lieu of flowers, please send donations to Fund for Armenian Relief 630 Second Avenue New York, NY 10016-4806 or Saint Stepanos Armenian Church Endowment Trust Fund 1184 Ocean Avenue Elberon, NJ 07740."

They all were within about 10 blocks of the appraisal apartment; all were in postwar high-rise doorman buildings with similar views and similar building amenities. The features of each comparable apartment were reviewed, and adjustments were made for differences between the comparable and the apartment being appraised. For example, when a comparable had an amenity that the appraisal apartment lacked --say a renovated kitchen -- a dollar amount was subtracted from the comp's sale price, to make it more similar. And when the comparable didn't have something that the appraisal did -- say it was on a lower floor -- a dollar value was added to the comparable, again to make the two places more alike."

The letters, to Byron’s close friend Francis Hodgson, are considered to be the most important series of the poet’s letters to come to market in more than 30 years. They include Byron’s comment that the Portuguese had “few vices except lies and sodomy,” and a swipe at his poet rivals Wordsworth and Robert Southey as “renegade rascals.” The letters, some of which are unpublished, were purchased in 1885 by a former prime minister, Archibald Primrose, the Earl of Rosebery, and have remained in his family. Gabriel Heaton, a Sotheby specialist in English literary and historical manuscripts, told the The Guardian of London: “Byron clearly enjoyed writing slightly outrageous things to a clergyman, but you also get a very strong sense of the depth of friendship they had.

There is something stern and almost sinister in his portrayals of everyone from Bret Easton Ellis and Patti Smith to Rick Owens and Lawrence Weiner who tend to stand resolutely on the edge of the page, staring suspiciously out of the corner of one eye. But according to Knoke, who grew up in Hanover but now shuttles between the art and fashion capitals of Paris, New York and Berlin, the portraits are really more about the artist than the subject. The Moment recently caught up with Knoke, who comes across as anything but sinister."

2009-09-28T00:00:00Z,"TOPKIS--Gladys Susman, of New York City, died August 25, 2009, of heart failure. She was 81. Born in Brookline, MA, Ms. Topkis was granted a full scholarship to Radcliffe College, from which she graduated magna cum laude in 1948. After moving to New York, she soon began making a name for herself in the field of scholarly publishing, working in the editorial departments of houses such as Praeger Publishers, Free Press, and John Wiley & Sons. In 1978, she began teaching at the University of Denver's Publishing Institute, and continued to teach there, every summer and with enormous pleasure, for the next 30 years. In 1981 she became senior editor at Yale University Press, where she specialized in books on sociology, psychology, and psychoanalysis, many of which went on to win prestigious awards. When she left Yale, in 1998, her departure was marked with a festschrift featuring original papers written for the occasion by a number of internationally prominent psychoanalysts. Though technically retired, she continued to work on a freelance basis, and also acted as the Editorial Director of Felony & Mayhem Press, a small mystery-fiction imprint. She is survived by her daughter, Maggie Topkis, of New York City; by the more than 3,000 students whom she guided towards (or away from) careers in publishing; and by the hundreds of books she edited, all of which would have been much the poorer without her. In lieu of flowers, friends and colleagues are invited to make donations in her name to the Memorial Giving department of the Metropolitan Opera. A memorial service is planned for early November.

He went back on stage in the darkness to pick up his score, The Pensacola News Journal reported on its Web site, pnj.com. He said he stepped onto what he thought was the floor of the raised pit, which can move up and down, “and there was nothing there,” the site quoted him as saying. He fell 14 feet and broke nine vertebrae and dislocated his shoulder. “All I could think was that I was falling into hell,” he told the newspaper. “I was so glad when I hit because it finally stopped.” He was taken to the hospital but is hoping to conduct further performances Thursday and Friday, The News Journal said."

When lower courts threw out that case following the misconduct of a private investigator, Slesinger’s heirs filed a copyright infringement suit against Disney. On Friday, Judge Florence-Marie Cooper ruled that Stephen Slesinger Inc. “transferred all of its rights in the Pooh works to Disney, and may not now claim infringement of any retained rights.” A Disney spokeswoman told Reuters that Stephen Slesinger Inc. still has a claim against Disney pending before U.S. patent regulators."

When I was a young reporter on the state staff of The Providence Journal, staff members were not permitted to have any interests outside the paper or to write for any other local publication. That was the 1950s. Today is another matter, on The Journal and now, apparently, on The Times as well. There is no justification for it, and to write one is a phony exercise. The results are all too plain.The newspaper industry is on its way out. Newspapers are at or near the bottom of institutions in which the public has confidence. No one believes what they read, and consequently, fewer and fewer people are buying them.David Pogue's ""expertise"" is too valuable to be missed? Nonsense. If the Times wants to run a critique of this or that electronic gadget, it ought to be The Times's own appraisal, not the opinion of an outsider.JAMES K. SUNSHINEProvidence, R.I., Sept. 6, 2009The writer is a retired deputy executive editor at The Providence Journal. ● Criticism of David Pogue is misdirected. It should be directed at The New York Times for its policy of not distinguishing between staffers and freelancers. As a former Times freelance writer and photographer, my byline appeared as Pogue's does without any indication I wasn't a staffer.For my photos, however, the credit line was different from the ones for staff photographers.Ethics is a personal thing that every journalist espouses, or should. This doesn't mean, however, that the rules a company promulgates among its employees apply automatically to freelance contributors. Conflict-of-interest rules are usually meant to protect a company from criticism, not to prevent ethical lapses. Journalists go along with them because they are a condition of employment, not because they are needed. Nobody asks a freelancer who paid for lunch, unless you ask for reimbursement.ROBERT J.
