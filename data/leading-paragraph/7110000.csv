Hsiung Sheng Hwang in 1962 and had forty four years of blissful marriage until her husband's passing in 2006. She devoted her life to family and others.

The Trustees and staff of The Metropolitan Museum of Art mourn the loss of Muriel Newman, who was a beloved Honorary Trustee and benefactor of the Museum for nearly 30 years, and whose enthusiasm for collecting, adventuresome taste, and remarkable generosity transformed the Met's collection of 20th-century art. A painter herself, and a friend in the late 1940s of artists such as Franz Kline, Willem de Kooning, Robert Motherwell, Jackson Pollock, and Mark Rothko, she was also among the first of her generation to recognize the significance of their work, forming a stunning personal collection that also included earlier modern paintings and objects from Africa, Oceania, and the ancient Americas. Although a native of Chicago, she promised her collection of modern art to the Met in 1980 and over the years donated important works to the Costume Institute and department of photographs as well. After she transferred her collection to the Museum in 2006, it was shown to great critical acclaim in a special exhibition. Muriel had the rare talent of seeing a radical new art movement around her, understanding its importance, and acquiring immediately with pitch-perfect accuracy. That talent, combined with her love of her spiritual home, New York, added depth and quality to the Museum's collection. Through Muriel's generosity, museum-goers will treasure her magnificent gifts--in the context of the entire history of art at this encyclopedic museum--for generations to come. We will miss her greatly, and extend condolences to her entire family. James R. Houghton, Chairman Philippe de Montebello, Dir. Emily K. Rafferty, President"

The cable guys were outraged because the Big Ten wanted a dollar per subscriber per month -- nearly triple the price commanded by, say, CNN or the USA Network -- and was further demanding a primo spot on extended basic, which is where everybody who starts a network wants to be. For their part, the cable companies wanted to relegate the Big Ten Network to a sports tier, where the fans who watched the games would also be the ones who pay for them. For the record, while I do not believe in a la carte cable pricing, I do think that sports should be treated as an exception: sports channels are so expensive -- ESPN alone is some $3 a month a subscriber -- that it is the single biggest reason your cable bill is so high. Putting sports channels on a sports tier makes sense, it seems to me."

For him, it wasn't a judgment call: the piece ""objectively"" belonged on page one, and by running it inside, The Times was displaying its liberal bias. After much heat, the only thing we were able to agree on was that one of the virtues of a free press is that different editors can reach different judgments on such matters. But there's a more complicated question than deciding which facts are fit to print, and where. Sometimes it's not even clear if a statement is expressing a fact (objective) or an opinion (subjective).

Bob's caring influence carried beyond his professional expertise and as one of our most recent grantees has expressed, ''...though I only knew him briefly, Maestro Bass seemed to me to be an extraordinarily lovely man, leader and musician. The way in which he indicated to me his interest and encouragement for my future career was very genuine and I felt that I had gained a real friend.'' We have no doubt that similar feelings must be shared by all of our grantees of the past two decades. The members of The Board of Directors of The Olga Forrai Foundation send their heartfelt condolences to Bob's wife, Juliana, his two children, Miranda and Jonathan and the rest of his family.

There's Addison and Steele; Dr. Johnson and Boswell; Hazlitt, Lamb and De Quincey. There's gossip and scandal, obsession and addiction, even the blurring of fiction and nonfiction. All of a high order, of course. It certainly seems as if there would be contemporary equivalents of such fare.

In a three-set rout of French journeyman Fabrice Santoro, Roddick ripped off a stunning 147-mile-per-hour ace in the first set, the fifth-fastest recorded serve of all time (the first three spots are also occupied by Roddick). Santoro, a finesse player who at age 35 is still ranked 60th in the world, appeared to grow increasingly demoralized as the match wore on. At 30-love in the last game, Roddick served a 140-mile-per-hour ace that nearly struck Santoro in the head as he bent over to protect himself. Santoro walked over to the opposite side of the baseline, gave a facetious round-of-applause for Roddick into his racket, and then pinned his racket against his thigh — giving up on match point. Roddick explained after the match that he had meant to hit the late offending serve on the ""T"" — the middle line between the service courts — but that the ball got away from him. Santoro wasn’t convinced. ""Then it was the biggest mistake of his life,"" Santoro said. ""When he goes on the T, it’s right on the T.""."

2008-08-28T00:00:00Z,"Pope Benedict XVI has condemned a sculpture of a crucified frog on display at a museum in Bolzano, Italy, the Italian news agency ANSA reported. Franz Pahl, an official from the Trentino-Alto Adige region in northern Italy, said the pope had written to him to complain about the frog, which was installed in May at Museion, the modern-art museum in Bolzano. In a letter dated Aug. 7, Pope Benedict said that the sculpture ''injured the religious feeling of many people who see in the Cross the symbol of the love of God and of our salvation, which deserves recognition and religious devotion.'' The work, by the German artist Martin Kippenberger, who died in 1997, depicts a frog nailed to a cross with a mug of beer in one hand and an egg in the other. According to ANSA, the museum's curators contend that the work is a self-portrait of the artist ''in a state of profound crisis'' and is not an attack on religion. While they have moved the sculpture away from the museum entrance, they refuse to remove it. Members of the provincial government, who form a majority on the museum's board, said they would ask for the work to be taken down when they meet with museum officials on Thursday."

2008-08-28T00:00:00Z,"SIDNAM--Alan Northcote, longtime Manhattan resident, former advertising executive of Benton & Bowies and Ogilvy & Mather and venture capitalist, died on August 26th at Edgehill Nursing Home in Stamford, CT, at the age of 92. Alan grew up in Kalamazoo, MI, graduating from Kalamazoo College in 1937. He was a member of the Upjohn family of Upjohn Pharmaceuticals. A fighter pilot in WWII, Alan was stationed at Biak in the South Pacific where he flew P-38s with the 475th Fighter Group. Alan once flew as Charles Lindberg's wingman (Tail-end-Charlie). At that time Lindberg was visiting the 475th and, although not trained as a military pilot, was allowed to participate in several combat missions. In a separate incident, Alan crashed into the Pacific testing a P-38 that malfunctioned and suffered burns in the resulting fire. He was rescued hours later by a passing ship and credited his ''Mae West'' with saving his life. Alan moved to Manhattan in 1938. During his tenure as Vice Chairman at Benton & Bowles, his main client was Proctor & Gamble. In the late 1940s and 1950s, the early days of television, P&G was a major advertiser and sponsored the Loretta Young Show. Alan played the dual role of satisfying the needs of both P&G and the show's star, Loretta Young. For the Tide account, Alan's suggestion of the tag line ''when Tide comes in, dirt goes out'' was adopted as ''Tide's in, dirt's out'' and ran for many years, a monumental success. When, in 1962, Alan was asked by David Ogilvy to be a Vice Chairman of Ogilvy & Mather, he took on the management of the General Foods account and acted as Management Supervisor for the Mercedes Benz account. After five successful full-time years at O&M, he transitioned to part-time consultancy to the agency and entered the world of venture capital. As a venture capitalist Alan both raised money for and invested in many existing companies and start-up businesses. He was on the board of Kelley Oil & Gas, an exploration company based in Houston, TX. With his friend, James Gamble Rogers, he was an original board member and investor in Lindblad Travel, one of the first companies to offer exotic expeditions to venues like Antarctica and the Galapagos. Alan was a principal investor and prime mover in V-Band Corporation, which developed specialty telecommunica tions equipment for use in stock and bond trading. Another project of his was National Demographics and Lifestyles, which developed a detailed database of buyers based on known buying habits for use by direct marketing companies. He was involved with Evelyn Wood Reading Dynamics, the world famous speed-reading program. Then-President Jimmy Carter's decision to give Evelyn Wood courses in the White House helped to give a quick lift to this business. Alan assisted with Norman Cousins' purchase of the Saturday Review, saving it from bankruptcy and restoring Cousins to Editor-in-Chief. He also worked with Louis Marx, Jr., at his innovative company, All American Sports, which operated tennis camps, taking advantage of the available off-season facilities at colleges, prep schools and resorts. From 1964 until his death, Alan was a member of the University Club in New York. Although he resigned from the University Club Council at the time of their refusal to admit female members, he continued as a life-long member. He was a member and past President of the Waccabuc Country Club, which he joined in 1956. He had many friends whom he loved and who loved him. He is survived by his wife of 35 years, Gloria Wells Sidnam of NYC and Bedford NY, a daughter, Caroline (Coty) Northcote Sidnam, two grandchildren, Emma Pucci of Boulder, CO and Samuel Pucci of NYC, and three stepchildren, Pamela Thye of Greenwich, CT, Robert Meeker of Tar Heel, NC and Greg Ercolano of Pasadena, CA. His sister Jane Heath is presently living in a nursing home in Kalamazoo, MI. A memorial will be held at the University Club, 1 West 54th Street, on Friday, October 10th, 2008 from 2-5pm."

2008-08-28T00:00:00Z,"In her speech Tuesday night at the Democratic National Convention, Senator Hillary Rodham Clinton quoted the abolitionist Harriet Tubman as offering this advice: ''If you hear the dogs, keep going. If you see the torches in the woods, keep going. If there's shouting after you, keep going. Don't ever stop. Keep going. If you want a taste of freedom, keep going.'' But in interviews on Wednesday, two scholars say there is no evidence that Tubman, right, the organizer of the Underground Railroad, who died in Auburn, N.Y., in 1913, ever said those words. Instead, the passage appears to be a paraphrase of -- and perhaps an embellishment upon -- a popular expression that has been attributed to Tubman for decades, possibly starting with children's books in the mid-20th century."

2008-08-29T00:00:00Z,"YOUNG--Robert Winthrop Jr . Developed Ajax, Baggies, and Palmolive. Robert Winthrop Young, Jr., 85, the marketing expert who developed the House of Ajax ad its widely successful advertising campaign (the White Knight and the White Tornado), died August 26 after a long battle with cancer. Mr. Young was raised in Greenwich, CT and graduated from the St. Paul's School, Harvard College and Harvard Business School. A veteran of WWII, he joined the army his first year at Harvard. He attended Officer Candidate School in New Orleans, and was stationed in Alaska, where he served as a first lieutenant. Mr. Young was considered one of the leading experts in the development and marketing of new products. An executive with the Colgate-Palmolive company from 1959-1969 (General Manager, Household Product Division; Vice-President and Corporate Director of Marketing-Worldwide), he created a domestic new products development program, and similar programs worldwide. Under his innovative direction, Colgate developed a number of enduring successful product lines, including Ajax, Baggies, Palmolive and Fab. Mr. Young began his career with the Procter & Gamble Company, and then entered the field of advertising. In 1953, as an entrepreneur, and with his brother Andrew Plimpton Young (deceased), he started Golden Gift, Inc., the first company to market orange juice in cartons. The company was sold profitably in 1956 as the product form grew into a significant industry. Mr. Young then served as Vice-President of Kenyon & Eckhardt Advertising, where he supervised such diverse accounts as Lever Bros., Chase Bank, McKesson & Robbins, and Beecham Ltd. His corporate endeavors also reflected an altruistic and expansive approach to product development and marketing. While at Colgate he used the concept of ''inventing backward'' to invent a hand - operated washing machine for women living without electricity in underdeveloped areas of the world. His long-time collaborator Richard Walton created the machine itself, the ''Walton Washer,'' which was manufactured by Colgate in Mexico and sold for less than $10 throughout Central and South America. He resigned from Colgate in 1969 to pursue a solo career as a marketing and consultant and President of his own company, The Young Group, Inc. He continued to collaborate with Richard Walton on a diverse array of inventions, including a process to substantially decrease the tar inhaled when smoking cigarettes and a plush toy that plays the sound of a beating heart to soothe newborns. His creativity was not confined to the business world and new product development. He enjoyed a lifelong love of singing and performing, beginning as a boy soprano soloist in Greenwich, CT. He went on to sing with the Westminster Choir, in his own radio show as a First Lieutenant in the Army during World War II, as a member of the Hasty Pudding Club at Harvard (performing on stage with Jack Lemmon), then in Gilbert & Sullivan shows produced by the New York based Blue Hill Troupe, of which he became President. One of his favorite shows was the HMS Pinafore, in which he played the leading role. Later in life, after moving to Virginia, he sang baritone with the choir at Trinity Episcopal Church in Upperville, and performed in the two-character play Love Letters. Mr. Young also wrote short stories, poetry, and song lyrics. In his late 70s and early 80s he wrote the book and lyrics, and composer David Oliver wrote the music, for the show ''About Face.'' The show was performed by the Middleburg Players in Middleburg, Virginia, under the guidance of their founder Jean Gold. He was a graduate of the St. Paul's School and of Harvard (1945), where he served as an Editor of the National Lampoon. He was also a member of many clubs throughout his life, including the A.D. Club and Hasty Pudding Club at Harvard, the Racquet and Tennis Club (NYC), the Leash (NYC), the Chatham Yacht Club (Cape Cod, MA), the Piping Rock Country Club (Locust Valley, NY), the Shinnecock Golf Club (South Hampton, NY) and the Army-Navy Club (Washington, DC). He is survived by his wife of 37 years, Margot Airey Young, daughters Marie Bates of Greenwich, CT, Ellen Enns of Seattle, WA and Tracy Wells of Madison, NJ, step-daughter Honore Ryan and stepson Colvin Gregg Ryan, nephew Andrew Young, six grandchildren, two greatgrandchildren, and two grandnieces. In lieu of flowers, please make donations in his name to: Blue Ridge Hospice 333 West Cork Street, Winchester, VA 22601."

2008-08-31T00:00:00Z,"WEYMOUTH--Katharine Lewars (duPont), 87, passed away peacefully on Friday August 22, 2008 at her summer home on Fishers Island, NY. She was born in 1921 in Philadelphia, PA and was the daughter of the late Katharine Price Lewars and the late Thomas Belfield Lewars. She attended the Shipley School in Bryn Mawr, PA and Lower Merion High School in Ardmore, PA. She graduated from Wheelock College in Boston where she served on their Board of Trustees. Katharine was the widow of State Senator Reynolds duPont of Greenville, DE and Fishers Island, NY and also the widow of George T. Weymouth of Greenville, DE and Boca Grande, FL. Katharine is survived by a wonderfully large family which includes her daughter, Katharine duPont Sanger; son Reynolds duPont, Jr.; son Thomas Lewars duPont and his wife, Ruth; daughter Natalie duPont Lyon and her husband, Frank R. Lyon, Jr.; and son Michael Belfield duPont. Surviving her are a long list of grandchildren including Penn duPont Sanger and his wife, Jennifer; Christopher Durant Sanger and his wife, Nina; Heidi Anne duPont; Reynolds duPont III and his wife, Elizabeth; Jameson Coffey duPont; Jessica duPont Thiel and her husband Eric; Molly Becker duPont and her husband, Trevor Schaffer; Sarah duPont Hendriksen and her husband Edwin; Katharine Lyon Jackson and her husband, Matthew; Brianne Lyon Jarvis and her husband, Benjamin; Kyley Wallace Lyon, Michael Belfield duPont Jr.; Edward Reynolds duPont and Bennett Lammot duPont. Greatgrandchildren include Peter and Cassie Sanger, Eleanor duPont, Tommy, Tyler and Greta Thiel, Teddy and Wilson Schaffer, Sophie and William Hendriksen, Stephen and Connor Jackson and Mason Jarvis. Katharine is also survived by Patricia Weymouth Hobbs, George A. ''Frolic'' Weymouth and Eugene E. Weymouth and their many children and grandchildren. Katharine was predeceased by her brother Thomas Belfield Lewars Jr. and her twin sister Margaret Lewars Ogden. She is survived also by several nieces and nephews and Godchildren to whom she was most deeply devoted. Katharine was predeceased by an infant grandson, Frank R. Lyon IV and a granddaughter, Emily A. duPont. She was also pre-deceased by her son-in-law, Peter Durant Sanger. Katharine's involvement in a myriad of organizations in Wilmington, Boca Grande and Fishers Island left an indelible imprint. Her volunteer service to cultural, medical, historical and educational boards spanned many decades and her roles as both a leader and mentor will long be remembered. Her greatest legacy will remain that of her family. Katharine's generosity and grace, engaging smile and love won her the love and respect of people of many generations. Her gifts of a wonderful sense of humor, undying love of family and loyalty to friends and her willingness to help others will serve as reminders of her wonderful spirit. The family is most grateful to the many years of companionship and friendship offered to her by Kathleen Rupprecht and the compassionate care given to her especially by Josephine Flinn and Ann Egerton over the past two years as well that of many other caregivers in particular East End Hospice of Westhampton Beach, Long Island. A memorial service will be held on Thursday, August 28, 2008 at St. John's Church, Fishers Island, NY. Interment will be private. A memorial service will also be held in Wilmington, DE at 11am on Friday, September 12, 2008 at Christ Church Christiana Hundred, Greenville, DE.

2008-08-31T00:00:00Z,"It would be hard to find a team more stunned by a loss than the DALLAS COWBOYS were when they fell to the Giants in the playoffs last season after having secured the N.F.C.'s top seed. The Cowboys are loaded again, so home-field advantage is again in the offing for the best offense in the N.F.C. But going 11 consecutive seasons without a playoff win stings. If that doesn't spur on the Cowboys to a deep playoff run, nothing will. The offense added running back Felix Jones in the draft, and his shiftiness could be a perfect complement to Marion Barber III's power. And if Adam Jones -- formerly Pacman -- can stay on the field, and if the rookie cornerback Michael Jenkins is a hit immediately, the secondary, the only weakness on the defense, should be solved. For good measure, the Cowboys added the veteran linebacker Zach Thomas, who is expected to provide leadership in a locker room full of young guns. In the end, though, the Cowboys' season may come down to Tony Romo. Bill Parcells used to warn him not to become a celebrity quarterback, but with Jessica Simpson hanging around, that's unavoidable. No more trips to Mexico during the bye week, Tony. Buckle down, and Dallas is the favorite to be in the Super Bowl. No Super Bowl champion has ever flown further under the radar than the GIANTS. They had a relatively peaceful training camp that even Plaxico Burress couldn't disrupt with his foot/contract issues. When Brett Favre blew into town to join the Jets, the Giants receded further from the spotlight. Things were going swimmingly until the Pro Bowl defensive end Osi Umenyiora, the Giants' best pass rusher, sustained a season-ending knee injury. The Giants are stocked with pass rushers, but this was a big loss. With Michael Strahan retired and Umenyiora hurt, the team that used its pass rush as a bludgeon on the Patriots in the Super Bowl has gone from a future Hall of Famer and a Pro Bowl player at the ends to having one player who played linebacker last season and another who started only twice. Jeremy Shockey is also gone, and while that removes some of the thrill from the offense, it also removes a lot of headaches from everywhere else. The real question is whether Eli Manning will return as the clutch playoff performer or the inconsistent quarterback of the regular season. If he truly turned the corner in January, the Giants will be a force for years. The defense will still be solid without Umenyiora, and the Giants' offense has loads of young talent, especially if the receivers can regain their health. If Manning's inconsistency returns, the Giants will be in a wild-card fight, because their division is as tough as ever. No matter. Repeating as Super Bowl champs is tough, especially with your best player on injured reserve, but would anyone rule them out after last season?"

Widely known in the investment community for his company's authoritative reports on the petroleum industry, died at Connecticut Hospice on August 23, 2008 at age 96. He was a resident of New Canaan, CT for 49 years, recently moving to North Branford. He, with his wife of 72 years, the former Peggy Schusser of Greenwich, enjoyed a long and varied career. Graduating from the Sheffield Scientific School of Yale University in 1936, he and Peggy moved to the southwestern U.S. where he worked as an explorative geologist for a number of oil companies. His work there was terminated in July 1941 when he was ordered to active duty as an Ensign in the U.S. Navy. Assigned to the U.S.S. William P. Biddle, an amphibious troop transport, he participated in seven amphibious assault operations in the European and Pacific theaters. In late 1944 he returned to the U.S. to commission and assumed command, as a lieutenant commander, of the U.S.S. Waukesha, a 14,000 ton amphibious assault ship. Following various independent operations in the far Pacific, Waukesha joined Task Force 31 to land the first allied seaborne troops on the Japanese homeland on August 30, 1945, followed by occupation of atom-bombed Nagasaki in September. As a civilian John resumed his work as a geologist. In 1948 he organized John S. Herold, Inc., specializing in the preparation and publication of appraisal reports on petroleum companies. He retired in 1984 when he sold his business to Arthur Smith of Houston, TX. He is survived by his wife, Peggy, his children, Susan, John and wife Julie, grandson Christopher and wife Nicole, greatgranddaughters Sadie and Delilah. Sons Robert and David predeceased him. A celebration of John's life will take place at a later time.

2008-08-31T00:00:00Z,"Paging Peyton Manning. The quarterback was barely seen during the INDIANAPOLIS COLTS' training camp, after having an infected bursa sac removed from his left knee in July. The cloak of secrecy fueled speculation that Manning could be unavailable -- or at least not as good as usual -- when the season starts and that the Colts could slip out of the league's upper echelon. Don't count on it. It's hard to imagine Manning, who has never missed a start, missing the first one in the Colts' new stadium. And a less-than-perfect Manning is still better than most quarterbacks. The Colts are still one of the most loaded, balanced teams in the N.F.L. If receiver Marvin Harrison is back to form after the knee injury that short-circuited most of last season, and defensive end Dwight Freeney comes back from the foot injury that ended his year, the Colts will again battle the Patriots for supremacy in the A.F.C. Incredibly bad health doomed the Colts last season, but this was the only division in the N.F.L. that had three teams with 10 or more victories. As Jacksonville, Tennessee and even Houston close in, the Colts -- and whoever else makes it to the playoffs -- will get beaten up more and more in the division, endangering their chances for a top playoff seed. The JACKSONVILLE JAGUARS were the hottest team entering the playoffs last season, but their loss to the Patriots reflected their biggest problem: no pass rush. They need it to beat Tom Brady, but first they have to get past Manning to secure a home-field postseason game. That was why they went after two of the draft's best rushers: Derrick Harvey and Quentin Groves. It's always dicey to rely on rookies, but just as important may be how well the new receivers Jerry Porter, who is returning from an off-season hamstring injury, and Troy Williamson get up to speed with quarterback David Garrard. This was the first time Garrard had an entire off-season to prepare as the starter -- he was superb last year after winning the job in training camp -- and if the passing game can meld with a superb running attack, the Jaguars may make a deep playoff run."

''We were thinking about going to Israel for some years, mainly to show our kids our roots. We're a Jewish family. On my side I'm a son of Egyptians that left Egypt in 1957 and came to Brazil. My wife is the granddaughter of people who left Poland. It's a strong sensation to be part of the large and diverse community praying at the wall: some people talking in Russian, in English, in French, people from all over the world coming and praying and hoping for many things. We even met some Brazilians there that we know. It's a very special place. I would say, yes, Michel understood what he had been learning for so many years in Brazil, about the wall, the history and why we pray in front of it. I have two more kids not in the picture: Raiana, who is 12, and Yuri, who is 15. They study Hebrew and Jewish culture in Brazil, and now they have a real sense of what Israel is like. I think that they saw the contrast that Israel has: Tel Aviv to Jerusalem to Masada. Everyone would like to go back soon. It was not just the history, not just the religion. We had a lot of fun.''

2008-08-31T00:00:00Z,"How much of a buzz is there around the MINNESOTA VIKINGS? It's the only team Brett Favre really wanted to play for this year. They didn't land Favre, but when they got defensive end Jared Allen in a trade from the Chiefs, the Vikings instantly became a chic pick to contend. Allen balances a defense that was solid against the run but suspect against the pass. The unit suffered a blow when safety Madieu Williams injured his neck; he could miss almost a month of the regular season. Much of the overall optimism, though, stems from running back Adrian Peterson's breathtaking rookie year, and the acquisition of receiver Bernard Berrian. Still, with all the other parts in place, the Vikings' chances will come down to how well Tarvaris Jackson runs the offense. There is little question Favre would have been an upgrade, but Coach Brad Childress has professed his allegiance to Jackson. If Jackson gets more consistent, the high hopes are justified. One reason the Vikings are considered the top pick in this division is because nobody knows what to expect from the GREEN BAY PACKERS. The defense has looked good in the preseason, but the offense has been suspect. It's impossible to predict how quarterback Aaron Rodgers, perhaps the most unenvied man in the N.F.L. right now, will handle life as Favre's replacement. It won't be easy. The Packers host the Vikings on the opening Monday night of the season, an early litmus test that could prove troublesome if Rodgers doesn't play well. Last year's result -- the Packers nearly won the N.F.C. championship game -- was such a bolt out of the blue that expectations were raised exponentially, until Favre left town. Now the Packers are a great unknown: in an eminently winnable division, but with the biggest question mark in football. No team has gone through a weirder off-season than this one, and how they emerge from the Favre drama will say a lot about the Packers' mental toughness."

2008-08-31T00:00:00Z,"The PITTSBURGH STEELERS will always be built around their defense -- it was ranked No. 1 last season -- but this may be the year quarterback Ben Roethlisberger joins Tom Brady and Peyton Manning as the elite at the position. He performed well in spring practices and in training camp, and Santonio Holmes provides a maturing deep threat. The Steelers remain in the top echelon of the A.F.C., and they would seem a lock to make the playoffs, but winning the division could be a struggle against Cleveland. The Steelers and the Browns each went 10-6 last season, but the Steelers went to the playoffs because they beat the Browns twice. The Steelers, who lost the Pro Bowl guard Alan Faneca to the Jets, have a brutal schedule this year, the toughest in the N.F.L. In the first five weeks, they play at Cleveland, at Philadelphia and at Jacksonville. Later, they play the Giants, Colts, Chargers, Patriots and Cowboys -- all playoff teams last season. If the Steelers make the playoffs, they will have earned it. Derek Anderson -- premier quarterback or one-season wonder? If it's the former, the CLEVELAND BROWNS will be a formidable A.F.C. team for quite a few years. This is Anderson's first year as the designated starter -- Charlie Frye started the opener last year, before being quickly replaced by Anderson and then traded -- and a full off-season of preparation should allow him to flourish in the Browns' downfield passing offense. Cleveland signed Donte' Stallworth to be a downfield threat and to take some of the heat off Braylon Edwards. If the Browns can stay healthy, it's hard to imagine them missing the playoffs again, even in a crowded A.F.C. field. But the Steelers have beaten the Browns nine consecutive times, and the Browns cannot go anywhere until they get over that obstacle. They open against the Cowboys and the Steelers, so they should know early if this is their breakthrough year."

2008-08-31T00:00:00Z,"Once the most competitive division in football, the A.F.C. West has devolved into the SAN DIEGO CHARGERS and everybody else. The Chargers aren't just ahead of the Broncos, the Chiefs and the Raiders, though. They are ahead of almost every other A.F.C. team. This season, they may finally be in position to give New England a run for the conference championship, even if they end up losing the superb pass rusher Shawne Merriman to a knee injury. The Chargers lost to the Patriots in the playoffs last season with running back LaDainian Tomlinson out for most of the game, and with quarterback Philip Rivers gamely playing on a badly injured knee. The Chargers still have one of the most talented and balanced rosters in the N.F.L., but their safety net behind Tomlinson, Michael Turner, left for Altanta. Tomlinson, the game's best runner, enters his eighth season, which means he is probably at the peak of his career. The defense is fantastic, and the offense is multidimensional. Rivers has the respect of his teammates after fighting through the injured knee last season and becoming a team leader. The Chargers should run away with the division, and they could pile up enough victories to beat out the Patriots for home-field advantage. But anything less than a Super Bowl berth with this much talent will be a letdown, and it will raise questions about whether the window is beginning to close on this group. The DENVER BRONCOS are second in this division, which isn't saying much. They dismantled the coaching staff after a losing season, but when receiver Brandon Marshall sustained a serious arm injury in March while wrestling with a family member you had to wonder if the Broncos were doomed. (Marshall will miss one game after being suspended for violating the league's player conduct policy.) The offensive line is in transition, which is a problem for a team that has always had a superb running attack. The defense was a mess last year, too. The good news is that quarterback Jay Cutler is the real thing. The bad news is that there wasn't enough of an overhaul in personnel to make a big difference this season, not when the Broncos were outscored last year by the Chargers, 64-6. A finish above .500 is certainly possible, especially because four of the first six games are at home. The Broncos will need a few breaks to get to 10 wins, which will probably be the minimum for a playoff berth in the A.F.C."

2008-08-31T00:00:00Z,"The NEW ORLEANS SAINTS' active off-season make them the division favorites. Drew Brees likes to throw to tight ends, and now he has Jeremy Shockey, who is still dangerous when healthy. The Saints' offense should be explosive, especially if Reggie Bush finally gets somewhere close to the expectations for him. And the defense, which was woeful last year with just 10 interceptions, was shored up by acquiring linebacker Jonathan Vilma, who was miscast by the Jets; signing cornerback Randall Gay; and drafting defensive tackle Sedrick Ellis. Their biggest problem last season was an 0-4 start, which put them in a hole they never escaped. This year's schedule doesn't help much: The Saints host the international game in London, giving them nine trips -- and that game is against San Diego. The Saints clearly have the best offense in the division, and if the defense comes together, they could make a run to the conference championship. Coach Jon Gruden tried to sweet-talk Brett Favre into coming south, mindful that Favre might have been enough to put the TAMPA BAY BUCCANEERS in the N.F.C.'s top tier. They didn't get him, and that leaves the Buccaneers a bit short. Their defense is still top notch, and the addition of the rookie cornerback Aqib Talib won't hurt. But the offense could apply for the senior discount en masse. Quarterback Jeff Garcia performed well last year, and the offense ranked 18th, better than it had been since 2003. But running back Warrick Dunn isn't what he was in his younger days, and receiver Joey Galloway is relatively ancient and missed most of camp with a groin injury. If Galloway gets hurt, the Buccaneers have little punch, as the Giants discovered in the playoffs last season. It's the same as it ever was in Tampa: win with defense or don't win at all."

2008-08-31T00:00:00Z,"For the SEATTLE SEAHAWKS, this season will be the Mike Holmgren farewell tour, and the only fitting conclusion to such a great career would be another playoff run. The Seahawks have won four straight division titles, and they are the class of the division again. But in an attempt to get Holmgren a grand finale before he retires, the Seahawks overhauled their running game, signing Julius Jones and T. J. Duckett, acquiring left guard Mike Wahle and hiring a new offensive line coach, Mike Solari. (Has anyone ever dropped from most valuable player to invisible faster than Shaun Alexander last year?) The defense is the strength of the team, though, and the Seahawks will ride that to another division title. That means another home playoff game at Qwest Field, the hardest place for a visitor to win. Don't bet against a deep playoff push for the Seahawks. The ARIZONA CARDINALS lost six games by a touchdown or less last season, which usually suggests that a young, mistake-prone team still has to get its act together. That is why Coach Ken Whisenhunt was not happy to see photos of the supposed franchise quarterback Matt Leinart with a beer bong in hand during the off-season. Things didn't get much better for Leinart once training camp started. He played so poorly that Kurt Warner will start in Week 1. With a receiver tandem as good as any in football with Anquan Boldin and Larry Fitzgerald, the Cardinals should have an explosive offense no matter who the quarterback is. But the receivers must stay healthy, and Boldin, who has demanded a trade, needs to perform despite his publicly stated anger over his contract. The schedule is tough; the Cardinals open at San Francisco, against whom they played poorly last season, and face the Redskins, Jets and Cowboys in the first six weeks. Later there are games against the Giants, Eagles, Vikings and Patriots. It's hard to imagine the Cardinals overtaking the Seahawks this season, but a schedule like that will give a young team plenty of experience to build on."

It was clear that this was a deeply, deeply held personal vigil and it was tough to discern what good it could possible do given that the people who were leaving were all bent on nominating John McCain later in the week. And then Dr. Jim Taylor, a delegate from the convention from Pinehurst, N.C., came over to the fence and began chatting with Mr. Westgate in between his yelps on behalf of Mr. Paul.

To her family we express our sympathy. May beautiful memory bring comfort to all who mourn her passing. Rabbi David M. Posner Marcia Waxman, President Robert A. Calinoff, Secretary LOVE--Lee Morse, a pioneer in reporting on United Nations efforts to ensure the peaceful uses of outer space for over 40 years, passed away Sunday August 31. She wrote about the United Nations Committee on the Peaceful Uses of Outer Space from its early days, and her personal relations were so close with committee members that during the Cold War years she was one of the very few people who was able to entertain delegates from both the United Sates and the former Soviet Union at the same occasion. By the time she left the U.N., only a few months prior to her illness, Lee had covered man's flights into space and the moon and reported on arguments over who owned the rights to outer space, seas and satellites orbits. She attended the annual International Aeronautical Congress all over the world and was elected to membership in the International Institute of Space Law in recognition of her work in the area of space law and policy. Lee was also hired by the United States Agency for International Development to go to places like Truk in Micronesia, to see if and how satellites could help its many islands to better communicate. Her generosity and warmth were eclipsed only by her beauty. A former model and actress, she studied at the Pasadena Playhouse in California. She grew up in Los Angeles, moved to New York and opened her heart and home to the world. In a world of givers and takers, she was a giver with no boundaries. Lee's love and devotion to the United Nations and its diplomatic concepts brought people together from all over the world regardless of race, religion or political beliefs. With her boundless energy, Lee touched and brought joy to so many people. She will be missed by all her family, friends and anyone fortunate to have been in her company. ''Lee Lee'', as she was known, by those closest to her, leaves behind her loving husband of sixty years, Matthew; her children, Wendy Barnard and Gregory Love and his fiance Nipa; and her grandchildren, Lance, Alessandra, Samantha and Anouchka and many loving nephews and nieces. The family would like to thank her loving caregivers, Alicia and Adja for their companionship and compassion in her final days. One of Lee Lee's favorite expressions was: Age is a number and mine is unlisted, and it will remain so as per her wishes. New York services will be held on Wednesday, 10:30am at Plaza Jewish Community Chapel, Amsterdam and 91st, Manhattan. Funeral Services will be held on Friday at 2pm at Hillside Memorial Park in Los Angeles, 6001 W Centinela Ave., where she will rejoin her mother, father, and loving sister Florence. In lieu of flowers, donations can be made to the Lee and Matthew Love Foundation (a charitable foundation) (860 UN Plaza Apt. 23A, NYC, NY 10017) for the funding of the Lee Love Award for members of the winning team at the International Institute of Space Laws annual Moot Court Competition."

2008-09-03T00:00:00Z,"A front-page article on Sunday reported that a legal dispute might prevent a $10 million-plus racing yacht built for Lawrence J. Ellison, chief of the Oracle Corporation, from participating in the next America's Cup, but the details of the legal dispute were deleted during the editing process. Lawyers for the Golden Gate Yacht Club, for which Mr. Ellison's team races, have argued that the rules that govern the next race, which will exclude his trimaran, unfairly handicap challengers. The terms, which require 90-foot keel yachts, were negotiated last year for all competitors by the club behind the team of Ernesto Bertarelli, the defending cup winner, and the Spanish yacht club that officially challenged him. Lawyers for Golden Gate also argued that it, not the Spanish yacht club, should have been the official challenger with the right to negotiate terms of the next race, and that the Spanish club was not qualified to challenge for the cup. A trial court judge agreed with those arguments, prompting Mr. Ellison's team to start building the three-hulled yacht. An appeals court reversed the decision, however, and reinstated the Spanish club as challenger, effectively blocking Mr. Ellison's trimaran."

But as you make your prediction on which two teams will be there, consider the Super Bowl-winning coaches from this decade: Tom Coughlin, Bill Belichick, Bill Cowher and Tony Dungy are all defensive minds. And even the ”offensive geniuses” who won it, Brian Billick and Jon Gruden, did so by riding two of the most menacing defensive units of recent vintage: the 2000 Baltimore Ravens and the 2002 Tampa Bay Buccaneers, respectively. We all know the latter also owed a debt to Dungy, Gruden’s predecessor in Tampa. It’s not that offensive minds have completely failed. Joe Gibbs, Norv Turner and Mike McCarthy all led their teams deep into the playoffs last season. But the difference between a good team and a championship team is the difference between the lightning bug and the lightning. So why can’t offensive coaches get over the Super Hump?."

That was about 13 million more than those who last week watched her Democratic counterpart, Senator Joseph R. Biden Jr., and, most remarkably, was just shy of the 38.4 million who saw Senator Barack Obama's speech from Invesco Field. In a further measure of the curiosity about Ms. Palin, her near-match of Mr. Obama's record-setting viewership for a convention was achieved even though her speech was carried live on just six cable and broadcast networks, compared with 10 for Mr. Obama's speech."

2008-09-05T00:00:00Z,"The words that speakers use at the two political conventions show the themes that the parties have highlighted. Republican speakers have talked about reform and character far more frequently than the Democrats. And Republicans were more likely to talk about businesses and taxes, while Democrats were more likely to mention jobs or the economy. Unlike in 2004, this year the Republicans mentioned the opposing candidate less frequently than the Democrats, mentioning Senator Barack Obama about a third as often as the Democrats mentioned Senator John McCain. The Democrats also pushed a couple catch phrases of the Obama campaign in their speeches: the need for ''change'' and that the country doesn't need ''four more years'' of a Republican administration. And the nomination of Gov. Sarah Palin of Alaska as the Republican vice-presidential candidate brought a new term into the convention vocabulary, ''hockey mom,'' which popped up in several speeches."

Perhaps one day, after the last of the die-hards had moved away and the town's abandoned wooden houses had been ground to dust, the surrounding thick forests would have simply swallowed up Omori. But after intense lobbying by Japan, the Iwami Silver Mine here, which many Japanese had never heard of, was improbably named a Unesco World Heritage site last year.

John Glennon, the Tennessean writer, then adds ""But Daly was angry that the IIHF didn't take a stronger stance against the KHL,"" and he goes on to quote from Daly's email referenced below.UPDATE 8:08 PM - In an email to Ken Campbell of The Hockey News, Daly sounded even more supportive of arbitration, but skeptical it would ever come to pass, saying, ""We're happy to submit the Radulov matter to binding arbitration, but I sincerely doubt we would ever get the agreement of the KHL or Ufa to do so.

He was in “Hughie” by Eugene O’Neill and also appeared in “Krapp’s Last Tape” by Samuel Beckett; he did not appear in any plays by Shaw."

Obama should study America&#8217;s Gilded Age, and the difficult times that followed, to see why it is important for government to regulate business and provide necessary support for workers. The titans of industry have disproportionate power that must be held in check by government to make our economic system work for everyone."

Daria Dazzan, an Italian-born 24-year-old former student at Antwerp’s Royal Academy of Fine Arts, and her boyfriend, the product designer Matteo Cibic, unveiled their clothing line with the sly moniker at the spring Milan Furniture Fair. (Why they avoided fashion week is a long, unfathomable story.) Having moved most of their production to Vicenza, the headquarters of Italian houses like Bottega Veneta, they wished to design something honoring the classic tailoring traditions of the area, but with a twist. The result is a single trouser style and matching suspenders reproduced in seemingly endless colors and linings. The fabrics, including everything from fine Italian wool to denim, are off cuts from neighboring ateliers; they are used only once, so no two pairs are alike. The cut is slim and low-rise, with a slightly tapered leg, and the suspenders fasten in the back via small buttons of corozo nut. “They’re very elegant trousers to wear to a party,” Cibic says, “or to work as a mechanic.” [?][?][?]JILL SINGER."

Every spring, the reinstallation of “Puppy” requires 10 men to labor for 12 days. Somehow “Puppy” seems emblematic of Brant’s lifetime engagement as a collector.

Knize, a haberdasher that has been in business since 1858, greatly influenced Helmut Lang’s streamlined silhouettes; when Lang was a professor at the University of Applied Arts Vienna, he would take his students there to acquaint them with the art of tailoring. Lang eventually hired Bernhard Niedersuesz, the owner’s son, to work with him in New York. Now Niedersuesz has opened his own Viennese atelier: his signature, a narrow three-button suit with double vents, soft shoulders and a high waistline, has found a strong fan base in Eastern Europe. It makes sense, then, that Niedersuesz is planning to open a shop in Moscow. That doesn’t mean he has no interest in America: a New York outpost is also in the works, and he says his dream assignment would be to make a loden suit for Arnold Schwarzenegger.

At his debut three years ago at the Hyères International Fashion and Photography Festival, one judge, the retailer Maria Luisa Poumaillou, invented a prize on the spot so that Kremer’s work, including a printed anorak of André Leon Talleyish proportions, wouldn’t go unheralded. Though Kremer’s suits, knits and outerwear have grown up since then, he doesn’t shy away from challenging pieces: for fall, he offers extravagant outfits in retina-searing hues. He finds constant inspiration from Tecktonik dance — picture amped-up voguing with a dash of pop-lock — as performed by white working-class youths from Parisian suburbs. “The first time I saw these kids dancing in eyeliner and fluoro, I had a shock like I’ve never had before,” says the 26-year-old Kremer, who had a group of boys perform at his fashion show after-party. “The only shame is that at least for now, they can’t afford my line.” At Seven New York.

At Prada’s spring 2009 show, I was apparently viewing sweet and gentle exposure, with blouson jackets hanging from lean straps on bared shoulders and scoop-neck sweaters that fixed my eyes on the Adam’s apple. Then I looked down at the feet. Normal shoes — except for a fetish strap across the instep.

Born November 11, 1927 in New York City to the late Charles George Muller and Georgia Lydia Stanbrough, she grew up and lived most of her life in Greenwich, CT. She began her publishing career at Time, Inc. From 1952 to 1961 Barbara worked at National Broadcasting Company (NBC) in New York as a producer in news and public affairs and as an assistant to legendary Frank McGee. In 1962 she married the late Peter Ornstein. They moved to Greenwich into a 200-year-old farmhouse. In 1975 she became the editor-in-chief of the Friends of Greenwich Library Oral History Project, a job she held until 2003. She also chaired the Greenwich Fresh Air Fund and was a board member for the Greenwich Library. Barbara was a devoted genealogist as befits a 10th generation decedent of Mayflower settlers. She was related to George Washington and Alexander Hamilton. She was an avid sailor and an enthusiastic gardener, who could name virtually every flower she came upon in both English and Latin. She attended Swarthmore College, where she graduated in 1949 with a major in Latin and minors in Greek and Fine Arts. She later told her children, ''I studied all of this so that I could be sure to teach you to speak English properly.'' Surviving are her daughter, Holly Ornstein Carter and her husband, Robert of New York City; her son, David Stanbrough Ornstein and his wife, Alexandra of Greenwich; and five grandchildren.

2008-09-07T00:00:00Z,"APPLING --William T. Renowned conductor, pianist, and educator William Appling passed away on Friday, August 29, 2008. He was 75 and lived in Poughkeepsie, NY. In 1979, Mr. Appling founded William Appling Singers & Orchestra (WASO) in Cleveland, Ohio, a professional ensemble dedicated to performing music of all periods, and particularly the works of American composers. WASO released four critically acclaimed recordings on the New World and Albany record labels and premiered numerous contemporary works. While in Ohio, WASO presented many concerts and performed at venues including Severance Hall and the Blossom Music Center. Relocating to Poughkeepsie in 1989 when Mr. Appling was appointed Director of Choral Activities at Vassar College, WASO presented concerts at Lincoln Center, Bard College and many other venues, both as its own entity and under the auspices of the Bard Music Festival and American Symphony Orchestra. In 1996, WASO was one of the only professional musical organizations in the United States to present concerts celebrating the 250th anniversary of the birth of American composer William Billings. Early in his career as educator in the Cleveland area, Mr. Appling was Choral Director for Glenville High School where under his direction the choir received widespread acclaim and was invited to sing at the the Ohio Music Education Association in Columbus, Ohio, and the New York World's Fair. The choir also sang a sold-out recital in Severance Hall in 1965. At Case Institute of Technology, he conducted the Men's Glee Club, which toured Europe and gave concerts in Germany, Switzerland, France and Luxembourg. While in Ohio, he was also Music Director of the West Shore Chorale and the Cleveland Philharmonic Chorus. He served on the faculty for 25 years at Western Reserve Academy in Hudson, Ohio, and was Director of Music there for many years. While at WRA, Mr. Appling founded and directed Summer Music Experience, an international six-week program offering intensive music training and performance experience to gifted students of high school age. The music camp/festival involved members of the Cleveland Orchestra and included visiting artists and master classes with Robert Shaw, Andre Watts, Janos Starker, Lynn Harrell and Lorin Maazel. William Appling received numerous honors during his career, including the first Kulas Foundation Fellowship Award for Choral Conducting with the Cleveland Orchestra, during which time he assisted George Szell and Robert Shaw. He also enjoyed an active career as a pianist, appearing in solo recital at Town Hall, New York City, concerto performances with the Cleveland Orchestra, at the Aspen Festival under Darius Milhaud, and in duo recital with tenor Seth McCoy. Mr. Appling most recently recorded the complete piano works of Scott Joplin. A celebration of William Appling's life will take place in 2009. Gifts in his memory may be made to the Henry Street Settlement, 265 Henry St., New York, NY 10002. Further information is available at WASO's web site: www.muzen.com/waso.html."
2008-09-07T00:00:00Z,"FRIEDMAN--Ross Mandel, 55, a former staff attorney for the New York City Department of Environmental Protection, died Sunday, August 31st at The Village of Laurel Lakes Assisted Living Center in Lee, MA, after suffering from Huntington's Disease for more than 20 years. Friedman, a life-long environmentalist, spent a majority of his legal career involved with complex acid rain litigation in order to protect the Catskill Watershed area of New York City. He played a significant role in the construction of Manhattan's North River waste water treatment plant. This public works project integrates 28-acre Riverbank State Park atop one of the world's largest sewage treatment facilities. Born February 21, 1953 in Oakland, California, Friedman was the son of the late Julian Richard Friedman, a University of California at Berkeley political science professor, and the late Marian Nieder Friedman, a social worker and civil rights activist. He attended elementary school in Berkeley before living in Kenya, East Africa where he attended Greenland School for a year, and then moving permanently to Syracuse, New York. He was an honors graduate of Syracuse's Nottingham High School, where he served as school vice president, and a graduate of University of Wisconsin at Madison, where he studied economics. He received his doctorate of law from Syracuse University School of Law. Friedman was deeply committed to environmental issues. While studying law, he served as a summer intern at the New York State Department of Environmental Conservation in Albany. Following law school, he was a fulltime volunteer for the Environmental Defense League and Sierra Club, and served as a field coordinator for Presidential Candidate Mo Udall, the former Arizona Congressman who was a strong environmental advocate. A lifelong sports enthusiast, he was a highly ranked junior tennis player in the Eastern Lawn Tennis Association, captain of the perennial state powerhouse Nottingham High School Tennis Team and played on the Division One varsity tennis team at the University of Wisconsin. In his mid-20s, he became an avid marathon runner and finished several New York City Marathons in less than 3 hours. He was a serious skier, who frequented North America's most challenging ski mountains such as Whistler Mountain in British Columbia, Taos in New Mexico and Jackson Hole in Wyoming. While stricken with Huntington's Disease, a progressive neurological illness, Friedman became an accomplished therapeutic horseback rider. He is survived by his uncle, Bailey Nieder of Seattle, WA; his brothers, Clark Arnold Friedman of Needham, MA, and Thomas Harold Friedman, Newton, MA; and two nieces and a nephew. Memorial services will be announced by the family. Donations should be sent to Blue Rider Stable, P.O. Box 924, Great Barrington, MA 01230."

Along with the slight space between her perfect teeth, the effect is sexy and slightly comic. Enjoying her first leading role, Ms. Dennings makes the most of it in ''Nick & Norah's Infinite Playlist'' (Oct. 3). ''Nick & Norah'' is a romantic comedy about two smart, oddball high school seniors with a shared taste for arcane pop who fall for each other while tangling with their awful exes and chasing a mysterious band called Fluffy over a long New York night.

2008-09-07T00:00:00Z,"Some people know how to live very well. David Tanis certainly does -- though it has to be said that he has had the consummate mentor and friend in the improvisational journey of life: Alice Waters. In 2001, when Tanis was in about his 20th year cooking at Waters's legendary Berkeley restaurant, Chez Panisse, he was vacationing in Paris when a friend told him about a lovely 17th-century apartment for rent in the Fifth Arrondissement. He wasn't really in the market, but he was already in love with Paris and fell instantly in love with the apartment too. Tanis loved it so much, in fact, that he decided to make his home there. As he explained, ''Every time I go traveling, I think, Oh, I think I'll move here. And sometimes I do.'' Deciding to live in Paris was easy; the hard part was telling Waters that he wouldn't be returning to Chez Panisse, as he did in the '90s, when he opened a restaurant in Santa Fe. Waters later surprised him with a plan. Before he left for Paris, Tanis was sharing head-chef duties with Jean-Pierre Moullé, dividing the workweek. Moulle missed his summer house in Bordeaux. Tanis wanted to move to Paris. Instead of splitting the week, Waters suggested that they split the year. Everyone was happy."

To fill the gap, she has started a clothing line called Mirror/Dash with her friends Melinda Wansbrough and Jeffrey Monteiro. The name is taken from her experimental music project with her husband and Sonic Youth bandmate, Thurston Moore. Their first piece: a military-style wool jacket inspired by Françoise Hardy. ''I know, every designer says they're inspired by Françoise Hardy,'' Ms. Gordon said. ''But I've been listening to her records for 15 years.'' Additional designs will be offered throughout the year. For now, just 50 of the jackets will be sold. ''Some people make limited-edition records -- we're making a limited-edition jacket,'' she joked."

Second, see what buyers have bought for the stores. And third, what people actually choose and how they wear it. The public becomes the arbiter of fashion, not the designers."

2008-09-07T00:00:00Z,"For the French director Jean-Pierre Melville the world consisted of hideouts. There was the hothouse fantasy domain of his film of Cocteau's novel ''Les Enfants Terribles,'' the safe houses used by the Resistance in his masterpiece ''Army of Shadows'' and the shabby apartments and back rooms frequented by the crooks in the genre thrillers that make up most of his filmography. Two of his movies, ''Le Doulos'' (1962), which means ''The Stool Pigeon,'' and ''Le Deuxième Souffle'' (1966), or ''The Second Wind,'' both arriving in fine new transfers from Criterion, are essentially heist-gone-wrong stories. Both are also reminders that Melville, who died at 55 in 1973, was a singular sensibility. A spiritual godfather to the New Wave filmmakers, his carefully calibrated style was markedly different from their caught-on-the-fly approach. But though Melville made crime thrillers, he was also out of step with conventional commercial filmmaking. Tense and involving, his dour, deliberately paced thrillers nonetheless contain little visceral charge. And while the stories are all satisfyingly worked out, he seems much more interested in investigating the ethics of fringe existence."

2008-09-07T00:00:00Z,"Nicholas Meyer's 1979 time-travel fantasy has a terrific premise. An English surgeon discovered to be Jack the Ripper (David Warner, glowering scarily) escapes to late-1970s San Francisco in a time machine built by his friend H. G. Wells (Malcolm McDowell, right, with Mary Steenburgen). Wells, the fervent socialist who believes that a future utopia is inevitable, follows and falls in love with a modern woman (Ms. Steenburgen) who embodies all the notions he holds about female emancipation. Mr. Meyer directs the movie, from a story by Karl Alexander and Steve Hayes, in a luxe '40s studio style. The painted backdrops of Big Ben, the sets of London streets with fog machines working overtime to make everything look gloomy and mysterious, all have a quaintness that's very pleasing. (The same can't be said of Miklos Rozsa's score, which nearly steamrolls the film each time the composer stages one of his D-Day landings on your eardrums.)"

As played by a 12-year-old tyro named Lina Leandersson, she looks about as predatory as a kid who got into the jam jar again. Set in a wintry Stockholm suburb where even the drunks look slightly marooned, ''Let the Right One In'' revolves around the budding attraction between a slender boy named Oskar, who is savagely bullied at school, and Ms. Leandersson's Eli, his new neighbor in the apartment next door. Eli (pronounced Ellie) has some decidedly supernatural characteristics: She can scoot up the side of a multistory building in no time and appear and disappear with the suddenness of teleportation. She doesn't feel the cold, so when she first turns up outdoors as Oskar works his Rubik's Cube (she wants to work it too), she's coatless and barefoot."

McReynolds was a regular contributor to the journal, Encounter: Education for Meaning and Social Justice, writing on issues such as free schools, homeschooling, and children's right to a happy childhood. She was named the journal's Associate Editor in 2006. McReynolds was sharply critical of test-driven education and the No Child Left Behind Act, which she saw as cramping children's full development. Dr. McReynolds was born in Kansas City, Missouri, attended high school in Scottsdale, Arizona, and graduated from Columbia University School of General Studies in 1983, Magna cum laude. She also was elected to Phi Beta Kappa. She received a Ph.D. in clinical psychology from the City University of New York in 2004. While working on her graduate degree, she taught numerous undergraduates courses, and was widely regarded as one of the most inspiring teachers in the department and college, according to the department's former chairperson, Dr. William Crain. From 2005 to 2006, she served as the interim director of The City College Gateway Academy, the college orientation and advisement center for new and continuing students.

2008-09-07T00:00:00Z,"STEUBER--Charles P. (Chuck). Shipping Pioneer and Founder of the National Croquet Center, Dies...Charles P. (Chuck) Steuber died at home, surrounded by his family, the morning of Wednesday, August 27, 2008. He was 87. Born December 26, 1920 in Milwaukee, WI, he was the son of Charles H. Steuber and Alma Paul Steuber. He was educated at Hartford and Riverside schools in Milwaukee and majored in chemical engineering at the University of Wisconsin where he was also a member of the Alpha Delta Phi fraternity. Chuck started his career with Union Carbide and by 1947 was marketing director for Union Carbide's European sales and instrumental in establishing their European headquarters in Geneva, Switzerland. In 1949 Chuck married Margaret (Peggy) Morris, also from Milwaukee, and the newlywed couple lived in Geneva until Chuck finished his career with Carbide and returned to New York to start his own company, while Peggy raised their eventual family of three children. In 1951 Chuck founded a company that became a pioneering merchant firm in the transportation, storage and distribution of petrochemicals. At that time, all chemicals were transported around the world in 55 gallon drums. In the 1950s a few companies experimented with modifying existing plain steel petroleum tankers to transport some chemicals in bulk. Then, in 1961, Chuck built the world's first tanker with individual pumps and lines to an array of specialized tanks designed to maintain the high quality specifications of most products in the petrochemical industry. The ship was christened the S/S Alchemist and was the progenitor of all the ships that service the global industry of today. Chuck was also a pioneer in the bulk storage of petrochemicals. He built several facilities around the world, the largest of which was Eurotank in Antwerp, Belgium and became the largest such facility in Continental Europe. The Steuber Group of companies were also involved in the marketing and distribution of chemicals with firms located throughout Europe, the United States, Asia and Australia. After living in Pelham, NY for 27 years, Chuck and Peggy moved to Boca Raton, FL in 1983, but kept a summer home in Rye, NY. By then Chuck had retired, but his venture capitalist and visionary spirit kept him busy with several projects. He funded what has become a very successful internet fulfillment company, Dotcom Distribution, which, in a way, aspires to the pioneering storage and shipping success in the cyber world that Chuck achieved in the chemical industry. He also became very involved in his chosen sport of competitive croquet. At that time any substantial tournament play involved organizing a patchwork of courts at local estates or area Country Clubs and resorts. The croquet world dreamed of having their own dedicated center for the greater enjoyment and promotion of the sport. In 2000-2001 Chuck purchased land, funded and built what became the Charles P. Steuber National Croquet Center. It is comprised of 12 laserleveled courts, a 18,000 square foot club house on 10 acres of land in West Palm Beach and is today the jewel of the croquet community at large. Chuck was also a member of the U.S. Croquet Association Hall of Fame. Chuck is survived by his sisters Marion of Paw Paw, MI and Ruth of Milwaukee, WI; sons Charlie of Lighthouse Point, FL and Victor of Eugene, OR; daughter Midge of Jerome, AZ and two grandchildren; Lucas of Portland, OR and Robyn of Eugene, OR. He was predeceased by his wife of 57 years, Peggy. A private ceremony will be held at the Forest Home Cemetery in Milwaukee, WI. In lieu of flowers, the family requests those so inclined make a donation in Chuck's name to the charity of their choice appreciated."

But she also relies on the help and companionship of her precocious daughter, Benji (Saoirse Ronan, the striking young actress from ''Atonement''). The two scrape together a living as a performing duo, of which Mary is the star. She uses her ''clairvoyant'' powers to wow audiences, although her spangly, skimpy dancing-girl costume sure doesn't hurt."

At the Green Field Paper Company in San Diego, requests for seed-embedded business cards -- which actually sprout if planted -- have more than doubled over the last year, said Shari Smith, who owns the company along with her husband, Rick. Of the Earth, a handmade-paper company in Seattle owned by Kevin and Lori Graham, says it gets several requests a week for its flower-seeded business cards. (If someone gives you one of these cards, just be sure to save the information on it before you plant.) Coming for the holidays: plantable wrapping paper and gift tags. JULIE BICK"

Celeste was adored and admired by hundreds of friends and colleagues whom she met throughout the world during 40 years of flying and during her subsequent 20 years of travel while in retirement.

BEHIND THE NEWS Downed power lines cause only a small percentage of California wildfires, but they tend to be big ones because the lines generally traverse remote, windy terrain on high towers. The two utilities involved, San Diego Gas & Electric and Cox Communications, denied that their lines were badly maintained and said unusually fierce winds were to blame. Some elected officials want the lines put underground, but the utilities balk at the cost."

2008-09-07T00:00:00Z,"Orson Welles's 1958 ''Touch of Evil'' is a work of slippery precision, a picture whose seductiveness is only enhanced by its refusal to surrender fully to our grasp. Charlton Heston (below, with Janet Leigh), in dark makeup, is Mike Vargas, the upstanding Mexican narcotics agent who becomes involved in a murder case that straddles the Mexico-United States border. Leigh is his feisty new bride, whose reward for her pluck is to be chained to a bed and drugged; and Welles is the corrupt American fat-cat cop Hank Quinlan, looming over the picture like a scowling parade balloon. In ''Touch of Evil'' important plot points and crucial dialogue come at you sideways and from behind in slithery sections, like the vertebrae of a snake. Blink and you might miss something.

2008-09-07T00:00:00Z,"EVERY week of the Grand Tour, I signed off on my travel videos with a standard line: ''For The New York Times, this is Matt Gross, the Frugal Traveler.'' This sentence was so simple, and yet it gave me no end of headaches. The problem? I was trying to say it in French, in Romanian, in Lithuanian -- in the local language of every country I visited. The issue was never ''The New York Times,'' nor my name, which swings easily from Mathieu to Mateo to Matthias. No, the troublesome word was ''frugal'' -- it's a concept that just doesn't translate easily. Often, my local friends explained, its closest analogue was ''cheap,'' which can have a negative connotation of stinginess. And even if we came up with the right word -- ''rhis'' in Maltese, ''prijsbewuste'' in Dutch -- there was still one last challenge: How the heck do I pronounce this stuff? (Answer: poorly.)"

2008-09-07T00:00:00Z,"Pedro Castaneda was installing wireless computer networks in San Antonio when he met a young filmmaker named Chris Eska, who asked him to be in his first movie, ''August Evening'' (Sept. 5). Mr. Castaneda hesitated, but after reading the script and consulting his family, he said yes. Considering that Mr. Eska was offering the leading role to a novice in his 50s, it's hard to say who was taking the greater chance. But no matter -- their gamble has paid off handsomely. ''August Evening'' is a deceptively quiet, Ozu-like drama set in southwest Texas, near the Mexican border. Mr. Castaneda plays Jaime, an illegal immigrant and father who has lost one son and whose other children are embarrassed by him. When the movie begins, he's living with his wife and his son's devoted young widow of four years in a small house on the chicken farm where he works. As Mr. Castaneda goes about Jaime's chores in the heat and mess of the overcrowded chicken barn, his silent performance becomes remarkably eloquent."

I couldn't afford to be in Germany and not to see them in Düsseldorf, where they've lived since 1999, so I rebooked my tickets to include a stopover there. We had lived in the same dorm at Kiev University -- at that time it was the Soviet Union. They got married probably after the third year in the university; I went to their native town in Moldova for their wedding party. After university each of us got busy with our own lives. We spent time talking a lot about our old friends, walking in the city in Düsseldorf, drinking beer. I was surprised to see how many German people, senior people, were on the street drinking and talking to each other; it's a different culture. You'll never see in Moscow such kind of people who spend time on the street drinking beer.'' As told toSeth Kugel"

2008-09-07T00:00:00Z,"Now that we know that Robert Downey Jr. can play pretty much anything -- from a captain-of-industry superhero with a soul (''Iron Man'') to a self-absorbed Australian actor who undergoes a ''pigmentation-alteration procedure'' so he can play a black man (''Tropic Thunder'') -- his performance in the 1992 ''Chaplin'' should not seem so astonishing. But to watch the picture again, in this digitally remastered 15th-anniversary edition, is to be reminded that even before he hit 30, Mr. Downey had the ability to burrow more deeply into a character than most actors can manage after a lifetime in the business. He plays Charlie Chaplin as a figure who is both larger than life and deeply unknowable, a fragile human being locked inside the bold, decisive strokes of a caricature. Mr. Downey doesn't just recreate Chaplin's physical genius, he suggests that that famous balletic, bowlegged walk might have been one man's way of staying safely balanced on the knife edge of emotional anguish."

2008-09-07T00:00:00Z,"THREE HUNDRED years ago, wealthy young Englishmen began taking a post-Oxbridge trek through France and Italy in search of art, culture and the roots of Western civilization. With nearly unlimited funds, aristocratic connections and months (or years) to roam, they commissioned paintings, perfected their language skills and mingled with the upper crust of the Continent. No one knows who came up with it, but their adventures soon had a perfectly appropriate name: the Grand Tour. This summer, I embarked on a Grand Tour of my own, reinventing the classic European journey as a budget-minded, modern-day jaunt. Where the original Grand Tourists carried letters of credit granting them access to riches, and letters of introduction to society figures, I had just 100 euros a day (about $160 when I began, but more like $150 today) and the e-mail addresses of several friends of friends.

Sylvia Rogers Miller, a long time resident of Stamford, Connecticut passed away July 10, 2008 peacefully in her sleep at age 96 of natural causes. She was bom on July 22, 1911 in Hartford, Connecticut, the daughter of Julia Erwin Miller and Martin Peck Miller, the later a graduate of Yale Class of 1902. As a young woman, she lived for many years in Monmouth County, New Jersey and was a graduate of Red Bank High School, Class of 1928. Ms. Miller was a lifelong artist and skilled in many disciplines but especially dance. She studied dance in New Jersey and New York and at the Alexander Volinine studios in Paris. Her experience in dance spanned a wide range of forms, including performance with the Garrick Gaieties Revue in a chorus line with the renowned actress Rosalind Russell. The Revue started on Broadway, in 1925, and Ms. Miller joined it in later years, performing on Broadway, and on a tour which included the United States and Canada. Beginning in 1935, she also performed and taught a form of dance set to music called ''Rhythms'', originated by Miss Ruth Doing with whom she studied, Sylvia taught Rhythms to children and adults and continued to do so for adults into her nineties. She also excelled at wood carving, drawing and painting and was still carving wood in her late nineties. Sylvia taught dance and other subjects at the City and Country School, 146 West 13th Street New York City for almost 40 years from the Fall of 1939 until her retirement in 1976. In the summers, beginning in 1932, she taught similar subjects at a camp in the Adirondacks on Upper St. Regis Lake, Paul Smiths, known for many years as the GardnerDoing Camp. Sylvia continued to visit the Camp and enjoyed swimming in the lake and boating until very recently. She is survived by her longtime companion Patricia Panasuk, her brother, William C. Miller and his wife Hannelore Miller of Sausalito, California, a nephew, grandnephews and grandnieces. Family services will be private. A memorial gathering and celebration of Sylvia's life and work is to be held October 25th, 2008 at the City and Country School, 146 West 13th Street, NYC."

The first World War II feature film devoted to the experience of some of the 900,000 or so black military personnel who served, Mr. Lee's ''Miracle'' follows four soldiers from the all-black 92nd Division who become separated from their company and hole up in a partisan-controlled Italian village behind German lines.

2008-09-08T00:00:00Z,"With the presidential campaign now in full swing, Congress returns today for a September stretch that will be more about politics than policy as the two parties maneuver for full advantage in both Congressional contests and the race for the White House. The first issue on the Congressional plate will be higher energy prices as House Democrats could move as early as this week to bring to the floor a broad energy plan that would open up some areas to coastal drilling while providing incentives for alternative energy and reducing subsidies for oil companies. Democrats were still assembling the measure over the weekend, and Republicans were set to portray it as a sham, particularly if Democrats do not allow them any opportunity to amend it on the floor. But the measure is expected to open the door to new drilling in coastal waters now off limits, potentially depriving Republicans of the ability to keep hammering Democrats for blocking an offshore drilling vote. The Senate, where a growing bipartisan group is pushing its own version of a comprehensive measure, could have more success in finding a consensus, one that includes some financial aid for the nation's auto industry, throwing the lobbying muscle of automakers behind the plan. Senate Republicans may cite the need to keep focused on energy if they block a Democratic attempt later Monday to vote to take up the annual Pentagon policy bill. Democrats will also be pushing for a second economic stimulus package headed into the fall, arguing that the government takeover of Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac and rising unemployment are clear evidence that the economy is still in turmoil and average Americans need help as much as the mortgage giants and automakers. ''This situation is yet another stark reminder that we live in difficult economic times and we must do more to help struggling families reach the American dream,'' said Senator Harry Reid, Democrat of Nevada, the majority leader. ''That is why I urge President Bush, Senator McCain and other Republicans to work with Democrats in the immediate days ahead to enact an economic recovery package.'' The one thing Congress must do before the end of the month is pass a stop-gap financing bill for the federal government after Sept. 30, but even that seemingly simple action is fraught with politics. Such a bill would typically include an extension of the annual ban on drilling off much of the nation's coast, and Republicans may try to block the funding bill over the ban, raising the prospect of a government shutdown just a few weeks before the November elections. Lawmakers will also have to decide whether any interim spending measure expires later this year, forcing a post-election lame-duck session, or extends into early 2009 after the inauguration of a new president. With some states still cleaning up from Hurricane Gustav and a more menacing hurricane approaching, Congress will also likely provide significant disaster relief before leaving town to campaign. Lawmakers will also try to deal with a rapidly depleting highway fund that is threatening to shut down road and bridge projects around the nation."

Born November 11, 1927 in New York City to the late Charles George Muller and Georgia Lydia Stanbrough, she grew up and lived most of her life in Greenwich, CT. She began her publishing career at Time, Inc. From 1952 to 1961 Barbara worked at National Broadcasting Company (NBC) in New York as a producer in news and public affairs and as an assistant to legendary Frank McGee. In 1962 she married the late Peter Ornstein. They moved to Greenwich into a 200-year-old farmhouse. In 1975 she became the editor-in-chief of the Friends of Greenwich Library Oral History Project, a job she held until 2003. She also chaired the Greenwich Fresh Air Fund and was a board member for the Greenwich Library. Barbara was a devoted genealogist as befits a 10th generation decedent of Mayflower settlers. She was related to George Washington and Alexander Hamilton. She was an avid sailor and an enthusiastic gardener, who could name virtually every flower she came upon in both English and Latin. She attended Swarthmore College, where she graduated in 1949 with a major in Latin and minors in Greek and Fine Arts. She later told her children, ''I studied all of this so that I could be sure to teach you to speak English properly.'' Surviving are her daughter, Holly Ornstein Carter and her husband, Robert of New York City; her son, David Stanbrough Ornstein and his wife, Alexandra of Greenwich; and five grandchildren. She is also survived by her half-sister, Jenny Muller Coons of Sedona, AZ. A memorial service will be held Saturday, September 13 at the Indian Harbor Yacht Club in Greenwich at 1pm. Barbara's family is asking that donations in her honor and memory be made in her name to Swarthmore College or to the Greenwich Library."

2008-09-08T00:00:00Z,"BOBO STENSON TRIO ''Cantando'' (ECM) This record, by the Swedish pianist Bobo Stenson, embodies two qualities that usually don't go together: extreme breadth and extreme humility. Often when a jazz bandleader serves up a program as mixed as ''Cantando'' -- folk song, an Ornette Coleman jazz tune, lieder, tango, free improvisation -- he wants to show you that he has a battling spirit: he can't be classified; he hasn't bought into any particular aesthetic. An assertiveness of touch tends to go along with that. But Mr. Stenson makes fairly sublime piano-trio records without over-arranging, over-playing or over-bandleading. In his mid-60s now, he's the repository of half a century of the development of free jazz, in particular the European post-'60s kind, with its folk and classical leanings. Yet he wears it all lightly. In his recent records you don't hear strategies or contentions, but a natural working flow."

Usually his stories are first-person monologues, their drama stoked by Mr. Sheff's fearlessly disheveled voice: crooning like Morrissey, quavering like David Byrne, cracking, aching. The band matches his mood swings and eggs him on, harking back to the 1960s and '70s with folk-rock, new wave, country and an occasional stately ballad, sometimes sprinkled with mariachi horns or sleigh bells or banjo."
2008-09-08T00:00:00Z,"McREYNOLDS--Dr. Kathryn Baker, 52, a prominent writer on youth and educational issues, died on September 5, 2008, after a year-long battle with lung cancer. McReynolds was a regular contributor to the journal, Encounter: Education for Meaning and Social Justice, writing on issues such as free schools, homeschooling, and children's right to a happy childhood. She was named the journal's Associate Editor in 2006. McReynolds was sharply critical of test-driven education and the No Child Left Behind Act, which she saw as cramping children's full development. Dr. McReynolds was born in Kansas City, Missouri, attended high school in Scottsdale, Arizona, and graduated from Columbia University School of General Studies in 1983, Magna cum laude. She also was elected to Phi Beta Kappa. She received a Ph.D. in clinical psychology from the City University of New York in 2004. While working on her graduate degree, she taught numerous undergraduates courses, and was widely regarded as one of the most inspiring teachers in the department and college, according to the department's former chairperson, Dr. William Crain. From 2005 to 2006, she served as the interim director of The City College Gateway Academy, the college orientation and advisement center for new and continuing students. Dr. McReynolds, is survived by her husband, Pinchas Ben-Or, her children, Lilith Helen Ben-Or and Asher Jacob Ben-Or, her mother, Helen Jarvis McReynolds, her brothers Steven Martin and Andrew Claxon McReynolds, and her sister Billie J. McReynolds. The wake will be held at the Riverdale Funeral Home, 5044 Broadway (West 214 Street) New York, NY 10034 on Sunday, September 7th, 57pm.

Nothing superfluous intervenes. On Friday in Studio 4 of New York City Center, where I saw the ensemble for the first time, costumes were simple and mainly minimal. There were just five dancers. Not only did the artistic director, Miro Magloire, give brief, sensible, unpretentious spoken introductions to each work and tell the audience where to go for refreshments and purchases at intermission, he even helped to shift a grand piano. Though it's evident that music is the basis of most of his work, he's not a zealot about it. In an act of happy in-house heresy, one of his works, ''Dreams,'' was performed in silence, aside from the murmurs and isolated words uttered by its three dancers."

In a paper calculating new Chinese earthquake risks in Geophysical Research Letters, a team led by Japanese and American geophysicists analyzed shifts in stress along several faults around the area where a magnitude 7.9 temblor killed nearly 70,000 people and drew rare citizen protests because so many schools crumbled. The scientists found substantial increases along the surrounding strike-slip faults, in which abutting plates in the earth's crust -- as in the San Andreas fault -- get stuck and can generate destructive shaking when they lurch free. Over all, the scientists say there is now a 57 to 71 percent chance of a temblor of magnitude 6 or greater within a decade, and about a one-in-four chance of a quake greater than 7.0 within 30 years."

When elections were lastattempted in Angola in 1992, the results were a shock and a disaster.Razor-thin margins, in a winner-take-all competition, led the losingside -- UNITA, led by its president Jonas Savimbi -- to plunge Angolaback into a war that swiftly reignited violence across the country. Thistime around, there was never any serious question of the ruling MPLA'sability to win decisively, and never any question that UNITA wouldacquiesce to defeat but still retain a foothold in the political system.Angola today, by comparison with other African countries, appears farbetter able to navigate electoral tests. It is beginning to look like anormal country, which is something Angola's leaders have aspired toachieve since Savimbi was killed in February 2002."

You can no doubt find more productive ways to spend your time.

Carole was an accomplished artist and Administrative Assistant at Small Property Owners of New York (S.P.O.N.Y.). Although Carole's special gifts of color and design grace countless homes and offices, her art is but a small portion of her legacy. Though blessed with beauty, talent, and style, she was never filled with herself. Polite, considerate, devoted to family, and fiercely loyal, she would never gossip or betray a confidence. One could not have a better or more thoughtful friend. And yet Carole was playful, with a keen sense of humor, marvelous laugh and beguiling charm. She was also strong, with a determination and courage that let a younger Carole overcome obstacles that most young mothers would have found insurmountable. Raising two little girls on her own, she built a career as an artist that provided the secure home her children needed to become successful and independent adults. Because Carole never dwelt in the past, her friends of later years had no inkling of how hard she had battled. And that was the way Carole wanted it. She was always positive, looking forward, never back. Carole always intended the world to see her at her best, and succeeded, even to the very end when cancer began to overpower her. Deeply loved by family and friends, Carole had all the virtues and more. She will remain treasured in our hearts forever."

In the end, Berri postulated that a pretty boy QB may earn about $300,000 extra in his annual paycheck. “It fits into a lot of research that says that people who are more attractive get more of what they want in life,” Berri told us. “How you look makes a difference.

2008-09-12T07:15:40Z,Merrill Lynch shares fell nearly 17 percent on Thursday as worries over Lehman Brothers‘ future raised questions on which investment bank may be next to face questions about its survival.
2008-09-12T07:13:15Z,"A day after Lehman Brothers sought to assure Wall Street that it could survive on its own, the beleaguered investment bank, urged on by federal officials, bowed to mounting pressure on Thursday and put itself up for sale."

Today saw Ralph Lauren's deluxe expedition clothes, L'Wren Scott's ultra-feminine dresses and a lofty, jazzy feather cape, and Ralph Rucci at his most relaxed and refined. People are still talking about Francisco Costa's Calvin Klein cubes. Clearly we have a group of designers, including Costa and Raf Simons, who are attracted to new materials and ideas related to contemporary art and architecture, and are eager to express themselves in that direction. It can be argued that the things Costa personally accomplished with this collection will lead him to other designs. Just as in engineering, lots of things come from experiment and risk."
2008-09-12T23:08:15Z,"1. Terrelle Pryor, the nation's top quarterback recruit, got just 28 snaps in the first two games and didn't attempt a pass longer than 10 yards. Not exactly the type of resume that makes you think he'll tear up the Coliseum. Todd Boeckman has played terribly in his past four games against top division competition. He's thrown two touchdowns and six interceptions. He has also looked as mobile as a fire hydrant. But by not giving Pryor more live-ammo snaps in the first two games, Ohio State looks as if it will use Pryor sparingly against the Trojans. And that may greatly decrease Ohio State's chances to win."

Brennan, Jr. Professor Emeritus of Law at Rutgers School of Law--Newark and a legendary figure in the history of the law school, died on August 9, 2008, at his home in Hoboken, NJ. He was 85 years old. On Sunday, September 21, 2008, at 1:00pm, a memorial tribute to Professor Axelrod will be held at Rutgers Law School, 123 Washington St., Newark, NJ. Professor Axelrod was one of the ablest, most penetrating, and most exciting law teachers of his--or indeed of any-era. For 59 years, from 1948 to 2007, Professor Axelrod employed brilliance, verbal artistry, colorful anecdotes (some with a basis in fact), and bursts of humor to bring tens of thousands of students to thoughtful understanding of legal doctrine and the underlying tensions of policy. His fields of special interest were Contracts, Property, Commercial Law and Bankruptcy but he was equally at home teaching Antitrust, Oil and Gas, and Local Government. Another of his pedagogical interests was the Law of Gambling, a seminar he particularly enjoyed researching and teaching. Professor Axelrod was born in Detroit in 1922. As an undergraduate he attended the University of Michigan, graduating with a B.A. in 1943. During World War II he worked for the War Labor Board. In 1946 he matriculated at Yale Law School, earning his LL.B. in 1948. Two weeks before graduating, he commenced his teaching career as an Instructor at the University of Nebraska Law School. In 1960 Professor Axelrod shifted his academic base to Rutgers School of Law--Newark, where he was a beloved teacher for 47 years. In 1978 he received the Lindback Prize, Rutgers University's highest teaching award. Professor Axelrod's prowess as a law teacher was reflected in the roster of law schools at which he was a Visiting Professor: Berkeley, University of Chicago, Georgetown, Harvard, Hastings, University of Pennsylvania, Southern California, Stanford and Yale. The Law School is establishing the Allan Axelrod Memorial Fund to support the creation of an Axelrod Professorship as well as the existing Axelrod Library Endowment. Donations to the Memorial Fund should be made out to the Rutgers University Foundation, with a notation that it is for the Allan Axelrod Memorial Fund and should be mailed to the Dean's Office, Rutgers Law School--Newark, 123 Washington St., Newark, NJ 07102."

Any time a hurricaneaffects Galveston, we think about the 1900 catastrophe, but accurate modern forecasts and 2 categories less wind mean that Ike was not a repeat.According to CNN, waves breaking over the seawall in Galveston caused up to 7 feet of flooding. As horrendous as 7 feet of salt water in your neighborhood seems, it's very different from what happened that on windy Saturday night 108 years (and 5 days) ago. Then mighty waves swept away all the houses and people from the seaward third of the island. Since many structures in eastTexas today (how to up this delicately?) do not incorporate every imaginable wind-resistant design feature, we may see a surprising amount of roof, door, and window failures.Ike's huge wind circulation raised a powerful sea with potential to damage offshore petroleum production. Nonetheless, there is reason to hope that the damage will be manageable."

The officers and staff of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York mourn the loss of their colleague and friend Leonardo Bartolini, senior vice president in the International Research division of the Bank's Research and Statistics Group. Leonardo was one of the Bank's most respected analysts of global macroeconomic and monetary policy issues. His research and policy work centered on monetary policy execution, interbank markets, central bank intervention, exchange rate regimes, and capital controls. Most recently, he had been studying cross-country differences in monetary policy implementation and the behavior of the money markets. Leonardo came to the United States from Italy to pursue a graduate education in economics. He received a Ph.D. from Princeton University in 1991 after completing his dissertation, ''Essays on International Capital Markets under Uncertainty.'' Leonardo joined the New York Fed in 1995 as an economist in the Foreign Research department and held various positions before being made a senior vice president in 2002. From 2000 to 2004, he served as head of the International Research division. For two periods in the 1990s-1990-95 and 1998-Leonardo worked as an economist at the International Monetary Fund. During his years at the IMF, he made significant contributions to the institution's work agenda, particularly in the area of exchange rate analysis, and published extensively in leading economics and policy journals. Leonardo was very modest about his own professional accomplishments, but he was quick to support and encourage younger economists beginning their careers. He inspired all of his colleagues at the IMF and the New York Fed with his integrity, intelligence, and quiet authority, and he was loved as a warm and generous friend. We extend our deepest condolences to Leonardo's wife, Jin, and his young son, Lorenzo. A memorial service will be held at 11am on Saturday, September 13, at the Tillman Chapel, Church Center for the United Nations, 1st Avenue and 44th Street, New York City. Donations may be made to the All Things Project of the Neighborhood Church of Greenwich Village, 269 Bleecker Street, New York, NY 10014. Timothy F. Geithner, President and Chief Executive Officer"

2008-09-14T00:00:00Z,"“Cooking in Wartime” (Aug. 31) reminded me of my childhood in Germany during World War II and what seemed then to be my mother’s crazy reaction to dangerous circumstances. She, like many Kriegsfrauen, as wives of men who were willingly or unwillingly fighting Hitler’s war were called, tried to provide normalcy for their children. Despite bombing alarms, a meal needed to be cooked and carried several flights to the basement while bombs were falling, with the admonishment not to spill, a tall order for a 6-year-old. I only realized years later that this was my mother’s way to hold at bay the paralyzing fear that shook my whole body. Stephanie Gruner’s prenatal motherly instincts were right on target: keep the family safe via the path of normalcy, channeling anxiety into the attack of staples, transforming them into sustenance."

2008-09-14T00:00:00Z,"Anyone who has bet on football often enough to endanger his marriage and finances is familiar with the eerie precision of ''the line.'' The book's goal, of course, is to be ''result neutral.'' So if the Bears are a 7-point favorite over the Packers and money starts piling on the Bears, the line will inch up until the Packers are attractive enough for money to start flowing toward Green Bay, at which point the line might move back down, and so on. But the mystery to most bettors is how the line is set in the first place. An inaccurate opening line can be costly to an individual casino -- or bookie in the passenger seat of a van with tinted windows -- as sharp gamblers rush to the side that's providing surplus value. Which is to say that setting the opening line is not a trivial matter."

2008-09-14T00:00:00Z,"BARTOLINI--Leonardo. The officers and staff of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York mourn the loss of their colleague and friend Leonardo Bartolini, senior vice president in the International Research division of the Bank's Research and Statistics Group. Leonardo was one of the Bank's most respected analysts of global macroeconomic and monetary policy issues. His research and policy work centered on monetary policy execution, interbank markets, central bank intervention, exchange rate regimes, and capital controls. Most recently, he had been studying cross-country differences in monetary policy implementation and the behavior of the money markets. Leonardo came to the United States from Italy to pursue a graduate education in economics. He received a Ph.D. from Princeton University in 1991 after completing his dissertation, ''Essays on International Capital Markets under Uncertainty.'' Leonardo joined the New York Fed in 1995 as an economist in the Foreign Research department and held various positions before being made a senior vice president in 2002. From 2000 to 2004, he served as head of the International Research division. For two periods in the 1990s-1990-95 and 1998-Leonardo worked as an economist at the International Monetary Fund. During his years at the IMF, he made significant contributions to the institution's work agenda, particularly in the area of exchange rate analysis, and published extensively in leading economics and policy journals. Leonardo was very modest about his own professional accomplishments, but he was quick to support and encourage younger economists beginning their careers. He inspired all of his colleagues at the IMF and the New York Fed with his integrity, intelligence, and quiet authority, and he was loved as a warm and generous friend. We extend our deepest condolences to Leonardo's wife, Jin, and his young son, Lorenzo. A memorial service will be held at 11am on Saturday, September 13, at the Tillman Chapel, Church Center for the United Nations, 1st Avenue and 44th Street, New York City. Donations may be made to the All Things Project of the Neighborhood Church of Greenwich Village, 269 Bleecker Street, New York, NY 10014. Timothy F. Geithner, President and Chief Executive Officer"

Like Earl Campbell before him, the quick, powerful tailback seems to be running way too hard, his fragile legs pounding the artificial turf like pistons. Injuries cost Peterson chunks of his three seasons at the University of Oklahoma, and even as a rookie last year, when he gained more than 1,300 yards rushing, a bum knee kept him out of two games. ''The only thing I can control is the hits I take,'' Peterson says. ''I've got to go down and avoid the big blows.'' This new strategy will come as welcome news to the Bears (who gave up 224 yards to Peterson in Week 6) and the Chargers (296 yards in Week 9). Peterson's other strategy for the new season: Avoid even the small blows. ''People forget I was a sprinter,'' he says. ''There aren't a lot of guys in the league that can flat-out outrun me.'' B.C."

Her work is in the permanent collections of the Whitney, Metropolitan, Art Institute of Chicago, the Victoria and Albert Museum (London), the Biblioteque Nationale (Paris) and many other public and private collections worldwide. Ms. Hoff was born (1910) and raised in Tulsa, Oklahoma. As a six-year-old she modeled small figures from the clay the well-drillers left behind. At 14 she won a silver medal in ''Free Hand Drawing.'' After two years at the University of Tulsa, she relocated to Chicago to pursue the study of art. She first found success with her edgy, figurative work while still a student at the Art Institute of Chicago in the mid-1940s; a one-man show at the Wildenstein Galleries in Paris (1955) brought international recognition. She moved permanently to NYC in 1960, where her more abstract collage paintings attracted immediate institutional and critical attention; ''The Crowd'' (1960), a 40'' x 30'' paper collage and acrylic on canvas, was purchased by the Metropolitan Museum of Art that same year. She would later exhibit with Betty Parsons. As artist-in residence she taught at numerous American universities as well as in China, Brazil, Lebanon and Uganda. She is survived by a daughter, Mia, of Edinburgh, Scotland. A memorial service is pending. (More information about Margo Hoff's life and career is available at MargoHoff.com.)"

''Out of all the countries I have visited, Lithuania has been by far one of my favorites. I got to enjoy a kayaking trip an hour outside of Vilnius and appreciate what the rural lifestyle had to offer. The trip was organized by a friend -- her family and friends, all amateurs to the sport came together to enjoy one another's company as well as the scenery and a barbecue. I was the newest to the group and therefore was instructed by Grandpa to make a wish and throw a coin over my shoulder for good luck. I think we were all united in a way after that. They assured me that Americans aren't known to come around that particular town, and I think there was a small effort to show me what we've all been overlooking. The scenery was beautiful, and we enjoyed the berries we found in the woods -- the cherries were sweet, and the blueberries reminded me of Maine. What I find is most important and most satisfying in traveling is getting to appreciate and absorb the common life and perspectives of the people rather than just their churches and monuments. I was shown their domestic humility and how much sweeter it makes their cherries.'' As told to J. R. Romanko"

There are moments when I can't believe I get paid to do this (tempered, of course, by moments when I don't get paid nearly enough to do this). This summer, there were more of the former. I worked with two students at their summer camps, and I worked weekends with one student at his family's country home. Summer seemed to have a superhero theme. Two girls showed up to summer camp dressed as Spider-Man and Batman for no apparent reason (other than the obvious cool factor). I played superheroes on the playground and blasted off with a (highly imaginative) student from the tip of the Egyptian pyramids into outer space. (Yes, my job is cooler than yours.)

2008-09-14T00:00:00Z,"RASMUSSEN--Arthur E., of Walton, 85, died at his home September 3rd after an extended illness. He is survived by his wife of 59 years, Joann, their children and spouses - Mark Rasmussen and Zheng Ping of London, UK; Will and Jane Rasmussen of London, UK; Kim Rasmussen and Glenn McGuiness of Bovina and New York City; Ann Rasmussen and Chris Cerf of Montclair, NJ and six grandchildren. Born November 2nd, 1922 in Englewood, NJ, Arthur studied at Middlebury College (VT), and the University of Chicago, completing his MA at sea while serving in the Merchant Marines. He later served as an officer in the Army during World War II. He acquired his MBA from Harvard Business School in 1947. He was awarded an honorary doctorate from Hartwick College in 1995. Arthur joined Booz, Allen & Hamilton, moved to Philco, then to Congoleum Nairn Corp. From 1957-67 he was Financial VP and Director of Avco Corp. He became President of Household International Inc in 1967 at age 45, retired from that position five years later, then served as its Chairman from 1972 to 1984. He also served on the boards of Amoco (Standard Oil Co.), Central and South West Corporation and Abbott Laboratories. He also served on the boards or their derivatives of a long list of not-for-profit organizations, including The University of Chicago, Northwestern University, Hartwick College (Vice-Chair), The Field Foundation of Illinois, Chicago Council on Foreign Relations, Adler Planetarium (Chicago), and the National Business Council for Consumer Affairs. Art and Joann moved to Walton in 1990 where he served as a Director of Delaware National Bancshares, National Bank of Delaware County, and State University at Delhi. He had real estate holdings in three states, and became founding director of the Catskill Center for Conservation and Development and the Delaware County Conservation Association. A major supporter and board member of the Institute for American Values, he helped bring the Institute together with the University of Chicago to form the Council on Civil Society. He provided startup funding for a degree in family support at the University of Chicagos Graduate School of Social Services Administration the first such program in the nation. Active with the National Association of Scholars, he worked to encourage more stress on liberal arts at American colleges and universities. He also served on the National Alumni Forum, working to improve governance on university boards of trustees. Arthur said his charitable work, after retiring from business, opened ''new vistas in the sunlit upland of life.'' Appropriately, he named their upstate New York property ''The Sunlit Uplands''. Arthur's greatest loves were his wife Joann, four children, six grandchildren, the great outdoors and poetry. He constantly challenged himself to master new subjects, aid numerous causes and inspire countless people. He made a fortune and gave it away. He brimmed with optimism, never looking back to regret. He taught us how to keep to our responsibilities. He challenged us to sharpen our thinking and focus our lives with his favorite question: ''What are your plans?'' A memorial service will be held to celebrate his life on Thursday, September 18th at The New Hope Community Church at 45 Stockton Avenue in Walton, NY at 11:30am. In lieu of flowers, donations should be sent to the Walton Fire Department."
2008-09-14T00:00:00Z,"I'm sorry, sir, but you should have been preparing for the booth long before you hung up those cleats. Despite the explosion in media outlets, the number of broadcast jobs available is relatively small (perhaps half a dozen new national TV gigs are filled each year), and the competition for them is brutal -- unless you're a future Hall of Famer. ''The Michael Strahans of the world get recruited when they retire,'' says Howard Katz, the N.F.L.'s senior vice president of broadcasting. ''Others have to do it differently.'' For them, the league offers the N.F.L. Broadcast Boot Camp, a three-day workshop that puts players through mock telecasts, as well as radio- and local-TVstyle interviews. Among the 2007 grads are former quarterback Tim Hasselbeck, now with ESPN; ex-Rams tight end Roland Williams, who will do analysis for CBS College Sports; and offensive lineman Ross Tucker, who hosts a show on Sirius Satellite Radio. This year's camp had almost twice the number of applicants, a trend the league expects to continue."

2008-09-14T00:00:00Z,"Could agility, speed, balance, rhythm and the ability to memorize complex patterns have something to do with it? We're not talking the O-line here, the guys whose job it is to impersonate a refrigerator, but wide receivers, defensive ends, running backs, cornerbacks, free safeties -- why not? When Jerry Rice, Emmitt Smith and Jason Taylor appeared on ''Dancing With the Stars'' and were obliged to master the rumba, the quickstep, the waltz and the pasodoble, they executed. (Smith, in fact, won in 2006. Taylor, pictured above, finished second earlier this year.) ''How can you be so light and so big at the same time?'' one judge marveled. Has he never seen a football game? Football is dancing, arranged around a ball. The parallels abound: plays (choreography), drills (exercises), footwork (allegro), the snap count (four for nothing), heart (heart). Like all metaphors, this one breaks down sooner or later. Ballroom dancing is itself a metaphor for love, whereas football is a (very tired) metaphor for war. Dancing goes for poetic effect, whereas football comes down to points and inches. Maybe the real surprise isn't that football players can fox-trot -- and do it well -- but that they dare to do it at all. The football player with the guts to risk abuse for taking up dancing has got to be confident in his manhood. Look at Lynn Swann, back in the '70s, going off to ballet class to improve his jump. A boy named Lynn."

2008-09-14T00:00:00Z,"1. Basic Instinct On the Patriots' first offensive play, the Giants diverged from the script, made several mistakes and still managed to put a hit on Brady, convincing themselves they could get to the All-Pro quarterback. The Patriots faked a reverse to wide receiver Wes Welker and attempted a screen pass to running back Laurence Maroney. On screens, offensive linemen typically block the defensive line for a few seconds, then release and head downfield to block for the receiver. Defensive tackles are expected to turn and follow them (A). But neither Barry Cofield nor Fred Robbins did. Robbins instead pursued Welker. Cofield, sensing a pass play, ignored Maroney and headed for Brady (B), using a ''rip'' move to shed left guard Logan Mankins (not shown). A rip is when the defender punches under the arm of the blocker and brings his own arm up, ripping the blocker's arm away. Cofield hit Brady (C) just after he released the ball, and the pass was incomplete. ''We got lucky,'' Strahan says. ''There are about five guys doing the wrong thing on this play.'' Cofield could see the surprise in Brady's eyes. ''Just his reaction, the way he got up,'' Cofield says. Notes Strahan: ''If they had completed this and gained 30 yards, we're on our heels. It's all about psyche.''"

Pettis of Maplewood, who was scheduled to do so, was unavailable."
2008-09-14T00:00:00Z,"You better believe it. And the reason is simple: players are bigger and faster than they used to be. How much bigger? Between 1970 and 2006, the average weight of N.F.L. players at every position increased (defensive tackles, for example, grew by 20 percent). Speed is a bit more difficult to assess, since there are no systematic records of 40-yard-dash times for N.F.L. players. It's reasonable, though, to assume that the percentage increase in player speed over this period was similar to the percentage change in 100-meter-dash times: taking world-record times in this event, we can infer that player speed increased 4 percent. Now let's focus on a collision between a running back and a linebacker, and analyze it according to Newton's Second Law of Motion. This basic law of physics tells us that the force of a hit is equal to a player's mass times the acceleration he feels as a result of the hit. Consider a running back who breaks into the defensive secondary and reaches top speed as he motors for the end zone. Unfortunately for him, he's blasted head-on by a middle linebacker who has also built up a full head of steam. They collide violently and fall to the turf. Newton's Second Law tells us that the force of this impact can be approximately three-quarters of a ton. (The scientific term for this is ''getting your bell rung.'') That force is proportional to the product of the player's speed and mass, if we assume a given time (about 0.15 seconds) for the duration of the collision. By factoring in gains in mass and speed, we can estimate that the force of a full-speed hit in the N.F.L. has increased by as much as 25 percent since 1970. Hence the cliché ''football is a contact sport.''"
2008-09-14T00:00:00Z,"Until last November, Jason Witten was living a nice, anonymous life on the obscure end of the Pro Bowl roster. Then he caught a pass against the Philadelphia Eagles. It was late in the game when Tony Romo hit Witten across the middle, just as two Eagles sandwiched him, snapping off his helmet. No matter. Witten ran 30 yards without it before being brought down. Suddenly the 26-year-old was a celebrity tight end, on a level of veneration reserved for Tony Gonzalez and Antonio Gates. In truth, a case can be made that Witten is the league's best tight end. He led the position last year with 96 catches for more than 1,100 yards. But what separates him from his peers (and endears him to purists) is his interest in blocking. He powered the Cowboys' running game with tough, in-line blocking, a skill he cultivated under the skeptical eye of Bill Parcells. On those plays, he prefers to keep his hat on. BRYAN CURTIS"

2008-09-14T00:00:00Z,"Champ Bailey of the Denver Broncos didn't play cornerback until he got to college at the University of Georgia, but nobody had to tell him it was the toughest position in football. He had studied Deion Sanders and Darrell Green, two of the best ever at the position. And another thing: ''I looked at how much money they made,'' says Bailey (No. 24, right). ''That tells you how tough it is.'' In Bailey's view, those men were the archetype of what is now arguably the rarest player in the N.F.L.: the shutdown cornerback. Because so many teams play zone defense, the cornerbacks' job is changing; he is less frequently asked to take on a receiver man-up, something that Bailey does to such devastating effect that opponents have been known to avoid passing to his side of the field entirely. In 2006, he had 10 interceptions and didn't give up a single touchdown."

2008-09-14T00:00:00Z,"Say this for Mark Bavaro's breezy debut novel, ''Rough & Tumble'' (St. Martin's Press, $24.95): It is undoubtedly the best work of fiction ever to begin, '' 'H slot out Z-Motion Sixty-two Semi Y-Hook Z-Flag on two, on two!' '' Bavaro, you may recall, was the New York Giants' All-Pro tight end during the latter half of the 1980s. Powerful, smoldering, blue-collar and deeply Catholic, he was custom-tailored for New York's gritty self-image, and now he has decided to stretch out and try his hand at writing a novel concerning a powerful, smoldering, blue-collar and deeply Catholic tight end for the New York Giants. Call it semifiction. Bavaro takes care beforehand to disclaim any real-world parallels with his story, which will surely disappoint those literal-minded readers wondering about the book's flashy, hard-living linebacker or its fascist but inspirational coach. The story follows one Dominic Fucillo through a purgatory of physical ailments and lost love and seedy incidents involving gamblers and compromised teammates and dialogue like ''Cuz I'm gonna take you with me . . . to hell!'' There are stops along the way for some grim moralizing about drugs and abortion. Time was, football novels were swinging, druggy affairs that captured the native humor of the locker room. (These books were often made into films starring Burt Reynolds's mustache.) Think Dan Jenkins's masterpiece of the genre, ''Semi-Tough,'' or ''North Dallas Forty,'' by Peter Gent. That was a different N.F.L., however. In those days, Jenkins would lose himself in a stewardess's cleavage. Perhaps it says something about today's league that Bavaro lavishes the same sort of loving detail on, of all things, a team meetin T.C. a giant of letters"

2008-09-14T00:00:00Z,"If the N.F.L. had a Museum of Natural History, the Green Bay Packers should, by all rights, be found alongside the Providence Steam Rollers in the extinctspecies exhibition. Green Bay's population of barely 100,000 makes it by far the smallest city in major-league sports. Thanks to its reputation for being too cold, too remote, too boring and too white, Green Bay faces enormous challenges in attracting players. And despite a record 12 championships, the Packers have endured extended dry spells that might well have destroyed their fan base. They don't even have a deep-pocketed owner: the team is the N.F.L.'s only nonprofit corporation, held by 112,015 shareholder fans, many of whom own just a single souvenir share. So how have the Packers managed to survive -- let alone thrive -- in the modern N.F.L.? The league's almost socialist revenue-sharing rules and the salary cap have certainly helped. But they don't account for the performance both on the field and at the bank: since 1993, the team has had the best regular-season record, and has built up a rainy-day fund of $127 million. Much of the credit goes to the business acumen of the team's seven-member executive committee and its recently retired C.E.O., Bob Harlan. Composed of prominent Wisconsin executives, the committee is chosen from a 45-member board elected by the shareholders. The board selects the C.E.O., while the executive committee approves major expenses and meets monthly to review football operations and finances. Both groups serve pro bono. The team is managed so well that, in 2003, SportsBusiness Journal named it the world's best-run sports franchise."

2008-09-14T00:00:00Z,"Here's the exact date the football commentariat began its infatuation with Mario Williams: Nov. 18, 2007. That day, the Guy Drafted Before Reggie Bush and Vince Young registered a sack against New Orleans. He had another sack the next week and two and a half sacks the week after that. In the final six weeks of the season, he notched a total of 10, a staggering Reggie White-type achievement. Williams, who had been plagued by injuries, was finally in possession of his gifts. He has a quick step toward the quarterback -- he runs the 40 in 4.6 seconds -- and, at 6-foot-7, the long arms for redirecting thrown balls. He spent the off-season working on countermoves, the kind of crafty gamesmanship that allows a defensive end to rely on something other than athleticism. Now we're wondering what Bush and Young will have to do to catch up to Mario Williams. B.C."
2008-09-14T00:00:00Z,"Three and a half seconds: That's approximately how long a quarterback has to decide where to throw the ball. How does he survey the options while a swarm of humongous, angry men seek to pancake him? It seems obvious: a quarterback needs to think, to look at each of his receivers and make a calculation. This is one reason N.F.L. teams put so much stock in the Wonderlic intelligence test, the theory being that quarterbacks who are better at algebra will make better decisions. Unfortunately, the theory is wrong. If quarterbacks were forced to contemplate their decisions, they'd get sacked every time, a classic case of paralysis-by-analysis. What recent brain research suggests is that quarterbacks rely on their unconscious; an experienced quarterback picks up defensive details he's not even aware of. Although he doesn't consciously perceive the blitzing linebacker, the quarterback's unconscious monitors his movement. When the QB glances at his receivers, his brain converts these details into fast emotional signals, so that a receiver in tight coverage gets associated with fear, while an open man triggers a burst of positive feeling. It's these inarticulate emotions, and not an elaborate set of calculations, that tell the best quarterbacks when to let the ball fly. In the pocket, it turns out, it pays not to think."

2008-09-14T00:00:00Z,"The man plays like a frustrated wide receiver. It's not just that Antonio Cromartie caught -- that is, intercepted -- a league-leading 10 balls last season (and 2 more in the playoffs). It's that he's prone to chase the ball with abandon. ''I feel like once the ball is in the air, I have to turn into the receiver,'' Cromartie says. He's great with the ball in his hands: his zigs and zags past stunned offensive players are now grainy staples of the YouTube canon. Last year, he picked off Peyton Manning three times in a regular-season game -- a first for any player -- and then picked him off again in the playoffs. He even returned an errant field goal 109 yards for a touchdown against the Vikings. Cromartie, 24, spent the off-season in unofficial ''two-a-days'' with Deion Sanders, the rare cornerback ancestor who also comported himself like a wideout. Sanders offered Cromartie his blessing. At this rate, it seems a little redundant. B.C."

Dr. Yuan was an Associate Professor of Clinical Dental Medicine at Columbia University College of Dental Medicine. Dr. Yuan was born in Taiwan (ROC) and had a brief acting career in the movies with a leading role in the Taiwanese motion picture ''Jade Love'' (1984). After he earned his dental degree at National Taiwan University and completed two years of military service, he came to the United States in 1988 for additional studies at Columbia University. Between 1988 and 2000 he specialized in Orthodontics, earned a Master's Degree in Dental Sciences, and a Ph.D. Degree in Anthropology. He joined the faculty of the College of Dental Medicine of Columbia University as Assistant Professor of Clinical Dental Medicine in December of 2000, where he assumed teaching responsibilities in human anatomy (for both medical and dental students), oral biology and orthodontics, while also continuing some teaching activities in anthropology. He also co-authored a major anthropological text, ''The Human Fossil Record, Brain Endocasts, The Paleoneurological Evidence.'' During his all too brief academic career Dr. Yuan became one of the most beloved teachers in both the medical and dental school at Columbia, as was evidenced by three Teacher of the Year Awards by the College of Physicians and Surgeons and the Edward V. Zegarelli Teaching Award by the College of Dental Medicine in 2008. His empathy for and devotion to his students were legendary. Even as his disease took its toll, he continued to meet all his classes to deliver his meticulously crafted lectures. Dr. Yuan is survived by his mother, Mrs. Li-Jiuan Wu Yuan (Tainan City, Taiwan), his sisters Grace and Susan, and their families. He will be remembered fondly by his many students, friends, and colleagues throughout the world. Ira B. Lamster D.D.S., M.M.Sc.

My opponents may disagree, but those fundamentals of the American worker, their innovation and entrepreneurship, the innovation of small businesses, those are the fundamentals of America, and I think they are strong. But they are being threatened today, those fundamentals are being threatened today because of the greed and corruption that some engaged in on Wall Street. We have got to fix it.

2008-09-17T00:00:00Z,"When we last tasted aglianico wines from Southern Italy in 2005, I remarked that they would complement all sorts of food, not just the specialties of their region.

At this tasting, Charles Scicolone and Chris Cannon, our guest tasters, mentioned lusty meatloaf with tomatoes, pizza Margherita and lamb grilled over wood as food they'd like to wash down with a bottle of aglianico. Thinking of grilling over wood and also of the barbecue that had come to mind years ago, I decided to capture what was left of summer with a mess of spare ribs, slow-roasted for succulence, then finished quickly on the grill with a soy and tomato marinade and glaze. I'm not a fan of packaged spice mixtures with some chef's name slapped on them, preferring to concoct my own. I used smoked paprika, ground cloves, salt and pepper for a spice rub. I also threw some soaked hickory chips on the bed of coals, to enhance the smoky allure of the ribs."

He was also a talented athlete and, at one point, was recruited to play semiprofessional football. As a child, Mr. Zarin showed artistic promise and was given his first easel by the St. Vincent de Paul Society. He continued to paint for his entire life, maintaining a studio wherever he lived and completing the last of hundreds of paintings just two months before his death. In addition to art, classical music was a lifelong passion. He held a special affection for Franz Schubert, whose music he once described as ''tears dipped in honey.''

A graduate of Fairfield Country Day School, the Hotchkiss School and St. Lawrence University, he was most recently self-employed as a financial computer consultant. Previously, he was Vice President of the Mandeville Foundation in New York City from 1985-2002. In that role, he helped support such diverse causes as The Sherman (Conneticut) Chamber Ensemble and the Andrew Glover Youth Program, an alternative-to-prison program in Manhattan. He was an active leader in many community groups: Naromi Land Trust (board, treasurer), Sherman Chamber Ensemble (board), Sherman Nursery School (board), Lake Mauweehoo Club (vice-president), Sherman Library (volunteer). He was also a member of the Yale Club of New York City. He was an avid guitar player and member of the Sherman Bluegrass Ensemble and other groups.

But those who don this highly technical sleeveless garment (alone or underneath a wetsuit) for an entire triathlon -- swim, bike and run -- aren't doing it to make a fashion statement or to fight crime. Not having to change twice during a race saves time, but early versions of this three-in-one garment, which emerged just over a decade ago, were considered far from über-apparel, said Walter DeNino, a former Olympic triathlete.

Steinway, on Thursday, September 18 in New York City at the age of 93. A great grandson of the firm's founder, Mr. Steinway was actively involved with the Company up to the time of his death, maintaining an office at Steinway Hall in Manhattan. Born in New York City in 1915, Mr. Steinway began his association with the firm as a factory apprentice in 1937 following graduation from Harvard. He rose through the ranks, becoming Factory Manager in 1946 upon discharge from the service, and was named Vice President in 1947. He served with distinction as President from 1955 to 1972, and as Chairman from 1977 to 1980. In 1980 he became a Consultant to the Company, a position which he held to present day. He married Polly Zinsser in 1944, who survives him, as does his sister Lydia Steinway Cochrane, and his five children. Henry Z. Steinway was a true piano man, and his familiar presence at Steinway Hall was our greatest treasure. An avid correspondent with curators, customers, Steinway dealers and celebrated artists through the years, Mr. Steinway enjoyed a perspective of the changing musical world that few in our industry will experience. Though his typewriter is silenced, our lives have been forever enriched by his personal warmth, his candor, and by his unwavering faith in the instrument that we craft. To Polly and to Lydia, his children and grandchildren and his extended family, we offer our love and our heartfelt condolences. He will be sorely missed.
