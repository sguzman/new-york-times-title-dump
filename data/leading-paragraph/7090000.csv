It is due to their generosity and keen vision for the future, that the Lang Research Center now serves as a national model of excellence for a research center established at a community hospital. Other hospital programs that were founded with the assistance of Mrs. Lang include: The Theresa Lang Children's Ambulatory Center in 1997, the Theresa Lang Pediatric Emergency and Trauma Center in 2001, and the endowment of the Theresa Lang Directorship for the Lang Research Center in 2007. For her enduring commitment to community health care, Mrs. Lang was presented New York Hospital Queens' highest honor, the Pacesetter Award, in 1996. Over the years she was a mentor and friend to the many people with whom she worked--the Board of Trustees, the Women's Auxiliary, hospital administrators, physicians and employees. Undeniably, Mrs. Lang's leadership has had a significant impact upon the hospital's programs that are available today for the people of Queens. On behalf of all of our trustees, administration, clinical leadership and medical staff, employees, volunteers and auxilians, we offer our condolences to her family, including her beloved husband, Eugene, her children Jane, Stephen and David, her eight grandchildren, and five greatgrandchildren. George F. Heinrich, M.D. Chairman Stephen S. Mills President and Chief Executive Officer, New York Hospital Queens LANG--Theresa. The trustees, faculty, students, and staff of The Rockefeller University community deeply mourn the loss of our cherished friend Theresa Lang, an esteemed member of the Board of Trustees for more than two decades. Terry Lang joined The Rockefeller University Council in 1984 and was elected to the Board in 1986. She was named an honorary member of the staff of The Rockefeller University Hospital, in recognition of her leadership as chairman of the Board's Hospital Committee. The Theresa and Eugene M. Lang Professorship, which Terry's beloved husband established in her honor, reflects their shared passion for scientific inquiry and belief that basic research can provide answers to the unsolved questions of human health and disease. Terry will be remembered for her numerous philanthropic and pro bono activities, including her service to hospital patients and their families as a volunteer in several New York medical institutions. She put into action her conviction that there is a natural kinship between biomedical science and medical care, and that each has much to learn from the other. As a philanthropist, as a knowledgeable advocate for physicians and their patients, as a dedicated trustee, and as an exemplary wife and mother, Terry made the world a better place. She will be greatly missed. Our deepest condolences are sent to Gene; their children, Jane, David, and Stephen; and her entire family.

Board of Directors LANG--Theresa, died peacefully in her sleep on June 30, 2008 in her New York home. Beloved wife for more than 62 years of Eugene M. Lang, she was the adored mother of and survived by, her children Jane, David and Stephen, their spouses Paul, Belinda (former) and Kristina; by her grandchildren Lucy, Daniel, Noah, Grace, Jessica, Benjamin, Joanna and Jacob; by her great - grandchildren Maitlynne, Alexander, Teddy, Thomas and Erin; by her great-nieces Charlotte, Lily and Daisy; by her sister-inlaw Barbara; and by many dear friends. Theresa-Terry as she was known-was a rare human being. Kind, sincere and generous, she represented the nobility of compassionate service, the sterling qualities of friendship and the profound meaning of family. Daughter of Albert and Lucy Volmar, she was born in 1918 in Greenpoint, NYC. She graduated from Jamaica High School in 1936 and, in 1997, at the age of 79, she graduated from Marymount-Manhattan College with a B.A. to which, as a Trustee of the college, she added an honorary L.H.D. degree early this year. The Theresa Lang Theater and the Theresa Lang Scholarship fund at MarymountManhattan will continue to recognize her cherished college relationship. Terry's lifelong commitment to volunteer service began in 1942, when employed as an executive secretary in a Long Island aircraft parts factory, she volunteered to serve as a nurse's aid on evenings and weekends at the Queens General Hospital, After the war, she transferred her voluntarism to the New York Hospital-Queens (then the Booth Memorial Hospital) and continued her service, uninterrupted by her marriage to Eugene in early 1946, throughout her life. She joined the hospital's Women's Auxiliary, became its president and since 1975, a hospital Trustee. This lifetime relationship is memorialized by the NYH-Q's Theresa Lang Emergency Pediatric Clinic, Ambulatory Pediatric Clinic, Auditorium and Center for Research and Education. In 1975, Terry joined the New York City Visiting Committee of the United Hospital fund, became its chair and, in 2008, was named Hospital Trustee of the Year. In 1986, she became a Trustee of Rockefeller University and chaired its Hospital Committee. She also served on the Boards of he New York City Opera, Roundabout Theater, and the Hunter College Foundation. She was a member of the Cosmopolitan Club.

The Justice Ministry defended the country's counterterrorism strategy but said there would be no official comment on the report itself."

At the outset of his JVC Jazz Festival concert he called up Charles Simic, the poet laureate of the United States, who read a handful of nocturnal poems. Later, for a second encore, Mr. Lloyd recited passages from the Bhagavad-Gita over a gentle drone. And during the pauses between songs he was a torrent of allusive patter, drawing on a fount of vintage hipster recollections. None of this is standard practice for a jazz performance. But then Mr. Lloyd, a tenor saxophonist and flutist, isn't a standard jazz musician, if such a thing exists. His career has been a curious study in elusiveness and fluctuation; Mr. Simic touched upon some of those cryptic qualities as he read a poem called ''Two for Charles Lloyd.'' (''Voice of solitude,'' he said. ''Voice of insomnia.'') But Mr. Lloyd, 70, gave his restlessness a tactile embodiment. His playing was vital enough to dispel any need for explanation."

Prosecutors said they planned to request and schedule a new trial in the next two months.

But where Mr. Broodthaers created a fictitious museum department from a single, powerful symbol, Mr. Onorato and Mr. Krebs offer a series of oddities and one-liners. Thirty-two crudely fashioned, quasi-representational assemblages are displayed on pedestals throughout the black-walled gallery. Included are a brown paper teepee covered with peace signs, a laptop computer made of Styrofoam and painted silver, an urn oozing a Play-Doh-like substance and a small figure urinating on a cracked mirror. Birds appear to be a theme, perhaps in deference to Mr. Broodthaers: one is roasted on a spit, and another is covered with white droppings."

Blame changing tastes or the march of time; either way it's hard not to wonder how Bill Charlap, a revivalist in his early 40s, came to assume the mantle of torchbearer. Many of the best living pianists from previous generations have slackened the pace or relinquished their fixation on the style. Barry Harris, above, ranks high among the prominent exceptions, which is one reason to take note of his engagement at the Village Vanguard next week. At 78, he's still a bebop pianist of the first order, with a style both sparkling and self-assured. And his loyalties have never wavered: his most recent album, ''Live From New York Vol. One'' (Lineage), was released two years ago with a track listing that includes bop chestnuts like ''Star Eyes,'' ''A Night in Tunisia'' and ''Woody 'n' You.''"

''I wanted to do something equally exciting but very different,'' said Jack Viertel, the series's artistic director. Based on the novel ''The Year the Yankees Lost the Pennant'' by Douglass Wallop, ''Damn Yankees'' is a Faustian tale about Joe Boyd (P. J. Benjamin), the ultimate baseball fan, who sells his soul to the Devil (Sean Hayes, in his New York stage debut) to be transformed into the young slugger Joe Hardy (Cheyenne Jackson) and help the Washington Senators beat those ''damn Yankees.''

2008-07-04T00:00:00Z,"Edmar Castañeda is a virtuoso, and a modern jazz musician in that he collects different musical languages of the New World and melts them together, fusing them with swing and improvisation. But he also does the same thing with instrumental approaches: he borrows the technique and sound of several other instruments and applies them to his own, which is a harp. He can turn a harp into a bass, a guitar, a piano and a hand drum. Of course, that's not meant literally, but it's not meant metaphorically either. Mr. Castañeda, now based in New York City, comes from Bogotá, Colombia, and his instrument is specifically the arpa llanero, used in joropo, the music of the plains of Colombia and Venezuela. It's midsize and wooden framed, with 32 strings, and at the Jazz Standard on Wednesday he had it amplified with electronic pickups -- one for the bass range, one for the rest, with the wires connected to two different amplifiers. He leads an unusual trio: harp, trombone (Marshall Gilkes) and drums (David Silliman). But then, any jazz group led by a harpist would be unusual."

It is with tremendous sadness that the entire New York Hospital Queens family mourns the passing of Theresa Lang, a longtime member of our hospital's Board of Trustees, charter member and past president of our Women's Auxiliary, and hospital volunteer. Mrs. Lang's dedication to hospital service began during WWII, when she served as a Red Cross volunteer nurse aid. It was then that she laid the foundation for a lifelong commitment to advancing health care accessibility and enhancing the health services available for the people in the borough where she grew up--Queens. Mrs. Lang and her husband, Eugene, helped New York Hospital Queens establish several significant programs, including The Theresa and Eugene M. Lang Community Health Education Center in 1984, which later evolved to become The Theresa and Eugene M. Lang Center for Research and Education in 1998. It is due to their generosity and keen vision for the future, that the Lang Research Center now serves as a national model of excellence for a research center established at a community hospital. Other hospital programs that were founded with the assistance of Mrs. Lang include: The Theresa Lang Children's Ambulatory Center in 1997, the Theresa Lang Pediatric Emergency and Trauma Center in 2001, and the endowment of the Theresa Lang Directorship for the Lang Research Center in 2007. For her enduring commitment to community health care, Mrs. Lang was presented New York Hospital Queens' highest honor, the Pacesetter Award, in 1996. Over the years she was a mentor and friend to the many people with whom she worked--the Board of Trustees, the Women's Auxiliary, hospital administrators, physicians and employees. Undeniably, Mrs. Lang's leadership has had a significant impact upon the hospital's programs that are available today for the people of Queens. On behalf of all of our trustees, administration, clinical leadership and medical staff, employees, volunteers and auxilians, we offer our condolences to her family, including her beloved husband, Eugene, her children Jane, Stephen and David, her eight grandchildren, and five greatgrandchildren. George F. Heinrich, M.D. Chairman Stephen S. Mills President and Chief Executive Officer, New York Hospital Queens LANG--Theresa.

Born in New York to Anna and Meyer Nitzberg, Theo (Teddy) graduated from Hunter College and worked in the biochemistry lab of Nobel Prize winner, Severo Ochoa at NYU. She met the love of her life, Dr. Robert Goldstein, while he was a resident in medicine there. They married in 1941 and she continued to work in the lab while he was overseas as a Navy medical officer. When he returned in 1945, they moved to Boston where she was active in progressive politics, chairing the Massachusetts state committee for Henry Wallace's 1948 bid for president on the Progressive Party ticket. As a result of these activities and her unwavering commitment to peace and social justice, she was called before the House Un-American Activities Committee in 1953. Her fiery defense of the first amendment right to freedom of association in that hearing was a major news story in Washington, DC and Boston. The family moved to New York in 1961 where Bob took a position as Professor of Medicine at New York Medical College. After several years as a homemaker, she went to work as a computer systems analyst until her retirement in the early 1980s. After Bob's retirement they moved to Seattle in 2002. She is survived by her sister Bernice, by her two children, Richard (Nanette) and Erika (Jim) and four grandchildren, Cody, Amelia, Maggie and Kate, and by her loving and devoted husband, Bob.

The death toll spiked even as the number of foreign troops in Afghanistan -- including 32,000 Americans -- approaches its highest level since 2001. But that many not be enough.

2008-07-06T00:00:00Z,"Most people focus on the beauty and glamour of the period setting, or the smoking/drinking/sexism that seems so ancient and yet is so recent, but the greatness of ''Mad Men'' (Alex Witchel, June 22) is that people are and always will be people. You can watch a Jane Austen adaptation or a Merchant-Ivory drama and get caught up in the costumes and paraphernalia, but in truth, the fascination lies in how little is different: We still hope and long, deceive and get caught. When the newlywed Pete Campbell (Vincent Kartheiser) says he thought marriage would be magical, but instead his wife is ''just another stranger,'' he is not some 1960 period oddity; he is speaking to all of our childish desires for fulfillment without effort. The characters of ''Mad Men'' are flawed, confused and compelling. Just like real people (but better-looking). DEBORAH LIPP Nanuet, N.Y. Ah, yes, I remember the ad agencies of the 1960s. For me and other African-Americans who were turned away by them, ''Mad Men'' isn't so fictitious. Armed with a degree from the University of Chicago, I knocked on door after door, and the excuse I heard most often was, ''Our clients might object.'' I wound up writing copy for the Sears catalog. HOSEA L. MARTIN Chicago The depiction in ''Mad Men'' of the dynamics between men (the bosses) and women (the secretaries) reflects the reality of being female during the years leading up to the women's-liberation movement. The offices I worked in as a young woman were rife with sexism, racism and anti-Semitism. Women were touched and leered at, and the only visible African-Americans were relegated to being the elevator operators and cleaning people. The highlight of each program for me, however, is seeing the Drapers eating off the same plates that I did as a child in the 1950s and early '60s. Nothing sets the time and place better than that.

2008-07-06T00:00:00Z,"PURA--Thomas R., 54, of Bedford Hills, New York, and Los Angeles, California, died unexpectedly on July 1, 2008 in Los Angeles. Tom grew up in Salinas, California. One of five boys raised by a single mother, Nancy Pura, Tom was an accomplished student and athlete. Every summer from elementary school to college, Tom worked in the Salinas lettuce fields. Although Tom was drafted by the Kansas City Royals after high school, he chose to accept a scholarship from Harvard. There his baseball experience culminated in pitching for Harvard in the College World Series. After beginning his Wall Street career at Lehman Brothers, Tom joined Salomon Brothers where he became its youngest ever managing director. In 1986 Goldman Sachs hired Tom as a partner in Fixed Income where he was a co-head of Liquid Capital Markets. Lisa Endlich in her book ''Goldman Sachs: The Culture of Success'', described Tom as ''a hard driving trader who would be widely emulated. A contender in the annual 'Iron Man' Triathlon, he would bring to the department a new intensity and a risky style of trading that was bolder and more aggressive than anything Goldman Sachs fixed income had ever seen.'' Since retiring from Goldman Sachs in 1993, Tom's priority has been his family. Tom took great pride in his daughter, Jennifer, now a senior at Wellesley, and his son, T.J., a nationally ranked junior tennis player. Tom recently produced ''50,000 Balls,'' a documentary on junior tennis which premiered in June at the Newport International Tennis Hall of Fame. Surviving Tom are his wife, Sara Weinheimer Pura; daughter, Jennifer Laura Pura; son, Thomas Jason Pura; two stepsons, Eugene and Adam DiBenedetto; mother, Nancy Pura; and four brothers, Roger (San Antonio, TX), William (Tampa Bay, FL), Michael (Stamford, CT), and Peter (Troy, NY). Tom will be remembered for his commitment to his family and friends, his generosity, his competitive spirit, his passion for life, and his loyalty to and encouragement of others. A memorial service is planned for later this month in Manhattan. Details will be made public when available. In lieu of flowers, the family requests donations be made to: Partnership for After School Education (PASE), 120 Broadway, 2nd Floor, New York, NY 10271 or Harlem Junior Tennis and Education Program, 140 West 143rd Street, New York, NY 10037."

2008-07-06T00:00:00Z,"PECHTER--Morton H., November 13, 1922 -June 24, 2008, a business tycoon and later Hall of Fame Underwater Photographer, adventure sports photojournalist, writer and book author passed away peacefully from respiratory failure. Morton Pechter was the last remaining member of the original Pechter Baking Company and Harrison Baking Company, wellknown for its Jewish Rye Bread and other baked goods products, serving the New York, New England, New Jersey, Pennsylvania area. The specialty of dark and heavy breads, pumpernickel and rye, and assorted bagels and pastries proved popular and the concern prospered. The bakery grew to over 1000 employees with hundreds of delivery trucks. Serving at various times as President, Treasurer and Secretary he was a brilliant, energetic, practical, motivating, detail oriented force ensuring the company's success. Starting with horsedrawn delivery trucks, they were one of the first commercial companies to change to the Edison Electric Truck. Thomas Alva Edison was present to give a personal send-off when the first of these trucks was put into service. Pechter's was also wellknown for its ''kosher for Passover'' line of products. Store shelves were filled with their ''kosher'' items at holiday time. Jews and non-Jews alike devoured their delicious Passover macaroons and chocolate nut brownies. Pechter was a graduate of Dartmouth College, Class of 1943, the Tuck School, 1944 and Harvard Business School. He served in the Army in WWII. In later years, when the Pechter Baking Company had been sold, Pechter turned to SCUBA diving and underwater photography, first as a hobby and later as a profession. His professional life as a photographer grew and he wrote and photographed for hundreds of magazines, joining the masthead designation on many. He became the ''Official Photographer'' for the SCUBA Industry for over 25 years; for over 16 years he was the ''Official Photographer'' for the Chris Evert Tennis Charities; for eight years for the Delray International Tennis Championships; for four years for the Air & Sea Show in Ft. Lauderdale, FL and was the photographer for ''Raffi on Broadway'' and several other Broadway productions. As a professional photographer, writer, SCUBA diver and lecturer, he photographed and wrote about the world's top tennis professionals, searched for sunken archeological and lost treasures, photographed the magnificent reefs, jumped from helicopters, flew in hot air balloons and gliders and investigated the deep ocean. He authored and photographed an award winning book, ''What's In The Deep?'' that was a ''Reading Rainbow'' designated book. It was the first children's book ever done with actual underwater photos rather than illustrations. Pechter's book is a science text in libraries and classrooms throughout the U.S. He also produced and photographed an instructional, photographic flyer for the Albuquerque International Balloon Fiesta. His photos appeared on many calendars and covers of magazines. He was recognized as an outstanding underwater photojournalist by New York Times art critic David Shirey, who stated that Pechter's photos ''reflect a technique, a specialized expertise and an aesthetic authority that gives us a new understanding of underwater photography.'' His many awards include: the 2003 NOGI for Distinguished Service from AUAS; the 2008 Diver of the Year from Beneath the Sea; Director's Award from the Balloon Federation of America; the Photographer of the Year from USCA. He was given recognition and honored by the United Nations Environment Programme, recognized by the U.S. Navy as an Honorary Deep Sea Diver, and awarded the ''Rambo'' underwater diver from the Police Department. He was honored with election to the SSI Platinum Pro 5000 group in recognition of making over 5000 SCUBA dives and his work within the industry. The North American Travel Writers Association (NATJA) awarded him top honors for several of his published pieces. He was elected a Fellow National member in the prestigious Explorers Club for his contribution to scientific knowledge in the field of geographical exploration. Pechter has been the featured speaker on several television productions, among them a special television production about sea and space including Michael Collins, the command module pilot for the first landing on the moon. Some of the more memorable TV shows he helped to film were Mr. Rogers Neighborhood, Kim Alexis for Good Morning America, Al Roker for the Today Show and Hugh Downs for 20/20. He was a founder of the Long Island Science Museum and its Executive Vice President. His photos and articles have appeared in Life, Time, Newsweek and Forbes Magazine. Pechter was a longtime member of Temple Beth Sholom in Roslyn, Long Island and a member of the Board of Trustees, sang in the choir and served as Cantor on many occasions. He was a charter member of DEMA, a member of the American Society of Media Photographers, the National Association of Press Photographers and the North American Travel Writers Association. He was a Life member of the National Marine Educators Association, a Founding member of the Historical Diving Society, a Fellow in the Academy of Underwater Arts & Sciences and a Fellow in the Explorers Club. Pechter had the unique ability to instill in others the same excitement and enthusiasm for life's wonders that he had. His obvious delight for the world beneath the sea was nurtured by his deep commitment to conservation and preservation of the underwater wilderness. He is survived by his wife of 58 years, Alese, and his children; Dr. Stuart and Madeline Pechter, Dr. Richard and Robin Pechter, Dr. Jay and Roxanne Pechter, Juris Dr. Todd and Christine Pechter and his grandchildren, Nelson, Wyatt, Joseph, William, Patricia and Diana."

2008-07-06T00:00:00Z,"O'NEILL--Cornelia Rockwell. Longtime Greens Farms, CT resident Cornelia (Connie) Rockwell O'Neill died on May 31. She was 88. A Minnesota native and the oldest of three sisters, Connie attended Smith College and the University of Minnesota. She served as an officer in the OSS in WWII. Following OSS training at ''the farm'' outside Washington, DC, she was stationed in London, and near the end of the war, in Paris. While in Paris, Connie witnessed French General Charles de Gaulle's triumphant march on the Champs E'lysee as that city was liberated from the Nazis. Before her assignment in the European Theatre, Connie met and fell in love with Bridgeport, CT born Charles O'Neill who went on to oversee the training and assigning of OSS recruited agents from various ''Joe Houses'' in North Africa and France. Because of operational security concerns, communication between Connie and Charles as to whereabouts and well being had to be undertaken through a code they concocted based on favorite poems. The couple was married in the American Cathedral in Paris, on August 10, 1945, some three months after V.E. Day. After the war, Connie and Charles moved to Laguna Beach and Santa Monica, CA where Charles worked as a writer in the film and TV business. Their first son Bracken was born in California, followed by three more boys -Denis, Christopher and Trevor, all of whom were born following the couple's return to Connecticut. Fluent in French and an accomplished piano player, Connie was active in her great friend Ruth Steinkraus Cohen's U.N. Hospitality Program in Westport, CT. In the 1960s and 1970s she hosted Thanksgiving and other holiday dinners for dozens of U.N. Representatives at her Turkey Hill home (one of whom later turned out to be a member of the KGB; it was unclear if he was aware his hosts were a pair of former OSS operatives). Connie had an ear for and a great love of good music. In the 1960s she was approached by a Westport friend to invest in a Broadway-bound musical. After playing the sheet music for herself, she agreed to invest a modest amount of money in a show which became ''Man of La Mancha.'' (A year later, one of the producers asked her to invest in his next musical featuring the same creative team. Connie played the sheet music and passed. Sometime later, that show opened and closed in one night). As a child in Minnesota, Connie enjoyed many summers at family cabins on Isle Royale, and later on the north shore of Lake Superior. Her father, Harvard S. Rockwell, was a grain elevator engineer, an amateur organ recitalist and bridge expert. Other Rockwell relatives were early discoverers and developers of the Mesabi Range as well as property owners in what is now the Boundary Waters wilderness region of Minnesota. More distant relatives were cofounders of Carleton College in Northfield, Minnesota. Connie raised her four boys in the 1950s and 1960s, chaperoned an endless string of little league and pee wee hockey seasons, and enjoyed sailing at the Pequot Yacht Club in Southport, CT. Over the years she hosted countless dinners for friends she and Charles knew from the often overlapping worlds of the OSS, entertaining, politics and literature. Visitors to Turkey Hill relished Connie's homegrown sorrel soup and the seafood dishes she prepared with freshly harvested clams and mussels from Long Island Sound -as much as the inevitably spirited conversations. Gardening -both for season vegetables and for the beds of beautiful irises, roses and peonies that ringed her Turkey Hill home -was a passion Connie enjoyed throughout her life, right up to this spring's lilacs. Her love of books and things literary led her to take a part-time job at the Pequot Library in Southport, CT, where she continued to make new friends with her intelligence, curiosity and keen sense of humor. Husband Charles died in 1997. Son Trevor succumbed to cancer in 2007. Sister Rowena Rockwell Langworthy predeceased her by a few months. Connie is survived by her sister Jean Rockwell Anderson, three sons, Bracken, of Fairfield, CT, Denis of Beverly Hills, CA, and Christopher, of Winston-Salem, NC, nine grandchildren, and numerous nieces and nephews. A private memorial service will be held in August. One of Connie's favorite stories about her wartime service was how as a 25 year-old OSS Lieutenant on a warm Paris spring day, she decided -with two girlfriends -to flaut military regulations and take a lunchtime stroll down the Champs E'lysee carrying rather than wearing their helmets. Arm in arm they marched, three representatives of what has been called this country's ''Greatest Generations,'' the sun in their faces (and on Connie's auburn hair), the war about to end, their lives stretching before them...only to slow down apprehensively when they spotted a couple of senior American officers strolling toward them. Technically out of uniform, they were busted -or not, as it turned out -by General Dwight D. Eisenhower, Commander of all Allied Forces in the European Theatre, and General Omar Bradley, both of whom greeted the young women with proper military salutes and broad smiles."
2008-07-06T00:00:00Z,"Noah Feldman's informative article (June 22) ignores a crucial historical fact that explains much about Western Europe's current dilemma with its Muslim immigrants. Great Britain, France and the Netherlands, until after World War II, ruled large colonial empires, concentrated in Africa and Asia, that included many Muslim subjects. These people, the ancestors of today's ''outsiders,'' did not ask to become colonials but were brought up learning the language and culture of their mother countries, abandoning much of their own culture for that of the mother country. For example, many of the far-flung countries once under British rule are now English-speaking and play cricket. That their descendants want to live in the mother country should be no surprise."

On Saturday, just after the museum opened, a former police officer evaded security guards and tore the head off the figure, which depicts Hitler looking grim and defeated seated behind a desk in a re-creation of his bunker. The incident has attracted widespread news coverage and commentary, including accusations that the museum’s decision to include a Hitler figure was in bad taste and was made only to generate publicity. A spokeswoman for Madame Tussauds told the news agency the statue would return to its place in the museum’s history section as soon as possible. “Adolf Hitler represents a defining moment in German history that cannot be denied,” she said, adding that the display was created “with sensitivity and respect.” The 41-year-old who was arrested, identified only as Frank L., told reporters that he came up with the idea over drinks with friends, who dared him to do it; he said he now regretted it. “I did not do it for money, nor for fame,” he told the online edition of the newspaper Die Welt (welt.de), “though I suppose I will now be famous for a while.”."

The episodes could include musical performances, comedy skits, games and taped segments, reminiscent of classic variety shows like “The Sonny and Cher Variety Hour.” The four broadcast networks each bid for the Osbourne project, which will be produced by FremantleMedia North America. Mike Darnell, the president of alternative programming for Fox, said he believed that variety shows were primed for a comeback. Mr. Osbourne, who rose to fame as the lead singer for Black Sabbath in the 1970s, starred alongside his family on “The Osbournes” from 2002 to 2005.

2008-07-08T00:00:00Z,"An appeals court has ordered a retrial for seven artists who hacked into a Czech television weather broadcast to show a fake nuclear explosion in the Czech mountains, The Associated Press reported. Members of the Ztohoven art group, based in Prague, admitted tampering with equipment so that viewers watching a live shot of the Krkonose Mountains in June last year saw a flash of bright light and a mushroom cloud rising on the horizon. In March the artists were acquitted of spreading false information, but the state prosecutor appealed the verdict. An appeals court in Hradec Kralove overturned the decision last week in a ruling made public on Monday, said Michal Strnad, a court spokesman. The court ordered a new trial but did not yet set a date. If found guilty, the artists face maximum jail terms of three years. The group claimed its project wanted to show how reality could be manipulated by the media. Czech Television called such stunts improper and said they could incite panic."

The Olympic hopefuls attracted just 5.7 million viewers from 7 to 9, while “Dateline” earned 7.4 million from 9 to 11. Meanwhile, a two-hour “Extreme Makeover: Home Edition” from 8 to 10 (6.5 million) buoyed ABC’s all-repeat lineup. ABC finished second in the 18-to-49 set but third in total viewers behind CBS, once again the night’s most-watched network. CBS drew the largest audiences early in the night with “60 Minutes” at 7 (8.1 million) and “Million Dollar Password” at 8 (7.5 million).

Born in Rome, Mr. Leoni-Sceti currently serves as an executive vice president at Reckitt Benckiser, which owns brands including Lysol and Woolite. In an interview on Monday, he said he believed that understanding music consumers was crucial to turning around the company. “Understanding where they will need music in the future, where they will go, how they will interact with it,” Mr. Leoni-Sceti said, “and try to position the company so that you are there first.”."

2008-07-09T00:00:00Z,"Less than a week after its deal with Shakira was confirmed, the music giant Live Nation said Tuesday it had signed the Canadian rock band Nickelback to a long-term worldwide contract for recordings, touring, merchandise and other rights. Nickelback, whose hits include “How You Remind Me” and “Photograph,” has sold more than 26 million albums around the world. The contract will cover three touring and album cycles, with an option for a fourth, according to the announcement. People close to the negotiations, who spoke on condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to discuss the details, said the deal was worth $50 million to $70 million. By signing Nickelback, Live Nation, whose main business is concert promotion, took another step toward expanding its role at the center of the music industry, the traditional province of record labels. Nickelback is the fourth act to sign a so-called multiple rights or “360” deal, and the company said it planned to sign up four to six acts within a year. Besides Shakira, deals have been made with Madonna and Jay-Z."
2008-07-09T00:00:00Z,"“World News,” the evening newscast on ABC, received its lowest measured ratings last week, according to Nielsen Media Research. The newscast, anchored by Charles Gibson, averaged 6.9 million viewers for the week of June 30, ranking second to “NBC Nightly News,” which attracted 7.4 million. The third-place “CBS Evening News” averaged 5.6 million. The audience was ABC’s lowest since Nielsen introduced its people meter ratings system in 1987. The record is largely symbolic, as it occurred in a traditionally low-rated week leading up to the holiday. (July 4 was excluded from the averages of the three newscasts.) But it underscored the declines that evening newscasts are experiencing more broadly. Three times this year, the CBS newscast set new lows in ratings among total viewers. For the last two weeks, “World News” has set new lows in the 25- to 54-year-old demographic that advertisers covet."

The two met in the 1990s when Mr. Burnett was trying to pitch an idea for a show that eventually became “Survivor.” Mr. Riggs then worked for Walt Disney and helped Mr. Burnett with contacts in the industry, and later helped arrange deals. The lawsuit says Mr. Burnett broke an agreement to pay Mr. Riggs 10 percent of his profits from several television series.

While fashion and beauty editor of Chatelaine Magazine, she hosted two hourly TV shows: one a weekly news broadcast for Canadian Broadcasting Corporation and the other, the first woman's TV afternoon show hosted together with Monty Hall, again for the CBC. In the 60s, she accepted a position in Rome as foreign correspondent for the Toronto Telegram. In the 70s she married Robert Chisholm O.B.E., and wrote under the name of Posy Chisholm. In the 80s her editorial territories enlarged to include all the major cities of the world. This time she was filing for the Toronto Sun as the Assistant Bureau Chief of Rome. During this period she was honored as a Dame of the First Class of the Sovereign Military Order of Malta for her work with Italian orphans. A private family service has taken place. A celebration of her life will be held on September 2nd at two o'clock at the Palais Royale, 1601 Lake Shore Boulevard West, Toronto.

2008-07-11T00:00:00Z,"'GOING PLACES (DOING STUFF)' Necessity breeds invention. Also, gas is expensive, and everyone loves a road trip. Thus was born ''Going Places (Doing Stuff),'' an artist-led group bus adventure and the newest project from the Flux Factory, an alternative gallery space. Since 2002 the gallery has occupied a former air-conditioning warehouse in Long Island City, Queens. But that building was recently sold, and now Flux Factory is being evicted, said Jean Barberis, a curator there. No future site has been determined. So Mr. Barberis and his team conceived a summer group show that required no space: they asked a half-dozen artists to create trips for visitors to take on a rented school bus. Adventure seekers don't know the destination; they are given only the name of the artist, the tour's title, duration and a list of supplies before they board the bus. ''We think of it as road trip as performance art,'' Mr. Barberis said."

2008-07-11T00:00:00Z,"'IL BARBIERE DI SIVIGLIA' This Rossini favorite is perhaps the opera world's most popular comedy and an inevitable box office hit. But Will Crutchfield, above, director of the Bel Canto at Caramoor series at the Caramoor International Music Festival, says audiences are not presented with music that a Rossinian audience would have heard. ''Il Barbiere'' is the earliest Italian opera to gain a permanent place in the repertory, he says, and thus went through more transformations than most works, with current performance practice owing ''a lot to the way later scores by Donizetti, Verdi and even Puccini influenced its interpreters.'' A new Bärenreiter edition supervised by the Rossini expert Philip Gossett, in which Mr. Crutchfield says ''outright errors in old scores'' are corrected for the first time, will receive its East Coast premiere on Saturday at Caramoor."

Instead of waiting for Fringe shows to come west, 59E59 Theaters is offering, for the fifth year, a chance to see a few of them here first in this festival, which offers a sneak peek at productions bound for Scotland. Among the offerings is ''7 Sins,'' written and performed by James Judd. The show is a comical look at his own life, one that seems reasonable enough in some aspects (he went to law school and practiced as a criminal defense attorney) and completely mad in others (his mother paid him to skip school, watch ''The Young and the Restless'' and later act it out for her).

New York has a proud tradition of offering outdoor performances of all kinds during the summer, but there is something about watching people dancing outdoors that feels particularly right.

And on Wednesday the Joyce Theater and the City Parks Foundation introduce ''Dance Out!,'' a free, five-day outdoor festival featuring three works that will be performed throughout the five boroughs. The event is part of the Joyce's 25th-anniversary celebrations, and the theater's director, Linda Shelton, should be congratulated for picking this intriguing bunch of European choreographers, fairly well known across the pond and almost never seen here. Michael Schumacher, an American choreographer who has danced with the Ballet Frankfurt and Pretty Ugly and has worked closely with the theater director Peter Sellars, will perform ''Dans le Jardin,'' an improvised dance set to live music by his frequent collaborator, the cellist Alex Waterman. Dominique Boivin's Compagnie Beau Geste presents a duet for the dancer Philippe Priasso, above, and, ahem, an excavator, all performed to Callas arias. (If this sounds unlikely, bear in mind that Mr. Boivin, a French choreographer who trained with Alwin Nikolais, managed some years ago to condense the history of dance into a funny and pertinent hourlong show, ''Dance, a History My Way.'')"

He first said don't be ridiculous, and then advised me to buy a seat on the New York Stock Exchange and work for myself. On December 28, 2007, he joined me on the podium as I rang the ''Closing Bell'' at the NYSE in celebration of my 40th anniversary. Jerry gave me this brilliant idea, and I have always given him the credit for being the Inspiration behind my success. I will miss Jerry -he was a unique and very special person. Muriel ''Mickie'' Siebert TSAI--Gerald, Jr., 79, resident of Manhattan and Rye, NY, died peacefully July 9, 2008. Beloved father of Christopher and Veronica. Caring grandfather of Vanessa O'Brien. Jerry was an enormously talented and successful businessman, serving as a Chairman, President and Chief Executive officer of several large publicly traded companies.

Jerry was born in Shanghai, China, on March 10, 1929, and attended St. John's Middle School and St. John's University. He came to the United States in 1947 and, after one semester at Wesleyan University, transferred to Boston University, where he earned both a Bachelor of Arts in Economics from the College of Liberal Arts and a Master of Arts in Economics from the Graduate School of Arts and Sciences in 1949.

At Fidelity he rapidly rose through the corporate ranks, ascending to Assistant Vice President of Fidelity Fund, Inc., to Vice President, to director and Executive Vice President of the company in 1963. In 1965, Jerry established the Tsai Management & Research Corporation and Manhattan Fund, which proved to be a huge success. The initial offering was planned for $25 million but the public's response was so enthusiastic that the fund was greatly oversubscribed and $247 million in shares were sold. He joined CNA Financial Corp in 1967 as President and served until 1973. Jerry was also Chairman of Associated Madison Companies, lnc., the cornerstone of Primerica's financial services business, He joined Primerica Corporation, then American Can Company, as Executive Vice President of financial services and as a member of the company's Board of Directors in 1982, when the company acquired Associated Madison in its first move into the financial services industry. He rose to Chief Executive Officer and Chairman, becoming the first ChineseAmerican to lead a company in the Dow Jones Industrials Index. He became the principal strategist in building Primerica's financial services businesses, which included the purchase of Smith Barney in 1987. Jerry was a devoted son, and regularly sought out his mother's advice before making a major business decision. For instance, Ruth encouraged him to join Primerica, despite his reservations, and then backed his idea of acquiring Smith Barney. He often said that her faith in him have gave him the confidence to succeed. From 1993 to 1997, he served as Chairman, President, and Chief Executive Officer of Delta Life Corporation, a life insurance; and annuity company. Jerry also served on the boards of several companies, including United Rentals, lnc., Sequa Corp., Zenith National Insurance Corp., Triarc Companies, Inc. Apollo Investment Corp., and Saks Inc.

The new plan stops short of steps that have been requested by some antismoking groups. One proposal that the studios have resisted is to put an automatic R rating on any film that depicts smoking. Paramount Pictures, Sony Pictures Entertainment, 20th Century Fox, Universal Pictures, the Walt Disney Company and Warner Brothers, all members of the Motion Picture Association of America, joined in the agreement. In a statement, Dan Glickman, the association&#8217;s chief executive, said the industry&#8217;s approach was to inform parents &#8220;about smoking depictions in films so they can make informed decisions.&#8221;."

2008-07-12T00:00:00Z,"Ending a yearlong experiment, the Seattle Symphony is cutting its concertmaster contingent to one from four. The orchestra said it named Maria Larionoff to the position after the players&#8217; union objected to multiple leaders. Last summer the orchestra&#8217;s music director, Gerard Schwarz, named a quartet of violinists, including Ms. Larionoff, to share the post, saying &#8220;it doesn&#8217;t make sense&#8221; to have one person, given the length of the season. On Friday Mr. Schwarz called the arrangement a &#8220;tremendous artistic success&#8221; but said Ms. Larionoff, the associate concertmaster since 1997, would take over. &#8220;The way she has embraced this new position speaks volumes about her remarkable talent and ability to lead the orchestra,&#8221; he said. Tom Philion, the executive director, said the other three players &#151; Ani Kavafian, Emmanuelle Boisvert and Frank Almond &#151; would continue to appear with the orchestra. Michael Crusoe, the leader of the union, said it had protested the four-concertmaster arrangement as a contract violation. Mr. Philion said the appointment, which was part of a deal reached with the union, would address their concerns."

In a statement on Friday, the Greek Culture Ministry and a spokesman for Ms. White said she had acquired the objects in good faith. The antiquities will be transported to Greece this month and exhibited at the National Archaeological Museum in Athens before being sent to museums in the regions from which they are thought to have been taken. One object is the upper part of a grave marker dating from the early part of the fourth century B.C. The lower part was found in the early 1960s in a legal excavation in Porto Rafti in Attica and is currently in the Vravrona Archaeological Museum. The two parts will be exhibited together. The other object is a bronze calyx krater dating from around 340 B.C. that Greek archaeologists say was probably found in illegal excavations of a royal tomb. Countries like Greece and Italy have waged an aggressive campaign in recent years to recover artifacts from museums and private collectors that they contend were looted. Ms. White agreed in January to return 10 classical antiquities to Italy."

Although that was less than CBS&#8217;s repeat of &#8220;CSI&#8221; at 9 p.m. (9.8 million), it was enough to compensate for the network&#8217;s low ratings at 10 with &#8220;Swingtown&#8221; (5.4 million). CBS averaged the most viewers but trailed Fox in the 18-to-49 demographic. Fox&#8217;s &#8220;So You Think You Can Dance&#8221; led the night in that group, even as it drew a more modest audience at 9 of 8.7 million total viewers. Fox&#8217;s &#8220;Are You Smarter Than a 5th Grader?&#8221; drew 7 million viewers but nearly overtook CBS&#8217;s dog show to lead the 8 p.m. slot among the 18-to-49 set. NBC was third for the night, as &#8220;Last Comic Standing&#8221; garnered 5 million viewers from 9 to 11.

The first, a comedy, was inspired by &#8220;The Washingtonienne,&#8221; a novel by Jessica Cutler, who wrote a blog about her sexual exploits when she was an assistant to former Senator Mike DeWine of Ohio. Sarah Jessica Parker, above, is the executive producer of the half-hour pilot.

2008-07-12T00:00:00Z,"It seemed like just yesterday that President Hugo Chávez of Venezuela was calling President Álvaro Uribe of Colombia a ''pawn of the American empire'' and comparing him to Don Vito Corleone, with Mr. Uribe lashing back by threatening to sue Mr. Chávez for the ''financing of genocidists.'' But the name-calling was put aside Friday when the two leaders met in Venezuela, trying to mend relations after months of bickering over issues that included Colombia's claims that Mr. Chávez tried to finance leftist guerrillas and Venezuela's ire over the possible transfer of an American military base to Colombia from Ecuador."

2008-07-12T00:00:00Z,"''Greatest American Dog,'' a new reality show on CBS, got off to a decent start on Thursday, leading most competitors with 9.5 million viewers, according to Nielsen's estimates. Although that was less than CBS's repeat of ''CSI'' at 9 p.m. (9.8 million), it was enough to compensate for the network's low ratings at 10 with ''Swingtown'' (5.4 million). CBS averaged the most viewers but trailed Fox in the 18-to-49 demographic. Fox's ''So You Think You Can Dance'' led the night in that group, even as it drew a more modest audience at 9 of 8.7 million total viewers. Fox's ''Are You Smarter Than a 5th Grader?'' drew 7 million viewers but nearly overtook CBS's dog show to lead the 8 p.m. slot among the 18-to-49 set. NBC was third for the night, as ''Last Comic Standing'' garnered 5 million viewers from 9 to 11. ABC lagged behind in fourth, with repeats early in the night followed by ''Hopkins'' at 10 (5.5 million)."

2008-07-12T00:00:00Z,"Six major film studios have agreed to include antismoking public service announcements produced by the California Health and Human Services Agency in the DVD releases of all new movies rated G, PG or PG-13. The move was announced Friday by the Entertainment Industry Foundation, a nonprofit group that has been working to reduce the presence of tobacco on screen and on film sets. The new plan stops short of steps that have been requested by some antismoking groups. One proposal that the studios have resisted is to put an automatic R rating on any film that depicts smoking. Paramount Pictures, Sony Pictures Entertainment, 20th Century Fox, Universal Pictures, the Walt Disney Company and Warner Brothers, all members of the Motion Picture Association of America, joined in the agreement. In a statement, Dan Glickman, the association's chief executive, said the industry's approach was to inform parents ''about smoking depictions in films so they can make informed decisions.''"

In the troupe's latest program, presented on Thursday at Dance Theater Workshop as part of the SummerDANZ series, Paradigm began with a bang: Kay Cummings's ''Stayin' Alive,'' set to the Bee Gees' disco hit of the same title. Mr. Solomons, Valda Setterfield and Mr. Williams, wearing hospital gowns and pushing IV stands, took shaky sideway steps across the stage.

2008-07-12T00:00:00Z,"''Foyle's War,'' the British drama commissioned by the ITV network to fill the void created by the departing ''Inspector Morse'' eight years ago, has lasted as long as the Second World War itself, the setting for the show's crime solving, but the tenure has hardly bred fatigue. The sixth season, which was seen in England earlier this year (and begins on Sunday on PBS as part of ''Masterpiece Mystery!''), had been slated as the last, but fans apparently refused to think in funereal terms, and the series's creator, Anthony Horowitz, has since discussed charging on. ''Foyle's War'' is exacting in its period details and outstanding in its personalization of political disturbance and fury. At the center is Detective Christopher Foyle (Michael Kitchen), shut out of the action on the front lines and sent to Hastings on the south coast of England to counter war's residual malfeasance: the murder, bribery and wretchedness committed by profiteers, the politically ambitious and, nearly as often, those whose psychological balance war has irreparably destabilized."

Robert Weltz, 415 Hot Springs Road., Montecito, CA TSAI--Gerald, Jr., 79, resident of Manhattan and Rye, NY, died peacefully July 9, 2008. Beloved father of Christopher and Veronica. Caring grandfather of Vanessa O'Brien. Jerry was an enormously talented and successful businessman, serving as a Chairman, President and Chief Executive officer of several large publicly traded companies. He was known as a highly gifted analytical problem solver and a skilled negotiator. His understanding of the capital markets was unparalleled, recognizing opportunities where others saw confusion. Jerry was born in Shanghai, China, on March 10, 1929, and attended St. John's Middle School and St. John's University. He came to the United States in 1947 and, after one semester at Wesleyan University, transferred to Boston University, where he earned both a Bachelor of Arts in Economics from the College of Liberal Arts and a Master of Arts in Economics from the Graduate School of Arts and Sciences in 1949. In addition, Jerry attended courses at the School of Management. Jerry began his distinguished investment career in 1951 as a security analyst at Bache & Company. A year later, he joined the Boston firm of Fidelity Management and Research Company, Inc., as a security analyst. After only six years, at the age of 29, he started the Fidelity Capital Fund, Fidelity's first public growth fund. He has been credited as one of the main initiators of the modern performance fund idea. At Fidelity he rapidly rose through the corporate ranks, ascending to Assistant Vice President of Fidelity Fund, Inc., to Vice President, to director and Executive Vice President of the company in 1963. In 1965, Jerry established the Tsai Management & Research Corporation and Manhattan Fund, which proved to be a huge success. The initial offering was planned for $25 million but the public's response was so enthusiastic that the fund was greatly oversubscribed and $247 million in shares were sold. He joined CNA Financial Corp in 1967 as President and served until 1973. Jerry was also Chairman of Associated Madison Companies, lnc., the cornerstone of Primerica's financial services business, He joined Primerica Corporation, then American Can Company, as Executive Vice President of financial services and as a member of the company's Board of Directors in 1982, when the company acquired Associated Madison in its first move into the financial services industry. He rose to Chief Executive Officer and Chairman, becoming the first ChineseAmerican to lead a company in the Dow Jones Industrials Index. He became the principal strategist in building Primerica's financial services businesses, which included the purchase of Smith Barney in 1987. Jerry was a devoted son, and regularly sought out his mother's advice before making a major business decision. For instance, Ruth encouraged him to join Primerica, despite his reservations, and then backed his idea of acquiring Smith Barney. He often said that her faith in him have gave him the confidence to succeed. From 1993 to 1997, he served as Chairman, President, and Chief Executive Officer of Delta Life Corporation, a life insurance; and annuity company. Jerry also served on the boards of several companies, including United Rentals, lnc., Sequa Corp., Zenith National Insurance Corp., Triarc Companies, Inc. Apollo Investment Corp., and Saks Inc. In addition to his business successes Jerry was a highly distinguished member of the community serving on a variety of philanthropic boards including the Boston University Board of Trustees and the Norton Museum of Art Board of Trustees. He also served as a trustee of the New York University Medical Center and School of Medicine Foundation Board. He was a member of the Board of Overseers of the Wharton School at the University of Pennsylvania. Jerry has been honored for his philanthropic and humanitarian work, receiving a Doctor of Humane Letters from Boston University in 2003. He received the Man of the Year Award from the Chinatown Planning Council of New York and the Boston University Alumni Award for Distinguished Public Service to the Profession in 1985. Jerry was an Associate Founder of Boston University, and served on the Board of Trustees for many years. He was a trustee emeritus at the time of his death. Funeral services will be held Saturday, July 12, 5pm, at Frank E. Campbell Funeral Chapel 1076 Madison Ave., New York, NY. TSAI--Jerry. Jerry was a major influence in my life. In 1967, I asked him what firm I could go to so that I would be paid an equal salary to what men were being paid. He first said don't be ridiculous, and then advised me to buy a seat on the New York Stock Exchange and work for myself. On December 28, 2007, he joined me on the podium as I rang the ''Closing Bell'' at the NYSE in celebration of my 40th anniversary. Jerry gave me this brilliant idea, and I have always given him the credit for being the Inspiration behind my success. I will miss Jerry -he was a unique and very special person. Muriel ''Mickie'' Siebert TSAI--Gerald. To a very very special friend and a wonderful man who did more for his friends than himself. Gerald Tsai will be greatly missed.

The orchestra said it named Maria Larionoff to the position after the players' union objected to multiple leaders. Last summer the orchestra's music director, Gerard Schwarz, named a quartet of violinists, including Ms. Larionoff, to share the post, saying ''it doesn't make sense'' to have one person, given the length of the season. On Friday Mr. Schwarz called the arrangement a ''tremendous artistic success'' but said Ms. Larionoff, the associate concertmaster since 1997, would take over. ''The way she has embraced this new position speaks volumes about her remarkable talent and ability to lead the orchestra,'' he said. Tom Philion, the executive director, said the other three players -- Ani Kavafian, Emmanuelle Boisvert and Frank Almond -- would continue to appear with the orchestra. Michael Crusoe, the leader of the union, said it had protested the four-concertmaster arrangement as a contract violation. Mr. Philion said the appointment, which was part of a deal reached with the union, would address their concerns."

2008-07-13T00:00:00Z,"WHILE much ado was being made over the sheer dress Kate Moss wore in Istanbul this summer (devout Muslims didn't find it so chic), it was her enormous gypsy earrings that caught our attention. After seasons of breastplate necklaces, chunky cocktail rings and bangles stacked up the arm, statement earrings were due a fashion moment. Alber Elbaz accessorized his jewel-tone dresses at Lanvin with jangly earrings and slicked-back hair. And Miuccia Prada showed huge crystal ones in her resort collection. But leave it to La Moss, who has since worn them around London, right, to initiate a trend. She certainly put see-through dresses on the map. Erickson Beamon earrings, $393 at Curve; (212) 966-3626."

At the Riverview Elementary School in Denville last year, it was in the gym. While watching children climb a rope, she was inspired to write ''Horrible Harry and the Valentine Rope,'' to be published by Penguin next year as the latest in the 22-book series, which has sold more than four million copies."

He is survived by his beloved partner, Andy Wilcox; his loving mother Joan Cowen Bowman and siblings Jonathan Bowman, Derrik (and Margie Pivar) Hoitsma, Jim Hoitsma (and Pam Callander), Lisa (and Attilio) Hoitsma Favorini, and Teke (and Kristie Ramirez) Hoitsma; adored nephews and nieces Jasper and Sheyna Hoitsma, Jovi Federici, Cruz and Pilar Hoitsma, Sam, Katy and Molly Fulton; aunts and uncles Jim and Katie Peterson, Roberta Bell, Sue Porter and Constance Cowen; many cherished cousins and friends. He was predeceased by his father, Michael Edward Bowman, Sr., and uncle Edwin A. Cowen, Jr. Bo graduated from Trinity-Pawling School in 1986; attended Vassar College and graduated from Sarah Lawrence College in 1993. He was employed by MAC Cosmetics and also worked as a freelance make-up artist in the metropolitan area. Bo will always be remembered for his wacky sense of humor, unique interpretive dancing, ebullient writing and rampant creativity. His greatest gift was making everyone with whom he came into contact feel special. Bo was the kindest, most adorable, fun-loving, creative, loving man who has ever graced Manhattan (and Brooklyn). We have lost our spark. In lieu of flowers, please send donations to MAC AIDS Fund, 130 Prince St., New York, NY 10012. A celebration of his life will take place on August 23rd in Manhattan.

She was 61 years old. Edie received her B.A. at Simmons College, her Ed.M. at Boston University and her J.D. from Northeastern University School of Law in 1983. She served as General Counsel in the Executive Office of Human Services in the Dukakis administration, and was a trust and estate attorney at Palmer & Dodge LLP. After many years as a lawyer, Edie enrolled in theological studies where her passion for interfaith dialogue helped spark joint initiatives between seminary and rabbinical students at Andover Newton Theological School and Hebrew College. After the events of 9/11 Edie felt called to do something to mitigate the misunderstanding and fear between Jews, Christians, and Muslims. This prompted her to form a woman's interfaith book group called the Daughters of Abraham, which has now become a national movement with groups all over the country. Edie was also a trustee of the American University in Cairo, and a board member and former co-chair for Massachusetts Advocate for Children. Plans are being made for a service at Andover Newton Theological School in the fall, to honor her life and work. Contributions may be made to: the Daughters of Abraham through the First Church in Cambridge, Congregational, 11 Garden St., Cambridge 02138, memo line: Daughters of Abraham; or to the Andover Newton Interfaith Fund at the Andover Newton Theological School, Attention Priscilla Deck, 210 Herrick Road, Newton, MA 02459."

2008-07-13T00:00:00Z,"A WHILE back, Naomi Johnson, a communications professor at Longwood University in Virginia, sent me her doctoral thesis, which she described as a feminist analysis of the new wave of teenage romance novels. I don't read lots of dissertations, and almost tossed this one when the words ''ontological,'' ''objectivist'' and ''constructivist'' appeared in the same sentence, on Page 38. But I kept at it, because one of the series for teenagers that Dr. Johnson analyzed was the best-selling ''Clique'' books, which my 14-year-old daughter, Annie, loves and we buy the moment the newest one hits the bookstore. As others have, Dr. Johnson questions the female characters' preoccupation with looks, thinness, fashion, makeup, wealth -- we're talking spoiled, rich middle-school girls from Westchester County. But what grabbed me as new was her documentation of what she called the ''incessant litany of brand names.'' She examined three series, with combined sales of 13.5 million -- ''Clique,'' ''Gossip Girl'' and ''A-List'' -- and found, on average, there was more than one brand mentioned per page, 1,553 brand mentions in 1,431 pages of the six books she had read."

2008-07-14T00:00:00Z,"The Honest Jon's Revue started with more than two dozen musicians walking on stage. This made a good minute of theater: there were musicians from Mali, sitting down to ancient and modern instruments, from a one-stringed fiddle to an electric guitar. There were Americans too: among them a brass band, a folk singer and a soul singer. There were a few British hipsters too. But more to the point, they all stayed there, through the whole of Saturday night's concert. The standard strategy for a polystylistic, multicultural concert in New York City -- the kind of thing that flourishes in the summer's high-minded festivals -- is that one act clears out before another appears. It's assumed that the audience can take only one or two cultures at a time. But this was the opposite, a planned ruckus."

2008-07-14T00:00:00Z,"For all the drama, for all the frustration, for all the underachieving the Mets went through in their first 95 games, they are going into the All-Star break just a half-game out of first place. The same team that started the season under a shower of boos from its fans, behind the same pitcher who started the year with six losses in eight decisions, extended its winning streak to nine games Sunday night with a swaggering 7-0 defeat of the Colorado Rockies at Shea Stadium. The shutout was the Mets' fourth in six games, and the bullpen's scoreless-innings streak reached 19. The Rockies did, however, have seven hits, the first time since last Monday that a Mets opponent had more than three."

Players primarily from the Dominican Republic and Venezuela, who are not subject to baseball's amateur draft, have traditionally paid portions of their bonuses to local baseball insiders -- called buscones -- who help them be seen by scouts. But the F.B.I. is investigating whether some major league club officials paid the players small fractions of the bonuses they reported to Major League Baseball and kept most of the difference."

2008-07-14T00:00:00Z,"The call he will never forget came for Peter Ueberroth in the middle of the night on May 12, 1984, over a crackling phone line from Beijing. It carried the news he believed would determine the fate of the Olympics, not just the Games he was working to organize in Los Angeles that summer but all the ones beyond. At the other end of the line was Charles Lee, the man he had sent to persuade the Chinese to send their team to the Olympics for the first time. Ueberroth, the leader of the Los Angeles organizing committee, was asking China to defy a Soviet Union-led boycott that was announced four days earlier. The Soviets said the boycott would keep 100 countries away from the '84 Games. If the Soviets succeeded, Ueberroth said flatly, ''we were done.''"

The unlikely supporting player in the episode was Cisco Systems, which wanted to show off its TelePresence videoconferencing system. Cisco's on-air cameo may seem puzzling to viewers more familiar with product placements for soft drinks or cars (who would rush out to buy a complex computer system after seeing it on CSI?), but the placement resulted from careful deal-making by the company's entertainment agency, Davie Brown Entertainment, with CBS and the show."
2008-07-14T00:00:00Z,"ZIARAT, Pakistan -- The mountain of white marble shines with such brilliance in the sun it looks like snow. For four years, the quarry beneath it lay dormant, its riches captive to tribal squabbles and government ineptitude in this corner of Pakistan's tribal areas. But in April, the Taliban appeared and imposed a firm hand. They settled the feud between the tribes, demanded a fat fee up front and a tax on every truck that ferried the treasure from the quarry. Since then, Mir Zaman, a contractor from the Masaud subtribe, which was picked by the Taliban to run the quarry, has watched contentedly as his trucks roll out of the quarry with colossal boulders bound for refining in nearby towns."

One person involved in the case on the Tiffany side told me at the time that 95 percent of everything on eBay that was supposedly made by Tiffany was, in fact, fraudulent.) I hope they don't party too hard at eBay not only because Tiffany is sure to appeal but also because it has lost three similar cases in Europe, brought by Rolex, Hermes and Louis Vuitton. No, the real problem here stems from eBay's attitude toward its customers: namely, the site had no real responsibility toward rectifying wrongs -- of any sort -- that occur during an eBay transaction."

The business that Mrs. McCain's father started a half-century ago, Hensley & Company, is the exclusive wholesaler of Budweiser, Bud Light and other Anheuser-Busch products in the Phoenix area, and the third-largest Anheuser-Busch distributor in the nation, with more than $300 million in yearly sales.

It is a space that holds the world's largest collection of ants, some 14,000 species.

He steamrolls any incipient skepticism about the ant's uniqueness -- the new species is a living coelacanth of ants, a primitive throwback to the first ant, a wasp that shed its wings and assigned all its descendants to live in earth, not their ancestral air. The new ant is so alien, Dr. Wilson explains, so unlike any known to earthlings, that it will be named as if it came from another planet."

Justin Fox had already suggested that Fannie/Freddie were taking the place of the savings and loans, after the crisis of the 1980s. Well, if I'm reading this data (xls) right, that's pretty much the whole story.

2008-07-16T12:22:10Z,"In much of Europe, the Old Town is the only town that matters. Centuries-old stone houses, crammed into shoulder-width alleyways that swerve at random and wind uphill toward ancient churches dedicated to forgotten saints - this is, to many of us, what Europe is all about. But Old Towns often give me pause: Will the quaintness mask a lack of vitality? Is it a museum for tourists, or a place where locals live, work and play? And if the Old Town is boring, will the New Town - the less-densely populated, less charming sprawl outside the medieval city walls - be any better?"

2008-07-16T11:59:38Z,"I cannot possibly write about grilling lamb -- as I do in today's Minimalist column -- without including this all-time favorite. As I point out in the column, shoulder is the best cut of lamb for skewering; its fattiness keeps it moist. But for a big, impressive piece of meat, you can't beat boneless leg. And because of its uneven thickness, you can get rare, medium, and even well-done meat on the same piece; and even well-cooked lamb is delicious."

Since Mick had me thinking about the vagaries of market valuation, and since the stock market closed below 11,000 yesterday on continued worries about housing and inflation, I headed to Amazon and shot fish in a barrel: I looked for ""Dow 36,000,"" the 2000 book by James Glassman and Kevin Hassett that was seen as propagandistic hype even when it was published, at the height of the tech bubble. On the day it was released, the Dow closed at 10,681.06. That's essentially the same as yesterday's close, and substantially higher once you adjust for inflation. So there's a little thrill of schadenfreude in seeing that used copies of the book are available starting at 47 cents."

'' Instead the network has pilfered from NPR, spinning the popular radio program ''Car Talk'' into a half-hour of television every Wednesday. The series is called ''Click & Clack's As the Wrench Turns,'' and stars graphically rendered versions of the famous Click & Clack brothers, Tom and Ray Magliozzi of Cambridge, Mass., who have been solving carburetor and girlfriend problems on their national radio program for over a decade. (Other titles the Magliozzis considered: ''Transmission Impossible'' and ''Ken Burns Presents Car Talk.'') The Magliozzis, with their distinctively nonpatrician Boston enunciations (nozzle is ''NAU-zel''), provide the voices, and from there the comedy flows. They could say ''exhaust fan'' and nothing else, and still you would feel inclined to laugh.

When both polar ocean ice sheaths are tracked together, this year is back below the quarter-century sea-ice average again.United States Climate ImpactsThe Bush administration's Climate Change Science Program has issued the detailed draft of its report on impacts of human-caused climate change and is now seeking public comments before the final version is produced later in the year. The straightforward descriptions stand in stark contrast to those in government reports on climate science earlier in President Bush's tenure, when Phil Cooney, the former head of the oil industry's ""climate team,"" was the White House editor of such documents. At the time, the passage, ""Warming will also cause reductions in mountain glaciers,"" was excised along with other passages described as ""speculative findings/musings."" Mr. Cooney moved on to Exxon Mobil."

2008-07-17T12:35:01Z,"It's easy to deride celebrity perfumes. Writing about his friendship with Robert Redford in The New Yorker, James Salter said that ""when I went into restaurants with Redford, eyes turned to watch as we crossed the room - the glory seems to be yours as well."" But celebrity came with a cost; Salter remembered Redford's saying of movies: ""My presence in something is enough to give it an aura of artificiality."" If people buy celebrity perfumes, it is precisely because the glory seems to be yours as well. Yet the celebrities don't make the perfumes; professional perfumers do. Celebrity inexorably lends an aura of artificiality, and not just to the celebrity scent; it extends to us as well. We are, at best, torn.The fact of the matter is that some celebrity perfumes are just as good as those from fashion designers. Others are better. We often forget that a designer's name on a scent is no more logical than that of a 20-year-old singer/actress. Before Gabrielle Chanel claimed perfume for fashion designers in 1921, it had been the exclusive territory of perfumers (see: Guerlain, Daltroff, Coty). If fragrance is now to be given to Hilary Duff - whose Wikipedia entry includes the music genre ""bubblegum pop"" - and her colleagues, so be it. Scents should be judged by the art form's standard criteria: structure, quality of the raw materials, persistence on skin and diffusion, innovation, beauty."

It is the Solstice Sunglass Boutique chain -- not Safilo, which is Solstice's parent company. Because of editing errors, the article also misstated two statistics provided by Marshal Cohen of the NPD Group, a market research firm. The average price of handbags has declined 14 percent over the last year; handbag sales did not decline 14 percent but, in fact, increased 6 percent for the first five months of this year compared with the same period in 2007. And the $3 billion figure for total sales over the last year referred to sunglasses, not the overall eyewear market.

2008-07-17T00:00:00Z,"DONNELLEY--Strachan . Sarah Lawrence College deeply mourns the loss of Strachan Donnelley, whose many contributions to the College community will be remembered for years to come. He served on the Board of Trustees from 1981-1989 and was named Honorary Trustee in 1994. One of the College's most generous benefactors, he supported student financial aid and the construction of new campus buildings, including the country's first LEED certified visual arts center. His passion and devotion to environmental ethics helped to inform and inspire his fellow Trustees, raising the College's environmental consciousness and commitment to sustainability. We extend our heartfelt condolences to his wife, Vivian, their five daughters, and his sister, alumna of the College and former trustee, Laura Donnelley. John A. Hill, Chairman of the Board Karen R. Lawrence, President DONNELLEY--Strachan. The Board and Staff of the Center for Humans and Nature are deeply saddened by the death of the Center's Founder and President, Strachan Donnelley, Ph.D. (1942-2008). Strachan combined several vocations as a writer, an educator, and a builder and supporter of organizations in service to the common good. He was at once a conservationist, philanthropist, and philosopher; and he was also a man of remarkable love, dedication, and care for his family, friends, and colleagues. Fly fishing and music were Strachan's passions and Verdi's Requiem, his anthem. He spent his life ardently pursuing an understanding of the appropriate relationships between humans and nature. He came to see humans as utterly dependent on nature and argued forcefully against setting human beings apart from the natural world. He drew many of his own insights not only from the life sciences but also from the study of the history of philosophy, and in particular his work with his mentor, Hans Jonas, at the Graduate Faculty of the New School for Social Research. After working for many years at The Hastings Center and serving as its second President from 1996-1999, Strachan founded the Center for Humans and Nature in 2003. He gave that organization the vision and financial support necessary to extend the work of collaboration and open intellectual exploration of fundamental ideas and values. We are grateful to him, have been graced by our association with him, and stand ready to carry on and extend the work he began. As a philanthropist Strachan supported numerous civic and educational organizations. He served on several boards of trustees, including those of the New School University, the University of Chicago, the American Museum of Natural History's Center for Biodiversity and Conservation, the Rehabilitation Institute of Chicago, the Yale Institute for Biospheric Studies, and the Land Institute. He also served on the Board of the foundation created by his parents, the Gaylord and Dorothy Donnelley Foundation, and was Chairman of the Board from 1992 to 2003. We extend our condolences to Strachan's wife Vivian; his five daughters, Inanna Donnelley, Naomi Donnelley, Aidan Donnelley Rowley, Ceara Donnelley Berry, and Tegan Donnelley, and five grandchildren; his brother, Elliott; sister Laura; and the rest of his family. A public memorial gathering will be held at the Art Institute of Chicago at 10am on Saturday July 19 and a second memorial gathering will be held in New York. Gerald Adelmann, Chairman Brooke Hecht, Acting President Center for Humans and Nature"

Silverstein over moving its headquarters to one of the new office towers planned for ground zero. The company's decision is a major setback for the Port Authority and Mr. Silverstein, who had hoped to revive commercial interest in the 16-acre site by luring Merrill as an anchor tenant for one of the four office towers to be built there. Merrill was one of the first private companies to express strong interest in any of the towers. Concerns about stirring memories of 9/11 and the long-term noise and construction at the site have discouraged potential tenants, state officials say."

2008-07-17T00:00:00Z,"The musicians of the Columbus Symphony Orchestra, which has been on the edge of shutting down for lack of money, are standing by their music director. The orchestra's board of directors made what it called a last-ditch contract offer that reduced a previously proposed pay cut of 40 percent to 27 percent, The Columbus Dispatch reported on Tuesday. One of the conditions, though, would have been the firing of the music director, Junichi Hirokami, and using his salary for the extra pay, according to the Dispatch report, which was confirmed Wednesday by Tony Beadle, the orchestra's executive director. The musicians rejected the offer, though the two sides remain in mediation. Mr. Hirokami has been an outspoken critic of the board. Mr. Beadle has said that the conductor failed to spend enough time in Columbus to help with fund-raising or to tend to the orchestra. Some orchestra members countered that Mr. Beadle himself had not settled down in Columbus, maintaining his home and family in Boston. ''I'm here seven days a week,'' Mr. Beadle responded, saying that he returns on weekends only when there are no concerts, and that his family is in Boston for personal reasons. ''I don't think anybody would have seen less of me or more of me if my family were here,'' he said."

In a country where few people have guns or access to them, a spate of knife attacks, many involving teenagers, has forced the issue to the top of the domestic agenda. The Metropolitan Police are so concerned, they said recently, they have made knife crime their top priority, along with terrorism. Government and law enforcement officials are scrambling to produce plans to allay public fears."

When Justin Morneau slid across the plate in the 15th inning and the umpire Derryl Cousins gave a demonstrative safe sign at 1:37 a.m. Wednesday, the American League had beaten the National League, 4-3. Again. There was excitement and relief throughout the Stadium, especially in the suite where Commissioner Bud Selig was sitting and no longer sweating."

Eddie Vedder, the lead singer of Pearl Jam, would not; nor would Sean Penn, one of the evening's celebrity presenters. But walk, Roger Daltrey and Pete Townshend, the surviving original members of the Who, would. Yet after 40 years and about 100 million records sold, the Who weren't exactly red-carpet naturals. Mr. Townshend, 63, seemed amused when photographers asked him to pose with Rainn Wilson, star of ''The Office.'' Mr. Daltrey, 64, sans an assistant, lugged his stage clothes in a plastic shopping bag. ''I carry my own bag,'' he told a reporter as he made his way."

It was the first of Mr. Joel's two ''Last Play at Shea'' shows, which are to be the final concerts there before it is demolished. Mr. Joel played to two kinds of local pride. ''This is where New York meets Long Island,'' he said with a smile. ''Queens -- politically, that's New York City. But geographically, we are on Long Island.''

Dignity may be the chief trait of this Cinderella, heroine of a modern-dress production from Youth on Target, whose publicity material says it draws on Italian traditions. Yet this whimsical, partly improvised retelling seems most suited for the era of ''Sex and the City.'' (Don't worry; no traces of Samantha.) The Fairy Godmother (Sierra Marcks) narrates in a Carrie-esque voice-over, introducing Cinderella's mother (Christina Zagarino), a newly widowed careerist who is the Prince's assistant, and her older daughters, Margaret (Caitlin Heibach) and Gertrude (Sarah Bellantoni).

Limbaugh, among other things, claimed Democrats concerned about Darfur were merely courting the black voting bloc; said this year, “Democrats will bend over, grab the ankles and say, ‘Have your way with me’ ” to African-Americans and gays; claimed Senator Barack Obama’s “only chance of winning is that he’s black”; labeled Obama “an affirmative-action candidate”; and, according to The Washington Post, “often played ‘Movin’ on Up’ when referring to Carol Moseley Braun.” Chafets writes that “serious people” have called Limbaugh “a serial liar,” without actually citing the abundant evidence. For example, after calling service members who support U.S. withdrawal from Iraq “phony soldiers,” Limbaugh vehemently denied he had done so and, to refute the charge, played a spliced audio clip of his comments, while falsely claiming he was providing the “entire” segment at issue."

First, with a mere three days in a city rich with art, culture, religion and food, why would anyone waste their time at strip clubs or buying porn? But more disturbing, why would The Times advocate visiting a part of the city that profits from the sex trade, a business that exploits men, women and children?

The officers, board, supporters and staff of the American Technion Society (ATS) deeply mourn the death of Sergeant Major Ehud Goldwasser of the Israel Defense Forces (IDF), who was brutally abducted along with IDF soldier Eldad Regev by Hezbollah two years ago. Ehud was a brilliant graduate student in the Faculty of Aerospace Engineering at the Technion-Israel Institute of Technology. He was married to Karnit Goldwasser, who recently received her master's degree from the Technion, for only 10 months before his death. Ehud and Karnit planned to receive their graduate degrees together, in what would have been a joyful milestone in their history of love coupled with hard work.

2008-07-20T00:00:00Z,"HIGH school can be hard to shake. Some people never make it out of the cafeteria; they're still trying to find the cool kids' table. With ''American Teen,'' opening nationwide on Friday, Nanette Burstein can claim a certain expertise on the subject. This movie earned her the documentary directing award at this year's Sundance Film Festival and set off a bidding war. It's also something of an exorcism. Ms. Burstein was co-director, with Brett Morgen, of two highly regarded documentaries: the Oscar-nominated ''On the Ropes,'' about three young boxers hoping to fight their way out of poverty, and ''The Kid Stays in the Picture,'' a portrait of the flamboyant Hollywood producer Robert Evans. But the impetus for ''American Teen'' was more personal: her own intense high school experience two decades ago in Buffalo. To make the 90-minute film Ms. Burstein moved to Warsaw, Ind., and, deploying multiple cameras, gathered 1,000 hours of footage as she and her crew followed four 17-year-olds through their senior year at the town's large, modern high school. The students could almost be the template for a John Hughes teen pic: the pampered queen bee Megan, whose imperious will to power masks a terrible secret; the basketball player Colin, who must win a sports scholarship or forgo college for the Army; the gifted bohemian Hannah, ready to break away but terrified that she may have inherited her mother's bipolar disorder; and the lonely band nerd Jake, funny and appealing but afflicted with vivid acne flare-ups that complicate his wry, determined search for a girlfriend."

BEHIND THE NEWS The charges of genocide, war crimes and crimes against humanity are the court's first against a sitting president. They stem from the five years of bloodshed in the Darfur region of Sudan, where Mr. Bashir's government is accused of trying to wipe out three ethnic minorities as it scoffed at international efforts to hold it accountable. While the warrant is unlikely to ever be executed, some diplomats hoped it would give them new leverage in seeking peace in Darfur."

In 2008, more people of all races, classes and ages have access to credit. Their debts are growing rapidly: Americans carry $2.56 trillion in consumer debt, up 22 percent since 2000, when figures are adjusted for inflation. And household debt is now 130 percent of disposable income, up from 30 percent in 1929. Lenders, too, have shifted. Diligent borrowers are no longer the best customers. Lenders now seek and profit from customers least able to pay their debts. To help reduce the risk, lenders sell debts to investors in the form of securities. AMY SCHOENFELD"

He faltered but did not fall, stared down defeat without blinking, overcame his own mistakes, ignored an aching right wrist and outlasted his opponents. In the process, he validated his place in golf history, shooting a final-round 69 for a total of three-over-par 283 to become the first European in more than 100 years to successfully defend the Open title. Playing the final six holes in four under par, with an eagle at the 17th hole, he rendered moot Ian Poulter's late charge and turned back 53-year-old Greg Norman's quixotic and compelling quest to become the oldest major championship winner."

We have a new Times Topics blog on issues in the news and the post on Hurricane Dolly is by Hugh Willoughby, formerly the head of hurricane research at the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration and now a professor at Florida International University. He notes that this one is mainly a warmup, given that storms like this one, below Category 3, comprise 80 to 90 percent of those that hit land but cause only 15 to 20 percent of hurricane damage. As Prof. Willoughby put it, ""Dolly is a nice refresher training exercise for the forecasters and emergency response crews. It's also a good 'baptism of wind' for Bill Read, in his new job as director at the Hurricane Center."""

These catastrophes resulted in $9.3billion in insured catastrophe, the highest first-half total since 1994 (the year of the Northridge earthquake). This figure exceeds the total insured catastrophe losses recorded in 2006 ($9.2 billion) and 2007 ($6.7 billion). Tornadoes were the most significant cause of loss during the first half of the year.

Mr. Sloman also willingly passed on his legal knowledge, skills, and abilities to seminar and conference audiences, but he particularly relished mentoring associates at the law firm. Of particular note during his 58 year legal career are his two appearances before the United States Supreme Court, both of which he won. And he was particularly proud to have been asked by the judges of the Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals to form the Fifth Circuit Bar Association, becoming its first president. He also served as Chairman of the Corporation, Banking, and Business Law Section and, later, the Appellate Practice and Advocacy Section of the State Bar of Texas. Mr. Sloman was a long-time member of the American Law Institute. Mr. Sloman's college education was interrupted by World War II, in which he served in the Naval Reserve. He returned to the University of Texas after the War and earned his undergraduate degree in 1948. He was a member of Kappa Sigma fraternity. After graduating in 1950 from the University of Texas School of Law (where he served on the Board of Editors of the Texas Law Review), Mr. Sloman moved to New York to practice law at the Wall Street law firm of Sullivan & Cromwell under the tutelage of William Piel. While in New York, he met and married Margaret Jane Dinwiddie in 1953. They moved to Dallas in 1956 to raise their family. He joined the Dallas law firm of Carrington, Gowen, Johnson, Bromberg & Leeds as an associate, later becoming a partner in the firm of Carrington, Johnson & Stephens. Born in 1925, Mr. Sloman spent his youth in Fort Worth where he graduated from Pascal High School. His mother, Janette Sloman, and grandmother, Sarah Sherk, contributed to his interest in art, literature, cuisine, and, especially, music, preferably classical and 1920s jazz. He loved to debate the finer points of everything around him. His curiosity often lead him to carefully study and gain mastery, whether the subject was camping, fishing, hunting, sports, carpentry, travel, electronics, or one of his many other interests. He sought the best and to be the best. Such passion, at times, lead to a quick temper, but one that was easily overlooked by those who appreciated his broad knowledge and quick wit. A significant accomplishment was Mr. Sloman's single-handed construction, board by board and nail by nail, of a hexagonal country home outside of Winnsboro, Texas, commonly referred to as ''Homebrew'' for the creek that ran through the property. A loving husband, father, and grandfather, Mr. Sloman is survived by his wife, Margaret, daughter, Lucy, and son, Dinnie. Lucy Sloman, an urban designer and planner, is married to Stephen Antupit. They reside in Seattle, Washington with their son, Henry, and daughter, Natalie. Dinnie Sloman, a Cornell Cooperative Extension administrator, lives with his wife, Lisa Flachs, and two daughters, Josephine and Emmalee, in Oneonta, New York. Visiting hours will be held from 4:00pm to 6:00pm on Saturday, July 26, 2008, at Sparkman/Hillcrest Funeral Home in Dallas. The family requests that, in lieu of flowers, contributions be made in Mr. Sloman's name to the Texas Chapter of The Nature Conservancy, Texas Old Missions and Forts Restoration Association, or to a charity of your choice. An on-line memorial book is available at www.mem.com. Sparkman/ Hillcrest, 7405 W. Northwest Hwy., Dallas, TX 75225, 214363-5401."

The screenings this weekend in Brooklyn are made for an audience with a YouTube attention span: according to Casey Safron, the festival's founder, the longest piece is just 18 minutes, the shortest are only 10 seconds and the average is around 5 minutes. Mr. Safron selected the more than 100 films from more than 800 submissions, nearly double what he received last year; there are awards in categories like experimental work, documentary, music video and one-minute movie. (The longest work, ''24 Frames,'' is a stop-motion film about a stop-motion production being made at an art school -- a meta-stop-motion epic, Mr. Safron called it.) Several pieces screened in past years -- including ''Breakfast,'' above -- have been turned into television and Web series for MTV and the Sundance Channel."

But that's happening now (with the help of children's imaginations) where hardy vegetation often takes root: Central Park. There the Swedish Cottage Marionette Theater is presenting Michael Alogna and Larry Aumen's musical adaptation of ''Jack and the Beanstalk,'' that David-and-Goliath tale of a poor boy and his climb to a giant's stratospheric castle (above). The production's elaborate marionettes include a sprightly Jack; Citronella, the Giant's servant, who resembles Phyllis Diller; Dolly, Jack's cuddly-looking cow; and a Bing Crosby-like peddler, who sings ''Swinging on a Star'' when he offers the magic beans. They are almost eclipsed by the prodigious beanstalk, which grows before the audience's eyes center stage. It's a rare show in which the scenery does the scenery chewing."

Pryor became editor of ''Modern Maturity,'' now known as ''AARP, The Magazine,'' in 1967, in the early years of the American Association of Retired Persons. A former senior editor of Look Magazine and editor of Science Digest, Pryor hired an editorial staff and called on writers, photographers and artists around the country to produce a magazine meeting the needs of America's fast-growing retirement population. When he joined the magazine in 1967, its circulation stood at 700,000. Fifteen years later, when he retired, the magazine's circulation had increased tenfold to 7 million. Upon retirement in 1982, he was an associate director of AARP. Born in Argentina of British and American parents, Pryor was educated at English schools in Buenos Aires and the University of London. He began his career as South American correspondent of the wire service then known as United Press. In 1940, in the United States, he went to work as a reporter for the New York Herald Tribune. Later he was director of shortwave news for CBS and also covered the United Nations in its earliest days following World War II. During the war years, he served as an officer in U.S. Naval Intelligence. For 15 years after that, he worked as a senior editor of Look Magazine and for four years was editor of Science Digest. After his retirement, he was a free-lance writer in South Palm Beach, Florida, and in 1995 published ''Soul Talk,'' a book of meditations. In 1940 he was married to Ellen May Ach. He later married Roberta Baughman Smith and Luanne Williamson van Norden. All three marriages ended in divorce. He had three sons with the former Ellen Ach, Alan of Novato, California, and Gerald and David, both of New York City.

This triple bill begins with ''Bedknobs and Broomsticks,'' the Disney musical starring McDowall as Mr. Jelk, a London vicar, and his friend Angela Lansbury as Eglantine Price, the apprentice witch of Portobello Road. In ''Lassie Come Home'' (1943), a 10-year-old McDowall, above, plays the young master of the stoic collie in her film debut.

MillerPutnam Valley, N.Y., July 13, 2008 ● I've been thinking a lot about your column. What I can't accept - in your column and in Times policy generally - is the failure to distinguish between using ""unfit"" language and reporting on it.You write as if it would be the same thing for you or a columnist to offer an opinion in ""unfit"" language as for a Times writer to report in the third person what a public figure has said that includes accurately quoted ""unfit"" language.Surely this is a fundamental journalistic distinction. If there is an argument for ignoring that distinction in this sort of case, the argument needs to be made.The classroom-breakfast table issue is not an argument, if it even is an issue - don't you think most parents and teachers also distinguish between using bad language and speaking seriously about someone else's use of it?Bill Keller's statement about being reluctant to lead the charge to a coarser public discourse is a silly overstatement. The policy has the effect common to most fig leaves, visual and rhetorical, inspiring people to peek underneath, in these cases at other sources of information.Toni H. OlivieroBrooklyn, July 24, 2008The writer is dean of liberal arts and sciences, Pratt Institute. ● Putting aside the action that the Rev. Jesse Jackson described, why is the word in question ""dirty"" and other words describing the identical part of the anatomy, ""testicles"" or ""gonads,"" not dirty? Why is this particular word ""dirty"" when used in one context, but not others?After all, the group of letters considered ""dirty,"" when used as Mr. Jackson used them, are beyond reproach when used to name those small shelled fruit or seeds we gobble down with our beers, or that mad, eccentric character who hangs out at the street corner, or that small, usually square or hexagonal flat piece of metal or word, with a hole through it for screwing onto a bolt.What is there exactly that makes this word, a grouping of four perfectly neutral letters, ""dirty""?Ronald RubinTopanga, Calif., July 14, 2008 ● You do a fine job of fence-sitting on the issue of reporting offensive speech.I propose two simple rules:Keep it clean (the present well-intentioned Times policy).Don't bowdlerize.If you can't say what they said, don't even say they said it. If it's too important to ignore, it's too important to censor.When the language is the story, you must report the language.Wittgenstein said it best: ""What we cannot speak about we must pass over in silence.""Kim de RielHavertown, Pa., July 14, 2008 ● The decision of The Times not to directly quote the Rev. Jesse Jackson's offensive words raises the question: Why not use the technical term ""castration"" to indicate what he really said about Senator Barack Obama, as you say The Washington Post did?By removing that specific information from Mr. Jackson's statement, The Times missed the sad irony that one form of physical assault inflicted by lynch mobs on African-American men was castration. Viewed in its full context, the statement demonstrates how badly out of touch Mr. Jackson is with many in the black community (including me, an African-American who participated in the civil rights movement and who worked in his 1988 presidential primary campaign).John Brown ChildsSanta Cruz, Calif., July 14, 2008The writer is a professor of sociology at the University of California, Santa Cruz. ● How about letting your grammar slip, and your spelling, to accord with common usage? Would the critical public similarly expect The Times to ""slide with the times""? I think not.It is only where matters of a onetime prudish sensitivity are concerned, and it is only to justify their own such indulgence.But I just want to say that I'm with you on where you arrive with it. I don't see The Times as lagging behind current taste, but as upholding the long-standing standard of propriety.Irv ThomasSeattle, July 13, 2008 ● I hope you will soon write a column about oral and written language. Except for a brief nod to literature and the Internet, all the examples you provide are from oral language (talk, rappers, rock bands, stage, screen, television), and then you extend those examples to written discourse. But oral language is not the same as written language. I have no idea if the medium is the message, but the medium certainly affects the message and audience.It's not a matter of being ""so prissy we're out of touch"" or standards. It's a matter of accuracy and clarity, while appreciating and understanding the power and relationship between oral and written language and our humanity.Allen BergerSavannah, Ga., July 13, 2008The writer is emeritus professor of reading and writing at Miami University. ● One of the reasons given for why The Times doesn't use ""dirty words"" whereas The New Yorker does is because ""The New Yorker is not delivered to middle- and high-school classrooms as 40,000 daily copies of The Times are.""Perhaps if The Times did use dirty words, it would be delivering more than 40,000 daily copies. At least the 30,000 unread or barely skimmed copies would be scanned with more interest.Perhaps I'd even start believing what's written in it again.Alex DeringPrinceton, N.J., July 14, 2008 ● I enjoyed your column about the editorial squeamishness regarding reporting the Rev. Jesse Jackson's wish to separate Barack Obama from his testicles.A coven of prudish (old maid) librarians indeed.Do Times (and other) editors really believe that ""children"" of an age to read The Times, at this point nearly a decade into a new and increasingly ill-spoken century, aren't aware of most of the four-letter Anglo-Saxon adjectives bandied about so freely?To me, it's just another example of editorial self-righteousness. In a 43-year career at The Baltimore Sun, they provided me with an abundance of giggles as the editors struggled with euphemspeak - how to report something without actually reporting it. (And they don't want quotes cleaned up! Yuk, yuk!)Robert A. ErlandsonTowson, Md., July 15, 2008 ● The paper's writers and editors do not have to, and likely should not, write such vulgarities - except when such words are pertinent to the story. And in this case, the editors Paul Winfield and Chuck Strum seem to have lost their news sense. The man said it!What was newsworthy was the context and the entire quotation: the Rev. Jesse Jackson using Barack Obama's first name, leaning in sotto voce so that it appeared that Dr. Reed V. Tuckson had to struggle to hear him. Dr. Tuckson's attempt to be polite and respectful while awkwardly, it seems to me, hiding shock behind outward stoicism. Mr. Jackson's making the ""talking down to black people"" comment, pausing, pulling away, leaning in again and making the ""nuts"" comment. And Mr. Jackson's settling back, pausing again, then making the violent gesture.By the end of it all Jackson seemed to be talking to himself rather than to Dr. Tuckson.I say all this having interviewed both gentlemen more than once when I was at United Press International and The Washington Post more than 20 years ago, and in Dr. Tuckson's case, having shared a long, nonworking conversation during an airplane flight.The full quotation put in context would demonstrate all and more of what Mr. Winfield and Mr. Strum saw as being most newsworthy: the generational divide in political black leadership, the bitterness and palpable anger, the class-elitism issue, the simultaneous rejection and embrace of homogeneity. It is all there, and more. It is not all there when you leave out the ""nuts"" line. The Times editors neglected to consider the intelligence of their readers and the ability of those readers to process all of the pertinent information.So, I'm with my former somewhat-of-a-colleague David Remnick at The New Yorker. The Times, The Washington Post and the few crumbs that are left of my hometown Baltimore Sun need to loosen the reins.Doug StevensonBaltimore, July 17, 2008 ● I was appalled that The Times thinks it is ever all right not to give an exact quote of what someone said. The paper cannot possibly have editorial standards that deem something important enough to print and not relate the words.What would the possible importance be of a quote that cannot be given? We use words to communicate. Adults use blue words to communicate among themselves.Maybe if The Times always used exact language we would avoid more bubbles and recessions, and enough people might understand in advance of disaster and change behavior. It's possible.Stephen J. BoyleJersey City, July 14, 2008 ● When a public figure uses a ""dirty"" word, and it's central to the story, The Times has a duty to publish the quote. Otherwise, The Times is just not reporting the news. Citizens have a right to know what these public figures actually said because it's germane to our judgment of their character.Should The Times include audio or video clips of these incidents? No, leave that to the tabloids.Should The Times worry about these words showing up in their school circulation? Today's middle and high school kids know and use vulgar and dirty language all the time.I used to teach high school. If The Times had added a line, ""Caution: coarse language,"" or something like that to clue me in, I would have used the article to open a discussion with my class about the quote, and about when language like that is appropriate and when it's not.Herbert N. Swearengen IIIBlytheville, Ariz., July 13, 2008 ● When a public figure uses profanity or other demeaning language, the failure to quote him precisely is to falsify the portrait of the speaker.The essence of reporting is to provide the reader with a complete picture of the event. That includes the character of the participants. That means telling the reader what the speaker really is, not want he wants the public to see him to be.In other words, the Rev. Jesse Jackson has a very low, crass opinion of Barack Obama. Mr. Jackson needs to be seen that way, not another.Elihu I. RoseLake Success, N.Y., July 13, 2008 ● This Times policy serves only its own image, not the larger public civility it claims to be protecting. When a story prints, ""Cheney to senator: **** off"" (or however the obscenity is disguised), few readers will not supply the missing word.A basic principle of linguistics: if you have a word in mind and display some symbols to your audience so that the audience realizes what you meant to write, then you have communicated the word to them. Not actually printing the missing letters is a trick to give the illusion of civility, while allowing the ""unprintable"" language to be communicated just as clearly as if it were spelled out.This fussy preservation of the appearance of civility amounts to hypocrisy.Charles J. SmithBuffalo, July 13, 2008 ● So why not draw the line between quoting those who use the ""bad words"" and Times writers using them in their own writing?I have been so infuriated by the news media (especially radio and TV) talking to our own soldiers, the ""heroes"" people like to point to, and then bleeping what they say.Soldiers have always had foul mouths, and what they're talking about is inherently offensive. People use offensive language, and they often use it for a very good reason. Let them.David BeanArlington, Mass., July 13, 2008 ●Please allow me to point out that ""cut off his nuts"" is not the same as ""castrate."" Almost all Times editors and readers should know this well. It is an informal expression used almost exclusively in spoken English that is taken to be extreme hyperbole by both speaker and listener.The Rev. Jesse Jackson has no desire to castrate Barack Obama; even to joke about it is absurd. It is an emphatic expression used to express the depth of the speaker's anger or outrage.It is also metaphorical, suggesting something like, ""I'd really like to do something strong enough to get Barack Obama to pay attention and listen to what some of us are trying to tell him.""By mistakenly treating Mr. Jackson's compressed, metaphorical expression as if it were literal, the Times did a disservice to readers and to Mr. Jackson by making the story confusing and shredding the coherence of what Mr. Jackson was trying to say.Wouldn't it be possible for The Times to simply use asterisks for ""offensive"" words? That would preserve the context of the remarks and not assign added meaning to them.As for ""potty,"" I find it more offensive than ""nuts,"" because it treats readers as if they were children.Chris DrakeHatoyama-machi, Japan, July 13, 2008 ●Re ""Weighing the Risk"" (July 6, 2008): A question you didn't raise is, Why does The New York Times publish the name of a nontorturing C.I.A. interrogator and not publish the names of those who've actually tortured people? Was it because it was easier to get Deuce Martinez's name?It seems to me that the real issue is that The Times, once again, is taking the easy route on digging deeper.Christopher CookPrague, July 6, 2008 ● In May, you defended The Times's practice of withholding the names of reporters reporting from Zimbabwe and Myanmar. Risk, you know. But now you defend The Times's disclosing of the name of the interrogator of Khalid Shaikh Mohammed. The peoples' right to know, you know.But the real basis for decisions whether to disclose is clear: Will it harm the Bush war effort (if it will, yes; if it won't no)?You say that the Times has ""sometimes agreed, sometimes refused"" to withhold information when asked to do so by the C.I.A. Why don't you give readers some depth and disclose how many times it has agreed and refused since Iraq was invaded?Steven K. CochranDallas, July 7, 2008●●"

And to get a sense of how bad it is when you're selling a big S.U.V. in the era of high gas prices, I went on Craigslist and surveyed the plaintive listings. The bottom line seems to be that if you have a Hummer H2 or even a more fuel-efficient H3 for sale, you're very negotiable. Let's talk, the ads say, but sometimes even that isn't possible."

''I prefer to see a place for a longer period of time than just seeing the sights and moving on, because otherwise you don't get a feel for what's really going on. It's really the main kick of traveling for me -- that you can meet people in such different circumstances, and really, it's the same things that make people happy and it's the same things that you can bond over. I had been in India for about three months doing volunteer work for lower-class children in Rajasthan when this picture was taken, and we had just left the project to go on a monthlong trip. You meet a lot of people in India who have traveled there for a long time, and they say 'Oh, Taj Mahal, it's just another tourist attraction, don't go there, it's boring.' So we came with mixed expectations. But when you get there, it's even more beautiful than you thought. This incredibly big stone structure, it seems so light because it's white marble.

I'm reminded of a behavioral seminar I recently attended where the lecturer, a very prominent veterinary behaviorist, drew a critical analogy between ''discriminatory'' civic laws against pit-bull ownership and the persecution of Jews in Nazi Germany. I nearly walked out in disgust, but I digress. In my own practice experience, and consistent with the animals described in the article by James Vlahos (July 13), all types of neurotic behaviors are far more prevalent in single-pet households. If it can be managed, two or more pooches or cats are easier to live with than one. Friendship and vigorous activity go a long way in preventing nutty behavior. Just like us."

And, surely, that was the intention. Nude, as the hue is called in the beauty and fashion industry, ''is one of the sexiest colors there is, if not the sexiest,'' said Alexander Wang, who worked it into his fall collection. Clearly what began last spring as a mere shoe fetish has evolved into a full-body trend. The French Vogue editor Carine Roitfeld (above), who could create a fervor for fundoshis if she cared to, attended the recent couture shows in a nude Azzedine Alaïa dress, with matching Alaïa shoes. For fall, Valentino, Nina Ricci, Christopher Kane (far left) and Chanel all showed strong looks in the delicate shade. Karl Lagerfeld even upped the erotic factor by putting bondage straps on one of his dresses."

Bob passed peacefully at his home outside San Diego surrounded by his family after a vigorous fight with cancer. He was 80. Born in Chicago, always his home town, he served in the army, earned a degree in journalism from the University of Missouri, and then migrated to New York City. He enjoyed the bachelor life during the City's Golden Years in the 1950s, until fate introduced him to his wife and life long partner Patricia. Bob spent his career in public relations, working first under the tutelage of Harold Burson at Burson-Marsteller. He later worked for several large corporations, ending his career with Household International. No major family event went by without a few or more appropriate words and commentary, crafted as only Dad could. Pat and Bob started their family in Chicago then moved back to the New York area, then back again to Chicago. A new chapter began when the family moved to San Diego in 1979. Business interrupted and brought Bob and Pat back to his roots in Chicago but they retired in San Diego for good in 1997. There he played tennis almost until his death, enjoyed the beach and served as a sheriff volunteer in Poway. Aside from Pat and his family, his great love was skiing. His extended family gathered every year in Park City, and he skied on his 80th birthday this past January. He never quite mastered the Stem Christie but he loved trying. Bob is survived by Patricia, his daughter Meghan, sons Michael (Chrissa), Mark (Tina), David (Michelle) and Christopher (Molly), and grandkids Cait, Jack, Ryan, Nick, Riley and Finnian. He will be missed always and greatly. In lieu of flowers, the family suggests donations to the Elizabeth Hospice: www.elizabethhospice.org."

2008-07-27T00:00:00Z,"To get athletes to hunker down, the National Collegiate Athletic Association in 2005 developed the Academic Progress Rate, a gauge of how Division I athletes do in the classroom over four years. Penalties are levied if rates fall below 925, about equal to a 60 percent graduation rate (the N.C.A.A.'s method considers freshmen graduating within six years and includes transfer students). Until this year, A.P.R. calculations were adjusted to avoid unfairly penalizing teams on the basis of limited data. Now that four years of data are available, adjustments have been eliminated and the number of sanctioned teams has about doubled:174 teams lose scholarships or practice time; 44 more are on notice (among mitigating circumstances: showing improvement or outperforming the student body). In the graphic above is a list of teams in some major sports that have been penalized."

Specifically, their Boyfriend jeans, a higher-waisted, well-washed, slouchy style based on a pair of Levi's 501 XX from the 1950s. The allure? They are the antithesis of the dark, skinny jeans that have saturated the denim market. ''All I can say is that every time we send samples out for a shoot, the editor sends an e-mail asking to place a personal order,'' a spokeswoman for the brand said. More-brazen stylists have even offered to cut a check for the samples themselves. But most (which is to say, about 30) placed personal orders at the press preview in April, well before the pants had gone into production. The jeans hit Barneys New York this week, but, then, there's already a lengthy wait list."

Overseth, Sr. and Ione Johnson, Oliver grew up in Canton, SD and attended WashingtonLee High School in Arlington, VA. After graduating with a BS from the University of Chicago, he earned his Ph.D. at Brown University, and spentfour years as an Instructor and Research Associate at Princeton University. He and his former wife, Anneke deBruyn Overseth, moved to Ann Arbor in 1961, where Oliver joined the Physics Department at the University of Michigan. Oliver was a highenergy experimental physicist, involved in experiments at Berkeley, Brookhaven, Fermilab, and CERN. His major research interest and accomplishments were in the physics of hyperons, their polarization, decay parameters, and magnetic moments which were the subject of several experiments at the Fermilab accelerator and later at CERN. At Michigan, he chaired the doctoral thesis committees of 12 students, served on many College and University committees, and was a highly regarded lecturer. Since retiring from the University in 1992, Oliver split his time between homes in Geneva, Switzerland and Key West, FL, as well as traveling throughout the world. He married his longtime love, Ludy van Bruggen, in September 2007. Throughout his life, Oliver loved jazz, and was a noted collector of Sidney Bechet. He adored sports cars and could usually be seen driving a Porsche. He will be remembered for his keen observations on people and events, his extraordinary knowledge of facts important and trivial, his generous love for his family and his wry sense of humor. He is survived by his wife, Ludy van Bruggen Overseth, his daughters Alison Overseth (Alan Bozian) of New York and Tenley Le Sann (Bernard) of Geneva; grandchildren Hannah, Peter and Emily Bozian and Brandon and Clayton Le Sann. There will be a memorial service for Oliver in Key West this coming winter. In lieu of flowers, Oliver hoped his friends would put on some great jazz, have a martini and whoop it up."

2008-07-28T21:00:54Z,"Ferapontovo Monastery, in the Vologda region 300 miles north of Moscow, is way off the beaten track for most tourists. But for those curious about the luminous 15th-century frescoes in the monastery's Cathedral of the Nativity of the Virgin, there is an exhibition of remarkable photographs on display in Moscow's Shchusev State Museum of Architecture through the end of August. Profoundly theological in their content and execution, the frescoes depicting biblical prophets, saints, New Testament parables, Jesus and the Last Judgment, were painted by Dionisy the Wise, widely regarded as one of the greatest Russian iconographers. The frescoes, along with the monastery itself, are on Unesco's World Heritage list, and are especially notable for their terracotta and blue hues that seem more Mediterranean in style than northern Russian. Which makes it all the more amazing that the 300 or so images in ""The Light of Dionisy's Frescoes"" exhibition at the Shchusev Museum are photographs, the work of Yuri Kholdin, a photographer who spent over 10 years studying and capturing the frescoes, using analog cameras and shooting at specific times of day, with as little artificial light as possible. The result is a collection of images that are so detailed and true to the originals that they look like the real thing.  The fact that they are hung in the museum's Aptekarsky Prikaz wing, which looks and feels like a monastic chamber, only enhances the effect. Several times, I wanted to reach out and touch them, to feel the texture I could so clearly see.   Kholdin died a year ago at age 52, in an accident while photographing the skyscrapers of Moscow City, the Russian capital's new business district. His widow, Yekaterina Danilova, an art historian with theological training who wrote the texts that accompany the images, has continued his work promoting the frescoes.  Kholdin's love of the art form was reflected in his creation of a foundation called Frescoes of Russia. In an interview about his work, which was distributed at the exhibition, Danilova discusses Kholdin's time studying Renaissance art in Italy and his interest in Kazimir Malevich's Suprematism, which was influenced by icons. It's possible to see the influence of both in Kholdin's approach to photographing the frescoes. One American visitor at the exhibition's July 22 opening compared the photographs of the frescoes to the work of the Italian Renaissance painter Giotto. The close-ups of fresco details - an angel's face, a pitcher on a table - are reminiscent of Suprematist compositions. For more information on Kholdin's work see his Web site, www.dionisy.ru, for now in Russian only."

He later changed the name of his firm to Devine International. He worked tirelessly there until the day of his death. G.T. will always be remembered for his love of the market, sports (most especially golf and the football Giants), and above all else, his love of people. He absolutely adored his family and his grandchildren. He was witty, generous, charming and gracious. He was always the life of the party.

2008-07-28T00:00:00Z,"DEVINE--Gerald Thomas, a longtime Rye, NY resident, died on July 25, 2008 with his wife, Louise of 44 years by his side. GT as he was known by all, was born in Plainfield, New Jersey to Christopher J. Devine and Bonaventura Kirby on January 11, 1937. He was the sixth of nine siblings. Jerry graduated Croydon Hall Academy in New Jersey in 1955. He then attended St. Edwards College in Austin, Texas. Jerry had great admiration for his father, C.J. Devine, a very successful government bond broker with an active brokerage firm named after him (C.J. Devine and Co.). Jerry began his career at the brokerage firm, Nugent Igo located in East Orange, New Jersey. He worked there until 1962 and was then hired by his father at his offices in Manhattan. He went on to manage his father's Boston office, which he did until 1964. Jerry married Louise Davino on September 26, 1964 and then settled in Rye, NY. Between 1964 and 1980, Jerry worked for a variety of different government bond firms, eventually going into business for himself starting the firm, G.T. Devine and Co. He later changed the name of his firm to Devine International. He worked tirelessly there until the day of his death. G.T. will always be remembered for his love of the market, sports (most especially golf and the football Giants), and above all else, his love of people. He absolutely adored his family and his grandchildren. He was witty, generous, charming and gracious. He was always the life of the party. He made anyone he spoke to feel special, and he was always genuine and sincere. Over the years he helped countless friends and acquaintances to find work, see a ball game, connect with one another, or get through a tough time. G.T. Devine is survived by his beloved wife Louise, his son Jerry Jr., his daughter Holly and her husband, Garth Melville, and two grandchildren, Sean and Jack. A wake will be held on Tuesday, August 29th at Grahams Funeral Home in Rye; hours: 2-4pm and 7-9pm.

2008-07-29T21:30:51Z,"NEWPORT, R.I. -- The 24 members of the news media who voted in the league's preseason media poll agreed on one thing -- Syracuse will be the worst team in the Big East in 2008. All 24 of them voted the Orange last, the latest in a flurry of signs that Syracuse football has bottomed out.Under the fourth-year coach Greg Robinson, the Orange is mired in the worst stretch in team history. Things are so bleak in Central New York that the Vegas over-under for victories for the Orange this is season is 2.5, and Syracuse has already been installed as a double-digit underdog in its opening game at Northwestern.Unless a miraculous turnaround comes, this will be Robinson's last year on the Hill. It's the most obvious looming story line for the Orange as it gets ready for the season. (And as evidence by this blog post, some Syracuse fans appear tired of Robinson's rhetoric by now.)Syracuse guard Ryan Durand acknowledged that Robinson was ""on the hot seat.""He said: ""Obviously we know about it. Everyone on the team knows about it. But it's not a dark cloud, it's not a motivation. Our motivator is to win games, for us. Coach Robinson is one of us. But I want to win for the tackle and center next to me. I just want to win. That's the name of the game.""He added: ""It's never been addressed on the team. It's one of those things that doesn't need to be said. Everyone knows what's going on and what our mission is. It's one of those things we don't need to talk about. It's really silly to talk about it.""Durand was more than happy to talk about the new offensive coordinator Mitch Bronwing, a coup of a hire by Robinson considering the slim chances of the Orange retaining him next season. Browning sat out last season after working for Glen Mason at Minnesota, and his resume includes tailbacks Laurence Maroney and Marion Barber III. His main focus will be to overhaul one of the country's consistently bad units during Robinson's tenure. The Orange gave up 54 sacks last season and 45 the previous year. Browning is regarded as an great molder of offensive linemen, and he's had all of the Orange linemen slim down, including having the tackles lose as many as 30 pounds.Durand, who has had four offensive coordinators in five years, called him a ""breath of fresh air.""But breathing life into the corpse that is the Syracuse football program may be too much of a task for Browning."

2008-07-29T00:00:00Z,"RICHMOND--Julius B., M.D. It is with profound sadness that the members of the Board of Trustees of the Flight Attendant Medical Research Institute (FAMRI) note the passing of our beloved friend, mentor and educator --Julius B. Richmond, M.D. --formerly Surgeon General of the United States. Dr. Richmond over his long, diversified and splendid career did as much as anyone to protect and improve the health of his fellow citizens, and in particular children and adolescents. From 1953 to 1965 Dr. Richmond was chairman and professor of the Department of Pediatrics at the State University of New York, SUN Y College of Medicine and became dean in 1965, serving in that capacity until 1970. In 1965 Dr. Richmond was appointed by President Johnson as the first national director of Project Head Start in the Office of Economic Opportunity. Head Start became a year-round program after the first summer; approximately 750,000 children are enrolled in Project Head Start each year in approximately 1,500 centers across the United States. Head Start is a comprehensive child development program. In 1971 Dr. Richmond was recruited by the Harvard Medical School where he became a professor of psychiatry and human development and chairman and professor of the Department of Social and Preventative Medicine. Simultaneously, he was appointed professor of public health in the School of Public Health at Harvard. While at Harvard, Dr. Richmond was honored to receive a presidential dual appointment as both Surgeon General and Assistant Secretary for Health. Both positions required senate confirmation. Dr. Richmond was the first individual ever selected to occupy both positions. He had the responsibility in the federal public health sector for some 50,000 employees. During his tenure as Surgeon General, Dr. Richmond focused on tobacco control efforts through the publication of the 1979 Surgeon Generals Report, presenting overwhelming scientific evidence of the multiple harms caused by smoking. Dr. Richmond has received a number of honorary degrees including ones from Yale and Harvard. He continued his professional activities as the John D. McCarthy Professor of Health Policy Emeritus, monitoring students and colleagues, right up until the last couple of months. He continued to teach and write, striving to shape health policies for health promotion and disease prevention, with a special emphasis on children and families as well as the low income population. Dr. Richmond was a brilliant, caring, hands-on pediatrician for nearly 70 years. In later years he took on the onerous task of continuing to educate the public by testifying in open court about the dangers of tobacco and how the industry had for decades manipulated scientific data. In doing so Dr. Richmond voluntarily subjected himself to many days of grueling cross-examination, and he did this while refusing to accept compensation as a skilled expert witness. As Chairman of FA MRI's Medical Advisory Board, Dr. Richmond was vital to the Board of Trustees in helping to direct over $200,000,000 in grants to some of the finest medical schools and research institutions in America and the world --including five Centers of Excellence. The scientific research is aimed at eradicating the diseases caused by exposure to second hand tobacco smoke, the money having resulted from a class action lawsuit filed on behalf of nonsmoking flight attendants against the tobacco industry. Dr. Richmond had one of the most extraordinary and productive careers in the history of American monitoring science and public education. His professional accomplishments were mirrored by his sterling character traits. His sense of humor was legendary as was his refusal to acknowledge his own importance. He was endlessly patient, civil, tolerant, incredibly well-informed and a true pleasure to be around. The members of the Board of Trustees of FA MRI are eternally grateful for the guidance of Dr. Richmond over the past decade as well as for the pure pleasure of his company and insights.

The vote was 52 to 40 in favor of the Advancing America's Priorities Act, but 60 ''yes'' votes were required under Senate rules. The act embraces dozens of programs costing an estimated $10 billion and covering health care, crime prevention, aid to victims of paralysis and other items."

2008-07-29T00:00:00Z,"RICHMOND--Julius B., M.D. It is with profound sadness that the members of the Board of Trustees of the Flight Attendant Medical Research Institute (FAMRI) note the passing of our beloved friend, mentor and educator --Julius B. Richmond, M.D. --formerly Surgeon General of the United States. Dr. Richmond over his long, diversified and splendid career did as much as anyone to protect and improve the health of his fellow citizens, and in particular children and adolescents. From 1953 to 1965 Dr. Richmond was chairman and professor of the Department of Pediatrics at the State University of New York, SUN Y College of Medicine and became dean in 1965, serving in that capacity until 1970. In 1965 Dr. Richmond was appointed by President Johnson as the first national director of Project Head Start in the Office of Economic Opportunity. Head Start became a year-round program after the first summer; approximately 750,000 children are enrolled in Project Head Start each year in approximately 1,500 centers across the United States. Head Start is a comprehensive child development program. In 1971 Dr. Richmond was recruited by the Harvard Medical School where he became a professor of psychiatry and human development and chairman and professor of the Department of Social and Preventative Medicine. Simultaneously, he was appointed professor of public health in the School of Public Health at Harvard. While at Harvard, Dr. Richmond was honored to receive a presidential dual appointment as both Surgeon General and Assistant Secretary for Health. Both positions required senate confirmation. Dr. Richmond was the first individual ever selected to occupy both positions. He had the responsibility in the federal public health sector for some 50,000 employees. During his tenure as Surgeon General, Dr. Richmond focused on tobacco control efforts through the publication of the 1979 Surgeon Generals Report, presenting overwhelming scientific evidence of the multiple harms caused by smoking. Dr. Richmond has received a number of honorary degrees including ones from Yale and Harvard. He continued his professional activities as the John D. McCarthy Professor of Health Policy Emeritus, monitoring students and colleagues, right up until the last couple of months. He continued to teach and write, striving to shape health policies for health promotion and disease prevention, with a special emphasis on children and families as well as the low income population. Dr. Richmond was a brilliant, caring, hands-on pediatrician for nearly 70 years. In later years he took on the onerous task of continuing to educate the public by testifying in open court about the dangers of tobacco and how the industry had for decades manipulated scientific data. In doing so Dr. Richmond voluntarily subjected himself to many days of grueling cross-examination, and he did this while refusing to accept compensation as a skilled expert witness. As Chairman of FA MRI's Medical Advisory Board, Dr. Richmond was vital to the Board of Trustees in helping to direct over $200,000,000 in grants to some of the finest medical schools and research institutions in America and the world --including five Centers of Excellence. The scientific research is aimed at eradicating the diseases caused by exposure to second hand tobacco smoke, the money having resulted from a class action lawsuit filed on behalf of nonsmoking flight attendants against the tobacco industry. Dr. Richmond had one of the most extraordinary and productive careers in the history of American monitoring science and public education. His professional accomplishments were mirrored by his sterling character traits. His sense of humor was legendary as was his refusal to acknowledge his own importance. He was endlessly patient, civil, tolerant, incredibly well-informed and a true pleasure to be around. The members of the Board of Trustees of FA MRI are eternally grateful for the guidance of Dr. Richmond over the past decade as well as for the pure pleasure of his company and insights.

2008-07-30T02:25:00Z,"NEWPORT, R.I. -- Indicative of his classy nature, Big East Commissioner Mike Tranghese refrained from talking about this being his final season in the job during his remarks at the league's media day Tuesday.But one of the main questions here was who would replace Tranghese, one of the most respected leaders in college sports. The early consensus is that there is no consensus, unlike the Pac-10, which appears to be leaning toward hiring the former Stanford athletic director Ted Leland.The best list I could scrape together includes the senior associate commissioner John Marinatto, the associate commissioner Nick Carparelli, the associate commissioner Dan Gavitt, Louisville Athletic Director Tom Jurich and Connecticut Athletic Director Jeff Hathaway. Don't be surprised if a dark horse emerges, though. Marinatto would be considered the favorite, but there's a lot of golf left to play.The co-chairmen in charge of the search are the Pittsburgh president, Mark A. Nordenberg, and the Georgetown president, John J. DeGioia. Nordenberg checked in by phone to talk about the process. Here are a few highlights.He called it a ""critical hire"" because of all the hard work Tranghese had done to position the Big East among the B.C.S. conferences after the defections to the A.C.C. Nordenberg played down the notion of whether the candidate would be a football or basketball guy; the league has eight football-playing members and 16 in basketball.""In terms of the general functioning of the conference today, I don't really sense that tension as a constant part of life,"" Nordenberg said. ""Clearly both sports are very important to us. It would be hard to imagine that we would recommend someone not committed to both and a capable leader in terms of pushing both sports forward.""Football is generally given priority in college sports because it generates more television and ticket revenue.Nordenberg didn't give a whole lot of hints as to what type of candidate the Big East would be looking for. Tranghese said in his teleconference to announce his impending retirement that he'd prefer his replacement to be someone familiar with the Big East. Nordenberg said that he understood that thinking but that the league would be open to outside candidates as well.Nordenberg said the league would begin a ""deliberate"" search once the school year begins and said that Tranghese had shown flexibility in moving forward.""Mike has been totally himself,"" Nordenberg said, ""indicating that his own personal plans can be adjusted to the needs of the conference. That is, if we find someone early, he'll leave early. If it takes long, and that means extending his time, he can adjust to that as well. We're not locked into any time frame.""Stay tuned to what will surely be one of the most intriguing hires in college sports this year."
