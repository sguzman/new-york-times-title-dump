2013-06-20T00:00:00Z,"SMALL--Trudy N.,MD The Departments of Pediatrics and Laboratory Medicine and the Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center deeply mourn the passing of Trudy N. Small, MD, who died on June 14th, 2013. Dr. Small was an internationally recognized pediatric hematologist who made important contributions in the development of improved transplantation approaches for the treatment of patients with advanced leukemia and children with life-threatening genetic disorders of the immune system. Dr. Small received her medical degree from SUNY Upstate Medical University of Syracuse and residency training in Pediatrics at Duke University and the University of Minnesota. After specialty training in Pediatric Hematology/Oncology at Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center, she joined the faculty in 1987 and thereafter rose to its highest rank of full Member. She was also an Associate Professor of Pediatrics at Weill Cornell Medical College. Dr. Small's research focused on the cellular interactions that control recovery of the immune system after transplantation, and provided the first evidence linking age-related changes in the human thymus with the delayed restoration of cell-mediated immunity observed in older adults after transplantation. She also conducted pioneering studies examining how best to vaccinate patients after transplantation or other cancer treatments to insure full recovery of immunity and protect patients from infection. Her work provided evidence critical to the development of the National Centers for Disease Control's guidelines for vaccination of immunocompromised transplant recipients. Dr. Small's research on lethal genetic immune deficiencies also contributed to more precise characteristics that clarified diagnoses and improved transplantation approaches for curative correction. Dr. Small dedicated her professional life to the care of children who received marrow transplants for life-threatening forms of leukemia and immune deficiency. As a physician and parent, she had a profound understanding of the potentially devastating impact of these diseases on children and their families and how challenging the journey back to health can be. She also had a special way with children that turned fears to confidence and laughter. Dr. Small was beloved by her patients and their families and warmly revered by her many friends and colleagues. She is survived by her husband, Robert Knowles, and her children, Molly and Sam. She will be deeply missed. Richard J. O'Reilly, MD Chair, Department of Pediatrics Melissa S. Pessin, MD, PhD Chair, Department of Laboratory Medicine Jose Baselga, MD, PhD Physician-in-Chief, Memorial Hospital"

2013-06-20T00:00:00Z,"GLADSTEIN--Mathew L.,died on June 18 at his home in Scarsdale, NY. He was 90 years old. ""Mike"" was born in New York City where he attended Townsend Harris High School. After graduating at 16 years old, he attended C.C.N.Y. for two years before enlisting in the Army Air Corps. During World War II, he served as a bombardier-navigator with the 15th Air Force in Italy, attaining the rank of first lieutenant. Upon his return, Mike attended Columbia University. Following an earlier career as an insurance broker and as President of Glenhaven Ltd., he joined Donaldson, Lufkin & Jenrette in 1970 where he worked to integrate theoretical research with trading strategies utilizing options and derivatives. Today, the presence of professionals with quantitative backgrounds on trading desks is commonplace, but in 1973, a gulf existed between traders and academics, and Mr. Gladstein was one of the forerunners in bringing the two disparate cultures together. After engaging Myron S. Scholes and Robert C. Merton to help implement this effort, Mr. Gladstein co-authored with them, two studies of options that were published in the Journal of Business in 1978 and 1982. Since 1951 he has been a resident of Scarsdale, NY where he was active in community affairs. He served as the first President of the Akerman Institute in New York and as President of Scarsdale Family Counseling Services. He chaired local fundraising efforts on behalf of the Federation of Jewish Philanthropies, U.J.A., Brandeis University and The Scarsdale United Fund. Mike is survived by his wife of 63 years, the former Edythe Rosenthal, his children, John, Gina and Joshua, and two granddaughters, Anna and Nina Mullen. Mike's intelligence, his laughter, and his love for his family and friends will forever be remembered and missed; he was our greatest cheerleader. There will be a graveside service at 9:45am on Friday, June 21 at the Hebrew Cemetery on Memory Lane in Greenwich, CT. A reception will follow at the Gladstein home at 85 Morris Lane in Scarsdale, NY."

2013-06-21T00:00:00Z,"SMALL--Trudy N.,MD The Departments of Pediatrics and Laboratory Medicine and the Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center deeply mourn the passing of Trudy N. Small, MD, who died on June 14th, 2013. Dr. Small was an internationally recognized pediatric hematologist who made important contributions in the development of improved transplantation approaches for the treatment of patients with advanced leukemia and children with life-threatening genetic disorders of the immune system. Dr. Small received her medical degree from SUNY Upstate Medical University of Syracuse and residency training in Pediatrics at Duke University and the University of Minnesota. After specialty training in Pediatric Hematology/Oncology at Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center, she joined the faculty in 1987 and thereafter rose to its highest rank of full Member. She was also an Associate Professor of Pediatrics at Weill Cornell Medical College. Dr. Small's research focused on the cellular interactions that control recovery of the immune system after transplantation, and provided the first evidence linking age-related changes in the human thymus with the delayed restoration of cell-mediated immunity observed in older adults after transplantation. She also conducted pioneering studies examining how best to vaccinate patients after transplantation or other cancer treatments to insure full recovery of immunity and protect patients from infection. Her work provided evidence critical to the development of the National Centers for Disease Control's guidelines for vaccination of immunocompromised transplant recipients. Dr. Small's research on lethal genetic immune deficiencies also contributed to more precise characteristics that clarified diagnoses and improved transplantation approaches for curative correction. Dr. Small dedicated her professional life to the care of children who received marrow transplants for life-threatening forms of leukemia and immune deficiency. As a physician and parent, she had a profound understanding of the potentially devastating impact of these diseases on children and their families and how challenging the journey back to health can be. She also had a special way with children that turned fears to confidence and laughter. Dr. Small was beloved by her patients and their families and warmly revered by her many friends and colleagues. She is survived by her husband, Robert Knowles, and her children, Molly and Sam. She will be deeply missed. Richard J. O'Reilly, MD Chair, Department of Pediatrics Melissa S.

The Board of Trustees and Staff of the American Folk Art Museum mourn the passing of our great friend and supporter, Sam Farber, who served as a trustee from 1996-2005, and thereafter, served as trustee emeritus. Sam was a driving force behind the formation of the Museum's Contemporary Center; he was also the person most responsible for the establishment of the Henry Darger Study Center. A disciplined thinker, thoughtful, calm, yet persevering, Sam took on many tasks that others avoided, managing projects and cultivating relationships on behalf of the Museum. He served tirelessly as head of the Building Committee and oversaw the construction at 45 West 53rd Street. His leadership and financial generosity allowed the Museum to pursue ideas and ventures that otherwise would not have been possible. A passionate and avid collector of art brut and art of the self-taught, Sam gave important works to the Museum, which greatly enhanced the collection, and also lent his own works generously, helping to raise awareness of and educate the public about this art. We were inspired by him and will continue to be inspired by his vision for what the Museum could be. He was a man of style, grace, humility, and intellect. He will be sorely missed. The Farber family has asked that contributions in his memory be made to the American Folk Art Museum, Administrative Office, 1865 Broadway, 11th Floor, New York, NY 10023."
2013-06-21T00:00:00Z,"DIAMANDIS--Peter G. Peter had a flair for living and a warmth and character that we couldn't get enough of. His appetite for life, his curiosity, his love of facts and history were insatiable. He was a natural comic, a legendary storyteller, a bold executive and inspirational leader, but more than anything he loved time off digging in his garden or scratching the head of his faithful dog. Peter met his match in wit and intellect 58 years ago in his wife Joan. Though he loved to play her as the fall gal for his jokes and stories, his respect and love for her as his wife and mother of their six children was as constant as his pride in her. Losing Peter as our friend is the greatest loss of all. We will find solace and laugh together remembering all that we shared--the great trips, the holiday dinners, the golf games, the clack of the croquet ball in Ireland, the Diamandis lectures, the countless and priceless ""Peter-isms,"" but mostly his quiet generosity and unquestionable loyalty. We will miss you, good friend. Carter & Howard, Judy & Aaron"

2013-06-22T00:00:00Z,"SMALL--Trudy N.,MD The Departments of Pediatrics and Laboratory Medicine and the Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center deeply mourn the passing of Trudy N. Small, MD, who died on June 14th, 2013. Dr. Small was an internationally recognized pediatric hematologist who made important contributions in the development of improved transplantation approaches for the treatment of patients with advanced leukemia and children with life-threatening genetic disorders of the immune system. Dr. Small received her medical degree from SUNY Upstate Medical University of Syracuse and residency training in Pediatrics at Duke University and the University of Minnesota. After specialty training in Pediatric Hematology/Oncology at Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center, she joined the faculty in 1987 and thereafter rose to its highest rank of full Member. She was also an Associate Professor of Pediatrics at Weill Cornell Medical College. Dr. Small's research focused on the cellular interactions that control recovery of the immune system after transplantation, and provided the first evidence linking age-related changes in the human thymus with the delayed restoration of cell-mediated immunity observed in older adults after transplantation. She also conducted pioneering studies examining how best to vaccinate patients after transplantation or other cancer treatments to insure full recovery of immunity and protect patients from infection. Her work provided evidence critical to the development of the National Centers for Disease Control's guidelines for vaccination of immunocompromised transplant recipients. Dr. Small's research on lethal genetic immune deficiencies also contributed to more precise characteristics that clarified diagnoses and improved transplantation approaches for curative correction. Dr. Small dedicated her professional life to the care of children who received marrow transplants for life-threatening forms of leukemia and immune deficiency. As a physician and parent, she had a profound understanding of the potentially devastating impact of these diseases on children and their families and how challenging the journey back to health can be. She also had a special way with children that turned fears to confidence and laughter. Dr. Small was beloved by her patients and their families and warmly revered by her many friends and colleagues. She is survived by her husband, Robert Knowles, and her children, Molly and Sam. She will be deeply missed. Richard J. O'Reilly, MD Chair, Department of Pediatrics Melissa S. Pessin, MD, PhD Chair, Department of Laboratory Medicine Jose Baselga, MD, PhD Physician-in-Chief, Memorial Hospital"

2013-06-23T00:00:00Z,"SMALL--Trudy N.,MD The Departments of Pediatrics and Laboratory Medicine and the Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center deeply mourn the passing of Trudy N. Small, MD, who died on June 14th, 2013. Dr. Small was an internationally recognized pediatric hematologist who made important contributions in the development of improved transplantation approaches for the treatment of patients with advanced leukemia and children with life-threatening genetic disorders of the immune system. Dr. Small received her medical degree from SUNY Upstate Medical University of Syracuse and residency training in Pediatrics at Duke University and the University of Minnesota. After specialty training in Pediatric Hematology/Oncology at Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center, she joined the faculty in 1987 and thereafter rose to its highest rank of full Member. She was also an Associate Professor of Pediatrics at Weill Cornell Medical College. Dr. Small's research focused on the cellular interactions that control recovery of the immune system after transplantation, and provided the first evidence linking age-related changes in the human thymus with the delayed restoration of cell-mediated immunity observed in older adults after transplantation. She also conducted pioneering studies examining how best to vaccinate patients after transplantation or other cancer treatments to insure full recovery of immunity and protect patients from infection. Her work provided evidence critical to the development of the National Centers for Disease Control's guidelines for vaccination of immunocompromised transplant recipients. Dr. Small's research on lethal genetic immune deficiencies also contributed to more precise characteristics that clarified diagnoses and improved transplantation approaches for curative correction. Dr. Small dedicated her professional life to the care of children who received marrow transplants for life-threatening forms of leukemia and immune deficiency. As a physician and parent, she had a profound understanding of the potentially devastating impact of these diseases on children and their families and how challenging the journey back to health can be. She also had a special way with children that turned fears to confidence and laughter. Dr. Small was beloved by her patients and their families and warmly revered by her many friends and colleagues. She is survived by her husband, Robert Knowles, and her children, Molly and Sam. She will be deeply missed. Richard J. O'Reilly, MD Chair, Department of Pediatrics Melissa S. Pessin, MD, PhD Chair, Department of Laboratory Medicine Jose Baselga, MD, PhD Physician-in-Chief, Memorial Hospital"

2013-06-23T00:00:00Z,"PIELENZ--Hanns A. Died June 13, 2013 at his home in Vero Beach, Florida with his beloved wife and daughters by his side. Pielenz, who alternated between residences in Vero Beach, Bonnigheim, Germany and Harbor Springs, Michigan passed away after a brave and valiant battle against myelofibrosis that began more than two years ago. Hanns Alfred Pielenz was born in Heilbronn, Germany on November 22, 1939. After a stint in banking, he returned to school and graduated from the Academy Hohenstein in 1963 in Textile Management-Engineering. He joined Amann/Ackermann Group, a regional textile business that was founded by his maternal great grandfather in 1854. From 1968 until his retirement in 2005, Mr. Pielenz was Chairman and CEO of the company and under his stewardship the provincial textile manufacturing company became a dominant and innovative leader in the global textile industry. Pielenz's contributions to the industry were recognized in 2009 as he was the first recipient of the Otto-Mecheels Medal for his contributions and innovations to the textile industry. While at the helm of Amann, he was also the Chairman of URS, an Atlanta based refrigerated warehouse company and commuted to Atlanta to manage the company. Under his visionary guidance, URS became one of the largest refrigerated warehouse companies in the US before he sold it in 1997. Knowing he would retire from Amann in 2005, he formed a family office in Atlanta, Georgia in 2000, HAP Investment Group, LLC, and used it as a platform for a multitude of investments including real estate, venture capital, angel investing for start-ups and minority ownership in operating companies. Pielenz loved business and was interested in any investment that provided the opportunity to create value as well as fuel his passion for knowledge and his acumen for business strategy. Pielenz was a brilliant business strategist with a personality and presence that was bigger than life. He loved people and they loved him as he left an indelible mark on everyone he interacted with over the years. He was a mentor to many in the business world and was always eager to provide input, guidance, and motivation though he always set high expectations and empowered people to reach them. He leaves behind a legacy few will fulfill in life as his business contributions provided jobs for thousands of people in many different businesses spread around the globe. His business creed was ""Close ties to the customer and knowledge of the market are the essentials of business success. The secret is passion."" This was not only the motto for his business but his philosophy for living his life as he was passionate about the things he valued. While business strategy was a passion, he dearly loved being in the woods, either hiking with his wife or hunting and he loved golf...though he admitted with pride that his wife was the better golfer. His greatest passion was his family, his wife of 45 years, Christa, who he always referred to as his sweetheart, his daughters, Nici and Katja, and his four grandchildren. Since his diagnosis in 2011, Pielenz worked tirelessly to fund, develop and coordinate resources to find a cure for myelofibrosis. While his efforts were not in time to change his destiny, his legacy will be to continue this research for all of the others suffering from this disease. Hanns Pielenz is survived by his wife, Christa Herzog Pielenz, his daughter Nicola Dowling (Colin), his daughter Katja White (Houston), and his grandchildren Maxie Klemm and Colin, Nicholas and Claire Dowling. The family would like to express its heartfelt appreciation to Dr. Srdan Verstovsek of MD Anderson as well as the entire team in the Leukemia Department who worked tirelessly to help not only Mr. Pielenz but his family on the journey as he battled myelofibrosis. In lieu of flowers, the family requests that contributions be made in his memory to the MPN Clinical Research Center under the direction of Dr. Srdan Verstovsek, Department of Leukemia (Unit 428), The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, 1515 Holcombe Boulevard, Houston, Texas 77030 or The Boys and Girls Club of Vero Beach, 1729 17th Ave., Vero Beach, Florida 32960.

2013-06-23T00:00:00Z,"BRAUNSTEIN--Michael, 67, of Columbus, OH, died at his home on Saturday, June 15, after a brief battle with pancreatic cancer. Michael was a loving husband, father and grandfather and an inventor, humorist, songwriter, and serial entrepreneur. Michael was born in Wooster, OH on September 22, 1945 to Carl and Sara Braunstein. Although born with a clubfoot, he surpassed his disability and he marched with the Wooster High School band in the Macy's Thanksgiving Day Parade. Michael also achieved national recognition as a champion debater. He graduated from Northwestern University in 1967 and from Harvard Business School in 1970. He first became an entrepreneur at age 19, when he launched a paper flower company that counted Neiman Marcus and Avis Rental Cars as clients. Upon returning to Ohio, he became a real estate syndicator and developer. In 1974, he founded Provident United Inc., a multi-family and retail property management company. In 1993, he developed Lane Woods Preserve, an 80 acre residential community which celebrates Colonial Revival American architecture. An avid golfer, he was a member of Scioto Country Club for over thirty years and the Muirfield Village Golf Club for over twenty. Michael's passion for bringing delight to others led to countless writings and inventions, most notably a line of lawn mowers and home furniture which adhered to a design principle he coined as ""funny functionalism."" His infectious smile will be missed by his surviving family: wife, Suzanne; children, Jordan (Brooke), and Whitney; grandchildren, Simone and Calvin; and sister, Carole Brown, of Tucson, AZ. A Memorial Service to celebrate his life will be held at Muirfield Village Golf Club, 5750 Memorial Drive, Dublin, OH on Saturday, June 29, 2013 at 6pm. In lieu of flowers, donations may be made to continue his support of the Ponseti International Association at the University of Iowa: (www.ponseti.info) Michael would have wanted everyone to celebrate life and life at its absurdities, as he did every day. www.schoedinger.com"

Born June 6, 1931 in Englewood, New Jersey, Joan was married for 64 years to Allen Bildner, former Chair and CEO of Kings Super Markets, a family-owned company for 52 years until its 1988 sale to Marks and Spencer. Joan was a long-time leader in the Jewish and secular communities, serving on numerous boards including more recently the Board of Governors of Rutgers University, the Paper Mill Playhouse of Millburn, New Jersey and the Maltz Theatre, Jupiter Florida. She was founding co-chair of the New Jersey/Israel Commission, and co-founder with husband Allen of the Bildner Center for the Study of Jewish Life at Rutgers. Joan received numerous honors and awards recognizing her community service including the Martin Luther King, Jr. Social Justice Lifetime Achievement Award at Dartmouth College, Volunteer of the Year by the National Society of Fundraising Executives, New Jersey, and honorary doctorates from Bloomfield College, Rowan University and Rutgers University. In addition to her devoted husband, Allen, Joan is survived by her loving children, sons Rob and Jim, daughters-in-law Elisa and Nancy, and grandchildren Elana, Lizzie, Ari, Eli and Rafi. She is also survived by her sister, Marion (Milt) Prigoff, and is predeceased by a grandson, Peter. She will be greatly missed by her family, friends and the communities in New Jersey and Florida where she lived, served and played--she was an avid golfer and bridge player.

2013-06-30T00:00:00Z,"WARNER--Rawleigh, Jr.,a retired Chairman of Mobil Oil Corporation, died June 26 in Hobe Sound, Florida. Cause of death was complications from IBM (Inclusion Body Myositis). Mr. Warner was born on February 13, 1921 in Chicago, Illinois and grew up first in Evanston and then in Winnetka, both suburbs of Chicago. His parents were Rawleigh Warner and Dorothy Haskins Warner. He first attended Lake Forest Academy, then Lawrenceville School in New Jersey and finally Princeton. Following his graduation from Princeton University in 1943, Mr. Warner entered the Army of the United States where he served in the Field Artillery with the 10th Mountain Division in Italy. He was awarded the Silver Star, the Bronze Star and the Purple Heart, eventually leaving the Army as Captain in 1946. Prior to joining Mobil, Mr. Warner worked for CONOCO for five years. Mr. Warner joined Socony Vacuum Company, which later became Mobil Oil Corporation, in the Treasurer's Office in 1953. On January 1, 1965 he was elected President of Mobil Oil Corporation and in 1969, became Chairman and CEO. He retired in 1986. When asked what he thought was the most significant contribution he made to Mobil, he said, ""the introduction of a concerted exercise in Executive Development throughout the entire organization"". This involved the Executive Committee and all groups below. Over the years, this activity helped to produce a strong team of young maturing executives. Mr. Warner was also instrumental in the development and support of Masterpiece Theater on the Public Broadcasting System, Advocacy Advertising in certain newspapers and magazines, answering many critics of the industry and the modern design of Mobil stations along with the Corporation's logo with the red ""O"" in Mobil. This later activity was instrumental in letting the public, and particularly Mobil's customers, know that Mobil was a distinctly different and more modern company than that which they had come to know in earlier years. Mr. Warner was a term trustee of Princeton University from 1968 to 1972. He received an Honorary Degree in 1984. From 1981 to 1986 he was Chairman of the Corporation and Foundation Sections of the $53 million campaign and a member of the Resources Committee from 1981 to 1996 for Princeton. He was also a Trustee of Barnard College, Lawrenceville School and the Woodrow Wilson International Center for Scholars. He also received Honorary Degrees from Marietta College in Ohio and Pace University. He served on the Business Roundtable, was chairman of the American Petroleum Institute from which he received their Gold Medal Award, was General Campaign Chairman of the United Fund of Greater New York, member (by Presidential appointment) of the President's Committee for the Arts and served as a Director of American Express, American Telephone and Telegraph, Bristol-Myers Squibb Company, Caterpillar Inc., Chemical Bank, Honeywell, Inc. and Time, Inc. As one of the original Trustees of the Kennedy Center he helped create what is now known as the Kennedy Center. Mr. Warner is survived by his wife, Mary Ann deClairmont Warner, of 66 years, two daughters: Alison (Mrs. Percy R. Pyne, IV), Suzanne (Mrs. Robert W. Parsons), four grandchildren: Rebecca Parsons Bartels, Amalia Pyne Sykes, Rawleigh Warner Pyne, Emily Parsons Talamo, four great grandsons: Graham Howland Bartels, Warner Rutherfurd Talamo, Charles Robert Bartels, and Rawleigh Macrae Sykes and two sisters: Mrs. Dorothy Sills of Wilmette, Illinois and Mrs. Suzanne Kenly of Winnetka, Illinois.

Her death was unexpected but peaceful, and came upon her while she was engaged with her beloved Sunday New York Times crossword puzzle. She is survived by her loving daughters, Claire Crockett Holderness of Brooklyn, and Julia Simms Holderness of Cambridge, Mass., and her grandchildren, Soroush Crockett Vakhshoori and Shahrzad Holderness Vakhshoori, also of Cambridge. Sheila was born in Chicago on October 19, 1939 to Lucy Janis Garvan and Thomas Garvan, a police detective. The first person in her family to graduate from high school, she attended Trinity College in Washington, D.C. on a full scholarship, and then won a prestigious Woodrow Wilson Fellowship, which she used to earn an M. Phil. in American Studies at Yale. One of the few female students at Yale at the time, she throve. Following her marriage to Algernon Sidney Holderness, Jr., Sheila moved from New Haven to New York and exchanged academia for a busy life of motherhood and volunteering. She was moved by a deep concern for people in need, in particular girls, women, and recent immigrants. She sat on the national boards of Girls Incorporated and the Association of Junior Leagues, among others; locally, she sat on the boards of the Brooklyn Historical Society, the Brooklyn Hospital Center, Colony-South Brooklyn Houses, the Packer Collegiate Institute, the Junior League of Brooklyn (of which she was President), and the Korean-American Family Service Center. In her mid forties, Sheila began working full-time. She was Executive Director of the New York Women's Foundation, and later directed development at the NOW Legal Defense and Education Fund, New York Immigration Coalition, and Girl Scouts Council of Greater New York. She was a mentor to her younger colleagues and a friend to many, including the ladies of Mrs. Field's Literary Society, a Brooklyn Heights institution of which she was a member for forty years. As busy as she was, Sheila read voraciously. She travelled the globe. She loved gardening, the arts, and animals, especially baby animals, and she vied with human children for a chance to pet them at the springtime farmers' market. More than anything, Sheila loved her family. Sheila Holderness was brilliant, witty, passionate, fierce, stubborn, and constantly curious. She would deny herself without hesitation, if it meant that she could help someone she cared about. She was a loving, generous mother and grandmother. She was a self-made woman in every respect, steady in her response to life's ups and downs. She always landed on her feet. A memorial service for Sheila will be held in the fall (details to follow).

And later he lived in Spain, like his hero Hemingway, and ate fresh figs, and chased a lot of girls. Later on, back in New York, he met the love of his life, Diane. They were together for over 30 years. He went into advertising, where he was a big success, and invented the slogan, ""Everybody Doesn't Like Something, But Nobody Doesn't Like Sarah Lee"". He loved advertising until he hated it, so he quit to be a writer, and then the hard times came, and never quite left, and he died too young, on June 3, 2013. He was a total original.

2013-07-02T00:00:00Z,"FLANZER--Louis, died peacefully at home in Longboat Key Florida on June 30th, with his loving wife Gloria by his side. He was a man of many interests. Besides his steadfast love and devotion to Gloria, his wife of 66 years, he was a successful real estate developer and manager, businessman and a dedicated philanthropist. His philanthropic interests were varied, including hospitals and healthcare, substance abuse, and Jewish charities. Lou had a particular interest in building bridges between differing faiths and societies. He was a proud veteran of the United States Army and served the country honorably during World War II. Lou was fearless - he overcame his unease at flying by becoming a licensed pilot. A man of warmth and good cheer, Lou Flanzer was the consummate gentleman. He will be missed by all who knew and loved him. Services will be private."
2013-07-02T00:00:00Z,"FLANZER--Louis, 94, of Scarsdale, New York, and Longboat Key, Florida, died yesterday at his Florida home. Born in Brooklyn, he had a quick mind and an independent spirit, and at six years old he was invited to join his adult neighbors playing chess in the park. As a sergeant in the army during World WarII he refused a promotion to stay with his men. After the war he re-joined Flanzer & Son, expanding the business for his father and his brother-in-law. He later became a successful real estate investor and an avid golfer. Facing a fear of flying in the 1960's, he conquered it by learning to fly himself. He got his pilot's license and then gave flying lessons to both his children. His daughter, Jan Flanzer, and her daughter, Jessica Lerner, lovingly remember his wonderful sense of humor, his love of learning and travel, and his respect for truth. His huge smile and twinkling eyes lit up a room, and it was impossible not to smile along with him. He was always ready with a brilliant idea. His passion for the Brooklyn Dodgers survives today in his daughter and granddaughter as a true love of the game. His son, Richard, and Richard's children, David, Ryan, and Jordan Flanzer, will always recall his advice to pursue their dreams fearlessly and with determination. We remember him with tremendous love. He is in our hearts always."

2013-07-05T00:00:00Z,"LUFKIN--Cynthia Joy. Washington Depot, Ct, 1962 2013. Cynthia Lufkin, prominent philanthropist and civic leader in New York and Connecticut, and wife of the co-founder of the Investment banking firm of Donaldson, Lufkin and Jenrette, died the morning of July 3, 2013 at Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Hospital from complications of breast and lung cancer. She was 51 years old. Cynthia was born in Somerville, NJ. She graduated from Trinity College in Hartford, CT. with a degree in biochemistry, during which she was awarded a fellowship in immunology from the University of Connecticut Medical School. She served on the Advisory Council of Trinity College in later years. She was elected to the Board of Directors of The Breast Cancer Research Foundation, where she served as Co-Chair. Cynthia was instrumental in support of the Breast Cancer Research Foundation- Peter Jay Sharp Foundation funded project at Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center on the development of a DNA vaccine for Melanoma, vaccine research led by Drs. Larry Norton, Alan Houghton and Jedd Wolchok. Cynthia had dedicated much fundraising and consciousness-raising energy to the Breast Cancer Research Foundation, driven largely by a need to show women who are recently diagnosed that they can get through it and that life does go on. Her understanding of biochemistry helped in developing, with Memorial Sloan-Kettering, the nutrition and fitness aspects of integrated medicine for cancer patients, and the Cynthia Lufkin Center for Nutrition and Fitness, at the Evelyn Lauder Breast Cancer Center, serves as a focus for this endeavor today. To honor her husband's life-long work, in conjunction with National Audubon Society, she created the annual $100,000 Dan W. Lufkin Prize for Environmental Leadership to recognize ""feet on the ground"" service to the environment. The first recipient of this award was George Archibald, founder of The International Crane Foundation. In 2008, Cynthia was awarded The American Cancer Society Mother of the Year. She served on the board of trustees of Rumsey Hall School in Washington Depot, Ct. She served as a Vice Chair of the Museum of the City of New York Director's Council. She served on the board of the Women's Committee of the Central Park Conservancy. She previously served as a Vice-Chair of Safe Horizon, the nation's leading victim assistance, advocacy, and violence prevention organization. Friends of Cynthia loved her. She was beautiful and intelligent, generous and kind, and more than all, she was loyal. She had an infectious laugh that heralded her love of life and family. She was an accomplished woman in so many ways, but most particularly, she would want to be remembered as an extraordinarily caring and loving wife and mother to her two daughters and one son. She is survived by her husband, Dan, her three children, Schuyler Hazard, Aster Lee Lufkin, Daniel Patrick Lufkin, her mother, Joyce Ford and her brother, Don Henry. There will be a service at the Dune Church in Southampton, Friday, July 12 at 4pm.

Her scholarly and entertaining book, ""Rare Doings At Bath"" was published by the Chicago Art Institute in 1978.

In 1980, Barbara ""retired"" and moved to New York City; she became very involved with the Metropolitan Museum of Art, joining the Friends of The American Wing and the Visiting Committee for the Department of American Decorative Arts (which were her passion). In her later years, she endowed a Curatorship in the American Wing of the Museum in memory of her mother. Refusing to be outshone by her famous father and brother, Barbara was a brilliant, talented, gallant and indomitable figure; an ardent feminist, gifted educator, intrepid traveler to all parts of the globe, and a devoted daughter, sister, aunt, sister-in-law and friend.

He was born in Poland and fled to Siberia during World War II where he spent much of his childhood struggling to survive. He moved to Israel in 1957 and served in the Israeli Army where he met the love of his life, Tzipora Rapaport, his wife of 52 years. Sidney emigrated to the United States in 1961 speaking no English and with no formal education, initially working as a plumber's apprentice. He went on to found the ALFA Piping Corporation, one of the preeminent air conditioning and piping contractors in New York City. Under Sidney's leadership, their work has included the renovation of Carnegie Hall, the 911 Memorial and virtually every hospital and university in New York City. Sidney was beloved by all who knew him for his compassion, humility, wisdom and kindness. He was a generous philanthropist and a strong supporter of the Friends of the Israel Defense Forces (FIDF), which provides scholarships and assistance to former Israeli Soldiers. His greatest accomplishments, however, are his two beautiful daughters, Sharon and Adina, and five exceptional grandchildren, Evan, Nicole, Zachary, Justin and Tyler. Many have already gone on to college educations and earn advanced degrees, things that a boy from Poland could never have imagined. Sidney lived the American dream. He would kiss the ground and pronounce ""God Bless America"" each time he returned home from a trip abroad. He passed away on July 4th. Funeral services will be held, Monday, July 8, 11:30am at Sinai Chapels, Fresh Meadows, NY. Donations in Sidney's honor may be made to FIDF of North Miami Beach.

Devoted husband of 80 years to Blanche, Romie was a notable international philanthropist, scholar and an irreplaceable pillar of the Jewish community. Romie was born in 1910 in London, England. Son of Esriel and Jenny Shapiro, Romie practiced law in England for several years before he met Blanche, his soulmate and the love of his life.

Romie's autobiography, So Far So Good, was dedicated to his wife with the inscription: ""If another person's good qualities far outshine our own, there is no recourse but love."" -Goethe. To know Romie was to love him. He was an inspiration to all who met and knew him. Romie is survived and deeply mourned by Blanche, close friends, family and members of the Bezalel community.

He was born in Poland and fled to Siberia during World War II where he spent much of his childhood struggling to survive. He moved to Israel in 1957 and served in the Israeli Army where he met the love of his life, Tzipora Rapaport, his wife of 52 years. Sidney emigrated to the United States in 1961 speaking no English and with no formal education, initially working as a plumber's apprentice. He went on to found the ALFA Piping Corporation, one of the preeminent air conditioning and piping contractors in New York City. Under Sidney's leadership, their work has included the renovation of Carnegie Hall, the 911 Memorial and virtually every hospital and university in New York City. Sidney was beloved by all who knew him for his compassion, humility, wisdom and kindness. He was a generous philanthropist and a strong supporter of the Friends of the Israel Defense Forces (FIDF), which provides scholarships and assistance to former Israeli Soldiers. His greatest accomplishments, however, are his two beautiful daughters, Sharon and Adina, loving son-in-law, Jeff, and five exceptional grandchildren, Evan, Nicole, Zachary, Justin and Tyler. Many have already gone on to college educations and earn advanced degrees, things that a boy from Poland could never have imagined. Sidney lived the American dream.

She was the daughter of the late Eddie and Claire Felson and sister of the late Sally Fyvolent, of Jacksonville, Florida. Dot was the beloved mother-in-law of Valerie Levy and grandmother of Sasha Levy, Nathan Anderson, Allegra Levy and Cameron Levy. Dot led a very special and happy life, spreading joy and beauty in the world. She had a unique connection with people, as her many friends will attest. Her Southern upbringing in Jacksonville, Florida, informed her aesthetic; she had a keen sense of beauty, style and hospitality which she applied with charm and grace to her world in Manhattan, East Hampton and Wellington, Florida. Dot began her journey northward from Jacksonville in 1953, graduating valedictorian from Landon High School, attending Duke University, and graduating magna cum laude. She was a member of Alph Phi Epsilon sorority, Phi Beta Kappa, was named Azalea Queen at the annual Azalea Fesitval at Charleston, SC, and listed in Who's Who Among Students in American Universities and Colleges. In 1958 she moved to NYC to join the love of her life, John S. Levy, and begin married life. She was a successful model in New York, having posed for many fashion magazines as well as the national US Marines recruiting poster of 1960. In her last days she spoke of how grateful she was for the happy life she'd had, finding tremendous fulfillment from the love of family and friends. She wanted to encourage her children and grandchildren to do their best, as she always did, regretting only that she never got a chance to tell her dear friends that she was in her final days.

2013-07-10T00:00:00Z,"LEVY--Dorothy F.,77, died peacefully on July 8th, surrounded by her beloved husband of 55 years, John, and her two sons, John and Tom. She was the daughter of the late Eddie and Claire Felson and sister of the late Sally Fyvolent, of Jacksonville, Florida. Dot was the beloved mother-in-law of Valerie Levy and grandmother of Sasha Levy, Nathan Anderson, Allegra Levy and Cameron Levy. Dot led a very special and happy life, spreading joy and beauty in the world. She had a unique connection with people, as her many friends will attest. Her Southern upbringing in Jacksonville, Florida, informed her aesthetic; she had a keen sense of beauty, style and hospitality which she applied with charm and grace to her world in Manhattan, East Hampton and Wellington, Florida. Dot began her journey northward from Jacksonville in 1953, graduating valedictorian from Landon High School, attending Duke University, and graduating magna cum laude. She was a member of Alph Phi Epsilon sorority, Phi Beta Kappa, was named Azalea Queen at the annual Azalea Fesitval at Charleston, SC, and listed in Who's Who Among Students in American Universities and Colleges. In 1958 she moved to NYC to join the love of her life, John S. Levy, and begin married life. She was a successful model in New York, having posed for many fashion magazines as well as the national US Marines recruiting poster of 1960. In her last days she spoke of how grateful she was for the happy life she'd had, finding tremendous fulfillment from the love of family and friends. She wanted to encourage her children and grandchildren to do their best, as she always did, regretting only that she never got a chance to tell her dear friends that she was in her final days.

2013-07-10T00:00:00Z,"KAZHDAN--Naum. A renowned photographer who worked with the New York Times for 23 years, whose other pursuits included those of industrial designer, inventor, and an international ambassador of jazz culture known for his lasting efforts to popularize jazz in the USSR, died on Thursday, June 27th, in Brooklyn, NY, of heart failure. He was 74. His death was announced by his wife of 44 years, Lily Kazhdan. Mr. Kazhdan did not fit most people's image of a typical immigrant from the Soviet Union (he and his wife arrived in the US in 1977). Many fellow emigres considered him unusually acculturated to New York's elegant, jazz era-inspired style. His work, however, belied admitted inspiration from Russian art of the early 20th century, along with multiple other sources. Mr. Kazhdan's photographic work was marked by a lasting humanist influence: ever interested in depicting relations between people and objects in the frame of his camera, he integrated rich psychological drama not only into his countless group portraits, but into his nature morte and cityscape shots. Born in Leningrad (now St. Petersburg), Russia, three years before World War II, Mr. Kazhdan, as a child, lived through the horrendous Siege of Leningrad, the Nazi blockade of the city in 1942-44. Post-war he emerged as a talented young photographer, receiving his first major award at 19, at a Warsaw Poland-based jazz photo contest accompanying the International Jazz Jamboree. Another early and life-spanning passion was jazz: Naum had played double bass in home-grown bands in his early teens. Aged 18, he found himself a founding president of Leningrad's first officially permitted jazz club, D-58, which became the local epicenter of jazz life, and triggered the precipitate spread of jazz culture throughout the USSR. As a photographer, he immortalized some of the historical moments of this eastward jazz invasion, including startling images from Dizzy Gillespie's first concert tour of Russia. Many more star-studded jazz photographs followed, as well as some recognizable jazz record jackets. In 1998 he was instrumental in organizing jazz festivities in St. Petersburg, Russia in commemoration of the 40th anniversary of D-58 where Naum received the first Voice of America's Willis Conover Award. As an industrial art designer, Naum worked at the Leningrad Scientific Research Institute of Shipbuilding. Through his own initiative at the institute he pioneered the development of the first advertizing department for the USSR Ministry of Shipbuilding. After leaving the institute, he used his experience to open his own independent photography studio with which he gained prestigious contracts with the Leningrad House of Fashion, and the entertainment company Lenconcert. Shortly after immigration to the US, he landed a studio photographer's job at the New York Times. Naum made a reputation for himself as a concept photographer capable of breathing life into any content; his unconventional photo illustrations included an iconic image of a butcher's axe accompanying a tax-cutting article. Later in his American career, Mr. Kazhdan did not abandon his Russian roots. In the mid-1990s, he helped launch a festival of Russian jazz in New York; and he participated in multiple projects documenting the history of jazz movement in Russia. Until his last days, he kept close relations with St. Petersburg's jazz community among which he was treated as a revered founding father. His passionate life lived by both sides of the Atlantic was an emblematic precursor of the globally connected cultural world in which we live today. He is survived by his wife Lily, and son Alex."

2013-07-10T00:00:00Z,"HOLAND--Sidney Joshua. Beloved husband, father, saba, brother and uncle. Sidney's life is a testimony to love, resilience and integrity. He was born in Poland and fled to Siberia during World War II where he spent much of his childhood struggling to survive. He moved to Israel in 1957 and served in the Israeli Army where he met the love of his life, Tzipora Rapaport, his wife of 52 years. Sidney emigrated to the United States in 1961 speaking no English and with no formal education, initially working as a plumber's apprentice. He went on to found the ALFA Piping Corporation, one of the preeminent air conditioning and piping contractors in New York City. Under Sidney's leadership, their work has included the renovation of Carnegie Hall, the 9/11 Memorial and virtually every hospital and university in New York City. Sidney was beloved by all who knew him for his compassion, humility, wisdom and kindness. He was a generous philanthropist and a strong supporter of the Friends of the Israel Defense Forces (FIDF), which provides scholarships and assistance to former Israeli Soldiers. His greatest accomplishments, however, are his two beautiful daughters, Sharon and Adina, loving son-in-law, Jeff, and five exceptional grandchildren, Evan, Nicole, Zachary, Justin and Tyler. Many have already gone on to college educations and earn advanced degrees, things that a boy from Poland could never have imagined. Sidney lived the American dream. He would kiss the ground and pronounce ""God Bless America"" each time he returned home from a trip abroad. He passed away on July 4th. Funeral services will be held, Monday, July 8, 11:30am at Sinai Chapels, Fresh Meadows, NY. Donations in Sidney's honor may be made to FIDF of North Miami Beach. Sidney will be missed by all who knew him. He will never be forgotten."

2013-07-10T00:00:00Z,"DURKIN--William A. Jr.,age 85, passed away peacefully, on July 6, 2013 at Greenwich Hospital with his family by his side. He was born January 29, 1928 to William A. Durkin and Margaret Durkin, graduated from the University of Notre Dame in 1949, with a degree in civil engineering, and served in the US Army during the Korean War. Following his discharge, he joined the Walsh Construction Company where he became its Executive Vice President and spent his entire career working on major industrial and commercial projects throughout the US and abroad, including the United Nations and renovation of Yankee Stadium amongst others in New York. He was particularly proud of his family's long association with Walsh Construction which his father joined in 1914. Bill volunteered his engineering expertise to many non-profit organizations, guiding projects for Greenwich Hospital, Brunswick School, YMCA, and Stepping Stones Museum, to name a few. He served on several boards and chaired the Brunswick School Board of Trustees in the 1980's. In recent years, he enjoyed his service of residents at the St. Camillus Nursing Home in Stamford. Although he traveled extensively for work, volunteerism and service at home played a large role in his life which he impressed on each of his sons. An athlete, Bill's interest in team sports, whether as a participant or observer, were exceeded only by his love of golf, fly-fishing and skiing, each of which he excelled at and spent countless hours teaching his sons and grandchildren. He could shoot his age, coax a trout to a dry fly and, as recently as February, was skiing in Vermont. He was a member of the Greenwich Country Club, Ekwanok Country Club and the Beaverkill Trout Club. A true gentleman, mentor and friend to many, Bill leaves behind his wife of nearly 60 years, Ginny, sons Bill, Patrick, Tim, Tom and Dan; daughters-in- law Martha, Kristen, Liz, Sue and Susan, and fifteen grandchildren. A funeral mass will be held at St. Michael's Church, Greenwich, Connecticut, on Thursday, July 11 at 1:00pm. There will not be calling hours. Bill's family requests, that in lieu of flowers, contributions may be made to the Cancer Research Institute (in memory of William A. Durkin, Jr.), 55 Broadway, Suite 1802, New York, NY 10006, or the William B. Nollman Memorial Caddy Scholarship Fund, c/o the Greenwich Country Club."

Marcia was born in 1925 in Philadelphia, PA, the daughter of Fanny (Abrams) and Harry Dembow, a family involved in the pioneering stages of producing, distributing, and exhibiting motion pictures. Her first job, after graduating from Bryn Mawr College in 1947, was as Assistant to the Fashion Editor at The Philadelphia Inquirer, where she was later a Feature Reporter and wrote for The Sunday Magazine. Under three different bylines, she wrote for what was then considered to be ""women's pages""--fashion, beauty, food, interior decorating, and even advice to the lovelorn. Next came marriage to David Strousse, and then a move to Stamford, CT in 1955, where as a full-time mother, they raised three children in both Stamford and East Brewster, MA for Cape Cod summers. After the marriage ended, she revamped her career when she joined Golf Digest Magazine in 1968 as Assistant Promotion Manager two weeks after Golf Digest was purchased by The New York Times Company. She was subsequently named Vice President (one of the first NYT female vice presidents) of Marketing and Communications for the entire NYT magazine group. Upon her retirement in 1992, she started her own successful event/marketing company, Current Events. Marcia was active in the community, serving on the Board of Ferguson Library in Stamford, CT, and volunteering at the Stamford Museum & Nature Center, Southfield Neighborhood Village, and leading a Girl Scout troop. Her retirement days were busy with numerous book clubs, exercise classes, and volunteering at AmeriCares, and the Fairfield Alumnae of Bryn Mawr College, most recently serving on the annual Alumnae Seminar Committee. She is survived by her three children, Cynthia Strousse of Boston, MA; Tracy Strousse of Burbank, CA, and David Strousse of Hartland, VT as well as Victoria, her daughter-in-law and her two beloved granddaughters: Rose Simone and Kate Caroline. She is also survived by her sister, Shirley Bornstein of Philadelphia, PA, and her nephews, Barry Bornstein of Philadelphia and Steve Bornstein of Venice, CA. While Marcia always appreciated a well-planned event, she requested a private family memorial celebration.

2013-07-12T00:00:00Z,"KELLOGG--Spencer II, of Old Brookville, New York, died peacefully in his sleep on June 20. He was born in Buffalo, NY on December 9, 1913, to Cyrena (Case) and Howard Kellogg Sr. After graduating from Nichols School and Cornell University with a degree in engineering, he took a job as a field engineer with Sperry Gyroscope Company. In 1942 as a Research Engineer at Sperry, he combined the gyroscope instrument with a remotely located electric flux valve, producing the first compass that accurately displayed an airplane's heading in a turn. During WWII he was on the design team for the A-5 autopilot which was installed on the B-24 bombers as well as the S-1 bombsight. In 1976 he received the Pioneer in Aviation award for developing the revolutionary ""Zero Reader"" (flight director). This flight instrument synthesizes input from many sources (attitude, altitude, heading, navigation aids, radio signals) into a single display dramatically reducing the pilot's workload and greatly increasing flight safety. Spen had a lifelong interest in aviation, earning his pilot's license at age seventeen, and flying for the next seventy-one years. In 2004 he was awarded the first FAA Master Pilot Award given in the New York area for 70 years of safe flying. His work at Sperry offered him the opportunity to test fly his inventions in many different airplanes, including the AT6 and the B-17. In 1966 he flew his single engine Navion to France, and back. Spencer Kellogg served as a village trustee and treasurer for Old Brookville. He was predeceased by his wife of sixty-seven years, Mary Louise Webster, and his daughter-in-law Winifred Kellogg of Erie, CO.

McCourt, passed away peacefully on July 11th at CT Hospice, with his devoted and loving wife, Mary Bryant McCourt at his side, after a long battle with metastatic melanoma. David leaves behind his wife Mary, two twin sons, Tavis and Stephen McCourt, two daughters, Elizabeth Smith and Kathy Paine, nine grandchildren and his sister, Mary McCourt Sheffield. David graduated from St. Francis Preparatory School in Biddeford, Maine in 1959, the University of Hartford in 1966, and Atlanta University in 1969 with a Masters in Business Administration. David was an avid baseball player in his youth playing throughout high school and college, and enlisted in the United States Marine Corps Reserves in 1963. In 1969 David joined the family business, ABCO Welding Supply, with his brother Bill and father William. David found a true passion in his sales role at ABCO and started a welding school during his tenure at ABCO. David moved to Old Saybrook, Connecticut in 1980, and enjoyed coaching Little League Baseball, skiing and running around north cove. In 1986, David and his brother Bill succeeded their father in running ABCO, and together with a group of talented and hard-working employees, grew the business consistently for 25 years before selling ABCO in 2011. In 1994, David married Ruth Clifford of Cork, Ireland, and moved to Newton, Massachussets. In 1997, David and Ruth were blessed with the birth of a daughter, Juliana Valentine.

David became a prominent supporter of the Achilles Freedom Team of Wounded Veterans, which Mary had founded through Achilles International, and the McCourt Memorial Garden at the Lyman Allen Museum. David enjoyed playing the game of golf (a game he always loved if never mastered) as a member at the Black Hall, Old Lyme Country Club and Lake of Isles Country Club in Connecticut and Trump International in Florida, where he retired and took residence.

He was born in Buffalo, NY on December 9, 1913, to Cyrena (Case) and Howard Kellogg Sr. After graduating from Nichols School and Cornell University with a degree in engineering, he took a job as a field engineer with Sperry Gyroscope Company. In 1942 as a Research Engineer at Sperry, he combined the gyroscope instrument with a remotely located electric flux valve, producing the first compass that accurately displayed an airplane's heading in a turn. During WWII he was on the design team for the A-5 autopilot which was installed on the B-24 bombers as well as the S-1 bombsight. In 1976 he received the Pioneer in Aviation award for developing the revolutionary ""Zero Reader"" (flight director). This flight instrument synthesizes input from many sources (attitude, altitude, heading, navigation aids, radio signals) into a single display dramatically reducing the pilot's workload and greatly increasing flight safety. Spen had a lifelong interest in aviation, earning his pilot's license at age seventeen, and flying for the next seventy-one years. In 2004 he was awarded the first FAA Master Pilot Award given in the New York area for 70 years of safe flying. His work at Sperry offered him the opportunity to test fly his inventions in many different airplanes, including the AT6 and the B-17. In 1966 he flew his single engine Navion to France, and back. Spencer Kellogg served as a village trustee and treasurer for Old Brookville. He was predeceased by his wife of sixty-seven years, Mary Louise Webster, and his daughter-in-law Winifred Kellogg of Erie, CO. He leaves his sons, Spencer Kellogg III of Erie, CO; Richard (Pamela) of Huntington, VT; David (Cynthia) of Oyster Bay; and his daughters Jean Pettibone (Peter) of New York City, and Mary Louise Lyman (Philip) of Gambrils, MD; fourteen grandchildren; and nine great-grandchildren.

2013-07-14T00:00:00Z,"BURTO--William Charles. William Charles Burto died peacefully in his sleep in Cambridge Massachusetts, on July 5, after five years of treatment for multiple myeloma. Born in North Creek, New York, in 1921, Burto graduated from Colgate University in 1942, where he had become a New York State Collegiate Champion skier. In his senior year he was accepted into Harvard's Ph.D. program in English literature, but upon receiving his undergraduate degree he immediately volunteered for service in the Navy. He saw action in both the Atlantic and Pacific, surviving the sinking of his ship at Guadalcanal in 1943. (He was on the bridge of the ship, operating radar equipment, when a bomb killed the captain, a few yards away). At the end of World War II he entered the graduate program at Harvard, assisted by the G.I. Bill, but in 1948 he took a two-year leave of absence to teach English at the University of Iowa, in Iowa City. He then returned to Harvard, completed his Ph.D. in 1954, and began teaching at Lowell State College, soon to become part of the University of Massachusetts, where he served as chair of the Department of English. In 1982 he retired. Burto was the co-author (with Sylvan Barnet, Morton Berman, William E. Cain, and Marcia Stubbs) of several highly successful college textbooks on literature, drama, and composition. He was also the editor of the Signet Classic Edition of Shakespeare's sonnets (with an introduction by W.H. Auden) and of Shakespeare's narrative poems (with an introduction by William Empson). In 1963 he and Sylvan Barnet (his partner since 1952) became interested in Japanese art, especially early calligraphy and Buddhist art, and in subsequent years they assembled a collection that has been exhibited at the Museum of Fine Arts (Boston), the Metropolitan Museum, the Freer/Sackler Galleries, and the Harvard Art Museum. The Metropolitan exhibition was accompanied by a catalog, The Written Image: Japanese Calligraphy and Painting (2002) by Miyeko Murase and others. As an octogenarian and then a nonagenarian he occasionally reflected on his life (especially his survival at Guadalcanal) and his imminent death; at such moments he always remarked that he had been extremely fortunate in being long-lived and very happy. A devoted gardener as well as a serious collector of art, he cherished lines by Walter Savage Landor (who lived a mere 89 years): ""Nature I loved and, next to Nature, Art:/I warmed both hands before the fire of life;/It sinks, and I am ready to depart."" William Burto is survived by Barnet, by a niece, Sheila Wilson, and by five Geraghty nephews, Elihu, Ennis, Jonathan, Kevin, and Sean. We wish to express our deepest gratitude to Harvard Vanguard Medical Associates and to VNA Care Network and Hospice for their unstinting tender support."

He attended James Madison High School, class of '37, graduating at 16 years old; Brooklyn College, class of '41, which he graduated at age 20; and NYU, where he graduated with an MBA in 1943 at age 22. He completed Brooklyn Law School in 1949 and was admitted to the New York State Bar that same year, thereafter qualifying as a certified public accountant in New York State. Among his many clients, he was always proud to have served the Lawyers Guild in its youth. He counted numerous former clients as dear, life-long friends, who relied on him both for his knowledge and his calm sensible advise. Daniel Turchin took complete joy in every aspect of life. He was a violinist, an athlete, and bridge player.

2013-07-16T00:00:00Z,"STANLEY--Vada Shell. One of the kindest, gentlest, most loving people in the world is no longer with us. Vada Shell Stanley, 80, passed away peacefully at home in New Canaan, Connecticut on July 13 after a long illness. Many of those who knew her could think of no better word than ""angel"" to describe her. Wherever she went, Vada Stanley impressed people as a very special person. She might have won any beauty contest she entered, but her beauty was more than skin deep; inside there was a beautiful soul. She could be and was a charming dinner companion for people like Bill Clinton and Prince Charles, among others, but the same warm charm was there for absolutely everyone who crossed her path. A key thing that made her so very special was her way of making each of us feel we were special to her. A rare combination of compassion, acceptance and love radiated from her being. Born in 1933 in the rolling hills of Kentucky, she had a life that was charmed in many ways but with challenges as well. Hers was a loving family but not one in which people went to college. She did by earning all the money needed with jobs through her high school and college years. Not long after that she had to face the need to end a disastrous marriage with two tiny children to support, Bill and Glee, and no help from their father. At that challenging time in her life she got a job, a rare one for women then, as a marketing management trainee at the home office of Procter & Gamble. There she met and married (three years later) Ted Stanley who worked in the same office in a similar job. Their 52-year marriage was a happy one; her husband never got over his great good luck in having found her. They had one son, Jonathan, who appreciated her just as much. After their marriage in 1961, they moved to Westport, Connecticut and have lived in New Canaan, CT since 1996 with, at various times, second homes in Manhattan, Santa Fe and Vermont. Vada Stanley was quite simply one of the most wonderful people in all the world, and she will be long remembered by everyone fortunate enough to know her. May she rest in peace and find as much joy in another world as she gave to us. A memorial service to be held at a later date."

2013-07-19T00:00:00Z,"HILL--Louis G.,89, former Common Pleas Court Judge and State Senator passed away on Saturday, July 13th after a lengthy illness with dementia. Born March 10, 1924, in Palm Beach, FL to Crawford Hill and Ann (Kaufman) Hill. Beloved husband for 36 years to Marilyn (Ashton) Young Hill, married in 1977. Formerly married (1951) to Jane (Cox) Hill, now MacElree for 25 years. Hill is the proud father of seven children, 10 grandchildren, four stepchildren and nine step-grandchildren. He had one sister, four stepsiblings and two half-siblings. Hill graduated from St. George's School in Newport, RI in 1942 and Harvard College in 1944 (accelerated class of 1946 due to WWII). He was an undefeated heavyweight boxer at Harvard and served with the US Marines as a captain during both WWII and Korea. He graduated from the University of Pennsylvania Law School in 1949. In the early 1950s he joined the law firm of Dilworth, Paxson, Kalish and Levy as a trial lawyer where for 27 years he never lost a case decided by a jury. Lou Hill first became active in politics as a volunteer campaigning in the 1940s for his stepfather, Richardson Dilworth, mayor of Philadelphia from 1956 to 1962. In 1966 Hill was elected to the Pennsylvania State Senate and served three terms. As Chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee, a position he held for over seven years, he was deeply involved in the passage of every law. In the early 1970s Hill was responsible for driving through the legislature the first Crimes and Juvenile Code in Pennsylvania's history. Hill was also the prime sponsor or co-sponsor of hundreds of bills and over 60 became law. He consistently voted to provide funds for the State Crime Commission and the Special Prosecutor Investigating political corruption in Philadelphia. In 1975 he ran unsuccessfully as a Democrat against incumbent Mayor Frank Rizzo. Hill presided as a Common Pleas judge in Philadelphia for over 20 years. He inspired his children and friends with a love for the wilderness. On one memorable weeklong hike his wife, Marilyn, was initiated to the Appalachian Trail on their honeymoon with Hill's children. Starting in the 1950s Hill could often be found early in the morning running the bridle path in Philadelphia along the Wissahickon Creek somewhere between Lincoln Drive, Valley Green and Bell's Mill. After his run he would finish his workout in his basement home gym before going to work at a time when the term home gym was not known. His children are Crawford Hill and his wife, Suzie of Ardmore, PA; Leslie Hill, her husband Dennis Carroll of Chevy Chase, MD; Jessie B. Hill and her husband, Ming Fang of Kauai, HI; Thomas G. Hill and his wife, Nancy Hagens, of Newton, MA; Michael C. Hill and his wife, Susan Bear, of Newton, MA; Charlotte Hill and her husband, Marc Henrich, of San Francisco, CA and Ann Hill of Newtown Square, PA. His stepchildren are Anita Young of Philadelphia, PA; Edwin Germaine (deceased) of Hawaii; Michelle Peretz and her husband Amiel Peretz of Pound Ridge, NY, and Melissa Young of Jenkintown, PA. He is also survived by his half-sister, Deborah (Dilworth) Bishop, of Bryn Mawr, PA and his half-brother, Richardson Dilworth, Jr., and his wife, Leslie Dilworth, of Galisteo, NM. His sister, Marie Townsend, died in 1976. He is also survived by his stepbrother, Warden Dilworth, of Portland, ME and stepsister, Anne Hackett, of Villanova, PA.

2013-07-21T00:00:00Z,"STANLEY--Vada Shell. One of the kindest, gentlest, most loving people in the world is no longer with us. Vada Shell Stanley, 80, passed away peacefully at home in New Canaan, Connecticut on July 13 after a long illness. Many of those who knew her could think of no better word than ""angel"" to describe her. Wherever she went, Vada Stanley impressed people as a very special person. She might have won any beauty contest she entered, but her beauty was more than skin deep; inside there was a beautiful soul. She could be and was a charming dinner companion for people like Bill Clinton and Prince Charles, among others, but the same warm charm was there for absolutely everyone who crossed her path. A key thing that made her so very special was her way of making each of us feel we were special to her. A rare combination of compassion, acceptance and love radiated from her being. Born in 1933 in the rolling hills of Kentucky, she had a life that was charmed in many ways but with challenges as well. Hers was a loving family but not one in which people went to college. She did by earning all the money needed with jobs through her high school and college years. Not long after that she had to face the need to end a disastrous marriage with two tiny children to support, Bill and Glee, and no help from their father. At that challenging time in her life she got a job, a rare one for women then, as a marketing management trainee at the home office of Procter & Gamble. There she met and married (three years later) Ted Stanley who worked in the same office in a similar job. Their 52-year marriage was a happy one; her husband never got over his great good luck in having found her. They had one son, Jonathan, who appreciated her just as much. After their marriage in 1961, they moved to Westport, Connecticut and have lived in New Canaan, CT since 1996 with, at various times, second homes in Manhattan, Santa Fe and Vermont. Vada Stanley was quite simply one of the most wonderful people in all the world, and she will be long remembered by everyone fortunate enough to know her. May she rest in peace and find as much joy in another world as she gave to us. A memorial service to be held at a later date."

2013-07-28T00:00:00Z,"WANDELT--Frederick H. Long time admissions director Frederick H. ""Ferdie"" Wandelt III dies at 65. February 10, 1948 July 25, 2013. For more than 30 years, Ferdie Wandelt was the face of the Taft School in Watertown, CT. He traveled the globe seeking the best and brightest students. He died Thursday due to sudden complications of acute lymphoblastic leukemia, surrounded by family and friends. ""From the outset, Ferdie understood two interrelated principles,"" said Taft Headmaster Emeritus Lance Odden. ""First, that attracting the best mix of diversely talented students would create a uniquely spirited community; and second, that the vibrancy so created would elevate Taft's place in the community of schools."" No school has ever had a finer admissions leader. The son of Fred and Susie Wandelt, Ferdie grew up in Princeton, New Jersey. A graduate of Taft and the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, he returned to Taft, after service with the National Guard, in the fall of 1971 to join the Admissions Office, earning an MALS degree at Wesleyan University. In 1976, he succeeded Joe Cunningham as director of admissions. ""He transformed our school,"" said Odden. ""It is impossible to capture all Ferdie was to Taft and to thousands who knew and loved him,"" said current Taft headmaster Willy MacMullen. ""With his death, we have lost a great man, someone who will join the list of legendary educators who devoted their lives to our school, and someone who served with an unparalleled love, passion, and loyalty."" For the next four decades, he was a beloved figure on campus, but his service to the larger educational community meant he was also a globally respected leader. He was a board member of ASSIST (American Secondary Schools for International Students and Teachers); president of the SSATB (Secondary School Admissions Test Board); and a trustee for the Challengers Boys and Girls Club of Los Angeles. Other scholarship organizations, like Prep for Prep and the Wight Foundation, knew Ferdie as a supportive and visionary leader. Peer schools were made better because he helped open doors in international recruitment, and he shared his best ideas with them. ""It's about helping all schools and kids,"" he said often. ""He was much more than just the finest admissions director in the country,"" said MacMullen. ""Ferdie had a unique humor, warmth, and grace. After you met him in an interview, you wanted to attend Taft. And in those twenty minutes, Ferdie could 'read' a candidate with a sensitivity and insight that was astonishing. Those who were admitted felt blessed, and somehow, those who were not felt that he cared deeply and personally, and indeed, Ferdie regularly counseled families and helped them find another school that was a better fit."" He traveled the world telling the Taft story. He was a superb girls' lacrosse coach, and scores of young teachers sought him for advice. Ferdie changed Taft, and he changed lives. He is survived by his wife Joanna, brother Joseph ""Sandy"" Wandelt of Sicklerville, NJ, daughter Allison Halsell her husband Benjamin, of New Canaan, CT, son Christopher Wandelt and his wife Erin of Redding, CT, and five grandchildren. In lieu of flowers, donations may be made to The Frederick H. Wandelt III '66 Scholarship Fund, The Taft School, 110 Woodbury Road, Watertown, CT 06795. There will be a memorial service at Taft on Saturday, September 28."

2013-07-28T00:00:00Z,"DOLGENOS--Sally Ashley. Sally, known to her family as ""Hawkeye,"" died of cancer on July 10, 2013 at age 78. She died at her own home, surrounded by loved ones. As a teenager in the Midwest, Sally accompanied her father on business trips to Manhattan and fell in love with the city. At age 19 she left home to work in New York at Life magazine in the 1950's ""Mad Men"" era- living at women's hotels like the Barbizon where gentlemen callers had to be checked out by the downstairs matron. On a blind date Sally met handsome young David Dolgenos and they quickly fell in love. Protestant Sally broke cultural barriers when, in 1956, she married David, a Jewish man, despite intense family objections. The couple moved to Pleasantville, NY, for life in the suburbs: four children born in under five years. Sally somehow managed to get the kids through school while participating in local amateur theater and, later, politics. She sang in The Music Man, contacted the dead in Blithe Spirit, and channeled Marilyn Monroe in her portrayal of Helen of Troy. In the 1960's, inspired by the women's movement, Sally returned to college, earning a BA from Sarah Lawrence College and a master's degree from Columbia University. She went back to theater at another level, performing in plays by Ibsen and Beckett. She studied with Gerda Lerner and Santha Rama Rau, and ran for County Legislator and Town Clerk. Throughout her life, Sally wrote: stories and poems, movie reviews for the local paper. Writing was a passion and an avocation for her. At age 42, Sally returned to live in New York City, the place she'd loved best since childhood. She never moved away again. Amicably divorced from David, she lived in her own book-filled apartment on the Upper West Side. She took her children and grandchildren to Broadway and introduced them to opera- she particularly loved Italian opera. In New York, Sally formed a company with best friend Judy Paine. She published a book: ""Connecting: A Handbook for Housewives Returning to Paid Work"" and appeared on the Today Show. The first book was followed by a biography of Franklin P. Adams and ""The Devil's Cradle,"" a ripping supermarket paperback in which, among other things, a pack of wild dogs attacks a librarian. Sally used her literary skills to help others, teaching reading to illiterate adults in New York City as center director at Literacy Partners. Her children grew up and moved to California, Philadelphia and England, but Sally always had a home for them in New York with laughter and political talk late into the night. Her grandchildren adored her. She faced colon cancer at age 70 and beat it. She met with another form of abdominal cancer at age 78 and fought hard but couldn't defeat it again. Sally was a proud American patriot, great-granddaughter of radical congressman James M. Ashley I who wrote the 13th amendment to the Constitution-the amendment that freed the slaves. In that same spirit, Sally always took the part of the underrepresented, the disenfranchised, the weak and the sick and the lonely. She was a passionate advocate and had a generous spirit. One of Sally's last projects was a short video in which she portrayed the mother in ""Psycho""- she saw the ridiculous even in infirmity and disease and we'll remember how she laughed. A memorial service will be held at 4pm on Tuesday, August 13, 2013, at Marshall Field, Sarah Lawrence College, Bronxville, NY. Goodbye to Sally, Mom, Hawkeye from her loving family. A fine life."

Remembering De Maria, Larry Gagosian said, ""Walter and I worked together for more than twenty-five years. He was an acutely insightful artist whose integrity was unquestionable. His sense of space, and the meticulous yet intuitive way in which he approached art making, were unparalleled. I was proud to exhibit his work, and to count him as a friend.""

Tom was one-of-kind, whose love of family and friends was never ending. He lived a vibrant and diverse life, driven and defined by his passion for intellectual growth and his personal ethical code.

For those of us who knew him, who were privileged to brush against his vital and provocative nature, he lives on! The ripples from his kindness, wisdom, sensibility and wit endure. So too, his divine lickety-split petit allegros, even his excesses, which were excessive, his passion for dancing and dancers, and his knowledge of ballet technique combined with his intellect and his gift for cajolery to impart the lesson to we who were eager, so eager. He lives forever within us. He has become a part of who we are. Indelible. It seems only appropriate that Dick should have the last word, as was his wont and dessert deserved. Accordingly: in ballet class, half a century plus ago, though it seems like yesterday, at the conclusion of the Grand Allegro, he opined to the class and to the Gods if they would only listen and learn ""the cow jumped over the moon but he was still a cow"".

2013-07-31T00:00:00Z,"THOMAS--Richard, known affectionately as Dick, master ballet teacher, mentor, willful iconoclast, sublimely human and adored by umpteen generations of dancers, is said to have died on Saturday morning July 27. For those of us who knew him, who were privileged to brush against his vital and provocative nature, he lives on! The ripples from his kindness, wisdom, sensibility and wit endure. So too, his divine lickety-split petit allegros, even his excesses, which were excessive, his passion for dancing and dancers, and his knowledge of ballet technique combined with his intellect and his gift for cajolery to impart the lesson to we who were eager, so eager. He lives forever within us. He has become a part of who we are. Indelible. It seems only appropriate that Dick should have the last word, as was his wont and dessert deserved. Accordingly: in ballet class, half a century plus ago, though it seems like yesterday, at the conclusion of the Grand Allegro, he opined to the class and to the Gods if they would only listen and learn ""the cow jumped over the moon but he was still a cow"". Eliot Feld, Christine Sarry, Daniel Levans, we three his students, and all at Ballet Tech, past, present and future. With love."

2013-07-31T00:00:00Z,"FLANIGAN--Peter M. June 21, 1923 - July 29, 2013. Mr. Flanigan was a Navy carrier pilot in World War II. He graduated Summa Cum Laude from Princeton University in 1947 and joined Dillon, Read & Co. Inc. in the fall of that year. His tenure at Dillon Read was interrupted in 1949 to serve as an economic analyst for the Economic Reconstruction Administration in Britain for two years, returning thereafter to Dillon Read. In 1960 Mr. Flanigan served as Executive Director of Volunteers for the Nixon-Lodge Presidential campaign and in 1968 as Deputy Campaign Manager of the Nixon campaign. In 1969 Mr. Flanigan left Dillon Read upon his appointment as Assistant to the President of the United States under President Nixon, with White House responsibility for domestic commercial and economic matters. In 1972 he was also appointed Director of the Council of International Economic Policy, with responsibility for development and coordination of the Administration's international economic policy. Mr. Flanigan returned to Dillon Read as Managing Director at the beginning of 1975 and continued in that capacity until December 1992. In 1984, Peter Flanigan and his wife adopted the second class in the ""I Have a Dream"" Program, subsequently becoming a Board Member of that program. In 1985, Mr. Flanigan founded The Student Sponsor Partners, a private voucher program which combines tuition support with one-on-one mentoring. S/SP has helped over 5,000 inner-city high school students. Based on comparative graduation rates and college attendance rates, this program has been a dramatic success. In 1987, he started the Patrons Program to encourage individuals to take responsibility for inner-city Catholic grammar schools which were in danger of being closed for financial reasons. Mr. Flanigan was a Board member of St. Ann's School in Harlem, a small grammar school with 315 students. Upon his death, Mr. Flanigan was Board Member of American Federation for Children - Alliance for School Choice, a nation-wide organization to promote legislation to give parents the ability to send their children to the schools, public or private, of their choice. To research and implement new programs to improve education, Mr. Flanigan founded the Center for Education Innovation of The Manhattan Institute. He was a Board member of the Catholic University of America, and previous Chairman of the Board of Portsmouth Abbey School. Mr. Flanigan was also a member of the Board of Trustees of the John M. Olin Foundation, Inc. and a member of the Board of the Richard M. Nixon Library & Birthplace. In 1954, Mr. Flanigan married Brigid Snow, daughter of the legendary Carmel Snow who was founding editor of Harpers Bazaar, a position she held for 23 years, and grand niece of the equally legendary Bishop McQuade of Dublin, known to his flock as the Holy Terror. His wife, Brigid, passed away in 2006. Brigid and Peter's five children include Sister Louise Marie of the Sister Servants of the Eternal Word. His other children, Brigid, Tim, Megan and Bob are the parents of Peter's 16 grandchildren. Five years ago, Peter was blessed by his marriage to Dorothea von Oswald. He lived half of the year in Austria with Dorothea and her five daughters Maido, Theresa, Mariella, Sophie and Nina. The von Oswald family warmly embraced their new father and grandfather. Peter's great loves in life were his family, his Roman Catholic faith, and his country. Friends may visit at 220 Anderson Hill Road, Purchase, NY, from 4:30pm to 8pm on Sunday, August 4. A Mass of Christian Burial will be said at the Church of the Resurrection, 910 Boston Post Rd, Rye, NY, at 10am on Monday, August 5.

Dr. Jeffrey Golub-Evans, founder and Director of the New York Center for Cosmetic Dentistry, died Thursday at New York-Presbyterian Hospital in Manhattan. He was 72. Described as a ""Renaissance Man"" by his friends and colleagues, Jeff's passion for arts, culture, and travel instilled his professional work with extraordinary depth. His joie de vivre and legendary storytelling ability made him a much-loved figure in the lives of thousands. Although widely sought after for his smile artistry, Jeff always found time for his family, his friends, and his delighted activities: sculpting, hiking, kayaking, yoga, concerts, and theatre. In addition, he was a celebrated mixed-media artist and printmaker with paintings in galleries in New York City and abroad. Born in NYC on May 2, 1941, Jeffrey was the son of artist Eva Brown and attorney Irving Golub. A 1963 graduate of Hamilton College, he spoke French fluently and spent his final year of college in Paris studying French literature, his major. In 1966, Jeff received a degree from NYU College of Dentistry. Shortly thereafter, he enlisted in the Army and participated in a dental training rotation at Walter Reed Army Hospital, gaining tremendous experience in all areas of dentistry including crown and bridge, oral surgery, and endodontics. He subsequently spent a year in Vietnam as a MASH unit team member as well as running his own dental clinic. After returning, he began his private dental practice at 57 E. 72nd St., later moving to 128 E. 71st St., the Dental Duplex. In 1975, Jeff married Laine Jastram and had two children with her, Kristina and Chad. Dr. Jeffrey Golub-Evans parlayed his artistic talents into becoming one of the most revered cosmetic dentists in the country replete with a celebrity clientele. Vogue Magazine famously lauded Dr. Golub-Evans as the ""Guru of Cosmetic Dentistry."" He was invited to travel the world to teach his brand of high-art cosmetic dentistry utilizing the latest bonding and veneer technologies. In collaboration with his artistic sensibilities, he created a new genre of cosmetic dentistry called ""smile design."" In addition, Dr. Golub-Evans created dental costuming for Broadway and Hollywood productions. Dr. Jeff was Past President of the Academy of Cosmetic Dentistry (AACD) and was founding president of the New York Academy of Cosmetic Dentistry. AACD co-founder Dr. Morley said, ""He was admired and loved by many. Jeff's contribution to the development and 'soul' of the AACD is immeasurable and transcends his many accomplishments."" In 2001, Jeff Golub-Evans married Alecia Adams and took residence in Warren, CT, where they raised their daughter, Eva. This beautiful property and new community became his sanctuary. A dedicated, doting father who lived life to the fullest, he and his family could be found enjoying Knicks games, Tanglewood in the Berkshires, Jazz Fest in New Orleans, and dancing at Midsummer Night's Swing at Lincoln Center. Jeff will be sorely missed by us all. His funeral will be held on Sunday, August 4th at 3pm at the First Congregational Church, 6 Kirby Rd, Washington, CT.

2013-08-04T00:00:00Z,"FLANIGAN--Peter M. June 21, 1923 - July 29, 2013. Mr. Flanigan was a Navy carrier pilot in World War II. He graduated Summa Cum Laude from Princeton University in 1947 and joined Dillon, Read & Co. Inc. in the fall of that year. His tenure at Dillon Read was interrupted in 1949 to serve as an economic analyst for the Economic Reconstruction Administration in Britain for two years, returning thereafter to Dillon Read. In 1960 Mr. Flanigan served as Executive Director of Volunteers for the Nixon-Lodge Presidential campaign and in 1968 as Deputy Campaign Manager of the Nixon campaign. In 1969 Mr. Flanigan left Dillon Read upon his appointment as Assistant to the President of the United States under President Nixon, with White House responsibility for domestic commercial and economic matters. In 1972 he was also appointed Director of the Council of International Economic Policy, with responsibility for development and coordination of the Administration's international economic policy. Mr. Flanigan returned to Dillon Read as Managing Director at the beginning of 1975 and continued in that capacity until December 1992. In 1984, Peter Flanigan and his wife adopted the second class in the ""I Have a Dream"" Program, subsequently becoming a Board Member of that program. In 1985, Mr. Flanigan founded The Student Sponsor Partners, a private voucher program which combines tuition support with one-on-one mentoring. S/SP has helped over 5,000 inner-city high school students. Based on comparative graduation rates and college attendance rates, this program has been a dramatic success. In 1987, he started the Patrons Program to encourage individuals to take responsibility for inner-city Catholic grammar schools which were in danger of being closed for financial reasons. Mr. Flanigan was a Board member of St. Ann's School in Harlem, a small grammar school with 315 students. Upon his death, Mr. Flanigan was Board Member of American Federation for Children - Alliance for School Choice, a nation-wide organization to promote legislation to give parents the ability to send their children to the schools, public or private, of their choice. To research and implement new programs to improve education, Mr. Flanigan founded the Center for Education Innovation of The Manhattan Institute. He was a Board member of the Catholic University of America, and previous Chairman of the Board of Portsmouth Abbey School. Mr. Flanigan was also a member of the Board of Trustees of the John M. Olin Foundation, Inc. and a member of the Board of the Richard M. Nixon Library & Birthplace. In 1954, Mr. Flanigan married Brigid Snow, daughter of the legendary Carmel Snow who was founding editor of Harpers Bazaar, a position she held for 23 years, and grand niece of the equally legendary Bishop McQuade of Dublin, known to his flock as the Holy Terror. His wife, Brigid, passed away in 2006. Brigid and Peter's five children include Sister Louise Marie of the Sister Servants of the Eternal Word. His other children, Brigid, Tim, Megan and Bob are the parents of Peter's 16 grandchildren. Five years ago, Peter was blessed by his marriage to Dorothea von Oswald. He lived half of the year in Austria with Dorothea and her five daughters Maido, Theresa, Mariella, Sophie and Nina. The von Oswald family warmly embraced their new father and grandfather. Peter's great loves in life were his family, his Roman Catholic faith, and his country. Friends may visit at 220 Anderson Hill Road, Purchase, NY, from 4:30pm to 8pm on Sunday, August 4. A Mass of Christian Burial will be said at the Church of the Resurrection, 910 Boston Post Rd, Rye, NY, at 10am on Monday, August 5.

2013-08-04T00:00:00Z,"ALEXANDER--George Jonathon, Of Los Altos Hills, CA passed away on Monday evening, July 29, 2013. His family was by his side. Professor Alexander was the Dean Emeritus of Santa Clara University School of Law, having taken the helm of a 300 student, 12 full-time faculty institution in 1970 and helped the law school grow considerably in stature and triple in size during his 15-year tenure. Professor Alexander taught law for fifty two years, at the University of Chicago, Syracuse University, and Santa Clara Law, focusing his classroom teaching primarily on antitrust, Constitutional law, and law and psychiatry. He proposed the idea of a living will for protecting not only property rights, but also the control of health care issues, in a Stanford Law Review article. He then worked with the California Law Revision Commission in shaping their proposal for such a statute, the first to be passed in the United States. He also authored 13 books, including ""Honesty and Competition"" about false advertising regulation, ""The Aged and the Need for Surrogate Management"" (with Professor Travis H. D. Lewin), ""Writing a Living Will: Using a Durable Power of Attorney"" ""International Perspectives on Aging,"" ""Commercial Torts,"" and many book chapters as well as over fifty articles in refereed scholarly journals in the United States and abroad. Following his term as Dean, Professor Alexander was awarded the Elizabeth H. and John A. Sutro Professor of Law chair -- the first endowed chair in Santa Clara Law School's history. Additionally, he was named Director of the Institute of International and Comparative Law, a program he conceived to expand Santa Clara's legal studies to twelve countries and bring Visiting Scholars to the law school. Prior to coming to Santa Clara Law, Professor Alexander received a grant from the National Aeronautics and Space Administration to research legal issues related to space exploration. He was active in the New York Civil Liberties Union (Vice-President) and the American Association of University Professors (Syracuse University Chairman). Beginning in 1976, he served as a consultant to the Comptroller General of the United States for several decades. In 2000, he received the Thomas Szasz Award for Civil Liberties. He was also President of the National Society of American Law Teachers and in 2002, received their award for Founding Board Member and Visionary Activist for Equality, Access and Diversity throughout Law and Society. In 2004, Professor Alexander and his beloved wife generously reinvigorated the East San Jose Community Law Center. In recognition of their gesture, the ESJCLC was officially renamed the Katharine & George Alexander Community Law Center. Today, the Alexander Community Law Center educates law students by guiding them in providing pro bono representation to low-income individuals in consumer law, immigration law, workers' rights, and tax matters, serving about 1,000 clients on-site per year. The Center also reaches out to about 1,200 individuals through mobile workshops on consumer rights, workers' rights, and tenant-landlord rights, as well as advocating for low-income individuals with legislators and law reform committees. In 2008, the Alexanders established the Katharine & George Alexander Law Prize, designed to bring recognition to lawyers who have used their legal careers to help alleviate injustice and inequity. Over the past six years, the Prize has recognized and supported the courageous human rights work of Bryan Stevenson (founder and executive director of the Equal Justice Initiative in Alabama), Mario Joseph (Managing Attorney of the Bureau des Avocats Internationaux in Haiti), Shadi Sadr (an Iranian lawyer who launched the ""End Stoning Forever"" program and a center for women's rights in Iran), Paul Van Zyl (former Executive Secretary of South Africa's Truth and Reconciliation Commission, co-founder of the International Center for Transitional Justice, and CEO of PeaceVentures), Almudena Bernabeu (lead prosecutor against Salvadoran officials for the massacre of Jesuit priests in 1989), and Chen Guangcheng (blind Chinese dissident and self-taught lawyer who fights for the rights of rural poor in China). Professor Alexander was born in 1931 and grew up in Philadelphia. He received his undergraduate and law degrees from the University of Pennsylvania, and an LL.M. and J.S.D. from Yale Law School. Between college and law school, he served in the United States Navy. He was a member of the Board of Trustees of the San Jose Opera and the Arts Council of Silicon Valley, and a member of the Union Presbyterian Church of Los Altos. Professor Alexander is survived by his law school sweetheart, Katharine. They were married for fifty five years and shared a passion for their family, travel, and great food. He is also survived by his children, Suzi Alexander and her husband Gary Stolzoff, and Chip Alexander and his wife Laurie Alexander, as well as his grandchildren, Simone, Sam, and Kate. In lieu of flowers, the family would be grateful for contributions to the Katharine & George Alexander Community Law Center, 1030 The Alameda, San Jose, CA 95126, (408) 288-7030. A memorial service will be held on September 20, 2013 at 4pm at the Santa Clara Mission Church."

2013-08-05T00:00:00Z,"WITMEYER--John J.,III. Born in New Orleans, LA on December 18, 1946, died at his home in New York City after a year- long battle with cancer. He was the son of John J. Witmeyer Jr. (a decorated World War II veteran) and Thais Witmeyer. He is survived by his father, three brothers, Michael, Kurt and Eric, and two nephews, Michael Jr. and Robert, as well as a number of cousins and grand nieces and nephews. Mr. Witmeyer graduated from Tulane University in 1968 with a Bachelors of Science degree, and after graduating from Duke University Law School in 1971, he began practicing law in New York City. On June 1, 1976, Mr. Witmeyer founded the law firm of Ford Marrin Esposito Witmeyer & Gleser, LLP. He continued to practice law there until the day of his death. A remarkable lawyer with incredible energy, Mr. Witmeyer was very successful representing his clients during the course of his career. But perhaps, the professional accomplishment of which he was most proud of was his mentoring of many young lawyers, who themselves are now very successful and remember him fondly and call him friend. Mr. Witmeyer also served in the U.S. Army and at the time of his retirement had attained the rank of Colonel. He served in leadership positions in both professional and philanthropic organizations, which include the Gregorian University Foundation, Tulane College Dean's Colloquium Endowment Fund, the Equestrian Order of the Holy Sepulchre (Eastern Lieutenancy), and Cristo Rey New York High School- Board of Trustees.

The cause was stomach cancer. He was 76. Joslin was a cable television pioneer, a US media ambassador and a corporate entrepreneur, having carved successful careers in both the cable television systems and cable programming industries. For more than 35 years, he built a career with a vision for growth, an eye for quality and a commitment to corporate excellence. ""There is no doubt that Ray left a remarkable imprint through his work in cable television,"" said Steven R. Swartz, president & CEO, Hearst Corporation. ""He was a major player in the expansion of our company beyond a print-centric organization to a leader in cable networks, programming and syndication."" ""I had the great pleasure of recruiting Ray to Hearst and working with him for more than 20 years,"" said Frank A. Bennack, Jr., executive vice chairman, Hearst Corporation. ""He was key to Hearst's collaboration in the founding of the A&E and Lifetime networks and was one of the most respected leaders in the industry. He was unrivaled in his success. Plus, he was a true gentleman and a loyal friend."" After Joslin arrived at Hearst Corporation in 1980 as group head of its Cable Communications Group, the unit realized substantial growth. In 1981, Hearst joined ABC in developing several of the world's leading cable networks, including Lifetime, Lifetime Movie Network, Lifetime Real Women, and A&E Networks including HISTORY, BIO and The History Channel International, the latter with both ABC and NBC, Inc. Subsequently, Joslin oversaw Hearst's investment in ESPN and its portfolio of networks. He was founding co-chairman of the boards of directors of A&E Networks and Lifetime and served as a director on the board of ESPN. Most recently, Joslin served as CEO and chairman of the board of directors of CAD Sciences, a company creating technology designed to enable early detection of breast and prostate cancers. He is survived by his wife, Alicia, children, Jennifer, David and Jeffrey, and six grandchildren. A memorial service, to be announced at a later date, will be held the second week of September at Christ Church in Greenwich, Conn.

A quick study, he was one of the youngest students to graduate from the University of Pennsylvania School of Medicine at the age of 23. After an internship at the US Naval Hospital in St. Albans and in Newport, he became a distinguished physician in private practice in Long Island, New York.

Together they enjoyed international travel, art, ballroom dancing and thousands of games of Scrabble. A consummate family doctor, he bestowed loving attention on family, friends and patients whose lives were forever touched and who will treasure him always. Dr. Peter Sternlieb is survived by his loving wife, Sybil Sternlieb, a Senior VP at Merrill Lynch. He also leaves two daughters, Susan (Edward) Novick and Debra Morris (Holly Haygood); two sons, David (Barbara) Rosenberg and Michael Sternlieb; and four grandchildren, Myles and Olivia Novick, and Jennifer and Daniel Rosenberg (April Branson), who adored and were adored by him.

The cause of death was complications following pneumonia. Clay himself was an accomplished professional musician. Over the years he played guitar and sang at clubs from Greenwich Village to the Upper East Side, and his band played at functions and venues across the city and New Jersey. Clay was a graduate of Montclair High School in Montclair, NJ, Hobart College, Geneva, NY, and New York Law School. He served as a Second Lieutenant in the Army's 1st Air Calvary Division during the Vietnam War, from 1965 to 1966. He was awarded the Bronze Star and Air Medal. Clay always said that his guitar saved his life in Vietnam. While playing for a group of officers when he first arrived there, he caught the attention of an Army colonel who six months later recruited Clay as a liaison officer. Two weeks after Clay started his new job, 16 members of his platoon were killed in an enemy ambush including the lieutenant who replaced him. The tragedy marked Clay for life. Clay was the son of the late Clayton P. Knowles, a reporter for The New York Times, and the late Ruth Knowles, a civic activist. He is survived by his wife, Renata Renner Knowles, an industrial minerals consultant, his brother, Jeffrey Knowles, a lawyer in Washington, D.C., and his sister, Laurie Knowles, a lawyer in Santa Fe, NM.

2013-08-07T00:00:00Z,"DOUGLAS--Albert R.,served in the US Navy (LtJG) and Harvard class of '42, died on July 27, 2013. He served in World War II, which included piloting torpedo bombers from the escort carrier USS Savo Island. While flying reconnaissance at US landings at Leyte Gulf in the Philippines, he discovered a major Japanese fleet trying to sneak up on the landings. The major U.S. fleet had been lured well to the north to attack the major Japanese ships not realizing that the Japanese carrier planes had all been destroyed. That left the US escort carriers at Leyte to fight off the unexpected Japanese fleet by themselves. It is a dramatic and successful episode in U.S. Naval history. After having discovered the Japanese fleet, Douglas made it back to his carrier with all of his crew. Later at Leyte he was on a mission over Cebu Island when his plane was severely shot up, including its steering control. He was able to nurse the fifty foot plane back to the carrier safely with all three crew members. Douglas said he was most concerned the plane would catch fire. The plane was so badly riddled with bullet holes that it was promptly thrown overboard. For his service he was awarded the Distinguished Flying Cross and the Air Medal. Douglas was born on September 23, 1920 to Major Richard and Madeleine Dabo Douglas. He graduated from the Kent School in Connecticut in 1938 and from Harvard with a BA degree in 1942. He then enlisted in the Navy and underwent flight training as carrier pilot in Florida, and then on a training deck built for the Navy into Lake Michigan near Chicago. After the war he remained in the Navy for a time, flying virtually every kind of propeller plane in the Navy while ferrying VIP's. After leaving the Navy he worked as a stock broker and investment advisor with E.F. Hutton, among others. He continued this work until his death. Most recently he has been affiliated with A.J. Weed & Co. and R.M Stark & Co. He and his wife Celeste Murray Bartlett Douglas, known to family and friends as Murray, lived in Manhattan with a second home in Old Chatham, New York. They have been married since June 14, 1963. Mrs. Douglas was the chief designer and part owner of the famous fabric and wallpaper house of Brunschwig et Fils. Mr. and Mrs. Douglas were active in The Shaker Museum & Library, where Mrs. Douglas was a long time board member, and the Old Chatham Hunt Club. Mr. Douglas was a sixty-eight year member of the Harvard Club of New York. Albert Douglas is survived by his wife, Murray Douglas, and his step-son Francis Russel Lyons of Seattle, WA. He is also survived by his brother-in-law, Keith Lockhart of San Rafael, California and Mr. Douglas's nephews, Frank Lockhart of Olympia, WA and Douglas Lockhart of Napa, CA. His sister Jean Lockhart, MD died in 2011. A time for family and friends to share together memories of Albert's life will be held August 10, 2013, at 1pm at the Douglas's house, the School House, at the corner of County Route 13 and Ford Rd in Old Chatham, NY.

2013-08-07T00:00:00Z,"BERGER--Elizabeth, Elizabeth Berger was a great civic leader and champion of Lower Manhattan. As the President of the Alliance for Downtown New York and President of the Downtown-Lower Manhattan Association she helped shape the reimagining and rebuilding of Lower Manhattan after the 9/11 attacks and recently led an effort to assist Lower Manhattan businesses and residents recover from the effects of Superstorm Sandy. She died on August 5th at Bellevue Hospital Center. She turned 53 this past Saturday. Under Ms. Berger's leadership, the Alliance and the Downtown-Lower Manhattan Association successfully advocated for full funding and timely completion of the Fulton Street Transit Center, the reconstruction of Fiterman Hall and the enactment of post-9/11 commercial leasing incentives. Rather than focus on the district as the location of a terrible tragedy, Ms. Berger, renowned for her indefatigable energy and exacting intellect, was driven by a vision of Lower Manhattan as a place teeming with vitality and potential and a proving ground for municipal innovation. ""Liz Berger's passion, sophistication and drive shaped Lower Manhattan as surely as any skyscraper or bulldozer,"" said Robert R. Douglass the Chairman of the Alliance for Downtown New York and the Downtown-Lower Manhattan Association. ""Her strength as an advocate and strategist was only exceeded by her loyalty as a friend and her dedication as a mother and wife. She will be sorely missed."" Elizabeth Harrie Berger was born on August 3, 1960 in New York City. Ms. Berger had decades of experience in government, community affairs and strategic planning. Prior to her time with the Alliance she established and built government relations practices at the law firms Lord Day & Lord Barrett Smith and LeBoeuf, Lamb Greene & MacRae and the Law Offices of Claudia Wagner. Ms. Berger is also credited with creating the Department of Government and External Affairs at Lincoln Center. She served as an Assistant Mayoral Representative to the New York City Council during the Koch administration. A graduate of Yale College where she created her own major, The Study of the City, Ms. Berger was also involved with a variety of civic organizations in New York City beyond her professional obligations. She was at various times a board director of The Municipal Art Society, Film Forum, Second Stage Theatre, American Museum of Natural History Planetarium Authority and the New York Building Congress. She was also a mayoral appointee to the board of the Trust for Governors Island. In a statement Mayor Michael Bloomberg said of Ms. Berger ""Liz Berger loved our City with passion and gave her great intelligence and inventiveness to New York without reserve. She was more than an advocate for Lower Manhattan, she was a partner in building its future. As new transit hubs, skyscrapers, full access to our waterfront and a fresh vitality emerge downtown, Liz's influences are everywhere to be seen. We shared a vision of Lower Manhattan as a model 21st century business and residential district, and thanks to her tireless work, it's being realized before our eyes. The City mourns the loss of a great civic leader."" She is survived by her husband Frederick Kaufman, daughter Phoebe, son Julian, her mother Anita, and brother Gideon. The family will hold a private gathering for immediate family and close friends and a public memorial will be planned for the early fall. In lieu of flowers, donations may be made in Liz's memory to Film Forum or the Bowery Residents' Committee. For more information contact abreslau@downtownny.com"
