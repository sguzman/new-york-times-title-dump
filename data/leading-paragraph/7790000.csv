After graduation he served as a ""Coastie"" for the duration, participating in one of the fiercest battles fought in World War II - The Anzio Landing. Upon returning home, Art became President and COO of the Voluntary Home Mortgage Credit Program and was awarded their Distinguished Service Award. While living in the D.C. area he worked as a volunteer for the Republican Party. He also discovered in the woods of Virginia what would become a life-long passion birding.

From a young age and throughout his life, he loved sailing. Geoff was a World War II veteran, serving as an Army officer in the South Pacific. His desire to help those less fortunate led to a career as a social worker, with Masters and Doctoral degrees from Columbia University School of Social Work, and made him a fierce civil rights and anti-poverty crusader. He served as executive director of Hamilton Madison House in lower Manhattan where he spent 16 years leading the settlement house and contributed more than 50 years of service, including as a Board member. He also taught at Hunter College School of Social Work and at the State University of New York, Downstate Medical Center, and served for 10 years as executive director of Abbott House, a child welfare, foster care and adoption organization. In retirement he volunteered with the International Executive Service Corps, with the Larchmont/Mamaroneck Local Summit, and strongly supported the Mamaroneck Hispanic Resource Center.

His bear hugs, even at age 95, were strong - he put all his love into every embrace. In recent years, he loved to walk in Manor Park and weekly visited the Larchmont Senior Center, where he became a prolific painter. His Coolidge Street home has become a veritable art gallery. His family would like to thank his live-in aides Cutie Fraser and Auda Moncion, Karen Schwartz and her staff, and Dr. Steven Meixler and the nurses and staff at White Plains Hospital.

2014-06-22T00:00:00Z,"MYERS--Charles Twiggs, legendary history teacher and coach at Berkshire School in Sheffield, Mass., died June 14 at the age of 83. Insatiably curious, Twiggs had interests ranging from clocks to railroad trains, from trees and flowers to anything written by May Sarton and Walter Pritchard Eaton, from the Philadelphia Phillies to the back roads of the Adirondacks, where he spent his summers at the Crater Club in Essex, N.Y. Twiggs Myers was born on August 2, 1930, in Bryn Mawr, PA, the youngest of three children of Charles Myers, a Philadelphia attorney, and the former Gertrude James Hearne. He was the namesake of his great-great grandfather, David Emmanuel Twiggs, a hero of the Mexican War who later became the oldest Confederate general in the Civil War. As a child, Twiggs raised homing pigeons kept in a loft attached to the family garage and was a member of the International Federation of American Homing Pigeon Fanciers. (Years later, Twiggs would raise chickens at his home in Sheffield, which he called Laywell Farm.) Twiggs attended the private Haverford School. In 1952, he graduated from Princeton University with a degree in history. Among his classmates were tailback Dick Kazmaier, the last Ivy Leaguer to win the Heisman Trophy, and former Treasury Secretary and Secretary of State James A. Baker. After a year at Harvard Law School, Twiggs was hired by Berkshire School, then an all-boys school with 150 students. Twiggs Myers was among the last of a breed: the bachelor schoolmaster whose institution is his love and whose students are his children. With a passion for the Civil War and a reverence for Lee and Lincoln, he taught history from 1953 to 1995, when he was named the school's Senior Master Emeritus. He coached track and field his entire career and, in 1966, founded the school's cross country running program, whose teams racked up 200 victories while he was coach. Twiggs was an inveterate storyteller with a quick, often irreverent, wit. Among the staples in his repertoire was Adlai Stevenson's quip, ""I find Norman Vincent Peale appalling and St. Paul appealing."" Every August, as he reluctantly left his camp on Lake Champlain for the classroom, Twiggs would pronounce, ""The curtain of seriousness is descending."" In addition to countless former students, survivors include sister Eliza Miller; nieces Diane Hulburt, Katje McIntyre, Wendy Miller, and Susan Curtin; nephews Hunter Ten Broeck and Mark Miller; 12 grand-nephews and nieces; and five great-grandnephews and nieces. A memorial service for Twiggs Myers will be held on July 12 at 11 am at Christ Church in Sheffield. Gifts in his memory may be made to Berkshire School or to the Sheffield Land Trust in care of Birches Roy Funeral Home, 33 South Street, Great Barrington, MA 01230."

2014-06-22T00:00:00Z,"OWEN--Jane Dale. Jane Dale Owen was born September 30, 1942 and passed away on June 11, 2014 at her home in Dallas, surrounded by her beloved caregivers and her son, Erik. She was the first child born to Jane Blaffer Owen and Kenneth Dale Owen of Houston, Texas and New Harmony, Indiana. She attended the Kinkaid School until she contracted polio in 1951. She subsequently moved to New York to be near the New York Hospital for special surgery to mitigate the ravages of the disease. She attended the Nightingale-Bamford School and Bennington College. Jane courageously faced her challenges with beauty, a sense of humor, a gentle spirit and grace. In 1963, she was married to the Norwegian ship broker, Per Arneberg, and was blessed with two children, Erik and Ingrid. They lived in New York City. Jane loved caring for her family and pets. They enjoyed weekends and summers in Oyster Bay Long Island, sailing and taking long swims. Jane was an accomplished chef. In New York, she was involved in fund-raising for the Public Broadcasting System (PBS). Jane taught remedial reading to school children. She loved her dogs and shared this love with others in need. Through the Pet Partners, she took her dogs to hospitals and nursing homes where they brought joy to patients and the elderly. Jane and Per were amicably divorced in 1976. In 1980, she married Peter Leslie Jarvis. They divorced in 1987. She had a love of adventure, spoke three languages and traveled extensively to Great Britain, France, Italy Spain, Greece, Japan, Holland and Norway. No trek or terrain was impossible for Jane. Her strength and will enabled her to traverse shores, mountains and cobble-stone streets. There was never a time when she gave up or out - she willed herself to do what everyone else could do with ease. Jane moved back to Houston in 1993 to be closer to her parents. She soon became involved in alerting the public to the hazards of air pollution and other environmental issues. In 2000, she founded Citizens League for Environmental Action Now (CLEAN). For more than a decade, she boldly spoke out about the responsibility of energy companies, government leaders, state agencies and citizens to reduce pollution and work toward clean energy solutions in opinions published in the Houston Chronicle and Climate Progress. She also provided funding to local projects including a citizen air sampling project known as the ""Bucket Brigade"" and Texas Environmental Advocacy Services, TEJAS. She was the only non-scientist member of the Federation of American Scientist. Jane endowed The University of Texas School of Public Health, with a professorship of Environmental Health Protection, established in 2008. Her philanthropy extended to the protection of prairies and other natural areas. In addition to Jane's environmental work, she has made a significant contribution to the quality of life in Houston as a patron of the arts and historic preservation. She has served on the advisory board and executive committee of the Blaffer Gallery at the University of Houston. She has been honored by the gallery for her dedicated support, leadership, and for continuing her mother and grandmother's legacy and vision for the museum and arts in Texas. She also served on the executive committee of the Moores School of Music. She funded the popular Children's Film program and served on the film committee at Museum of Fine Arts. Jane had a home in Rhode Island where she spent summers with children, her mother and many friends. She loved going out on the boat with Captain Dave and swimming almost every day. She was deeply committed to preservation of historic homes in Middletown, Rhode Island. In 2008, after one hurricane too many, she moved from Houston to Dallas. She also has a home in Palm Beach, Florida. In New Harmony, Indiana, she made significant donations to preserve the family legacy through the preservation of historic homes. She also contributed to the New Harmony Artist Guild which sponsors the New Harmony Music Festival and School. Jane's homes were a safe haven for her friends, sisters, children and many loving cousins. She was always there to provide encouragement, wisdom and compassion. Her boundless generosity enhanced the lives of her family, friends, and bolstered charitable causes. Jane will be greatly missed by her son, Erik, his wife, Lora, their children Per Erik and Ellis Jane; her daughter, Ingrid and grandaughter Sarah; her sister, Anne Owen Pontez, and her husband Harold J. Pontez; her niece and godchild, Abigail Owen-Pontez; nephew, James Owen Coleman; and her brother-in-law, James J. Coleman, Jr. She was predeceased by her parents, Jane Blaffer Owen and Kenneth Dale Owen, and sister, Carol Owen Coleman. The family would like to say a special thank you to those who loved and cared for her during good times and bad: Brad, Comfort, Maria, Claudia, Angela, Zandra, Adriana, the nurses at Baylor University Medical Center and Aspen hospice care. A memorial service will follow in New Harmony, Indiana. Announcements will be sent out when the date is confirmed. In addition, there will be a memorial service in Houston on September 30th (Janie's birthday) at 5:00 pm at her family's home in Houston.

2014-06-22T00:00:00Z,"KOENIG--Julian. April 22, 1921 - June 12, 2014. The One Club mourns the loss of Julian Koenig, esteemed member of the Creative Hall of Fame. Julian was inducted in 1966 to the Copywriters Hall of Fame, as it was known then. Born in New York, April 22, 1921, he graduated from Dartmouth and then studied at Columbia Law School. Julian was an eccentric intellectual who created a new style of copywriting that went on to define advertising's creative revolution. It was smart, simple and accessible to the public--writing that neither exaggerated nor overpromised. Contemporary writers compared him to Holden Caulfield, for being aloof and reserved in a business that favored popular culture. Julian is best known for his iconic work for Volkswagen while at Doyle Dane Bernbach. Working with art director Helmut Krone, he created the groundbreaking ads ""Think Small"" and ""Lemon,"" which came to define the new style of advertising. Julian and Fred Papert launched a new agency with George Lois called Papert Koenig Lois where they created award-winning work for Wolfschmidt Vodka, Xerox, Peugeot and Allarest, proving as he once said that good taste is good for business. Many well-known advertising talents started their careers at PKL, including Carl Ally and Sam Scali, who went on to start their own agencies. Fred Papert and Julian remained good friends throughout their lives and made annual trips to Saratoga for the races. During his lifetime, Julian amassed a large coterie of colorful characters, including sportswriter Jimmy Breslin, Senator Jacob Javits, and his own alter ego, Groucho Marx. Among his many contributions was the naming of ""Earth Day"" in 1969, for a committee organized to bring environmental awareness to the public. The One Club offers heartfelt sympathy to Julian's children and grandchildren. (Photo credit, Carl Fischer)"

2014-06-24T00:00:00Z,"LOW--Josiah O. III, 75, died peacefully on June 20, 2014, surrounded by his family and with his German shepherd by his side. Joe was born to Katherine and Josiah O. Low Jr. on June 5, 1939 in Detroit, Michigan. He worked his way through Williams College graduating in 1961. Joe built a career as an investment banker, first at Merrill Lynch and then at Donaldson, Lufkin, & Jenrette where he led the corporate finance group for 15 years. On Wall Street he was known for his unbending integrity and unending interest in others. Colleagues he worked with 40 years ago cite his mentorship as critical to their own success. Many also recall that he kept a saddle in the trunk of his car. After leaving DLJ, he continued to serve on the board of a number of companies, including Centex Development, CoStar Group, and Rosetta Resources. In 2002, he joined Catterton Partners as a Senior Advisor. He advised CEO's of Fortune 500 Companies and later helped friends and local business people expand their businesses or find a path out of trouble. If you came in contact with Joe, you remembered him with a smile. He blew his nose with a trumpet that turned heads, and he sang along to opera and Willie Nelson, whether or not he knew the words. He entertained children with his cowboy yip and songs about cowpies. He disliked mini-golf, ""a bastardization of the game"", cilantro and the snapping of gum. Joe grew up working as a ranch hand at French Creek, his family's guest ranch in Wyoming's Platte River Valley. His love for the West was infectious. He introduced hundreds of friends and colleagues to Wyoming with visits to the A Bar A, a ranch down the valley from French Creek. Joe was unexpectedly friendly and sincerely interested in everyone he met. Ordering at a restaurant was always time consuming because Joe needed to learn the name and background of the waiter -- some connection could always be found. By the time dessert came, he was often sitting at another table with people he had just met. To his five grandchildren, he was Poppa Joe. The grandfather who hid a radio under your pillow so you could listen to the Giants game at night. The patient teacher who poured a little extra root beer float in your glass to demonstrate the concept of principal and interest. He did not allow whining or weak handshakes. He was irreverent, generous, joyful and loving. He let you ride the ATV despite what your parents said. He paid his six year-old granddaughter to paint his toenails. To his three sons, he was a father who arose every morning at 5:30 to provide his children with opportunities and experiences that he never had. He encouraged his sons to pursue their passions, put together a plan, and then to ""get it done."" He was an investor in their dreams, their advisor, and friend. Joe loved the outdoors and gave generously to the Williamstown Rural Lands Foundation. He planted hundreds of trees and was often seen mowing the meadows surrounding his home in Williamstown. He had an extensive collection of John Deere tractors. When he ran out of space for more tractors, he gave them away to friends, because ""everyone needs a tractor."" He shared his passion for western music by setting up concerts in Williamstown. At these events, he would often join his hero Don Edwards on stage for a duet, despite the cringes of his wife and children. He served as a Williams class agent for many years and was selected to lead his class's procession at their 50th reunion. Joe was the lead donor in the purchase and renovation of the Sand Springs Recreation Center, a historic aquatic center that now serves as community gathering place and swim academy in Williamstown. He set up a foundation to fund free swim lessons so that no child would ever be afraid of the water. He loved opera, American antiques, and Western art. His favorite fashion statement was a young woman with a ponytail poking out of the back of a baseball cap. Joe was unbeatable in horseshoes, a devious opponent in gin rummy, and he could still out drive his sons well into his 70's. He gave his wife old pick-up trucks for her birthday. Children he barely knew named stuffed animals after him. He was loved by so many. There is now a giant hole in our hearts that we will all try to fill with the openness and generosity that was Joe Low. Joe is survived by Penny (Ireland) his loving wife of 50 years, three sons Tad (Alisa), Timothy (Loriann), and Jeffrey (Stacey), five grandchildren: Ryan, Julia, Aidan, Nicholas, and Eliza, his sister Katherine, and two brothers David and Charles, and numerous nieces and nephews. There will be a private family memorial service. Gifts in Joe's honor may be made to the Williamstown Rural Lands Foundation Williamstown, MA 01267 or simply through unexpected kindness or interest in another person's life."

2014-06-25T00:00:00Z,"PEI--Eileen Loo, died peacefully at home in New York City on June 20. Born on September 21, 1920, in Tientsin, China, she was the daughter of Ping Yok and Alice Chang Loo. Her father was an early Chinese graduate of MIT, earning his engineering degree in 1916. Her maternal grandfather was Yin Tang Chang, Ambassador from China to Washington beginning in 1909. Her granduncle was T'ang Shao-Yi, first Prime Minister of the Republic of China (1911-1912). Eileen Loo came to the United States in 1938 to attend Wellesley College, where she studied Art, was a Senior Wellesley College Scholar, and received her degree in 1942. Immediately after graduation, she married Ieoh Ming Pei, a young architect recently graduated from MIT's School of Architecture. He followed her to Harvard and its Graduate School of Design, where she studied Landscape Architecture and where he received his Master's Degree in Architecture in 1946. During the war years, her husband worked with the National Defense Research Committee in Princeton, NJ. Their first son, T'ing Chung, was born there in 1944. After the war, they returned to Harvard where, upon earning his degree, Mr. Pei joined the faculty. Their second son, Chien Chung (Didi), was born in 1946. Eileen and I.M. Pei moved to New York in 1948 when Mr. Pei was recruited to work for the real estate developer William Zeckendorf. A third son, Li Chung (Sandi), was born in 1949 and Eileen Pei embarked on her career of raising three boys and supporting her husband. In 1960, a daughter, Liane, was born, to the elation of the parents. Her husband's career flourished. In 1952, she sailed across the Atlantic Ocean with him to Europe on traveling fellowships he had earned while at Harvard. This was the first of many trips they would take together and with the family where everyone would benefit from her impeccable organization and preparation. Always forward thinking, she was an ardent supporter of Planned Parenthood, Channel 13 and WNYC, and an active and longtime member of the Cosmopolitan Club in New York. Together with her husband, Eileen Loo Pei befriended many of the most influential artists and dealers of the time, particularly those that were concentrating in New York in the 1950's and 1960's. They were frequent participants in the broad cultural life of both New York and beyond, and intimate gatherings at the Pei home were welcomed events, memorable for their animated conversation, fine wine and her delicious cuisine. Possessed of a keen eye, unfailing taste and an abiding passion for the arts and culture, she was a constant and indispensable support to her husband and family, providing wise counsel, warmth, good humor, and practical, loving advice on all matters. She was known by all for her effortless style, elegance and grace. Eileen Loo Pei is predeceased by her eldest son, two brothers, Harry and Man Kit, and one sister, Louise.

2014-06-27T00:00:00Z,"PEI--Eileen Loo, died peacefully at home in New York City on June 20. Born on September 21, 1920, in Tientsin, China, she was the daughter of Ping Yok and Alice Chang Loo. Her father was an early Chinese graduate of MIT, earning his engineering degree in 1916. Her maternal grandfather was Yin Tang Chang, Ambassador from China to Washington beginning in 1909. Her granduncle was T'ang Shao-Yi, first Prime Minister of the Republic of China (1911-1912). Eileen Loo came to the United States in 1938 to attend Wellesley College, where she studied Art, was a Senior Wellesley College Scholar, and received her degree in 1942. Immediately after graduation, she married Ieoh Ming Pei, a young architect recently graduated from MIT's School of Architecture. He followed her to Harvard and its Graduate School of Design, where she studied Landscape Architecture and where he received his Master's Degree in Architecture in 1946. During the war years, her husband worked with the National Defense Research Committee in Princeton, NJ. Their first son, T'ing Chung, was born there in 1944. After the war, they returned to Harvard where, upon earning his degree, Mr. Pei joined the faculty. Their second son, Chien Chung (Didi), was born in 1946. Eileen and I.M. Pei moved to New York in 1948 when Mr. Pei was recruited to work for the real estate developer William Zeckendorf. A third son, Li Chung (Sandi), was born in 1949 and Eileen Pei embarked on her career of raising three boys and supporting her husband. In 1960, a daughter, Liane, was born, to the elation of the parents. Her husband's career flourished. In 1952, she sailed across the Atlantic Ocean with him to Europe on traveling fellowships he had earned while at Harvard. This was the first of many trips they would take together and with the family where everyone would benefit from her impeccable organization and preparation. Always forward thinking, she was an ardent supporter of Planned Parenthood, Channel 13 and WNYC, and an active and longtime member of the Cosmopolitan Club in New York. Together with her husband, Eileen Loo Pei befriended many of the most influential artists and dealers of the time, particularly those that were concentrating in New York in the 1950's and 1960's. They were frequent participants in the broad cultural life of both New York and beyond, and intimate gatherings at the Pei home were welcomed events, memorable for their animated conversation, fine wine and her delicious cuisine. Possessed of a keen eye, unfailing taste and an abiding passion for the arts and culture, she was a constant and indispensable support to her husband and family, providing wise counsel, warmth, good humor, and practical, loving advice on all matters. She was known by all for her effortless style, elegance and grace. Eileen Loo Pei is predeceased by her eldest son, two brothers, Harry and Man Kit, and one sister, Louise. She is survived by her husband of 72 years, two sons, her daughter, two daughters-in-law, seven grandchildren and three great-grandchildren. In lieu of flowers, the family requests with great appreciation that donations be made to Planned Parenthood, Channel 13 or WNYC."

He was a cherished husband, father, son, brother, uncle, and grandfather who played a pivotal role in our extended family. We have been profoundly touched by the outpouring of love, admiration and support from people all over the world whose lives Richard also touched. Richard was passionate about everything he did as a physician, as an activist and as a philanthropist. He was at home in art, in music and in nature. He was intensely curious about how things work, from the physical world to the human psyche. His formal education came from the North Country School, the Choate School, Harvard College and the Harvard Medical School. But his informal learning never stopped, nor did his drive to make the world a better place. He founded, led or served many non-profit organizations (including those listed below) and gave generously to them in time and treasure. In addition, he served as president of the Rockefeller Family Fund and chairman of the Rockefeller Brothers Fund. Richard's immediate family consists of his wife Nancy King Rockefeller; his son Clayton and daughter Rebecca; his grandchildren Ozzy and Elsa and Wilder; Nancy's sons Max and Griffin; his father David Rockefeller; Richards' siblings and spouses, David and Susan, Abby and Lee, Neva and Bruce, Peggy and Barry, Eileen and Paul; and numerous nieces and nephews and cousins whom he adored. We all miss him so much. The Family plans a private service of remembrance this summer, and there will be a memorial service in the fall, time and place to be announced.

2014-06-27T00:00:00Z,"TUCKER--Teddy. Teddy Tucker, MBE, Undersea Pioneer: May 8, 1925 June 9, 2014. The many members of his exploring and environmentalist families salute this quietly innovative, groundbreaking adventurer. In his distinctive way, Teddy went steadily about the business of opening the oceans and their many mysteries to scientific and popular knowledge. And he always had fun, probing, teaching, seeking. His many achievements earned him the Order of the British Empire from Queen Elizabeth II; he discovered over a hundred Bermuda shipwrecks; in 1955 he recovered the gold and emerald Tucker Cross from the San Pedro; he pioneered marine archeological work with the Smithsonian's Mendel Peterson and helped him perfect the grid system for surveying and conserving shipwrecks; he worked with Professor Genie Clark from the University of Maryland on six-gill sharks; and had a multi-year collaboration with Emory Kristof of National Geographic on the Beebe science project. He always said he learned a lot about the ocean the hard way, direct from the depths. Teddy used his quick-study mind on tens of thousands of hours beneath the ocean and an equal amount of time with books on nautical history and marine biology. His intimate understanding of the world's largest, oldest, and least known ecosystem and his willingness to share what he learned attracted some of the best and brightest undersea and space pioneers. Among the scientists, photographers, and astronauts who spent time with him in Bermuda: Dr. Greg Stone, Dr. Steve Katona, Dr. Clyde Roper, Steve Blasco, David Doubilet, Pete Conrad, Deke Slayton, and Kathy Sullivan. A huge part of the joy for those who shared a boat ride (or a plunge) with Teddy was partaking of the benefits of his incomparable story-telling ability. A master raconteur, he would finish a story with bell-like laughter that lit up the face of everyone within earshot. He had served in the Royal Navy in the Second World War and returned to Bermuda to start a career in marine salvage. His interest in both the practical and scientific aspects of salvage shifted to a passion for marine science. He believed that ""the best education is self-taught: all you need is a head and heart hungry for information."" And, most crucially, a sense of humour. His longtime friend, the author Peter Benchley, used him as an inspiration for Quint in ""Jaws"" and made him the central character in ""The Deep."" He described Teddy as ""a walking encyclopedia and one of the great autodidacts in the history of science--a self taught expert on ships, coins, nautical history, underwater archeology, painting, glassware and armament."" Teddy had more time beneath the sea than any explorer including Jacques Cousteau, often diving in no more than a pair of shorts and some sneakers. He was a creature of the ocean. For more than eight decades, Mother Ocean was Teddy's muse and mentor. He devoted his life to teasing out her secrets and passing them along to his friends. He believed that ""we do two things in life: learn and contribute."" Teddy loved Mother Ocean and she loved him back. Now they are one. Thank you shipmate, from all of us fortunate enough to share the ocean planet with you, for those good times above and below the sea. And bless you Edna and Wendy for sharing the most important man in your life."

After attending Fountain Valley prep school in Colorado, Charles graduated from Wesleyan University in 1955 with Distinction in Creative Writing. He served in the US Army in Alaska during the Korean conflict. He was an advertising executive at Foote, Cone, and Belding until 1963, when he became chief executive officer of The Open Space Institute and published its Open Space Action Magazine with the objective of preserving areas of natural beauty in the New York metropolitan region. His entire life's work then became to devote his considerable talent and passion to the appreciation and protection of American landscapes, whether they are agricultural or urban natural areas; public parks or privately held areas of unique natural beauty. In 1972 he joined the Conservation Foundation in Washington DC, then became head of the Natural Resources Division of The Congressional Research Service, which he left in 1978 to establish the American Land Resource Association and edit its publication, American Land Forum. Charles moved to Placitas, NM in 1994, continuing to involve himself in land use issues and to write about them. He founded Voices from the American Land, a quarterly publication of poetry celebrating outstanding landscapes of North America. He is the author of many acclaimed books, among them Discover America (Smithsonian); Greenways for America (Johns Hopkins); Hope for the Land (Rutgers); An Appalachian Tragedy (Sierra Club); and The Dying of the Trees (Viking), a finalist for the LA Times's nonfiction award in 1997. Memorial services will be held at Las Placitas Presbyterian Church on Saturday, July 12th at 11:00am. In lieu of flowers, donations may be made in Charles's memory to the LPPC Columbarium Fund or to Voices from the American Land."

Sullivan were one week away from their 60th wedding anniversary. In addition to her husband, she is survived by her daughter Kathleen and sons Robert and James Sullivan, her niece Margaret Schmitt, and her grandchildren Kira, Daniel and Sean Sullivan. Beautifully elegant, athletically gifted, and possessed of an avid intellectual curiosity, she had a life force that her family experienced as nothing short of amazing, and that made all of her children and grandchildren who they are. Born in Queens, New York on January 21, 1931, she attended Our Lady of Wisdom High School and obtained a B.A. in 1953 from Queens College, where she marched in 2013 with her 60th reunion class. In the 1950s, she taught elementary school in New York City public schools and to Ojibway schoolchildren in Sault Ste Marie, Michigan, where her husband Bob was stationed in the Air Force and her daughter Kathleen was born. Upon her return to New York, she devoted herself to her family and extended family, took up tennis in her forties and golf in her fifties (winning numerous prizes in golf tournaments at the Huntington Country Club), and swam regularly into her eighties. No one could have a better wife, mother and grandmother, and all of her family are deeply grateful for the gift of her magnificent life. Donations in her honor may be made to the Cold Spring Harbor Library, 95 Harbor Road, Cold Spring Harbor, NY 11724."

His commitment to education was salient throughout his life, in many philanthropic activities and his own unceasing learning.

Music was central to his life, from undergraduate singing with the Harvard Gilbert and Sullivan Players, to his acclaim as a jazz pianist and certified jazz educator, his patronage of the musical arts and active engagement in many musical ensembles such as the Canterbury Choral Society and Uptown Sound. An avid sports fan and player, passionate follower of the Boston Red Sox, he also established a library endowment at Harvard to build a collection in Judaica, supported a pro-bono summer camp for the elderly, and led the establishment of the Wise-Marcus Scholarship Fund in the Syracuse University Honors Program.

For 61 years, Bob was an adoring husband to the late Phyllis Mehler Seavey, who passed away last year. He is survived by his devoted children Avery Seavey and Dr. Emily Senay and Nealle and Eric Seltzer, and loving grandchildren Veronica Jean, Bryn, Harry, Lucy and Ruby, sisters-in-law Maxine Chevlowe and Harriet Seavey, devoted nieces and nephews, cousin Edward Levine as well as other cousins, numerous friends and admirers. Born on October 14, 1927, Bob was the oldest child of Ben and Essie Seavey, and brother to the late Gilbert Seavey. A life-long New Yorker, Bob graduated from City College in 1949 and Brooklyn Law School in 1952, where he was editor-in-chief of the Brooklyn Law Review and first in his graduating class. After meeting in law school, Bob and Phyllis began a wonderful life-long journey together. They were married in New York in December 1952 and soon moved to Okinawa, Japan, where Bob served as a Captain in the Judge Advocate General's Office in the US Air Force during the Korean War. Following the birth of their son in 1956, they returned to New York, where Bob had an illustrious career as a lawyer, real estate developer and public servant for over fifty years. As a developer, Bob built thousands of low-income, affordable and conventional rental, cooperative and condominium units throughout New York City, including the first rehabilitation development under the Mitchell-Lama law; the first affordable housing cooperative in Harlem; the landmark Harlem apartment complex, Esplanade Gardens; and what was at the time the tallest residential building in Queens. He was most proud to share his knowledge of real estate law and business, volunteering for many years as an Adjunct Professor at Brooklyn Law School. Bob also had a distinguished career in the public sector, serving as Chairman of Battery Park City during its early construction phase, Chairman of the Real Estate Advisory Committee for New York State's Common Retirement Fund, Chairman of the Citizens Housing and Planning Council of New York, one of the City's most prestigious organizations dedicated to housing issues, and as a member of the Municipal Assistance Corporation of New York, the agency created out of the City's 1970s debt crisis. He was an early leader in the rejuvenation of Harlem and credited the start of his career to being Counsel to J. Raymond Jones, Tammany Hall's first African American leader. From that time forward Bob continued to be a respected advisor to numerous local policy makers, helping shape New York through times of social and economic change. Bob's professional accomplishments were matched only by his strong devotion to his family and friends. He inspired all who knew him with his loyalty. He was admired for his pure intelligence and his abiding interest in the world around him, including all of the people with whom he crossed paths. He was blessed with a great sense of humor and found true joy in good conversation, listening intently to the experiences of others and delighting in sharing the tales of his life. A big man with boundless energy, it was nothing for Bob to work until midnight and then pick up his family to travel hours for weekend getaways. Generous of heart and spirit, Bob always welcomed family and friends and was ready to help any of them in times of need. Above all, he was a kind person and a mentor to many, openly sharing his insight and experience. He will be deeply missed."

He made countless speaking tours as Israel's goodwill ambassador and his success was rewarded in 1974 with a position as a legal adviser with Israel's mission to the United Nations under the leadership of Ambassador Chiam Herzog. His love of learning led him to earn three Master of Law degrees at New York University in International Legal Studies in Corporate and Commercial Law and in Jewish Talmudic Law. For 14 years, Mr. Aron served as the chair of Trial Advocacy at the Law School of Tel Aviv University. He also was a guest teacher at New York University's School of Law.

2014-06-29T00:00:00Z,"SHAH--Sumitra. Sumitra Shah, a New Canaan, CT.,resident, passed away on June 14, 2014 at Norwalk Hospital. She was surrounded by family at the time of her passing. A professor of economics at St. John's University in Jamaica, New York for the better part of three decades, Ms. Shah's passion for Keynesian and feminist economics was matched only by her sense of social justice and her fondness for all animals, which she expressed in poems. Of course, her love for her family, and particularly her grandchildren, topped everything else. Ms. Shah was born in Satara, India in 1937, and came to the United States as president's fellow to pursue a Ph.D. in economics at Columbia University, where she received her second master's degree in 1964. She later completed doctoral courses at the New School for Social Research. In 1961, Ms. Shah also met her future husband, Shashi K. Shah; they celebrated their fiftieth anniversary in 2013. Ms. Shah loved teaching young minds about the workings of the modern economy and the history of economic thought. More often than not, her students would often tell her how accessible she made a subject they initially approached with dread. Ms. Shah also had a passion for the natural world, which she expressed in poems she wrote about robins nesting in the bushes outside her New Canaan home or the remarkable devotion of dogs. Her love of music ranged from Bach to bluegrass. But her greatest love was for her grandchildren who kept her smiles always in bloom. Ms. Shah was an ethically principled person who worked well with others and greatly appreciated their presence in her life. Her family members feel fortunate to have had her among them happy, peppy and bursting with love, kindness and compassion. They shall miss her and remember her forever. Among the bereaved whom Ms. Shah leaves behind are her husband, Shashi K. Shah of New Canaan, son and daughter-in-law, Sanjit and Mary Shah of South Salem, New York, two grandchildren, Mina and Vikram Shah, her brother Sharad and his wife Sandhya Janorkar of Mumbai, India, and her nieces Anju Suvernpatki of Guelph, Ontario, Sonal Sathe of North Bergen, New Jersey, Lata Manerikar, Nandini Alawani of Mumbai, India, and their respective families. Ms. Shah also leaves behind dozens of young people who came from abroad to study in the United States to whom she served as a surrogate mother, and with whom she maintained warm relations long after they became adults.

2014-06-29T00:00:00Z,"PEI--Eileen Loo, died peacefully at home in New York City on June 20. Born on September 21, 1920, in Tientsin, China, she was the daughter of Ping Yok and Alice Chang Loo. Her father was an early Chinese graduate of MIT, earning his engineering degree in 1916. Her maternal grandfather was Yin Tang Chang, Ambassador from China to Washington beginning in 1909. Her granduncle was T'ang Shao-Yi, first Prime Minister of the Republic of China (1911-1912). Eileen Loo came to the United States in 1938 to attend Wellesley College, where she studied Art, was a Senior Wellesley College Scholar, and received her degree in 1942. Immediately after graduation, she married Ieoh Ming Pei, a young architect recently graduated from MIT's School of Architecture. He followed her to Harvard and its Graduate School of Design, where she studied Landscape Architecture and where he received his Master's Degree in Architecture in 1946. During the war years, her husband worked with the National Defense Research Committee in Princeton, NJ. Their first son, T'ing Chung, was born there in 1944. After the war, they returned to Harvard where, upon earning his degree, Mr. Pei joined the faculty. Their second son, Chien Chung (Didi), was born in 1946. Eileen and I.M. Pei moved to New York in 1948 when Mr. Pei was recruited to work for the real estate developer William Zeckendorf. A third son, Li Chung (Sandi), was born in 1949 and Eileen Pei embarked on her career of raising three boys and supporting her husband. In 1960, a daughter, Liane, was born, to the elation of the parents. Her husband's career flourished. In 1952, she sailed across the Atlantic Ocean with him to Europe on traveling fellowships he had earned while at Harvard. This was the first of many trips they would take together and with the family where everyone would benefit from her impeccable organization and preparation. Always forward thinking, she was an ardent supporter of Planned Parenthood, Channel 13 and WNYC, and an active and longtime member of the Cosmopolitan Club in New York. Together with her husband, Eileen Loo Pei befriended many of the most influential artists and dealers of the time, particularly those that were concentrating in New York in the 1950's and 1960's. They were frequent participants in the broad cultural life of both New York and beyond, and intimate gatherings at the Pei home were welcomed events, memorable for their animated conversation, fine wine and her delicious cuisine. Possessed of a keen eye, unfailing taste and an abiding passion for the arts and culture, she was a constant and indispensable support to her husband and family, providing wise counsel, warmth, good humor, and practical, loving advice on all matters. She was known by all for her effortless style, elegance and grace. Eileen Loo Pei is predeceased by her eldest son, two brothers, Harry and Man Kit, and one sister, Louise. She is survived by her husband of 72 years, two sons, her daughter, two daughters-in-law, seven grandchildren and three great-grandchildren.

2014-06-29T00:00:00Z,"LOW--Josiah O. III, 75, died peacefully on June 20, 2014, surrounded by his family and with his German shepherd by his side. Joe was born to Katherine and Josiah O. Low Jr. on June 5, 1939 in Detroit, Michigan. He worked his way through Williams College graduating in 1961. Joe built a career as an investment banker, first at Merrill Lynch and then at Donaldson, Lufkin, & Jenrette where he led the corporate finance group for 15 years. On Wall Street he was known for his unbending integrity and unending interest in others. Colleagues he worked with 40 years ago cite his mentorship as critical to their own success. Many also recall that he kept a saddle in the trunk of his car. After leaving DLJ, he continued to serve on the board of a number of companies, including Centex Development, CoStar Group, and Rosetta Resources. In 2002, he joined Catterton Partners as a Senior Advisor. He advised CEO's of Fortune 500 Companies and later helped friends and local business people expand their businesses or find a path out of trouble. If you came in contact with Joe, you remembered him with a smile. He blew his nose with a trumpet that turned heads, and he sang along to opera and Willie Nelson, whether or not he knew the words. He entertained children with his cowboy yip and songs about cowpies. He disliked mini-golf, ""a bastardization of the game"", cilantro and the snapping of gum. Joe grew up working as a ranch hand at French Creek, his family's guest ranch in Wyoming's Platte River Valley. His love for the West was infectious. He introduced hundreds of friends and colleagues to Wyoming with visits to the A Bar A, a ranch down the valley from French Creek. Joe was unexpectedly friendly and sincerely interested in everyone he met. Ordering at a restaurant was always time consuming because Joe needed to learn the name and background of the waiter -- some connection could always be found. By the time dessert came, he was often sitting at another table with people he had just met. To his five grandchildren, he was Poppa Joe. The grandfather who hid a radio under your pillow so you could listen to the Giants game at night. The patient teacher who poured a little extra root beer float in your glass to demonstrate the concept of principal and interest. He did not allow whining or weak handshakes. He was irreverent, generous, joyful and loving. He let you ride the ATV despite what your parents said. He paid his six year-old granddaughter to paint his toenails. To his three sons, he was a father who arose every morning at 5:30 to provide his children with opportunities and experiences that he never had. He encouraged his sons to pursue their passions, put together a plan, and then to ""get it done."" He was an investor in their dreams, their advisor, and friend. Joe loved the outdoors and gave generously to the Williamstown Rural Lands Foundation. He planted hundreds of trees and was often seen mowing the meadows surrounding his home in Williamstown. He had an extensive collection of John Deere tractors. When he ran out of space for more tractors, he gave them away to friends, because ""everyone needs a tractor."" He shared his passion for western music by setting up concerts in Williamstown. At these events, he would often join his hero Don Edwards on stage for a duet, despite the cringes of his wife and children. He served as a Williams class agent for many years and was selected to lead his class's procession at their 50th reunion. Joe was the lead donor in the purchase and renovation of the Sand Springs Recreation Center, a historic aquatic center that now serves as community gathering place and swim academy in Williamstown. He set up a foundation to fund free swim lessons so that no child would ever be afraid of the water. He loved opera, American antiques, and Western art. His favorite fashion statement was a young woman with a ponytail poking out of the back of a baseball cap. Joe was unbeatable in horseshoes, a devious opponent in gin rummy, and he could still out drive his sons well into his 70's. He gave his wife old pick-up trucks for her birthday. Children he barely knew named stuffed animals after him. He was loved by so many. There is now a giant hole in our hearts that we will all try to fill with the openness and generosity that was Joe Low. Joe is survived by Penny (Ireland) his loving wife of 50 years, three sons Tad (Alisa), Timothy (Loriann), and Jeffrey (Stacey), five grandchildren: Ryan, Julia, Aidan, Nicholas, and Eliza, his sister Katherine, and two brothers David and Charles, and numerous nieces and nephews. There will be a private family memorial service. Gifts in Joe's honor may be made to the Williamstown Rural Lands Foundation Williamstown, MA 01267 or simply through unexpected kindness or interest in another person's life."
2014-06-29T00:00:00Z,"PETRUSKA--Alexander. January 22, 1925 - June 14, 2014. Alex was born in Lodz, Poland to a distinguished musical family. His father, Seweryn, was a violinist and conductor of the Lodz Philharmonic Orchestra and his mother, Frances, was a respected piano teacher. He was on track to be an outstanding concert pianist. But then Hitler intervened. In December 1939 the family escaped from Lodz to Ostrowiecz which then became a labor camp in October 1942. In August 1944 he was sent to Auschwitz and then to Sachsenhausen, Oranienberg, and Dachau. On May 1, 1945 Alex escaped from a death march out of Dachau which had left before its liberation by the Allies. He encountered American soldiers and proceeded to become a Polish-English interpreter, learning English in a big hurry. Two years later, with his American Army papers, he embarked to the USA along with his mother who had also survived. He received a college degree in philosophy from Yeshiva University where he also started and led their first ever orchestra. He continued his musical studies at Juilliard with Adele Marcus and Edward Steuermann, teaching his own students as well. When many of his students became teachers and performing artists, he started APPTA, the Alexander Petruska Pianist Teachers Association to help his students convey their own knowledge. Each lesson with Alex was a miracle of discovery and insight into the composer and oneself. His students left lessons transformed and elevated. His masterclasses were enriched by his knowledge of all the arts, literature, philosophy, and history. With his indomitable spirit, he brought beauty and love into a world which had given him such cruelty and ugliness. He will be inconsolably missed for his exuberant love of music, his love of life, and his ability to bring out the best in every person he encountered. His memory will be forever our guiding light. We embrace his wife, Jane, his son and daughter Gary and Gwen, and his beloved granddaughter Mina."

Nancy Garden (1938-2014), prolific author of over thirty books for young people including ""Annie on My Mind"", one of the first novels for teenagers about two young girls who fall in love, died June 23 at her home in Carlisle, Massachusetts, at the age of 76. With her was her lifelong partner, Sandy Scott. Garden and Scott were married in 2004 when same-sex marriage was legalized in their home state of Massachusetts. Garden won many awards for her work. Among them was the Robert B. Downs for intellectual Freedom Award in 2000. In 2003 she received the Margaret A. Edwards award, honoring her ""significant and lasting contribution to young adult literature."" She became an ardent proponent of individual rights especially gay rights because she knew firsthand the challenges faced by young people whose sexual identities were in question. She worked all of her adult life to bring acceptance to the lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender communities, especially its youngest members, earning her a devoted following who found in her the hero they sought in their struggle to live their lives true to themselves. She contributed to the struggle for gay rights in the best way she knew how: through her writing. When ""Annie on My Mind"" was removed because of its content from a school library in Olathe, Kansas, a lawsuit was brought by kids who, in a landmark case, obtained a victory for the First Amendment rights of adolescents. Nancy lived and worked for several years in New York City, where she attended the School of Dramatic Arts at Columbia University, but her heart remained in New England and in 1972, she and her partner since high school, Sandy Scott, moved to Carlisle, Massachusetts. It was here, and in summers in Maine, that Nancy lived for the rest of her life. Services will be private.

Barbas III, the Janet and Keith Kellogg II Chair professor and member of The Skaggs Institute for Chemical Biology at The Scripps Research Institute (TSRI), died June 24 after a battle with a rare form of medullary thyroid cancer. He was 49. Barbas, who grew up in St. Petersburg, Florida, double-majored in physics and chemistry while graduating with honors at Eckerd College. He earned a PhD in 1989 and conducted postdoctoral studies at Pennsylvania State University and at The Scripps Research Institute, La Jolla. He joined the TSRI faculty in 1991, where he conducted studies focused on the development of new therapeutic approaches to human diseases through studies at the interface of synthetic organic chemistry, molecular biology and medicine. Some of his accomplishments include developing the first human antibody phage libraries, creating the first synthetic antibodies, developing the first artificial transcription factors capable of regulating endogenous genes, and pioneering chemically programmed antibodies. Each of these approaches has resulted in a new drug class that is currently in clinical trials or approved for the treatment of a variety of diseases. To translate his research into new therapies, Barbas founded three companies. In 1997, he co-founded Prolifaron, which was acquired by Alexion. In 2002, he started Cov-X, which was acquired by Pfizer. In 2008, he founded Zynegenia to develop the next generation of antibody-derived drugs. Barbas received national and international recognition for his work. He was the recipient of the Investigator Award from the Cancer Research Institute, the Presidential Green Chemistry Challenge Award, Arthur C. Cope Scholar Award from the American Chemical Society, a National Institutes of Health (NIH) Director's Pioneer Award and the Tetrahedron Young Investigator Award in Bioorganic and Medicinal Chemistry. He was named a scholar of The American Foundation for AIDS Research and a fellow of the American Associate for the Advancement of Science. In 2014, Barbas was named a fellow of the Academy of Microbiology. He was author on more than 330 scientific articles and was a named inventor on 58 issued U.S. patents. In a 2009 profile for his alma mater, Eckerd College, Barbas reflected on his decision to become a researcher: ""It's better than I envisioned. I didn't realize when I was studying science all the other opportunities it gives you to see the world. I have a very interesting kind of job that includes traveling the world to give talks. Things that I've worked on are being tested on people, and at some point, there will probably be someone in my family or someone I know who benefits directly."" In another interview [http://www.scripps.edu/newsandviews/e--20080114/covx.html], he said, ""It has been a dream of mine to develop drugs that make a difference."" ""I extend my deepest condolences to Carlos's family,"" said Michael Marletta, president and CEO of TSRI. ""He was a creative scientist who tackled broad-ranging and important biomedical questions to lay the foundation for new therapies. He was admired and loved by his many friends on our campus. We will miss him greatly."" Carlos loved to tell jokes, to prank his friends, host legendary parties, race fast cars, go to the gym and, most of all, to spend time with his family. Memorial Service will be held in La Jolla, CA. Barbas is survived by his wife, Annica; children, Derek, Sabrina, Sixten and Viggo; mother Joanna, sister, Maureen and family: Vincent, Marissa, Annalyse; step-siblings, Donny and Tami."

Coven, she is survived by her loving daughter Marie Kaplowitz (Fred), grandchildren Matthew (Jessica), Ilene Rinn (Mitch), great grandchildren Stella and Leo Kaplowitz, brother Leroy and numerous nieces and nephews.

Her teaching career began at PS 183 in Brownsville and she retired as Assistant Principal of PS 100 in Coney Island. Jesse closed his dental practice, and they left Brooklyn for warm Boca Raton, FL where they enjoyed almost 20 years of happiness in their new community surrounded by good friends, fine music, good books, and HAM radio. Roslyn was a great raconteur and entertained many with her stories of childhood, travels, and teaching experiences. She lived her life with dignity and grace, always ""ladylike"", even when tossing back a good Scotch with friends. Roslyn will be missed."

Born in Brooklyn, New York, Zimmerman attended Poly Prep High School and then graduated from The University of Miami in 1972. Shortly thereafter, he started Kenar Enterprises with Murray Levy. In the early 90's, Zimmerman was one of the first and one of the strongest leaders in philanthropic efforts in the Fashion Industry. He used his company's largest advertising vehicle, the billboard at One Times Square, under the Sony TV screen for 10 years. It was there that the world could see his provocative advertisements of global social issues, such as AIDS, Elisabeth Glaser's Pediatric AIDS Foundation, and Evelyn Lauder's Breast Cancer Research Foundation. His well-known supermodels, Linda Evangelista, Helena Christensen, Naomi Campbell, and Claudia Schiffer were the cause of many traffic jams in Times Square. One of his most celebrated campaigns featured an advertisement shot in Sicily with Linda Evangelista and seven Sicilian women dressed in black; limited editions of the photograph were sold with proceeds going to an AIDS education group. The International Center for Photography included it as one of the '20 most important fashion photographs"" ever. Kenar opened stores world-wide, but in 1994, the New York flagship on Madison Avenue opened to much fan-fare as Mrs. Evelyn Lauder, Mayor Giuliani, Elizabeth Hurley, Linda Evangelista, and Mr. Zimmerman cut the huge Pink Ribbon dedicating a portion of Kenar's sales that October for Breast Cancer Awareness month to BCRF. After selling the brand Kenar to the Pegasus Fund, Kenny purchased other brands that were in bankruptcy and rebuilt them. Some of these brands were Schrader, St. Gillian, A.J. Bari, Freeway, In Transit, and Hero Group (Black Tie by Oleg Cassini). In 1999, Kenny formed a new venture, Emma Black and Zola Evening, producing sportswear and evening wear for major department stores around the world. Never satisfied with all of his accomplishments, in 2003, Kenny developed Calvin Klein Outerwear, a newly acquired license by Calvin Klein Corporation. He was proud to be able to support many charities and causes. Another project dear to his heart was working with The Partnership for the Homeless, along with restaurants across the city helping to feed those less fortunate. He was on the Board of The Jack Martin Fund at Mount Sinai Hospital and the Board of Directors at the JCC on the Palisades. He was also on the Advisory Board of Babies Hospital at Columbia Presbyterian Hospital. Kenny's family was more important than any of his companies or positions. Arlene Zimmerman, his beloved wife of 42 years; his proud, loving children, Nicole, Zachary, and Ryan Zimmerman; his grandchildren, Ethan and Jordan Zimmerman; and his sister, Leslie Daspin, survive him. His eldest son Matthew predeceased him in 2012."

2014-07-06T00:00:00Z,"YEN--Pao Ming, one of the founders of the Summit Group and President of Summit Industrial Corporation, passed away peacefully on June 29, 2014, with his family at his side. He was born March 27, 1917 in Gulangyu Island, Amoy/Xiamen, in southern China. He was the eldest son of six sisters and three brothers, the child of Jian Chien Yen and Hsu Fung Ling. Having experienced the early passing of his father when he was a teenager, he attended the prestigious Tsing Hua University in Bejing, majoring in chemical engineering, which he continued after receiving a full scholarship to MIT in Cambridge, MA. It was at MIT where he met his future Summit partners C.C. Wang and J.T. Shaw (and later Dr. C.D. Shiah). After graduating in 1944 and after the communist revolution in China in 1949, he had to remain in the United States., finding work with the Firestone Co. A few years later, after becoming a U.S. citizen, he then started the Summit Group with the aforementioned classmates. Summit was an amalgam of the phrase ""Sum of MIT,"" reflecting their common alma mater. Summit specialized in trade with Asia, acting often as middle man for companies in the U.S. that wanted to do business with Asian companies. As the company grew in the 1950s, 60s and 70s, it was involved in such diverse areas as crude oil, pharmaceuticals, computers, food stuffs, and electronics and has partnerships with major companies such as Motorola, General Motors, British Petroleum, Caltex, C.Itoh, and Singapore Petroleum Co. At its height, it had offices in Taiwan, Hong Kong, Bangkok, Tokyo, Okinawa, Saigon, Penang (Malaysia), Singapore, and Bermuda. In 1953 he met Caroline Wang, and after she immigrated to the U.S. to attend college, they married in 1955 at Trinity Church in New York City. They had their first son, Victor (now a real estate businessman) in 1956 and followed with a second son, Vincent (now an endocrinologist at Beth Israel Hospital in NYC) in 1959. Mr. Yen is survived by his wife and two sons; along with a remaining sister; brother; and various nephews and nieces. Services will be at the Frank E.

2014-07-06T00:00:00Z,"WOLFSON--Monte, a retail executive who had a key role in engineering some of the most important innovations of the modern apparel industry, died at Calvary hospice in the Bronx on July 2nd after a brief illness. He was 91. As a senior apparel buyer at Macy's in the late 1950's, Mr. Wolfson was a member of the first team of retailers that traveled to Asia to successfully source import apparel programs to the US. In the 1970s, while President of the Netco apparel division of Zayre, he devised breakthrough models of distribution center efficiency well before the advent of automated warehouse equipment. As the increase of import apparel programs created overages too large for conventional retailers to handle, he then conceived the model for TJ Maxx, the first retail chain to specialize in closeout apparel. Mr. Wolfson was a US Government advisor on the retail textile industry since 1982, and in 1990 he formed Monte Wolfson Associates, a retail consulting firm. Mr Wolfson was born and raised in the Bronx, son of Irving and Helen Wolfson: he graduated from DeWitt Clinton High School in 1941. In the fall of 1941 he attended the University Of Illinois and participated in their ROTC program. In 1942 he was called into active service in the United States Army and was stationed at Ft. Sills, Oklahoma. He was honorably discharged and returned to the University of Illinois in 1944, where he earned his B.S. degree. He later earned an M.B.A. from New York University. In addition to his passion for business, he loved sports, theater and history; citing Willie Mays, William Shakespeare and Barbara Tuchman as three of the people he most admired. He was an avid tennis player known for his wicked cross-court forehand, and a long time member of the East Hampton Tennis Club. He enjoyed traveling, skiing with his family, and rooting for his beloved Knicks, Football Giants and Mets. In 1981 he was honored by The City Of Hope Medical Center and received their 'Spirit Of Life' award. Mr Wolfson's wife of 47 years, the former Doris Elaine Hertz, died in 2000. He is survived by their three children, Robert, Suzanne and Jon; Jon's wife Katherine; grandchildren Jayne, Tom, Grace and Lena; sister Muriel Oppenheimer; nephews Michael and David Oppenheimer; niece Amy Oppenheimer and his loving companion Laurel Isaacs.

2014-07-06T00:00:00Z,"DERRICK--John. October 16, 1932, Bennettsville, South Carolina- June 19, 2014, New York City. The son of Oscar Derrick and Pauline Liles Derrick. John Richard Derrick ""Dickie"" to his family and Dick to his school friends--grew up in Bennettsville obsessed with Hollywood musicals, especially the dancing. After high school and a few local jobs in a building supply and lumber yard, in a cinema etc., he entered the United States Air Force. While stationed in Tampa he used every minute of his spare time off base to study with Gail Armour, a well-known ballet mistress in Florida. Ms. Armour saw a potential ""danseur noble"" in John with his tall good looks and supple yet muscular body. At the end of his military service, and under the guidance of Ms. Armour, he applied for, and won, a scholarship to the renowned Marie Rembert School of Ballet in London. The application involved sending a 16mm film of his performance for Marie Rembert's consideration. He trained with Rembert for two years and then found work in Italy with regional companies, chiefly in Rome where he continued working with private teachers. On returning to the United States he spent time with The Metropolitan Opera which led to a call from The Miami Ballet with which he had a long association that continued even after his primary residence was established in New York. Being a jack-of-all-theatrical-trades, including acting, he appeared frequently in musicals, dramatic and comic plays. His life partner, Milton Beyer, worked in theatrical production and at a certain point the men bought a pleasant apartment in Greenwich Village and opened a vintage goods store on Christopher St., ""keep the wolves away between jobs"" Milton proclaimed. It was successful for many years and allowed John to take theatrical engagements as they came along. Milton preceded John in death in 1995. John (Dickie) is survived by his sister, Barbara Derrick Crosland, brother-in-law, James Crosland, and numerous nephews, nieces, great-nephews and great-nieces. As per his wish, John has been cremated. Later there will be a gathering of friends to remember John and his wonderful life in the theater."

2014-07-06T00:00:00Z,"CAMERON--Dr. John M.,the Founder, Chairman, and President of ProCure Treatment Centers, the country's leading provider of proton-based cancer treatment, died on Thursday in Bloomington, Indiana. He was 73. Dr. Cameron, a nuclear physicist, was a pioneer in developing proton therapy as an alternative to traditional radiation treatment for advanced cancer. At ProCure, he oversaw the development and operation of four proton therapy centers in the United States that currently treat thousands of patients annually. Dr. Cameron also established the ProCure Cancer Foundation, which provides financial aid to enable pediatric patients to travel with their families to receive this less invasive form of cancer treatment. Prior to founding ProCure, Dr. Cameron had a long and distinguished career in nuclear physics, medical technology, research and administration. He received his Ph.D. in physics from the University of California, Los Angeles in 1967 and then joined the physics faculty at the University of Alberta in Edmonton, Canada. For nearly 20 years, he served as Professor of Physics at Indiana University, during which time he also directed the University's Cyclotron Facility. He played a pivotal role in creating the Midwest Proton Radiotherapy Institute at Indiana University in 2004. Dr. Cameron was elected Fellow of the American Physical Society in 1987.

2014-07-06T00:00:00Z,"CASPER--Laurence.92, New York, died peacefully surrounded by his family on June 24. Adoring father of Pamela with his first wife Selma, and doting father of Nicole and Hillary with beloved wife Brett of 37 years, proud grandfather of Sebastian and Viola, cherished father-in-law, brother-in-law and uncle. Graduated Boys High in Brooklyn at 16, kicked out of Brooklyn College where he was too engrossed in the library studying his own choice of books, but not before winning the boxing championship! He served proudly in the Army Air Corps in WWII as an officer and bombardier navigator with the B-24 Liberators, received his BA at Kent State under the GI bill. At the NYU Institute of Fine Arts he melded his passion of history and art. His expertise in sculpture, graphics and paintings stretched from Old Masters to contemporary art. Prior to founding Casper Fine Arts & Appraisals, Inc., he joined the Danenberg Galleries and ACA Gallery as Director of Exhibitions and served as President of the Appraisers Association of America. With his insight, intellect and profound understanding of art aesthetics, he initiated fresh interest in the early American modernists: John Marin, Charles Burchfield, Georgia O'Keefe and Joseph Cornell. In '68, he pioneered an exhibition of Norman Rockwell, signaling a shift in the art world's view of him from illustrator of the Saturday Evening Post to fine artist. This pivotal exhibition was shown in ten museums around the country. He remained committed to championing Rockwell's work and was sought for his expert opinion on the artist's paintings and market. His presence on Madison Avenue, in the great auction houses and museums, was highly respected. Ever the teacher, he generously shared his time and knowledge. He cultivated an interest in medicine with such zeal, ordering tests and analyzing results, that doctors often thought he was a doctor himself. His attorney father discouraged him from pursuing law, but he successfully represented his clients in litigation proceedings, advised their attorneys, gave expert testimony in US Tax Court, and most recently represented his wife against the injustices of parking violations. Even in his nineties, he could be found studying Russian and Japanese on tape. A true renaissance man, his overflowing library contains tomes on history, medicine, law, art, Jewish humor, bridge, philosophy, chemistry, astronomy and more. A football, soccer, baseball, golf, wrestling aficionado, he was a men's singles tennis champ, beating men 20 years his junior. He relished being a father, overcome with emotion each time he spoke of his daughters; he wanted for them only what they would want for themselves. His profound generosity, sensitivity, stubbornness, humor, openness, honesty and utmost integrity touched those around him; he was cherished and will be deeply missed by all."

2014-07-07T00:00:00Z,"DAITZ--Stephen G.,died June 19, 2014 at home. He was Professor Emeritus of the Department of Classical Languages and Hebrew at The City College and the CUNY Graduate Center. His principal interest was the oral reading of ancient Greek and Latin, with great attention given to the ""restored pronunciation"" of those languages as well as the metrics of their poetry. Silent reading had no place in the study of the Classics, he maintained; their literature was composed to be recited aloud. He recorded the entire Iliad and Odyssey, Euripides' Hekabe, Aristophanes' Birds, Plato's Portrait of Sokrates, as well as selections of ancient Greek poetry and oratory. His recordings, made between 1978 and 1998, are still available from Bolchazy-Carducci Publishers, as are those teaching the pronunciation and reading of Ancient Greek and Classical Latin. He gave recitals and workshops at universities and scholarly meetings throughout North America and Europe as well as in Australia and Argentina. In 1999 his recital of Greek literature was presented at the Metropolitan Museum of Art to celebrate the opening of the newly restored halls displaying ancient Greek art. He was the first president of SORGLL, the Society for the Oral Reading of Greek and Latin Literature (see their web site). A group of students and teachers studied the Homeric hexameter with him on Saturday mornings in his Upper West Side apartment. Stephen Daitz's education at Yale, the Sorbonne, and Harvard initially lead him to the publication of critical editions, but his love of music underpinned his resuscitation of the sounds of Classical literature. He taught at CUNY from 1957 to 1991 and at the University of Paris in 1971-73 and 1979-80. His teaching at the Ecole Normale Superieure inspired the creation of Theatre Demodocos, which presents staged productions of Classical drama in the original language. A confirmed Francophile, he spoke French at home, teaching all his children to speak the language. A lifelong outdoorsman, reaching the summits of the Matterhorn and Mont Blanc were among his proudest achievements. He spent forty-five summers at Great East Lake in Acton, Maine, near New Hampshire's White Mountains, where he enjoyed hikes with family and friends. Stephen Daitz was born on August 16, 1926 in New York City. He is survived by his wife, Mimi S. Daitz of New York City, his son Maurice and daughter-in-law Sharon Jaycox Daitz of Scarsdale, NY, his son Benjamin of New York City and Gardiner, NY, and his sister, Sonia Lazar of Culver City, CA. He was predeceased by his daughter, Francesca. A memorial gathering will be held Sunday, afternoon, September 21, 2014, place to be announced."

Mr. van Eck founded Van Eck Global, a mutual fund manager, in 1955. A pioneer of international investments, Mr. van Eck was early to recognize the potential for value in the post-war economic recoveries of Europe and Japan, and founded International Investors Incorporated in 1955 to provide a convenient investment vehicle for Americans to invest in foreign growth stocks. In 1968, after studying under the Austrian economist Ludwig von Mises at New York University, Mr. van Eck launched the country's first gold-oriented mutual fund in time to participate in the great gold bull market of the 1970s. Mr. van Eck was always a great believer in sound money and was wary of the powers of the Federal Reserve Bank. International Investors Gold Fund remains the oldest mutual fund to concentrate in precious metals mining shares. Today, Van Eck Global manages over $35 billion. Mr. van Eck was a relentless optimist, full of ""joyful noise."" He was flirtatious and a kind soul to the end. He hewed to his family's ""Dutch"" values of tolerance and openness to other ways and customs. Last, he was a Californian, having spent his early days there when sugar farmers and gold miners still loomed large and bulls ran on the beaches. Mr. van Eck received a BA from Williams College in 1936 and an MBA from Harvard University in 1938. From 1941 to 1945, he served in the U.S. Navy. He began his career as an investment banker at Morgan Stanley in 1946 where he remained for four years. He was a partner of Steckler & Moore, a New York Stock Exchange firm, from 1951 to 1955. During the course of his 50-year career, Mr. van Eck served as Chairman of the Foreign Analyst Committee of the New York Society of Security Analysts, Associate Editor for the Financial Analysts Journal, and as President of the New York Association of Foreign Analysts. He also served as a director of several corporations such as The Henley Group, Inc., Wheelabrator-Frye Inc., and the Eclipse Financial Trust. Mr. van Eck was born in San Francisco in 1915. His father, J.C. van Panthaleon Baron van Eck, was the founder of Shell Oil Co. in the United States and Managing Director of Royal Dutch Oil Co. Mr. van Eck is survived by his wife, Sigrid van Eck, his sisters Agnes Reed and Henriette Warfield, and his son Jan van Eck, who serves as Chief Executive Officer of Van Eck Global. He was predeceased by his other son, Derek van Eck. He is also survived by his two daughters-in-law, Cynthia van Eck and Deborah S. van Eck and six grandchildren."

Walter is mourned by all of us at Scholastic who were honored to work with him and to publish more than 25 of his 100 plus books for children. During a distinguished career spanning more than 45 years, Walter's contribution to children's and young adult literature included picture books, poetry, fiction and nonfiction titles, which were recognized with numerous honors, including two Newbery Honor medals, three National Book Award Finalists, and six Coretta Scott King Awards/Honors. Among his award-winning titles are hard-hitting novels about war: Fallen Angels (1988), about the Vietnam War, Sunrise Over Fallujah (2008) about Iraq and, most recently, Invasion (2010) set in World War II. Two of his picture books published by Scholastic, Harlem (1997), which won a Caldecott Honor, and Shadow of the Red Moon (1995), were illustrated by his talented son, author/illustrator, Christopher Myers. In 2012, Walter Dean Myers was appointed the National Ambassador for Young People's Literature by the Children's Book Council and toured the nation promoting the importance of reading for children of all ages. Walter changed the face of children's literature by representing the diversity of the children of our nation in his award-winning books. He was a deeply authentic person and writer who urged other authors, editors and publishers not only to make sure every child could find him or herself in a book, but also to tell compelling and challenging stories that would inspire children to reach their full potential. Our favorite quote from Walter is a clarion call to embrace the power of books to inform and transform lives he said, ""Once I began to read, I began to exist."" He will be missed by us all.

All of us at Chadbourne & Parke LLP, the firm to which he devoted the last 26 years of his distinguished career, wish to express sorrow on the loss of our beloved partner, colleague and friend Donald Schapiro, who passed away peacefully on July 3 at the age of 88. Don was a leading practitioner and our active partner until his passing on Thursday, literally closing transactions, planning and structuring for opportunities and providing sophisticated advice to his clients until recent months. This was only a small part of his many achievements during a long and remarkable career. Don graduated from Yale College in 1944 (Phi Beta Kappa), Yale Law School in 1949 (Order of the Coif) and was a visiting professor at the Yale Law School for some 25 years (where he taught Legal Accounting to some of today's recognized lawyers and business leaders). After a brief period at the Paul Weiss law firm, he became Assistant Chief Counsel to the United States House of Representatives Ways and Means Committee on Administration of the Internal Revenue Laws. Don then became a member and a name partner in the law firm Barrett Smith Schapiro Simon & Armstrong until 1988 when he and many of his then partners joined Chadbourne & Parke LLP. He was Chairman of the New York State Bar Association Tax Section, was on the Boards of numerous organizations and received many awards and acknowledgements in the legal community. Don was an absolutely brilliant lawyer (and not just tax lawyer, as he often said). And throughout his distinguished career he was a continuing mentor and confidant to young lawyers, business executives, government representatives, and his numerous and great clients, friends and colleagues. Our thoughts and prayers are with his loving family during this most difficult time. We will all miss Donald Schapiro. The Lawyers and Staff of Chadbourne & Parke LLP"

Walter is mourned by all of us at Scholastic who were honored to work with him and to publish more than 25 of his 100 plus books for children. During a distinguished career spanning more than 45 years, Walter's contribution to children's and young adult literature included picture books, poetry, fiction and nonfiction titles, which were recognized with numerous honors, including two Newbery Honor medals, three National Book Award Finalists, and six Coretta Scott King Awards/Honors. Among his award-winning titles are hard-hitting novels about war: Fallen Angels (1988), about the Vietnam War, Sunrise Over Fallujah (2008) about Iraq and, most recently, Invasion (2010) set in World War II. Two of his picture books published by Scholastic, Harlem (1997), which won a Caldecott Honor, and Shadow of the Red Moon (1995), were illustrated by his talented son, author/illustrator, Christopher Myers. In 2012, Walter Dean Myers was appointed the National Ambassador for Young People's Literature by the Children's Book Council and toured the nation promoting the importance of reading for children of all ages. Walter changed the face of children's literature by representing the diversity of the children of our nation in his award-winning books. He was a deeply authentic person and writer who urged other authors, editors and publishers not only to make sure every child could find him or herself in a book, but also to tell compelling and challenging stories that would inspire children to reach their full potential. Our favorite quote from Walter is a clarion call to embrace the power of books to inform and transform lives he said, ""Once I began to read, I began to exist."" He will be missed by us all.

Azrieli, an Architect, Builder and Developer, a billionaire, who with his wife, Stephanie Lefcort, a former librarian and an artistic painter, is a Yeshiva University Benefactor. He named the Azrieli Graduate School of Jewish Education and Administration in 1982 with a gift of $1 million (US funds) and has since made additional major Benefactor level gifts to his school, most recently in July 2012, with a $10 million (CAD) gift to establish the Azrieli Scholarships Program at the Azrieli Graduate School of Jewish Education and Administration made by the Azrieli Foundation Inc., of which his daughter, Dr. Naomi Azrieli, is the Chair. These combined gifts to Yeshiva University are among the largest of the total of more than $100 million the Azrieli family has donated to educational and other projects over the past 23 years. David Azrieli relinquished his Chairmanship of The Azrieli Group Ltd. In Israel last week due to failing health and his daughter, Danna Azrieli, has been appointed Acting Chair overseeing the 13 Israeli Malls for which he coined the name Canion which combines the Hebrew words for purchasing and parking. The Icon Mall is the Azrieli Towers in Tel Aviv renowned for its three iconic geometric designs. He also was a major industrialist with subsidiaries in energy, water and environment industries and had significant holdings in banking and the credit card business. He was President in Canada of, Canpro Investments, a privately held real estate development and management company with headquarters in Montreal. The Azrieli Foundation Inc. focuses primarily on education, donating large amounts to schools and universities, also funding Holocaust education and creating programs for early education and intervention, among others. As Presidents of Yeshiva University during the time since David J. Azrieli was our foremost leader in Canada, we were privileged to enjoy his friendship and sage advice which he also shared with the Deans of the Azrieli Graduate School of Jewish Education and Administration, Dr. David J. Schnall and the new Dean Dr. Rona Novick. He was especially close to Rabbi Dr. Herbert C. Dobrinsky, Vice President for University Affairs who serves as our University's liaison officer with Canadian Jewry, and our National Director of Canadian Friends of Yeshiva University, Stuart Haber. All of us extend our sincere condolences to his wife, Stefanie Azrieli, their children and grandchildren: Rafael (Rafi) Azrieli, Sharon and Avi Perez, Matthew and Solomon Azrieli; Dr. Naomi and Francois Blanc, Joseph, Gabriel and Madeleine Blanc; Danna and Danny Hakim, Galia and Ella. May the entire family be comforted among the mourners of Zion and Jerusalem. Yeshiva University Richard M. Joel, President Norman Lamm, President Emeritus Jeremy Magence, National President CFYU"

Mr. Hall was the son of the late Katherine and John H. Hall of Hartsdale, NY, and the grandson of the late Dr. and Mrs. Lewis R. Morris of New York City and Manor House Farms in Morris. He was the direct descendant of Lewis Morris, a New York signer of the Declaration of Independence and General Jacob Morris, one of the earliest settlers of the Butternut Valley immediately following the American Revolution. Lewis was also related to Gouverneur Morris, responsible for the Preamble and editor of the Constitution and an abolitionist well before the Civil War. He was the great-grandson of William Andrews Clark, who was a Senator from Montana and a noted art collector. Lewis was born in New York City, May 7, 1929, and raised in Hartsdale, NY. He attended the Thomas School and Arizona Desert School in Tucson, AZ, and the Salisbury School in Salisbury, CT. He received a Bachelor of Arts degree from Colgate University. He received a Masters Degree in Business and a second Masters Degree in History both from New York University. After completing his degrees, Lewis taught Cultural History at the Brooklyn Friends School. Lewis was a multi-faceted man: a writer, author, lecturer and historian. He was a noted opera historian with a special interest in the French style of singing. His vast collection of 78 phonographic records covered singing from the early 20th Century. In recent years, he produced many CDs around specific themes or artists from his collection. He was on the Board of the Vocal Record Collectors' Society, for which he produced a number of programs devoted to the early singers of the French Opera House in New Orleans, one of the oldest opera houses in the Unites States. He was also an avid collector of opera memorabilia that included librettos, scores, photographs, sketches and more, which recently was accepted by the Morgan Library. He served on the Board of the Glimmerglass Opera and he was Chair of the Music Policy Committee. For over 20 years, he also assembled for them the annual summer exhibition from his extensive collection on opera history. Lewis is survived by his wife of 51 years, Gemma Stagni Hall, daughter Angelica Romano, and two grandchildren, Isabella and Luca Romano. You may pay your respects to Lewis at the Frank E. Campbell Funeral Home, 1076 Madison Avenue, on Thursday, July 10th from 4-6pm. A funeral service will take place at All Saints Chapel in Morris on Saturday, July 19.

2014-07-10T00:00:00Z,"FRIEDFELD--Fredrick. The Friedfeld family deeply mourns the loss of their patriarch Fredrick Friedfeld who passed away July 4th at the age of 87. Freddy, as he was affectionately known, proudly served in the US Navy, and became an optician on the GI Bill. Following his education, he worked several years in NYC learning the optical trade. With a $3,000 loan from an uncle and the blessings of his employer, he founded ClearVision Optical in 1949. Working tirelessly, Fred grew his one man organization and today ClearVision is amongst the largest family owned eyewear distributors in North America. The business was both his occupation and passion. He had a true knack for selling, and never gave up. His unique skill was listening, and knowing the customer's needs. His customers became his friends, and as he grew older he became a mentor to many in the business. However his true love was family. Fred's marriage in 1955 to young Mimi Forman started on a blind date where he proposed at the top of the Empire State Building and she accepted. Married within six months (during a slower selling season), Fred and Mimi had a 59 year romance that was obvious to all who witnessed their affection for one another. Fred had a soul mate in Mimi, a business partner, a wife, best friend, and mother of four great kids. Whenever not working, he was playing. He played at cards winning most of the time, golf where he loved breaking 100 the honest way, deep sea fishing and travelling the world with Mimi, friends, and his family. Throughout his life he enjoyed collecting stamps and coins, managing his stock portfolio on his iPhone, but what he loved most in his later years was playing with, and teaching his nine grandchildren. He relished the success and activities of his nine grandchildren, who each claim to be his favorite, a mathematical formula only Fred was capable of. In addition to his wife, Mimi, Friedfeld is survived by his son, David and Vicki Friedfeld, and their four children-- Jacob, Samuel, Faith and Lucas; by Peter Friedfeld and Patrick McLaughlin; by Dr. Douglas and Cari Friedfeld and their children-- Charlie and Hannah; and by daughter Elizabeth Friedfeld-Gebaide, her husband, Eric, and their three children, Sophie, Daniel and Izzy. As a salute to his service in the US Armed Forces, the family will be establishing a fund to assist in rehabilitative and educational services to members of the US Navy. Those interested in supporting the Navy-Marine Corps Relief Society please visit nmcrs.org to donate. In addition, the family is establishing a Fred Friedfeld Scholarship at the SUNY College of Optometry which can be supported by donations to the school's Optometric Foundation. Donations and inquiries about the scholarship fund can be sent to the attention of Ann Warwick, VP of SUNY Optometry and executive director of the school's Optometric Center of New York at awarwick@sunyopt.edu."

2014-07-11T00:00:00Z,"FRIEDFELD--Fredrick. The Friedfeld family deeply mourns the loss of their patriarch Fredrick Friedfeld who passed away July 4th at the age of 87. Freddy, as he was affectionately known, proudly served in the US Navy, and became an optician on the GI Bill. Following his education, he worked several years in NYC learning the optical trade. With a $3,000 loan from an uncle and the blessings of his employer, he founded ClearVision Optical in 1949. Working tirelessly, Fred grew his one man organization and today ClearVision is amongst the largest family owned eyewear distributors in North America. The business was both his occupation and passion. He had a true knack for selling, and never gave up. His unique skill was listening, and knowing the customer's needs. His customers became his friends, and as he grew older he became a mentor to many in the business. However his true love was family. Fred's marriage in 1955 to young Mimi Forman started on a blind date where he proposed at the top of the Empire State Building and she accepted. Married within six months (during a slower selling season), Fred and Mimi had a 59 year romance that was obvious to all who witnessed their affection for one another. Fred had a soul mate in Mimi, a business partner, a wife, best friend, and mother of four great kids. Whenever not working, he was playing. He played at cards winning most of the time, golf where he loved breaking 100 the honest way, deep sea fishing and travelling the world with Mimi, friends, and his family. Throughout his life he enjoyed collecting stamps and coins, managing his stock portfolio on his iPhone, but what he loved most in his later years was playing with, and teaching his nine grandchildren. He relished the success and activities of his nine grandchildren, who each claim to be his favorite, a mathematical formula only Fred was capable of. In addition to his wife, Mimi, Friedfeld is survived by his son, David and Vicki Friedfeld, and their four children-- Jacob, Samuel, Faith and Lucas; by Peter Friedfeld and Patrick McLaughlin; by Dr. Douglas and Cari Friedfeld and their children-- Charlie and Hannah; and by daughter Elizabeth Friedfeld-Gebaide, her husband, Eric, and their three children, Sophie, Daniel and Izzy. As a salute to his service in the US Armed Forces, the family will be establishing a fund to assist in rehabilitative and educational services to members of the US Navy. Those interested in supporting the Navy-Marine Corps Relief Society please visit nmcrs.org to donate. In addition, the family is establishing a Fred Friedfeld Scholarship at the SUNY College of Optometry which can be supported by donations to the school's Optometric Foundation. Donations and inquiries about the scholarship fund can be sent to the attention of Ann Warwick, VP of SUNY Optometry and executive director of the school's Optometric Center of New York at awarwick@sunyopt.edu."

A devoted family man, a statesman, a generous philanthropist, he led a wonderfully full, productive and exciting life. Born in 1918 on the steppes of Russia where his ancestors had been banished from their homeland of Lithuania by the Czars, he returned to Lithuania as a young boy but was forced to flee again in 1944 when Communists invaded. After three years in displaced persons camps in Germany, he won a fellowship to Yale University to study for his doctorate in economics, and with his wife Alexandra and daughter Jurate settled happily in America. He had a successful career as a businessman and entrepreneur and was always grateful for the opportunities his new country gave him. But he never forgot his homeland during the nearly 50 dark years of Soviet occupation. He worked relentlessly to help secure its freedom - lobbying US government officials and supporting the independence movement Sajudis. When Lithuania was an independent country again, he helped bring in global business, established the first cellular phone company and created a family foundation to support educational, cultural and social causes. For his many good works, he received numerous honors from universities, organizations, and the Lithuanian government. But family was his first and foremost enduring love and pride. He adored his beloved Alexandra who died at age 91 three years ago just weeks before their 70th wedding anniversary. He was a loving father to Jurate and sons Joseph, Michael and John and suffered the loss of Alexander who died in 1976. He was a doting, playful grandfather to 11 wonderful grandchildren, inspiring them and sharing his advice and wisdom. He will always be remembered for his enthusiastic love of life, his charm, his many friendships, and his never-ending gratitude to God Almighty for the countless blessings in his life. Wake will be held Sunday from 4-6 at Yardley and Pino Funeral Home and a Mass on Monday 11am at Most Holy Trinity Church in East Hampton. In lieu of flowers, please send donations to the Lithuanian Foundation; 14911 127th Street; Lemont, IL 60439."

2014-07-13T00:00:00Z,"KAZICKAS--Joseph P. Joseph P. Kazickas passed peacefully at home in East Hampton, NY on July 9, 2014 at the age of 96. A devoted family man, a statesman, a generous philanthropist, he led a wonderfully full, productive and exciting life. Born in 1918 on the steppes of Russia where his ancestors had been banished from their homeland of Lithuania by the Czars, he returned to Lithuania as a young boy but was forced to flee again in 1944 when Communists invaded. After three years in displaced persons camps in Germany, he won a fellowship to Yale University to study for his doctorate in economics, and with his wife Alexandra and daughter Jurate settled happily in America. He had a successful career as a businessman and entrepreneur and was always grateful for the opportunities his new country gave him. But he never forgot his homeland during the nearly 50 dark years of Soviet occupation. He worked relentlessly to help secure its freedom - lobbying US government officials and supporting the independence movement Sajudis. When Lithuania was an independent country again, he helped bring in global business, established the first cellular phone company and created a family foundation to support educational, cultural and social causes. For his many good works, he received numerous honors from universities, organizations, and the Lithuanian government. But family was his first and foremost enduring love and pride. He adored his beloved Alexandra who died at age 91 three years ago just weeks before their 70th wedding anniversary. He was a loving father to Jurate and sons Joseph, Michael and John and suffered the loss of Alexander who died in 1976. He was a doting, playful grandfather to 11 wonderful grandchildren, inspiring them and sharing his advice and wisdom. He will always be remembered for his enthusiastic love of life, his charm, his many friendships, and his never-ending gratitude to God Almighty for the countless blessings in his life. Wake will be held Sunday from 4-6 at Yardley and Pino Funeral Home and a Mass on Monday 11am at Most Holy Trinity Church in East Hampton. In lieu of flowers, please send donations to the Lithuanian Foundation; 14911 127th Street; Lemont, IL 60439."

2014-07-15T00:00:00Z,"WHALEN--Edward James. Formerly of Short Hills, NJ and a current resident of Ponte Vedra Beach, Florida passed away peacefully on July 11, 2014 in Morristown, NJ after a brief illness. He was in his 91st year. Ed's career was an example of the post-WWII American Dream at its best. Born in 1923 into a hard working family of modest means, Ed rose out of the steel mills of Youngstown, Ohio to become a highly respected businessman. More importantly he was a beloved father, grandfather and great-grandfather, a doting husband to his wife, Betsy Whalen, for 29 years, and after her too early death from ovarian cancer in 1979, a loving companion to Suzanne Yeaw for the last 32 years of his life. Endowed with brains, good looks and the gift of blarney and fashioning himself a gentleman and a scholar, Ed accomplished a great deal. Disqualified from service in WWII by working in the essential steel industry, Ed attended both St. Vincent College in Latrobe, PA and The Ohio State University before graduating from Youngstown University. He then received his law degree from the University of Cincinnati, graduating in 1948. Ed then worked briefly with the Ohio Securities Commission before entering the Army both as an officer and a member of the Judge Advocate General's Corps. While on duty in Washington he introduced himself to a beautiful young New Zealand lady who was sunning herself on the rooftop of the same apartment building in which they both lived. Family lore is and witnesses confirm that, upon meeting Betsy Proud, Ed immediately asked for her hand in marriage. She, however, preferred a date or two first. Whatever the facts, they were married on November 18, 1950 and began a love affair that would only end by Betsy's death at the age of 57. During their honeymoon, Ed was ordered to Korea where he spent three years at the front, including the Chosin Reservoir and Inchon, enforcing the laws of military justice. He was awarded the Bronze Star for valor. The Korean War brought hardship but also opportunity. Ed, as was his habit, was befriended by certain members of the ""top brass"" and soon found himself with an offer to join a little known but growing company, International Telephone and Telegraph (ITT), as an attorney. As ITT went, so did Ed Whalen, becoming successively corporate secretary, North American General Counsel, and the chief operating officer of the Far East and Pacific Group. He moved his family, which now included two children, from Belleville, NJ to West Orange and then to Short Hills where he was an early Saturday morning regular at Canoe Brook Country Club and a Sunday morning regular at St. Rose of Lima Church. Retiring from ITT in 1981, he practiced law privately in Washington DC for several years before moving to Hilton Head Island and later to Ponte Vedra Beach. Ed will be forever loved by his ""Suzy"" of Madison, NJ; his beloved daughter Jessica Whalen Haverstick and, her husband, Alec, of Short Hills, NJ, his devoted son, Jeffrey Woodney Whalen of Seattle, WA, his four lucky grandchildren, Emily Umbdenstock ( Tyler) ;Samuel A. Haverstick III (Casey) and Genevieve Haverstick, all of New York City, and Abigail Woodney Wachter (John) of Princeton, NJ. Ed is also survived by five great grandchildren under the age of four, all of whom attended his 90th birthday: Liam, Luke, Izzy, Sadie and Wyatt.

2014-07-15T00:00:00Z,"WARREN--Peter K.,Former Pepsi International CEO, PepsiCo Board Member, dies at 94. Peter K. Warren, active in the beverage industry for almost 70 years and the man responsible for Pepsi Cola's market entry into more than 100 countries over three decades died on Monday in Wilton, CT. He was 94. Recognized by friends and business associates from around the world as a true beverage industry icon and an inspirational global business leader, Peter possessed the charisma and business acumen to meet the formidable challenges faced by many companies entering international markets for the first time. His cultural sensitivity and interpersonal skills enabled him to build strong and lasting partnerships wherever he planted the Pepsi flag. Although Peter began his career with Coca Cola, he quickly moved to Pepsi in 1950 when it was still a one product company. He was promoted to President of Pepsi Cola International in 1963 after having served as VP of Marketing the previous four years. He ran Pepsi's international business, later as its CEO of International, for decades as well as served on Pepsi's Board of Directors. Upon Peter's retirement in 1985, Pepsi enjoyed revenues in excess of $7.5 billion, employed over 137,000 employees, and marketed products in 150 countries and territories. Social responsibility and a desire to help the youth within the many countries that Pepsi entered was always a focus point of Peter's approach. For example, in 1972 when Brazilian soccer star and ""national treasure"" Pele was approaching retirement, Peter signed the athlete to a global agreement to represent Pepsi while also providing a platform on which, according to Peter, ""Pele could play an active role in programs aimed to service the youth through a game played in 115 countries"". After retiring from PepsiCo in 1985, Peter continued in the beverage industry as Chairman of Monsieur Henri Wines, Ltd., (brand developer of Stolichnaya Vodka), as well as its successor company, MHW, Ltd., currently an industry leader in beverage alcohol import and distribution services. Peter Warren grew up in New York City, ""a product of the depression"", as he often commented. He enlisted in the army during World War II, leaving as a Captain seven years later at the war's conclusion. While developing his business career, Peter and his cherished wife, Maria, combined their love of travel with a passion for the fine arts and collecting. From travelers to collectors to Antiquarians, they established Maria and Peter Warren Antiques. Following Maria's death in 1991, Peter remained active in the antiques business, now joined by his beloved daughter AJ, who continues to run the business today. Creativity, vision, charm, wit, formidable negotiation skills, and social responsibility are just a few of the attributes that come to mind when describing Peter. Aside from work and hobbies, Peter also generously supported his local community. In particular he served as a two-term President of the Wilton Historical Society. He was also very active in supporting higher education and served as the former Chairman of the Council of Governing Boards in New York State. In that capacity he helped push legislation for affordable tuition at 110 independent colleges in the state. In 1984, Peter was awarded a Commendation for his support of secondary education by President Reagan. Most important of all, Peter was a beloved husband, father and grandfather and uncle in a remarkable family whom he treasured dearly. Following the loss of his beloved wife Maria in 1991, Peter was able to achieve newfound happiness when he married Holly Wright in 2009. Holly brought energy, love, and devotion to their daily life in Wilton, CT. Peter recently dealt with the loss of his daughter Carmen following her 22 year battle with cancer. He considered Carmen a true hero in every sense of the word and an inspiration to those who love life and bravely fight for every day that God allows. In addition to his wife Holly, Peter is survived by his children: Peter and AJ Warren; former daughter-in-law Peggy Warren; grandchildren, Joshua Allen, Peter Alexander and Christopher Aiden Warren of Kalispell, MT, Downers Grove, IL and Witon, CT; son-in law Ritch Robinson of City Island, NY; sister-in-law Christina Bracho; nieces and nephews Juan, Pablo, Monica and Diana Bracho of Houston, TX and Mexico City, DF; Giles and Hugh Parker of Medford, MA and Daytona Beach, FL and Ingrid and Kirby Warren of Tuxedo Park, NY. Services will be held on Thursday, July 17, 4:00-8:00pm at the Bouton Funeral Home, 31 W. Church St., Wilton CT, (203) 544-8461. The funeral mass will be held at Our Lady of Fatima Church, 229 Danbury Rd., on Friday, July 18 at 1:00pm with the burial to follow at St. Mary's Cemetery, 110 North St., Ridgefield, CT. In lieu of flowers, donations may be made in his memory to the Wilton Historical Society, St. Jude Children's Research Hospital or The National Breast Cancer Fund. For anyone who would like to attend, we will be serving ""high tea"" in memory of Peter--not just a dealer and a collector of English, Japanese and Chinese Period Tea Pots but also an avid tea drinker. The reception will be held after the burial at Wilton Historical Society, 224 Danbury Rd, Wilton, CT."

During his tenure Maestro Maazel and the Philharmonic commissioned and premiered nine works, including John Adams's Pulitzer Prize and Grammy Awardwinning On the Transmigration of Souls, commemorating the victims of 9/11. He led the Orchestra around the world, including the historic performance in Pyongyang, North Korea, the first there by an American orchestra, and the re-consecration of Dresden's Frauenkirche, destroyed during World War II. At home Maestro Maazel, a sensitive and singular interpreter, led complete symphonic cycles of Mahler and Beethoven, and memorable opera-in-concert performances of Ravel's L'Enfant et les sortileges, Puccini's Tosca, and Strauss's Elektra. He hired 19 Philharmonic musicians and conducted the Orchestra's inaugural performances in the DG Concerts series -- a groundbreaking initiative to offer live Philharmonic concerts exclusively as downloads.

The partners of McKinsey & Co. deeply mourn the passing of our cherished colleague and friend, Ali Hanna, who was an esteemed and valued member of our Firm for 23 years. Ali joined McKinsey in 1974 from Harvard Business School, having already earned a Ph.D. in nuclear physics from Queens University in Belfast. He was elected a Principal in 1979 and a Director in 1986, retiring from McKinsey in 1997. Following his productive tenure at McKinsey, Ali devoted much of his time to serving Alpha North America, a non profit that provides training programs to improve the health of churches. Ali was a brilliant and inspiring counselor to a wide array of client leaders. He provided insightful and seminal thinking in our microeconomic practice, leading our Firm's Microeconomic Center from 1984 to 1990, and our Stamford Office from 1993 to 1996. As an innovative and prescient leader, Ali had a profound impact on our Firm and the professional development of its partners and associates. He was a beloved mentor and loyal friend to a generation of McKinsey colleagues. Ali's countless contributions to our Firm, his entrepreneurship and contagious energy, his warm and humorous collegiality, and his caring friendship created an enduring legacy that will always be appreciated. We offer our deepest condolences to Ali's wife Nancy, his daughter Anne, and to his entire family, and we join them in mourning the loss of a truly remarkable man."

Born in Belfast, Northern Ireland, in 1945, Ali earned a B.Sc in Physics in 1968 and a Ph.D in Nuclear Physics in 1972, both from Queen's University, Belfast. In 1974, he received an MBA from Harvard Business School and joined McKinsey & Company where he became a Director and served as Managing Partner of the Stamford Office. Ali led the Firm's microelectronics and software practices and was a leader in the telecommunications and aerospace groups. Since retiring from McKinsey in 1997, Ali founded the non-profit organization, Alpha North America which offers the Alpha Course to churches in the U.S. to help them bring people to faith in Christ. In 2004, he brought Alpha to Latin America. With his wife, Nancy, he owned and operated Ardtara Country House Hotel in Upperlands, Northern Ireland. With partners, he was developing Bushmills Dunes Golf Resort outside Bushmills, Northern Ireland. Bushmill Dunes was the culmination of a life dream, combining Ali's passions for golf and for the people of Northern Ireland. Ali also served on the Boards of Fountain House, New York City; Trinity Church Wall Street; and Queen's University Foundation. He was president of U.S. Friends of Queen's. Beyond Ali's many professional contributions, Ali inspired and warmed almost every one he met. His kindness and love of life, his Irish way and humor, his respect for people and his deep faith and humility -- these characteristics, coupled with Ali's brilliance and perseverance, made him one of a kind.

Schwartz. Herb was one of the leading intellectual property trial lawyers of his generation, a trailblazer in the development of intellectual property law, and a mentor and colleague to hundreds of lawyers and law students who learned from him. After receiving his degree in electrical engineering from MIT in 1957, he received an M.A. in business and an L.L.B. from the University of Pennsylvania in 1964, where he was an editor of the Law Review. He was a partner from 1971 until his retirement in 2007, and served as managing partner of Fish & Neave from 1985 until 1991. Herb served as lead trial counsel in many cases for such prominent companies as Polaroid, Purdue Pharma, AstraZeneca, Digital Equipment and Motorola, among many others. His landmark victory for Polaroid against Eastman Kodak preserved Polaroid's exclusive position in instant photography. He was recognized for his courtroom excellence by being elected a fellow of the American College of Trial Lawyers. In addition to his litigation accomplishments, Herb worked outside the courtroom to advance the law, having served as a professor at both Penn and NYU law schools and as a 25-year member of the American Law Institute. He was the principal author of Patent Law and Practice, an oft-cited treatise originally prepared for use by federal judges. Herb also was a renowned sailor, having won many major regattas, such as the Swan American trophy, the New York Yacht Club Sesquicentennial and the Marblehead to Halifax race, and having won his class in the 2000 Newport to Bermuda race. He was a member of the New York Yacht Club, Riverside Yacht Club, the Cruising Club of America, the Greenwich Cove Racing Association, and was a trustee at the Woods Hole Oceanographic Institute.

The partners of McKinsey & Co. deeply mourn the passing of our cherished colleague and friend, Ali Hanna, who was an esteemed and valued member of our Firm for 23 years. Ali joined McKinsey in 1974 from Harvard Business School, having already earned a Ph.D. in nuclear physics from Queens University in Belfast. He was elected a Principal in 1979 and a Director in 1986, retiring from McKinsey in 1997. Following his productive tenure at McKinsey, Ali devoted much of his time to serving Alpha North America, a non profit that provides training programs to improve the health of churches. Ali was a brilliant and inspiring counselor to a wide array of client leaders. He provided insightful and seminal thinking in our microeconomic practice, leading our Firm's Microeconomic Center from 1984 to 1990, and our Stamford Office from 1993 to 1996. As an innovative and prescient leader, Ali had a profound impact on our Firm and the professional development of its partners and associates. He was a beloved mentor and loyal friend to a generation of McKinsey colleagues. Ali's countless contributions to our Firm, his entrepreneurship and contagious energy, his warm and humorous collegiality, and his caring friendship created an enduring legacy that will always be appreciated. We offer our deepest condolences to Ali's wife Nancy, his daughter Anne, and to his entire family, and we join them in mourning the loss of a truly remarkable man."

2014-07-21T00:00:00Z,"ROSENTHAL--Lois, 75, on July 20, 2014, died peacefully. She is survived by her husband Richard, their children Jennie (Allan) Berliant and David, her grandchildren Elizabeth and Andrew Berliant and Eva and Mae Rosenthal, and her brother Harvey (Mary) Reis. An activist, environmentalist, supporter and participant in organizations that defended the oppressed, the hungry, and the disadvantaged, she initiated many programs and activities. From the Ohio Innocence Project which has exonerated 17 wrongfully convicted people, to the Fresh Produce initiative at the Freestore Foodbank, and the Rosey Reader Program which has provided books to over 30,000 Cincinnati Public School children, grades K-3, to foster a love of reading, to her creation of Uptown Arts which provides free classes in art, music, acting and dance to five-ten year old city kids. During Lois' 28-year tenure on the board of the Cincinnati Playhouse in the Park, she and her husband established the Rosenthal New Play Prize which produced 15 world premier productions, several nominated both for the Pulitzer Prize and produced in New York. As a member of the Board of the Cincinnati Art Museum, Lois and Dick endowed the museum to allow free admission in perpetuity. Lois was also a member of the Board of The National Underground Railroad Freedom Center. There, once again drawing on her compassion for those with little or no voice, she envisioned, championed and funded Invisible: Slavery Today, the world's first museum-quality, permanent exhibition on the subjects of modern-day slavery and human trafficking. Along the way, Lois wrote a weekly consumer column for the Cincinnati Enquirer for 10 years, had a call-in radio show, and wrote features for several national magazines. Among her seven books, Living Better was a Book of the Month Club selection. Lois relaunched Story magazine in 1989 with her husband. In five of the 10 years she edited Story, it was nominated for the National Magazine Award for short fiction. In two of those years Story won the prestigious award. Like the founders of Story-- Whit Burnet and Martha Foley-- who first published the works of today's marquis writers, Lois first published stories by Juno Diaz, Elizabeth Graver and Nathan Englander among others. Mother, wife, friend to many, Lois Rosenthal transformed organizations, intellectually and with creative determination. We're all better for her high standards, her dynamic personality, the impact she made on so many lives, and her contagious enthusiasm for doing good."

2014-07-21T00:00:00Z,"PIENE--Otto. The Board of Trustees and staff of the Solomon R. Guggenheim Foundation deeply mourn the loss of Otto Piene. Piene played an important role in the revival of the contemporary art scene in Germany after World War II, forming the artist group Zero with Heinz Mack, and establishing an international network of colleagues who redefined art in the aftermath of the war. Piene pioneered the use of light as a medium for room-scaled installations that he called ""Light Ballets"" and the use of fire and smoke to make paintings. He subsequently realized his vision for transforming the sky into an arena for art, coining the term Sky Art. The Guggenheim will celebrate Piene in an exhibition this October, which was developed in close consultation with the artist. We extend our most heartfelt sympathy to the artist's family on the occasion of this untimely loss. William L. Mack, Chairman; and Jennifer Blei Stockman, President, Solomon R.

2014-07-24T00:00:00Z,"MERCK--Albert. Albert Wall Merck died peacefully at his home in Lexington, MA. on July 22. Following an early career at Merck & Co., he devoted decades of his life to public service in the fields of politics, education and philanthropy. He was born on August 31, 1920, the second son of George W. Merck, and Josephine Wall Merck. He was raised in Llewellyn Park, West Orange, NJ, and New York City, where he attended St. Bernard's School. He graduated from St. George's School in Newport, RI in 1939. His college years at Harvard were interrupted by the war, during which time he served as a first lieutenant in the field artillery in the Pacific. He returned to Harvard after the war, but chose to be included in the class of 1943. Mr. Merck married Katharine Evarts in 1946. They were devoted to each other for the following 68 years. Mr. Merck began his career at Merck & Co., the pharmaceutical company established in New York by his grandfather in 1890. The company originated with E. Merck of Darmstadt, Germany. In the mid-1960s Mr. Merck turned his attention to education and public service. He earned Masters degrees in Education at Columbia University and Rutgers University. Among many board memberships he served on the Boards of St. George's School and Westminster Choir College. He also served on Board of the Regional Plan Association from 1961 to 1987. He was Chairman of the RPA in the 1960s during a period of rapid expansion of the New York metropolitan area. In 1971, Mr. Merck was elected to the New Jersey Assembly, representing the portion of Morris County that includes Mendham, where he and his family were located for 47 years. Upon the advent of casino gambling in New Jersey, Mr. Merck was appointed to the Casino Control Commission by Gov. Brendan Byrne. He enjoyed the challenge of applying ethical principles to the work of the Commission and often found himself at odds with the casino interests. During the 1980's Mr. Merck served as Chairman of the New Jersey Board of Higher Education. He also held a seat on the Board of Merck & Co. for many years, retiring in 1993. In 1998 Mr. and Mrs. Merck moved to Brookhaven in Lexington, MA where he embarked on another phase of public service. He worked tirelessly to accelerate the adoption of information technology in the field of teaching and learning. These projects involved a wide variety of institutions including the Friends Academy of North Dartmouth, St. George's School, Lesley University and Harvard Graduate School of Education. Mr. Merck's family life included travel and summers in Mattapoisett, MA. He enjoyed sailing, fishing, reading, singing, and playing the piano. A raconteur and family patriarch, he delighted friends and family with anecdotes, wit and a superb grasp of history. Mr. Merck was pre-deceased by his daughter Katharine, and is survived by his wife Katharine, his son Albert in California, Friedrike Merck of Bearsville, NY, Patience Chamberlin of Exeter, NH, and Wilhelm Merck of Hamilton, MA. He had eight grandchildren and four great-grandchildren."

2014-07-25T00:00:00Z,"O'DALY--Fergus Jr.,71, of Northport, NY passed away on July 22, 2014. Fergus was born to the late Fergus Sr. and Mary (King) O'Daly, March 5, 1943 in Brooklyn, NY, where he grew up with the vibrancy that accompanies being the fifth of 10 children. It was also in Brooklyn that Fergus met Anita (Holst), with whom he would share 50 years of marriage. As a young family they moved to Long Island and have called the harbor village of Northport their home for the past 45 years. Fergus is survived by his four children: Christine (Michael) DiLandro, Bridget (John) Tarleton, Peggy (Eric) Colby and Fergus III. Fergus was blessed with six grandchildren who are a true reflection of his heart: Matthew, Brendan, Jack, Justin, Perry and Ansley. As a young man, Fergus had a passion for art and design. At age 16 he got a summer job as an assistant in the art department of a small ad shop, and the die was cast -- Fergus knew advertising would be his passion. He took nighttime art classes at Pratt while working in the mailroom at BBD&O. Hard work always paid off for Fergus, and a year later he was promoted to the art department where he earned that drawing board. He later joined Poppe Tyson, a small B2B agency. At 'Poppe', Fergus realized his potential and grew to take on the roles of Creative Director, President and finally CEO. Under Fergus' leadership, Poppe Tyson produced great work for such notable clients as Bethlehem Steel, Pfizer, Carter Wallace, Otis Elevator and, of course, several of New York City's finest steak houses, including Ben Benson's and Smith and Wolinsky's (where Fergus was always greeted warmly). However, equally important to the work was the relationships and culture that Fergus fostered among employees, clients and vendor partners this was his hallmark. As the advertising business evolved, Fergus was there he had a vision to build the first interactive ad agency. With Poppe's parent company, Bozell Jacobs Kenyon & Eckhart his conviction gave birth to DoubleClick, the first online media company, and Poppe.com, regarded for many firsts in the digital marketing era. Fergus would later go on to found FODA (Fergus O'Daly & Associates), which excelled at digital solutions for brands including: IBM, Coty Inc., HP, Toshiba and many others. But Fergus was much more than an ad guy. He drew his strength from family and friends. Growing up in a large family, he developed a strong sense of humor among many other survival skills. He was a partner to Anita and an always-proud Dad. He could be counted on for a joke or Irish song. He enjoyed the pulse of Manhattan, the tides of Northport, sailing on the Chesapeake, the inns of Ireland, an early tee time, walks with Molly and the Jersey Shore with family.

She was 75. Dr. McGivern will be remembered for her compassion and tireless work in nursing, nursing education and health policy, as well as her efforts on behalf of general education in New York State, as a 15 year member of the Board of Regents of New York State. Born Diane O'Neill in Cleveland, Ohio, Dr. McGivern earned her Bachelor of Science degree in nursing from St. John's College in Ohio and began her career as a staff nurse at the renowned Cleveland Clinic. After her marriage to Dr. Bernard McGivern, the couple moved to New York where Diane worked at Bellevue Hospital in Manhattan. She received her master's and Ph.D. degrees in nursing from New York University. As a nursing educator, Dr. McGivern taught first at Hunter College from 1966 to 1968, and the Division of Nursing at NYU from 1968 to 1972. From 1972 until 1977, she chaired the Adult Health and Illness section of the Department of Nursing at Lehman College of City University in the Bronx. In 1977, Dr. McGivern became Associate Dean and Professor of Nursing at the University of Pennsylvania School of Nursing. In 1987, McGivern became Head of the Division of Nursing at New York University's School of Education (now the College of Nursing), holding the Erline Perkins McGriff Professorship in Nursing. McGivern served as Division Head until 2002. ""Much of where we are today standing strong as a top-ranked and highly respected College of Nursing is thanks to Diane's vision and tireless advocacy on our behalf,"" said Eileen Sullivan-Marx, current Dean of the NYU College of Nursing. ""The lasting, positive influence that Diane has had on the College and on each and every one of us who had the privilege to work with her cannot be overstated. Among the many remarkable leaders we count among our distinguished NYUCN family, Diane truly stood out, and she will be greatly missed."" McGivern was a nursing scholar, editor, and author focusing on advancing the practice of nursing. She co-authored the comprehensive textbook, Nurse Practitioners: Evolution of Advanced Practice, used by students in advanced practice nursing programs nation-wide. Her accomplishments and awards included a gubernatorial appointment to the New Jersey Commission on Health Science, Education and Training and membership on the New York City Chancellor's Task Force on Child Health. Named a Robert Wood Johnson Health Policy Fellow in 1981, she held leadership positions in the American Nurses Association, American Association of Colleges of Nursing, American Academy of Nursing, National League for Nursing and the Nursing Cabinet of Mount Sinai/ NYU Health. She was appointed to commissions to acknowledge and elevate the contributions of the nursing profession to health care policy at the state and national level. In 1991, McGivern was the first nurse to be elected to the New York Board of Regents, which is responsible for the general supervision of all educational activities within the state, a post she held for 15 years. She was chosen vice chancellor of the board in 1998 and served in that capacity until 2001. In addition, she chaired the Blue Ribbon Task Force on the Future of Nursing in New York State, 2001. In addition to her professional accomplishments, Dr. McGivern was an elegant, articulate and lovely woman who shared her sharp intellect, culinary skills and warm sense of humor with her many friends and associates. The NYU family extends its sad condolences to her family, her husband, Dr. Bernard (Bud) McGivern, and her daughter, Ryan McGivern. New York University College of Nursing Eileen M.

2014-07-27T00:00:00Z,"SMITH--Joyce Arrington, passed away peacefully at home in Houston on Wednesday, the 16th of July 2014. Joyce was born in Tulsa, OK, and graduated from the University of Texas at Austin with a degree in education. In her early years, she taught elementary school in Houston and on military bases in Germany with the U.S. Department of Defense. After returning home, she received her Master's degree from the University of Houston. She married James Henry Smith, her loving husband for 20 years, and after their daughter was born, she continued working as a wife and mother. Later in life, she started a new career as a bridal consultant, which she enjoyed for over a decade. Joyce loved decorating for holidays, traveling with her daughter, and playing bridge with her friends. For two and a half years, Joyce valiantly battled invasive lobular carcinoma (ILC), a type of breast cancer that comprises 10-15% of all breast cancer diagnoses. It is the second most common type of breast cancer, affecting 30,000 women per year in the U.S. alone. ILC is not typically detected in yearly mammograms, so the cancer is more advanced when diagnosed and more difficult to treat. Likewise, its progression to other parts of the body can be difficult to see in x-rays and other types of scans. Joyce's dream was to help establish the world's first ILC clinic that would treat patients, educate the medical community about the disease, and help develop new therapies specifically targeting ILC. She also hoped to find a way to change insurance companies' restrictive rules for allowing breast MRIs (one of the few scans to reliably detect ILC) in the hope of increasing early ILC detection. Joyce was very passionate about her cause, and even during difficult treatments, she continued to work tirelessly to increase ILC awareness. Her family will continue this work in her memory. She is survived by her daughter, Jamie Smith Luff, son-in-law Martin Luff, and grandson James; sister, Joan Arrington Miers; and many other members of her extended family."

""The lasting, positive influence that Diane has had on the College and on each and every one of us who had the privilege to work with her cannot be overstated. Among the many remarkable leaders we count among our distinguished NYUCN family, Diane truly stood out, and she will be greatly missed.""

She was chosen vice chancellor of the board in 1998 and served in that capacity until 2001. In addition, she chaired the Blue Ribbon Task Force on the Future of Nursing in New York State, 2001.

Greenberg, our beloved and respected friend and husband of Kathryn O. Greenberg, Cardozo's Board Chair Emerita. Alan lent his heart unreservedly to the law school and to its students. With his brilliance, ingenuity, and practicality, he, with Kathy, advanced the very foundation of the law school. He made magic for Cardozo in a myriad of ways. Together with Kathy, a 1982 graduate of Cardozo and Chair of its Board of Overseers from 2003-2010, Alan supported initiatives that have had a profound impact on our students and faculty, including establishing a scholarship in his name that allows students who dream of pursuing a legal education to receive one at Cardozo, and supporting the creation of a new student center at the law school, The Kathryn O. and Alan C. Greenberg Center for Student Life given in honor of Dean David Rudenstine. Alan opened his home to our community, organized events, spoke with students and brought in speakers. Alan's lifetime philanthropic spirit matched Kathy's deeply held interest in providing access to justice for the underserved. Their combined passion gave rise to the Kathryn O. Greenberg Immigration Justice Clinic at Cardozo, the Guardianship Clinic, and the exponential expansion of the law school's public service auction, an enterprise that raises funds to support student work in public service. There are hundreds of Cardozo students and alumni whose public interest law experiences and careers were launched by the generosity of Alan and Kathy. Countless underrepresented individuals and communities have been served by these students and attorneys. There are few people who have the talent, the heart, the vision and skill to make better the lives of others and to advance the ethos of an institution. Alan Greenberg was such a man and everyone at Cardozo is deeply grateful and is better for having met and been touched by him.

He first joined the NYU School of Commerce, as it was then known, as a faculty member in 1947 after service in the Air Force. In two outstanding decades as dean, beginning in 1965, the School grew into a highly diversified institution with an international reputation for excellence in academic research and teaching through his emphasis on recruiting top faculty. And he ensured the School had a proud and fitting academic home -- Tisch Hall. Active even in retirement, Gitlow was a tireless supporter of NYU Stern, meeting with alumni, attending alumni conferences and gatherings, and setting an example of generosity and engagement for generations of students and alumni. A man of boundless optimism and energy, a cherished University citizen, and a wonderful colleague, Abe personified ""the School of Opportunity,"" and transformed the School and the lives of generations of students.

2014-07-28T00:00:00Z,"MAZZOLA--John W.,who led Lincoln Center for The Performing Arts for twenty years, passed away on Thursday, July 24, 2014 in New York City. He was 86. A lawyer with the firm of Millbank, Tweed, Hadley and McCloy, he joined Lincoln Center in 1962 and became its chief executive officer in 1968. Mr. Mazzola skillfully steered the expansion of Lincoln Center and its programs, providing access to high quality performing arts to a city depressed by financial hardship. He passionately increased accessibility to the arts through public and televised concerts. Above all, his family was his overriding theme and connection. As noted in an article written by George Sturm for the Music Associates of America, ""(i)t is as if the communion with his wife Sylvia and daughters Alison and Amy(was) constantly recharging his battery, making it possible for him to make vital, productive and imaginative connections among the countless details of his daily labors."" He was decorated Cavaliere Ufficiale Ordine al Merito della Repubblica Italiana and Officer Ordre des Arts et des Lettres France. He was a member of The Misquamicut Club (Rhode Island). He was born and raised in Bayonne, New Jersey and was a graduate of Tufts University (1949) and the Fordham Law School (1952). He served in the Air Force USN 45-46 and in Japan with the CIC-US Army 53-55. Mr. Mazzola is survived by his wife Sylvia (Drulie), a former theatrical producer, daughter Alison Mazzola, sister Jane Sharkey, son-in-law Terence ""Tad"" Flynn, and beloved grandchildren James Davis Flynn and Christina Pleasant Flynn. He was predeceased by his daughter Amy Mazzola Flynn. He will be remembered for his wry wit, storytelling, his love of cooking and entertaining. He loved sailing and the East Beach. Visitation will be held Monday, July 28 from 2:00pm to 6:00pm at Frank E. Campbell at 1076 Madison Avenue.

His books have been published in Britain and translated into Italian, German, and Danish. His creativity also included a lifelong love of jazz, and he played both piano and vibraphone. He loved sailing, the Red Sox, good conversation, and he even tried his hand at farming. He also wrote and narrated the soundtrack for the original Salem Witch Museum, in Salem, Massachusetts.

He attended the Buckley School, the Fay School, St. Paul's School, and Yale University.

2014-08-03T00:00:00Z,"WELCH--Thomas. Born December 4, 1915. Great-grandson of Thomas Bramwell Welch, inventor of Dr. Welch's ""Unfermented Grape Drink"" and pioneer of the fruit juice industry. Grandson of Charles Edgar Welch, who formed the Welch Grape Juice Co. Son of Edgar Thomas Welch, President of the Welch Grape Juice Co. Thomas Welch attended Swarthmore College, transferred to Cornell University from which he graduated in 1939. He was one of the first people hired for the Linde Division of Union Carbide Corporation in Buffalo, NY, which was testing a variety of inorganic chemicals, including silicone. In the early 1940's, the US started researching the properties of silicones to help with the war effort. Thomas worked for Union Carbide developing the silicone business from 1940 until his retirement in 1976. With a B.S. in Chemistry, Thomas ultimately rose to the highest level of Union Carbide's corporate structure with appointment to the company's Central Management Committee in 1965. In 1967 he was appointed Director of Research and Development, Chemicals and Plastics Division. He managed the design and construction of the $37 million (today's dollars) research facility at Tarrytown, NY. Between 1969 and his retirement in 1976, Thomas directed a team of 250 researchers and staff at Tarrytown as well as those at two other locations, in Pennsylvania and West Virginia. At the time of his retirement, the company's silicone business, one that Thomas was key in developing, had reached sales equivalent of $450 million in today's dollars. After retiring at age 60, Thomas, together with his wife Jane Todd Welch, devoted most of their energies to charitable activities, especially helping to advance the work of their daughter, Martha G. Welch MD, who had pioneered a method for treating childhood emotional, behavioral and developmental disorders. Thomas's counsel and support led her to transition from private practice to her current basic and clinical research position as Associate Professor of Psychiatry and Co-Director of the Nuturescience Program in Pediatrics at Columbia University Medical Center. Thomas continued to play a key role in Dr. Welch's research career as mentor and advisor up until the time of his death. During his career at Union Carbide and throughout his long life, Thomas Welch was highly loved and respected. He will long be remembered and deeply missed for his compassion, his ethics and his moral compass."

Ruth and her late husband Leonard began collecting art in the late 50's, and were drawn to artists such as Alexander Calder, Jean Dubuffet, Wifredo Lam, Eduardo Matta, the Chicago Imagists and European Surrealists. Together they created a diverse collection motivated by what they liked, often buying works by unknown artists. After Leonard's death in 1983, Ruth enthusiastically continued to support artists young and old and to buy folk art, outsider art and local contemporary art along with work by more well-known artists. Ruth donated their large collection of Calder mobiles and stabiles to the Museum of Contemporary Art, Chicago, of which she and Leonard were founding members, and also donated works of art to the Art Institute and to the Smart Museum at the University of Chicago. She was a chair of the Hyde Park Art Center for 40 years and a board member of Poetry Magazine and the Art Institute of Chicago, a supporter of the outsider art museum In'tuit and many theaters in Chicago such as Victory Gardens and Steppenwolf. The Horwiches were also instrumental in donating to the city of Chicago the large outdoor sculpture by Jean Dubuffet which stands in the plaza of the State of Illinois building. They knew many of the artists whose work they collected which gave the collection a special feeling, and this included artists such as Calder, Lam and Dubuffet along with many Chicago artists. She generously opened her home to artists and museum groups and enjoyed sharing her love of art with everyone. As her oldest great grandson, Jasper, said, when asked what he loved about his great-grandmother, ""Her house was like a museum but you could touch everything!"" She is survived by her four children, Barbara Horwich Lloyd, Jonathan, Ann Snider, Bill, by three grandchildren, Pamela Lloyd (Renny Gleeson), Emily Shaw (Simon Shaw) and Roanne Horwich, and by four great-grandchildren, Jasper, Rufus, Sophie and Willow.

2014-08-06T00:00:00Z,"SWARTZ--Barbara E.,died peacefully in New York on July 31, 2014 at age 69 after a long period of declining health. Formerly the director of the New York University Law School's clinic at Bedford Hills Prison, she later became a Distinguished Professor of Law at Touro College Law Center, Long Island, where she also created the school's human rights program in Berlin. A long-time human rights advocate, she served as a consultant to the World Health Organization and other international groups. Her passion later in life was mediation, helping people amicably resolve both domestic and workplace disputes. For several years, she served as a commentator on Court TV. She earned a J.D. from NYU and master's degrees in political science and public health from the Universities of Michigan and Columbia, respectively. Barbara was diagnosed with kidney disease at age 28 and spent 12 years on hemodialysis before receiving a kidney transplant, which sustained her life during the past 18 years. She demonstrated an indomitable will to live a full life and to act on her commitment to human rights in spite of the limitations imposed by illnesses, inspiring many by her example. Barbara loved to travel and developed lasting friendships worldwide. She met her husband, Knud-Erik Rosenkrantz, in Copenhagen 35 years ago.

His wise counsel and genial countenance will be sorely missed."
2014-08-06T00:00:00Z,"ROSENGARTEN--Frank, was a truly extraordinary person. He fell in love with Italy as a young man and devoted the rest of his life to studies related to its culture and politics, receiving a PhD from Columbia University in the 1950's in Italian. He wrote many books and numerous articles on important people in the anti-fascist press there. This passion tied in with his longtime interest in socialism, and he was a co-founder and an editor of the journal Socialism and Democracy. Gramsci became a special focus of his work and he translated Gramsci's letters from prison. A professor of Italian studies at several universities, he was Professor Emeritus at Queens College. But his interests covered many subjects unrelated to Italian, and included a love of theater, movies, and music and books, which he devoured on many subjects. But more important than his many accomplishments, including receiving his second Doctorate, in his retirement, in French from The CUNY graduate Center. His dissertation on the young Proust received an award. More importantly was his gift for friendship. His love for and loyalty to friends and family were total. If you had the rare privilege of being part of his circle, you had a friend and mentor for life. He adored his children Dan and Lydia, and his late son, Philip as well as his grandchildren, Melina and Emi, and his sister Jo. He was also a devoted husband of over 30 years to his late wife, Lucille. He was irreplaceable and his absence will leave a big hole in all their hearts. A memorial service will be held at the Casa Italiana in the fall, and there will be a shiva on Thursday night at his apartment, 160 East 84th. He will leave a hole in peoples hearts and lives."

He fell in love with Italy as a young man and devoted the rest of his life to studies related to its culture and politics, receiving a PhD from Columbia University in Italian. He wrote many books and numerous articles on important people in the anti-fascist press there. This passion tied in with his longtime interest in socialism, and he was a co-founder and an editor of the journal Socialism and Democracy. Gramsci became a special focus of his work and he edited Gramsci's Letters from Prison. A professor of Italian studies at several universities, he was Professor Emeritus at Queens College. But his interests covered many subjects unrelated to Italian, and included a love of theater, movies, music and books, which he devoured on many subjects. During his retirement, he received a second doctorate in French from the CUNY Graduate Center, and his dissertation on the young Proust received an award. But more important than all his accomplishments was his gift for friendship. His love for and loyalty to friends and family were total. If you had the rare privilege of being part of his circle, you had a friend and mentor for life. He adored his children Dan and Lydia, his grandchildren, Melina and Emi, and his sister Jo. He was irreplaceable and his absence will leave a big hole in all their hearts and lives.
